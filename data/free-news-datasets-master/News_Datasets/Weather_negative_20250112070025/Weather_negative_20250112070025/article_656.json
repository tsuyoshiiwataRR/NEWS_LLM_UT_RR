    "text": "MONTANA - Residents across Montana should prepare for cold temperatures and snow this weekend. Temperatures this morning ranged from 18 degrees in Bozeman to 28 degrees in Missoula. Billings saw 23 degrees, while Glasgow recorded 15 degrees.\nFreezing fog advisories are in effect until 11:00 a.m., creating slick road conditions, especially in the northern parts of the state. Improvements are expected as the morning progresses, but travel in western Montana may still be challenging.\nCloud cover is increasing in the west, with isolated snow potential in higher elevations. Statewide, conditions are mostly dry, calm, and clear. However, winds are expected to pick up, especially along the Rocky Mountain Front, reaching up to 30 mph on Saturday.\nYellowstone National Park and adjacent areas in North Idaho could see up to a foot of snow this weekend. Winter storm watches are anticipated for northeastern Montana and southern Wyoming. Travelers are advised to avoid heading to Yellowstone National Park due to difficult conditions.\nToday's temperatures will remain in the 20s and 30s in the east, with Billings reaching 49 degrees. Overnight lows will drop below freezing. Snow potential will continue through the weekend, affecting lower valleys and bringing rounds of snow across the region.\nResidents should prepare for a drier spell later in the week.\nMore from this section Strong gusty winds will continue across the region with rain/snow in the eastern plain, all expected to clear by Thursday morning Breezy conditions along the Rockies, with weak disturbances possible in western Montana through Friday and Saturday Strong winds are expected across Montana on Wednesday with widespread gusts over 50 mph possible",

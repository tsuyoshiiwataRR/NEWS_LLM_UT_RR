    "text": "Severe Flood and Landslide Warnings Issued\nA severe flood warning for the Belize River and its tributaries, with flooding conditions persisting in the Belize River Valley and downstream communities, has been issued.\nThe causeway at Crooked Tree is impassable. Additionally, a landslide warning is in effect for areas on the Eastern Slopes of the Maya Mountains for the next 24 hours. Commuters are advised to exercise extreme caution. The next update will be issued as necessary.\nIn Region 7, above-normal levels are expected on the Rio Hondo, affecting areas from Blue Creek North to the coast, including Santa Cruz, San Antonio, San Roman, and Douglas. Similarly, above-normal levels are anticipated on the New River at Hill Bank, Tower Hill, and Caledonia, extending to the coast.\nIn Region 9, residents are urged to closely monitor waterways and exercise extreme caution. The Mopan River at Benque Viejo Town is expected to approach bankfull stage, while levels on the Macal River at Fortis Facilities are being closely monitored. The Chalillo spillway is active, but levels at Mollejon and Vaca facilities should remain below the spillway. At San Ignacio, levels are expected to remain below the Low-Lying bridge. On the Belize River at More Tomorrow, normal levels are expected, but decreasing flood stages are expected at Double Run, where levels are expected to approach bankfull. The Crooked Tree Lagoon continues to exceed the causeway, with flood levels slowly decreasing.\nIn Region 11, the Sibun River at Freetown Sibun is expected to have below-normal levels, while the Southern Lagoon at Gales Point Village will continue to see above-normal levels. On the Eastern Slopes of the Maya Mountains and the Sittee River at Kendal Bridge, above-normal levels are forecasted. Above-normal levels are also expected on branches of the Monkey River at Swasey and Bladen, and on the Deep River at Medina Bank. On the Rio Grande at San Pedro Columbia, normal levels are expected, but above-normal levels are predicted at Big Falls South. The Moho River at Blue Creek South and Jordan will experience above-normal levels, while the Temash River at Crique Sarco is expected to remain at normal levels.\nIn Region 13, the Sarstoon River is expected to experience above-normal levels.",

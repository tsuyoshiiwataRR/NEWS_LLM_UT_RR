    "text": "The frigid temperatures will continue for at least another day in the GTA but a slight warmup could be on the horizon for later this weekend.\nEnvironment Canada says that the temperature will hover around -8 C this morning but feel closer to -16 as wind gusts of up to 40 kilometres per hour continue to bring bone-chilling temperatures to the region.\nThe conditions will improve slightly on Friday afternoon but barely, with a daytime high of -3 C that will still feel like -7.\nOn Saturday, Torontonians will wake up to another cold morning with an expected temperature of -10 C that will feel as cold as -15 with the wind chill.\nHowever, conditions will improve throughout the day reaching a high of 0 C on Saturday afternoon.\nResidents can then expect a stretch of milder albeit rainy days, with daytime highs of 4 C on Sunday, 5 C on Monday and 4 C on Tuesday.\nWhile there is no snow in Environment Canada’s short-term forecast for Toronto, CP24 Meteorologist Bill Coulter says that some residents north of the city could see five to 10 centimetres per hour at times on Friday due to some bands of active weather.\nParts of cottage country, including Bracebridge and Gravenhurst, remain under a snow squall warning as does Orillia.\n“Here it is going to be a beautiful but cold day. North of the city, though, there still are some bands coming across central and eastern Lake Huron and southeastern Georgian Bay,” Coulter said. “While we rejoice under that sunshine some areas will still see a rate of 5 to 10 centimetres per hour of snow on top of what they saw yesterday. So it is going to be dangerous conditions on a lot of the roadways if you are headed in that direction.”",

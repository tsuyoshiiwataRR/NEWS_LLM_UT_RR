    "text": "Tracking severe weather: Timing, location of expected freezing rain Friday night\nThe entire state of Iowa is under a winter weather advisory Friday with freezing rain moving in from the west this afternoon.\nIce storm warnings east and north of the metro go into effect as early as 3 p.m. Friday. Expect ice accumulations of two-tenths to three-tenths of an inch, with up to another inch of snow and sleet, which could cause power outages and tree damage, along with dangerous travel conditions.\nClosings | Interactive Radar | Weather Alerts\nHere's what you need to know:\nTiming, location of expected freezing rain Friday night\nLight freezing drizzle or freezing rain is expected to develop over western Iowa during the early evening, mainly after 5 p.m. This will initially impact areas around Atlantic, Creston, and Lamoni. The freezing drizzle and light freezing rain should then expand into the Des Moines metro by 7 to 9 p.m. and spread across the rest of the state by Midnight to 3 a.m. The freezing rain should generally be on the light side, but with temperatures in the 20s, we will see ice accumulation.\nRain rates likely increase between 3 and 6 a.m. Saturday, resulting in more significant accumulations of ice. This is most likely to occur just east of Des Moines, affecting areas around Ottumwa up to Marshalltown and back west to Newton and Pella. Ice accumulations of around or just over a quarter-inch are possible in this area. That is enough to not only create treacherous travel, but also possibly cause some minor tree damage and scattered power outages.\nIn the Des Moines metro, ice accumulations should be a little lighter and come to an end by 7 to 8 a.m. as temperatures climb above freezing. Still, very slick roads and some minor ice accumulation on trees and power lines is likely. The warmer temperatures should spread across the rest of the state during the morning hours, turning the freezing rain over to a plain, cold rain and ending the icing threat.\nTravel not advised: Stay home if you can\nFreezing rain resulting in accumulating ice across most of Iowa will make for potentially dangerous travel conditions Friday afternoon into Saturday morning.\nIn some areas, including the warned areas north and east of the metro, the National Weather Service warns that travel could be nearly impossible as roads — especially bridges and overpasses — could be very icy and slick.\nInjuries can happen when you slip and fall\nIf you are going outside, watch your first few steps taken on stairs, sidewalks, and driveways, Polk County Emergency Management warns. These surfaces could be icy and slippery, increasing your risk of a fall and injury.\nVIDEO: Iowa road crews, airport workers prepare for freezing rain\nPolk County Extreme Temperature Plan in effect\nPolk County Emergency Management's Extreme Temperature Plan is in effect through Friday due to dangerously cold conditions.\nAs part of the plan, Des Moines Area Regional Transport will provide free rides to warming centers in Polk County. See a full list of local warming centers.\nWeekend forecast for Des Moines\nToday: Cloudy. High 25F. Winds E at 10 to 20 mph.\nTonight: Cloudy with light freezing rain expected, becoming heavier overnight. Some icing likely. Low 25F. Winds ESE at 10 to 20 mph.\nSaturday: Freezing rain early, changing to rain in the afternoon. Some icing possible. High around 35F. Winds E at 10 to 20 mph.\nSaturday night: Showers tapering off in the evening with foggy conditions overnight. Low 32F. Winds N at 5 to 10 mph.\nSunday: Cloudy skies. High 42F. Winds S at 10 to 15 mph.\nSunday night: A few clouds from time to time. Low 33F. Winds SW at 10 to 15 mph.",

    "text": "WATERTOWN, New York (WWNY) - Currently, heavy lake effect snow extends inland from Lake Ontario, focusing on northern Oswego, southern Jefferson and most of Lewis counties.\nIt dumped a foot of snow overnight near Watertown and more than that south of Watertown.\nAt 5:30am Friday, the lake band, producing snowfall rates of up to 3-4″ per hour was located from near Sandy Island to Worth to near Copenhagen.\nThe band is slowly shifting south early this morning, and based on the radar trend, will continue to shift south, with a possible quick drop south before slowing down again in the next hour or two.\nThrough this morning the band will continue south, crossing the Tug Hill region and ending up in northern, or even central Oswego County by late morning.\nWhere the snow is coming down, look for another 7-14″ to pile up Friday before it weakens and the lake effect snow band disappears.\nOutside of lake effect areas, expect mainly dry weather and even some sunshine today.\nCopyright 2024 WWNY.

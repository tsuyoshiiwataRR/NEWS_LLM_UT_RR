    "text": "By Aditi Rathi ,\n1 days ago\nCalifornia is facing another widespread fire which has been named the Malibu Fire or Franklin Fire. The flames began at about 10:50 pm on Monday at about ten acres. However, with time, it has spread to more than 2,800 acres as of Tuesday. Several areas around the celebrity-studded city have been engulfed in fire.\n​\nThe areas affected by the fire , according to the map provided by the Los Angeles County Fire Department's website are east of Malibu Canyon Road, Serra Retreat area, and the south of Piuma Road. Authorities have issued mandatory evacuation in these areas as the fire is spreading rapidly with 7% containment.\nTens of thousands of people are facing power cuts since Monday night. The strong gusts of winds from Santa Monica can damage all electrical equipment which can result in being the cause of a wildfire .\n​\nAs of Tuesday night, about seven structures have been destroyed, while eight have been damaged.\nAccording to CBS, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna shared updates on evacuation in Malibu on Wednesday morning. Luna shared that the areas north of Pacific Coast Highway, south of Mulholland Highway, east of Trancas, and west of Crestline have been given evacuation warnings.\nThis means that the residents of these areas need to remain ready to evacuate at any time.\n​\nOn the other hand, areas east of Corral Canyon, south of Piuma Road, and west of Big Rock are under evacuation orders.\nA spokesperson for Malibu city named Matt Myerhoff also shared details about the evacuation process.\n​\n\"The way evacuations are conducted by the Sheriff's department is they go door to door. They drive up and down the streets with a blowhorn and they knock on every single door. They wake people up and get them out of their houses.\" ​\nDue to the spreading Malibu fire, several roads have also been closed to keep people safe. The Pacific Coast Highway between Kanan Dume Road and Tuna Canyon Road has been closed. PCH eastbound, Malibu Canyon Road, and Topanga Canyon Boulevard are also closed.\nEvacuation warnings have been issued in the areas west of Topanga Canyon Boulevard, east of Kanan Dune Road and Trancas Canyon Road, and south of Mulholland Highway.\n​",

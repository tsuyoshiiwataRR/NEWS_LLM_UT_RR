    "text": "A winter weather travel advisory has been issued for Lindsay and southern Kawartha Lakes.\nEnvironment Canada says the winter weather travel advisory is in effect for Thursday afternoon into Thursday evening.\nLocal snowfall accumulations of five cm is predicted. Poor visibility in bursts of heavy snow and local blowing snow are expected.\nLake effect snow extending inland from Georgian Bay will continue to affect the area into this evening. Brisk winds gusting up to 50 kilometres an hour will result in local blowing snow with poor visibility.\n“Travel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather,” Environment Canada warns. “Be prepared to adjust your driving with changing road conditions. If visibility is reduced while driving, turn on your lights and maintain a safe following distance.”\nFor road conditions and other traveller information from the Ministry of Transportation, visit [ontario.ca/511](https://www.ontario.ca/511), [twitter.com/511Ontario](https://www.twitter.com/511Ontario), or call [511](http://511).\nContinue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada for the latest information.

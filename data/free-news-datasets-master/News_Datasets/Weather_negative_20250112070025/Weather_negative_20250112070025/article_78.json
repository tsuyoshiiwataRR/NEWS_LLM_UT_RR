    "text": "The Buffalo Bills had to cancel practice on Thursday because of terrible weather conditions brought on by a winter storm.\nPer ESPN’s Alaina Getzenberg, the Buffalo Bills canceled their practice after 30 inches of snow hit the Orchard Park area. The team decided to hold a virtual meeting instead, as a travel ban in certain areas has been implemented for safety reasons.\nThe Bills, coming off a disappointing defeat at the hand of the Los Angeles Rams despite a six-touchdown day from Josh Allen, travel to Detroit to take on the NFC-leading Lions this Sunday.\nIn a potential Super Bowl 59 preview, Allen and the 10-3 Bills will look to hand the 12-win Lions just their second loss of the season. Detroit’s only defeat came at the hands of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 2.\nSports Illustrated has named Josh Allen as the Player Of The Year!\n— Built in Buffalo (@BuiltInBuffalo_)[#Bills]|[#BillsMafia]|[#GoBills]|[#BuiltInBuffalo][pic.twitter.com/sUcMslN1Te][December 12, 2024]\nAlso Read: REPORT: 2 Former NBA Superstars Just Became Part-Owners Of The Buffalo Bills\nThe Buffalo Bills, who already locked up their fifth straight AFC East division title, are tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the AFC’s second seed. The Bills’ loss to the Rams subsequently dropped them to two games behind the Kansas City Chiefs for the conference’s top seed.\nClick on ‘Follow Us’ and get notified of the most viral NFL stories via Google! Follow Us\nBuffalo last met Detroit at Ford Field in a Thanksgiving Thursday game in 2022. The game featured three scores inside the final three minutes, with Tyler Bass kicking the game-winning field goal in the final seconds.\nBuffalo Bills Can Make A Statement In Detroit\nJosh Allen and company made one statement a few weeks ago when they took down Patrick Mahomes and the previously undefeated Chiefs at Highmark Stadium. But the Bills’ three losses have come on the road against teams with winning records, and they’re facing a strong likelihood of needing to win one away game to reach the Super Bowl.\nIf the Bills can upset the team that is far-and-away the best in the NFC, they’ll remind everybody that they can hang in there with anyone on any given Sunday.\nAlso Read: VIDEO: Fan Footage Caught Shirtless Buffalo Bills Fan Having Way Too Much Fun In The Snow In Below Freezing Temperatures",

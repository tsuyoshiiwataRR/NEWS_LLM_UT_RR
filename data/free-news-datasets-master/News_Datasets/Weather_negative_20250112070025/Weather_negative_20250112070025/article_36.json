    "text": "The City of Owen Sound has declared a significant weather event with the region under a blizzard warning on Thursday as lake-effect snow squalls hammer the area.\n“Travel is expected to be extremely hazardous due to widespread poor visibility,” stated Environment Canada.\nThe wicked weather is expected to bring anywhere from 40 to 80 centimetres of snow accumulation right into Friday across Grey County, with gusty westerly winds up to 80 kilometres per hour creating near-zero visibility.\nDownload the CTV News app to get local alerts on your device Get the latest local updates sent to your email inbox The national weather agency anticipates the blizzard conditions to ease later Thursday afternoon, but the heavy snowfall will continue over the next 24 hours.\nThe City’s declaration of a significant weather event gives residents notice service levels and road closures are likely.\n“Restoring the roads to optimal conditions may take longer than usual,” the City stated on its website.\nAll streets and sidewalks in Owen Sound are in a “state of repair” until the declaration has ended.\nLater Thursday afternoon, the blizzard warning shifted to a snow squall warning.",

    "text": "Two weeks before the big day, and David Phillips is already getting asked the big question.\nWill it be a white Christmas?\nWhen it comes to Niagara, the senior climatologist with Environment Canada is hesitant to give an answer — especially this far out. However, he said, all the evidence so far this month, combined with the slightly easier to predict temperature forecasts, suggest a blanket of snow on the ground is not likely in the offing when Niagarans wake up on Christmas morning.\n“We’re not seeing a huge chance,” he said. “There are a couple teasers in the offing if we look two weeks ahead.”\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW So far in December, temperatures have been about two degrees above normal. Phillips said this comes after a fall that has been the warmest on record. It’s also been a dry one, with very little in way of significant rainfall.\n“It’s been a dry fall,” he said. “And going into December, there may have been some rain, flurries and that, but the total amount of precipitation has gone way down. We’re into almost an invisible kind of drought across Ontario, really.”\nIf it is indeed a green Christmas in Niagara this year, it’ll simply be the continuation of a pattern. Over the last 10 years, there have only been four white Christmases, which Phillips said is defined by having at least two centimetres of snow on the ground — not really enough to go tobogganing, but enough at least to make the picture outside more white than green or brown.\nIn Niagara, he said, a white Christmas simply cannot be counted on even more.\n“I often say that instead of dreaming about it, we have to pray for it because in the last several years, it really has been a lot more green than white,” Phillips said.\nInstead, what Niagara can expect to see is what Phillips calls “yo-yo weather”: temperatures dipping a few degrees below freezing and then going back up again. He said there’s bound to be some snow in the next couple of weeks, though he doubts there will be much more than flurries.\nThat being said, Phillips pointed out that two weeks from now, he could very well have egg on his face. Niagara could very well be hit by a storm that hasn’t been born yet, but suddenly develops in the U.S. before moving up here.\n“A Colorado low or a Texan Panhandler coming in the area, bumping into some arctic air, coming and settling in — all of a sudden, you get dumped on. Those things have happened,” he said.\n“But I’m looking ahead, and this is what I see. I don’t see anything ominous with regards to major systems and a kind of bouncing back and forth in terms of temperatures.”",

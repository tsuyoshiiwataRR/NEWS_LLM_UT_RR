    "text": "The iceman cometh to town as freezing rain and drizzle are expected to hit the Tri-city area on Friday. Ice accumulation ranging from a light glaze to 0.1 of an inch is not out of the question, according to the National Weather Service in Hastings. Preluding Friday's dicey weather, wind chills are expected to drop to as low as minus-5 degrees overnight on Thursday. Precipitation is expected to begin Friday evening in Grand Island -- with Kearney, Hastings and every town in between in the same position. The forecast calls for a high of 33 degrees on Friday, dipping to a low of 28. “Main concern lies with low-level and surface temperatures, as models are showing the potential for freezing rain/freezing drizzle to occur,” the weather service office in Hastings said. People are also reading… What’s more, outright rain and snow are not out of the question. The wet, icy weather is expected to linger into the overnight hours and possibly into Saturday morning. But as you break out the ice melt, take this forecast with a grain of salt. While the weather service says the greatest chances for precipitation are along and east of Highway 281, even a change of a couple degrees could make all the difference. As the forecasters say, “There are differences between models with temperatures, which affects confidence.” But you can increase your confidence as you hit the roads — or even step outside on the porch — by behaving as if surfaces are slick. AAA offers the following tips for driving on slick surfaces: - Drive slowly. Always adjust your speed down to account for lower traction when driving on snow or ice. - Accelerate and decelerate slowly. Apply the gas slowly to regain traction and avoid skids. Don’t try to get moving in a hurry and take time to slow down for a stoplight. Remember: It takes longer to slow down on icy roads. - Increase your following distance to five to six seconds. This increased margin of safety will provide the longer distance needed if you have to stop.",

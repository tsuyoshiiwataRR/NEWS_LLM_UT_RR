    "text": "Huge heatwave about to bake Australia\nA severe to extreme heatwave will hit several Australian states and territories from this weekend into next week, sending temperatures soaring to the mid to high forties in places.\nA prolonged period of intense heat will sweep across Australia in the coming days as a hot airmass over the country’s north gets drawn towards the sotheast by a broad low pressure trough.\nThe mercury is set to soar into the low to mid forties in parts of NSW, Vic, Qld, SA, the NT and WA this weekend and early next week, likely reaching 45 to 46°C in some places. This will be the hottest weather [so far this year](https://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/canberra-facing-hottest-day-in-almost-five-years/1890201) in some parts of the country.\nThe impending heat will be intense enough and last long enough to be classified as a severe to extreme heatwave in multiple states and territories.\nImage: Heatwave severity forecast for the three days starting on Sunday, December 15, 2024\nWhile the highest temperatures during this heatwave will be outside the capital cities, some of them will get a burst of summer heat:\n- Adelaide is forecast to reach 40°C on Sunday\n- Melbourne could hit 41°C on Monday\n- Canberra should reach about 39°C on Monday\n- Western Sydney is predicted to climb to about 41°C on Tuesday\nThis heatwave will contribute to extreme fire danger in parts of Vic and SA on Monday, while widespread high fire danger is likely in other parts of the country over the weekend and early next week.\nThe coincident heat across southeastern Australia may put strain on the National Electricity Market (NEM), particularly early next week, although power outages are [not anticipated](https://www.aemo.com.au/market-notices) at this stage.\nHeatwaves cause more deaths in Australia than any other natural disaster. You can mitigate the effects of a heatwave by:\n- Staying inside a cool building during the hottest part of the day\n- Avoiding sports during the day\n- Drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated\n- Taking cool showers or baths\n- Avoiding direct exposure to the sun where possible\n[www.weatherzone.com.au](https://www.weatherzone.com.au)in the credit.",

Jack McGuire fueled that run with a long ball, a three-point play off of a baseline drive and a free throw. Michael Manning rained in a three and Traetow added a breakaway to complete the run. Colton Hoben hit a drive shot for the thunder at the end of the quarter leaving the Thunder trailing 18-6 going into the second stanza.\nGrandview scored the first five points of the second period and then the Dutch went on a 13-0 run for a comfortable 31-11 lead. Tyson Barnes got things going with an inside three-point play and a steal and a breakaway layup. Teagan Hoekstra and McGuire each scored twice on the inside to complete the run. But in basketball leads can never be too comfortable.\nGrandview whittled the lead down to 33-18 at halftime and then the Thunder used a 20-7 third period advantage to pull within two at 40-38. In that run their big guy, 6-foot-9 Emilano Barrantes, became a thorn in the side of the Dutch.\nHoben opened the final frame with an inside bucket to tie the score, but Barnes answered with an inside bucket to keep the Dutch in front. Then Jameson Schamberg drained a triple to give the Thunder a 43-42 lead. A baseline jumper by Barnes and a rebound putback by Austin Schulte gave Pella its last lead at 46-43 with 3:21 left in the game.\nThe Thunder still had something left in the tank and they ripped off a 12-2 run for a 55-48 run with 25 second left. The hole was too deep to dig out of and the Thunder relished a 57-53 comeback win.\nFor Pella it was simply a case of shots that fell so easily in the first half, just refused to go down in the second half. And the physical size and physical play of the Thunder may have worn them down. Ice packs may have been a popular item after this game.\nMcGuire led the Dutch with 18 hard earned points and Barnes added 12. Barrantes knocked down 20 points GV Christian and Schamberg added 11.\n“We played very well in the first half,” Pella Coach Derek Schulte said. “We put forth a good defensive effort and I was proud of their play. They came out much more physical in the second half and we did not match their play. It is a learning situation and we will learn from it.”\nThe Dutch are back in action Saturday afternoon when they host the Bloodhounds from Fort Madison.\nGrandview Christian 6 12 20 19 - 57\nPella 8 15 7 13 - 53\nPella Scoring (FG FTM-FTA Pts) – Jack McGuire 7 3-5 18, Colin Kerndt 2 0-0 4, Michael Manning 2 0-0 5, Tyson Barnes 5 1-3 12, Brayden Traetow 3 i-I 8, Teagen Hoekstra 2 0-0 4, Austin Schulte 1 0-0 2.

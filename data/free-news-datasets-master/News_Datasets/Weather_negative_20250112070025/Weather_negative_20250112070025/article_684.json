(Image: DC) Visakhapatnam: A fresh low-pressure area is developing in the Bay of Bengal, which is expected to bring heavy rainfall to south coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema on December 16 and 17, according to an IMD Amaravati report issued on Friday.\nThe report states that an upper-air cyclonic circulation is likely to form over the south Andaman Sea around December 14 and develop into a low-pressure area within the next 48 hours. This system is expected to move west-northwest towards the Tamil Nadu coast. Currently, the low-pressure area over the Gulf of Mannar and the adjoining Comorin area has shifted over the Lakshadweep and Maldives region. The associated upper-air cyclonic circulation extends up to 5.8 km above mean sea level and is expected to move westward and weaken over the next 24 hours. Over the past 24 hours, several towns in Rayalaseema and south coastal Andhra Pradesh have been hit by heavy rainfall. Sullurpeta (Tirupati) recorded the highest rainfall at 14.3 cm, followed by Tada (Tirupati) with 11.5 cm, Thottambedu (Tirupati) with 10.7 cm, Srikalahasti (Tirupati) with 10.1 cm, Venkatagiri (Tirupati) with 9.6 cm, Koduru (YSR district) with 8.8 cm, Tirupati Airport with 8.3 cm, and Nagari (Chittoor) with 7.3 cm. In south coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rapur (SPSR Nellore district) recorded 9.7 cm. Private weather website Skymet reported that many parts of Tamil Nadu were lashed by heavy to very heavy rains in the past 24 hours. The website also noted a cyclonic circulation over the Southeast Bay of Bengal and South Andaman Sea, which is expected to reach the central parts of South Bay on Saturday and move towards the eastern coast of Sri Lanka on December 15. Another wave of heavy weather activity is expected for Tamil Nadu, it added.\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )",

    "text": "(KIMT) -- Temperatures are forecast to climb above zero Friday, reaching for the mid to upper teens. Some locations in North Iowa could see the low 20s Friday afternoon.\nOur next weather maker is ejecting out of the southern Rockies early Friday morning and is tracking northeastward to the Upper Midwest.\nIn lieu of the system's arrival, Winter Weather Advisories have been issued for all of southeast Minnesota and North Iowa. Advisories will initiate as early as 4 PM Friday afternoon in some of our North Iowa counties with our southeast Minnesota counties following suit at 12 AM Saturday morning. All advisories are slated to expire, at the latest, 6 PM Saturday evening.\nA major driver of the precipitation type with this storm will be the southeast winds that will be strengthening throughout the day Friday. These winds will be pulling in warmer, above-freezing air, to around 5,000 feet up in the atmosphere.\nThis shallow warm layer will force any snow that is falling out of the cloud base at around 10,000 feet to melt at around 5,000 feet as it continues the journey to the surface.\nThis atmospheric profile is the perfect example of freezing rain. Any liquid precipitation that falls out of the shallow warm layer at 5,000 feet will freeze on contact at the surface due to well below freezing temperatures.\nAn initial thump of freezing rain is looking to arrive to our far western counties in North Iowa as early as 10 PM Friday. Precipitation will overspread the region into early Saturday morning.\nDry air could be working into the system, allowing for a brief lull in precipitation for most locations early Saturday morning.\nAs moist air pulls back into the storm, a second burst of freezing rain is looking possible into Saturday evening. A changeover to snow remains possible as the atmospheric column lowers below freezing from the surface up to 10,000 feet due to radiational cooling Saturday evening.\nOn a general scale, there is a high chance of seeing at least 0.10\" of ice accretion in our North Iowa counties with lower chances into southeast Minnesota.\nPer model guidance, some locations could see up to 0.25\" of ice accumulations, although a low chance, with lighter totals in southeast Minnesota. Snow accumulations look to remain around one inch or less.\nStay tuned to the forecast with KIMT StormTeam Three for the latest and most up-to-date information.",

    "text": "The National Weather Service in Des Moines has issued a Winter Weather Advisory across central and northern Iowa. This will go into effect Friday afternoon through Saturday morning. Snow and ice accumulations appear likely, which will create hazardous travel conditions on Saturday. Winter Weather Advisories may be extended to include other parts of eastern Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\nA storm system taking shape over the central Rockies will move into the Midwest on Friday. Ahead of this, temperatures will be warming through the teens and into the 20s for Friday afternoon. The warming will continue overnight and into Saturday as snow and freezing rain move across Iowa, and into Minnesota and Wisconsin. There is potential for much of southern Minnesota and North Iowa to see a glaze of ice, with higher ice accumulations possible across Iowa. Even a light glaze of ice is enough to make roads slick and give vehicles no traction. Please be cautious if you plan to drive on Saturday as the ice and snow move through.\nOur KIMT StormTeam 3 meteorologists are monitoring the track of this storm system and how it may evolve as we get closer to the weekend.",

    "text": "PLACER COUNTY, Calif. — [Stormy conditions](/weather/) on Interstate 80 are causing havoc for drivers who had to sit in traffic for hours after a big rig crash.\nIt started around 1:30 p.m. when traffic was held on westbound I-80 after the crash at Whitmore. Several drivers pulled over at the Nyack exit instead of sitting in the standstill traffic.\n“I was on my way back up to San Francisco for my office holiday party,” said Tom Gump, who was driving from Tahoe. “In a world of back to office, it was going to be a great time to get together and enjoy the holiday season. I cannot believe that we're stuck here not knowing how long it's going to continue and before we're able to go again.”\nGump says it’s not the first time something like that’s happened to him. He was stuck at the same location for about 16 hours four years ago.\n“A big rig that was carrying milk jackknifed (and) dumped all of its milk on the ground and they were treating it as hazardous material that needed to be cleaned up, so I'm cautiously optimistic we're not going to be here 16 hours today,” Gump told [ABC10](/).\n[Caltrans](https://dot.ca.gov/) is expecting the weather to take a break during the day Friday, but snowy conditions could pick up Friday night going into Saturday, and that’s when people could see more accidents or spinouts, so they want drivers to be ready for delays.\n“Just be prepared. You know, pack chains, even if four-wheel drive/all-wheel drive. We recommend that you pack chains just in case and then bring blankets with you. Bring flashlights, make sure your phone is charged. Make sure your gas tank’s full,” said John O’Connell with Caltrans.\nAs a safety precaution, semitruck drivers like Jason Dennis also want people to look out for them when they must chain up.\n“My biggest concern is the cars drive by, and they don't pay attention to the truck drivers, and they come close to hitting us every time we're putting chains on,” said Dennis.\nEarlier Thursday, some drivers were caught off guard by the snow going up the mountain, but they plan to make the most of it. Still, they recommend others check the conditions before hitting the Sierra this weekend.\n“Just slow down, be careful. (It) makes me nervous with the kids,” said Melody Burns.\nCaltrans says anyone coming through the area should check the [QuickMap website](https://quickmap.dot.ca.gov/) or app. It has the latest on chain controls, access to traffic cameras and information about lane closings.\n“Come prepared. Just because you think it may not be, it might be,” said Thomas Burns.",

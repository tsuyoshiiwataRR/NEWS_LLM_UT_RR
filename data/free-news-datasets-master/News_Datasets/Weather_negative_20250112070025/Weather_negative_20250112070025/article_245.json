    "text": "We are First Warning you that ice is a concern on Friday. You don’t need to sweat your drive into work, as it will be dry... but extremely cold. Wind chills may near 6 to start the day, with a biting east breeze up to 25 mph and actual temperatures in the low 20s. The question is, how long will it take for the temperatures to rise above freezing? The longer it takes, the more likely the chance for ice in Kansas City. We currently expect mostly rain in the metro, but it may be a close call, and we want you to be aware any time there is even a chance for ice on the roads. It doesn’t take a lot of ice to cause big issues, and use extra caution on bridges.\nThe window for ice developing in the metro is brief, from just noon to 2 pm. We look to be warm enough to transition to just rain after that. Locations south of the metro are likely to see just rain without any ice.\nIcy roads are a greater concern north of Kansas City, from St. Joseph to Maryville and Chillicothe. These areas north of Kansas City have a likely chance for a light glazing of ice from freezing drizzle or freezing rain Friday from 2 p.m. - midnight.\nThe temperatures actually increase through the night Friday, and we will transition to rain across the entire area by midnight. Showers, even a few thunderstorms will come and go through Saturday morning and early afternoon. We are First Warning you to expect a wet start to the weekend, with rain tapering off by Saturday evening. Highs will be near 50, and there is no threat for wintry weather Saturday.\nSunday is the best-looking day in the forecast with highs near 53 and partly cloudy skies. It will be fine weather for outdoor watch parties of the Chiefs game.\nMonday did have a good chance for rain at one point, but now that system looks to track mostly south of our area. We will get another dose of chilly air behind it, with highs back to the 40s and 30s by the middle of next week.\nCopyright 2024 KCTV. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "By Meteorologist Sven Sundgaard ,\n2 hours ago If you’re dreaming of a White Christmas in the Twin Cities/ southern Minnesota, keep dreaming and cross your fingers and toes. If we pull it off this year, it’s going to be close.\nClimatologically speaking, we have a White Christmas three out of every four years on average. Of course last year we had quite the opposite of a White Christmas, with over an inch of rain and record high temperatures in the 50s.\nIn 2022 we had 10 inches of snow pack, while 2021 was another Brown Christmas. If we look at the past four years, only two were white and the other two brown.\nSign up for our BREAKING WEATHER newsletters\nThe average snow depth, since the year 2000 is four inches on Dec. 25. While the official climatology is a 75% chance of a White Christmas in the Twin Cities using the 1991-2020 average, since 2000 that has dropped to just 67%.\nNWS\nYou guessed it: climate change is a likely culprit as December is one of our fastest warming months in the state.\nThe big climate trend in recent years is that winter still happens, of course, but gets a later start, which impacts your White Christmas.\nThe Christmas forecast Unsplash&plus\nEnough with averages. How about the forecast for the next 12 days?\nIf we look at the National Blend of Models, essentially a weighted average of the models, it gives us a pathetic 0.8 inches of TOTAL snowfall between now and Christmas.\nThat in itself would be enough as \"white\" is defined by an inch of snow cover and we round up with snow measurements to the nearest whole inch, so technically we’d only need half-an-inch to qualify. I know it’s not quite what people would like to play in, but that’s the technical definition.\nWeatherbell\nIf we zoom out to all the models, they range at giving us anywhere from 1 to 2 total inches in a more optimistic scenario.\nThe other forecast challenge though isn’t just snowfall but temperatures. We’ve had some actual cold weather this winter unlike some recent ones, BUT it’s been a roller coaster. Last weekend was 52 degrees and this weekend we could be near 40 on Sunday again, with a -7 degree reading in between!\nIf the European model verifies, we’re in trouble. There are several above freezing days that would easily melt 0.8 inches of snow.\nWeatherbell\nIf the Canadian model is right, keeping things colder, we may just hang on to a half inch of snow to be defined as \"white.\"\nWeatherbell\nWithout going too in depth, my \"back of a napkin\" calculations based on all the models snowfall and all the models temperatures, I put the probability of that 1/2” of snow depth at about 42%.\nBUT, yesterday, that same calculation with different model outputs was between 50% and 68%. Each model run is going to be slightly different.\nIf we REALLY want a White Christmas and ample snow to play in, we need to depend on a surprise storm or rather a surprise shift in a storm track. Even in almost 2025, this still happens which makes forecasting fun and challenging!\nBMTN Note: Weather events in isolation can't always be pinned on climate change, but the broader trend of increasingly severe weather and record-breaking extremes seen in Minnesota and across the globe can be attributed directly to the rapidly warming climate caused by human activity. The IPCC has warned that Earth is \"firmly on track toward an unlivable world,\" and says greenhouse gas emissions must be halved by 2030 in order to limit warming to 1.5C, which would prevent the most catastrophic effects on humankind.

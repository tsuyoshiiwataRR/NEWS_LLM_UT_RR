    "text": "Recommended Stories\nOdisha is experiencing an increasing chill and a sharp decline in temperature, signalling the arrival of winter across the state, albeit a bit late than in previous years. Mercury has begun to plummet with minimum night temperature falling below the normal in several regions.\nDespite the late onset, the chilling cold is gradually intensifying. In the coming days, temperatures in interior districts could reach as low as 9 degrees Celsius. Moreover, urban areas are also expected to see the mercury dip below 15 degrees Celsius.\nThe\nIndia Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that temperatures will remain relatively stable over the next week, with predominantly dry conditions likely. The IMD has also forecast an increase in fog across various parts of the state over the next two days.\nAlso Read:\nOdisha braces for cold wave as mercury to dip further by 2-4 degree Celsius\nFor today, various districts, including Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, Bargarh, Ganjam, Kandhamal, Kalahandi, and Koraput, are anticipated to experience mild to moderate fog, according to the IMD. The Twin City, Bhubaneswar and Cuttack also woke up to chilling cold on Friday morning.\nAfter a warmer start to the month, people across the state are finally feeling the chill.

    "text": "WELLINGTON COUNTY â€” Residents should expect several municipal service interruptions due to heavy snowfall in the northern parts of Wellington County.\nAccording to the County of Wellington website, the county's northern library branches in Arthur, Mount Forest, Clifford, Harriston, Palmerston and Drayton closed Thursday at 3 p.m. due to ongoing weather.\nSolid waste services waste facilities in Harriston, Riverstown and Elora closed at 2:30 p.m. and roll-off trucks have been pulled from the roads. Curbside collection in Wellington North is postponed until Saturday.\nThe Wellington County Archives and municipal offices in Minto, Mapleton and Wellington North are also currently closed due to weather. The Wellington County Museum remains open.\nThe Erin Hillsburgh Recycling App said further curbside collection in Erin is also postponed until Saturday due to \"deteriorating\" road and weather conditions. Anyone who did not receive service today is asked to have materials out for 7 a.m.\nWellington OPP is advising all motorists to stay off the roads.\nHave photos of the wintry weather?

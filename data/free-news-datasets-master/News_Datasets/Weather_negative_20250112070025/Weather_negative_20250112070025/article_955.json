    "text": "First Alert: Freezing rain to impact parts of the Tri-States\nQUINCY (WGEM) - As the clock continues ticking this evening, chances of rain will begin to increase across the Tri-States. Though, not just rain, but freezing rain will impact portions of the northern areas of the region. We are under First Alert as Scotland and Clark counties in Missouri, Lee County, Iowa, and Schuyler, Hancock and McDonough counties in Illinois are under a winter weather advisory for freezing rain accumulations up to two tenths of an inch. This advisory goes into effect at midnight and lasts through 9am Saturday morning. This will make travel difficult heading North, so take precautions as needed.\nThe central and southern portions of the Tri-States will mostly see rain, and it will last though the night into Saturday afternoon. Up to an inch and a half of rain is possible through tomorrow afternoon, before we clear out for Saturday night. Temperatures will not drop off much into the night time, and slowly warm into Saturday morning. A warm front will slowly track North into the Tri-States by Saturday evening, which will help us climb into the mid-40′s. Then, another warm front will move through on Sunday afternoon, pushing our temperatures into the 50′s overnight into early Monday morning. The chance of showers also return to the Tri-States Sunday night into Monday morning, as a cold front will push through the region giving us a slight chance for embedded thunderstorms. This cold front will drop our overnight low temperatures back into the upper-20′s to around 30°.\nThrough the remainder of the week, temperatures will continue to fall, as highs will be back into the 40′s for Tuesday, with lows around 30° again. Then, by Wednesday we are back into the 30′s during the day with lows into the upper-teens and low-20′s which will remain in play the rest of the week.\nCopyright 2024 WGEM. All rights reserved.",

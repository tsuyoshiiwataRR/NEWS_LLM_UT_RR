    "text": "First Alert Weather Day continues Friday east | Heavy snow risk remains\nHeavy lake effect snow bands to impact travel through Friday noon in the Eastern U.P. -- plus frigid start to Friday plus inland west lows in the -10s.\nNWS alerts in effect [HERE](https://www.uppermichiganssource.com/weather/alerts/).\nLake effect snow continues to fall with moderate and heavy intensity in the west wind snow belts of the Northwestern and Eastern U.P. Accumulating snow, potential whiteout conditions persist until the bands of heavy snow taper and lift north of the region Friday -- spreading sunshine over a cold end to the work and school week.\nHigh pressure builds across the region this weekend, with max temperatures trending above freezing this weekend. The high system keeps snow chances light Saturday night-early Sunday, before an incoming Northern Plains system spreads rain then the messy mix of freezing rain, sleet and wet snow early next week.\nTonight: Partly to mostly cloudy with moderate to heavy snow in the west wind snow belts of the Northwestern and Eastern U.P.; areas of blowing snow; blustery\n>Lows: -10s to 10s (coldest interior west)\nFriday: Gradual clearing with snow tapering and lifting north towards afternoon; cold\n>Highs: 10s/20\nSaturday: Mostly cloudy towards evening with scattered light rain and snow\n>Highs: 30\nSunday: Mostly cloudy early with scattered light rain and snow; sunnier towards afternoon\n>Highs: 30s/40\nMonday: Mostly cloudy with scattered rain, then freezing rain/sleet/wet snow in the evening; windy\n>Highs: 30s/40\nTuesday: Mostly cloudy with scattered snow; windy\n>Highs: 30\nWednesday: Partly to mostly cloudy with snow tapering\n>Highs: 20s\nThursday: Mostly cloudy with scattered snow; windy and colder\n>Highs: 20\nCopyright 2024 WLUC.

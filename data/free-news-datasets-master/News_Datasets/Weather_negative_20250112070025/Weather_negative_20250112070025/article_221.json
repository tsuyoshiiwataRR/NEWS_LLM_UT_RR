    "text": "Rain continues to lash Tamil Nadu, schools shut today in eight districts\nAs the well-marked low pressure area in southwest Bay of Bengal is likely to continue moving west-northwest towards South Tamil Nadu, intense rainfall activity is predicted to shift to southern Tamil Nadu, as well as parts of Western Ghats.\nAs the well-marked low pressure area in southwest Bay of Bengal is likely to continue moving west-northwest towards South Tamil Nadu, intense rainfall activity is predicted to shift to southern Tamil Nadu, as well as parts of Western Ghat.\nBased on this heavy rainfall forecast, along with a spell of rain on Friday morning, a holiday has been declared today in schools in eight districts of Tamil Nadu: Dharmapuri, Karur, Cuddalore, Mayiladuthurai, Pudukottai, Namakkal, Tiruchi, Thanjavur and Tirunelveli, as well as in Puducherry.\nAccording to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the well-marked low pressure area in the Bay of Bengal could weaken into a low pressure area in the next 24 hours. However, its movement in the region could bring heavy rainfall in parts of southern Tamil Nadu as well as Western Ghats districts.\nMeanwhile, the official handle of IMD Tamil Nadu, posted the rainfall report of the state on X.\nThe rainfall report showed Mayiladuthurai and Tirunelveli district received the highest rainfall in the state between Thursday and Friday.\nThe X handle ‘Tamil Nadu Weatherman’ also stated in a post that it was the “heaviest day to Tamil Nadu monsoon in a long time”.\nRainfall will continue in parts of Tamil Nadu over the next week, as the IMD observed another weather system building near Andaman and Nicobar Islands.",

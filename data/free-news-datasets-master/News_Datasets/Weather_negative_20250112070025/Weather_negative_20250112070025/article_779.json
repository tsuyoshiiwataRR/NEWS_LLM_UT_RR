    "text": "By Adam Uren ,\n8 hours ago\nA winter weather advisory has been issued for the Twin Cities and southern Minnesota ahead of a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain that is expected to make travel conditions challenging on Saturday morning.\nThe wintry mix of precipitation will arrive from the south late Friday evening and move slowly north, turning into freezing drizzle Saturday morning and continuing through the afternoon.\nNo more than an inch of snow is expected to fall in the affected areas, including the Twin Cities, but the main risk is the freezing rain, which is expected to leave an 0.1 inch layer of glaze ice across southern Minnesota, including potentially the Twin Cities.\nSign up for our BREAKING WEATHER newsletters\nNWS Twin Cities\nThe winter weather advisory goes into effect at midnight and continues through 6 p.m. The area covers the southern third of the state, with the NWS saying glare ice could create \"very hazardous\" conditions on untreated roads.\n\"Tonight, light precipitation will move into southern Minnesota and spread into central and eastern MN by sunrise Saturday,\" the weather advisory reads. \"A mix of snow and sleet is expected initially, but it will transition to a mix of freezing rain and snow through Saturday morning.\"\nDrivers are advised to exercise extreme caution when driving in freezing rain.\nNWS Twin Cities\n12",

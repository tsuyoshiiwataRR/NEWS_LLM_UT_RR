WELL, IT’S A LITTLE CLOUDY OUT THERE AND IT’S STILL QUITE COLD, SO MAKE SURE YOU’RE JUST PREPARED FOR THAT DURING YOUR LUNCH TIME HOUR. THEN MAYBE YOU WANT TO GET OUT AND ABOUT FOR LUNCH. JUST MAKE SURE YOU BUNDLE UP AS IT IS STILL QUITE COLD OUT THERE. WE DON’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANY WET WEATHER FOR THIS AFTERNOON, FOR TODAY, AND REALLY TO START OF OUR WEEKEND IS GOING TO BE DRY. JUST VERY COLD AND CHILLY. SO WE’RE STILL LOOKING AT 30S ACROSS THE STATE, LOOKING AT 35 FOR BWI MARSHALL, 38 DOWNTOWN, 33, IN ELLICOTT CITY, 34 IN FREDERICK, THE 30S AND EVEN THE 20S OUT IN WESTERN MARYLAND. AND A FEW SPOTS ARE TRYING TO MAKE THEIR WAY INTO THE 40S ON THE EASTERN SHORE. WE ARE GOING TO SEE TEMPERATURES WARM UP TO THE UPPER 30S TO LOW 40S HERE IN THE BALTIMORE METRO. AGAIN, CLOUDS WILL BE STICKING AROUND, ALTHOUGH YOU MAY SEE A PEEK OF SUN HERE AND THERE. BUT MOVING INTO THE EVENING HOURS MAINLY MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES, IT IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER CHILLY EVENING. SO IF YOU HAVE PLANS TO GO SEE SOME FESTIVITIES, SOME OF THE HOLIDAY FESTIVITIES AND LIGHTS ACROSS THE STATE, I WOULD JUST PREPARE FOR TEMPERATURES IN THE 20S. THAT’S WHAT IT’S GOING TO FEEL LIKE OUT THERE, AS IT IS GOING TO BE COLD AND THERE IS A LIGHT BREEZE OUT THERE NOW MOVING IN AND THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND, STARTING WITH SATURDAY, WE’RE GOING TO BE UNDER SUNNY SKIES. THOSE TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN THE UPPER 30S AND WE ARE GOING TO SEE THOSE TEMPERATURES IN THE 40S FOR SUNDAY. MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES WHERE THE RAVENS WILL BE. THEY’RE NOT GOING TO BE HERE AT HOME. IT’S GOING TO BE GAME DAY IN NEW YORK. KICKOFF WILL BE AT 1 P.M. TEMPERATURES AGAIN WILL BE IN THE 40S UNDER CLOUDY SKIES HERE. BACK AT HOME. IF YOU HAVE PLANS TO WATCH THE GAME, JUST BE READY FOR SOME RAIN LATER IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS AS THAT RAIN WILL BE MOVING IN FROM THE WEST, STARTING OFF AS SNOW SHOWERS FOR WESTERN MARYLAND. BUT YOU SEE, IT’S GOING TO BE A RAIN EVENT FOR US HERE IN THE BALTIMORE METRO. AND THAT’S REALLY GOING TO CONTINUE INTO OUR MONDAY AS WELL. SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE’RE STARTING OUR NEW WORK ON A SOGGY NOTE WITH WITH THE PERCENTAGE UP TO 60 THERE ON MONDAY, 51 WILL BE THE TEMPERATURE. SO IT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT ON THE MILD SIDE, ESPECIALLY AS WE MOVE INTO TUESDAY. WEDNESDAY SEEMS TO BE A DRIER DAY, BUT WE’LL COOL D\nAdvertisement\n'Feels like' temps dip to 20s overnight in Maryland\nMeteorologist Dalencia Jenkins explains how the \"feels like\" temperatures dip to 20s overnight in Maryland, starting the weekend off chilly.\nBALTIMORE —\nMeteorologist Dalencia Jenkins explains how the \"feels like\" temperatures dip to 20s overnight in Maryland, starting the weekend off chilly.\nAdvertisement",

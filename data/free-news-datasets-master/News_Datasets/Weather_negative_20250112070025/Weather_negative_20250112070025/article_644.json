    "text": "CLEARFIELD — High winds, snow squalls and ice made for a treacherous commute for those around the area early Thursday morning and there were an abundance of accidents.\nMultiple accidents took place Thursday morning, with Interstate 80 being one of the biggest issues that in turn compounded traffic congestion elsewhere.\nOn Interstate 80 specifically, Timothy Nebgen, press officer for the state Department of Transportation District 2-0 office, said a 45 miles-per-hour speed limit restriction was implemented between the Penfield (mile marker 111) and Kylertown (133) exits shortly before 4 a.m. Thursday — that was then extended to the Bellefonte (161) exit.\nThe westbound lanes of I-80 were closed between the Kylertown (133) and Clearfield-Shawville (120) exits at approximately 5:30 a.m. following multiple crashes in that area.\nAccording to various fire company social media posts, assisting those at the accident scenes Thursday included Bigler-Jackson-Woodland Fire Company, Clearfield Fire Dept., Hyde Fire Co., Lawrence Twp. Fire Co., Morris Twp. Fire Co., Winburne Fire Co. and Grassflat Fire Co.\nNebgen said a detour was then used featuring state Route 53, SR 2030 — also known as the Allport Cutoff, and U.S. Route 322.\n“A secondary crash within the detour route then led to delays and significant traffic backlogs as traffic tried to reconnect with I-80 at the Clearfield-Shawville interchange,” Nebgen said.\nOne lane was then opened back up on the westbound lane around 7:30 a.m. and as of 4 p.m. Thursday, it was still restricted to a single lane as Nebgen stated recovery operations continued. Speed limit restrictions were then lifted at 9 a.m.\nArea school districts of Clearfield, Philipsburg-Osceola, West Branch and Moshannon Valley started out with two-hour delays. However, all but Mo Valley then closed.\nWest Branch, located on the Allport Cutoff, posted on its Facebook page that, at the time of announcing the school closure, traffic was backed up from its building to the Bigler intersection — a stretch of highway a little over five miles long.\nNebgen also stated PennDOT offers the following advice if motorists must travel and they encounter snow squalls, blowing or drifting snow.\n- Slow down gradually and drive at a speed that suits conditions.\n- Turn on your headlights. If caught in a snow squall, turn on your hazard lights.\n- Stay in your lane and increase your following distance.\n- Stay alert, keep looking as far ahead as possible and be patient.\n- Do not drive distracted; your full attention is required.\n- Use your defroster and wipers.\n- Keep windows and mirrors free of snow and ice.\n- During whiteouts, come to a complete stop only when you can safely pull off the roadway.\n- Do not stop in the flow of traffic since this could cause a chain-reaction collision.\n- Do not pass a vehicle moving slowly or speed up to get away from a vehicle that is following too closely.\n- Always buckle up and never drive impaired.\nMotorists are also reminded that if a crash occurs due to or during a snow squall and they are involved or stopped due to the crash:\n- In most cases, you are safer in your vehicle with seat belts fastened.\n- If possible, drive slowly to the front of the pileup and get off travel lanes.\n- If you must leave your car for an emergency, try to wait until it looks safe.\n- Do not stand outside your vehicle on or near the roadway.",

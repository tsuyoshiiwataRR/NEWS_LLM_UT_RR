    "text": "By Tom Puckett ,\n4 hours ago\nBuffalo, N.Y. (WBEN) - Driving in lake effect snow is a challenge for any passenger vehicle, but it was also a challenge for those driving vehicles meant to go through the snow. In fact, Erie County's Department of Public Works Commissioner was stuck while clearing snow from the roads on Thursday.\nBill Geary tells WBEN the Evans/Lake View/Hamburg/Eden area was supposed to see snow rates of 1-to-2 inches an hour, but instead exceeded three inches an hour, and some even localized heavy bursts beyond the three inch an hour rate.\nThat made it a challenge for his crews, especially one driver in particular.\n\"One of our trucks in the dark and low-lit areas got on the side of the road and ended up in the ditch. That really hampered some of our operations,\" said Geary on Thursday. \"We were able to pivot and put another truck on that route to kind of keep up with it.\"\nEven Geary had an adventure himself.\n\"I went down on my way after checking on our driver and the truck that was in the ditch, I proceeded up to Eden-Evans Center Road, going down Route 20, and it was in that time period where you're seeing greater than three inches an hour. I had to avoid a vehicle coming at me,\" Geary said. \"I got over on the shoulder road, not quite in the ditch, but enough that my truck got hung up and stuck for a little while.\"\nGeary says he managed to get himself unstuck.\nBoth Geary and the other driver are OK.\nBe the first to react",

Here’s what to expect where you live. By Bryce Luff Western Australia ’s scorching start to summer is set to be felt right across the country, with Victoria to sweat through one of its hottest days in years.\nThe heat impacting WA will soon move southeast, “building and peaking across South Australia on Sunday”, the Bureau of Meteorology said.\nIt will then reach Victoria and inland NSW on Monday.\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n“Max temps will be up to 14C above average, reaching high-30s to high 40s across some areas,” the bureau said.\nVictoria has been tipped to record one of its hottest days in years, with Melbourne forecast to reach 41C, it’s hottest day since 2020, and regional areas hitting 45C.\nWilcannia and Ivanhoe in inland NSW have forecast maximums of 48C, while Moomba in South Australia could top 45C.\nSummer swelter “South Australia’s looking at very hot conditions on Sunday and Sunday night, as northerly winds strengthen ahead of a cooler southerly change on Monday,” 7NEWS weather presenter Amelia Mulcahy said.\n“Adelaide’s hottest day this week will be on Sunday with a top of 40C forecast.\n“The temperature could hit 42C in Adelaide’s northern suburbs while in the regions conditions will be at their hottest in SA’s east, with Renmark in the Riverland looking at a top of 44C on Monday and Moomba in the state’s north-east is expecting a top of 46C on Monday too.\n“But what will make this burst of heat most uncomfortable in SA is that there will be little relief at night.\n“Adelaide isn’t likely to drop below a minimum 27C overnight into Monday. To put that in perspective, Adelaide’s average maximum temperature for December is 26.9C.”\nMelbourne residents are set to sweat through the city’s hottest day in years. Credit: James Ross / AAP Bureau meteorologist Jonathan How said the main story this weekend is “all about the heat”, explaining it is being driven by an “area of high pressure sitting to the south and east of the country”.\n“We’ll start to see those winds turn northerly and that will bring some very hot air down towards the centre and southeast of the country so this will drive both heatwave conditions and elevated fire dangers,” How said.\n“We’ll see the heat peak across South Australia on Sunday and then across Victoria and inland NSW on Monday.”\nMulcahy said a cool change will eventually be delivered to Adelaide on Monday.\n“That change won’t reach Melbourne until night, with the city set to swelter through it’s hottest day since 2020 with a forecast top of 41C on Monday, first.”\nMelbourne could be about to sweat through its hottest day in years.

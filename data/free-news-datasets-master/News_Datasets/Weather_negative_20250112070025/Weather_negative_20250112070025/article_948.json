    "text": "The National Weather Service anticipates freezing rain will hit the Omaha area between 5 and 6 p.m. Friday night Drivers should expect roads to start to get slick by 7 or 8 p.m., though timing could depend on how temperatures fluctuate throughout the day, according to Clint Aegerter, a meteorologist with the weather service's office in Valley. As precipitation continues, the highest ice accumulations will be possible overnight. Omaha is expected to get between 0.1 to .25 of an inch of ice accumulation, according to the weather service. Some sleet may work its way into the precipitation at points, but snow is unlikely, Aegerter said. As temperatures warm, the precipitation is expected to transition to rain around 3 or 4 a.m. Saturday. The weather service warned that, given cold road temperatures, ice may stick even after air temperatures climb above freezing. People are also readingâ€¦ Aegerter encouraged anyone planning to be out and about Friday evening to check road conditions before they hit the road and drive cautiously, especially on bridges and on-ramps. \"If you are going out, take it slow,\" he said. \"Roads that look wet could be a sheet of ice, basically.\" Weather-related closures and cancellations Citing the potential for icy road conditions, some organizations have canceled services and events. Offutt Air Force base has authorized an early releases of non mission-essential personnel starting at 2 p.m. The Omaha Public Power District's walk-in customer service center at Energy Plaza will close at 4 p.m. All Boys and Girls Club of the Midlands locations will close at 6 p.m. The Rose Theater has cancelled its 7 p.m. performance of \"A Christmas Story.\" Metro Transit will move 13 of its bus routes to Snow Route Option A starting at 5 p.m. Friday. The same routes will also begin on Snow Route Option A Saturday and are expected to stay on the modified route until at least 9 a.m. The routes affected include routes 3, 5, 8, 11, 13, 14, 24, 26, 30, 35, 36, 55 and 120. Riders will get at least a 2-hour notice before any changes are made, according to Metro. More information is available at ometro.com",

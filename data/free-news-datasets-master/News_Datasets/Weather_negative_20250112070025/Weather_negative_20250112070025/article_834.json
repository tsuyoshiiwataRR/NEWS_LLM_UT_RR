    "text": "The National Weather Service issued an updated coastal flood advisory at 10:49 a.m. on Friday valid for Saturday between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. for Clatsop County Coast and Tillamook County Coast.\n\"Tidal overflow flooding expected,\" adds the weather service. \"Tides are expected to peak around 11 a.m. Saturday. Toke Point tidal gauge is expected to peak around 12.2 feet, Tongue Point tidal gauge is expected to peak around 11.3 feet, and Garibaldi tidal gauge is expected to peak around 10.7 feet.\"\n\"Minor flooding, up to one foot above ground level, during high tides is expected in the low-lying areas near bays, sloughs, and the lower reaches of the coastal rivers,\" describes the weather service. \"A Coastal Flood Advisory means that tidal overflow flooding is expected. Coastal residents in the warned area should be alert for rising water, and take appropriate action to protect life and property.\"\nBreaking down weather alerts: advisories, watches, and warnings\n- Flash flood warning: Take action!\nA flash flood warning is issued when a flash flood is imminent or occurring. If you are in a flood-prone area, move immediately to high ground. A flash flood is a sudden violent flood that can take from minutes to hours to develop. It is even possible to experience a flash flood in areas not immediately receiving rain.\n- Flood warning: Take action!\nA flood warning is issued when flooding is imminent or occurring.\n- Flood advisory: Be aware:\nA flood advisory is issued when flooding is not expected to be bad enough to issue a warning. However, it may cause significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised, it could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property.\n- Flood watch: Be prepared:\nA flood watch is issued when conditions are favorable for flooding. It does not mean flooding will occur, but it is possible.\nWhen floods strike: Guidelines from the weather service for your protection\nFloods can pose a significant threat, especially if you live in a flood-prone area or find yourself camping in a low-lying region. To ensure your safety, the weather service offers essential flood safety guidelines:\nMove to higher ground:\nIf you're in a flood-prone area, or if you're camping in a low-lying spot, move to higher ground as a first step.\nAdhere to evacuation orders:\nIf local authorities issue an evacuation order, heed it promptly. Prior to leaving, secure your home by locking it.\nDisconnect utilities and appliances:\nIf time allows, disconnect your utilities and appliances. This reduces the risk of electrical hazards during flooding.\nAvoid basements and submerged areas:\nSteer clear of basements or rooms where water has submerged electrical outlets or cords. This helps prevent electrical accidents.\nEvacuate promptly for safety:\nIf you notice sparks or hear buzzing, crackling, snapping, or popping noises, evacuate immediately. Avoid any water that may be charged with electricity.\nStay away from floodwaters:\nNever attempt to walk through floodwaters, even if they appear shallow. Just 6 inches of fast-moving water can forcefully sweep you off your feet.\nSeek high ground if trapped:\nShould you become trapped by moving water, reach the highest point possible and dial 911 to contact emergency services.\nDuring heavy rainfall, the risk of flooding is heightened, especially in low-lying and flood-prone regions. Always remember never to drive through water on the road, no matter how shallow it appears. According to the weather service, as little as 12 inches of rapidly flowing water can carry away most vehicles. Prioritize your safety by staying informed and prepared.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.",

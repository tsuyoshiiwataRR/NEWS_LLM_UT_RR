    "text": "CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa â€” An ice storm is headed Eastern Iowa and it's best to get out in front of it and make sure you're prepared.\n[The National Weather Service recommends](https://www.weather.gov/safety/winter-before) stocking up with supplies you may need like flashlights or a generator incase you lose power.\nVernon Village True Value Manager said putting salt down outside your house, ahead of the storm, is a good idea and keeping some near the entrances can help in case of emergencies.\n\"If you know ice is coming, if you put it down ahead of time, it does help release that a lot easier,\" Phil Cronin the store manager at Vernon Village True Value said. \"If heavy ice is expected you might want to get a ice chopper. Shovels tend to curl if you start banging on them like a chopper. If you don't have good traction you probably want to get some tube sand. Tube sand will work as weight to help you with traction but also if you do get stuck you can open it up and put it under your tires and help get some traction to help get outta your jam.\"\nIf you are putting ice melt out you may want to check what type of ice melt you're buying, if you have pets, since not all ice melt is safe for animals.\nExperts also say its best to stay off the roads but it's smart to go ahead and keep a winter storm survival kit in your car with things like a first-aid kid, food and water, phone charges and winter gear to keep you warm.",

    "text": "The World Meteorological Association (WMO) has warned of a possible La Niña phenomenon in the ⁣coming winter season.\nAs Day.Az ‍reports, ⁣citing foreign sources, the probability of⁤ La Niña conditions occurring between December​ 2024 and February 2025 is⁢ estimated at 55%.\nWMO Secretary General Celeste Saulo noted that‌ despite the record​ heat caused by El‍ Niño, La Niña will not be able to fully offset​ the​ effects⁤ of global warming. ‌Saulo also ⁤highlighted the rise in extreme weather events such ‍as‌ record rainfall,flooding and severe⁢ storms due to‌ climate⁢ change.\nTurkish Academy of Sciences Professor Doğan Yaşar ​said the US National Oceanic​ and Atmospheric Management⁢ (NOAA) is predicting a severe winter. He added that nature ⁤strives for balance, alternating periods of ​heat and ⁣cold.\nExperts ⁢recalled that rare weather events have been observed in⁢ recent years,including severe flooding and record rainfall. forecasts indicate that the ‌coming winter could be one of the ‍coldest in 50-60 years.\nHow can communities prepare for possible severe weather conditions caused by La Niña​ and climate change? Interview with Professor Doğan Yaşar on the Upcoming La Niña Winter\nTime.news Editor : thank you for joining us today, Professor Yaşar.‌ We are hearing‌ significant concerns regarding the possibility of a La Niña phenomenon this winter.Can you explain what La ​Niña is and how it diverges from its ‌counterpart, El Niño?\nProfessor Doğan Yaşar : Certainly, and thank you for having me. La Niña is‍ a climate pattern ⁤characterized by⁢ cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in ⁢the central and ⁣eastern Pacific Ocean. It ‌often leads to various global weather impacts, typically resulting in wetter conditions ‌in some regions ⁤and drier conditions in⁤ others. In contrast, El niño brings warmer sea surface ​temperatures, ‌causing ⁤diffrent and ​often extreme weather patterns, including record heat.\nTime.news Editor : The World Meteorological Association has estimated a 55%‌ probability of La Niña conditions occurring between December 2024 and February 2025. How⁢ significant ⁤is this prediction for the upcoming winter season?\nProfessor Doğan Yaşar : This is quite significant. A‍ potential La ‍Niña coupled with the current record heat from‍ El⁢ Niño indicates that we might experience a contrasting winter⁤ season. ⁣While La Niña may cool certain areas, it will not counterbalance the overarching‍ effects of global warming. We must remember that global warming ‌exacerbates extreme ​weather conditions, wich we are already witnessing through severe storms and flooding around the world.\nTime.news Editor : Speaking of extreme weather, WMO Secretary-General⁤ Celeste ​Saulo mentioned a rise in such events due to climate change. How do you ‍see this affecting communities this winter?\nProfessor Doğan Yaşar : Communities⁢ should prepare for ​fluctuations in weather ⁢patterns this⁣ winter. We could ⁣face one of the coldest ​winters in 50 to 60 years alongside ⁢the potential for intense storms due to climate change. Areas that typically experience mild winters ⁣might suddenly encounter severe cold ⁤spells, leading ‌to challenges in infrastructure and daily life.⁤\nTime.news Editor : What practical advice can you provide⁤ to individuals and communities in gearing up for this possibly severe ‍winter?\nProfessor Doğan Yaşar : First, ⁤it’s ⁣important to ⁢stay informed through reliable weather⁣ forecasts and updates. local authorities may implement winter preparedness plans, and citizens should heed those announcements. Stocking up on essential supplies and having an emergency plan in place ⁢can​ definitely‌ help mitigate the impact of severe weather. Additionally, individuals should consider insulating their homes and ​ensuring⁣ their heating systems⁣ are in working order to handle potential drops in temperature.\nTime.news Editor : As an expert on climate phenomena,what systematic measures do you think policymakers should consider in light ​of these predictions and climate change overall?\nprofessor Doğan Yaşar : Policymakers need to prioritize resilience in infrastructure to better withstand extreme conditions.Investments in⁣ climate ‍adaptation strategies—like improved drainage systems to handle increased⁢ rainfall and flood risks—are essential. Additionally, fostering public awareness about ⁢climate change can⁢ encourage preparedness and ‍sustainable practices⁣ within communities. This holistic approach will not only address the immediate impacts of la Niña but ​also help manage the long-term challenges of the climate crisis we face globally.\nTime.news Editor : Thank you, Professor‍ Yaşar, for your⁣ invaluable ⁤insights. As we brace for what’s ‍projected ⁢to‌ be a challenging winter ahead, it’s crucial that we understand both ⁣the ​science behind ‌these ‌phenomena and ⁢the steps we can take to adapt.\nProfessor Doğan⁣ Yaşar : Thank you for the opportunity⁢ to share​ this vital data. Staying informed and proactive is our best strategy in facing these climatic challenges.",

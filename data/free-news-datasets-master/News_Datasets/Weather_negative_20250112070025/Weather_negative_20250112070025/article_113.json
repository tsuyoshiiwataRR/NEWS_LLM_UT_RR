    "text": "13 Dec 2024 | 12:57 AM UTC\nNew Zealand: Severe weather forecast to continue across western and central parts of South Island through at least Dec. 14\nAdverse weather forecast over parts of southwestern New Zealand through at least Dec. 14. Flooding and associated disruptions possible.\nSevere weather is forecast to continue across central and western parts of South Island through at least Dec. 14. An active front, preceded by strong northwesterlies, is forecast to track north over the South Island late Dec. 13-14, bringing heavy rain to western areas. The heavy downpours may trigger flooding in low-lying areas and landslides on unstable slopes.\nAs of early Dec. 13, the New Zealand National Meteorological Service (MetService) has issued the following weather warnings across the affected area:\nOrange Heavy Rain Warning (the middle level on a three-tier scale): The lakes and headwaters of Canterbury High Country south of about the Rangitata River and the ranges of the Westland District. Maximum rainfall of up to 15-20 cm (6-8 inches) is forecast.\nYellow Strong Wind Watch: Canterbury High Country.\nAuthorities will likely issue new alerts or update/rescind existing advisories as weather conditions change over the coming days.\nSustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed stormwater drainage systems. Sites downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly or mountainous areas, especially where heavy rain has saturated the soil.\nAuthorities could issue mandatory evacuation orders for flood-prone communities over the coming hours. Where significant flooding or landslides impact utility networks, disruptions to electricity and telecommunications services are possible.\nFloodwaters and debris flows could render some bridges, rail networks, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces may cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities may temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. Severe weather could trigger flight delays and cancellations at regional airports. Flooding may block regional rail lines; freight and passenger train delays and cancellations are possible in areas with heavy rainfall and potential track inundation.\nLocalized business disruptions may occur in low-lying areas; some businesses might not operate at full capacity because of flood damage to facilities, possible evacuations, and some employees' inability to reach work sites.\nMonitor local media for weather updates and related advisories. Confirm all transport reservations and business appointments before travel. Make allowances for potential localized travel delays and supply chain disruptions where flooding has been forecast. Do not drive on flooded roads. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

A FIRST ALERT WEATHER IMPACT DAY, KIND OF A12 PUNCH. WE HAVE THE COLD RIGHT NOW, NICK, AND THEN WE HAVE THE RAIN. AND IT’S ALL ABOUT WHEN DO THE TEMPERATURES CLIMB ABOVE FREEZING IN THE RAIN BEGINS? YOU KNOW WHERE THOSE TWO COINCIDE? THAT’S WHERE WE’LL FIND THE FREEZING DRIZZLE AND RAIN. AND THAT IS ACROSS FAR NORTHERN MISSOURI AND NORTHEASTERN KANSAS. LATE THIS AFTERNOON. THROUGH TONIGHT, FREEZING DRIZZLE, FREEZING RAIN IS POSSIBLE AND THAT MAY LEAD TO ICY ROADS FARTHER SOUTH. HERE IN KANSAS CITY, THERE COULD BE A NARROW WINDOW OF TIME EARLY THIS AFTERNOON WHEN TEMPERATURES ARE JUST STARTING TO CLIMB ABOVE FREEZING AND DRIZZLE BEGINS WHERE THERE MAY BE A FEW ICY SPOTS ACROSS THE NORTHLAND. SO YOU LOOK AT THE 12 HOUR FORECAST FOR TODAY IN KANSAS CITY BETWEEN NOON AND TWO. TEMPERATURES CLIMB ABOVE FREEZING AS A CHANCE OF DRIZZLE BEGINS, SO I CAN’T RULE OUT A SLICK SPOT, BUT THAT WILL BE NEGATED BY TEMPERATURES QUICKLY CLIMBING ABOVE FREEZING FOR THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON AND THE EVENING. SO IF YOU HAVE EATING PLANS IN KANSAS CITY, YOU NEED YOUR WARM RAIN GEAR. BUT I DON’T THINK WE’RE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH WIDESPREAD ICY ROADS HERE IN KANSAS CITY. NOW, IF YOU TRAVEL A COUPLE OF COUNTIES NORTH, YOU GET UP TO SAINT JOE, YOU UP TO ATCHISON, YOU GET UP TO CAMERON, YOU GET UP TO CHILLICOTHE. NOW THERE’S A POSSIBILITY OF SOME SLICK SPOTS ON THE ROADS FOR LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT. TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO CLIMB ABOVE FREEZING OVERNIGHT INTO SATURDAY MORNING. NO ICY IMPACTS EXPECTED ON SATURDAY, BUT DO PLAN ON RAINY ONES SATURDAY MORNING. FUTURESCAN SHOWING WIDESPREAD RAIN SHOWERS, ESPECIALLY OVER ON THE MISSOURI SIDE THROUGH ALL OF SATURDAY MORNING ENDING EARLY SATURDAY AFTERNOON. AND THERE MIGHT BE JUST ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR A FEW RUMBLES OF THUNDER. DECEMBER THUNDER SUNDAY DRY. MOSTLY SUNNY, 54 DEGREES. MUCH WARMER FOR THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. JUST A SLIM CHANCE OF RAIN. SHOWER SOUTHEAST OF KANSAS CITY ON MONDAY AND THEN MUCH COLDER AIR DOES BUILD IN FOR THE END OF THE WEEK. NO RAIN OR SNOW CHANCES WITH THAT COLD, BUT HIGHS WILL FALL INTO THE 30S. WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY INTO THE FOLLOWING WEEKEND, SO IT’S GOING TO GET COLD AGAIN. SO THE TEMPERATURE SWINGS CONTINUE. FREEZING DRIZZLE THIS AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT, ESPECIALLY TONIGHT ACROSS NORTHERN MISSOURI. SLICK TRAVEL CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE. ONE 36 HIGHWAY TRENTON OVER TO MARYVILLE I-29, ROCKPORT, FAIRFAX, TARKIO AND THEN FARTHER TO THE SOUTH, A CHANCE OF FREEZING DRIZZLE. ATCHISON LEAVENWORTH. SAINT JOE CAMERON, CHILLICOTHE TEMPERATURES RISING ABOVE FREEZING IN TIME FOR THE RAIN TO REMAIN LIQUID WHEN IT HIT\nAdvertisement\nFreezing drizzle may mean icy roads for parts of the viewing area\nWe'll be monitoring temperatures midday for impacts to the immediate metro area.\nAdvertisement",

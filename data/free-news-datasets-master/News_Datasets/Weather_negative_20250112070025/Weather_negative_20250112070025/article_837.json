    "text": "By Sadie Dittenber ,\n1 hours ago\nA storm surge could make for hazardous beach conditions this weekend.\nHigh tides coupled with large waves could bring minor tidal overflow and coastal flooding to the beaches of San Luis Obispo County, according to the National Weather Service .\nPotential flooding is likely to take place within a few hours of morning high tides.\nThe Weather Service issued a surf advisory for Friday through Sunday, warning beachgoers to exercise caution through the weekend. High tides bring a greater risk of rip currents and drowning.\nBeach goers stop to look over the 6.8-foot King Tide in Pismo Beach on the morning of Dec. 13, 2024. David Middlecamp/dmiddlecamp@thetribunenews.com As of 7:30 Friday, the Arroyo Grande Creek crossing in Oceano was closed during high tide.\nFriday morning’s tide was projected to reach nearly 7 feet, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .\nLarge waves ranging from 10 to 15 feet were also expected.\nThere was a 6.8-foot King Tide in Pismo Beach Pier on the morning of Dec. 13, 2024 with a little extra push from a series of incoming storms.

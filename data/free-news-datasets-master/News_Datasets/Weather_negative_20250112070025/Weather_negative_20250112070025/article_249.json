    "text": "The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has sounded a yellow alert for Bengaluru, cautioning residents about significant rainfall expected over the next few days. On Thursday, the city experienced moderate showers under consistently cloudy skies. The rains are attributed to a low-pressure system near the Sri Lanka-Tamil Nadu coast, which is forecasted to bring heavy downpours to Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry until December 14.\nBangalore's Weather Outlook\nThe IMD predicts moderate to heavy rainfall across Urban Bengaluru, Bangalore Rural, and nearby districts such as Chitradurga, Kolar, and Ramanagara. Coastal districts, including Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, are also expected to witness heavy rain. Meanwhile, Bengaluru's temperatures are likely to fluctuate between 18°C and 30°C during this period. Thunderstorms may accompany the rains in certain coastal and interior regions.\nRainfall Predictions for Karnataka and Beyond\nDecember 13\nModerate rainfall is anticipated in parts of Coastal Karnataka, Kodagu, Tumakuru, Chikkamagaluru, Mysuru, Hassan, Mandya, and Chamarajanagar districts.\nLight rain is likely in isolated areas across other districts of South Interior Karnataka.\nDry weather is expected over North Interior Karnataka.\nDecember 14 to 16\nPredominantly dry weather is forecast for Karnataka, with shallow fog or mist expected over North Interior Karnataka during the mornings.\nDecember 17\nHeavy rain is predicted over districts such as Chikkaballapura, Ramanagara, Bangalore Urban, Bangalore Rural, Kolar, and Tumakuru.\nCoastal Karnataka will likely experience moderate rainfall, while light showers could occur in isolated pockets of Koppal, Gadag, Dharwad, Haveri, and Raichur.\nDecember 18\nModerate rain is forecast for many areas in Coastal Karnataka and select parts of Interior Karnataka.\nRegional Rainfall Highlights\nBangalore's Temperature Forecast\nMinimum temperatures are predicted to drop by 2°C over the next two days, stabilizing thereafter.\nThe city will experience a generally cloudy sky through December 14, with light rains likely. Weather experts predict that Bengaluru will experience maximum daytime temperatures reaching approximately 25°C, offering a mild and comfortable climate. Meanwhile, the nighttime minimum temperatures are likely to dip to around 19°C, making the evenings and early mornings pleasantly cool.\nNotable Weather Observations\nSeveral regions in Karnataka, including Dakshina Kannada, Davanagere, Gadag, and Kalaburagi, have been experiencing considerable rainfall over recent days. This increase in precipitation has led to wet conditions across these districts, impacting daily activities and creating a heightened need for weather preparedness among residents.Chikkamagaluru recorded a minimum temperature of 13.4°C, while Belagavi, Bidar, and Vijayapura observed temperature drops of 4-6°C.\nResidents are strongly encouraged to monitor the latest updates and advisories issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to stay informed about evolving weather conditions. During episodes of intense rainfall, taking precautionary measures such as avoiding waterlogged areas, ensuring emergency supplies are ready, and staying indoors when possible is crucial to minimize risks and ensure personal safety.",

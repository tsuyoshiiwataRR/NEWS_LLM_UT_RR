    "text": "A winter weather advisory was issued by the National Weather Service on Thursday at 2:08 p.m. valid from Friday 2 p.m. until Saturday 9 a.m. The advisory is for Grand Island Area as well as Greeley, Nance, Howard, Merrick, Polk, Hamilton, York, Adams, Clay, Fillmore, Webster, Nuckolls and Thayer counties.\nThe NWS states to anticipate, \"Freezing rain. Ice accumulations ranging from a light glaze up to one tenth of an inch.\"\n\"Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will likely become slick and hazardous,\" describes the NWS. \"Be prepared for slippery roads. Slow down and use caution while driving. If you are going outside, watch your first few steps taken on stairs, sidewalks, and driveways. These surfaces could become icy and slippery.\"\nWinter weather wisdom: Driving tips from the NWS for challenging conditions\nPeople are also readingâ€¦\nWinter's icy grip often turns roads treacherous, leading to over 6,000 weather-related vehicle fatalities and more than 480,000 injuries each year. When you find yourself on snowy or freezing rain-slicked roads, your top priority should be safety. Slow down and exercise caution. In temperatures near freezing, it's prudent to assume icy patches on the road and adjust your driving accordingly. Be on alert for ice accumulating on power lines and tree branches, as they may break and fall. If possible, avoid driving in these conditions altogether. But if you must venture out, choose routes with fewer trees and power lines, and never touch a downed power line. If you encounter one, dial 911 immediately. Here are additional winter driving tips from the NWS:\nShare your travel plans:\nWhen traveling out of town in hazardous winter weather, inform your family or friends of your destination, planned route, and estimated time of arrival.\nPrepare your vehicle:\nEnsure your gas tank is full and equip your vehicle with essential winter supplies, including a windshield scraper, jumper cables, a small shovel, flashlight, cell phone, blanket, extra warm clothing, drinking water, and high-calorie non-perishable food.\nStay calm when stranded:\nIf you become stranded, remain composed. Inform someone about your situation and location. Avoid attempting to walk to safety. Indicate that you need assistance by attaching a cloth to your car's antenna or mirror, and make your vehicle more visible by using the dome light and flashers\nBe mindful of snow plows:\nKeep an eye out for snow plows and provide them with ample room to pass. Only overtake a plow when you have a clear view of the road ahead.\nCheck road conditions:\nBefore embarking on your journey, check the latest road conditions to make informed travel decisions.\nThese winter driving tips from the NWS are your key to a safer journey on snow-covered roads. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of accidents and ensure your well-being during challenging winter weather.\nSource: The National Weather Service\nThis warning was produced by United Robots using National Weather Service data.",

LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT’S GOING ON HERE. AS WE LOOK AT OUR WEATHER HEADLINES AND WE’VE GOT VERY GUSTY WINDS IN THE FORECAST, IF YOU STEPPED OUTSIDE AT ALL TODAY, YOU KNOW THAT’S ALREADY HAPPENING.

BUT AS WE GET INTO THE WEEKEND, WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT TEN, 11, 12 FOOT SEAS COMING IN ALONG THE COAST, HIGH RISK FOR RIP CURRENTS, SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY IN EFFECT AND SEAS MIGHT NOT CALM DOWN UNTIL TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY OF NEXT WEEK ON THE FUTURE TRACK, THE CHANCE FOR SOME FAST MOVING SHOWERS. MOVING ON IN TOMORROW. IT’S ONLY ABOUT A 10 TO 20% CHANCE. IT’S ABOUT A 20 TO 30% CHANCE ON SATURDAY, AND ABOUT A 30% CHANCE ON SUNDAY FOR SOME SHOWERS COMING IN ALONG THE COAST.

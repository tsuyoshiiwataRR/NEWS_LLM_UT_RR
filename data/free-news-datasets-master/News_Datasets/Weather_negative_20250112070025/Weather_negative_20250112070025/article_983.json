We’ve been providing Berkeley with compelling, trustworthy local news for 15 years. Help keep our community-rooted reporting strong in 2025 by donating to our end-of-year fundraising campaign.\nYes! I want to support Berkeleyside!\nThe National Weather Service has issued wind and coastal flooding advisories across the Bay Area, including in Berkeley and Oakland.\nSustained winds of up to 40 mph, with gusts of up to 55 mph, could make it dangerous to drive high-profile vehicles and might knock down tree limbs, causing scattered power outages, according to the NWS Bay Area, which advises residents to “secure outdoor loose objects” and exercise caution on the roads.\nWinds are expected to increase Friday afternoon and evening, with the advisory in effect from 4 p.m. Friday until 7 a.m. Saturday.\nThe National Weather Service Bay Area forecast is summarized here. Courtesy NWS Bay Area Light rain is likely to continue Friday, with more to come through Saturday; about 1 to 2 inches are possible in Berkeley and Oakland. Thunderstorms are also possible overnight into Saturday morning. Sunny weather is expected to return on Sunday.\nOn the flooding front, the possibility of king tides this weekend — higher than normal tides peaking at about 7 feet — has prompted a minor coastal flooding advisory that is in effect until 1 p.m. Monday for low-lying regions along the bay shoreline. The weather service reminds drivers not to drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth.\nConditions will likely also be hazardous for mariners: A small craft advisory is in effect from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. Friday, with gusts of up to 35 knots and choppy water expected. The advisory will become a warning Friday night, with winds of up to 30 knots and “very rough waters” expected.\n… We have a small favor to ask. In this time of uncertainty, you can be sure of one thing: our reporters deliver high-impact, trustworthy local news about Berkeley each and every day. Our independent nonprofit journalism is free for everyone but not free to produce. If you value our work, please support our end-of-year fundraising campaign.\nYes, I want to support Berkeleyside! \" * \" indicates required fields\nSend a private note to the editors. * See an error that needs correcting?

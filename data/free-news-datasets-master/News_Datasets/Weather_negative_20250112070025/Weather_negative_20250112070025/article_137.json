    "text": "Fireworks in December are prohibited. For the December celebrations: Christmas and New Year, the marketing and sale of fireworks is prohibited in the canton of Loja and its 13 parishes. This resolution was born as a preventive measure in the face of the recent forest fires recorded in the current month.\nMeasure\nFernando Villagómez, director of City Security, announced that the Municipality of Loja will not issue permits for the sale of fireworks during the December holidays. Likewise, the Ecuadorian Army, in charge of regulating the marketing of explosive products, will also suspend the issuance of permits during this period.\nRegarding the burning of the puppets, Villagómez explained that they are still expecting any restrictions. However, he hopes that the relevant provisions will be issued in time to be able to be implemented.\nFrom the Police Headquarters, Magno Sarango reported that they will intensify control operations in the sectors where the informal sale of fireworks takes place, in order to guarantee the safety of citizens and avoid accidents related to the unauthorized use of explosive products.\nThis measure aims to protect the environment and protect public safety, especially during holidays which traditionally involve greater risks due to the use of fireworks.

    "text": "WATERTOWN — The lake-effect snow storm Thursday caused some trouble for north country residents as snow continued to fall in the area through the afternoon and evening.\nDo you have a snowblower? You voted: Yes, it's essential! Nope, a shovel works for me We use a plow on a vehicle I don't handle the snow removal Vote View Results Back A state trooper had to be taken to Samaritan Medical Center for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries Thursday after a multi-vehicle crash forced a portion of Interstate 81 to be shut down.\nPolice said in a news release that the crash occurred in the southbound lane and involved two troop vehicles and a civilian vehicle.\nHigh winds led to blustery conditions across the area, with both Jefferson and Lewis counties issuing travel advisories. In Lewis County, a portion of Route 26 had to be closed in both directions Thursday between Bridge Street and Deer River Road after a tractor trailer struck a pole.\nWind also caused some trees to fall into roadways, emergency dispatchers reported. A wind gust of 53 mph was reported at Watertown International Airport near Dexter.\nThe National Weather Service in Buffalo states on its website that the band off of Lake Ontario was expected to stay near Watertown to Fort Drum through the mid-afternoon before shifting south to the northern part of Tug Hill late Thursday afternoon. Two-to-three inches of snow per hour was expected to fall.\nLater Thursday evening, it was anticipated that the band would then shift back north closer to Watertown and potentially to Watertown overnight.\n“The band will also intensify later (Thursday) evening and overnight, with 3-4” per hour snowfall rates possible,” the report states.\nLate Thursday night the band was anticipated to shift south crossing over the Tug Hill and ending up in northern or central Oswego County.\nThose not in the lake-effect area should expect mainly dry weather with some sunshine on Friday.\nThere is little chance of snow over the weekend with a high of 29 with sunny skies on Saturday, and a chance of showers after 1 p.m. Sunday.\nAs of around 4 p.m. Thursday, 8.5 inches of snow fell in Watertown, according to the National Weather Service with 9.8 inches falling in Black River.\nA lake-effect snow warning for Jefferson and Lewis counties expires at 7 p.m. Friday.\nJohnson Newspapers 7.1",

(WMTV) - Thursday brought the coldest temperatures since the middle of January to southern Wisconsin. This included the seasons first subzero temperatures and single digit high temperatures. As has been the case over the last couple of weeks, it won’t stick around. We continue with the up and down weather pattern. Arctic air will stay in the area until Friday night. A low pressure system pushes in Saturday with light freezing rain expected Saturday morning in southern Wisconsin. It will change to rain by the afternoon. Warmer temperatures are expected early next week, with more chances for rain.\nWhat’s Coming Up...\nTonight, dry weather will continue as arctic high pressure moves in, with very cold temperatures around zero. Winds will be light, but wind chills still below zero. Tomorrow, temperatures will rise into the upper teens to low 20s as winds shift to southeasterly, bringing in warmer air from the lake. Saturday’s low pressure system is slowing down. Precipitation may start as late as Saturday morning, potentially as snow and sleet to freezing rain in southern Wisconsin, depending on timing. Temperatures will warm by the afternoon, turning it into rain. Light wintry accumulations are possible, especially for southwestern Wisconsin.\nLooking Ahead...\nSome rain showers could linger into Sunday morning, especially in eastern Wisconsin, due to the departing low pressure system. Temperatures will stay above freezing, so rain is expected. A new low pressure system will bring rain from Monday to Tuesday, with warmer temperatures in the 40s. Heavier rain may come with a cold front on Tuesday. After Monday’s system, temperatures will drop back to normal, with highs in the 30s and lows in the 20s.\n[Click here](https://www.nbc15.com/page/find-nbc15-news-wherever-you-are/) to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\nCopyright 2022 WMTV.

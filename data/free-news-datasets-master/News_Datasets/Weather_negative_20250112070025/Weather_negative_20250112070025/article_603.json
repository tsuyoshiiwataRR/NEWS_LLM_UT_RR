    "text": "GURGAON: The city's minimum temperature, at 8.4 degrees Celsius on Friday, saw a sharp 3.6-degree rise after hitting the season's lowest the previous day. It was 4.6 degrees Celsius on Thursday. The nighttime temperature was a notch above the normal for this time of the season. However, the India Meteorological Department issued a ‘yellow' alert for a cold wave in the city over the weekend, with temperatures expected to drop significantly. The city has not yet experienced any ‘cold' days so far this season. An IMD official said, \\\"With wind from the northwest direction at a velocity of 6 to 10 kmph, the minimum temperature may fall by 1 to 2 degrees.\\\" The weather is predicted to remain dry across the state. IMD categorises a day as ‘severely cold' when the maximum temperature drops below the normal by 6.5 degrees Celsius or more. A cold wave is declared when the minimum temperature dips below the normal by four degrees or more or is less than four degrees Celsius. Residents are advised to prepare for the cold wave and take necessary precautions to stay warm and safe during this period.Dr Neeraj Gupta, associate director of pulmonology, respiratory critical care, and sleep medicine at Max Hospital, Gurgaon, said, \\\"The cold waves are usually dry, and our body works in humidity. So, if you breathe in cold air, it will cause dryness in the throat and nose. Sometimes, it leads to bleeding from the nose and causes severe throat pain. If taken down to the lungs, it causes bronchospasm, exacerbating asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Residents must stay indoors whenever possible and keep the room humid. Try to use oil-based heaters.\\\"",

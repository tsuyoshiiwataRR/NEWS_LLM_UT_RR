    "text": "By Doyle Rice, USA TODAY ,\n1 hours ago Winter's brutal grip is continuing Friday for millions across the eastern U.S. as temperatures remain well below average. Along with the cold, lake-effect snow is flying near the Great Lakes and an ice storm threatens portions of the central U.S.\nMeanwhile in the West, an atmospheric river event will bring very heavy rain, mountain snow, and gusty winds to portions of southern Oregon and northern/central California Friday into Saturday, the National Weather Service said.\nArctic plunge in the East High temperatures will remain cold and below average Friday for much of the north-central and eastern U.S.after a cold front passes through, the weather service predicted.\nForecast highs will range from the teens and 20s for the northern Plains, Great Lakes, and interior Northeast to the 50sacross the Southeast.\nSome good news: The Arctic plunge of air will quickly pivot eastward and then off the Atlantic coast this weekend, AccuWeather said. \"As the core of the coldest air shifts eastward, temperatures will begin to rebound in the Midwest as early as Friday, then (in) the East on Saturday,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said in an online forecast.\nLake-effect in the Great Lakes Most lake-effect snow in the Northeast is expected to taper off Friday morning except for areas downwind of Lake Ontario, where an additional 6-12 inches can be expected through the day Friday, according to the National Weather Service .\n\"Travel will be very difficult with deep snow cover on roads and very poor visibility,\" the weather service warned.\nERIE, PENNSYLVANIA - DECEMBER 12: Cars drive in near whiteout lake-effect snow on Interstate 79 on December 12, 2024 in Erie, Pennsylvania. Heavy snow, falling temperatures, and wind chills are forecast for Erie County. The weather service notes that travel could be difficult at times, and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation has activated vehicle restrictions on interstates in northwestern Pennsylvania. (Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images) Jeff Swensen, Getty Images Iowa ice storm Snow, sleet, and freezing rain will impact portions of the Central Plains through the Upper Midwest beginning tonight, the weather service said. Freezing rain is expected to be the most significant hazard, with as much as 0.25 inch of ice accumulating.\nEast-central Iowa, including the city of Cedar Rapids, is in the region where the most ice is expected.\n\"Some power outages and tree damage are likely due to the ice and wind,\" the weather service in Des Moines said. \"Travel could be nearly impossible as roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will become slick and hazardous tonight into Saturday morning.\n\"Travel is strongly discouraged. If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency. If you are going outside, watch your first few steps taken on stairs, sidewalks, and driveways. These surfaces could be icy and slippery, increasing your risk of a fall and injury,\" the weather service said.\nWestern storms A pair of storms forecast to roll ashore at the end of the week has the potential to trigger significant power outages and travel problems from California to Washington, AccuWeather meteorologists say. Rain, snow, and wind will all be in the forecast over the next couple of days.\nRainfall totals of 3-5 inches, with isolated higher amounts upwards of 7 inches, may lead to some instances of flooding during the height of the event Friday evening/overnight into Saturday morning, the weather service said.\nIn addition, \"winds can become strong enough in portions of northern and central California and western Washington and southern British Columbia to trigger local to regional power outages,\" AccuWeather senior meteorologist Adam Douty said in an online forecast.\nVery heavy mountain snow is also expected at higher elevations (generally over 5000-6000 feet) of the Coastal Ranges and for the Sierra Nevada, the weather service said. Winter storm warnings have been issued for forecast snowfall totals of 1-2 feet, locally higher.\nLittle to no rain is likely in Southern California from the storm farther north in the state this weekend, AccuWeather added.\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Friday forecast: Snow, ice, rain, wind wreak havoc\nBe the first to react",

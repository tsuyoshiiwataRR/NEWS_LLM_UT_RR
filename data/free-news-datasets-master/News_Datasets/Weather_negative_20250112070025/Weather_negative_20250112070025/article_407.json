    "text": "13 Dec 2024 | 09:50 AM UTC\nGreece: Adverse weather forecast across much of the country through at least Dec. 16\nSevere weather forecast across much of Greece through at least Dec. 16. Disruptions to transport, business, and utilities possible.\nAdverse weather is forecast across much of Greece through at least Dec. 16. Cold and foggy conditions are expected across much of mainland Greece Dec. 13, before showers and storms move in from the west Dec. 14. Strong wind gusts, lightning, and hail may accompany storms. Snowfall is also possible in mountainous areas of central and northern mainland Greece over the coming days. Heavy downpours may trigger flooding in low-lying areas and strong winds may cause property damage and power outages. Hazardous travel conditions are likely in areas where more wintry precipitation occurs.\nOfficials have issued the following weather warnings across the country Dec. 13-14:\nDec. 13\nYellow heavy rainfall warnings (the lowest level on a three-tier scale): Crete Region.\nYellow fog warnings: Central, East, and West Macedonia, East Peloponnese, East Sterea and Evia, Epirus, the Ionian Islands, Thessaly, and West Sterea regions.\nYellow low-temperature warnings: Central and West Macedonia, East Sterea and Evia, Epirus, Thessaly, and West Sterea regions.\nDec. 14\nOrange heavy rainfall warnings: East Sterea and Evia, Epirus, the Ionian Islands, and West Peloponnese regions.\nOrange thunderstorm warnings: Epirus, the Ionian Islands, West Peloponnese, and West Sterea regions.\nYellow heavy rainfall warnings: The North East Aegean Islands and West Macedonia regions.\nYellow thunderstorm warnings: The North East Aegean Islands, Thessaly, and West Macedonia regions.\nYellow low-temperature warnings: Central and West Macedonia, East and West Peloponnese, East Sterea and Evia, Epirus, Thessaly, and West Sterea regions.\nAuthorities will likely issue new alerts or update/rescind existing advisories as weather conditions change over the coming hours and days.\nSustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed stormwater drainage systems. Sites downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly or mountainous areas, especially where heavy rain has saturated the soil. Authorities could issue mandatory evacuation orders for flood-prone communities. Disruptions to electricity and telecommunications services are possible where significant flooding or landslides impact utility networks.\nFloodwaters and debris flows could render some bridges or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities may temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. Flight delays and cancellations at airports are possible.\nLocalized business disruptions are possible in low-lying areas; some businesses might not operate at full capacity because of flood damage to facilities, possible evacuations, and some employees' inability to reach work sites. Should disruptions occur, they could linger into early December.\nMonitor local media for weather-related updates and advisories. Confirm all transport reservations and business arrangements before traveling in the affected areas. Seek updated information on road conditions before driving or routing shipments through areas where severe weather is forecast; plan for possible supply chain disruptions throughout the affected areas. Stay away from elevated streams, creeks, and other watercourses that are prone to flash flooding. Do not attempt to navigate flooded roadways. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nOswego County remains under a state of emergency as a powerful winter storm continues to affect the region. The National Weather Service has issued a Lake Effect Snow Warning, which is in effect until 7 p.m. on Friday (December 13). The storm is expected to bring up to two feet of snow, with the heaviest accumulations in northern Oswego County, southern Jefferson County, and northern Lewis County.\nThe storm has already made travel conditions hazardous, with deep snow covering roads and significantly reduced visibility due to blowing snow. Motorists are advised to avoid travel if possible, as visibility will be very difficult during the morning commute. The National Weather Service warns that the weather can change rapidly, with heavy snow bands alternating with dry conditions just a few miles apart.\nWinds could gust as high as 40 mph, exacerbating the blowing and drifting snow. Residents are urged to stay informed about the latest weather updates and to prepare for rapidly changing conditions.\nFor the latest updates on the storm and road conditions, tune to NewsRadio 570 WSYR .",

    "text": "54 minutes ago LA CROSSE (WKBT) -- The colder temps and dry air can increase chances of a house fire, according to the La Crosse Fire Dept.\nThey suggest practicing safety precautions like cleaning your chimney and checking it for wildlife to prevent from fires igniting in your home. They offered the following additional reminders:\n- Check expirations dates on fire extinguishers, smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors. Most expire within 7-10 years, regardless of new batteries in them.\n- If you have a real Christmas tree, water it every day and be leery of falling pine needles which indicates a dry tree.\n- Keep an eye on all types of burning candles; Christmas Day is the biggest day for candle-related fires. Switching to battery operated candles is a safe alternative route.\n- Use the three-foot rule when lighting a fireplace or turning on a space heater.\n\"Our favorite phrase around here is, \"three feet from the heat.\" Whether that's a fireplace, whether it's a space heater, you want to make sure you're keeping that area clear,\" Molly McCormick, community risk educator of the La Crosse Fire Dept. \"Make sure you turn it off each time you leave the room.\"\nMcCormick also suggests getting a space heater that automatically turns off if tipped over.\nâ€‹COPYRIGHT 2024 BY NEWS 8 NOW/NEWS 8000.

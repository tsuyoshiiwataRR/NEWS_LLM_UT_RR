    "text": "Madurai: Following heavy rain in the western ghats, the catchment areas of several wild rivers that drain into the river Thamirabarani, Tuticorin and Tirunelveli district administrations have issued flood warnings for people residing along the banks of the river. Tirunelveli district collector K P Karthikeyan said wild rivers such as Ramanathi and Gadana, which drain into the Thamirabarani, have been flooded. Though 1,500 cusecs were released into the river from the reservoirs, the floodwater from wild rivers has increased the flow to more than 41,000 cusecs in the river, he said. Though the river had not exceeded the danger level, the water level is likely to increase. Therefore, the collector advised all the people living on the banks of the Thamirabarani to exercise caution and follow the instructions of govt officials. He urged the public to stock adequate drinking water and essential items in their houses and secure their livestock in safe places. Meanhwile, Tuticorin district collector K Elambahavath directed the Srivaikundam tahsildar to evacuate people residing in the vulnerable areas of Eral and Srivaikundam blocks. He said the Marudhur and Srivaikundam reservoirs have been receiving 50,000 cusecs of water by Friday morning since the excess water from dams in the Tirunelveli district has been released into the Thamirabarani.People residing in the low-lying areas from Kaliyavoor to Punnakayal on the riverbanks should proceed to evacuation centres. Police and fire department personnel have been deployed in these areas to help people in the evacuation process, he said. All the reservoirs and wild streams in the district are being monitored, he added.Earlier, collectors of Madurai, Dindigul, and Ramanathapuram declared a holiday for schools on Friday while Tirunelveli, Tuticorin, and Tenkasi collectors declared a holiday for all educational institutions.",

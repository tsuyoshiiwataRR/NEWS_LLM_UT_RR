    "text": "1 days ago Check NWS updates here\nEffective: 2024-12-12 04:03:00 EST Expires: 2024-12-12 12:15:00 EST Urgency: Expected Severity: Severe Certainty: Likely Instruction: Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on their vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area or conduct mitigation. Mariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions. Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the vessel for hazardous conditions. Target Area: Munising to Grand Marais MI; Lake Superior East of a line from Manitou Island to Marquette MI and West of a line from Grand Marais MI to the US/Canadian Border Beyond 5NM from shore * WHAT...For the Gale Warning, northwest winds 25 to 30 kt with gusts up to 40 kt and waves 9 to 13 ft occurring. For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, heavy freezing spray at a rate of 2 cm per hour or greater occurring, and may rapidly accumulate on vessels.\n* WHERE...Munising to Grand Marais MI and Lake Superior East of a line from Manitou Island to Marquette MI and West of a line from Grand Marais MI to the US/Canadian Border Beyond 5NM from shore.\n* WHEN...For the Gale Warning, until 1 PM EST this afternoon. For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, until 7 PM EST this evening.\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is hazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic components inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and superstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of stability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could capsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.\nBe the first to react",

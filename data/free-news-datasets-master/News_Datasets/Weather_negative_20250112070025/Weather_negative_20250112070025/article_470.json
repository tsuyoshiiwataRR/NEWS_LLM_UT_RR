    "text": "* WHAT…Dangerous rip currents and breaking waves due to\nelevated surf of 3 to 6 feet expected. Very minor tidal\noverflow and coastal flooding.\n* WHERE…Santa Barbara County Southwestern Coast, Santa Barbara\nCounty Southeastern Coast, Malibu Coast and Los Angeles County\nBeaches.\n* WHEN…Through Sunday afternoon.\n* IMPACTS…There is an increased risk of ocean drowning. Rip\ncurrents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Waves can\nwash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats\nnearshore. In addition, astronomical tides will be running\nhigh, around 7 feet. And with the elevated surf, very minor\ntidal overflow and coastal flooding will be possible for west\nand northwest- facing beaches within a couple hours of morning\nhigh tides, which will progress from around 7AM PST Friday to\nbetween 8AM and 9AM PST by Sunday.\nRemain out of the water due to hazardous swimming conditions, or\nstay near occupied lifeguard towers. Rock jetties can be deadly\nin such conditions, stay off the rocks.\nHigh astronomical tides in combination with above normal surf\nwill likely produce minor flooding of low-lying areas along the\nbeach such as beach parking lots. Coastal officials should take\nthe necessary precautionary measures to safeguard their beaches.",

    "text": "A cold wave continues to grip Karachi, Hyderabad, and much of Sindh through Thursday night, Friday, and Saturday, as predicted by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD). Currently, continental air masses dominate most of Pakistan, with a weak westerly wave affecting Gilgit-Baltistan and moving northeast.\nGiven these conditions, we can expect chilly and dry weather in Karachi, Hyderabad, and most areas of Sindh during these days. In Karachi, temperatures are expected to drop to 10-12°C on Friday and 9-11°C on Saturday. Similarly, Hyderabad will experience temperatures from 10-12°C on Friday, dipping to 9-11°C on Saturday.\nOver the past 24 hours, a cold wave has swept through Karachi, Hyderabad, and many other districts in Sindh. Mithi emerged as the coldest spot in Sindh with a temperature of 2°C and an evening relative humidity of 23%. Karachi recorded a minimum temperature of 11°C, with evening humidity at 14%, while Hyderabad saw a low of 12°C with 30% humidity in the evening.\nThe persistent cold weather requires residents to take necessary precautions to stay warm and safe.",

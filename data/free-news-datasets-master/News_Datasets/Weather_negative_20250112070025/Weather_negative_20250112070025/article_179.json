Visuals shared by the news agency ANI from Tirunelveli, Madurai, and Thoothukudi show waterlogging on streets due to continued downpours in these districts.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a heavy rain alert, with thunderstorms and lightning at isolated spots across Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal. Extremely heavy downpours are likely in the Tenkasi, Tirunelveli, and Thoothukudi districts.\n— ANI (@ANI)\n[#WATCH]| Tamil Nadu: Rain lashed parts of Thoothukudi.[pic.twitter.com/s0ESdKIFuy][December 13, 2024]\nHeavy Rain in Madurai\n— ANI (@ANI)\n[#WATCH]| Tamil Nadu: Rain lashes parts of Madurai[pic.twitter.com/991yB9nLsV][December 12, 2024]\nIMD said that several other districts, including Tiruvallur, Chennai, Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu, Villupuram, Cuddalore, Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Thanjavur, and Puducherry, are likely to witness heavy rain at isolated places. The weather department has issued a warning to fishermen, advising them to avoid venturing into certain coastal areas, including Sri Lanka’s coast, the Gulf of Mannar, the Bay of Bengal, and the Kerala coast, between December 12 and 16, due to adverse weather conditions.\nIMD predicted light to moderate rainfall on Saturday, December 14, in parts of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal. Heavy rain is likely in districts like Nilgiris, Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Theni, Madurai, Virudhunagar, Tenkasi, Tirunelveli, and Thoothukudi.\n— IMD-Tamilnadu Weather (@ChennaiRmc)[December 12, 2024]\nAlso Read | [Puducherry Rains: All Schools and Colleges in Karaikal to Remain Closed Today Due to Heavy Rainfall.](https://www.lokmattimes.com/national/puducherry-rains-all-schools-and-colleges-in-karaikal-to-remain-closed-today-due-to-heavy-rainfall-a517/)\nThe reason for heavy rainfall in the south belt of Tamil Nadu is due to the low-pressure area over the southwest Bay of Bengal near the Gulf of Mannar. While this system is expected to weaken, the northeast monsoon remains vigorous across Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.\nAs a precautionary measure, schools in 11 districts, including Chennai, Villupuram, Thanjavur, Mayiladuthurai, Pudukkottai, Cuddalore, Dindigul, Ramanathapuram, Thiruvarur, Ranipet, and Tiruvallur, have been closed.\n[Open in app](https://www.lokmattimes.com/install_app.htm?utm_source=www.lokmattimes.com&utm_medium=open_in_app&launch_url=https://www.lokmattimes.com/national/tamil-nadu-rains-waterlogging-reported-in-several-areas-imd-predicts-heavy-rainfall-in-chennai-and-other-districts-a517/)",

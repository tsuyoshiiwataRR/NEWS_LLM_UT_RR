    "text": "By Gina Martinez ,\n1 hours ago Parts of New York that have been inundated with snow will finally see an end to heavy snowfall at the end of this week.\nA fierce lake-effect snowstorm is nearing its end across the Great Lakes. While heavy snow continue to pummel areas east of lakes Erie and Ontario , relief is on the horizon as the storm is expected to weaken by Friday evening, Fox Weather reported. Eden, New York, has been received over 3.5 feet of snow since Thursday, while other surrounding areas have gotten over 2.5 feet.\nT he strong winds and heavy snowfall have led to dangerous travel conditions and prompted a state of emergency in parts of New York state. Off Lake Ontario, the band of heavy snow will cross into the Tug Hill region and end up in northern, or even central Oswego County by Friday morning, Fox Weather reported.\nChristmas snow alert as Polar Vortex poised to dump 11 feet in days before big holiday\nWorld's longest underwater 'mega tunnel' to cost $46 billion but will halve 21-hour drive\nThe band should then remain over northern Oswego County all throughout Friday, gradually shrinking back to the lakeshore before ending Saturday, the FOX Forecast Center said. The FOX Forecast Center said some light snow may linger across Chautauqua County on Friday, but this will be light and should end completely later in the day.\nOrchard Park, New York, located downwind of Lake Erie, has received 30 inches of snow since Thursday. The city has also issued a local state of emergency and implemented a driving ban. \"Town Highway and Village (Department of Public Works) crews have been working throughout the night (Thursday) to remove snow from roadways,\" police said in a Facebook post .\n\"Our 911 center and police personnel are handling an increasing number of calls for service. Please adhere to the driving ban as we all work collectively to keep our community safe.\"\nErie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said he was advised that local states of emergency have also been declared in towns across western New York, including Brant and Evans. Poloncarz said an Erie County Department of Public Works plow truck drove off the road on Route 20 in the Evans and Hamburg areas. That driver was not injured.\nExclusive FOX Weather Storm Tracker Corey Gerken was in Hamburg on Thursday morning and said it was the heaviest snowfall he’d seen in the area in quite a while. \"Everyone is getting stuck on the roads,\" he said. \"It’s a complete nightmare out here.\"\nVideo captured at Frederick Douglass Greater Rochester International Airport on Thursday showed planes waiting to be de-iced during heavy snowfall.\n5",

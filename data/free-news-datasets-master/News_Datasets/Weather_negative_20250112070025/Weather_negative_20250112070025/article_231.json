    "text": "On the second day of an intense cold front, many northern provinces experienced even lower temperatures. According to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, Mau Son Peak in Lang Son Province recorded the lowest temperature at 4 degrees.\nOther high-altitude areas also reported sharp declines, with Dong Van in Ha Giang reaching 7 degrees on Friday morning, Tam Dao in Vinh Phuc at over 8 degrees, and Sa Pa in Lao Cai, Ngan Son in Bac Kan, and Trung Khanh in Cao Bang all recording 9 degrees.\nIn Hanoi, Ba Vi reported the lowest temperature at over 13 degrees, while stations in Hoai Duc and Son Tay recorded 14 degrees. Inner-city areas such as Lang and Ha Dong saw slightly warmer temperatures at 15 degrees.\nThe cold spell has also reached central provinces from Thanh Hoa to Thua Thien Hue, where temperatures fell below 20 degrees.\nMeteorologists predict the cold front will intensify Friday night, plunging temperatures in northern mountainous areas to below 13 degrees.\nOn Saturday, midland areas in the northern region are expected to see daytime temperatures of 13-15 degrees and nighttime lows of 10-13 degrees. In mountainous regions, nighttime temperatures could drop to 6-10 degrees or lower.\nThe American weather site AccuWeather forecasts Hanoi’s temperatures to range from 14-18 degrees, climbing to 21-24 degrees during the day before dropping to 11 at night on Saturday. High-altitude areas above 1,500 meters, such as Sa Pa, are expected to see lows of 5-8 degrees over the weekend.\nThe central region will also feel the impact of the cold fronts, with the northern-central provinces experiencing the lowest temperatures in the region, ranging from 12-15 degrees.",

    "text": "By Brad Hamilton Dave Nethers ,\n15 hours ago\n(WJW) — A steady pounding of lake effect snow fell across Ohio’s primary snow belt, dropping a fresh coating on top of mounds of snow and ice left from last week.\nCommunities including Ashtabula and Lake County not only got walloped once again with as much as eight inches of additional snow but the season’s coldest temperatures dealt a double blow.\nBiden pardons these 4 Ohioans, veterans Low double-digit temperatures were made to feel like minus-two with bitter wind gusts at times higher than 30 miles an hour directly off of the lake.\n“About the last what ten-fifteen years it hasn’t been this bad at all but now all of a sudden its back,” said Jonathan Moore, a lifelong resident of Ashtabula who was carefully driving for the city’s transportation service on Thursday trying to get senior citizens safely to and from doctors appointments.\n“You have to be careful. The roads are slick. Some people have to go to a dialysis center on wheelchairs, walkers and you have to be extra careful with them because its slick snow is deep and some of them can’t move as well as they used to,” said Moore.\nYounger residents of the area say they cannot remember a season this brutal in years.\nBut for long-time residents, it reminds them of winters they experienced here along the Lake Erie Coastline when they were younger.\n“To me this is how it was when I was a kid – when I was a kid going to school this was every day. No schools were closed nothing,” said Jeff Moore\nMoore, who has tried for years to make some money plowing snow, said this was a great year for plow drivers.\nFernando Roboes said he had been plowing since 2 a.m. Thursday.\nJimmy Dimora sentence commuted by President Biden “You have just go to go over again like you start early…you have got to go over it again. The first place you did you have to go back again,” said Roboes.\nWhile the snowfall on Thursday was not necessarily paralyzing, particularly by primary snowbelt standards, it did make for sloppy roads and slow going.\nThe Ohio Department of Transportation was plowing and treating highways around the clock as were municipal crews, those in Ashtabula trying to clear 90 miles of laned roads through the city.\nAnd winter does not officially start for another nine days.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

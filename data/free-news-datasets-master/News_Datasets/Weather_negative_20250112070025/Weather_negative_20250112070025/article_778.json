    "text": "Bhubaneswar: Rourkela recorded the lowest temperature of 8.1°C on Friday, as several parts of the state witnessed a gradual dip in mercury over the past three days, accompanied by dense fog, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported.G Udayagiri in Kandhamal district followed Rourkela with 8.4°C while Jharsuguda registered the highest temperature deviation, with a 3.5°C dip below the normal to 9.8°C.Dense fog enveloped Rourkela, Phulbani and Koraput during morning hours, disrupting traffic movement. The state capital recorded 14.5°C, 1.5°C below the normal.\\\"Clear skies and changing wind patterns have contributed to the temperature drop,\\\" said Manorama Mohanty, scientist and head of the regional IMD centre here. She said cold conditions emerged after the western disturbance-induced rain possibility subsided.IMD has forecast the cold trend to continue for the next three days, followed by a possible 2-4°C rise in minimum temperature over the subsequent two days. Shallow to moderate fog is expected to persist, particularly in Jharsuguda, Ganjam and Kalahandi districts on Saturday.Following the IMD's fog advisory, the special relief commissioner's office has directed district collectors to implement necessary measures for regulated vehicle movement on highways.",

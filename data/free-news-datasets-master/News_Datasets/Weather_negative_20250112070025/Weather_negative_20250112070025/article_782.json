    "text": "First Alert 6 Weather day: Freezing drizzle after 4pm Friday; slick roads likely\nOMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - Today is a FIRST ALERT 6 WEATHER DAY due to the threat of freezing drizzle that develops after 4pm and becomes more widespread as the night goes on.\nTemperatures will struggle to warm from the cold start in the lower teens. Clouds are likely to increase and get in the way of any significant warming too. A high of about 31 may be the best we can do in the metro and that may not happen until closer to midnight.\nFreezing drizzle chance will keep going up tonight with a light glaze coating things more and more after sunset.\nWidespread areas of 0.1″ of ice is what many of us can expect by the end of this event but a few spots north of I-80 could see higher amounts. The greatest likelihood for those look to be in West Central Iowa.\nWe should be able to warm just above 32 by sunrise Saturday at the latest but there will still be chilly showers on the map. There could even be some lingering freezing rain north of I-80 to start Saturday further adding to the icing totals. We’ll warm to 36 by the afternoon and that should melt the ice.\nHighs by Sunday will be much warmer up into the 40s with hopefully a little sun breaking through.\nCopyright 2024 WOWT.

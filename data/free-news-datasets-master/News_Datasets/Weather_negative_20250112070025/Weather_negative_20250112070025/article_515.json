    "text": "Freezing drizzle, slick roads Friday afternoon\nFreezing drizzle, slick roads Friday afternoon\nBELOW ZERO FOR MANY LOCATIONS THIS AFTERNOON. SEVERE WEATHER. WINTER WEATHER ADVISORIES STARTING AT 2:00. LOOKING FOR THE CHANCE OF SOME ACCUMULATING ICE, EVEN LESS SNOW. BUT LET’S GET INTO IT. STARTING THIS MORNING. A MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. THOSE CLOUDS ALREADY INCREASING. STEPPING OUT THE DOOR. IT IS VERY BRISK 12. FEELING LIKE TWO IN OMAHA 12. FEELING LIKE ZERO. LINCOLN AND TEN. FEELING LIKE THREE BELOW ZERO IN NORFOLK. BREEZY WINDS TODAY AND EVEN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. KEEPING THE COLD. NOT HELPING US HERE WITH OUR FORECAST FOR THIS AFTERNOON. COLD TEMPERATURES MEANS THE GROUND ALREADY COLD. THAT COULD HELP SOME ICE DEVELOPMENT LATER ON AS WE SEE FREEZING RAIN MOVE IN. LIVE SUPER DOPPLER HERE AT THE MOMENT, GIVING US OUR THREE-MINUTE ADVANTAGE. STILL QUIET. CLOUDS OUT OVERHEAD, BUT IT’S MAINLY AGAIN AFTER ABOUT 3 TO 4 P.M. WHERE WE SEE THAT CHANCE FOR SOME OF THAT WINTRY PRECIPITATION IMPACT. WEATHER ICONS THIS MORNING AGAIN FOR THE COLD. KEEP IT MOSTLY CLOUDY TODAY. BREEZY WITH EAST SOUTHEASTERLY GUSTS UP TO 25 MILES AN HOUR SO THAT WIND CHILL LIKELY TO STAY WITH US. 29. OUR HIGH THIS AFTERNOON. OMAHA COLUMBUS 22 CARROLL AND 32 SHENANDOAH. AVERAGE HIGH 38. BUT AREA WIDE. WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY ISSUED FROM 2:00 THIS AFTERNOON TO 9:00 ON YOUR SATURDAY MORNING. UP TO AN INCH OF SNOW. THAT’S MAINLY FOR AREAS NORTH THAT NOT LOOKING LIKE A MAJOR IMPACT, BUT UP TO ABOUT A QUARTER INCH OF ICE POSSIBLE. BLACK ICE, VERY SLICK ON THOSE ROADWAYS. IT’S ALL GOING TO COME DOWN TO TEMPERATURES AS WE HEAD THROUGHOUT THE DAY TODAY, HEADING INTO STORM PREDICTOR BY LUNCH. WE’RE STILL INTO THE TEENS AND 20S THAT RAIN STARTS TO ARRIVE MAINLY AFTER 4 P.M. HERE FOR THE OMAHA METRO AREAS ALONG AND NORTH OF I-80. NOTE THAT TEMPERATURES STILL MAINLY INTO THE UPPER 20S ALONG AND NORTH OF I-80 INTO THE LOWER 30S SOUTH OF I-80. AS WE HEAD INTO THAT EVENING, DRIVE HOME 630 STILL 27 DEGREES, STILL LOOKING FOR THIS FREEZING RAIN. AGAIN, THIS IS GOING TO ADD VERY, VERY SLICK CONDITIONS ON THOSE ROADWAYS. FOUR WHEEL DRIVE NOT GOING TO HELP A WHOLE LOT. YOU’RE GOING TO HAVE TO JUST KEEP IT VERY SLOW AS WE HEAD OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. THOSE TEMPERATURES FINALLY GET UP NEAR AND JUST ABOVE FREEZING, MAKING THAT TRANSITION FROM FREEZING RAIN TO A NICE COLD RAIN FOR YOUR SATURDAY MORNING. FOR YOUR ICE FORECAST, LIGHT GLAZE FOR MANY HERE IN THE LIGHT PINK, BUT INCLUDING PARTS OF I-80 FROM LINCOLN TO OMAHA THROUGH ATLANTIC, ABOUT A 10TH OF AN INCH TO ABOUT A QUARTER INCH OF ICE POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON AND FOR TONIGHT. SO THAT IS GOING TO MAKE A MAJOR IMPACT HERE FOR YOUR EVENING DRIVE HOME. WINDS ALSO NOT HELPING TOO MUCH OUT OF THE EAST SOUTHEAST UP TO ABOUT 25 MILES AN HOUR. AGAIN SNOW POSSIBLE THAT NOT OUR MAJOR CONCERN HERE. AS WE HEAD INTO THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. TODAY, A SEVERE WEATHER DAY FOR FREEZING RAIN AFTER 4 P.M. WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY STARTING AT TWO. IMPACT WEATHER TOMORROW MORNING FOR RAIN, ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY. NICE COOL RAIN, A HIG\nAdvertisement\nFreezing drizzle, slick roads Friday afternoon\nAdvertisement",

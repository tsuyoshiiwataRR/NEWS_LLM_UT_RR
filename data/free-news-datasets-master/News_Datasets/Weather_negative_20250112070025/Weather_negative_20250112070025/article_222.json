    "text": "Delhi experienced its coldest December day in three years on Thursday, with the minimum temperature dropping to 4.5°C. This was four degrees below the normal for the season and colder than certain hill stations like Shimla (5°C) and Mussoorie (6.9°C). The India Meteorological Department (IMD) confirmed cold wave conditions in parts of the city and issued a yellow alert, predicting similar conditions to persist through Saturday.Delhi Weather: IMD explains the phenomenonThe IMD attributed the drop in temperatures to northwesterly winds and a western disturbance causing snowfall in the Himalayas. “The western disturbance which began influencing northwest India from December 8 onwards is still bringing fresh snowfall to the mountains. This is what is leading to the drop in temperature across the plains,” an IMD official stated. The agency noted that further dips in temperature are possible in the absence of a change in wind speed or direction.Classification of a cold waveIMD classifies a cold wave when the minimum temperature is below 10°C, and the maximum temperature is at least 4.5°C below normal. On Wednesday, Delhi recorded 4.9°C—the earliest such dip since 1987—marking the beginning of the cold wave conditions.Coldest spots in DelhiAmong the city’s weather stations, Ayanagar recorded 3.8°C, and Pusa saw a low of 3.2°C, making them the coldest areas in the city on Thursday.Forecast for the coming daysWeather experts have predicted cold winds to persist till Sunday due to fresh snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir as well as in Himachal Pradesh in the last 24 hours. The snowfall is likely to stop by Friday, after that, the minimum may gradually rise by a degree or two.Unseasonal patterns in DecemberDespite the cold spell, IMD forecasts predict that December will remain warmer than usual overall for most of northwest India, including Delhi-NCR. The maximum temperature on Thursday was recorded at 22.2°C, a degree below normal, with the lowest maximum of 19.6°C observed at Palam.With cold wave conditions continuing, residents are advised to prepare for freezing mornings and chilly days until conditions improve.",

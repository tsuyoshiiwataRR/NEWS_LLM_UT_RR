    "text": "By Tim Wenger ,\n1 days ago\nBuffalo, N.Y. (WBEN) - After pummeling the Southtowns early in the day Thursday, lake effect snow was on the move late in the evening and through the overnight once again, drifting as far Northward as South Buffalo, West Seneca and parts of Cheektowaga.\nAn intense single band of heavy lake snow re-established Thursday evening. The band stretches from Long Point to Sturgeon Point and Northeastward across the Buffalo Southtowns to Genesee County.\nSnowfall rates of 2-to-3 inches an hour will be found within this band that will jog a bit further North into South Buffalo\nThrough the overnight, the band will push southward while weakening substantially, with snowfall rates falling to less than 1 inch per-hour before daybreak over Chautauqua County. Some light snow may linger across Chautauqua County on Friday, but this will be light, and should end completely later in the day.\nBuffalo Schools and a number of other districts have made the decision to close again Friday.\nCHECK : WBEN Closings\nA Lake Effect Snow Warning is in effect for Erie, Genesee, Wyoming, Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties through 1 p.m. Friday.\nCity of Buffalo Mayor Christopher P. Scanlon has declared a State of Emergency for the City of Buffalo in response to rapidly deteriorating conditions caused by significant snowfall accumulation and high winds impacting visibility in the southern portion of the city. This declaration aligns with the State of Emergency issued earlier today by Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz.\nThe City of Buffalo is also issuing a travel advisory for South Buffalo covering the area from William Street south to the city line. Residents are urged to stay off the roads unless absolutely necessary. For those who must travel, please exercise extreme caution to ensure your safety and the safety of others.\nTemperatures will be cold, with highs in the low to mid 20s for lower elevations and around 20 higher terrain Friday. Lows overnight into Friday will be in the teens.\nLAKE EFFECT SNOW WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM EST FRIDAY\n* WHAT...Heavy lake effect snow. Additional snow accumulations 4 to 8 inches in the most persistent lake snows.\n* WHERE...Northern Erie and Genesee Counties. The heaviest snow will be just south of Buffalo and across far southern Genesee County.\n* WHEN...Until 1 PM EST Friday.\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous conditions will impact the Friday morning commute.\nPRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...\nHeavy snow will fall in relatively narrow bands. If traveling, be prepared for rapidly changing road conditions and visibilities.\nSubmit snow reports through our website or social media.\nDuring lake effect snow, the weather can vary from bands of locally heavy snow with greatly reduced visibilities to dry conditions just a few miles away. Be prepared for rapid changes in weather, visibility, and road conditions.\nLAKE EFFECT SNOW WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 PM EST FRIDAY\n* WHAT...Heavy lake effect snow.

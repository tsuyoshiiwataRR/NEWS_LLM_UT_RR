    "text": "Heavy rains coupled with heavy winds that lashed hill stations of Chikkamagaluru damaged the structures put up for Datta Jayanti celebrations atop Bababudangiri on Friday.\nHundreds of Datta devotees are expected to visit the cave shrine, Sri Guru Dattatreya Bababudan Swamy Dargah, on the final day of three-day Datta Jayanti celebrations.\nChikkamagaluru district administration had made arrangements atop the hill for the event. The structure built with tin sheets went off in the air following heavy winds. The staff on the job to put up tents had a tough time as the entire area is covered by fog.\nDeputy Commissioner Meena Nagaraj, Superintendent of Police Vikram Amate and officers of the Public Works Department and MESCOM visited the place and reviewed the preparations. The administration has imposed restrictions on touristsâ€™ visits to the place during the event. As the road to the hill station is damaged, the administration has decided not to allow heavy vehicles.\nPublished - December 13, 2024 07:59 pm IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

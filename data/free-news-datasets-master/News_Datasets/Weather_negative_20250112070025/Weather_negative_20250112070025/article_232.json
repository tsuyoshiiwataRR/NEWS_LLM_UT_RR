    "text": "Wagga is bracing for its hottest day since 2021, and as temperatures rise, residents must be vigilant to stay safe and cool.\nEarly forecasts have temperatures exceeding 40 degrees for the first time since January 24, 2021, next week.\nAs the weather continues to heat up, the Murrumbidgee Local Health District (MLHD) is urging people to stay heat aware.\nMLHD senior medical advisor Dr Anton Forsyth said preparedness is the best way to combat heat-related illnesses.\n\"We're asking people to plan ahead, to know the symptoms of heat-related illness, and what they can do to keep cool and stay hydrated during heatwaves,\" Dr Forsyth said.\nResidents with ongoing health conditions are being reminded to speak with their doctors if they anticipate hot weather will affect them and to store medications at appropriate temperatures.\nDr Forsyth said hot weather impacts everyone, but infants, young children and people 65 years old are at greater risk.\nHe also reminded people to prepare their homes, including checking that fridges, fans, and air-conditioners are working properly.\nAfter a prolonged humid spell, many will welcome this week's dry heat, and home cooling systems are likely to be more efficient than in the past fortnight.\nHarrison & Higgins Airconditioning owner Steve Absolum said homes with evaporative cooling units, known as swampies, will have better relief from the heat in the coming weeks.\nThe systems work to cool spaces by pumping moisture into the air, which is not helpful on a humid day.\n\"In 38 degrees hot weather, no humidity, they're perfect, but any form of humidity affects their performance because they are just putting more moisture into already humid air,\" Mr Absolum said.\n\"With our evaporative coolers, when it's a hot, humid day, we're better off turning the pump off and just running it as a fan.\n\"They just struggle in the humidity, we've all had the moment on a humid day, it's happening in my own house, you've got wet floors, wet walls and everything feels damp because we're just adding more humid air to the already humid air.\"\nTo get the best bang for buck out of evaporative cooling, Mr Absolum said to keep doors and windows open.\nHowever, keeping the house closed is the go if you have a reverse cycle system.\n\"We're conditioning the airspace within our house, so we need windows and doors closed,\" Mr Absolum said.\n\"We're recycling the air internally, and we're cooling that air over and over, so we don't want to be drawing any outside air through windows or open doors because that makes the unit work harder and obviously, we're going to use more power to then condition that airspace.\"\nFor those without air conditioners, ceiling or pedestal fans will help provide some relief.\nThough they do not cool the air, they create a wind chill by pushing air across your skin to draw out heat.\nDuring extreme heat, it is best to stay out of the sun, however, if you intend to cool down in the water,\nit is essential to take precautions.\nDAILY\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.",

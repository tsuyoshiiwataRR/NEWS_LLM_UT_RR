    "text": "FRESNO, Calif. (FOX26) — Thursday morning was a rainy day across the city of Fresno.\nIn the Southeast area, roads started to fill up with water. forcing drivers to be more cautious on the road.\nSome roads even had some slight flooding, which caused more cautions for drivers. Some water was so high that they almost covered clothing on the roads.\nIn the foothills of the central valley, snow hit the areas hard.\nA video from China Peak shows the slopes getting some extra snow for people who want to ski or snowboard.\nOther angles, like from the boathouse camera near Huntington Lake, shows how the snow impacted spots close to the lake.\nThe snow was so packed that tire chains were needed for anyone driving in the area.\nOther spots like Shaver Lake were hit just as hard. webcams from Kan’s Liquor show the snow building up on cars that were both parked and even driving.\nIn Yosemite, it was the same as the rest.\nFootage from the Yosemite Conservancy shows a blanket of snow covering the ground and the trees.\nA first day of possibly more weather impacts to come.",

    "text": "Udhagamandalam: Normal life was affected by incessant rain in the Nilgiris for the past two days. Motorists on Friday found it difficult to navigate through various stretches, as the hill retreat was enveloped by thick mist. Kotagiri and Coonoor taluks recorded more rain compared to other taluks in the district. The temperature, meanwhile, was recorded at 16 degree Celsius during the day. This, coupled with wet weather, offered a hard time for the school-going children.M Selvakumar, a local resident, said the visibility was zero in certain places because of thick mist and it was difficult to travel through the ghat and valley roads.Tourists too found it difficult to drive through the ghat section of road. Most of them stayed indoors because of incessant rain.According to revenue officials, no rain-related damages were reported in the hill retreat. They said disaster management teams were on high alert and prepared to tack any eventuality.A transformer was uprooted near Marapalam area near Coonoor following heavy wind and rain. TNEB officials said alternate arrangements would be made to supply electricity to the area till they installed a new transformer, which had to be brought from Coimbatore.The concrete electric post near Mynalah on the Ooty-Kotagiri road is in a dilapidated condition and requires the attention of TNEB authorities.Meanwhile, train services on the Nilgiri Mountain Railway remained cancelled on the day between Mettupalayam and Ooty owing to the continuous rain in the hills. The services would remain suspended on Saturday as well as per an announcement by the Salem division of Southern Railways.Local residents said they were weary of continuous rain in the hills as the same might trigger landslides.",

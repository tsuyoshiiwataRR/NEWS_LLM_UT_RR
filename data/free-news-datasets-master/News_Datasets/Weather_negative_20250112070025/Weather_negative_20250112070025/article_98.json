    "text": "Updated: 6 hours ago\nForensic scientists on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana are specializing in solving Missing and Murdered Indigenous Peoples cases.\nUpdated: 7 hours ago\nAnchorage police report 47 outdoor deaths this year, plus the Mat-Su Borough School District will no longer use remote learning days in place of weather-related closures and ASD could follow suit.\nUpdated: 18 hours ago\nUpdated: 18 hours ago\nHilltop Ski Area was able to remain open during a recent warm spell in Anchorage which saw temperatures nearing 50 degrees, and was able to retain most of the snow on the slopes, according to slope managers. Hilltop recently purchased new snow guns to aid in creating snow for their slopes, which General Manager Travis Bird says goes a long way in keeping the slopes covered even during warmer weather. The artificial snow is denser than natural making it more resilient.\nUpdated: 21 hours ago\nThe state’s Department of Transportation presented newly revised alternatives for the Seward to Glenn Connection during Tuesday’s open house.",

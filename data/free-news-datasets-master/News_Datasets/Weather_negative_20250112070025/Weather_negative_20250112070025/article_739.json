    "text": "Heavy rains continued to batter parts of Kerala on Friday, prompting the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to issue an ‘orange alert’ for three southern districts. This alert applies to Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Pathanamthitta, indicating the possibility of very heavy rainfall ranging from 6 cm to 20 cm in these areas.\nIn addition, a ‘yellow alert’ was issued for six other districts across the state, signifying heavy rainfall between 6 cm and 11 cm. These warnings highlight the ongoing intensity of the monsoon season in Kerala, which has led to widespread weather disruptions.\nThe Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has also stepped up its advisory efforts, cautioning the public about the risk of strong winds accompanying the rainfall. The authority has shared safety guidelines, urging residents to remain vigilant, especially in flood-prone and landslide-prone regions.\nThis follows Thursday’s alerts when the IMD issued a ‘red alert’—the highest level of warning—for three districts and an ‘orange alert’ for five others. The heavy downpours have raised concerns about potential disruptions to daily life, waterlogging, and damage in vulnerable areas, with authorities closely monitoring the situation.\nWith inputs from PTI",

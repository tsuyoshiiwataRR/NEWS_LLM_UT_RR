    "text": "By Abigail O'Leary ,\n31 minutes ago The U.S. East Coast began a whiplash-inducing stretch of weather this week with a deluge of rain, rapid snowmelt and powerful gusts, creating dangerous conditions and the potential for holiday chaos.\nAs a powerful storm system stretches from Florida to Maine, Utilities braced for widespread power outages with winds projected to exceed 60 mph (97 kph). AccuWeather meteorologists say several storms will now continue to spread rain and snow across parts of the country before Christmas, which could complicate shopping and shipping for people purchasing last-minute gifts.\nForecasters are warning shoppers ahead of Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa could be hampered by the storms, with delivery times possibly affected due to shipping delays.\nREAD MORE: Christmas snow alert as Polar Vortex poised to dump 11 feet in days before big holiday\nREAD MORE: World's longest underwater 'mega tunnel' to cost $46 billion but will halve 21-hour drive\nA key driver in the weather was an atmospheric river , which is a long band of water vapor that can transport moisture from the tropics to more northern areas, said Derek Schroeter, a forecaster with the National Weather Service. New England was bearing the brunt as the storm tapped moisture from the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the U.S. Southeast, and transported it to places like Maine, he said.\nAlex Hobbs, a Boston college student, hopes that the weather won’t interfere with her plans to return home to San Francisco soon.\n“I’m a little worried about getting delays with heavy wind and rain, possibly snow,” she said Wednesday.\nIn New England, the storm began with combination of fog and freezing rain Tuesday night into early Wednesday, making travel treacherous. A tractor-trailer carrying a load of oranges went off the Maine Turnpike in New Gloucester; the road was so treacherous that the oranges couldn’t be removed until a day later.\nIn New Hampshire, the Mount Washington Avalanche Center issued a special bulletin Wednesday for the Presidential Range of mountains, which received significant snowfall over the last two weeks. “Heavy rainfall could create dangerous and unpredictable avalanche conditions on steep snow-covered slopes,” the avalanche center warned.\nAtop Mount Washington, wind gusts hit 89 mph (143 kph). The location is one of the planet’s windiest spots. Its highest gust recorded for 2023 was 132 mph (212 kph). From January to December of that year, it saw 145 days with gusts of 73 mph (117 kph) or higher.\n2",

    "text": "Today: Current observations as of 8 AM display temperatures in the single digits with an east wind at 5-10 mph across our area. Skies are partly cloudy with very thin high level clouds moving through. Wind chills sit in the negative single digits to negative teens. As we head into the afternoon, temperatures climb into the upper teens and lower 20s. Partly cloudy skies and high level clouds continue. Winds increase out of the east-southeast at 5-15 mph, gusting up to 25 mph. Wind chills feel like the single digits despite consistent warming throughout the day. High temperatures are reached around midnight in the low to mid 20s.\nA Storm Track 7 Red ALERT DAY has been issued from tonight to Saturday morning due to a wintry mix of freezing rain, sleet, and snow leading to ice accumulations of a tenth inch to 0.3” and snowfall accumulations up to around 1”. North of Highway 20, maximum snowfall amounts could range from 1 to 3”. This is a significant amount of ice expected that could make travel nearly impossible, especially on untreated roads. Bridges/overpasses, sidewalks, driveways, and parking lots could become pure ice and very slippery. Ice may coat power lines and trees and could lead to power outages and tree damage.\nTonight [ICE STORM WARNING]: Heading into the evening, cloud cover begins to build out west as a storm system begins its approach. Warm/moist air makes its way across the state, but it overruns stubborn cold air. This produces mixed precipitation out west. The storm system slowly makes its way into our area by 9-10 PM. At the surface, temperatures will sit below freezing in the upper teens and lower 20s. Severe ice accumulation is expected, as a majority of the rain that falls will freeze on contact with the surface. Overall ice totals range from 0.10” to 0.30” and even greater in some spots. The freezing rain extends far into the overnight hours and even into tomorrow morning. Lows remain in the upper teens and 20s. Winds are east-southeasterly at 10-20 mph, gusting to 30 mph.\nTomorrow [ICE STORM WARNING]: Freezing rain continues throughout the morning and may persist into the early afternoon. Eventually, all precipitation will become rain, but it is possible some areas furthest north receive snow. Highs climb into the mid and upper 30s. Overnight, lows fall into the upper 20s and lower 30s. Winds are southeasterly at 5-15 mph, gusting to 25 mph.\nSunday: Cloudy. Highs in the upper 30s and lower 40s. Winds are southerly at 5-15 mph. Overnight, lows fall into the lower 30s with a 30% chance of rain.\nNext Week: We remain in the 40s for Monday with morning rain. We then level off in the upper 20s and lower 30s for the rest of the week.\nStay off the roads tonight into tomorrow!\n-Joshua",

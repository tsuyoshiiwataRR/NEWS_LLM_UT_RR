    "text": "Parts of eastern Ontario are being hit with a weather bomb that will last into Thursday.\nA “weather bomb” or “bomb cyclone” is brought on by a low-pressure system that intensifies very rapidly and can cause severe weather, including strong winds and prolonged rain or flurries.\nSteven Flisfeder, a warning preparedness meteorologist for Environment Canada, said the Ottawa area is on the very edge of the “weather bomb” system.\n“They do tend to form on the U.S. East Coast and if they happen to be just enough west, they will affect much of eastern Ontario and sometimes as far west as the GTA,” said Flisfeder. “But it really is a case-by-case basis.”\nThis low-pressure system is making its way up the U.S. East Coast on Wednesday afternoon and early evening, with rain expected to continue or intensify throughout the day. Rainfall warnings have been issued for the Ottawa area and other surrounding regions in light of the heavy precipitation predicted.\nThe first round of rain started in eastern Ontario and southern Quebec on Tuesday night, with another round hitting Wednesday into Thursday, according to the Weather Network.\n“It is expected that eastern Ontario will receive some fairly significant amounts of rain,” he said.\nThe Weather Network has warned that people should “brace for localized flooding and the risk for power outages.”\nRain totalling amounts near 30 millimetres is possible, especially east and southeast of Ottawa, according to the rainfall warning issued for the Ottawa area.\nThere will be a transition from rain to snow as temperatures cool down across eastern Ontario on Wednesday night. Snow is expected to continue Wednesday night into Thursday morning.\nFlisfeder explained that the ground, especially subsurface soil, is somewhat frozen.\n“That will hinder the ability for the soil to absorb that moisture, so you could expect a lot of ponding, especially on areas that had some snow melt from whatever snow had been on the ground,” he said.\nFlisfeder said behind this system, temperatures are expected to drop below the freezing mark in the next 24 hours or so — which could potentially lead to some slippery conditions.\n“It is going to be a gradual decrease,” he said. “It’s not going to be a flash freeze, but areas that are untreated could have some localized icy conditions. It’s going to be very important for drivers and pedestrians to make sure they’re taking precautions and staying on the slow side as they’re getting to where they’re going.”\nBy Friday, the weather looks to be sunny but cold following the weather bomb.\nWhat is a weather bomb?\nFlisfeder explains that in meteorology, atmospheric pressure is measured in hectopascals (hPa).\nA “weather bomb,” which can also be called a “bomb cyclone,” occurs when the pressure of a low-pressure system drops by at least 24 hectopascals within a period of 24 hours.\n“The simplest way of describing it is it’s a fairly rapid intensification of the strength of a low-pressure system,” he said.\nTypically, a high-pressure system pushes down on the earth’s surface, which inhibits the creation of clouds or storms; that inhibition is reduced or removed when there is a low-pressure system, which allows the air to rise and condense, leading to rain.\n“If the intensification of the low-pressure system is strong enough, these really strong systems can be associated with very strong winds most of the time,” he said.\nStrong storms are generally associated with low-pressure systems.\n“We can have a system coming toward Ontario and we can see it coming, say two, three, four days in advance and we know it’s going to be making its way,” he said.\n“As it approaches, it does decrease in the central pressure of the system. If that’s rapid enough, the weather associated can be much more significant.”\nDepending on the time of year, a weather bomb can create severe weather such as strong winds, or prolonged flurries or showers.\nWhy can Ontario get ‘weather bombs’?\nOntario does experience weather bombs, but generally with the help of the Maritimes.\n“Most likely, though, we get impacted by those Maritimes systems, where they’re extensive enough that a lot of eastern Ontario in particular feels the effects,” Flisteder said.\nWeather bombs are more common near the coasts, generally impacting British Columbia out west or the Maritimes provinces and eastern Quebec to the east.\n“It’s much more likely on the coast just because of the atmospheric setup,” he said. “Having the low-pressure system originate in a water body and then have cold air interact with it, that’s one of the really big factors that really helps with that rapid intensification of the storm.”\n— With files from Dominic Kurek",

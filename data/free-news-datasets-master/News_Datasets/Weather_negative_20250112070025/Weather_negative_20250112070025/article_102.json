By Justin Craft Published: Dec. 12, 2024 at 8:57 AM CST Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nNORTH PLATTE, Neb. (KNOP) - The National Weather Service has released its preliminary winter weather outlook, warning residents of potential hazards as the colder months approach.\nMeteorologists are closely monitoring conditions that could lead to hazardous winter storms, along with an elevated risk for ice jams along rivers and streams.\n“Ice jamming occurs quite frequently but thankfully the jams are usually not significant, said NWS Meteorologist Shawn Jacobs. “We don’t suggest people go anywhere near the river when there is ice forming or jamming up but they tend to be more of a nuisance for people with property along the river.”\nThe NWS urges people to remember safety first.\n“It’s a great reminder to stay off the ice on the rivers and it’s been warmer than normal and that ice and water underneath causes dangerous conditions,” said Jacobs. “So if the river is jamming up just use caution and stay away.”\nLastly, people should stay vigilant and ready for potential emergencies.\n“We want everybody to be prepared and have a plan because it’s a question of when winter storms will come here in Nebraska and people living in town and the farmers and ranchers who live in rural areas make sure to have a plan and be prepared,” said Jacobs.\nClick here to subscribe to our KNOP News 2 daily digest and breaking news alerts delivered straight to your email inbox.\nCopyright 2024 KNOP.

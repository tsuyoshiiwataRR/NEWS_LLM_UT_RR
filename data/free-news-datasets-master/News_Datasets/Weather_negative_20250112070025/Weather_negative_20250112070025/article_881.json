    "text": "KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI | AFP | Getty Images\nTravelers wait in line to check-in for their flights at the United Airlines Terminal 1 ahead of the Christmas Holiday at O'Hare International Airport on Dec. 22, 2022, in Chicago.\nThis holiday season won’t just be the most wonderful time of the year – it’ll also be record-breaking, with over 119 million people forecast to travel 50 or more miles away from home.\nThe projection is for 3 million more travelers than last year and 64,000 more than the previous record back in 2019, according to the auto club AAA .\nThe most popular mode of travel this holiday season will be by car, as 107 million are expected to drive between Dec. 21 and Jan. 1, a 12-day period that AAA notes is two days longer than the club’s defined holiday period in 2023 because of the days of the week on which Christmas and New Year’s Day fall.\nAir travel is expected to break last year’s record, with 7.85 million passengers flying during the 12-day timeframe, followed by 4.47 million people predicted to travel by train, bus and cruise – the highest amount in 20 years, according to AAA.\nTips for Holiday Travelers as New U.S. Consumer Protections Kick In Reuters Nov. 26, 2024\nAs over a hundred million people are expected to travel this holiday season, traffic delays on the roads and congestion in transit stations and airports will likely be heavier. The Transportation Security Administration is expecting to screen over 39 million people nationwide from Dec. 19 through Jan. 2.\nOn the roads, the worst traffic delays are expected to be on “the weekends before Christmas Day and New Year’s Day,” according to AAA and INRIX , a transportation analytics company. The delays nationwide could extend travel times by up to 30%. However, on those holidays themselves, as well as on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve, minimal traffic delays are expected.\n“With a near record number of auto travelers expected this holiday season, drivers should expect delays in and around major metro areas, with Sunday, December 22 expected to be the nation’s worst day to travel,” Bob Pishue, transportation analyst at INRIX, told AAA. “Our advice is to avoid traveling during peak commuting hours during the week. If schedules allow, leave bright and early or after the evening commute.”\nRegardless of when they leave, the millions of drivers this holiday season will benefit from lower gas prices compared to this same time last year, with the national average for a gallon of gas falling to $3.02 this week, just shy of breaking the $3 mark, which it reportedly hasn’t done nationally since May 2021.\nREAD:\nThe Best Christmas Light Displays\nThirty-one states, however, have average gas prices below $3 as of Dec. 13, according to AAA Fuel Prices . Oklahoma has the lowest average at $2.52, while Hawaii has the highest at $4.55. The state with the second highest gas price in the contiguous U.S. is California, with an average of $4.33 per gallon of regular gas.\nJoin the Conversation See Comments Tags: Christmas , Travel , holidays , Airlines\nRead More",

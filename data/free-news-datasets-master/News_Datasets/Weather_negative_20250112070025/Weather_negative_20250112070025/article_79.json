    "text": "First Alert: Freezing rain threat Friday night into Saturday with tough travel\nCEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (KCRG) - An icy mess is probable for much of eastern Iowa to kick off the weekend.\nYour First Alert: Winter Weather Advisory in effect Friday night\nThe rest of your Thursday evening is quiet, aside from a few leftover flurries early on. No travel trouble will come from this, and winds will remain on the light side. A gradual diminishing of the cloud cover we have is likely later on, and temperatures will be in the single digits above zero. Wind chills will stay below zero through mid-morning.\nThat partial clearing is short-lived, however, with new clouds moving in from the southwest. This is the first sign of our incoming storm system, though it’s well out ahead of its impacts. Instead, we’ll face a mostly cloudy sky during the day, as temperatures gradually warm throughout. Highs will be in the mid 20s, likely reached toward the end of the day.\nA Winter Weather Advisory goes into effect later on Friday evening into Saturday morning. This is for the area that is most likely to see ice accumulation from freezing rain and freezing drizzle.\nThe atmosphere will be working to overcome a bit of dry air initially, but should be able to do so by late in the evening. Precipitation will fall in a warm layer of the atmosphere above the ground, staying liquid until it reaches a shallow near-surface layer of air. When it hits any surface, it freezes on contact and begins to accumulate as ice.\nThis freezing rain will be the prominent precipitation type for the first several hours of this system, potentially mixing with a bit of snow at times. This could begin as early as about 9:00 or 10:00 p.m., but the chance really begins to increase after Midnight into the overnight hours.\nEasterly winds, at about 10 to 20 mph, will stave off additional warming that could end the freezing rain threat earlier. As a result, ice accumulation of as much as a couple of a tenths of an inch is possible for parts of the TV9 viewing area. The most likely area to see this would be between about Interstate 80 and U.S. Highway 20.\nEnough warm air begins to move into the state to move the line between an icy mess and just plain rain northward during the daylight hours of Saturday. This process will take some time, and the exact timing of that changeover will be tricky to nail down exactly. Many areas south of Highway 20 will see some improvement by about Noon, with others north of there holding onto the wintry mix into the afternoon.\nPrecipitation lingers into Saturday, though most of us will be seeing just rain at that stage. Only the far north could be hanging onto some of that snow mixing in. Because of the potential for snow to stick around longer, it’s our northern zones that could see some light snow accumulation. This further adds to the potential travel trouble.\nHow you should react to this storm system\nThe biggest hazard with freezing rain is the impact on travel, whether walking or in a vehicle. Avoid both, if possible, when icy conditions are present.\nIf you must drive, slow down! Give plenty of room between you and the vehicle in front of you. Avoid sudden braking or sharp turns which could cause you to lose traction. Approach intersections with extra caution. Pack [a winter survival kit](https://www.weather.gov/media/dmx/Preparedness/CarWinterSurvivalKitChecklist.pdf) if you drive away from populated areas.\nIf you head out on foot, pay especially close attention to untreated paved surfaces, including sidewalks and parking lots. These can be slicker than they appear. Use a railing for balance if available, or consider walking in the grass where the plant life provides some additional traction. Wear appropriate footwear to help decrease the chance of a fall.\nWe also recommend the [KCRG-TV9 First Alert Weather App](https://www.kcrg.com/page/download-our-app/), which can give you customized alerts for your location, as well as road conditions available from a button on the home screen of the app. Of course, we’ll also provide updates on KCRG.com and KCRG-TV9 as conditions warrant.\nGenerally quieter with a few precipitation chances\nAfter this storm system exits the region, warmer air will continue to move in. This pushes our highs pretty decently above normal by Sunday into Monday, with lows in the 30s and highs in the low to mid 40s for most. Clouds will remain common, however.\nAnother disturbance brings a shot at some showers late on Sunday night into Monday. Our air should be warm enough to avoid any icy issues with this round, and the heaviest precipitation will fall to the east and southeast of the viewing area.\nAnother break is likely on Tuesday as cooler air makes a return. The downward trend in temperatures continues for the remainder of the 9-day. Most of us will experience lows in the 10s and 20s, with highs in the upper 20s to mid 30s, during this stretch of time.\nA storm system could bring a shot at some snow by the middle of the week on Wednesday. This outcome isn’t fully certain, however, with some significant differences among the computer models we use to help make our forecasts on the timing and path of the system. We’ll keep a close eye on it and bring you the latest as we know it.\nCopyright 2024 KCRG. All rights reserved.",

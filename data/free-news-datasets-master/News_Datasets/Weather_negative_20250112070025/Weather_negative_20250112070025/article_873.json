    "text": "Environment Canada warns a powerful windstorm could topple trees and cause power outages across the Lower Mainland.\nMeteorologist Chris Doyle tells V.I.A. the department issued a special weather statement Friday, warning locals about a potent windstorm headed to Metro Vancouver starting Saturday morning (Dec. 14).\nDoyle says the low-pressure system is \"fairly deep\" thanks to its path across north-central Vancouver Island to the Lower Mainland.\n\"As it tracks across the Island on this route it picks up [significant] wind in the Strait of Georgia [on its way to the region],\" he explains.\nMetro Vancouver weather forecast includes damaging winds\nThe wind will develop early Saturday morning, gusting up to 100 km/h in some areas and easing in the afternoon. The gusty winds could damage buildings (such as roof shingles and windows), toss loose objects, and topple trees, according to the weather warning.\nHigh winds may also cause power outages and hazardous driving conditions.\nDoyle says another storm system is expected to make its way into the Lower Mainland on Wednesday. However, the timing and details of the event remain uncertain.\nStay up-to-date with hyperlocal forecasts across 50 neighbourhoods in the Lower Mainland with V.I.A.'s Weatherhood.",

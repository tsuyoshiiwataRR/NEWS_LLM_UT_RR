    "text": "Keep the umbrellas nearby today and tomorrow , North Texans. A weather system approaching Dallas-Fort Worth will bring increased moisture to the area Friday, creating patchy drizzle but no measurable rain, forecasts show. Temperatures will be in the upper-50s and 60. Showers and isolated thunderstorms will develop Friday night and into Saturday morning, according to the National Weather Service in Fort Worth. Areas east of the metroplex may experience thunderstorms with more substantial downpours, KXAS-TV (NBC5) meteorologists predict. The storms are expected to end from west to east as a weak cold front passes through, making way for sunshine and temperatures to climb into the upper 60s and lower 70s. Sunday should be a warm day with lots of sunshine before another system increases cloud cover and rain chances in Dallas. The possibility of rain lingers into next week with the best chances on Monday and Wednesday as a cold front blows through the area, according to the weather service. The storms likely won’t become severe. Today - Sat: Patchy drizzle and mild temps in the upper 50s & 60s. Showers & isolated storms will develop tonight with the best chances across North & Northeast Texas.

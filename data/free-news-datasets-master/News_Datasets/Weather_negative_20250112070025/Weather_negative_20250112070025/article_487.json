    "text": "WEATHER ALERT\nENVIRONMENT CANADA\n*************************\nSnow squall warning continued for:\n- Searchmont - Montreal River Harbour - Batchawana Bay\n- Sault Ste. Marie - St. Joseph Island\nCurrent details:\nLake effect snow squalls continue today.\nHazards:\nAdditional local snowfall accumulations of 10 to 20 cm by tonight.\nPeak snowfall rates of 3 to 6 cm per hour.\nVery poor visibility at times in heavy snow.\nTiming:\nEnding tonight.\nDiscussion:\nSnow squalls off Lake Superior will persist through much of the day today. Travel along portions of highway 17 between Sault Ste. Marie and Montreal River Harbour will remain hazardous until snow squall activity begins to weaken this evening.\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\nConsider postponing non-essential travel until conditions improve.\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to [[email protected]]https://www.sootoday.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#eca3a29f98839e81ac898fc28b8fc28f8d or tweet reports using #ONStorm.\n*************************",

    "text": "Today: It is another cold morning with lows in the single digits to slightly below zero thanks to clear skies and a light east wind that is dropping wind chills to around 10 degrees below zero. While temperatures do steadily warm through today into tonight, most of the day will still be cold with afternoon temps in the teens to low 20s and wind chills in the single digits. Winds pick up from the east-southeast at 5 to 15 mph, gusting to 25 mph. Clouds increase through the day.\nA Storm Track 7 Red ALERT DAY has been issued from tonight to Saturday morning due to a wintry mix of freezing rain, sleet, and snow leading to ice accumulations of a tenth inch to 0.3” and snowfall accumulations up to around 1”. North of Highway 20, maximum snowfall amounts could range from 1 to 3”. This is a significant amount of ice expected that could make travel nearly impossible, especially on untreated roads. Bridges/overpasses, sidewalks, driveways, and parking lots could become pure ice and very slippery. Ice may coat power lines and trees and could lead to power outages and tree damage.\nTonight [ICE STORM WARNING]: The freezing rain starts in the west/south and moves north/east through the night. Start time could be around 10 PM at the earliest with most of the area seeing it within a few hours after midnight. Temperatures are in the low to mid 20s at the start of the event and climb to the low 30s by sunrise, allowing for the significant ice accumulation. The winds are stronger from the east-southeast at 10 to 20 mph, gusting to 30 mph, which can lead to more damage on ice coated power lines and trees.\nSaturday [ICE STORM WARNING]: Temperatures are slow to climb above freezing and overall highs are looking cooler, but in the mid 30s by the later afternoon/evening. The wintry mix of freezing rain/sleet/snow gradually turns to rain for areas south of Highway 20 and a rain/snow mix north of Highway 20. Therefore, the ice concerns continue through the morning and should improve in the afternoon to an extent. If we do end up seeing more of the snow and cold temperatures near freezing in the north, overall snowfall accumulations could end up in the 1 to 3” range there. Most of this wraps up Saturday night.\nSunday: Cloudy with highs in the mid 30s to near 40. There is a chance for some rain clipping the area Sunday night.\n- Brandon",

    "text": "Millions of Australians will be hit by an intense heatwave this weekend, with temperatures topping 40C in several parts of the country.\nThe northerly winds have produced a mass of dry, hot air that will move from the interior to the east and southeast of the country.\nMelbourne is expected to reach almost 40C on Monday and temperatures will rise to 30C on Sunday. This will be the first day of the year with 40°C in the city.\nAdelaide will also endure a scorching weekend, with temperatures topping 27C on Friday and topping 36C on both Sunday and Monday.\nThe sweltering heat will affect parts of north-west Victoria, western New South Wales and the northeast and eastern regions of South Australia.\nTemperatures in Sydney are already rising with the city forecast to face five consecutive sunny days with temperatures above 28C starting this Friday.\nMeanwhile, central areas of South Australia and the Northern Territory are bracing for extreme conditions on Sunday, with temperatures expected to reach a scorching 50C.\n“This weekend we will see temperatures approaching five to 10C above average across much of South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales,” Bureau of Meteorology senior meteorologist told Nine. Miriam Bradbury.\nGet ready: a scorching heatwave will sweep through Australia this weekend, with temperatures reaching 40 degrees in several regions.\nMelbourne is bracing for its first 40C day of the year, with temperatures expected to rise from Monday.\n‘Monday will be the hottest day, with temperatures up to 16 degrees above average.\n“Other parts of Victoria and New South Wales could be in the mid-40s, and inland New South Wales could even reach 40 degrees on Monday,” Bradbury said.\nDue to the heatwave, widespread high fire danger warnings have been issued in parts of the south-east of the country, including WA, South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales.\n“Along with the heat, windy conditions and lack of rain are likely to cause an increase in fire danger across much of the Southeast.”\nAs sweltering heat grips southern and western states, the north faces intense thunderstorms and heavy rain flooding areas of Queensland and the Northern Territory.\nBrisbane will have a wet weekend with rain with temperatures expected to top 28C. The drizzle should clear next Thursday.\nPerth experienced extreme heat earlier this week, reaching 40C on Wednesday.

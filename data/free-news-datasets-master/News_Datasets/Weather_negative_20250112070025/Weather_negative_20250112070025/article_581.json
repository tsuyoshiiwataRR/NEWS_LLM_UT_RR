    "text": "Heavy snowfall and poor road conditions have halted school buses in parts of cottage country on Friday morning.\nSchool buses in Gravenhurst and West Parry Sound are cancelled for Friday.\nParts of Ontario may see more than 80 centimetres of snow by Friday, Environment Canada forecasted.\nHow much more snow is expected to fall?\nAreas southeast of Georgian Bay could see up to 30 centimetres of snow by Friday night as Environment Canada issues [weather warnings](https://weather.gc.ca/?layers=alert&zoom=7¢er=45.47027927,-79.87092729).\nTravel is expected to be “nearly impossible at times,” the agency said.\nCottage country storms\nRegions around Stratford, Owen Sound, Parry Sound, Gravenhurst and Bracebridge, Ont., are expected to be the hit the hardest and experience “hazardous lake-effect snow squalls,” Environment Canada warned.\nEarlier this month, [cottage country was hit](https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/snowstorms-in-muskoka-cottage-country-drop-more-than-a-metre-of-snow-highway-11-remains/article_5aa35fb8-afdf-11ef-a6f9-fb6f29c221c2.html) with intense squalls that dumped more than 140 centimetres of snow and left drivers stranded on the roads, including Highway 11, for over 24 hours.\n“I’m just going to say it. Really?” said OPP Sgt. Ed Sanchuk in a [video on X](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1YpJklYzpDoxj) Wednesday night, warning drivers about the storms. “I’m still shaking my head at 50-plus centimetres of snow.”\nSanchuk says that temperatures will feel like -20 C and drivers should stay home if they can.\nThe national weather agency says that road closures are likely and advises residents to just stay home. If you must travel, it is recommended to tell others your schedule, carry an emergency kit and stay in your vehicle if you do get trapped in the snow.",

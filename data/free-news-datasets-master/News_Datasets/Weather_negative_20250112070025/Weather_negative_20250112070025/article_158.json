    "text": "When it comes to Friday’s weather, it’s all on the table. And the streets, sidewalks and windshields. Rain, freezing rain or drizzle, even snow, are all possible, according to the National Weather Service in Hastings. York stands an 82% chance of receiving some form of precipitation, most likely a rain and snow mix, which brings with it the greatest chance of ice accumulation. Anything from a light glaze to 0.1 of an inch of ice is not out of the question, according to the weather service. In fact, meteorologists say ice accumulations are “very likely” across the area. For York, the weather service gives a 92% chance of 0.01 of an inch to 26% chance of 0.1 of an inch of ice. As for timing, look for a 35% chance of rain around noon Friday, shifting to a 35% chance of snow by 3 p.m. and a 65% chance of snow by 6 p.m. People are also reading… Rain or snow may continue overnight and into Saturday morning, with the weather service forecasting a 25% chance. But, as you break out the ice melt, take all this with a grain of salt. “There is some uncertainty in the exact placement of the coldest air that keeps precipitation type confidence on the lower end,” the weather service said. “A few degrees change in the temperature can greatly impact precipitation type.” York is forecast for a high of 34 degrees on Friday, dropping to a low of 25 degrees overnight. From Friday afternoon through Saturday morning, the chance for precipitation of any form ranges from 20% to 80% for a large swath of central and eastern Nebraska. The percentages rise as the forecast moves from the southwest to northeast. Areas to the north, such as Broken Bow, are forecast to receive primarily snow, while areas south of the state line will receive primarily rain, the weather service said. Despite the chances for ice or snow in your area, you can improve your odds of staying safe as you hit the roads — or even step outside on the porch — by behaving as if surfaces are slick. AAA offers the following tips for driving on slick surfaces: - Drive slowly. Always adjust your speed down to account for lower traction when driving on snow or ice. - Accelerate and decelerate slowly. Apply the gas slowly to regain traction and avoid skids. Don’t try to get moving in a hurry and take time to slow down for a stoplight. Remember: It takes longer to slow down on icy roads. - Increase your following distance to five to six seconds. This increased margin of safety will provide the longer distance needed if you have to stop.",

    "text": "By Allan Nosoff ,\n50 minutes ago\n\"\nTemperatures tumbled from the 60s to the 30s Wednesday night and will continue to dip down to the 20s overnight. It remains breezy, but not as windy as the last 24 hours. The combination of the cold and gusts will make it feel frigid for the Friday morning commute. Feels-like temperatures will once again be in the teens so make sure to be bundled up with appropriate winter attire, including hats, scarves, and mittens. It will be feeling like the 20s all day long despite actual high temperatures reaching 35 degrees. It will be even colder Friday night with lows down to the mid-20s, again feeling like the teens. Improvements begin this weekend with highs in the upper-30s Saturday and feeling like above freezing for the first time since Wednesday evening. Sunday will be even warmer and nicer with highs approaching 50 degrees. A high of 60 degrees is possible by Tuesday, but there will be a few showers late Monday into early Tuesday. It gets colder again behind these showers with a much colder pattern potentially setting up into the weekend before Christmas with a snow or rain chance just before Christmas. Stay tuned for updates. \" Be the first to react",

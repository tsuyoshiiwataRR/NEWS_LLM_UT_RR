    "text": "Friday and Saturday are First Alert Weather Days as we are forecasting to see sleet and freezing rain\nSIOUX CITY (KTIV) -\nTODAY, TONIGHT, AND\nTOMORROW’S FORECAT:\nMuch of your Friday will be quiet, cloudy, breezy, and cold, but our attention turns to the later hours of Friday as we are forecasting sleet and ice to impact all of Siouxland.\nThe National Weather Service has put all of Siouxland under a Winter Weather Advisory starting Friday afternoon and lasting into early Saturday.\nTiming this out, we will start to see wintry weather moving in around 5 PM along and south of HWY 20.\nBy 7 and 8 PM, that is when we will see more widespread winter weather impacting Siouxland.\nThe pink color on radar is the wintry mix of sleet and freezing rain.\nThe wintry mix continues into the overnight hours of Friday.\nEarly Saturday morning, we could see another round of wintry mix moving in.\nAgain, this could be either sleet or freezing rain falling across Siouxland.\nAs of right now, this is what we are forecasting to see when it comes to ice.\nIf you live in the yellow, you could see a glaze of a tenth of an inch of ice.\nIf you live in the orange, you could see the most impacts of the ice. We are forecasting y’all to get between a tenth of an inch to up to a quarter of an inch of ice.\nThis will cause a lot of traveling issues this weekend.\nWe are forecasting to mainly see ice and sleet, but there is a small chance of seeing some light snow.\nFor the most part, snow amounts will stay less than one inch.\nBecause of all of the winter weather, we have issued a First Alert Weather Day for Friday and Saturday.\nOnce again, the main focus out of this storm will be the ice and sleet.\nBesides the wintry weather, your Friday will mostly be quiet as clouds increase throughout the day.\nWinds will pick up as well, making it breezy and somewhat cold during the day.\nHighs will be in the mid to low 20s.\nThen by the afternoon and evening, the sleet and freezing rain will begin to move in.\nTonight’s focus will be the sleet and freezing rain falling across Siouxland.\nLows will fall into the teens and low 20s.\nWe are forecasting to see a trace to just under a quarter of an inch of ice.\nYour Saturday will start with a wintry mix of sleet and freezing rain, but as the day progresses, the wintry mix will end.\nHighs will be flirting around 32 degrees during the day on Saturday.\nEXTENDED FORECAST:\nWhatever falls Friday and Saturday will stick around through Saturday night and into Sunday.\nThe good news is that things will melt by Sunday and Monday. We are forecasting highs to climb into the 40s.\nBy the end of next week, cold air arrives again as highs will be in the 20s and 30s.\nStay with KTIV for the most up-to-date look at your forecast.\nCopyright 2024 KTIV.

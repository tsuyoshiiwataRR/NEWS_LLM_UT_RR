    "text": "By Ted Phaeton ,\n13 hours ago\nCHARLOTTE (QUEEN CITY NEWS) ‚Äì BRRR! After the rain comes the cold!\nWe are much colder this morning with a 30-degree gap between yesterday morning and today. The difference in temperatures match the current temperatures that we‚Äôre feeling as the low 30s and upper 20s take hold.\nClick here to see our latest Pinpoint Weather forecast! üå§Ô∏èüå¶Ô∏è Winds are still breezy in our higher elevations making for single-digit wind chills in our mountain counties. Bundle up this morning as a cold start will lead to a cool finish with highs aimed for the low 50s and upper 40s. Look for the mountains to peak in the 30s for this afternoon which will keep us cold for most of the day.\nTonight will be frigid yet again as lows dip into the 20s from our mountains to uptown heading into Friday. Clouds will build heading into the weekend with Friday peaking in the low 50s to end the work week.\nThis weekend will be cool and cloudy with Saturday hitting the mid-50s and winds picking up a bit out of the northeast. Sunday will only hit the upper 40s as spotty showers finish off the weekend.\n60s will return on Monday with intermittent rain chances lingering for the start of the work week. 50s and sunshine move back in by mid-week for Wednesday.\nToday: Mostly Clear & Cool. High: 51.\nTonight: Clear & Cold. Low: 29.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

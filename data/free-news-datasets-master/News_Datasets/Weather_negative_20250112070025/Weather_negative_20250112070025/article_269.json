    "text": "Delhi Shivers as Winter Chill Bites, Pollution Worsens\nDelhi experiences a significant dip in temperatures, recording 4.9°C, its coldest morning. Minimum temperatures vary due to wind differences, meanwhile, air pollution levels deteriorate, with AQI reaching 'poor' categories. Snow blankets Sonamarg, Jammu, as other northern regions brace for a cold wave.\n- Country:\n- India\nThe capital city of Delhi is grappling with a severe winter chill as temperatures plummet to 4.9°C, marking the coldest December morning so far. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), wind variations are causing fluctuating minimum temperatures, particularly in remote areas like Patiala and Rohtak, which experienced a 2°C rise.\nThe majority of Northwest India remains unaffected by this temperature shift, while air quality in Delhi deteriorates to 'poor' levels amid persistent fog and smog. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reveals worrying AQI levels: 309 in Anand Vihar and 334 in Nehru Nagar, raising health concerns among residents.\nElsewhere, snow has blanketed Sonamarg in Jammu and Kashmir, adding a picturesque layer to the ongoing weather disturbances. Meanwhile, Rajasthan braces for a cold wave, with warming fires becoming a common sight. These unpredictable cold conditions are expected to impact multiple regions from December 12-16, including Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\n- READ MORE ON:\n-\n[Delhi](/news?tag=Delhi) -\n[winter](/news?tag=winter) -\n[temperature](/news?tag=temperature) -\n[air quality](/news?tag=air+quality) -\n[pollution](/news?tag=pollution) -\n[Northwest India](/news?tag=Northwest+India) -\n[cold wave](/news?tag=cold+wave) -\n[IMD](/news?tag=IMD) -\n[fog](/news?tag=fog) -\n[snowfall](/news?tag=snowfall)\nALSO READ\n[Kashmir's Cold Wave: Sub-Zero Nights Grip the Valley](/article/science-environment/3173833-kashmirs-cold-wave-sub-zero-nights-grip-the-valley)[Air pollution: SC says all GRAP IV measures except relating to schools will continue to operate till Dec 2 .](/article/Newsalert/3174225-air-pollution-sc-says-all-grap-iv-measures-except-relating-to-schools-will-continue-to-operate-till-dec-2)[Air pollution: SC asks Punjab govt to instruct its officers not to advise farmers to burn stubble after 4pm to avoid satellite detection.](/article/Newsalert/3174248-air-pollution-sc-asks-punjab-govt-to-instruct-its-officers-not-to-advise-farmers-to-burn-stubble-after-4pm-to-avoid-satell)[Air pollution: SC says court commissioner report shows 'abject failure' of authorities to implement GRAP IV curbs in letter and spirit.](/article/Newsalert/3174231-air-pollution-sc-says-court-commissioner-report-shows-abject-failure-of-authorities-to-implement-grap-iv-curbs-in-letter-a)[Delhi's Battle Against Pollution: CAQM Enforces Stricter Measures](/article/headlines/3174260-delhis-battle-against-pollution-caqm-enforces-stricter-measures)",

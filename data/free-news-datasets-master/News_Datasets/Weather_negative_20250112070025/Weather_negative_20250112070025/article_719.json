    "text": "New York State declared a state of emergency for portions of Western New York, Finger Lakes, Central New York and North Country regions as forecasts call for those areas to receive multiple feet of lake effect snow.\nAreas east of Lakes Erie and Ontario could see two to three feet of snow along with strong wind gusts of 30-45 mph continuing through Saturday.\nLast month, the state declared an emergency as the Buffalo and the Great Lakes region got slammed with lake effect snow of as much as five feet in some places.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, areas within the lake effect snow bands will experience near-zero visibility at times and covered roadways will make travel extremely hazardous, if not impossible.\nIn addition, the eastern portion of the state including the Hudson Valley, New York City and Long Island are seeing wind gusts surpassing 50 mph in some places. The state expressed concern about potential power outages and localized flash flooding.\nTopics\n[New York](/location/new-york/)\nWas this article valuable?\nHere are more articles you may enjoy.",

By Pete Mangione Published: Dec. 13, 2024 at 10:53 AM MST | Updated: 3 hours ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nPHOENIX (AZFamily) — If it seems like it’s been a long time since it’s rained in Phoenix, that’s because it has been a long time. The last time measurable rain fell at Sky Harbor was on Aug. 22! That puts us at 112 consecutive days without measurable rain.\nPhoenix Dry Streak (3TV/CBS 5) (There was a trace of rain on a couple of days in early November, but it was not enough to measure. Therefore, it goes into the record books as zero.) The dry stretch has us sitting at 2.24 inches below normal for the year.\nWe are still not all that close to the all-time record for consecutive rainless days. From Dec. 30, 1971, to June 6, 1972, Phoenix had 160 days of consecutive rainless days! Our current dry streak ranks 16th out of 128 years of records.\nDry Consecutive Days in Phoenix (3TV/CBS 5) The chance of rain is near zero for the next few days, and there is currently no sign of a wetter weather pattern returning. Hopefully that will change and keep us from moving up the list.\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

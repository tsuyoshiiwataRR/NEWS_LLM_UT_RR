    "text": "It’s that time of year again when Victorians string up their Christmas lights and set up their Christmas trees to celebrate the holiday season.\nBut the state’s fire services are warning that the fun and festivities also come with the potential for serious fire hazards.\nBoth the Country Fire Authority and Fire Rescue Victoria are urging Victorians to check their Christmas lights before using them.\nCFA chief officer Jason Heffernan said Christmas lights needed to be thoroughly inspected for damage before being hung on trees and homes.\n“Christmas lights are a wonderful way to brighten up Christmas but use year after year can result in frayed wires, damaged bulbs, and other wear and tear that makes them unsafe for the tree or your home,” he said.\n“Turn your lights off before you go to sleep or leave the house to ensure they don’t overheat and consider using battery operated or solar lights that don’t require electricity.” \nFRV deputy commissioner community safety Joshua Fischer said it was also important to closely check and monitor any decorations containing a lithium-ion battery.\n“Lithium-ion battery powered decorations and appliances have become increasingly popular, and we just want to ensure everyone is using them as safely as possible,” he said.\n“Only buy products from reputable suppliers, use the charging cords supplied with the device and only charge items outdoors or in rooms with a smoke alarm.”\nOther Christmas safety tips include making sure trees are not located close to heat sources, curtains or furnishings and avoid overloading power boards.\nFor further information on lithium-ion battery safety, visit: www.frv.vic.gov.au/battery-safety",

    "text": "ELLSWORTH -- Downed trees and poles knocked out power to one of the Ellsworth area's busiest strips, causing businesses and schools to shut down.\n\"We had some high winds obviously come through last night with the rain and it did snap a utility pole on high street,\" said Ellsworth Deputy Police Chief, Shawn Willey.\nAlong Route 1, damage from Wednesday night's storm left a trail of darkness, forcing Ellsworth schools and multiple businesses to close.\n\"I would say most of the places are still open, been in a couple places and they're dark but they're doing what we are, making the most of it, nobody can afford to close for the day so we're here for it,\" said Scott Polley, manager of the Ellsworth Napa Auto Parts.\nWhile some were forced to close, many businesses did what they had to, to keep the doors open.\n\"A lot of the guys are wearing head lights, flash lights, we're using pen and paper instead of computers obviously but we're here for the customers bottom line,\" said Polley.\nMore from this section +8 The Cost of Health Insurance for Employees and Employers by State",

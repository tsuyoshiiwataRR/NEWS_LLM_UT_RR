Good morning, West Michigan! Today is a WEATHER ALERT DAY, one of two back-to-back. Though we'll see areas of snow this morning and early afternoon, the impactful weather for this alert day won't arrive in full force until late in the afternoon. A cold front will arrive around sunset triggering snow showers. Behind the front, the coldest air we've had since last January plows into West Michigan, triggering numerous lake effect snow showers in west to east oriented snow bands. The snow will likely be heavy at times through Thursday morning, when a shift in the wind will quickly shut down the snow bands. But before that happens, some parts of West Michigan, especially in the snow belt west of US 131, may see up to 10\\\" of snow. Add to that a sometimes-gusty west wind, and you have a recipe for hazardous driving with icy, snow-covered roads, and periods of reduced visibility. Occasional whiteouts are possible. The snow ends quickly Thursday, diminishing by early afternoon thanks to a shift in the wind. Our best chance for sunshine -- and it isn't great -- is Friday as temperatures start to warm. A wintry mix in the morning is how we begin Saturday with freezing rain possibly playing a part. Temps warm to the upper 30s Saturday and lower 40s Sunday, both afternoon's having a chance for rain. Meteorologist Jeff Porter updates the outlook LIVE this morning on News Channel 3. Catch his LIVE reports from 4:30 to 9:00. Have a wonderful Wednesday! \",\"forecast\":",

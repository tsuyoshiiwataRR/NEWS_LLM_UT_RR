    "text": "We’re waking up to clouds clearing this morning, but temperatures are considerably colder than they were at this time yesterday morning. We’re in the mid 20s to start, but with the wind it’ll feel it’s about 20 degrees for a good part of the morning. Later this afternoon we’ll see plenty of sunshine. However, temperatures go almost nowhere from where they start this morning– highs will hardly be above freezing! At least it will be an overall sunny day.\nOvernight tonight lows will drop into the teens! We’ll be mostly clear though, which is great news because tonight/tomorrow is the peak of the Geminid Meteor Shower. In areas of low light pollution, you could see up to 120 meteors per hour. Incredible!\nThis weekend will remain cold. Saturday will be mostly sunny with highs, once again, barely above freezing. Sunday will be in the upper 30s, but clouds move in throughout the afternoon. This leads to a mostly cloudy Monday, with showers arriving late in the day. Temperatures Monday afternoon will be in the mid 40s. Tuesday will be wet, with periods of rain throughout the day. At least it won’t be cold, with high temperatures Tuesday in the low to mid 50s!\nCategories : News , Weather Forecast Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin Related South Kingstown police continue to investigate accident involving pedestrian Mimi's Diner in Taunton looking for alleged break-in suspect A Frigid Friday and Cold Weekend Ahead!

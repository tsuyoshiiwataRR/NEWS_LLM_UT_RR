    "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. — [Weather ](/weather/)conditions [forecast ](/article/weather/forecast/sacramento-weather-forecast-today-tomorrow-10-days/103-a7933aeb-4e94-4afb-99cb-7b25af0590e4)for the [Sacramento ](/section/sacramento)region will be very active, with a strong storm moving through the area. An inch or more of valley rain is possible between Friday and Saturday and 1-3 ft. of snow down to 5,000 ft. will blanket the Sierra Saturday. If you have weekend plans, this is an important forecast with some gaps to take advantage of as well. WHEN Light rain is possible and snow early Friday, but there will be a gap for the valley late in the day before the storm ramps up. Any travel in the Sierra Friday will include light snow, with more snow expected into the evening and heavy snow overnight. This storm really comes together early Saturday and through the early afternoon with heavy rain, strong winds with 30-40 mph gusts and heavy snow. ► Stay up to date with the forecast and weather impact team with the ABC10+ streaming app. Here's how to[ download it for free](/article/about-us/ways-to-watch/103-3d52e2e3-d05f-45f8-9133-26ceb89d605d). IMPACT Wind should be given extra attention during this storm because it amplifies the impacts of rain and snow. The wind will be strongest between 10 p.m. Friday and noon Saturday. Gusts could exceed 30-40 mph and cause driving issues, downed limbs and trees, and some damage or outages. Strong wind is a risk, so pay attention and watch where you walk and park. Rain will be heavy at times, creating dangerous road conditions. Localized flooding is a risk with clogged drains and ponding on roads. Snow will be heaviest from 1 p.m. Friday to 10 p.m. Saturday, with likely chain controls, slick roads, crashes and momentary closures due to safety, visibility or crashes. Expect delays during this time.

Some events will have major weather happening, so plan for that reality. Driving in the Sierra will be slow, slippery and heavily impacted. If you have not driven in conditions like this, or your vehicle is not well suited for this, travel is strongly discouraged.

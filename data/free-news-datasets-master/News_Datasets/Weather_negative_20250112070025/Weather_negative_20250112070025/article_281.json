    "text": "‘We’ve had a week’: Warm temps, lack of snow impacting skiing in Anchorage, mushing in Western Alaska\nANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - While some may have enjoyed the recent warm weather that has taken over much of the state, the temperatures and precipitation have greatly affected outdoor enthusiasts who use the variety of pristine trails offered in Alaska.\nWhile the first prep ski race of the season was held at Service High School last weekend, much of the hillside trails are unskiable as of this week.\n“The temperature was sustained higher, [with] higher winds up there and rain, so those trails have been reduced — a lot of ground is showing, a lot of ice, so it is not really skiable up there at the moment,” Kikkan Randall, Olympian and Executive Director of the Nordic Ski Association of Anchorage said.\nMeanwhile, one of the few skiable places in the Anchorage area is the world-class trails at Kincaid Park, but that is only because of snowfall at the beginning of the season and the snow-making machines that churned out additional — albeit artificial — snow last month.\n“The conditions are hanging in there for the moment,” Randall, the 2018 Winter Olympics gold medalist, said. “We have this big snow gun behind me, we did a lot of snowmaking work back in November when we had colder temperatures, and that is turning out to be our saving grace here, because anywhere we have the snowmaking depth, the snow is there.\nOther places ... are getting really thin, a lot of water coming up, so the best skiing in town is [at Kincaid], other trails in town have not faired so well.”\nA high school ski race scheduled for Saturday at the Beach Lake Trails in Chugiak has been moved to Kincaid as of Thursday. Kincaid is also set to host the [U.S. Cross-Country Ski Championships](https://usnationalsanchorage2025.com/) Jan. 2-7, 2025.\nIn Western Alaska, the active mushing community has had a delayed start to their season. [Kuskokwim 300](https://www.k300.org/) Executive Director Paul Basile said while the temperatures have been ideal this week, the previous combination of warm weather, lack of snow and high winds have exposed grass and left little to no trails suitable for mushing.\n“They’re struggling,” Basile said about teams trying to get in valuable training. “In talking with a few recently, there have been extended stretches where they are not able to train at all, or in very limited fashion. Then we get a bit of snow and they’re out on the trailing getting into a groove finally, then it’s 40 degrees again for a few days.”\nThe Kuskokwim 300 Race Committee hosts seven races annually in the area. The first race of the Delta Championship Series had to be postponed with no rescheduled date in sight yet.\n“Just a lot of patience and flexibility right now,” Basile said. “That’s really all we can do.”\nSee a spelling or grammar error?

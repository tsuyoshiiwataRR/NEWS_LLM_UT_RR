    "text": "FIRST ALERT: Ice and snow to impact early weekend travel\nIcy roads and surfaces likely tonight through Saturday\nWe are tracking a winter storm system that will bring light snow, light freezing rain/drizzle and sleet to much of our region this evening through Saturday. Overall precipitation won’t be heavy but will be enough to create slippery roads and surfaces, creating hazardous travel conditions across much of southern Minnesota and northern Iowa. Sleet and snow accumulation will generally be around or less than an inch with around a tenth of an inch or less of ice accumulation possible. A winter weather advisory is in effect for much of central and southern Minnesota and much of the state of Iowa from this evening through much of Saturday. If you must travel, be prepared for very icy roads. Stay tuned for updates. The KEYC First Alert Weather Team will be watching the system closely and will be here with local weather updates on the app, KEYC.com and on KEYC WeatherNow channel 12.4 as things develop.\nDETAILS BELOW:\nLatest Watches, Warnings and Advisories\nA winter storm system will move from the Rockies and across southern Iowa tonight into Saturday, bringing a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain/drizzle that will make travel difficult Friday night through much of Saturday. There isn’t a lot of moisture with this system. In fact, if all of the precipitation were to come in the form of snow, we’d be looking at around an inch, maybe up to 2 in a few spots. The challenge is warm air getting pulled into the middle layers of the atmosphere. This will make things a bit messy as we transition from sleet to snow to freezing rain and drizzle. A Winter Weather Advisory is in effect for central and southern Minnesota and northern Iowa from Friday evening through much of Saturday. The advisory is along and south of a line from the northern Twin Cities metro to Marshall. In the Mankato/North Mankato area, the Winter Weather Advisory is in effect from 9pm Friday evening through noon Saturday. You can find times and information for your specific location on the KEYC First Alert Weather app and at KEYC.com when you click the weather alerts banner toward the top of the page.\nTIMING:\nAreas of sleet and snow will develop and move from southwest to northeast across our region this evening. In the Mankato/North Mankato area, areas of sleet and snow will arrive by mid to late evening. Arrival times will be earlier southwest of Mankato and a bit later to the north and east. Areas of light snow and freezing drizzle will continue through late tonight with light snow and freezing rain and/or drizzle likely from late tonight through much of the day Saturday.\nPRECIPITATION AMOUNTS:\nAs I mentioned earlier, this is not a high-precipitation winter weather event. We’re only expecting around one to two tenths of an inch of moisture, which will likely end up being around an inch or less of sleet and snow with less than a tenth of an inch of ice. Ice amounts could be slightly higher further south where it is warmer. Snow and sleet amounts could be slightly higher with ice amounts being lower further north where it is colder.\nIMPACT:\nRoads and sidewalks will become icy and very slippery by mid to late Friday evening with icy conditions and hazardous travel conditions continuing through at least midday Saturday. Travel conditions will gradually improve Saturday afternoon into Saturday evening.\nEXTENDED FORECAST:\nSunday will be mostly cloudy but warmer with highs in the mid to upper 30s. We are watching another system that will have the potential to bring some light rain and snow on Monday afternoon into Monday night. After that, colder Canadian air will move into the region, keeping temperatures in the low to mid 20s through most of next week. Unfortunately, the chance of a white Christmas—beyond what we have now—isn’t looking great. But there is still hope. Christmas is still over 10 days away, and a lot can happen between now and then.\n[Click here to download the KEYC News Now app or our KEYC First Alert weather app.](https://www.keyc.com/page/keyc-apps-for-ios-and-android-devices/)\nCopyright 2024 KEYC.

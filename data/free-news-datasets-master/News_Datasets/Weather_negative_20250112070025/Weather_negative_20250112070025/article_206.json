Get the latest updates on weather, temperatures, and safety precautions for Bangalore.\nBengaluru: Bengaluru will experience continuous rain on Friday, according to the forecast from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). The department has issued a yellow alert for several districts in Karnataka, including Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Kolar, Chitradurga, Tumakuru, and Ramanagara. Most of these districts are expected to see a break from the rain after Friday. However, Dakshina Kannada and Udupi are forecasted to experience heavy downpours lasting until Saturday.\nAccording to IMD, due to the low-pressure area over the southeast Bay of Bengal and on the eastern Indian Ocean, the moisture-laden winds are heading towards the state, which is the main cause of this rainfall. Most of the south-interior districts of Karnataka are thus expected to experience light to moderate rainfall.\nWeather Forecast for Bengaluru\nThe weather forecast for the next few days in the city is generally cloudy with occasional light rain and mist. The temperature will range from a minimum of 18¬∞C to a maximum of 26¬∞C. It‚Äôs advisable to carry an umbrella and be prepared for light rain showers.\nDate | Min Temp | Max Temp | Weather |\n13-Dec | 19 | 25 | Generally cloudy sky with Light rain |\n14-Dec | 19 | 26 | Mist |\n15-Dec | 18 | 26 | Mist |\n16-Dec | 18 | 26 | Mist |\n17-Dec | 18 | 26 | Rain |\n18-Dec | 18 | 26 | Rain |\nOvercast weather conditions with spells of drizzles to moderate showers over Old Mysuru Region including Bengaluru city today üåßÔ∏è‚òî\nThen another LPA in the Bay of Bengal next week could likely give rains again\n[#KarnatakaRains][#BengaluruRains]‚Äî Karnataka Weather (@Bnglrweatherman)\n[December 12, 2024]\nIMD issues yellow alert in several districts\nThe Yellow alert is declared when there is potential for severe weather conditions over several days.

    "text": "First Alert 6 Weather day: Freezing drizzle spreads Friday evening, slick roads expected\nOMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - Today is a FIRST ALERT 6 WEATHER DAY due to the threat of freezing drizzle that is developing as of 3PM... it becomes more widespread as the night goes on.\nTemperatures have warmed despite the cold start and are around freezing for the metro as of 3PM and above freezing for many to the S of I-80. Despite the warm up, temperatures are expected to drop this evening as the freezing drizzle chances increase leading to ice accumulation and slick roads.\nFreezing drizzle chance will keep going up tonight with a light glaze coating things more and more after sunset.\nWidespread areas of 0.1″ of ice is what many of us can expect by the end of this event but a few spots north of I-80 could see higher amounts. Plan for only a light coating for most S of I-80 where the warmer air takes over earlier in the evening.\nWe should be able to warm just above 32 in the Metro by 1-2AM changing us over to a cold drizzle.\nThere could even be some lingering freezing rain north of I-80 to start Saturday further adding to the icing totals. We’ll warm to 36 by the afternoon and that should melt the ice.\nHighs by Sunday will be much warmer up into the 40s with hopefully a little sun breaking through.\nCopyright 2024 WOWT.

SHAIKMOHIDEEN\nTriggered by the well-marked low pressure area over Gulf of Mannar and another low pressure area over Lakshadweep-Maldives region coupled with upper air circulation, Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts experienced heavy downpour from late Thursday, completely disrupting the normal life of people.\nThe heavy rainfall in the western ghats region has significantly increased the water flow in the Tamirabarani river. Among the notable records, Oothu received a maximum of 540 mm of rainfall by 6 a.m. on Friday. Despite only 800 cusecs of water being released from the dams in Tirunelveli district, the water flow into the urban areas soared to an alarming 65,000 cusecs by Friday afternoon.\nIn Tirunelveli city, key locations such as Tirunelveli Junction Bus Stand and neighbouring areas of Katchi Mandapam were heavily inundated. Karuppanthurai low-lying bridge which connects Melapalayam and Town was submerged under the heavy outflow of water in the Tamirabarani river.\nColin, owner of a photo lab at Town Junction bus stand, expressed his concerns over recurring floods. He said the flooding was majorly due to rampant encroachments along the canal’s waterways. He added that his equipment worth ₹75 lakh had been damaged in the flood.\nAs a precautionary measure, the government has requested people living in low-lying areas and riverbanks to relocate to safer places. Officials warned that if the heavy rainfall continues in western ghats, water inflow into the urban areas could surge to one lakh cusecs.\nTenkasi In Tenkasi, the floodwaters caused by torrential rain have submerged crops in the fields surrounding Thanjavurkulam. The downpour has resulted in flooding rivers such as Chittar, Hanuman river, Rama nadhhi, Gadana nadhi and Karuppanadhi making many villages inaccessible.\nThe breach of Thanjavurkulam banks caused flooding on Kollam-Tirumangalam highway leading to traffic congestion with vehicles stranded on both sides of the road.\nEfforts to drain rainwater in Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts are in full swing. Officials are taking steps to restore the roads which went under water due to the floods.\nLater in the day, Municipal Administration Minister K.N. Nehru and Assembly Speaker M. Appavu inspected the flood-affected areas in Tirunelveli and urged officials to expedite the restoration work. Collector K.P. Karthikeyan was present during the inspection.\nIn Tenkasi, Revenue Minister K.K.S.S.R. Ramachandran inspected the flood-affected areas and met with 277 individuals from 77 families of ‘Narikuravar’ community who had been accommodated in the relief camp in Courtallam. Collector A.K. Kamal Kishore was present during the inspection.\nPublished - December 13, 2024 08:14 pm IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

    "text": "SPINE-chilling footage captures the shocking moment a bird flew into a plane engine triggering a huge fireball in mid-air.\nThe American Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing just minutes after takeoff.\nOfficials say the plane from New York's LaGuardia Airport was diverted following the terrifying mic-air incident and was redirected to nearby JFK.\nPassenger Crystal Groves Thomas, who was on the North Carolina-bound aircraft, captured footage of the moment the bird collided with the plane.\nAs the Airbus A321 made its ascent just after 7 pm on Thursday, December 12, a bird struck one of the engines, leading to an explosion.\nA heart-stopping clip posted on X shows the moment the engine sucks up the poor bird, which appears to catch fire and explode in flames.\nREAD MORE AIRCRAFT NEWS\nThe plane tilts to the side as terrified passengers watch on.\n\"I thought I was gonna die,\" Amy Stamper told the New York Post.\n\"There were a couple of small explosions, and then there was a fire,\" she added.\nAnother unnamed passenger said they saw \"two flames in the sky,\" and began to pray.\nMost read in The US Sun\nThe pilot's report to air traffic control was shared with ABC13 Eyewitness News.\n\"It appears we have an engine failure, but we're still kind of working through to figure out what's going on,\" they said.\n\"We hit birds on the way out.\"\nThe flight heading for Charlotte had 190 passengers and six crew members on board.\nNo one was injured in the incident.\nPassengers were put up in a local hotel until their rescheduled flight on Friday, December 13.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to The U.S. Sun's requests for comment.\nAMERICAN AIRLINES STATEMENT\nFOLLOWING a terrifying incident in which a bird flew into a plane engine triggering an emergency landing, American Airlines put out the following statement:\n\"American Airlines flight 1722 with service from New York's LaGuardia Airport (LGA) to Charlotte (CLT) diverted to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) due to a reported bird strike.\n\"The aircraft landed safely at JFK where it will be inspected by our maintenance team.\n\"We are grateful to our crew for their professionalism and apologize to our customers for the inconvenience this may have caused.\"\nThe shocking incident sparked similarities with the Miracle on the Hudson back in 2009.\nThat flight also took off from LaGuardia with a scheduled stop in Charlotte en route to Seattle.\nBut minutes after takeoff, a bird strike knocked out power to both of its engines.\nRead More on The US Sun\nThe miraculous quick-thinking of pilot Captain Chesley Sullenberger meant that the plane managed to glide and land safely on the Hudson River with no casualties.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration says bird strikes are increasing, with 19,400 strikes at 713 airports across the US last year alone.",

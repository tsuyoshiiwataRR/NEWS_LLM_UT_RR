    "text": "We are likely to have a cold Christmas. According to projections, \"during the holidays, a polar air intrusion might take hold. Very cold air from Northern Europe could descend in latitude and reach Italy,\" meteorologist Mattia Gussoni from Il Meteo.it told Adnkronos. Heavy Rain in Rome Today: Where and When It Will Rain - Weekend Weather Forecast The Bad Weather Let's start with the coming days: \"Between Friday and Saturday, we will have a wave of bad weather, particularly in the central-southern regions. Thunderstorms will return and will be particularly intense, especially on the Tyrrhenian side. It might also snow in the Apennines at altitudes above 1,400 meters. Additionally, on Sunday, very strong winds from the northern quadrants will promote a drop in temperatures in the same areas. In the North, however, we will have more stable weather, but fog is expected in the plains, and temperatures will remain quite low even during the day,\" explains Gussoni. The Trend for Christmas \"For the entire next week, the scene across Central-Western Europe and the Mediterranean basin will be dominated by high pressure. This means stable weather in Italy: no precipitation and rather mild temperatures, especially in the central-southern regions. In the week leading up to Christmas, we will therefore have decidedly sunnier days.\" This leads to the holidays, which will see a reversal of the trend. \"Of course, we still need to wait a few days for the details,\" Gussoni notes, \"but projections suggest that around Christmas, there will be a return of bad weather, low temperatures, and snow down to low altitudes.\"",

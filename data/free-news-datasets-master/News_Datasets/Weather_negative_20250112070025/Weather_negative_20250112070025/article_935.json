    "text": "The northern region of New Jersey could get a light coating of snow possibly mixed with freezing rain Sunday night, Dec. 15, and early Monday, Dec. 16, according to weather forecasters. National Weather Service\nBy Len Melisurgo | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com Parts of New Jersey could get a light coating of snow or a wintry mix at the tail end of the upcoming weekend, posing a risk of some slippery roads, the National Weather Service said.\nA weak storm system is expected to arrive in eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey either Sunday evening or Sunday night, with temperatures cold enough to support some snow in areas near and north of Interstate 78, the weather service said.\nSome computer guidance models are projecting “a fairly long duration” of precipitation, but the storm system shouldn’t have much moisture.\n“So even for areas that see a period of wintry mix or even all snow, snow accumulation should be light,” the weather service’s Mount Holly forecast office said.\nAs of Friday afternoon, the weather service was predicting less than 1 inch of accumulating snow in Sussex, Warren and Passaic counties, along with northern sections of Bergen, Essex, Hunterdon, Morris and Somerset counties.\nThe weather service’s New York regional office says there is a possibility of icy roads during the Monday morning commute in parts of northeastern New Jersey.\n“A light coating of snow and/or sleet is possible on untreated surfaces,” the agency said. “Locally icy conditions are possible due to cold ground temperatures and a possible mixing with rain and/or freezing rain.”\nAreas outside of northern New Jersey are expected to see light rain Sunday night and more light rain during the day on Monday.\nCurrent weather radar\nStories by Len Melisurgo Feds question whether N.J. drone sightings are real.

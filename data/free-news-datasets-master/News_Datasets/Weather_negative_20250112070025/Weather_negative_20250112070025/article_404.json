    "text": "[United Kingdom](../)\nSnow forecast as maps show exact moment ice storm hits as far south as Devon\nWeather forecasts for December have raised hopes of a snowy [Christmas](//www.express.co.uk/latest/christmas) Day in parts of Britain – but the [wintry spell](//www.express.co.uk/latest/cold-weather) will also bring seasonably [cold temperatures](//www.express.co.uk/latest/uk-weather) and gales of up to 70km per hour just a few days earlier.\nNew maps from WXCharts show a [freeze beginning to settle](//www.express.co.uk/news/weather/1987773/Snow-forecast-maps-white-christmas-weather-latest?int_source=nba) across the country at 6pm on Saturday, December 21, ushering in lows of -5C in Scotland and northern England.\nAnd it could be a white Christmas for some, as northern areas are forecast to be covered in snow – though southern regions are more likely to experience high winds and heavy rain than a winter wonderland. However, flurries are also expected to hit around the Devon and Somerset area, as well as Greater Manchester and the west of Wales.\nAreas around Fort William near the Scottish Highlands will bear the brunt of the chill, with snowfall expected over the weekend alongside winds of around 65km per hour and temperatures dropping to lows of -5C at the brutal ice storm swirls over the British Isles, according to WX Charts.\nOther parts of the country will see the mercury hover around freezing, with Inverness, Aberdeen and Edinburgh forecast for lows of between 1C and 2C.\nThe story will be the same across much of the UK, with nowhere in England, Wales or Northern Ireland expected to be above 5C on Saturday evening.\nThe warmest areas will be in the south east, reaching a minimum of 3C, while northern regions including Manchester and Newcastle will struggle to get above freezing.\nSouthern England could also be battered by strong winds of between 60 and 70km per hour at around 6pm on December 21 – with the south coast down to Devon forecast for similar gales to parts of Scotland.\nThe [Met Office](//www.express.co.uk/latest/met-office)’s long-range forecast for December 17 to 26 predicts widely unsettled weather with heavy rain and strong winds possible across the whole of the UK.\nThough the national forecaster suggests snowfall will likely be limited to higher ground, the theme will be of cool, slightly below average temperatures with a barrage of rain and gale force winds arriving from the west.\nToday:\nCool temperatures and grey clouds across most of the UK, with some outbreaks of light rain possible. Heavier downpours and hill fog likely in Scotland later in the day.\nTonight:\nDrizzle and cloud across much of the country, especially England and Wales. Scattered blustery showers in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nSaturday:\nRain and clouds clearing in the south, with brighter spells. Showers, clouds and breezy conditions expected in the northwest later in the day.\nOutlook for Sunday to Tuesday:\nRain affecting northern and western parts of the UK but generally dry elsewhere. Cloudy across the board with milder temperatures and some sunny spells in the east.\n[World News](/)||\n[Latest News](/news)||\n[U.S. News](../../us-news)\n[Source link](//www.express.co.uk/news/weather/1988180/uk-snow-storm-forecast-live-weather-maps)",

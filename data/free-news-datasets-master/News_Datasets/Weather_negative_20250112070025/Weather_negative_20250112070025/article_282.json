    "text": "Heavy snow on Thursday caused some problems on the road in the Town of Hamburg.\nPolice say between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m., they received around 50 to 100 calls for stuck cars.\n“It's very frustrating for us right now that there's a travel ban in effect and we're coming in contact with a lot of people that are just completely disobeying it,” said Lt. J. Cross, Hamburg Police. “And the reason they're out for travel is not legitimate. Our workers are out here just trying to respond to a ton of backed up calls and we can't get there because of stuck vehicles left and right.”\nOne car that caused a line of backups when it got stuck in a traffic circle was a delivery for DoorDash.\nThink of hitting the roads in a travel ban? Don’t.\nTown of Hamburg Police have responded to 50-100 stuck car calls, most are people who have no legitimate reason to be out. This car was doing a DoorDash delivery. Driver didn’t know about the ban and ended up in this situation pic.twitter.com/ISwsatM8Uc\n— Viktoria Hallikäär (@ViktoriaKrista) December 12, 2024 This is the region of good neighbors, so whether it was helping dig out, or just checking on neighbors, there were plenty of helping hands.\nThat includes Michael Gugliuzza, who was making sure people were all set.\n\"You’ve just got to be prepared,\" said Gugliuzza, of Blasdell. “Snow blower ready and whatever else you got to do. Make sure you got enough food and that, but, it's not about me today. It's about the people that can't do it.”\nWe caught up with Michael Gugliuzza who’s going around checking on neighbors. For him, storms like this are just a part of living in WNY! pic.twitter.com/iHVbbFu4Oi\n— Viktoria Hallikäär (@ViktoriaKrista) December 12, 2024",

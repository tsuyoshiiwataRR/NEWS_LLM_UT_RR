    "text": "Friday, December 13: December’s characteristic chill has finally set in over the eastern expanses of the country, with many states in for a further dip in temperatures over the next few days.\nAccording to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a well-marked low-pressure area has formed near the Gulf of Mannar, which will move westwards towards Lakshadweep over the course of the day. While it is unlikely to cause any rain over East India, it could result in cool and foggy days over many parts.\nAs a result, the IMD forecasts a cold wave over a few sections of Gangetic West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand till tomorrow (December 13-14). Dense fog is also likely to impact isolated areas of Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim and Bihar in the early morning or late night hours of Friday.\nAs for other major cities in the region, most parts of Kolkata will likely see daytime temperatures climb to a maximum of 23-25°C, with nighttime lows falling to a shivering 11-12°C over the next 3-4 days. Some areas could experience fog or mist in the morning on Sunday (December 15).\nSimilar conditions are in store for Odisha’s Bhubaneshwar, with maximums of 25-26°C on the cards till Monday (December 13-16). Nighttime temperatures are likely to drop a couple of degrees to 12°C by next week, the IMD predictions show.\nMeanwhile, foggy days will engulf both Patna in Bihar and Jharkhand’s Ranchi districts over the next five days. Maximum temperatures in these areas are likely to hang around 23-24°C maximums, with minimums falling to a chilly 13-14°C in Patna and an even more freezing 8-9°C in Ranchi.\nAs a result of these conditions, the IMD has placed a yellow watch over Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha and Gangetic West Bengal on Friday and Saturday, urging residents to “be updated” on the weather.\n**\nFor weather, science, space, and COVID-19 updates on the go, download [The Weather Channel App](https://weather.onelink.me/2902176432/ca9eb560) (on Android and iOS store).

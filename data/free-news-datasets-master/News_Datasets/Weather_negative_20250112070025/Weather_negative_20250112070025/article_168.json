    "text": "PORTAGE, Mich. — It’s a familiar sight in Michigan this time of year\nCars driving down the road with gusts of wind blowing snow off of the roof or the hood.\nWhile leaving a few snowflakes on the car might not seem like a big deal when getting to work in the morning, police are watching to make sure cars are clean.\nPortage Police Sgt. Kyle Doster said he’s seen too many drivers make the minimum effort when brushing off their vehicle.\n\"They have cut a hole in the snow just big enough to see, and that's not adequate,\" Doster said.\nIt’s also against the law.\nWinter weather : Weather Alert Day: Heavy snow, gusty winds, and frigid air is on the way to West Michigan Doster said it's a problem of visibility. Drivers already have a tough time in this type of weather with a decreased ability to stop and maneuver, and when a third factor is added of snow flying off of cars, it creates a perfect storm of conditions for a crash.\nAccording to Michigan’s vehicle code, drivers cannot cause snow, ice or slush to fall onto any roadway or highway.\nIt also says a vehicle with any object obstructing vision in front of or behind the vehicle cannot be driven, and all of the lights on cars must be visible --including the front and the brake lights.\nDrivers also have to have a way to see out the back of the car, whether that’s through clearing off the back window or clearing both rearview mirrors.\n\"You could be responsible for a citation, civil infraction up to $100 for snow or ice being deposited into the roadway,\" Doster said.\nKeeping snow drifts off cars isn’t the only way drivers can be considerate of others in winter.\nNews Channel 3 asked drivers in Portage what they think is the worst part of driving before the roads are clear.\n\"A lot of times it's other people,\" Amy Murray said. \"You've got to be careful on your own, and you've got to watch out for everybody else.”\n\"Brake too fast, accelerate too fast, those are the biggest ones,\" Sarah Platt said.\nWinter driving : 'Drive with due care': tow truck company urges drivers to slow down, move over this winter Doster says to keep in mind that the person behind you may be a less experienced driver, and that we all rely on the same streets to get to where we need to be.\n\"If somebody makes that choice to go at a certain speed, you need to respect that. We don't know what kind of vehicle or equipment they're using, or what their skill level is.\"\nPolice say something else to keep in mind is that ice may remain on a car when it's driven at lower speeds, but after getting on the highway, the ice could break loose and hit or even damage another car.",

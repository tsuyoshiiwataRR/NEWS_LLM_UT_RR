    "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The winter storm is being a Grinch for people’s weekend plans, as the Sacramento Santa Parade has been canceled.\nInitially scheduled for Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon, organizers at Mix96 radio station decided the weather forecasts made proceeding with the parade unsafe.\n“Our number one priority is the safety and well-being of our parade participants, spectators, and employees. After speaking with several meteorologists, we have determined that the weather conditions expected for Saturday morning exhibit too much risk for us to execute a safe and fun event,” Mix96 said in a statement.\nMix96 also added that not only were they disappointed about the cancellation, but so was the big man in red, who will now have to wait until Christmas Eve to visit Sacramento.\n“We know the most disappointed one of all is Santa Claus, as he was looking forward to seeing everyone before Christmas,\" they wrote.\nOrganizers posted on Facebook saying a postponement was “impossible” due to issues with securing permits, street closures and other needs.",

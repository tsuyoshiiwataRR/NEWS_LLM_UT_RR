    "text": "The coastal region and delta districts will have to brace for the next spell of heavy rain from December 16.\nEven as the low-pressure area is likely to weaken by Saturday, the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Chennai, has forecast that another low-pressure area will form in two days and trigger intense rain.\nThe active Northeast monsoon influenced the formation of back-to-back weather systems.\nThere has been an increase in the rainfall episodes, with some weather stations receiving 50 cm in a single day.\nThis calls for a study of the phenomenon and better preparedness for disaster management, S. Balachandran, Additional Director-General of Meteorology, Chennai, said. Rain continued in several parts of the State till Friday evening. Virudhunagar received 12 cm of rain, followed by Thoothukudi (10 cm) till 5.30 p.m.\nAfter a break of two days, the RMC said fairly widespread rainfall would continue over the State from Monday. An upper air cyclonic circulation, likely to form over south Andaman Sea on Saturday, will influence the formation of a fresh low-pressure area over the southern parts of the Bay of Bengal. It will move west-northwestwards, towards the Tamil Nadu coast, by Monday.\nHeavy rain forecast Six districts may receive heavy rain on Monday, and the intensity will pick up on December 17 and 18.\nThe RMC has issued an orange alert for Cuddalore and Mayiladuthurai districts and Karaikal for Tuesday, and various other coastal and delta districts would continue to receive heavy rainfall in isolated places till Wednesday.\nThere were downpours in Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Thoothukudi districts on Friday.\nOothu in Tirunelveli district recorded 54 cm rainfall on Friday, followed by Ambasamudram in Tirunelveli district and Kovilpatti in Thoothukudi district (37 cm each).\nMr. Balachandran said the slow-moving, unique weather system brought widespread heavy rain over the State on Thursday.\nOn a single day, Tamil Nadu’s average rainfall during this Northeast monsoon shifted from normal to excess by 33%.\nThursday’s rainfall added nearly 17% to the State’s seasonal rainfall. A total of 25 places in the State received extremely heavy rainfall and 81 places recorded very heavy rainfall as northeast monsoon became vigorous.\nThe State has already received 53.4 cm, way more than its seasonal average of 44 cm. Five districts, including Krishnagiri and Tirupattur, have recorded largely excess rainfall and many others received surplus rainfall this monsoon, Mr. Balachandran added.\nPublished - December 14, 2024 03:22 am IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

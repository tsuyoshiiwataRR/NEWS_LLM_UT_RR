    "text": "Madurai: The water flow in the Thamirabarani river is likely to cross 1 lakh cusecs by Saturday morning as heavy rain lashed southern Tamil Nadu on Friday. Water flow in the river stood around 74,000 cusecs on Friday evening.Tuticorin district collector ordered all people living in the low-lying areas of the riverbank to vacate by Friday night while the Tenkasi district administration announced that 20,000 cusecs of water is likely to be added to the river flow due to heavy rain in the catchment areas of the Gadana river.The rain started on Thursday and continued throughout the night. Almost all districts in the region, except Kanyakumari district, declared a holiday for schools and colleges. Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, and Tuticorin districts announced a holiday for educational institutions on Saturday as well. Manonmaniam Sundaranar University announced the postponement of exams scheduled for Friday and Saturday.The incessant rain reduced to intermittent showers by Friday afternoon, but the swollen streams increased the flow in almost all major rivers in the region. A flood warning has been issued to all people residing on the banks of the Thamirabarani by Friday morning, and it was upgraded to a severe flood alert by Friday evening.Waterlogging and inundation were reported in Tirunelveli city, with the junction area being the worst affected.

Traffic movement was affected in Tirunelveli, Tuticorin, and Tenkasi districts as floodwater inundated arterial roads.

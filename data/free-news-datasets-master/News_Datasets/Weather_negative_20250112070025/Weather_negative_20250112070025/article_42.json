    "text": "Slick Travel Conditions Expected Thursday Morning By Karri Triplett Published: Dec. 12, 2024 at 5:43 PM EST | Updated: 21 hours ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nPRESQUE ISLE, Maine (WAGM) - Wednesday night’s rain is expected to affect travel in the county Thursday morning. The potential for this much rain in a short period of time has the county on an aerial flood watch that is in effect until tomorrow morning. The County is getting a December rainstorm. The amount of rainfall expected combined with snow melt and high winds has the potential for vehicles to hydroplane as well as the possibility of local power outages. The Aroostook Emergency Management Agency has had several meetings with local organizations preparing for the storm.\nDarren Woods, Director of the Aroostook Emergency Management Agency said, “With the winds that are being projected right after the soaking rain we are anticipating some power outages. We always hope that there aren’t any, but you can’t live on hope. You have to be prepared. So, we tell people to prepare for power outages like you would any other and watch for pooling water in the roadways where there may be clogged storm drains and whatnot.”\nMeteorologist Vanessa Symonick said the main concern for local travel is the potential for ponding onto the roadways and refreezing to occur. This could make for some slick travel conditions Thursday morning. “So, when we’re thinking about road conditions, and we’re thinking about the different types of precipitation, when we think about freezing rain like we dealt with earlier this morning you want to think of it as that glaze, that icy glaze. I kind of put things into perspective in the way of donuts if we’re comparing things. So, if you have that icy glaze think of it as your glazed donut, really coating everything in terms of the pavement. We’re thinking about rain, that main concern is for hydroplaning because of the ponding onto the roadways. So, even though there isn’t that slick component to it, it still is hazardous enough to create some difficult travel conditions even with warmer temperatures.” Locals can check for the latest updates on road conditions and weather alerts at wagmtv.com.\nCopyright 2024 WAGM.

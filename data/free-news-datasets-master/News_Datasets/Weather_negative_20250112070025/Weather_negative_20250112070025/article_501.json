    "text": "Storm Darragh certainly did a number on Cornwall last weekend. Not only did it bring trees down, close roads, cover the streets of coastal towns with tonnes of sand and cause lengthy power cuts, but it also messed up the power grid.\nMany people have been complaining that their lights have been flickering since the storm, but there are now concerns over sparking powerlines. From Hayle to Newquay, residents have taken to social media to wonder why the power lines are still sparking days after Storm Darragh has passed.\nOn a post on the public page Newest Newquay, Pauline Fillery said she spoke to two National Grid engineers out doing repairs in Cubert who told her the salt build up along the lines accumulated from Storm Darragh is the reason why the lines are sparking.\nShe posted: \"I have news from two National Grid men currently in Cubert. This is what's really going on with the power. Due to the storm last weekend it has caused a build up of salt on the power lines. They said it's built up and tracking along the lines, causing the power to trip.\nSign up to receive daily updates and breaking news alerts from CornwallLive straight to your inbox\n\"Also there are lots of sparking of power lines due to the salt. They said they are getting on top of it but it's random where and when it happens. They need it to rain to wash the salt off. They said that sticky salty stuff that's coated our windows, is what is coating the power lines.\"\nGary Price added: \"All the power lines are supported by either glass or ceramic discs that act as insulators to the steel pylons. Build up of salt can cause power to track to steelwork on the tower. Some companies power wash them off if lines are isolated. Rain will generally keep them rinsed off of salt and sand build up.\"\nWolf Akuma saw the funny side of it, adding: \"Damn, so we need another storm to fix the first storm and the root of all our problems is cloudy, white, sticky and salty? Gotcha!\"\nAccording to scientific open access publishing site MDPI, \"over time, atmospheric contaminants, such as salt spray or chemical dust, can build up on an insulator, creating a conductive path that can cause a high-voltage electric discharge known as a flashover. Flashovers can be dangerous or even fatal if a person is too close to the insulator when it occurs\".\nHayle resident Lee Nicholas sent CornwallLive a video of sparking powerlines near the Asda store in the town. You can hear little pop sounds and see flashes where the lines are connected to the pylons.\nNational Grid has confirmed that it is indeed the case that salt incrustation is causing the sparking adding that they are on top of it. A spokesperson for the utility company said rain would be welcome to clean it all off, but the forecast is not promising for the next few days. They insisted it poses no danger to people and properties.\nThe utility firm said what happened is rare but can happen from time to time and was made worse by the storm and wind direction which pulled a lot of moisture from the sea. They said: \"During Storm Darragh strong winds at some costal locations and high grounds led to sea salt crystals coating overhead lines.\n\"This is an unusual occurrence due to the exceptionally strong northern westerly winds experienced during the storm that pulled moisture from the sea.\n\"We would like to reassure our customers that we are aware of the issue and are taking action. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.\"\nClick here to join CornwallLive on WhatsApp. We also treat our community members to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

    "text": "KALAMAZOO, Mich. â€” A little bit of ice isn't very nice - especially on a big December weekend before Christmas.\nWe're honing in on a time frame of after 8 p.m. Saturday night through the wee hours of early Sunday morning.\nA positive, recent development is the latest trends are projecting a bit less ice than prior thinking.\nThe wildcard, of course, is our ground and road surfaces are already pretty cold from our recent arctic intrusion.\nMesoWest data from the University of Utah tracks road temperatures from 23 degrees along I-94 to 33 degrees along US 31 in Ottawa County.\nHour by Hour portrays freezing rain, and even a little sleet, at 10 p.m. Saturday night in Van Buren, Kalamazoo, and St. Joseph Counties.\nUltimately, we're transitioning to a chilly rain from near the midnight hour into pre-daybreak Sunday from south to north.\nFor instance, it may still be cold enough for freezing rain in a line from Greenville to Big Rapids to Fremont and northward in a window from 4 a.m. through 7 a.m. Sunday morning.\nWith rain coming both Sunday and again on Monday, it's a really smart time to remove any ice from gutters, downspouts, drains, and sewers around your house or place of work.\nMoving forward, we don't see a ton of snow next week, which means limited chances for a White Christmas.\nBut, not zero chances. So, you're saying there's a chance!!!\n[Email Meteorologist Jeff Porter](jporter@sbgtv.com) and follow and like his content on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jeffporterwx), [Twitter](https://x.com/JeffPorterWX), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jeffporterwx/), and [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@jeffporterwx).",

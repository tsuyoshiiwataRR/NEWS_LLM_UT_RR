    "text": "First Alert Weather Days issued for Friday & Saturday as icy conditions expected to develop\n**Winter Weather Advisory for most of Siouxland from Friday afternoon through Saturday morning**\nSIOUX CITY (KTIV) - Thursday continued our wintry weather pattern with continued cold temperatures and a little light snow that made travel a little slick in some areas. Now we all have to get ready for a larger system to impact Siouxland with a chance of very slick conditions due to freezing rain that may develop.\nFirst Alert Weather Days have been issued for Friday and Saturday to give you an extra heads up of the dangerous travel that could be involved with this system and to urge you to keep track of the forecast to possibly change travel plans that you may have.\nBefore that system arrives, Thursday night will stay quiet but chilly for us with lows in the single digits under a partly cloudy sky.\nFriday will start off quiet and despite mostly cloudy skies, temperatures will slowly climb into the mid 20s by mid-afternoon with a stronger southeast wind at 15 to 25 miles per hour. It’s during the afternoon that some mixed precipitation could start to develop. The first areas to see development will likely be after mid-afternoon in southern Siouxland where it could be a combination of sleet and freezing drizzle. That moisture will then move to the north through the rest of the afternoon and into the evening perhaps putting down a glaze of ice as the evening hours go along. Due to the travel hazards that will be caused, the National Weather Service has issued a Winter Weather Advisory from Friday afternoon through Saturday morning for the entire KTIV viewing area except for Holt County.\nFriday night will continue the combination of freezing drizzle, freezing rain, sleet, and possibly even some snow at times as the wind tapes off through the night. This mixture will then continue to be widespread into the morning hours Saturday before slowly tapering off as the day goes along on Saturday. One positive for Saturday is that temperatures will be on the rise and some places will be able to go above 32 degrees, helping with the icing that has taken place. In Sioux City, we may try to approach 32 degrees toward the noon hour. By the end of this system, Siouxland could see anywhere from a light glaze of ice to up to .20” of ice accumulation which could make travel difficult. The snow is not expected to be too heavy with most of us seeing sleet and snow accumulation of around an inch or less.\nSaturday night will quiet down but stay mostly cloudy with lows not falling too much into the mid 20s.\nSunday will give us peeks of sunshine but more importantly bring us warmer temperatures. Expect highs to get into the low 40s to round out the weekend with a south wind of 5 to 15 miles per hour.\nAnother cold front will be moving through the region on Monday but at this point we’re expecting to keep conditions dry with highs near 40 under partly cloudy skies.\nWe’ll then cool down a bit into the middle part of the week with highs returning back to the 30s.\nAre there any more systems on the horizon next week? I’ll have more on that here in my story and on News 4 at 10.\nCopyright 2024 KTIV. All rights reserved.",

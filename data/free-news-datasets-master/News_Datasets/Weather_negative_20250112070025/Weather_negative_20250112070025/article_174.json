    "text": "IT was a great idea that fell foul of the weather, so full marks to all involved in the weekend's community Christmas entertainment at the showground.\nIt was a free event that involved not only expense but voluntary involvement by a lot of people including school kids.\nIt was a today version of yesterday's free street entertainment organised by some in the business community that ended when the main movers and shakers moved away.\nSaturday's event was great entertainment while it lasted - despite the predictable keyboard critics who reside in their always negative world - but the three-hour program had to end after just 90 minutes when a violent electrical storm moved in. Let's try again next year.\nDeadly serious\nFIVE years ago this week we were doing our best to survive when the most destructive bushfire in our recorded history incinerated everything in its path. Around 30 homes were lost, three in town and the remainder around Clarence and Dargan. It seemed unstoppable but eventually the monster was defeated, leaving a charred and blackened landscape from Gospers Mountain to the Hawkesbury, to Bilpin and Mt Tomah, on to the Lithgow area and through the Blue Mountains National Park. And one more blow to the Zig Zag Railway. It was a lesson in knowing when to stop and fight and when to run.\nChristmas treat\nThis Sunday afternoon take time off in air-conditioned comfort in the Notre Dame University lecture theatre at Bowenfels for the talented Community Orchestra's summer concert. We're promised 'rock and roll and ragtime to the serene and elegant'. All free, even the light supper. Can't beat that for an end of year treat. Starts at 2 pm.\nChristmas angels\nSTILL in that end of town and the wonderful work of the volunteers behind Christmas and Beyond - and their sponsors - continues this Christmas Day with the free luncheon and camaraderie for all comers at the Bible Church hall opposite the hospital. You don't have to be down on your luck. Anyone is welcome to turn up, particularly if you're alone at Christmas. Now in its 23rd year, it truly is the meaning of goodwill at Christmas. Christmas Day morning tea 8.30 to 11, lunch 11.30 to 1.30. More volunteers will be welcome to help set up the hall on the 23rd (3 to 7 pm) and on the big day. Even if you can only spare an hour.\nIllegal and rude\nSOMEONE in authority needs to do something about the dangerous and all too regular parking in the No Stopping zone in Main Street outside Subway. Seems someone has to be killed or maimed by flying blind from Sandford Avenue before action is taken, perhaps something as simple as extending the zone another car length or so. It's absolutely brazen but the police don't seem interested in parking offences these days and it's rare to see a Council ranger on street duties. Meantime, have some manners.\nClocking off\nMUST surely be time for a New Year resolution by Council to replace the troublesome and once again locked in time town clock. It's a charmless relic anyway mounted on an equally shabby facade that rather embarrassingly for Lithgow still has signage wrongly indicating it's Council property.\nFlagless\nJUST days out from the busiest holiday period of the year and still no flags fluttering on those naked flag poles at our Visitors Centre. Such things get noticed.\nUgly reaction\nBIT rich blaming Albo for the ugly rise of anti-Semitism in Australia. Vested interests in Israeli leadership, sections of the media and the predictable pile-on by Dutton and Co would have us believe Albo and co- conspirator Penny Wong were fuelling the disgraceful behaviour. Nothing to do, of course, with the daily doses of Middle Eastern horror served up on prime time TV.",

    "text": "Whether we will convene the negotiations in a few days or will we need more time depends on the first meetings of the negotiating groups and what they will agree on. We need a regular government, we have been repeating this for a long time. GERB - UDF have given their best possible figures to the negotiating team (Raya Nazaryan, Rosen Zhelyazkov, Tomislav Donchev and Daniel Mitov - ed.). If the negotiating teams do not come to an agreement, things will end faster. For me, there is hope and an agreement will be reached. Then we will need more time to fully review the governing program.\nThis was stated on the show \"Denyat na Zievo\" on NOVA NEWS the chairman of the UDF and a deputy from GERB - UDF Rumen Hristov, who commented on the political situation in the country and the possibilities for forming a regular government.\n\"I am very worried about the proposed budget from the caretaker cabinet. I don't see how we will vote on the budget by December 31. It is almost impossible. It would be better to enter the new year with an extended budget and if things go well for a regular cabinet, for the cabinet to propose a budget\", Hristov was categorical.\n\"The PP has demonstrated throughout the entire time an unwillingness to talk about the important topic of a regular government. We never intended to split the PP-DB, as happened now with these negotiations. This is their decision, as was the case during a landmark vote for the speaker of the parliament, when they split again. We are elevating Boyko Borisov as prime minister because of his experience, contacts and international ties. All of this will help us enter the Eurozone. There is nothing more logical than for the largest party, which has been winning elections for several times in a row, to be appointed prime minister. Let's use its opportunities. We have also appointed an expert cabinet and nothing has come of it. With experts, it is not known who is responsible. The political cabinet is responsible to its voters. Are there no experts in our group? Let's see what will happen during the negotiations. I know for sure that the BSP and the ITN have accepted the invitation to negotiations. I cannot say anything about the DB. If things do not work out with the first mandate, I do not see how they will work out with the second and third. We have already played this movie,\" Hristov announced.\n\"The prosecutor's office is an independent body, I cannot comment on its actions. Requesting immunities could hinder the negotiations, because someone could decide that we want to split the PP-DB and are behind these demands. I will repeat again that we do not aim for such a split. \"For me, the request for immunities is late, because it is for things that happened 2-3 years ago, but the prosecution decided so, did so,\" commented Rumen Hristov on the requested immunities of Kiril Petkov and Lena Borislavova.",

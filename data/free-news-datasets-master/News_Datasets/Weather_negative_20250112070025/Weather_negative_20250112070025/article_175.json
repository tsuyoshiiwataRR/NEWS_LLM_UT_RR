    "text": "Cold air mass, monsoon rains hit Thailand, affecting 14 provinces\nThe [Meteorological Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_Meteorological_Department) of Thailand (TMD) warned of another cold air mass approaching, causing temperatures to drop by 1 to 3 degrees Celsius. The southern region faces heavy monsoon rains impacting 14 provinces, while Bangkok will experience rain and wind.\nThe forecast for the next 24 hours indicates that a high-pressure area or cold air mass from China is now covering the upper part of Thailand and the South China Sea. This weather pattern is expected to bring rain initially to upper Thailand, followed by cooler weather and strong winds. Residents in these areas should care for their health due to these changing weather conditions.\nFor the southern region, a strong northeast monsoon is sweeping over the Gulf of Thailand and the southern provinces. Coupled with a low-pressure area over the lower southern region and Malaysia, it is expected to move towards the Andaman Sea.\nConsequently, the south will experience increased rainfall, with heavy to very heavy rain in some areas. Residents in these regions should be cautious of potential flash floods and rapid water flow, especially in valleys near waterways and low-lying areas.\nThe Gulf of Thailand is experiencing strong winds with waves reaching 1 to 3 metres high, and areas with thunderstorms could see waves above 3 metres. The Andaman Sea has waves about 1 metre high, with offshore waves exceeding 1 metre and over 2 metres in stormy areas.\nMariners in the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea should exercise caution and avoid sailing in stormy areas. Small boats in the Gulf of Thailand are advised to stay ashore, and residents in the southern (eastern) provinces should be wary of strong waves hitting the shore during this period.\nCold air\nDust accumulation in upper Thailand is expected to decrease due to stronger winds and better air ventilation.\nThe [weather forecast](https://thethaiger.com/tag/thailand-weather-forcast) for Thailand from 6am today to 6am tomorrow is as follows:\nIn the northern region, the upper part will have cool weather with morning fog, and temperatures will rise by 1 to 2 degrees Celsius.

On Wednesday, the temperature was 4.9 degrees Celsius.\nAccording to IMD, the minimum temperature did not drop below 4.9 degrees Celsius in December 2023 and 2022. The lowest minimum temperature in December last year was 4.9 degrees Celsius on the 15th, while the lowest in 2022 was 5 degrees Celsius on the 26th.\nCold wave conditions were observed at isolated places, including Ayanagar and Pusa, where temperatures dropped to 3.8 and 3.2 degrees Celsius. According to IMD, cold wave conditions occur when actual temperatures fall below 4.1 degrees Celsius or when the departure from normal is 4.4 degrees Celsius or more below average.\nMeanwhile, the maximum temperature during the day was recorded at 22.2 degrees Celsius, 0.8 degrees below normal, the IMD said. The humidity fluctuated between 88% and 52% during the day.\nThe weather department has forecast cold wave conditions at isolated places until December 15.

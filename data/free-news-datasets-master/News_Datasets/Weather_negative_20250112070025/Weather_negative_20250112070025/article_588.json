    "text": "By Alexandra Deryn ,\n1 hours ago\nADAMS, N.Y. (WSYR) — Jefferson County residents have already dealt with a few heavy snow bouts, reaching nearly six feet of accumulation over the past two weeks. They experienced more lake effect snowfall on Thursday evening, Dec. 12.\nAmazon Fulfillment Center in Clay seeing record numbers Lake effect snow returns to Jefferson County St. Lawrence County hosting emergency drill today in Canton Closings and delays from the continued winter weather Nearly half of US teens are online ‘constantly’: Pew report “Normally…it doesn’t happen all at once,” Keith Waterman, a Pierrepont Manor resident, said. “We’re just getting it all at once for some reason.”\nJames Hanks, a lifelong resident in Adams, said he is ready for springtime even though it is only December.\n“This has probably been the worst year in the last few years up here, actually,” Hanks said. “I mean, it sucks.”\nJack Frost typically rears his ugly head this time of year and when he does, Waterman said he wants drivers to be extra cautious when they are on county roads.\n“You’ve just got to slow down,” he said. “Take your time. If you don’t need to go there, don’t go.”\nBut the fun does not have to stop because the frigid conditions have returned. People up north have a chance to snowmobile, snowboard, ski and ice fish.\n“I do snowshoeing, ice fishing a little bit…if we ever get cold enough to get on the ice,” he said. “I want to see a pond freeze up real bad.”\nNicholas Broadhurst grew up in Adams and became a snow plow driver. He said the snow can be difficult to live in but helping people is rewarding.\n“It’s definitely nice to know that you’re helping people out…especially if they call and they can’t get out of their driveway because of the snow blowing…different things like that,” Broadhurst said.\nBroadhurst hopped in his cab a 4 a.m. on Thursday morning and was plowing well into the night.\nHe said he does not expect the workload to let up anytime soon.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

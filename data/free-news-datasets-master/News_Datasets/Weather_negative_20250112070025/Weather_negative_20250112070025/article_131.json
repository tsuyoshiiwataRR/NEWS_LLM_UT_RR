It is expected to bring heavy rains to southern parts of Tamil Nadu.\nOn Thursday, widespread rains lashed parts of Tamil Nadu with overnight showers bringing inundation in parts of Chennai and the neighbouring Tiruvallur, Chengalpattu and Kancheepuram, besides Villupuram and some areas in the Cauvery delta region.\nAlso Read: [As rains lash western districts, Mettur dam almost full; mist and cold hits life in the Nilgiris](https://www.dtnext.in/news/tamilnadu/as-rains-lash-western-districts-mettur-dam-almost-full-mist-and-cold-hits-life-in-the-nilgiris-814988)\nThe Regional Meteorological Centre issued a red alert for three districts of Tirunelveli Thoothukudi, and Tenkasi for Friday. The intensity of the rains is likely to reduce after Friday and light rains are expected to continue.\nMeanwhile, another low-pressure system is expected to be formed over the Andaman Sea next week which is expected to move towards Tamil Nadu and bring heavy rainfall to several parts of the State. The new system is expected to bring heavy rain at one or two places over Cuddalore, Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Thanjavur and Pudukottai on December 16. Heavy to very heavy rain is likely to occur at isolated places over Cuddalore, Mayiladuthurai and Nagapattinam on December 17.\nAdditionally, heavy rain is likely to occur at one or two places over Chengalpattu, Villupuram, Kallakurichi, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Thanjavur and Tiruvarur.

Heavy rains also led to traffic snarls during the morning hours in many places. Kundrathur, Anna University, Taramani, Poonammalle, Meenambakkam and Nandanam in the city received more than 8 cm of rainfall.",

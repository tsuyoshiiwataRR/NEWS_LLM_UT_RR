    "text": "By Kevin the Editor ,\n6 hours ago Temperatures are on the rise back to the mild range as the National Weather Service calls for clouds to move in and rain to return to Polk County.\nAs everyone crosses their fingers that Friday the 13th goes well, the forecast is at least expected to cooperate as NWS Peachtree City meteorologists call for temps to get up to 57 on the day and a calm wind. Overnight temps are supposed to get down to 39, with winds expected to pick up as gusts go as high as 15 mph overnight.\nWeekend rain is expected to return, but not before a Saturday with mostly cloudy skies and a high of 56, with winds picking up between 5 to 15 mph, and gusts up to 25 mph. Overnight rain after midnight is up to a 70% chance of showers, and winds still gusting up to 25 mph. Look for a low of 41 overnight on Saturday.\nSunday weather brings a 50% chance of showers and a high of 53, and temps down 44 on Sunday night with a 20% chance of showers.\nThe week is predicted to start out mild with a high of 64 and mostly cloudy skies. The likelihood of rain returning on Monday night up to 60%, with a low of 51.\nHeading into the rest of next week, temperatures are expected to remain in the 60s through midweek with lows down into the 40s, with chances of rain throughout the entire stretch through next Thursday.\nThe post WEATHER: Morning sun to give way to cloudy skies, weekend rain coming appeared first on Polk Today .\nBe the first to react",

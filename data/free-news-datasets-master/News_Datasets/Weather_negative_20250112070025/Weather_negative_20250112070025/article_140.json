BE READY FOR SNOW ON THE ROADS AND TRAFFIC CONTROLS. ## (( DAN TOSS TO METEOROLOGIST IN WEATHER CENTER )) (SKYCAM) HERE IS A LOOK OUTSIDE FROM OUR LOCAL SKYCAM NEXT ROUND OF IMPACTFUL RAINFALL STARTS TO COME THROUGH TOMORROW EVENING INTO SATURDAY WITH GUSTY SOUTH WINDS THROUGHOUT AND MINOR FLOODING CONCERNS IN THE NORTH BAY. ANOTHER ROUND OF GENERALLY LIGHT RAIN COMES LATE SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. KEY MESSAGES: LINGERING LIGHT SHOWERS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. NEXT ROUND OF IMPACTFUL RAINFALL STARTS TO PUSH THROUGH TOMORROW EVENING INTO SATURDAY WITH GUSTY SOUTH WINDS THROUGHOUT AND MINOR FLOODING CONCERNS IN THE NORTH BAY. GUSTY SOUTH WINDS WILL ACCOMPANY THE NEXT ROUND OF RAINFALL FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY, ESPECIALLY ALONG OUR COASTAL AREAS. ANOTHER ROUND OF GENERALLY LIGHT RAIN COMES LATE SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. COASTAL FLOODING CONCERNS THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY DUE TO A COMBINATION OF HIGH SURF AND KING TIDES. LIGHT SHOWERS ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE UPPER LOW EXITING TO OUR EAST WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH DIMINISHING CHANCES THE FARTHER SOUTH YOU GO FROM THE NORTH BAY DOWN INTO THE CENTRAL COAST. A QUASI-WARM FRONT/STATIONARY FRONT IN VICINITY OF NORTH BAY WILL KEEP SCATTERED RAIN CHANCES IN THE FORECAST ACROSS SONOMA AND NAPA COUNTY TODAY AND TOMORROW OUT AHEAD OF THE NEXT ROUND OF MORE MODERATE WIDESPREAD RAINFALL SETTING IN LATE FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. THE POSITION OF THE AFOREMENTIONED RAIN ACTIVITY ACROSS THE NORTH BAY WRT THE STATIONARY FRONT WILL BE WATCHED CLOSELY AS ANY SHIFT SOUTH COULD RESULT IN MORE RAINFALL THAN CURRENTLY FORECASTED, WHICH WOULD LEAD TO INCREASED FLOODING CONCERNS FOR THAT AREA. FARTHER SOUTH INTO THE BAY AREA, EAST BAY AND REST OF THE CENTRAL COAST WILL BE MUCH LESS IMPACTED BY ANY SHOWER ACTIVITY FOR THE REMAINDER OF TONIGHT AND TOMORROW. THE FORECAST FOR THE ONSET OF STEADY, MODERATE (OCCASIONALLY HEAVY) RAINFALL FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY ACROSS THE NORTH BAY REMAINS ON TRACK.

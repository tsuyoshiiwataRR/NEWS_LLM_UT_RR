    "text": "Many flights to Tan Son Nhat International Airport in Ho Chi Minh City were forced to circle in holding patterns before landing on Thursday due to adverse weather conditions, resulting in a chain of cascading delays for subsequent flights.\n“Flights to Ho Chi Minh City were delayed as aircraft were forced to circle before landing, causing a chain reaction of schedule disruptions for several other flights on December 12, both at noon and in the early afternoon,” national carrier Vietnam Airlines announced.\nPassengers also reported delays, including a flight from Chu Lai Airport in Quang nam Province, central Vietnam, to Tan Son Nhat, which had its take-off time pushed back.\nAccording to a source close to Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper, one of the key factors for the postponements was a sudden change in wind direction.\nThis prompted air traffic control to request a change in landing direction to ensure safety.\nFrom 3:30 pm to 4:00 pm, showers near the airport reduced visibility to 3,000-5,000 meters.\nAs flights neared the runway, sudden wind changes accompanied by increased intensity necessitated the landing direction shift.\nThe procedure was a standard safety measure in flight operations, both in Vietnam and worldwide, and did not pose a threat to flight safety.\n[Like us on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/newsaboutvietnam/) or [follow us on X](https://x.com/VietNewsGateway) to get the latest news about Vietnam!",

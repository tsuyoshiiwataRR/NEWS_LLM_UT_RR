    "text": "The Meteorology General Directorate (MGM) has issued critical warnings for heavy rain, snow, and strong winds in various provinces of Türkiye.\nThese warnings, categorized as yellow and orange alerts, emphasize the risks of flooding, landslides, avalanches and icy conditions.\nBelow is a detailed breakdown of the severe weather expectations and safety recommendations for affected areas.\nThe Diyarbakir Express tourist train offers travelers new experiences along the route from Ankara to Diyarbakir, Türkiye, April 19, 2024. (AA Photo) Severe weather warnings issued for key regions in Türkiye The MGM has flagged multiple provinces with significant weather risks:\nYellow warnings have been issued for Ardahan, Bayburt, Diyarbakir, Erzurum, Giresun, Trabzon and Van Orange warnings , indicating more severe risks, are in place for Rize and Artvin due to heavy rainfall and potential flooding Residents are urged to stay informed and take necessary precautions.\nRain and snow take over: Severe weather to impact large areas of Türkiye Coastal regions in the Marmara and Aegean are forecasted to experience continuous rain, while snow is expected at higher altitudes and inland provinces. Black Sea cities such as Rize and Artvin are likely to receive over 2 inches (51–100 mm) of rainfall.\nElevated areas, especially in eastern Türkiye, could see snow accumulations of up to 8 inches (20 cm), particularly in Bitlis, Van and Hakkari.\nThe Narman Fairy Chimneys in Erzurum have turned white with their unique red landscape even during severe weather conditions in winter, Türkiye, Dec. 3, 2024. (IHA Photo) Türkiye’s eastern provinces brace for extreme cold, snowfall In the east, temperatures will plunge significantly, with Erzurum, Kars, and Ardahan experiencing lows of 14 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 10 degrees Celsius). Snowfall in these provinces could lead to difficult travel and daily disruptions, with avalanches posing risks in steep areas.\nDiyarbakir and Gaziantep in southeastern Türkiye will see lighter snowfall mixed with rain, while icy roads and dense fog are expected to create travel challenges.\nWinds reaching 37 miles per hour in southeastern provinces could further disrupt transportation and outdoor activities.\nSevere weather to impact Black Sea region: Risks of flooding, landslides Intense rainfall in the Black Sea region raises concerns about flooding and landslides. Trabzon, Giresun, and Artvin are particularly vulnerable to these hazards due to persistent downpours. Flash flooding in urban and rural areas is possible, and residents are advised to monitor updates from local authorities.\nPeople canoeing riding on the Bosphorus with the Blue Mosque and the Ayasofya-i Kebir Camii (or Hagia Sophia Grand Mosque) in the background, in Istanbul on Dec. 1, 2024. (AFP Photo) Temperatures to drop below seasonal norms in Türkiye A cold front moving across Türkiye will bring temperatures below seasonal averages by 1 to 3 degrees Celsius.\nIstanbul will see highs of 50 degrees Fahrenheit with continuous rain throughout the weekend. Ankara will remain colder, with temperatures around 39 degrees Fahrenheit and potential snowfall in surrounding higher areas.\nSouthern regions such as Izmir and Antalya will also experience cooler-than-usual and severe weather conditions. Daytime highs will reach 59 degrees Fahrenheit in Izmir and 66 degrees Fahrenheit in Antalya.\nAvalanche warnings and icy roads prompt caution Avalanche risks are significant in the Black Sea’s mountainous regions and southeastern Anatolia. Steep slopes covered in snow may pose dangers, and authorities recommend avoiding high-risk areas. Ice and frost will create hazardous road conditions across much of the interior and eastern regions. The MGM advises equipping vehicles with winter tires and chains to ensure safe travel.\nRecommendations for staying safe during severe weather conditions in Türkiye Monitor updates: Follow MGM bulletins and local weather reports for real-time information. Secure outdoor items: Protect belongings that could be affected by strong winds. Postpone unnecessary travel: Avoid trips in areas with heavy rainfall, snow, or icy roads. Prepare for emergencies: Keep essential supplies like flashlights, batteries, and first-aid kits ready. Drive carefully: Maintain a safe speed and increase the distance between vehicles on wet or icy roads. Weather outlook for days ahead Western and northern Türkiye will continue to face severe weather conditions with heavy rain and strong winds, while snow and freezing temperatures dominate the central and eastern regions.\nThe current cold front is expected to maintain cooler-than-average conditions across most provinces, with some temporary stabilization before intensifying again.\nResidents and visitors should remain cautious, plan activities around weather conditions, and follow safety measures to minimize disruptions and risks.",

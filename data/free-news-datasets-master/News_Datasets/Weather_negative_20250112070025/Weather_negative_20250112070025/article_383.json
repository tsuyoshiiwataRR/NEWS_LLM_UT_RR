    "text": "Friday, December 13: Delhiites woke up shivering and surrounded by smog this morning. While unpleasant, these conditions are far from surprising for the national capital given the drop in temperatures throughout the week.\nThe mercury fell to 4.9°C in Delhi earlier this week, marking one of the sharpest cold waves in recent years. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) attributed this to strong northwesterly winds and the absence of significant Western disturbances, which are expected to keep temperatures between 4°C and 6°C for the coming days.\nFurther, coldwave conditions have been forecast in and around Delhi, like in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Uttar Pradesh. As per the IMD, a coldwave is declared in the plains when temperatures drop to 4°C or fall 4.5–6.4 degrees below normal.\nAdding to the discomfort, the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) remained in the \" poor\" category on Friday morning, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The stagnant cold air traps pollutants closer to the ground, amplifying the smog and reducing visibility.\nToday, a thin layer of fog enveloped parts of the city as the minimum temperature dipped to 6°C. Morning visuals from India Gate and Kartavya Path revealed a smog layer, which reduced visibility significantly.\nSpecific AQI readings included 280 in Alipur, 296 in Ashok Vihar, 280 in ITO, and 228 at DTU. Higher levels of pollution were observed in Anand Vihar (309), Dwarka Sector 8 (315), Nehru Nagar (334), IGI Airport Terminal 3 (281), Rohini (329), Pusa (309), and Mundka (307). The overall AQI for Delhi at 7 AM was recorded at 277.\nThe AQI categories range from \"good\" (0-50) to \"severe\" (401-500), with \"poor\" (201-300) indicating significant health risks for sensitive groups.\nAccording to forecasts, air quality is unlikely to improve significantly over the weekend, exacerbating health risks for residents. Experts caution that such conditions could lead to respiratory issues and cardiovascular stress, especially for vulnerable groups. Authorities recommend that residents minimise outdoor activities, use air purifiers indoors, and wear protective masks when stepping out.\nTo help vulnerable populations, night shelters have been set up in several locations, including Jama Masjid and Nizamuddin flyover. More temporary solutions like restrictions on vehicle emissions and construction activities have been implemented during peak pollution months, but the city needs sustained efforts to combat seasonal smog.\n**\nFor weather, science, space, and COVID-19 updates on the go, download [The Weather Channel App](https://weather.onelink.me/2902176432/ca9eb560) (on Android and iOS store).

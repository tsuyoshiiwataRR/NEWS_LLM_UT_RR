    "text": "GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn â€” The likelihood of freezing rain or a wintry mix late Friday into Saturday morning triggered a Weather Impact Alert from the KARE 11 weather team.\nJohn Zeigler of Sunrise says the Weather Impact Alert covers Saturday from 12 a.m. to 6 p.m. due to the potential impact on roads, especially in Minnesota's southern and southeastern regions.\nA winter weather advisory has also been issued by the National Weather Service Saturday for the chance of slick roads due to freezing drizzle and sleet.\nZeigler says warmer air is set to move in over our Arctic air mass Friday night into Saturday morning as a weak low-pressure center moves in just south of the Twin Cities. That will result in a batch of sleet and freezing drizzle during the morning hours, likely changing over to light snow in the afternoon before the event wraps up.\nThe highest chance of freezing rain and bad roads remains just south of the metro with more sleet mixing in with the freezing rain around the cities.\nThis will not be an event with big accumulations. Zeigler expects around one inch of snow/sleet, and less than .02 inch of freezing rain, defined as a glaze.",

    "text": "Stormy Saturday: Strong winds ahead of downpours and big Sierra snow\nThe morning will be wet and windy in the Valley and Foothills.\nThe morning will be wet and windy in the Valley and Foothills.\nThe morning will be wet and windy in the Valley and Foothills.\nThis weekend will start off stormy with strong winds, Valley downpours and heavy Sierra snow.\nSaturday is a KCRA 3 weather Impact Day with the worst conditions for the Valley expected in the morning.\nHere is a breakdown of what to expect with the rain, snow and wind.\nWind\nStrong winds will be widespread ahead of sunrise Saturday morning. Much of the Valley will see gusts of 35 to 45 mph between 6 a.m. and 1 p.m. Winds of this strength could scatter or damage any loose items in yards. Homeowners should double check their holiday decorations on Friday afternoon to make sure they are secure.\nThe Foothills will see a couple of hours of strong winds later in the morning as well, especially south of Highway 50.\nWind gusts over the Sierra crest could top 60 mph. This will affect operations at ski resorts.\nWind will gradually weaken Saturday afternoon into the evening.\nSnow\nSnow showers will lead to more chain controls during the day on Friday. Travel over the summits will be easiest during the afternoon.\nThe snow level will start around 5,000 feet and then rise to 6,000 feet. Donner Summit will pick up three to six inches of snow during the day on Friday.\nSaturday will not be a good day for travel in the mountains.\nA more intense round of snow is in the forecast. Steady snow will fall from early morning through the evening and it will accumulate quickly at times. Snowfall combined with gusty winds will significantly reduce visibility and make travel dangerous.\nSaturday's snow totals could reach 12 to 18 inches at Donner Summit. Tahoe area ski resorts could see as much as three feet of new snow between Friday and Saturday.\nSunday will be a clear day with lighter winds.\nRain\nIt will not rain all day Saturday, but a couple of bands of wet weather could bring some big downpours. One round will come through around 4 a.m. Saturday. A second round is possible between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.\nThese bands of rain could trigger lightning and thunder as they roll into the Foothills later in the morning.\nThe afternoon will be mainly dry in the Valley, but isolated downpours and thunderstorms are still possible until sunset.\nRainfall between Thursday and Saturday will help bring most Northern California locations close to their respective average amounts for this point in December.\nREAL-TIME TRAFFIC MAP\nClick here to see our interactive traffic map.\nTRACK INTERACTIVE, DOPPLER RADAR\nClick here to see our interactive radar.\nDOWNLOAD OUR APP FOR THE LATEST\nHere is where you can download our app.\nFollow our KCRA weather team on social media\n- Meteorologist Tamara Berg on\nX.\n- Meteorologist Dirk Verdoorn on\n- Meteorologist/Climate Reporter Heather Waldman on\nhttps://twitter.com/KCRAHeather.\n- Meteorologist Kelly Curran on\nhttps://twitter.com/KCRAKelly.\nWatch our forecasts on TV or online\nHere's\nwhere to find our latest video forecast.

    "text": "By Michele Powers ,\n8 hours ago\n\"\nNOW: The cold air has returned and there will be reinforcing shots of it through the next two days. Temperatures will run below normal with highs only in the 30s Friday and Saturday. The winds will make it feel even colder. Wind chills for the morning will feel like the teens and then Friday afternoon will feel more like the 20s at times. NEXT: A mild surge of air comes back on Sunday and through early next week, expect more clouds on Sunday into Monday. Rain is likely to arrive on Monday, there is a risk of some snow or wintry mix before it goes over to all rain. NIGHT SKY: The Geminid meteor shower peaks tonight into Friday. The sky will be clear, but the moon is bright and up all night. The moon will be full on Sunday. This could drown out some of the dimmer meteors. Gemini rises higher in the sky after 9 p.m. in the East, so any time after that is good for viewing. FRIDAY : Mostly sunny and colder. High of 35. SATURDAY: Mostly sunny. High of 37. SUNDAY: Mostly cloudy, not as cold. High of 44. MONDAY: Mostly cloudy, risk of rain showers. Warmer. High of 48. TUESDAY: Mostly cloudy, showers. High of 55. WEDNESDAY : Partly sunny. High of 47. THURSDAY: Mostly cloudy with rain. High of 48. \" Be the first to react",

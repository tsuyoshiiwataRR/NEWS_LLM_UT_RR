    "text": "Chilly weekend ahead in Charlotte before warmer temps next week\nWeekend to end cold, potentially rainy\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - A chilly weekend is ahead with warmer weather on the way next week.\nFriday is starting off cold, with morning lows bottoming out in the upper 20s around Charlotte. Afternoon highs will reach the mid-50s with dry conditions in store; however, some clouds will move in.\nSaturday will be similar to Friday, although morning temperatures will be about five degrees warmer. Highs will again be in the mid-50s with very little rain chance in Charlotte.\nPotential for some scattered showers will re-enter the forecast Sunday, but the chance is not high. Any rain that does fall will likely not total very much. Highs will only reach about 50 degrees or a little below.\nMonday will mark a return to the 60s, with highs forecast to reach the mid-60s both Tuesday and Thursday of next week.\nDownload the free [WBTV Weather app](https://www.wbtv.com/page/apps/) on your mobile device, to receive weather alerts and get your latest WBTV weather forecast on the go.

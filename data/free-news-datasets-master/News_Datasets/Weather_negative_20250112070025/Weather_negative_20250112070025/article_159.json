    "text": "...AIR STAGNATION ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 2 PM MST FRIDAY... * WHAT...An extended period of stagnant air, with light winds and little vertical mixing. This is due to an inversion near the surface that will continue to trap pollutants. * WHERE...Portions of southwest and west central Idaho and southeast Oregon. * WHEN...Until 2 PM MST Friday. * IMPACTS...Poor air quality may cause issues for people with respiratory problems. PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS... Persons with respiratory illness should follow their physicians advice for dealing with high levels of air pollution during periods of stagnant air. State air quality agencies highly recommend that no outdoor burning occur and that residential wood burning devices be limited as much as possible. According to state air quality agencies, prolonged periods of stagnant air can hold pollutants close to the ground where people live and breathe. Check with your local burn agency for any current restrictions in your area. && Sign up today for one of our great newsletters and get headlines right in your inbox every morning.

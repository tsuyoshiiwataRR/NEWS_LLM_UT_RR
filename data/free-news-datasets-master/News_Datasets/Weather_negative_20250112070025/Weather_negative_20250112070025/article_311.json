    "text": "On the predicted lines, many parts of Tamil Nadu were lashed with heavy to very heavy rains in the past 24 hours. In addition to the coastline, the heavy rains extended to reach the interiors and the hilly resorts like Ooty and Kodaikanal, as well. Good rains battered some parts of Kerala and the union territory of Puducherry and Karaikal. Some respite is likely over the next two days, on 14th and 15thDec2024.\nIn the past 24 hours, the state capital observatory at Meenambakkam recorded 106mm rainfall. The heaviest rainfall along the coastline was at Karaikal, registering a deluge of 203mm, till today morning and the rains still continue. Over 100mm of rainfall was recorded at Tiruttani, Nagappattinam, Parangipettai and Kodaikanal. The weather activity will reduce today and will remain confined to the central parts of the coastline and interiors of Tamil Nadu, bordering the Kerala region.\nThe well-marked low-pressure area is now lying over the Gulf of Mannar and Comorin region. It will move further westward to Lakshadweep and the Maldives region. The system will weaken over the next 24 hours. Therefore, the weather intensity and spread will decrease substantially for about 48 hours, between 14th and 15th Dec. Today, heavy rainfall is likely over Pamban, Tondi, Tuticorin, Nagappattinam and adjoining parts. This activity will also ease out tonight and in the wee hours tomorrow.\nHowever, the respite is likely to be short and sweet. Another weather system, very close to the heels of the current one, is following and moving east to west. A cyclonic circulation is marked over the Southeast Bay of Bengal and South Andaman Sea. This will reach central parts of South Bay tomorrow and in the proximity of eastern coast of Sri Lanka, a day later on 15th Dec 2024. Another wave of heavy weather activity is likely for the state of Tamil Nadu, more so the central region of the coast, on 16th and 17th Dec 2024. The state capital Chennai also remains within reach of intense weather and there need to exercise caution.",

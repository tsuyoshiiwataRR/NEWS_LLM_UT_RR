    "text": "A STORM TRACK RED ALERT DAY is in place tonight through Saturday afternoon due to ice accumulations making travel dangerous to near impossible at times. Power outages and tree damage may be possible.\nTonight (ICE STORM WARNING): Around 9-10 PM, some light snow/freezing rain may be possible on our western edge, then starts to move east and picks up in intensity through the night hours. The worst of the ice is along and south of highway 20, where much of the area is under an ice storm warning. However, all of the area could see ice accumulations higher than 0.10 inches. Temperatures warm through the overnight hours into the lower 30s with a strong southeast wind at 10-20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph.\nSaturday (ICE STORM WARNING): The worst of the ice is during the morning hours on Saturday, as nearly everyone sees freezing rain falling and sticking to the roads. Please be very very careful if you must travel Saturday morning. The worst of the accumulations is over after the noon hour, but some ice could still stick to the roads through the afternoon. As we head through the afternoon, that freezing rain turns into a rain/snow mix. Highs reach into the mid 30s with a southeast wind at 10-15 mph with gusts up to 25 mph.\nSaturday Night: A rain/snow mix early, then tapers off after midnight. Lows do dip to around freezing in the low 30s, so be mindful of possible re-freeze. Winds are light out of the east at 5 mph.\nSunday: A cloudy and quieter day with highs in the upper 30s and low 40s. Winds are out of the south at 5-15 mph. A light rain may be possible late Sunday into early Monday.\nNext Week: We stay mild through Tuesday with highs in the upper 30s and low 40s. Colder air returns Wednesday and we remain dry for much of the week.",

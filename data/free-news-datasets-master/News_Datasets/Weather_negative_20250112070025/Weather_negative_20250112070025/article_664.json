    "text": "Bundle up, New Yorkers, because it's about to be unseasonably cold into the weekend, according to meteorologists. “ Typically, this time of the year a normal high would be somewhere around 45 degrees,” John Cristantello with the National Weather Service said on Friday. “For today, we're only going to be in the mid 30s.” Saturday and Sunday should warm up slightly, with Sunday’s highs in the low 40s, he said. But the real thaw-out won’t happen until the beginning of next week, when temperatures are expected to climb back into the 50s. “ On Monday and Tuesday, the winds are going to shift a little more from the south, and that should help push up the temperatures a bit,” Cristantello added. “So it'll actually be above normal on Monday.” The skies should stay dry and mostly sunny throughout the weekend, according to the National Weather Service. The New York region is still experiencing drought conditions despite the recent rains, experts told Gothamist this week.",

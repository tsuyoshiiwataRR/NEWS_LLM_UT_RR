    "text": "Australians are [set to swelter](/weather) over the next few days with parts of the country hitting 40 degrees.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) says a heatwave affecting Western Australia will move south-east peaking across South Australia on December 15 and Victoria and inland NSW on December 16.\nMaximum temperatures will be up to 14 degrees above the average for December.\nThe worst hit areas in regional NSW will be Ivanhoe and Wilcannia which are forecast to peak at 48 degrees on December 16.\nMildura, Griffith and Tibooburra will hit 45 degrees.\nWhile in Victoria, Bendigo will peak at 43 degrees and Bairnsdale and Ballarat will get to 38 degrees by December 16.\nA [Weatherzone](https://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/victorias-first-45c-in-four-years-on-the-horizon/1890198) alert said the heatwave would bring the highest temperatures of the year to much of Victoria, including Melbourne as well as Victoria's first 45 degree day in four years.\n\"Current forecasts suggest the temperature in Melbourne should reach the low thirties on Sunday before soaring to 40 degrees on Monday,\" the alert said. \"If it gets this hot, it would be Melbourne's first 40 degree day of 2024.\"\nHeat will build fuelled by strong winds\nBOM senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury told ACM the heat would \"build across southeastern parts of Australia, fuelled by strong winds,\" on December 13 and December 14.\n\"It's mainly impacting southern parts of Western Australia currently,\" she said. \"They are sitting in the midst of the most significant heatwave that they've seen so far this summer.\n\"But it is not going to be until later today and into tomorrow that this heat starts shifting eastwards and pushing into the eastern states.\"\nMs Bradbury said on December 15 and 16 the heatwave conditions would \"ramp up\" in Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and inland NSW.\n'Many areas will push up into the mid to high 30s at least, if not the low to mid 40s, in particular those hottest temperatures reaching even high 40s across inland parts of NSW and some northern parts of Victoria as well,\" she said.\nCoastal areas, that benefit from sea breezes, would manage to escape the worst of the heatwave, she said.\nThe cool change should hit inland NSW late on December 17 and 18 but other areas should experience relief earlier.",

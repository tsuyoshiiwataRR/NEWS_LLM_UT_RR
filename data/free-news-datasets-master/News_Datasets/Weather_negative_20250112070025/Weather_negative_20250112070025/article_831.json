    "text": "Ranchi: Ranchi met centre on Friday kept up its cold wave alert as several parts of the state witnessed temperatures below normal for the second consecutive day. Cold wave alerts were issued for Bokaro, Dhanbad, and Ramgarh districts for the next two days.The IMD has also forecast predominantly clear skies for the rest of Jharkhand over the next five days, along with early morning mist or fog. Ranchi's minimum temperatures are expected to range between 9 degrees Celsius and 11 degrees Celsius, with maximum temperatures hovering around 23 degrees Celsius to 24 degrees Celsius. North-east Jharkhand, including Godda and Pakur, may see slightly warmer days, with maximum temperatures reaching up to 26 degrees Celsius.\\\"The cold wave conditions are due to the prevailing north-westerly winds over Jharkhand, leading to a significant drop in minimum temperatures in affected regions,\\\" Ranchi met centre's director- in-charge Abhishek Anand said.The IMD has advised residents, especially vulnerable groups such as the elderly and children, to avoid prolonged exposure to low temperatures and remain indoors during night-time. Farmers are also encouraged to adopt protective measures to shield crops from the cold.In its evening weather bulletin, IMD said that the night-time temperature in Ranchi hovered at 9 degrees Celsius. Dhanbad recorded a night-time temperature of 11 degrees Celsius while Daltonganj recorded 7.9 degrees Celsius and Bokaro recorded 8.1 degrees Celsius.Akshay Kumar, a resident of Ramgarh, said, \\\"The cold is biting, and mornings have been challenging, especially for those travelling early. We rely heavily on warm layers and hot beverages to cope with the chilly weather.\\\"",

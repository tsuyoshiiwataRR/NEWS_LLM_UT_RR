    "text": "[Home](/)\n[Weather and Climate](/category/weather-and-climate/)\nTropical Cyclone Chido Forecast To Hit Zimbabwe On December 17\nThe Meteorological Services Department (MSD) announced on Thursday that Zimbabwe may be impacted by Tropical Cyclone Chido, which is currently affecting the northeastern region of Madagascar.\nIn an advisory, the MSD predicted that Tropical Cyclone Chido is expected to cross into Zimbabwe on December 17.\nThe cyclone is likely to bring strong winds and heavy rainfall exceeding 70 millimetres within 24 hours in certain areas. Said the MSD:\nThe tropical system Chido, which is still to the North-East of Madagascar, has intensified into an INTENSE TROPICAL CYCLONE over the past twenty-four hours and its chances of affecting Zimbabwe have greatly increased.\nIt is likely to cross into Zimbabwe on the 17th of December 2024 bringing with it strong winds and heavy rainfalls of more than 70mm in 24 hours over some places in Manicaland, Masvingo, Mashonaland East, Mashonaland Central, Harare metropolitan and some parts of Midlands and Mashonaland West.\nMeanwhile, the Department of Civil Protection has urged citizens to be vigilant for heavy rains, thunderstorms, strong winds, potential flooding, rockfalls, and mudflows.\nThe public is advised to secure their homes against damaging winds and to establish evacuation plans in preparation for severe weather conditions.\nTropical Cyclone Chido is the third low-pressure system that has threatened Southern Africa this year.\nThe first storm of the 2024-2025 cyclone season in the southwest Indian Ocean, named Ancha, was designated by the Comoros.\nFollowing this, Cyclone Bheki was named by Eswatini. The name Chido was provided by Zimbabwe.\nIf another storm forms before the season ends, it will be named Dikeledi, designated by South Africa.\nEach year, tropical cyclones are named in alphabetical order, alternating between male and female names.\nThe list of names is proposed by the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) members in a specific region and is approved by the corresponding tropical cyclone regional bodies during their annual or biannual sessions.\nZimbabwe has also provided the name Yemurai for the 25th storm of the season.\nMore: [Pindula News](https://www.pindula.co.zw/)\nTags\n2 Comments\nLeave a Comment\n[Generate a Whatsapp Message](https://zero.pindula.co.zw/whatsapp/?url=https://www.pindula.co.zw/2024/12/13/tropical-cyclone-chido-forecast-to-hit-zimbabwe-on-december-17/?article)\nBuy Phones on Credit.\n[More Deals](/market/)\n[Feedback](/contact/)",

    "text": "The Bureau of meteorology (BoM) in Australia has issued warnings for fire weather and severe heatwaves across the country as temperatures are set to rise in the coming days. In a post shared on its official X account, the bureau said: \\\"As hot weather moves across Australia, there is a high likelihood of both fire weather warnings and severe heatwave warnings being issued across the country.\\\"— BOM_au (@BOM_au) According to Weatherzone, a severe to extreme heatwave is expected to impact several states and territories, pushing temperatures to the mid to high 40s in some areas. This intense heatwave will be driven by a hot air mass in northern Australia being drawn southeast by a broad low-pressure trough.This weekend and early next week, temperatures are forecasted to reach 45–46°C in parts of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia. For many regions, this will mark the hottest weather of the year so far. While the most extreme temperatures will be outside major cities, capitals such as Adelaide, Melbourne, Canberra, and Western Sydney will also feel the effects.The heatwave is also expected to exacerbate fire risks, particularly in Victoria and South Australia on Monday, with widespread high fire danger forecast elsewhere over the weekend and into next week.This coinciding heat across southeastern Australia may strain the National electricity market (NEM), though authorities have not yet predicted power outages, said Weatherzone.",

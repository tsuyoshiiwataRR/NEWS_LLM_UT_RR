The following schools will have a delayed start:\n- Chapman School\n- Fireweed Academy Charter School\n- Homer Flex\n- Homer High School\n- Homer Middle School\n- K-Selo School\n- McNeil Canyon Elementary School\n- Nikolaevsk School\n- Ninilchik School\n- Paul Banks Elementary School\n- Razdolna School\n- Voznesenka School\n- West Homer Elementary School\nBuses will pick up students two hours later than normal. Student absences related to unsafe travel conditions will be excused, the district said. Parents should contact the school if their student needs to stay home.\nSee a spelling or grammar error?

    "text": "India vs Australia, Brisbane Weather Forecast: Thunderstorms Expected To Play Spoilsport At The Gabba\nCheck out the weather forecast for the opening day of the third game of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series set to be played at the Gabba in Brisbane.\nAfter conceding a 10-wicket loss in the second Test, India will now look to bounce back in the next fixture scheduled to start on Saturday, December 14. The third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy will be played at the Gabba in Brisbane.\nIndia started the series on a promising note with a 295-run in the opening contest played in Perth. In the second Test, a pink-ball affair, the hosts completed a quick comeback to level the series.\nrelated stories\nIndia got the better of the Aussies in the last Test played between the two teams at The Gabba in 2021. In that game, the visitors had chased down a target of 328 runs to clinch a memorable victory by three wickets. Indian players will now be eager to replicate the same show and win the Test in Brisbane once again this time.\nWeather Forecast:\nAccording to the forecast shown on AccuWeather, we can expect a fairly pleasant start to the opening day’s play but there is a 64 per cent chance of thunderstorms from 2-3 pm, which could interfere with the final session’s play. Expect temperatures to range between 22 and 28 degrees Celsius, with the humidity expected to touch the 81 per cent mark.\nPitch Report:\nThe pitch for the third Border-Gavaskar Test series can see the typical pace and bounce as the game is set to take place in the early part of the summer season. The Gabba’s curator also mentioned that there might be a bit more to offer in terms of pace.\n“Different times of year definitely make it different, it can be a slightly different pitch,\" Gabba curator David Sandurski was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.\n“Pitches later in the season might have a bit more wear and tear while ones early in the season usually are a bit fresher and might have a bit more in them. Generally speaking, we still prepare the pitch the exact same way every time to try and get the same good carry, pace and bounce that the Gabba is known for. We are just trying to make a traditional Gabba wicket like we do each year,\" he added.\n- Location :\n- First Published:\n[News](/)\n[cricket](/cricket/)India vs Australia, Brisbane Weather Forecast: Thunderstorms Expected To Play Spoilsport At The Gabba",

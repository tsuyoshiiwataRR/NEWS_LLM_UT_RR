This closure is in response to the forecasted [extreme weather conditions](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/india/tamil-nadu-rains-chennai-heavy-rain-alert-1.10154842), which include very heavy rainfall expected in parts of southern Tamil Nadu.\nIn addition to Puducherry and Karaikal, educational institutions in 11 districts of Tamil Nadu have been given a holiday, including in Chennai, Villupuram, and Thanjavur. Local authorities have decided to close schools and colleges to ensure the safety of students and staff amid the ongoing stormy weather. The closures come as a precautionary measure in light of the severe rainfall and thunderstorms predicted in these areas.\nYellow alert issued for several districts\nA yellow alert has been issued for districts such as Madurai, Sivaganga, and Dindigul, warning of moderate rains and thunderstorms. Residents are advised to stay updated with weather reports and take necessary precautions.\nThe IMD has also issued warnings for fishermen, advising them to avoid venturing into coastal areas, including the Sri Lanka coast, Comorin area, and Gulf of Mannar, due to rough sea conditions. The low-pressure area in the southwest Bay of Bengal near the Gulf of Mannar is causing vigorous activity from the Northeast Monsoon, which has already resulted in heavy rainfall in many areas.\nAlso Read\nAgencies",

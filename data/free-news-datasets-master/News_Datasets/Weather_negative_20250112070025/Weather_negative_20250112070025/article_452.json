    "text": "Strong winds and cold snap: SES warns of bad weather over the weekend\nKyiv • UNN\nThe State Emergency Service warns of a sharp drop to -8°C and wind gusts of up to 20 m/s over the weekend. In the mountains, the temperature may drop to -14°C, and precautionary measures are recommended.\nUkraine is expected to experience a sharp cold snap over the weekend and strong wind gusts of up to 20 m/s. Temperatures will drop to -8 degrees in some places, and to -14 degrees in mountainous areas. This was announced by the spokesman of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine Oleksandr Khorunzhyi during a briefing on Friday, a correspondent of UNN reports.\nDetails\n\"We will record the cold snap today, on Saturday and Sunday. Thermometers will drop in different ways - down to -8, and if we talk about the mountains, then down to -14 degrees,\" Khorunzhyi said.\nHe noted that wind gusts of up to 20 m/s are expected in Ukraine from today and focused on measures that can help avoid emergencies during such weather.\n\"Today and tomorrow there will be wind gusts of 15-20 m/s. In these conditions, I would like to draw people's attention to the fact that, firstly, they should wear comfortable, embossed shoes, and secondly, they should not park their cars under the boards, under trees, under power poles, because wind gusts can bring these down, and accordingly, the property will be in danger, which can cause an emergency,\" he warned.\nRecall\nWeather forecaster Natalia Didenko [noted](https://unn.ua/news/sylnykh-moroziv-naiblyzhchym-chasom-ne-bude-synoptykynia)that the cold snap in Ukraine is short-lived and only warming is expected in the near future.",

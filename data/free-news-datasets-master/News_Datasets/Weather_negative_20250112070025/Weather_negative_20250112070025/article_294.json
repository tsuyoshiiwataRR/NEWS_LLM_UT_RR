    "text": "By Jennifer Zucker ,\n6 hours ago\nFRESNO, Calif. ( KSEE/KGPE ) – A storm drenched the morning commute and dropped snow in the nearby mountains.\n“Last year, we didn’t even see really this much precip until January,” said Mikal Montgomery, a National Weather Service meteorologist.\nMontgomery said the Thursday morning rainfall was just one of three waves of rain the Central Valley can expect over the next few days.\n“We are seeing more precipitation than expected for this time of year,” Montgomery said.\nHe said it may be best for drivers to take it slow on the road this weekend.\n“Give yourself more time and just look out. Look at the forecast before you leave your home,” Montgomery said.\nAssistant Director for Public Works City of Fresno Brian Russell said the city’s storm response team has been efficient.\n“With nearly 1900 miles of streets, we have a crew of street sweepers that sweeps every day. And we do that throughout the year. The reason we do all that is so when it does rain, when water goes down the drain, it’s as clean as possible and it’s unobstructed and flows as it should,” Russell said.\nHe said to use the FresGo app to report potholes or flooding on the road.\n“Once they log in, it really just walks you through it and they can report the location and what the issue is. And then that gets logged into our system and then we have a team dispatching those calls,” Russell said.\nArea residents near China Peak should be in for some good ski conditions in the days and weeks ahead.\n“It’s cold. Very low. Snow level, very low. Probably 4,000 feet, which basically means it’s going to be a colder snow and a lighter flake,” Tim Cohee, president of China Peak, said.\nCohee asked folks to be mindful of the roads.\n“You’re going to want to have chains. If you have four-wheel drive, have them in the vehicle. And really, you know everything just needs to slow down because you never know what’s going to happen,” Cohee said.\nThe city said to call 311 or go to the FresGo App.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

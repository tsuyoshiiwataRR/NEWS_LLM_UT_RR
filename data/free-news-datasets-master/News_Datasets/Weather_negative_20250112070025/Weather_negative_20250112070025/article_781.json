Once this finally clears through, we will see some blustery showers feeding in behind it, affecting the very far north and north west, and some of these could be wintry on higher ground. Away from that, we have a dry and clear night ahead that will lead to some frost in places and also some icy stretches where we‚Äôve had any showers.\nOn Saturday, we have a brief spell of sunshine in the morning ahead of clouds and outbreaks of rain moving in from the west. We then enter a warmer sector of air, and therefore, things will be turning milder, with temperatures climbing throughout the weekend.\nBy Sunday, we see a trailing cold front lingering across the north of Scotland. It doesn‚Äôt go anywhere and sticks around for a good couple of days, bringing persistent rain. This is why the Met Office has issued a weather warning for rain that lasts from Sunday evening until Tuesday afternoon.\nWe will likely see flooding in places and tricky travel conditions as 70-100mm of rain is expected within the warning zone during that timeframe. Any snowmelt in the area will also contribute to this.\nOut of the warning zone, we will still see some outbreaks of rain, with things remaining changeable and unsettled for the first half of the week but not as persistent or heavy.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country\nFollow STV News\nFollow STV News on WhatsApp Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country\nPosted in Weather",

    "text": "The lowest temperature of this winter season was recorded today (13 December) in Tetulia, Panchagarh, with mercury dropping to 8.4°C. Earlier, the lowest temperature in the country was recorded in Gopalganj and Chuadanga at 10.2°C yesterday. In Tetulia, the lowest temperature yesterday was 12.6°C and the highest temperature of the upazila was 24.8 at around 3pm. According to meteorologists, it can be said a mild cold wave is blowing over an area if the minimum temperature of the day in an area is between 8°C and 10°C. A mild cold wave is sweeping through the northern and western regions, with districts such as Panchagarh, Rajshahi, and Chuadanga experiencing the chill. This cold wave is expected to persist for the time being, according to Bangladesh Meteorological Department's latest weather bulletin today (13 December). Panchagarh Deputy Commissioner Md Sabet Ali told Prothom Alo that the government has already allocated Tk15 lakh to buy 2,000 blankets and winter clothes for the cold-stricken people of Panchagarh. Distribution process of these have started. Apart from this, various organisations have already distributed about 10,000 blankets in different areas of the district privately, he added. Meanwhile, winter has also arrived in Dhaka as well. City dwellers are greeted with a shroud of fog in the early morning with cool breeze blowing throughout the day. Over the next few days, the weather across Bangladesh is expected to remain mostly dry with a temporary partly cloudy sky, according to the met office bulletin. Both night and day temperatures are expected to fall slightly across the country, reports the met office. With the onset of winter, fog has already started disrupting services like flights and ferries across the country due to low visibility. Today's met office bulletin states that moderate to thick fog may occur at places over the country from midnight till noon.",

    "text": "Freezing rain, snow to lead to hazardous conditions Saturday\nFreezing rain mixed with snow tonight, Saturday morning will lead to hazardous driving conditions.\nA low pressure system moving through the Midwest will bring freezing rain mixed with snow tonight and Saturday as temperatures gradually warm up.\nSkies will become mostly cloudy through this morning as temperatures slowly reach a high in the mid to upper-teens across the area. As the system approaches to the south of us, temperatures are expected to rise. This means we will reach our low in the low to mid-teens through the early evening hours. Once we reach our low, temperatures are actually going to slowly rise back into the upper-teens and low-20s by the late night and overnight hours. With this rise in temperatures on the way, the upper atmosphere will also warm up. The warming temperatures at the surface and upper atmosphere will lead to some messy precipitation chances for the area starting late tonight and continuing into Saturday.\nBy late tonight, between 10 pm and midnight (12 am), a wintery mix of freezing rain and snow is projected to move into the area from the southwest. This mix of freezing rain and snow is projected to continue through Saturday morning and into the mid-afternoon hours for portions of the area (areas east of Mankato).\nFreezing rain brings concerns as it leads to very icy and slick conditions on surfaces. Freezing rain is more like a glazing of ice, meaning, there really is no traction when freezing rain occurs in an area. Because of this, it is important to understand that freezing rain is one of the more dangerous types of precipitation and/or hazardous weather conditions to be out and about in as there are usually many spin outs, crashes/accidents, and cars sliding off the road into ditches.\nIt is advised to not go out and about late tonight or Saturday morning as roads are expected to be very slick and dangerous for everyone, including emergency officials/authorities. If you have to go out and about early Saturday morning, it is advised to make sure you have a safety kit in your vehicle just in case. The safety kit should include items such as extra clothes for everyone in the vehicle, blankets, nonperishable foods/snacks, water for everyone, chargers for smart devices, a flashlight or two, extra batteries for the flashlights, some candles (or crayons as those burn slowly and warm), and a lighter or some matches. Of course, other items you or the others in your car may need (like medications for example) should also be included in the safety kit, along with items for your vehicle like jumper cables.\nThe freezing rain-snow mix may continue through the mid-afternoon hours in southern Minnesota and northern Iowa before wrapping up Saturday afternoon/evening. Temperatures are projected to hover in the low-30s through the afternoon hours with winds up to 15 mph mixed in. Saturday night will remain cloudy as temperatures dip into the upper-20s by Sunday morning.\nOnce the freezing rain and snow clear out of the area, we could have up to a tenth of an inch (0.10″) of ice built up on surfaces and a possible dusting of snow in portions of the area.\nSunday will be quieter but cloudy. We are looking at highs in the mid-30s with winds reaching up to 15 mph. Sunday night will remain cloudy with temperatures dipping into the low-30s by Monday morning.\nThe next chance of precipitation will move in throughout Monday as a cold front moves through the area. Temperatures are projected to hover in the mid-30s through the early to mid-afternoon hours. As the next round of precipitation develops in the area, we will likely see a mix of rain and snow with temperatures in the mid-30s; however, as temperatures start to drop through the mid to late afternoon hours, the rain/snow mix will start to transition to just snow for the evening before wrapping up, leaving behind mostly cloudy skies. Temperatures are projected to drop into the low-20s by Tuesday morning.\nTuesday will continue to be mostly cloudy with a chance of some light snow around the area. Temperatures are anticipated to hover in the mid-20s with winds reaching up to 10 mph throughout the day. Tuesday night will continue with mostly cloudy skies as temperatures dip into the low-teens by Wednesday morning.\nWednesday through Friday of next week will then be nice and quiet with a mix of mostly cloudy skies to partly cloudy skies. As of right now, we aren’t looking at any big precipitation chances next week. Instead, we may just see some flurries on Thursday. Temperatures will hover in the low to mid-20s with winds ranging between 5 and 15 mph with occasional gusts up to 20 mph at times. Overnight temperatures will be on the colder side, dipping into the single digits and teens by the following mornings.\nSaturday and Sunday of next weekend will remain rather quiet but with more sunshine mixed in as we are looking at mostly sunny skies for both days. Temperatures through next weekend are projected to hover in the low to mid-20s with winds reaching up to 15 mph. Overnight temperatures will continue to be on the colder side as the are anticipated to drop to around 11 degrees by Sunday morning and the low-20s by Monday morning.\n[Click here to download the KEYC News Now app or our KEYC First Alert weather app.](https://www.keyc.com/page/keyc-apps-for-ios-and-android-devices/)\nCopyright 2024 KEYC.

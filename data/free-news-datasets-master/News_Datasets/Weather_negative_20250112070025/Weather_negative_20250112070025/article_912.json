    "text": "###\nGet ready for a wet weekend, Humboldt!\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) has issued a flood watch for coastal communities and low-lying areas in the Eel River Valley where two to five inches of rain can be expected in the next 24 hours. Some areas of Southern Humboldt could see up to eight inches of rain in the same period.\n“You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible flood warnings,” according to the NWS flood alert. “There will be an increased risk of rock and landslides along roadways. … Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared to take action should flooding develop.”\nHumboldt County Public Works has already reported closures on some county-maintained roads, including Coffee Creek and Meridian roads in Ferndale. There’s also flooding reported on Pine Hill Road. The McCann Bridge is closed but the McCann Ferry is running.\nCoastal communities should also be aware of King Tides, unusually high tides caused when the sun, moon and Earth align, creating a “stronger than normal gravitational pull” that can increase tides by one to two feet, according to the NWS. When coupled with storm surges, King Tides can dramatically increase the potential for coastal flooding and property damage.\nCoastal flooding can be expected in low-lying areas of Humboldt Bay, particularly in King Salmon and along Jackson Road in the Arcata Bottoms.\nIf you happen to capture some photos of these super-high tides, send ‘em over to the California Coastal Commission! Those interested can submit their photos to the California King Tides Project [at this link](www.coastal.ca.gov/kingtides). If you do decide to go take photos, please do so safely.\nThere’s also a high wind advisory in effect for Humboldt and Del Norte counties. Winds ranging between 25 and 35 mph can be expected, with gusts up to 60 mph across higher elevations, according to the NWS. Take extra caution while driving, especially if you have a big vehicle.\nKeep an eye on Caltrans Quickmap or the Caltrans District 1 Facebook page for current road conditions. We’ll update this post if we hear about any additional closures.\nStay safe, Humboldt!",

    "text": "Be prepared for severe weather power outages\nTWIN FALLS, Idaho (KMVT/KSVT) —Our winter weather can sometimes lead to power outages here in Idaho.\n“When an outage happens you need to be prepared because if you’re prepared then you won’t panic,” Angela Miller from Idaho Power said.\nWhen the lights go out and the heat turns off Miller says there are some important things to know to stay safe.\nTurn off appliances that you were using when the power went out, especially electric ranges and space heaters, to prevent the possibility of a fire if you’re away when power is restored.\nAlso prepare for medical needs, such as refrigerated medicine or electrically powered medical equipment. This could mean finding a place you can go during an outage or buying a backup generator.\nOnly use generators in well-ventilated areas.\n“If you are in an outage, also leave one light on so you know when it comes back on. Other things that you should do is know how to open your garage, so if your power goes out, you’re not trapped,” Miller explained.\nDuring the winter months, outages can be more severe, lasting hours or even days.\n“We can see transformers that blow. A lot of times you’ll see when the temperature drops extremely low. There’ll be an extra surge on those power lines,” Jackie Frey, Coordinator of the Twin Falls County Office of Emergency Management said.\nJackie Frey, with the Twin Falls County Office of Emergency Management, said when experiencing an outage you’ll want to make sure to have non-perishable food and water on hand, ”We’re not looking at making full meals, we’re looking at hydration and nutrition. Making sure that what you have is healthy and that it can help sustain you.\"\nThere are also other items you’ll want to make sure are in your emergency kits.\n“You would put things in it like flashlights, maybe a radio that you could crank, some granola bars. I recommend always having games and books for your kids,” Miller stated.\nA reminder that each person should have their own kit, and you can check for updates if there is an outage on Idaho Power’s website.\nCopyright 2024 KMVT.

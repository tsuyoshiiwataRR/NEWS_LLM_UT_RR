    "text": "For those working in today’s winter weather conditions -- that means exposure to dangerously cold temperatures.\nIt’s a combination that can be deadly.\nFreezing temps, blizzard blindness and ice-covered roads.\nThe U.S Department of Transportation said 24 percent of weather-related vehicle crashes occur on snowy, slushy or icy roads -- and 15 percent of accidents happen on snowfall or sleet.\nWhile students may get the day off school or people are directed to stay inside -- essential workers don’t have that luxury.\n“It’s what I signed up for, it has to be done, keep the roadways open” said equipment operator Jon Cooper.\nSome even feel a sense of accomplishment in providing services amid dangerous weather conditions.\n“That’s obviously a huge part in Northern Michigan. So I kind of take pride in getting people to work safely. And we have a good crew with us,” said Cooper.\nOver on the other side of town more essential workers brave the cold for a cause.\nThe Salvation Army is synonymous with the Christmas season so the work doesn’t stop in freezing temps.\n“Well, first and foremost, we look out for people that are in need that might be out in the weather. So as we’re transporting people back and forth, we kind of look for people that are still out and about in the cold weather,” said commanding officer of the Salvation Army Greg Bock. “But driving in hazardous conditions is also, well, a hazard.”\nThere are a few things they look for to adjust the dangerous commute.\n“So slick spots, you know, we look out for unpaved, our unsalted roads, and just kind of slower traffic, because in the hustle and bustle of Christmas time, we want to get to where we need to go,” said Bock.",

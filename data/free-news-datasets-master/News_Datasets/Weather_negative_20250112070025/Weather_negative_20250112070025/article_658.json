    "text": "Last weekend, a power outage occurred in the Viennese Prater, leaving numerous visitors stuck in the rides. Now it is known what triggered the incident.\nAs reported by ORF, the power outage occurred on December 7th at around 3:40 pm and lasted about an hour. The area around the Ferris wheel square was particularly affected.\nPower Outage in the Viennese Prater: Visitors Stuck in Rides Some visitors had to endure in various rides at more than twenty meters height. Wiener Netze confirmed that a transformer on Trabrennstra√üe had caught fire and the professional fire brigade had to be called out to extinguish it.\nMore than two-thirds of the Prater was in the dark during the power outage. The exact cause of the fire could not be determined due to the damage to the transformer. According to Wiener Netze, the transformer is currently out of operation and a construction technician must check whether there is also damage to the structure.\n(Red)\nThis article has been automatically translated, read the original article here .",

    "text": "US Weather this Weekend: Arctic air moves out and the West Coast is slammed with heavy rain and high-elevation snow\nThe lake-effect snow machine takes a break this weekend, but snow will fly in the mountains in the western U.S. A warm-up this weekend for most of the country as 60s nudge northward into the central plains.\nPeople who live in the lake-effect snow belt of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley will give their shovels a rest this weekend. The Arctic air that has fueled heavy snowfall, measured in feet in spots, is retreating northward.\nSingle-digit lows Saturday morning across northern [Minnesota](https://www.theweather.com/minnesota.htm), [Wisconsin](https://www.theweather.com/wisconsin.htm), the Upper Peninsula of [Michigan](https://www.theweather.com/michigan.htm), and [Maine](https://www.theweather.com/maine.htm) will be the last vestiges of the bitter cold air.\nA significant warm-up on the way for most of the country\nTemperatures on Saturday afternoon will be between at least five to 15 degrees above average, along and east of the Rockies to the Ohio Valley region. It will be even warmer on Sunday, with highs in the central U.S. running around 10 to almost 25 degrees above average.\nThe rest of the country from New England southward along the Appalachians into northern [Georgia](https://www.theweather.com/georgia-cc60.htm) and along the West Coast will be near our just below average on Sunday.\nThe storm train continues in the Pacific Northwest as more mountain snow falls\nA late-week Pacific cyclone will continue on its eastward track Saturday, spreading moderate to heavy rain inland from Washington southward into central California. As the moisture-laden air rises over the Sierra Nevada, Cascade, and Olympic Mountain ranges, it will squeeze out areas of heavy snow.\nThe Weather Prediction Center has outlined a portion of northern California for a marginal risk, level one out of four, for heavy rainfall that could cause flash flooding on Saturday.\nThis system moves into the northern and central Rockies and squeezes out more snow for these regions on Sunday. Models are suggesting up to at least a foot of snow for portions of Idaho and Wyoming, with northern Utah seeing several inches, too.\nA storm in the central U.S. will produce mostly rain as it moves eastward\nThe residual moisture and energy from a Pacific system that moved onshore late this week will sweep eastward out of the Rockies and into the central plains and fuel a low-pressure system. The storm will deepen over eastern Kansas on Saturday and then push northeastward into the upper Midwest by Sunday.\nA return flow of moisture from the Gulf Coast ahead of the system's advancing cold front will fuel thunderstorms that could produce heavy rain in portions of the central Plains on Saturday.\nThe Ohio Valley and Tennessee Valley regions could get a decent soaking on Sunday. Even on the usually colder backside of this system, little to no snow will fall because of the weekend's moderating temperatures.",

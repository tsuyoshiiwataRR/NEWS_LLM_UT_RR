    "text": "As we head into another weekend, residents of Greater Victoria should brace for another windy day as Environment Canada has issued a wind warning for the region.\nThe weather agency is warning of strong winds capable of causing damage are expected to sweep through the area tonight and continue into Saturday morning.\nThe winds are set to begin this afternoon, with southeast winds reaching 70 km/h and gusts of up to 90 km/h.\nAs a deep low-pressure system approaches Vancouver Island, the winds will shift to southwest by noon on Saturday, with gusts intensifying to 100 km/h.\nThe strong winds will ease later in the afternoon.\nThe wind event may cause damage to buildings, particularly to roof shingles and windows. Loose objects could be tossed around, and tree branches may break.\nThere is also the potential for power outages due to downed lines.\n“Motorists, especially in high profile vehicles, may expect hazardous driving conditions on highways subject to strong cross winds,” warned Environment Canada.\nResidents are advised to secure loose items around their properties and take care when outside. Drivers should remain alert for sudden gusts and take extra caution while on the road.\nAdditionally, Environment Canada has issued a coastal flooding warning for the Greater Victoria coastline, including areas from Cordova Bay to East Sooke.\nThis warning is in effect due to moderate storm surge and higher-than-normal water levels.\nAccording to Environment Canada, a deep low-pressure system is expected to make landfall over northern Vancouver Island on Saturday, which will bring very strong southeast winds to Haro Strait.\nThe timing of the peak winds with high tide will create the potential for a storm surge, possibly rising up to 50 cm above the highest astronomical tide.\nThe storm surge, combined with significant wind and waves, could lead to minor coastal flooding, particularly in low-lying and exposed shorelines.\nFlooding along the coastline is possible, and residents should be prepared for higher-than-usual water levels, waves, or stronger currents. Minor flooding of basements is also a concern, so it’s advisable to elevate or relocate important items to the main floor.",

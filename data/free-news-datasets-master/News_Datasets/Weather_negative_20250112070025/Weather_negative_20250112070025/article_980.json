    "text": "The weather forecast has prompted Johnsburg to cancel its Holiday Magic Parade, which was scheduled to take place Saturday evening and include a tree-lighting and fireworks.\nAlthough temperatures are expected to be milder Saturday than in recent days, with highs in the mid-30s, there’s also a high chance of rain to spoil parade plans.\n[In the announcement on the village’s website](https://www.johnsburg.org/bc-cac/page/canceled-due-forecast-weather-6th-annual-holiday-magic-parade-and-event-fireworks-tree), which features a photo of the Grinch, officials wrote that they are having “ongoing discussion and planning efforts for an alternate event for families to still participate with meeting Santa, holiday crafts, etc.“\nThe statement said there were not yet firm plans, but that officials are looking at Dec. 20 for a “possible modified/alternate Holiday Magic Event.”\n“We apologize in advance to all the registered participants and families looking forward to this holiday event; however, Santa and holiday elves will be sending further communications via all North Pole networks,” according to the announcement.\nAssistant Village Administrator Vinny Lamontagna wrote in an email to the Northwest Herald Friday afternoon that it was “never our intention to cancel.” He said the village was ready for the possibility of colder temperatures or snow, but the potential for icy conditions in the forecast – and the impact on the parade and spectators and the ability to put on a good fireworks show after the tree-lighting – were “not in our favor.”",

    "text": "By Danielle Langenfeld ,\n11 hours ago\n*The blog below has been archived and is no longer current*\n(WJW) – Lake effect snow made the Thursday morning commute treacherous with several crashes and some massive traffic delays reported across Northeast Ohio.\nFOX 8 Meteorologist Jenn Harcher said untreated surfaces were icy due to snow followed by a flash freeze. In addition, officials with the Ohio Department of Transportation explained in a post on X that salt isn’t as effective at extremely low temperatures, especially when there is less traffic and the sun isn’t out.\nThe bulk of today’s snowfall is expected along coastal Ashtabula County, with about 5-8″, while Lake and northern Geauga counties could get a few inches in some spots. In addition, wind chills will be in the single digits all day long.\nFORECAST: More snow for some. Sunshine for others. Cold for everyone. A LAKE EFFECT SNOW WARNING is in effect for Ashtabula County (both lakeshore and inland) until 7 a.m. Friday.\nA WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY is in effect for Geauga and Lake County until 7 a.m. Friday.\nBelow you can find live updates on traffic crashes and road conditions:\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

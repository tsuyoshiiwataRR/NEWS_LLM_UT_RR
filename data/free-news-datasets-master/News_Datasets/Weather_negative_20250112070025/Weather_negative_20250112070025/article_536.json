Trump and his pro-fossil fuel corporate cronies aim to put their collective thumb on the scale for Big Oil, bolstering their already robust subsidies — billions of dollars that perpetuate a system of environmental degradation and economic injustice.\nTrump’s Cabinet picks are fully committed to Big Oil giveaways. Trump’s pick for energy secretary, Chris Wright, is a climate change-denying oil executive who once said, “There is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition, either.”\nPeople are also reading… Colorado deputy resigns after discovery of her adult videos; says financial pressure pushed her into pornography No. 5 Georgia goes overtime again, tops No. 2 Texas for SEC title Hegseth and Collins’ push for cutting veterans’ health benefits alarms service members and veterans groups There’s a rude awakening in store for the DOGE bros Stargazing retreat in Sartell allows visitors to sleep under the night sky Fortnite players 'tricked' into purchases are starting to get refunds.

Yonk The debate over fossil fuels has produced a narrative that is long on rhetoric and short on realism.\nDoug Burgum, Trump’s pick for the Interior Department, which leases onshore land and offshore water for oil and gas production, is a close ally of oil billionaire Harold Hamm, whose family leases from 200 acres of Burgum’s land in North Dakota for oil drilling. Burgum has spent years promoting a “carbon capture” scheme , allowing his state’s fossil fuel industry to keep drilling.\nEach year, taxpayers hand over $17 billion to fossil fuel companies. These subsidies take many forms, from tax breaks for drilling operations to federal support for export infrastructure. Far from promoting energy security or affordability, these giveaways incentivize oil and gas companies to prioritize exports to overseas markets, including China, over domestic needs.\nThat’s a bad strategy for consumers and businesses .\nAnd Big Oil isn’t satisfied. Oil and gas corporations hope to extract even more tax subsidies in the coming tax fight in Congress.\nDuring Trump’s first term in office, he aggressively rolled back environmental and energy regulations, repealing or weakening more than 100 environmental rules, including the Clean Power Plan, which aimed to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. Trump loosened restrictions on methane emissions from oil and gas operations, undermining the market for renewables.\nThe Biden administration has worked hard to undo the damage by promoting lower-cost renewable energy. Now those achievements are at risk.\nFar from promoting energy security or affordability, fossil-fuel giveaways incentivize oil and gas companies to prioritize overseas markets. As a result, American families face higher energy bills, with natural gas prices rising 52% between 2016 and 2023, while fossil fuel executives rake in record profits, according to a report by Public Citizen and Symons Public Affairs.\nThe environmental cost is equally staggering. Subsidizing fossil fuels accelerates global warming and undermines our ability to meet climate goals. Increased drilling and exports mean more pipelines, methane leaks and emissions — locking in decades of climate harm at a time when the world cannot afford further delay in transitioning to clean energy.\nTaxpayers are subsidizing fossil fuels when the cheapest forms of energy are renewable . The cost of solar energy systems has plummeted by 88% between 2010 and 2021, making solar one of the most affordable energy sources in almost every geographic market in the United States. In the same period, onshore wind energy costs dropped by 68%, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency .\nThe choice is clear: We can continue subsidizing a system that enriches fossil fuel executives at the expense of the planet and the public, or we can invest in a clean energy future that benefits everyone.\nPolicymakers need to redirect our taxpayer money to accelerate the deployment of renewables, invest in energy storage and grid modernization, and support workers and communities transitioning away from fossil fuels.\nFor the sake of our economy, environment and future generations, it’s time to leave fossil fuel subsidies in the past.\nWeissman is the president of Public Citizen: He wrote this for InsideSources.com .\n0 comments Catch the latest in Opinion Get opinion pieces, letters and editorials sent directly to your inbox weekly!\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy .

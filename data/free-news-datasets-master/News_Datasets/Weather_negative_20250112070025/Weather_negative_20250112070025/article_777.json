    "text": "Winter weather has taken a turn across the US this week. An atmospheric river and bomb cyclone threatened travel across Eastern America, while power outages also took place across the U.S. due to an arctic storm.\nParts of Western New York faced the ugly side of winter yesterday, with a major snowfall. Travel bans are still in place for certain counties, while others remain under an advisory.\nLet's take a closer look at the affected counties, and what the weekend forecast is looking like for north-central and eastern US.\n[Related ](/atmospheric-river-bomb-cyclone-travel-dispruptions-eastern-us/)\n[ Atmospheric River And Potential Bomb Cyclone Expected To Cause Major Travel Disruptions Across Eastern US ](/atmospheric-river-bomb-cyclone-travel-dispruptions-eastern-us/)\nA bomb cyclone along with an arctic blast are likely to cause travel delays across the US this week.\nWinter Weather Has Caused Several Travel Bans And Advisories Across New York\nPeople suck in a snow storm on HWY 87\nCertain parts of Western New York have been hit by a December winter storm.

For the likes of Erie, Genesee, Wyoming, Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties, a Lake Effect Snow Warning will continue until 1 pm on Friday.\nWGRZ listed the other advisories and bans that are still on at the moment.\nTravel Advisories have been issued for:\n- South Buffalo (William Street)\n- West Seneca\n- Marilla\n- Concord\n- Collins\n- Sardinia\n- Town of Pomfret\n- Fredonia\n- Ripley\n- Westfield\n- Sheridan\n- Silver Creek\n- Portland\n- Southern Genesee County\nAs for the current bans, Lackawanna has a travel ban in place until 3 pm. Town of Brant is also under a travel ban, while Boston State Road remains closed due to emergency utility repair work (closed from Omphalius Road to Patchin Road).\nSeveral Counties Saw Travel Bans Lifted, But Advisories Are Still In Place\nWGRZ listed the counties that are no longer under a travel ban.\nThe areas include, Town & Village of Hamburg, Town of Evans, Blasdell, Town & Village of East Aurora, Town & Village of Orchard Park, Eden, Holland, Wales, North Collins, Town of Elma, Village of Farnham, Colden, and Boston.\n[Related ](/colorado-steamboat-springs-resort-largest-avalanche/)\n[ Colorado Ski Resort Issues Warning After Largest Avalanche In Almost Two Decades ](/colorado-steamboat-springs-resort-largest-avalanche/)\nSteamboat Springs resort saw its biggest avalanche in 20 years.\nLake Snow Effect Is Set To Taper Off On Friday, But Colder Conditions Will Persist\nAccording to the latest from the National Weather Service, lake effect snow is set to taper off on Friday for the Great Lakes. However, Lake Ontario will see an additional 6-12 inches throughout Friday.\nLooking into the upcoming days, temperatures are expected to remain cool for the north-central and eastern U.S.\nThe NWS writes, \"High temperatures will remain cold and below average for much of the north-central and eastern U.S. following a frontal passage. Forecast highs range from the teens and 20s for the northern Plains, Great Lakes, and interior Northeast; the 30s and 40s for the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic/coastal Northeast; and the 50s across the Southeast. Conditions will moderate closer to average Saturday with highs generally running 5-15 degrees warmer.\"\nThe report continues, \"Forecast highs are generally at or above average across the West, with 40s and 50s in the Pacific Northwest, Great Basin, and Rockies; the 50s and 60s in California; and the 70s in the Desert Southwest. Conditions in the Southern Plains/Texas will be some of the warmest and most above average compared to the rest of the country with highs into the 60s and 70s.\"\nWinter is clearly in full force, with both snow and cold conditions.",

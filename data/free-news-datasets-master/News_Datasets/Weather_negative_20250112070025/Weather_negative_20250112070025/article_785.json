The frigid air ⁣mass, fueled by a strong arctic blast, is expected to linger throughout the weekend, bringing with it the risk of ​dangerous wind chills and widespread frost.\nThe Servicio Meteorológico Nacional‍ (SMN) and the‍ Comisión Nacional del Agua ⁢(Conagua) ⁤issued warnings for extremely cold ‍conditions,particularly in the northern and central regions of the country.

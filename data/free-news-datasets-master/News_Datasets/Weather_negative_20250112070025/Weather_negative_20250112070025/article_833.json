    "text": "KINGVALE â€“ Traffic on the westbound lanes of Interstate 80 was moving again after being held for two hours in Truckee Thursday night due to multiple spinouts, Caltrans says, as a fresh batch of snow has been falling for most of the day.\nEarlier in the day, California Highway Patrol closed westbound I-80 west of Blue Canyon due to a jackknifed big rig.\nAlong eastbound I-80, per Caltrans, chain controls are in effect from Baxter to Truckee. Westbound traffic will need to have chains on from the Donner Lake Interchange to Baxter.\nOver on Highway 50, a crash in the Echo Summit area resulted in a brief full closure of all lanes at around 3:30 p.m. The west lanes were closed at Meyers while the east lanes were closed at Echo Summit.\nAs of Thursday evening, Highway 50 had chain controls up from Kyburz to Meyers.\nFrequent travelers through the area urge people to be ready for snow.\n\"You know, always got to be prepared,\" said Christopher Escoto, a box truck driver who was chaining up along I-80. \"Can never be too prepared when you're dealing with the snow.\"\nThe Sacramento Valley will also see some patches of heavy rain on Thursday due to the same system.\nMore from CBS News DUI suspect arrested after North Highlands crash into home 1 killed in crash near Auburn involving Pontiac Firebird, propane truck Resident hurt, cat dies in Roseville duplex fire on Christmas Eve Northern California to see more rain showers, snowfall Christmas week In: Truckee News Lake Tahoe Cecilio Padilla Cecilio Padilla is a digital producer for CBS Sacramento and a Sacramento-area native who has been covering Northern California for more than a decade.\nTwitter Instagram",

    "text": "Kearney’s bizarre brush with winter weather Tuesday night caught people’s attention, so highway crews are on standby in case Old Man Winter makes a return appearance.\n“We have a salt and sand mixture ready in five trucks. We heard that on Friday they’re talking about icing. If that’s so it can cause us a lot of problems,” said John Maul, highway superintendent for Buffalo County.\nMaul and his crew are charged with keeping the county’s 1,500 miles of gravel, concrete and asphalt roads safe for travel.\nHe said the county has its 27 maintainers and five plows ready for action, especially after the weird snowfall Tuesday night.\nThe storm appeared to be confined to Kearney city limits, and prompted Kearney High Athletic Director Ryan Hogue to advise the crowd at the KHS-Lincoln Southeast basketball game to avoid the nearby 30th Avenue overpass as they left the gym.\nPeople are also reading…\nThe overpass in southwest Kearney coated in snow that made it slippery and dangerous. As a result, traffic exiting the basketball game was routed east on 11th Street rather than attempting the riskier route north on 30th Avenue.\nForecasters are not anticipating snowfall in Kearney this weekend, but the weather experts are warning that weekend travel could be complicated for anyone heading too far east\nIf Old Man Winter does anything fluky — as he did Tuesday night — Maul said the county’s road crews are ready.\nHe said if it snows and accumulations hit 3 inches, the plows may be dispatched. The strategy calls for paved roads to be plowed and treated with de-icer. Plowing gravel roads is a different matter, Maul said, because maintainers might remove excessive gravel unintentionally.\nOut of Buffalo County’s 1,500 miles of roads, 112 miles are concrete or asphalt.\nThose roads include: Cottonmill Road, Ravenna Road, the Pleasanton-Ravenna cutoff, Shelton Road, Gibbon Road, 11th Street, Coal Chute Road, Antelope Road, 39th Street, 56th Street west to the landfill and 30th Avenue.\nMaul said he and his crew will be standing by, monitoring the forecast to get an idea whether it’s time to dispatch the plows and maintainers.\n“We always pay real close attention. The trucks are all set and ready to go,” Maul said.",

The windstorm is expected to have gusts between 70 and 100 km/h in Metro Vancouver and Vancouver Island, as well as the Sunshine Coast. The wind is expected to ease by the afternoon.\nEast Vancouver Island, from Courtenay to Campbell River, also has a rainfall warning in effect. Between 50 and 70 millimetres are expected.\nEnvironment Canada says that on the west coast of the Island, there is the potential threat of coast flooding from high tides.\nThe weather warning adds there could be damage to buildings, and loose objects could be tossed by the wind, leading to injuries or other damage.\nAs wind aligns w/ high tides,â€” ECCC Weather British Columbia (@ECCCWeatherBC)\n[#coastalflooding]is forecast near midday Saturday for W Vancouver Island where [#stormsurge]& wave run up may rise 1 m above highest tide.

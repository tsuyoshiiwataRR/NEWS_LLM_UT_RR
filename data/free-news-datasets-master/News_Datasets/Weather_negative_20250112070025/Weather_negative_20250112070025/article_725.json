    "text": "As a red alert was issued by the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) in Chennai on Thursday, heavy rain lashed across Thoothukudi district on Friday. Flooding occurred in Tamirabarani river banks and inundation in low-lying areas disrupted traffic in several areas.\nIn the city areas like Rajiv Nagar, P and T Colony, Muthammal Colony and the continuous stretch near town junction, rainwater inundated the streets. In the northern parts of the district heavy rainfall caused flooding in Kovilpatti-Ilayarasanendal Road, Nagalapuram-K Duraisamypuram Road, Pudupatti-Vedapatti Road and the east coast road between Pattinamaruthur-Kulathur Road. Police advised motorists to take diversions.\nHeavy rain in Kayathar, Kadambur, Maniyachi and surrounding areas lead to overflowing of rivers merging with the Uppar Odai. The overflowing water from the Uppar Odai reached Korampallam, leading to significant rise of water level in the Korampallam lake. To manage this, five sluice gates in the lake were opened on Friday to release the excess water. Approximately 3,500 cusecs of water was drained from the Korampallam lake to Uppar odai which led to cutting off of transport between Athimarapatti and Kalankarai.\nKanniyakumari In Kanniyakumari district, the day started sunny but later turned overcast as clouds gathered in the evening.\nMinister of Social Welfare and Women Empowerment P. Geetha Jeevan, Collector K. Elambahavath, Nagercoil Mayor Jegan Periyasamy and Corporation Commissioner L. Madhubalan conducted on site inspections and reviewed the situation at various locations.\nPublished - December 13, 2024 09:30 pm IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

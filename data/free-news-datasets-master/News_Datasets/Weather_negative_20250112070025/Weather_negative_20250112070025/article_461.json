    "text": "Arab Weather - The latest simulation of atmospheric maps shows that a very cold and Siberian air mass will rush towards the eastern Mediterranean countries in the coming days, accompanied by high surface air pressure values scientifically called the Siberian high, which brings with it very cold and dry winds and very low temperatures at night.\nGod willing, the Siberian cold wave is expected to affect vast areas of the countries of the eastern Mediterranean basin, including the Levant, Iraq, and the north of the Arabian Peninsula, specifically Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, reaching Qatar and Bahrain, and will be accompanied by significant changes in the weather and temperatures. The following are the effects of the cold wave in detail:\nThe Levant: The cold wave will start to affect from Saturday and will increase on Sunday, when temperatures will noticeably drop and become several degrees Celsius lower than their average for this time of year. The weather will be very cold and inspired by winter, in contrast to the weather that prevailed last week, while it will turn very cold at night, with temperatures dropping below zero degrees Celsius in large areas, especially the Levant desert.\nIraq: Starting Saturday, Iraq will be affected by a severe Siberian cold wave resulting from the expansion of the so-called Siberian high, where temperatures will drop sharply, especially during the night hours, becoming below zero degrees Celsius in vast areas of Iraq at night and in the early morning, and the atmosphere will be inspired by the depths of winter.\nSaudi Arabia: The Kingdom is affected by a very cold and Siberian wave accompanied by a surface high pressure system called the Siberian High Pressure System, starting from the north of the Kingdom on Saturday, where temperatures will drop sharply and very cold weather will prevail in those areas. The effects of the cold wave will extend to the capital, Riyadh, and the center of the Kingdom on Saturday/Sunday night and Sunday.\nKuwait: The beginnings of the cold wave will begin on Saturday in the form of a drop in temperatures and the activity of northwesterly winds, which will be laden with quantities of dust. The effect of the cold winds towards the country will deepen on Sunday and Monday, when temperatures will drop noticeably and tangibly to approach zero degrees Celsius at night in the west of the country, and the weather will turn very cold.\nQatar and Bahrain: The effects of the cold wave are expected to extend less strongly towards Qatar and Bahrain, and thus temperatures will drop significantly. The cold and dry northwesterly winds will become active on Monday, and the weather will become cold during the night hours.\nAccording to the computer simulation that shows the temperature path, it indicates the possibility of recording temperatures close to zero degrees Celsius in 4 capitals, namely the capital Baghdad, Damascus, Amman and northern Riyadh, while temperatures in the plains and desert areas in the Levant, Iraq, northern Saudi Arabia and the high mountain peaks drop to below zero degrees Celsius by 2 to 4 degrees Celsius.\nIn light of the severe cold wave that will affect the region, we recommend heating plants and livestock to avoid damage caused by the severe cold. It is preferable to cover sensitive plants using protective covers or heavy fabrics, while ensuring that a source of heating is provided for livestock in closed places or barns.\nAnd God knows best.\nArabia Weather App\nDownload the app to receive weather notifications and more..",

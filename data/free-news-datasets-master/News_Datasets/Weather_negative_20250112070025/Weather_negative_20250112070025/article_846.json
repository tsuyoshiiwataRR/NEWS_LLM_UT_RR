    "text": "The sorry sight of Pallekele International Cricket Stadium where rain has held the upper hand\nAllows only 5.5 overs of play on day 3 By Sa’adi Thawfeeq\nHeavy rain in Pallekele continued to tamper with the spirit of the inaugural Lanka T10 Super League when it allowed only 5.5 overs to be bowled the entire third day of the tournament at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium yesterday.\nThe first game for the day between Galle Marvels and Nuwara Eliya Kings was abandoned as a no-result after just 5.5 overs. In that brief period of play Galle Marvels invited to bat first scored 53-4.\nNiroshan Dickwella returning to competitive cricket after the doping ban on him was lifted made 13 before being dismissed.\nGalle slid further into the mire when young right-arm leg-spinner Dushan Hemantha struck twice in his first over to take the big wickets of Alex Hales for 9 and Shakib Al Hasan for 6. Bhanuka Rajapaksa hit Chamika Karunaratne for a six and a four off the first two balls of the sixth over before a bad misunderstanding with Sandun Weerakkody saw the latter run out for 5. That was as far as the rain allowed the game to proceed.\nThe second match for the day between table leaders Jaffna Titans and Kandy Bolts and the third and final game between Colombo Jaguars and Hambantota Bangla Tigers were both abandoned without a ball bowled due to rain.\nResults:\nNo result (rain) Galle Marvels 53-4 (5.5) (Niroshan Dickwella 13, Bhanuka Rajapaksa 12*, Dushan Hemantha 2/7) v Nuwara Eliya Kings\nJaffna Titans v Kandy Bolts abandoned without a ball bowled. Colombo Jaguars v Hambantota Bangla Tigers abandoned without a ball bowled.",

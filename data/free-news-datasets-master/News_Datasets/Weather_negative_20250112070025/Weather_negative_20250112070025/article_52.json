    "text": "A new sideline video shows just how brutal the windy will be for the San Francisco 49ers clash with the Los Angeles Rams on ‘Thursday Night Football’ this evening.\nThe 49ers and Rams both face must-win situations for tonight’s pivotal ‘Thursday Night Football’ clash. San Francisco enters Sunday with a 6-7 record, two games behind the Seattle Seahawks for tops in the NFC West. Los Angeles is one game behind Seattle with a record of 7-6.\nRain and wind gusts are in the forecast for tonight’s showdown. To get an idea of just how bad the wind is in the area right now, let this video from NFL Network’s Omar Ruiz paint a picture for you:\nKickers checking the flags on the goal posts for conditions tonight? Just check my coat lol should be a great night for football at Levi’s Stadium between the\n— Omar Ruiz (@OmarDRuiz)[#49ers]&[#Rams][pic.twitter.com/Mlt3O6EgKZ][December 12, 2024]\nAlso Read: “He Is Pathetic”: Josh Allen Getting Called Out After Cameras Caught His Embarrassing Actions During Loss To Rams\nIf these windy conditions hold up throughout the ‘Thursday Night Football’ clash, then let’s just say that Kyle Shanahan and Sean McVay should be ready to bring out their best fourth-down play calls. Because it’d be quite cruel to call upon your kickers to try booting the ball through those conditions.\nTonight’s clash marks the final meeting in the season series between the 49ers and Rams, who also met at SoFi Stadium back in Week 3. Joshua Karty kicked the game-winning field goal to help the Rams secure a 27-24 upset victory.\nClick on ‘Follow Us’ and get notified of the most viral NFL stories via Google!

A loss would put them three games behind Los Angeles, who would secure the head-to-head tiebreaker with a season-series sweep.\nBut if the 49ers win and the Seahawks fall to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday, San Francisco would now be just one game out with three weeks to go.\nFor the Rams, a victory and a Seattle loss would put them in a two-way tie for first in the NFC West, with the two clubs set to clash again at SoFi Stadium in Week 18.\nAlso Read: RUMOR: 49ers Could Trade HC Kyle Shanahan To Rival Team In Blockbuster Move",

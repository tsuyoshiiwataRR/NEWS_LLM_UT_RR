    "text": "By April Baker ,\n3 hours ago Canton schools and Canton Police have launched a joint investigation after a close call on Wednesday between a school bus and an MBTA commuter rail train.\nAccording to a letter sent to parents by the Canton Public Schools superintendent and the Canton police chief, the school bus driver was taking students home from Galvin Middle School when the driver stopped too close to the MBTA tracks on Pine Street.\nSubsequently, the crossing arm came down and rested on the bus, while the train narrowly passed through.\nNo injuries were reported, but students on board saw what happened.\nOne parent whose child was riding in the school bus told Boston 25 News off camera that the students jumped to the back as it occurred.\n“I really didn’t know what to think. It’s weird. I mean, to think that a bus and a train would have an interaction is a little strange,” explained Gina Martin, a parent of a child who occasionally takes the bus home on that route.\nCanton Public Schools says it has been in communication with First Student, which is the company that operates their school buses. The person behind the wheel of that bus was a substitute driver.\nFirst Student responded to our request for comment and issued the following statement: “We understand the concern this incident has caused. We are conducting an internal review of what happened. While we do, the driver has been removed from service.”\nOnce the investigation has wrapped up, Canton Schools says it will figure out if they need to take further action.\nAside from this incident, people who drive over the tracks say they’ve noticed previous issues with the crossing arms.\n“There has been a couple of times where the arms get stuck a little bit. I’ve noticed people go around it,” according to Rachel Barry who lives nearby.\nOthers say they’ve been crossing the tracks when a train is coming, but no crossing arm is down.\nBoston 25 News has reached out to the MBTA about possible crossing arm issues but hasn’t heard back as of Thursday night.\nDownload the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter . | Watch Boston 25 News NOW\n4",

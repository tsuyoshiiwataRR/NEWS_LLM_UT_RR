We have more newsletters\nShow Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice Due to a higher-than-normal tide, the Strood (B1025) is expected to be impassible this morning. High tide today (December 13) is expected at about 9.49am and is estimated to be just under five meters deep.\nThe road will be blocked between East Mersea Road to Mersea Road. While the road floods regularly, today is expected to be particularly deep, and drivers occasionally become stranded every time the road does have a deep flood.\nThe Strood is expected to be blocked going in both directions and is likely to be completely impassable. This is set to cause some delays on the road.\nREAD MORE: Police smash down door in raid as four arrested for drug offences across Essex\nREAD MORE: The busy town named the &apos;saddest&apos; place to live in Essex by Rightmove\nLocal organisation StroodCam , who monitor the road, says: \"Tide heights are affected by the weather and can suprise you. If you absolutely must get across, and the predicted tide height is 4.9m or above, allow about 1 hour either side of the high tide time.\"\nGet more traffic and travel news from EssexLive straight to your inbox for FREE\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

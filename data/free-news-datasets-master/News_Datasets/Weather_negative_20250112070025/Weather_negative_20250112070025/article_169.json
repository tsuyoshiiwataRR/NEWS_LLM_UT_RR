Most of these areas have changed from humid to arid regions, with serious consequences for agriculture, ecosystems and local populations.\nThe research warns that if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced, another 3% of wetlands could become arid by the end of this century . Unlike droughts, defined by temporary periods of low rainfall, aridity represents a permanent transformation. However, when an area's climate becomes drier, the ability to return to previous conditions is lost .\nAreas that were not drylands in 1961–1990, but became drylands in 1991–2020, are present in all macroregions except Antarctica. Drylands are areas where the amount of rainfall is less than 65% of what can potentially be evaporated, and encompass all lands with hyperarid, arid, semiarid and dry subhumid climates. Non-drylands, with rainfall greater than 65% of potential evaporation, are considered humid.\nRegions of the world most affected by increasing aridity\nForced migration is one of the most obvious consequences of aridity. When land becomes unsuitable for living, families and entire communities, facing water scarcity and agricultural collapse, are often forced to leave their homes , generating social and political challenges in different parts of the world.\nIn Brazil, for example, periodic droughts and desertification between 1960 and 1980 were blamed for the emigration of more than 3 million people.\nParts of the western United States and Brazil’s cerrado and caatinga biomes are experiencing significant drought trends , with water shortages and wildfires becoming perennial risks. The Mediterranean and southern Europe , once considered agricultural breadbaskets, face a grim future as semi-arid conditions expand. In Central Africa and parts of Asia , biologically diverse areas are suffering from ecosystem degradation and desertification , putting countless species at risk.\nSources and references of the news\n- Vicente-Serrano, S.

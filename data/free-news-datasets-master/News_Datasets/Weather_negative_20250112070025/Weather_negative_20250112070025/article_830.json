    "text": "Ranchi: As winter tightens its grip on the state capital, many homeless individuals continue to brave the freezing nights on roads despite the availability of govt night shelter homes. A lack of awareness and misconceptions about the facilities are significant barriers preventing their use.The Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) operates 10 night shelter homes across the city, including Khadgarha Bus Stand (separate facilities for men and women), Dhurwa Bus Stand, and Bakri Bazar. The Bakri Bazar shelter home, with a capacity of 10 beds, often sees double occupancy during biting winters.Rickshaw pullers are among those who avoid night shelter homes due to misleading information. The winter season accentuates the struggles of the homeless, with misconceptions and limited outreach hindering the effective utilization of resources. Many take refuge at railway stations or under flyovers instead of safer options.Gajdhari Mahto, a rickshaw puller at Albert Ekka Chowk, said, \\\"I didn't know about these night shelter homes. During cold nights, I often sleep at the Ranchi railway station bridge or underneath it.\\\"Ramesh Birua, another rickshaw puller, said, \\\"I thought charges would be taken at the night shelter homes, so I prefer sleeping in my rickshaw with blankets.\\\"RMC's commitment to improving awareness and increasing capacity aims to ensure no one has to face the chilling cold nights on Ranchi's streets.Nikesh Kumar, RMC's assistant municipal commissioner, highlighted ongoing efforts to aid the homeless. \\\"Our teams are on the field daily, rescuing the homeless and beggars. We distribute blankets and ensure that the shelter facilities are utilized. Additionally, we are planning to establish temporary shelter homes at prominent locations to accommodate more people.\\\"",

    "text": "By Matt Mathias ,\n3 hours ago\nSporadic whiteout conditions highlighted today’s latest batch of snow.\nThose conditions caused delays for travelers on roads throughout the City of Erie and on highways.\nMeals on Wheels back on the road after harsh winter weather At certain points throughout the day, visibility was poor as heavy winds and lake effect snow contributed to delays.\nWhite-out conditions caused by lake effect snow, heavy wind along with slush and packed snow on Erie roadways caused headaches for drivers throughout the day on Thursday.\nBut how has it compared to what’s being called Snowmaggedon 2024?\n“It’s a different dynamic of snow totally from last week. Last week it was two inches an hour of wet, heavy snow starting at the end of Thanksgiving and beginning of Black Friday. . . With cars everywhere, people everywhere, and it just wouldn’t stop snowing,” said Jeff Gibbens, bureau chief of the City of Erie Streets Department.\nCost to clean up 6 feet of snow costing Harborcreek Twp. more than anticipated Crews started salting late Thursday night early into the morning and switched to plowing on main runs around 3 a.m.\nThis type of snow is light and fluffy, city trucks aren’t getting stuck in this snow and it’s not as heavy on their equipment.\nPennDOT last week brought crews in from across the Commonwealth and while the region got some help again, it wasn’t nearly to the level we saw then.\nCrews from Crawford and Warren Counties were called in through a PennDOT plan called Cover 90.\nClose Thanks for signing up!\nWatch for us in your inbox.\nSubscribe Now\nDaily News “That gives then the Erie County the ability to put more crews on I-90 where we typically see the heaviest snow. Cover 90 is what we call it because it gives us the chance to shorten those plow routes, especially in the areas hit the hardest like towards the east end of I-90 near the New York border where we see the snow coming down at a pretty good rate right now,” said Jill Harry, press officer for PennDOT District 1.\nHarry said this is a common lake effect storm that they’ve prepared for since the summer and said it was almost solely isolated to the lake shore region.\nAnd when it’s isolated, it gives them the flexibility to move crews here as needed.\nFor City of Erie crews, they’re still dealing with problems with people not following odd-even parking.\nSisters of St. Joseph begin due diligence on potential sale on local properties “Even today we’re having problems after all of this time. We’ve had constant contact with police moving cars. As of yesterday, we were still towing cars that haven’t moved. You just need to obey odd-even parking, which we go by the date,” said Gibbens. “If you see them just give them the space they need to open the road so everyone can get home safely.”\nHarry said their website, 511PA has the latest updates on road closures and restrictions that might be placed on the roads.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

The storm forecast this weekend will likely flood low-lying communities like King Salmon and the Arcata Bottoms. (HCSO/Contributed) By Jackson Guilfoil | jguilfoil@times-standard.com | Eureka Times-Standard UPDATED: December 12, 2024 at 3:59 PM PST The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for Humboldt County’s coastline and within interior, and southern regions in anticipation of this weekend’s storm.\nThe storm, expected to begin Friday morning, will bring strong winds and significant rainfall which, in tandem with king tides, presents a good chance of flooding communities like King Salmon and the Arcata Bottoms. The coasts could see 3 to 5 inches of rain, but the county’s inner ridges could see up to 8 inches of rain alongside snow on state Route 299. Winds were forecast to bluster at enough speeds to down trees and take out powerlines.\n“The winds will die down fairly fast, so power outages will likely not last super long, hopefully, fingers crossed,” Jacob Boomsma, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Eureka said.\nWinds around the coast are expected to blow from 45 to 50 miles per hour along exposed headlands, but Humboldt County’s elevated ridges near Kneeland or the King Range could see wind speeds clear 60 miles per hour.\nThe Eel River at Fernbridge and Mad River are at the monitor stages, not quite reaching flooding, but rivers will certainly rise with the incoming rains.\nThe baseline high tide around Humboldt Bay is 8.5 feet, but the king tides are pushing it higher, signaling the beginning of the annual floods in King Salmon and the Arcata Bottoms. By Thursday, the tide reached 9.2 feet, and Boomsma said that could reach above 9.5 feet by Friday and Saturday.\nAbove 3,000 feet, Humboldt County is expected to see snow, though nearby Trinity County will be the more impacted region, though travel along state Route 299 to Redding this weekend could see chain advisories or a landslide.\n“Be careful driving, especially around mountain passes. There could be some landslides on the roads and could close for some period of time,” Boomsma said.\nA landslide did close state Route 199 in Del Norte County on Thursday near Hiouchi. As of Thursday afternoon, the highway remained closed along a stretch between 8 and 13 miles from U.S. Highway 101 in Del Norte County.\nFind out more For more up-to-date information on weather conditions, go to weather.gov/eka/ .\nFor up-to-date information on the status of state highways, go to Caltrans’ QuickMap at https://quickmap.dot.ca.gov/ or use the app.\nFor more information on Pacific Gas and Electric Co. outages, go to https://pgealerts.alerts.pge.com/outage-tools/outage-map/ .\nJackson Guilfoil can be reached at 707-441-0506.\nOriginally Published: December 12, 2024 at 1:47 PM PST Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Most Popular Most Popular 7 Best Peptide Companies & Sources (Legit Places To Buy) 7 Best Peptide Companies & Sources (Legit Places To Buy) HCSO footage of fatal shooting in Cutten explains how events unfolded HCSO footage of fatal shooting in Cutten explains how events unfolded ‘Craftsman,’ Blue Ox Millworks mourn loss of Bidwell Mansion that team was helping restore 'Craftsman,' Blue Ox Millworks mourn loss of Bidwell Mansion that team was helping restore Weekend storm expected to flood coast, knock out power Weekend storm expected to flood coast, knock out power Buy Facebook Accounts And Verified Business Managers – Top 5 Websites Updated Buy Facebook Accounts And Verified Business Managers - Top 5 Websites Updated Prep football | Arcata football ready for state championship game Prep football | Arcata football ready for state championship game RAD-140 Review: Benefits, Results, Side Effects, Cycle, & More RAD-140 Review: Benefits, Results, Side Effects, Cycle, & More Best 10 Choices for Converting VHS to Digital in 2024 (How to Convert VHS to Digital) Best 10 Choices for Converting VHS to Digital in 2024 (How to Convert VHS to Digital) Babe’s Pizza 70+ softball team wins Hawaii tournament.

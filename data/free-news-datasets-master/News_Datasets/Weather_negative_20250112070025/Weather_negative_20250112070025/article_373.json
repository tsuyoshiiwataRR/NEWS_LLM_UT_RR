    "text": "Tough sledding: Lake snows trouble motorists, region\nThursday’s weather in the north county was definitely frightful and led to government agencies banning and restricting travel on area streets and highways.\nIn the morning, the Chautauqua County government urged residents impacted by lake effect snow — including Ripley, Westfield, Portland, Dunkirk-Fredonia, Sheridan, and Silver Creek — to avoid unnecessary travel as hazardous winter weather pounded the region.\nThe National Weather Service issued a lake-effect snow warning for the region until 1 p.m. Friday, with total snow accumulations of 2 to 3 feet expected in the most persistent bands, along with wind gusts of up to 40 mph causing blowing and drifting snow.\nThese conditions led to poor visibility, whiteouts, and snow-covered roads, making travel extremely dangerous. Residents were advised to stay off the roads whenever possible and to monitor weather updates.\nAround 11 a.m., the city of Dunkirk Police Department, in cooperation with the Mayor’s Office, DPW, and DFD, issued a travel ban until further notice.\n“Only essential workers will still be allowed to travel to ensure that critical services continue uninterrupted,” Dunkirk police reported. “Essential workers are those who perform operations and services that are critical to maintaining infrastructure and public health and safety. We thank them for their dedication and commitment during this time.”\nCity officials also announced the cancellation of the Dunkirk Holiday Parade, which had been rescheduled for today.\nIn addition to the area schools, the Dunkirk Department of Motor Vehicle office, located at 3998 Vineyard Drive, is closed Thursday. The office plans to reopen during normal business hours Friday, weather permitting.\nAlso, the Fredonia Central Schools capital project vote on a $52 million plan that includes renovations to buildings, an addition to the music department and a new athletic facility was postponed on Thursday. The vote may take place today from 2 to 9 p.m. at the school cafeteria.\nHazardous conditions in the city and north county included:\n— Strong winds and heavy, blowing snow may cause drifting, downed trees, and power lines.\n— Downed power lines. Always assume any downed line is live and energized. Maintain a safe distance of at least 35 feet.\n—- Traffic signals. Treat intersections as a four-way stop if traffic lights lose power.\nNational Weather Service spotters reported snowfall amounts from Wednesday to early Thursday as: Silver Creek, 12 inches; Dunkirk, 6; Fredonia, 4.9; Cassadaga, 3.7; Mayville, 1.4; Bemus Point, 0.5. Areas to the north in southern Erie County received more than 2 feet around Orchard Park and Hamburg.\nTotals were higher in numerous locations due to blowing and drifting snow.\nOn Wednesday evening, state Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a State of Emergency in portions of the Western New York, Finger Lakes.\n“As winter weather bears down on our state, I am declaring a State of Emergency so our communities have the resources they need to stay safe,” Hochul said. “We are deploying resources and working alongside our partners in government as we prepare for every possibility — I encourage all New Yorkers to stay alert, stay off the roads if possible, and keep in contact with family and friends as we move through the next 48 hours.”\nThe State of Emergency was in effect for Cattaraugus, Chautauqua and Erie counties through Friday.",

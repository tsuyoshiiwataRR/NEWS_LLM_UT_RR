    "text": "Severe cold wave hits Pakistan with heavy snowfall closing Karakoram Highway in Hunza Valley\nA severe cold wave continues to affect Pakistan, particularly in the northern regions, where rain and heavy snowfall have intensified the chill. The Karakoram Highway has been closed in the Hunza Valley due to adverse weather conditions.\nIn several cities, including Quetta, Skardu, Malam Jabba, Chitral, and Dir, temperatures have plummeted to -4 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, intermittent snowfall is ongoing in the upper regions of Azad Kashmir, where over two feet of snow accumulation has been reported, further exacerbating the cold.\nSnowfall is also affecting daily life in the upper areas of Gilgit-Baltistan, particularly in the Astor district. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, areas like Babusar Top, Nanga Parbat, and Batogah have also experienced significant snowfall.\nCities across Punjab, including Lahore, are grappling with extreme cold temperatures. In Balochistan, severe cold has led to water pipes freezing in places like Quetta, Qalat, Chaman, Qilla Abdullah, Pishin, and Ziarat.\nKarachi is not exempt from the cold either, with chilly winds causing temperatures to drop to 11 degrees Celsius.\nThe Pakistan Meteorological Department has forecast that most parts of the country will experience severe cold and dry conditions today. This cold wave is expected to persist until December 15, with additional rain and snowfall anticipated in Kashmir and Gilgit.\nIn a related health concern, Lahore has been identified as the city with the worst air quality in Pakistan, recording an Air Quality Index of 253 early this morning.\nRead more\n[Tourism in north suspended, cold wave sweeps country after fresh rain and snowfall]\n[Pakistan Meteorological Department warns of below-average rainfall this winter]\n[Winter intensifies across Pakistan as PMD predicts more snow in northern areas]\nFor the latest news, follow us on Twitter\n@Aaj_Urdu.\nWe are also on\nFacebook,\nInstagram\nand\nYouTube.",

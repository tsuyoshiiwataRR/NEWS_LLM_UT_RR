    "text": "Weather Forecast Snowy-icy system set to arrive in Twin Cities overnight, triggers NEXT Drive alert By Adam Del Rosso , Lisa Meadows\nUpdated on: December 13, 2024 / 12:36 PM CST / CBS Minnesota\nNEXT Weather: 12 p.m. forecast from Dec. 13, 2024 NEXT Weather: 12 p.m. forecast from Dec. 13, 2024 03:42 MINNEAPOLIS â€” Friday kicks off with more frigid conditions in Minnesota, but temperatures, clouds and wind pick up through the afternoon before our next storm.\nExpect highs in the teens on Friday with gusts near 20 mph, keeping wind chills in the single digits.\nThe next shot at snow/icy mix arrives after midnight into Saturday morning in the metro with a low tracking across Iowa.\nWCCO Accumulations look minimal for the metro, but it only takes a glaze of ice to make things slick. We also warm up even more with highs into the 30s Saturday through Monday.\nAnother disturbance may bring a rain/snow shower on Monday, but this system looks to be lacking moisture. The system will drop temps back into the 20s for midweek.\nThere may be another few opportunities for flurries, but next week looks largely quiet and not as cold.\nA mix of snow and sleet will move in Friday evening, and changes into freezing rain on Saturday. Because of these conditions, WCCO has issued a NEXT Drive Alert, starting at midnight on Friday and ending on Saturday afternoon.\nMore from CBS News Dangerous wind chills in Minnesota into Thursday morning Minnesota wakes up Thursday to coldest air so far this season Light snow overnight Wednesday in Twin Cities, followed by arctic blast A refresher for dressing in layers amid Minnesota's dangerous cold 3 Minnesota women among the 39 pardoned by Biden Adam Del Rosso Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, weather has been a passion for Adam for as long as he can remember!

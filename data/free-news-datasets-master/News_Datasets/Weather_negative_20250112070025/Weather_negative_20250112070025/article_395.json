More info\nJoin us on WhatsApp Holyhead Port in Wales will remain closed for another week following damage caused by Storm Darragh last weekend.\nThe port has been shut for a repair and clean-up job since December 7 and all ferry services between Dublin Port and Holyhead suspended. Fears are growing that Christmas deliveries may be delayed due to the disruption.\nThe port will not reopen until Thursday, December 19 at the earliest, it has now been confirmed that.\nA spokesperson for Holyhead Port told Dublin Live : \"Last Saturday morning (7th Dec) during Storm Darragh, an incident occurred at Holyhead Port which caused damage to port infrastructure.\n\"As a result, the ferry berths have remained closed to all marine traffic. No injuries were reported, and all relevant authorities were informed of the incident. Safety is of paramount importance to Holyhead Port and a thorough investigation into the extent of the damage and repairs required is ongoing. At this point, it is estimated that the berths will reopen for ferry traffic on Thursday 19th December at the earliest.\"\nHowever, An Post has moved to quell fears that presents and other goods may not arrive in time for Christmas Day, promising to be ready for the parcels from Holyhead when they arrive in Ireland. It also said hauliers had been diverting to other routes such as Rosslare Europort in a bid to avoid the logjam at Holyhead.\n\"We&apos;ll be ready for the Holyhead parcels when they arrive over the weekend – so we can get them through and out on delivery ASAP,\" said a spokesperson for An Post.\n\"We invested €6 million in expanding our parcel tech and capacity in Portlaoise and Athlone hubs this year, and we have 1,400 Christmas casuals helping to process and deliver parcels and letters too,\" they added.\nAn Post have advised customers not to wait until the last minute to post cards and parcels this Christmas.\n\"There will be nationwide parcel deliveries this week and post offices will be open all day on Saturday,\" said the spokesperson. We&apos;re seeing huge volumes of Christmas cards being posted in the last few days, particularly to family and friends abroad. The latest date for guaranteed parcel delivery across Europe is today (Thursday, December 12), and next Tuesday for cards.\"\nWednesday, December 18 is the latest posting date to ensure that parcels and cards are delivered to all parts of England, Scotland and Wales in time for Christmas. An Post added that they will be delivering up to Christmas Eve all parcels received by December 21.\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

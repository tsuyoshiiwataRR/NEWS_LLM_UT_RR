    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- A fast-moving storm will sweep into northern California and the Pacific Northwest this weekend, bringing high winds, heavy snow and flooding rain to the region.\nUpwards of 70 inches (178 centimeters) of snow could fall in California’s high mountain ranges and 3 to 4 inches of rain may drop on lower elevations from the coast to inland areas, the US Weather Prediction Center said. The Mount Shasta Ski area may get as much as 3 feet of snow.\nThe storm, known as an atmospheric river, will quickly move out of the area and should be gone by late Saturday. Atmospheric rivers can deliver as much water as flows through the mouth of the Mississippi River, helping to replenish reservoirs and aquifers. But they can also cause widespread destruction.\nTravel throughout California and along the Sierra Nevada range will be difficult, and the combination of winter weather and high winds could trigger power outages in the area. Sustained winds will likely reach tropical-storm strength across parts of Oregon and Northern California, with gusts reaching 70 miles per hour.\n“Damaging winds will blow down trees and power lines,” the National Weather Service said. “Widespread power outages are expected.”\nHigh winds will also sweep further south, including Point Reyes and across the Marin and Sonoma County Hills, where travel will be difficult, especially for large, high-profile trucks.\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

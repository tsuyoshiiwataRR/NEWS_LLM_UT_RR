    "text": "Many Amazon UK workers are forced to borrow money due to low pay, new GMB union report claims\nAmazon UK workers are having to borrow money to subsidise low pay, according to a report released by the GMB union.\nThis forms part of the GMB, [which earlier this year narrowly lost its historic bid for union recognition at Amazon’s warehouse in Coventry](https://retailtechinnovationhub.com/home/2024/6/19/gmb-hails-historic-moment-as-workers-at-amazon-coventry-fulfilment-centre-vote-on-union-recognition), calling on the US online giant to deliver a £17 minimum wage for UK staff.\nA survey of hundreds of Amazon UK workers found low pay was causing: 15% having to use food banks; 53% having to borrow money to keep up with the cost-of-living; 78% struggling to keep up with day-to-day expenses.\nIt comes as Amazon workers across Europe stage a day of action to mark the company’s Black Friday event.\nAmanda Gearing, GMB Senior Organiser, says: “These findings should be a wakeup call for decision makers. Despite all the attempts to paint Amazon as force for good, the company’s reputation is on the floor over its treatment of workers.”\nHe adds: “It’s a scandal that 15% of Amazon workers, that would be around 12,000 people, are reporting being forced to use food banks to make ends meet. Amazon are one of the world’s wealthiest corporations, it’s not right that their UK staff are being forced to endure this. That’s why we’ve launched our call for £17 an hour at Amazon this Black Friday.”\nAn Amazon spokesperson told RTIH: “Our frontline employees in the UK receive a minimum starting salary of between £28,000 and £30,000 - that’s an increase of at least 35% over the last two years. Our employees work a four day week with flexible working options and excellent career opportunities – all within a modern, safe and engaging work environment.”\n“These are just some of the reasons people want to come and work at Amazon, whether it’s their first job, a seasonal role or an opportunity for them to advance their career. Anyone can come and see for themselves and make their own mind up by booking a tour at one of our fulfilment centres which are open to the public throughout the year.”\n2024 RTIH INNOVATION AWARDS\nOnline retail was a key focus area for [the sixth edition of the RTIH Innovation Awards](https://retailtechinnovationhub.com/rtih-innovation-awards-2024).\nThe awards, sponsored by [Vista Technology Support](https://vistasupport.com/), [Scala](https://scala.com/en/solutions/retail-media-networks/?utm_source=sponsored_content), [CADS](https://cadsonline.com/videos/retail/storespace-retail-space-planning-software/?utm_campaign=awards&utm_medium=banner&utm_source=rtih), [3D Cloud](https://3dcloud.com/), [Brightpearl by Sage’s Lightning 50](https://www.brightpearl.com/lightning-50), [Business France](https://www.businessfrance.fr/en/home), and [Retail Technology Show 2025](https://www.retailtechnologyshow.com/), celebrate global tech innovation in a fast moving omnichannel world.\n[Our 2024 hall of fame entrants](https://retailtechinnovationhub.com/home/2024/11/22/2024-rtih-innovation-awards-winners-announced-including-currys-ikea-clarks-tesco-and-super-pharm) were revealed during an event which took place at RIBA’s 66 Portland Place HQ in Central London on 21st November, and consisted of a drinks reception, three course meal, and awards ceremony presided over by comedian [Lucy Porter](https://retailtechinnovationhub.com/2024-rtih-innovation-awards-host-lucy-porter).\nIn his welcome speech, Scott Thompson, Founder and Editor, RTIH, said: “The event is now into its sixth year and what a journey it has been. The awards started life as an online only affair during the Covid outbreak, before launching as a small scale in real life event and growing year on year to the point where we’re now selling out this fine, historic venue.”\nHe added: “Congratulations to all of our finalists. Many submissions did not make it through to the final stage, and getting to this point is no mean feat. Checkout-free stores, automated supply chains, immersive experiences, on-demand delivery, next generation loyalty offerings, inclusive retail, green technology. We’ve got all the cool stuff covered this evening.”\n“But just importantly we’ve got lots of great examples of companies taking innovative tech and making it usable in everyday operations - resulting in more efficiency and profitability in all areas.”\nCongratulations to our 2024 winners, and a big thank you to our sponsors, judging panel, the legend that is Lucy Porter, and all those who attended last week’s gathering.\n[Employees](/home/category/Employees)\n[Staff Writer](/?author=58e8bf56414fb5fae5618c09)\n[Amazon](/home/tag/Amazon),\n[GMB](/home/tag/GMB),\n[Employees](/home/tag/Employees),\n[Supply chain](/home/tag/Supply+chain),\n[2024 RTIH Innovation Awards](/home/tag/2024+RTIH+Innovation+Awards),\n[Online delivery](/home/tag/Online+delivery),\n[Fulfilment centres](/home/tag/Fulfilment+centres)\n[Comment](/home/2024/11/29/many-amazon-uk-workers-are-forced-to-borrow-money-due-to-low-pay-new-gmb-union-report-claims#comments-67495450fec7ac78ce6198bd)",

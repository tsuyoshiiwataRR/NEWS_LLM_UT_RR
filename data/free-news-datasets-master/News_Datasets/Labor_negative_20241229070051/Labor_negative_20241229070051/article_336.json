    "text": "For the third week in a row, some 3,000 workers at daycares in Quebec are expected go on strike for a few hours this Friday.\nThe workers are members of the Centrale des syndicats du Québec (CSQ) affiliated Fédération des intervenantes en petite enfance (FIPEQ).\nThe CPEs affected are expected to open their doors at 10 a.m., with their strike mandate allowing them to open later and later each Friday.\nNext week, doors will open at 12 p.m. if no progress is made.\nThe main points in the dispute are wages, workload and organization.\nA qualified educator in an early childhood centre earns $21.60 an hour at the first echelon and $28.60 at the tenth echelon.\nThe unions representing workers in the CPEs argue they only received a wage increase offer of 12.7 per cent over five years from Quebec City, whereas other government employees were given 17.4 per cent over five years.\nThe Treasury Board points out that \"the 17.4 per cent increase granted to the Common Front was based on quid pro quos in terms of flexibility in work organization, which have a real impact on services.\"\nThere is currently a shortage of childcare workers, with Quebec seeking to attract people to the field by opening thousands of spaces.\nThe FIPEQ, affiliated to the CSQ, also represents 9,000 educational childcare providers who work in family daycares.\nThey are opening later and later every day of the week.\nNegotiations, which began in the spring, are continuing.\n-- This report by The Canadian Press was first published in French on Nov. 29, 2024.",

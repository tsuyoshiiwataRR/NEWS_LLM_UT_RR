    "text": "LAS VEGAS (KSNV) — As people around the country and Vegas Valley celebrate Thanksgiving with their loved ones, employees of one local casino spend their day outside protesting. Thursday marked fifteen days since employees of Virgin Hotels Las Vegas went on strike, demanding better wages. \"With as small the casino as this is compared to the other casinos around town, I didn't think it would last that long,\" said Debora Wilby, an usher at Virgin who is on strike. As some came to enjoy Thanksgiving at the property, strikers, encouraged them to take their business elsewhere. \"I would much rather be home and relaxing, getting ready to eat with family, as opposed to being out here,\" said Timothy McKeever, a room service striker who says the strike is worth it. \"It's a shame that we're having to do this.\" \"The pay increase is necessary. As a matter of fact, today's Thanksgiving, I'm missing it with my family, and when I'm done here, I'll be going to my second job that's required,\" said Timothy Mara, a line cook for the casino. The strikers say they will be outside the property with their signs and blow horns as long as it takes. \"They're not agreeing to the terms of our contract. Every other property in Vegas has agreed to the same terms, which means that if the contract expires next time, except for renewal, will already be years behind every other property,\" said McKeever. Two weeks ago Virgin Hotels said in a statement that they provided financial information to the union showing that the union's proposal was not \"economically sustainable for the property.\" \"That's corporate greed. That is- that is big companies wanting to hold on tight all the money they have,\" said Wilby. Virgin Hotels says that some of the temporary workers they hired are former Culinary members who had been laid off because of properties closing or because of union contracts that led to some job cuts. \"That's really discouraging. You know, the company sent out a communication saying that they would do just that, that, you know if we came out and struck, that there's a potential that we could be replaced,\" said McKeever. \"But I'm hoping that they're going to have a change of heart.\" If these strikes continue to go on for long, some say it'll be a major strain on their families. \"If this goes on for a while, I might take up another job to supplement the hours,\" said Mara. \"But we are out here, we are getting paid. I also can pick up more hours at my second job.\" Strikers say it's challenging living off the pay you get while on strike. \"We get paid a maximum of $500 a week, which isn't comparable to what I was making,\" said McKeever. \"But it's - hopefully it doesn't go on too long.\" Virgin Hotels Las Vegas said in a statement in part: \"Despite Virgin Hotels Las Vegas agreeing to many of the Culinary Union’s demands and showing flexibility on key issues, the Culinary Union has not seriously countered any of our economic proposals or brought our latest offer to their members for a formal vote. We remain focused on reaching a reasonable agreement that secures a brighter future for all of our 1,710 team members and their families.\"",

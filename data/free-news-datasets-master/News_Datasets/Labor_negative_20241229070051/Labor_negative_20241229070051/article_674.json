    "text": "Key Takeaways - Cloud Imperium Games reportedly lays off staff amid Star Citizen's ongoing development. - The layoffs reportedly impact about 1% of the company's workforce, following mandated seven-day work weeks. - No full release date for the game has been announced. Cloud Imperium Games, the studio behind the in-development space trading and combat game, Star Citizen, has reportedly laid off an unspecified number of staff members. The layoffs come amid Star Citizen 's annual ship showcase, the Intergalactic Aerospace Expo, the run-up to which saw Cloud Imperium staff working consecutive seven-day weeks. The space simulator has raised an eye-watering $700 million in funds over the past 12 years, making Star Citizen far and away the most expensive game ever put into production. Despite the extended timeline and enormous expense, the game remains in early-access alpha, with only limited content available, and the inability to maintain persistent Star Citizen character stats . [Related 3:58 ](/most-expensive-games-ever-made-total-cost/) [ The 18 Most Expensive Games Ever Made (& How Much it Cost to Make Them) ](/most-expensive-games-ever-made-total-cost/) Just as the power of home consoles and high-end gaming rigs has increased in recent years, so too has the cost of developing cutting edge games. As first reported by Insider Gaming , sources have confirmed that a number of employees have been released over the past several days, though the extent of the layoffs remains unclear. One of Insider Gaming's sources put the number of those affected at 12, representing about 1% of the company's workforce. While those purported numbers are still low, the studio has a history of letting employees go over periods of time, with the Star Citizen developer's last round of layoffs occurring over several weeks. More Layoffs but No Timeline for Full Release The move reportedly comes with no compensation for released employees and is occurring right on the heels of an intensive period of mandated seven-day work weeks that led up to the IAE event. The IAE is one of many similar in-game events that showcase new ships available in Star Citizen , and allow prospective players to play the game free for a short period of time. With no formal announcement from the company at present, the full scope of the layoffs, and the reason behind them, remains unknown. Having let around a hundred employees go in early 2024 amid accusations of fostering a toxic work environment, and despite failing to announce a release date for the full version of the game, Cloud Imperium Games continues to pile up cash . The company's financial reports show development costs hitting over $100 million annually for the past several years. How long that kind of spending can continue without a fully published title remains to be seen. Even without a clear roadmap for a full release, development appears to be moving forward, with a new star system and other content slated for Star Citizen's latest update. However, the massive game originally pitched to crowdfunding investors still seems light years away, with some critics wondering if the finished game will ever go live.",

    "text": "Without agreement, the meeting between the company ended today Keep it up which manages the fleet of Zaragoza urban buses and the representatives of the workers in the Aragonese Mediation and Arbitration Service (SAMA) before the strikes called by the union SATTRA due to the lack of agreement in the negotiation of the new collective agreement .\nToday there have been delays in bus frequency and some queues at stops as a result of the strikes that began today, although no serious illnesses have occurred. It is a situation that will occur again next week, in accordance with the strike schedule indicated by the SATTRA union.\nThe strikes will be December 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 being realized one hour stoppage in the morning and another in the afternoon. Specifically, it will be between 7:45 a.m. and 8:45 a.m. on December 2, 3, 4, and 5, dates on which it will stop in the afternoon from 7:45 p.m. to 8:45 p.m. They are also planned for December 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 between 7:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. in the morning and from 7:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. in the afternoon. Additionally, this Friday, November 29, there will be a informative assembly .\nThe Avanza company has considered that this strike call is “unjustified” and “harmful”, in addition to highlighting that it is called alone by the SATTRA union, “without respecting the unity of the works committee as a representative body of the workers.”\nThrough a statement, Avanza has stated that they do not understand that “in the middle of a open negotiation on the new collective agreement and, with the push from SAMA to expedite the process, one of the five union sections that make up the committee distanced itself and unilaterally called for strikes starting in December.”\nAvanza indicates that there is a scenario of “progress in the negotiation” which is why they point out that SATTRA puts its union objectives before the interest of all the company’s workers who are affected by the agreement, in addition to harming the service and the citizen. since, in addition, they remember that the collective agreement is negotiated only with the committee as a whole and with union sections independently.\nHowever, SATTRA, which rejects the company’s offer, has indicated that The strikes are called due to no progress in the negotiation after a year and after 26 meetings with AVANZA, apart from pointing out that the strikes have the “resounding affirmative response obtained from our membership.”\nWhatsApp Twitter Linkedin Beloud\n#urban #buses #Zaragoza #continue #strike #lack #agreement #collective #agreement",

    "text": "The Winter Woes of Delhi's Construction Workers\nThis piece highlights the plight of Delhi's construction workers, who face seasonal job losses due to winter pollution control measures. Many are forced into alternative, low-paying jobs to make ends meet, and struggle with debt and uncertain futures as pollution levels necessitate ongoing work bans.\n- Country:\n- India\nAs Delhi enforces pollution control measures each winter, thousands of construction workers find themselves without employment.\nRaju Singh, a mason, voices the devastating impact these job losses have on families, who barely manage to scrape by with meager earnings from alternative employment like vegetable selling or sewing.\nWhile pollution strategies are seen as essential for public health, for workers like Ajay Kumar and Rina Devi, the bans perpetuate cycles of debt. The ongoing challenge of balancing workers' needs with environmental protections requires urgent attention from both policymakers and support agencies.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nAdvertisement\nALSO READ\n[Indian Americans Rally for Sanctions on Bangladesh](/article/law-order/3159566-indian-americans-rally-for-sanctions-on-bangladesh)[Indian Americans Push Trump to Sanction Bangladesh](/article/law-order/3159567-indian-americans-push-trump-to-sanction-bangladesh)[Delhi Enforces Strict Ban on Older Vehicles to Tackle Severe Air Pollution](/article/headlines/3159613-delhi-enforces-strict-ban-on-older-vehicles-to-tackle-severe-air-pollution)[Ronaldo's Heroics Propel Portugal; UEFA Clash Abandoned Amidst Tensions](/article/sports-games/3159598-ronaldos-heroics-propel-portugal-uefa-clash-abandoned-amidst-tensions)[Cedar-IBSi Capital's Strategic Leap into Banking Tech Startups](/article/headlines/3159896-cedar-ibsi-capitals-strategic-leap-into-banking-tech-startups)",

    "text": "The son of the owner and deputy managing director of Mahmud Jeans Ltd, Rafee Mahmud, was beaten yesterday (28 November) by the factory's workers, who have been demanding their outstanding salaries. Rafee, who is also the vice-president of Bangladesh Apparel Youth Leaders Association (Bayla), in a statement to members of Bayla today (29 November) said, \"They [workers] tried to murder me yesterday. I couldn't even speak for two minutes before the mob started attacking from all around.\" \"Later I was dragged and slammed under the flyover and was assaulted by big bricks, metal rod and tree branches. As soon as I got hit on the back of my head I fainted for a while. \"Later when I became conscious, I felt them grabbing my neck suffocating me and dragging me into my factory and later they locked me inside,\" added his statement. Yesterday, workers of Mahmud Jeans Limited in Gazipur's Kaliakoir staged a demonstration blocking the Dhaka-Tangail highway all day, demanding their due wages. The blockade began at 9am today (28 November) causing traffic congestion stretching several kilometres on both sides. However, at around 8pm, the blockade was lifted on one side of the highway easing the congestion. Police and workers said the protest erupted over unpaid dues, including one month's outstanding wages for workers, service benefits, and delayed salaries of six to nine months for some factory officials. The workers further said in August, they had to stage a prolonged demonstration for unpaid wages, which had accumulated to five months at that time. Although the owners settled some payments then, dues for some workers remained. According to sources, Rafee Mahmud has been trying to sell property to pay the dues. He went to the factory yesterday evening to discuss the workers' dues that is when he was attacked. In the message to Bayla members Rafee Mahmud also said his mobile phone and all his belongings were stolen. \"Dear brothers and sisters we need to make a strong statement, if we don't stand up immediately we will lose our control over our employees and workers,\" he added. \"It was pre planned and thankfully I got proof of conversation they made in their group. I pray for all of us and the industry, we are all unsafe,\" he said.",

    "text": "ABUJA – The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) has announced plans to embark on a two weeks warning strike, commencing from December 2.\nThe decision was arrived at the National Executive Council meeting of the union in Abuja, where ASUP criticised government of reneging in implementing a number of demands tabled before it.\nPresident of ASUP, Comrade Kpanja Shammah, announced the planned industrial action, stating that the eleven demands for which government has been recalcitrant to meet, dates back to successive governments, especially former President Muhammadu Buhari.\nRecall that ASUP had issued a 15-day ultimatum to the Federal Government and other relevant agencies to immediately review and reverse all decisions inconsistent with the provisions of the Polytechnics Act and other governance instruments in the sub-sector.\nThe union had also alleged issues of impunity and disregard for clear provisions of the Federal Polytechnics Act, various edicts establishing state-owned institutions, and other governance instruments.\nASUP had also accused the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) of overstepping its bounds by intruding into the regular functions of the Academic Boards of Polytechnics, particularly concerning the admission of Higher National Diploma students within the Nigerian polytechnic system.\nKpanja said, “Our union’s National Executive Council (NEC) held its 112th session to review the current status of our engagements with proprietors of Public Polytechnics, Colleges of Technology and Monotechnics in the country.\n“The defining resolutions of our union’s 111th NEC was the issuance of a 15 days ultimatum to the government to address issues threatening the progress of the sector or face a withdrawal of services by our members nationwide.\n“The issues listed by our union include: sustained reports of impunity and disrespect of clear provisions of the Federal Polytechnics Act, different edicts establishing state owned institutions, and other instruments of governance in the sector particularly as it affects appointment of principal officers in federal and state-owned polytechnics as well as other items of governance in polytechnics.\n“The sordid display of the Governing Council of the Federal Polytechnic Nekede in the appointment process of a new Rector, and the appointment of a Rector in Federal Polytechnic Wannune without following due process were cited as recent examples of these breaches.\n“Non-review of the contentious and suspended document titled Schemes of Service for Polytechnics. Non-release of the NEEDS Assessment intervention funds for 2023.\n“Intrusion of the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) into the regular functions of the Academic Boards of Polytechnics in the admission of Higher National Diploma students in the Nigerian Polytechnic system.\n“Non capturing of the peculiar academic allowance of members for sustained payment in the planned post IPPIS era. Refusal of most state-owned polytechnics to implement the 35/25% salary review for members and non release of the arrears of same in federal polytechnics, among others.\n“Following these developments and a thorough review by our union’s 112th NEC meeting, the union resolved to withdraw the services of its members nationwide with effect from December 2nd, 2024, on a two weeks definite strike action in the first instance.\n“This shall serve as a warning to the government to resolve the issues listed or be held responsible for an indefinite action going forward.\n“We, therefore, seek the understanding and support of members of the public as we are forced to yet again battle for the soul of Nigeria’s polytechnic system in this form. We equally hope that the government will work to meet the demands of the union which is to engender a healthy teaching and learning environment in the system so as to avoid an indefinite shutdown of the sector”.",

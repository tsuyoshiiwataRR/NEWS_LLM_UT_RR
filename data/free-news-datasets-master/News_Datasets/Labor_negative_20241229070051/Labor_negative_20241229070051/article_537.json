    "text": "Amazon workers in India joined a global Black Friday strike, demanding higher wages and improved working conditions as the company gears up for its busiest shopping season. Around 200 warehouse employees and delivery drivers gathered in New Delhi under the “Make Amazon Pay” campaign, with some wearing masks resembling Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The protest mirrored similar walkouts at Amazon facilities worldwide, as workers called for better pay, safer workplaces, and union rights. Manish Kumar, a 25-year-old warehouse worker participating in the rally, said their monthly basic salary of 10,000 rupees ($120) should be increased to at least 25,000 rupees ($295). “The work environment is very stressful,” he added. Union leader Nitesh Das said the protests aim to draw government attention to their grievances. In response, Amazon India dismissed the allegations, stating, “These claims are misleading and promote a false narrative.” The company emphasized that it offers industry-leading pay, safe working conditions, and modern facilities designed to ensure workers’ well-being. “We have created over 1.5 million jobs globally and provide engaging workplaces, whether in offices or operations centers,” Amazon said in its statement. The Amazon India Workers Union announced plans for similar demonstrations across the country and globally, including in the United States, Germany, Japan, and Brazil. The protests demand fair wages, union rights, and a commitment to sustainability. The union also plans to submit its demands to India’s Labor Minister, Mansukh Mandaviya. New cases have been filed against Imran Khan and his wife India’s rapidly growing gig economy has seen workers grapple with low wages and tough working conditions. In June 2023, the National Human Rights Commission issued a notice to Amazon India following reports of workers being forced to work without breaks during extreme heat. Amazon denied the claims.

    "text": "The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) has insisted on plans to embark on a week warning strike from December 2, 2024.\nKpanja Shammah, President of ASUP, said this while addressing newsmen at the end of its 112th National Executive Council (NEC) meeting on Thursday in Abuja.\nShammah said that the Federal Government was yet to implement the 11 items in the agreements entered with ASUP.\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that ASUP had issued a 15-day ultimatum to the Federal Government and other relevant agencies.\nThe ultimatum was for them to immediately review and reverse all decisions inconsistent with provisions of the Polytechnics Act and other governance instruments in the sub-sector.\nThe union had also alleged issues of impunity and disregard for clear provisions of the Act, various edicts establishing state-owned institutions, and other governance instruments.\nAccording to Shammah, as of today, we can only attest to the resolution of item number four while item number two is ongoing. No tangible effort is being made to resolve the other items.\n“To worsen the situation, the beneficiary of the fundamentally flawed Rectorship appointment process in Federal Polytechnic Nekede is currently on a mission to destroy the union in the institution.\n“Following these developments, the union resolved to withdraw the services of its members nationwide with effect from Dec. 2 on two weeks definite strike action in the first instance,” he said.\nHe said that the strike would serve as a warning to the government to resolve the issues listed or be held responsible for an indefinite action going forward.\nThe ASUP president, however, listed their grievances to include sustained reports of impunity and disrespect of clear provisions of the Federal Polytechnics Act, and different edicts establishing state-owned institutions.\nHe also cited the appointment of a Rector in Federal Polytechnic, Wannune without following due process.\nHe said that others were the non-review of the contentious and suspended document titled “Schemes of Service for Polytechnics”, and the non-release of the NEEDS Assessment intervention funds for 2023, among others.\nHe called for the understanding and support of members of the public, adding that the union was being forced to, yet again, battle for the soul of Nigeria’s Polytechnic System through industrial action.\n“We hope that the government will work to meet the demands of the union, which is to engender a healthy teaching and learning environment, to avoid an indefinite shutdown of the sector”.",

    "text": "Western Bulldogs legend Chris Grant has walked away from his role as the club's director of football because of a breakdown in his relationship with coach Luke Beveridge.\nTension between both Grant and Beveridge has been building over the last 12 months with both the [7News](https://7news.com.au/sport/afl/western-bulldogs-footy-boss-chris-grant-steps-down-after-relationship-breakdown-with-luke-beveridge-c-16919355) and [The Age](https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/bulldogs-legend-s-exit-puts-relationship-with-beveridge-in-spotlight-20241129-p5kuqp.html) reporting it as the reason for the former's departure.\nThe Bulldogs released a glowing statement about Grant's contribution to the club, while the club icon himself also spoke positively of his time at Whitten Oval.\nGrant was appointed into the director of football role in 2016 pre-season ahead of the Bulldogs' drought-breaking premiership win.\nHe also played 341 games for the Bulldogs between 1990 and 2007, making the All Australian team on three consecutive seasons between 1997-99.\n“Club legend Chris Grant has informed the Western Bulldogs he will depart the club next month after more than 30 years of service as a player, board member, and most recently executive,” the Bulldogs statement said.\nAFL DRAFT NEWS:\n[AFL Draft 2024: First round picks from every club](https://www.sportingnews.com/au/afl/news/afl-draft-2024-player-list-every-selection-pick-club/435a58122c519b85eca16933)[AFL Draft 2024: Club by club player selections](https://www.sportingnews.com/au/afl/news/afl-draft-2024-club-club-player-selections/995124267f8fb68781d383be)[Who is the no.1 AFL draft pick? Sam Lalor named by Richmond as the prized first selection](https://www.sportingnews.com/au/afl/news/who-no1-afl-draft-pick-sam-lalor-named-richmond-prized-first-selection/b9a491c4d08db351bfd993dd)\n“Following the conclusion of a stellar playing career in the red, white, and blue, Grant joined the club’s board in 2011, before being appointed to a full-time executive position to lead the club’s football department in 2016, overseeing both men’s and women’s football programs and club football academies.\n“In the past nine seasons, Grant has presided over the most successful period in the club’s history, including winning the 2016 AFL premiership, competing in the 2021 AFL grand final in Perth and reaching the AFL finals on six occasions as well as success at state league level with Footscray winning the VFL premiership in 2016.”\nGrant's part of the statement read:\n“I’ve spent over half of my life with the club as a player and administrator and will cherish the many memories we have created together at the Western Bulldogs,” Grant said.\n“While the decision to pause and map out the next stage of my professional career has not been an easy one, I leave knowing the club is in a great position to succeed and write the next chapter in the amazing history of the red, white and blue.\n“I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the players, coaches, and football department staff across all our programs for the trust they have shown in me to manage the football department over the past nine years, forging lifelong friendships and creating some amazing memories together along the way.\n“I am looking forward to spending some quality time with Mel, Isabella, Sascha and Ollie over the coming months as we embark on the next stage of our family life together.”",

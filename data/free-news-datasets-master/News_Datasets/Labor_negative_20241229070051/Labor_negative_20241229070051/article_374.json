    "text": "Amazon workers are planning to strike from Black Friday to Cyber Monday as a part of the “Make Amazon Pay” movement.\nConducted by UNI Global Union and Progressive International, the protest highlights several critical issues that hold the company accountable for “labor abuses, environmental degradation, and threats to democracy,” according to the organizers.\nThe protest is set to take place in 20 different countries, including the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Brazil. Varsha Gandikota-Nellutia, Progressive International Co-General Coordinator, said:\n“Amazon is everywhere, but so are we. By uniting our movements across borders, we can not only force Amazon to change its ways but lay the foundations of a world that prioritizes human dignity, not Jeff Bezos’ bank balance.\nChristy Hoffman, general secretary of UNI Global Union, mentioned,\nAmazon's relentless pursuit of profit comes at a cost to workers, the environment and democracy.\"\nThis year marks the fifth year that the workers are conducting the “Make Amazon Pay” protest. Many unions and allied groups around the world are planning to participate, according to UNI Global Union.\nHow has Amazon responded to the protest?\nIn its response, Amazon has characterized the organizers as promoting a false and misleading narrative. They claimed to pay great pay and opportunities to the workers.\nAn Amazon spokesperson, Eileen Hards, told Fox News:\n“The fact is, at Amazon we provide great pay, great benefits, and great opportunities—all from day one. We’ve created more than 1.5 million jobs around the world and counting, and we provide a modern, safe, and engaging workplace whether you work in an office or at one of our operations buildings.”\nAnother Amazon spokesperson has rejected the claims and said that the workers are trying to promote a fake narrative. “This group is being intentionally misleading and continues to promote a false narrative...The fact is, at Amazon we provide great pay, great benefits, and great opportunities,” the spokesperson said.\nHow would it impact the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales?\nThe protest could largely impact the biggest shopping events of the year—Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\nThe strike could lead to a delay in product delivery. This might affect the shipment of many goods to the customers worldwide.\nThe reduction in the workforce can also act as a hindrance, including major markets in the United States, UK, and Germany. This could impact Amazon’s operations for the processing of orders on time and management of the logistics in peak hours.\nAccording to a report, Amazon accounted for at least 18% of sales worldwide during the Black Friday sales, generating over $170 billion in total holiday sales. Due to the strike, the sales might decrease as shoppers might turn to other retailers in case they experience delivery delays.\nThe strike might influence the public to think twice before placing an order on Amazon since it is aimed at “environmental degradation and threats to democracy,” affecting the loyal customers of Amazon.",

    "text": "STORY: Workers at Volkswagen could go out on strike across Germany as soon as next week.\nThat's what the IG Metall union said in a notice on Friday (November 29).\nIt comes amid a clash between labor and management over layoffs and plant closures.\nWarning strikes at the carmaker's plants across Germany are reportedly expected to take place as soon as Monday.\nIt would mark the first large-scale walkouts at the company's domestic operations since 2018.\nWarning strikes usually last from a few hours up to a day.\nVolkswagen has demanded a 10% wage cut.\nIt says it needs to slash costs and boost profit to defend market share in the face of cheap competition from China and a drop in European demand.\nIt is also threatening to close plants in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history.\nLabour representatives and management will meet again on December 9th to carry on negotiations.\nBut the strikes could escalate into 24-hour or unlimited strikes if a deal is not struck.\nThat would put a dent in Volkswagen's output at a time when the carmaker is already facing declining deliveries and plunging profits.\nShare Â© Reuters - 2024",

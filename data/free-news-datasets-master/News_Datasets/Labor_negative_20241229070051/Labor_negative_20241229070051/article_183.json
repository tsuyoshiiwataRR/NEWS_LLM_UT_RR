    "text": "178 employees ⁤are affected. They are looking for jobs in a corporate environment . “Siemens currently has around 100 job openings in Austria,” says‍ the German electronics company. The reason⁤ for the end was that capabilities ⁢in the field of automation would be adjusted worldwide to strengthen competitiveness.\n“Part of these measures are changes ⁤in the industrial sector at Siemens ⁢Austria,” the company said. At the same time, ‌the European ‌production resources at the factory in Sibiu,⁣ Romania,‌ would be ​used as needed,” explained Siemens in a press release. This measure would increase synergies in the⁤ region for​ which ⁣Austria‍ is ‍responsible.\nManagement‌ remains in Vienna Management of the global industrial power supply business, including the research and growth ⁣center and product and quality management, will remain ‌in ‌Vienna.In total, around 9,300 people work⁤ for Siemens​ in Austria. Sales in the financial year 2023 ​amounted to 3.2 billion euros.Siemens ‍austria serves 25 other countries ⁢from Vienna.\nOn Wednesday, German car ‌supplier Schaeffler announced that it would be closing its factory ‍in Berndorf, Lower Austria, at the⁤ end of next year. ⁢450 employees⁣ are affected. ⁢It‍ was previously known ‍that the traditional Upper Austrian company KTM had gone bankrupt. The‌ Pierer Mobility subsidiary is currently preparing an application for self-administered restructuring ‍proceedings.\nIndustrial association is afraid The Industrial Association⁢ (IV) sounded the alarm on⁢ Thursday. “Every day we get new news from companies that are‌ struggling. “Factory closings,job cuts,salary cut negotiations ⁢and bankruptcies are on the rise,” IV​ President Georg Knill ⁣said in a press release. “We have been warning of similar situations for​ months – what ⁢must⁤ happen now to finally take countermeasures?” he asked politicians.\nFrom the⁣ point of view of⁣ the representative of the​ industry, ⁢the⁤ reasons are “manny and sadly also home-made”.‌ In​ particular,⁢ Knill addressed​ “high inflation and irresponsible wage⁣ agreements in recent years”. Labor unit ​costs⁢ in this country have increased by 30.2 percent from 2021, but in Germany by 14.3 percent and in Italy by only 7.1 percent, ‍Knill calculated. Therefore, local competitiveness suffers.\nPRO-GE⁤ IV Counters: “The latest ‌class” Knill’s comparison of the local and German⁣ collective bargaining systems instantly​ upset the union. The IV disqualifies itself as a partner for an active site and industrial policy with “supposed arguments ⁤(…),” said the head of the production‌ union (PRO-GE), Reinhold‌ Binder. The‌ two systems cannot be compared; in the German metal and electrical industry, for example, a 35-hour week is ‍in place in ⁢large parts.\n“Also, the key‍ economic indicators ⁣were different in the past and the growth rates of Austrian industry were much higher then those of Germany. If the IV analysis was correct, Germany would now be an economic driver and not in crisis mode,” said Binder.\nEnergy‍ costs in Austria ⁢have also risen more considerably since 2020⁢ than⁣ wages in industry. “It is‌ unrealistic to act as if social partners do not agree on wage ‍agreements but are dictated by the unions,” ​says Binder.⁣ He accepts that the IV “really intends to ​gradually devalue the wages and ⁢salaries⁣ of the employees”. The statements of President IV were “excellent” ⁤and correspond to “post-truth propaganda”.\nHow can local communities effectively contribute⁢ to global climate change mitigation efforts? Certainly! Below is‍ a fictional interview between a Time.news editor and an expert in the field of climate change. ⁣This engaging format allows for dynamic conversation, providing insights into current issues.",

    "text": "During the 19 months of the United States’ involvement in World War I, the federal government froze industrial workers’ wages to finance its military effort. After the war ended on Nov. 11, 1918, the American economy boomed with massive exports for Europe’s rebuilding program. Workers in this country, though, did not receive pay raises, and in 1919 many unions across the country went on strike demanding more money and better working conditions. The government refused to intervene until the United Mine Workers (UMW) walked off the job on Nov. 1. Coal provided the vast majority of the country’s energy, and the United States considered mining an essential industry. This natural resource had fueled the Industrial Revolution; cries of “Bolshevik Revolution” and “Communism” echoed around the nation. This UMW strike greatly affected Illinois, where 77 of the state’s 102 counties engaged in coal mining and union membership totaled nearly 90,000. As part of the massive Colchester Seam (one of the world’s largest coal reserves) centered in Schuyler County, Quincy greatly suffered. Many homes and businesses went without sufficient heat and the economy here — and across the nation — spiraled toward depression, with dwindling coal supplies forcing rations and sacrifices.",

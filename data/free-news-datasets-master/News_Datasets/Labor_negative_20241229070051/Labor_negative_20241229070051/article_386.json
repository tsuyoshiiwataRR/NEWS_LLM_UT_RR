    "text": "Just under a tenth (9.5%) of software engineers do almost no work, according to new research from academics at Stanford University.\nOne researcher, Yegor Denisov-Blanch, posted the findings to his X account, dubbing the staff who work less than 10% as hard as the median engineer as ‘ghost’ engineers.\nThese engineers do “virtually nothing,” Denisov-Blanch said, and it’s possible that some may even have multiple jobs.\nThe report used data from more than 50,000 engineers at hundreds of different companies. According to the paper itself , the researchers collected this data specifically from private commercial repositories and public repositories.\nThe research was undertaken to help automate the code review process via the use of an algorithm developed by the researchers. It was inspired, in part, by the demand for efficient software development practices.\n“ Manual code reviews are an essential but time-consuming part of software development, often leading reviewers to prioritize technical issues while skipping valuable assessments,” the researchers said.\n“This paper presents an algorithmic model that automates aspects of code review typically avoided due to their complexity or subjectivity, such as assessing coding time, implementation time, and code complexity ,” they added.",

    "text": "The employee was working without breaks, over 16 hours a day. Just when they needed some assurance from their manager, she took a step back.\nWe love our jobs or line of work but cannot stand the mistreatment by staff or management as it leads to a toxic environment. Working conditions have deteriorated in many places and employees are forced to take action where they stand up for themselves. In addition to that, after putting in all the hard work, when you are falsely accused of lying, it surely ticks you off. [u/kennyr101](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/16ihk69/quit_my_job/) shared their experience in a similar situation.\nThe user captioned their post, \"Quit my job\" on the platform. The employee explained that they had been working in a brewery for over 5 years. It was a busy season and they were busted with work and overtime shifts. The employee said, \"During a busy period, I worked 2 weeks straight, no days off, no breaks, just quick 5 min smoke breaks where possible.\" They also said that they're working for over 16 hours per day. Exhausted, as one would be, when the employee called in for extra staff, their area manager reprimanded them. When they explained the situation and overtime shifts, the manager did not believe it. The worker said, \"I got the response of 'Well, I don't believe that,' effectively calling me a liar in the politest way.\"\nIt got the employee on their nerves and they left the building for their break. They told the area manager, \"I'm going on my break, I'll be back in 1 hour.\" The employee then decided that they had had enough and that they did not need to be in a place where they were falsely titled a \"liar\" or not given basic acknowledgment. They added that when they got back from their break, there was a different area manager. But they stayed firm and did what they had to do. \"I walked in, handed over my keys and said 'I quit,' explained why and walked out.\"\nThe employee was not thrilled about their decision, but it was high time they cut the toxicity. They said, \"Never in my 39 years of work have I ever quit a job on the spot.\" They further mentioned that they would always hand in a notice and complete their period, leaving them in \"good standing.\" The user concluded their post by saying, \"It's true, people don't quit jobs. They quit managers.\" Having given all they could towards their job, the worker was deprived of respect, which is a compulsory right of an employee.\nPeople in the comment section agreed with the Reddit user. [u/RandallFlagg6666](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/16ihk69/comment/k0jn763/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) said, \"Already laughing about how your area manager's going to have to explain it to the higher-ups. Incredible how many 'people managers' have no business managing actual people.\" [u/Ambitious_Ad_1937](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/16ihk69/comment/k0kjvw1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) said, \"I think as soon as a manager starts calling you a liar on work-related things like how many hours you worked or needing a day off, one must start looking for another job.\"\nOther users also shared their experiences of how toxic workplaces and managers caused them to leave their jobs.[ u/Consistent_Bus_9017 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/16ihk69/comment/k0lgsg6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)said, \"I, too, have only quit one job there on the spot. I was a manager of an auto repair shop. One day, after 2 years of hell, my boss didn't like the shoes I had on. I had had enough and stripped my uniform off right there, handed him my keys and quit.\"\nThis article originally appeared 1 year ago.",

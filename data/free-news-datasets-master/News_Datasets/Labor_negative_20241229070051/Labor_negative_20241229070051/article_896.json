    "text": "A story from a netizen said that he/she was not paid a daily wage while working as a guest part-time job on the wedding day, and that his/her contact information was blocked.\nRecently, an article titled \"I went to a guest part-time job and I was blocked\" was posted on the online community.\nThe writer A wrote, \"A few days ago, I was worried because there were so few guests ahead of the wedding, so I said I could attend it and I would go with my child to watch it,\" adding, \"I was so busy with the promised date that I forgot about it, but I heard that I could get a call.\"\n\"I forgot to come to a different place, but all the people who were supposed to come said they couldn't come, so I was worried that I was going to prepare and go out right away.\" I came home, prepared quickly, and went to the wedding hall,\" he explained.\nAt that time, the prospective bride-to-be asked A to come if he had any more acquaintances who could come with him, and asked him to put 10,000 won per person in a congratulatory money bag because he had to receive a meal ticket. The 10,000 won that was put in the congratulatory money envelope will be returned after the ceremony.\nMr. A wrote that he visited the wedding hall with his acquaintance and couple and paid the congratulatory money instead.\nAfter completing the photo shoot, Mr. A contacted him after the ceremony to return the 30,000 won he had paid to receive the meal ticket with a blessing. Two days later, City B, who said he saw it now because he was on a honeymoon, and that he would remit it in the evening, finally blocked A.\nA said, \"Our faces would have been taken in the wedding photos that will last a lifetime, but if it were me, I would feel uncomfortable every time I see it,\" adding, \"It's not a problem to live without 30,000 won, but it's really empty.\"\nNetizens who saw this responded, \"You're still getting married,\" \"I see why you don't have friends,\" \"I'm about to feel sorry for someone who marries love for a penny or two on a good day of a wedding,\" and \"It's worth knowing why you got a guest part-time job.\"",

    "text": "By Julia Jacobo ,\n1 days ago\nWorkers for the largest online retailer in the world are on strike during one of the busiest shopping weekends of the holiday season.\nAmazon employees have begun protesting, with demonstrations planned in more than 20 countries starting on Black Friday over \"labor abuses, environmental degradation and threats to democracy,\" according to UNI Global Union and Progressive International, a Switzerland-based global labor union.\nDemonstrators are calling for increased wages, improved working conditions, and for employees to be permitted to unionize.\nDubbed the \"Make Amazon Pay days of resistance,\" the strike is scheduled to last from Black Friday through Cyber Monday, the union announced in a press release . Protests can be expected in major cities in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, India, Brazil and more.\nNathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty Images - PHOTO: Demonstrators during a 'Make Amazon Pay' protest outside an Amazon Fresh store in Washington, DC, Nov. 25, 2022. The strike could lead to delays in holiday deliveries for customers, economy experts told ABC News .\nUnions and allied groups around the world are planning to participate, according to UNI Global Union.\nMORE: Some airport workers go on strike during Thanksgiving travel Thousands of workers in the German cities of Graben, Dortmund Werne, Bad Hersfeld, Leipzig, Koblenz and Rheinberg planned to protest, in addition to hundreds in New Delhi, who are demonstrating to demand fair treatment following the mistreatment of workers during a heat wave in July, the union said.\nThe Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions and Citizen's Action will hold protests in multiple cities across France, and garment workers will also take to the streets in Bangladesh, the union said.\nJacob King/PA Images via Getty Images - PHOTO: Amazon staff members on a GMB union picket line outside the online retailer's site in Coventry, England, as they take part in a strike in their long-running dispute over pay, held on Black Friday, Nov. 24, 2024. This year marks the fifth annual Make Amazon Pay demonstration, which aims to \"hold Amazon accountable around the world\" by targeting a busy holiday shopping weekend. In 2023, Amazon represented 18% of the worldwide Black Friday sales, with more than $170 billion in total holiday sales, according to an earnings report released earlier this year.\n\"Amazon's relentless pursuit of profit comes at a cost to workers, the environment and democracy,\" said Christy Hoffman, general secretary of UNI Global Union. \"[Jeff] Bezos' company has spent untold millions to stop workers from organizing, but the strikes and protests happening around the world show that workers' desire for justice -- for union representation -- can't be stopped. We stand united in demanding that Amazon treat its workers fairly, respect fundamental rights, and stop undermining the systems meant to protect us all.\"\nMORE: Inside an alleged Amazon union-busting campaign in Kentucky: 'They want to scare us' Amazon defended its treatment of workers in a statement to ABC News on Thursday.\n\"This group is being intentionally misleading and continues to promote a false narrative,\" Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards said. \"The fact is at Amazon we provide great pay, great benefits, and great opportunities -- all from day one. We've created more than 1.5 million jobs around the world, and counting, and we provide a modern, safe, and engaging workplace whether you work in an office or at one of our operations buildings.\"\nThe company announced earlier this year a $2.2 billion investment to increase pay for fulfillment and transportation employees in the U.S. As a result, the average base wage for these employees is now more than $22 per hour and the average total compensation more than $29 per hour when the value of their elected benefits is factored in, according to the company.\nComprehensive benefits for these employees that begin on the first day of employment include health, vision and dental insurance; a 401(k) with 50% company match; up to 20 weeks paid leave, which includes 14 weeks of pregnancy-related disability leave and six weeks of parental leave; and Amazon's Career Choice program, which prepays college tuition, according to Amazon.\nAn earlier statement to ABC News from Amazon stated: \"While we're always listening and looking at ways to improve, we remain proud of the competitive pay, comprehensive benefits and engaging, safe work experiences we provide our teams.\"\nBrett_hondow/Getty Images - PHOTO: Amazon warehouse facility storefront exterior in Houston, Tx., April 4, 2021. Amazon workers have been outspoken in recent years about workers' rights, especially as the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic increased the number of online orders. E-commerce sales in the U.S. increased by $244.2 billion -- or 43% -- in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, rising from $571.2 billion in 2019 to $815.4 billion in 2020, according to the Census Bureau's Annual Retail Trade Survey .\nIn 2022, a worker-led independent group led the first-ever U.S. union at the company, unionizing a 6,000-employee Amazon warehouse in Staten Island, New York.\nMORE: Nearly 2,000 Amazon workers to walk out after return to office While subsequent attempts at facilities in Alabama and New York have failed, efforts have continued.\nIn June 2023, nearly 2,000 Amazon workers organized a walkout after a mandate to return to the office was issued. In Kentucky, Amazon employees who spoke to ABC News alleged that the company was leading a union-busting campaign to discourage employees from organizing.\nAmazon told ABC News last year that the disciplinary action taken by the company at an Amazon facility in Kentucky came in response to infractions of company policy.\n\"Amazon squeezes everything that it can get, but it changes its behavior depending on its jurisdiction,\" James Schneider, communications director for Progressive International, told ABC News this week. \"Let's say, in Sweden, it engages much better at how it operates with trade unions. But in the U.S., it engages in union busting.\"\nKrisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg via Getty Images - PHOTO: Demonstrators hold up a 'Make Amazon Pay' banner during a demonstration supporting Amazon.com workers, on a day of global strike action by the company's employees, on Black Friday in Berlin, Germany, Nov. 25, 2022. A 2022 report by the United Nations' International Labour Organization found that post-pandemic inflation and the rising cost of living have been decreasing the value of minimum wage globally.\nThe rise of inflation has paved the way for collective action, experts say . (Starbucks was also part of the 2022 union resurgence.)\n\"Amazon is everywhere, but so are we. By uniting our movements across borders, we can not only force Amazon to change its ways but lay the foundations of a world that prioritizes human dignity, not Jeff Bezos' bank balance,\" said Varsha Gandikota-Nellutla, Progressive International's co-general coordinator.\nABC News' Max Zahn contributed to this report.",

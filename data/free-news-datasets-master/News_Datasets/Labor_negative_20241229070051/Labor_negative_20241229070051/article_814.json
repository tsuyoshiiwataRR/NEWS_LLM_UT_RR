    "text": "There was a standoff at the Nzoia Sugar Factory on Friday after workers downed their tools and protested delays in the payment of salaries.\nThe workers say they have not received their salaries for the last nine months, with the management offering only empty promises.\n\"From July 2023 to date, we have already accumulated nine months of salary arrears. We are appealing to the government to probe Nzoia Suugar. These workers have endured enough and have reached a point of no return, and we will demand our rights... whether it is night or day,\" Bernard Wanyonyi, a Sugar Workers Union Official, said.\nThe workers likewise blamed the current leadership for the crisis facing the factory and called on the government to intervene and resolve their issues.\n\"Our sister companies are doing well. Where are we as Nzoia Sugar going wrong?\" Miriam Wanyama, a Nzoia Sugar Company employee, posed.\nThe protests come despite President William Ruto's promise in August that Ksh.150 million would be released within two weeks to pay salaries and clear arrears owed to sugarcane farmers.\nThe factory management, through board chairperson Alfred Khangati, attributed the delay to the factory not operating normally, as cane crushing had been halted.\nHowever, he assured that efforts are underway to clear the outstanding salary arrears.\nTags: Citizen Digital Protests Nzoia Sugar Factory Want to send us a story?

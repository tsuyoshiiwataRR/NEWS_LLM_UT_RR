    "text": "The Canada Post workers’ union claims that the employer laid off striking employees when the resumption of negotiations was announced. The walkout of more than 55,000 workers at the Crown corporation is in its second week.\nWorker representatives call the layoffs an intimidation tactic.\nCanada Post confirmed the layoffs, emphasizing that they were temporary.\nThe Crown corporation’s spokesperson said the employer had informed employees that collective agreements were no longer in effect and their terms of employment had now changed, in accordance with the Canada Labor Code – in reference to the section of the code that covers lockout notices.\nResumption of negotiations Earlier Thursday, the union showed some optimism with the resumption of negotiations after a short break imposed by the federal mediator because the parties remain too far apart on crucial issues, explained federal Labor Minister Steven MacKinnon.\nAs for the postal workers on strike, several of whom are demonstrating this Thursday in front of Canada Post headquarters, we say we are optimistic. Yannick Scott, national director of the CUPW metropolitan Montreal region, even hopes to reach an agreement before the end of the holiday season.\nIn an interview with Radio-Canada, Mr. Scott indicates, however, that much remains to be done.\nHe is careful not to comment on the course of the negotiations, but affirms that they are stumbling in particular on the question of flexibility.\nThey want to change the delivery system that allows them to provide service seven days a week with much more precarious jobs, temporary employees with completely different conditions. [de celles des autres].\nA quote from Yannick Scott, national director of the CUPW metropolitan Montreal region\nHe also says he is worried about the future of the company. We know that Canada Post is a public service, which has a legal obligation to deliver to all addresses in the country, which is not the case for the competition.\nThe latest conflicts at Canada Post ended with the intervention of an arbitrator who imposed working conditions.\nThere have been no real negotiations at Canada Post for ten years. Last time, in 2018, it ended with a special law […] and it was ultimately an arbitrator in 2020 who set the working conditions.\nA quote from Marc Ranger, former Quebec director, Public Service Union (CUPE)\nOpen in full screen mode\nMarc Ranger, former Quebec director, Public Service Union (Archive photo)\nPhoto: The Canadian Press / Jacques Boissinot\nMr. Ranger points out that when arbitration is imposed, it never resolves the fundamental problems. The files set aside during these arbitrations accumulate and rise to the surface, affirms Yannick Scott.\nLast Monday, the federal Minister of Labor, Steven MacKinnon, admitted that the negotiations were difficult and that he did not foresee a rapid end to the strike.\nWith information from The Canadian Press",

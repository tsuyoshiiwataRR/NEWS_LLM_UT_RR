    "text": "[Industry](/news/industry)- 1 min read\nCar parts supplier company Valeo to slash around 1,000 jobs in Europe\nValeo, a French car parts supplier, is reducing its workforce by 1,000 employees. Sources familiar with the matter stated that over 800 employees in France will be impacted by these job cuts, while other reductions will take place in the company’s operations in Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic.\nFrench car parts supplier Valeo has revealed plans to cut approximately 1,000 jobs across Europe, with the restructuring efforts also leading to the closure of two of its sites in France. Sources familiar with the matter stated that over 800 employees in France will be impacted by these job cuts, while other reductions will take place in the company’s operations in Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic.\nThis decision follows a reduction in Valeo's annual sales forecast in October, amid ongoing difficulties within the European automotive sector. The company, which supplies components for both traditional and electric vehicles, has been grappling with a slowdown in domestic orders. Additionally, increased competition from Asian manufacturers, particularly those producing lower-cost electric vehicles, has intensified the challenges faced by European car parts suppliers.\nThe move by Valeo aligns with a broader trend within the automotive industry. Earlier in November, tire manufacturer Michelin also announced plans to cut 1,250 jobs, contributing to concerns over employment stability within the sector. French-Italian carmaker Stellantis further intensified the situation, revealing plans to close its Vauxhall van factory in southern England, affecting hundreds of workers. Ford has also followed suit, announcing a reduction of around 14% of its European workforce, underscoring the pressure many car manufacturers are facing amid economic uncertainty and a shift in consumer preferences.\nThe cumulative impact of these layoffs and closures reflects the broader challenges faced by the\nThis decision follows a reduction in Valeo's annual sales forecast in October, amid ongoing difficulties within the European automotive sector.

    "text": "Amazon workers, alongside allies, are organizing a worldwide strike from Black Friday to Cyber Monday as part of the \"Make Amazon Pay\" movement.\nThe strike, planned by UNI Global Union and Progressive International, aims to draw attention to what organizers claim are labor abuses, environmental degradation, and threats to democracy caused by the e-commerce giant.\nThe protest, scheduled to begin on Friday, will span one of the busiest shopping periods of the year, coinciding with Black Friday sales and Cyber Monday promotions. Workers from over 20 countries, supported by more than 80 trade unions and advocacy groups, are expected to participate. Protests are planned in cities across the globe, including in France, Germany, and India’s capital, New Delhi.\nThis marks the fifth year of the Make Amazon Pay campaign, which seeks to hold Amazon accountable for what organizers call unethical business practices. Christy Hoffman, General Secretary of UNI Global Union, stated that Amazon’s focus on maximizing profits has been detrimental to both its workers and the wider economy. Hoffman pointed out that despite the company's substantial spending to deter union efforts, the ongoing strikes and protests reflect the growing demand for justice and union representation among Amazon workers.\nThe strike is expected to have significant effects on Amazon’s operations, potentially causing delays in holiday deliveries. Organizers hope the action will amplify the message that the company's relentless pursuit of profits should not come at the expense of workers' rights and environmental sustainability.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our [Comments FAQ](/comments-policy)",

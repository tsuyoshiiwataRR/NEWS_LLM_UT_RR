    "text": "Job satisfaction is on the rise but despite the expectation that this will lead to retention, one in three workers are considering switching jobs in the next six months. A new Inaugural Global Talent Barometer report by ManpowerGroup conducted a study across 16 countries, interviewing 12,000 workers, and it found that while 80% of workers were finding meaning in their work, 35% of them were considering changing jobs in the next few months.\nThe study measured three indices—well-being (64%), job satisfaction (63%), and confidence (74%)—and the overall talent barometer fell at 67%. Workers appeared to report a positive job experience, however, they were still not satisfied with their employment conditions to consider staying on at their jobs.\nImage: Pexels\nEmployees Are Considering Leaving Jobs Despite Meaningful Work With job cuts and layoffs dominating a large part of the conversation surrounding work, intentional quitting has been ignored these last few months. We have moved away from the large-scale movement that saw workers quit their jobs in hoards, however, there is some degree of attrition to be noted regardless of the social and economic climate. Job change trends suggest that voluntary quitting has declined in the last few months, however, the number is not zero.\nAccording to the study, 47% of young workers aged 18-27 are considering moving on to their next opportunity. Overall, one in three employees planning on leaving doesn’t make a big number, but it is still a statistic worth investigating.\nThe numbers show that stress and lack of satisfactory on-the-job training and support could be possible reasons for employees planning a job change. It is also important to note that globally, 1 in 4 workers anticipate a job termination in the next six months, which might motivate them to look for alternate roles before the company moves to fire them.\nStress and Impaired Well-Being Remain an Area of Concern Job satisfaction is not enough for retention. From the report, the numbers indicate that 49% of workers say they experience stress at work every day. Some amount of stress is to be expected at any workplace, but a constant state of pressure can become difficult to manage.\nA Forbes report from earlier in May pointed out that one-third of Americans said their work was adversely impacting their mental health, with 80% reporting they felt stress at work. Prolonged high-stress conditions while working almost always guarantee burnout, so it’s not a surprise that employees are considering quitting despite finding meaning and purpose in their work.\nFully remote or hybrid workers report the highest level of work-life balance, but even they are considering quitting their roles. There is evidence to suggest that 41% of remote workers, despite having higher well-being levels, are likely to switch roles.\nIT workers report the highest amount of daily stress, but this is tempered by the fact that they also have the highest numbers in work-life balance. Workers with less daily stress are twice as likely to stay with their current jobs, which means employers have to work to reduce the stressful conditions of work or provide solutions to mitigate the impact of this stress.\nJob Confidence and Lack of Mentorship Also Play a Role in the Job Change Apart from stress, the lack of support at work and the opportunity for growth are also key factors in determining whether your employees consider leaving their jobs. About 59% of workers have said that they have not received any skill training in the past six months. Additionally, only 39% of workers said they had a mentor for the kind of guidance one might expect at work.\nEmployees on the lookout for personal and professional improvement count on training and mentorship to grow as individuals, and the lack of such initiatives can persuade them to look elsewhere for a more supportive environment. Around 34% of employees have said that they do not have enough opportunities to achieve their career goals even when we know that a clear career path is a critical consideration in any job role.\nWe’ve seen earlier reports of employers convinced that Gen Z workers were insufficiently trained for the workforce, but organizations themselves also appear to lack sufficient training to bring old and young workers up to speed with the latest trends and skills dominating every industry.\nEmployees are seeking purpose in their work and appear satisfied with the technology and managerial interest in their career, however, there are still a few changes that employers can make to improve retention within their organization.",

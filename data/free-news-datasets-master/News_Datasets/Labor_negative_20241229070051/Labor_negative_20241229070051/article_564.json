    "text": "As Canada Post’s unionized workers hit their second week of being on the picket line, the company has confirmed it’s temporarily laying off postal workers.\nEmployees with the Canadian Union of Postal Workers have been on strike since Friday, Nov. 15.\nIt means no regular mail or parcels have been delivered to customers.\nA mediator was sent by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service on Tuesday, Nov. 19, to try and get some agreement between union representatives and management, however the mediator has temporarily stepped away, citing both sides are still too far apart.\nOn Nov. 25 the union issued a notice that “Canada Post has been calling CUPW members to lay them off.”\n“Rather than make an effort to bargain good collective agreements that meet the needs of postal workers and the public, Canada Post has dug in its heels,” the union posted on its website. “Canada Post refuses to drop its proposed rollbacks that will create a second class of worker and undermine good, full-time jobs.”\nRecent disruptions\nWhile Canadian businesses and residents deal with the lack of postal delivery service, this isn’t the first strike that has impacted some routines.\nThe Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) went on strike on July 5, after contract negotiations broke down between the company and members of the Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU). The strike ended on July 22.\nAnd Air Canada had to cancel some flights in September as the agency prepared for a potential strike with more than 5,200 unionized pilots.\nAir Canada was finalizing contingency plans to suspend most of its operations beginning Sept. 15.\nFortunately, a last-minute deal was reached prior to pilots walking the picket line, and service resumed as normal.\nAccording to a Nov. 26 release from Statistics Canada, just under one-third of Canadian workers — approximately 5.3 million people — were in a collective bargaining unit in 2023.\nPublic sector workers were five times more likely to be in a union than private sector employees, StatsCan said.\nAnd in 2023, there was a significant number of workdays lost due to strike action.\n“Going on strike is a final option available to unions when negotiations with management reach an impasse,” the data collector said. “Strikes were much more prevalent in Canada during the 1970s and early 1980s.”\nIn 2023, the number of person-days not worked due to labour disputes rose to its highest level since 1986, at 6.6 million days — mostly due to strikes in the educational services and public administration sectors.\nAnd Statistics Canada also found that the number of people in a union has fallen since 1997. Back then, 21.3 per cent of workers were in a union. Last year, there were 15.5 people in a union.\nHowever, another blast from the past may be playing a role in some of the current labour unrest.\nBack in the 1970s and 80s, inflation was actually a contributor.\n“In 1980, for example, the annual average rate of inflation was 12.5 per cent,” StatsCan said.\nWith lower rates that followed, another spike has been seen in the past few years. The Consumer Price Index rose by 6.8 per cent in 2022 and saw a 3.9-per cent increase in 2023.\n“Higher inflation may therefore be related to the highest level of labour disruptions we have seen in almost four decades in 2023.”\nFor more information about labour union statistics, visit statcan.gc.ca.",

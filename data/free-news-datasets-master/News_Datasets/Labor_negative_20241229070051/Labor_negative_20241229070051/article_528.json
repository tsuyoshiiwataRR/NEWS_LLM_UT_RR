    "text": "G4S workers outside Whitehall (Photo: Alan Kenny)\nSecurity guards at government departments in the heart of London are on strike over their rotten pay and conditions. There is a defiant mood on the picket lines with speeches, music and support from other trade unionists.\nThe strikers in the PCS union work at the Cabinet Office, Department for Business and Trade and Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT).\nSpeaking to Socialist Worker, one striker said, “Everyone enjoys the picket lines. The music makes a big difference.\n“The union has tried to raise the voice of people who aren’t supported by anyone. We have had PCS reps come down to support us from the DSIT department. They understand why we are picketing.”\nThe strikers work for private company G4S. There were calls for the firm to be banned from bidding for government contracts after it failed to provide enough security staff for the London Olympics in 2012. But G4S is once again winning security contracts and keeping workers in poverty.\nThe striker said, “It’s a government building, it’s taxpayers’ money they are using and we are there to protect a government building but they outsource the security services to the lowest bidder. I think taxpayers need to understand what is happening in government buildings.”\n“We are not asking for everything, just basics such as sick pay and reduced working hours. We are working 72 hours in a week, 12 hours a day and six days a week. We are suffering. We don’t have a family life or a social life.\n“They are exploiting the workers when they should work with people.\n“It’s the same outsourcing that is happening everywhere, in hospitals and universities.”\nThe strikes are starting to have an effect. “They are bringing in inexperienced people to cover for us but there has only been the minimum cover needed to keep the building open.”\nThey plan to be out again on strike again from 9-13 December and are asking for wider support.\n10 South Colonnade, London, E14 5EA, 10 Victoria Street, London, SW1H 0NB, Old Admiralty Buildings, London, SW1A 2EG, 22-26 Whitehall, London, SW1A 2EG, 70 Whitehall, London, SW1A 2AS (Note this picket line starts at 7am) Send a solidarity donation to the PCS fighting fund with the reference “GPA FM Disputes”—Account Name: PCS Fighting Fund Levy, Account Number: 20331490, Sort Code: 60-83-01 Send a message of solidarity to outsourcedworkers@pcs.org.uk",

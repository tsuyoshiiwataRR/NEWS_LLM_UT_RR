    "text": "Employees of the US e-commerce giant Amazon are planning a global strike during one of the company's most important weekends, from Black Friday to Cyber Monday. The newspaper \"The Hill\" reports, specifying that the protest action, called \"Make Amazon Pay\", is organized by the trade union federation Uni Global Union and the international political organization Progressive International, which brings together and mobilizes activists and left-wing groups.\nThe strike is scheduled to begin today, November 29, and end next Monday, December 2. It aims to hold the company accountable for labor abuses, “environmental degradation,” and “threats to democracy” denounced by workers. According to organizers, thousands of protesters in more than 20 countries are planning to join the strike, with protests planned in France, Germany, and India.\nRead also other news on [Nova News](https://www.agenzianova.com/en/news)\n[Click here and receive updates on WhatsApp](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaZNLBP6BIEk5MzqOb2Q)\nFollow us on the social channels of Nova News on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/agenzia_nova), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/64989554/admin/), [Instagram, ](https://www.instagram.com/agenzia.nova/)[Telegram](https://t.me/novanewsagenzia)",

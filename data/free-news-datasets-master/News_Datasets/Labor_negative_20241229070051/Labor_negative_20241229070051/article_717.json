    "text": "DIANE ABBOTT MP condemns the government's vicious attack on benefits that callously denies the pandemic's impact on the working class while pushing vulnerable people into unsuitable work through punitive measures THERE is now overwhelming evidence that the government is reimposing austerity measures. This is true in relation to income tax, public spending after next year, higher energy bills, bus fares and other prices determined by government.\nBut perhaps one of the most misunderstood aspects of austerity has been the planned cuts to the welfare bill.\nYet Keir Starmer, Liz Kendall and a host of other ministers have done their best to dispel any complacency on this issue. People who are on welfare, for whatever reason, are in the government's firing line.\nTheir attack has two prongs. The first is that there is a blanket assertion that the welfare bill is \"too high\" and the second is that they will crack down on benefit fraud. Deliberately or otherwise, it is clear that these two issues are closely connected.\nPromising \"radical reforms to get Britain working,\" in a recent article, Starmer went on to say, \"In the coming months, Mail on Sunday readers will see even more sweeping changes. Because make no mistake, we will get to grips with the bulging benefits bill blighting our society.\"\nApart from a puerile devotion to alliteration from one of Starmer's junior advisers, what we learnt from this is that the government's attack on welfare, in general, is completely divorced from reality.\nBritain has among the lowest state pensions in the whole of Western Europe, with now the highest eligible retirement ages, too. Ministers and right-wing commentators are fond of pointing out how many people of working age are not currently in work.\nThey are not counting those who, after years of debilitating manual work, simply can no longer carry on in work. There are also those who want to enjoy their retirement and have left work at what would have been their previous retirement age, even though they have to take a financial hit to do so.\nIn this country, we also have among the worst provisions for statutory maternity leave and paternity leave, both in terms of entitlement and pay.â€¦",

    "text": "Thousands of workers, including teachers, healthcare professionals, and sanitation staff, staged an eight-hour general strike across Italy on Friday, protesting against stagnant wages, rising living costs, and declining public services. The strike, organized by Italy’s largest trade unions, targeted Premier Giorgia Meloni’s budget policies, which unions claim underfund crucial sectors such as education and healthcare. Protesters also called for a fairer distribution of private sector profits to workers. “These demonstrations are not just a message for the government,” said Maurizio Landini, leader of the CGIL trade union, during a rally in Bologna. “They are directed at business leaders and managers who have enjoyed unprecedented profits in recent years.” The industrial action disrupted various services, including education, healthcare, and transportation. ITA Airways canceled several domestic and international flights, while schools and hospitals faced significant slowdowns. Although unions planned an eight-hour strike, Transport Minister Matteo Salvini restricted it to four hours in the transportation sector. This marks Italy’s first general strike since November last year. However, unions risk penalties for involving sectors like healthcare and justice, which have already faced strikes. Italy’s railway sector, which has seen recent labor actions, was exempted from Friday’s strike. Italy’s healthcare system, particularly in the under-resourced southern regions, has been grappling with severe staffing shortages. Many healthcare workers have sought jobs abroad due to inadequate salaries, leaving existing staff to manage increased workloads. “Low wages are driving people away. We often have to work double shifts just to maintain basic care levels,” said Anna Salsa, a member of the UIL healthcare union, during a protest in Rome.

Despite starting salaries comparable to other European nations, Italy’s wage growth lags, resulting in a median annual salary of €35,000 ($37,000), one of the lowest among G7 countries, noted labor expert Maurizio Del Conte.",

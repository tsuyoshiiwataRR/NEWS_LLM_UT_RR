    "text": "Volkswagen Workers to Begin Striking Monday, Union Says\nBy Mauro Orru and Dominic Chopping\nVolkswagen employees will begin striking next week as union leaders and the German auto giant failed to agree on how to cut costs amid a slow electric-vehicle market and fierce competition, a union official said Friday.\nA spokesperson for the IG Metall union said workers would begin warning strikes on Monday, which will see their members down tools for a few hours a day. The duration of the strike will depend on how further negotiations progress, the spokesperson said.\nVolkswagen employs around 300,000 workers in Germany and operates 10 plants in the country and the industrial action set to begin Monday relates to around 120,000 employees at plants in Wolfsburg, Braunschweig, Hanover, Salzgitter, Emden and Kassel and some subsidiaries.\nA contractual obligation that prevented a strike is due to expire on Nov. 30. The latest round of talks between Volkswagen and the union ended without an agreement and negotiations are set to resume on Dec. 9.\nVolkswagen didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nVolkswagen has been at loggerheads with the IG Metall union for weeks as it seeks to implement sweeping cost cuts across its domestic business in a move to become more competitive.\nWrite to Mauro Orru at mauro.orru@wsj.com and Dominic Chopping at dominic.chopping@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nNovember 29, 2024 06:01 ET (11:01 GMT)\nCopyright (c) 2024 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nMore in Markets\nInvestors are worried about what’s next for healthcare companies under Trump.\nHealthcare Stocks Got Crushed After the Election—Is It Time to Buy?\nJobs report, Fed Beige Book, and Salesforce earnings coming up.\nWhat’s Happening in the Markets This Week\nThe PCE Price Index increased 0.2% in October.\nOctober PCE Report: PCE Inflation Index Up 2.3%, In Line With Expectations\nMore in Stocks\nSiemens and Target are among the stocks that fell into undervalued territory.\n6 New 4-Star Stocks\nSea and Spotify saw the largest valuation bumps among US-listed stocks covered by Morningstar analysts.\n10 Stocks With the Largest Fair Value Estimate Increases After Q3 Earnings\nTop funds are supplementing traditional value metrics with other strategies.",

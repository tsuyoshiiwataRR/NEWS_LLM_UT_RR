    "text": "29.11.2024 12:02 The work to determine the new minimum wage figure, which directly concerns 7 million employees and indirectly concerns the entire society, will begin in December. The Minimum Wage Determination Commission, consisting of 15 members with five representatives from workers, employers, and the government, will have TÜRK-İŞ representing the workers and the Turkish Confederation of Employer Associations (TİSK) representing the employers. The 5-member TÜRK-İŞ delegation representing the workers will be led by Deputy General President Ramazan Ağar. As in the previous year, there will be 4 workers in the TÜRK-İŞ delegation this year. Chef Selma Sayın, hairdresser Nihan Koçak, subcontractor worker Durmuş Öztürk from the highways, and press member Sezer Özseven will express the problems and demands of minimum wage earners in the Commission this year. TÜRK-İŞ General President Ergün Atalay stated that the new minimum wage figure will come into effect on January 1, 2025, and emphasized that minimum wage earners will receive their first increased salaries in February. Noting that various sectors, from IMF officials to credit rating agencies, economists to political parties, have started discussing the minimum wage figure months in advance, Atalay said that as the minimum wage is discussed, price increases for products and services have begun. Atalay expressed that the minimum wage, which is the base wage, has turned into a living wage for a large portion of workers over time, stating that the minimum wage figure affects more than 20 items, including severance pay, unemployment benefits, and General Health Insurance premiums. Atalay pointed out that the minimum wage is the largest Collective Labor Agreement (TİS) in Turkey, stating: \"Therefore, we should not only view the minimum wage as a salary. The minimum wage in 2025 should be at a level that allows the worker and their family to live decently according to the current economic and social conditions, in line with human dignity. Our colleagues will determine this figure in the coming days. This figure will be presented to the TÜRK-İŞ Board of Presidents and then shared with the public.\" Atalay added, \"It is not possible to accept the figures circulating in the public that some circles have mentioned. Those figures are not ones that will make society happy.\" Commission member Durmuş Öztürk stated that he represented workers in the Minimum Wage Determination Commission last year as well, mentioning that he has been working as a subcontractor for 11 years and receiving minimum wage. Öztürk expressed that he will be the voice of both subcontractor workers and minimum wage earners in the Commission, stating that they want a figure that will improve the living conditions of workers. Hairdresser Nihan Koçak also mentioned that she has rent for her home, saying, \"I separated from my spouse 5 years ago. I am struggling to live with my children, and I am having a hard time. We will work in the Commission with the voice of minimum wage earners.\" she said. Press member Sezer Özseven stated that he has been a journalist for three years and has an income at the minimum wage level. Expressing that it is not possible to make ends meet with the current minimum wage under today's conditions, Özseven evaluated, \"The minimum wage needs to increase as much as the expected inflation; otherwise, it does not cover the rent and food expenses of the workers.\" Chef Selma Sayın also stated, \"We want a good minimum wage figure for the improvement of living conditions.\"",

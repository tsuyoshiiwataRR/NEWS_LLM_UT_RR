    "text": "Gen Z workers are entering the workforce with high hopes and ambitions, but the transition isn't going as planned for many. A September survey published by Intelligent.com found that 60% of employers have already let go of Gen Z hires just months after they started. The reasons are piling up: lack of motivation , poor communication skills and unprofessional behavior are at the top of the list. Employers have also flagged issues like tardiness, inappropriate workplace attire and unrealistic expectations for quick promotions. Don't Miss: - Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you . - The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare ? Recruiters and hiring managers aren't just frustrated; they're rethinking whether it's worth hiring recent graduates. One in six employers say they're hesitant to bring on new grads and some companies outright avoid them in next year's hiring cycle. According to a New York Post article, the disconnect doesn't seem limited to the U.S. Recruitment expert Roxanne Calder observes similar trends in Australia, though not as severe as in America. She notes that employers are frustrated because younger hires often fail to meet the expectations tied to their starting salaries – many of which hover around $80,000 for entry-level roles. Companies are looking for employees who can \"fire\" on all cylinders immediately, but Calder says many Gen Z workers lack the technical and interpersonal skills to meet these demands.

In her experience, one of the biggest challenges is how Gen Z handles feedback. \"They find it really difficult,\" she told news.com.au, as the New York Post reported. Sometimes, Calder converses with young workers and then sends them an email asking if they have anything to add because she finds they struggle so much with face-to-face communication. This hesitancy to engage directly with managers and process constructive criticism creates a significant gap between employer expectations and employee readiness. Feedback has also become a sticking point; Calder notes that Gen Z workers often struggle to take constructive criticism, which can create friction with managers. Adding fuel to the fire , TikTok is full of Gen Z employees sharing their stories about being fired. Some blame rigid or outdated workplace cultures, while others admit they weren't prepared for the reality of their roles. Calder says, \"They want the dream career, but when the reality hits, it's hard to reconcile the two.\" Trending: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence. But the finger-pointing can't rest solely on Gen Z. HR consultant Bryan Driscoll argues that the education system shoulders some responsibility. In a Newsweek article, Driscoll drew on personal experience, stating, \"As someone who went through years of education, including law school, I can tell you this: colleges are not preparing students for real-world work.\" Companies, too, could step up by offering better onboarding and mentorship programs to set young hires up for success. Driscoll warns, \"If companies keep treating them as disposable assets, we're going to end up with a workforce that's both overworked and unprepared.\" Bridging the gap will ultimately require effort on both sides . Employers need to invest in the next generation and Gen Z workers need to adapt to the demands of the professional world. Until then, the revolving door of new hires and rapid terminations will likely keep spinning.

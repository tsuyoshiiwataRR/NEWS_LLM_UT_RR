    "text": "Amazon workers plan to stage strikes and protests in multiple countries across the Asia-Pacific region Nov. 29-Dec. 2, from Black Friday to Cyber Monday. The employees are denouncing low wages and lack of labor union representation. Organizers announced strikes and protests at Amazon facilities in the following locations: Australia: Newcastle, Sydney, Canberra, and Brisbane Bangladesh: Dhaka and Chattogram India: Multiple locations including Mumbai, New Delhi, and Kolkata Japan: Tokyo Malaysia: Kuching Philippines: Manila Additional related strikes and demonstrations are possible in other countries across the region. Gathering sites include outside Amazon offices, government buildings, public venues, and thoroughfares. Authorities will likely monitor any demonstration that occurs, dispersing any disruptive crowds. Localized transport disruptions are likely, especially if demonstrators march or block roads. Isolated scuffles between police and protestors cannot be ruled out. Associated business disruptions are possible. Avoid all demonstrations as a precaution. Plan for extra travel time near protest sites. Heed instructions from authorities.",

    "text": "Phoenix drywall company owes $1.7 million for unpaid overtime\nA Phoenix-based company has been ordered to pay $1.7 million after the U.S. Labor Department took the owner to federal court over payroll practices.\nThe local district director says Bean Drywall Incorporated tried to cover up having shorted almost 250 workers.\nThe Labor Department says that between March of 2021 and March of this year, Bean Drywall did not pay workers overtime money they had earned.\nAfter an audit, Bean Drywall agreed to pay $875,000 in back wages, says company attorney Julie Pace. Then the government imposed damages.\n“And what the Department of Labor does is they have the company pay double the amount,” said Pace.\nBean Drywall must also pay a separate civil fine and interest.\nThe company that operates in metro Phoenix, Prescott and Sedona is more than 40 years old.\n“The company takes compliance with the law seriously. And they resolved the matter and settled it so they can move forward constructively,” Pace said.",

    "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n The National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE) has appealed to the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Festus Keyamo, to intervene in the ongoing labour dispute involving Dana Air. The union is concerned about the airline’s failure to pay outstanding salaries and allowances to its former employees. In a communiqué issued following its recent National Executive Council meeting and symposium in Abuja, NAAPE President, Abednego Galadima urged all employers in the aviation sector, including the government and airlines, to prioritise the well-being of their workers. He emphasised the vital role of aviation in the nation’s economy and the need for improved working conditions. Dana Air was grounded by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) in April due to safety concerns. Subsequently, the airline laid off over 1,000 employees, including permanent staff and expatriates. Reports indicate that many of these former employees have yet to receive their pensions, despite deductions being made, dating back to the tragic 2012 crash. Additionally, the airline has been unable to refund ticket costs to numerous passengers, leaving them in a state of uncertainty. Addressing the issue during the NAAPE conference, Galadima expressed deep concern over the unpaid salaries and allowances owed to Dana Air’s staff since April. He called on the Aviation Minister to take immediate action to resolve the situation. Galadima stated, “Given the economic realities and the critical role of aviation in our nation’s economy, NEC appeals to all employers, including the government and airlines, to provide better working conditions for their employees. We urge the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development to intervene and ensure that Dana Air promptly settles all outstanding salaries, allowances, and financial obligations owed to its employees from April 2024. We also advocate for the inclusion of the union’s national organs in the ongoing review of the Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau’s Conditions of Service, in alignment with international best practices and collective bargaining principles.”",

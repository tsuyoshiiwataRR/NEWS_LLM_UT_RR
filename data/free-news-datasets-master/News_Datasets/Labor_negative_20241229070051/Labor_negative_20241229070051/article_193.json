    "text": "SEOUL, Nov 29 (Bernama-Yonhap) -- The No 3 labour union of Seoul Metro, the operator of subway lines 1-8 in South Korean capital, Seoul, threatened Friday to stage a full-scale strike next week in demand of better pay and new staff hiring, Yonhap news agency reported.\nThe union, made up mostly of employees in their 20s and 30s, announced the plan during a press conference in front of City Hall, raising concerns of simultaneous strikes by two of the company's three labour unions, including the No. 1 union that represents 60 per cent of the work force.\nBoth strikes are set to take place next Friday.\nOther unionised workers have also threatened collective action in recent days, including those of KTX and regular train operator Korea Railroad Corp (KORAIL), who plan to launch an indefinite strike next Thursday.\nSome members of the Cargo Truckers Solidarity, the National Pension Service, and Korea Gas Corp, have also said they are preparing to walk out.\n-- BERNAMA-YONHAP\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial",

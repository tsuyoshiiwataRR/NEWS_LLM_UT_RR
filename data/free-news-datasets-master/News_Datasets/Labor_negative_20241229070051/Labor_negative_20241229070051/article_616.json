    "text": "By Apoorv Rastogi ,\n2 hours ago\nPhoto Credit: Marcos del Mazo | LightRocket via Getty Images In a concerning turn of events, Amazon will be experiencing a workers strike on a global scale in the build-up to the holiday season. The display of resistance will take place between Black Friday and Cyber Monday across numerous nations. But what has caused the Amazon workforce to resort to such means to put their points forward?\nHere’s everything you need to know regarding the upcoming Amazon workers strike.\nAmazon workers plan a strike between Black Friday and Cyber Monday The organizers leading the charge confirmed their plan to showcase their disapproval of the Jeff Bezos-owned company’s way of handling their employees by announcing a worldwide demonstration on Thursday.\nAccording to UNI Global Union’s General Secretary Christy Hoffman, the workers seek to address the labor “abuses, environmental degradation, and threats to democracy” supposedly inflicted by Amazon through their strike.\n“No matter how much they spend to fight us, corporations like Amazon cannot break the power of workers standing together,” Hoffman conveyed in a statement to FOX Business . “Make Amazon Pay Day is a powerful testament to our unity and momentum. No company — no matter how wealthy — can silence the cause of workers demanding justice,” she added.\nAccording to the organizers, Amazon workers across the US, the UK, France, Germany, Japan, Brazil, India, and Turkey will participate in the premeditated strikes. They will also receive assistance from other worker-focused unions like the anti-poverty and garment worker rights groups, per the UNI Global Union.\nIn response to the workers strike, Amazon’s Eileen Hards has called out the organizers for pursuing a “false narrative.” Explaining the organization’s work culture, Hards stated, “The fact is, at Amazon, we provide great pay, great benefits, and great opportunities — all from day one. We’ve created more than 1.5 million jobs around the world and counting, and we provide a modern, safe, and engaging workplace whether you work in an office or at one of our operations buildings.”\nThis forthcoming strike would be the fifth attempt made by the workers in as many years against Amazon prior to the commencement of the holiday shopping season. Nevertheless, it remains unclear as to how many employees will be taking part in the said protest.\nThe post Amazon Workers To Go On a Strike Between Black Friday & Cyber Monday appeared first on ComingSoon.net - Movie Trailers, TV & Streaming News, and More .",

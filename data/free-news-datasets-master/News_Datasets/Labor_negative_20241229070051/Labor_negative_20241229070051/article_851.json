    "text": "The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists, and Dentists Union (KMPDU) has threatened to down tools beginning in December should the government fail to disburse the remaining funds owed to them.\nKMPDU Secretary General Davji Atellah, who spoke during the union’s delegates conference held in Nairobi on Saturday, November 30, said the Ksh965 million disbursed by the government today was inadequate to pay all the intern doctors.\nWhile expressing the union’s frustration with the government, Atellah noted that the [KMPDU would not agree to talks](https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/106869-clinical-officers-threaten-strike-over-shif-rollout-issue-three-week-notice) with the government until it agreed to disburse the remaining amount.\nAccording to the union leaders, the government’s decision to disburse Ksh965 million for arrears payment and November salary meant that each intern doctor would only receive Ksh40,000, stating that the funds were less than the agreed amount.\n“The Ministry of Health has released a notice that violates the tents of the Collective Bargain Agreement (CBA), it has released a letter that makes every doctor afraid to go to work,” Atellah said.\n“We are deliberating, we have had a discussion for the last three hours to see how we are going on strike. That shall be a big strike, and you can take my word to the banks,” he added.\nAddressing journalists after the meeting, KMPDU Deputy Secretary General Dennis Miskellah revealed that some of the intern doctors were yet to receive their monthly pay despite the government’s announcement that it had disbursed the funds.\nMiskellah went ahead to take a swipe at Health Cabinet Secretary Deborah Barasa for allegedly lying to the medical fraternity and the country as a whole through her early-morning presser.\n“The health minister wakes up early and does a press conference lying to Kenyans that the government has released money and paid interns. We are disappointed that they do not have that money in the account,” Miskellah claimed.\nKMPDU's stance comes hours after CS Deborah Barasa announced that the [government has already disbursed Ksh965 million ](https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/106876-ministry-health-announces-payment-salaries-arrears-intern-health-workers)to pay all intern doctors across the country.\nSpeaking to members of the press on Saturday morning, Barasa said the move marked a significant milestone in the government's commitment to supporting healthcare professionals at the foundation of their careers.\n“Internship programs are a critical component of Kenya's healthcare system, providing hands-on experience to bridge the gap between theory and practice,” CS Barasa stated.\n“By ensuring timely remuneration, the Ministry affirms its commitment to fostering a conducive environment for professional growth, thereby enhancing the quality of care delivered to Kenyans,” she added.",

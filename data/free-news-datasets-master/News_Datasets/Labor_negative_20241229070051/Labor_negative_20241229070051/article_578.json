    "text": "Dollar crisis and lack of infrastructure are the main obstacles that stand in the way of the shipbreaking industry in Bangladesh now, said Bangladesh Ship Breakers and Recyclers Association (BSBRA) Vice President Zahirul Islam Rinku today (29 November). \"Although our sector has made some improvements, the ongoing global slowdown and the dollar crisis have created hurdles. Also, the narrow and dilapidated roads leading to the yards hinder our ability to meet international standards,\" he said while briefing three advisers of the interim. Industrial Adviser Adilur Rahman Khan, Land Adviser Advocate Hasan Arif, and Industries Secretary Zakia Sultana visited the Arab Ship Recycling Yard at Sonaishari with a view to assessing the shipbreaking industry's challenges and exploring its growth potential. \"The industry contributes $100 million annually through exports of various metals and components, boosting several local sectors including steel, rerolling, shipbuilding, aluminium, and furniture,\" Zahirul said. Industries Secretary Zakia Sultana acknowledged the need for stronger regulations, stating, \"Although rules have been made, a law for the shipbreaking industry is essential. The government will consider long-term funding if a formal request is made.\" She also mentioned that discussions have already taken place regarding the development of connecting roads, with plans to involve LGED or CDAK in the project. Additionally, she confirmed that a study is underway for the construction of the treatment, storage and disposal facility (TSDF) at Mirsarai Industrial City, with JICA funding. After the briefing, the delegation visited the yard to witness the ongoing development activities firsthand.",

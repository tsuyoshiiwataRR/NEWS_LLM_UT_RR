    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta — Canadian union Unifor will vote on a potential strike against CPKC, saying negotiations with the railroad have reached an impasse.\nThe union’s 101R, which represents approximately 1,200 CPKC employees nationwide in mechanical trades, said in[ a Friday, Nov. 29, announcement](https://www.unifor.org/news/all-news/unifor-hold-strike-votes-following-impasse-cpkc-negotiations) that it would hold the strike vote “in the coming weeks.” The move came after the most recent round of talks Nov. 26-29, and with the end of the government-sponsored mediation and conciliation period ending on Jan. 28, 2025.\n“CPKC’s unwillingness to address the key concerns of our members is unacceptable,” Unifor National President Lana Payne said in a statement. “Our members deserve a contract that respects their contributions and ensures fair and equitable working conditions.”\nThe union and railroad began negotiations in early October, with Unifor filing for conciliation on Oct. 29 [see [“Canadian union files …,”](https://www.trains.com/trn/news-reviews/news-wire/canadian-union-files-for-conciliation-with-cpkc/) Trains News Wire, Oct. 30, 2024]. Unifor is also currently involved in negotiations with Canadian National Railway and VIA Rail Canada; the announced earlier this week that members have voted in favor of a strike against CN if a new contract agreement is not reached by Jan. 1, 2025 [see [“Unifor members authorize strike …,”](https://www.trains.com/trn/news-reviews/news-wire/unifor-members-authorize-strike-against-canadian-national/) Trains News Wire, Nov. 25, 2024].",

    "text": "As Amazon’s Black Friday sales kick off, the e-commerce giant faces a wave of global strikes, protests, and calls for boycotts. Workers, supported by unions and activist organisations, are mobilising under the slogan “Make Amazon Pay” to demand fair treatment and accountability from the multinational corporation.\nThe coordinated campaign, running from November 29 to December 2, is led by the UNI Global Union and Progressive International, representing millions of workers and allies worldwide. Protesters are highlighting Amazon’s labour practices, environmental impact, and alleged complicity in human rights violations.\n“In New Delhi hundreds of Amazon workers will rally to demand fair treatment considering Amazon mistreatment of workers during a massive heatwave last July summer,” said the UNI Global Union press note.\nThousands of Amazon employees in Germany, garment workers in Bangladesh, and union members in India have joined the protests. The Amazon India Workers Union, backed by the UNI Global Union, shared an image of its preparations for the protest.\nMicrosoft fires employees who organised vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza “The stage is set… Workers, activists, and allies are coming together to demand fair wages, safe working conditions, and accountability from Amazon. Today, voices for justice and dignity will rise!” the union declared on the platform X.\nThe stage is set at Jantar Mantar for the #MakeAmazonPay protest. Workers, activists, and allies are coming together to demand fair wages, safe working conditions, and accountability from Amazon. Today, voices for justice and dignity will rise! @uniapro @uniglobalunion pic.twitter.com/7QJvou1u6D\n— Amazon India Workers Union (@AiwaInd) November 29, 2024",

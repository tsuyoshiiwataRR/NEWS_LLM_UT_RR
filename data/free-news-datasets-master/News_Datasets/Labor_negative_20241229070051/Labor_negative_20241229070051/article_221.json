    "text": "By Sydney Jaxtheimer Juan Cisneros ,\n16 hours ago\n( WFXR ) – Amazon workers across 20 countries, including the United States, are striking against what the organizing labor union calls anti-worker and anti-democratic practices.\nThis is the fifth year UNI Global Union has spearheaded the “Make Amazon Pay” movement with the aim to hold Amazon accountable for “labor abuses, environmental degradation and threats to democracy.”\n“Bezos’s company has spent untold millions to stop workers from organizing, but the strikes and protests happening around the world show that workers’ desire for justice – for union representation – can’t be stopped,” Christy Hoffman, General Secretary of UNI Global Union, said. “We stand united in demanding that Amazon treat its workers fairly, respect fundamental rights, and stop undermining the systems meant to protect us all.”\nHow to handle politics at the Thanksgiving table Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards said the group is misleading and promotes a false narrative.\n“The fact is at Amazon we provide great pay, great benefits, and great opportunities—all from day one. We’ve created more than 1.5 million jobs around the world, and counting, and we provide a modern, safe, and engaging workplace whether you work in an office or at one of our operations buildings,” Hards said.\nAccording to UNI, demonstrations are expected in major cities in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and Brazil.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

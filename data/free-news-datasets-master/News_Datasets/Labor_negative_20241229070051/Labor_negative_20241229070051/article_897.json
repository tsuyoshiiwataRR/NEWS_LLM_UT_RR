    "text": "このページを\n日本語 で読む\nLabor shortages are worsening due to declining births and an aging population. Meanwhile, companies are increasingly looking to retired athletes as a potential talent pool for corporate roles.\nData shows that more than 80% of professional athletes retire from competition by the age of 30. The same is true of those aspiring to become professionals. While some stay involved in sports after retirement, many choose corporate careers as a practical next step. Many companies are eager to leverage this pool of talent.\nRetired athletes often face criticism for lacking general knowledge. This is because their singular focus on sports during their years as active athletes limits the development of other skill sets. Building robust support systems will likely be key to ensuring their success as valuable corporate contributors.\nMaking the Connections\nIn September, the Mitsubishi Research Institute (MRI), a think tank, and the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry held an event in Osaka. It was their first attempt to connect active and retired professional athletes seeking employment with general businesses. Eleven athletes, including baseball players dressed in uniforms and jerseys, participated. They listened attentively to company representatives' presentations, their nervousness apparent.\nAdditionally, the event sought to address the uncertainty many athletes feel about their post-retirement careers while also helping companies tackle labor shortages. Nine organizations participated, including Daiwa House Group, Tsuruya Golf (Osaka), and several small and medium-sized enterprises from the Osaka region.\nFollowing an introduction to their operations and hiring practices, the companies conducted interviews. These interviews allowed athletes to present the skills they developed through sports. Participating companies expressed optimism about hiring athletes. Qualities such as \"perseverance and competitiveness honed through sports\" and their suitability for sales roles strongly appealed to the companies.\nFocusing on New Skill Sets\nHowever, some athletes voiced concerns after speaking with hiring managers. They feared they \"might be rejected due to a lack of academic qualifications,\" even if they applied to a company.\nFueled by the enthusiasm of companies eager to secure talent, the event was an overall success. Some companies indicated they were considering hiring athletes. Nonetheless, there were critical assessments of the athletes' readiness for corporate roles. One organizer noted, \"These athletes certainly do lack business skills. Despite the companies enthusiastically explaining their points, hardly anyone was taking notes.\"\nMRI's Athlete FLAP Support\nLast spring, MRI launched the Athlete FLAP Support Service, designed to help athletes transition into corporate roles. The service registers both current and former athletes, along with companies and municipalities interested in hiring them.\nMRI identified \"the separation of vocational education and athletic training as a key challenge\" and developed programs to bridge this gap. Its programs include self-analysis and career development training essential for job hunting. Those steps are followed by matching athletes with potential employers.\nMRI's Athlete FLAP initiative reflects its vision for career autonomy and is built around four key steps:\n- Identifying personal traits, strengths, and suitable career paths.\n- Acquiring the skills and knowledge necessary to achieve career goals.\n- Taking decisive steps toward employment.\n- Succeeding in a new phase of life.\nAs an MRI representative explained, this four-step process is crucial for athletes. Through this initiative, they will learn to translate their sports-honed abilities into the job market and thrive beyond their athletic careers.\nUnlocking Athletes' Potential\nThe think tank identified several challenges that led to the launch of its Athlete FLAP Support Service. Labor shortages and mismatches between workforce supply and demand were among the issues. Additionally, the lack of diversity in corporate talent contributed to a shortage of innovation. MRI's representative highlighted athletes as a largely untapped resource. While many possess strong business skills, their opportunities to excel in the corporate sector remain limited.\nIn August, the Osaka-based IT company Raxus conducted a survey. Its survey targeted men and women aged 20 to 50 who had become, or aspired to become, professional athletes after finishing school. Results showed that 85.1% of athletes retired from competition between the ages of 20 and 30.\nMoreover, 80% of respondents reported engaging in job hunting after retiring. When asked about their post-retirement career concerns, common responses included, \"Can I even find a job?\" Another frequent worry was, \"Will I discover something I can dedicate myself to with the same passion I had for my sport?\"\nFurthermore, the survey also noted a tradition in the sports world. Coaches and managers often assist retiring athletes by introducing them to companies or job opportunities.\nRaxus' survey further examined the skills athletes believed could be applied to business settings after retirement. \"A strong desire to achieve goals\" was the skill they most frequently cited (35.6%). \"Perseverance\" (32.1%) and \"interpersonal communication\" (30.4%) were the second and third most cited.\nAre Companies Willing to Invest?\nThe OCCI has long championed \"industry development centered around sports\" through its flagship initiative, Sports Hub KANSAI. OCCI's program connects athletes and sports teams with companies to foster product development and create new business opportunities. Building on this foundation, the OCCI has partnered with the MRI to expand the initiative further.\nShingo Torii, Chairman of OCCI and Vice Chairman of Suntory Holdings, praised the unique qualities athletes bring to the table. \"People who excel in sports or other specialized fields possess something exceptional,\" he stated.\nTorii also stressed the importance of businesses and the broader economic community actively tapping into this talent pool. \"From the perspective of workforce mobility, it's only natural for companies to welcome athletes,\" he added.\nHowever, Yuichiro Takigawa, from the Kansai Branch Information Department of Tokyo Shoko Research, pointed out key challenges. \"Many athletes have little to no practical work experience,\" he explained. \"Training them from scratch requires both manpower and capital. Companies will need to demonstrate a willingness to invest upfront and have the resources to support such efforts.\"\nDespite these challenges, Mitsuo Fujiyama, Director of the Kansai Economic Research Center at the Japan Research Institute, expressed optimism. \"A lot of professional sports teams are deeply rooted in their local communities,\" he noted. \"If athletes from these teams can build second careers with local companies, it could drive regional revitalization.\"\nRELATED:\nWhy Japan's Mass Recruitment of New Graduates Needs to ChangeEDITORIAL | Japan's Record-Low Fertility Rate Needs Decisive Intervention\nAuthor: Kohei Inoue\nこのページを\n日本語 で読む",

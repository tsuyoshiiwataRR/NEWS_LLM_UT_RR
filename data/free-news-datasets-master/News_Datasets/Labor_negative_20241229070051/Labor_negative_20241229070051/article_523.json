    "text": "Just 30 of 140 currently staff at Great British Nuclear (GBN) are employed on permanent contracts, it has been revealed.\nGBN is the government body running the competition for selecting SMRs to receive taxpayer support for deployment. However, its responsibilities in the wider UK nuclear picture are unclear and [criticism has been made about how it interfaces with Great British Energy](https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/gb-energy-and-gb-nuclear-criticised-for-lack-of-collaboration-as-clarity-sought-on-wylfa-01-11-2024/).\nGBN staff\nGBN chair Simon Bowen was asked by House of Commons Energy Security and Net Zero select committee chair Bill Esterson on 20 November 2024 about the proportion of permanent staff at GBN.\nBowen said: “The headcount currently runs at about 140, 30 of which are permanent employees.”\nExplaining why only roughly one-in-five (21%) of the staff are permanent, he added: “It took us many, many months to get a pay agreement through the various government processes, understandably, which really slowed down our recruitment, but we're now starting to accelerate and to bring people into the organisation.”\nHe went on to highlight the diversity statistics of the workforce at GBN.\n“We have 45% female [staff]. We've got a better ethnic mix than we've got across the UK. We've got a very diverse workforce which we're proud of, and we are on with recruiting the rest of the staff.”\nGBN, according to its LinkedIn profile, is currently recruiting for five roles.\nThe roles are ‘land, property & facilities management lead’ (£68,300/year), ‘head of ethics, ABC compliance and freedom of information (FOI)’ (£85,300/year), ‘management accountant’ (£57,300/year), ‘business, planning and performance lead’ (£68,200/year), and ‘commercial lead’ (£85,400/year).\nGBN and the SMR competition\nGBN announced it had started [“detailed negotiations” with the four small modular reactor (SMR) developers remaining in its competition for deployment in the UK](https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/great-british-nuclear-starts-negotiations-with-smr-companies-for-uk-deployment-12-11-2024/) earlier in November 2024.\nGE-Hitachi, Holtec Britain, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Co. were announced as the companies in contention following the conclusion of the initial tender stage at the end of September. NuScale dropped out at this point, while EDF exited the competition in July when it failed to submit documents before the deadline.\nGBN said it has completed two rounds of assessment with the four shortlisted companies and is now entering negotiations ahead of the submission of final tenders.\nFinal decisions about the winning firm or firms will be taken in spring 2025.\nIn October, GBN [revealed its commercial pipeline has £890M-£1.1bn worth of work up for grabs and implied its small modular reactor (SMR) competition plans to appoint two suppliers](https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/1-1bn-of-works-included-in-great-british-nuclears-smr-project-pipeline-29-10-2024/).\nLike what you've read?

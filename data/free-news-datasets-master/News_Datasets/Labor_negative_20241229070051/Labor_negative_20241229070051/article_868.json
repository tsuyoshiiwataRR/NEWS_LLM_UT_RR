    "text": "Amid the controversy around the implementation of the N70,000 minimum wage in the Federal Capital Territory, the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) has declared an indefinite strike. The NLC directed all workers in the federal capital territory and across the six area councils of the FCT to embark on indefinite strike action from December, 1, 2024, over non-implementation of the N70,000 national minimum wage arrears. The NLC noted that despite the the six area council chairmen being issued a communique of the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the NLC held in Port Harcourt, River State on November 11, 2024, they failed to comply with the demand for a N70,000 minimum wage. According to the chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in the FCT while addressing journalists in Abuja, Comrade Stephen Knabayi, the six area council members have failed to implement the wage. “The SEC (state executive council) also noted with deep frustration and persistent delay and outright refusal by the six area council chairmen to pay some pending entitlements to the workers including the outstanding arrears of the primary school teachers in their respective area councils.” “Therefore, all the workers in the six area councils of the FCT are hereby issued a matching order without hesitation to proceed on an indefinite strike action begining from first December, 1, 2024, until further directives are issued,” the NLC chairman said. There have been controversies over the implementation of the newly approved minimum wage, while some states have promised to start implementation by December 1st, others have failed to make concrete commitments per the NLC.

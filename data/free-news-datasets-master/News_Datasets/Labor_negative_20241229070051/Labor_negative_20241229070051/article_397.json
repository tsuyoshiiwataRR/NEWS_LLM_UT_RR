    "text": "29 Nov 2024 | 01:09 PM UTC\nEurope: Amazon workers to stage strikes, protests in multiple countries Nov. 29-Dec. 2\nAmazon workers to stage strikes and protests in European countries, Nov. 29-Dec. 2. Increased security likely; traffic disruptions possible.\nAmazon workers will stage strikes and protests in multiple European countries from Nov. 29 to Dec. 2. The employees are denouncing low pay and lack of labor union representation on \"Black Friday\" and \"Cyber Monday,\" which fall on Nov. 29 and Dec. 2, respectively. Local and regional labor unions and activist groups, including UNI Global Union and Progressive International, support the action. While most actions will feature dozens to hundreds of activists, gatherings in some major cities, including London, UK, and Berlin, Germany, could feature thousands of participants. Protests are likely outside Amazon offices, warehouses, and distribution centers.\nLocal authorities will likely deploy increased security to all protest sites. Localized road travel disruptions are possible in affected areas. Violence is not anticipated. Logistics disruptions are likely for deliveries of Amazon products.\nAvoid the demonstrations as a routine security precaution and to mitigate associated disruptions. Heed instructions from authorities. Check for disruptions and allow extra time to reach destinations.",

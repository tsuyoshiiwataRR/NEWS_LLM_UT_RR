    "text": "29 Nov 2024 | 09:24 PM UTC\nSouth Korea: Unionized transport, education, and public sector workers to launch coordinated nationwide strike Dec. 2\nWorkers affiliated with several labor unions to strike across South Korea starting Dec. 2. Public transport, business disruptions likely.\nWorkers affiliated represented by several labor unions, particularly in the transport, education, and public services sectors, plan to launch a series of coordinated strikes in South Korea on Dec. 2. The Cargo Truckers Solidarity, an affiliate of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU), will hold a three-day strike from Dec. 2. Additionally, Korea Railroad (KORAIL) employees represented by the Korean Railway Workers' Union (KRWU) will stage an indefinite work stoppage starting Dec. 5, with workers employed by Seoul Metro walking off the job starting Dec. 6. Certain unionized public service employees, including those at the National Pension Service and Korea Gas in the South Korean capital, will also participate in a walkout, as will education workers affiliated with the KCTU. The purpose of the labor action is to demand improved working conditions and condemn alleged workplace discrimination, among other things. Unless averted, the labor action will likely prompt significant transport and business disruptions.\nIncreased demand for alternative modes of transportation is likely. Organizers may suspend or cancel the labor action at short notice if they perceive that authorities may give in to some of their demands.\nAlthough there were no immediate announcements for such gatherings, related demonstrations of varying types are possible. Potential gathering sites include the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport building and Seoul Metro facilities, as well as other government buildings, public squares, and thoroughfares. Authorities will likely monitor any demonstrations that materialize and may disperse overly unruly crowds. Isolated minor skirmishes between strike participants and police cannot be ruled out.\nPlan accordingly for likely disruptions to rail services nationwide and metro services in Seoul during the strike. Schedule alternative modes of transportation as necessary. Confirm business appointments in advance. Consider alternate arrangements for freights shipped by truck starting Dec. 2. As a precaution, avoid any demonstration that materializes. Depart the area at the first sign of any security disturbance. Heed all official transport and security advisories.",

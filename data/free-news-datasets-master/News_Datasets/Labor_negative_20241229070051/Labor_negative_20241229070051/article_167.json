    "text": "Hundreds of Victorian police officers have walked off the job from police headquarters as tensions over pay disputes deepen.It's the biggest stop-work action held by the force this year, as the Fair Work Commission is forced to decide how to handle to crisis. \"You are the heartbeat of Victoria Police and today that heartbeat stops,\" Victoria Police Association chief executive Wayne Gatt said. Up to 1000 officers walked off the job for an hour at Victoria Police headquarters as the pay dispute between members and the Government continues to sour. \"Thirty years of this job is bloody exhausting, Detective Sergeant Justin Polwarth said. \"How taxing it is on the body, on your knees, back, soul and spirit.\" In total, 17 protests have been staged by members over the past fortnight. Today police turned out in the greatest force despite dwindling numbers. \"We have over 800 members who can't be here today because they're off work. Off work!\" Polwarth said. New South Wales police just received pay rises of between 20 and 39 per cent - the largest in decades. \"If your commissioner and your government are not going to respect you, other states will and they'll pay you more to go north,\" Police Federation Australia Chief Executive Scott Weber said. Victoria's Police Association is demanding a 24 per cent pay rise over four years and eight-and-a-half hour shifts which would give officers an extra fourteen days off a year. The union rejected a 16 per cent offer in July fighting to bring the government back to the negotiating table. For the time being it's out of the government's hands. The Fair Work Commission is hearing evidence from both parties. By the end of the year, a decision will be made as to whether it needs to step in and solve the crisis.",

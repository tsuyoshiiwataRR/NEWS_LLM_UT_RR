    "text": "KARACHI: University teachers across Sindh will observe a ‘black day’ on Dec 2 in protest against the provincial government’s decision of contractual appointments on campuses.\nThis was announced in a joint statement released by representatives of Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Association (Fapuasa), Sindh chapter, and Karachi University Teachers’ Society (Kuts) on Thursday at after holding a meeting at Karachi University (KU).\nThe teachers warned that if the government didn’t take notice of their concerns over contractual appointments, they might decide to boycott classes from the next academic session.\n“We condemn contractual appointments. It’s a violation of the autonomous status of universities that would open doors for political intervention in their affairs,” says the statement.\nIt criticises Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah’s decision to ban appointments, pointing out that the selection boards allow universities to make appointments.\n“Unlike other public sector institutions, universities have an appointment system of their own, governed by their codes under which teachers start their careers as lecturers and are promoted to higher posts through a selection board held at each promotion and appointment.\n“It’s unfortunate that while the 18the Constitutional Amendment granted provincial autonomy, the Sindh government is moving towards centralisation and the decisions of universities’ statutory bodies are also being approved by the chief minister. It seems that the provincial government wants to run universities like local bodies.”\nThe attendees of the meeting included Prof Akhtiar Ali Ghumro, Dr Abdur Rehman Nangraj, Dr Mohsin Ali and Dr Asif Hussain Samoo, among others.\nPublished in Dawn, November 29th, 2024",

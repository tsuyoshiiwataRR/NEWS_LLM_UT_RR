    "text": "A US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) judge has determined Exxon Mobil’s 10-month lockout of 600 union workers at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery was lawful.\nThe lockout took place during a 2021-2022 [contract](https://www.whatjobs.com/jobs/contract) dispute. It was deemed a legitimate tactic to pressure the United Steelworkers (USW) union workers toward a deal rather than an effort to dissolve the union.\nthe Decision\n- Legal Pressure, Not Union-Busting: Judge Jeffrey Wedekind concluded there was insufficient evidence to support the union’s claim Exxon’s lockout aimed to pressure workers to decertify the union.\n- Union’s Allegations: The USW alleged Exxon’s actions constituted unfair labor practices. It sought millions of dollars in compensation for lost wages and benefits during the lockout.\n- Excluded Evidence: Internal Exxon documents suggesting early discussions about workforce changes and potential decertification were excluded from consideration.\nThe documents indicated Exxon[managers](https://www.whatjobs.com/jobs/managers)had weighed the benefits of a lockout and anticipated workforce changes that could impact future labor negotiations.\nNeed Career Advice? [Get employment skills advice at all levels of your career](https://www.whatjobs.com/info/career-advice/?utm_medium=npost&utm_source=whatnews&utm_campaign=internallinks)\nthe Lockout\n- Duration: The lockout lasted from May 2021 to March 2022 at Exxon’s 369,024 barrel-per-day Beaumont refinery complex.\n- Impact on Workforce: Approximately 20 percent of the workers initially locked out left the\n[company](https://www.whatjobs.com/jobs/company)before a settlement was reached. Many replacements had previously worked as contractors during the lockout. - Union’s Claims: The USW argued that Exxon’s actions were part of a broader strategy to weaken the union’s influence over the long term.\nLooking for a job? Visit [whatjobs.com](http://www.whatjobs.com/) today\nUnion’s Response and Next Steps\nMeekie Moseley, [president](https://www.whatjobs.com/jobs/president) of USW Local 13-243, expressed disappointment with the ruling, saying:\n“We believe the decision does not reflect the facts of the case.”\nThe USW is considering appealing the decision to the full NLRB.\nInternal Documents and Strategic Discussions\nDocuments viewed during the hearings included:\n- Comments from plant managers suggesting the lockout would benefit Exxon’s labor strategy.\n- A statement from a former plant manager proposing splitting contracts for the\n[refinery](https://www.whatjobs.com/jobs/refinery)and lube oil plant in 2027, potentially leading to decertification of the union.\nHiring?

It highlights the complex dynamics of labor relations in the energy sector.\nWhile Exxon’s strategy has been validated in this case, the decision underscores ongoing tensions between corporations and labor unions in high-stakes negotiations.",

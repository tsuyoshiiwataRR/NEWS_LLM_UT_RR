    "text": "Electricity and Gas Workers to Strike Over Pay A strike affecting companies across the electricity and gas sector is planned for December 5th as unions demand higher salary increases. The inter-union, comprised of the CGT, CFE-CGC, CFDT, and FO, announced the strike action amid ongoing salary negotiations.\nNegotiations Stall as Unions Reject Initial Offer Initial salary proposals from EDF management, a key player in the sector, have been deemed insufficient by the unions. “Following the opening session of negotiations on 2025 salary measures, the first proposal from EDF management is a low rate of 1.5%,” detailed the inter-union in a leaflet. They are urging management to “return to negotiations by proposing much more to meet the 2.3% claimed on individual measures.”\nThe inter-union’s call for a strike aims to pressure employers into offering more substantial wage increases.\nThey’ve termed the initial offer “not up to standard” and emphasize the need for an agreement that addresses the rising cost of living and ensures fair compensation for workers.\nWidespread Impact Expected as Strike Targets Entire Sector The planned strike goes beyond EDF, encompassing Enedis and all other companies throughout the electricity and gas sector. “The strike will target all companies in the sector,” confirmed a representative from the CGT unions of EDF and GRDF, emphasizing their commitment to a sector-wide response.\nDecember 5th was chosen strategically to coincide with a scheduled meeting of the energy industry body to negotiate other issues. The timing is intended to maximize the impact of the strike and draw attention to the unions’ demands. Additionally, public sector strikes are also planned for the same day, with demands on purchasing power that are “nearly identical” to those of the energy sector workers.\nLimited Public Disruption Expected, But Companies Facing Losses While the strike is expected to have minimal impact on the general public, it’s anticipated to result in significant financial losses for companies in the sector. The impact on productivity and operations during the strike is likely to be felt, especially considering that the call for strike officially begins the day before at 9 p.m., covering nighttime shifts as is traditional in the energy sector.\n“This day of strike should not have too visible consequences for the public,” predicted a union representative. “But it will above all result in a loss of earnings for companies.” The representative cautioned that the intensity and duration of the strike could escalate based on “the result” of negotiations and employers’ reactions,” adding that the inter-union will reconvene on the evening of December 5th to assess the situation and decide on further action.\nWhat potential⁣ disruptions to services‌ are anticipated if the strike proceeds ⁤on December 5th? ## Interview Transcript: Electricity and Gas Workers‍ Prepare to Strike\n**Host:** Joining us ‍today ⁢to discuss the upcoming strike in the electricity and gas sector⁤ is [Guest Name], a representative from the inter-union. Welcome⁣ to the show.\n**[Guest Name]:** Thank‌ you for having me.\n**Host:** Could you explain the reason behind this strike action planned for December 5th?\n**[Guest Name]:** Absolutely. Our ‍members – the hardworking individuals ‌who keep the lights on​ and the gas⁢ flowing ⁣– are demanding fair compensation in line with the rising cost of ‍living. While ‍EDF management has proposed a 1.5% salary increase, we believe this falls far short of what’s⁢ needed. We’re aiming for a 2.3% increase to​ genuinely address ⁢the economic pressures our members are facing. [[(none)]]\n**Host:** ⁢ ‌You ⁣mentioned⁤ that the initial offer was deemed insufficient. ⁤Why‍ are unions pushing for such a ‌significant increase compared to the⁣ suggested 1.5%?\n** [Guest Name]:** The current economic climate is incredibly challenging. Everything from groceries to housing costs have gone up ​significantly. We’re asking for a wage increase that reflects this reality and allows ‍our members to ⁢maintain a decent standard of living. [[(none)]]\n**Host:** What ​impact do​ you anticipate this strike having on consumers and businesses?\n**[Guest Name]:** We understand ⁣that a strike may cause some inconvenience, but​ we urge the public to⁣ understand that our fight is ultimately about ensuring the well-being‌ of the people who power this essential ⁤industry. We hope that ⁣EDF⁤ management ⁣will return to the negotiating table with⁢ a more responsible offer to ‌avoid ‌any⁤ disruption to‌ services. [[(none)]]\n**Host:** Thank you for providing insight⁣ into the ‍situation, [Guest Name]. We hope for⁣ a ⁢swift ​and fair resolution to these negotiations.",

    "text": "Over one million migrant workers have left Russia in 2024, mainly citizens of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Despite efforts to increase wages, these measures have failed to stem the exodus, experts said. Andrey Kladov, Director of Russia’s “Migrant-Service” platform and a recruitment specialist, revealed the striking statistics, stating , “It is evident that foreign workers are leaving. Between January and September, nearly one million people exited the country.” Kladov emphasized the challenges posed by the labor shortage, noting that there are now ten job openings for every migrant worker in Russia. Even with wage increases, the departures continue. “At the start of 2024, foreign workers in production sectors earned an average of 105,000 rubles per month, which increased to 150,000 rubles by the summer, particularly in roles such as construction and courier services,” Kladov explained. State Duma Deputy Svetlana Bessarab addressed the potential economic implications, asserting that illegal migrants contribute little to Russia's economy. “The departure of undocumented workers will not have severe consequences. No one has prohibited labor migration; anyone willing to work here legally is welcome. Employers can now hire ordinary migrants through a clear and transparent process,” Bessarab said. The deputy highlighted that illegal workers often dominate the shadow economy, which undermines economic benefits and creates challenges for law enforcement and public safety. Contrary to speculation, Bessarab clarified that Russia has not introduced new requirements for labor migrants. Instead, existing standards have been reinforced to ensure better compliance and regulation.

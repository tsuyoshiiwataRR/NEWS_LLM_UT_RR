    "text": "University and College Union employees set to walk out in protest over restructure plans\nEmployees of the University and College Union have announced three days of strikes next month over a planned restructure.\nUCU employees who are members of the Unite union are due to walk out for three continuous days from 9 December.\nUnite has been in dispute with the UCU since April , citing concerns about “workplace racism, repeated breaches of their collective agreements and broken industrial relations”. In an online post last week , Unite added that a new UCU consultation on staffing changes would affect nearly one in four staff, adding to its concerns.\n“This rushed restructure is another sign of a dysfunctional and chaotic employer,” Unite said on 26 November , in a post confirming it had served strike notice on the UCU.\nUnite is due to hold a special general meeting on 5 December, four days before the planned walkout. It said that negotiations will continue, and that strike action could be avoided if concessions are made.\nA spokesperson for the UCU told Research Professional News that the restructure “comes in response to listening to recommendations from staff and members, and is focused upon growth and better service provision to our members”.\n“There are no redundancies or job cuts, and five new posts have been created,” the spokesperson said, adding that 14 of the UCU’s 216 employees will see “very limited revisions proposed to their job descriptions, a change which affects 6.5 per cent of UCU staff”.\n“UCU is proud to offer some of the best pay and conditions in the movement,” the spokesperson said.",

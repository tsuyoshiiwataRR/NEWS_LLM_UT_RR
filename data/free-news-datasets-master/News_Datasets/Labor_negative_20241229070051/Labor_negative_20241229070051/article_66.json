    "text": "More than half of Amazon workers are forced to borrow money due to low pay The Amazon logo on packaging × This is the last article you can read this month You can read more article this month You can read more articles this month Sorry your limit is up for this month Reset on:\nPlease help support the Morning Star by subscribing here MORE than half of Amazon workers are forced to borrow money to subsidise their low pay, a report by GMB reveals today.\nThe study forms part of the union’s formal pay claim to the multinational, calling on Amazon to deliver a £17 minimum wage for staff in Britain.\nThe survey of hundreds of Amazon workers found low pay was causing 15 per cent of Amazon workers in Britain to use foodbanks.\nOf those surveyed, 53 per cent said they were having to borrow money to keep up with the cost of living while 78 per cent said they were struggling to keep up with day-to-day expenses.\nThe news comes as Amazon workers across the world, including the US, Germany, Turkey, Canada, India, Japan and Brazil, stage a day of action to mark the company’s Black Friday deals.\nProtests are expected outside the company’s headquarters in Bishopsgate, London, today.\nGMB senior organiser Amanda Gearing said the findings “should be a wake-up call for decision makers.”\nShe said: “Despite all the attempts to paint Amazon as force for good, the company’s reputation is on the floor over its treatment of workers.\n“It’s a scandal that 15 per cent of Amazon workers — around 12,000 people — are reporting being forced to use foodbanks to make ends meet.\n“Amazon are one of the world’s wealthiest corporations, it’s not right that their UK staff are being forced to endure this.\n“That’s why we’ve launched our call for £17 an hour at Amazon this Black Friday.”\nAn Amazon spokesman said: “Amazon’s front-line employees in the UK receive a minimum starting salary of between £28,000 and £30,000 — that’s an increase of at least 35 per cent over the last two years.\n“Our employees work a four day week with flexible working options and excellent career opportunities — all within a modern, safe and engaging work environment.”",

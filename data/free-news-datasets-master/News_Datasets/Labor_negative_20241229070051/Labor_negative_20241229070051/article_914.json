Occupations Open to Yemeni Workers:\nThe Ministry reaffirms that Yemenis are permitted to work in other essential sectors, including:\nAgriculture and Livestock: Roles such as sheep herders, livestock breeders, and other agricultural specialists are open to Yemenis.\nConstruction: Yemeni workers are still eligible for positions within the construction industry, including painters, blacksmiths, carpenters, and other skilled trades.\nHigher Education : Yemenis can continue to work in higher education institutions and universities, contributing to various teaching and specialized roles.\nHandicrafts and Services: Yemeni nationals can find employment in fields such as janitorial services, kitchen assistance, sales, jewelry making, as well as other essential service sectors.\nInformation Technology: The Ministry encourages Yemeni workers to pursue opportunities in the ever-evolving field of information technology.\nHealthcare (Specialized Roles): While certain healthcare professions are restricted, Yemeni individuals can still pursue specialized roles within the medical sector.\nThe Saudi Arabian government maintains\nthat these new regulations are aimed at ensuring equitable employment opportunities for its citizens and balancing the needs of its diverse workforce.\nPlease note: This is a reimagined news article created specifically for a U.S. audience.

Dr. Layla Ahmed, a leading expert on migration and labor rights in​ the Middle ‍East, joins us today to discuss the implications of these policies. Welcome, Dr.‌ Ahmed.\n**Dr. Ahmed:** Thank you for ⁢having me.\n**World Today News:** ‍Could you briefly⁢ summarize the key changes in these​ new regulations?\n**Dr.‍ Ahmed:** The new ⁢regulations primarily affect Yemeni workers by ⁣reducing the⁤ number of⁢ sectors they can work in, while introducing stricter visa⁤ requirements and tightening border controls. Essentially, ‍these policies aim to limit the influx of Yemeni‍ laborers into Saudi Arabia.\n**World Today news:** Why has Saudi ⁤Arabia implemented these changes? What ‍are the ‍stated justifications?\n**Dr.Ahmed:** The Saudi government claims these ‍measures are necessary to address concerns about unemployment amongst ‍Saudi citizens and ‍to regulate the large influx of foreign labor, notably given the ongoing economic challenges in the region.\n**World Today News:** Critics ‌argue that these ⁤policies specifically target Yemeni workers due to the ongoing conflict in Yemen ‍and the desperation of its people. What is your take on this?\n**Dr. Ahmed:** There’s undoubtedly a geopolitical​ element to ⁣these regulations. Yemeni migrants are particularly vulnerable ⁤due ⁣to the​ war’s devastation​ and thier urgent‍ need for ⁢work and safety.​ The timing and targeted nature of these‌ policies raise ⁤serious concerns about their motivations. While Saudi Arabia claims to prioritize its citizens’ employment,‍ these policies arguably exploit the vulnerability of Yemeni⁤ workers.\n**World Today News:** ⁣What are the potential consequences​ of these regulations on Yemeni laborers and their families?\n**Dr. ‍Ahmed:** The impact will be devastating.‌ Many ​Yemenis rely on‌ remittances from relatives ⁢working in⁤ Saudi Arabia to survive. These stricter regulations will cut ⁣off crucial lifelines for families struggling amidst ‌the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, ⁣exacerbating poverty and instability.\n**World Today News:** What are‍ the ‌implications for the region as a whole? Will other Gulf‌ countries follow suit?\n**Dr. ⁣Ahmed:** These policies⁣ could ​have ⁤a ⁢domino effect, with other Gulf states​ potentially adopting similar restrictions on migrant labor from Yemen, further jeopardizing regional ⁢stability and humanitarian efforts.This highlights ⁤the need for a coordinated international response to ensure⁢ the protection of vulnerable migrants and uphold their basic rights.\n**World Today News:**‍ What recommendations would ⁢you offer to‍ international organizations and governments regarding this situation?\n**dr. Ahmed:** The international community must pressure Saudi Arabia to revise these discriminatory policies‍ and ensure they adhere to international labor standards. Furthermore,supporting humanitarian efforts in Yemen and promoting lasting economic growth in the⁢ region are vital steps to address the root causes of this crisis.\n**World ​Today News:** Dr. Ahmed, thank you for your insightful​ analysis.This a‍ crucial issue that demands continued attention and ‍action.",

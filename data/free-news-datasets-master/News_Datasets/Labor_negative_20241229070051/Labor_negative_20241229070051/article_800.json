    "text": "Hearst Magazines, the publisher of Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping and Esquire, has fired around 200 employees — most of whom work at the company’s iconic headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.\nThe Writers Guild of America East (WGAE), the union which represents thousands of media professionals, told the news site W42ST that the total number of layoffs amounted to 197 people — 67 of whom were members of the Hearst Union bargaining unit.\nThe union also told W42ST that “most affected workers are based at Hearst Tower” on 8th Avenue and 57th Street on Manhattan’s West Side.\nHearst Tower, which rises nearly 600 feet and 46 stories high, is a Norman Foster-designed triangular glass skyscraper known for its sleek, environmentally friendly layout.\nThe tower was constructed in 2006 atop the original Hearst Magazine Building, whose facade was designated as a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1988.\nDebi Chirichella, the president of the company, circulated a memo to employees announcing the layoffs last week.\n“After a thorough review of our business, we’ve decided to reallocate resources to better support our goals and continue our focus on digital innovation while strengthening our best in class print products,” Chirichella wrote in the memo, which was reported by The Hollywood Reporter.",

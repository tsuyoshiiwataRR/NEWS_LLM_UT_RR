    "text": "Members of the No. 3 labor union of Seoul Metro hold a rally demanding better pay and welfare near City Hall in Seoul, Nov. 20. Yonhap\nThe No. 3 labor union of Seoul Metro, the operator of subway lines 1-8, threatened Friday to stage a full-scale strike next week in demand of better pay and new staff hiring.\nThe union, made up mostly of employees in their 20s and 30s, announced the plan during a press conference in front of City Hall, raising concerns of simultaneous strikes by two of the company's three labor unions, including the No. 1 union that represents 60 percent of the work force.\nBoth strikes are set to take place next Friday.\nOther unionized workers have also threatened collective action in recent days, including those of KTX and regular train operator Korea Railroad Corp. (KORAIL), who plan to launch an indefinite strike next Thursday.\nSome members of the Cargo Truckers Solidarity, the National Pension Service and Korea Gas Corp. have also said they are preparing to walk out.

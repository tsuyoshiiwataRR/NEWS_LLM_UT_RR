    "text": "City, intercity and state‌ bus drivers⁢ will continue their general ⁤strike across Spain on Thursday⁣ and friday, November⁣ 28 and 29⁤ to demand⁤ early retirement in the ⁣sector, with minimum services set⁤ at 50% at state level.\nAccording to ‍the​ resolution on minimum services‍ of​ the Ministry of Transport and Urban Mobility, 50% of currently authorized shipments will have to be carried out. If it is indeed a route consisting of a single⁣ shipment, it will‍ be carried out in its entirety.\nMajor companies providing long-distance ⁣bus services​ will contact ticket‌ holders whose service has⁣ had to‌ be suspended,offering them ⁣a free exchange.\nThis is the second​ day of a total of seven⁢ days‍ announced, after the one that took⁣ place on October 28th. ⁣It was also scheduled for November‌ 11th but was canceled due​ to the effects of DANA.\nOn this‌ occasion it is supported by the CCOO, which represent over ⁣40% of the sector, and ⁣by the ‌CGT, after UGT and ‍SLT withdrew from the ​tender after having signed a commitment with ‌the employers’‌ associations Confebús, Anetra and Atuc to ‍ask for the early retirement to​ administrations once a royal ⁢decree comes into force.\nFor CCOO this commitment ‌is not enough,since the date has been tied to the approval of that royal decree,presumably in February,but ⁤it could be later. The⁤ union ‍also claims that in the rest of the transport sectors, such as road​ haulage, the commitment was ⁢to request it within 20 days.\nMinimum self-reliant services Autonomous ​communities and city councils have also established​ minimum services in‌ their respective regions. For example, in Catalonia they will‍ be ⁣40% ​during peak hours and 20% during⁢ the rest, ‍while in Madrid intercity buses will carry out 80% of their services ⁢during peak ⁣hours and 45% during off-peak ⁣hours.\nLikewise, ​in Cantabria they​ will​ be 30%, in Navarra 40% and in ⁣Gran Canaria 50%. As for⁤ the cities, for example in ‌Palma it will be 50%, in‍ Pamplona ‌60% during peak ‍hours and 40% during off-peak hours, and‌ in Mérida 50%.\nAfter this Thursday ​and⁤ Friday, the strike will resume on December 5 and 9, and ⁤from ‌December 23 indefinitely if an agreement⁢ between unions and employers is not reached ⁢first.\nHow could the bus ⁣driver strike affect public ⁢transportation in Spain in ‌the long term? Interview: Understanding the ongoing Bus driver Strike in Spain\nTime.news Editor: Today, we have the‍ pleasure of speaking wiht Dr. Laura Martínez, a⁤ transport policy expert, to‍ shed light on the current strike by city, intercity, and state bus drivers in Spain. Thank you for ‍joining us, Dr.Martínez.\nDr.⁤ Laura Martínez: ⁤ thank you for having me. Its crucial to discuss these critical developments in the⁢ transport‌ sector.\nEditor: The bus drivers are striking on November 28 ‌and 29, demanding early retirement. can you explain why this strike is happening now and the importance of these demands?\nDr. Martínez: Certainly. This strike is actually⁤ part ‍of a broader ongoing movement, with a ⁣total of seven strike‌ days announced. The bus drivers,⁢ represented mainly ⁤by CCOO, are pushing for early retirement due to the demanding nature of their work and to ensure a more sustainable workforce in the long term. This demand is particularly poignant as they believe previous agreements with ⁢employers weren’t sufficient and wanted a firm timeline for action against​ this issue.\nEditor: You mentioned the companies’ commitment to provide minimum‌ services; can you elaborate on what that means for ‌commuters?\nDr. Martínez: Under the Ministry of ⁣Transport ​and Urban Mobility’s regulations, a minimum of 50% of authorized bus services ‍must still operate at ⁢the state level during the strike. However, we see variations ⁣in ⁣minimum services across regions—like 40% during peak ​hours in catalonia, for example. This means that while the strike will impact service availability, some buses will still be running, although commuters should expect longer wait times and reduced options.\neditor: What should passengers know​ if their bus service ⁢is affected?\nDr. Martínez: Passengers should keep an eye on​ communications from​ their bus service providers. Major companies have committed to contacting ticket holders whose services are suspended and ⁢will offer ​free exchanges for alternative ‍travel. Thus, it’s vital for commuters to stay informed and consider flexible travel options during this⁤ period of disruption.\nEditor: The situation seems tense with ​ongoing negotiations. What are the implications if an agreement isn’t reached soon?\nDr. Martínez: If the⁢ unions and employers⁤ cannot come to a satisfactory agreement, ​the strike could escalate, with services⁢ likely ceasing indefinitely from December 23. This would ⁢severely disrupt transportation for many who rely on these services daily. The situation highlights the⁤ urgent need for meaningful dialog and rapid policy responses from the government to address the labor concerns in the ⁢transport sector.\nEditor: Could this strike have⁤ ripple effects ⁣on ⁤the broader transport industry in Spain?\nDr.Martínez: Absolutely. Strikes in essential services like⁢ public transport frequently enough have a domino effect, impacting not just commuters but also local economies that depend on reliable transport. Additionally,if the calls for early retirement are met,we‌ could see shifts in workforce dynamics across the entire transport sector,including increased pressure on governmental agencies to outline retirement‍ policies.\nEditor: Considering these developments, what practical advice can you give‌ to commuters ⁤in Spain during this strike?\nDr. Martínez: Commuters ⁣should plan their travel in advance and consider alternate routes or⁤ modes of transport. It’s also beneficial to check real-time updates from service providers and remain adaptable as schedules ⁤could change frequently. Most importantly, staying engaged with ‍the news surrounding the strike will help commuters make informed decisions.\nEditor: Thank you, Dr. Martínez,for your insights into this pressing issue.The bus driver strike not only affects daily⁤ commuters but​ also raises significant questions about labor rights and transportation policy in ‌Spain.\nDr. Martínez: Thank you for having me. It’s essential to keep discussing these issues as they evolve.",

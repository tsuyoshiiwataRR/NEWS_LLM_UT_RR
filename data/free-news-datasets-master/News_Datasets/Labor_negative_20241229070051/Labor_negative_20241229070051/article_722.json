    "text": "More than 55,000 Canada Post workers have been on strike for two weeks and now some are temporarily losing their jobs.\nOn Monday, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) said in a bulletin to members that Canada Post has temporarily laid off postal employees as the strike approaches its third week and into Black Friday weekend- one of the busiest online shopping events of the year.\nThe union is calling the layoffs a “scare tactic” as the two parties fail to come to an agreement.\nRead More\nBargaining talks between Canada Post and CUPW are suspended, strike continues On Wednesday, striking workers organized a rally at the mail facility in Scarborough, Ont.\n“Canada Post management talks about the urgency of reaching a deal while they still sit in their offices or at home collecting their six figure salaries and bonuses,” the CUPW wrote in a statement on Nov. 27.\nCanada Post spokesperson Lisa Lui said that the Crown corporation has had to make adjustments to their operations during the national labour disruption, in a statement to CBC News.\nWhile the Canada Labour Code states that employers are forbidden from laying off striking workers, Lui says that the collective agreements are no longer in effect and the employment conditions of Canada Post workers have now changed as a result of the strike.\nOn Monday, Canada Post said it was down nearly 11 million parcels since the strike began.\n“The impacts continue to be felt across the country, hitting small businesses, charities and remote communities the most,” Liu said in a statement.\nAs the strike continues to delay mail deliveries ahead of the holidays, Canadians express where they stand online.\n“While I am annoyed that I can’t send mail right now, let me be very clear, I do not for one second blame Canada Post workers or their union. This is on @canadapostcorp for trying to be shady, greedy, exploitative, unethical & unfair,” one person wrote on X.\nAnother said, “Everyone saying we don’t need Canada Post obviously doesn’t live in a rural area that couriers don’t come to.”\nWhile one person on X added some light to the situation: “If this Canada Post strike ends my 36 year streak of getting a letter response from Santa, I’m going to absolutely snap.”\nEarlier this week, bargaining talks between the union and corporation were suspended as no productive agreements were being made.",

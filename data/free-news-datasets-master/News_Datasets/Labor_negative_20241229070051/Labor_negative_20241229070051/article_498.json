    "text": "AILSA CRAIG - A prolonged dispute at Craigwood Youth Services in Ailsa Craig has escalated, with workers and union representatives highlighting deep concerns about low wages, inadequate safety equipment, and mismanagement. The fallout has left the facility empty of youth inmates and struggling to maintain operations. Front-line workers represented by OPSEU/SEFPO Local 166 have voiced frustrations over stagnant wages and increasing responsibilities. Jonathan Guider, a member of the local union and a worker at the Ailsa Craig facility for 24 years, described the disparity between transfer-payment facilities like Craigwood and their counterparts operated directly by the ministry. “We do the exact jobs, except at Craigwood, I have to wear many more hats,” Guider said. He explained that workers juggle tasks such as cooking, cleaning, medication management, and counselling—all for a starting wage of approximately $19 an hour. In comparison, according to Guider, employees at direct-operated facilities earn upwards of $43 an hour with superior benefits and safety standards.",

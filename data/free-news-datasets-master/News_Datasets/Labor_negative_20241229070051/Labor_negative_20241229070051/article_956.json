    "text": "WOLFSBURG (dpa-AFX) - IG Metall is calling for widespread warning strikes at Volkswagen this Monday. \"Warning strikes will begin at all plants on Monday,\" announced Thorsten Groger, head of the IG Metall district in Lower Saxony. He did not initially give any details.\nThe peace obligation, during which strikes are not permitted, expired at midnight. IG Metall has already announced that it will call for temporary work stoppages at all sites from the beginning of December, but has not yet given any specific dates.\nThe dispute concerns the pay of the 120,000 or so employees at Volkswagen AG plants, where a separate company wage agreement applies. VW has so far rejected any increase and is instead demanding a ten percent pay cut due to the Group's difficult situation. Plant closures and compulsory redundancies are also on the table. Both sides will meet for their next round of collective bargaining on December 9.\nThe last time there were warning strikes at individual sites at VW was in the 2021 in-house collective bargaining round. The last time there was widespread action at all six major plants in western Germany was in 2018. According to IG Metall, more than 50,000 employees took part at that time./fjo/DP/mis\nShare Go to the original article .\nLegal disclaimer Legal disclaimer\nContact us to request a correction\nBack Â© dpa-AFX - 2024",

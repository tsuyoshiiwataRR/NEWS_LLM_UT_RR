    "text": "Less than a week after the vote for the renewal of the unitary union representatives and for the safety of the environmental hygiene sector, the RAP has not yet provided the commission with the lists of those entitled to vote nor the electoral material, such as the lists presented by the trade unions . This was reported by , Uiltrasporti Fp Cgil Palermo and Fiadel, calling into question the most important and largest company in Sicily, Rap, a subsidiary company that manages the waste collection and sweeping service. The elections will take place on 3 and 4 December, the only date at national level for the renewal of trade union representatives in the sector.\n“The electoral commission was formed over a month ago, in compliance with the rules and timing and, despite countless requests and even a legal warning, the company did not deliver the essential electoral material to be able to carry out the elections – they say Andrea Gattuso, general secretary of Fp Cgil Palermo, Raffaele Montuoro, regional secretary of Uiltrasporti and Giuseppe Badagliacca, general secretary of Fiadel Sicilia -. Electoral material which, however, the RAP sent exclusively to a Commission convened beforehand by a person appointed by Fit-Cisl, without title, as it lacked the necessary requirement of being the oldest member. A circumstance that cannot be denied.”\nFP Cgil, Uiltrasporti and Fiadel immediately contested the legitimacy of this Commission, convened in total conflict with the rules of the electoral regulations that all the trade union organizations signatory to the Ccnl, without exception, shared at a national level. The three organizations also invited the “disputed” Commission to participate jointly but to no avail. “We consider Rap’s attitude to be serious – add Gattuso, Montuoro and Badagliacca -. In our opinion, the company did not behave impartially and thirdly on this matter, not transmitting the electoral material and consequently not recognizing the legitimately established electoral commission and instead choosing to regulate the one convened by the member appointed by Fit Cisl”.\nA “vexatious” attitude in contrast with what is happening elsewhere: throughout Italy and even in some Environmental Hygiene construction sites in the province of Palermo, trade union organizations and employer companies are, instead, adhering to the rules set out in the electoral regulations of 6 September 2024 and the procedures are moving forward with the utmost serenity and collaboration.\n“This situation – continues the complaint from the trade union organizations – is objectively preventing FP Cgil, Uiltrasporti and Fiadel-Cisal from being able to allow their candidates to participate in the elections for the RSU and Rlssa in the most important company in the hygiene sector environment of Palermo and Sicily. We firmly believe in democracy in the workplace and have promoted representation elections at all levels. We do not understand how the Fit-Cisl candidates can carry out the elections next week, competing only with an autonomous acronym, under the control and management of a commission, convened by those who had no qualifications, in a climate of absolute uncertainty and confusion on the part of part of the workers”.\nIf no concrete acts are received from the company to restore democracy and legitimacy, Fp Cgil Palermo, Uiltrasporti and Fiadel will undertake all appropriate legal action “in order to guarantee both the right of each trade union organization to nominate its own candidates and that of the workers to be able to legitimately vote for them.”",

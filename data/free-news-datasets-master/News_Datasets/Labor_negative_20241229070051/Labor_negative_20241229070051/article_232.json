    "text": "In response to rising risks of accidents as the scale and scope of industrial activities increases to meet the demands of the energy transition, governments from across the pan-European region have decided to strengthen cooperation to ensure safety by expanding work under the UNECE Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents (Industrial Accidents Convention), which holds its thirteenth meeting of the [Conference of the Parties](https://unece.org/info/Environmental-Policy/Industrial-Accidents/events/389754) this week in Geneva.\nDecarbonization brings safety risks\nA dedicated [report](https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2024-11/ECECP.TEIA20242_E.pdf) and [seminar](https://unece.org/environmental-policy/events/unece-seminar-global-energy-transition-strengthening-industrial-safety) highlighted that the massive scaling-up in production, storage, use and distribution of renewables (e.g. solar and wind), ammonia, hydrogen and battery energy storage systems is expected to create additional accident risks and require further control measures and greater awareness among policymakers, operators and the public.\nExperts under the Convention warn that a key area of risk is the huge quantities of critical minerals (e.g. cobalt, lithium and nickel) that will be required over the next decades to produce renewable energy and battery technology. This will require strengthened safety measures throughout minerals' lifecycles - in mining, processing, refining and storage (including for mining waste, or \"tailings\") and in technology production facilities.\nThe deployment of Carbon Capture, Use and Storage (CCUS) and measures to decarbonize and electrify energy-intensive industrial facilities can also pose significant risks to people and the environment without safe management by regulators and operators. Experts further warn that research and innovation are bringing new technologies with unknown hazards and risks that must be duly considered.\nUNECE Executive Secretary Tatiana Molcean highlighted that \"the Industrial Accidents Convention has a vital role to play - as an international legally binding instrument that covers many hazardous substances and processes used in the energy transition, and beyond that, as a forum which fosters multilateralism.\"\nFresh data reveals safety gaps\nA UNECE [survey](https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2024-09/Item%203_ECE.CP_.TEIA_.INF2_ISET%20Survey%20Results.pdf) of 22 countries (21 out of the Convention's [42 Parties](https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVII-6&chapter=27&clang=_en), in addition to Uzbekistan) from across the region highlighted that:\n-\nThree quarters of Parties are only moderately prepared (71%) or even unprepared (4%) for prevention. Rating their accident preparedness, 68% were moderately prepared and 4% unprepared.\n-\nLess than one quarter of responses (22%) rated their country's industrial safety infrastructure and current knowledge in dealing with energy transition challenges as advanced or state-of-the-art. Almost two thirds (64%) opted for adequate, while 14% rated it as inadequate.\n-\nRenewable sources (96%) and hydrogen (75%) topped the list of energy sources used for the transition. For renewables, the current regulatory and policy framework to ensure industrial safety was considered to be very effective in only 39% of responses, compared to 25% for hydrogen - a rate similar to other substances like methanol (36%), ammonia (29%). These relatively low safety ratings in key areas for the energy transition render them \"hotspots\" for further policy consideration and regulatory improvement.\n-\nPrimary concerns reflected are regulatory catch-up with emerging technologies and innovation (68%) and lack of basis for hazard and risk assessment (57%). Lack of expertise (64%), lack of knowledge (46%) and lack of hazard/risk assessment basic documents (36%) were identified as the biggest challenges in managing risks associated with new energy technologies.\n-\n89% of responses confirmed the need for international collaboration in framing industrial safety regulations for the energy transition.\nThese findings underscore the importance of the Industrial Accidents Convention in facilitating cooperation and for the further development of standards, technical guidelines and exchange of good practices to support action worldwide, in addition to dedicated training and workshops. The discussions highlighted the Convention as a flexible instrument capable of addressing new and emerging risks.\nThese new insights further confirm the relevance of [United Nations regulations and standards](https://unece.org/transport/dangerous-goods) for the safe transport, handling and storage of hazardous substances, such as the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals and the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods. UNECE normative and policy support in the energy sector in areas including [hydrogen classification](https://unece.org/climate-change/press/unece-develop-international-hydrogen-classification-system), [resource management](https://unece.org/sustainable-energy/sustainable-resource-management) - including for mining, recycling and CCUS - also make an important contribution to the safe and sustainable management of energy transition projects.\nAccidents show need to redouble safety measures\nExamples of accidents from over the last decade show the need to strengthen prevention, preparedness and response, particularly given the projected rise in related industrial activities.\n-\nIn 2024, explosions and a fire at a lithium battery factory in Hwaseong, Republic of Korea resulted in the deaths of over 20 workers. In 2023, an explosion of oxygen tanks and a fire at a nickel plant in South Sulawesi, Indonesia, killed 18 and injured over 40 workers.\n-\nIn 2024, an explosion and fire at a critical mineral recovery/lithium-ion battery recycling plant in Fredericktown, USA, resulted in a call for locals to take shelter and concerns for air and water contamination.\n-\nIn 2023, fires broke out at a lithium-ion battery energy storage facilities in Saucats, Gironde, France, and in Gothenburg, Sweden, exposing workers to dangerous fumes and damaging the facility. In 2023, a hydrogen tank exploded in Lebring Styria, Austria, injuring a worker and causing massive damage.\n-\nIn 2019, thermal runaway of a lithium-ion battery energy storage system in Surprise, Arizona, USA, led to dangerous air pollution, workers and firefighters injured and an explosion.\n-\nSince 2015, 14 of the 39 major tailings dam failures worldwide have spawned from facilities extracting or processing critical minerals (e.g. Ujina copper-molybdenum in Chile, Cobriza copper mine Peru, Tedikardes zinc-copper mine in TÃ¼rkiye, San Jose de Los Manzanos zinc mine in Mexico and Tieli molybdenum mine in China, among others), with many resulting in widespread water pollution and biodiversity loss.\n-\nIn 2014, a tailings pond breach in Mount Polley, Canada, led to the release of millions of cubic metres of water and tailings sludge containing arsenic, lead and heavy metals, impacting water quality, food, fish habitats and the health and traditional practices of Indigenous Peoples in the surrounding area.\nWith accelerated decarbonization measures urgently needed worldwide, environmental, health and industrial risks cannot be sidelined and must be urgently addressed during this pivotal timeframe for climate action.\n[here](/states-boost-efforts-on-industrial-accident-1368052/).",

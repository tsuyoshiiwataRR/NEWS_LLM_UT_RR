    "text": "Amazon workers in more than 20 countries, including the U.S., plan to strike during the busy pre-Christmas shopping days between Black Friday and Cyber Monday to \"make Amazon pay,\" strike organizers said Thursday. The \"days of resistance\" aim to \"hold Amazon accountable for [labor] abuses, environmental degradation and threats to democracy,\" according to organizers UNI Global Union and Progressive International. \"No matter how much they spend to fight us, corporations like Amazon cannot break the power of workers standing together,\" UNI Global Union’s General Secretary Christy Hoffman said in a statement shared with FOX Business. \"In Germany, ver.di has led the charge for over a decade, demanding collective bargaining rights — a fight that resonates across the globe. From India to the United States, the U.K. to Canada, workers are rising against exploitation and corporate intimidation. ‘Make Amazon Pay Day’ is a powerful testament to our unity and momentum. No company — no matter how wealthy — can silence the cause of workers demanding justice.\" AMAZON INVESTS $4B IN AI STARTUP RIVAL OPENAI Protesters hold a \"Make Amazon Pay\" banner during a demonstration in Berlin on Black Friday in 2022.

The striking workers will be supported by various unions, anti-poverty and garment worker rights groups and others, according to UNI Global Union. Amazon, in a statement to FOX Business, accused the organizers of being \"intentionally misleading\" and promoting a \"false narrative.\" A worker pulls a pallet at an Amazon fulfillment center in Swansea, Wales.

Specifically, in New Delhi, India, UNI Global Union said that hundreds of Amazon workers will \"rally to demand fair treatment considering Amazon&apos;s mistreatment of workers during a massive heatwave last July summer.\" An Amazon warehouse in Haydock, England.

    "text": "The internal feud over the party's bulletin board has been ongoing for three weeks, but it shows no signs of smooth completion.\nChoo Kyung-ho, floor leader of the People's Power Party, sent a message to lawmakers to have a cooling-off period, but remarks are still spreading controversy centered on outside personnel. Concerns have grown that the ruling party's single confrontation may be broken ahead of the re-voting of the National Assembly's plenary session of the Special Prosecutor's Act on Kim Gun-hee, scheduled for December 10.\nOn the 29th, Rep. Cho Jung-hoon of the People's Power Party (non-limit) directly hit a radio program, saying, \"If you are worried about connecting the controversy over the bulletin board of the party to the special prosecutor of the first lady Kim, it is not the head of the ruling party, but the head of the opposition party.\" \"No matter how much infighting there is in the party, we cannot agree to the law on the collapse of the regime, which gives up being the ruling party,\" he stressed. In particular, he criticized Han Dong-hoon, head of the People's Power, saying, \"This is an OX quiz, but it keeps sublimating it into a higher-order equation.\"\nKim Jae-won, a member of the People's Power Supreme Council, who is classified as a pro-Yoon Seok-yeolgye (pro-Yoon-gye), also said on the radio, \"This problem can be solved in two hours within the party, but the party leader and the secretary-general do not seem willing to solve it,\" adding, \"If the article is not related to Han's representative or family, it does not constitute the term of dragging down the party leader (by using it as an excuse.\"\nFloor leader Choo, who issued a restraining order to both factions at a closed general meeting of lawmakers the previous day, warned, \"The party officials should also be careful about their words and actions. If it goes too far, we will take appropriate measures.\" However, Han Chin-dong-hoon-gye (Chin Han-limang) said, \"Although floor leader Choo said to have a cooling system, the other side continues to create controversy, so we shouldn't just stay still.\"\nHan did not make any clear comments on reporters' questions about the party's bulletin board on the same day. Asked if his position that he should go to the special prosecutor's office as a single agent remains unchanged, representative Han replied, \"It's a repeated question, but I'll replace it with what I said a few days ago.\" When asked, \"Some observers say they will not actively crack down on votes,\" he answered vaguely, \"I will not talk about the issue now.\"\nEven in close circles, Kim's special prosecution law has been opposed, saying it is \"opening the door to impeachment.\" However, since the 28th, the atmosphere has been subtly changing. Even if they are not necessarily close, there are so-called \"Shai Han Dong-hoon\" lawmakers out of 108 lawmakers (Rep. Jeong Seong-guk), suggesting the possibility of more than eight in favor of the independent counsel law. If the opposition parties all agree, if the ruling party votes more than eight times, the first lady's independent counsel law will be re-determined and the president's veto will be nullified. At the time of the second re-decision last time, four votes were cast in favor of the ruling party.\nKim Jong-hyuk, a member of the People's Power Supreme Council, said, \"(The disturbance of the party bulletin board) is unlikely to affect,\" adding, \"The pro-Yoon group and those who were in the presidential office are participating in the war and attacking.\" CEO Han Dong-hoon also said, \"I have no choice but to think that the so-called Kim Ok-gyun project is working.\" The \"Kim Ok-gyun Project\" is a word that symbolizes some pro-Yoon-gye operations to oust Han.\nJang Ye-chan, a former member of the People's Power Supreme Council, warned in a Facebook post that \"passing the special prosecution is to bring the regime to representative Lee Jae-myung,\" adding, \"It is different from forming an angle with the president, and it will forever be branded as a betrayal of the entire conservative camp.\"\nMeanwhile, People's Power filed a complaint with the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency against YouTuber Lee, who first sparked controversy over the party's bulletin board, for defamation. Joo Jin-woo, chairman of the People's Power Legal Advisory Committee, said, \"Although it was clearly stated that extreme expressions such as 'suicide' and 'dog collar' were written by a third party member unrelated to the party leader or family, the party leader spread false information that he wrote himself,\" adding, \"Only 907 of the 530,000 party bulletin boards were written under the name of Han Dong-hoon's family, and all the public opinion team and comment team were false.\"\n[Reporter Choi Hee-seok]",

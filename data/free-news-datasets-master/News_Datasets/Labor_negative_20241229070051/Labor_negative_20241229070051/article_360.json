    "text": "Due to a strike by educational staff, all canteens in the city of Strasbourg will be closed on Thursday December 5. Some teachers are also likely to strike.\nAll Strasbourg school canteens will be closed this Thursday, December 5 due to a strike by educational staff. Morning and evening after-school care for mothers as well as educational workshops will be provided “to the extent possible”, specifies the city of Strasbourg in a press release this Thursday, November 28.\nParents will not be charged for meals for the day, who will have to arrange to pick up their children at noon and at the end of classes at 4:30 p.m.\nSix schools chosen for minimum reception service A minimum reception service will be organized in schools “as long as at least 25% of the teachers in the establishment are on strike”. Six schools in the city have been designated to welcome the students concerned from 8:30 a.m. to noon and from 2 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.\nChildren attending school in the Hautepierre-Cronanbourg districts whose teacher is on strike will in this case be welcomed at the Catherine nursery school . L’ Schluthfeld primary school will welcome students from the Neudorf and Port du Rhin districts.\nChildren from the Robertsau-Esplanade and Conseil des XV neighborhoods will go to the leisure reception Schwilgué and those in the city center, train station and Krutenau neighborhoods Sainte-Madeleine nursery school .\nFinally, schoolchildren from Elsau, Montagne verte, Kœnigshoffen and Poteries will be welcomed at the nursery school Gliesberg and the children of Meinau and Neuhof will go to Guynemer school .\nA call to demonstrate at 2 p.m. THE unions call for strike in order to ask the Minister of the Civil Service Guillaume Kasbarian to waive the three-day waiting period, the reduction in compensation for days of sick leave or the non-payment of the Gipa compensation (Individual guarantee of the power of purchase).\nThe inter-union is also calling for an overhaul of the index scales, additional budgetary resources, job creation and, among other things, the pure and simple abandonment of the guidelines of the so-called “Guerini” bill.\nIn Strasbourg, educational staff are invited to demonstrate from the Place de la Bourse on Thursday December 5 at 2 p.m. The procession will then reach Place de la République.",

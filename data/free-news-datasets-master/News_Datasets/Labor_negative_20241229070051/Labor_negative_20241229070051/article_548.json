    "text": "51% vote 'no' to four percent pay offer\nNursing staff on the Isle of Man have rejected a pay offer from Manx Care.\nThe Royal College of Nursing surveyed its members between 14 and 28 November.\nYou can find out more [HERE](https://www.manxradio.com/news/isle-of-man-news/rcn-members-consulted-over-new-pay-offer/).\nMore than half of those who voted chose to discount the four percent offer which would have seen staff currently employed receive the uplift for the current year as well as back pay to 1 April.\nSenior Officer David Hopton said: “Our members are clearly upset with the level of pay increase they’ve been offered.\n“We’re hearing they’re not feeling valued for the job they do and this result demonstrates this.\n“Our members deserve to receive the level of pay that reflects their skill set and to ensure continued delivery of safe and effective patient care.”\nThe RCN says its previously written to Manx Care about the fact members who have left the health body since April would not receive the additional four percent backpay.\nThe union says this matter remains unresolved at this time.\nMr Hopton continued: “This pay offer should have been agreed before April so these staff were paid at the agreed rate.\n“It is something the RCN will continue to speak with Manx Care about as we know some of our members are unhappy that their fellow colleagues should miss out, even in retrospect.”\nThe RCN says it has shared the results of the ballot with Manx Care and the result will be considered by the Isle of Man branch and the North West Board.",

    "text": "SEOUL, Dec. 1 (Korea Bizwire) – In response to a proposal by the Seoul Metropolitan Government to allow foreign workers on E-9 non-professional employment visas to drive village buses, the Ministry of Employment and Labor announced it cannot accommodate the request under current regulations, citing safety and legal concerns. The ministry suggested the matter be addressed as a long-term issue rather than an immediate policy change. Seoul’s proposal, submitted in October as part of regulatory reforms, sought to expand the scope of E-9 visas —currently issued for industries like manufacturing, agriculture, and livestock—to include transportation. The ministry, however, emphasized that current immigration laws require specific qualifications for professional roles, which excludes E-9 visa holders from being employed as bus drivers. “Bus drivers must hold a commercial driver’s license and complete at least one year of driving experience to qualify for a bus operation license,” a ministry official explained. “Granting E-9 visas for this purpose would require amending existing laws, and there are additional challenges in recognizing foreign driving licenses, given differences in road systems and traffic regulations across countries.” Safety and communication concerns were also raised. The ministry stressed that bus driving involves public interaction and directly impacts passenger safety, requiring a high level of language proficiency and situational responsiveness. Employment and Labor Minister Kim Moon-soo has been vocal in his opposition to the proposal, reiterating in media interviews that “ village bus drivers are not unskilled laborers” and highlighting the extensive qualifications and skills required for the job. Critics argue that Seoul’s focus should instead be on improving working conditions for existing drivers rather than sourcing cheaper foreign labor. The Korean Automobile Workers’ Federation stated, “The real issue behind the shortage of village bus drivers is low wages and excessive workloads. Enhancing their work environment and fair compensation must take priority.” The Labor Ministry plans to formally communicate its stance to the Prime Minister’s Office this week, effectively shelving the proposal for the foreseeable future.

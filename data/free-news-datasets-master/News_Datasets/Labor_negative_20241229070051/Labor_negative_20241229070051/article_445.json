    "text": "By Michael Foli Jackidy Ho (V/R), Nov. 29, GNA – Mr Ken Kponor, the Volta Regional Director of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE), has urged marginalised groups to reject monetary inducements from politicians or political parties in exchange for their votes. He said monetary inducement could compromise the integrity of the elections and had long-term negative consequences on governance and the lives of the electorate. Mr Kponor gave the advice at civic education forum in Ho where he addressed audiences including women’s groups and persons with disabilities, on the importance of voting responsibly. The forum was organised as part of the NCCE’s mandate to promote peaceful elections and it was in collaboration with the International Republican Institute (IRI) with support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Mr Kponor warned that accepting money to vote could result in electing unqualified leaders, leading to poor governance. “We must not be tempted to trade our votes for money. If we allow this practice to continue, it will become a major problem in the future, affecting governance and development,” he cautioned. He encouraged the participants to focus on the long-term implications of their voting choices rather than short-term financial gain, adding that avoiding vote-buying was crucial to ensuring the election of the right leaders, who would prioritise the needs of the people over personal interests. Mr Kponor also highlighted the growing problem of misinformation and disinformation, urging participants to verify information before sharing them. “Many of us receive messages on our phones and forward them without checking the accuracy. This can contribute to the spread of false information,” he said reminding participants that spreading fake news could have serious repercussions, including legal consequences. To ensure participants were well-prepared for election day, Mr Kponor provided a step-by-step guide on how to correctly cast their ballots to avoid spoiling them and their votes rejected. He emphasised the importance of properly marking the ballot papers to ensure that their votes would be counted. Mr Joshua Hebidzi, the Monitoring and Evaluation Officer at the International Republican Institute, underscored the importance of empowering marginalized groups to participate in the electoral process. He explained that IRI’s collaboration with NCCE aimed to enhance accountability among politicians and encourage electoral reforms. “Our focus is on providing voter education to marginalized groups, including women, persons with disabilities, and youth,” he said. Mr Oral Robert Amenyo, the Deputy Volta Regional Director for NCCE, urged women to exercise their right to vote without fear of intimidation. “In a democratic society, every individual, including marginalised groups, is guaranteed rights and freedoms under the constitution,” he stated. He encouraged women to take an active role in the electoral process and be confident in their civic duties. Some of the participants expressed their gratitude for the education provided by NCCE, acknowledging the value of the information and pledged to reject vote-buying while committing to responsible voting. This initiative by NCCE and IRI is part of ongoing efforts to ensure free, fair, and credible elections in Ghana, particularly in the Volta Region, by empowering marginalised groups with the knowledge and confidence to make informed decisions at the polls.

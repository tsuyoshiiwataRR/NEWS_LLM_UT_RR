    "text": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has dismissed excuses by some state chapters refusing to join the planned nationwide strike, asserting that the welfare of workers must remain paramount. Speaking to Punch, the NLC National Treasurer, Akeem Ambali, revealed that the union had mobilised its affiliate unions across the country, instructing their leadership to prepare members in states yet to implement the new N70,000 minimum wage for industrial action.\nAmbali condemned states that had only made verbal commitments without formal agreements or concrete implementation plans.\nHe said, “Labour will embark on strike by midnight of the 30th of this month (November); we have mobilsed for that. We have directed the leadership of all affiliates to mobilise their members for the strike.\n“Even states that only made pronouncements without signing an agreement with labour and have yet to implement the new minimum wage will also experience the strike because we know some of them only made statements.\n“They never paid the new minimum wage. Making a pronouncement without negotiation is not known to labour law; even making a pronouncement without cash backing is not acceptable to labour.\n“Those who have only made empty promises and those who are saying they will start paying by January 2025 will incur the wrath of labour. This is not acceptable to us. There will be a strike in these states by 30th midnight.\n“We are very serious about this. We have had all the organs meeting, and the issue has been decided; there is no going back.”\nThe NLC’s Head of Protocol and Public Relations, Benson Upah, said no amount of persuasion or partial compliance would prevent the industrial action, insisting that only full implementation would avert the looming strike.",

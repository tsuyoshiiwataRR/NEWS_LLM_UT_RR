    "text": "This is the last article you can read this month You can read more article this month You can read more articles this month Sorry your limit is up for this month Reset on: Please help support the Morning Star by subscribing here WORKERS at five hospitals across two NHS trusts in South London began a four-day strike today after last-minute talks failed to prevent industrial action. The workers, who are employed by private contractor ISS as domestics, porters, and catering staff, will march to ISS headquarters in Canary Wharf on the last day of action on Monday. Their union the GMB said the dispute centres around pay, terms and conditions. Members have also reported being bullied and harassed. Helen O’Connor of GMB Southern Region said: “Our members … work hard ensuring hospitals are safe, clean and that patients are well fed and get to appointments on time. “ISS are making staffing cutbacks and wages and conditions are being driven down. “The NHS should exist for the benefit of patients and its hard-working staff should not be exploited by private companies who are out to make a profit.” Ms O’Connor said the Croydon NHS and South London and Maudsley NHS trusts have the “ultimate responsibility” to get involved in resolving the dispute. The five hospitals are Mayday, the Maudsley at Denmark Hill, Bethlem Royal Hospital, Lambeth Hospital and the Ladywell Unit at Lewisham Hospital.

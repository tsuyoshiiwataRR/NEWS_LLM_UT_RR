    "text": "In Argentina, the vegetable oil sector is experiencing a disruption due to an ongoing strike by workers, which is affecting the nation's agribusiness. As of August 08, the entry of trucks into the port terminals of Greater Rosario has decreased by 85%, with only 396 trucks compared to the previous week's average of 2,600 vehicles. The strike, initiated by the San Lorenzo Vegetable Oil Workers Union (SOEA) and supported by the sector's Federation of Workers, is in its third day with no signs of resolution. The core issue is a demand for a 25% wage increase, which has been rejected by companies, citing income tax deductions as a primary concern for compensation demands.\nGustavo Idígoras, president of Ciara, stated that the conflict revolves around the government's income tax policy rather than company policies, noting that workers will face deductions for non-working days and lose attendance bonuses. Accusations have been made against agro-exporters, suggesting they are leveraging the strike to advocate for a currency devaluation. Ciara has expressed that their proposal exceeds expected inflation and aims to position workers' wages above many other economic activities in Argentina, placing the continuation of the strike in the unions' hands.\nConversely, the SOEA and FTCIODYARA argue a lack of willingness to negotiate on the part of the companies, leading to an extension of the strike for an additional 24 hours from the first shift on Thursday, August 08. This labour dispute highlights the tensions within Argentina's crucial agribusiness sector, raising concerns over the country's reputation as a reliable food supplier.\nSource: [datamarnews.com](https://www.datamarnews.com/noticias/strike-disrupts-argentine-agribusiness-as-vegetable-oil-workers-demand-pay-increase/)",

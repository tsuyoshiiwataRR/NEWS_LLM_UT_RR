    "text": "The union umbrella Travail.Suisse published its “Barometer of working conditions” this Friday. Well, it seems the Swiss don’t like them that much. According to the organization: “The representative results for 2024 clearly show the extent of stress and overload in the world of work.”\nThe result is that “six out of seven workers admit to sometimes being too exhausted after work to still take care of their personal or family affairs.” Worse still, one in three people say they are “exhausted very often”. A result described as “record” by Travail.Suisse.\nIn this context, hundreds of thousands of people would be looking to change jobs next year. This situation worries national advisor Léonore Porchet (V/VD), vice-president of the organization: “The fight against stress must be an absolute political priority. (…) If more than 770,000 workers are thinking of changing jobs next year because of the stress they have undergone, we can clearly see that we must combat stress not only for reasons of health protection, but also in the interest of the national economy.\nSwiss",

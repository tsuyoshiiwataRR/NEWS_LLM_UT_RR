    "text": "GP leaders vote to ballot staff on strike action\nImage source, PA Media Image caption, GPs said they were not valued as much as other doctors in the health service\nPublished 29 November 2024, 16:19 GMT Updated 16 minutes ago Scottish GP leaders have voted in favour of a motion to ballot workers on taking industrial action over pay, blaming \"years of disinvestment in general practice\".\nAt the conference for BMA Scotland's Local Medical Committee (LMC) in Clydebank, representatives said it was important to \"make the Scottish government see the harm they have caused and redress the balance of healthcare provision.\"\nThe LMC represent GPs in regions throughout Scotland and said GPs were not given fair pay awards compared to other doctors in the NHS.\nThe Scottish Health Secretary Neil Gray said that extra funding would help practices retain staff.\nThe LMC argued that staff have faced funding cuts instead of uplifts.\nA spokesperson for Grampian LMC, who put the motion forward, said the call for a ballot on industrial action was supported unanimously.\nThe spokesperson said: \"Industrial action is not an easy step for independent contractor GPs to take.\n\"We know the patients we care for well, and we know what a restriction in services would mean to them.\n\"However, this needs to be balanced with the significantly higher risk of a longer-term reduction in service due to 15 years of chronic underfunding of general practice, and the risk of harm to patients that will result from this.\"",

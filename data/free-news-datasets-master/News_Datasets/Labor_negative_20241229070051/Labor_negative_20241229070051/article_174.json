    "text": "TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Newly appointed Labor Minister Hung Sun-han (洪申翰) on Thursday (Nov. 29) rescheduled a weekend briefing to next week, following pushback from staff members over the request to work overtime.\nHung said he had made arrangements with KMT Legislator Su Ching-chuan (蘇清泉) to facilitate the change. Hung's predecessor, Ho Pei-shan (何佩珊), [resigned](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/news/5977081) after the suicide of a staff member that may have been linked to bullying from their supervisor, Hsieh I-jung (謝宜容).\nIn response to reports of discontent among labor department staff over having to work overtime on the weekend, Hung explained the rescheduling was due to the Social Welfare and Environment Hygiene Committee's briefing next week, per [CNA](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/ahel/202411280400.aspx).\nDPP legislative caucus secretary-general Wu Szu-yao (吳思瑤) defended the overtime arrangement, saying it was necessary. Wu also suggested the KMT had pushed Hung into a position where he had to make an overtime request, per [Newstalk](https://newtalk.tw/news/view/2024-11-29/946838).\nThe TPP [criticized](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/eDDTUNhKJnDjUV6u/) Hung for making more work for staff. Meanwhile, former DPP Legislator Kuo Cheng-liang (郭正亮) speculated that a faction within the DPP had controlled the labor department for a long time, which could explain the leak about weekend work.\nKuo cautioned Hung to be mindful of the potential fallout from the investigation, per [NOWnews](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E6%B4%AA%E7%94%B3%E7%BF%B0%E8%A6%81%E6%B1%82%E5%81%87%E6%97%A5%E5%8A%A0%E7%8F%AD%E6%83%B9%E8%AD%B0-%E4%BB%96%E7%88%86-%E5%88%B0%E8%99%95%E6%98%AF%E7%9C%BC%E7%B7%9A-013958673.html).",

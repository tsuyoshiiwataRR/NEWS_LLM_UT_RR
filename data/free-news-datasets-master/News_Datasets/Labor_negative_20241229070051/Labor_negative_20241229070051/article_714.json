    "text": "A young software developer in Bengaluru was abruptly terminated from his first full-time job after just 2.5 months, highlighting growing concerns about workplace practices in startup environments. The developer, who had six months of internship experience, was hired as a frontend developer but quickly found himself overwhelmed by unexpected full-stack responsibilities.In a detailed account shared on Reddit's \\\"DevelopersIndia\\\" community, the developer revealed the challenges he faced during his short tenure. \\\"In the first week, I was assigned a project where 70% of the tasks were backend-related,\\\" he explained, admitting he had no prior experience in backend development. Despite his willingness to learn, the workload became increasingly unmanageable.Communication became a critical issue as the developer navigated his challenging role. \\\"I conveyed every problem I faced in the project's Slack channel, as instructed,\\\" he shared. The response was inconsistent - sometimes receiving feedback, often left in silence. Pull request reviews dragged on for 3-4 days, creating significant workflow disruptions.The termination came suddenly via a text message from a board member, leaving the young professional feeling \\\"confused and defeated.\\\" He was given no prior warning and no opportunity to explain his perspective. \\\"They said they couldn't continue with me, without prior warning or an opportunity to explain my side,\\\" he shared.Left feeling lost and questioning his professional trajectory, the developer reflected on the experience. \\\"I'm wondering if I was set up for failure by being assigned tasks I wasn't experienced enough to handle,\\\" he said.Online reactions were swift and sympathetic. \\\"This wasn't your fault. It's a poor reflection on the company's management,\\\" one Reddit user commented. Another suggested, \\\"Startups can be chaotic; always clarify job roles before joining.\\\"Some commenters pointed to broader industry issues. \\\"Unfortunately, some startups exploit freshers to cut costs. This seems like a case of unrealistic expectations,\\\" one user noted. Others offered supportive advice: \\\"Don't let this setback define you. Use this as a learning opportunity.\\\"",

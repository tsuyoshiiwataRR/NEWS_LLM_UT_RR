    "text": "After Amazon’s recent decision to get employees back in the office full time, a senior executive has reportedly told an internal meeting that those unhappy with the change should resign, [according to Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-aws-ceo-quit-if-you-dont-want-return-office-2024-10-17/).\nBut the e-commerce giant may want to tread carefully. New findings from the International Workplace Group (IWG) show that two thirds (67 per cent) of recruiters have seen a rise in candidates searching for new roles after their current employers enforced a return to office (RTO) mandate policy.\nThe survey of 500 recruiters also found that three quarters (75 per cent) have had candidates reject job offers that don’t offer flexible working, while 72 per cent noted that businesses that fail to provide hybrid working options are becoming less competitive in the job market.\n[Majority of CEOs see a full return to the office within three years, study shows ](https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1890265/majority-ceos-full-return-office-within-three-years-study-shows)\n[How to encourage reluctant employees back to the office](https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1884751/encourage-reluctant-employees-back-office)\n[Employees demand pay rises if forced back to the office full time, report finds](https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1888643/employees-demand-pay-rises-forced-back-office-full-time-report-finds)\n“You can’t force the butterfly back into the chrysalis,” said Claire Campbell, CEO of Timewise, explaining that “people’s lives have fundamentally altered” since the pandemic, affecting their patterns of care, spend on the commute, health, and involvement in family life.\n“These are important enough that people will leave their jobs to retain that flexibility,” she said, adding that a particular concern is the “potential impact on workforce diversity – with parents, carers and female colleagues most likely to suffer from enforced office working.”\nSimilarly, Gary Cookson, director of Epic HR, told People Management: “People have personalised work to their own preferences, and will be understandably reluctant to return to a more collective experience and set of arrangements. It isn’t surprising that those people resist RTO mandates or vote with their feet and leave.”\nThe high cost of commuting\nCookson further highlighted the impact of a long and draining daily commute: “The concept of five days a week in the office is premised on whomever does that having someone else to do all the cooking, cleaning, childcare, housework and other life admin – possibly unpaid.\n“That isn’t how most families operate. So it isn’t surprising that people reject job offers that don’t include the flexibility that most need.”\nA separate study by IWG, which surveyed 1,000 white collar workers who commute everyday, found that almost half (46 per cent) were actively seeking jobs that don’t require commuting.\nThe most common reasons for seeking new roles include the high cost (44 per cent) and time commitment (40 per cent) of commuting, with a third (33 per cent) citing the impact on their work-life balance.\nA fifth (21 per cent) of those working five days in the office reported daily burnout, while only a quarter (25 per cent) felt that being in the office five days a week was essential for doing their job effectively.\nAn [additional academic study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5031481) tracking over 3 million tech and finance workers' employment histories on LinkedIn found that firms enforcing RTO policies experienced “abnormally high” employed turnover.\nThis trend was particularly noticeable among female, senior, and those with advanced skills. These firms also took significantly longer time to fill vacancies and lower hiring rates after implementing RTO mandates.\nCould RTO mandates be reversed?\nSince the announcement that employees would have to return to the office full time from January 2025, 500 employees of Amazon Web Services wrote to their CEO asking for the mandate to be repealed. Could this backlash prompt a change?\nGemma Dale, lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University, said she does not expect companies to u-turn on their decisions anytime soon. She told People Management: “I think companies like Amazon are not especially likely to change their minds, as it seems highly unlikely that this possibility was not considered, and the risk deemed worth taking. Only time will tell if that gamble pays off for them.”\nHowever, she noted that Amazon’s decision is not representative of all large companies: “Although we see the headlines when big companies mandate returns, there are many organisations who successfully implemented hybrid and remote work and continue to quietly reap the rewards. I think this will continue, as will RTO mandates for those that prioritise in person work.”\nIn contrast, Cookson argued that a “climbdown” from a full RTO is “quite likely” for employers like Amazon, or they will need to implement other cost-cutting measures to deal with the fallout of their decision. “Employers who have done a full RTO mandate are likely to already be suffering and the data proves that if they aren’t yet, they will suffer in future,” he said.\n‘A blunt tool’\nCampbell acknowledged that RTO mandates often stem from dissatisfaction with a company’s current working model. However, she warned: “There is a big difference between involving employees, consulting on what they think and mutually co-designing a hybrid approach, and a topline mandate that everyone has to adhere to, which isn’t grounded in business needs.”\n“Where employers feel that their current arrangements are not working well, rather than using a blunt tool of a return-to-work mandate, they should think about how opportunities for remote working can be implemented more effectively,’ Clare Kelliher, professor of work and organisation at Cranfield School of Management, told People Management.\nShe explained that allowing employees some autonomy over their working arrangements can bring benefits for employers too, such as greater loyalty and enhanced performance.\n“Each organisation has to establish what works best for them in the current environment,” Kelliher advised. “This can take time, and this is likely to be influenced by the nature of work that is done and their workforce.”\n“The future of entirely office-based working seems bleak,” said Cookson. “Whilst entirely remote-based working may be equally unattractive to some, a hybrid approach seems sensible – but organisations need to be aware that it is more than just asking people to work some days at home and some in the office.”\n[Read the CIPD’s advice for people professionals on how to get the best out of hybrid working arrangements](https://www.cipd.org/en/knowledge/guides/planning-hybrid-working/)",

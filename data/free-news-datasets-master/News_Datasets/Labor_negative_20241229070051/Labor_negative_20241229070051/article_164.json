    "text": "They confronted the HR department, only to be met with dismissive responses and a lack of understanding.\nAt times, even after giving our best, we do not get what we deserve. We must then stand up for our rights and speak for ourselves. A group of ten workers did this when they were denied a raise and the basic amenities that they needed at the workplace. They had first made a request but it went unheard so they decided to skip work on one day and meet at a coworker's place. [u/UnoriginallyGeneric](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/14rjtn4/ten_of_us_left_our_work_on_monday_and_it_feels_so/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) shared, \"So, up until Monday, I was a lead shipper and receiver and forklift operator for a regional health care company. I supervised five people in my department. Unlike many industries, we never shuttered during COVID.\"\nShe added, \"We kept everyone throughout the pandemic. What's more, nobody caught COVID during the time due to, well due diligence on our part, as well as having a COVID immunization clinic that came to our door.\" She continued, \"So, while the office staff was successful in negotiating raises to stay at home, we got to thinking: our cost of living has gone up. Gas became more expensive, and we still have to come in, why aren't we allowed a sizeable raise?\"\n\"I mean, the sales staff only have to come in once every two weeks for half a day, why should they get a big raise when we still had to drive in each day? HR came in twice a week at best, and our accounts payable/receivable person hadn't been in the office for two years: trust me, we know,\" the employee noted.\nThe group of workers expressed their dissatisfaction to the HR department, highlighting that they were overworked, underpaid, and deeply frustrated. They emphasized the importance of having content and motivated individuals responsible for distributing their products and maintaining optimal facility conditions. However, the HR department responded dismissively, revealing their lack of understanding and awareness. In an example of their cluelessness, a representative questioned why a functioning forklift couldn't be utilized instead of one that was out of order but still operable.\nThe situation escalated further when the HR department claimed they lacked the necessary funds. At this point, tensions reached a boiling point. As the lead in the logistics department, the individual confronted the HR representative directly, making it clear that they were well aware of the organization's incoming resources, expenses and pricing strategies.\n\"So, we left the meeting, not a dollar richer, and even more frustrated but I did have an ace up my sleeve: one of my oldest friends from high school was promoted to VP of logistics at another company: when I informed him of my issues where we were, he said that they were looking to staff a new warehouse,\" the employee added. \"We started to discuss numbers, and after a week he was able to offer the ten of us employment contracts for everything we all asked for but was denied. Contracts in hand, it was an easy sell to convince everyone to sign.\"\n\"Within the day everyone signed and had a two-week notice letter drafted to HR. Eventually, she panicked and offered me basically everything we asked for: but we declined and said that we were done.\"\nPeople were quick to rally around the employee and their group for standing up to their workplace.

You stayed professional and gave them every opportunity. And you took care of your team! I hope this next job is much better!\"\nThis article originally appeared 1 year ago.",

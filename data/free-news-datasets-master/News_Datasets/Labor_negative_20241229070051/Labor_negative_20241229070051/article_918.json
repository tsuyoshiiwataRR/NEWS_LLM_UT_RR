    "text": "In Kelantan, Starbucks recently ceased the operation in its one last outlet.\nThe Starbucks in KB Mall, Kota Bharu, officially closed its doors yesterday (November 30). Due to the ongoing boycott movement, the number of closed Starbucks branches in Malaysia increased from 25 to 50 outlets , reported Sin Chew .\nAccording to the report, the outlet in KB Mall stopped selling coffee three days before its closure . The coffee beans were grounded, and the baristas could only sell non-coffee beverages to the patrons before the closure.\nAn emotional goodbye\nMany employees, especially those who had been stationed at the outlet for a long time, got emotional, and some decided to resign because they didn’t want to be transferred to other outlets.\nThe employees resigned for different reasons, but most couldn’t accept being transferred to other states.\nThe other 2 closed outlets were located near the commercial district. On its closure day, some customers came and sat down for some beverages to show their support one last time before Starbucks in KB Mall closed its doors forever.\nWhat do you think of the closure of ALL Starbucks outlets in KB Mall?\nAlso read: “I don’t know what’s this” – M’sians Share Their Funny Experience of Trying Starbucks For the 1st Time\nSource: Sin Chew Source: Sin Chew Source: Sin Chew",

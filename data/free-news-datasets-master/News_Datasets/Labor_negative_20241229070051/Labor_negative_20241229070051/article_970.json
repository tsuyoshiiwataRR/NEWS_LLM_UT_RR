    "text": "- By\n[Imran Zafar](/authors/imran-zafar) - Published: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 05:44 PM (IST)\n- Source:JND\nAmazon is under prosecution in an Indian court for alleged labour law violations at its warehouse near Haryana’s Manesar. The case follows a labour inspection earlier this year that flagged inadequate safety measures and legal non-compliance, according to documents obtained by Al Jazeera through India’s Right to Information (RTI) Act. The Haryana government has filed a case based on the inspection findings, with the next court hearing set for December 10.\nAllegations Of Unsafe Working Conditions\nThe investigation was initiated after reports emerged of an incident in May where workers were allegedly coerced into forgoing breaks, including for water or restroom use, to meet performance targets. The inspection revealed multiple violations, including the absence of protective clothing for female workers near machinery, which is a clear breach of India’s labour laws, reported Al Jazeera.\nAmazon's internal inquiry confirmed that a manager enforced such a pledge as a “motivational exercise,” which the company later described as an “unfortunate and isolated” incident. Disciplinary action was taken, though details remain undisclosed.\nThe inspection report highlighted Amazon's failure to provide necessary safety equipment and to maintain legally mandated records. Workers were also reportedly not issued employment identity cards. The lack of tight-fitting clothing for female workers near moving machinery was deemed a significant safety hazard, potentially leading to serious injuries, the report stated.\nALSO READ: [Kashmiri Pandit Women To Retain Migrant Status Despite Marriage To Non-Migrants: J-K High Court](https://english.jagran.com/india/kashmiri-pandit-women-to-retain-migrant-status-despite-marriage-to-non-migrants-jk-high-court-10204312)\nCourt Proceedings And Amazon's Response\nThe Haryana government submitted the inspection report as evidence to a Gurugram court, which summoned Amazon to appear on October 28. The hearing was adjourned and the case will resume on December 10. Amazon, in response to inquiries, stated that it had not received a copy of the inspection report and could not comment on the court proceedings, citing the case’s sub-judice status.\nWorker Complaints\nAmazon workers also raised concerns about stringent performance targets and constant surveillance. One worker, identified as Supriya, stated they are expected to stow 150 items per hour, adding that missing the target invites negative feedback. The monitoring includes tracking every minute spent on work or breaks, increasing stress levels.\nALSO READ: [Punjab: Farmer Groups To Hold Foot March Towards Delhi On December 6 For Legal Guarantee On MSP](https://english.jagran.com/india/punjab-farmer-groups-to-hold-foot-march-towards-delhi-on-december-6-for-legal-guarantee-on-msp-10204304)\nBroader Scrutiny Of Amazon's Labour Practices\nGlobally, Amazon’s labour practices have come under intense scrutiny, with workers in the US and UK voicing similar grievances. A survey by the Amazon India Workers Association and UNI Global Union found that over 80 per cent of warehouse workers in India struggled to meet the company’s targets. Amazon dismissed the survey as “factually incorrect.”",

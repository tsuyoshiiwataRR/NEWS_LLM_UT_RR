    "text": "Read full article The Independent Amazon workers planning to strike from Black Friday to Cyber Monday Michelle Del Rey November 29, 2024 at 5:35 a.m. · 2 min read Link Copied Amazon workers planning to strike from Black Friday to Cyber Monday\nAmazon workers are planning to strike from Black Friday through Cyber Monday to hold the company accountable for “labor abuses, environmental degradation and threats to democracy,” organizers say.\nThe “Make Amazon Pay” protest, organized by UNI Global Union and Progressive International, will take place in 20 different countries and major cities in the United Kingdom, United States, Germany, Japan and Brazil.\n“Amazon is everywhere, but so are we. By uniting our movements across borders, we can not only force Amazon to change its ways but lay the foundations of a world that prioritizes human dignity, not Jeff Bezos’ bank balance.” said Varsha Gandikota-Nellutia Progressive International Co-General Coordinator.\nThe event could impact the biggest shopping weekend of the year, though it’s not clear how many Amazon workers would be participating. Thousands are thought to be going on strike in Germany alone. Unions and allied tax justice, anti-poverty and garment worker rights groups will be part of the protest.\nA spokesperson for Amazon told ABC News: “This group is being intentionally misleading and continues to promote a false narrative...The fact is at Amazon we provide great pay, great benefits, and great opportunities.”\nJeff Bezos is founder and executive chairman of Amazon (AFP via Getty Images)\nAmazon spokesperson Eileen Hards told Fox News: “The fact is, at Amazon we provide great pay, great benefits, and great opportunities — all from day one. We’ve created more than 1.5 million jobs around the world, and counting, and we provide a modern, safe, and engaging workplace whether you work in an office or at one of our operations buildings.”\nIt’s the fifth year the organizers have held the “Make Amazon Pay” campaign.\nThe group took issue with Amazon’s work in the political arena. Amazon underreported its lobbying expenditures across Europe by millions, the group said, adding Amazon refused to participate in public hearings, prompting the European Parliament to ban the company’s lobbyists.\nIn the US, organizers worry Amazon’s challenging the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Board will threaten protections for American workers. In Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom, Amazon has been accused of intimidating workers to prevent unionization efforts.\n“Amazon’s relentless pursuit of profit comes at a cost to workers, the environment and democracy,” said Christy Hoffman, General Secretary of UNI Global Union. “Bezos’s company has spent untold millions to stop workers from organizing, but the strikes and protests happening around the world show that workers’ desire for justice – for union representation – can’t be stopped.\n“We stand united in demanding that Amazon treat its workers fairly, respect fundamental rights, and stop undermining the systems meant to protect us all. ‘Make Amazon Pay Day’ is becoming a global act of resistance against Amazon’s abuse of power.”\nThe Independent has asked Amazon for comment.",

    "text": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Wednesday officially declared social media as an 'environmental toxin' and 'public health hazard', putting it in the same category as tobacco and guns. With this, the Big Apple becomes the first city to issue an advisory against social media. Adams further criticized TikTok, YouTube and Facebook, blaming the three platforms for mental health issues in children. His observation is based on latest surveys saying that teen depression levels have hit their highest levels in a decade. In the advisory, the New York mayor added that parents should impose 'tech-free times' for children. The Democrat also urged teens to consider turning off their notifications and tracking their emotions while online.The city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene also identified unrestricted access to and use of social media as a public health hazard.\"Today, Dr. Ashwin Vasan is issuing a Health Commissioner's Advisory, officially designating social media as a public health hazard in New York City,\" Adams announced during his State of the City address. The advisory cited a 2021 survey stating that on weekdays 77% of New York City high schoolers spent three or more hours per day in front of screens, not including homework. Adams added that the platforms are \"fueling a mental health crisis by designing their platforms with addictive and dangerous features.\"\"We are the first major American city to take this step and call out the danger of social media like this. Just as the surgeon general did with tobacco and guns, we are treating social media like other public health hazards and ensuring that tech companies take responsibility for their products,\" Adams said.",

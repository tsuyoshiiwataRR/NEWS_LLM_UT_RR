    "text": "The homeless crisis in California is so awful that people are undertaking extreme and unusual measures to obtain shelter thanks to the state’s Democrats and Biden’s garbage economy.\nAs CBS News Sacramento reported Wednesday, multiple filthy homeless caves tucked along the Tuolumne were discovered and cleared out by volunteer groups and the Modesto Police Department last weekend. The caves were found across the street from Crater Avenue, roughly 20 feet below street level and are accessible via makeshift stairs built into the hillside.\nThe Modesto Police released a statement on Facebook revealing that 7,600 pounds of trash were removed. The area has been ridden with illegal camps for a while.\nOver the weekend, the Modesto Police Department collaborated with 9.2.99, a local community volunteer group, to conduct a joint clean-up operation in the vicinity of the Tuloumne River, specifically in the Crater Avenue and Dallas Street area.\nThis particular area has been plagued by vagrancy and illegal camps, which have raised concerns due to the fact that these camps were actually caves dug into the riverbanks.\nDuring the operation on Saturday, a total of 7,600 lbs of trash, as well as two truckloads and a trailer of garbage, were successfully removed from the area.\nTracy Rojas, who lives near the craters, took a CBS News Sacramento reporter on a precarious walk to see the makeshift homes. She detailed to the reporter just how dangerous the living conditions are.\nIf one of these were to collapse, it would be devastating. This whole thing would come down and go into the water.",

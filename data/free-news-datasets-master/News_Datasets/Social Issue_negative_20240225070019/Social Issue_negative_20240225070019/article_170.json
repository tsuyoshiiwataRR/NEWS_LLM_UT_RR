    "text": "Speakers at a Thursday forum, organized by the Michigan Department of Civil Rights, cautioned about potential increases in hate crimes and threats tied to the 2024 presidential election. The two-hour event was part of the department's \"MI Response to Hate Campaign,\" which aims to increase awareness about hate and bias.\nPresenters from the the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights said hate crimes have been on the rise. At the same time, over the last four election cycles, hate crimes have tended to increase in election years as the politics become more divisive, they said.\n\"Broadly speaking, there is a parallel between the political climate and the number of reported hate crimes,\" said Nadia Aziz, senior director for the Fighting Hate and Bias Program at the Washington, D.C.-based Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \"And we're, of course, concerned that the 2024 general election cycle will be no different from the previous cycles.\"\nSocial media companies have failed to curb hatred on their platforms, and the highly charged political climate has made it easier for \"conspiracy theories and disinformation to spread like wildfire,\" said Carter Wynne, a program manager with the leadership conference.\nIn November, voters will pick a candidate to be the country's president for the next four years. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and former President Donald Trump, a Republican, are their parties most likely nominees, meaning they could face off in a rematch of the 2020 race.\nIn 2020, Biden won Michigan by 3 percentage points or 154,000 votes. However, Trump maintained false claims that widespread fraud swayed the outcome , spurring protests and a push to overturn the result.\nDuring Thursday's forum, Izabella Silva, clerk engagement organizer for central Michigan for the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, cited 2023 survey data that showed about half of the election clerks said they had been insulted. In the same data, about 20% of the participating clerks said they had been threatened.\nThe Bridging Divides Initiative at Princeton University and CivicPulse tracked the numbers .\n\"The findings of this study highlight the need for collective action to address and mitigate some of the pressure that local officials and election administrators are facing as they work to carry out our elections,\" Silva said.\nOakland County Clerk Lisa Brown, a Democrat, also spoke at the Thursday forum, saying hostility was likely the biggest threat facing election workers in Michigan.\nBrown noted the state Legislature passed a bill last year making it illegal to intimidate an election official or otherwise prevent election officials from performing their duties .\ncmauger@detroitnews.com",

    "text": "- Joined - Sep 3, 2022 - Messages - 12 - Reaction score - -17 Hello, I'd like to address the one big issue of many garden has, if it's not already obvious as I'm saying this since the day it dropped - it's macroing for 16h a day with open source mods and/or simple scripts etc, and yet neither they get punished nor is hypixel trying anything else to prevent this from happening (no pests did not do the slightest against macroing, it just made it more annoying for legit players lmao). The (main-)inflation was not from dillo, who could have thought! Of course dillo inflated old money, but does it matter if it's in a legit way and everyone has access to it? Imagine legit players making actual money from npc whilest having fun with a cool game mechanic dancing on their dillos, unacceptable! - But seriously, how can you be so blind and/or ignorant to not see the obvious and finally decide to do something against it, it's already a horrible part of the game even for legit players (in my opinion) but either opinion doesn't even matter here as the problem with scripters outweighs any other advantages for the game. Now if it was up to me, I'd just completely disable that part of the game and either revamp it or just give up on this failed project. Just accept you failed on that part of the game and get your ideas on how to fix this problem if you can't handle the scripters by no way of detecting them. Give up on the concept of people should be still able to watch a series whilest farming if you then can't handle the consequences, this concept already is like a magnet for scripters without even knowing what game or game mechanic it is, make it active just like dungeons or even kinda mining/fishing (of course you could script those aswell, but easier detectable + people non stop watch you) where you actually need brain cells. Another post which won't have any impact on their decision making - check! byebye I'd like to address the one big issue of many garden has, if it's not already obvious as I'm saying this since the day it dropped - it's macroing for 16h a day with open source mods and/or simple scripts etc, and yet neither they get punished nor is hypixel trying anything else to prevent this from happening (no pests did not do the slightest against macroing, it just made it more annoying for legit players lmao).

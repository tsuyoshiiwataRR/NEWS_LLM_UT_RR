    "text": "Thinking of sending a check to Nikki Haley as she\ncontinues her quest for the GOP presidential nomination? Well, if for some reason you foresee also wanting to donate money to Donald Trump, now or in the future, the ex-president has a characteristically unhinged message for you: Do so at your own peril!\nYes, in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump\ndeclared, “Anybody that makes a ‘Contribution’ to Birdbrain, from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. We don’t want them, and will not accept them, because we Put America First, and ALWAYS WILL!” (Trump debuted the wildly misogynistic Birdbrain nickname at a recent rally in New Hampshire.) The former president of the United States did not say how his campaign would compile such a blacklist, but perhaps it’ll have an intern comb through disclosure forms to ensure no money is being accepted from anyone who dared also chip in to support his rival. Or maybe it was just an empty threat that he has no intention of following through on! One doesn’t really know, but something we do know is that Trump is quite clearly in full-on mob boss mode, as evidenced by his apparent attempt to scare Haley out of the election with a prediction that she’d be investigated if she were to win:\nX content\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it\noriginates from.\nOpenly vowing to get revenge on rivals and critics is, of course, nothing new for the last president, and has in fact been a feature of his campaign. “I’m hard-pressed to find any candidates anywhere who are so open that they would use the power of the state to go after critics and enemies,” Steven Levitsky, a Harvard government professor and coauthor of How Democracies Die,\ntold The Guardian in November. “This is one of the most openly authoritarian campaigns I’ve ever seen. You have to go back to the far-right authoritarians in the 1930s in Europe or in 1970s Latin America to find the kind of dehumanizing and violent language that Trump is starting to consistently use.”\nAt a rally in South Carolina on Wednesday, Haley told supporters that she had raised $1 million in approximately 24 hours, much of it from small-dollar donations. “We have raised $1 million since I gave that speech last night—online, in small dollars,” she said. “We have had 200,000 donors from all 50 states. Ninety-five percent of those donations are $200 or less.” And apparently, should those people decide to show her financial support again, they’ll be barred from ever giving money to Trump.\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\nPlus: The\nMost Shocking Snubs and SurprisesFrom the 2024 Oscar Noms\nNikki Haley and the\nMAGA Mountain Simone BilesTalks Marriage, WAG Life, and the Paris Olympics\nA Legendary Photographer Recounts\nStorming AmericaWith the Beatles\nThe\nWild TruthBehind a So-Called Real Gone Girl Case\nFrom the Archive:\nDoris Duke’s Final Mystery(1994)\nThe post\nDonald Trump Tells Haley Donors to Abandon Her Now or He’ll Blacklist Them appeared first on Vanity Fair.",

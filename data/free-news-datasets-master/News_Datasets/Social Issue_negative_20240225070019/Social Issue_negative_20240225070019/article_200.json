    "text": "Senior Government Attorney Pleads Guilty To Child Pornography Charge\nHe could spend the rest of his life behind bars.\nA senior attorney at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Mark Black, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to produce child pornography and one count of coercion and enticement. According to reports, Black was a member of two online groups dedicated to finding prepubescent girls and having them record sexually explicit content.\nAs\nreported by Reuters:\nThe Justice Department said Black induced a minor to engage in such conduct in 2019 and secretly recorded it. Also in 2019, he and an unnamed co-conspirator also convinced another girl to engage in similar acts on a livestream, which was also secretly recorded and shared.\nSponsored\n<a href=\"https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/how-this-law-firm-converts-4x-more-web-traffic-through-digital-transformation/\">\nHow This Law Firm Converts 4x More Web Traffic Through Digital Transformation </a>\nBlack, an attorney at the FDIC since 2013 and most recently special counsel in the office of the FDICâ€™s general counsel, was suspended by the agency when they learned of the allegations.\nBlack faces between 15 years and a lifetime in prison. He will be sentenced April 30.\nKathryn Rubino is a Senior Editor at Above the Law, host of\nThe Jabot podcast, and co-host of Thinking Like A Lawyer.

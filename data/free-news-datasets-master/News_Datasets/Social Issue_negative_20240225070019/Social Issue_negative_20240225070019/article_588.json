    "text": "The Traitors star Diane Carson has revealed she once buried the ashes of her grandfather’s partner in his grave. The retired teacher, 63, who was a fan favourite on the series, recalled the tale during an appearance on The Traitors podcast. Asked what one of the highlights of taking part was, Diane cited ‘robbing graves’ in one of the prize-building tasks. ‘I’ve only dug in a grave once so actually robbing one was -‘ she said, before host Ed Gamble interrupted to ask for more information. Diane went on: ‘This is a true story. Slightly sad, but when my grandpa died we found that he wanted his wife’s urn to be buried with him but nobody bothered. The Traitors star Diane Carson has revealed she once buried the ashes of her grandfather’s partner in his grave She recalled: ‘Slightly sad, but when my grandpa died we found that he wanted his wife’s urn to be buried with him but nobody bothered’ ‘That’s not true – they hadn’t realised that it was his wish,’ she added. Diane soon learned she would need to do another service for the urn but decided against it. She said: ‘I thought ‘Well I’m just going to do this quietly’. Diane then told how she and her former partner carried out the mission. She said: ‘My ex was on watch-out, so the coffin was sitting there and they’d piled all the soil on top. They are waiting for everything to rest, and I thought you know what ‘You stand and look out and I’ll go and make a big hole’ ‘It was in a shoebox that said ‘I want this to be buried with me. Love, Daddy’. ‘I basically buried it in with the soil so if the gravediggers saw it they would know it was a wish and I was just fulfilling somebody’s wish.’ It comes after Diane’s son Ross dropped the bombshell that she is his mother when he was banished by the other players. Diane soon learned she would need to do another service for the urn but decided against it and so buried it herself It comes after Diane’s son Ross dropped the bombshell that she is his mother when he was banished by the other players As Ross stood ready to leave the castle, he dropped the bombshell that he had not been playing the game alone, which shocked the players After spending the day in Zach’s firing line based on a theory surrounding the shield, the group ultimately voted to banish Ross. However, as Ross stood ready to leave the castle, he dropped the bombshell that he had not been playing the game alone. ‘I will just leave you with one little Easter egg before I go,’ he said. ‘I was actually the son of someone in this game… and that person was Diane.’ The reveal sent shockwaves around the round table, and the double reveal of Ross both being a Traitor and Diane’s son overwhelmed the group. ‘Oh my days Rossy Ross,’ said Harry, who was involved in Diane’d murder and meant Ross had to watch her be buried in a coffin. ‘We obviously killed Diane and made Ross go to his own mum’s funeral. This game is mad.’ *** [Read more at DailyMail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13007787/The-Traitors-Diane-reveals-secretly-buried-ashes-grandfathers-partner-grave.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490)",

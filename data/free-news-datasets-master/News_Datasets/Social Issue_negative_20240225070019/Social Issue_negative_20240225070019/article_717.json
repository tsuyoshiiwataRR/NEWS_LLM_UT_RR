    "text": "Sheriff: Rockford woman's death result of homicide-suicide The homicide of a Rockford woman is believed to be the result of domestic violence, according to the Winnebago County Sheriff's Office. Authorities said a 25-year-old woman was shot multiple times Wednesday night in the 2900 block of Searles Avenue. The woman was taken to the hospital where she died from her injuries. While on scene, sheriff deputies found the suspect, a 24-year-old man, dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities said there's no threat to the public. \"If you're experiencing domestic violence or abuse, it's crucial to understand that there is no acceptable excuse or justification for any behavior that endangers your well-being,\" Sheriff Gary Caruana said in a news release. If you are currently in or have been in a violent domestic situation, you're urged to call 911.

    "text": "APPLETON (WLUK) â€“ The suspect in an Appleton murder, which [was apparently prompted by an argument in a food truck line](https://fox11online.com/newsletter-daily/elliot-campbell-elijah-dodson-fatal-shooting-murder-homicide-downtown-appleton-college-avenue-food-truck-line-fight), was ordered Thursday to stand trial. Elliot Campbell, 21, enters a plea Feb. 8 on the first-degree intentional homicide charge for the [Dec. 24 death of Elijah Dodson](https://fox11online.com/news/local/22-year-old-shot-in-the-100-block-of-s-walnut-st-appleton). After testimony from Appleton Police Sgt. Matthew Kuether at a preliminary hearing Thursday, Campbell was bound over for trial. According to one witness, the confrontation started in the line for a food truck just off College Avenue. One person walked up behind a group of people \"so it looked like he cut in line.\" From there, it escalated into a fight, ending with the shots fired. One of the two men who joined the line gave police a similar explanation about what started the confrontation, although he did not see who fired the shots. Traffic camera video captured some video of the incident -- including showing what they believe be Campbell with a gun, and the fight, but not the shooting itself. The complaint does not include any comments from Campbell. Dodson died of two gunshot wounds to the head, according to the autopsy cited in the complaint.",

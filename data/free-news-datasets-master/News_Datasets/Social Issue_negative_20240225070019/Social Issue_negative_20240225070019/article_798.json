    "text": "OK, the joke's just lying there, waiting. Somebody has to pick it up.\nLadies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to...The Confederacy Of Dunces.\nGovernor Greg Abbott is sucking around to be the Orval Faubus, Ross Barnett, and George Wallace of the 21st Century and most of the Republican governors around the country are joining in on his little Jeff Davis Memorial Project down at the southern border. So far, Kevin Stitt (Oklahoma), Jeff Landry (Louisiana), Brian Kemp (Georgia) Kristi Noem (South Dakota), Greg Gianforte (Montana), and Ron DeSantis (Florida) have joined Abbott in the Articles of Confederation Defense Fund. And now, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's saying out loud that federal immigration policy is now being set by a sexual predator toting around 91 federal indictments, this movement now has its Clement Vallandigham as well. From MSNBC:\nMcConnell, who has been willing to occasionally ignore the former president’s legislative priorities, is now prepared to bow to Trump’s demands. As Punchbowl News reported overnight, the Senate minority leader told his members , in reference to the party’s presumptive 2024 nominee, “We don’t want to do anything to undermine him.” The president should nationalize the Texas National Guard yesterday and put a stop to this before it truly gets out of hand. (Tentherism is another one of those loopy rightist ideas that modern conservatism has entertained for decades, long before the former president* turned all those existing ideas loose.) My major concern is that both the Texas Guard and the Border Patrol may be so seriously compromised by MAGA sympathizers that actual brawls may break out all along the borderline.\nAnd I was just musing that we seem to be on the brink of an actual federal-state crack-up, and over an issue that may well damage this country's alliances with a huge chunk of North America, and over an issue that, in Washington, the issue is also threatening collaterally to kill off aid to Ukraine, so I was musing what element of this tangled and volatile situation Vladimir Putin wouldn't enjoy.\nRelated Story Who Is Charles Koch When He's At Home?

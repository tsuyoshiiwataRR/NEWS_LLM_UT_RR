    "text": "Ohio State under federal investigation after complaint it failed to address antisemitism\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) – A federal agency is investigating Ohio State University after receiving a complaint claiming the university has failed to address antisemitic incidents on campus.\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights opened a Title VI investigation into Ohio State Jan. 16. In a letter addressed to Ohio State President Ted Carter, the office said it received a complaint that the university’s failure to respond to “incidents of harassment” this past fall amounted to discrimination on the basis of Jewish ancestry.\nOhio Senate overrides DeWine’s veto, blocking cities from banning flavored tobacco\nThe letter to Carter emphasized that the investigation does not mean it has determined the university has violated Title VI’s mandate against discrimination based on race, color or national origin. Office of Civil Rights investigations follow a lengthy process, one that typically takes years.\n“Ohio State has never – and will never – tolerate discrimination or harassment of anyone based on their religious beliefs, nationality or identity,” Ohio State spokesperson Ben Johnson said in a statement.\nSince Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, the Office of Civil Rights has opened investigations into nearly three dozen colleges across the country for alleged discrimination on the basis of shared ancestry, although it’s not clear how many are related specifically to anti-Jewish discrimination. The office opened investigations into Temple University, Muhlenberg College and the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities alongside Ohio State on Jan. 16. This week, it opened investigations into Yale University, Northwestern University and two other colleges.\nA rash of antisemitic incidents occurred on and near Ohio State’s campus last fall amid high tensions over the Israel-Hamas war.\nOhio Senate overrides Gov. DeWine’s veto of trans athlete, healthcare bill\nIn early November, two women entered Ohio State’s Hillel Center on East 16th Avenue and attempted to take Israeli flags. When confronted by Hillel employees, one of the women yelled obscenities and “You support genocide” before fleeing in a car.\nAbout 12 hours later, two Ohio State students were assaulted while leaving a bar on High Street and 15th Avenue. The perpetrators asked the students about their religion and hurled antisemitic slurs before striking them in the face, then-acting Ohio State President Peter Mohler said at the time.\nAbout a month later, members of Alpha Epsilon Pi, a Jewish fraternity not recognized by Ohio State, reported to the police that two men yelled antisemitic slurs and threw bottles at the fraternity house off campus.\nShortly after the November incidents, the university announced plans to increase police presence on and off campus, including by boosting its police force’s joint patrol in the University District with Columbus Police. Ohio State also added more lights, cameras and license plate readers around campus.\nCentral Ohio barber turns tragedy into effort to help others\nGov. Mike DeWine said in November that he instructed the Ohio State Highway Patrol to coordinate with university and Columbus police to add patrols. At a November Board of Trustees meeting, Board Chair Hiroyuki Fujita said he had been discussing with DeWine and other state leaders ways to promote safety on and near campus.\nIn his first communication to the university as president, Carter wrote on Jan. 8 that “safety will not be compromised” at Ohio State.\n“I am committed to continually exploring ways in which we can enhance the safety and security of our community,” Carter said. “We also will remain focused on creating an environment in which respect, civility and compassion are forefront while continuing Ohio State’s long-standing commitment to the First Amendment and upholding the laws of our state and country.”\nThe Office of Civil Rights requested Ohio State respond to the letter by Jan. 31 with information about the university’s anti-discrimination policies, how those policies are communicated to students and staff, what the university’s definition of “antisemitism” is and details about all formal and informal complaints of national origin discrimination the university has received in the past two academic years. Ohio State requested its deadline be extended until March 4.\nCopyright 2022 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

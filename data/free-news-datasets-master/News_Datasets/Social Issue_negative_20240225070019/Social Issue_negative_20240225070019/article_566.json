    "text": "The NIH has morphed into a Marxist run organization that simply does not have the best interests of the American people at its core. In a joint effort, Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) are raising concerns about the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) plans to amend its mission statement by eliminating the commitment to “lengthen life.” The senators recently penned a letter to NIH Director Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, expressing apprehension over the potential repercussions of this proposed change. Not only is the NIH no longer insterested in extending life, but they have done all they can to actually shorten lives via their support of dubious papers designed to cover-up the facts on Covid. Natalie Winters explains ‘ The government is creating a “vaccine informatics system” to monitor discussions and “misinformation” about COVID-19 vaccines. They want to stop people from having the “reasoning behind refusing” flu, HPV and COVID vaccines. Read this NIH grant (see below) Why is the @NIH considering removing “lengthen life” from their mission statement? This could lead to an uptick in doctors recommending physician-assisted suicide- [Senator Marco Rubio] The NIH has worked with the FBI to cover up not only the origin of Covid but also the true effects of the vaccine on the American people, compared with simple treatments that could have saved about a million Americans. ‘We now know that the FBI was told very early in 2020 by a highly reliable informant that Covid leaked from the Wuhan lab. We also know the FBI established a task force by late March or early April 2020 and had “obtained proposals and progress reports for NIH grant AI110964 to EcoHealth (the grant that likely funded construction of SARS-CoV-2), and EcoHealth was their subject or target (h/t @R_H_Ebright)” All of which makes the information in the thread below even more alarming. It appears all but certain that the Intelligence Community was lying to the world. Did they lie to Trump as well? The April 2020 “Assessment” described below now makes even less sense. And remember, despite the IC’s claim, there was there was no scientific consensus at the time. But it gets worse. The IC’s August 2021 assessment (more than a year later) still claimed a natural origin. “Four Intelligence Agencies and the National Intelligence Council assess with low confidence that the initial infection was most likely caused by natural exposure to an animal infected with the virus or a closely-related virus.” Only the FBI dissented. Which would seem to indicate the higher levels of our IC, like the National Intelligence Council, knew everything and willfully downplayed the FBI’s information to perpetuate the lie. This seems like a big deal. We deserve some real answers. And some accountability, said [Jeff Carlson](https://x.com/themarketswork/status/1750150681099735179?s=20) Flash Forward to today… The lawmakers underscored their worries about the removal of the goal to lengthen life from the NIH’s mission statement, emphasizing the need for an explanation or justification. They expressed particular concern about the impact on public attitudes toward the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. The senators pointed to the increasing acceptance of physician-assisted suicide in some countries, such as Canada and the Netherlands, as well as certain states in the U.S., highlighting the potential consequences for those with disabilities. Highlighting the importance of treating individuals with disabilities with dignity and respect, the senators acknowledged existing stereotypes and biases in the research and healthcare sectors that hinder accessibility to timely care for people with disabilities. A bipartisan pair of senators wrote a letter expressing concerns with the National Institute of Health’s proposal to remove a vow to “lengthen life” from the agency’s mission statement. [https://t.co/cuMdPBRCpf] — The Hill (@thehill) [January 25, 2024] The senators’ letter was prompted by the NIH’s proposal in August of the preceding year to update its mission statement. The agency’s current mission statement emphasizes seeking fundamental knowledge about living systems, with a commitment to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The proposed change aims to rephrase the mission statement as follows: “To seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and to apply that knowledge to optimize health and prevent or reduce illness for all people.” The Advisory Committee to the Director, established in 2021, recommended this alteration to strengthen disability inclusion and eliminate language related to reducing disability from the NIH mission statement. The committee, in a report from December 2022, expressed concerns about the current mission statement perpetuating ableist beliefs and suggested that it could be interpreted as implying that disabled people need fixing. ‘Important interview by Rand Paul where he documents what he calls an “orchestrated” Wuhan lab-leak coverup and how Anthony Fauci and the CIA are obstructing Congress from investigating years of dual use and bio-weapon funding: “USAID, NIH, HHS, they’re withholding documents because they funded the lab in Wuhan, not just once, not just twice, but for a decade. “We have Anthony Fauci on record as saying that even if gain of function research infects a scientist and a pandemic occurs, that the knowledge would be worth the risk. “There’s a safety committee that was supposed to review this, and Anthony Fauci allowed this research to be done at his signature … without the approval of the safety committee. For this he really should go down in history perhaps as one of the worst people in public office ever and responsible for more deaths than any other individual in the medical world. “We also now know that [Fauci] was visiting the CIA in early 2020. We also know that the CIA scientists, seven of them, voted 6 to 1 to say it came from a lab and then they were reversed by superiors … he wasn’t recorded on visitor logs but he was appearing frequently at the CIA. “He was also in charge of a lot of bio-weapons money, and a lot of things that had dual use, and [the CIA] won’t reveal any of this to us. They had weekly meetings on dangerous dual use research concerns and gain of function, and not one item of any of those meetings has been released to us despite us asking for it for over three years.” said Charlie Kirk.

Sent a letter to the NIH Director with [@SenDuckworth]demanding an explanation. [https://t.co/xKGMEawFPe] — Senator Marco Rubio (@SenMarcoRubio) [January 24, 2024] While the NIH requested responses to the proposal by November 24, 2023, the change to the mission statement has not been finalized. The NIH has far more issues to deal with when it comes to basic honesty. The senators cited a 2022 survey indicating that over 80 percent of U.S. physicians believed that individuals with “significant disability” have a lower quality of life compared to those without disabilities. They raised concerns about the potential for discrimination in recommendations for physician-assisted suicide, given these prevailing views among healthcare professionals. Acknowledging the NIH’s efforts to address healthcare research disparities for people with disabilities, the senators expressed reservations about the proposal to remove “lengthen life” from the mission statement. They commended the NIH for recognizing the existing disparities but emphasized the need for clarity in the mission of the nation’s largest biomedical research funder. Senate duo questions NIH director over proposal to omit ‘lengthen life’ from mission statement [https://t.co/MZk2CC3tJf]via [@thehill] [pic.twitter.com/xFJjGMIFMb] — Charlie 🇺🇸 🍺 (@CharliesTapRoom) [January 25, 2024] To Sum it all Up: the senators requested the NIH to provide an explanation for considering the removal of “lengthen life” and to outline the potential impact on the agency’s research and grant-making priorities. Additionally, they sought details on the guidance that would be given to program officers and other relevant personnel if the proposed change were implemented, questioning whether external groups were consulted in the decision-making process. The senators’ concerns coincide with the ongoing national debate on physician-assisted death, with multiple states exploring legislation to legalize medically assisted death, and efforts to expand legalization persisting despite opposition from religious organizations. The NIH has slowly devolved into an anti-human organization that seems more willing to hide any information which conflicts with Leftist doctrines. They continue to support, with American tax dollars, labs all over the world including in Red China, that are hard at work to develop yet another disease that perhaps the NIH and WEF will roll out as their ‘Disease X’ in an effort to continue to destroy freedom on a global scale and bring about their Great Marxist Reset. As Lara Logan and many others have pointed out, Tony Fauci is a criminal who, through his direct actions, has contributed to the murder of approx. a million Americans who could have been treated with effective and safe drugs like Ivermectin. Lara said take a look at this and your eyes will open wide. See: [NIH Emails Show Fauci Facilitated Lab-Origin Coverup!

The alarm has been raised by a number of pro-democracy figures.

The original article can be found in [Jangan Merusak Demokrasi](https://www.kompas.id/baca/opini/2024/01/25/jangan-merusak-demokrasi) In the near future, the world's attention will be focused on Indonesia with the holding of the democratic party [Elections 2024](https://www.kompas.id/label/pemilu-2024?track_source=automate_body_url), next February. Where is Indonesian democracy headed? What is happening in Indonesia these days is as described by several experts in the book Democracy in Indonesia: From Stagnation to Regression? (Thomas Power and Eve Warburton, ISEAS, Singapore, 2020). After experiencing a stagnation for two terms under the administration of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (2004-2014), democracy in Indonesia has experienced a setback during the era of President Joko Widodo (Jokowi). Since the end of his first term in office, through several political maneuvers, President Jokowi has been deemed to have systematically undermined the pillars of Indonesian democracy. According to Power, \"This trend is particularly evident in the weaponization of law enforcement by the executive, which, at the start of Jokowi's second term, had reached levels as bad as the New Order era.\" Also read: [The Decline of Democracy](https://www.kompas.id/baca/opini/2022/12/21/kemunduran-demokrasi) After being re-elected in 2019, President Jokowi immediately took control of the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), which has been a trusted institution by the public since 2003. They (KPK) are a shining star in the constellation of reform institutions. Their freedom is guaranteed by law. Therefore, the KPK has successfully captured and prosecuted more than 500 corrupt politicians and businessmen. However, after 2019, that legitimacy vanished entirely. A spate of [antidemocratic](https://www.kompas.id/label/antidemokratis?track_source=automate_body_url) actions followed. For example, there are signs of years of efforts to force the replacement of the leadership of the Democratic Party, the party founded by Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY), with TNI General (Ret.) Moeldoko, former TNI Commander, who is now Chief of Presidential Staff. A similar action can be carried out in September 2023, when Kaesang Pangarep, Jokowi's third child, is appointed as the leader of the Indonesian Solidarity Party (PSI), a small party that has been known since 2014 for upholding women's participation in politics. Jokowi is suspected of forcing a revision of the election law meant to enable the removal of governors and regents/mayors in certain regions before their term ends. They would be replaced by government-appointed officials, a type of cawe-cawe that Jokowi had previously used before the term sparked controversy. (Note: the forbidden words are not present in this article.) As President, Megawati and SBY have never shaken the stability of the country through their actions that later provoked doubt about the legitimacy of electoral institutions. During Jokowi's second term in office, more and more TNI officers are being given duties in the civilian government without being required to retire first - a taboo during the reform era. This disrupts the roles of civilians and the military. It reminds us of the dual function of ABRI in practice even though it hasn't been in doctrine yet. In early January 2024, the Information and Electronic Transactions Law (ITE) was revised. According to Muhamad Isnur, the Chairman of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation, \"The revision of the ITE Law still contains problematic articles, such as defamation and defamation of character, hate speech, false information, and access termination. These problematic articles will further threaten the public's right to information and freedom of expression in Indonesia.\" Dangerous move The most dangerous action for democracy in Indonesia occurred on October 16th, 2023. The Constitutional Court (MK), headed by Anwar Usman, has granted the lawsuit that makes Gibran Rakabuming Raka (36), Jokowi's eldest son, officially eligible as a vice presidential candidate paired with presidential candidate from Gerindra Party, Prabowo Subianto. Before this, the Election Law that was in effect did not allow people under the age of 40 to become a presidential or vice-presidential candidate. Jokowi's hand was clearly seen behind the decision, as Anwar Usman is Jokowi's brother-in-law, who married Jokowi's sister on May 26, 2022. Conflict of interest was already raised at that time. Why is this act of nepotism endangering the sustainability of democracy in Indonesia? Nepotism in Indonesian politics has actually been a very common practice at every level of government in Indonesia. Latest example, the appointment of Megawati Soekarnoputri's daughter, Puan Maharani, as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the appointment of SBY's son, Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono, as the Chairman of the Democratic Party. The difference: as presidents, Megawati or SBY never shook the stability of the country through their actions, which later raised doubts about the legitimacy of electoral institutions.

However, the main role is played by the Constitutional Court (MK) as the owner of the final decision-making power according to the 1945 Constitution. Corrupting the MK by Jokowi could result in the collapse of democracy. The alarm is already being sounded by a number of pro-democracy figures within the country, not only by foreign experts. Mahfud MD, in his capacity as Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, admitted to receiving reports regarding [election fraud](https://www.kompas.id/label/kecurangan-pemilu?track_source=automate_body_url) in Jakarta, Bali, East Java, Central Java and North Sumatra. \"The reports I received included allegations of the installation of political party billboards by certain individuals. \"On the other hand, there was a reduction in certain political party billboards which was allegedly carried out by the authorities,\" he said (Kompas, 15/11/2023). Legitimacy of election results The next possibility that could arise is the potential rejection of election results. This was conveyed, among others, by a political observer from the Center for Political Studies at the University of Indonesia (Puskapol UI), Hurriyah. He stated, \"If Prabowo and Gibran win, all parties may think that it was a victory obtained dishonestly, so they will reject the election results. \"Once the election results are rejected, it is not legitimate (Kompas, 15/11/2023).\" Also read: [Saving Our Democracy](https://www.kompas.id/baca/opini/2023/11/22/menyelamatkan-demokrasi-kita) In the end, my concern was sharpened by Philips Vermonte, a senior observer at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Jakarta, who is now the Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences at the International Islamic University of Indonesia. Vermonte has expressed his concern about the increasing potential for post-election conflict in 2024. \"Whoever wins in the first round, someone will definitely sue the Constitutional Court. \"This body has now become a public battle with exciting debate,\" he said at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a well-known think tank in Washington, United States, January 17 2024.

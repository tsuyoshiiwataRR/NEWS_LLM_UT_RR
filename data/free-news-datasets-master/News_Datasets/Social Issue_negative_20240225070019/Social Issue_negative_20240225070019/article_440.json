    "text": "Environmental groups say the EU executive's renewal decision runs contrary to the latest scientific evidence.\nAdvertisement\nA consortium of six NGOs is challenging the European Commission's ten-year extension of the approval of glyphosate, a spokesperson for Pesticide Action Network (PAN) Europe said during a press conference in Brussels today (January), claiming they That this decision fails to comply with EU law. 25).\nPan Europe, ClientEarth EU, Generation Futures, Global 2000, Pan Germany and Pan Netherlands presented their case to the EU Executive on 24 January, citing a number of recent scientific studies that “were ignored during the European Union”. [glyphosate] Approval process”, the spokesperson said.\nThe group claims these studies have shown that the notorious herbicide increases the risk of cancer and insect mortality, and has significant effects on brain and gene function.\nLast November, the Commission renewed its approval of glyphosate use based on safety assessments by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). However, both EU agencies are equally blamed by NGOs for “not paying enough attention to science”.\nIn the case of EFSA, the agency omitted data on the toxicity of glyphosate to insects in its peer review – which, the group claims, industry data shows causes 100% mortality in some cases, the NGO said. Was accused.\nAccording to a statement from Pan Europe, “The Commission has acted against EU law on pesticide approvals and the precautionary principle by re-approving glyphosate despite evidence that the substance harms humans, animals and the environment.” Could.”\nNGOs claimed that the EU assessment “systematically dismisses non-industry studies”, particularly from academics, whom the group said often compare the toxicity of pesticides to industry studies. But let's give more information.\nAccording to NGOs, studies assessing cancer risk and how glyphosate might affect human organs were also rejected.\nDespite a legal obligation to use the latest and reliable science, the consortium has accused the industry on several occasions of omitting key studies, with EU authorities turning a blind eye, preventing accurate and science-based assessment of pesticides' effectiveness. Compromise is being done properly.\nAngelique Lissimachou, head of science and policy at Pan Europe, pointed out that autism spectrum disorders, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, microbiome and gut-brain effects are some of the key shortcomings that have been observed in the public scientific literature and ignored by the EU . Press conference.\n“The re-authorization of glyphosate for 10 years by the European Commission, in collusion with France and other Member States, is a humanitarian, environmental and democratic disaster,” said MEP Manon Aubry (France/The Left). Advocated for and ignored countless evidence of severe poisoning.”\n“This ignores the opposition expressed by 70% of Europeans against European laws on glyphosate and hazardous substances,” Aubry said.\nStefan de Keersmaeker, the European Commission's spokesperson for the European Green Deal and public health and food safety, said the decision was based on “strong science and evidence” from ECHA and EFSA, and added that the EU executive “will respond” to the NGOs. ' The legal challenge followed a “thorough analysis of the claims”.",

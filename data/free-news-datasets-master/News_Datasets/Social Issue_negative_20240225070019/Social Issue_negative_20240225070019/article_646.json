    "text": "VOLUSIA COUNTY, Fla. – An Orange County deputy was arrested on Wednesday over accusations of child abuse, according to the sheriff’s office.\nThe sheriff’s office announced in a news release that the deputy — identified as Tristan Chattic, 39 — was arrested in Volusia County.\nIn an arrest affidavit, Volusia deputies said that they responded to the Fish Memorial Hospital around 9 p.m. after receiving a call about a “domestic violence issue.”\nUpon arrival, they found a woman and her two children, investigators added.\nThe woman told investigators that one of the children was using an electronic tablet to work on homework, which upset Chattic and caused him to unplug the device, the affidavit shows.\n[EXCLUSIVE: Become a News 6 Insider (it’s FREE) | PINIT! Share your photos ]\nHowever, the child plugged the device back in, which made Chattic “extremely angry,” detectives said.\n“(Chattic) stood on her left side, yelling at her about disobeying him, then he struck her on the left side of her face in a type of backhand slap,” the affidavit reads.\nHe reportedly grabbed her hair and choked her before pushing her to the floor, deputies explained.\nInvestigators said they were also told that Chattic then pinned her to the ground by stepping on her back, proceeding to remove his belt and strike her with it.\nAccording to the woman, the child was then brought to the hospital to check for possible injuries, deputies said.\nVolusia deputies said they briefed the Orange County Sheriff’s Office on the incident before meeting with Chattic at his home.\nChattic explained that the child was grounded and had been “disobedient,” prompting him to strike her with the belt, deputies added.\nUltimately, Chattic was taken into custody, and he faces a charge of aggravated child abuse.\n[BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE OF CHATTIC’S ARREST CAN BE VIEWED IN THE MEDIA PLAYER BELOW]\nChattic was originally hired in February 2015, though he has been relieved of all law enforcement duties without pay while the investigation continues, OCSO’s news release states.\n“These are extremely serious criminal allegations. At the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, we hold our deputies to the highest ethical standards whether they are on duty or off duty,” Orange County Sheriff John Mina said in a statement. “I have a zero-tolerance policy toward child abuse — or any form of domestic violence. These allegations will be thoroughly investigated, and the results of that investigation will be made public.”\nDeputies announced that after the criminal proceedings are completed, an administrative investigation will be conducted by the sheriff’s office.\nNo additional information has been provided at this time.\nGet today’s headlines in minutes with Your Florida Daily :\nCopyright 2024 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.",

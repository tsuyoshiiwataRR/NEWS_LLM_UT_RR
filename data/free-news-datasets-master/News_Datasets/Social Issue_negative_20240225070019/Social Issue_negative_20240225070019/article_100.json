    "text": "We've made it past the holidays, but now you might be dealing with a credit card debt hangover from purchasing all of those gifts. With interest rates soaring, a credit card balance transfer to a new card with a lower interest rate could be a solution to tackling your debt this year. It's a move\nBankrate found 37% of people in debt aren't aware of.\nJasmine Johnson, a Credit and Financial Counselor and Entertainment Accountant for Square One Accounting, said a balance transfer is a simple process of moving your credit card debt to a new card with zero interest for a promotional period. The main benefit is lowering the interest you're paying on your credit card debt.\n\"You can pay a one time, in this instance, let's say a 4% fee. A $200 fee on a $5,000 balance. That $200 dollars as opposed to $1,100 in interest, you can get that balance paid off rather quickly if you go that route,\" explained Johnson.\nWhile a balance transfer is an easy process there are five things you'll want to consider before signing up for that new card you got in the mail to make sure it's right for you.\nFirst, Johnson said it's important that you take a look at your budget.\nBefore you can eliminate your debt, you need to know where you stand.\nThe two main things to look at is how much debt you owe and the amount you can afford to put toward your debt each month.\n\"Do the math before you do that balance transfer because you can easily put yourself back in the same situation if the math is not done prior to getting it.\"\nSecond, you'll also want to check your credit score.\nKnowing your score can help you determine what type of balance transfer card you can qualify for or if you need to improve your score before applying.\nThere are many services that offer a free check of your credit score without affecting the score, like\nCredit Karma and Experian.\nMany balance transfer credit cards require good-to-excellent credit to get approval, or a credit score of at least 670.\n\"So, someone with bad credit, I would definitely say contact the creditor directly. It's okay to ask for help, right? Asking if they have any hardship programs, or any other relief like lowering their minimal payment,\" said Johnson.\nThird, once you've crunched the numbers, then it's time to shop around for different cards to find which one will best suit your needs.\nSome credit cards will offer longer 0% interest rate periods while others might have better long term rewards.\nJohnson said you should check with your current bank, local credit unions and major reputable credit companies.\n\"If you're getting those offers in the mail, definitely open them up to at least see what they have to say. At least you're not under a lot of pressure, you can sit at your counter and say okay this is what they're offering.\"\nFourth, it's important to note that not all balance transfers are free.\nCheck to see if the card charges for a balance transfer or requires an annual fee.\n\"You don't want to get a credit card that is then adding more fees that you have to take care of,\" added Johnson.\nOnce you've found a card that fits your budget and goals, there's typically a long sheet that the credit company wants you to read.\nThe fifth thing you need to do is read the fine print.\n\"In there they'll tell you if you miss a payment they are going to void out the agreement that you all have... It's good to read the fine print, those are things that could be hidden in there.\"\nJohnson adds you should also have a plan figured out in case you aren't approved for the full amount or denied completely.\n\"There's nothing wrong with asking for help, asking from friends too. If you have a plan and go to a friend and say 'hey, here's my plan on how I'll pay you back,' that's okay too. There's other 0% APR with friends too.\"\nA balance transfer could help you save hundreds of dollars, but make sure it's right for you. To see if it'll work for you, you should crunch the numbers in a credit card payoff calculator.\nTo use a payoff calculator,\nclick here.",

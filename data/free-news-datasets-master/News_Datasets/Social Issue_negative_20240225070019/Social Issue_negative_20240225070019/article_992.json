    "text": "If, God forbid, anti-public education forces succeed in destroying Oklahoma’s K-12 schools, there’s no doubt who deserves blame: State government Republicans.\nA partisan broadside? No, it’s fact.\nThe GOP not only controls a supermajority of legislative seats, but also holds every statewide office, including two – governor and state superintendent – with considerable stroke over education policy.\nIn the decade-plus since Republicans built their stranglehold, public schools have been in the crosshairs of a toxic mix of teachers’ union haters, religious zealots enraged by the very notion of church-state separation, and privatizers who seek to feed at the taxpayers’ trough.\nState officials’ endless meddling and mandating hasn’t done a thing to improve academic outcomes or create a state attractive to corporate relocation. Instead, between 2012-18, they drove 30,000 trained, experienced teachers from the classrooms – unwilling to continue working for peanuts seasoned with daily doses of disrespect.\nSo far this school year, the state has been forced to issue a record 4,676 emergency teaching certifications to help cover classrooms; it issued just 189 in 2013-14.\nThe Rogues’ Gallery of those complicit in the undermining of Oklahoma’s K-12 schools is headlined, of course, by Gov. Kevin Stitt and state Superintendent Ryan Walters, whose overheated rhetoric, bullying and theatrics are more suited for a WWE ring than actual public policymaking.\nIt also includes mug shots of most GOP lawmakers who turned a blind eye to the siege in what amounts to acts of political self-preservation.\nAs you know, Republican primaries these days often hinge on the turnout of a small, but noisy group of Christian nationalists fueled by extremist GOP rhetoric that “government” schools are “woke” “indoctrination” centers. For many incumbents, it’s less risky politically to go along with the anti-public ed attacks – and hope things don’t get too bad before they are term-limited.\nOf course, nearly three-quarters of a million public school children in Oklahoma are casualties of such political gamesmanship. They count on elected officials to help build a world-class education system that will give future generations a fighting chance to compete in the 21st century.\nInstead, the siege continues.\nWhile some legislators pursue a modest teacher pay raise next fiscal year, Stitt and Republican House Speaker Charles McCall both want to cut the state income tax. Yes, state accounts are flush – for the moment. But there are signs of trouble ahead, hardly surprising given the volatility of oil and gas.\nWhat happens when Oklahoma’s historically boom-bust economy goes bust again?\nStitt and others seem to think private education is the answer. Last year, the governor championed the Statewide Virtual Charter School Board’s decision to create the nation’s first publicly funded religious charter school. He also gave full-throated support to last year’s private school tax credits which disproportionately appear to be benefiting families whose children already were in private schools.\nNotable: two of the three members of the board who voted to create St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Charter are now paid members of Stitt’s administration, Deputy Chief of Staff Brian Bobek and new cabinet secretary for education Nellie Tayloe Sanders.\nWalters, meanwhile, lobbed another Molotov cocktail at public ed this week, appointing out-of-state, rightwing social media influencer Chaya Raichik to a state library media advisory committee because “she is on the front lines showing the world exactly what the radical left is all about – lowering standards, porn in schools, and pushing woke indoctrination on our kids.”\nMark Twain once said “out of public schools grows the greatness of a nation.” Oklahoma’s public schools are imperiled. Will rank-and-file Sooners come to their defense?\n– Arnold Hamilton is editor of The Oklahoma Observer; okobserver.org",

    "text": "Re: “ [Seattle’s South Lake Union streetcar is an empty monument to money](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattles-south-lake-union-streetcar-is-an-empty-monument-to-money/)” [Jan. 24, Local News]: Kudos to Danny Westneat for his column about the economic folly of the money-burning streetcar system. But former Seattle City Councilmember Nick Licata’s suggestion that property owners along the “culture connector” route cover costs of the 7-year project with an assessment, after already being hit with massive assessments for the waterfront project, would be like sending innocent people to jail and then charging them rent. Businesses and tenants along the proposed route are overwhelmingly against the project, citing the permanent elimination of three lanes for traffic flow, all avenue parking, and most passenger and commercial loading zones as existential threats to their livelihoods. Counter to city intentions, it would risk creating new economic dead zones downtown, and drive out anchor tenants such as the Showbox. To achieve “culture connection,” bring back buses to First Avenue, including a route directly from T-Mobile Park to Seattle Center. Jim Margard, Seattle",

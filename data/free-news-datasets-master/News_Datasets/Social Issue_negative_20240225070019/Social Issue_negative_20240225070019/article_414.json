    "text": "Key Points Luis Rubiales kissed player Jenni Hermoso after Spain won the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. She said the kiss was not consensual and later filed a criminal complaint of sexual assault and coercion. A Spanish High Court judge has proposed Rubiales - along with other Spanish football officials - should stand trial. This article contains references to sexual assault.\nA Spanish High Court judge has proposed former football federation chief Luis Rubiales stand trial over the kiss he planted on player Jenni Hermoso's lips after Spain&apos;s victory in the 2023 FIFA Women&apos;s World Cup.\nThe court said in a statement that the judge, Francisco de Jorge, also sought a trial for former women&apos;s team coach Jorge Vilda, as well as Albert Luque, the men&apos;s team&apos;s sport director, and Ruben Rivera, the federation&apos;s marketing chief, for pressuring Hermoso to say the kiss was consensual.\nThe court quoted the judge as saying that, contrary to Rubiales&apos; statements, the investigation showed the kiss \"was not consensual and was a unilateral and surprising initiative\".\nJenni Hermoso is kissed by Luis Rubiales during the FIFA Women's World Cup 2023 Final football match between Spain and England at Stadium Australia in Sydney. (Photo by Noe Llamas / SPP/Sipa USA) Source: SIPA USA / Sports Press Photo Prosecutors and lawyers can still present their arguments, after which the court will decide whether and when to call the trial.\nUp until now, the case has been handled by an investigative judge.\nHermoso - Spain&apos;s all-time top scorer - lodged a criminal complaint of sexual assault and coercion in September over the kiss, saying she felt \"vulnerable and a victim of an aggression\".\nThe case shocked the sporting world and society in Spain and abroad, prompting protests and further accusations by women that prominent or powerful men had forced intimacy on them.\nREAD MORE Jenni Hermoso has testified about Luis Rubiales' World Cup kiss. Here's what happened\nIn Spain, the social media hashtag #SeAcabo (\"It&apos;s over\") became a rallying cry.\nAs well as the kiss itself, the judge found evidence Rubiales and the co-defendants may have committed a related offence in their coordinated action to make Hermoso \"record a video in which she would say the kiss was consensual.\"\nHermoso refused and eventually filed a criminal complaint.\nIf you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732, text 0458 737 732, or visit 1800RESPECT.org.au\n.

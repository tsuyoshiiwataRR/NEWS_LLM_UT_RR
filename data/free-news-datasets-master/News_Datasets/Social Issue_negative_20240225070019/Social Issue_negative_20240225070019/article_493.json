    "text": "Dear Microsoft Customer Support,\nI hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction and frustration with a recent incident involving Microsoft Outlook, which has resulted in the loss of access to my wallet.\nOn 23/01/2023, I attempted to set up Outlook on my Android device. During the setup process, I was prompted to create a PIN for security purposes. Regrettably, without clearly indicating the consequences, Microsoft enforced the PIN I set for Outlook as the default access to my phone. Subsequently, when attempting to access the Outlook app, I mistakenly entered the wrong PIN, leading to an unforeseen change in my phone's access method.\nThis situation is entirely unacceptable, as at no point during the setup process was it communicated that changing my PIN in Outlook would impact the method of accessing my phone. This lack of transparency has resulted in severe consequences for me, including the loss of access to essential financial resources stored in my wallet.\nIn light of the distressing circumstances caused by this oversight, I am seeking financial compensation from Microsoft to cover the losses I have incurred. I believe it is essential for Microsoft to take responsibility for the serious mistake in the setup process and the subsequent impact on my personal and financial well-being.\nIf a satisfactory resolution is not reached promptly, I feel compelled to share my unfortunate experience on various social media platforms, ensuring that the public is made aware of the potential risks associated with downloading Outlook onto their devices.\nI kindly request that Microsoft thoroughly investigates this matter and provides compensation for the financial losses and inconvenience I have experienced. I expect a swift and fair resolution to this issue.\nPlease contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss the details further and to provide information on the steps Microsoft plans to take to rectify this situation.\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\nSincerely,\nJorge",

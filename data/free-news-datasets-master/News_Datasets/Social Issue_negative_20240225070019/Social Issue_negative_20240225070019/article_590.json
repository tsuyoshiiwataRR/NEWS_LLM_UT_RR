NEA will not hesitate to take strict enforcement action against any person who disposes of waste illegally,” said the agency.\nFor his actions, Siow could have been fined up to $50,000 or jailed for up to 12 months.\nA repeat offender can be fined up to $100,000 and be jailed anywhere between one and 12 months.\nSingapore 3 reported dengue deaths in Q4 2023; infections still rising Jan 24, 2024 Related Stories Makeshift smoking corners in heartland not illegal, but smokers should be considerate Highest number of dengue cases in over a year, but recent heavy rains may see fall in cases Seasonal high tides flood Pulau Ubin, stretches along East Coast Park over the weekend NEA said that as at July 1, 2023, causing or permitting the dumping or disposal of waste in a public place is an offence and that enforcement action can be taken against supervisors who instruct their workers to do so.\nThe public can report suspected illegal disposals via the NEA’s online feedback form, the myENV mobile app or call its hotline on 1800-CALL-NEA (1800-2255-632).\nWhen reporting a suspected illegal disposal, the public can help the authorities by giving details such as the date, time and location as well as the registration number of vehicles involved, as well as supporting photos or video clips.\n ",

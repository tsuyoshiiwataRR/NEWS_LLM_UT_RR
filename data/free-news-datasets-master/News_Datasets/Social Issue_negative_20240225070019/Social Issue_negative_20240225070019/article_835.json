    "text": "It’s not enough for progressives to alter how America views gender and sexuality. Now, they want to change the meaning of yet another word: [Virginity](https://redstate.com/brandon_morse/2023/06/30/the-lefts-latest-attack-on-virginity-is-the-latest-attempt-to-get-at-your-children-n769554). [Planned Parenthood](https://redstate.com/tags/planned-parenthood) released a video on Thursday arguing that the traditional understanding of the concept of virginity is inaccurate. According to the [video](https://youtu.be/ozhO62z2nag?si=7YM9NcHDCq4O68Iy), virginity is not necessarily someone who has not had sex, but something more. “Virginity is a completely made-up concept,” the woman in the video explains. “It’s a term that was created simply to control and shame people, mainly women.” She goes on to explain that “another reason the idea of virginity is complete nonsense is that sex means different things to different people,” and that “society tends to define sex in a very narrow way.” She adds: Warning: contains sexual terms Generally speaking, society tends to define sex in a very narrow way. Penetration, penis into vagina. But where does that definition leave queer people or folks who can't or don't have penis and vagina sex and choose to have oral, anal, or another type of sex instead? The woman continues, highlighting the double standard society places on women versus men when it comes to sex and virginity. There is also a double standard on who carries the burden of virginity. Society puts pressure on men for not having sex at the exact same time, they shame women for having it. Make it make sense. Either way, shame has no place in someone's personal decisions about sex. Near the end of the video, the woman argues that it is “time to throw away the notion of losing your virginity.” We hope we are gaining things like intimacy, self insight, pleasure, and empowerment. All of these myths around sex and virginity can be so hurtful and overwhelming. But here's the one truth you should remember. Sex is defined by one thing and one thing only, you. Maybe that's being fingered for the first time. Maybe it's having anal sex. Maybe it's having your first orgasm. Maybe it's masturbating for the first time or when you enthusiastically consent to sex. That's the beauty of your sexual journey. Virginity! What is it? What it isn't. And what’s the big deal about \"losing\" it? Let’s talk about it:— Planned Parenthood (@PPFA) [https://t.co/pOQllDfAHo] [pic.twitter.com/yANUxTaF8s] [January 25, 2024] The woman made some valid points, when it comes to the double standard related to virginity. But the rest of her diatribe was just more far-leftist claptrap intended to challenge traditional norms. This is an effort to dismiss the value that many cultures and individuals place on the concept of virginity. The concept carries significant emotional, cultural, and religious meaning for many people around the world who value the idea of being sexually abstinent until marriage. If someone doesn’t believe in this concept, then they do not have to practice it. But the notion that Planned Parenthood and others would try to completely transform the definition of the word is yet another way the far left seeks to foist their ideology onto the rest of the country.",

    "text": "The Alberta Junior Hockey League has cancelled all upcoming games involving five teams poised to bolt to a rival junior A circuit and its 11 remaining clubs. The B.C. Hockey League announced Saturday the Blackfalds Bulldogs, Brooks Bandits, Okotoks Oilers, Sherwood Park Crusaders and Spruce Grove Saints will come under its umbrella in 2024-25. The AJHL scratched four games off its schedule earlier this week before Thursday's announcement. The league said in a statement it is \"taking steps to protect the integrity of the AJHL and (Canadian Junior Hockey League) playoff system\" along with ensuring \"the safety of our players and officials.\" The five teams heading to the BCHL will still be allowed to play scheduled games against one another \"out of respect for the players,\" the AJHL said. The BCHL cut ties with Hockey Canada — the sport's national governing body — in May. The league said at the time the move toward an independent setup would provide more options for players looking to compete in U.S. college hockey. The CJHL is a step below the top-tier Canadian Hockey League, which includes the Western Hockey League, Ontario Hockey League and Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 25, 2024. The Canadian Press",

The consignment of border controlled drugs, which departed from Germany, was identified by Australian Border Force (ABF) officers on 29 December, 2023 and referred to the AFP for investigation. AFP officers seized the drugs and a forensic deconstruction of the consignment revealed 211 packages inside 10 cardboard boxes hidden alongside packing equipment. The packages contained a total of 156.8kg of methamphetamine. Investigations are underway to identify those behind the importation, with calls for public assistance to assist the investigation. AFP Detective Acting Superintendent Colin Hunt said the methylamphetamine had the potential to inflict immeasurable harm on members of the community. “Transnational drug syndicates which attempt to flood Australia with border controlled drugs are motivated solely by greed and personal gain,” he said. “There is little or no regard to the pain and suffering these harmful drugs inflict on people, their families, and their communities. “Across Australia, there were 10,100 methamphetamine-related hospitalisations in 2021-2022 – which equates to more than 27 every day on average*. “This seizure of such a significant quantity of border controlled drugs showcases the value of the AFP, alongside our law enforcement partners, in protecting Australian borders. “If you know anything about this consignment, please contact Crime Stoppers on 1300 333 000 or via crimestoppers.com.au.” ABF Acting Commander Asha Patwardhan said ABF officers played a vital frontline role in protecting the Australian community from the supply of harmful drugs like methylamphetamine. “Whether these attempted importations occur by air or sea, the intelligence and technology at our disposal is increasingly sophisticated and evolving to detect and disrupt attempts to bring illicit drug into the country,” Acting Commander Patwardhan said. *Source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare analysis of the National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD).

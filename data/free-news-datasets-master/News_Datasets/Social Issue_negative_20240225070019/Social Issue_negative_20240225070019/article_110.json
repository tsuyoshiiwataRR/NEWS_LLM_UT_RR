    "text": "Sales at Italian luxury goods group Salvatore Ferragamo dropped by 8.1 percent at constant currencies last year, prompting chief executive Marco Gobbetti to warn that hitting turnaround goals could take longer than anticipated.\nRevenues reached €1.16 billion in 2023, a touch above the €1.15 billion estimated by analysts according to an LSEG consensus.\nWith a 17 percent plunge in revenues, the North American region was the biggest drag last year, only partly offset by a 3.4 percent increase in revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa.\nThe Asia Pacific area saw an 8.3 percent drop in revenue at constant exchange rates.\nAsia Pacific accounts for nearly one third of group revenues, followed by North America and Europe which are similar in size at around a quarter of the total.\n“The complex market environment with the slowdown of luxury demand may impact the timing of our initial assumptions, nevertheless the commitment to our ambition is unchanged,” the CEO said in a statement.\nShortly after joining two years ago from Burberry, Gobbetti promised a quick turnaround of the Florentine group, aiming to reach almost €2.3 billion in sales by 2026.\nBy Elisa Anzolin, editing by Gavin Jones and Valentina Za\nLearn more:\nFerragamo’s Sales Decline in First Half\nSales at Italian luxury goods group Salvatore Ferragamo declined by 7.2 percent at constant currencies in the first half, hit by double-digit drops in both North America and Asia Pacific, the company said on Thursday.",

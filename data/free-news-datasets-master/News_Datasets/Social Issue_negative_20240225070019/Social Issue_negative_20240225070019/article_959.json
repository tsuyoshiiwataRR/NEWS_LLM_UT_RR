    "text": "The \"Predatory Trade Practices Act\" is a deeply flawed proposal that would expose thousands of South Carolina’s most financially vulnerable citizens to the kinds of predatory lending practices the bill’s sponsors and advocates claim they want to prevent. The bill, S.910, also would impose additional burdensome restrictions on South Carolina installment lenders that would significantly reduce the availability of safe, affordable credit to more than 45% of low-incomes households throughout the state. For more than a century, credit-building loans like traditional installment loans have served as effective and beneficial economic tools to empower S.C. households, particularly those consumers who do not have strong credit histories. S.910 contains many unnecessary if not ill-informed provisions. For example, it would bar installment lenders from using text messaging to market to consumers. There’s one problem: Installment lenders are already barred from using text messages under the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Similarly, the bill requires installment lending companies like mine, which are not banks or credit unions, to undertake analysis of prospective borrowers’ ability to repay a loan before making the loan. But all licensed installment lenders in the state already do this through an underwriting process that is more rigorous than the bill’s requirements, and usually includes face-to-face meetings between the borrower and installment lender. Such hands-on customer care is never more apparent than in the convenience check, or \"live check\" process. These are checks mailed to select consumers who have been evaluated for a history of credit repayment. Once a customer deposits a convenience check and activates the loan, one of our local customer service staff works directly with the borrower to review terms of the loan, ensuring the customer fully understands the transaction. Every check is clearly marked as a loan and as an installment loan is subject to stringent federal and state oversight. We adhere to the Federal Truth in Lending Act requiring standard disclosure of annual percentage rates, finance charges, amount financed and total payments and terms, all found in a bold, bordered box on the front page at the top of every credit disclosure. S.910 would not apply to banks or credit unions that use some of the same practices that the bill claims it wants to end. Common sense dictates that a bill that bars what it calls “predatory practices” from one set of lenders should include all lenders. S.910 instead picks winners and losers in the market, while imposing real financial harm on tens of thousands of South Carolinians. Unlike most small-dollar loan products at credit unions, installment loans are not secured by a borrower’s checking and savings account, home or vehicle. Credit unions also market credit products to low-income consumers that include as many as 45 different monthly and annual junk fees. Installment lenders do not require a borrower to provide access to their savings or checking accounts, and there are no hidden fees. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reports that more than 26% of S.C. households are either unbanked or underbanked, meaning they have severely limited access to bank services and look to non-bank sources for the credit they need to avoid hardship and build a positive credit history. Yet credit unions require costs to open an account, sometimes with the full amount of what a consumer wishes to borrow deposited to secure the loan. How do these onerous requirements help consumers in need of greater financial flexibility, not less? But credit unions are exempted from S.910. By steering consumers toward loan alternatives at credit unions, policymakers are limiting consumers to options that can trap borrowers in a cycle of debt. Such products often take years to pay off with minimum payments, are subject to fluctuating interest rates, come with frequently changing terms and conditions and end up costing borrowers significantly more over time. Traditional installment loans, on the other hand, have clear terms, consistent monthly payments with a payoff date. They have no hidden fees or balloon payments. South Carolina’s installment lenders are committed to serving the customers who rely on them. We also commit to working with policymakers on additional consumer protections that offer borrowers greater confidence and choices that benefit their financial needs. Unfortunately, S.910 accomplishes none of these goals. Legislators should start from scratch and work with all parties invested in ensuring all our citizens have access to fair, transparent and affordable credit. J.

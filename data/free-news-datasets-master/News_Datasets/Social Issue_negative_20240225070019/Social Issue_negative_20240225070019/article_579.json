    "text": "January 15 – Under pressure, South Korean talisman Son Heung-Min has called on the criticism of the team to cool down, arguing that some of it has crossed a line.\nThe Spurs striker was man of the match following a disappointing 3-3 draw against Malaysia that saw South Korea claim second spot in Group E behind Bahrain who defeated Jordan 1-0.\nPressure however is mounting on the Koreans to deliver a performance worthy of a title challenger.\n“I would like to ask for a favour … to protect the players during the tournament and just to help the team. It is really sad, it really hurts a lot in the locker room,” said Son.\n“Some of the boys are being criticised or receiving comments that at times cross the line a little. It really hurts as a teammate. It really hurts to see these boys in pain and also getting this criticism.\n“We are working very hard on the pitch. We are trying to give everything for the fans, for the country … Please protect the players, my team mates and the team. Before they are a player, they are a person. They have families back home, with kids,” he continued.\nSouth Korea last won the Asian Cup in 1960, but drawing twice in three matches and shipping six goals in a modest group has cast doubts over their credentials as one of the tournament favourites. The Koreans have individual talent in abundance, but they haven’t demonstrated much cohesion in their play as a team.\nSon said the draw with Malaysia serves as a wake-up call before the Koreans meet Saudi Arabia in the round of 16.\n“When you go into the tournament, there are no favourites because there will always be underdogs that catch you out,” said Son.\n“For Asian football, it is really good that this competition is becoming even harder. Everybody is more interested in this competition now, which is a very good sign. It was a tough result to take but it’s a big credit to the Malaysian team, they fought until the end and I was very pleased for Asian football.”\nContact the writer of this story at\n[moc.l1706218659labto1706218659ofdlr1706218659owedi1706218659sni@g1706218659niwe.1706218659yrrah1706218659](javascript:;)",

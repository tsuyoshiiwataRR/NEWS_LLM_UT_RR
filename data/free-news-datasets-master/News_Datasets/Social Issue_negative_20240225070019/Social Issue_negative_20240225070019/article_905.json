    "text": "[Tucker Carlson](https://thepostmillennial.com/tucker-carlson-tells-canadians-you-should-dislike-and-resist-justin-trudeau-and-his-government-to-the-maximum-extent-of-your-ability)'s two stop tour of Alberta rustled a few feathers within the Liberal Party, with many, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, dropping his name as the Caucus met in Ottawa on Thursday. The pack of politicians criticized Carlson for what he said on stage, with Environment Minister [Steven Guilbeault](https://thepostmillennial.com/trudeaus-environment-minister-crashes-conservative-party-convention-to-call-poilievre-a-climate-change-denier)even going so far as to suggest that the former Fox News host and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith's calling him out amounted to an \"incite[ment] of violence.\" \"This goes beyond me and the fact that I was targeted last night at this event,\" [Guilbeault](https://thepostmillennial.com/jordan-peterson-slams-guilbeault)said when asked by reporters on his way to the Caucus. \"This increases political violence against everyone who runs for office in this country.\" Guilbeault said there was nothing wrong with differences of opinion, but said Carlson and Smith crossed a line by \"incit[ing] violence] against people who disagree with [them].\" When pressed on exactly what was said that amounted to such a charge, the minister stumbled, suggesting the mere targeting of an opponent was enough. Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez called the events \"not acceptable,\" and appeared to dismiss the fact that with 4,000 people in attendance, those who wanted to hear Carlson speak are far from a fringe minority. \"The extreme-right politics,\" he said. \"Don't ask the question if it's coming to Canada. It's already here, and they're bringing it.\" Trudeau kicked off his address on Thursday by suggesting that his rival, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, was not as vehement in his support for Ukraine because he was trying to \"appease Putin-apologists like Tucker Carlson.\" According to the [CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-cabinet-ministers-danielle-smith-tucker-carlson-1.7094854), during the event in Calgary on Wednesday, Smith and Carlson were discussing the province's environmental policies when the former told the latter about Guilbeault. \"He's an environmental zealot,\" Smith said of Guilbeault, who once illegally [climbed](https://thepostmillennial.com/steven-guilbeault-refuses-to-say-how-activist-past-will-influnce-enviroment-mandate)the CN Tower to protest Canada's inaction over climate change. \"He believes he has the expertise and knowledge to tell us how to run our power grid.\" \"I wish you would put Steven Guilbeault in your crosshairs,\" she added. Carlson responded by saying that based on her description of Guilbeault, he didn't sound like someone he wanted to know.

    "text": "BNP Senior Joint Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi on Thursday described the new education policy and school curriculum as anti-national, saying it will only destroy the education system. “The government is going to destroy the education system of the country by introducing anti-national curriculum in the new education system,” he said. Speaking at a press briefing at the party’s Nayapaltan central office, the BNP leader also accused the government of trying to make the students forget their national existence with the new school curriculum. [Koko’s 9th death anniversary Wednesday ](https://unb.com.bd/category/Politics/kokos-9th-death-anniversary-wednesday/129679) \"The new education policy and the curriculum are contrary to the culture and values of the country. If the new educational policy and curriculum are implemented, the education system of the country will be destroyed,” he said. Rizvi also said the government is trying to put the national existence at stake with the new school curriculum in a very well-planned and very cunning way. Whenever the Awami League comes to power, he said democracy and freedom of speech are snatched and the education system is designed to make the new generation subservient to others. The BNP leader claimed that the nation has been pushing towards destruction by implementing a new curriculum that is not universal as it has been formulated imitating the curriculum of a country. He also said the education curriculum has been introduced with a deceitful political motive as a part of a plot to make the independence and sovereignty of the country dependent and to break the backbone of the nation. “The nation has turned down the new curriculum with hatred.” Rizvi said the government earlier tried to do something new by introducing creative methods after spending thousands of crores of taka, but it finally turned unsuccessful. “The science education has been compressed through new educational policy and curriculum and the attempts to inculcate moral values through religious education have been completely ignored. Attempts have also been made to pervert the adolescent mind by introducing sex education in the name of health protection education,” he observed. ['India deepened ties with AL, not people of Bangladesh': Rizvi](https://unb.com.bd/category/Politics/india-deepened-ties-with-al-not-people-of-bangladesh-rizvi/129607) The BNP leader said a drastic shrinkage of science education is visible in the new education curriculum and voiced concern that the removal of pure sciences such as physics, chemistry and biology from the secondary level will create obstacles in the way of building a science-minded generation. He also said Bangladesh will fail to play a role in career-based knowledge, science, technology and medical science at global standards if the new curriculum is implemented. Besides, Rizvi said online use has been expanded in the curriculum, but online education is not perfect at all levels. “The children and teenagers can indulge in various misdeeds, illegal games, online gambling, Facebook, YouTube, Tik Tok, porn sites while collecting information using various devices (mobile and tab).” He said online can be used in education programmes only during various natural disasters and emergencies like the coronavirus period.",

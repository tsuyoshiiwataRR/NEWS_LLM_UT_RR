    "text": "One man is not playing around when it comes to his girl and how he expects her to be treated by others.\nTikTok users Joey and Tessa (@joeyandtessa) went viral after Joey called out a wedding dress company for how his bride-to-be was treated on what was supposed to be a special day.\n“My beautiful gorgeous strong confident future bride, Tessa, went to buy a wedding gown dress […] which is supposed to be one of the most magical days of her life,” he said in a video that has garnered over three million views in three days.\nHe goes on to say that a staff member told Tessa that the undergarments came in two options.\n“The standardized choice is nude, which is free, but [the employee said] if you would like the undergarments to match your skin tone there’s an upcharge.”\n“So you’re telling me that it’s free to be white? But if my bride has a different skin tone than white she has to pay extra money,” he continued.\nHe also wonders why the standard was white in the first place in 2024? He also points out that the colour nude can come in a range of options but they decided to make it one singular one.\nHe understands that the employees are not the designers, however, they still enforced this “ridiculous” rule and Tessa was left to stand there all awkward and uncomfortable.\nIn the end, Tessa decided to take the free undergarments and will dye it to match her skin complexion.\nThe reaction to the situation was immense and users came with the same energy Joey had and were quick to agree with him.\nEven owners and employees from bridal shops were pointing out red flags.\n“As a bridal boutique owner even if the designer charges me NO WAY am I passing that cost onto the bride! I can’t believe they said that to a bride,” one user shared.\n“I work in a wedding dress store, and this is f**g bull**. They are fully doing that on purpose. That’s ridiculous. I’m pissed for you,” another said.\nOthers were glad this queen had a king by her side to bring attention to the issue.\n“He’s a good man Savannah…he’s a GOOD MAN!,” one person wrote.\n“I’m so glad she’s marrying you. Love that you’re defending her on this,” another said.",

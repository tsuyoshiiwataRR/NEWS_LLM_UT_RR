    "text": "A much-debated mass rezoning ordinance in New Castle County will be withdrawn, according to its sponsor. Councilman David Tackett said Thursday that concerns raised by the public and by County Executive Matt Meyer have led him to take the ordinance off the table. Tackett is asking that the County Land Use Department present alternative paths forward during the Land Use Committee meeting scheduled for February 6th. The ordinance would be formally withdrawn at County Council's meeting February 13th. Tackett said he believes a new approach could break up the proposed rezonings into manageable parts that can be \"more fully and expeditiously considered by County Council, as well as the public\" “I’ve heard all the public has to say and feel that it is of the utmost importance that we step back and re-evaluate. I feel that this is in the best interests of the County and its residents,\" Tackett said in a statement. Tackett also called for \"increased involvement of surrounding communities and a more robust effort to engage the public with the parcels that impact the quality of life.\"",

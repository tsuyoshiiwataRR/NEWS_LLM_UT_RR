    "text": "As of Jan. 26, Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a notable decline, slipping below the $40,000 mark before a partial recovery. Despite the rebound, BTC remains 19% below its post-Spot Bitcoin ETF approval high. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has warned of a [further dip](https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1750412686591225924) to $38,130. He predicts that such a downturn could trigger [panic selling](https://cryptomode.com/news/crypto/4-reasons-why-hedge-fund-involvement-wont-benefit-cryptocurrency/) among short-term investors. He notes that breaching this threshold would result in losses for short-term BTC holders, leading to a new wave of panic selling. Bitcoin (BTC) Future Trend While the crypto analyst acknowledges the current bearish turn, he expects the [Bitcoin bull cycle](https://cryptomode.com/news/bitcoin-bulls-hold-strong-at-44k/) to peak in late 2025. Comparing historical patterns, he suggests that BTC is mirroring previous bull runs, with market projections indicating a potential peak in Oct. 2025. If [#Bitcoin]'s price falls below $38,130, short-term [$BTC]holders could find themselves in the red. This potential [#BTC]dip might trigger a new wave of panic selling as these holders will seek to minimize losses. [pic.twitter.com/TnAH67DPV6] — Ali (@ali_charts) [January 25, 2024] He reassures long-term [Bitcoin HODLers](https://cryptomode.com/news/crypto-strategist-bitcoin-tourists-hodlers/) of approximately 600 more days of bullish momentum before the cycle tops. Emphasizing the historical pattern of BTC price corrections followed by upswings, the analyst advises traders to leverage the “ [buy the dip](https://cryptomode.com/featured/solanas-price-dynamics-is-sol-buy-the-dip-worthy/)” opportunity for potential gains. Currently trading around $39,850, BTC struggles to sustain above $40,000, [facing pullbacks](https://cryptomode.com/news/crypto-industry-soars-108-percent-market-cap/) after attempted rebounds. Despite a 0.25% increase at press time, the 24-hour trade volume plummeted 29.57% to $20.09 billion. The market cap sits at $786.18 billion. The crypto analyst highlights the significance of the $38,000 threshold on the weekly chart, cautioning that a close below this level may signal a potential downturn targeting strong support around $33,000. This critical zone is defined by key technical indicators, forming a [significant defense](https://in.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/technicals/) line against further [price declines](https://cryptomode.com/news/celsius-sell-off-sends-eth-price-down/). Based on the current analysis, the analyst concludes that a drop below $32,000 is not imminent.

    "text": "Belfast City Hall\nA request by Belfast Council to the government of the Irish Republic to host the National Famine Memorial Day 2024 has been slapped down by Dublin after it emerged only Leinster applications were being accepted.\nAt a recent City Hall committee meeting SDLP Councillor Carl Whyte described as “very annoying” the system of provincial rotation used by the government in the Republic for hosting the memorial, which was held in Ulster last year, in Donegal.\nLast September he forwarded a motion at the Belfast City Council Standards and Business Committee, not realising only Leinster bodies could apply for the job.\nThe SDLP motion stated: ““This council recognises the tragic and historic impact of the Great Famine/An Gorta Mór, which affected the entire island between 1845 to 1852 and resulted in the death of nearly one million people and the forced emigration of at least a further one million.\n“As the island’s second largest city, Belfast and its citizens were directly affected by the Famine, through death and the emigration of people from all backgrounds who lived both here and in the surrounding towns and countryside.\n“Alongside these tragic events, various citizens led relief efforts in Belfast and across Ulster and Ireland, saving men, women and children from death by starvation.\n“As a first step towards a regular remembrance of the tragedy and events of the Great Famine, the Council will write to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to request that Belfast host, in 2024, the National Famine Memorial Day, which takes place every May.\n“This will be only the second time that the event is held in Northern Ireland and the first time that it is held in Ireland’s second city and can play an important role in commemorating the tragic events of that period.”\nOn 21 December 2023, the Chief Executive of Belfast City Council received a response from the Dublin department stating it has a policy of rotating the province that the commemoration is held in each year, and that last year the commemoration was held in Milford, County Donegal.\nThe letter from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media in Dublin states: “In line with the policy of rotating the province the commemoration is held in each year, we are currently in the process of identifying a host county from Leinster for the 2024 event.\n“To this end, we will be inviting applications from all Local Authorities in Leinster who may be interested in hosting the 2024 National Famine Commemoration. Unfortunately we will not be inviting applications from Ulster for 2024, but as the Commemoration will be due to take place in the province again in a number of years the Department will keep your expression of interest on file for consideration.”\nAt the recent meeting of the Belfast City Council Strategic Policy and Resources Committee SDLP Councillor Carl Whyte said: “Unfortunately (we were) unsuccessful because they have a very annoying rotating system, where it goes by a different province every year. We are obviously not on the rostrum at the moment.\n“But I would like to say two things, we had cross party support for this, from all the parties around this table, and the work that (council officers) did was outstanding.”\nHe added: “I know I go on about this a lot, but when you read into the history of this in our city – and there is a very good book called “Hidden Famine” – you will see how communities came together. A detail that is very touching is that there was a group of yarn spinners that raised money for people who were living destitute in Ballymacarrett.”\nHe said: “I don’t think people are aware of the impact the famine had on this city. People in this city were walking around dying in the streets, from all sides of all communities. Only a brief read and you will see how our ancestors were impacted.”\nIt is the second time this month the SDLP at Belfast City Hall have been met with a Dublin government who were not in a position to accede to requests made by Belfast Council. Earlier in January Dublin made a non-committal response to a request from Belfast Council to have Northern Ireland beauty spots included in the design for the new Irish passport.\nIt was based on an agreed motion which came from the SDLP. In a response from the Office of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin, no reference at all was made to the actual request from Belfast Council, and information given on the consultation dates hinted that City Hall had been too late in their appeal to the Irish government.\nThe letter from Dublin said: “As part of the redesign process, the Department of Foreign Affairs sought input from the public on aspects of Ireland’s diverse natural environment, which will feature as part of the new passport book and card design. This public consultation was conducted for an initial two-week period from June 27 to July 11 2023.\n“Due to the large take-up by the public, as well as to allow for more contributions, the consultation period was extended for an additional week and concluded on July 19 2023.”\nBelfast City Council sent its request regarding the passport design to Dublin in November 2023.\nFor all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our daily newsletter here.",

    "text": "Joe Biden went to Duluth, Minnesota, on Thursday to talk about the bipartisan infrastructure law. He also visited a beer factory in Superior, Wisconsin. I think his introduction might have immediately raised a few eyebrows, when Governor Tony Evers introduced him as \"the Big Guy.\" üëÄ Democrat Gov. Tony Evers: \"I am the last speaker before the Big Guy comes out...\"‚Äî RNC Research (@RNCResearch) [pic.twitter.com/Rz9IGRjAOQ] [January 25, 2024] \"The big guy\" was the reference often made to Joe Biden in the Hunter Biden laptop messages. Perhaps not the best thing to do to confirm the nickname. I'm not sure that a brewery is necessarily the best place for Biden to visit and I don't know if he sampled any of the product, but he sounded even worse than normal--when it's already bad enough. He spoke about the \"bipartishan infrashrushure law\" tripping over the words, trying to use it as an argument for why people should vote for him. He's hoping to pull in Wisconsin, typically a swing state. BIDEN (mumbling): \"Bipartishan infrashrushure law\"‚Äî RNC Research (@RNCResearch) [pic.twitter.com/ybHwT13IBH] [January 25, 2024] People joke with me that I've become a bit of a Biden \"whisperer\" because after reporting on him for so long now, I can generally figure out what he's saying even if it's incredibly garbled. But this time, I admit defeat. I can tell you the words here. But the sense? There doesn't seem to be any. This is more scary stuff. Biden is having a VERY tough time reading from his giant teleprompter today üò≥‚Äî RNC Research (@RNCResearch) [pic.twitter.com/EFKvUwIebn] [January 25, 2024] \"The beer brewed here...It is used to make the brewed beer [intelligible] Oh, Earth Rider. Thanks for the Great Lakes. I wonder why,‚Äù Biden said. Even though that makes absolutely no sense, people laughed and seemed to think everything was just fine. How could anyone listen to that and not be very worried about what's going on here? He continued in confusion. Professor? Predecessor? That's pretty much the same thing, right? BIDEN v. TELEPROMPTER: \"My professor, uh, well, I won't get into my professor. But, look, my predecessor, though...\"‚Äî RNC Research (@RNCResearch) [pic.twitter.com/bwBqk1Gb2K] [January 25, 2024] Trump can teach him a few things. Once again, he has absolutely no idea what he's saying. Biden brags about creating \"169 new jobs in Wisconsin\" during his presidency‚Äî RNC Research (@RNCResearch) [pic.twitter.com/9QeA0T8I10] [January 25, 2024] 169 jobs? Does he hate Wisconsin? How do you listen to that and think this guy is okay? He's also shouting and screaming a lot more, another bad sign. Biden randomly starts screaming during his remarks in Wisconsin‚Äî RNC Research (@RNCResearch) [pic.twitter.com/wVQYNqOPXR] [January 25, 2024] Then when he finally wrapped up, he left the stage and stopped momentarily to \"listen\" to a barrel of beer. How weird is this? SUCH VIGOR! Biden ends his speech, stops to listen to a barrel of beer, and shuffles out of the room‚Äî RNC Research (@RNCResearch) [pic.twitter.com/81I4HbVkqk] [January 25, 2024] But as he drove away, he got one interesting message shouted at him from the bystanders. President Biden leaving Earth Rider Brewery after giving remarks there about the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes a historic $1B for the replacement of the Blatnik Bridge. We'll have team coverage on FOX 21 Local News at 5:30 p.m. and 9 p.m.‚Äî Dan Hanger (@DanHanger) [pic.twitter.com/8rkR97xxDg] [January 25, 2024] \"Free Jan. 6!\" a woman shouted, referring to the Jan. 6 defendants who are now imprisoned or in jail awaiting trial.

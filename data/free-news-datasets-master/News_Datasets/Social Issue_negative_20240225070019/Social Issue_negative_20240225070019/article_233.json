    "text": "The dissatisfaction of education employees is increasing day by day. The representative trade union federations in education have conveyed that the attitude of the Ministry of Finance to refuse approval of the memorandum regarding the filling of vacant positions in 2023 is \"abusive\" and \"contemptuous\". Haret' and the National Trade Union Federation \"Alma Mater' - representative trade union federations at the pre-university education and higher education collective bargaining sector level - consider the attitude of the Ministry of Finance to refuse approval of the memorandum regarding the filling of the positions vacancies in the year 2023. In total disregard for the legal provisions in force - respectively those of Article XVII paragraph (5) of Law No. 296/2023 and Article VII paragraph (3) of O.U.G. No. 115/2023 (which allow, by means of a Government memorandum, to approve the filling of positions that become vacant in 2023, respectively allow the filling of positions that become vacant/temporarily vacant in 2024) - the draft memorandum initiated by the Ministry of Education for the filling of vacant positions in education is blocked by the Ministry of Finance, until the date on which the situation regarding the vacant positions, at the national level, in pre-university and higher education, until the year 2025 is transmitted\". Also, the trade unionists draw attention to the fact that the smooth development of the educational process, both in pre-university education and in higher education, requires the provision of the necessary human resources, depending on the needs, regardless of the nature of the position that has been or will be vacant. At the same time, the three federations remind the \"decision-makers\" that the protest actions in the spring and summer of last year were generated by the general state of dissatisfaction of employees in education, \"systematically disregarded in recent years\": \"It must not be forgotten that one of the problems raised was the lack of personnel, trade union federations constantly requesting the provision of qualified and sufficient human resources, regardless of the nature of the position\". The Federation of Free Trade Unions in Education, the Federation of Trade Unions in Education \"Spiru Haret\" and the National Trade Union Federation \"Alma Mater\" believe that the Government of Romania must have \"as a priority\" the good functioning of the educational system, including by ensuring qualified and sufficient human resources.\nTrade unionists from education put the \"cannons\" on the Ministry of Finance\nO.D.\n[English Section](/english-section) / 26 ianuarie",

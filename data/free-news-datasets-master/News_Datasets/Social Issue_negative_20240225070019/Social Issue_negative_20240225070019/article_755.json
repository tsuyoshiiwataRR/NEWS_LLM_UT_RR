    "text": "Middletown cop charged with shoplifting $500 in merchandise: Monmouth County Prosecutor [Erik Larsen](/staff/2647814001/erik-larsen/) FREEHOLD – A Middletown police officer is charged with shoplifting about $500 in merchandise from multiple locations of a discount store chain, in one instance while in uniform, according to the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office. Brenden B. Santiago, 36, of Tinton Falls, faces one count of third-degree shoplifting and one count of fourth-degree attempted shoplifting. The incidents are alleged to have occurred in December and earlier this month, according to a statement. An investigation by the Professional Responsibility Unit of the Prosecutor’s Office and the Middletown Police Department determined that Santiago “skip-scanned” items, “essentially scanning multiple less-expensive items and not scanning more-expensive items — or pretending to scan them and leaving the store without paying for them on six different occasions,” the Prosecutor’s Office said in the statement. Latest headlines: [Matawan man admits to killing his father, hiding his body in the home they shared](/story/news/crime/2024/01/25/matawan-man-32-pleads-guilty-in-the-slaying-of-his-father/72351441007/) On Jan. 9, in what would have been the seventh such instance, Santiago was caught in the act. He was confronted and asked for his receipt as he attempted to leave the store, according to the statement. “The criminal conduct alleged in the complaints filed against Patrolman Santiago are deeply troubling and do not reflect the values of our agency,” Middletown Police Chief R. Craig Weber said. “We firmly believe that trust and integrity are the essential cornerstones of policing and we hold our employees to the highest professional and ethical standards. Santiago has been relieved of duty and suspended without pay pending the resolution of this matter.” Defense attorney Jeffrey Garrigan of Jersey City, who is representing Santiago in the matter, said the officer is presumed innocent and will plead not guilty to the charges. “We are waiting to see what evidence the state claims to have and my client will address the allegations in due course,” Garrigan said. “Officer Santiago has an unblemished record and has been a stellar member of the Middletown Police Department for a lengthy period of time.” More: [Manchester man pleads guilty in antisemitic terror spree in Lakewood and Jackson](/story/news/local/courts/2024/01/24/manchester-man-dion-marsh-admits-targeting-jewish-antisemitism/72259774007/) According to public records, Santiago has been a police officer since January 2012 and received an annual salary of $88,884. Anyone who may have additional information to report about this matter is asked to contact Detective Brian Hammarstrom of the Prosecutor’s Office at 800-533-7443. The case has been assigned to Assistant Prosecutor Melanie Falco, director of the Professional Responsibility Unit. The case is similar to one in Brick last year where a [Point Pleasant police sergeant was charged with stealing groceries from the local Walmart](/story/news/local/courts/2023/10/11/shoplifting-charges-against-point-pleasant-cop-joshua-gunnell/71123718007/), after going through a self-checkout lane. Much of the case against Detective Sgt. Joshua H. Gunnell, 41, was dismissed after he agreed to resign from the Point Pleasant Police Department.

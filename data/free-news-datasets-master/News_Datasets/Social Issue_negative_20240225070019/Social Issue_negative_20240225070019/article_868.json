    "text": "PATNA: Signs of deep fissures appeared Thursday between JD(U) and its partners in Bihar, triggering concerns about the stability of the 17-month-old, six-party Grand Alliance government amid CM Nitish Kumar dropping hints about rejoining NDA led by BJP, a former ally he dumped in Aug 2022.Nitish is likely to share the stage with PM Modi at a function to be held at Sugauli in Bihar's East Champaran district on Feb 4, sources said.107156678The discord within the Grand Alliance was visible Thursday after RJD chief Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya made veiled comments against CM Nitish for \\\"changing his ideology as the wind changes its direction\\\". Rohini posted at least three comments, indirectly criticising the CM for his remarks on \\\"parties promoting family members in politics\\\". She later deleted her posts.RJD distanced itself and claimed her remarks were directed at PM Modi. Senior JD(U) leaders, including ministers Vijay Kumar Choudhary and Sanjay Jha, attended a meeting in the CM's home later in the evening and assured that all was well within the Mahagathbandhan.",

    "text": "By Jack Walters Published: 25/01/2024- 21:06 Don't Miss Most Read Trending on GB News A one man Tory revolt is already in tatters as the public fails to support a clear favourite to replace Rishi Sunak as Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader, a new opinion poll conducted for GB News has revealed. Respondents to PeoplePolling’s latest survey were unable to put forward a clear favourite to succeed Sunak as all the frontrunners failed to obtain double-digit support. A staggering 51 per cent said “none of the above” with an additional 20 per cent claiming they do not know. Ex-Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage narrowly came out on top in the seven-person shortlist, with eight per cent. Rishi Sunak is facing a threat from Reform UK GETTY/GB NEWS Support for the 59-year-old, who is mulling over whether to return to the political frontline with Reform UK, received the support of 16 per cent of 2019 Tory voters and 16 per cent of 2016 Brexit-backers. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt ended up in joint second on just seven per cent. The two frontrunners to succeed Sunak, Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch and ex-Home Secretary Suella Braverman, languished behind with just two per cent. Sir Simon Clarke, who served as Housing Secretary under Liz Truss, appeared to launch a one-man rebellion after Tory MPs failed to rally behind his call for Sunak to quit. GB News understands the so-called “Contract with Britain” plot to oust Sunak would see Mordaunt installed as Prime Minister just 100 days before polls open.LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: There is no clear frontrunner to succeed Rishi Sunak as Prime Minister and Tory Party leader GBN A number of Tory MPs have called on Conservative colleagues to unite behind the Prime Minister ahead of the upcoming general election. A Conservative MP told GB News: “This one-man rebellion has no support anywhere, and has as much chance of victory as Eddie the Eagle. “All it does is damage the party, the Government and the country. He should stop throwing his toys out of the pram.” Another simply argued: “It would be nuts to change leader now. “Rishi is our leader and Rishi will lead us into the General Election.” A Minister added: “United we win, divided we lose. Simple.” Despite suggesting there is no clear alternative to Sunak, the Prime Minister was dealt a hammer blow as it showed Sir Keir Starmer opened up a 25-point lead over the Tories. Conservative support stood at just 20 per cent, with Labour well out in front on 45 per cent. A Labour Party source suggested Starmer is continuing to benefit from disaffection with politics, particularly from Tory MPs. They said: “People are sick and tired of politics and the ongoing perma-crisis. Labour is storming ahead of the Tories ahead of polling day, a PeoplePolling survey has confirmed GBN “I imagine this year will show a much lower turnout than in 2017 and 2019. “People want change but the Tories can’t cut it as being that ‘change’.” Reform UK, which is led by Richard Tice, found itself in third at 12 per cent after winning over 27 per cent of 2019 Tory voters. However, Tice could mirror the support obtained by Ukip in the 2015 General Election as 14 per cent of respondents said they were “very likely” or “somewhat likely” to support the rebranded Brexit Party. Responding to Reform’s latest boost, Tice told GB News: “People have given up on the toxic Tories. Reform UK could receive 14 per cent of the vote, PeoplePolling's survey suggested GBN “They do not trust a word they say, they like our clear no-nonsense business-like message because we tell it as it is with conviction. “We think we will hit 14 per cent in February. Our policies resonate with folk as they hear about us and there is no love for Labour.” Former No10 pollster Will Dry, who left Downing Street late last year , recently warned Farage’s return could mean the Tory Party “essentially won’t exist by Christmas”. Farage is mulling over whether to return to frontline politics but remains fearful about a situation similar to 2015. The Liberal Democrats were narrowly behind the populist party on 10 per cent, with the Green Party currently expected to more than treble its support to hit nine per cent. Such a situation would likely ensure Starmer enters No10 with a stonking majority akin to Tony Blair’s landslide victory in 1997. The next electoral test will come on February 15 as Sunak looks to cling onto Tory seats in Wellingborough and Kingswood. PeoplePolling conducted its survey on January 25 and included a sample size of 1,648 British voters.",

In addition, the Ricochet Audio Network offers over 50 original podcasts with new episodes released every day. On this episode of “The Federalist Radio Hour,” Nina Teicholz, an investigative science journalist and author, joins Federalist Western Correspondent Tristan Justice to discuss what popular documentaries get right and wrong about nutrition, processed food, and veganism. They also analyze the politicization of health and expose the activist network pushing plant-based eating. You can find Teicholz’s book “The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet” [here](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Big-Fat-Surprise/Nina-Teicholz/9781451624434).

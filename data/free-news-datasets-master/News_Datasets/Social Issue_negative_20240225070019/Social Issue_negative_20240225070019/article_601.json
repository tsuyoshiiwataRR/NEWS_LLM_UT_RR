    "text": "[]https://www.cheknews.ca/impaired-driver-who-was-wreaking-havoc-in-langford-facing-multiple-charges-1187843/\nA 24-year-old woman who crashed into multiple vehicles in Langford is facing numerous charges.\nOn Jan. 20, West Shore RCMP officers responded to a report of a collision in the area of Costin Avenue and Leigh Road in Langford.\nUpon arrival, officers found bystanders trying to prevent the driver of a 2018 Chevy Cruze from driving away after a collision with a 2020 GMC Sierra.\nThe driver of the Cruze was showing signs of alcohol impairment and failed to cooperate with police. She was arrested for obstructing a police officer, driving while impaired and failing to remain at the scene of a collision.\nPolice were able to connect the vehicle in question with two other hit-and-run incidents that happened in the leadup to the driver’s arrest.\nThe car had previously rammed a chain link fence on Tennis Court Lane, leaving behind its license plate. It also hit a parked car on Bray Avenue and Rita Road, which caused extensive damage to the frontend of a Ford Fusion.\nThe driver is now facing over $2,000 worth of fines, and was charged with;\n- Immediate Roadside Prohibition (refusal to provide a breath sample), vehicle was towed and impounded for 30 days, driver must pay for tow and impound fee as well as administrative penalties and licence re-instatement fee minimum $1,500 total;\n- Violation ticket for failure to remain at the scene of an accident, $368 fine;\n- Violation ticket for fail to stop when in an accident, resulting in damage to property, $196 fine.\nIt’s remarkable that no one suffered major injuries in this incident. We are thankful to the bystanders who called police right away. They prevented the driver from continuing to wreak havoc on the roadway by driving impaired, said Cpl. Nancy Saggar in a statement.",

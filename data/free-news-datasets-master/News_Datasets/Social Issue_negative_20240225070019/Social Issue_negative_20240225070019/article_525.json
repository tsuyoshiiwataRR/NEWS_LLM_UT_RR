    "text": "Elle King has rescheduled a series of shows following her controversial performance during Dolly Parton's birthday tribute at the Ryman Auditorium earlier this month.\nThe singer-songwriter and daughter of actor-comedian Rob Schneider, has faced much criticism for what some fans have called a \"lackluster\" performance.\nWhat was supposed to a family-friendly program, turned into a chaotic, \"hammered\" performance as the \"Ex's and Oh's\" singer admitted to being under the influence, not knowing the lyrics to Parton's, \"Marry Me,\" and frequently cursed throughout the evening.\n\"I'll tell you one thing more … Hi, my name is Elle King. I'm (expletive) hammered,\" she said onstage.\n\"I don't know the lyrics to these things in this (expletive) town/Don't tell Dolly 'cause it's her birthday.\" She continued. \"I'm not even gonna (expletive) lie … y'all bought tickets for this (expletive), you ain't getting your money back.\"\nKing's performance prompted an apology from the Grand Ole Opry on social media after many fans expressed their disappointment.\n\"Hi Judas, we deeply regret and apologize for the language that was used during last night’s second Opry performance,\" said the Ryman in a post to X on Jan. 20.\nNeither King or Parton have commented about the performance.\nWhat shows did Elle King reschedule? In an Instagram story , King announced a total of 5 rescheduled shows.\nKing's concerts on Feb. 23 and 24 at Island Resort and Casino in Harris, Michigan, have been moved to March 29 and 30, \"due to an unforeseen circumstance,\" according to a news release Thursday from the casino.\nOn Wednesday, Billy Bob's Texas announced that the Fort Worth show set to take place on Friday would be rescheduled to Sept. 21. The venue did not provide a reason for the last-minute cancelation.\n\"Original event tickets will be accepted for the new date. Refunds are available at the point of purchase,\" said the venue in a post to Instagram. \"Thank you for your understanding!\"\nShows in Shipshewana, Ind. and Waukegan, Ill. were also postponed.\nDiana Leyva covers trending news and service for The Tennessean.

Ridgewell and his colleagues DC Douglas Ellis and DC Alan Keeling later pleaded guilty to stealing from the same depot.\n...\nThe court heard that Ridgewell was: “dishonest, corrupt, and racist.”\n...\nBoth Mr Mehmet and Mr Peterkin were sentenced to nine months in prison and protested their innocence for the rest of their lives before passing away, Mr Peterkin in August 1991 and Mr Mehhmet in August 2021.\nThe Court of Appeal has now quashed the convictions of 11 people on the basis of the conviction of DS Ridgewell...\nThe three officers later pleaded guilty to stealing from the same depot and were sentenced to seven, six and two years in prison respectively. The three officers were said to have joined forces with a group of men to steal £364,000 worth of property from the depot.'\nhttps://ccrc.gov.uk/news/convictions-quashed-after-persistent-pro-active-ccrc-investigation/\n[J Roberts](/user/j_roberts_2) left an annotation ()\nThe Guardian 25/1/24:\nHow many people did DS Derek Ridgewell fit up? The sheer scale of his depravity, and his targeting of men of colour, is only now becoming clear\n'His notoriety was such that both a 1973 BBC Nationwide documentary and a Sunday Times article referred to a calypso song heard in the pubs around Brixton: “If the muggers don’t get you, Ridgewell will.” But despite the newspapers, the documentary and even a judge showing that Ridgewell was a racist with no qualms about framing innocents, the BTP did nothing. He was neither sacked nor disciplined. He was merely moved into another job.'\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/25/i-just-went-bent-how-britains-most-corrupt-cop-ruined-countless-lives\nWe work to defend the right to FOI for everyone\nHelp us protect your right to hold public authorities to account.

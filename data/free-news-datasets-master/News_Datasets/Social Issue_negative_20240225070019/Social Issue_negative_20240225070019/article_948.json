    "text": "LONDON: Jemima Goldsmith has called out a fake Twitter account set up in her son’s name to support the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) election campaign. Jemima Goldsmith, who was married to former premier Imran Khan till around two decades ago, asked her followers on Twitter/X to report the fake account. She wrote: “Fake account. Please report.” The fake account is being run in the name of Jemima’s younger son Kassim Khan. The fake account tweeted: “Hi everyone, General Elections will be held in Pakistan soon, so in these difficult circumstances, it is our right to convey Imran Khan’s message to everyone and take full advantage of social media, so now I will use Twitter actively, need your support. #ImranKhanIsOurLeader” This is not the first time Jemima has called out fake accounts set up by social media users to exploit names of Jemima and Khan’s sons Suleman Khan and Kassim Khan. Jemima has said her sons are not on Twitter or any other social media site - or at least they are not there under their real names. Jemima also expressed her dismay at being linked to an alleged “Operation Goldsmith” being run by X users in Pakistan. Yesterday, it trended in Pakistan and abroad making accusations against the Goldsmith family. Sources close to Jemima have said the allegations are ludicrous and the Goldsmith family has no interest in Pakistani politics.",

    "text": "SAN ANGELOâ€” An Early man has been indicted for trying to record an underage girl in the shower.\nA Tom Green County Grand Jury indicted Christopher Constancia, 34, for Attempting to Possess Child Pornography after he was caught trying to record an underage girl in the shower.\nAccording to court documents, on May 26, 2023, San Angelo Police responded to the 1900 block of West Concho Avenue regarding an invasive visual recording call. Once the officer arrived, he spoke with all the parties including Constancia, who waived his rights and agreed to speak about the incident.\nConstancia allegedly admitted to taking a recording of the underage victim while she was in the shower using his cell phone. The victim said that she saw the shower curtain move in a slight manner a few times before sticking her head out and seeing Constancia using his cellphone to record her.\nConstancia was arrested and booked into the Tom Green County Jail on May 26, 2023, and was released on May 27, 2023, on $30,000 bond. He is next due in court on February 21, 2024, for post indictment reporting. Attempting to Possess Child Pornography is a state jail felony and carries a possible sentence of no more than two years or less than 180 days in prison.",

    "text": "*The viral ‚ÄúBrick Lady‚Äù has turned herself in to police after being charged for allegedly lying about being attacked by a man after she refused to give her phone number to him.\nWe\nreported earlier that Roda Osman, 33, used the incident to raise more than $42,000 on GoFundMe.\nOsman went viral late last year after claiming a Black man cold-clocked her in the face with a brick. She was charged last week for fabricating parts of the story and profiting off her lies.\nIn a video shared online and posted on\n Instagram by the shade room, Osman (also known as Rho Bashe) can be heard saying, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall, this man just hit me in my face with a brick and all these Black men just watched. This man‚Ä¶grabbed a rock and hit me in my face because I wouldn‚Äôt give him my number.‚Äù\nThe video shows Osman yelling at the crowd of men and saying, ‚ÄúI want you to be a man and do something. You gonna let a man hit me in my face?‚Äù\nView this post on Instagram\nOsman is seen in a follow-up video\n wearing a hospital gown and her face swollen. She claims the crowd watched a brick hit her and let the man who assaulted her flee in a car. ‚ÄúHow is this OK?‚Äù she asked.\nHer video garnered millions of views on social media, and she became known as the ‚ÄòBrick lady.‚Äô\nDuring the investigation, police viewed the security cameras at the Houston club where Osman claims the assault occurred. Surveillance footage showed Osman and the man initially accused of hitting her with a brick getting into an argument. He appears to strike Osman in the face with a water bottle after she slapped him.\nRoda Osman is an excellent case study of just how far a pathological liar will go to convince others they‚Äôre a victim when they made decisions they don‚Äôt want to take accountability for.\n‚Äî üåç$IR G.B.$.üá∫üá∏ (@GRE8TBLACKSHARK)\n[January 20, 2024]\nAs it turned out, Osman was familiar with the man before the physical confrontation, but she initially lied about the details of the assault to the police and the public.\nRead about the investigation\nhere.\nAccording to\nClick2Houston, police charged Osman with felony theft by deception. She turned herself in on Tuesday.\nAn arraignment is scheduled for March 5.\nREAD MORE:\nViral TikToker Who Claimed Black Man Attacked Her with Brick Charged for Lying About Incident\n ",

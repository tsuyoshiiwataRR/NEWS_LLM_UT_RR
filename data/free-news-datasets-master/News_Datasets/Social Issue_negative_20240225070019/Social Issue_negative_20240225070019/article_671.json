    "text": "MARQUETTE, Mich., (WPBN/WGTU) -- A northern Michigan man who is a member of The Base, a multi-state white supremacist group, has been convicted on two counts for vandalizing a Michigan synagogue in 2019, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan. Nathan Weeden, 23, of Houghton, was convicted by a federal jury on Thursday of the following charges: \"Today's swift conviction sends a strong message that hate will not be tolerated in Michigan's Upper Peninsula,\" said U.S. Attorney Mark Totten, who was in Marquette for the trial. \"No one should be the target of hate because of their race, ethnicity, religion, or any other status,\" Totten said. \"When hateful words become hateful acts, my office will use every tool we have to protect the public and secure justice.\" Weeden, [Richard Tobin](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/new-jersey-man-sentenced-one-year-and-one-day-prison-conspiring-white-supremacists-vandalize) and [Yousef Barasneh](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edwi/pr/oak-creek-man-who-vandalized-racine-synagogue-pleads-guilty) -- who are all members of The Base -- used an encrypted messaging platform in Sept. 2019 to discuss vandalizing property associated with African Americans and Jewish Americans, according to a news release from the attorney's office. The Southern Poverty Law Center [describes](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/base) The Base as a white nationalist network whose members believe \"society should be pushed to collapse so a white ethnostate can arise out of the ruins.\" The attorney's office said Weeden and his co-conspirators dubbed their plan \"Operation Kristallnact,\" a term in reference to events that took place on Nov. 9-10, 1938, in which German Nazis murdered Jews and destroyed their homes, synagogues, schools and businesses. \"Weeden carried out this plan on September 21, 2019, when he spray-painted swastikas and symbols associated with The Base on the outside walls of Temple Jacob,\" the attorney's office said. On the same night that the Temple Jacob in Hancock, Michigan, was vandalized, members of The Base vandalized a synagogue in Racine, Wisconsin, according to the attorney's office. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan did not state whether or not a sentencing date had been set for Weeden.",

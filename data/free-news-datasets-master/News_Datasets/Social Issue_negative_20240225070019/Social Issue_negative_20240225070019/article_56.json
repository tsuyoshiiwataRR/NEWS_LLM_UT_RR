    "text": "Hawaii Democrats have advanced legislation that could remove Donald Trump from the state‚Äôs ballot. The bill, introduced by Hawaii state Sen. Karl Rhoads, aims to ‚Äúspecify that election ballots issued by the chief election officer or county clerk shall exclude any candidate who is disqualified under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; article XVI, section 3 of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii; or another constitutional or statutory provision.‚Äù Although the bill doesn‚Äôt explicitly name Donald Trump, the proposed legislation would aim to ‚Äúprohibit electors of presidential and vice presidential candidates from voting for any presidential or vice presidential nominee who has been disqualified pursuant to Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, as determined by any federal court, or as determined by the state supreme court in an election contest.‚Äù ‚ÄúMaine‚Äôs Democratic Secretary of State and Colorado‚Äôs Supreme Court cited the insurrection clause in barring Trump from their state ballots,‚Äù Fox News noted. Hawaii Democrat introduces bill to ban Trump from ballot [https://t.co/xRbNU8eSS4] ‚Äî Fox News (@FoxNews) [January 24, 2024] [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hawaii-democrat-introduces-bill-ban-trump-ballot?intcmp=tw_fnc) reports: The bill passed its first reading on Monday. Trump‚Äôs campaign has repeatedly categorized efforts to block him from the ballot as aiming to disenfranchise American voters. Maine‚Äôs Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, appealed a judge‚Äôs ruling on Friday that put on hold her decision to remove Trump from the ballot until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on a similar case in Colorado. Bellow, a Democrat, said she also wants to ensure Maine‚Äôs highest court has the opportunity to weigh in before ballots are counted in the March 5 primaries. The timelines are tight as Super Tuesday approaches. The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments in the Colorado case on Feb. 8, which likely means there would not be enough time to meet statutory deadlines for Bellows to reissue a ruling on Trump‚Äôs ballot status and for additional appeals to be filed before Election Day. Lawsuits in Minnesota, Michigan, Arizona and Oregon aiming to block Trump from the 2024 ballot have already been dismissed on procedural grounds, Newsweek reported. Journalist Nick Sortor questioned the motives of Hawaii Democrats wanting Trump removed from the ballot. ‚ÄúHawaii Democrats have introduced legislation to keep President Trump OFF the ballot for the 2024 election. Are they afraid Hawaii is going to FLIP from blue to RED after Biden ABANDONED the people of Maui after the fires? Or maybe they‚Äôre afraid Trump will expose the RAMPANT corruption out here in Hawaii?‚Äù Sortor wrote. üö® JUST IN: Hawaii Democrats have introduced legislation to keep President Trump OFF the ballot for the 2024 election Are they afraid Hawaii is going to FLIP from blue to RED after Biden ABANDONED the people of Maui after the fires?

He has been kicked off ballots in Maine and Colorado, because of the same constitutional amendment. But the decisions in both of those states were paused on appeal. The US Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the Colorado case in early February.",

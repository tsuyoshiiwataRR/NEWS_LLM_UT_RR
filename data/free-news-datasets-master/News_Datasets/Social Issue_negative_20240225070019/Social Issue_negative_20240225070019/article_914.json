    "text": "Two FIRs have been filed in Chhattisgarh’s capital Raipur after a video emerged Thursday purportedly showing a man, who runs a madrasa, with blood on his face and surrounded by a mob. According to police, the video is of an incident from Sinodha village, around 50 km from [Raipur](https://indianexpress.com/elections/raipur-lok-sabha-election-results/), which took place Wednesday. It shows the man being taken to Tilda Newra police station, surrounded by a mob chanting slogans and carrying saffron flags. While he has blood on his face, the video does not show him being assaulted. A senior police officer said, “A 14-year-old boy from the village had uploaded an allegedly objectionable video. We received a complaint from a villager, and during investigation, learnt that 3 persons, including the man in the video, had allegedly provoked him. We lodged an [FIR](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/fir-cognizable-offence-ipc-explained-7780266/) against them.” Before police could make arrests, he was allegedly assaulted by a mob. Two FIRs have been filed. One is against members of the mob. No arrest has been made so far. The other is against the man and 2 other accused. Bihar's political landscape is in turmoil as the JD(U)-RJD-Congress alliance faces a potential split, with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar likely to switch sides to the NDA. Amidst talks of a rift, separate meetings were held by the RJD and JD(U) while BJP leaders discussed the situation in Delhi. Tensions rose after Nitish appeared to criticize dynastic rule, causing further speculation.",

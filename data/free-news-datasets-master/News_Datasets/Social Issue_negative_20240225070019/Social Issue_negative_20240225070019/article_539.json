Investigation and Family’s Response The Sumter County Sheriff’s Office declined to answer questions about the deadly shooting, citing the ongoing investigation. A spokesperson said the deputy is on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation, a standard procedure. Sours’ family declined to comment on Thursday. Handling of the Incident As deputies were investigating whether her complaint “was real or if she was having a mental episode,” Sours allegedly pulled a knife from behind her back and lunged at a deputy “attempting to stab him,” the release states. Authorities said the deputy “took evasive action backing up while simultaneously drawing his service weapon and fired” at Sours, striking her.",

WASHINGTON ( [Churchmilitant.com](https://www.churchmilitant.com/)) - A group of self-professed Catholic Democrats has released a letter entitled \" [Renewed Statement of Principles](https://delauro.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/delauro.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/renewed-statement-of-principles_0.pdf),\" which attempts to harmonize Catholic social teaching with killing babies. The lawmakers' statement, published on June 24, was chiefly organized by Rep. Rosa DeLauro, along with the pro-abortion group \"Catholics for Choice.\" It reads in part, \"Today, as Catholic Democrats serving in the House of Representatives, we are proud that we are part of the faithful pro-choice Catholic majority — 68 percent of whom supported the legal protections for abortion access enshrined in Roe and 63 percent of whom think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\" Led by Rep. DeLauro of Connecticut, the statement was signed by 30 other \"Catholic\" Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. The pro-abortion statement, which references the Catechism of the Catholic Church and Pope St. John Paul II, adds, \"Our faith unfailingly promotes the common good, prioritizes the dignity of every human being, and highlights the need to provide a collective safety net to our most vulnerable.\" The so-called statement of principles is an expansion on a [letter written two years ago](https://delauro.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/delauro-evo.house.gov/files/documents/Statement%20of%20Principles%206.18.21.pdf), wherein nearly 60 \"Catholic\" members of Congress clarified their support for abortion and called for American clergymen not to bar them from receiving Communion, saying, \"The Sacrament of Holy Communion is central to the life of practicing Catholics, and the weaponization of the Eucharist to Democratic lawmakers for their support of a woman's safe and legal access to abortion is contradictory.\" That 2021 statement, which was also spearheaded by DeLauro, was written in response to a decision by U.S. Catholic bishops to establish a teaching document on the nature of the Eucharist and its proper reception. The episcopal [document](http://www.usccb.org/resources/7-703%20The%20Mystery%20of%20Eucharist,%20for%20RE-UPLOAD,%20JANUARY%202022.pdf) The Mystery of the Eucharist in the Life of the Church ended up sidestepping the issue of pro-abortion politicians receiving Communion and failed to explicitly condemn the sacrilege. Rep. DeLauro resides in the archdiocese of Hartford, Connecticut, led by Abp. Leonard Blair. We— Jamie L. Manson (@jamielmanson) [@Catholic4Choice]were so proud to work in partnership with [@rosadelauro]’s office to craft this powerful statement. The 5 justices that struck down Roe are or were raised Catholic. So it is crucial that the pro-choice Catholic majority speak out. [https://t.co/bmTjreEmeC] [June 24, 2023] Although the recent statement from self-described Catholic lawmakers cites the Catechism and Pope John Paul II, these references were made in order to justify a \"right to abortion.\" The Catechism, however, [teaches](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2271.htm) that abortion is \"gravely contrary to the moral law\" and an \"abominable crime.\" Likewise, John Paul II [equated](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25031995_evangelium-vitae.html) abortion to murder, adding that it's is a crime \"which no human law can claim to legitimize.\" Catholic laymen are calling upon Abp. Blair, along with his brother bishops, to respond to the letter. I am a Catholic—baptized, raised, and confirmed.— Rosa DeLauro (@rosadelauro) The fundamental tenets of my faith compel me to defend a women’s right to access abortion. I am proudly part of the faithful large majority of US Catholics who support legal protections for abortion access. Read my statement ⬇️ [June 26, 2023] In promoting the \"Renewed Statement of Principles\" letter, Rep. DeLauro [tweeted out](https://twitter.com/rosadelauro/status/1673471647708327944), \"I am a Catholic — baptized, raised and confirmed. The fundamental tenets of my faith compel me to defend a women's right to access abortion.\" This elicited an outrage from Catholics. Joshua Charles, former White House speechwriter, [responded](https://twitter.com/JoshuaTCharles/status/1673857762584043520), \"Repent.\" Jack Posobiec, senior editor at Human Events, [replied](https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1673842596152745989), \"Not Catholic.\" And Mary Margaret Olohan, senior reporter at the Daily Signal, [wrote](https://twitter.com/MaryMargOlohan/status/1673826789175566342), \"This is complete BS.\" [Have a news tip?

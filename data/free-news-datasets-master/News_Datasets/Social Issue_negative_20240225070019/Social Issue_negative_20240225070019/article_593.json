    "text": "KG Catering has been suspended for two weeks, from Jan 23 to Feb 5, after accumulating 12 demerit points within a year.\nThe catering business, located at 171 Kampong Ampat, was also fined $3,000, the Singapore Food Agency said on Jan 23.\nThe fine was imposed after the caterer committed two offences – failure to keep licensed premises free of infestation and sale or preparation of food where food is likely to be contaminated. Each offence resulted in six demerit points.\nA licensee who accumulates 12 or more demerit points within a year may have his licence suspended for a period of either two or four weeks, or cancelled, SFA said.\n“All food handlers working in the suspended premises would also be required to re-attend and pass the Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) Food Safety Course Level 1, before they can resume work as food handlers.\n“The licensee is also required to ensure that all food hygiene officers working in the suspended premises, if there are any, re-attend and pass the WSQ Food Safety Course Level 3,” added the agency.\nSingapore 160kg of illegally imported produce, processed food seized Jan 24, 2024 Related Stories 2 lots for new seafood farms off Pulau Bukom open for tender Casuarina Curry outlet suspended, fined for hygiene lapses Chapati, chutney and cockroaches – Indian foods supplier hauled to court over hygiene lapses This is the second time KG Catering has fined in under three months, after being hit with one on Nov 1.\nThe caterer was slapped with a $6,000 fine for multiple hygiene violations, after 92 people suffered food poisoning after consuming food it prepared between Sept 20, 2022, and March 11, 2023.\nAs a result of this, SFA also suspended KG Catering’s food business operations from Nov 9, 2022 to Feb 1, 2023.\nSFA reminded food operators to observe good food and personal hygiene practices at all times, and to engage only registered food handlers.\nSFA will not hesitate to take firm action against anyone found to be in violation of the Environmental Public Health Act, it added.\nIf the public spot breaches of the law, they can report the matter via sfa.gov.sg/feedback or contact SFA at 6805-2871.\n ",

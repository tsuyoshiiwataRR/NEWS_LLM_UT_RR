    "text": "NEW ORLEANS ( WVUE /Gray News) - Louisiana’s crawfish harvest is expected to hit a historic low in 2024.\nCrawfish specialists in Louisiana are attributing the conditions to adverse weather conditions, including drought.\n“It’s going to be the worst season ever,” Louisiana State University AgCenter crawfish specialist Mark Shirley told the Louisiana Radio Network . “The population is just not there.”\nLouisiana Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain added, “We’ve lost a lot of our crawfish. They simply did not survive the drought.”\nTo cultivate the crustaceans, farmers traditionally cultivate a rice crop in shallow water, providing a habitat for crawfish to burrow underground.\nUnder optimal conditions, females can hatch between 400-900 eggs each.\nBut last year’s drought prevented some farmers from flooding their fields, and recent extreme weather has adversely affected the crawfish crops during crucial growth periods.\n“They [fishermen] may fish all day but instead of catching 30 or 40 sacks they catch five or six,” Strain said.\nExperts say the scarcity of the harvest is also driving prices up.\nAt Cajun Seafood restaurants in New Orleans, crawfish are selling for as much as $16.99 a pound , while this time last year they were selling for about $5 a pound.\n“I am hoping that we have a short and condensed season and that we have enough crawfish for Easter because it’s just not Easter without crawfish,” he said.\nLouisiana is the largest harvester of crawfish in the nation.\nCopyright 2024 WVUE via Gray Media Group, Inc.

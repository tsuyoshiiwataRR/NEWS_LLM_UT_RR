    "text": "How to fix Diablo 4 “queued for game, start game pending” messageBlizzard Entertainment\nDiablo 4 is not immune to server issues, resulting in players receiving annoying messages when attempting to log in, so here’s a quick rundown on the “queued for game, start game pending” message and whether you can fix it or not in Diablo 4 Season 3.\nBlizzard’s\nDiablo 4 is a live service game, which means it requires a constant internet connection to play. Despite its lengthy campaign, the game lacks an offline mode, which might be disappointing for many players.\nRegular server issues further frustrate players as they face login issues such as\nerror code 315306 and messages like “queued for game, start game pending” especially when they are grinding to complete the Vaults introduced in Season of the Construct. Diablo 4 has many great single-player features, but these errors prevent players from enjoying them.\nHere’s everything you need to know about the Diablo 4 “queued for game” error.\nCan you fix Diablo 4 “queued for game, start game pending” message?\nThe only way to fix the\nhttps://diablo4.blizzard.com/ “queued for game, start game pending” message is to wait for the queue to whittle down, as closing the application will reset the timer and your place in the queue will be lost.\nUnfortunately, there is no way to get around the issue or speed up the process, so while it may be frustrating, the best option is to wait for the queue to go down. The error occurs when the\nDiablo 4 servers are under stress, as millions of users try to access the game at once.\nTo counter this, players are placed into a queue to ease the pressure on the servers by letting players log in gradually. Diablo 4 devs seem to be aware of this problem, which is fairly common in online or live service games, and have put out various fixes that have reduced the number of server issues.\nWhy Diablo 4 queues are so long?\nBlizzard addressed the problems with long queues right after Diablo 4 was originally released, and stated that Diablo 4 has long queue times to stop servers from becoming “overcrowded.”\nDevs also stated Diablo 4 has been one of their most successful releases\ndespite fans’ complaints, that long queues are Blizzard’s way of controlling the flow of players into the game world so those who can get it, “can enjoy a seamless gaming experience.”\n“Long queue times may seem unfair, but they provide an equal opportunity for all players to access the game. Without queues, the servers could become overcrowded, leading to a subpar experience for everyone. The queue system ensures that everyone gets a chance to play without overwhelming the servers,” Blizzard stated\nin their forums.\nThat was all about the “queued for game, start game pending” message in Diablo 4.

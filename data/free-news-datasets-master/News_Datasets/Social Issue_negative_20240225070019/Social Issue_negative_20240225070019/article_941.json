    "text": "DALHART, Texas (KFDA/Gray News) - One Texas community is mourning the loss of their high school principal after he was killed in a crash after a basketball game.\nScot Wright, who was the principal at Dalhart High School, was returning home from the basketball game Tuesday night when he was involved in a head-on collision with a semi around 1 a.m.\nKFDA reports Wright later died at the hospital.\nJeff Byrd, the school district’s superintendent, said Wright was loved by many in the community and he leaves a lasting impact.\n“He was just a great man and a great friend and we’re sad, we’re teared out, but he was a great man and we love him. We’re gonna miss him,” Byrd said.\nByrd said he sees the glass as half full despite the tragedy and he encourages the community to celebrate the positive impact Wright had at Dalhart High School.\n“I can assure you, in the six years that Scot Wright was the principal here, he touched and changed many lives and set examples for our students they’ll carry with them throughout their lives,” Byrd said.\nThe City of Dalhart is no stranger to tragedy, as it has lost several students as well as its fire chief and a firefighter over the last few years, according to KFDA.\n“We have met our quota, we obviously don’t want to deal with this anymore. But at the end of the day we’re firm believers in God’s plan and this was part of God’s plan and God’s never gonna give us more than we’re capable of handling,” Byrd said.\nWright is survived by his wife Torri, who serves as a school nurse for the district, and his two children.\nThe school district plans to coordinate with students on how to celebrate Wright’s life.\nCopyright 2024 KFDA via Gray Media Group, Inc.

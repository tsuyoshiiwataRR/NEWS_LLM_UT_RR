It launches, it sees and connects to my router, but then no matter what I try to do next I get stuck with the whirling circles of endless wait.\nFor example, the app opens, connects, and I see the menu choices and tap WiFi Settings. I can see the WiFi settings in the \"background,\" and they're all correct, but all that happens then is two little circles spinning inside one another on the screen. I've given it up to five minutes, and then killed the app. No matter what I choose inside the app, same thing. Whirling circles.\nSometimes when I reopen the app it can no longer connect to the router at all, as if the first attempt did something to the router itself. I have to then reboot the router manually for the app to even see it, even though it's functioning (all my devices have internet access).\nAnyone else having this problem? Is there something wrong with the app or with my router?\nFirmware is up to date as of yesterday, but maybe there's an issue with the latest firmware?\nAttaching a short video showing the main menu and then what happens when I try to go to WiFi settings.\n[1](/t5/Nighthawk-App/Nighthawk-App-iOS-Useless-Cannot-Access-Settings-on-R7000/m-p/1751741#M9513)of 9\nRe: Nighthawk App (iOS) Useless - Cannot Access Settings on R7000\nVideo would not upload.\n[2](/t5/Nighthawk-App/Nighthawk-App-iOS-Useless-Cannot-Access-Settings-on-R7000/m-p/1751742#M9514)of 9\nRe: Nighthawk App (iOS) Useless - Cannot Access Settings on R7000\nHi\n[@ZoeMacUser](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/679428), welcome to the community! Please try re-installing the app and check if the issue will persist. Also, doe the issue occur when using another device (another iOS or Android)? Please indicate the exact firmware version of the router.\nDexter\n[3](/t5/Nighthawk-App/Nighthawk-App-iOS-Useless-Cannot-Access-Settings-on-R7000/m-p/1751798#M9521)of 9\nRe: Nighthawk App (iOS) Useless - Cannot Access Settings on R7000\nCopy. Reinstalling the app just now made no difference in the behavior.

Please check your inbox.\nDexter\n[5](/t5/Nighthawk-App/Nighthawk-App-iOS-Useless-Cannot-Access-Settings-on-R7000/m-p/1752358#M9533)of 9\nRe: Nighthawk App (iOS) Useless - Cannot Access Settings on R7000\nHello,\nI'm having a nearly identical issue with the app (iOS) with the R7800. It's new, and I went through the set up (giving temporary names and passwords to everything just to get through the process thinking I could change them later) and immediately got caught in the endless cycle of waiting for it to communicate, with the added complication of the router disconnecting from the internet. It locked up during the firmware check so I have no idea if that worked.\nI deleted the app, rebooted everything, immediately had internet access. Thinking everything sorted out I downloaded the app again, tried to connect - right back into endless cycling and the internet connection dropped. Did this a few more times changing the order, etc - end result I'm online and everything is great as long as I don't open the app. The second the app detects the router the router drops internet and then the app goes into the endless little circle swirling.\nRight now I have no way of communicating with the router to change any settings or monitor it or anything. Technically it's working. I have internet access. I suppose the silver lining is I didn't pick too silly of a temporary SSID during set up?\nHelp? Suggestions? If I can't get the app to work is there really anything I can do?\n[6](/t5/Nighthawk-App/Nighthawk-App-iOS-Useless-Cannot-Access-Settings-on-R7000/m-p/1756521#M9570)of 9\nRe: Nighthawk App (iOS) Useless - Cannot Access Settings on R7000\n[7](/t5/Nighthawk-App/Nighthawk-App-iOS-Useless-Cannot-Access-Settings-on-R7000/m-p/1757010#M9590)of 9\nRe: Nighthawk App (iOS) Useless - Cannot Access Settings on R7000\nThank you for the response. I did check the firmware version (thanks for the reminder link) and it's all up to date. I ended up buying a new modem. The modem from my ISP wasn't great and once a new one was in place I was able to get the router to step through the update [edit: I meant registration not update] process without the app locking up. End result - we are online, and have more control and I have limited use of the app. It (the app) still behaves as if I haven't registered the router and I have to dimiss the request to setup but other wise it works, sort of. Basically I can see the devices and that it's online. Beyond that it goes into endless cycling. This is much better than before where just opening the app crashed the router, so, yay progress! At this point I'm just going to use the admin login on my computer if I want to do anything fancy and pretend the app doesn't exsist. ðŸ™‚ Thanks for your help!\n[8](/t5/Nighthawk-App/Nighthawk-App-iOS-Useless-Cannot-Access-Settings-on-R7000/m-p/1757466#M9597)of 9\nRe: Nighthawk App (iOS) Useless - Cannot Access Settings on R7000\nI'm trying to access advanced settings on my R7000 through the Nighthawk app (ver. 2.32.1.14 firmware version: v1.0.11.100). I want to be able to block and unblock attached devices but it only shows what is connected under device manager, no way to change anything. This app is worthless unless you can remotely change router settings. Is it even possible?\n[9](/t5/Nighthawk-App/Nighthawk-App-iOS-Useless-Cannot-Access-Settings-on-R7000/m-p/2359201#M16259)of 9\nâ€¢\nWhat is the difference between WiFi 6 and WiFi 7?\nâ€¢ Yes!

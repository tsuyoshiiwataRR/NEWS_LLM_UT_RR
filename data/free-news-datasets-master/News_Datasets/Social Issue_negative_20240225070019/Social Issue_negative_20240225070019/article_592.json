    "text": "A 49-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly assaulting a police officer and for suspected criminal intimidation.\nThe police said on Jan 24 that the incident occurred at around 9.15pm on Jan 23.\nUpon receiving a report of an assault, police officers were dispatched to Block 462 Sembawang Drive. A 49-year-old suspect had barricaded himself in a flat with a 52-year-old woman.\nThe situation escalated to the point where the Crisis Negotiation Unit, Special Operations Command and the Singapore Civil Defence Force were called in.\nAfter three hours of negotiation, the police seized an opportunity to enter the unit when the woman temporarily left the man’s side to use the toilet. This allowed the officers to ensure her safety.\nThe unit was breached around 1.15am on Jan 24, and the man was taken into custody. It was during the arrest that he allegedly kicked one of the officers.\nSingapore Jail for ex-lawyer who misappropriated almost $480,000 Jan 25, 2024 Related Stories Charged MFA director-general allowed to go to Tokyo to visit his pottery master 4 years’ jail for woman who poured boiling soup on friend Man charged with kicking cop during arrest The man will be charged in court on Jan 25 with voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty.

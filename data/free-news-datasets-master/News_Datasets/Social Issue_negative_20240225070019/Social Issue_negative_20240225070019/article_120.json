    "text": "BEAUMONT, Texas â€” A Nederland man jailed on a parole violation related to being accused of assaulting his mother and stepfather is accused of making up a charge of sexual assault to get them to drop the charge against him. Rodger Dale Allen East, 27, of Nederland, was indicted on Wednesday by a Jefferson County grand jury on a third degree felony charge of tampering with a witness. In November of 2023 East was in custody in the [Jefferson County Correctional Facility](https://co.jefferson.tx.us/Sheriff/corrections/corrections-facility/) for a parole violation related to him being investigated for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon according to a probable cause affidavit in the case. East spoke to a Nederland Police Department detective while he was in jail and told him that his stepfather had sexually assaulted him for three years when he was a teen the affidavit said. Before interviewing East, the detective had learned from a fellow detective that East was under investigating for the assault against his mother and stepfather according to the affidavit. East told the detective that his mother and stepfather had made up the assault charge in order to have him jailed after he made the sexual assault outcry and thus protect his stepfather. After the interview the detective listened to a recorded call East made from jail to a cousin five days earlier according to the affidavit. On the call, East told his cousin that if his mom and stepfather were going to press charges it \"will not be good for them.\" He went on to say that he would claim his stepfather molested him when he was 13 so his stepfather could go to jail, too. The day before he made his claim to the Nederland detective, he was also recorded making a call to an aunt telling her that if his mom was going to put him in jail that he'd send his stepfather to jail for 99 years. The detective also listened to a call East made to his mother two hours after he spoke to the detective and made the allegation against his stepfather. In that recording he could be overheard arguing with his mom about the charges they had each made and then telling her that if she dropped her charges then he would do the same. When interviewed by the detective, the stepfather denied that he had sexually assaulted East and also passed a polygraph examination related to that charge. After listening to recordings of the calls that East made while jailed, the detective concluded that East made up the sexual assault charges as part of a ploy to get his mother and stepfather to drop their charges according to the affidavit. This is a developing story. We will update with more if and when we receive more confirmed information.

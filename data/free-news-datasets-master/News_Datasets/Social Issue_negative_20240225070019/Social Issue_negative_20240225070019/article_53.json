Navarro's team argued during the sentencing hearing on Thursday that he believed he could not comply with the committee's subpoena due to executive privilege. \"When I received that congressional subpoena...I had an honest belief that the privilege had been invoked,\" Navarro said to US District Judge Amit Mehta, according to The Hill. Mehta scolded Navarro and his legal team during the hearing for blaming the prosecution on politics. \"It's unfortunate that the statements mislead. They mislead,\" Mehta said. \"Nancy Pelosi is not responsible for this prosecution; Joe Biden isn't responsible for the prosecution. It's those kinds of statements from someone who knows better... that contributes to why our politics are so divisive.\"Meanwhile, Merrick's Marauders are demanding 17 years in prison for a J6 hostage who\narah McAbee's husband, a former sheriff's deputy in Tennessee, was incarcerated for 26 months before he was given a trial for his role in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. \"And clearly it wasn't a jury of his peers,\" McAbee said on the \"Vicki McKenna Show,\" a radio program in Madison, Wisconsin. Ronald McAbee now awaits sentencing after being convicted of five felonies in a D.C. district court. Mr. McAbee had already pled guilty to another felony and a misdemeanor related to the riot, and prosecutors are now asking the judge to give him 14 to 17 years behind bars. Sarah McAbee, however, says her family has become victims of politically weaponized prosecutions of those involved in the Jan. 6 demonstrations. When asked by the radio show's guest host, Federalist Senior Elections Correspondent Matt Kittle, why her husband remains behind bars 29 months later, Sarah blamed the lengthy incarceration on what her husband saw at the riot. \"I truly believe it is because he was a law enforcement officer, and he witnessed a murder happen right in front of his eyes,\" Sarah said. \"I believe that's why he was held without bond. He was held 26 months before he even stepped foot in a trial.\"The left has been beating the shit out of police and lasing them in the eyes for decades. Although I never agreed with the refusal to prosecute these \"protesters,\" I accepted the claim that their violence was associated with free speech, and thus we have to treat it with extreme latitude, otherwise we chill the right to free speech itself. I did accept that. And then some righties engaged in hooligan behavior that was 5% of what antifa and BLM do every riot and the government went after them like the Gestapo. So are we supposed to nod along as BLM and antifa thugs get sentenced to \"time served\" -- the two days they spent in jail over the weekend -- for throwing bottles filled with their filthy piss at cops? And what about Hunter Biden? What about Eric Holder and the many Democrats who have defied subpeonas? Should they be allowed to breathe free air? No. It is time for actual vengeance. The future of the country depends on it. For we will either have a civil compact, or we will have a civil war. It is necessary to go as hard after the left, throwing them in jail for months and decades at a clip, to insist that this is not a two-tiered society. Because when the left succeeds in making this country a two-tiered society, people go to war. People will not allow themselves to be made into slaves and prisoners by a hostile alien regime.\nPosted by: Disinformation Expert Ace at\nComments\nPosted by:\nI did accept that.\nAnd then some righties engaged in hooligan behavior that was 5% of what antifa and BLM do every riot and the government went after them like the Gestapo.\n-\nWhen only government approved free speech exists...\nPosted by:\nPosted by: JT at January 25, 2024 01:23 PM (T4tVD)\n========\nBiden's administration arresting Texas State Troopers in Eagle Pass in order to allow the breaking of federal law by illegal immigrants may do it first, though.\nPosted by:\nAndrew Breitbart said it best: \"War.\"\nPosted by: jmel at January 25, 2024 01:23 PM (RWHIh)\nBecause when the left succeeds in making this country a two-tiered society, people go to war.

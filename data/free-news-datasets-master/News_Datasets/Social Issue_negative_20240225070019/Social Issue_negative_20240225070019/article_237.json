May Tears of Solidarity and Commitment Contribute to Reversing the Course of History” M. Ch. Global Research, January 25, 2023 *** To Access the video featuring David Rovics’ Song and Music (2023), click image below Just Like The Nazis Did! After so many decades of patronage By the world’s greatest empire After so many potential agreements Were rejected by opening fire After crushing so many uprisings Now they’re making their ultimate bid Pursuing their Final Solution Just like the Nazis did They forced refugees into ghettos Then set the ghettos aflame Murdering writers and poets And so no one remember their names Killing their entire families The grandparents, women and kids The uncles and cousins and babies Just like the Nazis did David Rovics They’re bombing all means of sustaining Human life at all See the few shelters remaining Watch as the tower blocks fall They’re bombing museums and libraries In order to get rid Of any memory of the people who lived here Just like the Nazis did They’re saying these people are animals And they should all end up dead They’re sending soldiers into schools And shooting children in the head The rhetoric is identical And with Gaza off the grid They’ve already said what happens next Just like the Nazis did Words of war for domestic consumption And lies for all the rest To try to distract our attention Among their enablers in the West Because Israel needs their imports To keep those pallets on the skids They need fuel and they need missiles Just like the Nazis did They’re using food as a weapon They’re using water that way, too They’re trying to kill everyone in Gaza Or make them flee, it’s true As the pundits talk of “after the war” Like with the Fall of Madrid The victors are preparing for more Just like the Nazis did But it’s after the conquest’s complete If history is any guide When the occupying army Is positioned to decide When disease and famine kills Whoever may have hid Behind the ghetto walls Just like the Nazis did All around the world People are trying to tell There is a genocide unfolding Ringing alarm bells But with such a powerful axis And so many lucrative bids They know who wants their money Just like the Nazis did David Rovics * Note to readers: Please click the share button above.

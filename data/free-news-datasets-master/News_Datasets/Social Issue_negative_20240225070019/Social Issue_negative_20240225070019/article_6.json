    "text": "Three Ireland to cut up to 150 jobs nationwide after ‘lower earnings’ and rising costs The move will effect close to one in nine employees as it currently has more than 1,300 workers in Ireland. Three Ireland are to cut up to 150 jobs across the country as part of a collective redundancy process. The move will effect close to one in nine employees as it currently has more than 1,300 workers in Ireland. Most of its workers are based in Dublin but they also operate a centre in Limerick. In a statement released this evening, the company confirmed they will begin a collective redundancy process after a year of lower profits and rising costs. \"Three Ireland can confirm it has made the difficult decision to enter a proposed collective redundancy process for the business and as a result, a number of roles will be impacted. Read more \"We expect approximately 130-150 roles may be impacted, although the actual number will be determined in due course. “Prior to reaching this difficult decision, Three Ireland has implemented a number of measures in a bid to reduce operating costs. However, the business continues to experience commercial performance challenges, with lower earnings and margin growth year on year, as operating costs continue to increase. \"The measures announced today position the business on a stronger platform for the future, ensuring it can maintain its market leading position and will enable growth.” a spokesperson said.",

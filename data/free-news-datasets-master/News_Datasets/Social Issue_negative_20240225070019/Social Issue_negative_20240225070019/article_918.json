    "text": "On the eve of barbecue competition season, one of Polk County's longest-running events has folded and cleared the way for something new. Winter Haven's annual Smoke On the Water BBQ Festival scheduled for Feb. 2 and 3 has long served as a fundraiser for The Boys and Girls Clubs of Polk County. But it was recently canceled by the nonprofit organization. The 20-year event was canceled with roughly three weeks to go, leaving community residents and longtime attendees shocked. It was a tough decision for the Boys and Girls Clubs of Polk County's board of directors. \"After extensive review and consideration, we have concluded that the substantial resources, manpower and effort required to run Smoke On The Water are not in alignment with our renewed focus and strategic direction,\" the nonprofit said in a press statement. \"The Boys & Girls Club of Polk County is committed to efficiently utilizing our resources in the best possible way to support and enhance the lives of the children we serve.\" Steve Giordano, president and CEO of the Boys and Girls Club of Polk County , told The Ledger via email that while there are no current plans for the event, he would not count out the possibility it will return in the future. Many of the organization's board members have suggestive alternative events and fundraisers. They're in the process of evaluating those and might eventually act upon them, Giordano said. With dozens of barbecue competition teams lined up, the event's organization team has quickly spun off and launched a new event called Smoke Off The Water, using very similar iconography. The new food and music festival will benefit The Humane Society of Polk County to raise funds to support local pets in need. \"When we heard Smoke On The Water was not happening, the community was so upset,\" said Lisa Baker, the Humane Society of Polk County's executive director. \"We reached out to one of our old board members to say, 'If you like, we could try to have something like this happen at the Humane Society.'\" Smoke Off The Water will be held the same dates, Feb. 2 and 3, at 2400 Dundee Road in Winter Haven, a short distance down the road from the Humane Society's building. Baker said there will be an increased variety of food from barbecue to tacos and hamburgers, with more than a dozen food vendors scheduled to attend on an ever-growing list. Unfortunately, the new event will not be a judged or ranked barbecue competition under the Kansas City BBQ Society, Baker said. There are requirements that there be power and water for over 50 competition teams along with judges familiar with its unique scoring guidelines. The Humane Society wrote \"just wasn't available time due to the short notice of moving the event\" in a Facebook post. This change has forced Visit Central Florida to change its plans for the inaugural Florida Triple Crown of Barbecue Competition. It kicks off this weekend with Lakeland's annual Pigfest at Sun 'n Fun and the Aerospace Center for Excellence, located at 4175 Medulla Road, on Friday, from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., and Saturday, from 10 a.m to 5 p.m. Kris Keprios, senior tourism sales and marketing manager for Polk County, said the barbecue competition is part of growing the county's culinary tourism. Freshwater fishing: Bass are the top catch in Polk as the fish head to spawn \"Our aim is to make the county more of a culinary tourism destination,\" he said. \"One piece of that in Polk County is our heritage in barbecue.\" Keprios said many barbecue competition teams that started off in Polk County have grown to become national names in the industry, naming Whiskey Bent BBQ in Lakeland and Swamp Boys BBQ from Winter Haven . \"In talking with experts in the world of barbecue, it's said we have more competition championship teams from Polk County than anywhere else in the Southeast,\" he said. Barbecue competition teams will start off at Lakeland's Pigfest earning points in various food categories based on the Kansas City BBQ standards. The second stop, which was supposed to be Smoke On The Water, will be instead be Davenport's Grills Gone Wild on Feb. 9 and 10. The last leg of the triple crown, where the winners will be crowned, will be at Haines City's Ribs on the Ridge on Feb. 16 and 17. Keprios said teams' points for how they finish at each individual event will be tallied up to crown the ultimate winner who will receive a $1,500 price. The second-place winner will take home $1,000 with $500 for third place. Sara-Megan Walsh can be reached at swalsh@theledger.com or 863-802-7545. Follow on X @SaraWalshFl.",

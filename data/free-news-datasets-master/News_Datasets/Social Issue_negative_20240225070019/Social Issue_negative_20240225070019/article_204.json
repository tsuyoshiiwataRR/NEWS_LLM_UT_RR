    "text": "The Federal Court has ruled, The Trudeau government's announcement of the Emergency Measures Act to destroy “freedom convoys” in the winter of 2022 was “inappropriate” and “illegal”. This decision is more than a simple decision. This is a stinging and humiliating blow to liberals and all those who enthusiastically, if not happily, supported his determination to destroy a protest movement. excuses At the beginning of his term, Justin Trudeau demonstrated his extraordinary ease in offering a tearful apology for all the mistakes made by his predecessors. So we would expect him to accept his legal defeat with dignity and apologize for his excesses and his lack of judgment towards the truck drivers whom he unjustly demonized. This would have been the absolute minimum. But it was too much to expect from Trudeau. Since he could not tolerate contradiction, his government immediately announced its intention to appeal the case. It's disrespectful to taxpayers, who will pay the price for this approach, but it's certainly better. Ottawa has used and abused its power to manage civil dissent, and the justice system should be tough on it. By confirming the unconstitutionality of the use of this law, the Supreme Court, on the one hand, will serve a dire warning to future prime ministers who will be tempted to imitate Trudeau in getting rid of dissenting voices. This will restore Canadians' confidence in their institutions! On the other hand, this decision will mandate accountability, punishment of the culprits and compensation for the victims. Because, at the moment, nothing is planned. consequences However, a decision devoid of concrete consequences does more harm than good. By telling elected officials they can break the law with impunity, he invites them to increase the number of criminal acts. Canada is already doing very badly. No need to add more!",

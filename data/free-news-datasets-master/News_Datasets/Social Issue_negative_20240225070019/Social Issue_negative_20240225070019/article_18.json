Trump prevailed with 54.3 percent of the vote to Haley's 43.3 percent.\nDespite the Trump campaign's recent wins, Haley took the second-place finish on the chin and set her sights on the next primary election in her home state on February 24.\nMeanwhile, Kelly was baffled by Haley's decision to continue campaigning .\nArticle continues below advertisement Source: MEGA Haley lost by 11 points to Trump in New Hampshire on Tuesday.\n\"I don't know what Nikki Haley is going to do,\" Kelly said. \"I don't know if she's actually going to get out before she gets humiliated in her home state where he's beating her by 30 points, or if she's just going to kind of stick around kind of collecting random delegates.\"\n\"I have no idea what she's doing, but it's over. She's done. So we can pretend as long as she wants. He's won.\"\nNever miss a story — sign up for the RadarOnline.com newsletter to get your daily dose of dope. Daily. Breaking. Celebrity news.

There are dozens of states left to go.\"\n\"She lost! She talking about this like, 'Onward we go! Thank you so much! It's on!'\" Kelly laughed. \"It's a double loss and she's about to get crushed in South Carolina. There's no path .\"\nArticle continues below advertisement Source: MEGA Kelly said Trump's 'one-on-one' opponent needs to be 'someone who Republicans like.'\n\"Trump's definitely got his fair share of baggage and then some that Republicans should be considering in deciding who to nominate, but the other one needs to be someone who Republicans like,\" Kelly added. \"And for whatever reason, the way this campaign has come down, they don't like Nikki Haley anymore.\"\nPowered by RedCircle\nAdvertisement",

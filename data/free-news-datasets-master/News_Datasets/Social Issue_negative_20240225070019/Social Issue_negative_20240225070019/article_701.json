This is an increase of 3.2 percent since 2019, with 2 million more households being cost-burdened.\nOf these households, half of them, or 12.1 million, were severely burdened, meaning that they were spending more than half of their incomes on rents.\nThe share of cost-burdened households rose most significantly among middle-income households with incomes ranging between $30,000 to $75,000, the research found. Households with incomes lower than $30,000, a group already disproportionately likely to face housing price burdens, also saw an increase, with 1.5 percent more households with unaffordable rates.\nThe rise in unaffordability is due to historic increases in housing prices in recent years in combination with decades-long wage stagnation . The research found that, while median rents rose by 21 percent between 2001 and 2022, adjusting for inflation, renters’ incomes rose by only 2 percent.\nRelated Story News | Economy & Labor Greedflation Accounts for 53 Cents of Every Dollar of Inflation in Past 6 Months With the 2024 presidential election looming, 96 percent of Americans say inflation is an important issue to them. By Chris Walker , T ruthout January 22, 2024 Truthout Households with incomes lower than $30,000 already struggle the most with paying higher proportions of their rents, and this combination has hit them hardest; the researchers found that this group’s median residual income after paying rent and other needs like utilities was a record low of only $310 a month, a decrease of 47 percent since 2001. By contrast, the Economic Policy Institute says that, even in the most affordable areas, a single-person household needs $2,000 a month after housing for basic needs.\nMeanwhile, homelessness has reached record heights, with evictions increasing after the early pandemic-era eviction moratorium expired in 2021 and states ran out of rental assistance funds; since then, few policies have been put in place to prevent further housing instability. As of January 2023, over 653,000 people are experiencing homelessness in the U.S., a record high — with 71,000 people driven into homelessness in just the past year.\nMeasures put in place in response to the pandemic had helped renters significantly, but now, with soaring housing costs, the “need for rental assistance remains greater than ever,” the report notes.\nWith expiring resources for housing, the “housing safety net is once again overwhelmed and underfunded,” Chris Herbert, managing director for the Joint Center for Housing Studies, said in a press release . “And while states and localities have acted to fill some of the gaps, a larger commitment from the federal government is required to expand housing supports and preserve and improve the existing affordable stock. Only then will the nation finally make a meaningful dent in the housing affordability crisis making life so difficult for millions of people.”",

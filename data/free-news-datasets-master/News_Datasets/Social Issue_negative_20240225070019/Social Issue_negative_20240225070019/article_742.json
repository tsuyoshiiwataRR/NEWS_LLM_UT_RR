    "text": "The Helena City Commission has approved the creation of a committee with Lewis and Clark County and East Helena to review and recommend proposals for spending the state's opioid settlement funds. The city's unanimous approval given during Monday's regular meeting falls in lockstep with the county commission, which approved the same measure during its Jan. 18 meeting. The Montana Opioid Abatement Trust, or MOAT, is expected to receive more than $75 million over the next 18 years as part of the multi-state settlements reached with Teva, Allergan, CVS, Walgreens and Walmart. The dollars will be funneled to local communities for projects that expand access to addiction treatments, recovery services, education programs and law enforcement initiatives related to opioids. As a result, the state has been divided into five \"multi-county abatement regions\" and nine \"metro abatement regions,\" one of which is the Lewis and Clark Metro Abatement Region, all required to set up their own \"governance structure\" to review and recommend proposed uses for the money to the trust. People are also readingâ€¦ The memorandum of understanding between the local governing bodies establishes that governance structure in the form of a local trust advisory committee. The local committee will include five members, three elected officials from Helena, East Helena and Lewis and Clark County in addition to two citizen representatives from Helena and the county as appointed by their respective commissions. The cities and county will provide administrative assistance to the group. The memorandum will remain in effect for the next three years. Lewis and Clark County Public Health Officer Drenda Niemann told the city commission during a Nov. 29 administrative meeting that the cities and counties will also receive direct funds as a result of the settlement in addition to the state dollars being held in the trust. Niemann has been designated a MOAT trustee to represent the local metropolitan region. She said each municipality and county has a designated percentage of trust dollars for which they can apply to receive through a grant portal, which is expected to open within the next three months. \"I just want to make sure that both the city of Helena and Lewis and Clark County have those boxes checked before that portal opens because I don't want us to miss out on an opportunity to apply for those designated funds to come and help do opioid prevention work in our community,\" Niemann said. She also said as a trustee she will acknowledge a conflict of interest when local applications are reviewed and abstain from voting. \"The city's designated percentage is less than the county's overall, but both together could do some good work,\" Niemann said. Lewis and Clark County Grants and Purchasing Director Ann McCauley told the county commissioners during their Jan. 18 meeting that nonprofits, hospitals and school districts are also eligible applicants. McCauley said the county's designated percentage of the pot is estimated to be about $5 million in total over the next 18 years with about $600,000 presently available to the region. \"The trust funds are going to keep coming in every year, and as more settlements are settled, there will be additional funding, but that's kind of an unknown right now, how much more money that's going to be for the state,\" she said. Lewis and Clark County Commissioner Tom Rolfe said the estimates show a potential for about $250,000 a year to come to the county for opioid abatement. \"It's going to go up or down depending on the settlements, but each year it could be a substantial amount to work towards helping folks with problems with addiction to opioids, so it's nothing to sneeze at,\" Rolfe said.",

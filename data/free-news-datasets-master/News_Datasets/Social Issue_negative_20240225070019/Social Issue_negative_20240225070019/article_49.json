    "text": "Pizza Hut may be the latest franchise to face protests due the store's perceived support of Israel during the warfare currently happening in Gaza. Last week, Pizza Hut Israel's Instagram account reposted a photo from the user alex_shults which depicts two soldiers smiling and holding several pizza boxes in their hands. Quads News Network, a Palestinian youth news agency, took screenshots of the photo and posted it to X, formerly, known as Twitter. Boycotts: Why are people boycotting Starbucks? A look inside the scrutiny of the coffee chain Palestinian supporters are calling for consumers to boycott the pizza brand for their latest actions. The hashtag #boycottpizzahut has nearly half a million views on TikTok. On Pizza Hut's official Instagram page, the top comment on their latest post reads \"We ordered pizza tonight and it WASN'T from you #freepalestine.\" Pizza Hut officials have not made a statement regarding their Israel Instagram account or about potential consumer boycotts. Pizza Hut joins the likes of Starbucks that have received backlash due to their stances on the conflict in the Middle East. Palestinian supporters began boycotting Starbucks due to statements made by the company that refused to acknowledge their union's support of Palestine amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. Starbucks CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, released a public statement saying that the protests are stemming from a \"misrepresentation on social media of what we stand for.\" He goes on to say that the coffee chain stands for humanity. Starbucks will release a quarterly report in February which may give light to observe if the boycotts have affected their sales in a significant way.",

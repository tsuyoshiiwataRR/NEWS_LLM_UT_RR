The Lincoln Airport said in a statement that those flights were 85% full in 2023. “It’s disappointing to learn the airline has decided to discontinue the route, however we are very grateful United Airlines is dedicated to Lincoln by adding in additional flights to Denver and Chicago, which adds capacity to LNK as well as working towards bringing in larger aircraft for our community,” the airport said.

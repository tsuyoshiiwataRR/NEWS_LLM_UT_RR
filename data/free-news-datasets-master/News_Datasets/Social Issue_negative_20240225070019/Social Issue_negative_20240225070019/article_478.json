    "text": "Do Stanley cups contain lead? Company clears up social media rumors about tumblers There are concerns spreading online about the claim that the very popular Stanley cup tumblers contain lead. The social media reaction prompted Stanley to respond to the claims. \"Our manufacturing process currently employs the use of an industry standard pellet to seal the vacuum insulation at the base of our products; the sealing material includes some lead,\" Stanley wrote in a statement to WRAL News. \"Once sealed, this area is covered with a durable stainless steel layer, making it inaccessible to consumers. \"Rest assured that no lead is present on the surface of any Stanley product that comes into contact with the consumer nor the contents of the product.\" Stanley also said in the \"rare occurrence\" that the base cap of a product comes off and exposes the seal, customers are [eligible for the company's lifetime warranty](https://www.stanley1913.com/pages/contact-warranty). While lead is used in the manufacturing process, the product needs to become damaged to expose it, [a Stanley spokesperson told TODAY.com in a statement](https://www.today.com/health/news/stanley-cups-lead-rcna135513). On the bottom of each cup made by the beverage container powerhouse is a circular barrier made of stainless steel, which covers a pellet that contains lead, the Stanely spokesperson said. The pellet seals the product's vacuum insulation, and it is not accessible unless the stainless-steel barrier comes off — which is possible but “rare,” the Stanley spokesperson notes. “Our engineering and supply chain teams are making progress on innovative, alternative materials for use in the sealing process,” the spokesperson adds. In a [separate statement to NBC affiliate WCNC](https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/verify/stanley-cup-lead-health-verify/275-8e52adaf-2825-428f-8830-2543fcf54ec6), the company said all of its products follow all U.S. regulatory requirements. Exposure to lead can seriously harm a child’s health and well-being, [according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/prevention/health-effects.htm). Effects include: - Damage to the brain and nervous system - Slowed growth and development - Learning and behavior problems - Hearing and speech problems This can cause: - Lower IQ - Decreased ability to pay attention - Underperformance in school Dozens of TikTok videos looking for lead in Stanley tumblers have gotten hundreds of thousands of views. A lead poisoning prevention advocate that goes by Lead Safe Mama says she tested several Stanley tumblers sent to her after the protective cover at the bottom came off. In videos from March 2023, she said her tests detected lead. That's now gone viral, and Stanley is trying to calm fears. The only risk of exposure is if the cup is damaged and that protective steel cover on the bottom of the cup comes off, the Stanley spokesperson said. Stanley says this is rare and if it happens, you can submit a claim through the company's lifetime warranty. On the bottom of the Stanley cups, there is a little circular seam. If this nickel-sized plate comes off, that's when the lead would be exposed. Also, Stanley isn't the only tumbler maker that uses lead welds in their cups. The Consumer Product Safety Commission closely watches this exact thing and they have issued recalls when lead in a cup presents a danger. related Trending [ ](/story/patrick-cantlay-takes-off-pga-tour-board-hat-shoots-64-he-trails-thomas-detry-by-1-at-pebble-beach/21264074/) •Credits [Mark Bergin](/rs/bio/20199769/) [Ashley Rowe](/rs/bio/20876417/) [Pritchard Strong](/rs/bio/20215299/)",

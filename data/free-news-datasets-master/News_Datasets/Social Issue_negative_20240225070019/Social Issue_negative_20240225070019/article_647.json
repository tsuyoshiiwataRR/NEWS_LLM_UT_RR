    "text": "At just 14, Amani Smith was gunned down in the streets of Covington this week and his parents said it could have been prevented.\nAmani's mother, Amber Smith, said she'd been trying to get the Covington Independent School District to address threats directed at her older son since he got in a fight earlier this month.\nShe said it was this fight that led to the shooting on Tuesday on Decoursey Avenue. The teenage gunman was waiting for his older son, she said, but took aim at his little brother instead.\nSmith said her family knew there was trouble and tried to get officials at Holmes High School to address it.\n\"Everyone dismissed me,\" Smith said.\nAmani was found shot with another 14-year-old just before 3:30 p.m. Both teens were taken to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center where Amani was pronounced dead.\nSmith said the shooter, who has now been arrested, had gotten in a fight in the bathroom at school with her older son, Amani's brother.\nHe was suspended after the fight, which Smith said he did not start.\nFor her son, the conflict was over when the fight ended, Smith said, but then he started getting threatening social media messages.\nSmith said she went to the district and told them that the other teen was trying escalate things, but was ignored.\nShe said believes that the teen was waiting for her older son on Tuesday, but ended up seeing his little brother and fatally shooting him instead.\nSmith said she followed the chain of command and did everything she could to get district to intervene, but it didn't work.\nShe now plans to pull her children out of the district.\n'Too big to react' Smith said Amani and his older brother have spend their whole lives in Covington's Latonia neighborhood.\nShe's also struggled with the school district for years. Both of her boys are bigger than much of the other kids their age, and they were told to just take whatever abuse came their way.\n\"I was told they're too big to react,\" Smith said.\nShe said she is sick of not feeling supported by school and police officials.\nSince Amani was killed, Smith said there were false rumors being spread that her older son was going shoot up the school.\nSmith said police came to her home at 2 a.m. saying they were investigating the threat.\nShe asks: where were they weeks ago when I was trying to get help?\nArrest made The Covington Independent School District declined to comment on Smith's accusations. The district has called the killing tragic and said it was working to support its students and staff.\nA 17-year-old has been arrested Wednesday in connection with the killing. Covington police have not released the name of the teen due to his age.\nKenton County Commonwealth's Attorney Rob Sander said he expects the teen will be charged as an adult.",

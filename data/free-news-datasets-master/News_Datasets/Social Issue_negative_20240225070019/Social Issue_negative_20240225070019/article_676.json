    "text": "MODESTO, Calif. (TND) — The Modesto Police Department discovered homeless people living in caves during a clean-up operation this past weekend. The individuals dug dwellings into the Tuolumne River banks. This particular area has been plagued by vagrancy and illegal camps, which have raised concerns due to the fact that these camps were actually caves dug into the riverbanks,” the Modesto Police Department [stated]. Officers collaborated with local community volunteer group 9.2.99 to remove 7,600 pounds of trash along with a trailer and two truckloads of garbage. Officials notified the homeless people about the clean-up and offered services to assist with living transitions beforehand. The City of Modesto plans to destroy all of the caves and construct barricades preventing access to the river, according to KCRA. The city will also post signage prohibiting residents from trespassing. The city recognizes the importance of not only addressing the immediate safety risks but also working towards a comprehensive solution to permanently eliminate these caves,\" the city stated, according to [KCRA]. \"Our commitment is to navigate this situation with diligence, taking into account the structural safety of the surrounding areas.\" Police conducted a similar operation in 2022. Officers placed two adults and one dog from the caves into a residency program, removed more than 10,000 pounds of trash and cleaned several camps. “This was a collaborative effort between members of the Modesto Police Department, Operation 9.2.99, the City of Modesto and residents in this area,” the police department [wrote](https://m.facebook.com/modestopolice/posts/509503034544932/). “Without the cooperation and collaboration of all those involved, none of this would have been possible.”",

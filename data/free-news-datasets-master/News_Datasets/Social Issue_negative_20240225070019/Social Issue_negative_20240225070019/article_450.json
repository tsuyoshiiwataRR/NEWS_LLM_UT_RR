    "text": "New England Patriots rookie wide receiver Kayshon Boutte has reportedly been arrested on illegal online gaming charges. WAFB 9 reported the news on Thursday.\nPer the report, some of the alleged illegal gaming occurred when Boutte was still in college at LSU. He is accused of creating a fake account representing himself as 21 years old or older, despite being underaged for gambling.\nThis enabled him to place “thousands of different bets including some on LSU football” with “several hundred thousand dollars” in wagers and payouts.\nBoutte has since turned himself in with one misdemeanor charge and a felony. He was set to be booked at East Baton Rouge Parish Prison and be released after posting $6,000 bond.\nThere was a time when Boutte was believed to be one of the best receiving prospects in the country, but he ultimately fell to the Patriots in the sixth-round of the 2023 NFL draft. He failed to make an impact in his first year with only five game appearances and two receptions for 19 yards.\nPer WAFB 9, through a source, Boutte “never bet ‘against himself'” and isn’t being accused of throwing games in college.\nMore Patriots News Falcons hire a new head coach, and it isn't Bill Belichick Patriots spokesperson releases statement on WR Kayshon Boutte's arrest Michael Strahan says 'no way' Giants beat 2007 Patriots in playoff series",

    "text": "Deutsche Post has announced the end of an important service. The service will continue until December 2024, then it will finally end.\nThe end of an era begins: For many years, Deutsche Post also took care of lost property and, if possible, delivered it to its owner. The postal company charges a fee for this, but what are a few euros compared to a lot of stress and hassle.\nKey service is discontinued\nBut the “key service” will end in December 2024, as the company states in its list of services and prices. So far, found keys can be thrown into the mailbox without postage.\nIf they have a tag with a deliverable address, the post office delivers the keys to a lost and found service provider, who then sends the key to the owner. This costs the owners a one-off fee of 8.50 euros.\nIt is not the case that the name and address are printed on the trailer. That would be an extreme security gap with front door keys. Rather, there are codes printed on the tags that customers can buy from relevant service providers.\nThe change is also hitting this industry hard\nService providers like Keymail, KeyGarant or Payback are hit hard by the discontinuation of the service because they ultimately sell these special key fobs. As the consumer portal Paketda reports, Keymail alone has around 750,000 customers in Germany.\nThe company announced that it would now work with Deutsche Post on a solution so that the service could still be offered in 2025. The Keymail key fobs could also be reported as found via SMS. An alternative may emerge.\nNevertheless, the discontinuation of the service is likely to cause sadness for many, after all, lost keys are a huge nuisance.\n- ” Tip: The best VPN providers for more security and data protection\n- » Buy balcony power plant: Comparison of the best solar systems\nDon’t miss anything with this NETWORK WORLDNewsletter\nEvery Friday: The most informative and entertaining summary from the world of technology!",

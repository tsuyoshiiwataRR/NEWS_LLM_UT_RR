    "text": "A prisoner in Edinburgh has died after overdosing on a mix of drugs smuggled into the [prison](https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/all-about/crime). He was found to have taken an excessive amount of street valium and a new drug that is being smuggled in on paper, posing as letters to inmates. David Nisbet Welch was remanded at HMP Edinburgh for assault to severe [injury](https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/all-about/health), permanent impairment, and danger of life in March 2020.

A Fatal Accident Inquiry into his death heard Welch had worked as a pantry passman and was said to be \"well liked\" in the hall. Months prior to his death, staff at the prison reported no concerns including medical ones and noted that there was nothing suspicious about his behaviour. However, on February 14, 2021, two prison officers delivered breakfast to his cell and left it on the desk. Welch never came to the door.

One officer knocked Welch with his foot and heard him \"grunt\" but just a few hours later, he was found lying face down on the bed. He was described as being \"purple\" in colour with blood coming from his nose. A search of his cell failed to find any sign of controlled drugs, illicit substances or drug paraphernalia. However, following his death, prison staff were told that he had shown another prisoner a \"quantity\" of etizolam also known as street Valium. The inquiry heard that he had been told that it was \"far too much to be taking at one time\" by fellow prisoners. It was further reported that over the weekend he had consumed a new drug, which was being called Amo. The drug was being smuggled into prisons across Scotland by being soaked into paper and then sent as letters to prisoners. The paper was boiled in a kettle and the water was drunk or used to make tea. Welch's cause of death was concluded to be caused by the \"ingestion of a combination of drugs, combined with pre-existing coronary artery atherosclerosis\". The report added: \"These likely acted in combination leading to progressive respiratory depression, coma and ultimately death.\" Sheriff Kelly KC concluded: \"It is tragically regrettable that this combination of drugs did find its way into the prison estate and contributed to the untimely death of Mr Welch. This Inquiry strengthened the need to take due care in these routines (of checking patients) to be sure that officers see the face of and obtain a response from all prisoners. \"With numerous cells to check and with checks being required three or four times per day, the risk of becoming slapdash in receiving a verbal response is evident.\" A Scottish Prison Service spokesperson said: \"We fully recognise the impact on loved ones when someone dies in custody and our thoughts remain with the family of Mr Welch. Our staff work hard to tackle the introduction of illicit substances and prevent the harm they cause. \"We have seen the success of some measures, such as the photocopying of mail, in stopping that supply into our establishments. However, we are not complacent and will continue to do all we can to safeguard the health and wellbeing of people in our care.\" Sign up for Edinburgh Live's newsletter Get all the latest news and headlines from Edinburgh, Fife and the Lothians sent straight to your inbox twice a day by signing up to our free newsletter.

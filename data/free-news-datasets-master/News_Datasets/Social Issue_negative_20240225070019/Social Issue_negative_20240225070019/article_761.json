    "text": "- ‘Happy Australia Day’ is considered politically incorrect in light of its dark history - There are growing calls to change the date of the holiday - Tens of thousands are expected to protest across the country on Friday Thank you for reading this post, don't forget to Share! Wishing someone a ‘Happy Australia Day’ could be seen as insulting, according to Indigenous community advocates. Kado Muir, a leading advocate for Aboriginal culture, heritage and consciousness, said the phrase was an “ignorant gesture”. “This issue is extremely divisive and sensitive for all Australians,” Mr Muir told News LTD in 2019. “I know White Australia is guilty and vulnerable. I know Black Australia is broken and angry.” Leading advocate for Aboriginal culture, heritage and awareness Kado Muir (pictured) said the phrase ‘Happy Australia Day’ was an ‘ignorant gesture’ Prominent Aboriginal campaigner Cheree Toka (pictured) said many people were swapping the term ‘Australia Day’ for ‘Survival Day’ He called on Australians to rise above the “basic destructive emotions” in the debate and instead shift the focus to the aspects that unite the country. Leading Aboriginal campaigner Cheree Toka said many people were swapping the term ‘Australia Day’ for ‘Survival Day’. She said National Day of Remembrance on January 26 was a sad day for First Nations people. January 26 marks the anniversary of the 1788 arrival of the ‘First Fleet’ at Sydney Cove, which carried mainly convicts and troops from Britain. For many Indigenous Australians, who trace their ancestry on the continent back 50,000 years, it is ‘Invasion Day’, the start of the British colonization of Aboriginal lands and their brutal subjugation. “Celebrating Australia Day on January 26 is insulting,” said Joe Williams, a mental health professional and former professional rugby league player. The ‘Change The Date’ movement has escalated in recent years as more and more protesters took to the streets of capital cities over the holiday to show their support for Indigenous Australians. Tens of thousands are expected to march across the country through the CBD on Friday, carrying the Aboriginal flag and banners calling for change. Major companies have also started to rethink their branding strategies as the campaign continues to gain momentum. The 28-year-old pushes for the Aboriginal flag to be flown atop the Sydney Harbor Bridge all year round (pictured, Ms Toka) Thousands of Australians are expected to protest the national holiday as Australia Day celebrations kick off today In December it was announced that 80 municipalities had decided to scrap citizenship ceremonies on January 26, amid growing divisions around the national holiday. Earlier this month, Woolworths sparked controversy after announcing it would no longer sell Australia Day merchandise. “Over recent years, demand for Australia Day merchandise from our stores has gradually declined. At the same time, there has been a broader discussion about January 26 and what it means for different parts of the community,” said the supermarket giant, which also owns Big W stores. ‘We know that many people like to use this day as a time to come together and we offer a wide variety of products to help customers celebrate the day as they choose. “Woolworths and BIG W celebrate the best of Australia every day, and we are proud to support the farmers, producers and suppliers who work with us.” Aldi later announced it would also not be stocking Australian-themed merchandise in its dedicated buying section this year. The supermarkets join Kmart after the discount retailer discontinued its Australia Day merchandise in 2023.",

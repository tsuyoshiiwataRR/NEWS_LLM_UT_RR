    "text": "Former Olympian’s home robbed, memorabilia stolen, Roswell police say ROSWELL, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - A thief stole Olympic memorabilia and other items from a former Olympian’s home in Roswell, according to the city’s police department. “There’s so many memories and such a sense of pride attached to being a part of Team USA, that’s mainly what I want back. And I hope they find who did this,” said Chris Kinney, in an interview with Atlanta News First on Thursday. Police said Christopher Kinney, 35, spoke with police after noticing his home cameras had been disconnected. When police arrived at the apartment, they saw the side door of Kinney’s apartment pried open. Police said the apartment was “ransacked and trashed.” Kinney was out of town at the time of the burglary. “All of my jackets are gone, anything with the Olympic logo on it and Team USA is all gone,” Kinney said. A friend of Kinney’s was able to give video footage of the incident and help Kinney determine what had been stolen. Kinney noticed that the thief had taken Olympic jackets, pins and a comforter, along with personal documents and two swords. Video footage showed a Hispanic male wearing a white mask, blue jeans and blue jacket disabling the cameras, according to police. Kinney, who grew up in Stockbridge, competed in the four-man bobsled event in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Kinney said also taken were family heirlooms including a doll given to him by his grandmother along with his car keys. “My TV, my camera and stuff, those are things can be replaced. It sucks to have to replace them. But I can’t put a value on my Team USA stuff and the stuff I got from my grandmother,” Kinney said. If you have any information on the whereabouts of the stolen items, you’re encouraged to reach out to the Roswell Police Department. Copyright 2024 WANF. All rights reserved.",

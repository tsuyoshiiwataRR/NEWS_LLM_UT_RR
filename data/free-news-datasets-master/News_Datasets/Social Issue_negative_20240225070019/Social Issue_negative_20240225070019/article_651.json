Other scorers for West were Haven Simpson with four points, Kalyssa Dinkins with three points and Kaylee Dyke with one point.\nCybil Penland led Sevier County with 16 points, while Kaliyah Burden had 15 points.\nThe Bearettes started things from the get go with eight straight points to start. West finally got on the board with a Weddington bucket, but Sevier County scored three more to lead 11-2. West scored again on a 3-pointer by Messer, but Sevier County scored seven of the last nine points of the quarter to lead, 18-7.\nThe second quarter was the killer for Morristown West, as they scored just eight points and gave up 24 points. Messer scored six of the points for West, but they trailed 42-15 at the half.\nWest tried to cut into the lead in the third, as Messer scored six of the first eight points. Messer finished with 10 points in the half, but Sevier County regrouped and led 62-33 after three.\nIn the fourth quarter, both teams scored seven points each as Sevier County cruised to the win.

    "text": "Stolen vehicle chase from Kansas to Nebraska ends with arrest LINCOLN, Neb. (KOLN) - A pursuit of a stolen vehicle from Kansas to Nebraska ends with a 19-year-old man in custody. Thursday at approximately 1:40 a.m., NSP learned that Kansas law enforcement authorities were in pursuit of a stolen Mercury Milan traveling northbound toward Nebraska on Highway 281. After entering Nebraska, Webster County sheriffâ€™s deputies located the vehicle and picked up the pursuit. The vehicle turned westbound onto Highway 136. A trooper, along with a Franklin County deputy joined the pursuit as the vehicle continued fleeing through Franklin County. A Harlan County deputy was then able to successfully deploy stop sticks to bring the vehicle to a stop near the county line. The driver then fled on foot into a field. After a search utilizing a thermal drone and K9 to track the subject, the driver was located and taken into custody. Silas Cooper, 19, of Mount Airy, North Carolina, was arrested for willful reckless driving, flight to avoid arrest, theft by unlawful taking, and obstructing a peace officer. He was lodged in Harlan County Jail. [Click here](https://www.1011now.com/newsletter/) to subscribe to our 10/11 NOW daily digest and breaking news alerts delivered straight to your email inbox.

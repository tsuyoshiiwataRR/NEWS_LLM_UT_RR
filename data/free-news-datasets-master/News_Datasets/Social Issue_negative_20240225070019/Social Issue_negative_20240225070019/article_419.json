    "text": "Coweta County commissioners shot down a shopping and entertainment development in Sharpsburg after the developers submitted an amended site plan one day before the public hearing. The original plan included more than 24 acres, 13 of which were requested to be zoned C-6 minor shopping commercial and 11 of which were proposed for C-9 commercial amusement zoning. There would have been four retail, restaurant and office buildings on the property zoned C-6 and a miniature golf course and indoor amusements including an arcade and bowling. The property is currently zoned rural conservation. Lisa Eschman, zoning coordinator, presented the original application and the zoning departments recommended conditions before saying that a new site plan had been submitted by email the day before. The original plan was submitted on July 21, 2023. “The revised site plan was not reviewed by staff, therefore it was not included in my presentation,” Eschman said. “The applicant is here, and they are more than welcome to present the revised site plan.” When asked later, she said that after just a cursory look at the new plan a proposed 50,000-square-foot building in the site plan would not have been allowed under the requested C-6 zoning. “The maximum for C-6 is 35,000 square feet for one single enterprise,” she said. “They would have to go to the next zoning district, which is C-7.” Commissioner Paul Poole said the public has not been made aware of these changes. Commissioner Al Smith asked if the commissioners should even continue considering the plan. “I’m conflicted,” Smith said. Commission Chair John Reidelbach agreed. “Making a decision tonight, we don’t know what the outcome will be because they’re going to change the plans,” Reidelbach said. Attorney Nathan Lee said legally the commissioners could consider the new plan, but he questioned whether that would be fair to the public. “I think if you have to base your decision, it should be based on the application that was presented in accordance with your ordinances,” Lee said. County Administrator Michael Fouts said that typically any changes are due seven days prior to the public hearing in order to notify the public of the change and remove it from the agenda. But there had been no request to remove it from the agenda. The application was submitted on behalf of Justin Gibson, who owned the Heirloom Market Company and Bakeshop that was destroyed in a fire in September 2023. Heirloom still operates a bakeshop in downtown Newnan and LaGrange, as well as a store and donut shop in Peachtree City. Neal Spradlin, who represented Heirloom Market Company, said the changes, including consolidating four of the buildings into one two-story building, were made to ease parking and traffic flow, as well as, add more green space. “It doesn’t change the scope of the project at all,” Spradlin said. Ryan Huber, a partner in the project, said they were unaware that submitting the new plan would cause confusion. “Those submissions for the other site plan, we can withdraw,” Huber said. Several residents spoke in favor of the project including Jake Mullins, who said he lived 2,000 feet from the proposed project. “It’s not a matter of if this parcel is going to go commercial, it’s who and what,” Mullins said. Mullins liked that the project was being proposed by local entrepreneurs, particularly by Justin Gibson, owner of Heirloom Market Company and Bake Shop. “(Heirloom) was an amazing place, amazing people, just the community, the support,” Mullins said. “It’s unlike any other bakery shop I’ve ever seen and one of the saddest things I’ve seen in recent history is Justin Gibson, with his head buried in his hands the day after it burned down.” Phil Hensel said the old horse farm where the project is proposed has been up for sale for a long time. “As much as I would like to see the county stay rural, there was clearly not a demand from the public for another horse farm.” There were also several people opposed to the project. Clark Verbockel said the traffic from any additional commercial enterprises would overwhelm the roads there. “I don’t think Lower Fayetteville Road is ready for anything like this yet or any commercialization,” Verbockel said. Linda Menk said that the area’s rural character should be preserved. “(The horse farms are) part of the charm of Coweta County,” Menk said. “That’s one of the reasons that has attracted so many people to Coweta County.” Andy Powell, who with his wife pastures horses on a 30 acre farm on Lower Fayetteville Road, said he believes Heirloom intends the best for the neighbors, but C-9 zoning is intense zoning for that area. Robert Reeder has lived nearby for 30 years, he said. He has a horse farm and raised his family on the rural property and is opposed to the project. It was his understanding that no more commercial entrances would be added to that part of Lower Fayetteville Road, he said. “There was an agreement made,” Reeder said, referring to the Fischer Marketplace project across Lower Fayetteville Road. “It was to protect everybody up that way and on Fischer as well and it’s worked… This would completely undo that.” The commissioners unanimously denied the rezoning request and a second request for a buffer variance for the project. In other business, the council members: Approved rezoning a 3.8-acre vacant lot off of Highway 16 East between East Willow Drive and RV Drive from light manufacturing auto industrial to light manufacturing for a self storage facility. The commissioners also approved a variance allowing a 25 foot buffer along the entire western border of the property. Denied a request for a front yard setback for two lots on Bears Bend Subdivision in Moreland. Approved a 12-month extension for Habiba Investments for a property at 869 Poplar Road. The original agreement was for the company to apply for a building permit within one year. It has already applied for a land disturbance permit. Accepted roadways and the execution of a deed of open space associated with property in Belle Hall Subdivision. Reappointed Reidelbach as a committee member of the Three Rivers Regional Council. Appointed Poole, Director of Transportation Planning Sid Bedenbaugh, Grants Manager Charlyn Shepherd, Communications Manager Cathy Wickey, Tommy Kennedy and Harvey Smith to the Coweta County Transit Technical Coordinating Committee. Their new terms will end on Dec. 31, 2025. Approved spending $20,000 in special purpose local option sales tax dollars for an estimation of engineering services required by the Georgia Department of Transportation for a widening project on Poplar Road and improvements to the intersection of Poplar Road and Highway 16. Approved a number of bids for tree pruning totaling about $99,139. Rejected all bids associated with the construction of the Senoia Fire Station and for renovation of the 911 center because they exceeded the amount budgeted for the projects. The county will rebid the fire station project. Approved an agreement with the Coweta County School System to allow the system to lease space on the telecommunications tower for $6,000 a year. Approved a quit claim deed for the 1.93 acre property at 22 Broad St. to the Coweta County Development Authority for marketing. Approved the Nov. 7 election results for the 2025 SPLOST. The SPLOST was approved by the public. Approved elected officials salaries and supplements. Approved a line of duty death benefit for all employees effective Jan. 1, 2024. The benefit allows a spouse and children of the deceased employee to remain on the group health insurance plan for up to six months in the case of the spouse or up to the age of 26 in the case of the children. Approved a Victims of Crime Act Grant Award to the District Attorney’s Office. The grant is for $81,368 and requires a match of $20,342. Approved right of entry associated with storm drain repairs at 384 Marsha Way, 15, 25 and 30 Navaho Way and 120 Indian Bluff Drive all in Sharpsburg. Approved a request to use the Justice Center for the Regional Mock Trial Competition on Saturday, Feb. 10. Held an executive session to discuss personnel after which they approved an unnamed personnel action.

    "text": "HOUSTON COUNTY, Ga. â€” A 57-year-old man will spend the next 30 years in prison after being convicted on aggravated child molestation charges in Houston County, according to a press release from the [Houston County District Attorney's Office.](https://www.houstoncountyga.org/government/district-attorney.cms) Eugene Charles Flaute was convicted Wednesday after a two-day trial, the district attorney's office says. The press release said Flaute was accused of \"multiple incidents of sexual abuse performed on a child over an extended period of time.\" \"People like this have no place in society, we are pleased with the conviction and sentence, but know we cannot undo what has been done,\" District Attorney Will Kendall said in the release. \"At the end of the day, we must protect our children, safeguard them and protect them from the evil in the world.\" Flaute was sentenced by Judge Katherine Lumsden to 30 years in prison followed by life on probation, the release said. They note that he is not eligible for parole, and he will be subject to the conditions of probation for sex offenders. The case was prosecuted by Assistant District Attorneys Justin C Duane and Brian J. Huckaby. In the media release, Duane emphasized how child sexual abuse is \"an unfortunate reality but a reality,\" saying that sexual abuse happens more often than people understand. \"Any day that we can remove a sexual predator from our community is a great day,\" Daune said in the release. \"I am grateful that the jury held the defendant accountable for his disgusting actions... I am glad that we were able to give the child in this case a voice.\" 13WMAZ+ Get more news and information from 13WMAZ by downloading our 13WMAZ+ app on our Roku and Amazon Fire Stick devices.

No illegal aliens shall collect any benefits on behalf of a minor. Deport the whole family. These states must REFUSE to acknowledge driver's licenses issued to illegal aliens from sanctuary states! Arrest them, impound the vehicle, and deport them. Just like states pass different Concealed Carry laws, those laws are not honored in non-concealed carry states! Same with these driver's licenses issued to illegal aliens. Deem them NULL & VOID. Updated list of states announcing they stand w/ Texas in border dispute w/ federal government.

Hopefully the list will grow and Governor Abbott will remain strong. Please add more States to this thread if you see them. Thank you.

This is a fire code violation. There should be lawsuits and fines against this. Airports are not shelters, hotels, or halfway houses for illegal aliens to shack up and loiter!

But Texas shouldn't have to do it alone. All Red State governors should rally behind Texas and defend our national sovereignty. Every state is a border state so every state should help shoulder the burden.

    "text": "Vehicles queuing at the Port of Dover in August 2023.\nTourists heading to Europe could face waits of up to 14 hours at border controls under a new scheme due to come in this October, MPs have been told.\nThe Port of Dover and the surrounding area could be hit by major disruption when the EU Entry-Exit System launches unless measures are introduced to prevent delays, parliament’s European scrutiny committee heard.\nAshford borough council, responsible for Dover, told the committee that 14-hour queues were a “reasonable worst case” scenario if the scheme is implemented as planned later this year.\nThe new controls will mean people entering the EU will have to register their fingerprints and a photograph alongside their passport.\nThe Port of Dover and surrounding roads have seen multiple episodes of gridlocked traffic over the past few years, with post-Brexit checks adding to waiting times.\nThe tourist organisation Visit Kent voiced concerns that delays caused by the new system could have a knock-on effect on local businesses, which has been the case during previous periods of disruption.\nAshford council said 14-hour delays at the port would likely lead to queues along the A20 and M20 that could block access to staff and tourist traffic at Eurotunnel in Folkestone.\nEurostar said that without upgrades, terminals could see queues of more than an hour at peak times. High Speed 1, which runs UK high-speed rail services, said the decision not to enable online pre-registration would “put enormous pressure on infrastructure at St Pancras International”.\nDowning Street sought to downplay the risks of delays. A No 10 spokesperson said: “On some of those scenarios, rightly we’re not going to get into hypotheticals about delays … but there are tried and tested contingency plans in place and a lot of work is managed by the Kent resilience forum so we will make sure we’re prepared and our focus remains on ensuring the scheme does not unnecessarily impact local communities or result in delays for travellers.\n“We are working very closely as you would expect with the French, with all the port authorities, to ensure that travellers and passengers do not experience unnecessary delays – that work continues.”\nThe chair of the committee, Sir Bill Cash, said: “Queues of more than 14 hours, vehicles backed up along major roads, businesses starved of footfall: this evidence paints an alarming picture of the possible risks surrounding the Entry-Exit System’s implementation.\n“Clearly, this policy could have a very serious impact, not only for tourists and travel operators but also for local businesses. I implore decision makers on both sides of the Channel to take note of this evidence.\n“The scheme is due to be implemented in October this year; the clock is ticking, and these issues must be urgently addressed.”",

    "text": "The Telegraph Nasa says goodbye to Ingenuity after historic helicopter makes emergency landing on Mars Read full article Our Foreign Staff 26 January 2024 at 0:08 am · 2-min read Ingenuity\nNasa said on Thursday that its miniature robot helicopter Ingenuity – which in 2021 became the first aircraft to achieve powered flight on another planet – can no longer fly, ending a mission on Mars that lasted far longer than originally planned.\nThe US space agency said Ingenuity made an “emergency landing” during its second-to-last flight last week.\nDuring its final trip on January 18, the craft lost contact with Perseverance, the rover from which Ingenuity deployed in 2021, when it was flying about 3 feet (1 metre) above the ground while descending to land.\nEngineers restored contact with Ingenuity the next day, and photographs taken days later showed damage to one of its carbonfibre rotorblades.\nAn image released by Nasa that was taken by Ingenuity’s onboard camera captured the aircraft’s shadow on the Martian surface, appearing to show one of its rotorblades broken.\n“We’re investigating the possibility that the blade struck the ground,” Nasa Administrator Bill Nelson said.\n“It is bittersweet that I must announce that Ingenuity, the ‘little helicopter that could’ – and it kept saying, ‘I think I can, I think I can’ – well, it has now taken its last flight on Mars,” Mr Nelson said in a video posted on social media.\nPerseverance, which carried Ingenuity on its belly , landed on the Martian surface in February 2021.\nWhat began as a planned 30-day mission to demonstrate five short flights on Mars turned into a nearly three-year scientific endeavour involving 72 flights .\nIngenuity flew a combined distance in its various flights that was 14 times farther than originally planned, Nasa said.\nFollowing Ingenuity’s debut flight in April 2021 – buzzing above the surface of Mars for 39 seconds – Nasa officials hailed the achievement by the 4lb (1.8kg) solar-powered aircraft as one that would help pave the way for a new mode of aerial exploration on the Red Planet and other destinations in the solar system, such as Venus and Saturn’s moon Titan.\nStory continues Ingenuity resembles a box with four legs and a twin-rotor parasol, designed for flight in the thin Martian atmosphere that requires more power than similar craft on Earth.\nOn that initial flight, it climbed as programmed to a height of 10 feet above the surface, then hovered in place while pivoting 96 degrees before making a safe touchdown.\nNasa compared the feat to the Wright Brothers’ historic first controlled flight of their motor-driven airplane near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina in 1903.\nThe helicopter’s success in early demonstration flights earned it a more productive role on Mars, helping scout location targets for Perseverance with its tiny onboard camera. The craft survived almost 1,000 Martian days, Nasa said, which included the planet’s frigid winter seasons.\nPerseverance is currently too far away to photograph Ingenuity’s final resting site but Nasa engineers will now run final tests on Ingenuity and download the remaining images from its onboard computer.\nTRENDING Putin sparks fears of war with Nato with visit to Kaliningrad The Telegraph · 4-min read Sofía Vergara admits her ‘giant’ chest opened door to fame BANG Showbiz · 2-min read The Princess of Wales's health history revealed, as she recovers from abdominal surgery Evening Standard · 5-min read Boy, 9, who lived alone for two years in unheated flat went unnoticed because he was ‘a good pupil’ The Independent · 2-min read Three Kansas City Chiefs fans found frozen to death in friend’s backyard - two days after their last sighting The Independent · 2-min read",

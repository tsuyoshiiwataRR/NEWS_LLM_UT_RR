The remaining 56 percent of Americans would have to take other actions, with more than a third saying they would be forced to go deeper into debt.\nSixteen percent of Americans would reduce their spending habits elsewhere in order to cover the cost of an emergency, the survey found, while 35 percent would have to borrow money to pay for it, either through taking out a personal loan, paying through credit cards or asking family members or friends for aid. Five percent said they’d “do something else,” an answer which Bankrate didn’t delve into.\nThe survey also found that 57 percent of Americans are uncomfortable with the amount of savings they have for emergencies. Twenty-two percent of Americans have no emergency fund set up at all — the second lowest rate in Bankrate’s history of polling on the question.\nRelated Story News | Economy & Labor Greedflation Accounts for 53 Cents of Every Dollar of Inflation in Past 6 Months With the 2024 presidential election looming, 96 percent of Americans say inflation is an important issue to them. By Chris Walker , T ruthout January 22, 2024 Truthout The U.S. has been experiencing numerous positive economic indicators as of late , including low unemployment, a reduction in inflation and continued economic growth over the past year. On Thursday, the Commerce Department announced that the gross domestic product grew by 3.3 percent in the past year .\nHowever, those economic gains aren’t being felt in households across the country, as inflation has raised the costs of goods to the point where most Americans say they are living paycheck-to-paycheck .\nThe issue is likely to play a major role in the 2024 presidential election. Typically, incumbent presidents are viewed as more vulnerable when the economy isn’t doing well . The fact that most Americans aren’t experiencing the effects of positive economic indicators firsthand could be problematic for President Joe Biden, who is seeking reelection in the fall.\nPolling data on the question is indeed alarming for Biden. According to an Economist /YouGov poll published this week , 19 out of 20 registered voters (95 percent) view inflation and rising prices as an important issue. Those voters also gave Biden failing marks on the matter — just 37 percent of registered voters approve of Biden when it comes to inflation and prices, while 58 percent disapprove.",

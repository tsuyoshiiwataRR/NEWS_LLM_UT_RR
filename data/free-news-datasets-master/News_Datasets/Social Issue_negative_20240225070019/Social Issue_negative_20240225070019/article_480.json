    "text": "Jaipur: A resident of Balotra district, Ramaram Bishnoi, who allegedly uploaded on social media a morphed obscene video of Independent MLA Bayana Ritu Banawat, was arrested in Maharashtra’s Kolhapur on Wednesday. A police officer said that Bishnoi had a cosmetics shop in Kolhapur. “The accused was brought to Bayana for interrogation. He had no prior connection with the MLA, and there was no animosity; it was purely for garnering social media reach,” the officer said.Police officers revealed that the youth had previously uploaded a similar video featuring former Barmer MLA, Mewaram Jain, which fetched him good response on social media. Subsequently, he uploaded the morphed video of Banawat.Banawat had last week filed a complaint with the Assembly Speaker and police, stating that morphed obscene videos were circulating on social media with her name and image. These videos were being shared as reels on platforms like Facebook and X from various accounts, accompanied by captions referring to them as related to the MLA, she said.Banawat said she became aware of the deepfake videos after receiving calls from acquaintances, leading her to submit a complaint to the Bharatpur SP. Speaker Vasudev Devnani also sought a report in this regard. The MLA urged people not to share the videos and to report intentional sharing. Emphasizing that it was the government's responsibility to ensure that women were safe in Rajasthan, she asked, “If this is happening to a politically established woman, then what would be the common woman’s condition?”A police officer said, “The cyber cell tracked down the handles from where the video was circulated. Linking the chain, it reached the accused.”",

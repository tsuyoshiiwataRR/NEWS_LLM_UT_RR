    "text": "A man and woman whose bodies were found by Moline police on Wednesday were shot to death. Officers found bodies of Steven Herring, 55, and Donna Ericson, 79, during two different calls Wednesday morning, according to the Moline Police Department. Police found Herring around 9:41 a.m. at a residence in the 3300 block of 25th Avenue. Officers found Ericson at about 10:37 a.m. at a residence in the 1800 block of 46th Street. Both had gunshot wounds, and their deaths have been ruled homicides. During the investigation, detectives learned Ericson's son was Chad Hillyer, 55, Aledo, the department said. Hillyer was also a close friend of Herring. Evidence indicated his possible involvement in the killings. During the investigation, police recovered video footage that placed a vehicle belonging to Hillyer near both addresses early Wednesday, according to the department. Officers also gathered other evidence, including telephone records and interviews. People are also reading… Around 7:30 p.m., Moline police officers, Illinois State Police troopers and Mercer County Sheriff’s Office deputies executed a search warrant at Hillyer’s Aledo property, the police department said. The team did not find Hillyer there, but found a shell casing. There were also casings recovered when Herring and Ericson's bodies were found. Moline police took the casings to the Davenport Police Department for processing through the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, the department said. That examination indicated that the casings were used in the same handgun. At around 9 p.m. Wednesday, Coralville police officers found a body in a vehicle on a rural road near Tiffin, according to the Moline police. Investigators identified the dead person as Hillyer and determined that he had a gunshot wound that appeared self-inflicted. The Rock Island County Coroner's Office had scheduled autopsies on Herring and Ericson for Friday. Both the Moline and Coralville police continued their investigations Thursday afternoon, the Moline Police Department said. The Moline Police Department asked that anyone with information about the case contact investigators at 309-797-0401. Persons with information can also call the Quad-Cities chapter of Crime Stoppers at 309-762-9500 or use the P3 Tips app. Multiple other agencies assisted Moline’s police in the investigation, according to the department. They were the Rock Island County Sheriff’s Office, the Rock Island County State’s Attorney’s Office, the Johnson County Medical Examiner’s Office, and the Rock Island and Milan police departments.",

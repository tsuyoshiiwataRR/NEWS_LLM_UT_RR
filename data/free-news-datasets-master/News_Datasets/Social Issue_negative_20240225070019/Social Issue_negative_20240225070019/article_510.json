    "text": "Buaphan, a mentally unstable vagrant, was found dead on Jan 12.Police initially arrested her husband, Panya, before the CCTV footage obtained by a Channel 8 TV team helped unmask the real murderers. Confronted with the evidence, the teenagers eventually admitted to assaulting and killing the 48-year-old before dumping her body in a pond.The public initially focused on the police's mishandling of the case, especially the torturing of Buaphan's husband to force him to confess to a crime he had not committed, as well as loopholes in criminal juvenile law.However, little attention was paid to the vulnerability of homeless people like this all over the country, not to mention those who are also suffering from mental problems. Yet, this is a social time bomb that has been off the radar for far too long.On any given day, members of the public may encounter at least one homeless or mentally unbalanced person without having any idea how to help or what to do with them.The network of non-governmental organisations working with homeless people correctly pointed out there is a stigma that dehumanises homeless and mentally unstable people, meaning they could be subject to various kinds of violence, from verbal abuse to physical assaults by gangsters or individuals, as in the case of Buaphan.This stigma makes many people indifferent to their plight rather than lending a hand. And it's safe to say there are probably many cases of violence against these groups that go unreported.Data released last year by the Social Development and Human Security Ministry shows that Bangkok has the largest number of homeless, or 1,271, followed by Chon Buri (126), Chiang Mai (118), Khon Kaen (73), and Kanchanaburi (62). Of course, the real number must be higher.Yet, the ministry has no active plan to tackle the problem, such as finding them shelter or securing welfare or rehabilitation for them. More seems to be getting done by NGOs like the Mirror Foundation and a network comprising various groups under the banner \"Friends of the Homeless\".The Mirror Foundation, in particular, has gained recognition for its initiative connecting some vagrants, who may need re-skilling, to job markets, as well as its \"People on the Street\" programme, which helps secure assistance for those living on the pavement or at bus stops.It's among the first agencies to raise public awareness about the need to help homeless people with mental problems.As an NGO, the foundation depends on public donations for its operations, which may be one of its biggest constraints.The ministry, with all the resources at its disposal, should review its work so as to fill the gap regarding the assistance given to this vulnerable group.At least, it should help support the work of volunteers like those at the Mirror Foundation and others, if not form an alliance with them and other state agencies.Moreover, it's important that all assistance must be given on one condition: No strings attached.",

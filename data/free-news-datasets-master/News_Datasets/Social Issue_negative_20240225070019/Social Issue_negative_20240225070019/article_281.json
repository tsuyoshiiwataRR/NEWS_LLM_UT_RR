    "text": "[Taylor Swift](https://thenerdstash.com/tag/taylor-swift/) fans are outraged this week as an alarming amount of AI generated photos featuring the singer have appeared online. The deepfake photos are graphic in nature and have been created without Swift’s consent. Of course, [privacy concerns](https://thenerdstash.com/taylor-swift-makes-it-clear-that-shes-not-ready-for-a-baby-with-travis-kelce/) have been voiced by many. Among those who are enraged by the photos include Swift’s large army of fans, also known as Swifties. The group has taken to social media to speak out about the situation. The photos have garnered so much attention that the phrase “Protect Taylor Swift” began trending on the X app, formerly known as Twitter. “Those Taylor AI pics are straight up sexual harassment and it’s disgusting,” one person commented. “It doesn’t matter how famous someone is, how much you may dislike her- whatever. She is a human being & deserves respect,” another fan wrote. “The situation with AI images of Taylor Swift is insane. It’s disgusting,” a third social media user stated. “I’m very sad about what’s going on with Taylor Swift. It’s scary and horrible,” another comment read. Taylor Wift Fans Fight To Protect the Singer From AI Images Sadly, AI generated images increased in popularity, especially where celebrities are involved. “I’m very confident in saying that in the long run, it will be impossible to tell the difference between a generated image and a real one. The generated images are just going to keep getting better,” computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, James O’Brien, tells [USA Today.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/01/25/taylor-swift-artificial-intelligence-images/72350439007/) Meanwhile, Taylor Swift has stayed quiet about the AI photos. The singer is currently on hiatus from her Eras Tour. She’s been seen several times attending Kansas City Chiefs games to support [her boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce](https://thenerdstash.com/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-relationship-may-not-be-as-serious-as-fans-think/). For his part, the athlete has also stayed mum on the situation. However, Swifties are coming out in full force in hopes of having the images taken off social media.",

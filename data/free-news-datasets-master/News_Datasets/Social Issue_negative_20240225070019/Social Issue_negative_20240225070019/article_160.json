    "text": "Yeah, I no longer fear November.* We are going to win in a landslide. Look at this shit. ALL of it: https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/1/25/2219448/-Republicans-are-threatening-to-purge-anyone-who-isn-t-MAGA https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/1/25/2219478/-McConnell-considers-killing-major-immigration-deal-to-help-Trump https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/1/25/2219511/-The-RNC-says-F-you-democracy-We-pick-Trump The first link is the actual reason Trump just lost the election. McConnell caving to him is the other. If McConnell were the wily political genius he is often billed as, he would fight this. Because he's capitulating instead, Trump is done. Let me summarize what has happened in the past two days since Trump's poor showing in New Hampshire and Nikki Haley doing better than expected. Trump put out a statement that anyone who sends Haley money or votes for her from this point forward is out of the MAGA movement. And that the Republican Party is now MAGA. Let me tell you what the Republican Party actually is. The Republican Party is the party of \"You can't tell me what to do.\" Politicians are supposed to answer to their voters, not the other way around. Voters don't like being threatened. Republicans in particular detest it. Trump was VERY careful in 2016 and 2020 NOT to do this which is why so many skeptics held their nose and voted for him anyways. They see that quote? They're gone. Half, (maybe more) will vote for Biden out of pure spite. \"You can't tell me what to do!\" Biden, being as smart at politics as he is, is gonna jump on this and try to coax these people over to him. It won't be hard. Our job in November has ceased being merely winning against Trump. It's beating him and the other Republicans so badly we crush MAGA into the ground. Winning back Congress in a landslide and expanding our Senate majority. The latter sounds impossible on paper. Our Senate map is brutal. Until this. I predict we keep ALL our seats but West Virginia and possibly gain Florida, Texas, and Missouri. And if I were Joe Manchin, I would rethink retiring. As unpopular as he currently is in his state, he could actually win in this climate even if Trump carries West Virginia. Everything was already aligning for us. Dobbs, January 6, the criminal trials. People feeling better about the economy, and Trump's dementia finally being highlighted. The thing is even with all that, the election still would have been close. Because Trump just threatened voters and told people who refuse to be told what to do, what to do, we are looking at a landslide. If more things like this keep happening, (and they might) we could be looking at a permanent political realignment. God what an unforced error by Trump. On-brand for that idiot but for once I'm not complaining. UPDATE: People have been asking me what I’ve been smoking. It’s called hopium. It’s the good shit. UPDATE 2: Let’s get something straight. This is my prediction. I could be wrong. People making political predictions have a knack for getting things wrong. Some people below are saying predicting a good outcome is counterproductive. I don’t agree. And I wonder why some people find it upsetting. I think we will crush them because I believe in you guys. I don’t think there is anything wrong with that. UPDATE 3 Confidence and complacency are not the same things. I have the former and am rejecting the latter. FINAL UPDATE *I do want to address people who are NOT confident and see November through the lens of pure terror. I’m with you. I AM scared to death deep down. There has been a knot in my stomach ever since election night 2016, and though it’s lessened with Biden in office, it’s never gone away. It’s flaring up pretty heavily right now and I AM scared and take the threat deadly seriously. Here’s the thing. I’m not the only person with that knot. Neither are you. What this country went through was a trauma and the idea of going back to that fills most people with pure dread. But the knot? That isn’t going away. And the knot is why we’ll win. The knot is why nobody on our side will be dumb enough to throw away their vote on a third party candidate and why the Biden Republicans and young folks will come home. That knot is out greatest strength and weapon and we should NEVER ignore it. We should listen to it. It’s telling us HOW to win. We must take its advice. We’ll win because it matters to us, literally life and death. The other side does not actually have the stakes we do. They just wanna PWN the libtards. We want to save America and our entire way of life. That’s why we’ll win and they’ll lose.

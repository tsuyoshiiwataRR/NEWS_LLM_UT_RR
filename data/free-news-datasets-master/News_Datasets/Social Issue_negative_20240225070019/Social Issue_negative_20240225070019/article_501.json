    "text": "Caves equipped with tables, chairs and even beds — that's what officials in Modesto say the homeless along the Tuolumne River were living in, up until a clean-up last weekend.\nPolice tape and barricades went up Wednesday along the river near Crater Avenue and Dallas Street in Modesto, meant to keep the homeless out.\n“They’re building some interesting caves,\" said Brian Brandenburg, who lives in the neighborhood and walks his dog along the river every day.\nBrandenburg always knew the homeless sought shelter in the area but didn’t know to what extent, until volunteers and officers with Modesto Police’s Community Health and Assistance Team cleaned up the area on Saturday.\n“Honestly, I just started laughing and said how creative they were,\" said Brandenburg of the caves.\nThe weekend clean-up exposed eight caves dug into the river bed, as wide as 10 feet, according to volunteers. While some neighbors had safety concerns learning about the caves inches away from the waters of the Tuolumne River, others asked where else the homeless would go.\n“I know it’s dangerous, but they’re also out in the elements,\" said Brandenburg. \"What’s (more) dangerous? Freezing or starving, or living in a cave that I’m sure they know how they built and they know how sturdy it’s going to be?\"...\nIn a Facebook post, Modesto police said that officials offered resources to transition the homeless from the caves into shelter or housing over the weekend.\nHowever, for some neighbors like Brandenburg, the caves aren't a problem.\n\"Let them have their peace, they’re out of everybody’s way,\" said Brandenburg. “I mean, it’s getting them out of the weather, it’s not hindering anybody and I thought it was a good idea they did it.”",

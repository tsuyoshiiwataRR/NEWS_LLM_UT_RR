    "title": "\"Temple razed down in 17th century\": Advocate Vishnu Jain on ASI survey of Gyanvapi mosque",
    "text": "The ASI survey was ordered by the district court after the Hindu petitioners claimed the 17th-century mosque was constructed over a pre-existing temple. Talking to ANI on Thursday, Jain said, \"ASI has done a lot of detailed scientific study in its report. According to the report, an inscription was found in the so-called mosque. The pillars that are found are from a Hindu temple. The ASI said that the western wall is that of a Hindu temple. Scriptures in different languages are found.\" Giving more details, Jain said the ASI has said there was a \"pre-existing large Hindu temple\" in place of the current structure. \"The ASI has said that terms such as Maha Mukti Mandap are mentioned in these inscriptions, which are of great significance. ASI has concluded that a temple was razed down in the 17th century, and there was a pre-existing large Hindu temple in the place of the current structure. We will move to the Supreme Court and demand that the Vazu Tank area be opened,\" the advocate said. Earlier in the day, Vishnu Shankar Jain said the ASI had said that \"parts of pre-existing temples\" were reused with little modifications. \"Parts of pre-existing temples, including pillars and plasters, were reused with little modifications. A minute study of pillars and plasters in corridors suggests that they were originally part of a pre-existing Hindu temple for their reuse in the existing structure, Vyala figures carved on either side of the lotus medallion were mutilated and after removing the stone mass from the corners, that space was decorated with floral design. This observation is supported by two similar plasters still existing on the north and southern walls of the western chamber in their original place,\" he said. The area of 'wazukhana' was sealed in 2022 following a Supreme Court order after the discovery of what was said to be a 'Shivling'. The structure, which was claimed to be a 'Shivling' by the Hindu side and a 'fountain' by the Muslim side, was found in the mosque premises on May 16, 2022, during a court-mandated survey of the building located next to the Kashi Vishwanath temple. The 'Wazu' area is at the centre of the Gyanvapi mosque-Kashi Vishwanath temple dispute in the case, with both sides staking claim to the structure discovered during the court-mandated survey. The ASI had submitted its survey report to the district court in a sealed envelope last month. (ANI)",

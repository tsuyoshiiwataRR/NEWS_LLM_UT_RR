    "text": "She’s not going to listen to this. Conway isn’t in the same party as Haley. This might as well be Yang, Manchin, or Biden giving her advice on how to run her campaign. Even if it is good advice.\nThe one consistent theme in all the “Not Trump” GOP candidates is that all of them are pretending they’re in some old normal world of campaigning. Where it’s a spirited contest between people who basically have the same policy goals but slightly different nuanced takes on which is more important or exactly how to achieve them. In that frame, they all think if/when they lose they can be a part of the administration the winner creates.\nThis is where all the concession and endorsements come from, looking to find their place in the eventual administration if their party wins even though it will not be them.\nExcept none of that is true for Trump. All of them mean nothing to Trump and no amount of groveling is going to repair that. His voters would never accept any of them. To those voters, Haley is in a different party. Clearly if she was in the real GOP she would just support Trump and be done.\nThe fantasy that there is one GOP is just a myth now. It’s the same reason the GOP House majority cannot do anything. It’s not really a majority, it’s a coalition of two minorities to create a majority and they don’t agree on much beyond the letters GOP.",

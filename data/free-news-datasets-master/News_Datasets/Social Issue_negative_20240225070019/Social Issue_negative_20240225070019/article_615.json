A man who died after being hit by a tractor trailer in South Portland on Thursday morning was trying to end his life, according to South Portland police. The crash was reported at 8:01 a.m. near the Budget Inn at 634 Main St. A witness told police that a tractor-trailer truck had struck the pedestrian. The 60-year-old man was found to have significant injuries. He was brought to a hospital where he later died, police said. Investigators learned that the man had recently rented a room at the Budget Inn. After conducting interviews, reviewing video footage, reviewing the man’s personal history, and finding a note left in his room, they determined the man had intentionally stepped into the path of the truck. The man’s name is being withheld until his family is notified. Police said they found the tractor-trailer driver, who cooperated with investigators. They determined the driver had done nothing wrong and said no charges will be filed. Main Street [was temporarily closed](https://www.bangordailynews.com/2024/01/25/portland/portland-police-courts/south-portland-main-street-crash/) during the investigation on Thursday.",

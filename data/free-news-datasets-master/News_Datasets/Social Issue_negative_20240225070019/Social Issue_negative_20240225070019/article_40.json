Driven to cut costs by sagging ad revenues and waning appetite for propaganda, layoffs and 'restructurings' are happening all over.\nEarlier this week the LA Times laid off 120 employees, around 20% of its newsroom.\nMeanwhile, BuzzFeed and Vice Media - two former darlings of digital media, are looking to siphon off assets. BuzzFeed, which has lost over 97% of its value since going public in 2021, is looking to sell its food sites, Tasty and WeFeast. While Fortress Investment Group, which took over Vice in bankruptcy last year, is looking to sell its Refinery29 women's lifestyle site, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n[\nlink to www.zerohedge.com (secure)\n]\nAnonymous Coward\nUser ID: 85973441\nUnited States\n01/25/2024 04:52 PM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: 'The Entire Journalism Industry Is In Freefall': Taylor Lorenz Vlogs The Death Of MSM As BuzzFeed, Insider And Vice Jettison Assets\nAnonymous Coward\nUser ID: 86771072\nUnited Kingdom\n01/25/2024 04:56 PM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: 'The Entire Journalism Industry Is In Freefall': Taylor Lorenz Vlogs The Death Of MSM As BuzzFeed, Insider And Vice Jettison Assets\nPage\n1\nTop\nPrevious Page\nNext Page\nBack to Forum\nPost New Thread\nReply\nView Favorites\nDisclaimer / Copyright Info\n-\nPrivacy Policy\n-\nTerms Of Use\n-\nCancellation Policy / Billing Help\nMail\nWebmaster\nwith questions or comments about this site.\nCopyright Â© 1999 - 2023 Godlikeproductions.com\nPage generated in 0.024s (7 queries)",

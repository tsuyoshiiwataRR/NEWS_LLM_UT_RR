    "text": "Paramount+ has canceled its “Teen Wolf” offshoot “Wolf Pack” after a single season which finished its eight-episode run in March last year.\nThe streamer was originally keen on doing a second season, but strike-caused delays meant that season wouldn’t be ready until 2025 – something the streamer didn’t want as they’d have to spend a bunch on marketing for it.\nThe Jeff Davis-created series starred former “Buffy” alum Sarah Michelle Gellar and was based on the series of novels by Edo Van Belkom.\nIt followed two teenagers (Armani Jackson and Bella Shepard) whose lives are changed when a wildfire awakens a terrifying supernatural creature. Paramount+ launched the series alongside “Teen Wolf: The Movie”.\nGellar told THR back in March that planning for a second season was underway even though they didn’t have the official renewal order. She added “our numbers have been great and people are still really finding the show”.\nParamount+ has also yet to make renewal decisions on a number of series including the “Frasier” revival and Taylor Sheridan’s “Lawmen” and “Special Ops” series.\nSource:\nThe Hollywood Reporter",

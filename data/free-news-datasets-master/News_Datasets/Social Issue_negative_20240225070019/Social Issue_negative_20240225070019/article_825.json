    "text": "Reuters Western Digital Corp posts wider Q2 loss, sees impact of structural changes Read full article Reuters January 26, 2024 at 12:33 a.m. Â· 1 min read Jan 25 (Reuters) - Data storage products maker Western Digital Corp posted a wider-than-expected quarterly adjusted loss on Thursday, due to the impact of structural changes the company implemented in its flash and HDD businesses.\nShares of the company were down about 4% in after-market trading.\nLast quarter, the company said it would spin off its flash memory business, which has been grappling with a supply glut after talks of merging the unit with Japan's Kioxia stalled, by the second half of 2024.\nThe company said its second-quarter loss included $156 million of underutilization-related charges in Flash and HDD.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company reported a loss of 69 cents per share, missing analysts' average estimate of a loss of $1.31 per share, according to LSEG data.\nWestern Digital expects current-quarter adjusted profit ranging from a loss of $0.10 to a profit of $0.20 per share.\nThe company reported revenue of $3.03 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 29. Analysts had expected revenue of $3.39 billion.\n(Reporting by Tanya Jain in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)\nTRENDING 1.

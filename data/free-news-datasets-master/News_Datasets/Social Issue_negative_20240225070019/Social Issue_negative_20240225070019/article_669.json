    "text": "The Biden administration is refusing to release illegal immigration numbers for December 2023, which are expected to blow through previous monthly records. Today is January 25th and the federal government still has not released the official December border numbers to the public.— Bill Melugin (@BillMelugin_) Again - they will show December had the highest number of illegal crossings ever recorded, and the numbers have been known internally for weeks now. [January 25, 2024] The December border numbers, which will be the highest ever recorded, still have not officially been released by the Biden administration, despite those numbers being known internally for weeks (300,000+ encounters) & already leaked to numerous media outlets.— Bill Melugin (@BillMelugin_) It’s January 23rd. [January 23, 2024] The Biden White House is setting our country up for another 9/11 if they’re letting illegal aliens on airplanes with what is essentially a government-issued fake ID.— Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) If Americans have to present proper identification to board a flight—illegal aliens should too. [pic.twitter.com/uPRnPj749y] [January 25, 2024] Recommended Meanwhile, President Joe Biden is in Wisconsin today as a standoff between the state of Texas and the federal government is ongoing. Greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War and Biden’s going to Wisconsin to give a speech about a bridge.— John Daniel Davidson (@johnddavidson) [https://t.co/MsF1JgWLjt] [January 25, 2024] On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Mike Johnson is backing Texas and reiterating a promise to impeach Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. I stand with Governor Abbott. The House will do everything in its power to back him up.— Speaker Mike Johnson (@SpeakerJohnson) The next step: holding Secretary Mayorkas accountable.

It is always the same departments.\nI immediately believe all accusations against them since in my experience, the truth is even worse.\nPosted by: Confused in Blighty at January 25, 2024 04:31 PM (lpvLE)\nPosted by: garrett\nI rate this True.\nPosted by: sharon(willow's apprentice)\nMaybe not yet, but they've been so raped, abused and traumatized, there's no way Hamas will want to hand them over...so most of them WILL be dead.\nPosted by: Moron Analyst at January 25, 2024 04:31 PM (JCZqz)\nPosted by:\n---\nThat was on opposite from Days of Our Lives, right?\nPosted by: Axeman at January 25, 2024\n***\nYeah, and its spinoff, Lurch For Tomorrow\nPosted by: Wolfus Aurelius, Dreaming of Elsewhere at January 25, 2024 04:32 PM (J2vNu)\nPosted by: TheJamesMadison\nIt was so long ago that I don't remember the specific arguments.\nHenry VIII is kind of an historical enigma, though, so who knows?\nPosted by: Bulgaroctonus at January 25, 2024 04:32 PM (9yWhg)\nThis whole thing is just one more wart on the ass of government.\nHonor?

Near the top of the results, I saw an article claiming that fake news spreads faster on Twitter than real news does.\nI remember some other article bemoaning how more people believe lies than the truth. I observe once again that they use an example about an untruth being spread on the right, and it's always some thing that I have literally never heard of. But I am assured that all those ignorant right-wingers believe whatever silly thing it is. If these things are so widespread on the right, why have I never heard a single one of these false reports?\nPosted by: Emmie at January 25, 2024 04:36 PM (Sf2cq)\nTwo state solution!\n----",

    "text": "Two decades ago, the Surgeon General issued a report highlighting concerning disparities in mental healthcare among racial and ethnic minority populations. The present study characterised national trends in mental health treatment utilisation by race and ethnicity across a 13-year period.\nNationally representative data were drawn from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2008 through 2020 (unweighted n=4 41 993). Trends in mental health treatment utilisation and perceived unmet treatment need among individuals with and without psychiatric illness were stratified by race and ethnicity.\nLogistic regression analyses revealed most racial/ethnic minority groups were less likely to receive treatment than white individuals, regardless of mental health status. Treatment utilisation increased among those with (annual per cent change (APC)=0.83, 95% CI=0.41 to 1.26) and without psychiatric illness (APC=1.39, 95% CI=0.53 to 2.26). Among individuals with psychiatric illness, treatment use increased among white (APC=0.88, 95% CI=0.51 to 1.24), Hispanic (APC=2.12, 95% CI=0.70 to 3.57) and black adults (APC=1.07, 95% CI=0.11 to 2.04). White (APC=1.88, 95% CI=0.86 to 2.91) and Hispanic (APC=2.45, 95% CI=0.02 to 4.93) individuals without psychiatric illness also saw increased treatment use. Although increases in perceived unmet treatment need were observed for all racial and ethnic groups except blacks and Native Americans with psychiatric illness, rates remained low across all groups.\nAlthough national rates of mental health treatment utilisation have risen, this was almost entirely observed among white and Hispanic individuals with and without psychiatric illness, highlighting the limited progress made towards eliminating disparities in care.",

    "text": "I think this was previously reported but I had a \"Ken\" sighting today and wanted to share.\nKen was a beloved server at Trails End for decades (primarily but had other roles there) and was working at the closing of Trails End. He was always very kind, gentle, helpful, and hard working. He loved to talk and was frequently mentioned on the DIS Camping Board for these traits.\nWell, today DW and I found Ken working still at Disney. We had lunch over at Yacht Club at the Ale & Compass Restaurant and Ken was working there as a front host. He was flattered that we remembered him (he'd served us maybe 3-4 times at TE but even when he didn't, we saw him working on the tables of other guests.\nI asked if I could take his picture and he agreed and said that he felt something like a celebrity to which I replied \"You are to us\".\nHe said he misses the people at Trails End (workers and guests) but said he is treated very well over at Ale & Compass. I chuckled when he said that his daughter encouraged him to move away from serving to hosting because it was less stressful so that's what he did and enjoys it.\nSo if you get a chance, check at Ale & Compass Restaurant to see if Ken is working the host stand.\nHe is one of the good guys.\nBama Ed",

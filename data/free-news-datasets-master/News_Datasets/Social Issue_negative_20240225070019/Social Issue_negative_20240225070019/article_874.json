    "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C., USA â€” Sen. Susan Collins [said Thursday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF5ICmhqOgM) she will not endorse former President Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, even if he wins the Republican nomination. Collins, a Republican, made the comments while speaking in front of a group of reporters in Washington. She said she didn't choose an alternative candidate to endorse earlier because she's friends with multiple people who were running against Trump. The senator has not formally endorsed former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, the only other GOP candidate left in the race, but she did say she's glad Haley is still in it. Collins has been representing Maine in the U.S. Senate since 1997. In February 2021, she was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Trump of \"incitement of insurrection\" in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. In 2016, Collins [said she would not endorse Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/08/08/sen-susan-collins-says-she-will-not-vote-for-trump-joining-growing-list-of-republicans/). In 2020, when she was up for reelection, Collins [would not say](/article/news/politics/im-concentrating-on-my-own-race-collins-dodges-question-about-supporting-trump/97-c3af1b30-7717-458a-9a0b-fdf278171b02) whether she endorsed Trump.

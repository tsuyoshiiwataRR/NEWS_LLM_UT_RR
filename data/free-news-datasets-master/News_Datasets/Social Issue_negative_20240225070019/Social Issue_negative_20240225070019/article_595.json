    "text": "We are having an issue related to starting a few in house developed .NET applications on Windows 10 Version 1607 machines. Sometimes starting an application doesn't succeed. This is because loading a dependent .NET assembly fails. The error message is:\nSystem.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly '[assemblyname], Version=[version], Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=[publickeytoken]' or one of its dependencies. The data area passed to a system call is too small. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007007A)\nThe issue happens about 10% of the application startups in different .NET applications. It happens with 32-bit as well as 64-bit applications. During all the startups also many other applications start that start up OK. I wonder why we get the\n0x8007007a error? Maybe it is collateral due to a heap corruption that happened before?\nYou can see related logging from FUSLOGVW below. The filepaths and assembly names are anonymised. The assembly that is attempted to be loaded has quite a long name (59 characters without the .dll postfix). As a test, we changed the name of the assembly to a shorter name. Unfortunately the issue remained. Adding a probing path in the exe.config also did not fix the issue.\nFurthermore, there seems to be code of an older version of the Microsoft Assembly Resolver available at Github:\nhttps://github.com/fixdpt/shared-source-cli-2.0. I suspect there is something wrong in the ConstructCodeBaseList in adlmgr.cpp. But I can't figure out what triggers the issue.\n*** Assembly Binder Log Entry (2020/01/30 @ 13:48) *** The operation failed.

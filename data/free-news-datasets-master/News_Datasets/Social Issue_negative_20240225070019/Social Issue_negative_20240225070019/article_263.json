    "text": "Some takeaways. What’s happening in American ivy league schools is critical - not just to Americans but to the entire world. These institutions, some founded in the 1600s and built upon Judeo-Christian values, are no longer American in anything other than in name. They’re Globalist outposts. In some universities, 25% of the student body is foreign born, and an anti-American agenda is pervasive because vast sums of foreign money, specifically from China and Arab countries, influence and taint the agenda. Graduates go on to make some highly toxic decisions rooted in the ideology absorbed in school. Ecocide wasn’t casually mentioned at Davos. Airtime means a plan is in place. The panel wasn’t workshopping the “new concept” - they were letting us know it’s in the works. Should ecocide become the next zeitgeist, how will Americans, and the world by extension, fare? The layup is the Committee to Unleash Prosperity survey. [89%](https://committeetounleashprosperity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Them-vs-Us_CTUP-Rasmussen-Study-FINAL.pdf)of Ivy League graduates “favor the strict rationing of gas, meat, and electricity.” Why? Were 89% of Ivy League students raised in vegan households reliant on harnessing the wind and rubbing two sticks together to cook a meal, heat the house, or get to school? They were programmed while away from their parents. As of 2022, family farms made up [97%](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/farming-and-farm-income/)of U.S. farms. Small family farms (those earning less than $350,000 in gross cash farm income) accounted for 88%. Large family farms (over $1 million in gross cash farm income) accounted for about 3% but over 50% of the amount of production. There are around 2 million farms in America. Around 25% of their products are exported annually. Cattle and calves are in the top three U.S. farm products. Agriculture and food contributed approximately [$1.264 trillion](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/ag-and-food-sectors-and-the-economy/#:~:text=What%20is%20agriculture's%20share%20of,%2C%20a%205.4%2Dpercent%20share.)to U.S. GDP in 2021. Going against meat is going against farms and going against farms is going against America’s capitalist principles. Since the majority of elites and Ivy League graduates polled for the survey are against these ways of life, they’re useful in two ways to the Left. They’re on-hand foot-soldiers and they are also incubators of terrible ideas, always trying to fix something that isn’t broken. Jojo Mehta, ûber-elite graduate of Oxford and London universities, is the co-founder and spokesperson of Stop Ecocide International. Since 2017, she’s been hot on the trail to punish people for earning a living, and to infringe upon their human rights. Mehta’s website profile says, “The core work to make ecocide an [international crime](https://www.stopecocide.earth/jojo-mehta-profile)at the International Criminal Court, is supported and progressed by a large network of over 45 teams and associate groups globally. There are over 50 thousand endorsing signatories across civil society and faith groups, and a growing number of endorsing businesses and organizations.” How Mehta traveled to Davos wasn’t disclosed during her panel discussion. It should have been considering the scale of starvation, imprisonment, destitution, and death that will come if her concept materializes. Her footprint should be closely examined. “What our organization and other collaborators intend to do is to have this [recognized legally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDmaYQh7r6Y)as a serious crime… If you’re campaigning for human rights…you know, mass murder, torture, these things are serious crimes. But there’s no equivalent in the environmental space,” says Mehta. These wackos are implying that growing a tomato is the equivalent to mass murder. Catching salmon is the equivalent to torture. Raising cattle must be the equivalent of rape and sodomy. Mehta soared to new heights of entitlement, reworking the American legal framework without batting an eye. For example, it’s not just the farmers and fishers that will be sent to the Gulag; it’s everyone. Why? Mehta explains; “unlike…genocide, [which] involves a specific intent, with ecocide, what we see is what people are [trying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDmaYQh7r6Y)to do.” In other words, thinking about a hamburger will result in prison if she has her way. Here’s the good news. The Committee to Unleash Prosperity survey shows a healthy disconnect between the elites, Ivy grads, and everyone else. While only 21% of elites think “there’s too little freedom”, the majority of Americans think there isn’t enough. Here’s the scary news: a subset of the elites and Ivy graduates, 69% of this political activist segment, believe there is too much individual freedom. Moreover, they’re the ones working with governments, NGOs, foreign bad actors, and big money donors. Mehta’s “new concept” ecocide can become a reality because the same benefactors propping up WEF control Big Education. Or, as we really should call it, given these poll results, Big Indoctrination.",

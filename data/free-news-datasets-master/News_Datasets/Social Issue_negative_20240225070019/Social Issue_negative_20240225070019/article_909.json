    "text": "American taxpayers are funding the globalist totalitarians at the World Economic Forum who want everyone to eat bugs and stop drinking coffee to stop imaginary “climate change.” Since 2011, the WEF has cost taxpayers at least $60 million released in grants from the federal government. But GOP Representative Scott Perry of Pennsylvania plans to turn off the spigot with a bill to prohibit funding the anti-American, anti-Christian globalist subversives. The Grants Pay for Bug-eating Propaganda The WEF is funded mainly through globe-straddling corporations such as Coca-Cola, Chevron, and Sony, and “nonprofits” such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which also funds the mass murder of the unborn [through International Planned Parenthood](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/1999/10/international-planned-parenthood-federation991013). Run by Klaus Schwab, who resembles a villain from a James Bond movie, the WEF also has its mitts on the federal Treasury. On September 21, 2015, the WEF began receiving payments [from a $50.2 million grant](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_AIDEGEEIO1500004_7200) from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The grant for “trade facilitation” runs through September 30, 2025. In 2023, [taxpayers wasted $9.1 million](https://www.usaspending.gov/recipient/6536235e-77eb-122c-173c-085e2d528ef5-C/latest), distributed through USAID and the State Department, on a “child” agency of the WEF. The money went for “minority-owned businesses.” Perry would cut off that welfare for the bazillionaire globalists. “No funds available to the Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development, or any other department or agency may be used to provide funding for the World Economic Forum,” the [one-sentence bill](https://perry.house.gov/uploadedfiles/defund_davos_act.pdf) says. “Forcing American Taxpayers to fund annual ski trips for insular, global elitists is absurd — not to mention reprehensible,” [Perry said](https://perry.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402586#:~:text=The%20bill%20would%20prohibit%20the,%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Rep.%20Perry.). “The World Economic Forum doesn’t deserve one cent of American funding, and it’s past time we defund Davos.” Said the news release from Perry’s office: The Davos conference allows the global elites and leaders of countries like China and Iran to argue against the interests of the American People and devise means by which global governance can be implemented. The Forum’s objectives include designing and implementing a global financial system, getting countries to enforce electric vehicle purchases and car sharing, using Artificial Intelligence to drive the economy and society, and other global public interests. A few days after he introduced the bill, Perry delivered the verdict on Davos: Davos is a platform for the global elites and communist government leaders to argue against the interests of the American People — devising means by which global governance can be implemented. Eat Bugs, No Coffee, No Property As the news release [also observed](https://perry.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402586#:~:text=The%20bill%20would%20prohibit%20the,%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Rep.%20Perry.), the globalist elite who recently met in Davos are pushing “dystopian ideals” such as consuming insects, and they’re doing it with American tax money. Last year, the [WEF offered](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/02/how-insects-positively-impact-climate-change/) “5 reasons why eating insects could reduce climate change” as part of the “Davos agenda.” “Edible insects can produce equivalent amounts of quality protein when compared to animals,” the website claimed, and “Insects require less care and upkeep than livestock.” The [WEF also imagines](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/07/why-we-need-to-give-insects-the-role-they-deserve-in-our-food-systems/) a future “food crisis” and claims the consumption of insects must start as the world population grows to 10 billion people by 2050. The world population isn’t growing all that fast and [will likely collapse](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/06/01/global-fertility-has-collapsed-with-profound-economic-consequences), but in any event the WEF wants everyone to know that “Insects are a credible and efficient alternative protein source requiring fewer resources than conventional breeding”: Studies suggest that for the same amount of protein produced, insects, mealworms in particular, require much less land than other sources of animal proteins. A study on crickets suggests they are twice as efficient in converting feed to meat as chicken, at least four times more efficient than pigs and 12 times more efficient than cattle.” Right. Meanwhile, even drinking coffee is off the menu, the Davos globalists say. Big banker [Hubert Keller](https://www.impactinvest.org.uk/who-we-are/our-people/hubert-keller/) warned the WEF worthies at their latest conference that “the coffee that we all drink emits between 15 and 20 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of coffee,” and “every time we drink coffee, we are basically putting CO2 into the atmosphere.” Maybe, but every time this gaggle of globalist geese meets in Davos, they “are basically putting CO2 into the atmosphere” with their private jets and limousines. Aside from jamming bugs down our throats with American tax subsidies, the WEF says “ [you’ll own nothing and be happy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27ll_own_nothing_and_be_happy),” as the summary of a deranged article at its website put it. In 2016, a leftist member of the Danish Parliament, [Ida Auken, wrote](https://web.archive.org/web/20210319013318/https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/how-life-could-change-2030/) about the imaginary utopian city in which she lived in 2030. “Welcome to the year 2030. Welcome to my city — or should I say, ‘our city.’ I don’t own anything. I don’t own a car. I don’t own a house. I don’t own any appliances or any clothes”: It might seem odd to you, but it makes perfect sense for us in this city. Everything you considered a product, has now become a service. We have access to transportation, accommodation, food and all the things we need in our daily lives. One by one all these things became free, so it ended up not making sense for us to own much.… In our city we don’t pay any rent, because someone else is using our free space whenever we do not need it. My living room is used for business meetings when I am not there. While lamenting the loss of her privacy, taxpayer-subsidized [Auken insisted](https://web.archive.org/web/20210319013318/https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/how-life-could-change-2030/) that, “all in all, it is a good life. Much better than the path we were on, where it became so clear that we could not continue with the same model of growth.” Of course, Auken didn’t explain why everything would be “free.” Nor did she explain how everything from food to consumer goods would be produced. She risibly claimed that the fantasy world she envisioned is not “my utopia or dream of the future.” The WEF has apparently [scrubbed the article](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/how-life-could-change-2030/) from its website.

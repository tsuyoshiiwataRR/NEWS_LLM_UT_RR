    "text": "Chelsea could be parting ways with more big names this January as they aim to fix up their books after some big spending.\nRegardless of the talent or the potential, Chelsea have always had a habit of selling their academy players, even if it has come back to bite them in the back.\nAnother one who could depart before the January window slams shut is midfielder\nConor Gallagher. Sources have told HITC Football that London rivals Tottenham aren’t giving up on signing the all-action midfielder, as there doesn’t seem to be any resolution to his contract situation.\nJody Morris stated that he would be ‘extremely sad’ if\nChelsea were to let him go because he has been one of his side’s ‘top three’ performers this season, as he told The Transfer Show on Sky Sports.\nAfter selling Mason Mount in the summer to Manchester United, you just know that anything can happen with Conor Gallagher.\nPlus,\nsources have told HITC Football that striker Armando Broja doesn’t have a long-term future at Stamford Bridge and he is another one who could depart.\nSo, you just feel something is going to give here, with Jody Morris making it clear that the fans will be ‘devastated’ if they see another academy star leave.\nConor Gallagher’s Chelsea future\n“Extremely sad,” said Morris at the possibility of Gallagher leaving. “Chelsea fan as well. His family are all Chelsea fans.\n“I think that would be a huge, huge loss. I am not saying it won’t happen because we have seen people like Mason Mount go out of the door.\n“At the same time, if you were to ask any of the match-going fans this season, they would put Conor Gallagher in the top three performers for Chelsea, along with the likes of Cole Palmer.\n“I think he is only going to get better. I think we have seen pundits talk about Conor Gallagher glowingly. I am sure there isn’t a shortage of offers from clubs who would want him. But I would be hugely disappointed if I saw him leave the club. The fans love him – I think fans will be devastated if they see another homegrown player leave.”\nChelsea should keep Conor Gallager\nUnless it’s absolutely necessary and Chelsea have no choice but to, from a financial standpoint, sell someone like Gallagher, then there is nothing the club can do.\nBut you can just sense the England international being sold, then in 18 months being better than what Chelsea have in their own midfield.\nFrom Fikayo Tomori to Tammy Abraham, there have been and will continue to be many examples of ex-Chelsea stars proving their former club wrong.\nAnd with all this money spent by Chelsea not yet working, then things could still get worse for those at Stamford Bridge.\n- MORE:\nRanked: Top four clubs Victor Osimhen could sign for if he leaves Napoli, Premier League side number one",

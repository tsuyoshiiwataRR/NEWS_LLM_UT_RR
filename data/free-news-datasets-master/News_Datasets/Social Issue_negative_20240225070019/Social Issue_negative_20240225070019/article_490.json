    "text": "The tight end was a sore spot for the Sooners in 2023. Production never met expectations, and the Sooners offense received nothing from the room this past season.\nTight ends coach Joe Jon Finley was elevated to co-offensive coordinator. Because of that, the expectations of him as a recruiter have also elevated.\nHe has a much better assortment of talent to work with in 2024. Four-star tight end Davon Mitchell will be a big boost to the room, but the Sooners have their work cut out to rebuild the position to the caliber of OU standards from the past.\nOne attempt to do that has the Sooners offering one of North Carolina’s best players, if not the best player in the state. Kendre Harrison is a five-star athlete who projects as a tight end for the Sooners. He’s equally capable of playing defensive end at the Power Five level, but most teams see him as a tight end. He’s the number one prospect in North Carolina for the class of 2026, but you’d be hard-pressed to find someone in NC who doesn’t think he’s simply the best player in the state, regardless of class.\nHarrison’s physicality oozes on film. Though he’s not necessarily a fluid route runner, he showcases the ability to be molded into a more refined product.\nEvery major school in the country has offered or shown interest in Harrison, and some have offered him as a basketball player. He could very well be a five-star basketball player when his high school career is over.\nKendre Harrison’s Recruiting Profile Film HUDL\nRatings\nStars Overall Position State ESPN N/A N/A N/A N/A Rivals 4 17 N/A N/A 247Sports 4 4 1 1 247 Composite 5 7 1 1 On3 Recruiting 4 N/A N/A N/A On3 Industry 4 8 1 1\nVitals Hometown Reidsville, North Carolina Projected Position Tight End Height 6-6 Weight 240 lbs\nRecruitment Recruitment Offered on January 23rd, 2024 No visit has been scheduled yet Notable Offers Per 247Sports\nOklahoma Alabama Georgia UNC Penn State NC State Arkansas Colorado Michigan Ohio State Twitter Blessed to receive an offer from the University of Oklahoma #AGTG #BoomerSooner @RivalsFriedman pic.twitter.com/Lg5Pkv6ObL\n— k̷e̷n̷d̷r̷e̷’̷ ̷h̷a̷r̷r̷i̷s̷o̷n̷ (@SupremeDre8) January 23, 2024",

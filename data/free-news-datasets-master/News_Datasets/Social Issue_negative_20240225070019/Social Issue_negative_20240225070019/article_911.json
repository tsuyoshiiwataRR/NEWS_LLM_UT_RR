Senate Bill 14 : Bans gender-affirming medical care for transgender children Senate Bill 17 : Bans public universities from having diversity, equity, and inclusion programs Senate Bill 15 : Restricts transgender athlete participation in college sports Senate Bill 763 : Allows schools to use religious chaplains for counseling purposes Senate Bill 12 : Prohibits \"sexually oriented performances\" on public property that a minor could view. Which the letter says is an attempt to target drag shows House Bill 900 : Allows schools to restrict access to LBGTQ+ books by labeling them as \"sexually explicit\" House Bill 2127 : Resrticts local governments from enacting non-discrimination ordinances. The letter claims these laws are part of a \"systemic discriminatory policy\" against LBGTQ+ Texans in violation of international human rights obligations, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).\n\"If we go back to 2019, we had less than 20 Anti-LGBTQ bills filed in this state.\" Ricardo Martinez, CEO of Equality Texas said, \"We meet every two years, and by 2021, there were 76 Anti-LGBTQ bills that were filed, that's almost four times as many as in 2019.\"",

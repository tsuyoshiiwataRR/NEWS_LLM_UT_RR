This request comes in the aftermath of the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision permitting the removal of razor wire installed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, pending ongoing legal proceedings. ‚ÄúTo our knowledge, Texas has only permitted access to Shelby Park by allowing public entry for a memorial, the media, and the use of the golf course adjacent to Shelby Park, all while continuing to restrict U.S. Border Patrol‚Äôs access to the park. Please clarify the scope of access Texas permits to the public,‚Äù says the letter from DHS general counsel Jonathan Meyer ‚Äì [CMuirhead] In a letter addressed to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on January 23, Jonathan Meyer, the chief lawyer for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), urged the state to provide federal agents access to Shelby Park, a region recently taken over by Texas authorities. Meyer asserted that the DHS aims to investigate allegations made by the state, which they believe to be either inaccurate or necessitating clarification. ‚ÄòTexas is right. Biden‚Äôs failure to secure the border leaves states no choice but to take matters into their own hands. As President, I will end this humanitarian crisis once and for all. I will secure the border and destroy the business model of the drug cartels. A country without borders is not a country at all, said Robert F Kennedy Jr. So as Biden and his Merry Marxists complain about Texas trying to protect the borders of this nation, here‚Äôs Benny Johnson in a fast reminder clip.

The earlier ruling would have prohibited Border Patrol agents from removing razor barriers along the Rio Grande, including the Shelby Park area, designed to deter illegal immigration. This legal victory strengthens the Biden administration‚Äôs position in its ongoing dispute with Texas over efforts to curb illegal border crossings.

He emphasized that the DHS acquired permanent real estate interests in the region in 2008 to support border barrier construction and maintenance. We just got a copy of the letter the Department of Homeland Security sent Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton demanding access to Shelby Park by Friday. The letter says despite Shelby Park being public, the state has not allowed U.S. Border Patrol in. [#KSATnews] [pic.twitter.com/jEnVpKfBNh] ‚Äî KSAT Daniela Ibarra (@KSATDaniela) [January 25, 2024] Texas assumed control of Shelby Park earlier this month, responding to a surge in illegal border crossings. However, the Biden administration criticized Texas in the wake of a tragic incident where a mother and two children drowned in the Rio Grande. The administration claimed that Texas officials physically barred the victims from entering the area, an accusation vehemently denied by state authorities. It was later proven with video that the Biden Administration lied about it all, as usual. In a statement, the Texas Military Department contested the Biden administration‚Äôs narrative, revealing that Border Patrol agents sought access to the area after the drownings, while Mexican authorities were already recovering the bodies. Texas Attorney General Paxton labeled the administration‚Äôs claims as ‚Äúvile‚Äù and ‚Äúcompletely inaccurate.‚Äù But what do we expect from Biden and his handlers, who have lied about everything from day one. Since he was installed into the White House, like a cheap toilet by the Deep State, using scam votes at 3am in multiple states, he has moved to disable the nation and topple the U.S. dollar, as well as support and create wars all over the planet. He has gone so far as to support Hamas terrorists with over 100 million US dollars after they slaughtered Jews a few months ago, starting the current Gaza War. He has even recently given over 600 million dollars to the Palestinian Authority, so they can pay their Martyr families. Such families have the photos of their killer children lining the streets in Judea, or West Bank. These animals receive a pension from the PA for killing Jews, and their families receive the payouts forever, now paid by the U.S. Taxpayer. Then of course, as a result of these animals attacking Israel, we then gave Israel billions more of our tax dollars, so they can shoot down the rockets and fight off Hamas, that we are also supporting. This is the insane world of Democrats. The current variety is the most deceptive and war like Marxist Party in power in all American history. The DHS has sent Texas a letter demanding that Border Patrol be given access to Shelby Park, an area at the center of a tense border dispute between Biden and the Lone Star State.

The state has even initiated the arrest of illegal immigrants in the area for criminal trespassing. Sure, the Supreme Court says Biden can cut the razor wire and help the invasion and destruction of the U.S. But that doesn‚Äôt mean Texas can‚Äôt keep putting it up as a response. Nothing in the world. We all await the photoshoots and media covering Biden ordering the cutting of the razor wire. It will make headlines all the way to the election. On social media, Lt. Chris Olivarez of the Texas Department of Public Safety announced arrests of single adult men and women at Shelby Park. The Texas Military Department affirmed its commitment to holding the line in Shelby Park to prevent unlawful entry into the state, emphasizing their dedication to securing the border, upholding the rule of law, and protecting the state‚Äôs sovereignty.

Accusing the federal government, particularly President Biden, of neglecting constitutional duties related to immigration enforcement, Abbott declared an ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù under Article I, ¬ß 10, Clause 3. He asserted Texas‚Äôs constitutional authority to defend itself, activating the Texas National Guard, the Texas Department of Public Safety, and other personnel to secure the border based on state law.

The Biden Administration has shown that it merely wants more funds so they can increase the numbers of illegals coming in. This is all to bankrupt the United States within the next couple of years, or surely to hamper a Trump Administration that will definitely be taking power next January, assuming we have a free and fair election, unlike 2020. Biden and his handlers shaping policy are at odds with the vast number of Americans who are now seeing through it all. No amount of media control can change the growing consensus that our POTUS and his ilk are doing all they can to hurt this nation in nearly every way.

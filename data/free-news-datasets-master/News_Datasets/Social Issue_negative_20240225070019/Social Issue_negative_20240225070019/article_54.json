Scott Perry (R-PA), introduced a bill on Friday to ban American federal government agencies from giving grants or other taxpayer money to the World Economic Forum (WEF). \"Americans need to know that the WEF wants them to only drive an electric vehicle, sell their cars and use car sharing instead, eat bugs to help solve world hunger, and to always operate based on what's good for the 'global public' even when it comes at a detriment to their own lives,\" Rep. Perry's office told Breitbart News this weekend.The Davoisie are getting backlash for scheming to\nA video featuring elites at the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, discussing how coffee production contributes to climate change infuriated social media users after going viral. X users besieged the comment section of a video featuring Swiss banker Hubert Keller telling a WEF panel last week how much CO2 coffee production puts into the atmosphere, warning that \"they're coming for your coffee.\" In the clip -- which was shared to X on Monday and has since racked up over three million views and many comments -- Keller noted just how many \"tonnes\" (metric unit equivalent to 2,204 lbs) of CO2 coffee makers put into the atmosphere globally when producing their product. He said, \"Basically, the coffee that we all drink emits between 15 and 20 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of coffee. So we should all know that this is -- every time we drink coffee, we are basically putting CO2 into the atmosphere.\" Keller added, \"Most of the coffee plantation -- most of the coffee's produced through monoculture, and monoculture is also affected by climate change. The quality of these nature assets is deteriorating quite rapidly.\" Elsewhere, the WEF contributor told his fellow panelists about how there is an opportunity to re-organize the coffee industry, which he noted is a \"$250 billion market globally\" to make it more eco-friendly and to address the fact that \"most of coffee growers live below the poverty line.\" Tech journalist Tim Hinchliffe, who originally posted the clip to the platform, interpreted Keller's points to mean that coffee growers are going to be stripped of their livelihoods by massive corporations. He posted, \"They're going after coffee farmers. When he says production is 'fragmented,' he's saying it has yet to be captured by corporations & centralized. The coffee farmers in the globalist-termed 'global south' are to be stripped of their livelihoods in the name of climate justice.\" Hinchliffe added, \"He's putting a guilt-trip on coffee drinkers for supporting poor coffee farmers because they don't know any better in their 'monoculture' endeavors. It's all a power grab to seize land and the means of production to carbon tax you and I to oblivion.\"\nPosted by: Disinformation Expert Ace at\nComments\nPosted by: Sponge - F*ck Joe Biden at January 25, 2024 12:19 PM (Zz0t1)\nPosted by: Duke Lowell at January 25, 2024 12:20 PM (u73oe)\nAdios to Davos!\nPosted by:\nDefund Davos.\nDefund WEF.\nDefund UN.\nDefund NATO.\nThen we'll be friends.\nPosted by: Sponge - F*ck Joe Biden at January 25, 2024 12:20 PM (Zz0t1)\nDefund Davos.\nDefund WEF.\nDefund UN.\nDefund NATO.\nThen we'll be friends.\nPosted by: Sponge - F*ck Joe Biden at January 25, 2024 12:20 PM\nWhat he said\nPosted by:\nIt's almost Friday and it's 56 degrees here.\nMy contribution to today's conversation:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/5evm5ec7\nPosted by: at January 25, 2024 12:21 PM (t/2Uw)\nI approve.\nPosted by: blaster at January 25, 2024 12:21 PM (xhfG9)\nPosted by: at January 25, 2024 12:21 PM (Q4IgG)\nI may be speculating about part of that, but their general creed is \"What's Worst For Everybody Is Best For Us.\"\n==========\nI have a theory:\nThese are delusional people of limited intelligence who are far too bared for their own good.\nDiscuss.\nPosted by:\nPosted by: Archimedes at January 25, 2024 12:21 PM (CsUN+)\nDefund Davos.\nDefund WEF.\nDefund UN.\nDefund NATO.\nThen we'll be friends.\nPosted by: Sponge - F*ck Joe Biden at January 25, 2024 12:20 PM (Zz0t1)\nDavos == WEF.

New enemies have to be identified, new strategies imagined, and new weapons devised.\nIn searching for a common enemy against whom we can unite, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like, would fit the bill. In their totality and their interactions these phenomena do constitute a common threat which must be confronted by everyone together. But in designating these dangers as the enemy, we fall into the trap, which we have already warned readers about, namely mistaking symptoms for causes. All these dangers are caused by human intervention in natural processes, and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome. The real enemy then is humanity itself.\nPosted by: JackStraw at January 25, 2024 12:48 PM (ZLI7S)\nPosted by: redridinghood at January 25, 2024 12:48 PM (NpAcC)\nhttp://tiny.cc/3paawz\nPosted by: Joe Mannix (Not a cop!)\nIt's always interesting when they wear a cross above the cleavage.\nPosted by: Bulgaroctonus at January 25, 2024 12:49 PM (9yWhg)\nPosted by: Mark Andrew Edwards, anti-Marxist, buy ammo and keep your rifle by your side\n.......\na busty bikini brunette with a wedgie will do just fine.\nPosted by: wth at January 25, 2024 12:49 PM (v0R5T)\nhttp://tinyurl.com/4muv3dwn\nPosted by: Anonosaurus Wrecks, Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here at January 25, 2024 12:49 PM (FVME7)\nPosted by: t-bird at January 25, 2024 12:49 PM (oe+gT)\nPosted by: Joe Mannix (Not a cop!) at January 25, 2024 12:36 PM (mwCIn)\n---\nYou're welcome.\nPosted by: The other admiral ackbar at January 25, 2024 12:49 PM (tT6L1)\nPosted by: American Hawkman at January 25, 2024 12:26 PM (skAOD)\nYou actually believe the mullahs want to please God?

    "text": "The creator of Harry Potter [ J.K Rowling ](https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/all-about/jk-rowling)has broken her silence after Edinburgh locals hit back following [traffic delays](https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-parents-fume-jk-rowlings-28503832) near her home. Traffic built up in the area as roads were restricted while maintenance work was being done on her giant leylandii hedge outside her home. The 58-year-old billionaire had the road opposite her 17th-century property restricted to allow a cherry picker to work on the shrubbery.

After speaking to the [MailOnline](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13006329/JK-Rowling-leylandii-row-Harry-Potter-author-says-trim-hedge-Edinburgh-home-year-gardening-traffic-chaos-school-run.html?ito=push-notification&ci=H8_GCGI0qy&cri=BqXtBq-5Q7&si=Wd6VC8IhhHLS&xi=bfe0bc7b-a804-4196-90f6-7f1bc97e3c38&ai=13006329), Ms Rowling's representatives insisted that the lights were necessary for safety. A spokesperson said: \"The hedge cutting at JK Rowling's residence is annual maintenance that involves necessary traffic management for the safety of the general public. The intention is always to carry out the work with least disruption and the timing requires co-ordination and agreement with Edinburgh City Council. \"The work would ideally be scheduled in July, during the summer holidays, but due to other maintenance work in the area, it was agreed to take place this week instead.\" Work to the 30-foot bushes began on Wednesday, January 24. It is expected to last until the end of the week.

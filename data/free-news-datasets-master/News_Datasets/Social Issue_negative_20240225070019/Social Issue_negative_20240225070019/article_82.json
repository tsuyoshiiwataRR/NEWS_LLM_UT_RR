    "text": "Fans were overcome with frustration during Thursday’s episode of The Traitors as Mollie continued to pledge her loyalty to Harry.\nMollie remained completely convinced that Harry was 100% faithful as he walked through the door for breakfast, having survived another night without being murdered by the traitors.\nBut while the disability model has mused that it is odd that a player so good at catching traitors is still in the game, she hasn’t put two and two together and figured out that Harry himself is the notorious villain.\nDiscussing her theories, Mollie confidently said she would be happy to win the game with Harry stood beside her, yet it seems she may have clocked onto the fact Andrew is also a traitor.\nWith only one day until the show’s finale, fans took to Twitter as they urged Mollie to question her loyalty to Harry.\nFans are left frustrated as Mollie’s loyalty to Harry blinds her from the truth…but praise her suspicions about Andrew\nDiscussing her theories, Mollie confidently said she would be happy to win the game with Harry stood beside her, yet it seems she may have clocked onto the fact Andrew is also a traitor\nOne joked: ‘Mollie would not think it was Harry if he cut her feet off with an axe and said ‘I am also a real life murderer”.’\nA second wrote: ‘Mollie is SMITTEN by Harry. Harry could tattoo ‘I’m a traitor’ on his forehead and she wouldn’t believe it.’\nMeanwhile a third urged the star to put the pieces of the puzzle together and out the remaining traitors.\nThey wrote: ‘Surely Mollie is capable of putting the final piece together to understand that there’s a reason Andrew and Ross were talking about Harry…’\nAnother added: ‘Mollie is almost there tbh. She just needs a push in the right direction or just one little hint and she’ll figure Harry out.’\nAnother cried: ‘HE IS THE TROUBLE MOLLIE!!!!’\nAnd another penned: ‘”I don’t know why I’m still here”. Erm, that’s because Harry is playing you and you will never peg him as a traitor despite all the clues\n‘Harry needs Mollie to get him to the final’.\nWith only one day until the show’s finale, fans took to Twitter as they urged Mollie to question her loyalty to Harry\nYet other’s praised Mollie for her detective work regarding Andrew, as she began to cast her suspicions.\nOne wrote: ‘Mollie actually came out with a good theory and reasoning toward Andrew. Shock!’\nAnother suggested: ‘I genuinely have a theory that mollie is fully aware Harry is a traitor and is letting their friendship pull her through to the final and then will turn round and banish him in the final. I feel like we might have underestimated her’.\nAnother wrote: ‘Mollie discussing Andrew as a liar even AFTER Ross was exposed as a traitor? The smartest thing Mollie has done in 11 episodes.’\nWhile another penned: ‘Mollie in 11 episodes: hardly make any accusations. Mollie today: comes with the complete correct theory and becomes Agatha Christie’.\nAnother shared a frustrated meme of Jimmy Fallon with the caption ‘WAKE UP\nAnother added: ‘Exactly Mollie why would the traitors save Harry when they know he hasn’t got shield this time. Don’t have a clue these lot’.\nYet other’s praised Mollie for her detective work regarding Andrew, as she began to cast her suspicions\n***\nRead more at DailyMail.co.uk",

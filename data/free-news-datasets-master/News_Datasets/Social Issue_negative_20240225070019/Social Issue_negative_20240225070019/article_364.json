    "text": "FILE PHOTO: REUTERS\nSome local government units (LGUs) are still implementing policies and regulations that lead to delays and higher costs, prompting the interagency body regulating the prices of local goods to form a team to address these concerns.\nThe Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on Wednesday night said that the National Price Coordinating Council (NPCC) has formed a technical working group that would be led by the Department of Justice (DOJ).\nADVERTISEMENT READ: Wanted: Other ways to reopen economy The DTI, which chairs the NPCC, said the DOJ has enforcement capabilities to correct the policies and procedures being implemented by LGUs.The issue was raised during the council’s meeting by the United Broilers Raisers Association Inc. (Ubra) and the Philippine Chamber of Food Manufacturers Inc.\nFEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO Execs with access to ‘root server’ may manipulate lottery system — PCSO IT official NEWSINFO Public advisory: Take alternative walkways as footbridge demolition to begin in QC NEWSINFO VP Duterte to implement policies increasing take-home pay of teachers The two groups complained that the permits and restrictions from these LGUs were triggered by concerns about the spread of African swine flu.\nIn September last year, President Marcos ordered local governments to suspend the collection of so-called pass-through fees on national roads to ensure the efficient movement of goods and produce across the country.\nFowl raisers’ concern The directive removed one of the extra logistical costs incurred by truckers as well as by manufacturing companies and agricultural producers that was ultimately passed on to consumers, according to Executive Order No. 4, which took effect on Sept. 28.\nThe order also “strongly urged” the suspension of fees “such as, but not limited to, sticker fees, discharging fees, delivery fees, market fees, toll fees, entry fees or mayor’s permit fees that are imposed upon all motor vehicles transporting goods and passing through any local public roads constructed and funded by … [LGUs].”\nREAD: BIZ BUZZ: Overbearing LGU mayor Ubra president Elias Jose Inciong told the Inquirer that restrictive regulations from some LGUs still persist today despite measures from the government last year to promote the ease of doing business by suspending pass-through fees.\n“Our main concern right now is their quarantine policies concerning the movement of animals. The requirements are not standard and it differs depending on the LGU. Some have strict requirements, others have less,” Inciong said in a phone interview.\nADVERTISEMENT He said the most tedious regulations were from Nueva Ecija, where they are having trouble when it comes to transporting chicks, particularly for day-old ones.\nMultiple trips “In other provinces, there are no requirements when transporting day-old chicks. The issuance of the veterinary certificate is also tedious for us,” he added, referring to the documentary requirement from the Provincial Veterinary Office.\nThe Ubra official added that another problem arising from this requirement was that the office often limited the volume of goods that could be transported, which meant they had to make multiple trips, thereby causing delays and additional fuel and manpower costs.\n“I understand that they can do this if there is an (avian flu) outbreak. But these regulations should not be there when there is none,” he pointed out.\n“We have [raised this] with the [Department of the Interior and Local Government] and we are doing so again. Maybe we can still resolve this through a [meeting]. But right now, given the challenges in the poultry sector, we are just worried that things might just get worse,” Inciong said.\nPrice monitoring Aside from forming the new technical working group, the DTI said that the council also decided to look into the integration of price monitoring data from its different member agencies to stabilize prices.\n“The DTI’s prime mandate is to protect consumers and ensure fair trade practices. We are proactively looking for the best possible ways to stabilize the supply of basic goods at reasonable prices,” said Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual.\n“We are also currently assessing restrictive market regulations that may affect the intent of producers to enter the Philippine market and the effectiveness of benchmarking prices of goods with other neighboring [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries,” he added.\nIn the meeting, the council also proposed to the Department of Agriculture to conduct weekend monitoring activities, and to collaborate with the DTI and the Department of Information and Communications Technology.\nAn integrated price monitoring would hopefully allow consumers to compare prices in different markets and buy where the lowest prices are available.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

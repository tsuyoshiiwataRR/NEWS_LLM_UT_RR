    "text": "Jan. 24—In the last 10 years, electronic cannabis pens have completely taken marijuana smokers by storm. The ease of a quick hit has never been as convenient, low-key or efficient. A variety of cartridges can be found in just about any dispensary, with more new strains constantly being released.\nHowever, this surge of vapor products has left some wondering about the safety aspects. How regulated are cannabis cartridges and disposables? How can I be sure I’m smoking safely?\nThe biggest concern when it comes to product safety, beyond consumption, is pesticides, according to Brian Smith, media director for the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (LCB). Some pesticides can be safely used in cannabis production, but others cannot. The Washington State Department of Agriculture has a list of approved pesticides, and you can sign up for updates.\nBecause there are so many kinds of pesticides, the WSDA specifies which unapproved pesticides are more likely to be used in cannabis production. Products are tested for these pesticides.\nMarket-ready cannabis cartridges\nProducts have to be tested extensively before they enter the marketplace, but some things can still slip through the cracks. Laboratories where cannabis products are produced must undergo an extensive certification process.\nFields of testing include:\n* Heavy metal analysis\n* Microbial analysis\n* Pesticide analysis\n* Potency analysis\n* Residual solvent analysis\n* Water activity analysis\nProducts that fail pesticide testing are destroyed.\nBut what happens if you use a product and still suspect pesticides? Or what if there is another safety issue, like mold? Here’s what you can do.\nReporting unsafe cannabis products\nThe LCB accepts consumer reports of unsafe products and potential violations, both over the phone and online.\nIf reporting online, mark the violation type as “other.” You’ll want to look up the grower and processor of the product, to include that information when reporting.\nIf you make a report over the phone, call the enforcement customer service line at 360-664-9878.\nSmith says LCB responds to all reports and looks into each claim. It has testing agreements with the WSDA and the Washington State Patrol’s toxicology lab, which are used to follow-up on the majority of claims.\nThis story was originally published January 24, 2024, 6:59 AM.\n(c)2024 Tri-City Herald (Kennewick, Wash.)

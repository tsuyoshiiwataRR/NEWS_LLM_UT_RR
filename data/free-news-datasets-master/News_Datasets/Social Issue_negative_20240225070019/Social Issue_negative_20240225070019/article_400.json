    "text": "According to [ nme.com](https://www.nme.com/news/music/coachella-sees-slowest-ticket-sales-in-10-years-for-2024-line-up-3577024), this year’s [Coachella](https://music.mxdwn.com/2024/01/16/news/coachella-announces-2024-lineup-featuring-lana-del-rey-doja-cat-tyler-the-creator-more/) has seen the slowest ticket sales in a decade. As [SFGate](https://www.sfgate.com/sf-culture/article/coachella-festival-sees-slowest-ticket-sales-10-18624027.php) reports, the festival’s first weekend is still yet to sell out after six days on sale, which is the slowest ticket sales in a decade. Back in 2015, tickets went in less than an hour, while it took less than half a day for the festival to sell out in 2022. Earlier this month, Coachella revealed this year’s lineup will feature performances by [Lana Del Rey,](https://music.mxdwn.com/2024/01/06/news/lana-del-rey-doja-cat-tyler-the-creator-reportedly-slated-to-headline-coachella-2024/) [Tyler, The Creator](https://music.mxdwn.com/2019/07/13/news/yuna-debuts-personal-new-track-castaway-featuring-tyler-the-creator/) and [Doja Cat](https://music.mxdwn.com/2024/01/15/news/doja-cat-teases-possible-follow-up-to-scarlet-with-new-tracklist/), with a special appearance by a reunited [No Doubt](https://music.mxdwn.com/2022/12/27/news/gwen-stefani-talks-possibility-of-no-doubt-reunion/). Also performing will be [Blur](https://music.mxdwn.com/2023/12/06/news/damon-albarn-says-he-is-wrapping-up-with-blur-for-now-to-focus-on-gorillaz/), Peso Pluma, J Balvin, Ice Spice, Khruangbin, Jhené Aiko, Lil Uzi Vert, Justice, [Deftones](https://music.mxdwn.com/2023/11/25/news/chino-moreno-details-madonnas-signing-of-deftones-to-maverick-records-in-1994/), Jungle, Dom Dolla, Bleachers, Peggy Gou, Grimes, a reunited Sublime and others. Coachella 2023 saw the likes of [Bad Bunny](https://music.mxdwn.com/2024/01/09/austin/bad-bunny-at-moody-center-on-april-26-27/), [Blackpink,](https://music.mxdwn.com/2023/06/26/news/the-weeknd-and-blackpinks-jennie-share-new-song-from-the-idol-soundtrack-one-of-the-girls/) and [Frank Ocean](https://music.mxdwn.com/2023/11/09/news/frank-ocean-shares-teaser-for-new-song/) headline the festival’s two weekends. After [Ocean](https://music.mxdwn.com/2023/04/20/news/ice-skaters-allegedly-slated-for-frank-oceans-coachella-2023-performance-discuss-production-switch-up/)’s controversial set and his eventual dropping out of weekend two, Skrillex, Fred again.. and Four Tet stepped in to play the closing set.",

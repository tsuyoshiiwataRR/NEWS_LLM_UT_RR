    "text": "“CBS Mornings” co-host Tony Dokoupil described how he and his team couldn't find anyone outside a New Hampshire grocery store who “felt good about the economy.”\nWhile previewing an upcoming CBS News segment to air Sunday, Dokoupil noted how people complained about high food prices, despite the economy being improving.\nThe co-host made the claim as President Biden tries to sell his economic accomplishments — aka “Bidennomics” — ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\nSpeaking to local New Hampshire CBS anchors, Dokoupil explained, “People in New Hampshire are really upset about the economy. Even though the overall big picture numbers may be going in the right direction, and even though people's own personal experiences are generally going well, there is still a lot of disappointment.\nExplaining the reason for this, he said, “For example, food prices are generally increasing. And we talked to a group of people outside a grocery store in Derry, New Hampshire — we couldn't find anyone who felt good about the economy.\nDespite President Biden's insistence that his economic policies are working, most Americans are not happy with the state of the economy. getty images\nThe anchor expressed that the negative attitude is “just human nature”, adding, “Psychologically, you go into a store, if you're paying more for the items you get every week, it's It really sticks with you, it really bothers you, it gets you down. People were upset by it.”\nHe notes that locals are surviving, that they are “making it” despite the high prices, although he is angry.\n“Yes, they are making it. But are they bothered by the fact that Frozen OJ is up by double digits and Steak Friday is up by double digits? Absolutely. And it's really inspiring people's perspective on things,” he declared.\nDokoupil's comments previewed the “CBS Evening News” broadcast Sunday, which showed footage of him talking to some of these locals.\nIn an interview, Dokoupil spoke to a local woman and tried to reassure her with the fact that the government had brought down the inflation rate. The woman laughed at the host and shook her head, replying, “I don't know what pocketbook they're looking at, but it's not mine.”\nShe also said that she would have to get another job.\nDokoupil also spoke to another family, who explained to him that almost every member works so that the family can survive. A young man from the family said, “There are six of us in the house. Five of us work. You know, it's like, if you go back 30 years, maybe two incomes would have covered all our expenses.”\nSource: nypost.com",

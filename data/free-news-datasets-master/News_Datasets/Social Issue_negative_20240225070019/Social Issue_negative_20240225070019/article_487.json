    "text": "After defaulting on its foreign loans in early 2022, the Sri Lankan government agreed to restructure both its external and domestic debt, as required by its bailout agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The adjustment has had dire consequences for the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), the country's largest superannuation fund, which covers nearly 60% of the private-sector and semi-government workforce.In September, the Central Bank of Sri Lank (CBSL) announced that the EPF had two options for its portfolio of treasury bonds under the domestic debt restructuring plan. The first was to increase the tax rate applied to the EPF's investment income to 30% -- more than double the current rate of 14%. The second was to exchange the treasury bonds for new ones with lower interest rates of 12% per year until 2026 and 9% after that, a sharp drop from the current average rate of more than 20%. The CBSL's Monetary Board opted for the latter, although both scenarios would have shrunk retirement savings significantly.While this is bad news for all elderly Sri Lankans, who are already the country's poorest group, it will disproportionately hurt older women. To be sure, they receive fewer benefits, given that the EPF caters to workers in formal employment, and women's participation in the labour market has consistently remained low, at 30-35%, over the last few decades. But even women without direct access to these savings often rely on them indirectly because they are financially dependent on men or collect their deceased spouse's benefits. More importantly, the feminisation of ageing has lengthened the retirement period for Sri Lanka's women, who not only live six years longer than the country's men but are also eligible to claim their benefits under the EPF at age 50, whereas men must wait until age 55.This matters because, as a defined contribution plan, the EPF provides the mandatory contributions paid by employers and employees, together with accumulated interest, as a lump sum at retirement. In 2021, the EPF paid an average benefit of around US$2,000 (71,430 baht) -- equivalent to only four years of average consumption per person. Women must, therefore, stretch this already inadequate amount over more years than men. And with lower bond yields, workers will receive an even smaller lump sum.This shows the threat domestic debt restructuring poses to women's income security and economic dependence in old age. It also highlights the importance of safeguarding pension funds to ensure the welfare of elderly people more generally. Instead of treating all treasury bonds equally, Sri Lanka's restructuring plan targeted those held by retirement funds (as opposed to financial institutions or private stakeholders). Moreover, EPF beneficiaries could not push back against this policy as neither employees nor employers have a say in the fund's management.To improve transparency, the EPF board must be restructured to ensure that member interests are represented in the decision-making process. After all, beneficiaries bear the risk of mismanagement. Employers and employees of both genders could hold the board accountable for its investment portfolio, 93.4% of which was in rupee loans, treasury bonds, and treasury bills in 2020, and resist changes that reduce their retirement savings.The law that established the EPF should be changed to make the retirement age the same for men and women and to establish crediting mechanisms for periods of childcare. Sri Lanka should also spur more competition in the retirement fund market, which would give beneficiaries more choices and, in turn, encourage more service-oriented fund management. Finally, individuals should be given a greater say in managing their pensions. In the long term, ensuring the economic welfare of older women in Sri Lanka requires thoughtful and adequately financed measures to improve their access to formal-sector employment. ©2024 Project SyndicateNisha Arunatilake, Director of Research at the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka, is a research fellow at the Partnership for Economic Policy.",

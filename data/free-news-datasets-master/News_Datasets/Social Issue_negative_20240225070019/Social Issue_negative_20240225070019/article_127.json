    "text": "SINGAPORE: A Singaporean teenager of Chinese ethnicity was issued a restriction order by the Internal Security Department (ISD) in November 2023 for espousing white supremacist ideologies , raising concerns about far-right extremism in Singapore.\nThe 16-year-old, according to ISD, had not planned to carry out any attacks in Singapore. Instead, he hoped to be recruited by white supremacist groups to partake in acts of violence overseas.\nWhite supremacy, an extreme right-wing ideology, is based on the belief that whites are racially superior and ought to be protected against perceived threats from non-whites and groups such as LGBTQ+ communities, socialists and feminists.\nThis marks the second case of far-right radicalisation that ISD has dealt with.\nIn its first case in 2020, ISD detained a Singaporean teenager for harbouring violent anti-Muslim sentiments and planning to carry out knife attacks at two mosques in Singapore. The youth, a Protestant Christian of Indian ethnicity, was inspired by the mosque shootings in Christchurch by the far-right terrorist Brenton Tarrant.",

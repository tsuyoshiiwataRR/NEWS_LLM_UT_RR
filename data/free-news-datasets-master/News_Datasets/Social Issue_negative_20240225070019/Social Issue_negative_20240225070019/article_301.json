    "text": "[Heatwave warnings](https://7news.com.au/weather) have been issued for four Australian states, with millions of people set to swelter on [Australia Day](https://7news.com.au/news/australia-day). Large parts of central and eastern Australia are in for another day of heat after widespread temperatures above 40C on Thursday, with some inland areas nudging 50C.

Temperatures in towns across the Hunter including Cessnock, Scone and Singleton will also rise by 1-2C on Thursday’s temperatures with Singleton expecting a peak of 43C and Scone 41C. The lower and upper west of the state will again bear the brunt of the heat with Bourke to hit 44C and Moree 42C. Residents across parts of the state could see a thunderstorm roll through in the afternoon and evening. NSW Health has warned residents to drink plenty of water and stay as cool as possible. “Avoid exercising in the hottest part of the day and if you have to go outside, stay hydrated and wear sun protection,” it said. Inland areas of southern Australia’s north and southwest Queensland are also set to be warm, but markedly less so than Thursday, when temperatures sat in the mid to high 40s. South Australia will be noticeably cooler, with temperatures dropping about 10C and Adelaide forecasting a 24C maximum. A severe heatwave warning, however, still remains in Flinders, North West Pastoral and North East Pastoral Districts. Heatwave conditions for parts of Queensland’s west and interior are set to continue, though most regions will experience a welcome drop in temperature. Brisbane is forecast to peak at 33C and the Gold Coast 35C. A severe heat warning has been issued for the Simpson District in the NT, while Alice Springs, Borroloola and Tennant Creek are expected to reach maximum temperatures in the high 30s. Darwin is forecast to reach a maximum of 29C on Australia Day, with a 100 per cent chance of rain. Parts of the state are also on flood watch due to ex-cyclone Kirrily which is expected to make its approach over the weekend. In good news, cooler air spreading across the southern and eastern states will lead to temperatures noticeably dropping by Friday late afternoon. The forecast change will bring cooler weather for almost all areas on the weekend. - With AAP Stream Free on",

    "text": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment To This Post)\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what's goin' down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin' gets done, and where, if he needs a third eye, he just grows it.\nI must have missed it on the news or something but, apparently, it was Crazy Wingnut Bill Filing Week out in the several states. Let us begin in Tennessee , which has become a target-rich environment for such things. From the Tennessean:\nRep. Jason Zachary, R-Knoxville, filed House Bill 1895 . The legislation would establish a new Class C felony, which could carry three to 15 years in prison, for an adult that \"recruits, harbors or transports\" a pregnant minor for the purposes of receiving an out-of-state abortion or for getting abortion medication. Parents or legal guardians are exempt and would be allowed to take their pregnant child out of state. However, if another adult helps a pregnant minor obtain an abortion, the minor's consent doesn't matter. The legislation would also open up adults charged under the law to civil liability, allowing the biological mother or her parents to sue the adult who facilitated the abortion. The biological father could also sue, unless the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest as defined in Tennessee criminal code. There are far too many people in our land who are nostalgic for the days of the Fugitive Slave Act.\nUp in Kentucky, the current wingnut hobby-horse has been taken out for a ride. From WKLY:\nRep. Jennifer Decker filed House Bill 9, which would prohibit colleges and universities from creating positions or implementing programs aimed at boosting diversity, equity and inclusion. She believes that universities are wasting money on salaries for DEI officers that should instead be going to minority students. \"It is an exorbitant cost that does not seem to result in a metric that is an indication that our campuses are more diverse,\" Decker said. I don't want to intimate that Rep. Decker's concern for increasing the funding for \"minority students\" at Kentucky's universities is based in obvious bad faith, but Rep. Decker's concern for increasing the funding for \"minority students\" is based in obvious bad faith. From the Lexington Herald-Leader .\nDecker’s bill includes provisions intended to limit its reach into the classroom and more pointedly target university administration. It states that nothing in the bill shall be construed to limit academic freedom, academic course material, research or compliance with federal and state laws or court orders...It codifies a ban on “manipulating or influencing” the composition of a student body on the basis of race, religion, sex, color or national origin. That comports with the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling last year that held that race-based affirmative action admissions programs are unconstitutional. Decker’s proposed legislation also targets “discriminatory concepts.” Those are defined as “presenting as truth, rather than as a subject for inquiry, that an existing structure system or relation of power, privilege or subordination persists on the basis of oppression, colonialism, socioeconomic status, religion, race, sex, color, or national origin.” That last part is very, very special. Power, privilege, or subordination is now declared not to persist. Poof! Thank you, Rep. Decker, you magical wingnut, you.\nMeanwhile, over in Missouri, a cannibal feast has broken out within the Republican legislative majority, which has been spinning off into the wingnutosphere for some time now. From NPR in St. Louis:\n“The beginning of the 2024 legislative session in the Senate has been nothing short of an embarrassment,” Senate President Pro Tem Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, said Tuesday, flanked by 14 fellow Republican senators. “A chamber designed to be occupied with civil, principled statesmen and women has been overtaken by a small group of swamp creatures, who all too often remind me more of my children than my colleagues.” Go, Senator Caleb, go! Although, it seems like you just called your kids \"swamp creatures.\"\nAt least twice the session, inquiries and actions from the Freedom Caucus have caused the Senate to adjourn abruptly. Last Thursday, the Freedom Caucus filibustered for over eight hours to hold up the approval of 25 appointments by Gov. Mike Parson. Those appointments included Robert Knodell and Paula Nickelson as the permanent directors of the departments of Social Services and Health and Senior Services, respectively. Members of the caucus held up the appointments because they believed the Senate was not moving forward fast enough on asking voters to make it harder to amend Missouri’s constitution. The caucus threatened to continue to hold up the appointments until such a plan passes the Senate. Speaking on the Senate floor Tuesday to Eigel, Rowden said the end of last week “became a crescendo that I could no longer ignore.” “I said this to you last week and I'll say it again, what you did last week was aimed at undercutting the floor leader [Sen. Cindy O’Laughlin, R-Shelbina],” Rowden said. Senator Caleb also took some familiar Beacon Hill-style retribution on the committee chairmen he'd canned.\nIn addition to being stripped of their chairmanships, the senators were assigned new parking spots that are farther away from the Capitol. Go full Billy Bulger, Senator Caleb. Put their desks in a hallway.\nWe now will dedicate the rest of our semi-regular weekly survey to the doings in the great state of Oklahoma. The legislature there seems to have discovered some unusual mushrooms growing out in back of the Capitol. First, there is the anti-furries bill. From the Oklahoman:\nOne Oklahoma lawmaker, Rep. Justin Humphrey, R-Lane, decided to file a bill targeting \"furries,\" or people in a subculture interested in anthropomorphic animal characters, in Oklahoma schools. Humphrey's bill, House Bill 3084 , would ban \"students who purport to be an imaginary animal or animal species, or who engage in anthropomorphic behavior commonly referred to as furries at school\" from participating in class and school activities. The bill would require parents or guardians to pick the student up from school. But, if parents are unable to pick the student up, the bill says \"animal control services shall be contacted to remove the student.\" How? Nets? Trank guns. I see an opening for a new Discovery Channel show— The Furry Hunters . Genius.\nElsewhere in the Chamber Of Crackpots, we find a bill that, even if it passes, surely will be overturned for approximately 535 reasons . From Fox25 in Oklahoma City:\nOne bill, filed on Tuesday by Rep. Justin Humphrey (R-Lane), could prove controversial for the legislature. House Bill 3133 would label any Hispanic person who is part of a gang a terrorist. The bill states a Hispanic person who has been convicted of gang-related offenses shall be \"deemed to have committed an act of terrorism.\" If that happens, the person could have their real estate, money, vehicles and personal property seized by the state. The levels of discrimination in this bill are almost incalculable. And this is the state in which was carried out the single most deadly act of actual terrorism in the country's history, which, by the by, was not carried out by anyone named Juan or Manuel. But the real star in the early going is a rookie legislator named Dusty Deevers, a preacher who won a special election who has really hit the ground running, although in what direction remains uncertain. From The Sentinel :\nOklahoma Republican State Senator Dusty Deevers proposed a number of bills this week meant to abolish abortion, repeal no-fault divorce, and ban pornography, as well as introduce a crackdown on false testimony with respect to crimes, reform election laws, eliminate state income taxes, provide a grocery tax rebate, and create electronic access for transactional gold. Reverend Dusty has an explanation for everything he does, although his rationale for the end of no-fault divorce seems a bit too Game of Thrones for this millennium.\n“When a man leaves his father and mother, and he and his wife become one flesh, that is the foundation of a strong nation and civilization,” he wrote in a recent opinion piece about the necessity of reforming divorce laws. “Governing for the common good is the charge of all sitting in public office. It is abundantly clear that the current regime of no-fault divorce has torn down the castles that uphold the strength of the realm. We must do away with this policy for the justice of the oppressed, the strength of the nation, and the future of humanity.” \"Castles\"? \"Strength of the realm\"? \"The realm\"? Forsooth, what manner of witchcraft is this?\n“Our team took a no-compromise stance against the greatest evils of our day and for the freedom and liberty of the people,” he said in a statement after his election. “We defeated some big-money, establishment interests on a shoestring budget. It truly is of God that we won.” God had better writers once upon a time.\nAnd we conclude, as promised and as is our custom, in exactly the same place, the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official chuckwalla whisperer Friedman of the Plains brings us a tale of true meritocracy in government hiring. From the Oklahoman:\nRaichik is a former Brooklyn real estate agent who grew up in Los Angeles. The California woman behind the “Libs of TikTok” social media account will serve on the Oklahoma Library Media Advisory Committee. She created the @LibsofTikTok handle on Twitter, now X, in April 2021. \"Libs of TikTok\" has over 2.8 million followers and reposts TikTok videos of users sharing liberal views while adding derisive conservative commentary. Records show Raichik lived in Florida at least until the end of 2023 before moving from Brooklyn and Los Angeles. There's no indication Raichik has ever lived in Oklahoma, and there isn't any property in Oklahoma County under her name. When asked about where Raichik lives, Dan Isett, an Oklahoma Department of Education spokesperson, emailed The Oklahoman this statement: \"Superintendent Walters appointed Raichik to this advisory board because no one has done more to bring attention to what the left does in our schools. Her insight is invaluable, and she will work hard to keep porn and woke indoctrination out of the classroom.\" I guess Steve Bannon's line was busy.\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.\nRelated Story Who Is Charles Koch When He's At Home? Charles P.

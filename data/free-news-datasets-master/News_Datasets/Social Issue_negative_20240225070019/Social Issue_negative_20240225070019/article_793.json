    "text": "The Russian IL-76 plane that crashed in the Belgorod region on January 24, according to the representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR) of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andrey Yusov\nsupplied weapons to the occupiers.\nOn January 24, Russian media reported that an Il-76 military transport plane had crashed in the Belgorod region. It crashed near the Krivoje farm. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war were on board and were to be exchanged.\nAccording to Jusov, the same IL-76 aircraft was previously spotted at the Engels-2 airfield, which is used to secure advanced strategic aviation. He also drove the missiles that\nRussia regularly launches into Ukrainian territory.\n“This is an aircraft that delivered S-300 and S-400 missiles to the Belgorod region for strikes on Kharkiv and the region there. The Russians themselves say that these means are used to supply enemy forces, and at the same time they are probably also used to transport prisoners,” said Andrej Jusov. “Both missiles for the S-300 complex and missiles and people can be on board at the same time. We are talking about a large military aircraft. According to them, it was only one-third loaded.”\nAccording to Yusov, the plane was supposed to carry “several VIPs from the Russian military and political leadership”, but at the last minute the FSB “ordered them not to board this plane and use other means of transport”.\nThe intelligence official also said that if\nRussia is indeed transporting prisoners and ammunition on the same machine, it is an admission of another war crime by the Russian armed forces.\nThere is no official\ninformation available regarding the prisoners of war who were allegedly on board according to Russian media. At the same time, GUR added that the issue of handing over citizens for exchange is the responsibility of the country that holds them, and Ukraine, on its part, did everything to make it happen.\n“The civilian transport with Russian prisoners was on the spot, it is in the direction of Sumy. Everything was ready for the exchange. The relevant services were warned, a quiet regime was ensured in this direction. The border guard, security and defense forces, all worked properly,” Andrej Jusov said.\nThere was no\ninformation from the Russian side notifying how exactly the prisoners would be transported to the agreed location. A ceasefire regime was agreed upon during previous exchanges.\nA January 25 report says that only five bodies were brought to the Belgorod morgue after the crash of the IL-76 plane. This would correspond to the number of crew members. According to Jusov, the remains of human bodies are not visible on the\nvideo from the plane crash site.",

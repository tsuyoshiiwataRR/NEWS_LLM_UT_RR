However, following challenges from the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Constitution Foundation, a judicial review was conducted.\nThe court concluded on Tuesday, Jan. 23, that Trudeau and his cabinet's actions were unjustified.\nThe controversy began in February 2022 when truck drivers, protesting the mandatory Covid-19 vaccination for crossing the Canada-U.S. border, caused significant disruptions.\nThey formed blockades on crucial roads in Ottawa, leading the mayor to declare a state of emergency. In response, Trudeau activated the 1988 Emergencies Act, imposing a ban on gatherings and disrupting crowdfunding initiatives.\nThe truckers, who had gained widespread support, faced setbacks when their fundraising efforts on GoFundMe were thwarted.\nThey then turned to the Bitcoin-based platform Tallycoin , successfully raising over $540,000, including a notable 1 BTC donation from Kraken CEO Jesse Powell .\nEvander Smart , the founder of Bitcoin University , told Benzinga that what Canada's government, law enforcement, and Trudeau did to hard-working, honest Canadian citizens is a \"national travesty.\"\nHe added that this might be seen as a defining moment in Trudeau's tenure as Prime Minister, highlighting Bitcoin's role in countering such governmental overreach.\nRead Also: EXCLUSIVE - Spot Ethereum ETF Could Unlock 'Full-Scale, Global Adoption,' Experts Tell Benzinga\nFollowing Judge Richard Mosley 's decision, Trudeau's political adversaries have seized the opportunity to highlight this as another misstep by the Prime Minister.\nWith the upcoming elections, where the Conservatives are leading in polls over Trudeau's Liberal party, this ruling could have significant political implications. Mosley acknowledged, however, that he had access to more information than the government when the decision to invoke the act was made.\nDeputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland announced the government's intention to appeal the court's decision, indicating that the legal and political ramifications of this ruling are far from over.\nCould This Happen In The U.S.? : Smart criticized the Biden administration for its approach to digital currencies, contrasting it with former President Donald Trump 's stance, influenced by Vivek Ramaswamy 's insights into digital currencies.\nIt's worth noting that Trump has equated Bitcoin's value to \"thin air\" and promised never to allow CBDCs in the U.S.\nRead Next: XRP ETF: Hype Or Hope?

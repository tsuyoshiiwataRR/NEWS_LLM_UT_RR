    "text": "The Interministerial Delegation for Human Rights (DIDH) has expressed its “total rejection” of the allegations contained in the section devoted to Morocco in the Human Rights Watch (HRW) 2023 report, published on January 11, reaffirming its willingness to interact constructively and positively with serious and professional Non-Governmental Organizations. After reviewing the section devoted to Morocco in the HRW report, the DIDH deplores, in a statement, the fact that “the organization persists in its hostile campaigns against our country and in adopting an approach to assessing the human rights situation in Morocco that deliberately transgresses the main methodological rules and standards recognized in the work of NGOs, namely impartiality, objectivity and professionalism”. Elaborating on this point, the Interministerial delegation stresses that “due to the inability of this organization to project a realistic image of human rights in Morocco, its report was limited to recycling allegations repeated in previous reports, based on one-sided and outdated narratives, conveyed by hostile parties or instrumentalizing the human rights issue for specific ends”. By way of illustration, the DIDH cites events dating back a decade or more, and others relating to issues already dealt with in the context of full respect for legal legality and human rights, while stubbornly ignoring the main reliable data provided by official sources, including those available on the official electronic pages of the UN Human Rights Mechanisms. Also, “the organization has reproduced certain paragraphs from its previous reports, in connection with its bias towards the allegations peddled by one of the associations claiming that its work is hindered, without the NGO providing any documented data likely to substantiate these allegations”. The report, notes the DIDH, “reveals the persistence of the selective approach adopted by the organization, as well as its impartiality in focusing only on certain cases brought before the courts, while ignoring others”. The organization went so far as to formulate general conclusions without providing any evidence to back them up, in the absence of an independent analysis and presentation of data drawn from a reasoned reading of judgments and judicial decisions, while ignoring the available data produced by independent institutions empowered to monitor the progress of related trials. “Some of the issues raised again in this report had been dropped in the organization’s previous reports”, the statement underlines, pointing out that revisiting these cases reveals the true intentions of the report’s authors. The report also denotes the organization’s inability to keep pace with the achievements and dynamics of human rights in Morocco, persisting in its deliberate choices to convey false allegations and facts devoid of any credibility, at a time when the Kingdom is open to all forms of international observation, particularly the United Nations human rights system, through sustained interaction over the past two years and a dynamic that has clearly demonstrated the unfounded nature of these allegations, especially as these international meetings have addressed, among other things, the issues that are the subject of this report and to which the organization has paid no attention. Another fact revealing a flagrant lack of professionalism: the organization ignored the substantial data provided by the National Human Rights Council on its role in the protection of human rights, in particular its national mechanisms whose periodic reports bear witness to the colossal efforts made by the Kingdom in the field of human rights promotion, the same source adds. According to the DIDH, the report lacks tangible and sufficient evidence to support the allegations of so-called excesses or violations, given that this organization adopts an approach of promoting the speeches of parties known for instrumentalizing human rights for political ends, resorting to vague statements denoting bad faith and hostility. The Interministerial Delegation cites allegations, including: “incarceration of individuals in alleged revenge for their criticism”, “use of twisted tactics to crush opposition and opponents”, “repressive climate”. It also adopts alleged allegations such as “the exploitation over the years of legal texts to prosecute individuals and imprison them even in the absence of evidence”, the statement points out, noting that this confirms that this report, like previous ones, lacks, from the point of view of methodology and language, objectivity, professionalism and impartiality, all foundations of the credibility and trust required in the reports of serious and responsible international NGOs. The DIDH also stresses that the organization had opted for partiality on the subject of the artificial regional dispute over the Moroccan Sahara, submitted to the UN Security Council, while ignoring Morocco’s efforts to settle this artificial regional dispute, efforts which have been described as “serious and credible” by the international community, and particularly by the UN. Instead, the organization has chosen to promote hostile allegations by Morocco’s adversaries, claiming for example that Morocco is “pressuring its Western allies to recognize its sovereignty” over the Sahara, adds the same source. In addition, the DIDH points out that the HRW also ignores the serious violations committed in the Tindouf camps, as well as the terrorist acts of the “polisario” targeting civilians and safe areas, noting that this proves that the organization has become an instrument in the hands of the enemies of the Kingdom’s territorial integrity. In this context, the Ministerial Delegation reaffirms its willingness to “interact constructively and positively with serious and professional NGOs, providing all clarifications and data that may contribute to the preparation of objective and impartial thematic reports, reflecting a true image of the reality of human rights in Morocco and contributing to its strengthening and promotion”.",

    "text": "Canada's new cap on international students is already being felt, as study permit applicants are starting to get refusal letters from visa posts, says the body representing Ontario's 24 public colleges. Marketa Evans, CEO of Colleges Ontario, told the Star on Thursday that the federal government has imposed a moratorium \"by stealth,\" with its new measures, and that it is \"wreaking havoc on people's lives.\" \"That's very arbitrary, very unfair. And we're calling on the government to end that moratorium and really bring some empathy and understanding to this situation.\" While it's too early for Evans to gauge the potential lost enrolment for her members, Ontario's colleges — and possibly universities — are expected to be the biggest losers after Immigration Minister [Marc Miller announced a plan to slash the number of new study permits](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/an-indictment-of-what-the-program-became-canada-sets-new-limits-on-work-permits-for/article_0206b92a-b929-11ee-a3d7-c33ab63f9e70.html) issued across Canada this year by 35 per cent from last year's level, to 364,000, while leaving the number of applicants accepted in master's and doctoral programs uncapped. Each province will be allotted a fixed number of new study permits relative to its population and will have to decide how to divvy up the spots among institutions authorized to accept international students. Ontario is the home to 51 per cent of Canada's international students, and most of the recent international enrolment growth has been with the college system, which offers shorter and cheaper programs than universities but still provides international students with access to postgraduation work permits that can lead to permanent residence. With declining provincial funding for post-secondary education, international students, who pay three to four times more in tuition fees than domestic students, have become a financial lifeline for many institutions — especially those in smaller communities outside Greater Toronto — that had struggled with declining domestic enrolment over the years. Saying that her focus now is to plead for the suspension of the federal government's cap, Evans did not provide a direct answer to how the colleges are going to fill the revenue gaps, which could potentially lead to a huge spike in already substantial international tuition fees. Such fees are unregulated. You might be interested in However, in a public statement Thursday, Colleges Ontario asked the province to step up by approving a modest $135 increase in per-student annual tuition and raising provincial grants by 10 per cent as [recommended recently by a blue-ribbon panel created by the Ontario government](https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/almost-half-of-ontario-universities-are-running-deficits-putting-student-services-at-risk-council-says/article_639ebedc-af31-11ee-bdce-47e37d4e1808.html) to look at the financial future of post-secondary institutions. \"There are modest changes the Ontario government can make right now to help us stabilize the system and keep programs and campuses open for domestic students as we work through this disruption,\" said the four-page statement. Public pressure on immigration Facing public pushback over high levels of immigration and criticism over their impact on affordable housing, Miller has been under the gun to restrict the number of temporary residents in Canada, and international students and postgraduation work permit holders make up a chunk of that population. On Monday, he implemented an immediate requirement for a letter of attestation from provincial governments to accompany all study permit applications even though, other than Quebec, no provinces have the process in place for generating such letters. \"What we're hearing from members is that students are getting a rejection without any explanation or without being told what to do about it,\" Evans said. \"Should you sit and wait? Should you apply somewhere else? It's very unclear.\" As opposed to universities, said Evans, public colleges have a year-round intake of students and many are well into the application process, ready to start in programs in May for key sectors of Ontario's economy; college graduates fill many of the jobs in advanced manufacturing, mining, the electrical vehicle industry, early childhood education, health care and housing construction, among others. \"Ending the moratorium would give us the runway to make the adjustments, at least, for the spring term,\" Evans noted. Starting Sept. 1, Ottawa will also stop issuing post-graduation work permits to international students who complete programs provided under so-called Public College-Private Partnerships. Further, the spouses of most international students will no longer be granted work permits, with the exception of those studying in graduate schools or in a professional programs such as medicine or law. Public-private partnership debate The public-private college partnerships, which allow graduates from private colleges to receive public college credentials and coveted post-graduation work permits, are sanctioned by the Ontario government and have become a growing concern for the quality of education delivered through some of the private partners. Sault College in northern Ontario brings in about $40 million in revenue and 2,800 students from its partnership with triOS, a private college with campuses in Toronto and Brampton, about one-third of its entire budget. Sault College president David Orazietti said post-secondary schools were urged to go out and raise revenue from the private sector to build partnerships. \"Those partnerships are driving revenue to support our operations,\" said Orazietti, a former Ontario Liberal cabinet minister. \"They support jobs at our college and they support the ability to train workers for our workforce, in our community, for our employers.\" Currently some 15 public colleges in Ontario have public-private partnerships, and of those, he said, 12 will face serious financial hardship as a result of reduced enrolments. \"There are certainly some unintended consequences,\" added Orazietti. \"I don't believe that Minister Miller was intending to undermine the financial stability of half of the public colleges in Ontario, but nevertheless, that's what he’s managed to do.\" The province has capped the number of international students enrolled in the public-private partnership programs for each public college at 7,500, but he said some schools were knowingly violating the rule and the provincial government has not followed through on threats to reduce their funding. A post-secondary international student compliance team should be established \"to actually enforce their policy directives,\" he added. Evans, however, criticized the federal government for \"conflating\" the challenge with the public college system and maintained that these partnerships are \"robustly\" regulated and audited from recruitment to programming, credential assessment and graduation, under strict ministerial directive by the province. That's supplemented, she said, by the [international education standards rolled out last year by Colleges Ontario](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/ontario-colleges-move-to-protect-international-students-before-and-after-they-come-to-canada/article_d27a9a48-7881-582a-bb12-748b2f0b3c89.html) that also apply to its members' private college partners. \"We want to really be careful and nuanced about not lumping everybody together, and understanding that this (cap) is a very blunt instrument, which on the face of it, does not actually improve quality,\" Evans said. \"Every college is going to feel this differently. So again, a blunt instrument really fails to take into account the fact that one size does absolutely not fit all.\"",

    "text": "By Dakin Andone and Isabel Rosales, CNN\nAtmore, Alabama (CNN) — Alabama is poised to carry out the first known execution using nitrogen gas Thursday to put Kenneth Smith to death for his role in a 1988 murder for hire.\nSmith, who survived the state’s initial attempt to execute him by lethal injection in 2022, is tentatively set to die Thursday evening as the state endeavors to use a wholly new method of execution some experts are concerned could cause him to experience excessive pain or a torturous death.\nLittle is known about how the method, known as nitrogen hypoxia , will be carried out because the state’s published protocol bears redactions experts say shield key details from public scrutiny. The state, in court records, indicated the redactions were made to maintain security and it believes death by nitrogen gas to be “perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised.”\nBut Smith and his team are skeptical. “The eyes of the world are on this impending moral apocalypse,” the inmate and his spiritual adviser, the Rev. Jeff Hood, said midday Thursday in a joint statement. “Our prayer is that people will not turn their heads. We simply cannot normalize the suffocation of each other.”\nThe sons of the victim, Elizabeth Sennett, feel it’s time for Smith’s sentence to be carried out, telling CNN Thursday they believed their mother has been forgotten because of the new execution method.\n“It seems like a lot of the focus today is on Smith and his nitrogen, whatever, process,” Mike Sennett said. “And that’s kind of upset us a little bit.”\n“What’s going on is overshadowing what’s actually happened,” his brother, Chuck Sennett, said. “He’s gotta pay the price for what he done to our mother,” who should be remembered “as a loving, caring woman.” The two brothers were in their 20s when their mother was killed.\nThe US Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to intervene in Smith’s case after his attorneys tried to argue a second execution attempt would violate the US Constitution’s protection against cruel and unusual punishment.\nA separate federal appeals court ruling on Wednesday evening also declined to halt the execution ? . Smith’s team again Thursday morning appealed to the Supreme Court and requested a stay of execution.\nState officials on Wednesday welcomed the high court’s rejection of Smith’s earlier request, framing it as an “attempt to bar the State from executing him by any method at all,” Attorney General Steve Marshall said in a statement.",

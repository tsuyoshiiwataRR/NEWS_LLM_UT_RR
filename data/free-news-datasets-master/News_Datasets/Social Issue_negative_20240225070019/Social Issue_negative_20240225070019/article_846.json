    "text": "Scientists at the University of Tennesee in Knoxville said the recent unprecedented mega-drought in the West is caused by humans. The study, published in the journal Science Advances, claims the severity of droughts has increased due to human-caused climate change. \"What we’re seeing is that megadrought conditions are amplified by anthropogenically driven (human-caused) temperature increases,\" said Karen King, assistant professor at the University of Tennessee. Researchers used tree ring data, which focuses on how a tree was impacted by sunlight, rainfall & temperature because it serves as a time capsule. King explained, “More dense rings mean warmer temperatures and less dense rings mean cooler temperatures, typically.\" One study found that the last twenty years have been the driest in 1,200 years and that human activity made the years-long dry spell 72% worse. Having analyzed the data, King concluded that maximum temperatures of the past two decades have been the hottest on record since 1553. King and co. gathered data from trees around the Pacific Northwest, including parts of Utah, Arizona and Colorado. The temperature has seen the water supply take a hit, with the Ogallala aquifer, which supports 25% of the region’s agriculture, most affected. King said, “It paints a cohesive picture that this anthropogenic influence on hot drought is unprecedented over the last several centuries.\" More stories from [Unbranded](/@Unbranded2023) Join the flipboard community Discover, collect, and share stories for all your interests [Sign up](/signup) More stories from [Climate Change](/topic/climatechange) [New satellite images catch world’s worst polluters red-handed: ‘Now we really know exactly where it’s coming from’](/topic/climatechange/new-satellite-images-catch-world-s-worst-polluters-red-handed-now-we-really-kn/a-d5DQxokjS5uQ9s0JZDp4HQ%3Aa%3A3804460-9bbbe93fa9%2Fthecooldown.com) The world’s 1,300 largest methane-polluting sites have been identified from space, thanks to an endeavor by environmental intelligence company … [Solid-State EV Batteries Now Face “Production Hell”](/topic/climatechange/solid-state-ev-batteries-now-face-production-hell/a-6AfvYIlLSOGw5nqqK-WleA%3Aa%3A48258285-cedbc4cf4a%2Fieee.org) Recent solid-state battery announcements by Volkswagen and QuantumScape are raising hopes in the electric vehicle market, but automotive battery … [The Hartford Insurance says it will stop writing new homeowners' policies](/topic/climatechange/the-hartford-insurance-says-it-will-stop-writing-new-homeowners-policies/a-3xFm6eX-T7iopMb8o0lMoA%3Aa%3A235854985-ed1942e84a%2Fcbsnews.com) The Hartford Insurance is the latest company to say it will stop writing new homeowners' policies in California starting Feb. 1.

    "text": "PASCO COUNTY, Fla. – The Pasco Sheriff’s Office has seen an increase in reports of warrant scams and wants to warn the community. “We stress that these messages are not legitimate. PSO will never discuss warrants over the phone, and we will never request payment in any form to clear them,” said PSO in a social post. As part of these warrant scams, a person will usually receive a phone call from someone claiming to be a sheriff, police officer, bounty hunter, or lawyer. This caller usually informs the recipient of a warrant for their arrest.

Frequently, the caller claims that the arrest warrant was issued because they failed to pay a debt, missed jury duty, or committed another minor infraction. The caller states that a fine is due and that the warrant will be executed if not paid in full. The call recipient will typically be asked to wire money or purchase a prepaid card and send it to the caller’s address. One variation of the warrant scam is when the caller claims that the recipient of the call is wanted for hacking into a business’s computer system. The caller demands payment over the telephone.

The caller may request payment over the phone, via wire transfer, or with a pre-paid debit card. Warning Signs There are several red flags that can alert people to a possible scam of this type. Police rarely call individuals to inform them that they have a warrant for their arrest. Instead, police will most likely arrive in person to arrest the suspect. If the debt is valid, the recipient will usually receive a certified letter informing them of the legal action being taken. Another potential indicator that people are being scammed in this way is when they are asked for payment on a debt they do not recognize, refuse to provide the company name for the debt that is alleged to be owed, refuse to provide contact information, or refuse to provide the notice in writing.

    "text": "As of: January 25, 2024, 10:47 p.m\nComments\nPress\nSplit\nAccording to experts, Riester and Rürup contracts almost never produce the promised returns.\nIn addition, customers usually face much higher costs than initially stated.\nMunich – Private pension provision is important, but state-funded Riester pensions have become a slow seller.\nThe citizens' movement Finanzwende explains why this is understandable.\nIn a study, she calculated the likely returns of 111 Riester and Rürup offers available in the previous year.\n“The findings are bleak and no glory for insurers,” says Britta Langenberg from Finanzwende.\nNot a single Riester offer covers inflation compensation\nThe benchmark was to achieve inflation compensation of an average of two percent annually over the entire contract period from signature to death.\nOf the 22 Riester pensions examined, none would create an offer.\nWith 89 Rürup contracts, two would mathematically get over the hurdle.\nOn average for all Riester pensions, the study came to a meager 0.8 percent term yield and 1.0 percent for Rürup contracts.\nThis does not result in real customer benefit, as the financial regulator Bafin only warned in May 2023.\n“No customer wants to lose money,” emphasizes the consumer advocate.\nBut according to the study, that's exactly what happens in reality.\nHowever, Finanzwende did not calculate any state subsidies that, for example, Riester savers receive for children.\nLangenberg admitted that if you have a lot of children, the returns that can be achieved increase significantly.\nTax effects were also not taken into account.\n“In the savings phase before retirement, high costs in particular prevent a better return, while in the retirement period, from the consumer's point of view, there are unfavorable assumptions about life expectancy,” summarizes actuary Axel Kleinlein.\nEnjoying your retirement without a care in the world – that’s how everyone would like to imagine their retirement.\nUnfortunately, the reality is very different for many people.\n(Symbolic photo) © Imago\nHe has calculated for a financial turnaround and says that insurers are calculating with unrealistically high life expectancies.\nIn order to achieve the two percent target return, insured people would have to live to an average of 99 years and Rürup insured people would have to live to 100 years.\nThe calculations are also complicated and characterized by assumptions, says Kleinlein.\n“In individual cases, you only know the return on annuities when the customer has died,” he clarifies.\nBut in several places in the study he made assumptions that would result in higher returns.\nReforming the Riester pension is no longer worthwhile\nAt the same time, the experienced actuary criticized the information that insurers give their customers when concluding contracts.\nThe information sheets are difficult to understand, especially when it comes to costs.\n“Real comparability between individual offers is therefore not possible,” says the expert.\nIn one extreme case, he calculated true costs that were 4.5 percent higher than those shown by the insurer in the model calculation.\n“These are sad results,” criticizes Kleinlein and sees system errors primarily as responsible for meager returns.\nMy news\nTable shows when pensioners have to pay taxes read\nImportant post for pensioners: What the new letter from the pension insurance means read\nGDL rail strike: What “Mr. Weselsky likes to keep quiet” read\nHeil announces a pension package and defends himself against criticism: “There is no pension at 63 anymore” read\nRevolt at Skoda Germany: Read “False self-representation at the expense of the customer”.\nPension increase in 2024: This is what the pension will look like after reading out 3.5 percent\n“Riester and Rürup can no longer be saved,” he says.\nLangenberg only emphasizes this for Riester pensions.\nBoth are skeptical about ongoing attempts by politicians to save the system.\n(tmh)",

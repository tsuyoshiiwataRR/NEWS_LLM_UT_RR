    "text": "The death of a New York City professional dancer who died after eating mislabeled cookies sold at a supermarket chain in the northeastern United States was 'devastating and preventable,' a family lawyer said Thursday. Orla Baxendale, 25, of Manhattan, died Jan. 11 of anaphylactic shock after a severe allergic reaction to a cookie manufactured by Cookies United and sold by Stew Leonard's, according to a statement obtained by USA TODAY from the New York City-based law firm. The firm of Geyer, Geyer, Conason, Rubinowitz, Bloom, Hershenhorn, Steigman & Mackoff. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Norwalk, Connecticut-based Stew Leonard's recently recalled Vanilla Florentine Cookies sold at Stew Leonard's in Danbury and Newington, Connecticut, with dates from November 6 to December 31, 2023. informed of. The cookies contained peanuts that were not listed as part of the ingredients, the law firm wrote. Baxendale's death was caused by the “gross negligence and reckless conduct” of the manufacturer and sellers, who failed to properly identify the cookie's contents on the packaging,” the firm's attorney Marijo C. Ademi told USA TODAY via email. “This failure to make appropriate disclosures led to this devastating but preventable outcome,” Adeyemi wrote. “Instead of standing up and taking full responsibility, as the public would have expected him to do, Stu Leonard engaged in a public relations media campaign.” Baxendale, originally from East Lancashire in the United Kingdom, moved to New York to pursue her dream of becoming a world-class dancer, Adeyemi said. Vehicle Recall:Kia recalls more than 100,000 vehicles due to roof problem: Here's which models are affected What cookies with peanuts did you remember? According to a recall statement released Tuesday, the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection Food, Standards and Product Safety Division (DCP) reported that one death has been reported so far in connection with the recalled cookies. According to DCP, Baxendale allegedly ate the cookies at a social function in Connecticut, and the mislabeled products – Florentine cookies with a best-by date of January 5, 2024 – were made at a bakery in Islip, New York. According to the statement, the cookies contain peanuts and the manufacturer has not disclosed this ingredient to Stew Leonard's. Adeyemi said, “Orla was very careful and cautious about what she ate and always checked the ingredients thoroughly on all packaging.” Additionally, the attorney said, when she saw the cookies and began having an anaphylactic reaction, an Epi pen was used, but “due to the severity of her allergies, it was not effective.” Latest product recalls;Robitussin cough syrup recalled nationwide due to microbial contamination 500 affected packages “This is a sad day for us. We learned that a customer was suffering from a peanut allergy who purchased a cookie here,” Stu Leonard Jr., president of the supermarket chain, said in a video statement posted on its website. Stew Leonard's Jr. said the company purchased the now-recalled holiday cookies from an outside supplier and that Stew Leonard's sold about 500 affected packages during the holidays. 'Unfortunately, the supplier changed the recipe and switched from soy nuts to peanuts and our company's Chief Safety Officer was never informed. We take labeling very seriously, especially when it comes to peanuts.” 'We are in compliance' USA Today, in a statement released Thursday, Walker G., an attorney for Cookies United. Flannery III called the woman's death tragic and expressed his condolences to the family of “this Stew Leonard's customer.” The statement continues, “Stew Leonard's claimed in a prior press release that 'the cookies contained peanuts,' an ingredient not disclosed by the manufacturer to Stew Leonard's.” “Unfortunately, given the tragedy of these circumstances, we need to point out that Stew Leonard's was informed by Cookies United in July 2023 that this product now contains peanuts and all products shipped to them will be labeled accordingly. This product is sold under the Stew Leonard's brand and repackaged at their facilities. The false label was created and applied by Stew Leonard's to their product.” The statement said Cookies United is cooperating with the New York State Department of Agriculture and has been informed that “we are complying with all applicable rules and regulations related to this product.” Baxendale is known for his 'peculiar character and boundless love' Baxendale is described in her obituary as a bright soul and woman of many talents, whose “charisma and vibrant spirit came to life through her work” with the Alvin Ailey School, Step on Broadway, Club Pilates and others. According to the obituary, she was known for her “quirky character and immense love for those around her… She was an excellent ballerina, contemporary and Irish step dancer.” “Each endeavor he undertook became a testament to his dedication and passion, which left a lasting impact on the lives of many people.” Natalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

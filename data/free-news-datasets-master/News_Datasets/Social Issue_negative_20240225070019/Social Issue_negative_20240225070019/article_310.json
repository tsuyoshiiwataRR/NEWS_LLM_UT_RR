    "text": "') > -1) { addClass($('.section-container'), 'pill-tag'); } Cristiano Ronaldo reportedly unhappy with China organizers Cristiano Ronaldo is unhappy with the organizers of the China Tour he went on with Al-Nassr, as per China News Weekly (via Shine). Al Nassr reported on January 19 that the star player was injured.\nRecent reports suggest that organizers SPORT17 and GHY Culture & Media, despite knowing about Ronaldo's injury, continued to claim that he would play in the friendlies. They also allegedly attempted to persuade him to play on a public occasion.\nThe organizers reportedly broadcasted that Ronaldo would feature in both games when Al-Nassr arrived at Shenzhen Airport. They ruled out his injury concerns as pain during regular training.\nFinally, on Tuesday night, January 23, one day before the game against Shanghai Shenhua, it was announced by the organizers that the tour would be postponed. Ronaldo has now reportedly expressed his grievances on this development.\nAn insider, working at GHY Culture & Media, has suggested that the organizers may have used this as a strategy to boost ticket sales. The person claimed (via Shine):\n\"The schedule of Al-Nassr's China tour was finalized last year and the promotion surrounding Ronaldo was also released early. But if the organizer publicly said that Ronaldo could not play before the game, who would buy tickets?\"",

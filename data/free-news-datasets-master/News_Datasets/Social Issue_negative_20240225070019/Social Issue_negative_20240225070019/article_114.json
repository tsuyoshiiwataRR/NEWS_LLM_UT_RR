    "text": "‘A wide range of media requests’: Backlash continues over Danielle Smith’s Tucker Carlson sit-down\nPosted Jan 25, 2024 02:39:19 PM.\nLast Updated Jan 25, 2024 02:54:01 PM.\nPremier Danielle Smith is taking more heat for appearing with right-wing former FOX News host Tucker Carlson during his visit to Alberta on Wednesday.\nSmith was asked about it at a news conference Thursday morning.\n“I take a wide range of media requests. I’ve done — I’m told by my staff — 96 individual media events or interviews since I got re-elected, 24 press conferences,” the premier, who succeeded Jason Kenney in October 2022, said. “I don’t require, I don’t do a screening test that every person that interviews me matches 100 per cent of what I believe and I don’t expect that that would be an appropriate thing to do.”\nSmith says that includes alternative media because her job is to get the message out about Alberta.\nA packed house in Edmonton, Alberta to witness free debate, thought, and expression. We need more of this from all sides!\nThank you to\n[@ConradMBlack], [@jordanbpeterson], and [@TuckerCarlson]for coming. [pic.twitter.com/bggNYMmvrE]\n— Danielle Smith (@ABDanielleSmith)\n[January 25, 2024]\nThursday in Ottawa, Liberal MPs criticized her for the conversation.\n“For Danielle Smith to bring the mouthpiece of the mega Conservative far right to Edmonton Centre to spew hate about LGBTQ2 people is beyond the pale, it’s deplorable and we won’t stand for it,” said Randy Boissonnault, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages.\nCanada’s Environment Minister said he felt personally attacked by Carlson, and that his words could inspire others to violence.\n“That I was targeted last night at this event, this increases political violence against everyone who runs for office in this country,” said Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change.\nAlberta’s NDP leader is also not a fan of the meeting.\n“What in heaven’s name is the premier of Alberta doing sitting next to the person,” said Rachel Notley.\nShe says by appearing with Carlson she’s sending out a bad message about Alberta to the world, and as premier, Smith has an obligation to make it clear what she doesn’t agree with.\n“I mean, just a few days ago, this guy suggested that the U.S. should stop funding the defense of Ukraine and instead consider invading Canada, and then he made a point of saying, ‘I’m not joking, I’m serious,'” Notley said.\nREAD MORE:\nTucker Carlson draws thousands in Calgary, speaks with Alberta premier\nCalling it ridiculous, the leader of the Opposition says she wants to know what the premier of Alberta is doing next to him, and just saying that she doesn’t agree with everything he says.\nSmith says the appearance was about getting Alberta’s message out to the world.\n“I take a wide-range of interviews from CBC all the way through to alternative media because my job is to get our message out about Alberta,” she said. “I told everyone that I wanted to make sure somebody who has a very loud voice in America knew that we were a partner in being able to provide energy security and energy affordability, and I got that message out.”\n-With files from Adam Ziccarelli",

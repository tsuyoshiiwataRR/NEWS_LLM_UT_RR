    "text": "DOUGLAS COUNTY, Ga. â€” A mom now [charged with murder in Douglasville](/article/news/crime/douglasville-3-year-old-dies-mom-charged-murder-spending-hours-freezing-woods-with-children/85-2a6a7c89-a75c-45db-b94a-f5cb3e21568a) after her 3-year-old died after a night in the woods in the freezing cold had a prior child cruelty case, records show. The Douglas County Sheriff's Office [said Wednesday](/article/news/crime/douglasville-3-year-old-dies-mom-charged-murder-spending-hours-freezing-woods-with-children/85-2a6a7c89-a75c-45db-b94a-f5cb3e21568a) that Uriha Ridge was facing murder charges after she was found in the woods earlier this month with her two small children far from the Fox Hall Resort, a hotel they had been staying at. Deputies said the children were \"soaking wet\" and the temperatures had been below freezing throughout the entire night. Ridge and her two children were rushed to the hospital, and at some point thereafter, her 3-year-old died from what deputies said was exposure to the conditions.

In that instance, according to arrest warrants, she punched her older child -- who survived the freezing overnight conditions -- and was accused of \"grabbing (him) by the neck and dragging (him) from one area of the business to another\" and \"slapping (him) multiple times in the face with an open hand.\" RELATED: [Deputies: 3-year-old dies in Douglasville woods, mom charged with murder after allegedly spending night with children in sub-freezing temps](/article/news/crime/douglasville-3-year-old-dies-mom-charged-murder-spending-hours-freezing-woods-with-children/85-2a6a7c89-a75c-45db-b94a-f5cb3e21568a) The warrants further alleged Ridge had dropped her now-deceased younger child \"from shoulder level while being heavily intoxicated.\" Ridge was also accused in that incident of generally \"yelling at children and using curse words around families\" at the business. Ridge was granted a $5,000 bond in that case in November 2022. The investigation into the freezing incident alleged that Ridge had taken drugs before going out to the woods with her children and during the time in the woods. Ridge allegedly left the resort hotel off Capps Ferry Road in Douglasville around midnight on Jan. 16 and did not call for help until 11:51 a.m. the same morning -- nearly a full 12 hours later. Deputies said they believe that the drugs Ridge was on are responsible for her taking her 3-year-old and 7-year-old children into the woods, dressed in thin clothes and staying out in the woods in the rain and sub-freezing temperatures for hours before her toddler died and the young child was hospitalized. Ridge is being held at the Douglas County Jail without bond on the following charges: - Felony murder - Two counts of first-degree cruelty to children - Two counts of second-degree cruelty to children",

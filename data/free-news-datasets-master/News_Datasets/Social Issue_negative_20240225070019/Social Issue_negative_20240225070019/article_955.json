    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - A Kansas City man was sentenced in federal court Thursday for his role in a sex trafficking conspiracy that involved four victims, including two teenagers.\nThe man, 30-year-old Dameon Devor Williams was sentenced to 16 years in federal prison without parole. He was also sentenced to 20 years of supervised release following incarceration.\nWilliams pleaded guilty on June 29, 2023, to one count of conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking and one count of sex trafficking.\nHe admitted in court documents that he participated in a sex-trafficking conspiracy from August 2018 until January 2019 that caused four victims to engage in prostitution with one of the victims being 14 years old and another victim being 16 years old.\nOn Jan. 7, 2019, Homeland Security Investigations agents in Kansas City received a tip about a 14-year-old female who was missing. The girl had previously been apprehended in Blue Springs after a crash involving a stolen vehicle. When the girl was taken to Children’s Mercy Hospital she reported that she’d been forced to have sex for money.\nWith that report, the hospital took her personal belongings and gave them to federal agents. The agents used the phone to identify a 16-year-old girl a couple days later in Jackson, Mississippi.\nCourt documents said that victim helped police locate the first victim at a residence in Kansas City, Mo.\nAgents set up surveillance at a Kansas City apartment building and later located and arrested co-defendant Cory Lavell Smith. One of the victims said Smith groomed her into the commercial sex trade and that Williams also set up transactions. Court documents said Smith and Williams split the money earned from the transactions.\nSmith pleaded guilty to the same charges and was sentenced on Nov. 1, 2022, to 18 years in federal prison without parole.\nCopyright 2024 KCTV.

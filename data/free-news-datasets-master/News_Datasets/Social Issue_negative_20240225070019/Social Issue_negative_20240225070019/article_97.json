According to the [report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7303a2.htm?s_cid=mm7303a2_w), up to 80% of eligible patients are not offered [Paxlovid](https://themessenger.com/health/paxlovid-viral-rebound-one-in-five), a COVID-19 antiviral manufactured by Pfizer and authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at the end of 2021. These results are reminiscent of prior estimates from the CDC indicating that Paxlovid use among the adult population has been less than 35% since the drug was approved. When Paxlovid first hit the market, experts were optimistic about the [antiviral’s potential](https://themessenger.com/health/flu-antiviral-shortage-treating-flu-at-home-tamiflu-flu-shot) to blunt the impact of COVID-19 in patients who are particularly vulnerable to the virus. President Joe Biden made it the center of his COVID response, launching the “test-to-treat” initiative and speaking its praises at the 2022 State of the Union address. When administered within five days of symptom onset, the antiviral is said to reduce the risk of hospitalization by as much as 51%, according to clinical trial results. Despite Paxlovid’s known benefits, “its utilization has been considerably lower than expected,” the CDC writes. The CDC’s report indicates that nearly half of providers involved in the study didn’t offer their [COVID patients](https://themessenger.com/search?s=covid) Paxlovid because they had only mild symptoms; 23% did not prescribe it because their patients were outside of the standard five day symptom window, while another 23% said their patients lacked symptoms. Around 6% were concerned about drug interactions.

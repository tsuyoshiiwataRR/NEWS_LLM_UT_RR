    "text": "Yesterday, Congressman Darrell Issa (CA-48) spoke out against a proposal by the University of California school system to allow undocumented students to work at UC schools.\nThe proposal, highlighted in a CBS Los Angeles article , comes in response to the repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in 2021 and would make undocumented students the exception to federal law that prohibits people without immigration status from legally working.\nRep. Issa gave the following statement in opposition to the proposal:\n“140 years ago, the University of California proudly declared that its motto would be Fiat Lux — ‘Let there be light’ — and it was soon to become America’s leading university system. What a dark day it will be if it yields to a pressure campaign, denied clear Supreme Court rulings, and opts to pick and choose which federal laws to follow and which to simply ignore.\"\nRep. Issa was the first to object to this proposal, writing a letter to Governor Newsom in May of last year expressing concerns over the proposal’s violation of the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. This letter was highlighted in an article from Fox News .\nIssues : Oversight and Accountability",

    "text": "Re “San Diego has a plan to woo back scooter companies” (Jan. 20): Anyone walking on the sidewalks in Downtown San Diego feels much safer since the electric scooters have disappeared. Walking became a dangerous sport when scooters were zipping by at high speeds with no regards to pedestrians. Furthermore, people were leaving scooters strewn all over, which became a menace for people with disabilities, especially the blind. Regarding helping with the city’s climate action plan, this is a complete joke. No one is using the scooters for trips that would amount to much, if any, pollution. If there is that much concern for air quality, the city would look into why we run numerous large buses through Downtown that are either empty or contain just a few riders. The city’s air quality would benefit from more increased bus ridership than the dangerous situation brought on by the electric scooters. Adrian Fremont Marina District",

    "text": "Billboard Chris sparked controversy this week when he posted an image of a gay couple cradling the newborn they allegedly obtained via [surrogacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNtJza7xDwY). \"They bought a baby who will never have her mom,\" he posted with the photo. \"You've lost a part of your soul if you think this is okay.\" After more than 10 million views, the post was reported for violating rules against private media and Chris was instructed to \"remove\" the tweet. Instead he appealed—and lost. The post had over 15,000 comments, and the image had been posted from an Instagram account. Chris said he would not delete the tweet. \"A lot of people tweeted it but they're not locked out,\" Chris told The Post Millennial. \"I upset a lot of gay people with my comment,\" he said. \"It's not anti-gay. It's pro-child, and many don't want to try to understand that.\" There has been a push among some LGBTQ+ groups to make the costs associated with surrogacy covered by health insurance. The argument is that since IVF is covered, surrogacy, which requires IVF treatments for the women undertaking the pregnancy of a child they will not mother, should also be covered as part of fertility treatment. [California](https://thepostmillennial.com/california-moves-to-provide-surrogates-to-gay-male-couples-in-the-name-of-fertility-equality)has already moved in that direction. The appeal was rejected, with X saying, \"Violating our rules against posing private media of an individual from a country with a recognized right to privacy law.\" The post is still up on other accounts. The photo was originally posted by an account called @narstar3, but was no longer available on that account after it was found to violate rules. There are countless Instagram accounts featuring gay dads and their surrogacy-obtained children. Accounts @MichaelAndMatt, @TwoMenAndASurrogacy, @2Dads2Twins_, are just a few. Articles have been written about how to \"find your Instagram Tribe\" with links to accounts for \"two dad families\", or \"Insta-dads: The Complete Guide to Gay Dads on Instagram.\" There are also accounts for men who have obtained children through surrogacy and are \"single dads by choice.\" Some of the dads have styled themselves as gay \"dad influencers\" who post pics of their kids and families from that special moment in the hospital when they take the baby from the birth mother, posing with the child on their chests, up through childhood. @2_Dallas_Dads, @Fontes_Four_Pack, @2Daddies2Babies, and @MyDosDads are a few of these. The practice of renting women and selling the children they carry has become controversial in recent years as the surrogacy industry, just a small part of the reproductive services industry, has blossomed and there are few legal constraints in the US to protect either mother or child during the 9+ months long transaction. In many European countries, like France, surrogacy is illegal, leading French gay dads to travel to the US to rent gestational bodies for the purpose of purchasing the offspring.

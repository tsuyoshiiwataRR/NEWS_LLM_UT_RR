    "text": "ALBANY, N.Y. (TND) — Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday blasted his Democratic colleagues over their handling of the ongoing migrant crisis. Writing an op-ed in The Hill, Cuomo likened the Democrats’ current strategy to that of a failing NFL team. We’re in the middle of the NFL playoffs, leading to the Super Bowl. Winning teams focus on perfecting their strategy — they do not rely on the hope that the other team loses,” Cuomo [wrote]. “Today, Democrats are too reliant on Trump being unelectable rather than focusing on the positive case for their victory.” He continued, highlighting the migrant crisis as an example of the “ineffectiveness” of Democratic leaders. “For example, the migrant issue is creating mayhem across the country and showing the ineffectiveness and schisms in the Democratic Party,” Cuomo wrote. “President Joe Biden’s administration has not been able to solve the migrant problem, primarily because of the divided opinion within our own party. The Republican ploy of putting migrants on buses to blue cities only serves to highlight the Democrats’ failure to anticipate the consequences of Biden’s border policies and continuing failure to fashion a workable solution.” READ MORE | [ Migrant stole $10K worth of merchandise from Chicago-area Macy's, prosecutors say](https://thenationaldesk.com/news/americas-news-now/migrant-stole-10k-worth-of-merchandise-from-chicago-area-macys-prosecutors-say-illegal-immigrant-10000-money-stolen-crome-southern-border-sanctuary-city-venezuela-chile-dupage-county?fbclid=IwAR3O6HofnNL2Vme6jMtRQGAF6B8YxXEuBZft8N_KsFzaUQLDKZxbXgJ7g6k) The party, Cuomo said, suffers from a “lack of logic” in its approach to such a critical issue. “The lack of logic, practicality, sustainability and fairness in managing the migrant issue is obvious to all. The president, governor and mayor are all blamed by the public for the obvious failure. It must be resolved,” Cuomo wrote. “We have learned this lesson before: Ignoring a problem, no matter how difficult, only makes it worse. Before we can expect the American people to believe in the Democratic agenda, we must have a defined Democratic agenda.” Just because Donald Trump is mired in legal troubles, Cuomo closed, does not mean Democrats have a pass to do as they please between now and November. “Donald Trump cannot win the election, but Democrats can lose the election,” he said. “We cannot wager that citizens will vote against Trump, but rather give them a reason to vote for Democrats. We must make the positive case for a Democratic future — the negative case against Trump makes itself.” Cuomo resigned from his position as New York governor in 2021 after a series of sexual harassment allegations.",

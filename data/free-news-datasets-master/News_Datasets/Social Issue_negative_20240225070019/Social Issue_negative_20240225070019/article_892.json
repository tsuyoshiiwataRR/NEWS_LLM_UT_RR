    "text": "Assembly Republicans approve 14-week abortion ban referendum\nMADISON, Wis. (CBS 58) -- Republican lawmakers in the state Assembly have passed legislation that seeks to implement a 14-week abortion ban.\nThe\nproposal would ask voters whether the state's current abortion ban after 20 weeks of pregnancy should be 14 weeks. If approved, a statewide referendum would be placed on the April ballot asking voters if the 14-week prohibition should take effect.\nIt passed the Assembly 53-46 with handful of Republicans joining Democrats voting against the bill.\nEarlier this week, the bill was\namended to add exceptions for rape and incest after widespread criticism from Democrats and some pro-life groups.\nAnother amendment includes adding exceptions for doctors to \"make reasonable efforts\" to preserve the life of the mother during a medical emergency.\nGov. Tony Evers has vowed to veto the measure. During his State of the State Address, Evers said he will continue to reject efforts that further restrict abortion access.\nDuring debate on the bill Thursday, Republicans argued voters should decide this issue.\n\"I've heard more times that I care to count from the Governor, the will of the people is the law of the land,\" said Rep. Joel Kitchens (R-Sturgeon Bay). \"Well, put your money where your mouth is. Let's have the people decide on this.\"\nDemocrats argued the bill is another political attack on women's reproductive rights.\n\"You are taking away reproductive health care choices,\" said Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison). \"Abortion is health care no matter how you slice it.\"\nThe measure now heads to the Senate where the bill's fate is uncertain. Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) has signaled he doesn't want his caucus to go through a\n\"tough\" vote on abortion bills if Evers is ultimately going to veto them.",

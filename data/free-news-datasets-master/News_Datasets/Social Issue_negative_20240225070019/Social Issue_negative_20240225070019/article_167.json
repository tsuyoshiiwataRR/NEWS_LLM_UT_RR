    "text": "[Updated to include suggested additions to list. Thanks, everyone, for the suggestions and the kind remarks!] My son gets too much non-information from youtube videos, including repeated claims that Biden “hasn’t really done anything”. I promised I would provide him a list of Biden’s accomplishments so far. Using whitehouse.gov and DailyKos’s Good News Roundup — ”Boosting Biden” series, I made a bullet list of achievements. I also wanted something I could cut and paste if I read the same claim on social media. (You’re free to use, as well.) Let me know if I got anything wrong, or if I missed anything: Through Executive Orders, executive and administrative actions, and bipartisan legislation, Biden's accomplishments include: Economy/Employment Over the past two years, inflation reduced by two-thirds while unemployment kept low and economy grew by 3% Avoided recession Two of the strongest years of job growth in history Nearly 11 million jobs created since 2021 Created more manufacturing jobs in 2022 than in any single year in nearly 30 years 3.5% unemployment rate — the lowest in 50 years 750,000 new manufacturing jobs Near record low unemployment rate for Hispanics Near record low unemployment rate for African-Americans Record low unemployment rate for people with disabilities Awarded the most ever federal contracting dollars to small businesses and disadvantaged small businesses Incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act have spurred companies to spend nearly $300 billion on investments in manufacturing As a result of the CHIPS and Science Act, which provides incentives for domestic manufacture of technology, in just one year, U.S. companies have announced $166 billion in investments in semiconductors and electronics. This will provide American jobs, decrease reliance on foreign manufacturing of critical technologies, and position the US to lead future scientific innovations. Creating “workplace hubs” to provide training, re-training, technical education, and apprenticeships in emerging technology and manufacturing Increased funding to the IRS to enable audits of high-income taxpayers, resulting in the recovery of over $160 million in back taxes owed by millionaires and billionaires Cost Of Living Executive Orders and releases of strategic oil reserves resulted in gas prices more than $1.60 lower than their summer 2022 peak $15 minimum wage for Federal workers and contractors Over 100 actions to lower household energy costs by $100 per year Over 16 million households receiving lower cost or free high-speed internet through the Affordable Connectivity Program Commitments from 20 leading internet providers to increase speeds and cut prices Inflation reduced by two thirds from its 2022 high HealthCare & Costs Millions of Americans are saving $800 per year on health insurance coverage Four out of five people can buy health insurance on healthcare.gov for $10/month or less Health insurance coverage rates increased by 50% since January 2021 More people with health insurance – 92% insured is the highest in history Lowered Medicare recipients’ health care expenses, including by capping out of pocket expenses on prescription drugs at $2,000 per year, capping insulin costs at $35/month, and providing free vaccines Lowered the cost of hearing aids by making them available over the counter $37 billion in funding for senior and disability services, including community based services Improvements to veterans' health care, particularly for veterans exposed to harmful chemicals Advanced research on cancer and other diseases through the ARPA-H initiative “Cancer Moonshot” with the goal of cutting the cancer death rate by at least half over the next 25 years Hosted White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health;

The withdrawal process was not without mistakes, but a perfect withdrawal would have extended U.S. involvement in a mission that no longer had purpose. “I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not going to extend a forever exit,” said President Biden. Significant action to curb Chinese threats to U.S. national security and economic interests, including increased restrictions on China’s access to U.S. advanced technology and hosting the first trilateral summit with South Korea, Japan and the United States, while also working to improve communications between the U.S. and China.

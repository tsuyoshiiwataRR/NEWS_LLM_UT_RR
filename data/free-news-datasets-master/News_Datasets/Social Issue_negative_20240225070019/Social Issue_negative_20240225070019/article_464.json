    "text": "ALBANY, Ore. – A woman who allegedly shot her boyfriend in the head during a domestic incident was arrested and jailed early on Thursday morning, according to the Albany Police Department. Albany police officials said they responded at about 2:13 a.m. on January 25 to a 911 call in the 600 block of 34th Avenue SE. The 911 caller told police that his roommate’s girlfriend, identified as Hami W. Lee, 24, shot his roommate in the head, authorities said. Police said that responding police officers arrived and found a victim with a gunshot wound near the front door of the home. First responders with the Albany Fire Department arrived and performed life-saving measures before the victim, identified as a 30-year-old Albany man, was transported to Good Samaritan Medical Center in Corvallis, authorities said. Police said Lee was cooperative with investigators at the scene and was later arrested and taken into custody. Lee faces charges of second-degree assault, menacing, and unlawful use of a weapon, police said. Albany police officials ask anyone with information related to this incident contact the Albany Police Department’s detective unit at 541-917-7688 and reference case number 24-00473.",

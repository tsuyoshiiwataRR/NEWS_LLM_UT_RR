    "text": "Due to problems with the testing system, more than 40% of local governments in Tokyo have not been able to use the ``class guidance,'' in which children with developmental disabilities learn how to overcome difficulties in learning and daily life at school, for a few months. I understand that there is a delay. Some children are refusing to go to school, and experts say, ``We need to urgently improve support.'' The number of children who may have developmental disabilities is increasing year by year, and is estimated to account for 8.8% of children in elementary and junior high schools nationwide, or about 1 in 11 children. As a form of special needs education for these children, the government is calling for the enhancement of \"interclass instruction,\" in which children are moved to a different classroom several times a week to learn how to overcome difficulties in learning and life. I am. NHK conducted a survey of all 62 local governments in Tokyo regarding the current situation, and received responses from 56 local governments. Of these, 24 local governments, more than 40% of the total, answered that it would take several months to use the system due to problems with the testing system, which is a condition of \"passing guidance\" in Tokyo. Local governments have made comments such as, ``We test almost every day, but the waiting list for reservations is three months,'' and ``It takes about four months to get tested, and it can take up to six months to use the service.'' Additionally, seven local governments responded that it would take several months to use the service due to chronic teacher shortages. Experts point out that, ``Even if support is delayed for a few months, some children will have trouble with their relationships at school and stop attending school.The government should enhance support.'' Expert: “It is important to enhance support” Regarding the results of this survey, Hirohito Ozeki, president of the National Association of Heads of Schools with Special Needs Classes and Day-to-Day Guidance Classes, said, ``If the timing of support is missed, failures in school life can lead to heartbreak, and interpersonal relationships can be very difficult.'' \"Some children develop secondary disabilities, such as not going to school or having difficulty leaving their rooms,\" he said. He also said, ``School life is a limited time for children, one month or one year, so it is important to create an environment where children can receive the education they need.'' I did. He added, ``Some developmental tests can be cleared with administrative budgetary measures, so it is important to enhance support.Also, with regard to the shortage of teachers, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology has announced that the number of applicants for classroom instruction increases in the middle of the academic year. We should allocate teachers based on the situation.\" Children waiting for regular instruction Mika (pseudonym), a 5th grade elementary school student living in Tokyo, is unable to take a test right away and is waiting for guidance. Although she is good at math and physical education, she is not good at reading and writing kanji, and she tends to have a learning disability, which is a type of developmental disorder. In his regular classes, when there were reading aloud and kanji tests in Japanese class, he was teased and told that he was a slow reader. Looking back, Mika's mother says, ``It would have been nice to have had support like, ``It will be easier if you write the pronunciation in your textbook,'' or ``If you don't know where you're reading, just draw a line.'' . Because of this, her mother contacted the local government to ask Mika to take advantage of day-to-day instruction starting in fifth grade, but she says the test date and time she wanted was fully booked. Since last summer, she has hardly been able to go to school and is unable to participate in club volleyball activities, which she loved. Mika said that she may not be able to go to school because she was traumatized by her slow reading ability.I hope she can go to school by the time she gets to the 6th grade. Ta. Her mother said, ``I think it's most important that people get support while they're still trying to do their best.If they wait, they'll give up, and it's a shame.'' .",

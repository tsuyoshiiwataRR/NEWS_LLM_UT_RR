State's Attorney's Office) © 2024 Blaze Media LLC. All rights reserved. 'Migrant criminal activity is a real problem,' police chief says after 6 charged for 2 heists from same Macy's on same day January 25, 2024 The police chief of Oak Brook, Illinois — a western suburb of Chicago — said that \"migrant criminal activity is a real problem\" after six people were charged with felony burglary and felony theft in connection with two separate incidents at a Macy's on Tuesday. What are the details? The DuPage County State's Attorney's Office on Wednesday [said](https://www.facebook.com/DuPageSAO/posts/pfbid033r6E4FZDvB6uKikGHNiZPYwbjRkGKDKwgqSpnAjV1kc4dPL5zK9SAdn9HCH5L8NRl) police responded around 1:45 p.m. to a call about retail theft at Macy’s in 1 Oakbrook Center. Officials said it's alleged that Elvis Rodriguez-Rubio, 28, Gabriela Salzar-Vasquez, 30, Victor Sevilla-Arteaga, 33, and Danielis Vasquez-Arteaga, 27 — all of Venezuela and all staying in Countryside — entered the store and went to the Tommy Hilfiger section where Vasquez-Arteaga and Salazar-Vasquez grabbed merchandise and took the items to the second floor. Officials said the two females grabbed shoes, entered a fitting room, and then exited the fitting room wearing the merchandise, after which the four individuals departed the Macy's without paying for the items that totaled almost $928. Officials said it's alleged that a loss prevention officer confronted them. Police just before 6:30 p.m. responded to another call of a retail theft at the same Macy's, officials said. Authorities said it's alleged that Nicolas Paillacan-Bravo, 20, and David Saez-Vega, 34 — both of Chile and staying in Chicago — entered the store, used a magnet to remove anti-theft devices from merchandise, and placed 54 items worth just over $10,000 into two suitcases they grabbed from the luggage department. Police officers confronted the pair after they exited the store, allegedly without paying for the items, officials said. Judge Joshua Dieden on Wednesday denied the state’s motion to detain all six defendants pre-trial, authorities said, adding that all six were charged with one count of felony burglary (Class 2) and one count of felony retail theft (Class 3). 'Migrant criminal activity is a real problem' Oak Brook Chief of Police Brian Strockis said he believes \"six felony arrests in one day illustrates that migrant criminal activity is a real problem\" and that the number of such arrests \"that we have had in the last couple of months is significant and would be taxing for any police department.\" DuPage County State’s Attorney Robert Berlin added that \"contrary to popular belief, retail theft is not a victimless crime\" and that it causes \"significant financial hardship to businesses and their employees, which results in higher prices for shoppers and loss of investment and tax revenue for entire communities.\" Like Blaze News?

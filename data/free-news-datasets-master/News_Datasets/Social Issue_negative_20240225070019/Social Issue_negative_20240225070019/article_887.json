    "text": "ELKO, Nev. (News 4 & Fox 11) â€” An investigation is underway after an officer involved shooting in Elko on Wednesday. Authorities say the incident began around 5 p.m. on Jan. 24 when an Elko Police officer heard a woman being struck in what has been determined to be a domestic violence incident. The officer tried to intervene, but the man, identified as James Ryan, pushed the woman from a vehicle. Authorities say he nearly struck the officer with his vehicle and a pursuit. According to Elko Police, Ryan pointed a rifle at responding officers and the Elko Combined SWAT team and the Elko Combined Crisis Negotiations Team were called. After several hours of negotiations, Ryan exited the vehicle with a rifle and pointed it at SWAT members, he was then shot and killed by members of SWAT. The involved officers have been placed on administrative leave. The shooting investigation team from Washoe County, Reno and Sparks are conducting the investigation. Elko Police say that when the investigation concludes the case will be forwarded to Elko County District Attorney's Office for review if any charges are warranted. An internal investigation will also be conducted to ensure that no policies and procedures were violated.",

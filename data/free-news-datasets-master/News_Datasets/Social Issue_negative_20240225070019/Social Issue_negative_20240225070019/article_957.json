    "text": "New bill prevents children under 16 from having social media accounts TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCJB) - One day after the House overwhelmingly passed the bill, Senate President Kathleen Passidomo on Thursday backed a proposal that seeks to prevent children under age 16 from having social media accounts and said the Senate will start moving forward with it. The House on Wednesday voted 106 to 13 to pass the bill, with supporters saying social media harms children’s mental health and can be used by sexual predators to communicate with children. Opponents argue the bill is unconstitutional and that parents should decide whether children use social media. It was not immediately clear Thursday when Senate committees would take up the issue, but Passidomo says the bill will be heard. “We are going to take up the bill. I don’t know if members are going to suggest proposed changes. If they do, I’m certainly going to discuss it with the speaker. It’s his initiative, and I support it fully,” said State Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, R- Senate President. The bill would prevent minors under 16 from creating social media accounts and would require social media platforms to terminate existing accounts that are “reasonably known” by the platforms to be held by children younger than 16. It also would allow parents to request that minors’ accounts be terminated. State Representative Tyler Sirois is the House bill sponsor. “These companies’ business model is the exploitation of behavioral tendencies. Put differently, they are just taking advantage of kids growing up. That is their business model,” said State Rep. Tyler Sirois, R- Merritt Island. The bill would require platforms to use independent organizations to conduct age verifications when new accounts are created and would require denial of accounts for people who do not verify their ages. The organizations would be required to delete the data after ages are verified. Meta, the parent company of platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, and the industry groups NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Association have publicly criticized the bill and argued that it would violate First Amendment rights.

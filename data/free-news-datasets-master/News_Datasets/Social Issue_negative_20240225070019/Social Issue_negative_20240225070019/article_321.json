    "text": "'Another Body' documentary exposes harm of deepfake tech By [ Kina Viola ](mailto:cunews@cornell.edu) Deepfake technology – the use of deep-learning artificial intelligence to create fake content online – creates a troubling portrait of consent in the digital age. A 2019 report by Sensity, a company that detects and monitors sexual deepfakes, found that 95% of all online deepfake videos are nonconsensual porn and 90% of those featured women. The Milstein Program in the College of Arts and Sciences, partnering with Cornell Cinema, will present [a free screening of the documentary “Another Body,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs3Wlf9BcEI) which focuses on the gendered implications of deepfake technology. The screening will be on Wednesday, February 7, at 7 p.m. at Cornell Cinema. This event is part of the [Science on Screens](https://scienceonscreen.org/) initiative, and will feature an introduction by Gili Vidan, assistant professor of information science in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science, as well as a post-show Q&A with one of the film’s directors. “Another Body” follows a college student's search for answers and justice after she discovers that the image of her face has been used without her consent in deepfake pornography. \"As deepfakes become increasingly commonplace, the film provides a look at the culture of the people behind them and asks why they do it. The answer is disturbing,\" says Milstein Program director [Austin Bunn](https://pma.cornell.edu/austin-bunn), associate professor of performing & media arts.

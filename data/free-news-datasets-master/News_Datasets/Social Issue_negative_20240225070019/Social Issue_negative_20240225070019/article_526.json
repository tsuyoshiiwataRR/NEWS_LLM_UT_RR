    "text": "The U.S. Attorney’s office in Rhode Island has completed its investigation into [civil rights complaints](https://turnto10.com/news/local/attorney-general-probes-school-for-fat-tests-of-athletes) against the North Kingstown school district, and said Thursday that the case is now resolved. The complaints involved how the district responded to complaints that former basketball coach Aaron Thomas [had inappropriately conducted body fat testing of players](https://turnto10.com/news/local/north-kingstown-high-school-aaron-thomas-basketball-coach-charges-child-molestation-sexual-assault-inappropriate-behavior-naked-body-fat-testing-july-20-2022), sometimes while the players were undressed. In a letter to three local attorneys, U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha said his office launched its investigation in December 2021. He wrote that his office is satisfied that in the time since, the district has instituted policies and procedures to address the concerns. Cunha wrote that his office agreed with the findings of two independent investigations that found: (1)as early as June 2017 and September 2018, the District was on notice of reports that Thomas met with partially undressed male students alone in his office; (2)during those meetings, Thomas engaged in unwanted contact with those students under the guise of conducting body fat testing; (3) the District failed to investigate the reports adequately and failed to monitor and oversee Thomas’s conduct after suggesting minimal changes to Thomas’s “fat test” protocols; and (4) additional students were subjected to Thomas’s sex-based harassment after the District was made aware of his misconduct. The U.S. Attorney’s investigation found that, at the time, the district had no uniform procedures to investigate or respond to complaints of sex-based harassment, and further that employees were not trained at all on how to investigate such claims. The report concludes that in the intervening two years, the district has installed new, permanent leadership, and “has taken specific steps to ensure that sex-based harassment complaints are investigated appropriately and uniformly and to address the failures we identified in our investigation.” Beginning with this school year, the district has begun to provide training on its anti-discrimination policy “to all students in grades 6 through 12, all faculty and staff at the middle schools and high school, all athletic coaches, and all student-athletes.”",

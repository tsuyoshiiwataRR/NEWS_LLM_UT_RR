    "text": "The Lagos State Taskforce has impounded no fewer than 952 motorcycles, also known as okada, within two weeks in different areas of the state. PUNCH Online reports that the taskforce impounded 344 motorcycles on January 14, and 355 motorcycles on January 23 for plying restricted routes and vowed to end the operations of the recalcitrant bike riders in the state. A statement by the Public Relations Officer of the agency, Gbadeyan Abdulraheem, revealed that 253 motorcycles were impounded on Thursday. According to him the exercise which took place along Oshodi-Apapa Expressway was directed by the Chairman of the Agency, CSP Shola Jejeloye, who disclosed that these set of operations were “warnings to okada operators but they obviously fell on deaf ears”. In the statement, Jejeloye described Apapa-Oshodi Expressway as a take off point for okada operators who violate Lagos State Traffic laws by operating in the area where okada operations have been banned outrightly. It read, “We have been to this particular location about twice because of the sensitivity of the corridor and routes it connects. “However, our leniency has been taken for granted by these okada operators and perpetrators of illegalities in this area who feel we are oblivious of their activities. We have surprised them today and confiscated all bikes that operate here. I am sure they would have gotten the picture by now”. Jejeloye also warned illegal vendors of petroleum products who deal in the sale of petrol on the highways saying that their days of engaging in such illegalities are numbered.",

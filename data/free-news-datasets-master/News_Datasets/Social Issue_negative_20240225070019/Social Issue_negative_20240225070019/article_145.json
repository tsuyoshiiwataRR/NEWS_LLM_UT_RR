    "text": "By now, anyone tuning into a House Oversight Committee or House Judiciary Committee hearing knows what to expect. With frequent slams of the gavel by their respective chairs, Republicans plod through repetitive attacks on President Joe Biden or waggle their fingers about some salacious claim including the phrase ‚ÄúHunter Biden‚Äôs laptop.‚Äù Democrats try to object and occasionally insert a fact. But the next Republican is at the mic five minutes later, once again hammering the same lies. At least that‚Äôs how it used to be. But anyone who has tuned in recently may have noticed a big change. Democrats aren‚Äôt just tearing Republican arguments apart: They‚Äôre derailing hearings and getting their opponents genuinely flustered. The recent hearing in which Republicans intended to charge Hunter Biden with contempt for declining to testify behind closed doors is a good example. Not only did Hunter make a brief personal appearance and offer to testify right then and there in public, but Democrats were able to consistently throw Republicans off their game, blow away false evidence, expose their hypocrisy, and even hammer Donald Trump. If all that seemed like it took a lot of behind-the-scenes planning, it did. But it won‚Äôt be the last time. Because as The Daily Beast reports, Democrats have a plan to make these hearings just as silly as the claims Republicans are making about Biden. As soon as they gained control of the House in 2023, Republicans launched a series of supposed investigations into President Biden. And his children. And his brother. And anyone else they can lump in to the ‚ÄúBiden Family Investigation.‚Äù For months, Rep. James Comer, who is heading up investigations in the House Oversight Committee, and Rep. Jim Jordan, who has the same role for the House Judiciary Committee, have been releasing false claims and mischaracterizing innocuous issues like a father loaning his son money for a car payment. But Republicans didn‚Äôt let having zero evidence stop them from announcing an impeachment inquiry in December. The investigations have a clear goal: to reduce Biden‚Äôs chances of reelection and to signal to Trump that they‚Äôre trying to get revenge for his two impeachments. Republicans likely feel like these endless investigations worked well for them before the 2016 elections, when they spent two full years hectoring former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about Benghazi. But this time around, the whole thing, whether it‚Äôs Republicans badgering an art dealer who sold some of Hunter‚Äôs paintings, a disappearing informant, or flashing revenge porn on the floor of the House, has been ridiculous from start to finish. The House GOP has been on a year-long fishing expedition featuring a level of obsession that would embarrass Captain Ahab, and they haven‚Äôt even found a minnow. As Republicans ramped up the Biden attacks, Democrats responded. Rep. Jamie Raskin put together a ‚ÄúTruth Squad‚Äù that includes Reps. Greg Casar, Jasmine Crockett, Maxwell Frost, Daniel Goldman, and Jared Moskowitz. If some of those names sound familiar, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôve been front and center in disrupting Republican plans. It was Crockett who forcefully kicked off a confrontation with Rep. Nancy Mace who, on a committee where every Republican member is white, accused Hunter Biden and Democrats of engaging in ‚Äúwhite privilege.‚Äù Crockett forced Mace to try and defend her indefensible remarks, and then Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez slammed the gate closed by pointing out how Mace voted to eliminate the House Subcommittee on Civil Rights. As The Daily Beast article highlights, Moskowitz was on hand with a poster showing a chummy photo of Trump and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein when it seemed that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was going to once again show nude pictures of Hunter Biden. ‚ÄúYou come up here and talk about Hunter Biden‚Äôs behavior and you‚Äôre so disgusted,‚Äù said Moskowitz, ‚Äúbut the guy that you all kneel to associates himself with a pedophile.‚Äù Those quick responses, along with Hunter Biden staring down Republicans from the visitor section, became the most viral moments from the hearing. Put together with sharp responses from other Democrats who refused to play Comer‚Äôs game, Republicans were left looking like this: MAGAt House hearing. A picture is worth 1 MILLION words. EVERY hearing Comer has had, has been a disaster. Hunter Biden showed up at the hearing and spooked the MAGAts. Then they got a tongue lashing from @RepRaskin @RepJaredMoskowitz @RepJasmine Comer knew it was a disaster! pic.twitter.com/mRSCu5am0j‚Äî Charm | DEMOCRATS deliver & NO CHAOS! üáØüá≤ üíôüåä (@CharmRobinson3) January 10, 2024 MAGAt House hearing. A picture is worth 1 MILLION words. EVERY hearing Comer has had, has been a disaster. Hunter Biden showed up at the hearing and spooked the MAGAts. Then they got a tongue lashing from @RepRaskin @RepJaredMoskowitz @RepJasmine Comer knew it was a disaster! pic.twitter.com/mRSCu5am0j The best thing to come from all this is that Raskin and the Democrats have been joined by a new set of critics attacking Comer and his pointless investigation. As Kerry Eleveld reported earlier, Republicans are none too happy that this absurd ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù has gone on so long and come up so dry. ‚ÄúJames Comer continues to embarrass himself and House Republicans. He screws up over and over and over,\" said a source identified as \"close\" to House GOP leadership, who appeared to be playing CYA for the leadership team. The source's big fear was that Comer would ultimately fail to provide the foundation necessary (i.e. evidence) to follow through with impeaching Biden. These anonymous Republicans don‚Äôt seem to be seriously considering that maybe Comer is failing not because he‚Äôs incompetent (or at least, not only because he‚Äôs incompetent) but because Joe Biden did nothing wrong. But then, they are Republicans. They‚Äôre used to having leaders whose closets are jam-packed with skeletons. Republicans are trying to repeat their perceived success with Benghazi, but this time Democrats know the game and they have a plan to disrupt it. That plan isn‚Äôt necessarily convincing Republicans that Biden did nothing wrong, but it sure is making these hearings more fun to watch.",

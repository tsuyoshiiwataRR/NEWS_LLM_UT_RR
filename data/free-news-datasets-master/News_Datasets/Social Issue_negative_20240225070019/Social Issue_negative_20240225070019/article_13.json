    "text": "WASHINGTON (TND) — The standoff at the Southern border is not letting up. Instead of allowing the federal government to cut through the razor wire in Eagle Pass, the state of Texas [is installing more.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA1rEfMB5Q8) In [a statement](https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/Border_Statement_1.24.2024.pdf) released Wednesday, Governor Greg Abbott, R-Texas, declared, \"The federal government has broken the compact between the United States and the states.” “The authors of the Constitution knew there would be times when the federal government would not live up to its duty so they empowered states in Article 1 Section 10 the right of self-defense,\" Abbott [told Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/media/texas-gov-abbott-insists-courts-side-state-over-feds-border-battle-win) in an interview Thursday. He said he would press ahead, despite the U.S. Supreme Court [siding with the Biden Administration](https://www.npr.org/2024/01/22/1226142790/supreme-court-texas-razor-wire), which argued it has the federal authority to secure the border and to remove the razor wire as it sees fit, which the White House [argued is necessary.](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/supreme-court-lets-border-patrol-cut-razor-wire-texas-installed-to-stop-migrants-9c14b32f) It's unfortunate that there is a Governor in Texas, Governor Abbott, who has politicized this issue of what's happening on the border and it's not making people's lives safer. It's actually making it harder for law enforcement,at the border to do their job,\" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in an interview with CNN. This battle between state and federal government is unfolding as the federal government has been trying to take action, with bipartisan legislation in the Senate thought to be [close to completion, ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/jan/25/trump-biden-israel-ukraine-funding-immigration-deal-latest)now facing [a major new hurdle, ](https://apnews.com/article/congress-border-security-ukraine-trump-a8601ec6629ddc5b769028ca99ad9879)with more and more Republicans publicly opposing it. In a news conference Wednesday, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said, \"This supplemental bill is a kamikaze plane in a box canyon with no exits headed for a train wreck.\" Others blame an empowered Donald Trump for trying to tank the deal. The border is a very important issue for Donald Trump. And the fact that he would communicate to Republican Senators and Congress people that he doesn't want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame Biden for it is is really appalling,\" Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said. As the drama deepens in Texas, there's more and more evidence of the impact nationwide. That includes more than 2,000 miles away at Boston’s Logan Airport where [more than a hundred migrants a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOwonr86bXw)re said to be taking shelter as other options and resources running out.",

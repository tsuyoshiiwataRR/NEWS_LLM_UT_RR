We will not let people get away with anything,” Darmanin said in a statement on X.\nFrance expels ‘radical’ Tunisian imam – interior minister\nhttps://arab.news/24phb\nFrance expels ‘radical’ Tunisian imam – interior minister\n- “The radical Imam Mahjoub Mahjoubi has just been expelled from the national territory,” Darmanin said\nPARIS: France has expelled a Tunisian imam for “radicalism” and “unacceptable remarks,” Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in a statement on X.\nTaliban authorities execute two convicted murderers in football stadium\n- Both men were executed by multiple gunshots as thousands gathered to witness the executions\n- Taliban scholars in Afghanistan have employed one of the most severe interpretations of Shariah law\nGHAZNI, Afghanistan: Taliban authorities publicly executed two men convicted of murder in a football stadium in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday, according to an AFP journalist at the scene.\nBoth men were executed by multiple gunshots to the back in Ghazni city after Supreme Court official Atiqullah Darwish read aloud a death warrant signed by Taliban Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.\n“These two people were convicted of the crime of murder,” Darwish said. “After two years of trial in the courts of the country, the order has been signed.”\nThousands of people gathered in the stadium to witness the executions.\nFamilies of the convicted men’s victims were present, including women and children, and were asked if they wanted to grant the condemned a last-minute reprieve, but they declined in both cases.\nRelatives were also offered to carry out the execution themselves, in line with Taliban government implementation of Islamic law, but members of the security forces killed both men after they refused.\nThe executed were identified as Said Jamal and Gul Khan, both guilty of knife murders in September 2017 and January 2022 respectively, according to a Supreme Court statement.\nThe statement said Akhundzada had conducted an “extraordinary investigation” into their cases.\nThe Taliban administration in Kabul has not been officially recognized by any other government since it took power in 2021 and installed its strict interpretation of Islamic law.\nAkhundzada ordered judges in 2022 to fully implement all aspects of Islamic law — including “eye for an eye” punishments known as “qisas.”\nIslamic law, or sharia, acts as a code of living for Muslims worldwide, offering guidance on issues such as modesty, finance and crime.\nHowever, interpretations vary according to local custom, culture and religious schools of thought.\nTaliban scholars in Afghanistan have employed one of the most severe interpretations of the code, including capital and corporal punishments little used by most modern Muslim states.\nHundreds of millions of dollars were spent building a new judicial system under the last foreign-backed government, a combination of Islamic and secular law with qualified prosecutors, defense lawyers and judges.\nHowever, many Afghans complained of corruption, bribery and the slow delivery of justice.\nPublic executions were common during the Taliban’s first rule from 1996 to 2001.\nThursday’s executions are believed to be the third and fourth death penalties meted out since the Taliban authorities returned to power.\nThe first two had also been convicted of murder.\nThere have been regular public floggings for other crimes, however, including theft, adultery and alcohol consumption.\nThe last reported execution was carried out in June 2023, when a convicted murderer was shot dead in the grounds of a mosque in Laghman province in front of some 2,000 people.\nThe UN mission in Afghanistan, UNAMA, condemned the use of capital punishment in a post on social media later Thursday, urging the authorities “to establish an immediate moratorium on the use of the death penalty, as a step toward its abolition.”\nUS achieves first moon landing in half century with private spacecraft\n- Spacecraft built and flown by Texas-based company Intuitive Machines landed near the moon’s south pole\n- To date, spacecraft from just four other countries, Russia, China, India and Japan, have ever landed on the moon\nA spacecraft built and flown by Texas-based company Intuitive Machines landed near the moon’s south pole on Thursday, the first US touchdown on the lunar surface in more than half a century and the first ever achieved by the private sector.\nNASA, with several research instruments aboard the vehicle, hailed the landing as a major achievement in its goal of sending a squad of commercially flown spacecraft on scientific scouting missions to the moon ahead of a planned return of astronauts there later this decade.\nBut initial communications problems following Thursday’s landing raised questions about whether the vehicle may have been left impaired or obstructed in some way.\nThe uncrewed six-legged robot lander, dubbed Odysseus, touched down at about 6:23 p.m. EST (2323 GMT), the company and NASA commentators said in a joint webcast of the landing from Intuitive Machines’ mission operations center in Houston.\nThe landing capped a nail-biting final approach and descent in which a problem surfaced with the spacecraft’s autonomous navigation system that required engineers on the ground to employ an untested work-around at the 11th hour.\nIt also took some time after an anticipated radio blackout to re-establish communications with the spacecraft and determine its fate some 239,000 miles (384,000 km) from Earth.\nWhen contact was finally renewed, the signal was faint, confirming that the lander had touched down but leaving mission control immediately uncertain as to the precise condition and orientation of the vehicle, according to the webcast.\n“Our equipment is on the surface of the moon, and we are transmitting, so congratulations IM team,” Intuitive Machines mission director Tim Crain was heard telling the operations center. “We’ll see what more we can get from that.”\nLater in the evening, the company posted a message on the social media platform X saying flight controllers “have confirmed Odysseus is upright and starting to send data.”\nQUESTION OF OBSTRUCTION\nStill, the weak signal suggested the spacecraft may have landed next to a crater wall or something else that blocked or impinged its antenna, said Thomas Zurbuchen, a former NASA science chief who oversaw creation of the agency’s commercial moon lander program.\n“Sometimes it could just be one rock, one big boulder, that’s in the way,” he said in a phone interview with Reuters.\nSuch an issue could complicate the lander’s primary mission of deploying its payloads and meeting science objectives, Zurbuchen said.\nAccomplishing the landing is “a major intermediate goal, but the goal of the mission is to do science, and get the pictures back and so forth,” he added.\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson immediately cheered Thursday’s feat as a “triumph,” saying, “Odysseus has taken the moon.”\nAs planned, the spacecraft was believed to have come to rest at a crater named Malapert A near the moon’s south pole, according to the webcast. The spacecraft was not designed to provide live video of the landing, which came one day after it reached lunar orbit and a week after its launch from Florida.\nThursday’s landing represented the first controlled descent to the lunar surface by a US spacecraft since Apollo 17 in 1972, when NASA’s last crewed moon mission landed there with astronauts Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt.\nTo date, spacecraft from just four other countries have ever landed on the moon — the former Soviet Union, China, India and, mostly recently, just last month, Japan. The United States is the only one ever to have sent humans to the lunar surface.\nOdysseus is carrying a suite of scientific instruments and technology demonstrations for NASA and several commercial customers designed to operate for seven days on solar energy before the sun sets over the polar landing site.\nThe NASA payload focuses on space weather interactions with the moon’s surface, radio astronomy and other aspects of the lunar environment for future landing missions.\nOdysseus was sent on its way to the moon last Thursday atop a Falcon 9 rocket launched by Elon Musk’s company SpaceX from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nDAWN OF ARTEMIS\nIts arrival marked the first “soft landing” on the moon ever by a commercially manufactured and operated vehicle and the first under NASA’s Artemis lunar program, as the US races to return astronauts to Earth’s natural satellite before China lands its own crewed spacecraft there.\nNASA aims to land its first crewed Artemis in late 2026 as part of long-term, sustained lunar exploration and a stepping stone toward eventual human flights to Mars. The initiative focuses on the moon’s south pole in part because a presumed bounty of frozen water exists there that can be used for life support and production of rocket fuel.\nA host of small landers like Odysseus are expected to pave the way under NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, designed to deliver instruments and hardware to the moon at lower costs than the US space agency’s traditional method of building and launching those vehicles itself.\nLeaning more heavily on smaller, less experienced private ventures comes with its own risks.\nJust last month the lunar lander of another firm, Astrobotic Technology, suffered a propulsion system leak on its way to the moon shortly after being placed in orbit on Jan. 8 by a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Vulcan rocket.\nThe malfunction of Astrobotic’s Peregrine lander marked the third failure of a private company to achieve a lunar touchdown, following ill-fated efforts by companies from Israel and Japan.\nArmenia freezes participation in Russia-led security bloc\n- Prime Minister Pashinyan says the Collective Security Treaty Organization has failed his country\n- Other ex-Soviet members of the CSTO include Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan\nArmenia has frozen its participation in the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) because the pact had failed the country, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said in an interview broadcast on Thursday.\nPashinyan also said Azerbaijan, with which Armenia has fought two wars over the past three decades, was not adhering to the principles needed to clinch a long-term peace treaty, and suggested Azerbaijan was preparing to launch another attack.\nPashinyan told France 24 television that the CSTO pact, dominated by Russia, had failed Armenia.\n“The Collective Security Treaty has not fulfilled its objectives as far as Armenia is concerned, particularly in 2021 and 2022. And we could not let that happen without taking notice,” Pashinyan said through an interpreter.\n“We have now in practical terms frozen our participation in this treaty. As for what comes next, we shall have to see.”\nHe said there was no discussion for the moment of closing a Russian base in Armenia. That was subject to different treaties.\nPashinyan has in recent months expressed discontent with Armenia’s longstanding ties with Russia and said Armenia could no longer rely on Russia to ensure its defense needs. He had suggested its membership of the CSTO was under review.\nOther ex-Soviet members of the CSTO include Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.\nAzerbaijan recovered swathes of territory in 2020 in the second war over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, populated mainly by ethnic Armenians but internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan.\nLast year, Azerbaijan’s military took control of the territory, prompting most of its residents to leave for Armenia.\nIn his remarks, Pashinyan said prospects for clinching a long-term peace treaty were hurt by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev’s statements which Armenia interpreted as laying claim to large parts of Armenian territory.\n“If the principles of territorial integrity and inviolability of borders are not recognized by Azerbaijan, it is simply not possible,” he told France 24.\n“Azerbaijan is using the situation to feed its rhetoric. That leads one to think that Azerbaijan is getting ready for a new attack on Armenia.”\nKey elements in securing a treaty are demarcation of borders and the establishment of regional transport corridors often through the territory of each others’ territory.\nAliyev has also raised the issue of determining control of ethnic enclaves on both sides of the border.\nPashinyan and Aliyev have discussed moves toward a peace treaty at several meetings, including discussions last week at the Munich Security Conference.\nPhilippines takes cancer screening into the workplace\n- Detection rates are low, diagnosis is slow\n- State asks private sector to improve workers’ health\nMANILA: Saddled with high cancer rates and late diagnoses, the Philippines is trying a whole new tack: asking businesses to step into state shoes and screen millions of workers for early signs of the disease.\nBe it cervical, breast or colon cancer, the Southeast Asian nation wants to lower its cancer deaths by increasing screening.\nMedics say early detection is key to improving survival rates, so last year the government changed course and opted to partner with the private sector to boost testing levels.\nIn September, the government ordered all employers to set up cancer prevention and control programs to ease pressures on time- and cash-poor staff, who must otherwise contribute to the cost of diagnosis and treatment themselves.\nEmployers are now required to give employees access to cancer screening, by referrals to reputable health facilities or conducting free screenings themselves.\nThe order stemmed from the landmark National Integrated Cancer Control Act, which pledged better screening, diagnosis and treatment and to make health services “more equitable and affordable for all, especially for the underprivileged, poor and marginalized.”\nCervical screening\nSince the start of the year, 500 Filipinos have tested under the new setup — officer worker Gemma Remojo was among the first.\n“I’ve been suffering from reproductive issues and hormonal imbalance so I really needed this test,” said Remojo, a 35-year-old employed by finance company Home Credit.\nUnder the Philippine health system, Remojo would have to pay for tests in a private clinic or ask the national health insurance to cover her screening, which takes time to process.\nHome Credit’s cervical screening service began in January, with kits distributed to workers for free after a short lecture.\nThe workers collect their own specimens in a designated space inside the workplace and their results are posted out by medical providers some weeks later. Employers cannot access the results, circumventing any data privacy concerns.\nA positive test detects the presence of HPV, the virus linked to cervical cancer — the fourth most common cancer among women globally.\nRoughly 91 percent of cervical cancer cases are thought to be caused by HPV, and every year more than half of cervical cancer cases in the Philippines lead to death.\nThe kit was provided for free by the Johns Hopkins Program for International Education in Gynecology and Obstetrics (Jhpiego), a nonprofit health organization helping hundreds of workers get free HPV screenings in the Philippines.\nAccording to Jhpiego, the cancer awareness lecture and do-it-yourself kits help simplify the screening process for women.\nThe government said the aim was to screen more citizens and do it more quickly — then to speed up diagnoses.\n“With cancer ranking third among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the country, the advisory serves as our proactive contribution to combating the disease,” Alvin Curada, director of the government’s Bureau of Working Conditions, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Engaging the private sector underscores the country’s commitment ... It signifies a shared responsibility between the government and the private sector,” he said.\nBridging health gaps\nA key incentive for users to get tested is the lower cost, along with a better health outlook.\nThe cost of treatment is high; Filipino cancer patients lose a combined 35 billion Philippine pesos ($625 million) a year in medical costs, out-of-pocket expenses and lost wages, according to a study by health economist Valerie Ulep of state think-tank the Philippine Institute for Development Studies.\nUlep said early screening could save lives, as only 1 percent of Filipino women are ever screened for breast or cervical cancer, among the lowest rates in the world.\nThe poor take-up comes despite that fact that breast and cervical are among the leading cancers affecting Filipino women.\nThe cost of screening is also prohibitive, said Jhpiego’s Marco Ugoy, who works to raise awareness on reproductive health.\nThe price in hospitals can range from 3,000 to 30,000 Philippine pesos, when a minimum-wage earner in the Philippines earns an average 17,000 pesos each month.\nAll employers must enroll staff in the Philippines’ national health insurance company, PhilHealth, but that universal policy only partly covers a patient’s costs.\nThe new scheme aims to bridge some of the gap.\nHard to roll out\nThe government’s Curada said work was an ideal place to run a cancer program because of its structure and facilities.\nTo ensure company compliance, employers must submit an annual report to government detailing the extent of cancer-related activities or else risk an unspecified fine.\nBut health advocates worry that guidelines may be too scant and that policy awareness remains low.\n“It’s a big step that a directive like this was signed. But do all companies implement it? Do the workers know about the policy?” said Ugoy of Jhpiego.\nUgoy said some business owners were already big advocates of workplace screenings, but he cited challenges in getting factories, especially those in autonomous ecozones, to comply.\nThe Philippines has more than 400 special economic zones that run with little or no government interference, and have historically been linked to a range of human rights concerns.\nNadia De Leon of the Institute for Occupational Health and Safety Development, a nonprofit for worker health and safety, said the new government tack represents a big step forward.\nBut the guidelines “may remain largely symbolic” if not strictly enforced and monitored, she said.\nScreenings for women\nHome Credit’s Arianne Eucogo said the company prioritized HPV screenings over other cancer programs since about 65 percent of their employees are women.\n“We’re primarily doing it for health promotion of our employees, knowing that the rate of cervical cancer deaths in the Philippines is high,” she said.\nUgoy said one of the biggest barriers to health checkups was simply time, as health centers only open during office hours.\nUgoy said the private sector must also partner with community-based groups and local government to boost take-up and get around the time constraints.\nFor example, in Taguig City, the fifth most populous in the country, dozens of companies partnered with the city’s own team to run their HPV screenings and cancer treatment, be it through office clinics, ride-hailing services or call centers.\nUgoy said this approach — with free test kits from Jhpiego and labs paid by the city government — had sped up diagnosis.\n“It shouldn’t stop at diagnostics. Screening and treatment must go hand in hand when it comes to cancer,” said Marites Diaz, who has worked for 32 years at the Taguig Health Office.\nZelensky urges US Congress to approve new Ukraine aid\n- He said a failure to do so will cost Ukrainian lives\nWASHINGTON: President Volodymyr Zelensky called on the US Congress to approve additional aid for Kyiv, saying in an interview broadcast Thursday that a failure to do so will cost Ukrainian lives.\nRepublican lawmakers in the House of Representatives have stalled the approval of $60 billion in new aid for Ukraine, and Zelensky made his appeal for action during an interview with Fox News — a favored channel for US conservatives.\n“Will Ukraine survive without Congress’ support? Of course. But not all of us,” Zelensky told Fox’s Bret Baier in an interview near a front line in Ukraine.\nThe Ukrainian leader also warned that the price of helping Kyiv now is much lower than the potential cost of confronting Russian President Vladimir Putin later if he succeeds in Ukraine.\nThe United States has provided tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine and is by far Kyiv’s biggest donor. But existing funding has dried up, and former president Donald Trump’s allies in the House have been stalling new assistance.\nTrump, the likely Republican nominee in the November presidential election, opposes helping Kyiv and recently used his sway to kill a US border reform bill that would have also authorized additional aid to Ukraine.\nZelensky told the Munich Security Conference on Saturday that he was ready to take Trump to the frontlines in Ukraine, saying policy makers should see what real war entails.\nPrint Edition\n[Read pdf version](/pdfissues/index.php) Subscribe now",

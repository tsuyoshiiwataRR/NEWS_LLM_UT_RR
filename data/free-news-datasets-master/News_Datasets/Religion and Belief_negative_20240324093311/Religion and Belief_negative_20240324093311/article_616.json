    "text": "VANCOUVER (CANADA)\nThe Catholic Register - Archdiocese of Toronto, Ontario, Canada\nFebruary 22, 2024\nThe Archdiocese of Vancouver has reached a settlement with a man who was sexually assaulted by a priest and a teacher at Holy Trinity Parish in North Vancouver in the 1970s.\nThe settlement was reached during the civil trial at B.C. Supreme Court in New Westminster, where the plaintiff, “John Doe,” described abuse by Fr. John Kilty and teacher Raymond Clavin.\nBefore the trial began, the Archdiocese acknowledged the abuse occurred but denied being negligent as an organization.\nAt John Doe’s request, the terms of the settlement are not being disclosed.\nIn a statement, the Archdiocese said, “No words of regret can fully repair the profound horror of the past and the pain endured by victims/survivors of abuse.” It said Archbishop J. Michael Miller extended “heartfelt sorrow to the plaintiff and all victims of abuse on behalf of the Catholic community.”\nBeginning in late 2018, the Archdiocese of Vancouver conducted a review of historic files relating to sexual abuse by clergy. The goal of that review, said the statement, “was to reach and help more survivors, address past wrongs and to show more transparency.” The Archdiocese came forward with the publication of names and photos of priests known to have abused children.\n“We hope the publicity from this case will help give any other victims/survivors the confidence to come forward and get the help they deserve.”\nThe Archdiocese encouraged anyone who has been a victim of Church-related abuse to come forward, no matter how long ago the abuse may have occurred. It said an independent social worker is available by calling (604) 363-7338 or 1-800-968-3146.\n“They will compassionately listen to you and outline some possible options for care. We understand how much courage it takes to report your experience, and we sincerely hope that every victim/survivor will consider coming forward.”",

    "text": "With the recent widespread criticism of the document authorizing the blessing of same-sex unions, Fiducia Supplicans , we can see hints that Francis and his collaborators may have entered new territory in their assaults against Catholic Truth. And yet, as most Traditional Catholics understand all too well, Fiducia Supplicans is simply one of Francis’s countless intolerable offenses against the Faith.\nTo better appreciate these offenses, we can consider some of the numerous ways in which Francis routinely contradicts the teachings we find in St. Matthew’s Gospel. We could of course repeat this exercise for the entire New Testament, but the picture that emerges by simply looking at St. Matthew’s Gospel tells us all we need to know about Francis’s Christian beliefs.\nWe Must Be Willing to Make Sacrifices to Avoid Sin. Francis teaches that God accepts all people as they are, and that only rigid and backward Traditional Catholics expect people to make sacrifices to avoid sin. However, Jesus made it soberingly clear that we must be willing to make great sacrifices to avoid sin: “And if thy right eye scandalize thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee. For it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should perish, rather than that thy whole body be cast into hell. And if thy right hand scandalize thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should perish, rather than that thy whole body be cast into hell.” (Matthew 5:29-30)\nNo Man Can Serve Two Masters. Jesus told us that we must serve God alone: “No man can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one, and love the other: or he will sustain the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.” (Matthew 6:24) Francis arguably agrees with this idea that we cannot serve two masters because he focuses entirely on serving the anti-Catholic globalist interests. Although there have obviously been popes who have served mammon in their personal lives, no pope has ever unambiguously taught Catholics to serve mammon the way Francis does.\nThe Path to Heaven Is Narrow. Our Lord made it clear that the path to Heaven is narrow: “Enter ye in at the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in thereat. How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth to life: and few there are that find it!” (Matthew 7:13-14) Virtually every initiative from Francis signals that the path to Heaven is wide, and almost impossible to stray from, unless perhaps one is a Traditional Catholic.\nThese examples from the Gospel of St. Matthew above should allow us to reach an undeniable conclusion: not only is Francis not Catholic, he is fundamentally anti-Christian in his words and deeds.\nOnly Those Who Do God’s Will Can Enter Heaven. Jesus wants to save all souls, but only those who do His will can be saved: “Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doth the will of My Father who is in heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven. Many will say to Me in that day: Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied in Thy Name, and cast out devils in Thy Name, and done many miracles in Thy Name? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from Me, you that work iniquity.” (Matthew 7:21-23) In light of these words, we must conclude that Francis’s continual efforts to dissuade souls from doing God’s will are diabolical.\nJesus Will Deny Those Who Deny Him. Jesus made it clear that He did not seek to unify all men in a faithless brotherhood: “Every one therefore that shall confess Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father who is in heaven. But he that shall deny Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven. Do not think that I came to send peace upon earth: I came not to send peace, but the sword.” (Matthew 10:32-34) In various ways, including his pursuit of false ecumenism, Francis tries to persuade Catholics and the world that Jesus does not require men to follow Him and would certainly not judge them for failing to do so.\nWe Should Want to Avoid Hell. Whereas Francis suggests that Hell might be empty and also scolds Catholics who try to bring souls to the Faith so that they might avoid Hell, Our Lord frequently instructed His disciples on the great need for them to avoid damnation: “So shall it be at the end of the world. The angels shall go out, and shall separate the wicked from among the just. And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matthew 13:49-50) If Jesus was deceiving His disciples about this, why would we believe anything else He said?\nWe Must Deny Ourselves and Carry the Cross. Jesus taught that we must put spiritual concerns over material concerns: “Then Jesus said to his disciples: If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. For he that will save his life, shall lose it: and he that shall lose his life for My sake, shall find it.” (Matthew 16:24-25) However, Francis’s entire message centers around prioritizing the interests of our fallen human nature and the globalist agenda, at the expense of serving God. Francis’s support of Covid lockdowns and vaccines should have removed any doubt on this point.\nIt is doubtlessly virtuous to resist Fiducia Supplicans, because every exercise of the supposed authority it grants is an offense against God and danger to souls.\nWe Should Avoid Scandal. In one of the most striking warnings of the Bible, Jesus tells us that we must not scandalize others, especially children: “But he that shall scandalize one of these little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe to the world because of scandals. For it must needs be that scandals come: but nevertheless woe to that man by whom the scandal cometh. And if thy hand, or thy foot scandalize thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee. It is better for thee to go into life maimed or lame, than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into everlasting fire.” (Matthew 18:6-8) Conversely, Francis has gone out of his way on numerous occasions to openly scandalize the Church and world, including his promotion of the LGTBQ agenda, defense of notorious perverts, and insistence that everyone must take dangerous and ineffective shots if they love their neighbor.\nThe House of God Should Not Be a Den of Thieves. Jesus did not tolerate those who defiled the House of God: “And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the chairs of them that sold doves: And he saith to them: It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.” (Matthew 21:12-13) Francis makes the Church a den of thieves (by honoring and promoting the anti-Catholic globalists) and heretics (by welcoming non-Catholic worship) but chases out those who sincerely try to practice the Faith that Jesus’s Apostles transmitted to their successors.\nJesus’s Words Will Not Pass Away. Francis tells Catholics that they can no longer follow Jesus’s words, because doing so is rigid and backward. However, Jesus said that His words would never pass: “Heaven and earth shall pass, but my words shall not pass.” (Matthew 24:35) Because Jesus’s words will never pass, Christians have no right whatsoever to reinterpret them in light of modern appetites to reach conclusions that fundamentally differ from His plain meaning.\nGo Forth and Teach the Nations. Francis routinely condemns proselytism, characterizing it as evil to try to convert souls to Catholicism. However, we know that Our Lord wants us to bring souls to His Church: “Going therefore, teach ye all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Teaching them to observe all things I have commanded you.” (Matthew 28:19-20)\nWhatever he is — false prophet, abomination of desolation, and/or anti-pope — we can pray for his conversion but we cannot in any way support his unholy agenda without thereby choosing Satan over God.\nWe Must Obey Jesus’s Commandments. Jesus also charged His Church with teaching souls to follow His commandments: “Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.” (Matthew 28:20) According to Francis, though, there is no need to follow Jesus’s commandments — he tells us that we need to welcome and accompany others, but that has no resemblance to practicing the charity about which Jesus taught.\nWe could add other passages from the Gospel of St. Matthew that Francis routinely contradicts, and there are of course many other passages in the New Testament that Francis rejects, particularly those related to the need to receive Communion worthily. However, these examples from the Gospel of St. Matthew above should allow us to reach an undeniable conclusion: not only is Francis not Catholic, he is fundamentally anti-Christian in his words and deeds.\nIt is doubtlessly virtuous to resist Fiducia Supplicans, because every exercise of the supposed authority it grants is an offense against God and danger to souls. However, the “game-changing” aspect of that blasphemous document should encourage faithful Catholics to focus more on what we must do to petition God’s grace to resolve the crisis of the papacy. Perhaps our available recourse at this point resides predominantly in prayer and penance; but it is entirely reasonable for the remaining faithful cardinals and bishops to prayerfully consider if it is God’s will to call an imperfect council to declare Francis an anti-pope and replace him.\nGiven the unlikelihood of today’s remaining bishops taking steps to remove Francis, we are essentially left with prayer, penance, and complete resistance of Francis’s demonic agenda. We cannot pick and choose which of his monstrous errors to oppose, for so doing implies that some of them are tolerable offenses against God. Whatever he is — false prophet, abomination of desolation, and/or anti-pope — we can pray for his conversion but we cannot in any way support his unholy agenda without thereby choosing Satan over God. Immaculate Heart of Mary, pray for us!",

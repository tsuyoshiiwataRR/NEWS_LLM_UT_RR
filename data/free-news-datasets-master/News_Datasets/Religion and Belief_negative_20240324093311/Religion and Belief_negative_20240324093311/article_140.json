    "text": "OTTAWA: A white supremacist committed terrorism when he ran down a Muslim family out for an evening stroll, a Canadian judge said Thursday as she sentenced him to life in prison for the murders.\nThe ruling is the first in Canada to make a link between white supremacy and terrorism in a murder case.\nNathaniel Veltman, 23, was convicted in November of four counts of first degree or premeditated murder, and one count of attempted murder in the killing of three generations of the Afzaal family that also left a young boy orphaned.\nHe acknowledged striking the family with his pickup truck in June 2021 in London, Ontario.\nThe prosecution argued at trial that he sought to intimidate and terrorize Muslims, while the defense said he’d suffered a mental decline — which did not, however, meet the requirements for an insanity plea.\nHis lawyers also said he was in “a state of extreme confusion” after consuming hallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms that weekend.\nJudge Renee Pomerance of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice at his sentencing said Veltman “had planned a murderous rampage for months and took steps to ensure that he would kill as many Muslims in this brutal manner as he could.”\nRecalling Veltman’s statements to police, she said: “He wanted to intimidate the Muslim community. He wanted to follow in the footsteps of other mass killers, and he wanted to inspire others to commit murderous acts.”\n“I find that the offender’s actions constitute terrorist activity,” she concluded.\nThe jury in the almost 10-week trial heard Veltman had penned a “terrorist manifesto,” found on his computer, in which he espoused white nationalism and described his hate for Muslims.\nThe judge noted that he wore “combat gear” including a helmet and bulletproof vest during the attack.\nVeltman passed the Afzaal family on a London street on that warm Sunday evening, turned his newly purchased truck with a heavy grill guard around, jumped the curb and slammed into them.\nSalman Afzaal, 46, his wife Madiha Salman, 44, their 15-year-old daughter Yumnah and her grandmother Talat Afzaal, 74, were killed. A nine-year-old boy orphaned in the ramming suffered serious but non-life-threatening injuries.\nThe slaying was the deadliest anti-Muslim attack in Canada since a shooting at a mosque in Quebec City in 2017 that left six dead. The perpetrator of that shooting was not accused of terrorism.\nCanadian sentenced to life in prison for ‘terrorist’ murders of Muslim family\nhttps://arab.news/4kqnt\nCanadian sentenced to life in prison for ‘terrorist’ murders of Muslim family\n- The ruling is the first in Canada to make a link between white supremacy and terrorism in a murder case\n- The prosecution argued at trial that Nathaniel Veltman sought to intimidate and terrorize Muslims\nOTTAWA: A white supremacist committed terrorism when he ran down a Muslim family out for an evening stroll, a Canadian judge said Thursday as she sentenced him to life in prison for the murders.\nUS to sanction over 500 targets involved in Russia ‘war machine’: Treasury\nWASHINGTON: The United States plans to impose sanctions on more than 500 targets involved in Russia’s war in Ukraine, as fighting continues to rage two years after Moscow’s invasion, the Treasury Department said Thursday.\nThe action to be rolled out on Friday will hit “Russia, its enablers, and its war machine,” a Treasury spokesperson told AFP.\nFour men charged in US with transporting suspected Iranian-made weapons\nWASHINGTON: Four men have been charged after the US Navy interdicted a vessel in the Arabian Sea last month that was transporting suspected Iranian-made weapons, the US Justice Department said on Thursday.\nTwo US Navy Seals died during the interdiction, which happened in international waters near the coast of Somalia.\nIn a statement following the seizure of the vessel, the US Central Command said the seized contraband consisted of both \"Iranian-made ballistic missile and cruise missiles components.\"\n\"Seized items include propulsion, guidance, and warheads for Houthi medium range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) and anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), as well as air defense associated components,\" CENTCOM said.\n\"Initial analysis indicates these same weapons have been employed by the Houthis to threaten and attack innocent mariners on international merchant ships transiting in the Red Sea,\" it said.\nThe weapons parts were seized from a dhow — a traditional masted sailing vessel — which was deemed unsafe and sunk. Fourteen crewmembers were taken into custody.\nThe seizure of the weapons came after US and British forces hit scores of rebel targets across Yemen, a move triggered by the rebels' repeated attacks on shipping.\nAttacks by and against the Huthis, part of the \"axis of resistance\" of Iran-aligned groups, have raised concerns about violence spreading in the region from the Gaza war.\nThe Houthis say their attacks on Red Sea shipping are in solidarity with Gaza, where Iran-backed Hamas militants have been at war with Israel for more than three months.\nFrance expels “radical” Tunisian imam — interior minister\n- “The radical Imam Mahjoub Mahjoubi has just been expelled from the national territory,” Darmanin said\nPARIS: France has expelled a Tunisian imam for “radicalism” and “unacceptable remarks,” Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in a statement on X.\n“The radical Imam Mahjoub Mahjoubi has just been expelled from the national territory, less than 12 hours after his arrest. We will not let people get away with anything,” Darmanin said in a statement on X.\nNavalny mother says being pressured into ‘secret’ burial\n- The Navalny case remained in the international spotlight with US President Joe Biden meeting the Russian politician’s widow and daughter, Yulia and Dasha Navalnaya, in San Francisco\n- Lyudmila Navalnaya, mother of President Vladimir Putin’s most outspoken critic, said she had been shown his body in a morgue in Salekhard\nMOSCOW: The mother of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic prison last week, said Thursday officials were pressuring her to agree to a “secret” burial for her son.\nThe Navalny case remained in the international spotlight with US President Joe Biden meeting the Russian politician’s widow and daughter, Yulia and Dasha Navalnaya, in San Francisco on Thursday.\nLyudmila Navalnaya, mother of President Vladimir Putin’s most outspoken critic, said she had been shown his body in a morgue in Salekhard, the nearest town to the remote prison, after several days of being refused access.\n“Yesterday evening they secretly took me to the morgue where they showed me Alexei,” she said in a video released on social media by Navalny’s team.\nBut she said investigators wanted her son, who was 47, to be buried “secretly, without a chance to say goodbye.\n“They are blackmailing me, they put conditions for where, when and how Alexei should be buried. This is illegal,” she said.\nNavalny, whose death was announced last Friday, galvanized mass protests against Putin, winning popularity with a series of investigations into state corruption.\nHe was poisoned with a Soviet-era nerve agent in 2020, then jailed in 2021 after returning to Russia following a period of treatment in Germany.\nHe was sentenced to 19 years in prison on extremism charges and sent to IK-3, a harsh penal colony beyond the Arctic Circle known as “Polar Wolf.”\nWestern governments and Russian opposition figures have accused the Kremlin of being responsible for Navalny’s death on February 16.\nBiden met privately with the Navalny’s widow and daughter “to express his heartfelt condolences for their terrible loss,” the White House said.\nThe White House also backed the mother’s campaign to retrieve Navalny’s body.\n“The Russians need to give her back her son,” US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.\nPersonal tensions between Biden and Putin increased after the US leader called his Russian counterpart a “crazy SOB” an election campaign event late Wednesday.\nPutin responded with his sarcasm, referring to his recent remark that he would prefer the more “predictable” Biden over Donald Trump in the White House.\n“He can’t of course say to me: Volodya, well done, thank you (for the endorsement), you’ve helped me a lot?” Putin said.\nHundreds of people have been detained in Russia in recent days at events to pay tribute to Navalny and his widow has vowed to continue his work.\nLyudmila Navalnaya traveled to Russia’s Far North the morning after Navalny’s death was announced, hoping to be able to see and retrieve her son’s body.\n“They want to take me to the edge of a cemetery to a fresh grave and say: Here is where your son lies. I am against that.\n“I want that for those of you for whom Alexei is dear, for everyone for whom his death became a personal tragedy, to have the possibility to say goodbye to him.”\nShe said she recorded the video because investigators were “threatening” her.\n“Looking me in the eye, they said that if I do not agree to a secret funeral they’ll do something with my son’s body... I ask for my son’s body to be given to me immediately,” she said.\nNavalny’s mother also said that investigators had told her they knew the cause of death but did not say what it was.\nThe Kremlin has refused to say when the body will be handed over and has branded Western accusations as “hysterical.”\nPutin has remained silent on the death of his main political opponent.\nNavalny’s spokesman Kira Yarmysh said that a medical report on the death shown to Lyudmila Navalnaya “stated that the cause of death was natural.”\nAlbanian parliament ratifies migration centers deal with Italy\n- First example of a non-European Union country accepting migrants on behalf of an EU nation\n- Accord has drawn comparisons with Britain’s plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda\nTIRANA: Albanian lawmakers on Thursday ratified a migration deal with Italy under which Rome will build processing centers for migrants that it will send on to its Balkan neighbor across the Adriatic Sea.\nIt is the first example of a non-European Union country accepting migrants on behalf of an EU nation, and is part of an EU-wide campaign to clamp down on irregular immigration that has fueled a rise in the popularity of the far right.\nThe accord has drawn comparisons with Britain’s plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda in East Africa as a deterrent to further migrant journeys in small boats across the Channel from France organized by human traffickers.\nSeventy-seven deputies in the 140-seat parliament voted in favor of the deal, announced in November, under which Italy will open two camps in EU-candidate Albania, one of Europe’s poorest and least developed countries.\n“Albania is standing together with Italy by choosing to act like an EU member state,” Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama wrote on social media platform X following parliament’s vote.\n“No country can solve such a challenge alone. Only a stronger, braver and more sovereign Europe loyal to itself can.”\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni replied on X, thanking Rama, Albania’s institutions and people “for their friendship and collaboration.”\nOne of the camps Italy plans to set up on the Albanian coast would screen sea migrants on arrival, and a second nearby would hold them while asylum applications are processed. Migrants would then either be allowed to enter Italy or be repatriated.\nAn Italian government source said Rome aimed to have the centers in Albania operational by this spring.\nThe deal has drawn international criticism from human rights advocates, and domestically from those who fear its impact on Albania’s security and on its financially vital tourist industry.\n“This (tourist area) will not be the same again once the migrant processing centers are built,” said Arilda Lleshi, an activist who protested in front of parliament during the vote.\n“We have reasons to believe that these (migrant centers) will be a security problem for the whole area.”\nThe agreement was challenged before Albania’s Constitutional Court by the main opposition Democratic Party, which argued that it broke the constitution by ceding sovereignty over Albanian soil to another country.\nThe Constitutional Court rejected the claims and gave a green light last month. While UN officials have criticized the Italy-Albania deal, the European Commission has said it does not appear to breach EU law as it falls outside its jurisdiction.\nRights experts warn it might be hard for Italian courts to promptly process asylum requests or appeals against detention orders from people hosted in another country, and lengthy procedures could put an unjustified burden on migrants.\nPrint Edition\n[Read pdf version](/pdfissues/index.php) Subscribe now",

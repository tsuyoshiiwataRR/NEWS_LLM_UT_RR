    "text": "Fury has erupted after a North Carolina pastor giving a sermon said that he would clear any rapist whose victim was wearing shorts because 'a man's a man'.\nPastor Bobby Leonard was forced to apologize for his despicable comments, posting a message on the billboard outside the Bible Baptist Tabernacle church in Monroe saying: 'I was wrong'.\nBut it was too late. The clip quickly went viral, and people called for him to resign.\nChristian journalist, Julie Roys, wrote: 'Yes, a man is a man, not an animal. And he is responsible for controlling himself. This pastor needs to resign.'\nIn the full video, Pastor Leonard can be seen addressing the congregation, holding his hands out as he says 'if you dress like that and you get raped, and I'm on the jury, he's gone go free' because 'a man's a man'.\nHe said: 'You find more women going to those places with shorts, than you will women with pants and dresses put together.\n'Try it, if you got time, try it. Have your boy go ahead and try it and watch for it, have your girl go out and watch for it.\n'I used to say this, I haven't said this in a long time, you ready: I say if you dress like that and you get raped, and I'm on the jury, he's gone go free, you don't like it do you, I'm right though.\n'I'm right, because a man's a man.'\nFury erupted online with one viewer saying: 'Pull him out of the pulpit. This shouldn't even be a discussion.'\nAnother said: 'That is beyond disgusting. Utterly shameful.'",

    "text": "While many in America will flat out deny it—the media, corrupt bureaucrats, radical activists and so on— Christians across the country have been noticing an increase of attacks against them, and by extension, God.\nIn a recent report, Breitbart reported an increase of 600% in attacks on churches alone in the country, and one group has the finger pointed squarely at them for the inflammatory rhetoric that is targeting those who declare faith in God and His ways.\n\"The left is trying to shame Christians, to silence you, demoralize you and keep you out of politics. But Christians cannot afford to sit on the sidelines in this fight. ... Ultimately, the radical left is coming after all of us, because they know that our allegiance is not to them—our allegiance is to our country and to our Creator.\"\nBreaking News. Spirit-Filled Stories. Subscribe to Charisma on YouTube now!\nThese are the words of former President Donald Trump addressing the National Religious Broadcasters 80th convention, and whether one likes the man or not, his words ring true.\nAs reported by The Federalist, \"Despite casting himself as a devoted Catholic, Biden has presided over what has arguably been the most antagonistic administration toward faithful Christians in the modern era.\"\nBut where is the proof?\nToday, the People's House – your house – sends a clear message to the country and to the world.\nAmerica is a nation of pride. pic.twitter.com/ZZS9oTpDww\n— President Biden (@POTUS) June 11, 2023 Well, actions speak much louder than words, so take a look at what the Department of Justice has done under the Biden regime.\nIn January of 2023, an FBI memo came to light disclosing that the agency's Richmond, Virginia, field office had undertaken an investigation into what was characterized as a \"white supremacy\" threat within the Catholic community attending Latin Mass.\nSuch congregants were labeled \"Radical-Traditionalist Catholics,\" while advocating using informants to spy on the Catholic community in America.\nWhile there are far more incidents to speak of such as the recent conviction of six peaceful, pro-life protesters (how many anti-Israel rioters have been arrested?) earlier this year, take the President's own actions and see if they are not hostile to the Christian community.\nWhen Lorie Smith, a graphic artist who refused works that violated her religious beliefs, won her case before the Supreme Court, Biden went berserk.\nHe released a statement condemning the Supreme Court's decision, a trend during his presidency, saying the Court's ruling threatened the promise of our democracy (America is a Constitutional Republic).\nGet your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today! Stay up-to-date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more!\nThis is a stark contrast to the promises Trump made at the NRB convention should he be elected to serve a second term as president.\n\"I will also take historic action to defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology and restore the timeless truth that God created two genders, male and female. I will keep men out of women's sports and I will sign a law prohibiting child sexual mutilation in all 50 states,\" Trump declared.\n\"But no one will be touching the cross of Christ under the Trump administration. I swear to you, that will never happen. Never happen.\"\nRegardless of who is president of the United States or what events are occurring within the world, if you are a Christian, you can expect to suffer persecution as a result of your faith in Jesus Christ.\nPaul writes in 2 Timothy 3:12, \"Yes, and all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.\"\nSo make sure that your spiritual roots run deep into the Word of God, because that is the only way to withstand the storms the enemy and his minions will throw at you.\nJoin Charisma Magazine Online to follow everything the Holy Spirit is doing around the world!\nJames Lasher is Staff Writer for Charisma Media.",

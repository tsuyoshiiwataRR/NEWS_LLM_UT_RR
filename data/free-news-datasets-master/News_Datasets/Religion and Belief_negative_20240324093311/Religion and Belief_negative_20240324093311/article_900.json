    "text": "New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Friday refused to permit prayers at the recently demolished Akhoondji mosque and the nearby graveyard in Mehrauli on Shab-e-Barat.Hearing an application by the managing committee of Delhi Waqf Board, Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav noted that the court had directed status quo on the site, which was now in the possession of Delhi Development Authority (DDA). HC said it couldn’t allow a change in the status quo.The application forms part of a petition by the committee on the issue of demolition. Muslims seek forgiveness from Allah for their sins and those of their ancestors on Shab-e-Barat, the night of atonement.Justice Kaurav observed that the main petition, which was heard by the court on several occasions, was already listed for final disposal on March 7. “At this stage, the court is not inclined to pass any directions. The application is dismissed,” he ordered.The mosque, believed to be over 600 years old, and the Behrul Uloom madrasa there were declared as illegal structures in Sanjay Van and demolished by DDA on Jan 30. On Feb 5, the high court had asked DDA to maintain the status quo at the site. The counsel for the petitioner said worshippers, whose families were buried in the nearby graveyard, should be allowed to offer prayers there on Shab-e-Barat later this month. He said the mosque was several centuries old and silent prayers were being offered there for the last many years. The petitioner has argued that the demolition of the mosque is illegal.Opposing the plea, DDA, represented by advocate Sanjay Katiyar, maintained that the land owning agency was in possession of the public land. DDA defended action before the court on the ground that the demolition took place pursuant to the Jan 4 recommendation of its religious committee. The decision, it said, was taken after the religious committee had given an opportunity of hearing to the CEO of Delhi Waqf Board. The petitioner contended that the committee had no jurisdiction to order any demolition.On Jan 31, the court had asked DDA to file its reply clearly setting out the action that has been taken in respect of the property concerned as well as its basis.",

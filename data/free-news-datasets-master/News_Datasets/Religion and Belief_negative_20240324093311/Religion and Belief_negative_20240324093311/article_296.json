    "text": "Shehu Sani, a former Kaduna Central Senator, says the call by an Islamic cleric to kill the wife of President Bola Tinubu, Oluremi, is condemnable. Sani said Nigerians should criticize the government and its policies within the ambit of the law. The Islamic cleric, whose identity could not be ascertained, had said Oluremi Tinubu should be killed for being a pastor. In a viral video, the cleric is heard saying the Muslim/Muslim ticket that brought President Bola Tinubu to power was a scam. The cleric averred that Mrs Tinubu, \\\"being an infidel should be put to death as provided for in the Quran,\\\" he, however, did not provide any chapter or verse of the Quran to support his claim. \\\"Now, Tinubu, his wife is an infidel. As an infidel, she is a leader among the infidels. “God's judgement says she must be killed. She's a pastor, a leader of infidels (Christians); Allah says they must be killed,\\\" he said. Reacting, Sani posted on X: \\\"Criticising the Government and its policies is within the ambit of democratic rights; but Calling for the killing of Senator Remi Tinubu by the religious cleric is unacceptable and utterly condemnable.\\\" Mrs Tinubu is an assistant pastor at the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG.",

    "text": "NEW YORK--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Tuned , a digital hearing health company providing preventive and comprehensive hearing health for employers, today announced it secured an oversubscribed $3.2 million seed extension led by Unum Group, with participation from Distributed Ventures. Tuned's latest round brings its total funds raised to $8.2 million, signaling strong investor confidence in the company’s mission to make comprehensive hearing care a cornerstone of competitive employee health benefits.\nUndiagnosed hearing issues cost employers up to $9,100 per person annually , representing $133 billion in U.S. healthcare spending compared to those without hearing loss. With 50 million Americans experiencing unaddressed hearing issues, and 60 percent of them in the workforce, Tuned addresses a critical gap in employee benefits and represents a key piece of talent attraction for employers.\n“Tuned's groundbreaking approach to hearing health is shaping a future where preventive hearing care is not just an afterthought, but a cornerstone of comprehensive employee health and wellness benefits,” said James Hettenbach, Vice President, Head of Business Ventures at Unum Group. “Tuned is helping to eliminate the misconceptions and stigma surrounding hearing loss while offering an easy way for employees and their families to safeguard their hearing health.”\n“At a time when headphones have become commonplace as a tool for both leisure and business, increasing the risk of hearing loss, Tuned represents a proactive way for employers to simultaneously protect their employees’ well-being and distinguish themselves in the all-important battle for talent,” said Shawn Ellis, Managing Partner for Distributed Ventures. “We believe Tuned is smart, nimble and well-positioned to serve an under-recognized market.”\nLed by the largest online group of audiologists in the U.S, Tuned is the only telehealth platform that supports the entire continuum of hearing care, from prevention to intervention. Today, Tuned’s comprehensive hearing benefit is available to more than 1.4 million people.\n“The only other options for hearing coverage today are discounted hearing aid programs, which cater only to those with severe hearing issues,” said Danny Aronson, CEO and co-founder of Tuned. “Tuned is different because we offer preventive screenings and education while also identifying and supporting the full spectrum of hearing loss, such as mild or moderate loss, and other auditory disorders.\n“By addressing a critically overlooked part of our health, we can ensure millions of employees preserve their hearing health and prevent further loss, while positively impacting their overall health, well-being and productivity.”\nTuned is coming off an impressive year of growth in 2023 that saw the company add a record number of new employer customers to its telehealth benefits platform. The company rolled out its STAR solution, an integrated scheduling, testing, analytics and recording platform that helps employers subject to federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations achieve compliance. In June, Tuned introduced its employer-sponsored pediatric benefit offering to provide hearing screenings for adolescents.\nThe company’s latest investment from Unum Group will help Tuned grow its commercial team, expand its roster of audiologists to serve more employers, and develop innovative new offerings for customers.\nAbout Tuned\nTuned is a digital health solution focused on hearing conservation and loss prevention for people of all ages. Available as an employer-sponsored benefit or OSHA-compliant solution, Tuned offers lifelong preventive hearing care and benefits, with clinically validated screenings, support and solutions for a full range of hearing issues, ranging from tinnitus and auditory processing disorders to severe hearing loss, that affect as many as one in four working adults.

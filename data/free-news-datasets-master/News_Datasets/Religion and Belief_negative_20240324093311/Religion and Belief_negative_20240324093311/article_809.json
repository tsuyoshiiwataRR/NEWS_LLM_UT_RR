    "text": "WASHINGTON (TND) — Hostile acts toward U.S. churches have increased eightfold over the past nearly six years, according to a new [report](https://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF24B78.pdf). The Family Research Council identified 915 antagonistic acts directed at Christian worship centers from 2018-23, with 436 of them occurring last year. 2023’s total more than doubled 2022’s tally of 195 incidents. Vandalism, arson, gun-related incidents, bomb threats and other aggressive actions reportedly spiked due to what the council fears is a societal collapse in respect for religion. “Acts of hostility against churches are destructive and have the potential to intimidate a religious community,” the council stated. “They deserve to be condemned.” Just over 700 of the incidents were classified as vandalism. Arson acts represented the second-most frequent crime, as the council identified 135 reports of them over the six-year span. The report claims antagonistic incidents have taken place in an American culture growing confrontational to Christianity. While increased public reporting on crimes against churches may partially account for a greater tally of them, the council pointed to shifting attitudes toward Christianity as evidence of a dangerous cultural trend. “Americans appear increasingly comfortable lashing out against church buildings, pointing to a larger societal problem of marginalizing core Christian beliefs, including those that touch on hot-button political issues related to human dignity and sexuality,” the report noted. “Attacks on houses of worship may also signal a discomfort with religion in general.” READ MORE | [US attorney says now is the time to have difficult talks about attacks on religious institutions](https://thenationaldesk.com/top-videos/attorney-says-now-is-time-to-have-difficult-talks-about-attacks-on-religious-institutions-kenneth-parker-law-enforcement-mass-shootings-violence-churches-synagogues-security-threats#) The council suggested the perpetrators of the hostile acts deserve reproach. “The free exercise of religion has always been an essential component of American society and is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution as a basic right,” it stated. “Attempts to prevent religious exercise through threats or violence should be soundly condemned by anyone who values the First Amendment.” Earlier this month, a Texas woman allegedly fired an AR-15 into a Houston megachurch before security officers shot her dead. Genesse Ivonne Moreno’s 7-year-old son accompanied her to the church and received a gunshot wound to his head. Moreno’s mother-in-law, Walli Carranza, applied the blame to government shortcomings. “The fault lies in child protective services of Montgomery County and Harris County that refused to remove custody from a woman with known mental illness that was not being treated and with the state of Texas for not having strong red flag laws that would have prevented her from owning or possessing a gun,” Carranza said.

    "text": "CV NEWS FEED // Australian authorities this week arrested a retired Catholic bishop on charges of sexual offenses including rape, assault, and child abuse. Retired Bishop Christopher Saunders of Broome, Australia was arrested Wednesday on 19 [charges](https://catholicvote.org/child-abuse-detectives-search-bishop-house/) for offenses that date from 2008 to 2014. Saunders was released on bail on Thursday and remains under house arrest until his hearing, which is set for June. [According](https://www.ncregister.com/cna/australian-bishop-christopher-saunders-arrested-charged-with-rape) to the National Catholic Register, Saunders, 74, was charged with two counts of rape, 14 counts of unlawful and indecent assault, and three counts of “indecently dealing with a child as a person in authority.” The offenses reportedly took place in the towns of Broome, Kununurra, and the Aboriginal community of Kalumburu. Bishop Saunders will plead not guilty to the charges brought against him, according to local reports. On Thursday, the President of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, Archbishop Timothy Costelloe [stated](https://www.catholic.au/s/article/Matter-regarding-Bishop-Christopher-Saunders): “Allegations against the former Bishop of Broome, Christopher Saunders are very serious and deeply distressing, especially for those making those allegations.” “It is right and proper, and indeed necessary, that all such allegations be thoroughly investigated,” Costelloe added. “The Church will continue to cooperate fully with the police and take every necessary step to avoid any actions which may compromise the integrity and autonomy of the police investigation.” Allegations against Saunders were first made in 2020. [According](https://www.vaticannews.va/en/church/news/2024-02/christopher-saunders-charged-timothy-costelloe-investigation.html) to Vatican News, independent investigators carried out a [canonical investigation](https://catholicvote.org/australian-bishop-under-vatican-investigation-sexual-misconduct/) ordered by Pope Francis. Saunders resigned in 2021. The investigation ended with a 200 page report that was given to Australian police. Vatican News reported, “After this report was handed over to Australian police, they opened a new investigation into Bishop Emeritus Saunders. It is as part of this investigation that he has now been charged.”",

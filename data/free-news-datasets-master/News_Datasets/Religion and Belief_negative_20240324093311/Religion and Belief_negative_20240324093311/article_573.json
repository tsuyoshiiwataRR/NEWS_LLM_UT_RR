    "text": "J&KAnjuman Auqaf says Mirwaiz again barred from offering Friday prayers By KNS Posted on Feb 23, 2024 | Updated on Feb 23, 2024 Share Tweet Share Srinagar, Feb 23 (KNS): Anjuman Auqaf Jama Masjid Srinagar has condemned the action of not allowing Mirwaiz Dr Moulvi Mohammad Umar Farooq to deliver sermons and offer Friday prayers in the historic Jama Masjid Srinagar. The Anjuman in a statement issued to KNS said that after his release from four years of house arrest, Mirwaiz was allowed to visit the Jama Masjid only on three Fridays and has been under house arrest every Friday since then. The statement reads that such attitude of the administration towards him is not only sad but also causes great grief among the people. \"The administration is not giving any justifiable reason as to why it doesn't allow him to offer Friday prayers, and this process has been going on continuously for the last several months.\" It said that such actions, including his repeated house arrest, especially on Fridays, represent a clear and blatant violation of his fundamental religious rights. \"This undue interference in religious affairs not only undermines the basic principles of freedom of religion and belief but also deepens the sense of injustice and alienation among the people.\" (KNS) Related Categories: Share Tweet Share Recommended for you Lt.

This is how Suella Braverman described pro-Palestine protesters in a piece for the Times last week. Far-right protesters, including Tommy Robinson, turned up in London on Saturday, the day of the pro-Palestine march, to assert their own primacy, and clashed with police. This was not inevitable, but always highly possible. A swirl of Islamophobia and anti-immigration rhetoric have been part of our politics for so long that all it took was one motivated actor to convert them into something explosive.\n....\nIt has been easy to forget just how pervasive anti-Muslim messaging was, because we have in recent years also become engulfed in all manner of culture wars about identity, history and gender. But for the decade and a half after 9/11, it was open season on Muslims, first as terror suspects, and then as just dodgy wrong ’uns. One may not recall the detail of all the allegations, yet the essence has lingered and settled in our collective psyche. How could it not, when we were told that Christian children were forced into the foster care of Muslim families who “didn’t speak English”; that one in five British Muslims had sympathies with jihadis; that they were trying to ban £5 notes because they were not “halal”; that there was a plot to take over British schools and Islamise them?\n-50% of full article.\nread more here:\n[\nlink to www.theguardian.com (secure)\n]\nI came.

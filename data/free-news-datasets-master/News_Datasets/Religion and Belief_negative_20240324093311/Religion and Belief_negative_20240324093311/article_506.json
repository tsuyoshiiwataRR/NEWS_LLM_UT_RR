    "text": "No Jagran Or Religious Program Will Be Held In Kalkaji Temple Without Permission: Delhi High Court After Accident Resulting In Lady's Death Nupur Thapliyal 23 Feb 2024 2:16 PM GMT The Delhi High Court has ordered that no jagran or religious program will be held in the premises of city's Kalkaji mandir without permission of the Administrator, who has been appointed by the Court and given full management and control of the temple. Justice Prathiba M Singh took note of a recent incident where many individuals got injured and a lady died due to collapse of a platform while a jagran was being held in the temple on January 27. The jagran program was organised by two individuals stated to be members of Sevadar Mitr Mandal organisation. Singer B Praak was also invited to sing in the program. Expressing displeasure over the “unfortunate incident,” the court observed that the entire management, control and administration of the temple has to be only under the supervision of the Administrator and not under control of any other person, society or entity. “From the above, it is clear that the Mahant's position is that he is not authorized to take administrative decisions or to give any permission to organizers for holding any program in the premises. The premises of the Kalkaji Mandir is for the use by the public and no individual or entity can exercise exclusive control on any part of the said premises,” the court said. It added that the Administrator having been appointed and given full management and control of the mandir, any event that has to be organized would require his permission. Furthermore, the court directed the Administrator take steps for crowd management at the Mandir premises. Justice Singh further said that the entire temple has to be used for the purpose of welfare of the devotees and the redevelopment work is of utmost importance for the safety, welfare and security of such devotees. “Accordingly, the hall which is lying vacant as per the ld. Administrator's report be used as the office for redevelopment,” the court said. The court was dealing with a bunch of pleas concerning redevelopment of the temple premises. It had earlier ruled that the occupants of the dharamshalas and pujaris cannot claim a vested right to remain in the temple premises. It had also directed the Delhi Police to proceed with the eviction of unauthorized occupants of jhuggis and dharamshalas present in the temple premises. The Supreme Court later refused to interfere in the plea challenging the eviction of the said unauthorized occupants of Jhuggis and Dharamshalas. Previously, the Court had slew of directions regarding the administration and maintenance of the temple as also for resolution of disputes pertaining to the bari rights between baridaars to ensure smooth functioning of the temple.

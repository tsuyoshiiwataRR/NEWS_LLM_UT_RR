    "text": "CV NEWS FEED // CatholicVote Friday launched a campaign calling on the Catholic faithful to petition the offices of two New York prosecutors to prosecute the anti-Catholic “transgender” activists who deceptively gained entry to St. Patrick’s Cathedral last week.\nThe advocacy organization is encouraging concerned Catholics to reach out to the offices of both New York Attorney General Letitia James and New York County District Attorney Alvin Bragg via phone, email, and social media.\n“We urge you to act quickly and resolutely to address this grave injustice, the very sort of vicious abuse that New York’s Hate Crimes Act was designed to prevent,” Burch wrote in a pair of letters sent to both\nJames and Bragg on Tuesday.\n“New York’s\ncourts have recognized that those who gain access to property by deception are liable for criminal trespass,” the CatholicVote president emphasized.\nIn addition, CatholicVote is encouraging the faithful to pray the Fatima Prayer for Reparation and the Conversion of Sinners.\n>> DEFEND OUR CHURCH FROM THE MOCKERY IN MANHATTAN <<\n“The outrageous sacrilege perpetrated at St. Patrick’s Cathedral is indeed a hate crime,” CatholicVote President Brian Burch\nnoted in a statement earlier this week.\n“Will law enforcement officials act?” he asked:\nThey mocked our saints. They mocked our prayers. They danced in the aisles and desecrated a cathedral that was paid for with the contributions of thousands of poor, faithful Catholic immigrants.\n“On Thursday, February 15, a crowd of LGBTQ activists held a funeral for Cecilia Gentili at the historic St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City, New York,” CatholicVote then\nreported. “Gentili was ‘a transgender activist and actress, former sex worker and self-professed atheist,’ according to the New York Times.” >> DEFEND OUR CHURCH FROM THE MOCKERY IN MANHATTAN <<\nCatholicVote’s previous reporting also detailed the event’s deceptive nature:\nCeyenne Doroshow organized the funeral and said he did not mention Gentili’s “transgender” identity when he planned the funeral with the church.\n“I kind of kept it under wraps,” Doroshow said, according to the Times. Doroshow explained that Gentili’s friends “had wanted the service to be at St. Patrick’s because ‘it is an icon, just like her.’”\n>> DEFEND OUR CHURCH FROM THE MOCKERY IN MANHATTAN <<\nThe Pillar\nhttps://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/about-that-funeral-what-happened Monday that the gathering “packed the cathedral with more than 1,000 mourners, many of them LGBT activists or presenting themselves as transgender.”\nDuring the service “a eulogy described the deceased as a ‘great whore, St. Cecilia, the mother of all whores,’” The Pillar added:\na rendition of “Ave Maria” sung during the liturgy was interrupted by a mourner who shouted “Ave Cecilia,” and danced down the aisle.",

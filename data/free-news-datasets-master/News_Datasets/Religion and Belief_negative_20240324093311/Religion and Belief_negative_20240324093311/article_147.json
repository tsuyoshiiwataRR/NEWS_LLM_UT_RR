    "text": "The subpoena issued by the Senate against Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) founding leader Apollo Quiboloy has been formally served.\nA photo shared to reporters by the Office of Senator Risa Hontiveros on Friday showed the subpoena was officially received by KOJC counsel Atty. Marie Dinah Tolentino on Thursday, February 22, 2024, at 1:30 p.m.\nThe subpoena ad testificandum was prepared on February 14 and was signed by Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri on February 19, Hontiveros' office earlier said.\nThe subpoena was issued after Quiboloy skipped the hearing of the Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations and Gender Equality, which is probing the alleged abuses being linked to KOJC.\nQuiboloy earlier said he will not submit himself to the Senate inquiry and would only face the allegations against him before the courts.\nHontiveros has warned Quiboloy that he would be arrested if he fails to attend the next Senate hearing.\nIn a voice message posted on social media earlier this week, Quiboloy accused the United States government, with the help from Philippine officials, of plotting to eliminate him.\nThe controversial religious leader is facing various cases in the US, including trafficking and bulk cash smuggling.\nThe House of Representatives has also issued a subpoena against Quiboloy, directing him to appear before the congressional inquiry into the call to revoke the franchise of Swara Sug Media Corporation, which runs and operates Sonshine Media Network International (SMNI). â€”KBK, GMA Integrated News",

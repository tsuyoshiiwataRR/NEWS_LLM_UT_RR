    "text": "A man of cloth accused of swindling over Sh50,000 from unsuspecting members of the public over a Sh1billion real estate deal gone sour will cool his heels in police custody awaiting a decision by the court on whether to free him on bond or not.\nBut six lawyers defending Bishop David Kariuki Ngari alias Guyo of Chosen Calvary, who was arrested at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) while enroute to Zambia read mischief in the detention plea.\nThe lawyers say “he is being detained so he does not attend the much publicised two-day Benny Hinn crusade at the Nyayo Stadium. The crusade is slated for February 24/25, 2024”.\nThe Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has, however, exonerated the authorities from blame.\n“The respondent (Bishop Ngari) was arrested following a hue and cry from members of the public who say they have lost billions of shillings,” state prosecutor Henry Kinyanjui told magistrate Geoffrey Onsarigo at the Milimani law courts.\nMr Kinyanjui told Mr Onsarigo that police got intelligence information that the bishop was about to leave the jurisdiction of the court and then tracked him down.\nHe confirmed the pastor was arrested at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) as he was about to exit the country, casting doubt on the narrative he was to attend the crusade.\nMr Kinyanjui stated the suspect in the Sh1 billion multi-billion investment scam had got wind that he was being sought by police over the mega financial fiasco.\nHe was then detained upon being arrested while enroute to Zambia’s capital Lusaka for a supposed private visit.\n“The suspect was escaping from justice before his moves were curtailed by police at JKIA,” added Kinyanjui.\nThe magistrate heard that the arrest of the suspect was not due to religious and political reasons but “because of the mega fraud”.\nThe court heard investigations into the supposed scam have been ongoing for five years and are “at an advanced stage”.\nThe court further heard that the case of “great public interest” as millions of shillings were lost.\n“The DCI is investigating the suspect for offences of money laundering, obtaining through pretenses, and stealing,” Kinyanjui told the magistrate.\nThe prosecutor added:“ There has been a public outcry from victims and other affected persons over the funds lost and or allegedly stolen by the respondent and other companies associated with him to wit Ekeza Sacco Society Limited, Gakuyo Real Estate, and Gakuyo Investors Club.”\nBut lawyers Njiru Ndegwa, Danstan Omari, Shadrack Wambui, and Latifa Habib Omari pressed for the release of Bishop Ngari saying “he was not absconding”.\nAlso read: Betika sponsors six golfers at the 2024 Magical Kenya Open\nAll eyes on Chairman’s Cup as Nairobi Polo season draws to a close",

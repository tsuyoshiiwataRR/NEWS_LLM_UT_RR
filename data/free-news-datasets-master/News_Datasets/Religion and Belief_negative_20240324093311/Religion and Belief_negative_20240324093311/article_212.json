Earlier\n——– Suffolk police are investigating after a man went to the Islamic Center of Melville on Wednesday, and walked into a building where he began filming while demanding the release of hostages seized in the Hamas attack on Israel in October. In the Wednesday incident, the man, according to the clip obtained by News12, continues to film the inside of the building even as members of the mosque challenged him. When members of the mosque called Suffolk County police, officers arrived, spoke with him, and let him go, News12 reported. Leaders of the mosque told News12 that they didn’t think police took the incident seriously enough. But Thursday, officers from the department’s hate crimes unit returned to the mosque, News12 reported, and mosque officials said they thought the matter was being handled more thoroughly. The building where the outburst occurred is being used temporarily until construction is complete on the mosque.",

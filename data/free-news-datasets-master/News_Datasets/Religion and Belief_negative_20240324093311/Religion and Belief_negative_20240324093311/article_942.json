    "text": "Earlier this week, Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill, 2024, was approved by the Legislative Assembly. The opposition BJP-JD(S) combined defeated a bill that sought to collect funds from temples with over Rs 10 lakh annual income in Karnataka legislative council on Friday. The move comes as a setback to CM Siddaramaiah-led Congress government that was formed last May. Earlier this week, Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill, 2024, was approved by the Legislative Assembly. However, it faced defeat on Friday via a voice vote in the Upper House, where the opposition holds a majority, according to a report on PTI. One of the key provisions of the bill entailed levying a five percent charge on temples with a gross income between Rs 10 lakh and less than Rs one crore, and a 10 percent charge on temples with income exceeding Rs 1 crore. These funds are designated for a Common Pool Fund overseen by the 'Rajya Dharmika Parishath' aimed at supporting the welfare of priests and maintaining 'C' category temples (state-controlled) with an annual income below Rs five lakh. The act that was previously amended in 2011 stipulated that five percent of the net income from temples with an annual income ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh, and 10 percent from temples earning over Rs 10 lakh annually, would contribute to the fund. This amendment sparked significant controversy, particularly drawing ire from the opposition, notably the BJP. They accused the ruling Congress of attempting to fill its financial resources at the expense of temple funds. Conversely, the Congress countered by alleging that the saffron party had initiated a similar amendment in 2011 to secure funds from high-income Hindu temples.

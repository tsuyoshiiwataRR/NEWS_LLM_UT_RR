    "text": "Welcome to the peak of clown world, where our justice system even briefly entertains\nthis type of laughable madness:\nA transgender inmate serving a 55-year sentence for strangling [his] 11-month-old stepdaughter to death filed a civil lawsuit against the prison chaplain for allegedly prohibiting [him] from wearing a hijab outside [his] immediate bed quarters, despite identifying as Muslim.\nThe killer in question, Jonathan C. Richardson, now identifies as \"Autumn Cordellionè.\" He apparently initially identified as Wiccan, but at some point decided to identify as \"an Islamic practicing transwoman,\" necessitating the use of a hijab.\n(Definitely a very womanish Muslim, no doubt.)\n\"[I] was told that male Muslims could wear their kufis everywhere they went, but I couldn't wear my hijab a females religious head ware because I was a male residing in a male institution even though I am a transgender woman, except in my bed area,\" Cordellionè alleged in the complaint.\nRichardson claimed that the prison chaplain \"violated [his] Eighth Amendment rights against cruel and unusual punishment;\" he further claimed he was the victim of \"harassment and ridicule\" by other Muslim prisoners. (I'll bet!)\nThe convicted murderer is also \"suing the Indiana Department of Corrections for not granting [his] wish to get sex reassignment surgery.\" Naturally the activist freaks at the ACLU are representing him in that suit, because of course.\nHere is a thought from the comment section that might be helpful in resolving this situation:\n ",

    "text": "Rajasthan Education Minister Madan Dilawar said Hindu girls were being force to offer ‘Namaaz’ in the Kota school. (Photo: X)\nRajasthan Education Minister Madan Dilawar has suspended two Kota-based government school teachers and initiated an inquiry against a third for their alleged involvement in religious conversion, love jihad, and ties to banned jihadi outfits.\nThe suspension orders of the teachers, posted at a school in Kota’s Sangod block, were issued on Thursday night by the Kota education officer (secondary).\nMinister Madan Dilawar released a video statement on the matter and said, “In the Khajoori village of Sangod panchayat samiti in Kota district, the religion of a girl in senior secondary school was mentioned as ‘Islam’ in the transfer certificate of a girl despite her being a Hindu. A conspiracy of religious conversion and ‘love jihad’ is happening there. Hindu girls are being forced to offer namaz. This has come to our notice.”\nExplaining the reason behind his move, he said, “As soon as this was brought to my notice, I decided to take strict action against three teachers. In this context, I suspended two teachers – Firoz Khan and Mirza Mujahideen. Further action is being taken against one Shabana. All three of them have been sent to Bikaner. I will take strict action against them after a detailed investigation. If needed, I will expel them.”\nThe minister ordered action against the teachers after a local group, Sarv Hindu Samaj, Sangod gave him a memorandum on the matter.\nAccording to a report in The Indian Express, the memorandum also alleged that three teachers have connections with banned outfits and that they had links to Pakistani groups. The memorandum also stated that an FIR had previously been registered in this regard at Sangod police station, but no action was taken.\nThe suspended teachers were identified as Mirza Mujahid and Firoz Khan, the report mentioned.\nLove jihad’ is a term often used by right-wing activists to allege a ploy by Muslim men to lure Hindu women into religious conversion through marriage. All three teachers have been ordered to report to the directorate of education, Bikaner during this period, as per the order.",

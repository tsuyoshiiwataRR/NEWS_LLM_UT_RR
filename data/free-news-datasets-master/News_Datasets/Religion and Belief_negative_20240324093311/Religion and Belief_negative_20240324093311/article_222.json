Picture: Getty By Kit Heren\n@yung_chuvak Four people have died and dozens are missing after a fire tore through an apartment block in Spain.\nListen to this article Loading audio... Firefighters rushed to the scene of the fire in Valencia, Spain's third-largest city, after a fire broke out in a 14-storey apartment block in the Campanar neighbourhood, on the edge of the city centre.\nTerrified residents could be seen trapped on their balconies waited to be rescued by the authorities. Firefighters were able to lift two residents from one of the balconies using a crane.\nBut several more did not survive. A local official confirmed the death toll, saying: \"The worst hypothesis is confirmed: four people dead\".\nThe remaining 19 missing people may all have died too, but authorities will not be able to confirm this until later on Friday, when firefighters are able to get inside the buildings.\nSome 14 people were injured - six of them firefighters - most with fractures, burns and smoke inhalation. Twelve of them were treated in hospital overnight.\nA firefighter works at the scene during the building fire. Picture: Getty A huge fire has engulfed an apartment block in Valencia, Spain.

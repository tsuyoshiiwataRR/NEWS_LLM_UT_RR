    "text": "An Indian zoo was ordered to change lions’ ‘blasphemous’ names after complaints from a hardline Hindu organisation. The pair of animals are named Sita, after a Hindu goddess, and Akbar, after a Mughal-era emperor. But a court in West Bengal ruled their names must be changed following complaints from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or World Hindu Council, which had argued calling one of the lion’s Sita had caused “great anguish”. The group also objected to plans to keep the five-year-old lioness in the same enclosure as Akbar, given the same title as the 16th-century Mughal emperor of India. The VHP is linked to Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government, which has been routinely accused by critics of promoting a pro-Hindu agenda and discrimination against India’s minority Muslim population. “You could have named it Bijli [lightning] or something like that. But why give names such as Akbar and Sita?” Justice Saugata Bhattacharya of the West Bengal High Court said during a hearing held on Thursday. He asked a lawyer representing West Bengal’s state government in the case whether he would name a pet of his own after a Hindu God or Muslim Prophet. “Why should you draw controversy by naming a lion after Sita and Akbar?” Justice Bhattacharya added, before directing officials to rename the creatures. The VHP said in its filing to the court that the naming of the lion as Sita amounted to a “direct assault on the religious beliefs of all Hindus”. “She is the consort of (Hindu God) Lord Ram and herself is a sacred deity to all Hindus across the world,” the group said. “Such an act amounts to blasphemy and is a direct assault on the religious beliefs of all Hindus.” The group added that it had received complaints from Hindus spread across India over the name and the plans to let the lioness live alongside Akbar. “Sita and Akbar cannot be allowed to live together,” VHP spokesperson Vinod Bansal said. West Bengal’s authorities said the animals were given their names by a previous zoo in Tripura, northeastern India, several years before the creatures were transferred to their new home.",

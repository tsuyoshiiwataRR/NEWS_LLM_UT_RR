    "text": "POLITICO reporter Heidi Przybyla took to MSNBC on Thursday to express her disdain over the fact that Trump supporters do not believe that rights are gifts granted to citizens by the [state](https://thenationalpulse.com/tag/victoria-nuland/) but rather by God. Przybyla, 50, said: “The one thing that unites all of them — because there’s many different groups orbiting Trump — but the thing that unites them as [Christian](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/02/19/megan-rapinoe-somebody-needs-to-check-on-christians-theyre-not-okay/) nationalists, not [Christians](https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/12/01/19-ags-object-to-biden-wh-proposal-that-could-ban-christians-fostering-children/) by the way, because [Christian](https://thenationalpulse.com/2023/08/28/tucker-biden-hates-hungary-russia-for-being-christian-nations/) nationalists is [sic] very different, is that they believe that our rights as Americans, as all human beings, don’t come from any earthly authority. They don’t come from Congress, they don’t come from the Supreme Court. They come from God.” Observers familiar with the Declaration of Independence and the history of the founding of the United States of America were quick to point out that the idea “that our rights as Americans… come from God” is the very basis on which the country was founded. The Declaration of Independence states: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.” Ms. Przybyla did not mention if she was familiar with the Declaration of Independence. Here [@MSNBC]helpfully makes it clear their disdain for Christians in America. She says that if you believe that your rights come from God, you aren’t a Christian, you are a Christian nationalist. Somehow they seem to not mention that our own founding documents make this… [pic.twitter.com/WTLMqcqTzg] — Wade Miller (@WadeMiller_USMC) [February 23, 2024]",

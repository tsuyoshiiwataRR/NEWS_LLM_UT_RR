( [WAFF](http://www.waff.com/)) - Students at Oakwood University are in mourning after the loss of sophomore student Jeavonn Barracks. In a release, [Oakwood University says Barracks was hospitalized after a “swimming incident” at the school’s natatorium.](https://www.waff.com/2024/02/23/oakwood-university-student-dies-after-swimming-incident/) It was announced Friday that Barracks passed away. Students and school officials gathered Friday evening at the Eternal Flame located between the Blake Center and the Eva B. Dykes library for a prayer vigil in Barracks’ honor. Barracks’ fellow students and professors said a few words on what he meant to them. Multiple prayers were shared for the family and girlfriend of Barracks. He was a pre-med student with plans to attend medical school. His classmates, including junior Gevenson Yllste, described him as a musician and a gentleman. ”I really think that he was a inspiration to other young men like how to be a man, how to be a man of character, how to be a man of integrity. I think that’s something that we’re really going to be missing here at Oakwood,” said Yllste. The university says they will be providing counseling services for students and staff during this time of grief.

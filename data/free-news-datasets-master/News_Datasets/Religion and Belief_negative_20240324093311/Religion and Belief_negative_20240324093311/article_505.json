    "text": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) usually only criticizes others’ sartorial decisions to make a political point – like when she [attacked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/insulting-marjorie-taylor-greene-gop-153011996.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGRoqVUxy5rJ1otqhA_yDgx9ubM0yeMBpHIXPbz-c3H84pC6t0MLglnnD-_SkxByDXujdCMKZJToToSIMIHlBY6vaCAUiJjXYoiXRi4pxCxBKlTu1X-suLqx3_K1ngggvooUoTiINIL_7eAMdCNab0ukeb3v7p52j96Dze3DY5vI) and [Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA)](https://news.yahoo.com/john-fetterman-dings-marjorie-taylor-034537301.html) for not dressing formally enough – but now she’s offering unsolicited advice to “conservative Christian women, who are influencers or leaders.” She’s telling them that they are responsible for ensuring that men don’t have impure thoughts about them.

    "text": "New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Friday refused to grant permission for prayers at the Akhoondji mosque, which was recently demolished, and the nearby graveyard in the Mehrauli area of the national capital on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat (the night of atonement) in which Muslims seek forgiveness from Allah for their sins and those of their ancestors. Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav refused to grant permission while hearing a plea moved by the Managing Committee of the Delhi Waqf Board. The High Court noted that it has directed the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to maintain the status quo on the land till the next date of hearing. The High Court earlier had ordered to maintain the status quo while hearing a plea filed by Waqf Board, which earlier submitted before the High Court that a “600-year-old” Akhoondji mosque was demolished by the DDA without giving any notice to the mosque management. The DDA demolished the Akhoondji mosque and the Behrul Uloom madrasa on January 30 after these structures were declared as illegal structures in Sanjay Van. The Waqf Board counsel submitted before the court that the demolished mosque was several centuries old and prayers were being offered at the mosque for last many years. An active graveyard was also there used by the locals and worshippers whose families are buried in the graveyard should be allowed to offer prayers at the graveyard on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat. The High Court observed that the main petition on the issue of demolition in which the present application was filed, has been heard by the court on several occasions and is already listed for final disposal on March 7. “At this stage, the court is not inclined to pass any directions. The application is dismissed,” the High Court ordered. The Waqf Board had moved the High Court challenging the demolition of the mosque and later for maintaining status quo, saying that the demolition carried out by the DDA was illegal and that it was not given any notice by the DDA before carrying out the demolition exercise. The High Court had on January 31asked the DDA to explain the reasons by filing its reply for demolishing the mosque and state whether any prior notice was given to the management committee of the mosque before the demolition. The DDA has defended the demolition of the mosque, saying it was carried out pursuant to the January 4 recommendation of Religious Committee.

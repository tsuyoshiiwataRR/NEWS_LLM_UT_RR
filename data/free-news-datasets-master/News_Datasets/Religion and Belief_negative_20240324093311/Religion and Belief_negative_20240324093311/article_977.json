    "text": "When checking in on the benevolence of God, what about things like cancer? It seems to me to be a stretch of the imagination that all forms of cancer are entirely natural. Except for the likelihood that they are natural consequences to our unnatural actions. By using the word ‘unnatural’ here I’m referring to things like the continued use of dangerous chemicals and substances that are known to cause cancer, as an example. We inflict most cancers upon society by our own actions, nearly all of them are preventable. There are also cancers which would occur via nature, even without our deliberate choice to include harmful substances in our food, medicines, products, or in the air we breathe. But those could be resolved as well with greater cooperation among us. So, even those cancers become an unnatural consequence of our societal divisions. Every single form of health concern would benefit from greater unity in society. I think God is waiting for us to figure that out. We frequently mistake the suffering we personally experience to be punishments against us. Which means when we cannot connect the dots on the suffering of a child to its own actions, we too quickly conclude that God either created that suffering, or did nothing to prevent it. But what if God understands entirely why that suffering has occurred and is choosing to allow us to clean up our own mess so that we learn from it rather than simply punishing us; which would make it so that we are unable to associate the suffering with our own actions? God would certainly know that we have to learn from our mistakes. Benevolence in this instance, would mean the withholding of interference, in order to allow that learning to take place. Punishing a dog five hours after it poops in the living room, and through methods it cannot connect to the behavior in the first place, will not benefit its training. If God wants us to learn, It would know this, for the same is true in people too. Are prayers then ineffective? I can’t believe that they are. I’d conclude that prayer is an important part of the action of connecting with the Divine during our trials, so that they are perhaps more comprehensible to us, or so that we can find comfort in our grief. They may even serve to energetically intervene in how the events unfold, so long as it doesn’t interfere in our growth but instead boosts it through the confirmation of our faith. This brings us to our philosophy on forgiveness—and the existence of Hell also, for that matter. How does a benevolent God administer forgiveness? This is interesting to me, because as I see it, all existing notions on the subject are deeply flawed. I think that true benevolence precludes the idea that God even needs to forgive us in the first place. Consider for a moment the practice of asking God’s forgiveness for something that we have been taught is an offense to It. Confession, contrition, and repentance are actions which, according to Catholics anyway, is the process for earning God’s forgiveness of mortal (serious) or venial (not so serious) sins. What might God’s position on that be? If we hold that God is all-knowing, meaning It knows our hearts and therefore knows the pain which precedes our harmful actions, is God understanding of even our most severe actions? The notion that God exists in a state of unforgiveness until we go through the theatre of asking for It to change Its view of us feels contradictory to the parts of scripture which describe God otherwise. Benevolence is not said to be conditional. It is portrayed as a universal sentiment of the Divine spanning all of creation. Benevolence supersedes even the notion of a perpetual Hell. Where is the benevolence in the idea of eternal punishment? The opposite must be true, that forgiveness is not for us to ask from God, but rather to ask God for help in forgiving ourselves and others. God’s benevolence, if real, must dictate that we are divinely pre-forgiven and that only our own lack of forgiveness stands in the way of the joy for which we were designed. If God knows our hearts, It knows why we do the things we do. It understands us in a way that we cannot. God encourages us to see ourselves with the same magnificence that is Its own view. The idea of God needing to go through the motions of forgiving us is simply a transference of our human shortcomings onto the Divine. Benevolence does not require God to pose for a time as an angry parent waiting for an apology. This is my case for a belief in a benevolent God. There are likely so many holes in my rationale that an army of trucks could drive through them. And of course absolutely none of this might be true in any way. Which leaves us with the possibility that perhaps those of us who think these things do so just to feel better about something that feels so out of our control. But I can live with that.

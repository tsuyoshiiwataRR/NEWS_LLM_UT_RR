    "text": "“Unacceptable”: Shehu Sani Reacts As Muslim Cleric Calls for the Killing of Tinubu’s Wife - Shehu Sani has condemned the statement made by a Muslim cleric against the personality of the First Lady, Oluremi Tinubu - Sani maintained that the cleric's call for the killing of Senator Remi Tinubu is unacceptable and should be condemned - Reacting to Sani's statement on his social media page, many Nigerians urged President Bola Tinubu to immediately arrest the cleric Legit.ng journalist Esther Odili has over two years of experience covering [political parties](https://www.legit.ng/1197958-full-list-political-parties-nigeria-leaders.html) and movements. Former Kaduna Senator [Shehu Sani](https://www.legit.ng/tags/shehu-sani/) has reacted after an Islamic cleric declared that Nigeria's First Lady, [Oluremi Tinubu](https://www.legit.ng/nigeria/1577247-hard-times-tinubus-wife-sends-message-hope-nigerians/), deserves to die for being a pastor. [Sani](https://www.legit.ng/tags/shehu-sani/) condemned the statement by the cleric and maintained that criticising the government and its policies is the right of the citizens, but calling for the death of a First Lady is \"utterly unacceptable.\" In a video that has gone viral, shared on X on Wednesday, February 21, a cleric is heard saying the [Muslim/Muslim ticket](https://www.legit.ng/politics/1577377-amid-nigerias-economic-turmoil-sheikh-jingir-reaffirms-support-muslim-muslim-ticket/) that brought President [Tinubu](https://www.legit.ng/tags/bola-tinubu/) to power was a scam.

He, however, did not provide any chapter or verse of the Quran to support his claim. \"Now, Tinubu @officialABAT, his wife is an #infidel. Even as an infidel, she is an 'oga' (a leader) among the infidels. Even her, God's judgement says she must be killed.. She's a pastor... Leaders of infidels (Christianity), Allah says they must be killed,\" The Muslim cleric said. Shehu Sani condemns the words of the Islamic cleric Reacting, Shehu Sani in [a post](https://twitter.com/ShehuSani/status/1760648759048867906) shared on his X account on Thursday, February 22, faulted the cleric's assertion. Sani tweeted: \"Criticising the Government and its policies is within the ambit of democratic rights;but Calling for the killing of Senator Remi Tinubu by the religious cleric is unacceptable and utterly condemnable.\" Watch the video below See the video below as the Islamic cleric says Tinubu's wife deserves to be killed. Muslim-Muslim ticket: Sharia Council slams Tinubu’s govt In another report, [Legit.ng reported](https://www.legit.ng/politics/1574206-sharia-council-slams-tinubus-govt-admits-regret-backing-muslim-muslim-ticket/) that President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has been critiqued by the Supreme Council for Sharia in [Nigeria](https://www.legit.ng/nigeria/) (SCSN). The organisation has accused President [Tinubu](https://www.legit.ng/tags/bola-tinubu/) of marginalising them since he assumed office in May 2023. President Tinubu has, however, responded to their complaint by summoning an emergency meeting with their leaders.

    "text": "Former Hillsong Church global senior pastor Brian Houston said that his X (formerly Twitter) account was hacked after the comment “ladies and girls kissing” was\nposted late Tuesday evening (Feb. 20) at 11:48 pm.\nHouston’s odd post, which has since been deleted, caused many social media users that read his post to speculate that he had mistaken his X post for a Google search—implying that he might have been searching for sexual content.\nAt 11:57 pm, Houston posted, “I think my Twitter may have been hacked.” That post also has been deleted.\n“Don’t mix your Twitter with google searches,” one person replied, while another said, “[Some] one that hacked Brian Houston’s and then allowed him to recover it in 16 minutes.”\nRELATED:\nHot Mic Catches Bobbie Houston Telling Brian To ‘Hook’ Audience To Donate to New Online Church\nAlthough many of Houston’s critics weren’t buying his account being hacked claim, on Wednesday Houston shared a message from someone claiming to be his assistant, who reiterated that Hillsong Church’s former pastor’s X account was indeed hacked.\n“Thank you for your concern, Ps Brian’s assistant here! Rest assured we are working on discovering how Ps Brian was hacked,” Houston’s assistant\nwrote. “Our team has ascertained that someone logged into his account from a location within the USA. We’ve changed his password so here’s hoping they no longer have access.”\nHis assistant then said to ignore posts that appear to be “out of the normal” for the pastor and said that for “your safety remember Pastor Brian does not contact anyone privately. Thank You!”\n[@BrianCHouston] [pic.twitter.com/qVFUu6KZME]\n— Yolanda (@yolandamariee23)\n[February 21, 2024]\nRELATED:\nFormer Hillsong Pastor Brian Houston Plans To Start a New Church in 2024",

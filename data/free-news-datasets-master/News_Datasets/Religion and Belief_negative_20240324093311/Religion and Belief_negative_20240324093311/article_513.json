    "text": "This diary is directed at (1) my previous fundamentalist church, Denton Bible Church and (2) fundamentalist churches in general. This diary is not a diatribe against other people of faith, especially not against my fellow democrats. If I offended my fellow Kossacks who are democrats while being people of faith, I am truly sorry as this was not my intent. I will share as I have before here how I ended up with them. I had an extremely painful childhood that led to suicide attempts and self-harm in middle school. That has never left me. I still struggle with self-harm and it's bad. I know that this is what led me to fundamental Christianity. I literally took a Bible and burned it (I lived on my own) and said, 'God if you exist which I doubt, then come down and do something about it ' Six months later, in my dorms, my next door neighbor shared the fundamental gospel and I became a fundamentalist born again Christian and I started going to Denton Bible Church. I am appalled by the fact that they were notified about this in 1999 and did nothing substantive about it until 2019, 20 years later. In addition, it is awful that after having relieved Shiflet of his duties because of what they saw, Tommy still wrote a recommendation letter for him and this led to more victims and then after he was fired from the other church, let him preach again at their church. They sent this guy to Dallas Theological Seminary. Their strawman definition of woke is so stupid, it's not worth the words to show how stupid they are except to point out that Charlie apparently doesn't understand that chattel slavery was real in the United States. Woke as I understand it simply means you are aware of the ugly history of bigotry in this country and the structural discrimination that still exists in addition to people who are bigots. And I fail to see how anybody on Earth 1.0 can deny these obvious truths. They cannot abide people who are not white straight men being equal with white heterosexual men. They just can't. I just learned within an hour of writing these very words that my previous fundamentalist church and its elders failed to protect young girls and despite bright warning lights chose not to act. There are many victims in this story. Denton Bible Church grew from a dozen people meeting in buildings they rented to a reasonably large church to a very large, fundamentalist, Calvinism, dispensational church. In graduate school, I moved from fundamentalist Christian and republican to independent to democrat having left fundamentalism by late 2005 to progressive democrat. When I was a fundamentalist, I can hardly begin to tell you how much I admired the senior pastor. He is extremely smart, was a starting quarterback at a division 1 university who was extremely strong physically and as a marathon runner in excellent condition, charismatic, and a gifted speaker. He earned a graduate degree from Dallas Theological Seminary, but his knowledge of the Bible is as deep as anybody in the country. He avoided charismatic and health, wealth, and prosperity errant theology. He studied and taught word by word, phrase by phrase, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, chapter by chapter through each book of the Bible. He only rarely taught on topics. Even though I disagree with him profoundly, I didn't expect to learn that my old church would have had a child molester on staff. I wrote previously about how I was pretty certain that he had given a speech from the pulpit at a church meeting endorsing Donald Trump and warning against former Secretary Hillary Clinton whom he said would fundamentally change the country. I wrote that although I couldn't find that message, I found a video of him teaching from the pulpit during a church service celebrating the win of Donald Trump and explaining how the Bible taught essentially a completely unregulated free market capitalism among other things. I found something even more explicit. I also found him railing against 'wokeness' and making other statements that simply made me feel sick. I am going to present some news stories exposing the fact that they had a child molester on staff. I will present a lot of one victim's statements. I will also share some stories on him speaking on political issues he doesn't understand. From the Dallas Morning News, a MAJOR newspaper . Denton megachurch pastor retires a year after report alleged church ignored signs of abuse Senior pastor Tommy Nelson led Denton Bible Church for decades. Last year, his church was accused of failing to adequately respond to sexual abuse allegations against their now-convicted former youth pastor. Tommy Nelson, the longtime senior pastor of Denton Bible Church, announced his retirement earlier this month exactly a year after a FOX 4 report alleged his church ignored red flags of abuse by a former youth pastor. Nelson is also a bestselling author of several books on marriage and family. Nelson shared news of his retirement in a letter sent on Oct. 4. “A church like Denton Bible Church needs to always be, to always exist,” he wrote to congregants. “A church that is fundamental, premillennial, Calvinistic, dispensational, discipleship-focused, elder ruled, complementarian, and ‘non-woke’ must continue.” Denton megachurch pastor retires a year after report alleged church ignored signs of abuse Senior pastor Tommy Nelson led Denton Bible Church for decades.

While they had heard troubling stories long before then, the most they had done was confront him directly. One time, they asked him to write an apology letter to a child… which he didn’t do. In 2005, they revoked his ordination, a punishment that means next to nothing outside his church bubble. (He was still able to get a job at another church after that.) They never went to law enforcement. Nelson’s report in May, summarizing the investigation Nelson’s report in May, summarizing the investigation, admitted the church failed to recognize the warning signs, didn’t prioritize care for the victims, and created an environment where abuse could thrive… but all of that was a superficial apology. It suggested everyone was doing everything they could, but they simply didn’t know any better. Now one of the victims has spoken with FOX 4 in order to talk about the church’s failures. “You know what frustrates me the most about this story? Is the number of times we’ve been told, ‘We did not know what to do,’” the victim said. “I don’t have words for that. I don’t think you need a seminary degree to know what to do. You need to do the right thing. Take care of the victims and report to police and [Child Protective Services].“ One of the bombshells? ..

Roy's Report Shiflet worked at Denton Bible Church from 1996 to 2001. He then served as youth pastor at Fellowship Bible Church in Little Rock from 2001 to 2003. According to a five-page summary of the independent investigation’s findings released in May, youth workers told Denton Bible leadership, including Nelson, about Shiflet’s inappropriate behavior as early as 1999. When speaking to The Roys Report (TRR), she called Nelson’s statement in May “incredibly selfish and calloused.” “It is the role of a pastor to shepherd the flock of God,” the woman, who requested we call her “Deborah,” told TRR. “He lacked remorse, lament, and a sense of brokenness. Systemic injustice was perpetuated by egotistical narcissists and cult-like behavior at this church. I know that sounds harsh, but all the victims’ experiences have been nothing short of an abomination.” Nelson claimed that prior to 2005, he had never heard the word “pedophile.” He added that the betrayal by Shiflet—someone Nelson had personally mentored— .After he was fired in Arkansas, Shiflet went back to Denton and was invited to speak at the church.

Here's the real danger according to Tom Nelson: being woke Tommy Nelson, the 70-year-old senior pastor of Denton Bible Church and a conference speaker, says, “I have been in the ministry almost 50 years, and [wokeness] is the most insidious and dangerous and pervasive ideology that I have ever seen in all of my life, in all of my ministry. And it is dangerous to the Christian church as well as to our culture.” Charles Stolfus, the church’s associate pastor, told a local newspaper, “Wokeness describes the belief among some who claim to have been ‘awakened’ to the idea that American society is so irredeemably racist that it must be overthrown through moral, political and economic revolution. It is an insidious belief system that holds that America is a nation founded on white supremacy and oppression and that these forces must be rooted out by any means necessary.” Instead of viewing people “as individuals created in the image and likeness of God,” says Stolfus, wokeness categorizes them by groups, “whether male or female, black or white, gay or straight [and] then as either an oppressor or as an oppressed individual according to their group identities.” The movement also “favors the normalization of the LGBTQ identity,” he says.

Leaders of a Denton, Texas, church were conflicted when the church distributed a flyer endorsing specific city council and mayoral candidates in September. At first, Denton Bible Church posted on social media that the Johnson Amendment was known to be unconstitutional (it’s not) and that no church has been “punished” for violating it (also not true – for instance, a New York church lost its tax-exempt status after AU reported it to the IRS for publishing a newspaper ad opposing Bill Clinton for president in 1992). After the endorsements received media attention, Denton Bible Church backtracked and issued a statement that claimed the flyer didn’t go through the proper review process and shouldn’t have been distributed. But the church went ahead and sponsored a political campaign rally featuring Allen West, chairman of the Texas Republican Party, and Jeremy Dys, a lawyer for the Christian nationalist law firm First Liberty.

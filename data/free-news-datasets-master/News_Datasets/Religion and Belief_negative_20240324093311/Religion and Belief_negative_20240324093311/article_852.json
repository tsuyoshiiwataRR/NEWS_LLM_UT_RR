    "text": "Hundreds of Muslim institutions and mosques across Canada have penned an open letter letting federal government officials know they are not welcome in their spaces ahead of Ramadan unless they condemn the Israel-Gaza war. The joint call, spearheaded by the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM), is asking the federal government to help the innocent Palestinian civilians being killed in Gaza, especially ahead of the upcoming Muslim holiday. “The Muslim community throughout our country is deeply affected by the loss of all innocent life, including the tens of thousands of our brothers and sisters in Gaza who have fallen victim to the collective punishment imposed upon them by the Netanyahu government,” the letter [reads](https://www.nccm.ca/ramadan2024/). “Millions more are at risk of death due to indiscriminate bombardment, the targeting of hospitals, systematic starvation, and the proposed military operation in Rafah that Canada, Australia and New Zealand have said would be catastrophic,” it continued. According to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/world/middleeast/gaza-death-toll-israel.html), 29,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since October 7, 2023, most of whom are women and children. The call to action also states that places of worship have always welcomed elected MPs from all parties during Ramadan to connect with Canadian Muslims, but this time is different. “As our hearts break for the people of Palestine, we renew our commitment to upholding the ethics of our sacred month,” the letter said. In fact, these groups are asking politicians to commit to a list of demands before they can be welcomed in mosques again. FIVE DEMANDS TO MPS - Condemning the war crimes being committed by Israeli forces; - Supporting an immediate ceasefire urgently needed to protect civilians sheltering in Rafah and beyond; - Demanding the immediate resumption of funding for UNRWA, a lifeline for millions of refugees which was suspended without reasonable basis; - Opposing the flow of arms and military equipment to the Netanyahu government, which, as confirmed by the ICJ, is engaged in plausible genocide; and - Standing in defence of civil liberties, including the right of Canadians to express solidarity with the Palestinian people without fear of reprisal. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has since weighed in on the letter. “I’m going to continue to visit with Canadians right across the country to engage with communities, particularly the Muslim community that is hurting because of what’s going on on the other side of the world,” he [told CBC’s](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/muslim-mps-gaza-unrwa-1.7121789) Wendy Bergfelt on Mainstreet Cape Breton. The letter also comes after Trudeau was booed by worshippers both inside and outside a mosque last year. Ramadan’s official start date is Mar. 10 and ends on Apr. 9.",

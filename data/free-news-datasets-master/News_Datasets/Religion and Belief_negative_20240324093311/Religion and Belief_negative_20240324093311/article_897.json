    "text": "A Connecticut church pastor charged with dealing crystal meth out of his church's rectory fled court on Thursday and local police are seeking his re-arrest.\nHerbert Miller, 63, the reverend of the Woodbury United Methodist Church, was arrested earlier this month after being pulled over by state troopers in Woodbury.\nThe reverend attended Waterbury Superior Court court on Friday morning for his arraignment but walked out of the court around 10am during a break.\nWhen Miller could not be located the prosecutor re-issued a warrant for his arrest.\nMiller was stopped by state troopers who observed he was operating his vehicle with a suspended registration.\nHe was found in possession of crystal methamphetamine in both rock and liquid form, the latter of which was discovered in a hypodermic needle, ready for injection.\nMiller may have been hawking meth in exchange for watching gay couples have sex, the New York Post reported.\nThe allegation was reported by a local outlet, though neither the Post nor the Daily Mail have been able to independently verify the claim.\nThe police were reportedly tipped off about Miller's alleged illegal side hustle and apprehended him with the help of a cooperating witness who helped facilitate a drug deal.",

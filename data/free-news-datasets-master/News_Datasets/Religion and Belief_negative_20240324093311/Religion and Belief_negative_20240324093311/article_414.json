    "text": "MK Simcha Rothman (Religious Zionism) a member of the Knesset's Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee, participated in a panel on fighting antisemitism at a Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) event in Washington. When asked about the demands for the creation of a Palestinian state, Rothman responded that there is a \"direct connection\" between a Palestinian state and antisemitism. \"The events of October 7 have only proven what everyone in the State of Israel already knew: Antisemitism has not been eradicated. The idea of creating a Palestinian state will endanger not only the State of Israel, but the citizens of the entire world, and it will be a direct prize for terror,\" he explained.

The Palestinian Authority, which did not condemn, even once, the events of October 7? Whose officials have called the massacre a 'morning of victory, happiness, and pride?' \"To speak about a Palestinian state after October 7 is not idiocy but pure evil towards the Jewish nation. With its founding, antisemitism will not disappear - it will only grow worse,\" he warned.",

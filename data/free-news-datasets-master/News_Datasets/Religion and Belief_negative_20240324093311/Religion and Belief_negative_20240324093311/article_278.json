    "text": "President Trump vows to “restore the timeless truth that God created TWO genders” at NRB Convention in Nashville, because evangelicals, and Israel is the capital of Israel; who knew? xTrump has put his audience to sleep. You could hear a mouse farting in this room right now. pic.twitter.com/FC9IdLDzKa— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 23, 2024 Trump moved the US Embassy to Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv (the capital of Israel), against the advice of all US policy experts, who warned this is an incendiary move in that Jerusalem is a holy site for 3 religions. Trump did this because Sheldon Adelson paid his PAC $30M. xTrump quickly wraps up his speech without his usual ending. That was really something. pic.twitter.com/MRynZKSJb5— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 23, 2024 The continued demographic decline makes it clear that the MAGA goal of reestablishing their vision of a white Christian America can’t be realized by democratic means. But as I explained in my most recent posts, I’m deeply concerned that the embrace of Christian Nationalism by nearly two-thirds of white evangelicals and a majority of the Republican Party will spawn more theological monstrosities justifying anti-democratic schemes to achieve this end. www.whitetoolong.net/… In other words, conservative populism, with all its antidemocratic implications, has taken root in America.

Trump goes for quantity, not quality with motions to dismiss xTrump goes for quantity, not quality with motions to dismiss https://t.co/H9mKV1blBC— Joyce Alene (@JoyceWhiteVance) February 23, 2024 In the Southern District of Florida federal criminal case against Trump before Judge Cannon, Trump just filed a motion claiming absolute presidential immunity for stealing classified documents at Mar-A-Lago essentially arguing to Judge Cannon that not only did he telepathically declassify sensitive national defense info when in office (eg nuclear weapon info, war plans, foreign govt weapons system) and with no paper trail but he then also converted this national defense info into his own personal property under the Presidential Records Act (which actually says the opposite of what Trump claims) such that not only are America’s most sensitive documents magically declassified placing our military and foreign assets in danger, but that the documents now belong to Trump personally and not the United States and therefore he should get absolute presidential immunity for his telepathic declassification and personal seizure of national defense info because it fell within the outer perimeter of his official duties.

That's not a thing.Judge: I designated that diamond necklace \"personal\" and I took my \"personal diamond necklace\" home with me without paying when I left Tiffany's. pic.twitter.com/tNQmyFGwyZ— Pièce de Résistance (@PieceDeReSister) February 23, 2024 Legal experts were quick to rail against the filings online. Regarding the motion seeking to dismiss the counts based on presidential immunity, national security attorney Bradley P. Moss said, the motion \"is insultingly stupid.\" \"Trump is arguing he designated all these highly classified records as PERSONAL records, and that he therefore had the right to keep them,\" Moss said. \"Even if that was a plausible argument, this is a motion to dismiss: he can’t introduce new facts.\" www.rawstory.com/...

    "text": "Hilary Swank and Alan Ritchson hit the red carpet for their cheesy little religion flick.\nThey look like two complete strangers heading to two different events who were inexplicably asked to pose with each other on the way.\nHILARY SWANK IN VIVIENNE WESTWOOD\nWe’ve seen this dress a million times before and even a casual fashion observer can peg it as a Westwood on sight. Still, that’s no complaint; not when the dress suits her so well. She looks great in it, but we wonder if she’s not the one who missed the vibe of the event by getting so formal.\nALAN RITCHSON\nOrange Hulk. We get that he had to bulk up tremendously for the Reacher series, which is basically about a guy who solves problems by being really, really big, but we thought he looked better without about 40 fewer pounds of muscle on him. Having said that, his clothes are nicely fitted, if somewhat casual. Given the nature of this film, he’s avoiding getting too fancy in his style choices. They’re fine. But good God, that’s a lot of bronzer.\nStyle Credits:\nVivienne Westwood Off-the-shoulder Dress | Fred Leighton Jewelry | Manolo Blahnik Shoes\nHilary Swank\nStyled by Thomas Carter Phillips | Hair by DJ Quintero | Makeup by Fabiola\nABOUT THE MOVIE:\n– Based on a remarkable true story, ORDINARY ANGELS centers on Sharon Stevens (Hilary Swank), a fierce but struggling hairdresser in small-town Kentucky who discovers a renewed sense of purpose when she meets Ed Schmitt (Alan Ritchson), a widower working hard to make ends meet for his two daughters. With his youngest daughter waiting for a liver transplant, Sharon sets her mind to helping the family and will move mountains to do it. What unfolds is the inspiring tale of faith, everyday miracles, and ordinary angels.\n– Starring Hilary Swank, Alan Ritchson, Nancy Travis, Tamala Jones, and Amy Acker.\n– Only in theaters February 23, 2024.\n[Photo Credit: Marion Curtis/StarPix for for Lionsgate/INSTARimages – Video Credit: Lionsgate Movies/YouTube]\nStyle File: Carey Mulligan and Adam Sandler at the Berlin International Film Festival 2024Next Post:\nPlease review our\nCommunity Guidelines before posting a comment.

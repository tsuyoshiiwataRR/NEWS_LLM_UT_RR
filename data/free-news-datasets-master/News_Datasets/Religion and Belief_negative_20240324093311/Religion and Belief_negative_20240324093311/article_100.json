    "text": "\nBelvedere College, Dublin\nTHE Provincial of the Jesuits in Ireland said this week that it was a “source of deep shame” that his order had failed to take action against a priest and teacher, now dead, who was the subject of 93 complaints of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse.\nThe Society of Jesus released a narrative report, Fr Joseph Marmion SJ: His abuse, the harm caused, and Jesuit accountability, earlier this month. It documents the complaints, from the 1940s and subsequent decades. Fr Marmion died in 2000.\nThe report sets out how the order responded to the allegations. It also names, for the first time, two other priests who were also the subject of numerous complaints of child sexual abuse, and who continued to work with children.\nOf the 93 complaints against Fr Marmion, 65 relate to his time teaching at Belvedere College, Dublin; 14 to Crescent College, Limerick; and 14 to Clongowes Wood College, Co. Kildare. Half were allegations of child sexual abuse.\nThe Provincial, Fr Shane Daly, said that it was a “source of deep shame” to discover that, when the allegations of abuse were first reported, the order had placed “the reputation of the order and the person accused” above the well-being of the complainants. “As was said before, things were done that should never have been done, and things that should have been done were not.”\nFr Marmion’s former pupils had been “horrifically abused”, he said. He paid tribute to them for their “courage and generosity” in coming forward. A redress scheme by the three Jesuit colleges concerned was announced in 2022.\nThe two other priests named are Fr Paul Andrews and Fr Dermot Casey, both directors of St Declan’s Special School and Child Guidance Centre in Dublin. Fr Casey died in 1997 and Fr Andrews in 2018.\n28 Apr 2023\n16 Jun 2023\n05 Jan 2024\n15 Dec 2023\n15 Sep 2023\n20 Sep 2023\n23 Feb 2024\n21 Feb 2024\n16 Feb 2024\nSneering at a new Live Aid show has political repercussions, argues Paul Vallely\nCalling for innovation!\nThe Bishop of Chichester is looking for an incumbent with the drive and pastoral heart to pursue the presence of Jesus within these rural villages.\nThe Bishop of Fulham seeks to appoint a Priest-in-Charge for the Benefice of St Alphage Hendon (Burnt Oak)\nWe are a vibrant all-age family who love Jesus and are characterised by our diversity in worship, from the traditional BCP Eucharist to more informal contemporary band led services.\nFind more jobs\n11 March 2024 | 6pm GMT\nAn expert panel discusses trust between the media and the public\nOnline Tickets available\n26 - 28 April 2024\nSee the full programme on the festival website.\nEarly bird tickets available\nClosing date: 30 June 2024\nRead more details about the awards\n ",

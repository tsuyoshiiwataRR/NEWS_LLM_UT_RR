    "text": "Obituary: Day, James (Jim) Martin James (Jim) Martin Day, 76, of Little Hocking, OH, passed away peacefully at his home on February 20, 2024. He was born in Middletown, NY, a son of the late Frank and Edna (Martin) Day. James dreamed of being a truck driver since the age of 5, and he was able to fulfill his dream. He retired from truck driving, a job he loved, after 52 years. James was a good man who loved his wife. In fact, he once told her that the only competition she would ever have was his love for motorcycles. He served honorably in the Army and was a Vietnam Veteran. James is survived by his wife Rosie Day, one son James Day of Farmington, Missouri, two daughters Michelle Williford of Missouri, Meredith Clinger of St. Genevive, Missouri and step-sons Oren and Lincoln Echard of Little Hocking, OH. Thank you to the hospice staff for being there and for your support. A special thank you to whom he called his angel, Keeley Johnson, and his friend and chaplain, Ryan Clegg. There will be no visitation or memorial services. Jim has already said his goodbyes and saw those he wanted to see. Rosie would like to say thanks to her special sister, Brenda Miller, for all of her help, support, and just being there for comfort. Arrangements entrusted to Leavitt Funeral Home, Belpre.

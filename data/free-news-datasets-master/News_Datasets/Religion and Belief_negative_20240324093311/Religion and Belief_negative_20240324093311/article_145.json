    "text": "Taking a break from ignoring her day job, Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeted a warning to Christian women to stop tempting Christian men. It seems that she is a proponent of the Madonna/Whore dichotomy. Greene believes women can aspire to exemplary morality, but they are shameless Jezebels at heart. Her view of her sex must be engendered by the company she keeps. How delightfully biblical. She also adopts the exculpatory, fundamentalist, religious belief that men are not responsible for sexual sins. Maturity is supposed to give men self-control. And many men take responsibility for their behavior. On the other hand, Christian men ‚Äî or at least the ones Greene hangs with at the gym and in Congress ‚Äî apparently lack the maturity for self-regulation and must rely on women to be the adults in the room. To start her tweet, Greene acknowledges that what she is about to say is stupid ‚Äî although she armors herself against the expected and deserved scorn by anticipating it. \"This might be an unpopular opinion and could hurt some feelings.\" \"This might be an unpopular opinion and could hurt some feelings.\" She then gets to the meat of the matter and the subject of her advice ‚Äî consequential women who lack the agency to make their own decisions and instead conform to a global push to reduce women to objects. \"There are many conservative Christian women, who are influencers or leaders, that are selling themselves short and not being good role models by conforming to the world‚Äôs sexualization of women.\" \"There are many conservative Christian women, who are influencers or leaders, that are selling themselves short and not being good role models by conforming to the world‚Äôs sexualization of women.\" In case you missed the point, she repeats and expands on it. \"If you are conservative and a Christian you know you don‚Äôt have to express yourself in sexual ways and you know you are attractive by dressing nice and feminine, and you can be beautiful and modest at the same time.\" \"If you are conservative and a Christian you know you don‚Äôt have to express yourself in sexual ways and you know you are attractive by dressing nice and feminine, and you can be beautiful and modest at the same time.\" This advice raises the question: Is Greene practicing what she preaches? It is a rhetorical question. I will not comment on Greene‚Äôs looks ‚Äî beauty is in the of the beholder ‚Äî but I wonder which of her fashion choices and behaviors could be considered ‚Äúmodest.‚Äù She is fond of showing off her armpits. Yelling like a fish-wife during the State of the Union. Chasing down and berating the survivors of school massacres. Calling her female colleagues ‚Äúlittle bitch.‚Äù And showing porno in Congress. She then says that women adopting the demure, shrinking-violet persona she recommends, will experience an immediate increase in respect from men. Because women being quiet served them so well for so long. \"Men will respect you more and think of you much more highly than just a sexual object for gratification.\" \"Men will respect you more and think of you much more highly than just a sexual object for gratification.\" She then reiterates her admonishment to women that it is their responsibility to ensure men keep it in their pants. \"It‚Äôs also good to not tempt your Christian brothers and cause them to stumble. As conservative Christian women let us always be an example to girls and young women by displaying actions that our faith believes and not conform to the patterns of this fallen world.\" \"It‚Äôs also good to not tempt your Christian brothers and cause them to stumble. As conservative Christian women let us always be an example to girls and young women by displaying actions that our faith believes and not conform to the patterns of this fallen world.\" She must be talking from experience, as she was once ‚Äî I have no data on whether she still is ‚Äî a seductress leading decent men astray. Just ask the polyamorous tantric sex guru Craig Ivey and gym manager Justin Tway. Two men who, through no fault of their own, were sucked into an adulterous sewer of lust, libido, and lifting. Poor dears. Greene is not known for her grasp of reality. But for her to think she has the moral standing, history, expertise, or common sense to lecture others on how to behave is low even for her. But looking like a fool has never slowed her roll. She ends with a dollar-store aphorism ‚Äî it beats having an original thought. \"Be the light, don‚Äôt fall into the darkness.\" \"Be the light, don‚Äôt fall into the darkness.\" Allow me to translate that from Greenish to English. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be like me.‚Äù Here is the tweet: This might be an unpopular opinion and could hurt some feelings.There are many conservative Christian women, who are influencers or leaders, that are selling themselves short and not being good role models by conforming to the world‚Äôs sexualization of women.If you are‚Ä¶‚Äî Marjorie Taylor Greene üá∫üá∏ (@mtgreenee) February 22, 2024 This might be an unpopular opinion and could hurt some feelings.There are many conservative Christian women, who are influencers or leaders, that are selling themselves short and not being good role models by conforming to the world‚Äôs sexualization of women.If you are‚Ä¶",

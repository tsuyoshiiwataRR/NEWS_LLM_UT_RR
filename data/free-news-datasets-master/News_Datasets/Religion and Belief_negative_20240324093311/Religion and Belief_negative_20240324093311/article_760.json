    "text": "James “Jim” Novotny, age 72, of Roseau, MN, passed away Tuesday, January 16, 2024, at his home. A Celebration of Life will be held on Saturday, March 2nd, 2024, at the VFW Post #9317 in Mantador, ND at 3pm. Inurnment will be held at a later date at St. Paul Lutheran Cemetery near Mooreton, ND. Arrangements have been entrusted to Helgeson Funeral Home in Roseau, MN\nJames Charles Novotny was born October 11, 1951, to James and Helen (Hejtmanek) in Breckenridge, MN. He grew up on a family farm in Mandator, ND and attended grade school in Mantador, ND, graduating from high school in Hankinson, ND in 1969. Jim enrolled at NDSCS in Wahpeton, ND where he graduated in 1972 with an Associate of Science in Architectural Drafting.\nJim was united in marriage to Victoria (Vicki) Lynn Johnson on October 29, 1972, at Bethel Lutheran Church in Wahpeton, ND. Shortly after as a member of the US Army, Jim was assigned to Nuremberg, Germany where he and Vicki resided for 5 years. In 1977 Jim and Vicki moved from Germany to Breckenridge, MN where they celebrated the birth of their first daughter Christina Lynn. In the winter of 1979 Jim and Vicki moved to Roseau, MN, where Jim and Vicki welcomed two more children, Amanda Kay in 1980 and Seth Gordon in 1983.\nJim worked as the service manager for both Roseau Farm Service and Roseau Diesel before taking the leap into self-employment in 1988. Novotny’s Overhead Doors became recognized in the Roseau Community, especially when his “milk” van dropped his three children off at school. Jim was a reliable, honest, and all-around asset to the community he called home. Jim’s son Seth has taken on the legacy that Jim left and is operating Novotny’s Overhead Doors still today in Roseau, MN.\nAfter leaving the Army Jim enrolled in the Roseau Army Reserve and was a Staff Sargent for more than 20 years. In addition to serving his country, Jim joined the Roseau Volunteer Fire Department and spent many years serving his community.\nJim and Vicki built a lovely home on 3rd Ave, that was bustling with kids, friends, family, and a cat named Bonkers who, legend has it, was named even before “Bonkers” was a candy.\nEveryone belonged at the Novotny’s house, Jim and Vicki made sure of it. In 2001 Jim and Vicki lovingly welcomed Jamie Everett, followed by Ryan Thorson in 2008, and later Brittany Nosbusch.\nWhen Jim’s kids were not making trouble in the early years, they were living life and making Jim and Vicki proud. This applied to the next generation as well. Jim and Vicki could not be prouder of their three beautiful granddaughters, Emma, Hannah, and Ava Everett.\nJim is preceded in death by his parents Helen and James Novotny, his beloved wife, Victoria and brother-in-law Gary Gabbert. Jim is survived by his children Christina (Jamie) Everett of Fargo, ND, Amanda (Ryan) Thorson of Ottertail, MN and Seth (Brittany) Novotny of Roseau, MN. As well as his granddaughters Emma Everett (Brandon Miller), Hannah Everett, and Ava Everett all of Fargo, ND. Jim is also survived by his brother Clifford (Marie) Novotny, and his sisters Shirley (Art) Heley and Dorothy Gabbert.\nGuestbook URL: https://www.helgesonfuneralhome.com/obituary/JamesJim-Novotny",

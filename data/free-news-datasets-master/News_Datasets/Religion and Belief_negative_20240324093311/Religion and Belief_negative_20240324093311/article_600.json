    "text": "Well-Wisher Visits Woman in Viral Exorcism Video by Kikuyu Pastor, Asks Kenyans to Pray for Her - A controversial exorcism video shook social media as a woman underwent bizarre prayers where she was touched indecently by a pastor - Evangelist Eve Nungari, who was moved by the distressing video, decided to visit the woman at the centre of the viral exorcism - The philanthropist reached out to the woman and found her in anguish and humiliation following the public spectacle of the exorcism video A well-wisher on Facebook has visited the woman in the viral exorcism video that has taken social media by storm. The woman was captured receiving [prayers](https://www.tuko.co.ke/facts-lifehacks/messages-quotes/531148-prayers-show-appreciation-helped-you/) in a very bizarre manner after a controversial pastor known as bishop Johana touched her indecently during the moment of prayer. Philanthropist Nungari visits woman in viral video Taking to her social media, Evangelist Eve Nungari, also a philanthropist, visited the woman and found her in a very distressing situation. PAY ATTENTION: Have a story to tell? Need expert advice? Feel free to reach out to us through askanexpert@tuko.co.ke. Nungari first learnt that the woman had been suffering in her marriage from a neighbour who sent her an anonymous message, and she visited the bishop for prayers, hoping to salvage her union Nungari's Facebook follower, who is the viral woman's neighbour, intimated that she had been told that the bishop helps mend broken marriages and did not expect things to turn up the way they did. Nungari visited the woman and found her in pain over the manner in which she had been left humiliated after the viral video. \"I have just visited the woman. The pain is unbearable. And for the sake of her little children. Let's remember her in prayer. Thank God she doesn't have a smartphone. It could have been worse, guys. Mama Gifts friends. God bless you,\" she said on Many Kenyans also empathised with the woman who has been trending for all the wrong reasons. Bishop Johana defends himself The [Kikuyu](https://www.tuko.co.ke/261705-funny-kikuyu-proverbs-meaning.html) pastor has been under heavy criticism on social media, [and he also defended himself ](https://www.tuko.co.ke/people/538930-viral-kikuyu-pastor-defends-bizzare-exorcism-video-claims-helping-woman/)after the viral clip emerged. The viral video showed Bishop Johana, touching a woman inappropriately under the guise of praying and exorcising an alleged demon, and it left many Kenyans with a bad taste in their mouths. In an interview with Kururia TV, the pastor insisted he should be allowed to carry out his supposed spiritual activities without criticism online. Source: TUKO.co.ke",

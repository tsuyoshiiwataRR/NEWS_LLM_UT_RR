    "text": "A video of Akorino bishop identified as Johanna, aka Danson Gichuhi, recently went viral on social media platform showing him delivering what he refers to as a ‘blessing’ to a female congregant.\nIn the video, Bishop Johana is seen engaging in what many have described as inappropriate behavior, as he touches a woman congregant in question and applies ointment to various parts of her body, including her stomach and private areas, while she lies on her back.\nIn a related development, controversial pastor Paul Mackenzie is still in police custody in relation to his controversial sermons which attracted many women, children, and men.\nThese two incidents suggest the exploitation of individuals, including women, within religious contexts can occur for a variety of reasons.\nHowever, it is crucial to emphasise that it is not inherent to faith itself.\nInstead, it often stems from societal, cultural, and institutional dynamics.\nHere are some reasons why exploitation of women in faith settings may occur:\nGender Stereotypes\nStereotypes about women being more emotional or intuitive might contribute to the perception that they are more easily swayed in matters of faith.\nHowever, it’s essential to recognize that these stereotypes are not universally true for all women.\nPower Imbalance\nReligious institutions and leaders often hold significant power and authority over their followers.\nThis power dynamic can create opportunities for exploitation, as individuals may feel pressured to comply with the teachings or directives of religious leaders, even if it goes against their best interests.\nLack of Education and Information\nIn some religious communities, women may have limited access to education and information outside of their faith traditions.\nThis lack of access can make it difficult for women to recognize and challenge instances of exploitation or abuse.\nMisinterpretation of Religious Texts\nReligious texts and teachings can sometimes be misinterpreted or manipulated to justify exploitation or abuse.\nThis can be particularly problematic when religious leaders claim divine authority for their actions and teachings.\nSocialisation\nIn many cultures, women are traditionally encouraged to be more nurturing, empathetic, and emotionally expressive.\nThese traits might lead some to believe that women are more susceptible to persuasion or manipulation when it comes to matters of faith.\nAlso read: Ruto’s stadium pledge at Kiptum’s send-off\nKenyan woman arrested in India in suspected gold smuggling case",

    "text": "By [Ben Chapman ](https://www.gbnews.com/authors/ben-chapman) Published: 23/02/2024- 10:09 Updated: 23/02/2024- 10:12 Don't Miss Most Read Trending on GB News Reform UK leader Richard Tice has called for Sharia Law to be made illegal. Discussing the rise of ‘religious sectarianism’, Tice warned Islamist extremists have a legitimate chance of being elected to Parliament and the British judicial system must get ahead of the game by banning the practice of Sharia. Sharia is Islam’s legal system and acts as a code for living that all Muslims should adhere to, including prayers, fasting and donations to the poor. Asked by Michelle Dewberry about “extreme Islamists” that have an “extreme ideology about how they want this country to look, operate and run”, Tice said measures must be put in place to avert this. Richard Tice wants Sharia law made illegal GB NEWS “This is where it’s heading”, he said. “I actually think we need a law that explicitly says that no one can conduct, in any walk of like in the UK, Sharia Law, because that is where this is heading. “We want to keep religion out of politics because otherwise you see sectarianism. “But then what happens generally is it ends in extreme tension, extreme divisions, violence and death. “We should keep it out of our politics, out of our democracy.” Offering a counter point on GB News’s Dewbs & Co was Novara Media’s Aaron Bastani, who suggested Islamists getting elected could be a positive thing. Rishi Sunak is concerned about extremists influencing matters in ParliamentGB News “I think extreme political positions generally need to be mediated through the democratic process”, he said. “If they’re not, it tends to be very bad news. Maybe it’s not so bad to have an Islamist MP because the reality is, those ideas, those individuals are then tested by the democratic system. “If they fail, they get the boot. This is why, for instance, the BNP [British National Party] won two members of the European Parliament in 2009. “I don’t think that’s a bad thing because if they don’t perform, their ideas are revealed as not particularly effective.” It comes amid fears for MP safety sparked by stances on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle is now clinging onto his job over his handling of the Gaza ceasefire debate which he says was down to his concerns about MPs’ security. Rishi Sunak on Thursday warned that it was a “slippery slope” to let “extremists intimidate us into changing the way in which Parliament works”.",

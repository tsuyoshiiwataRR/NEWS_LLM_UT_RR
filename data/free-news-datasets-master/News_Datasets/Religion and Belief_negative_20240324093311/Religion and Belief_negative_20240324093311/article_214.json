    "text": "“And that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, And those who fear Your name, small and great, And should destroy those who destroy the Earth.” -Rev. 11:18 Bill Gates, ever the demented snake oil salesman, has long argued in favor of a bizarre plan to fight global warming by using experimental geoengineering to partially block the sun’s rays from reaching Earth. Well, he’s apparently about to get his wish. Scientists plan to begin pumping chemicals into the sky over the next few weeks and months from several countries around the globe, including the U.S., Australia and Israel. The idea, [promoted by](https://slaynews.com/news/cbs-news-pushes-bill-gates-plan-fight-climate-change-blocking-sun/) Gates and leftist billionaire [George Soros](https://slaynews.com/news/george-soros-pushes-plan-fight-climate-change-blocking-sunlight/), involves pumping manmade white clouds containing chalk dust and other chemicals into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight away from the Earth’s surface. Blocking the sun’s light would allegedly lower the planet’s temperature enough to reverse global warming. Never mind that fruit trees and vegetables require sunlight in order to grow and produce food for the masses. Not to mention, sunlight is the primary source of critical Vitamin D, an essential nutrient for human immunity. Gates, a known eugenicist who goes around giving talks about how we need to reduce the global population, likely sees these dark possibilities as exciting side effects of the nefarious sun-blocking plan. Soros is similarly excited about the plan. He says the technology will help to prevent ice from melting in Greenland, which he claims could doom human civilization. How ironic that the very globalists who are doing everything in their power to destroy human civilization claim to be worried that global warming might speed up the process. Globalists like Bill Gates and George Soros are doing harm to the environment through their genocidal climate agenda on multiple levels. They advocate blanketing our fertile farmland with toxic solar panels, while filling more acres of farmland with wind turbines that kill birds and other wildlife. They also push electric cars which run on toxic lithium batteries that are going to create an environmental nightmare in the years ahead because, like with the solar panels, there’s no way to safely dispose of them. Chloe Aiello of Inc. magazine reported on February 13, 2024, that a [Bill Gates-Backed Startup Just Raised $145 Million to Source Lithium-Ion Batteries for Electric Vehicles](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/smallbusiness/this-bill-gates-backed-startup-just-raised-145-million-to-source-lithium-ion-batteries-for-electric-vehicles/ar-BB1ihVhg). Much of the lithium mined in the world today is done on the backs of child labor in poor countries of Africa and Asia. But don’t tell that to Bill Gates, George Soros, Larry Fink and their buddies at the World Economic Forum. Despite their destructive plans, these globalists insist they are our saviors and we should look to them for answers on how to live a sustainable lifestyle. Please. About the devious sun-blocking formula, Soros said: “Our civilization is in danger of collapsing because of the inexorable advance of climate change. The melting of the Greenland ice sheet would increase the level of the oceans by 7 meters. That poses a threat to the survival of our civilization.” Of course this is all nonsense meant to stoke fear. A fearful population will beg for solutions to the imaginary problem, inviting their own enslavement. More than 20 years ago, Al Gore made the exact same dire predictions about ice melting, polar bears dying, hurricanes increasing, and whole cities being submerged in water. None of these apocalyptic predictions have materialized. According to a report by [Slay News](https://slaynews.com/news/bill-gates-plan-fight-climate-change-blocking-sun-begins/), the tactics advocated by Bill Gates involve spraying aerosol concentrations into the stratosphere to reflect solar radiation away from the Earth. Gates has been funding a major project at Harvard using balloons to deploy aerosols. The Harvard project was shut down following public backlash. But now, the Wall Street Journal is [reporting](https://www.wsj.com/science/environment/geoengineering-projects-cool-planet-weather-f0619bf7) that another group of scientists has been advancing Gates’ idiotic and, frankly, dangerous plan. Marine Cloud Brightening is a research project led by Southern Cross University as part of the $64.55 million, or 100 million Australian dollars, Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program. The program involves modifying clouds to make them reflect sunlight away from the Earth to supposedly stop global warming. Slay News reports: “This week, researchers aboard a ship off the northeastern coast of Australia near the Whitsunday Islands started spraying a briny mixture through high-pressure nozzles into the air in an attempt to brighten low-altitude clouds that form over the ocean. “Scientists hope bigger, brighter clouds will reflect sunlight away from the Earth, shade the ocean surface, and cool the waters around the Great Barrier Reef.” In Israel, another startup called Stardust Solutions has begun testing a system to disperse a cloud of tiny reflective particles about 60,000 feet in altitude. These geoengineered clouds reflect sunlight away from Earth to cool the atmosphere in a concept known as solar radiation management. And, in Massachusetts, researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution are preparing to pour 6,000 gallons of a liquid solution of sodium hydroxide, a component of lye, into the ocean 10 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard this summer. Some would argue that “cloud seeding” has been going on for years. Take a look at this shot I took of the sky above my house a few weeks ago. Does the sky in the photo above look normal? With all these chemicals being sprayed above us, what could possibly go wrong? Let’s pray this ill-advised experiment fizzles out before it can do too much damage.",

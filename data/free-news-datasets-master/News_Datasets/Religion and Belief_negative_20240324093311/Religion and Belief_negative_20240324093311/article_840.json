    "text": "OTTAWA: A self-confessed Canadian white nationalist who deliberately ran over and killed four members of a Muslim family with his pick-up truck in 2021 was given a life sentence on Friday with no chance of parole for 25 years. Nathaniel Veltman, 23, had been found guilty of first-degree murder last November for an attack that shocked Canada. He showed little reaction to the decision, the London Free Press newspaper reported. The judge in the case said Veltman’s attack represented an act of terrorism, the first time that the term has been used to describe white nationalist violence. Veltman ran over five members of the Afzaal family, originally from Pakistan, in the Ontario town of London when they were out for an evening walk in June 2021. The victims were Salman Afzaal, 46, his wife Madiha Salman, 44, their 15-year-old daughter Yumnah, and Afzaal’s 74-year-old mother Talat. “We don’t know if it’s closure, or justice. What we do know is that the verdict will not bring back what was stolen,” said Tabinda Bukhari, Salman’s mother. “This trial wasn’t just about one act. It was a stark reminder of the fault lines that run deep within our society,” she told reporters outside the court. It was the worst assault against Canadian Muslims since a man gunned down six people at a Quebec City mosque in 2017.",

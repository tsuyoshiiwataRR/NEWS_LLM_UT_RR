    "text": "The Telegraph Archbishop says factions fighting within church on same-sex marriage are doing 'Devil's work' Read full article Timothy Sigsworth February 23, 2024 at 9:52 p.m. · 3 min read Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, addresses the Church of England General Synod in London - Toby Melville/reuters The Church of England’s infighting factions are doing the “Devil’s work” by seeing each other as their enemies, the Archbishop of Canterbury has said amid an ongoing debate over same-sex marriage.\nThe Most Rev Justin Welby made a call for unity in his opening address at the church’s General Synod on Friday as he said “malign forces” were at work in its divisions.\nHe said Lambeth Palace was regularly deluged by hate mail that was “normally coming from within the church”.\nThe church’s divisions between conservatives and liberals have been brought to the fore in recent years amid a protracted debate over same-sex marriage.\nLast year the church voted to trial blessings for same-sex couples who have had civil weddings or partnerships.\nSame-sex marriage ban Gay couples remain prohibited from tying the knot in church and vicars are not officially allowed to be in civil partnerships, although this rule is not uniformly observed or enforced.\nThe Archbishop said it would be a “very serious mistake” for the church to “put aside” its issues and divisions, however “tempting” that is.\n“The fear and suffering that come from division make us look at other people as our enemies and we have to resist that illusion in faithful and honest community,” he said.\n“Causes of fear, which lead to a sense of enmity, are well-disguised as uncertainty, unpredictability and uncontrollability of life.\n“And like barnacles on the hull of a ship, they attach themselves to make us see other people as our enemies, and that is the Devil’s work.”\nThe Archbishop said he was “convinced” that “all the different groups in the different discussions” were seeking “to live in holy obedience”.\nBut he said the church’s divisions are leading clergy and laymen to speak to each other with “bitterness”, “abuse” and “expressions of hatred”.\n“Someone the Archbishop of York and I met from outside the church said that while they were working on a project for the church they grew to fear opening their emails because of the bitterness and abuse they were subject to,” he said.\nStory continues “At Lambeth, the brilliant member of staff who deals with the endless correspondence that comes in is worn down by the expressions of hatred -- normally coming from within the church.”\nThe Most Rev Welby insisted that he had “no fear” for the future of the church because “God is faithful”.\nTalk of a split Some opponents of same-sex blessings have called for “structural differentiation” that would internally split the church between those who conduct the blessings and those who do not.\nThe conservative Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches (GSFA), which represents a majority of Anglicans worldwide, has said it no longer recognises the Archbishop of Canterbury as head of the worldwide Anglican Communion.\nThe General Synod is meeting in Westminster until Feb 27.\nThere are eight hours set aside in this synod to discuss Living in Love and Faith, the church project which culminated in the proposal of same-sex blessings.\nThe Rev Dr Ian Paul, associate minister at St Nic’s in Nottingham, said the church was “on the brink of a precipice” because of a “civil war” over same-sex blessings, and that the eight hours scheduled to debate it during this week’s five-day synod would produce “more division, more frustration, no more progress”.\n“Fiddling while Canterbury burns doesn’t even capture it,” he said.\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "- On his\nradio program today, religious-right pseudo-historian David Barton stated that fellow Ryan Walters, who currently serves as Oklahoma’s State Superintendent of Public Instruction, is “now running for governor.” Does Barton know something that nobody else does?\n- John Zmirak\nsaysthe purpose of the new documentary “ God & Country” is to “scare Christians into abandoning public witness on moral issues, as The Birth of a Nation helped the Ku Klux Klan scare black Americans away from the polls at elections.”\n- John Amanchukwu\nwears itas a badge of honor when people try to stop him from ranting at school board meetings … just like when Stephen was stoned to death in Acts 7.\n- Mark Burns is\nstill spreadingthe baseless conspiracy theorythat Alex Soros issued a coded assassination threat against former President Donald Trump.\n- Finally, Lance Wallnau likens Trump to the biblical figure Job and\nlashes outat Christians who refuse to support him: “We prayed him into position and he’s the Job going through an American trial right now.”",

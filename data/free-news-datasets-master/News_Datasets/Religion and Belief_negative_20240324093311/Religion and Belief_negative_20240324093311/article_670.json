    "text": "The Assam Cabinet has decided to repeal the Assam Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act 1935, cabinet minister Jayanta Malla Baruah announced Friday night, calling it “a very important step in the journey towards a Uniform Civil Code” in the state. This comes weeks after Uttarakhand became the first state in the country to pass a Uniform Civil Code in its assembly. According to the 2011 census, Muslims make up 34% of Assam’s population, standing at 1.06 crore out of a total population of 3.12 crore. A little after midnight, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma posted on social media, “On 23.22024, the Assam cabinet made a significant decision to repeal the age-old Assam Muslim Marriages & Divorces Registration Act. This act contained provisions allowing marriage registration even if the bride and groom had not reached the legal ages of 18 and 21, as required by law. This move marks another significant step towards prohibiting child marriages in Assam.” Following a cabinet meeting on Friday evening, Baruah, while briefing the media, stated that the main objective of the decision is to move towards a Uniform Civil Code. “The Assam Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act 1935 – on the basis of which 94 Muslim registrars had even now been doing the registration and divorce of Muslim marriages in the state – has been repealed. Today’s Cabinet has removed this Act as a result of which, after today, Muslim marriage registration or divorce registration cannot happen through this Act. We have a Special Marriage Act, so we want all marriages to happen under the Special Marriage Act,” he said. The now repealed Act had authorised the local government to grant a licence to any person, being a Muslim, to register Muslim marriages and divorces, “which have been effected within certain limits, on application being made for such registration”. It also lay down the scope and responsibilities of such registrars. Stating that it is a “colonial act” and “not in line with today’s society”, Baruah tied the decision to the state government’s crackdown against child marriage, as part of which over 4,000 people have been arrested. “Through this, we would also see underage marriages being registered – of boys below 21 years or girls below 18 years. So this is a big step towards us being able to completely eradicate child marriage,” he said. He added that the respective District Commissioners will take custody of the 94 registrars operating under this Act, and that the Cabinet has decided to provide them with a one-time financial compensation of Rs 2 lakh. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has repeatedly said that the Assam government is working towards introducing a UCC, and that it would be the third state after Uttarakhand and Gujarat to do so. At the same time, it has also been working on a bill to ban polygamy, making it a criminal offence. The state government was in the final leg of its anti-polygamy bill and was due to introduce it in the ongoing assembly session. However, last week, Sarma suggested that it was likely to be put on hold for the time being with the state cabinet looking to “align” it with a UCC. Sarma has also previously stated that the state’s tribal communities will be exempt from a UCC.",

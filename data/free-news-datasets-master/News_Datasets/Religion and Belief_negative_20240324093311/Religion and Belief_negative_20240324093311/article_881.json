    "text": "The Assam government has scrapped the Assam Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1935 in a big step towards the implementation of UCC. Guwahati: The Assam cabinet, chaired by state Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, on Friday decided to repeal the Assam Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1935. Assam Minister Jayanta Malla Baruah, while announcing this during a media briefing, stated it to be a very important step in a journey towards the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in the state. Baruah said that a total of 94 Muslim registrars were still doing registration and divorce of Muslim marriages in Assam based on the act. “Towards a journey to the UCC, the Assam cabinet has decided to repeal the Assam Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, 1935 with immediate effect. As many as 94 Muslim registrars were still doing registration and divorce of Muslim marriages on the basis of this age-old act which was prevalent since the British rule in India, but from now onwards, no marriage or divorce will happen through it as it has been repealed,” Baruah said. Baruah said that with the abolition of this act, all marriages in Assam will now happen under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. “From today, the District Commissioners (DCs) of Assam will take custody of the 94 Muslim registrars who were operating under the Assam Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act, and the state government will provide them with a one-time compensation of Rs two lakh each for their livelihood,” Baruah added. Baruah further said that with the decision of the Assam cabinet to repeal the act, the menace of child marriages in the state will be eradicated. “Under the act, we used to see underage marriages with grooms below 21 years and brides below 18 years happening, but now, child marriages will be completely eradicated,” Baruah said. In a midnight post on X, Assam Chief Minister Sarma wrote, “On 23.2.2024, the Assam cabinet made a significant decision to repeal the age-old Assam Muslim Marriages & Divorces Registration Act. This act contained provisions allowing marriage registration even if the bride and groom had not reached the legal ages of 18 and 21, as required by law. This move marks another significant step towards prohibiting child marriages in Assam.” The Assam cabinet’s decision comes a couple of weeks after the Uttarakhand Assembly passed the state’s Uniform Civil Code.

    "text": "Can You Believe It? Teacher Takes Students To Temple To Swear By Deities Over Missing Rs 35 From Purse The Education Department took action against a female teacher in [Bihar's](https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/63-year-old-bihar-man-winning-curd-eating-contest-for-8-years-straight-625631.html) Banka district after she allegedly took all the [schoolchildren](https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/00-kids-fall-ill-after-snake-found-in-mid-day-meal-604021.html) to a nearby temple to make them swear in the name of God when 35 went missing from her purse. \"Authorities acted after the local villagers strongly objected to the teacher's behaviour and created a ruckus in the school premises, seeking punitive action against her,\" sources told Times Of India. Jump To Why teacher took students to temple The incident occurred at a primary school in Asmanichak village in Banka's Rajaun block. The teacher, Neetu Kumari, asked a student to bring a water bottle from her purse. Upon checking her purse, she found Rs35 missing and asked the [students](https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/st-stephens-college-suspends-students-for-not-attending-assembly-netizens-call-move-absurd-627926.html) about it. Since none of them gave a convincing answer, she took them to a nearby temple and asked them to swear by the deities. Teacher transferred amid uproar in village \"The angry [villagers](https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/kutch-villagers-hunt-for-gold-but-find-4500-yo-harappan-civilisation-named-morodharo-627883.html) asked, 'A school is a temple of learning. Here the children are imparted values but in this school, it is the teacher who is trying to prove them to be thieves! Imagine, what must have happened to the mental condition of the students?'\" The local education authorities swiftly ordered her transfer to calm the tension. The Block Education Officer (BEO), Kumar Pankaj, said, \"It is improper to suspect any students and punish them this way.\" He informed higher authorities about the action taken. Teacher denies suspecting students The teacher denied having doubts about any students and expressed shock and dismay at the villagers' reaction. \"I have been teaching at this school for the past 18 years. How can I doubt my own students?\" she asked. The stolen money has not been recovered yet. \"A strong resentment prevails among the local villagers over this incident, and we have called a meeting of teachers and parents on Saturday. We are trying to restore normalcy and ensure such things don't happen in the future,\" said local mukhiya Anupam Kumari.

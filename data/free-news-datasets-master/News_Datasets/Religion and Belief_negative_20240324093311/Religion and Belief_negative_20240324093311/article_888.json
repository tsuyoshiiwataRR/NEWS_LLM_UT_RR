    "text": "- By [Aashish Vashistha](/authors/aashish-vashistha) - Published: Sat, 24 Feb 2024 07:56 AM (IST) - Source:JND In a major setback for the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in Karnataka, the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill 2024, failed to pass in the state legislative council. The bill allowed the government to collect 10 per cent of the income of temples that have revenue worth more than Rs 1 crore. The bill sparked a massive controversy, with the BJP accusing the Congress of implementing ‘Anti-Hindu’ policies. The bill was passed in the state Assembly, however, failed to pass in the legislative council where the BJP has more MLCs than the Congress. There are 30 MLCs from the Congress, 35 from the BJP, eight from the JD(S), and one seat is vacant in the council. The Karnataka government passed the 'Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowment Amendment Bill 2024', mandating the state government to collect 10 per cent tax from temples with income over Rs 1 crore and 5 per cent from institutions with revenues between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore.

    "text": "[Skip to content](#article-body) Haneef Cooper, 39, was taken into custody Thursday night by SEPTA police. He has been charged in connection with four incidents and police are investigating his possible ties to six others. A Northeast Philadelphia man has been charged in connection with a spate of vandalism across the city this week, including at the historic Mother Bethel AME Church and The National Shrine of St. John Neumann, along with several businesses. Haneef Cooper, 39, has been charged with criminal mischief in connection with four incidents of vandalism — spanning from Sunday through Tuesday — including those at the churches, Deputy Police Commissioner Frank Vanore said at a Friday press conference. Police are investigating six other incidents of vandalism in the city that may be connected to Cooper, said Vanore. Cooper was in the area of the Frankford Transportation Center when he was taken into custody at 8:38 p.m. Thursday by SEPTA police Police on Friday did not give a motive for Cooper’s alleged vandalism spree, but said there was no indication it was politically or religiously motivated. Cooper appeared to get around the city using SEPTA subway service, said Vanore. In the early mornings hours on Monday, Cooper hurled rocks and bricks at several establishments across the city, in Northern Liberties, Center City, Old City, and Society Hill, destroying stained glass windows and glass doors, police said. At 6:30 a.m. Monday, Cooper destroyed windows at a Playa Bowls on the 200 block of South 11th Street, in Center City, causing around $1,500 in damage, said Vanore. He also broke windows at the Science History Institute, on the 300 block of Chestnut Street, in Old City, with the cost of the damage estimated at $1,000, he said. Police received the report of the vandalism at the institute Tuesday morning, he said. Mother Bethel AME Church on the 400 block of South 6th Street and The National Shrine of St. John Neumann, on the 1000 block of North 5th Street were also affected. Before dawn Monday, the Mother Bethel church, which has a history of activism since its founding in 1787 , was vandalized, with several windows shattered , including three of the church’s historic stained-glass windows. While police pegged the damage to the church at $15,000, the church’s senior pastor estimated the damage would cost $30,000 due to the specialized craftsmanship required to repair the stained glass. There were no messages associated with or attached to the rocks, the pastor said. At the National Shrine of St. John Neumann , which is housed in St. Peter The Apostle Church, three stained glass windows were discovered shattered around 5:30 a.m. Monday, according to an employee who declined to be identified. The damage was discovered by a priest who was opening the church and preparing for the morning Mass. Unlike Mother Bethel, the church had security footage of the incident, but the footage was “not the greatest,” the employee said. Church officials estimated the damage at $20,000. Only the windows were damaged at the church, the employee said. Neumann’s body is in a glass coffin in the shrine, which is in the lower level of the church, and was not damaged. As with Mother Bethel, there was no message associated with the rocks, so the shrine staff does not see the vandalism as a hate crime or politically motivated, the employee said. A spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia said the damage was discovered Monday and promptly reported to police. Kenneth Gavin said security cameras at the shrine showed one of the rocks going through the window at 5:33 a.m. Monday and landing in the choir section of the building. Police detectives are reviewing security camera footage as part of an ongoing investigation. The six other incidents still being investigated by police includes vandalism at the Beasley building, home of the Beasley law firm, at the 1100 block of Walnut Street, which suffered a broken window. Also, the double pane glass of the front door of the InterAct Theater, on the 300 block of South Hicks Street, was shattered when staff arrived for work Monday, staff said. Police are also investigating if Cooper upturned planters before throwing them into the street at The Touraine, a luxury apartment building on the 1500 block of Spruce Street in Center City, Monday morning. Cooper has previously been charged with incidents of vandalism as far back as 2011, police said. In 2011, Cooper was arrested and charged with criminal mischief and related crimes for throwing paint at the double doors at the southwest corner of City Hall, said Vanore. Cooper also broke parking kiosks at a parking lot managed by the Philadelphia Parking Authority in 2013, he said. Vanore said Cooper also assaulted a police detective in 2016.

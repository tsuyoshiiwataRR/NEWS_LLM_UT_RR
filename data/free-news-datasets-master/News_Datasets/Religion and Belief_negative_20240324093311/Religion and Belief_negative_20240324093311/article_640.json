    "text": "Muslim Cleric Prevented from Delivering Sermons over His ‘Radical Views’ Surabaya. Chaos erupted at Assalam Purimas Mosque in the East Java capital on Thursday evening during a religious event, as a group of individuals disrupted the gathering, preventing the renowned cleric Syafiq Riza Basalamah from delivering sermons due to his alleged \"radical and divisive views.\" The arrival of Muslim preacher Syafiq Riza Basalamah drew protests from GP Ansor and Banser, the youth wings of Indonesia's largest Muslim organization Nahdlatul Ulama. A brawl ensued between GP Ansor and Banser members and the followers of Syafiq before he could commence his sermons. Asyiqun Nahdli, a GP Ansor member, clarified that the group was not against the religious gathering itself but against a cleric with a history of promoting radical views being allowed to speak at the event. “We have voiced opposition since the beginning and everyone agreed in a signed document that [the cleric] will not come here. The signing of the agreement was witnessed by the police and district leaders. But they don’t keep their promise,” Asyiqun said. The incident sparked intense discussions on various social media platforms. Afif Fuad, another GP Ansor member, pointed out on his X account that in previous sermons, Syafiq had discouraged his followers from befriending people of different faiths. Additionally, Fuad claimed that the cleric prohibited his followers from saluting the national flag and singing the national anthem. Contradictorily, videos on Syafiq's YouTube account showed him delivering sermons next to a small Indonesian flag on his desk. In one video, the 46-year-old cleric refrained from making statements about the recent presidential election, asserting that \"democracy is invented by humans to create hostilities and hatred.\" However, Syafiq participated in the Feb. 14 election and posted a video showing him casting his ballot at a polling station in Jember, East Java. Following the Surabaya incident, Syafiq took to Instagram, saying, \"May Allah give guidance to our friends who may not possess the understanding and goodwill.\" He apologized to his followers for canceling the sermon due to the chaotic situation and assured them of future meetings. \"My apologies for the inconvenience caused,\" he wrote.Tags: POPULAR READS [News](/news)3 hours ago [A GP Ansor member said Syafiq had discouraged his followers from befriending people of different faiths.](/news/muslim-cleric-prevented-from-delivering-sermons-over-his-radical-views) Muslim Cleric Prevented from Delivering Sermons over His ‘Radical Views’ [News](/news)3 hours ago [Retno said Israel’s withdrawal must neither be done with pre-conditions nor subject to any negotiations.](/news/israel-must-withdraw-now-indonesia-tells-un-court) Israel Must Withdraw Now, Indonesia Tells UN Court [News](/news)4 hours ago [Novel allegedly cut the amount of reimbursements paid to employees who were assigned to official trips.](/news/kpk-launches-internal-probe-into-alleged-misappropriation-of-official-travel-funds) KPK Launches Internal Probe into Alleged Misappropriation of Official Travel Funds [News](/news)5 hours ago [Begum married a Dutch man fighting for IS and had three children, who all died.](/news/is-bride-loses-appeal-over-removal-of-her-uk-citizenship) IS Bride Loses Appeal over Removal of Her UK Citizenship [News](/news)8 hours ago [The Central Java Regional Police's Narcotics Unit confiscated 52 kilograms of crystal methamphetamine and 35,000 ecstasy pills](/news/central-java-police-seize-52-kg-of-meth-allegedly-linked-to-drug-lord-fredy-pratama) Central Java Police Seize 52 Kg of Meth Allegedly Linked to Drug Lord Fredy Pratama Popular Tag Most Popular [ 1 Researchers Investigate First-of-its-Kind Tornado in West Java ](/news/researchers-investigate-firstofitskind-tornado-in-west-java) [ 2 Bank Indonesia Vigilant as Rice Prices Surge Ahead of Ramadan and Eid ](/business/bank-indonesia-vigilant-as-rice-prices-surge-ahead-of-ramadan-and-eid) [ 3 Meta Says It’s Not Required to Pay for News Content in Indonesia ](/tech/meta-says-its-not-required-to-pay-for-news-content-in-indonesia) [ 4 Apple Vision Pro Enters Indonesian Market via Unofficial Vendors ](/tech/apple-vision-pro-enters-indonesian-market-via-unofficial-vendors) [ 5 Association Denies Claims China Benefits Most From Nickel Domestic Processing ](/business/association-denies-claims-china-benefits-most-from-nickel-domestic-processing-)",

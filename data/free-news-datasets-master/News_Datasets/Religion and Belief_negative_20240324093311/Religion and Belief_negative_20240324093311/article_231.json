    "text": "The [Indian right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary organization] Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) magazine Organiser carried an\narticle (dated 5 June 2023) by a former vice chancellor of Gautam Buddha University arguing in favour of the ‘logic of deleting Darwinism’ and ‘Intelligent Design’.\nIt was shocking because the third all-India head (sarsanghchalak) of the RSS, Madhukar Dattatraya Deoras, in one of his famous talks spoke about how the West, despite its religion-motivated psychological inhibitions, had embraced Darwinian science, citing the famous Scopes Monkey Trial.\nThe essay published by the authoritative RSS mouthpiece is a worrying indication of the creeping in of a fundamentalist creationist tendency that is more an imitation of Western creationism, and a vision alien to any Indian darshana, but, more importantly, a falsehood.\n…\nThe Indian knowledge system does not reject evolution, but if it does, then it is not a knowledge system but rather a system of sophisticated ignorance.\nHindu seers like Swami Vivekananda and Sri Aurobindo have argued for the acceptance of evolution.",

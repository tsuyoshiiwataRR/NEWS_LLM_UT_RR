    "text": "Rajasthan school teachers suspended over ‘love jihad’ The action came after Sarva Hindu Samaj, Sangod, sent a memorandum to the Education Minister, alleging that activities of religious conversion and love jihad have been going on in the school since 2019. (Representational image/File) Two instructors at a government school in the [Kota district ](https://pressvani.com/minor-student-gang-raped-in-kota)have been suspended by Rajasthan Education Minister Madan Dilawar due to accusations that they had engaged in activities related to religious conversion and \"love jihad.\" In this context, an inquiry is also being conducted against another educator. The instructors, who were assigned to a school in Kota's Sangod block, received their suspension orders on Thursday evening. Regarding the matter, the minister made a video statement available. We have learned that a Hindu girl's name was changed to a Muslim name when she was in high school. In the neighborhood, there is a plot involving religious conversion and love jihad. After receiving the information, we moved to suspend two teachers, and we are currently looking into another. \"The three of them will lose their jobs after an investigation if it turns out that they were involved in these acts,\" Dilawar stated in the video. The action was prompted by a document issued by Sarva Hindu Samaj, Sangod, to the Education Minister, in which the group claimed that since 2019, there had been religious conversion and love jihad activities taking place in the school. The statement further claimed that three teachers had ties to Pakistani organizations and prohibited groups. The memorandum also mentioned that a police station in Sangod had previously received a formal complaint (FIR) regarding this matter, but no action had been taken. What's Your Reaction?",

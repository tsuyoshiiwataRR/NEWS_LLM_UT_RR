    "text": "Why have there been so many earthquakes lately? Do you think it’s a sign that the end of the world is coming? How should we prepare?\n— Jackie\nOh boy. If you’re looking for signs that the end of the world is coming, you can find more convincing ones than earthquakes. From what I understand, earthquakes happen all the time. The Earth’s plates get the urge to shift, kind of like when you get the urge to turn over in your sleep, and so they do, producing seismic waves that most times go unnoticed. Only sometimes do they damage local infrastructures, and that’s when we hear about them. It’s heartbreaking — the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile are devastating in objective terms of damage and loss, and devastating on the internal landscape of anybody who has a heart. The most positive thing we can say is that such catastrophic events brings us together. Just last week, Robert Pinsky, Jorie Graham, Roseanna Warren, Gail Mazur, Dan Tobin, and many others participated in a Poets for Haiti reading at Harvard University to benefit reconstruction and aid efforts, so an event that can bring that much talent under one roof must have some redeeming quality. I guess — that’s what I like to tell myself anyway.\nNow, are these earthquakes a sign that the world will end soon? Hmm, I guess it’s possible, but remember, people thought the world would end in the year 2000. People predicted the world would end with the return of Halley’s Comet in 1986 and 1910, not to mention the doomsday predictions during every century of the Middle Ages, or on every coincidental date on the Jehovah’s Witness calendar. The Mayans predicted that the world would end in 2012, so we have that to look forward to. The thing about the end of the world though is that one can’t possibly prepare for it — in practical terms, I mean. Stocking up on water, canned goods, or batteries won’t do any good. I guess there are spiritual things you can do depending on your beliefs, but I won’t even go there.\nSong on the End of the World\nOn the day the world ends\nWomen walk through the fields under their umbrellas,\nA drunkard grows sleepy at the edge of a lawn,\nVegetable peddlers shout in the street\nAnd a yellow-sailed boat comes nearer the island,\nThe voice of a violin lasts in the air\nAnd leads into a starry night.\nSo, Jackie, cross that bridge when you come to it — that’s not always the best advice, but I’ve found it useful on a few occasions. I’ve always thought that a little bit of worry is good for the soul, but don’t worry yourself too much. Think positive, and make the best of that wild apocalyptic ride if it does come.\nAnd those who expected lightning and thunder\nAre disappointed.\nAnd those who expected signs and archangels’ trumps\nDo not believe it is happening now.\nAs long as the sun and the moon are above,\nAs long as the bumblebee visits a rose,\nAs long as rosy infants are born\nNo one believes it is happening now.\nOnly a white-haired old man, who would be a prophet\nYet is not a prophet, for he’s much too busy,\nRepeats while he binds his tomatoes:\nNo other end of the world will there be,\nNo other end of the world will there be.\n• 15 March 2010",

    "text": "RANCHI: Hours after the special PMLA court rejected Hemant Soren's petition to allow him to attend the budget session of the assembly beginning on Friday, the former CM moved the Jharkhand high court, which on Thursday agreed to take up the case and listed it for hearing on Friday.Highlighting the special PMLA's order, Pradeep Chandra, one of Hemant's advocates, said, \\\"The court of additional judicial commissioner Rajiv Ranjan said the petition has been rejected. We are yet to know the grounds on which the order has been passed.\\\"Ealrier on January 31, the enforcement directorate (ED) arrested Hemant in connection with the alleged illegal occupation of around 8.5-acre land in the Bargain circle of the city. Hemant is now in the Birsa Munda jail after the ED custody ended.On Wednesday, the court reserved its order after hearing the counsels representing Hemant and the ED. Senior advocate Rajiv Ranjan had contended that earlier, MLAs Dhullu Mahto and Nalin Soren were allowed to attend the assembly sessions while under custody. The ED opposed the petition saying that both the MLAs were permitted as floor tests of the then state governments were to take place.Meanwhile, Hemant and former revenue sub-inspector of Bargain, Bhanu Pratap Prasad, were produced before the PMLA court through video-conferencing at the end of their judicial remand on Thursday. The court extended their remand till March 7.Hemant's plea will be taken up by Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad in court number 3, a statement of by the HC's joint registrar said.",

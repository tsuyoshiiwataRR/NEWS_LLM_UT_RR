    "text": "In a setback for the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government, the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Act, 2024, was defeated by the combined BJP JDS opposition in the legislative council on Friday after it was put to vote by deputy chairman M K Pranesh. The legislation, proposing a Common Pool Fund under Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Department for aiding religious activities in Karnataka, has drawn fire from the BJP, which has accused the government of stealing the wealth of rich temples of the state. The BJP-JDS combine has a clear majority in the 75-member house. While the BJP has 34 members, Congress has 30, JDS 8, and 1 is an Independent, besides the chairman and one vacant seat in the council. The Bill had earlier been passed by the Assembly where the Congress government has 135 out of 224 members. The amendment, which seeks to consolidate temple funds for their upkeep, has been interpreted by the BJP as proof of the state government taking control of temples. The conflict arrives just months before the Lok Sabha polls, with temples expected to be a resonant issue, particularly after the Ram Temple consecration in Ayodhya last month. The Bill essentially intended to divert “10 per cent of the gross income in respect of institutions whose gross annual income exceeds rupees one crore,” to a common pool fund for looking after temples instead of the existing “10 per cent of the net income of institutions whose gross annual income exceeds ten lakhs rupees”. In addition, the amended law also dedicates “5 per cent of the net income of institutions whose gross annual income exceeds ten lakhs rupees but does not exceed one crore rupees\" to the common pool instead of the previous “5 per cent of the net income of institutions whose gross annual income exceeds five lakhs rupees but does not exceed ten lakhs rupees”. Although the law for creating a common pool of funds for temples by cross subsidizing with revenues from high income temples has been in existence since 1997, the BJP has called it an effort by the Congress to rob temples of their funds. The BJP, which lost power to the Congress in a comprehensive defeat last year, says the amendment shows the state government is setting out to “rob” temples, adding why only Hindu places of worship are being targeted. BJP state president B Y Vijayendra has accused the Siddaramaiah government of “casting its eye” on the incomes of Hindu temples to fill its own coffers. “The question from crores of devotees is why is the government eyeing the incomes of Hindu temples when it is not interested in the revenue of other religions?” he said.",

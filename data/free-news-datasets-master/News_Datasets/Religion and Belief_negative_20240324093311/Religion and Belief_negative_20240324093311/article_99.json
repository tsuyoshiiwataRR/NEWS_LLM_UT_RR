    "text": "\nThe cover of the report\nCONVERTS from Islam are being put under pressure to leave Iran by the Shia regime, Christian charities concerned with religious freedom report.\nThe charities — Open Doors, Christian Solidarity Worldwide, Middle East Concern, and Article 18 — presented their findings in a joint report, Faceless Victims: Rights violations against Christians in Iran 2024. It was lanched on Tuesday at an event at Portcullis House, Westminster.\nConversion from Shia Islam, evangelism, teaching in Sunday school, and being a member of a house church are all punishable offences under the penal code of the Islamic Republic founded in the 1979 Iranian revolution.\nChurches pre-dating the revolution — namely Assyrian and Armenian churches — are officially recognised, the report says, but, “unlike other places of worship”, four Persian-language Anglican churches have remained closed since the pandemic.\nWorshippers at these churches, the report says, “have been forced to congregate in private gatherings”, which are illegal.\nThe report analyses information from Christian networks in Iran. It says that at least 166 Iranians were arrested last year for offences relating to the practice or spreading of the Christian faith; and 21 were imprisoned for an average of two years. This compares with at least 134 arrests in 2022.\nHouse churches, the report says, are facing “increased digital surveillance”, while more Christians are being forced to attend Islamic “re-education”.\nIt also says that some converts who are imprisoned and then released are “actively encouraged” to emigrate “by intelligence agents, usually after they have refused to return to Islam or to accept a job as a spy of the Ministry of Intelligence”.\nThe news director for Article 18, Steve Dew-Jones, told the Church Times this week: “It is common practice for jailed Christians to be told they have just two choices upon release: to recant their faith and work for the authorities as spies within house churches, or to leave the country.”\nFor those who decline these options, he said, “work and education options will be closed off to them; they will be monitored to ensure they don’t have any further contact with other Christians. . . It is also common for these Christians to be threatened that they and their family members may suffer an ‘accident’.”\nThe 40-page report gives examples of systematic abuse, including the case of a Christian who was detained arbitrarily, another who arrested without being informed of the charges against her, and another who was told that his guilty verdict had been decided before his court hearing.\nThe report was published in the wake of accusations, led by the former Home Secretary Suella Braverman, that churches in England had been “facilitating industrial-scale bogus asylum claims” (News, 9 February). This has been fervently denied by senior church leaders (News, 16 February).\nHome Office figures suggest that, between June 2016 and 2022, more people claiming asylum in the UK were Iranian than any other nationality. In the year to June 2023, Iranian nationals were the third most common nationality to claim asylum in the UK, making 7776 applications, the Home Office reports. In 2019, the House of Bishops authorised a Persian translation of the service of holy communion for the increasing numbers of Iranians in congregations (News, 8 March 2019).\nThe charities behind Faceless Victims estimate that Iranian Christians make up a “significant portion” of the more than 15,000 Iranian asylum-seekers in Turkey. They argue that the Shia regime is contravening 11 articles of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a signatory, and call on Iran to release “immediately and unconditionally” all Christians “detained on charges relating to their faith and religious activities”.\nThe report also urges Iran to “clarify where Persian-speaking Christians may worship freely in their mother tongue, without fearing arrest and prosecution”.\n08 Dec 2023\n14 Oct 2022\n15 Sep 2023\n17 Jan 2024\n01 Dec 2023\n02 Feb 2024\n23 Feb 2024\n21 Feb 2024\nSneering at a new Live Aid show has political repercussions, argues Paul Vallely\nThe Bishop of Chichester acting on behalf of the Archbishop of Canterbury seeks a priest of prayer and spiritual insight,\nThe Benefice of Sawbridgeworth seeks to appoint a locally funded Associate Minister (House for Duty)\nWe are a 6 church benefice located in NE Lincolnshire, near the beautiful Lincolnshire Wolds and east coast.\nFind more jobs\n11 March 2024 | 6pm GMT\nAn expert panel discusses trust between the media and the public\nOnline Tickets available\n26 - 28 April 2024\nSee the full programme on the festival website.\nEarly bird tickets available\nClosing date: 30 June 2024\nRead more details about the awards\n ",

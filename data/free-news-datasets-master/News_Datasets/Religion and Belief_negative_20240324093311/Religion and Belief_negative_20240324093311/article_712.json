    "text": "MSNBC loves bringing on the most obnoxious people they can because they know it's the only way to get people to watch their train wreck of an outlet. Let's not pretend they keep Joy Reid on the air because people enjoy her show. No no, they know people watch Reid to point and laugh ... Sort of like this Heidi Przybyla person from POLITICO who seems very confused about Christianity, Christian Nationalism, and the Constitution. Which is even sadder because per her bio, she is 'investigating democracy'. Maybe she needs to investigate MORE? Watch this: Here— Wade Miller (@WadeMiller_USMC) [@MSNBC]helpfully makes it clear their disdain for Christians in America. She says that if you believe that your rights come from God, you aren’t a Christian, you are a Christian nationalist. Somehow they seem to not mention that our own founding documents make this… [pic.twitter.com/WTLMqcqTzg] [February 23, 2024] Seems pretty clear.

It is a core pillar of Catholicism and, particularly among the Jesuit priests from my childhood it was applied to social justice and the inherent rights all humans have for dignity \"life, liberty & the pursuit of /— Heidi Przybyla 🌺 (@HeidiReports) [February 23, 2024] You know the face your dog makes when you ask them if they want to go outside and they're not sure if you're serious or messing with them? Yeah, we just made that same face. happiness.\"— Heidi Przybyla 🌺 (@HeidiReports) MLK, likewise, invoked natural law when he spoke of social justice & the civil rights movement. In the full clip I say men are making their own interpretations. Finally, peace be with you. [pic.twitter.com/5r5ModDvZv] [February 23, 2024] Alrighty then. Let's just all agree you are bad with words.— Jim Stinson (@jimstinson) [February 23, 2024] That seems fair, yeah? This is the bigotry of— Abri (@abriNotMe77) [@msnbc]and [@politico] Trying to deflect and excuse away your ethos and derogatory “Christian Nationalism” rhetoric You said what you said We all hear you and see you 👀 Just take the L and move on [February 23, 2024] Just.

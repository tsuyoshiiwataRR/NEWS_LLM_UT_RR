    "text": "Politico writer Heidi Przybyla said on MSNBC that Christian Nationalists believe their rights come from God. Apparently, Ms. Przbyla has never read the Declaration of Independence. Or maybe she does not believed that we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable Rights. Using her definition, that makes President Biden a “Christian Nationalist.” In 1987 Biden said, “I believe all Americans are born with certain unalienable rights. As a child of God I believe my rights are not derived the Constitution. My rights are not derived from any government. My rights are not derived from any majority. My rights are because I exist. I have certain rights. They’re given to me and each of my fellow citizens by our Creator.” [Click here to read my new book on how to save the nation from the clutches of Darth Brandon. ](https://www.amazon.com/Twilights-Last-Gleaming-America-Saved/dp/1637584784/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=MQtHt&content-id=amzn1.sym.3c3990c3-513c-4686-8d92-a42b4095cecb%3Aamzn1.symc.8b620bc3-61d8-46b3-abd9-110539785634&pf_rd_p=3c3990c3-513c-4686-8d92-a42b4095cecb&pf_rd_r=R0DAH873K71P2Q55PHH1&pd_rd_wg=rENR9&pd_rd_r=33fa3d8a-21ef-4496-83a3-cc697323b5b0&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_d) Here— Wade Miller (@WadeMiller_USMC) [@MSNBC]helpfully makes it clear their disdain for Christians in America. She says that if you believe that your rights come from God, you aren’t a Christian, you are a Christian nationalist. Somehow they seem to not mention that our own founding documents make this… [pic.twitter.com/WTLMqcqTzg] [February 23, 2024]",

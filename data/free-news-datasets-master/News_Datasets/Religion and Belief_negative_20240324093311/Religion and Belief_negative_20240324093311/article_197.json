    "text": "Job Replies: The Wicked Do Prosper\n21 Then Job answered and said:\n2\n[k](/Jb13.17)“Keep listening to my words,\nand let this be your comfort.\n3 Bear with me, and I will speak,\nand after I have spoken,\n[l](/Jb16.10%3BJb16.20%3BJb17.2)mock on.\n4 As for me, is my\n[m](/Jb10.1%3BJb23.2)complaint against man?\nWhy should I not be impatient?\n5 Look at me and be appalled,\nand\n[n](/Jb29.9%3BJb40.4%3BJg18.19)lay your hand over your mouth.\n6 When I remember, I am dismayed,\nand shuddering seizes my flesh.\n7\n[o](/Jb12.6%3BPs17.14%3BPs37.1%3BPs37.35%3BPs73.3%3BPs73.5%3BPs92.7%3BEc8.14%3BJr12.1-2%3BHab1.13%3BHab1.16%3BMal3.14-15)Why do the wicked live,\nreach old age, and grow mighty in power?\n8 Their\n[p](/Jb5.25)offspring are established in their presence,\nand their descendants before their eyes.\n9 Their houses are\n[q](/Jb5.24)safe from fear,\nand\n[r](/Jb9.34)no rod of God is upon them.\n10 Their bull breeds without fail;\ntheir cow calves and\n[s](/Ex23.26)does not miscarry.\n11 They send out their\n[t](/Ps17.14)little boys like a flock,\nand their children dance.\n12 They sing to\n[u](/Ex15.20)the tambourine and [v](/Jb30.31%3BGn4.21)the lyre\nand rejoice to the sound of\n[v](/Jb30.31%3BGn4.21)the pipe.\n13 They\n[w](/Jb36.11)spend their days in prosperity,\nand in\n[x](/Jb34.20%3BJb24.19)peace they go down to [y](/Jb7.9%3BJb14.13%3BJb17.13%3BPs16.10)Sheol.\n14 They say to God,\n[z](/Jb22.17)‘Depart from us!\nWe do not desire the knowledge of your ways.\n15\n[a](/Ex5.2)What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?\nAnd what\n[b](/Jb34.9)profit do we get if we pray to him?’\n16 Behold, is not their prosperity in their hand?\n[c](/Jb22.18%3BPs1.1)The counsel of the wicked is far from me.\n17 “How often is it that\n[d](/Jb18.5-6)the lamp of the wicked is put out?\nThat their calamity comes upon them?\nThat God\n[1](#f1-) distributes pains in his anger?\n18 That they are like\n[e](/Jb13.25%3BPs83.13)straw before the wind,\nand like\n[f](/Ps1.4%3BPs35.5%3BIs17.13%3BIs29.5)chaff that the storm carries away?\n19 You say, ‘God\n[g](/Jb15.20)stores up their iniquity for their [h](/Ex20.5)children.’\nLet him pay it out to them, that they may\n[i](/Is9.9%3BEze25.14%3BHs9.7)know it.\n20 Let their own eyes see their destruction,\nand let them\n[j](/Ps60.3%3BPs75.8%3BIs51.17%3BIs51.22%3BJr25.15%3BOb16%3BRv14.10)drink of the wrath of the Almighty.\n21 For what do they care for their houses after them,\nwhen\n[k](/Jb14.5)the number of their months is cut off?\n22\n[l](/Is40.14%3BRm11.34%3B1Co2.16)Will any teach God knowledge,\nseeing that he\n[m](/Jb4.18%3BJb15.15)judges those who are on high?\n23 One dies in his full vigor,\nbeing wholly at ease and secure,\n24 his pails\n[2](#f2-) full of milk\nand\n[n](/Pr3.8%3BIs58.11%3BIs66.14)the marrow of his bones moist.\n25 Another dies in\n[o](/Jb7.11)bitterness of soul,\nnever having tasted of prosperity.\n26 They\n[p](/Jb20.11%3BEc9.2)lie down alike in the dust,\nand\n[q](/Is14.11)the worms cover them.\n27 “Behold, I know your thoughts\nand your schemes to wrong me.\n28 For you say,\n[r](/Jb20.6-7)‘Where is the house of the prince?\nWhere is\n[s](/Jb8.22%3BJb15.34)the tent in which the wicked lived?’\n29 Have you not asked those who travel the roads,\nand do you not accept their testimony\n30 that\n[t](/Pr16.4%3B2P2.9)the evil man is spared in the day of calamity,\nthat he is rescued in the day of wrath?\n31 Who declares his way\n[u](/De7.10%3BHs5.5%3BGa2.11)to his face,\nand who\n[v](/De7.10)repays him for what he has done?\n32 When he is\n[w](/Jb10.19)carried to the grave,\nwatch is kept over his tomb.\n33\n[x](/Jb38.38)The clods of the valley are sweet to him;\n[y](/Jb30.23%3BHb9.27)all mankind follows after him,\nand those who go before him are innumerable.\n34 How then will you comfort me with empty nothings?\nThere is nothing left of your answers but falsehood.”\nEliphaz Speaks: Job’s Wickedness Is Great\n22 Then\n[z](/Jb2.11)Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:\n2\n[a](/Jb35.7)“Can a man be profitable to God?\nSurely he who is wise is profitable to himself.\n3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are in the right,\nor is it gain to him if you\n[b](/Ps18.32)make your ways blameless?\n4 Is it for your fear of him that he reproves you\nand\n[c](/Jb14.3%3BPs143.2)enters into judgment with you?\n5 Is not your evil abundant?\nThere is no end to your iniquities.\n6 For you have\n[d](/Jb24.3%3BJb24.9%3BEx22.26%3BDe24.6%3BDe24.17%3BEze18.12%3BEze18.16)exacted pledges of your brothers for nothing\n[e](/Jb31.16)and stripped the naked of their clothing.\n7 You have given no water to the weary to drink,\nand you have\n[f](/Jb31.17%3BIs58.7%3BEze18.7%3BEze18.16%3BMt25.42)withheld bread from the hungry.\n8\n[g](/Jb35.9)The man with power possessed the land,\nand\n[h](/2K5.1%3BIs9.15)the favored man lived in it.\n9 You have\n[i](/Lk1.53)sent widows away empty,\nand\n[j](/Jb38.15)the arms of [k](/Jb31.21%3BIs10.2%3BEze22.7)the fatherless were crushed.\n10 Therefore\n[l](/Jb18.8-10)snares are all around you,\nand sudden terror overwhelms you,\n11 or\n[m](/Ex10.22-23)darkness, so that you cannot see,\n12 “Is not God high in the heavens?\nSee\n[p](/Jb11.8)the highest stars, how lofty they are!\n13 But you say,\n[q](/Ps73.11%3BPs10.11%3BPs59.7%3BPs64.5%3BPs94.7%3BIs29.15%3BEze8.12%3BEze9.9)‘What does God know?\nCan he judge through\n[r](/Jb38.9)the deep darkness?\n14\n[s](/Ps139.11-12%3BPr8.27%3BIs40.22)Thick clouds veil him, so that he does not see,\nand he walks on the vault of heaven.’\n15 Will you keep to the old way\nthat wicked men have trod?\n16 They were snatched away\n[t](/Jb15.32)before their time;\ntheir foundation was washed away.\n[1](#f1-)\n17 They said to God,\n[u](/Jb21.14)‘Depart from us,’\nand\n[v](/Ps4.6)‘What can the Almighty do to us?’ [2](#f2-)\n18 Yet he filled their houses with good things—\nbut\n[w](/Jb21.16)the counsel of the wicked is far from me.\n19\n[x](/Ps52.6%3BPs58.10%3BPs107.42%3BPs64.10)The righteous see it and are glad;\nthe innocent one\n[y](/Ps2.4)mocks at them,\n20 saying, ‘Surely our adversaries are cut off,\nand what they left\n[z](/Jb1.16)the fire has consumed.’\n21\n[a](/Ps119.45)“Agree with God, and [b](/Pr3.2)be at peace;\nthereby good will come to you.\n22 Receive instruction from\n[c](/Pr2.6%3BMal2.7)his mouth,\nand\n[d](/Ps119.11)lay up his words in your heart.\n23 If you\n[e](/Jb8.5-6%3BJb11.13-14%3BMal3.7)return to the Almighty you will be [f](/Jr24.6%3BJr33.7)built up;\nif you\n[g](/Jb11.14)remove injustice far from your tents,\n24 if you lay gold in\n[h](/Jb20.11%3BJb21.26)the dust,\nand gold of\n[i](/1K9.28)Ophir among the stones of the torrent-bed,\n25 then the Almighty will be your gold\nand your precious silver.\n26 For then you\n[j](/Jb27.10%3BPs37.4%3BIs58.14)will delight yourself in the Almighty\nand\n[k](/Jb11.15)lift up your face to God.\n27 You will\n[l](/Jb33.26%3BPs50.14-15%3BIs58.9)make your prayer to him, and he will hear you,\nand you will\n[m](/Ps50.14)pay your vows.\n28 You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you,\nand\n[n](/Pr4.18)light will shine on your ways.\n29 For when they are humbled you say, ‘It is because of pride’;\n[3](#f3-)\nbut he saves\n[o](/Ps138.6%3BPr3.34%3BPr29.23%3BMt23.12%3BLk1.52%3BJm4.6%3B1P5.5)the lowly.\n30 He\n[p](/Gn18.26)delivers even the one who is not innocent,\nwho will be delivered through\n[q](/Jb17.9%3BPs18.20%3BPs18.24%3BPs24.4%3BPs26.6%3BJb9.30)the cleanness of your hands.”\nJob Replies: Where Is God?\n23 Then Job answered and said:\n2 “Today also my\n[r](/Jb10.1%3BJb21.4)complaint is bitter; [1](#f1-)\nmy\n[s](/Ps32.4)hand is heavy on account of my groaning.\n3 Oh,\n[t](/Jb13.3%3BJb16.21)that I knew where I might find him,\nthat I might come even to his\n[u](/Ps9.7-8%3BIs57.15-16)seat!\n4 I would\n[v](/Jb33.5)lay my case before him\nand fill my mouth with arguments.\n5 I would know what he would answer me\nand understand what he would say to me.\n6 Would he\n[w](/Jb9.34%3BJb13.21)contend with me in the greatness of his power?\nNo; he would pay attention to me.\n7 There an upright man could argue with him,\nand I would be acquitted forever by my judge.\n8 “Behold,\n[x](/Jb9.11%3BJb35.14)I go forward, but he is not there,\nand backward, but I do not perceive him;\n9 on the left hand when he is working, I do not behold him;\nhe turns to the right hand, but I do not see him.\n10 But he\n[y](/Ps139.1-3)knows [z](/Ps139.24)the way that I [a](/Jb9.35)take;\nwhen he has\n[b](/Ps17.3%3BPs26.2%3BPs66.10%3BPs139.23%3BZc13.9%3BMal3.3%3B1P1.7%3BRv3.18%3BJm1.12)tried me, I shall come out as gold.\n11 My foot\n[c](/Ps17.5%3BPs44.18)has held fast to his steps;\nI have kept his way and have\n[d](/Ps125.5)not turned aside.\n12 I have not departed from the commandment of his lips;\nI have\n[e](/Ps119.11)treasured the words of his mouth more than my [f](/Ps119.103%3BJn4.32%3BJn4.34)portion of food.\n13 But he is unchangeable,\n[2](#f2-) and [g](/Jb9.12%3BJb12.14)who can turn him back?\nWhat he\n[h](/Ps115.3)desires, that he does.\n14 For he will complete what he\n[i](/1Th3.3)appoints for me,\nand many such things are\n[j](/Jb10.13%3BJb27.11)in his mind.\n15 Therefore I am terrified at his presence;\nwhen I consider, I am in dread of him.\n16 God has made my\n[k](/De20.3%3BPs22.14)heart faint;\nthe Almighty has terrified me;\n17 yet I am not silenced because of the darkness,\nnor because thick darkness covers my face.\n24 “Why are\n[l](/Ec9.12%3BIs13.22%3BJr27.7%3BEze22.3%3BEze30.3)not times of judgment [m](/Jb15.20)kept by the Almighty,\nand why do those who know him never see his\n[n](/Is2.12%3BIs13.6%3BIs13.9%3BJl1.15%3BJl2.1%3BAm5.18%3BJb18.20)days?\n2 Some move\n[o](/De19.14)landmarks;\nthey seize flocks and pasture them.\n3 They drive away the donkey of the fatherless;\nthey\n[p](/Jb22.6)take the widow’s ox for a pledge.\n4 They\n[q](/Am2.7%3BAm5.12%3BMal3.5)thrust the poor off the road;\nthe poor of the earth\n[r](/Pr28.28%3BJb30.5-6)all hide themselves.\n5 Behold, like wild donkeys in the desert\nthe poor\n[1](#f1-) [s](/Ps104.23)go out to their toil, [t](/Ps104.21)seeking game;\nthe wasteland yields food for their children.\n6 They gather their\n[2](#f2-) fodder in the field,\nand they glean the vineyard of the wicked man.\n7 They\n[u](/Ex22.26-27%3BDe24.12-13)lie all night naked, without clothing,\nand have no covering in the cold.\n8 They are wet with the rain of the mountains\nand\n[v](/Lm4.5)cling to the rock for lack of shelter.\n9 (There are those who snatch the fatherless child from the breast,\nand they take a pledge against the poor.)\n10 They go about naked, without clothing;\nhungry, they\n[w](/2Tm2.6%3BJm5.4)carry the sheaves;\n11 among the olive rows of the wicked\n[3](#f3-) they make oil;\nthey tread the winepresses, but suffer thirst.\n12 From out of the city the dying\n[4](#f4-) groan,\nand the soul of\n[x](/Jr51.52%3BEze30.24)the wounded cries for help;\nyet God charges no one with\n[y](/Jb1.22)wrong.\n13 “There are those who rebel\n[z](/Jn3.19-20)against the light,\nwho are not acquainted with its ways,\nand do not stay in its paths.\n14 The murderer rises before it is light,\nthat he\n[a](/Ps10.8)may kill the poor and needy,\nand in the night he is like a thief.\n15 The eye of the adulterer also waits for\n[b](/Pr7.9)the twilight,\nsaying, ‘No\n[c](/Ps10.11)eye will see me’;\nand he veils his face.\n16 In the dark they\n[d](/Ex22.2%3BMt6.20%3BJb31.9)dig through houses;\nby day they shut themselves up;\nthey do not know the light.\n17 For\n[e](/Jb3.5)deep darkness is morning to all of them;\nfor they are friends with the terrors of deep darkness.\n18 “You say,\n[f](/Jb9.26%3BHs10.7)‘Swift are they on the face of the waters;\ntheir portion is cursed in the land;\nno treader turns toward their vineyards.\n19 Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters;\nso does\n[g](/Jb21.13)Sheol those who have sinned.\n20 The womb forgets them;\nthe worm finds them sweet;\nthey are\n[h](/Pr10.7)no longer remembered,\nso wickedness is broken like\n[i](/Jb18.16)a tree.’\n21 “They wrong the barren, childless woman,\nand do no good to the widow.\n22 Yet God\n[5](#f5-) prolongs the life of the mighty by his power;\nthey rise up when they despair of life.\n23 He gives them security, and they are supported,\nand his\n[j](/Ps11.4%3BPr15.3)eyes are upon their ways.\n24 They are exalted\n[k](/Ps37.10)a little while, and then [l](/Jb27.19)are gone;\nthey are brought low and gathered up like all others;\nthey are\n[m](/Jb14.2)cut off like the heads of grain.\n25 If it is\n[n](/Jb9.24)not so, who will prove me a liar\nand show that there is nothing in what I say?”\nBildad Speaks: Man Cannot Be Righteous\n25 Then\n[o](/Jb2.11)Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:\n2 “Dominion and fear are with God;\n[1](#f1-)\nhe makes peace in his high heaven.\n3 Is there any number to his\n[p](/Jb19.12%3BPs103.21)armies?\nUpon whom does his\n[q](/Mt5.45%3BJm1.17)light not arise?\n4 How then can man be\n[r](/Jb4.17-19%3BJb9.2%3BJb15.14-16%3BPs130.3%3BPs143.2)in the right before God?\nHow can he who is\n[s](/Jb14.1)born of woman be [t](/Jb14.4)pure?\n5 Behold, even the moon is not bright,\nand the stars are not pure in his eyes;\n6\n[u](/Jb9.14%3BJb15.16)how much less man, who is [v](/Ps22.6%3BIs41.14)a

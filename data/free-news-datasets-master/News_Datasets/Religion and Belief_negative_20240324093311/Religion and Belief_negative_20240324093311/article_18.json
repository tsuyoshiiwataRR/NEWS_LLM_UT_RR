    "text": "The Genesis company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), has\nopposed the settlement Genesis reached with the New York Attorney General (NYAG) office. The court mediator ruled that the settlement violated bankruptcy law by not distributing payments to creditors proportionally from available resources and by setting the distribution date instead of the petition date.\nThe settlement would pay the NYAG’s claims after unsecured creditors receive full payment. DCG, Genesis’ sole equity holder and a secured creditor,\nsays this robs it of participating in residual asset distribution under a Chapter 11 plan.\nDCG alleges Genesis failed to properly weigh legal options before agreeing to settle. The firm argues that Genesis failed to properly evaluate the potential to dispute NYAG’s claims in court. Additionally, it did not negotiate arm’s length to enhance the estate’s value.\nDCG has asked the court to withhold settlement approval until its objections are addressed. The firm made similar objections to Genesis’ broader bankruptcy plan last week.\nThe NYAG\nsued Genesis in October over the collapse of its Gemini Earn crypto lending program. Genesis halted customer withdrawals in November and then filed for bankruptcy in January.\nAlso read:",

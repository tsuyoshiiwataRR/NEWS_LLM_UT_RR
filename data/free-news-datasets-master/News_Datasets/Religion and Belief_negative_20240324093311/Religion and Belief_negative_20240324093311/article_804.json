    "text": "In one of the most sobering statements recorded in the Gospels, Jesus Christ warns of a day when many who believed themselves to be followers would be turned away with the words, “Depart from me, I never knew you.” This dire warning, found in\nMatthew 7:23, serves as a crucial lesson on the nature of genuine faith, the importance of a personal relationship with Christ, and the implications of superficial belief. It’s a call to examine our faith’s authenticity, ensuring it’s rooted in a real connection with Jesus rather than merely religious activities or verbal affirmations.\nUnderstanding the Biblical Context of ‘Depart From Me, I Never Knew You’\nThis warning comes at the conclusion of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus outlines the principles of the Kingdom of Heaven, challenging prevailing religious norms and urging a deeper, more authentic adherence to God’s will. Here, Christ isn’t merely addressing overt sinners or non-believers but those who actively participate in religious activities, even performing miracles in His name. The stark message is that such feats, in the absence of a real relationship with Jesus, are insufficient.\nThe Danger of Superficial Faith\nSuperficial faith refers to a belief that is only skin-deep, where individuals may identify as Christians but lack a\ntransformative connection with Jesus. This form of faith is often built on convenience, cultural identity, or the desire for the benefits of being associated with Christianity without the commitment to its teachings. Jesus warns that simply calling Him “Lord” or engaging in religious activities is not enough for salvation. True faith must penetrate beyond surface-level acknowledgment, fundamentally altering our lives and actions.\nRELATED:\nTim Keller: 3 Questions Fake Christians Can’t Answer\nThe Necessity of a Genuine Relationship\nCentral to Jesus’ message is the desire for a personal, intimate relationship with His followers. Christianity, at its core, is not about adhering to a set of rules or rituals but about knowing and being known by Christ. This relationship is characterized by love, ongoing dialogue (prayer), and a deep knowledge of God’s character as revealed in the Bible. A genuine relationship with Jesus transforms us, influencing our actions, decisions, and how we relate to others and God.\nAuthentic Obedience Over Religious Activity\nAuthentic obedience is a natural outflow of a genuine relationship with Christ. It involves listening to and\nfollowing God’s will as revealed in Scripture, even when it challenges or convicts us. This obedience is not about earning God’s love or salvation—both are freely given—but about living in a way that reflects our love for Him and aligns with His kingdom’s values. In contrast, Jesus criticizes those who perform religious activities for show or without a heart aligned with God’s will, highlighting that true discipleship is marked by doing the Father’s will.\nThe Peril of Lawlessness\nJesus specifically points to those who practice lawlessness, indicating habitual disobedience to God’s commands, as those He does not know. This lawlessness isn’t about occasional failings or sins but a consistent pattern of behavior that rejects God’s authority. It underscores the importance of repentance—a heartfelt turning away from sin and toward God—which is a key aspect of genuine faith. Repentance is not a one-time act but a continuous part of the Christian life, reflecting an ongoing desire to align with God’s will.",

    "text": "A New Jersey priest arrested for shoplifting and drunk driving is stepping down from his pulpit, Daily Voice has learned. Dawid Wejnerowski, the now-former priest of the St. Mary's Catholic Church in Alpha, had a blood alcohol level more than twice the legal limit when Pohatcong police pulled him over on suspicion of shoplifting from Walmart on Monday, Feb. 19 around 10:15 p.m., Police Chief Scott Robb said. Officers approached the priest's vehicle, pointed out to them by a Walmart employee in the store parking lot, but Wejnerowski backed the car out of a parking spot and drove off from the officer's patrol car, which had its lights and sirens activated, Robb said. Wejnerowski drove erratically through the Parkside section of Pohatcong Township and came to a stop in a front yard on Liberty Boulevard, the chief said. The priest was arrested and removed from the vehicle. After apprehending him, police found the items he snatched from Walmart and open containers of alcohol in his crr, Robb said. Wejnerowski was charged with shoplifting, eluding police, driving while intoxicated, and multiple other traffic offenses. Wejnerowski's blood alcohol level was 0.21%. The legal driving limit in New Jersey is .08%. He was released pending a court date. A spokesman for the diocese of Metuchen said the priest would be stepping aside to seek inpatient treatment out of state. \"It is clear, Fr. Dawid has a very serious problem with alcohol. He has accepted this fact, the first step in recovery,\" said Anthony Kearns, III, Chancellor of the Diocese of Metuchen. \"Fr. is extremely remorseful for his conduct. He is aware of the danger he posed to others and himself. He is resolved to seek the necessary treatment to ensure he never engages in such behavior again.",

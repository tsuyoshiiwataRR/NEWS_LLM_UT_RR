    "text": "Sharon Teresa Alloway-Bell, born on October 3, 1958, in Salina, Kansas, went home to be with the Lord on January 31, 2024, surrounded with the love of her children. Sharon is preceded in death by her mother Rita Aurora Zaragoza Alloway, father Nelson Wade Alloway, and her lifelong furry son, “London.” Left to carry on Sharon’s memory are her children: daughter, Teresa Ann Hughes and husband Maurice Hughes, and their four children: Omarie, Sanyiah, Zahcari, and Ezekiel Hughes; son, John Richard Bell and wife Linda Bell; siblings: Chris Alloway, Pamela Anderson (Tom), Mike Alloway (Anita), SunCha Gager, John Alloway, and Barbara Alloway; and a host of other relatives and friends. Born into a military family, Sharon embraced her upbringing with grace and resilience. Her father’s twenty years of service in the United States Army allowed them to travel and live across the country. Sharon leaves behind a legacy of love and faith. She was a devoted follower of God, a beacon of strength, and a woman of unwavering faith. Her belief in God’s love and guidance illuminated her path and inspired all who knew her, “HALLELUJAH!!” Sharon’s life was a vibrant tapestry woven with diverse passions and interests. She found joy in thrifting at antique stores frequently enough that she should have had her own antique store and indulging in movies where her compassion for them would guarantee tears before the movie was over. She was a master in the art of cooking and would feed anyone in the neighborhood, it didn’t matter who you were. During her children’s childhood, she was considered the neighborhood mom, passionately opening up her doors to any and every child who needed or wanted somewhere to go. She was a skillful storyteller whose stories would have you on the edge of your seat. With her captivating spooky stories, the best music playing, and all the food and snacks a kid could ask for, Ms. Sharon’s house was THE place to be. Sharon danced to the rhythm of life, leaving a positive impact on all those who came into contact with her. Her pursuits also included hunting, fishing, cross-stitching, and preserving her Native American heritage through artifact collection. Above all, Sharon cherished moments spent with her beloved ones, cultivating bonds that transcended time. For over twelve years, Sharon dedicated herself to Sam’s Club, where she flourished into a revered supervisor. Sam’s Club was not just a workplace; it was her second family, a place where lifelong bonds were established that still hold strong today. This is a testament to her warmth and dedication. Sharon’s presence illuminated every room she graced. Her infectious smile and laughter brightened even the darkest of days. She possessed an unmatched sense of humor and a fierce protectiveness for her loved ones. Crossing the line with any of her loved ones meant you would need the Army, Air Force, and Navy to stop her wrath. She simply loved and protected her family hard. In the hearts of those who knew her, Sharon’s memory will forever be a beacon of love, laughter, and unwavering faith. Though she may have departed this world, her spirit lives on in the cherished memories she leaves behind. A memorial service to celebrate Sharon’s life will be held at 2 p.m. Saturday, February 24, 2024, in Whiting’s Funeral Home.",

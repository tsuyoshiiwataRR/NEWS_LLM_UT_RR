    "text": "How do you do, fellow Christian nationalists?\nThe one thing that unites all of them, because there are many different groups orbiting Trump, but the thing that unites them as 'Christian Nationalists' - not Christian by the way because Christian Nationalist is very different - is that they believe that our rights as Americans, as all human beings, do not come from any earthly authority, they don't come from Congress, they don't come from the Supreme Court, they come from God.\nWHAT? I AM SHOCKED!\nI am sad to report I've found some Christian nationalist literature that is just FRIGHTENING to behold!\nIf you're an MSNBC watcher, this will shock you!\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\nYes, behold the dangerous Christian nationalist who thinks rights DON'T COME FROM CONGRESS!\nIt amazes me to no end that the lefties are this disconnected from history and reality.\n(If you want to know how America was founded on Christian teachings with the intent of being a Christian nation,\nhere's a podcast primer for ya.)\nPolitico also told us this week what they consider Christian nationalism:\nGuys, love it or hate it, if you believe in Jesus, then welcome to the team.\nWe're all Christian nationalists now.\n ",

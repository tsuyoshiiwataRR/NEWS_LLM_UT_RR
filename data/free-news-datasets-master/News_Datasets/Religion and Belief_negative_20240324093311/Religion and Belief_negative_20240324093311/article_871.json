    "text": "Another day, another attack on Christianity by MSNBC. The left-wing network continues to bash those who believe in the Christian faith and follow Christian values. This seems to be a common theme on the network, as it is far from the first time, and certainly won't be the last time where Christians are purposely mischaracterized over at MSNBC. A guest on the left-wing network, Heidi Pryzbala, who is also an investigative reporter for Politico, said: The one thing that unites all of them because there is many different group orbiting Trump, but the thing that unites them as Christian nationalists, not Christians by the way, because Christian nationalist is very different, is that they believe that our rights as a Americans, as all human beings don't come from any earthly authority. They don't come from Congress, they don't come from the Supreme Court, they come from God. Here— Wade Miller (@WadeMiller_USMC) [@MSNBC]helpfully makes it clear their disdain for Christians in America. She says that if you believe that your rights come from God, you aren’t a Christian, you are a Christian nationalist. Somehow they seem to not mention that our own founding documents make this… [pic.twitter.com/WTLMqcqTzg] [February 23, 2024] Maybe the so-called investigative reporter should read the Declaration of Independence because she is wrong, but nobody on that network seems to care as long as they make their viewers fear the term and those who identify as \"Christian nationalists.\" [According](https://www.preparetheway.us/a-biblical-and-historical-perspective-on-the-concept-of-rights/) to the Founding Fathers, our rights came from God. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. [Per](https://www.preparetheway.us/a-biblical-and-historical-perspective-on-the-concept-of-rights/) The Rights of the Colonists: These [rights] may be best understood by reading and carefully studying the institutes of the great Law Giver and Head of the Christian Church, which are to be found clearly written and promulgated in the New Testament. Lastly, [per](https://www.preparetheway.us/a-biblical-and-historical-perspective-on-the-concept-of-rights/) John Quincy Adams: [T]he Declaration of Independence first organized the social compact on the foundation of the Redeemer’s mission upon earth. …[and] laid the cornerstone of human government upon the first precepts of Christianity. They float the term \"Christian nationalist\" to scare the public from those who believe their Lord and Savior is Jesus Christ, and that, yes, our rights do come from God. The majority, if not the overwhelming majority of Christians believe that, whether they identify as nationalists or not. This seems to be an ongoing occurrence on the left-wing network. Pryzbala is not the only person who attacks Christians and Christianity on MSNBC. Joy Reid, one of MSNBC's famous hosts, once said Evangelical Christianity is \"Talibanism.\" Joy Reid says the more appropriate term for conservative, evangelical Christianity is \"Talibanism,\" saying it \"scares me\" that the American right believes \"this is our sect and you will live by our sect whether you want to be a part of it or not.\"— Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) [pic.twitter.com/Kw9kTIbi85] [September 4, 2021] Another MSNBC host, Alex Wagner, who replaced Rachel Maddow, attacked Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), and went on Seth Meyers' late-night show, claiming that DeSantis' education policies are \"the way we re-indoctrinate people to sort of a white Christian nationalist agenda.\" Seth Meyers asks MSNBC's Alex Wagner \"why we should be afraid\" Of DeSantis's education policies. She says he's \"Orwellian\" and \"this is the way we re-indoctrinate people to sort of a white Christian nationalist agenda\" (1/2)— Alex Christy (@alexchristy17) [pic.twitter.com/zBHvNjhJnI] [January 27, 2023] A few days later on MSNBC, during her prime-time show, Wagner again went after Christianity and DeSantis. WATCH: Alex Wagner reports on Ron DeSantis' Christian conservative takeover of Florida's New College, a small liberal arts school that formerly emphasized diversity and inclusion.— MSNBC (@MSNBC) [https://t.co/l8dRL8m3oS] [pic.twitter.com/dLOcNT4eBr] [February 1, 2023] These people have no shame and don't care if they blatantly lie, as long as they trash Christianity, and make their viewers feel like those who go to church, read the bible, and pray are \"scary.\" The reason they think they can get away with it is because they rarely ever get any pushback, making them think that their stance is something that most agree with. 63 percent of Americans identify as Christian, according to a Pew Research [survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/09/13/how-u-s-religious-composition-has-changed-in-recent-decades/) done in 2022; however, there has been a decline in those who identify as Christian in America. That could be for several reasons, but two big reasons could be that it is not being taught at home as much as before and due to networks like MSNBC constantly kicking down the religion. If Christianity ever becomes the minority in America, you will never hear about the religion from left-wing networks again because they will have achieved their goal.",

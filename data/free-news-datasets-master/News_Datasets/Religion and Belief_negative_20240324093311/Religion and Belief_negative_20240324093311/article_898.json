    "text": "*President: Nigeria lost fearless soldier, unwavering advocate *I will never forget Akeredolu, says Aiyedatiwa Deji Elumoye in Abuja and Fidelis David in Akure President Bola Tinubu yesterday, led dignitaries from all walks of life to Owo town, in Ondo State to witness the burial of the former Governor of the State, Mr. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), after a nine-day funeral rites. Late Akeredolu died on Wednesday, December 27, 2023 after a prolonged illness at the age of 67. Aside Tinubu who was represented by the Vice President, Kashim Shettima, other dignitaries including Secretary to the Government of the Federation, George Akume; National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Abdulahi Ganduje; governors, ministers, monarchs, captain of industries, and other well-meaning Nigerians witnessed the burial of the former governor, held at St Andrews Anglican Cathedral, in Owo. Governors present were Lucky Aiyedatiwa (Ondo); Babajide Sanwolu (Lagos); Biodun Oyebanji (Ekiti); Ademola Adeleke (Osun); Seyi Makinde (Oyo); Dapo Abiodun (Ogun); Godwin Obaseki (Edo) Sheriff Oborevwori (Delta); Charles Soludo (Anambra); Rev. Fr. Hyacinth Alia (Benue); Peter Mbah (Enugu) and Ahmed Ododo, represented by his deputy, Salifu Oyibo (Kogi). Other eminent Nigerians who graced the event were minister of Marine and Blue Economy, Adegboyega Oyetola; Senator Opeyemi Bamidele; Former Governors Dr Olusegun Mimiko (Ondo); Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti) Abubakar Yari (Zamfara) Gbenga Daniel (Ogun); Niyi Adebayo (Ekiti); friends; family; political associates and other numerous dignitaries from all walks of life. Tinubu in his tribute described Akeredolu as a, “fearless soldier and unwavering advocate for his people. The President lauded the deceased indomitable legacy of national service, saying, “We are gathered here today to bid farewell to a remarkable soul, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Odunayo Akeredolu SAN, CON. “As we gather here today, we are confronted with one inexorable truth: seasons come and seasons go, much like the ebb and flow of our lives, and each of us shall go with the tides one after the other. “We are also reminded that in this transient journey through life, we are but whispers in the wind. The parts of us that endure after we get to the end of our journey are the choices we make, and this moment is the ultimate confirmation of the noble paths trodden by our dear brother,” the President said. Tinubu traced Akeredolu’s journey, from his distinguished legal career to his pivotal role as Governor of Ondo State. He praised his vast intelligence and the profound impact of his leadership, noting that ” There was no point in life where his voice shook in telling his truth. He was a vastly intelligent man whose passion has created quite a wide vacuum beyond this community.” The President emphasised Akeredolu’s commitment to serving through democratic means, stating that “he recognised that the most pragmatic path to serving humanity is to present ourselves willingly to be chosen by the people.” He commended his, “strength of character and conviction”, acknowledging the sacrifices he made to serve his community. While acknowledging the grief of the nation, Tinubu emphasised that this day was not just about mourning, saying, “Today is a day of remembrance, a day to pay our respects, a day to reflect on the fact that our friend and brother served humanity to the best of his abilities.” Also, Aiyedatiwa said his late principal used the instrument of governance to intervene in different sectors of the state, including education, health services, and infrastructural development, among others. “You are all here to pay your friend, our leader, and our governor last respect because of the relationship that he had with all of you at one time or another. Some of you were his childhood friends of over 60 years; some of you his professional colleagues; some former governors; some of you from the community he hailed from; and some of you from the church. “You are all here because he stood for something: good governance and the rule of law. He means a lot to different people, and that is why he has been described in different words. He was a courageous leader, a fighter, and a warrior. How can we forget him so soon? It is not possible because he lives on. “Sometimes we wonder how he decided to leave us so soon. Why can’t God give him more years to still stay with us? A real husband to the wife, a real father to the children, a leader and governor for the state for many years, and loyal friends to all of you. Why did God take him home so soon? “They say good people don’t live for too long; I think he is one of them. For me, I cannot forget him so soon because we share a lot together. How can I forget those political, physical, and dusty roads that we have travelled together since 2012?” Earlier, in his funeral sermon, the Primate of the Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, Most Rev. Dr. Henry Ndukuba, represented by the Anglican Bishop of Ikwerre, Rivers State, Most Rev. Dr Blessing Enyindah described the late Akeredolu as a man who contributed his quota to the development of the country. Besides, he urged Tinubu to act fast and address the increasing hardship facing Nigerians. The cleric said, “May I on behalf of Nigerians pray and call on the President, Senator Bola Tinubu to do something to reduce the hardship faced by Nigerians. “We have the hope he would do it because he promised us renewed hope and according to him, it is his turn, so the turn and opportunity have been given to him now. We are waiting and expecting the fulfilment of the renewed hope. “We plead with him to do it fast because time, that is four or eight years as the case may be, is brief and the time is running.”",

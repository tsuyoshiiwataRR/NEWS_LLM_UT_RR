    "text": "Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin announced the expulsion of Mahjoub Mahjoubi, an imam, for making contentious remarks regarding the French flag. Mahjoubi, who has resided in France for 38 years after migrating from Tunisia, faced swift deportation following a video surfacing online where he allegedly referred to the tricolor flag as “satanic” and having “no value with Allah,” [as reported by BBC.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68378736) Despite denying any intention to disrespect, Mahjoubi’s remarks sparked controversy, leading to his arrest earlier in the week. The subsequent expulsion was facilitated by France’s revamped immigration laws, celebrated by Darmanin for their efficiency in deporting foreign residents. The expulsion order, shared by French media, cited Mahjoubi’s promotion of a regressive and intolerant image of Islam, potentially fueling behavior contrary to republican values. Accusations of encouraging discrimination against women, tensions with the Jewish community, and jihadist radicalization were also levied against him, including derogatory references to Jewish individuals. Darmanin highlighted the swift execution of the expulsion less than 12 hours after Mahjoubi’s arrest, emphasizing the government’s commitment to maintaining firmness and bolstering national security. The immigration reforms, aimed at strengthening France, prioritize the deportation of individuals posing a grave threat to public order or with criminal convictions.",

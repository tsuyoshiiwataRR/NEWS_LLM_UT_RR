Religious freedom is being targeted.\n~RYT SED FRED~\nReligious convictions and freedoms are enshrined in law.\nIf someone's faith doesn't allow for or condone sexual deviancy, those individuals can't be forced to acknowledge others who do participate in such according to the demands of them.\nWhat right does anyone have:; to impose special distinctions in favor of those sexually deviant individuals, that serve to eradicate the faith and conviction others might have contrary to that?\nWhile it is not right for me to demand you worship or believe as I do, It is also not right for you to force me to believe as you do if you are sexually deviant and my faith says to associate with or acknowledge such is a sin.\nBy being forced to acknowledge sexually deviant lifestyle and/or gender specific terms or preferences, religious freedom is being egregiously eviscerated.\nIt is essentially saying religion is no longer a protected freedom or right.\nIndividuals who have a strong conviction in such matters can't be forced to accept something their religion deems unacceptable.\nThe non religious views of people doesn't mean those people get to negate the practice of one following their religion in such capacity.\nIt's a violation of law that has long upheld those religious convictions as being un-revokable.\nThis is a major issue.\nWhich is why the following Supreme Court opinion is so volatile.\nThe comment section is disturbing in the following article, as is the article itself.\nThere are people that want to do away with religious freedom and liberty that has always enshrined the right for people to practice long held and established religious views on this.\nSupreme Court justice slams MO court, says it shows ‘danger’ of same-sex marriage decision\n[\nChasing the dream....realizing the Revelation. ~Intrepid searcher~\nEcclesiastes 12:13 “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.”\nPage 1\nPrevious Page\nNext Page",

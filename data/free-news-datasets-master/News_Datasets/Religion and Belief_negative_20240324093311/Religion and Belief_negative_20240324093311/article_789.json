    "text": "A man who served as the youth pastor of a church in southern Delaware for over two decades has been arrested on child pornography charges, state prosecutors said Friday. James Dryden, 72, was arrested last week following an investigation by the [Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force](https://www.icactaskforce.org/) led by the state’s police and justice officials.

According to the CyberTips — [reports by a member of the public or an electronic service provider](https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/funding/performance-measures/performance-measures-ICAC.pdf) of a suspected online enticement of children for sexual acts and other crimes — authorities learned that Dryden’s IP address had accessed and downloaded the explicit content. After receiving the tips, authorities conducted a search of Dryden’s residence and found additional pornographic images involving children on some of his personal devices. Dryden was charged with 10 felony counts of dealing in child pornography, authorities said. He was taken to Sussex Correctional Institution on a $500,000 cash bail. “The evidence in this investigation is deeply disturbing,” Attorney General Kathy Jennings said in a statement. “Nothing is more important than protecting our kids, and I’m grateful for the members of the ICAC Task Force who dedicate their lives to keeping our most vulnerable citizens safe.” Dryden was not charged with contacting a child, prosecutors noted. There’s currently no knowledge of any victims associated with the church. Dryden served as the youth pastor at Stein Highway Church of God for more than 20 years, according to police. However, Dan Southern, a senior pastor at the church, told WRDE he hadn’t been [“active as a children’s worker”](https://www.wrde.com/seaford-pastor-arrested-on-child-pornography-charges/article_c9ea7b88-d26b-11ee-90e7-87bfe00d52b1.html) for approximately three years.",

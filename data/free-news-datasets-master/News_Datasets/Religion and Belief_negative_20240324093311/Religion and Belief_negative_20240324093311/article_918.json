    "text": "Bengaluru: In a huge embarrassment, the Congress-led state government failed to pass the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill in the Legislative Council. The bill was defeated as the BJP-JDS combined had more numbers than than ruling Congress in the upper house The bill was tabled by Muzarai Minister Ramalinga Reddy on Friday evening, The ruling party members were only a handful in numbers in the council expecting no surprise. But, the opposition BJP had planned a strategy to stall the bill. Most of the BJP and JDS members were present in the house when the bill was taken up for consideration. After opposition leader Kota Srinivas Poojary opposed the bill, a voice vote was conducted in which the opposition had the higher number and the Dy Chairman MK Pranesh ruled against the bill. Earlier, The Muzrai Minister said that due to a lack of members in the house, he would retable the bill on Monday, but, the request was rejected by the Dy Chairman. According to the Bill, 10 per cent of the gross income of temples whose gross annual income exceeds Rs 1 crore will be put in the common pool. Also, 5 per cent of the gross income in respect of institutions whose gross annual income exceeds Rs 10 lakh but is less than Rs 1 crore, will be used for the pool. The state government had said that the money collected would be used to develop smaller temples and the welfare of priests. The opposition BJP had termed the bill as an 'anti-Hindu' policy.",

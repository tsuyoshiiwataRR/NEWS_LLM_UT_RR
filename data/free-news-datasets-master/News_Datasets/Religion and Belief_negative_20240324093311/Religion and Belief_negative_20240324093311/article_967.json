He was arrested in October of that year and subsequently booked under the draconian law Public Safety Act (PSA). A cleric and a charismatic crowd-puller, Maulana Barkati was released in 2020 after being kept in illegal detention by the occupation authorities for four years. He was again arrested in August, last year. Later, his wife was also arrested in November the same year. Barkati is presently lodged in Srinagar Central Jail.\n //www.urdupoint.com/en/business/currency-rate-in-pakistan-dollar-euro-pou-1798329.html\"> 2 hours ago\n</a>\nCurrency Rate In Pakistan - Dollar, Euro, Pound, Riyal Rates On 24 February 2024\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/business/today-gold-rate-in-pakistan-24-february-2024-1798324.html\"> 3 hours ago\n</a>\nToday Gold Rate in Pakistan 24 February 2024\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/international-conference-on-advances-in-civil-1798277.html\"> 12 hours ago\n</a>\nInternational Conference on advances in Civil, environmental engineering conclud ..\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/pakistani-business-media-tycoon-zafar-siddiq-1798276.html\nPakistani business, passes away in Dubai\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/ashrafi-stresses-religious-diversity-as-key-t-1798275.html\nAshrafi stresses religious diversity as key to Pakistan's harmony\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/phc-cj-urges-lawyers-to-play-role-in-provisio-1798274.html\nPHC CJ urges lawyers to play role in provision of justice to people\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/chief-justice-shc-inaugurates-civil-court-bui-1798273.html\nChief Justice SHC inaugurates civil court building in Thana Bula Khan\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/lawyers-to-elect-office-bearers-members-of-s-1798272.html\nLawyers to elect office bearers, members of SHCBA Hyderabad\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/kppsc-notifies-85-selected-candidates-for-app-1798271.html\nKPPSC notifies 85 selected\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/issi-hosts-roundtable-on-sco-pakistans-po-1798270.html\nISSI hosts roundtable on SCO, Pakistan’s policy priorities, opportunities\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/cm-sends-summary-for-pa-session-1798269.html\nCM sends summary for PA session\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/iranian-fm-congratulates-caretaker-govt-on-co-1798268.html\nIranian FM congratulates caretaker govt on conduct of parliamentary elections\nMore Stories From Pakistan\n-\n‘India using rape of women as a weapon of war to suppress Kashmiris’ struggle’54 minutes ago\n-\nAn attempt to smuggle hashish worth Rs millions foiled in operation on Indus Highway10 hours ago\n-\nCovid infection may not be responsible for memory problems & fatigue: Study10 hours ago\n-\nKhawaja Asif stresses national unity, consensus building11 hours ago\n-\nGovernor expresses regret on Labor rooms not functioning in most of Balochistan’s districts11 hours ago\n-\nAJK President condoles demise of Pir Mazhar Shah11 hours ago\n-\nElection Manifesto Implementation top priority: Kundi11 hours ago\n-\nInternational Conference on advances in Civil, environmental engineering concludes12 hours ago\n-\nPakistani business, passes away in Dubai12 hours ago\n-\nAshrafi stresses religious diversity as key to Pakistan's harmony12 hours ago\n-\nPHC CJ urges lawyers to play role in provision of justice to people12 hours ago\n-\nChief Justice SHC inaugurates civil court building in Thana Bula Khan12 hours ago",

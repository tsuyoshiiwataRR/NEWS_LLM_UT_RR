    "text": "Le Figaro Bordeaux\nThey practiced hijama on their clients, a traditional medicine popular among Muslims who see it as prophetic care.\nThe practice, under the guise of rigor, consists of incising one or more parts of a person's body to place suction cups there and\n“extract harmful substances”\nusing the suction mechanism.\nIn Arabic,\nhijama\ndesignates the act of sucking an infant at its mother's breast.\nReported by the Gironde prefecture to the courts in December 2022, the couple of residents of Mérignac were referred to the Bordeaux public prosecutor's office this Thursday.\nFrench and Muslim, Pierre DJ, 46 years old, and his partner Isabelle P., 38 years old, were introduced to hijama in Morocco, where the first had followed training.\n“This training allowed him to practice first in Morocco, until 2020, and upon his return to France in September 2020, Pierre DJ continued while knowing that his Moroccan certificate had no value in France\n, ”\nspecifies to\nFigaro\n, the Bordeaux prosecutor's office.\nAlso read “Tomorrow land of Allah, today land of disbelievers”: 2 new ordeals tagged in Dordogne\nJudicial controls\nSearched in November 2023 following investigations, then interviewed in police custody in February, the couple differ in their version of the facts.\nWhile Isabelle P. admits to an illegal practice of medicine, her companion considers that hijama is\n“a treatment”\n, which\n“has virtues in terms of well-being and relaxation”.\nHe also denies any correlation between this practice and his conversion to Islam in 2009.\nSummoned in March for a judgment at the Bordeaux criminal court on charges of “illegal exercise of the profession of doctor” and “deceptive commercial practices”\n,\nthe couple was placed under judicial supervision.\nThe two individuals are prohibited from leaving Gironde, from holding a weapon and from working as caregivers.\nTheir identity card and passport were also confiscated.",

    "text": "SHREVEPORT, La. -- Antioch Baptist Church in Shreveport is one of the oldest churches of the community.\nThe story of the church goes back to the late 1860s. It was formed by a group of former slaves.\nThe church needs repairs.\nThat congregation created their own church in 1903 and even constructed the building that’s standing today. From that moment, history was made.\nBut now, the 121-year-old building is running into some issues and needs repairs. The ceiling is coming down, and paint is chipping from the wall.\n“This church was built in 1903. Famous architect was N.S. Allen and N.S. Allen is reported as being the architect that designed and built the Antioch Baptist Church. If you look at the walls, the structure of the ceiling, the lights hang, all this from 1903,” said the Rev. Bruce Carroll, the 18th pastor of the church.\nRepairs are estimated up to $3 million.\nIt was established as the first African American Baptist Church on April 23, 1866. Carroll says although the church is behind on repairs, the building witnesses the many accomplishments of African Americans.\n“As we walked through Jim Crow, came through Jim Crow, racism, civil rights, Antioch Church was right in the middle of that. You can't have any of the churches unless you start with the mother. And we always call the mother church. So those churches came out of this church and organized. But this is the first church, the first African-American church in Shreveport,” said Carroll.\nJ. B. Green was one of the first pastors of the church.\nThe Rev. John Austin Jones was the first pastor of the church. He also established the 13th District Academy, which was an all black school for African Americans. His church buildings and schools were destroyed, but he kept going.\n“As a people that we've always been resilient, as a people. We always kept fighting no matter what happened, we would pick ourselves up, by our bootstraps, you know, and roll up our sleeves and go to work for something better for the communities coming behind us,” said Carroll.\nCarroll says the church still shows its resilience as the leadership is searching for grants to help refurbish the building. The cost is estimated to be around $3 million. He’s asking the community for help.\n“We've set up a fund that is strictly dedicated to rehabbing this current property,” said Carroll.\nHe wants to save the structure because it’s a historic site. He wants the building to be used for worship, weddings and other events.\nTo make a donation, visit their website at antioch1866church.org\nReport a typo on this article",

    "text": "Catholic World News\nPope opposes reform on abuse, victims’ advocate charges\nFebruary 22, 2024\n»\nContinue to this story on Catholic World Report\nCWN Editor's Note: “I believe that at heart Pope Francis is opposed to reform,” the head of a group advocating for sex-abuse victims has said.\nAnne Barrett Doyle, the head of BIshopAccountability.org, made her remark to Catholic World Report after a press conference in which women reported gross abuses by Father Marko Rupnik. She said:\nWhen Pope Francis speaks out in anger, it’s almost always about what he calls the evil of gossip. I have come to believe that he sees victims as accusers, as bearers of gossip, not as the Church’s own wounded deserving of help and compassion and justice.The above note supplements, highlights, or corrects details in the original source (link above).\n[About CWN news coverage.](/news/about_our_coverage/)\nFor all current news,\n[visit our News home page](/news).\nSound Off!

    "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday granted bail to a lawyer booked for allegedly outraging the modesty of his wife and attempting to convert her to Islam [Bhurekhan @ Akramkhan Ganikhan Pathan Vs State of Gujarat].\nA bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan noted that the criminal complaint filed by his wife implicated the accused man's entire family. After considering the facts of the case, the Court proceeded to allow his bail plea.\n\"Considering the facts of the case, the appellant deserves to be enlarged on bail. For that purpose, the appellant shall be produced before the Trial Court within a period of one week from today. The Trial Court shall enlarge the appellant on bail on appropriate terms and conditions ,\" the bench directed.\nJustice Abhay S Oka and Justice Ujjal Bhuyan The bench was hearing the an appeal challenging a September 2023 Gujarat High Court order refusing the appellant bail. The High Court had upheld a trial court decision to reject bail, leading to the accused (appellant) filing an appeal before the apex court.\nThe appellant had been accused of trying to convert his wife to Islam. The complainant-wife had also alleged that the accused had threatened that he would make an intimate clip of theirs viral.\nThe High Court had reasoned that there was a prima facie criminal case made out and the accused was likely to tamper with evidence. Therefore, it rejected the accused man's bail plea.\nThe Supreme Court, however, has allowed the appeal against this High Court ruling.\nAdvocates Mohd Yasin, Shariq Nisar, Yashovardhan Oza, Md Tanvir, Bilal Kagzi, Suyash Tripathi, Yamin Bisht, and Anas Tanwir represented the accused.\nAdvocates Deepanwita Priyanka, Swati Ghildiyal and Devyani Bhatt appeared for the Gujarat government.\n[Read order]\nAttachment PDF Bhurekhan vs State of Gujarat.pdf Preview Supreme Court of India Advocate Gujarat High Court Bail Lawyer Outraging Modesty",

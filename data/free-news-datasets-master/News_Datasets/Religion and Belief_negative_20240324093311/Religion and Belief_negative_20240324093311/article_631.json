    "text": "NEW DELHI: In a late night development, the Assam cabinet on Friday took the first big step towards introducing the Uniform Civil Code in the state by scrapping the Assam Muslim Marriage & Divorce Registration Act 1935.The move comes less than three weeks after Uttarakhand became the first state to pass the Uniform Civil Code. Cabinet minister Jayanta Mallabarua termed it as a step towards achieving UCC. He stated that now all matters pertaining to Muslim marriages and divorces would be taken care of under the Special Marriages Act. The decision was taken today in a cabinet meeting which was chaired by chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. \\\"The CM had recently stated that we are moving towards Uniform Civil Code (UCC). In this journey, a very important decision has been taken. The Assam Muslim Marriage & Divorce Registration Act 1935, under which 94 Muslim registrars are still functioning, has been repealed today. The cabinet has today ended this Act and now under this act no Muslim marriage or divorce would be registered. Since we have a Special Marriages Act, hence we want all matters settled through that particular Act,\\\" said Mallabarua. The cabinet minister further said that through this decision they are also trying to curb child marriage in the state.",

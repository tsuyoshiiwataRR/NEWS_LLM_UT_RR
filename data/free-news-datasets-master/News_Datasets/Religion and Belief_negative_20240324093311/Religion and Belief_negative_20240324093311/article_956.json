    "text": "Assam repeals Muslim Marriage Act\n\"The District Commissioner and the District Registrar will now be in charge of registering Muslim marriages and divorces under the new structure,\" announced Himanta Biswa Sarma\nIn a major development, the long-standing Assam Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Act of 1935 was repealed by the state government on Friday.\nThe decision was taken during a state cabinet meeting on Friday night, 23 February chaired by Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.\nIt comes three weeks after\nUttarakhand became the first state to enact Uniform Civil Code legislation.\nCabinet Minister Jayanta Mallabaruah referred to it as a major step toward a\nUniform Civil Code (UCC).\nHe emphasised that going forward, all matters pertaining to Muslim marriages and divorces would be governed by the Special Marriages Act.\n\"The District Commissioner and the District Registrar will now be in charge of registering Muslim marriages and divorces under the new structure. The 94 Muslim registrars who were employed under the revoked Act will also be released from their positions and given a lump sum payment of Rs 2 lakh,\" he told reporters.\nMallabarua also emphasised the decision's wider ramifications, especially in light of the state's efforts to prohibit child marriage. He pointed out that juvenile marriages had been made easier by the antiquated 1935 Act, which was a holdover from the British Empire.\n\"The administration intends to address the issue of child marriage, which is defined as the union of individuals under the ages of 18 for women and 21 for men, by repealing this Act,\" the minister added.\nPublished: 24 Feb 2024, 9:44 AM",

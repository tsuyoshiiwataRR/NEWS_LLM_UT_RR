    "text": "×\nPlease verify\nEach day we overwhelm your brains with the content you've come to love from the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website.\nBut Facebook is...you know, Facebook. Their algorithm hides our ranting and raving as best it can. The best way to stick it to Zuckerface?\nSign up for the LWC News Blast! Get your favorite right-wing commentary delivered directly to your inbox!\nArticles\nFebruary 23, 2024\nWatch MSNBC's latest freakout: You're a Christian Nationalist if you believe rights come from God and not government\nTell me you have not read any of our founding documents without telling me you have not read any of our founding documents.\nShe will go first:\nAt its very core, the main problem with Progressivism is the belief that the Government is de facto God. And when you believe that, there is no such thing as “inalienable” rights that you are born with. And because of that, rights can change as society “progresses.”\nThe problem with all that is that none of that is true. This country was founded on the idea that humans are born with rights and that the government's sole purpose is to protect those rights. And when you are born with something, it’s not the government's right to take that away.\nSo even though this has been common sense since this country's founding and everyone who has read this little thing called “\nThe Declaration Of Independence '' would know all that - a guest on MSNBC is still freaking out over that realization.\n“The one thing that unites them as Christian nationalists…. is that they believe our rights as Americans, as all human beings, don’t come from any earthly authority. They don’t come from Congress, they don’t come from the Supreme Court, they come from God,” she said.\nSay it with me: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable rights.”\nIf she believes our rights come from SCOTUS and Congress, does that mean that abortion is not a right? Because by her moral reasoning, that would be 100 percent true.\nWhat is she even trying to say here? That government comes before God? Because I think that’s exactly what she is trying to say.\nHow much more clear can our founding documents get?\n“Law of Nature and Nature's God.”\nIs she that naive she has just never read any of these things. I understand there is no requirement to be what one would call “smart” to appear on MSNBC, but this level of ignorance is just astonishing.\nOur money says “In God We Trust.” It does not say “In Congress We Trust.” It does not say “In SCOTUS We Trust.”\nIn other words, it’s not a belief. It’s a fact that this country was founded on the “idea” that rights come from God.\nHonestly, I did not think it was possible to be this naive.\nThe difference between a right and a privilege is that rights cannot be taken away. And by turning the government into God you de facto have no rights, only privileges.\nIt’s baffling that people take issue with any of this. But it’s 2024 and these are the same people that think gender is a conspiracy theory so I guess the foolishness is not that shocking.\nFULL DESPOT!

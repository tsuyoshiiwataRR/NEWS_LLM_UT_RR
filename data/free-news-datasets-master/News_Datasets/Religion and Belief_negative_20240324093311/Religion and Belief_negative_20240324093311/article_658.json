    "text": "Congress Suffers Blow As Karnataka Temple Tax Proposal Defeated In Upper House The bill, which had previously passed in the state assembly, aimed to collect a 10% tax from temples with revenues over ₹1 crore and a 5% tax from those generating incomes between ₹10 lakh and ₹1 crore. The defeat in the legislative council comes amid accusations of the Congress government implementing policies detrimental to Hindu interests. Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah (File image) Photo : PTI In Karnataka, the Congress-led government faced a setback as a bill proposing a 10% tax on the income of temples with revenues exceeding ₹1 crore was rejected in the state legislative council. The bill, named the 'Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Bill 2024,' had caused controversy, with the BJP opposition branding it as 'Anti-Hindu.' The legislation, having previously passed in the state assembly, aimed to impose a 10% tax on temples with revenues over ₹1 crore and a 5% tax on those earning between ₹10 lakh and ₹1 crore. The defeat in the legislative council raised accusations of the Congress government implementing policies perceived as detrimental to Hindu interests. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, holding a majority in the legislative council with 35 MLCs compared to Congress's 30, played a crucial role in the bill's rejection. The JD(S) contributed eight MLCs, and there was one independent candidate, with one seat remaining vacant. Amid criticism from the BJP, state ministers Ramalinga Reddy and Dinesh Gundu Rao defended the bill's amendments. Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy accused the BJP of being \"anti-Hindu\" and noted that similar amendments were made during their tenure in 2011. Health Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao argued that the bill aimed to benefit temples, dismissing BJP's opposition as misleading. Former Chief Minister Yediyurappa questioned the scrutiny of only Hindu temples' incomes, raising concerns about fairness in comparison to other religions. In response to allegations, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah dismissed the claims as \"misrepresented,\" asserting that they were intended to \"mislead the public\" and \"polarize people along communal lines for political leverage.\" [Latest News](https://www.timesnownews.com/latest-news) End of Article Subscribe to our daily Newsletter!

    "text": "CHICAGO (WBBM NEWSRADIO) - There’s some debate and confusion about the future of a historic Chicago Catholic church. Our Lady of the Lourdes Church, located in the 4600 block of N. Ashland, is set to close for good in mid-May. There are reports that parts of the parish, including a school building across the street that was sold to a developer, would be converted into dozens of apartments. The Archdiocese of Chicago told WBBM plans for the more than 100-year-old church building are not set in stone. They added that they are aware of a push by residents to preserve Our Lady of Lourdes from potential demolition. Those residents have not been in contact with the pastor or Archdiocese at any point. Here is the full statement from the Archdiocese of Chicago: “Saint Mary of the Lake and ​Our Lady of Lourdes Parish previously sold the vacant school and convent buildings located across the street from Our Lady of Lourdes Church, however, the parish has not yet decided on its plans for the church building. The group of parishioners organizing to raise money has not approached the pastor or the archdiocese.” Listen to our new podcast Looped In: Chicago\nListen to WBBM Newsradio now on Audacy!\nSign up and follow WBBM Newsradio\nFacebook | Twitter | Instagram I TikTok",

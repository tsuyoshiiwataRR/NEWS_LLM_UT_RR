    "text": "HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (CBS12) — Police issued a warrant Thursday for a Hollywood man accused of animal cruelty he claims is part of his religious beliefs, records show. The investigation began in early December last year when the Hollywood Police Department responded to a complaint about dog fighting at the adjacent home of 38-year-old Jonathan Corraliza, according to the arrest warrant. The neighbor said this was an ongoing issue, and they had video to prove it, the warrant stated. An HPD officer arrived at the neighbor's home off Coolidge Street, and they showed him a two-minute video of three larger dogs attacking a small, gray pit bull puppy at a neighboring property, according to HPD. The officer watched as the three dogs bit and pulled at the puppy’s skin, dragging it around the yard. It was clear from the video the puppy was seriously injured, the warrant stated. He went to the house depicted in the neighbor’s video and saw for himself several dogs enclosed in the back yard, including a small, gray pit bull puppy that looked wounded from afar, police said.

The officer was able to get a closer look at the dog, which had cornered itself in the fenced-in yard. He noted severe gashes causing the dog’s neck and ears to bleed, the warrant stated. The officer questioned Corraliza about the dog’s health, and Corraliza acknowledged he would take it to a veterinarian to have its wounds treated, according to the incident report. That evening, Hollywood Code Compliance Officer Joshua Ricky visited Corraliza’s house on 1507 Coolidge St. to offer services for the injured puppy, but no one answered, so he left a note at the address, the report stated. Two days later, police received another call from a neighbor worried about the health of a puppy at the same address. Rickey and other officers arrived at the house and found the same dog lying maimed and weak in the back yard with several injuries on its body, the report stated. “It appeared to Officer Rickey that without intervention, the dog was likely to succumb to her injuries,” HPD reported. Officers couldn’t touch the dog without it crying out in pain, they said. They took the puppy to the VCA Hollywood Animal Hospital on Hollywood Boulevard, all the while trying in vain to contact Corraliza. It wasn’t until the next evening on Dec. 10 when Corraliza called Rickey and said he did in fact take the dog to a veterinarian in Miami who said that it needed to be euthanized, according to the warrant. But he instead brought the puppy back to his house without treating it, Corraliza is reported to have said. Rickey pressed him on the name of the mentioned vet, but Corraliza reportedly hung up on him. Moments later, Rickey received a text from that same number stating that due to Corraliza’s religious beliefs in Santeria, he was “intentionally not providing medical attention to the dog and instead would heal the dog himself,” the report stated. If the dog wasn’t taken to the hospital when it was, it would have likely died of its many wounds and other ailments, including anemia, dehydration and hookworm infection, the veterinary hospital staff reportedly informed the officers. After the call with Rickey, Corraliza disappeared, according to a HPD media release. He was last seen in the Orlando area. Corraliza was charged with aggravated animal cruelty, and HPD urges the public to help locate him. If seen, they recommend contacting the department at 954-764-4357(HELP) or 954-967-4567. Tipsters can e-mail or text to hollywoodpdtips@hollywoodfl.org. Information can also be given to Broward Crime Stoppers at 954- 493-8477(TIPS) or browardcrimestoppers.org. The city was granted permission to remove the dog from the owner’s custody and transfer it to Paws2Care Coalition.",

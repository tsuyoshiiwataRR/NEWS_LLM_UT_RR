    "text": "Rajasthan Education Minister Madan Dilawar has suspended two teachers from a government school in Kota district amid allegations that they were involved in activities linked to religious conversion and [‘love jihad’](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/muslim-youth-beaten-up-love-jihad-railway-police-fir-8895086/). Another teacher is also facing an investigation in this regard. The suspension orders of the teachers, posted at a school in Kota’s Sangod block, were issued on Thursday night. The minister released a video statement regarding the issue. “We got the information that the name of a Hindu girl in secondary school was changed to a Muslim name. There is a conspiracy of religious conversion and love jihad going on in the area. When we got the information, we took steps and suspended two teachers and an investigation is ongoing into another teacher. After investigation, if it is found that they were involved in these acts, the three of them will be terminated from the job…,” Dilawar said in the video. The suspended teachers were identified as Mirza Mujahid and Firoz Khan. The action came after Sarva Hindu Samaj, Sangod, sent a memorandum to the Education Minister, alleging that activities of religious conversion and love jihad have been going on in the school since 2019. The memorandum also alleged that three teachers have connections with banned outfits and that they had links to Pakistani groups. The memorandum also stated that an [FIR](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/fir-cognizable-offence-ipc-explained-7780266/) had previously been registered in this regard at Sangod police station, but no action was taken. Sikandar Kher, son of Kirron Kher and Amitabh Bachchan's old business partner Gautam Berry, opened up about his bond with childhood friend Abhishek Bachchan. He considers Abhishek's daughter Aaradhya as his own child, and praised his generosity and affection. The two have been close since childhood.",

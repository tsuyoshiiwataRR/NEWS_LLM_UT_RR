They want to be in our bedrooms telling us what we can and cannot do.\nTheir entire movement is a rejection of American ideas.\nThey're far more aligned with authoritarian theocracies like Iran or the Taliban's Sharia dictatorship than the United States.\nEach and every one of them should buy a plane ticket there and leave us the f**k alone.\nQuoting:\nAnonymous Coward 80478677\n1) False, nobody is trying to ban sex.\n2) Good.\n3) False, almost nobody cares what you do in the privacy of your own home. What we would ban is LGBT indoctrination involving kids.\n4) False, almost nobody wants to ban IVF.\n5) Good, if it's late term abortion for frivolous reasons.\n6) Good.\n7) False.\nDon't conflate the 'freedom to have late-term abortion without reason with libertarian values. You are free to smoke, but you are not free to blow smoke in my face. In the same way, a woman is free to do as she pleases, but she should not be 'free' to kill a baby human being that you have knowingly created, and that is what frivolous late-term abortion is.\nQuoting:\nAnonymous Coward 77947460\nI would like to add to my post that banning sex change operations is perfectly reasonable, because having such a major operation requires both adult consent and a sane mind. For example, if somebody requests that a doctor cut off a perfectly healthy arm, it would be unethical for the doctor to comply, because the request itself demonstrates insanity, and an insane person cannot give adult consent.\nIn the exact same way, the request for a sex change operation is inherently insane, and so it's unethical to comply with that request, even if the requester is an adult.\nThis is less a freedom issue and more an issue about the bounds of mental illness. Woke tools do not believe that 'transgenderism' is mental illness, but we know better.\nPage\n1\n2\nTop\nPrevious Page\nNext Page\nBack to Forum\nPost New Thread\nReply\nView Favorites\nDisclaimer / Copyright Info\n-\nPrivacy Policy\n-\nTerms Of Use\n-\nCancellation Policy / Billing Help\nMail\nWebmaster\nwith questions or comments about this site.\nCopyright © 1999 - 2023 Godlikeproductions.com\nPage generated in 0.047s (8 queries)",

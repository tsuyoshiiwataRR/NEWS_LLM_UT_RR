    "text": "Harvard University subpoenaed by House Republicans for alleged obstruction of antisemitism probe\nFebruary 23, 2024\nHouse Republicans have subpoenaed Harvard University for allegedly obstructing a committee’s ongoing antisemitism investigation.\nThe subpoena gives Harvard a deadline of March 4 at 5:00 p.m. to submit materials requested by the House Education and the Workforce Committee related to antisemitic acts going back to 2021,\naccording to ABC News.\n“Harvard’s continued failure to satisfy the Committee’s requests is unacceptable,” Education Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx said in a statement to the outlet. “I will not tolerate delay and defiance of our investigation while Harvard’s Jewish students continue to endure the firestorm of antisemitism that has engulfed its campus.”\nA spokesperson for Harvard told ABC News that the subpoenas were “unfortunate” and that the university did provide “fulsome” responses to requests by the committee.\nHarvard came under much scrutiny after its former president, Claudine Gay, testified before a hearing on antisemitism and was later called on to resign.\nDuring the House Education and the Workforce Committee hearing, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., questioned Gay, asking, “At Harvard, does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Harvard’s rules of bullying and harassment?”",

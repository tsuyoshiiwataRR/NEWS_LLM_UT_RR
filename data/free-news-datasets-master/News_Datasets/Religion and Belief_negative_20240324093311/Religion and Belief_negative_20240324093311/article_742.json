    "text": "Jakarta – Chairman of the Ansor Youth Movement (GP) Addin Jauharudin opened his voice regarding the chaos at Ustaz Syafiq Riza Basalamah’s recital at the Assalam Mosque, Purimas Housing Complex, Surabaya, East Java. Addin confirmed GP Ansor does not have the DNA of rejecting or disbanding Islamic religious studies, but only a firm stance against intolerant movements. “What happened was the firm attitude of GP Ansor cadres towards the intolerant movement in the name of recitation, the content of which was to attack and insult the teachings and practices of the Nahdliyin people,” said Addin in a written statement, as reported detikJatim Friday (23/2/2024). Addin’s statement was in response to the chaos in Surabaya due to religious studies that brought in lecturers who were considered to be habitually insulting the teachings and practices of Nahdlatul Ulama. In addition, the recitation was carried out in the midst of a population where the majority of their practice adhered to NU teachings. “The cadres of Ansor and Banser have been tasked with overseeing recitations. We are committed to this. But we are firm and will not take a single step back from recitations that undermine Indonesia ’s national identity, are intolerant, build radical narratives, blaspheme NU’s practices, let alone want to change state system,” wrote Addin. Addin said that after the investigation team was sent to the field, his party found a number of incidents that were detrimental to Ansor, namely the denial of commitments that had been agreed upon by both parties. “There was a breach of the agreement that had been made by both parties. That the committee would not bring in Syafiq Riza Basalamah, but in the field it is different,” he added. Read more here .

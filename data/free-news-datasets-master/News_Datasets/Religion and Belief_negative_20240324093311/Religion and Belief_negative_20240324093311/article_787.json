    "text": "Last Updated on February 23, 2024 An MSNBC panelist on the All In with Chris Hayes program claimed that the rights of Americans don’t come from God, but rather from the federal government, specifically naming Congress and the Supreme Court as the arbiters of human rights. Those who echo America’s Founding Fathers in believing that human rights come from God and not man, are Trump-aligned Christian Nationalists, she said. Politico reporter Heidi Przybyla, who has obsessively reported on her own [claims](https://web.archive.org/web/20240223092051/https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/20/donald-trump-allies-christian-nationalism-00142086) that Christian Nationalists are preparing to seize control of the United States, appeared this week on MSNBC’s All In program, which was being guest hosted by Michael Steele, a failed RNC Chairman and anti-Trumper. While there, Przybyla claimed that the rights of Americans, and all human beings for that matter, do not come from God, but instead come from the government. “The one thing that unites all of them, because there’s many different groups orbiting Trump, the thing that unites them as Christian Nationalists, not Christians by the way because Christian Nationalism is very different, is that they believe that our rights as Americans, as all human beings, don’t come from any earthly authority,” Przybyla said. Christian Nationalists, she went on, believe that their basic rights “don’t come from Congress, they don’t come from the Supreme Court, they come from God.” Hear the Remarks in the [Video Clip](https://twitter.com/WadeMiller_USMC/status/1761015125673222572) Below: Here [@MSNBC]helpfully makes it clear their disdain for Christians in America. She says that if you believe that your rights come from God, you aren’t a Christian, you are a Christian nationalist. Somehow they seem to not mention that our own founding documents make this… [pic.twitter.com/WTLMqcqTzg] — Wade Miller (@WadeMiller_USMC) [February 23, 2024] The absurd remarks from Heidi Przybyla come as Christ-hating uni-party members launch an all-out anti-Christian offensive against Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, as Christian Americans, and other people of faith, including Muslims, finally begin standing up to the radically globalist, pro-trans, pro-usury ruling class. At a recent rally in Tennessee, 45th President Trump pledged to establish a new task force to fight anti-Christian bias, and vowed that “No one will be touching the Cross of Christ under the Trump administration.” Trump also told supporters who gathered at the Nashville rally, a city in which a trans terrorist slaughtered 6 Christians, including 3 children last year, that the renewed Trump Administration “will protect God in our public square.”",

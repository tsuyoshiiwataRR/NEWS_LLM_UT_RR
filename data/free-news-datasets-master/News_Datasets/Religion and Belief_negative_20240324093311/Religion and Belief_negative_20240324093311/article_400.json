    "text": "( MENAFN - AzerNews)\nAbbas Ganbay Read more\nThe Armenian Foreign Ministry commented on the statements made by Israeli Ambassador to Armenia Yoel Lyon on January 1 about fascist Garegin Nzhdeh, Azernews reports.\nOn Garegin Nzhdeh's birthday, a group of people held a rally in front of his monument using Nazi symbols. After that, Israeli Ambassador to Armenia Yoel Lyon wrote on X that \"glorification of Garegin Nzhdeh, a Nazi collaborator, is unacceptable\" and \"the authorities should take a firm stance against any form of neo-Nazism and anti-Semitism.\"\nThe Armenian Foreign Ministry said it considers \"unacceptable any actions committed out of intolerance, on national or religious grounds, as well as speculations on this topic - whether for political, propaganda or other purposes.\"\n\"At the same time, foreign diplomats accredited in Armenia should show a respectful attitude,\" the statement reads.\nWe would like to remind you that last year the only synagogue in the country was set on fire by Armenian vandals in Yerevan. A video circulated on a social network shows local residents setting fire to the door of the synagogue with a flammable mixture.\nMENAFN23022024000195011045ID1107889987\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

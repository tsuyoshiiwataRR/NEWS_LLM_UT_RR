    "text": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) arrives for a House Republican caucus meeting at the U.S. Capitol on September 14, 2023 in Washington, DC. On Thursday Greene posted about Christian women dressing more “modest” as not to tempt Christian men. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene said Christian women should be dressing “nice and feminine” in efforts to avoid tempting Christian men.\nGreene, a Georgia Republican who is a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, has long faced backlash from both Democrats and Republicans over comments about Christianity. She was assailed for selling “Proud Christian Nationalist” T-shirts and saying during a 2022 Turning Point USA event that Christians should “live our lives and vote like we are nationalists.”\nIn a social media post Thursday, Greene criticized conservative Christian women she believes are “selling themselves short and not being good role models by conforming to the world’s sexualization of women,” noting that her statement may be an unpopular opinion.\n“If you are conservative and a Christian you know you don’t have to express yourself in sexual ways and you know you are attractive by dressing nice and feminine, and you can be beautiful and modest at the same time,” Greene wrote to X, formerly Twitter.\nShe continued: “Men will respect you more and think of you much more highly than just a sexual object for gratification. It’s also good to not tempt your Christian brothers and cause them to stumble.”\nGreene concluded the post by calling on Christian women to be an “example to girls and young women by displaying actions that our faith believes and not conform to the patterns of this fallen world.”\n“Be the light, don’t fall into the darkness,” she wrote.\nNewsweek reached out to Greene’s press office via email on Thursday for additional comment.\nHer post drew mixed reactions on social media, with some arguing Greene does not represent all of Christianity and should not be telling other women what they should be wearing.\n“You do NOT hold Christian values!!” posted X user @suzannebeme1.\n“Teeing up for The Handmaid’s Tale,” posted @adhd_beans.\n“Rich coming from @mtgreene but why is it a girl’s/woman’s responsibility to dress/act so as not to tempt ‘their Christian brothers & cause them to stumble.’ WHAT??? Isn’t that a lot of power being given to the weaker sex??? And tempting their brothers is a whole other issue,” posted @LauraTripp57.\n“This sounds like the exact speech they give to women in cults,” posted @ZPoet.\nOthers, however, voiced agreement with the Republican representative’s post.\n“Marge is right that men will respect women more if they respect themselves. Same goes with women respecting men. Ultimately it’s the brain that’s the most attractive element of any human. At least in the long run,” posted X user Paul A. Szypula.\n“They are. The culture in this nation must change,” posted X user Ryan Wasielewski.\nStart your unlimited Newsweek trial",

    "text": "Suffolk County police say they have arrested a man for trespassing and harassing congregants of a Melville mosque . Jordan Endler entered the Islamic Center of Melville, located at 118 East Old Neck Road, on Wednesday at 2:36 p.m. and made statements regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict, police say. Endler was asked to leave by members of the mosque but refused. Police were called and Endler left the location after police arrived. The incident was caught on camera. The man could be seen recording worshipers with his own phone, and positioning a baseball cap over his eyes. He shouted “free the Israeli hostages now,” and called the Muslim congregants “racist.” RELATED: Melville mosque members concerned for safety following outburst over Israel-Hamas conflict Mosque leaders say the outburst was initially not given enough attention by Suffolk County police. Islamic Center President Talaat Abdelmoneim says the man was released after speaking with officers. \"Why was he not locked up? If he did this in any other religion other than Muslims, would it be going like this? That’s really the concern,” Abdelmoneim said. Authorities say that following an investigation by hate crimes unit detectives, Endler, 46, was arrested at his East Northport home. Endler was charged with criminal trespass in the third degree and harassment in the second degree. He is scheduled to be arraigned today.",

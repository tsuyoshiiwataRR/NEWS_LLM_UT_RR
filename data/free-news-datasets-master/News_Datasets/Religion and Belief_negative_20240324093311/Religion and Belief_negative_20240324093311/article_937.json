    "text": "Jaipur: Two teachers of a government school in Rajasthan's Kota have been suspended for their alleged involvement in religious conversions and ties to proscribed terror outfits. Rajasthan Education Minister Madan Dilawar said that another teacher is facing probe in the incident. The suspension order was issued on Thursday night against Mirza Mujahid and Firoz Khan, reported ANI.The minister took action after Sarva Hindu Samaj, Sangod, sent a memorandum to him alleging that activities of religious conversion and love jihad have been taking place in the school since 2019. The memo also alleged that three teachers have connections with banned outfits and links to Pakistani groups. Sarva Hindu Samaj also said that no action was taken in the matter despite an FIR.Education Minister Dilawar on Friday released a video statement saying that strict action has been initiated against three teachers in a government senior secondary school at Khajuri Odpur village in Sangod.\"In the Khajoori village of Sangod panchayat samiti in Kota district, the religion of a girl in senior secondary school was mentioned as 'Islam' in the transfer certificate of a girl despite her being a Hindu. A conspiracy of religious conversion and 'love jihad' is happening there, Hindu girls are being forced to offer namaz - this has come to our notice,\" he said, quoted ANI.He said the teachers will be terminated from the job if they are found to be involved in these acts.\"As soon as this was brought to my notice, I decided to take strict action against three teachers. In this context, I suspended two teachers - Firoz Khan and Mirza Mujahideen. Further action is being taken against one Shabana. All three of them have been sent to Bikaner. I will take strict action against them after a detailed investigation. If needed, I will expel them,\" the state minister added.",

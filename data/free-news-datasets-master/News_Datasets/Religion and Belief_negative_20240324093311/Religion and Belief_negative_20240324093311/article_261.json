    "text": "A Canadian judge has deemed the intentional running over of five members of a Muslim family in 2021 to “constitute terrorist activity.” Canadian man gets life for running over Muslim family A Canadian judge has ruled that the intentional running over of a Muslim family in 2021 constitutes terrorist activity. Nathaniel Veltman, now 23, was found guilty of first-degree murder for the attack, which targeted the family because of their Islamic faith. Justice Served for Hate-Fueled Attack In a landmark ruling, Judge Pomerance emphasized the attack as a textbook example of terrorist motive and intent, highlighting the hate that fueled the offender’s actions. The terrorism designation acknowledges the ugliness that took the lives of the victims and the prevalence of hate in society. Impact on the Muslim Community The ruling has been welcomed by relatives of the victims, who acknowledged the hate that fueled the attack. This landmark decision sends a powerful message about the consequences of hate-fueled violence and the need to combat prejudice and racism in society. Veltman faces 25 years in prison without the option of parole for the attack on the Muslim family in London, Ontario.",

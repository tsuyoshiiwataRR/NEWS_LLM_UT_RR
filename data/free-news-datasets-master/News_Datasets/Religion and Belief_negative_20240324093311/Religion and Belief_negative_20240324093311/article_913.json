    "text": "This segment was low-hanging fruit, but it‚Äôs always a good reminder to know what your enemy is thinking and their end game, often televised on MSNBC and CNN. MSNBC is by far the worst of the two, and ex-NBC News reporter Heidi Przybyla, now with Politico, demonstrated that Thursday night with her screed against Christianity. Of course, it was framed under the guise of Christian nationalism. Still, the commentary was very much grounded in mainstream concepts about where rights come from, as Thomas Jefferson is the person who wrote about what Przybyla found unsettling (via [Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/opinion/msnbc-guest-panics-over-christians-believing-rights-come-from-god-instead-of-earthly-authority/)): Here‚Äî Wade Miller (@WadeMiller_USMC) [@MSNBC]helpfully makes it clear their disdain for Christians in America. She says that if you believe that your rights come from God, you aren‚Äôt a Christian, you are a Christian nationalist. Somehow they seem to not mention that our own founding documents make this‚Ä¶ [pic.twitter.com/WTLMqcqTzg] [February 23, 2024] After being asked how members of Congress were reacting to Speaker Mike Johnson‚Äôs (R-LA) leadership, which was characterized as an ‚Äúinfusion of Christian nationalism into the body politic of the House,‚Äù Przybyla proceeded to butcher her interpretation of the distinction between Christians and Christian nationalists. After warning that Christian nationalists ‚Äúhave a lot of power in Trump‚Äôs circle,‚Äù she insisted that ‚Äúthe one thing that unites all of them, because there‚Äôs many different groups orbiting Trump, but the thing that unites them as Christian nationalists ‚Äî not Christians, by the way, because Christian nationalist is very different ‚Äî is that they believe that our rights as Americans, as all human beings, don‚Äôt come from any earthly authority. They don‚Äôt come from Congress, they don‚Äôt come to the Supreme Court, they come from God.‚Äù Recommended Wild clip. This is one of their journos, not a pundit.‚Äî Guy Benson (@guypbenson) [https://t.co/8lLSfOiZl3] [February 23, 2024] During the pandemic, Przybyla [couldn‚Äôt accurately](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2020/04/16/nbc-reporter-again-peddles-shoddy-article-about-hydroxychloroquine-n2567092) comment on a story about an Arizona couple who allegedly took hydroxychloroquine, which led to deadly results. The outlet tried to blame Trump, but the pair ingested chloroquine phosphate, fish tank cleaner, which isn‚Äôt the same thing. Stop publishing garbage like this.‚Äî AG (@AGHamilton29) 1) Family doesn‚Äôt actually know cause of death. 2) Every drug has risks and side effects. Implication here is that this drug is particularly dangerous and the doctor was irresponsible in prescribing it, which is a smear without evidence. [https://t.co/CPxfu6oVZK] [April 16, 2020] Catholic Bishop Robert Barron saw the clip and took to social media to comment on it, calling the segment the ‚Äòone of the most disturbing and frankly dangerous things I‚Äôve ever seen in a political conversation.‚Äô Bishop Barron pointed out that Jefferson is the one who penned the concept of our inalienable rights coming from God while adding the obvious: rights that come from the government can be taken away. Hence, why this flawed government theory is fertile ground for totalitarianism. He noted that this isn‚Äôt a religious nationalism but ‚Äúone of the sanest principles of our democratic governance.‚Äù Friends, I wanted to share some reflections with you concerning a recent clip I saw from‚Äî Bishop Robert Barron (@BishopBarron) [@MSNBC], which was one of the most disturbing and frankly dangerous things I‚Äôve ever seen in a political conversation. [@HeidiReports] [@politico] [pic.twitter.com/3KO9LY4eXh] [February 23, 2024] Our rights come from God; the government exists to secure them, not produce them. Ms. Przybyla doesn‚Äôt seem to get it yet, either. Thank you.‚Äî Heidi Przybyla üå∫ (@HeidiReports) While there are different wings of Christian Nationalism, they are bound by their belief that our rights come from God. If you are Hindu, Jewish etc, this might help you understand the next part of my point, which is they are using this for a man-made policy agenda. [https://t.co/7FoVJh1UTx] [February 23, 2024]",

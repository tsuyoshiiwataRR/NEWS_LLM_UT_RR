    "text": "Attacks on churches in the United States have reportedly gone up by a staggering 800% in less than six years. Christianity is under assault here in America, but all Democrats do is screech about the fake crisis of “Christian nationalism.”\nA Family Research Council (FRC) report published this month analyzed data from 2018 through 2023. From arson to bomb threats to vandalism to gun incidents, churches have seen a worrying rise in active hostility. This appears to have escalated particularly since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, with the Supreme Court recognizing that there is no federal right to abortion.\n“In 2023, Family Research Council identified 436 incidents—more than double the number identified in 2022 and more than eight times the number identified in 2018,” the report announced. “These findings suggest that hostility against U.S. churches is not only on the rise but also accelerating.” And yet Democrats appear to be fueling the crisis by constantly vilifying Christians.\nFRC documented each of the attacks on churches in its report. Pro-abortion radicals have attacked many since Roe was overturned, even though the federal government is currently prosecuting peaceful pro-lifers instead of the many violent pro-abortion activists. Transgender radicals also committed a few of the attacks. A motive was not listed for many other attacks, including vandalism and arson.\nDoors, musical instruments, Bibles, electronics, windows, and Catholic religious statues were among the items and building parts damaged or destroyed. Tragic shootings and stabbings left individuals connected with churches dead or injured. Whole church buildings, or parts of them, were set on fire. Where is the mass outcry — from either Democrat or Republican politicians? Where is the White House task force to investigate anti-Christian hate? Where are the media reports on the epidemic of church attacks? Christians can be persecuted and attacked in America, and it seems most of the mainstream media and government could not care less. Some in media and government are actively encouraging hatred of Christians.\nFor instance, in December, The Atlantic hysterically announced that “The Only Thing More Dangerous Than Authoritarianism” is “Christian nationalism... now ascendant both inside the Church and inside the Republican Party.” Because, as we know, Christians have a regular habit of attacking mosques or shooting leftist protestors while screaming, “Jesus is great!”\nMeanwhile, The Hollywood Reporter propagandized recently about a film smearing Christians, “‘God & Country' Review: A Bracing, Rob Reiner-Produced Primer on the Dangers of Christian Nationalism.” Salon wants you to think Donald Trump is an evil, crazy dictator because he believes in religion being part of a politician’s decision-making: “Apocalypse now: Donald Trump dons the ‘armor of God’ — and pushes for theocracy.”\nNor is this insanity new; in July 2022, TIME sobbed , “Faith Is Powerful. That’s Why Christian Nationalism Is So Dangerous.” And back in 2021, TIME was scaremongering about “The Growing Anti-Democratic Threat of Christian Nationalism in the U.S.” Conservative Christians are constantly painted as violent, authoritarian traitors who hate democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. Are we surprised that some vandals and criminals take the media at their word?\nAs attacks on churches and Christians continue to escalate, the leftists who are encouraging hatred against these same Christians have a great deal to answer for. When Jesus separates the sheep from the goats, there will be a lot of donkeys in the latter party.",

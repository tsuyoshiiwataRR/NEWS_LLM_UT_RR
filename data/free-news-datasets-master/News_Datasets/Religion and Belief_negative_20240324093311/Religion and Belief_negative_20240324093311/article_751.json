    "text": "Joe Biden and Democrats support abortions up to birth. They have voted to allow infanticide. And Biden is aggressively targeting Christian churches and putting pro-life Americans in prison for peacefully protesting abortion.\nAnd that leads Donald Trump to ask the obvious question.\nHow can Christians vote for Joe Biden or Democrats?\nTrump said Thursday during a speech at the National Religious broadcasters convention that it’s “crazy” to vote for Democrats given all that and more.\n“How any Christian can vote for a Democrat, Christian or person of faith, how you can vote for a Democrat is crazy. It’s crazy,” Trump told attendees.\nHe contrasted Biden’s record of advancing abortions up to birth with his own record of appointing conservatives justices who overturned Roe and allowed states to protect babies from abortion.\nSUPPORT LIFENEWS! If you want to help fight abortion, please donate to LifeNews.com !\nTrump told the crowd that Biden is an “incompetent president who doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing” and “will not lead us to the promise land.” He said Biden was part of the “radical left” who are “coming after” those who are religious.\n“The chains are already tightening around all of us if you think about it. Ultimately, the radical left is coming after all of us, because they know that our allegiance is not to them.” Trump said. “Our allegiance is to our country and our allegiance is to our creator. They don’t want to hear that.”\n“But no one will be touching the cross of Christ under the Trump administration, I swear to you,” he said.",

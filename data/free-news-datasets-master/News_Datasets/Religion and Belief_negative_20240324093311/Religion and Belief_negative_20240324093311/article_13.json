    "text": "Rome Newsroom, Feb 22, 2024 / 16:10 pm Christopher Saunders, the bishop emeritus of Broome, Australia, has been arrested and charged with rape and other charges based at least in part on the findings of a Vatican investigation into allegations he abused vulnerable young men. Authorities announced Thursday that they were charging the 74-year-old prelate with two counts of rape, 14 counts of unlawful and indecent assault, and three counts of indecently dealing with a child as a person in authority, which reportedly occurred in the towns of Broome, Kununurra, and the Aboriginal community of Kalumburu between 2008 and 2014. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation [reported](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-02-22/former-broome-bishop-saunders-to-deny-19-criminal-charges/103496282) that Saunders will plead not guilty to the charges brought against him. Saunders was released on bail on a AU$10,000 ($6,500) bond on Thursday and has been ordered by the Broome Magistrates Court to reside at this home until the initial hearing in June. In a [press release](https://www.catholic.au/s/article/Matter-regarding-Bishop-Christopher-Saunders) published on Thursday, Archbishop Timothy Costelloe, president of the Australian Catholic Bishops’ Conference, said the allegations made against Saunders “are very serious and deeply distressing, especially for those making those allegations.”",

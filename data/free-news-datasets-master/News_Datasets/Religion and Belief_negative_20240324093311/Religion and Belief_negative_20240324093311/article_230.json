    "text": "A Canadian judge has deemed the intentional running over of five members of a Muslim family in 2021 to “constitute terrorist activity.”\nCanadian Man Found Guilty of Running Over Muslim Family\nIn a landmark ruling, a Canadian judge has declared the intentional running over of a Muslim family in 2021 as an act of terrorist activity. Nathaniel Veltman, who was found guilty of first-degree murder for the tragic incident, faces 25 years in prison without the option of parole.\nRoots of Hate and Terrorism\nJudge Pomerance highlighted the hateful and racist motivations behind the attack, emphasizing the need to address the underlying prejudices and normalized fear of the other that fuel such acts of violence.\nImpact on the Victims’ Families\nThe relatives of the victims welcomed the ruling, acknowledging the terrorism designation as a recognition of the hate that led to the tragic loss of their loved ones. They also emphasized the need to confront and combat the underlying prejudices and fears that contribute to such acts of violence.",

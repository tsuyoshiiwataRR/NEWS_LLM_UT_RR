    "text": "[Long Island](/long-island) [Suffolk](/long-island/suffolk) Suffolk County Police on Thursday arrested an East Northport man on charges of trespassing and harassing members at a Melville mosque. Police said Jordan Endler entered the Islamic Center of Melville, at 118 East Old Neck Rd, on Wednesday at 2:36 p.m. and made statements regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict. Endler was asked to leave by members of the mosque after refusing to remove his shoes and walking on carpets in prayer rooms, mosque president Talaat Abdelmoneim said on Thursday. Police were called and Endler left the location after officers arrived, police said. Endler, 46, was arrested at his Norton Drive home at 7:53 p.m. after an investigation by Hate Crimes Unit detectives, police said in a news release. He was charged with third-degree criminal trespass and second-degree harassment. He is being held at the Third Precinct and is scheduled to be arraigned at First District Court in Central Islip on Friday. On Friday, Abdelmoneim said he and his members are appreciative of law enforcement officials who listened to their concerns. “They showed their support and not tolerance to the disruptive or hostile behavior anywhere in any community which is our same position,” he said. “We feel much safer and part of the community.” Abdelmoneim said initially mosque members felt law enforcement officials were slow to respond to their concerns, but after meeting with them Thursday afternoon they felt better. “We had a very constructive meeting where we expressed our concerns about safety and such disruptive behavior and making people feel unsafe,” he said. “Our concern was about the safety and police said they will do whatever needs to be done.” Abdelmoneim said law enforcement officials said they would increase police presence around the mosque during Sunday school, Friday prayers and around Ramadan. Suffolk police did not immediately respond to questions about who attended the meeting with mosque members and what was discussed. Updated 23 minutes ago Arrest in mosque incident ...

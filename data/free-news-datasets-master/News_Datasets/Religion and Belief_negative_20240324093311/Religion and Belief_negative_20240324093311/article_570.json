Blinken warns State staffers to avoid words like 'father'\n“They’re weaponizing law enforcement to target parents, conservatives, and Catholics,” Trump noted, citing the (since-rescinded) Department of Justice memo\ntargeting concerned parents of public school children in 2021 and the memo from the FBI’s Richmond, Virginia, office urging investigations into “ radical-traditional Catholic hate groups,” citing the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n“Catholics, they’re being persecuted. Catholics,” he repeated. “But evangelicals, they’re all on the list.”\nAdvertisement - story continues below\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

Last month, a Nashville grand jury found them guilty of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act and conspiracy against rights.\n“These are\npersecuted Christians. They are being persecuted by Joe Biden and his people,” the former president said.\nTrump promised to defend Christian symbols and to launch a task force to combat “anti-Christian bias.”\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n“No one will be touching the cross of Christ under the Trump administration, I swear to you,” he said. “I will never allow the Big Media or left-wing pressure groups to silence you.”\n“Remember, every communist regime throughout history has tried to stomp out the churches just as every fascist regime has tried to co-opt them,” he said, claiming that the Left today is using both strategies.\nTrump also repeated his claim that his opponents target him because they’re trying to get at the American people.\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n“They’re not after me; they’re after you, and I just happen to be standing in the way,” he said.\n“They try to shame Christians; they try to shame us,” Trump said. “I’m a very proud Christian, actually.”\n“I’m being indicted for you,” he added.\nThen the former president joked about facing more criminal charges than great criminals of the past.\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n“I’ve been indicted more than Al Capone, the great gangster,” he said. “I’ve been indicted more than some of the greatest criminals in history.”\nHe joked that every time “my plane flies over a blue state,” he receives a summons to go to court.\nYet “with me, I get indicted and my\nAdvertisement - story continues below\nTrump warned that Christians “can’t afford to sit on the sidelines in this fight. The corrupt persecution by this regime will not stop with me.”\n“Ultimately, the radical Left is coming after all of us because our allegiance is not to them,” he said. “Our allegiance is to our creator, they don’t want to hear that. … We do not answer to bureaucrats in Washington, we answer to God in heaven.”\n“How any Christian or person of faith could vote for a Democrat is crazy,” Trump added.\nHe said the greatest threat to America comes from within, and he said America cannot prevail without God’s help.\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n“To achieve victory in this fight, just like the victories of the past, we still need the hand of our Lord and the grace of almighty God,” the former president said.\n<a href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/02/23/trump-condemns-persecution-christians-under-biden-doj-pledges-feds-will-never-target-them/\">Editor's note: This story originally was published by\n[The Daily Signal</a>.] SUPPORT TRUTHFUL JOURNALISM.

    "text": "AIUDF MLA Hafiz Rafiqul Islam\nGuwahati: AIUDF MLA Hafiz Rafiqul Islam on Saturday said Himanta Biswa Sarma-led Assam government doesn’t have the courage to bring the Uniform Civil Code in the state on the lines of Uttarakhand. Reacting to the government’s decision to repeal the Assam Muslim Marriages and Divorces Registration Act, he said the move appears to be taken to target Muslims.\n“This government doesn’t have the courage to bring UCC. They can’t do it. What they brought in Uttarakhand, is not UCC either…They were trying to bring UCC to Assam too. But I think they can’t bring it to Assam because there are people from several castes and communities here…BJP followers themselves follow those practices here,” he told ANI.\nHe said the BJP government is employing these tactics because the elections are approaching.\n“Elections are approaching, this is just their tactics to target Muslims. So, they couldn’t bring any Bill on polygamy or UCC in Assam…So, they are repealing the Assam Muslim Marriages & Divorces Registration Act. The Assam cabinet doesn’t have the right to repeal or amend a constitutional right,” he added.\nThe Assam cabinet on Friday gave the nod to repeal the British Raj-era law.\n“This Act contained provisions allowing marriage registration even if the bride and groom had not reached the legal ages of 18 and 21 respectively, as required by law. This move marks another significant step towards prohibiting child marriages in Assam,” the chief minister posted on X.\nThe law gives authority to Muslim registrars to register voluntary declaration of marriages and divorces.\nAfter this law is repealed, the district authorities will take over the custody of the registration records held by 94 Muslim marriage registrars.\nRegistration of marriages and divorces is not mandatory as per the Act and the machinery of registration is informal, leaving a lot of scope for non-compliance with extant norms, the government said, PTI reported.\nThe Uttarakhand government earlier this month got the UCC bill passed in the state assembly. The bill seeks to replace personal religious laws governing marriage, divorces and inheritance, with a common set of rules applicable to all religions equally. Several Muslim bodies, however, pointed out that tribals were exempted from the ambit of the legislation.\nHimanta Biswa Sarma has vowed that Assam will be the third state after Uttarakhand and Gujarat to implement the Uniform Civil Code. In January, he said it would take two-three months to table the bill. He also said that he plans to keep tribals out of the purview of the planned law.\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com",

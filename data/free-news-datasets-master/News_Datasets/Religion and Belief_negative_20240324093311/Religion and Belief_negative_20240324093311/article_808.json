    "text": "News Link •\n[Soros News](/Subjects/00588-LAST-soros-news.htm)\n• https://www.zerohedge.com, by Tyler Durden\n<a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/el-salvadors-bukele-blasts-soros-cpac\">El Salvador's Bukele Slams Soros At CPAC\n</a>\nIn a fiery address at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Bukele - who won re-election by a staggering 84% of the vote, said of Globalism: \"It's already dead,\" adding that in America \"dark forces are taking over your country.\"\nHe said that the reason El Salvador ended up becoming the \"murder capital of the world\" was that the people were not equipped to understand just how radically their society was changing because it happened over a period of decades, one increment at a time.\nBukele likened this to boiling a frog, saying that if you keep turning up the heat and slowly boil the frog, it won't realize what is happening until it is too late. The Latin American president urged Americans not to despair, however, as \"you can still jump before the water boils.\" -\nLifesite\nBukele later explained that in El Salvador, a 12-year-long communist-inspired civil war broke out, and that he can \"clear see the signs of a declining\" country when he looks at America.\n\"They were setting the gang members free,\" he said of his home country, adding that in order to clean up El Salvador he had to remove \"corrupt judges, corrupt attorneys and corrupt prosecutors.\"\nHe singled out Baltimore, where \"crime and drugs have become the daily norm,\" and asked the crowd if they could have imagined the fentanyl epidemic 10 year ago.\nShots at Soros\nBukele then too aim at globalist billionaire George Soros, who has funded a nationwide campaign to install soft-on-crime District Attorneys in major US cities.\n\"Who elected [George] Soros to dictate public policy and laws? Why does he feel entitled to impose his agenda?\" he said. \"Soros and his cronies hit a brick wall in El Salvador.\"\n\"Thank God and all glory be to Him, El Salvadorians are now immune to his influence,\" he continued.",

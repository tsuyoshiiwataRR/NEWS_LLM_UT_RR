    "text": "Hate crime detectives are investigating an outburst that was caught on camera Wednesday afternoon at the Islamic Center of Melville. A man walked into a building, which is used for religious services, demanding that the Israeli hostages be released by Hamas. Numerous requests were made by those in the mosque for him to leave, but the video went on for over a minute. Mosque officials say when police officers showed up, they spoke with the man and then let him go. Leaders of the mosque say they don't believe police took the situation seriously enough at first. \"Why was he not locked up? If he did this in any other religion other than Muslims, would it be going like this?,\" said Islamic Center of Melville President Talaat Abdelmoneim. \"That's really the concern. People already felt this way, they felt maybe it's a different way of treating it here.\" There is no word on if any arrests have been made in the incident. Mosque officials say they now believe the matter is being taken seriously as high-ranking Suffolk police officials visited the mosque on Thursday. Those at the mosque say the man has a right to protest, but that he did not have the right to act aggressively inside the mosque.",

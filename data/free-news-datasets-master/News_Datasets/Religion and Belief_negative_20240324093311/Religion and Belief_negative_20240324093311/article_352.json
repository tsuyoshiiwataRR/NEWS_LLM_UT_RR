    "text": "'A huge wave of antisemitism': Jewish scholars keep Ohioans educated about Israeli history [Zach Tuggle](https://www.mansfieldnewsjournal.com/staff/4395274002/zach-tuggle/) [Discrimination against Jewish people](/story/news/nation/2024/02/13/american-jews-behavior-identity-safety-israel-hamas-war/72577331007/) has continued to rise in recent months, sometimes in communities where it would seem almost impossible for the prejudice to exist. Ohio is not immune to pockets of antisemitic beliefs, a pair of scholars from Israel warned during a recent meeting with Dr. Carlos Campo, president of Ashland University and Ashland Theological Seminary. Sarah Levy and Dr. Yossi Kugler visited the AU campus from Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem. Their trip to Ohio was designed to raise awareness on [modern threats of antisemitism](/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/01/08/israel-assassinate-hamas-oct-7/72107707007/), offer reminders about the Holocaust and provide a greater understanding of the history of Jewish people. Campo hopes the partnership between AU and Yad Vashem continues. 'A huge wave of antisemitism' Jews have found themselves the target of assault many times throughout history. The world conjured some of its most intense Jewish hate in 1967 as Israelis rallied [during the Six Day War](https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/six-day-war) to defend their young nation against aggressions from Egypt, Syria and Jordan, which were backed in part by the Soviet Union. Contempt rose again globally in 1973 after Israel fought off a two-front attack from Egypt and Syria that came on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year − [that conflict was named the Yom Kippur War](https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/yom-kippur-war). The latest ambush was Oct. 7 when [a Hamas attack left 1,200 Israelis dead](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-attack-oct-7-israel-militants-concert-866ac59803d23dfc03146c8d272670cc) and another 240 taken into Gaza as hostages. \"The massacre of Oct. 7 was accompanied by a huge wave of antisemitism that the world has not seen maybe since the Holocaust,\" Kugler explained. The Jerusalem native said the past few months have made some Jewish people wonder if Zionism has failed. \"The vision of Zionism was that finally when the Jews have a land of their own, maybe antisemitism would stop,\" Kugler said. \"This is an ongoing discussion in Israel.\" 'We need to stop this' An important lesson the scholars hope Ohioans remember is that antisemitism eventually can extend to people of all religions and ethnicities. \"What starts with the Jews never finishes with the Jews,\" Levy said. \"Usually, the Jews are the first ones.\" The granddaughter of Holocaust survivors [referenced the famous Rev. Martin Niemöller quote](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/martin-niemoeller-first-they-came-for-the-socialists): \"First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out − because I was not a socialist. ... Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out − because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me − and there was no one left to speak for me.\" People worldwide today need to speak up in support of one another. \"We've learned that the hard way,\" Levy said. She and other scholars at the World Holocaust Remembrance Center still aren't sure what [the October attack](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-israel-unaccounted-people-095f64d06108416ff9c58ea7550b9a74) \"means for Israel, for the Jewish people, and for humanity as a whole.\" \"As impossibly traumatizing as the 7th of October was for me, the 8th of October was a harder − much harder − day for me, seeing the world reaction to what our country suffered,\" Levy said. \"We need to stop this − this hating, this other-ing − for all people, all around the world.\" 'Live side-by-side together and teach each other' Antisemites today are trying to downplay the significance of the Holocaust, even sometimes saying it never happened. The scholars say the best safeguard against those lies is simple: \"Educate, educate, educate.\" Even in states like Ohio, where large populations of Jewish people live in Cleveland and Columbus, everyone should beware antisemitism can sneak in and take hold. \"In Germany on the outskirt of the Second World War, less than 1% of the German population was Jewish,\" Levy said. \"Yet they managed − this party managed − to create a hatred against those people.\" She explained most Germans in the 1930s had never met a Jewish person, which made them susceptible to the NAZI party's propaganda. \"I'm hoping that in the states that do have large Jewish populations, that this knowledge of who these people are, to see them as regular people, I would hope that would reduce levels of antisemitism,\" Levy said. \"That's our dream, that different people can live side-by-side together and teach each other about different cultures.\" ztuggle@gannett.com 419-564-3508",

    "text": "Kenyan Pastor Harrison Ng'ang'a Denies Government Sponsored Benny Hinn's Crusade: \"We're Privileged\" - In 2023, Benny Hinn announced that First Lady Rachel Ruto had invited him to a crusade with everything sponsored by the government - However, local preachers, led by pastor Harrison Ng'ang'a, while anointing the venue for the crusade, changed the message and maintained the church was responsible for the event - His statement divided Kenyans as some reminded him of what the American televangelist said while others asked whom they shall trust to speak the truth Kenyan preacher Harrison Ng'ang'a has denied claims that the government has sponsored televangelist Benny Hinn's Kenyan crusade. The American preacher is expected to host his crusade on February 24 and 25 at Nyayo Stadium, with more than 50,000 people expected to attend the event. Who is sponsoring Benny Hinn's Kenyan crusade His visit to Kenya started when he took to social media to announce that First Lady [Rachel Ruto](https://www.tuko.co.ke/tags/rachel-ruto/) [travelled to the US to invite him](https://www.tuko.co.ke/kenya/521769-rachel-ruto-invites-popular-preacher-benny-hinn-nationwide-govt-sponsored-crusade/) to host a crusade. PAY ATTENTION: [Stay informed and follow us on Google News!](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAiEPP2kdduXXNp-3pbIY7sm6cqFAgKIhDz9pHXbl1zaft6WyGO7Jun?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) While cleansing the stadium, Kenyan preachers emphasised that the local churches were the main organisers of the crusade. Pastor Harrison also reminded Kenyans that Hinn had last visited the country two decades ago, and his return was a privilege. He said: \"He is an American evangelist, teacher and author of best selling books. He has impacted the world for more than five decades with the life saving and miracle working messages of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He returns to Kenya after being here two decades ago and we the churches of Kenya are privileged to host him. The steering committee is working with key stakeholders to host over 60,000 Kenyans. This event has been organised, funded and coordinated by the churches of Kenya which include both main stream churches and evangelical churches in Kenya.\" Watch the video below: Here are some of the [comments](https://www.tuko.co.ke/361693-150-comments-boys-pic-instagram.html) from social media users: @julietsteve639 said: \"Benni Himself announced that the First Lady went to his country and asked him to come to Kenya. He continued to say that the government hosts him.\" @Mary Kamau said: \"I don't know why I feel worried about this crusade.\" @janewambui783 said: \"Are Kenyan pastors not enough to pray for Kenya? Must we import even preaching.\" @clemons said: \"Do we believe you or Benny Hinn?\" @Simpson said: \"But Benny Hinn announced it himself. First Lady went to request him to come. Sasa hawa wanasema nini.\" @Adallaxxz said: \"Do you want to say that there is no anointed man of God here in Kenya who can conduct prayers. Kenyans don't be deceived.\" @muthoni said: \"Let's see how he is going to impact Kenya other than using Kenyan taxpayers' money.\" Pastor Ezekiel says he'll attend crusade Elsewhere, New Life Prayer Centre and Church leader [Pastor Ezekiel](https://www.tuko.co.ke/tags/pastor-ezekiel/) Odero has confirmed that he will be [attending the anticipated mega crusade](https://www.tuko.co.ke/entertainment/celebrities/538767-pastor-ezekiel-confirms-ll-attend-benny-hinns-mage-crusade-tells-kenyans-respect-ministers/) by Hinn. The Kilifi-based preacher, while talking to some members of his church, asked Kenyans to respect ministers of God who have since been considered pioneers. Ezekiel also urged members of his church to ensure that they attend the crusade that is scheduled to be held this weekend. Source: TUKO.co.ke",

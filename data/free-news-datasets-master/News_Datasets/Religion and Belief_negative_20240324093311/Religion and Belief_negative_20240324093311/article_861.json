    "text": "- Herbert Miller, 63, a reverend at Woodbury United Methodist Church, has been charged with dealing methamphetamine out of his church rectory. - However, the reverend fled the court on Friday and now local police are seeking to re-arrest him. <!– <!– <!– <!– <!– <!– <!– A Connecticut church pastor accused of dealing methamphetamine out of his church rectory fled court Thursday and local police are seeking his re-arrest. Herbert Miller, 63, a reverend at Woodbury United Methodist Church, was arrested earlier this month after being detained by state police in Woodbury. The reverend attended Waterbury Superior Court court Friday morning for his arraignment, but left the courthouse around 10 a.m. during a break. When Miller could not be located, the prosecutor again issued an arrest warrant. Miller was stopped by state troopers who observed that he was operating his vehicle with a suspended registration. He was found in possession of crystal methamphetamine, both in rock and liquid form, the latter of which was discovered in a hypodermic needle, ready to be injected. A Connecticut church pastor accused of dealing methamphetamine out of his church rectory fled court Thursday and local police are seeking his re-arrest. Herbert Miller, 63, a reverend at Woodbury United Methodist Church, attended court at Waterbury Superior Court, but left the courthouse around 10 a.m. during a recess. The Rev. Herbert Miller, 63, was arrested last week for possession of rock and liquid methamphetamine, as well as several other charges. Miller may have been selling methamphetamine in exchange for watching gay couples have sex, the New York Post reported. The allegation was reported by local media, although neither the Post nor the Daily Mail have been able to independently verify the claim. Police were reportedly alerted to Miller’s alleged illegal business and detained him with the help of a cooperating witness who helped facilitate a drug deal. Miller, who appears to have joined the Woodbury church as a pastor in July of last year, was charged with possession of narcotics with intent to sell, possession of a controlled substance and use of drug paraphernalia. He was released on $10,000 bail and ordered to appear before a judge in Waterbury Superior Court on Feb. 23. Miller is now expected to return to court on Monday, pending the status of his new arrest. Miller has been removed by his employer from the church’s website (his employment status is not yet clear), but several of his previously live-streamed sermons remain on the congregation’s YouTube page. In recent sermons, he appears to be missing some of his bottom teeth. Miller has been removed by his employer from the church’s website, but several of his previously live-streamed sermons remain on the congregation’s YouTube page. Miller has been pastor of Woodbury United Methodist Church since last July. From 2004 to 2018, he worked at Park Slope United Methodist Church in Brooklyn, where he participated in community social justice projects. Prior to his tenure at Woodbury Methodist, Miller served as pastor of the First United Methodist Church in Shelton, Connecticut. From 2004 to 2018, he was employed by Park Slope United Methodist Church in Brooklyn, where, according to the church’s website, he led the congregation’s popular Sunday dinner program. He also oversaw the church’s support of the Occupy Wall Street movement as it developed in 2011.",

    "text": "Kanye West’s Influence Cited in Columbia University Antisemitism Lawsuit Filed by Students\nBy: Nolan Strong Category: News February 22, 2024 Jewish students at Columbia and Barnard College are suing for antisemitism, detailing discrimination, including an incident involving Kanye.\nShare AllHipHop | Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) More Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) A legal storm is brewing at two of its most prestigious educational institutions, Columbia University and Barnard College, where groups of Jewish students claim they are being subjected to racism.\nA lawsuit filed by Students Against Antisemitism, Inc., alongside Jewish and Israeli students and the StandWithUs Center for Legal Justice, alleges a pattern of antisemitism on campus, challenging the institutions’ commitment to inclusivity and safety for all students.\nThe suit alleges that these institutions have systematically allowed a hostile environment of antisemitism to proliferate on their campuses, severely impacting the well-being and academic experience of Jewish and Israeli students.\nThe complaint delineates a series of troubling events and practices at Columbia University and Barnard College that illustrate the severity of the antisemitic climate.\nRap star Kanye West was blamed for helping to create a dangerous climate on the campus. In one incident, students openly discussed the antisemitic conspiracy theories Kanye West has spewed and circulated an image of a s in a campus dining hall.\nAdditionally, the lawsuit recounts an episode where a student encountered three student-athletes using the phrase “Jew someone down” as a derogatory term, further illustrating the casual antisemitism that permeates the campus environment.\nThe lawsuit claims faculty and students have openly praised the violent actions of Hamas , referring to them as “astounding” and “awesome,” in a clear display of support for acts of violence and terrorism.\nFurthermore, the campuses have witnessed marches where hundreds of pro-Hamas students and faculty chanted deeply antisemitic slogans, calling for violence against Jews and promoting genocide.\nThese actions have not only been allowed to occur but have gone largely unaddressed by the university administration, contributing to an atmosphere of fear and exclusion for Jewish and Israeli students.\nThe lawsuit accuses the institutions of not enforcing their policies against discrimination, failing to condemn acts of antisemitism effectively, and neglecting to take disciplinary action against those who engage in such behavior.\nThis, according to the complaint, has allowed a culture of antisemitism to thrive, significantly hindering Jewish and Israeli students’ ability to participate fully in campus life.\nThe students are seeking a range of remedies from Columbia University and Barnard College, including the implementation of comprehensive measures to combat antisemitism on campus, disciplinary action against those who perpetuate antisemitic acts, and the development of educational programs aimed at raising awareness about antisemitism.\nAdditionally, the lawsuit calls for the universities to ensure the safety and inclusion of Jewish and Israeli students by enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and to provide compensation for the harm caused by the hostile environment.\nShare AllHipHop | Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) More Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\nPosted in News Tagged Hip-Hop News , Kanye West , YE",

    "text": "- Leighton Bester from Salford says spooky encounters happen daily in his home - The incidents began after he found a coin in his neighbours thudding cupboard A man claims objects in his flat have started moving around the house of their own accord after he brought home an historic coin. Leighton Bester, from Salford, shared a clip on TikTok of one of his chairs dramatically skidding across his room, seemingly without any human help, in what he claims is a sign of ‘paranormal activity’. The 34-year-old claims this is one of many spooky activities to have taken place in his flat since he found a 1965 Winston Churchill coin in his neighbour’s cupboard and brought it home with him. As the clip continues, Leighton’s blinds appear to rotate sharply, again with no apparent human interference, and he says he’s bringing in a priest to solve the problem. He says in the clip: ‘I’m leaving…that’s the last straw now guys. I’m going to have to f g move out tonight.’ Leighton Bester (pictured) regularly captures bone-chilling ‘paranormal’ happenings in his home and he claims it all began because of coin Leighton claims the ‘entity’ has been causing havoc multiple times a day – at every hour – for the last week. The 34-year-old added the unusual incidents started when he found a 1965 Winston Churchill coin in his neighbours’ locked kitchen cupboard. ‘I noticed strange things happening a week ago. The first incident was loud banging coming from a kitchen cupboard,’ he said. The strange encounters began instantaneously after he returned to his flat with the coin. Admitting he felt ‘more vulnerable’ when the light were off in the beginning, Leighton has grown accustomed to the spooky incidents. ‘I’m not sure how and why this started. I think it has something to do with the coin I found and that it must be cursed or something,’ he said ‘When it first started it was scary but now it’s more annoying than anything else. It’s like having a mischievous flatmate.’ He added: ‘I’m not part of the paranormal community and don’t really believe in ghosts but I can’t explain what’s going on. ‘Things can’t just move by themselves. I think it’s some sort of ‘energy’ that’s attached itself to me.’ But the mysterious ‘entity’ isn’t your typical Casper the ghost, as the 34-year-old claims chairs slamming against the floor, blinds sharply moving and the television switching on-and-off occurs at every hour of the day He believes the spooky encounters were sparked by a 1965 Winston Churchill coin he found in his neighbours thudding kitchen cupboard After leaving TikTok users completely shocked by ‘authentic’ and ‘raw’ footage, Leighton revealed many had urged him to contact a priest or a medium. He said: ‘I’ve not physically seen anything.. People are saying it’s a ghost or poltergeist and even maybe a demon. ‘Thousands of people from the paranormal community have commented on my videos saying that a priest or a medium could help but it could also make things much worse.’ Hitting back at doubters, Leighton alleged that the even experts, who attempted to debunk his videos, have failed. ‘Doubters are becoming believers. Paranormal experts and digital editing experts around the world have tried debunking my videos, ‘But they can’t be debunked as its raw footage recorded from my phone while it’s in my hands, and the activity is right in front of peoples eyes to see.’ The online paranormal community have urged him to seek help from a medium or priest, however Leighton shared that he is more annoyed than scared by his unwelcomed flatmate Even though his family and friends are worried, Leighton is more irritated by constantly having to close his blinds. ‘I’m sick of getting up to close my blinds after they open, and having the lights and the TV turn off,’ he said ‘I’m starting to get used to it now but some things still spook me out sometimes. I don’t know what potential new things could start happening so I’m always on guard. ‘There is nothing I can really do except put up with it until I’ve figured out how to stop it all.’ *** [Read more at DailyMail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-13117303/Flickering-lights-slamming-chairs-daily-cursed-coin.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490)",

    "text": "South Africa’s chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has rejected concerns that he could be endangering people’s health by linking coronavirus vaccines to a “satanic agenda”.\nThe senior judge said people should be spared any vaccine that sought to “advance a satanic agenda of the mark of the beast”.\nBYPASS THE CENSORS\nSign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox.\nYou can unsubscribe any time.

I cry unto God to stop it.”\nMogoeng added: “I don’t think the vaccine must ever be compulsory … You can’t impose a vaccine on people. Why should you?”\nThe Sunday Times Daily news site quoted Barry Schoub, a virology professor at Wits University and head of a ministerial advisory committee on Covid-19, as saying: “It is unfortunate that someone of that stature is misleading people because vaccines are such a major part of controlling this epidemic and it is unfortunate that someone with such influence is opposing efforts to control it.”\nBut Mogoeng said he would not be silenced: “I don’t care about the consequences. We’ve been quiet for far too long, toeing the line.”\nNiamh Harris The People's Voice\nLatest posts by Niamh Harris (\nsee all)\n-\nSerbian President Says World Leaders Are No Longer Working Towards Peace- February 21, 2024\n-\nNancy Pelosi & Jen Psaki Believe Putin Is Blackmailing Donald Trump- February 21, 2024\n-\nUS Embalmer Speaks Out About ‘Strange White Fibrous Clots’ Found In Dead Bodies- February 20, 2024",

    "text": "Former President Donald Trump charged the incumbent administration of targeting Christians Thursday night with a speech at the National Religious Broadcasters International Christian Media Convention. “Remember, every communist regime throughout history has tried to stamp out churches, just like every fascist regime has tried to co-opt them and control them. And in America, the radical left is trying to do both,” Trump [said](https://apnews.com/article/trump-2024-campaign-religious-broadcasters-convention-7f73f4b27451b514ae7d22093b20d40d) in Nashville. “They want to tear down crosses where they can, and cover them up with social justice flags.” President Joe Biden, himself, is the [second](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/03/30/most-democrats-and-republicans-know-biden-is-catholic-but-they-differ-sharply-about-how-religious-he-is/#:~:text=Joe%20Biden%20is%20just%20the,about%20Biden%27s%20religion%20end%20there.) Catholic to hold the Oval Office. The far-left administration, however, has pioneered avenues of religious persecution against political opponents, primarily through the Department of Justice (DOJ). 1. Investigating Catholics as Terrorists The FBI, under the Biden administration, infiltrated traditional Catholic parishes to investigate “white supremacy.” In January last year, a leaked memo from the Bureau’s offices in Richmond, Virginia revealed the federal intelligence agency [targeted](https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/09/fbi-retracts-memo-labeling-traditional-catholics-violent-white-supremacists-pushing-infiltration-of-christian-communities/) “Radical-Traditionalist Catholics” as “Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists” (RMVE). The FBI [rescinded the memo](https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/09/fbi-retracts-memo-labeling-traditional-catholics-violent-white-supremacists-pushing-infiltration-of-christian-communities/) once public discovery made headlines. But a new memo in August obtained by House Republicans shows the FBI’s surveillance of Catholics involved [multiple](https://thefederalist.com/2023/08/09/unredacted-fbi-memo-contradicts-christopher-wrays-claim-only-a-single-field-office-targeted-traditional-catholics/) field offices across the country. “The document assesses with ‘high confidence’ the FBI can mitigate the threat of Radical-Traditionalist Catholics by recruiting sources within the Catholic Church,” [reported](https://www.uncoverdc.com/2023/02/08/the-fbi-doubles-down-on-christians-and-white-supremacy-in-2023/) former special agent-turned-whistleblower Kyle Seraphin. The FBI [rescinded the memo](https://thefederalist.com/2023/02/09/fbi-retracts-memo-labeling-traditional-catholics-violent-white-supremacists-pushing-infiltration-of-christian-communities/) once public discovery made headlines. But a new memo in August obtained by House Republicans shows the FBI’s surveillance of Catholics included [multiple](https://thefederalist.com/2023/08/09/unredacted-fbi-memo-contradicts-christopher-wrays-claim-only-a-single-field-office-targeted-traditional-catholics/) field offices across the country. 2. Pro-Lifers Prosecuted for Prayer The Department of Justice indicted 22 pro-life activists in 2022 while neglecting to go after pro-abortion extremists who firebombed pregnancy centers, [according](https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/19/the-fbi-has-indicted-22-pro-life-protesters-and-zero-pregnancy-center-firebombers/) to a Federalist review. Among them include Paul Vaughn, one of a handful who was [convicted](https://thefederalist.com/2024/01/30/dad-of-11-convicted-for-praying-at-abortion-facility-alongside-5-other-pro-lifers-targeted-by-doj/) for the crime of praying at an abortion facility in Tennessee. If his appeal fails, Vaughn, a father of 11, faces 11 years in prison and fines of [up to](https://www.thomasmoresociety.org/news/thomas-more-society-defending-latest-fbi-pro-life-victim-hymn-singing-father-of-eleven-2) $260,000. The DOJ [claims](https://thefederalist.com/2022/10/06/if-peacefully-protesting-abortion-is-criminal-but-firebombing-pregnancy-centers-is-not-there-is-no-rule-of-law/) the pro-life activists “aided and abetted by one another, used force and physical obstruction to injure, intimidate and interfere with employees of the clinic and a patient who was seeking reproductive health services” when they spent most of their time praying. 3. Biden DHS ‘Dirty Tricks’ Operation Attacked Christians An internal memo published in May last year revealed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) used federal funds to launch a smear campaign against dissident groups, including Christian organizations. Dan Schneider, the vice president of the Media Research Center’s Free Speech America, [repo](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/documents-reveal-dhs-dirty-tricks-operation-attacked-christians-conservatives-tied-them-nazis) [r](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/documents-reveal-dhs-dirty-tricks-operation-attacked-christians-conservatives-tied-them-nazis) [ted](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/documents-reveal-dhs-dirty-tricks-operation-attacked-christians-conservatives-tied-them-nazis) on the DHS operations in Fox News. According to the memo, the DHS funneled “$40 million taxpayer dollars away from bona fide anti-terrorism programs and into a weaponized operation deceptively known as the Targeted Violence & Terrorism Prevention Grant Program (TVTP).” Groups investigated under the federal program include the Christian Broadcasting Network, founded by Pat Robertson in 1960. 4. Repeal of ‘Conscience’ Rule In 2019, Trump issued the “conscience” rule to protect health care workers from administering treatments violating practitioners’ moral convictions on procedures such as abortion. Politico [reported](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/19/biden-trump-conscience-rule-00026082#:~:text=The%20Biden%20administration%20is%20preparing,with%20the%20deliberations%20told%20POLITICO.) in the spring of 2022 that Biden was preparing to dismantle the Republican-era regulation. The final rule [came](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4397912-biden-administration-rescinds-much-of-trump-conscience-rule-for-health-workers/#:~:text=The%20Trump%20administration's%202019%20rule,Union%20and%20Planned%20Parenthood%20%E2%80%94%20sued.) last month rescinding protections. “Some doctors, nurses, and hospitals, for example, object for religious or moral reasons to providing or referring for abortions or assisted suicide, among other procedures. Respecting such objections honors liberty and human dignity,” said the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). But, the agency added, “patients also have rights and health needs, sometimes urgent ones. The Department will continue to respect the balance Congress struck, work to ensure individuals understand their conscience rights, and enforce the law.” 5. Biden Admin Targets Largest Christian University Last year, the Department of Education levied a nearly [$38 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardconroy/2023/11/06/grand-canyon-university-fined-377-million-by-department-of-education/) fine against Grand Canyon University, claiming the school engaged in deceptive advertising campaigns. The department said the school “lied to more than 7,500 former and current students about the cost of its doctoral programs over several years.” The university [appealed](https://news.gcu.edu/gcu-news/grand-canyon-university-appeals-unprecedented-decision-record-fine-from-u-s-department-of-education/) the record fine in November. “I have spoken to thousands of students, parents, employees, alumni and community stakeholders in Arizona and they all tell me the same thing: We need to fight this tyranny from federal government agencies not only to stand up for ourselves but to ensure this type of ideological government overreach and weaponization of federal agencies does not happen to others,” Grand Canyon University President Brian Mueller said in a [statement](https://news.gcu.edu/gcu-news/grand-canyon-university-appeals-unprecedented-decision-record-fine-from-u-s-department-of-education/). “American people are losing confidence in the federal government to be fair and objective in their operations and there are clearly no checks and balances to prevent this type of behavior from the Department of Education, which is out of control and continues to broaden its authority and selective enforcement powers.” Mueller [told](https://thefederalist.com/2023/10/05/christian-university-blasts-obviously-political-harassment-from-education-department/) The Federalist one month prior that the federal government’s efforts to target the university were “obviously political.”",

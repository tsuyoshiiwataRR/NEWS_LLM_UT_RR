    "text": "The Copyright Battle – Garry’s Mod Removes Nintendo Add-Ons The popular physics sandbox game Garry’s Mod faced copyright takedown requests from Nintendo The popular physics sandbox game Garry’s Mod recently made headlines as it removed all Nintendo-related add-ons from its platform. This action comes as a response to copyright takedown requests from the gaming giant. Garry’s Mod’s developers addressed the situation in a recent announcement on Steam:\n“May have noticed that certain Nintendo-related workshop items have recently been taken down – this is not a mistake.”\nThe developers acknowledged Nintendo’s rights over its content, stating, “What they allow and don’t allow is up to them. They don’t want you playing with that stuff in Garry’s Mod – that’s their decision, and we have to respect that and take down as much as we can. This is an ongoing process, as we have 20 years of uploads to go through.”\nGarry’s Mod faced skepticism and later confirmed the validity of the takedown requests Some Garry’s Mod users initially believed that the copyright takedown requests were not truly from Nintendo but rather from a copyright troll. In response to these doubts, Garry’s Mod creator Garry Newman took the time to investigate further.\nGarry Newman, on his official Twitter account, confirmed the authenticity of the takedown requests and stated, “I have been assured that these takedown requests are legitimate.”\nThe confirmation from the game’s creator seemingly puts the skepticism to rest, affirming that the requests did indeed come from Nintendo.\nThe significant impact on Garry’s Mod and Nintendo-related content The takedown requests necessitate the removal of a vast array of Nintendo-related maps and other items from Garry’s Mod. Throughout the years, players have been able to create content within Garry’s Mod that includes turning games like Super Mario 64 into first-person shooter experiences or exploring Hyrule as Link.\nAs the amount of Nintendo-related content is substantial, Garry’s Mod developers are requesting assistance from the community to proactively remove any user-created content that potentially infringes on Nintendo’s rights.\nThe Verge reached out to Nintendo for comment on this matter, but has yet to receive a response.",

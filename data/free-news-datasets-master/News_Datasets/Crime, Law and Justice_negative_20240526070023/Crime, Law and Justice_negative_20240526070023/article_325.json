    "text": "The security situation in Haiti is considered volatile. There has been high levels of violent crime due to\nongoing internal conflict. While Haiti has been in a dire situation for quite some time, the press has reported the most recent attacks. Technically, Haiti has been a dangerous destination since well before 2021, according to the U.S. Department of State. The department of state has rated the Caribbean country as a level four destination. This travel advisory rating means that travelers should not travel to the destination. Learn more about the situation in Haiti, violent protests and Haiti flights.\nThe Conflict in Haiti\nThe ongoing situation in Haiti has been labeled as a security crisis on many levels. From a political and humanitarian standpoint, there are many serious concerns for the safety of the Haitian people and travelers that attempt to visit. The whole world is bearing witness to the violence in the capital which has stemmed from political unrest.\nThe current crisis is over Haiti’s ability to govern itself. After natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies, gangs have led protests against the current governmental powers. After the assassination of the democratically elected President Jovenel Moïse (in 2021) Ariel Henry became prime minister of Haiti.\nThis decision occurred due to the involvement of several nations and a transitional government. But Haitians have made clear that Haitian-led solutions are needed. In the absence of an election since Henry gained power, protests increased. Recently, Henry announced that elections would be postponed once again, to 2025. The country has not held an election in eight years. Militia have overtaken the capital in the wake of a disheveled government.\nFollowing Haiti’s unfortunate history of enduring tribulations, many humanitarians have made a call for the end of the violence and solution to the unrest in Haiti. But the issues of the country are complex and continue on. And now, heavily armed gangs have taken control of around 80% of Haiti’s capital.\nThe gang violence in Haiti’s capital has led to a declaration of a state of emergency. In only the first three months of 2024 more than 1,550 people have been killed. While the United Nations has attempted to provide things like food assistance in the country, the violence in the country compromises its ports.\nHaiti Violence & Flights\nHaiti’s uncertain future and the alarming levels of violence have caused changes in international relations. Since the country is located only 7000 miles from Miami, this threat means that the United States has made efforts to protect its citizens. Seemingly as a result of planned militia attacks on the Haiti airport, Americans were provided with an opportunity to escape Haiti. A charter flight to Miami was organized to evacuate United States citizens. Some airlines have even cancelled flights to Port-au-Prince. There have been deportation flights to Haiti, which is clearly a controversial move with the current crisis. These deportations have been considered death sentences to many Haitians as the gang violence surges. The state department has also suspended regular visa service to Haiti, so Haitians are facing increased refusal rates and less flights are occurring between the two nations.",

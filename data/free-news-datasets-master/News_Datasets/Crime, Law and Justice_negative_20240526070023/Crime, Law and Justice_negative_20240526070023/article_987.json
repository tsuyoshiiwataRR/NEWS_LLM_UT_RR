    "text": "Emurua Dikir MP Johanna Ng’eno is under siege in the wake of allegations of corruption and incompetence during his reign as the Chairperson of the powerful Housing and Urban Planning Committee in the National Assembly.\nNg’eno, a critic of President William Ruto before he joined the ruling United Democratic Alliance (UDA) political outfit in the run-up to the 2022 elections, has been serving in the powerful Housing Committee until this week when members voted him out over allegations of corruption.\nThe members are said to have openly expressed reservations about the lawmaker’s conduct.\nThe committee members further accused the MP of sidelining them in key matters, warning this would be detrimental to the housing program which is key to the Kenya Kwanza administration.\nThe committee members held a six-hour meeting with National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula to discuss Ng’eno’s conduct.\nHe was accused of running the committee as a “private entity”.\nDespite the challenges, Ng’eno has been instrumental in the implementation of the Affordable Housing Law at the National Assembly. He becomes the first chair of the committee to be ejected from his position in the 13th Parliament.\nThe housing project is among President William Ruto’s key priorities.\nThe Head of State has consistently stressed that the project will not only improve the standards of living of Kenyans who will live with dignity, but also create employment opportunities for thousands of citizens, especially the youth.\nThe housing program was initially successfully stopped by the courts following a petition by Busia Senator Okiya Omtatah before the National Assembly drafted a law to support and implement it.\nDespite his challenges in the National Assembly, Ng’eno was recently installed as Kipsigis elder and spokesperson of the community. He vowed to use the position to push for the interests of the locals.\nThe position was previously held by former Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto.\nAlso read: Comedian Terence Creative opens up about mental health struggles\nCaretaker on the spot over stolen Sh600,000 rent",

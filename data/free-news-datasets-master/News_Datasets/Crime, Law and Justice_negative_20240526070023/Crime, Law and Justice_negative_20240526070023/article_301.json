    "text": "St Catherine photographer charged in 2021 wounding incident ST CATHERINE, Jamaicaâ€” A photographer who reportedly shot and injured two men in a 2021 incident was charged on Wednesday when he turned himself in to the police. Darian Clarke, a resident of Kendal Road in Waterford, St Catherine, was charged with wounding with intent, shooting with intent, illegal possession of firearm, and illegal possession of ammunition. It is reported that on Monday, June 21, 2021 about 10:30pm, three men were on their way from a party and while walking along Biscayne Road in the parish, they saw Clarke. The men believed that Clarke was acting suspiciously so they observed him for a moment before attempting to pass. However Clarke went into some bushes and hid himself, the report said. According to the report, Clarke was a stranger in the community, and the men feared for their lives so they approached where Clarke had gone to hide. Clarke allegedly pulled a gun and opened fire in the direction of the men hitting two, while the other escaped unhurt. The men made a complaint to the Portmore police and Clarke reportedly went on the run, alluding the cops for almost three years. On Wednesday, April 24, Clarke turned himself in to the police with his attorney. He was officially charged after a question and answer session. A court date is being finalised.",

    "text": "Aoife Johnston\nA VERDICT OF medical misadventure has been returned at the inquest into the death of teenager Aoife Johnston at University Hospital Limerick in 2022.\nThe verdict is unopposed by the HSE and UL Hospitals Group.\nAoife died of bacterial meningitis, after a 12-hour wait in the hospital’s emergency department, on 19 December 2022, which was overcrowded at the time.\nShe had initially presented to the hospital on 17 December, and was eventually admitted to intensive care, but passed away shortly after.\nThe inquest which has taken place this past week has been another period in which the family of Aoife Johnston have experienced great distress, and this has been publicly visible to all of us.\nIn a statement this afternoon, HSE CEO Bernard Gloster said he wanted to “restate for the record our unequivocal apology, conscious that no words” will take away the pain of Aoife’s family and friends.\nGloster thanked the Coroner for “his careful attention to this tragic case” and remarked that over the past four days, “we have heard great detail on the events surrounding this unnecessary death”.\nGloster added: “I know we have considerable work to do to ensure that the people of the Mid West, and the staff of University Hospital Limerick, have a service they can feel confident in and proud of, and we are working to that end.\n“The details of this inquest will be very much in our minds as we do so.”\nMinister for Health Stephen Donnelly offered his condolences to Aoife’s parents and sisters in a statement this afternoon.\n“I met with Aoife’s parents in January and my thoughts are with them after what must have been an immensely difficult week,” Donnelly said.\nHe thanked the Coroner for his work, “but I am aware that nothing will ever make up for the enormous loss the Johnston family has experienced”.\nHe said the Coroner’s recommendations will be fully considered, along with the work of retired Chief Justice Frank Clarke who is due to conclude his independent investigation in the coming weeks.\nMeanwhile, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said urgent government action is required to “address the health crisis in Limerick and the Mid West”.\nShe also called on the government to immediately review the re-opening of emergency departments in Ennis and Nenagh.\n“Aoife Johnston’s death was an avoidable tragedy,” said the Sinn Féin leader.\n“Aoife and her family’s experience at University Hospital Limerick was one of acute trauma. They have had to relive that trauma this week, and no doubt relive it every day.”\nMcDonald added: “It is clear that Aoife’s death was a result of catastrophic system failure which resulted in an emergency department that was overcrowded, understaffed, and completely unsafe.\n“Aoife’s case speaks in the most heartbreaking way to the depths of the crisis at University Hospital Limerick.\n“The chaos in the emergency department that Aoife and her family faced that weekend is what faces patients and staff all the time.”\nShe added that the recruitment embargo in University Hospital Limerick “needs to be lifted and 288 beds need to be delivered”.",

    "title": "SC Imposes Rs 5 Lakh Fine On Centre Over 'Frivolous' Special Leave Petition",
    "text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday fined the Centre Rs 5 Lakh for its appeal against a Meghalaya High Court ruling, calling it a \"blatant misuse\" of legal process. Terming the special leave petition as \"frivolous,\" the apex court bench comprising Justices Vikram Nath and Satish Chandra Sharma said that there was no valid reason for the Union of India to challenge the order through SLP.\nThe bench declined to intervene with the challenged judgments and orders of the High Court, opting to dismiss the Special Leave Petition with costs.\n&apos;Frivolous&apos; says SC\n\"The present petition is sheer abuse of the process of law. The petitioners are cautioned not to file such frivolous petitions in future,\" the bench noted in its ruling.\nIt said that during the proceedings in the High Court, the petitioner&apos;s counsel (UoI) acknowledged that the case was analogous to a previous decision, leading to the High Court&apos;s resolution based on the petitioner&apos;s counsel&apos;s statement.\n\"We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned judgment(s) and order(s) of the High Court. Accordingly, the Special Leave Petition is dismissed with costs for the reason that before the High Court counsel for the petitioner (UoI) submitted that the matter was squarely covered by a previous decision and, accordingly, the High Court had disposed of the matter on the statement of the counsel for Union of India,\" the bench said.\nHearing related to a CAT judgement\nThe top court was hearing an appeal against the High Court order which upheld a Central Administrative Tribunal judgement.\n\"We, accordingly, impose a fine of Rs.5,00,000 to be paid by the petitioners which shall be deposited in the Account of the Armed Forces Battle Casualties Welfare Fund, Canara Bank, Branch South Block, Defence Headquarters, within eight weeks.\"\n\"After depositing the said amount in the aforesaid fund, the petitioners are to file proof of such deposit with the Registry of this Court within a week thereafter,\" the bench said.",

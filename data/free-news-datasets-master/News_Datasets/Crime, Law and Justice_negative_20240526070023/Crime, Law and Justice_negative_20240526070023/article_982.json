    "text": "New Delhi: The Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday made the first arrest in connection with the 2023 case relating to the violent attack on the Indian High Commission in London. The arrested accused has been identified as Inderpal Singh Gaba. He was arrested in Delhi.\nGaba is a resident of Hounslow in the United Kingdom. he was reportedly arrested for carrying out unlawful activities during the protests that took place on March 22.\nDetails of NIA Investigations in The Attack At the Indian High Commission in UK:\nLast year in June, the NIA released pictures of the accused involved in the attack. The NIA probe revealed that one of the masterminds of the attack was Avatar Singh Khanda, sources told Times Now.\nNIA's Tweet:\n\\n REQUEST FOR IDENTIFICATION/INFORMATION\nOn 19.03.23 these persons were involved in an attack on the High Commission of India, London. They caused grievous injury and disrespected the Indian National Flag\nIf anyone has any information about them, please Whatsapp/DM @+917290009373 pic.twitter.com/Rhy93cFJjA\nâ€” NIA India (@NIA_India) \\n June 14, 2023 \\n\nA few months after the attack Khanda died under mysterious circumstances there. It was suspected that he died of poisoning, the sources claimed.\nThe NIA probe revealed that the attack was organised by Gurcharan Singh, Dal Khalsa of the UK; Avtar Singh Khanda of KLF, Jasvir Singh and many of their associates, both Indian and foreign nationals, who have been identified during the ongoing investigations.\nIn 2010, Khanda reportedly moved to the UK and soon joined the radical diaspora there. Even before March 2023, Khanda used to openly participate in protests outside the Indian High Commission in the UK.\nKhanda was working closely with those spearheading the secessionist campaign 'Referendum 2020' of the banned organisation 'Sikhs For Justice'. He was also openly instigating and promoting pro-Khalistani activites in the UK\nInvestigations further revealed that the attack outside Indian High Commission in London was the result of government action against Khalistani sympathiser and Waris Punjab De chief Amritpal Singh. and other separatist elements.\nAmritpal Singh is presently lodged in Dibrugarh Jail.\nKhanda was one of the mentors of Amritapal Singh and was funding him all along. He had also helped Amritpal in evading arrest from police for over one month.\nAfter the arrest of Amritpal, Khanda had formed a committee of foreign-based Khalistani elements to run the affairs of Waris Punjab De.\nInvestigations further revealed that Khanda lured illegal immigrants in the UK to join Khalistani outfits in lieu of 'sponsorship' for political asylum.\nHe also actively participated during the 'Referendum 2020 voting' in the UK in 2021-22. Khanda and others were also running a Khalistani TV Channel KTV in the UK.\nLast August, the NIA carried out searches at 31 locations in Punjab and Haryana to unearth a larger conspiracy behind the attack outside the Indian High Commission.\nThe NIA is leaving no stone unturned to pinpoint culpability in the London attack and arrest the perpetrators, their associates and their supporters, based in India and abroad. It has been carrying out extensive investigations into the incident with a view to ensuring there is no repeat of such breach of security, disrespect to the Indian National Flag or any threat to Indian interests abroad\". NIA had then said in a statement.\nthe NIA probe had revealed that the High Commission of India in London was attacked in March by a group of about 50 persons, who committed criminal trespass, caused disrespect to the Indian National flag damage to public property and injuries to officials of the High Commission of India.\nAn Investigation team of the NIA had visited the UK in May 2023 to probe the attack. As per sources, a crowdsourcing of information was also carried out to identify and collect information about UK-based entities and individuals involved in the incident, based on which the agency identified many of the attackers .",

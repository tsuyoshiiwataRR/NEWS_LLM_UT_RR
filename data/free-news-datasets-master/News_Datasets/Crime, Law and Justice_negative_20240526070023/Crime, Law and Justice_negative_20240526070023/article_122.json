    "text": "The 67-year-old Sandia resident had access to the NCJLS bank accounts to pay authorized NCJLS expenses in her role as secretary, and admitted taking money from the accounts for four years. She faces up to 20 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine on top of full restitution to the group. She is currently out on bond and is scheduled to be sentenced July 23. The NCJLS is the Coastal Bend's largest junior livestock show. The most recent show took place in January. The show provides elementary, middle and high school students the opportunity to \"promote responsibility and leadership skills through the educational work of 4-H Clubs, FCCLA and FFA Chapters in cooperation with the adult leaders of Nueces County in all phases of agriculture, homemaking and industry,\" according to the organization's website. It also helps students sell their livestock and awards scholarship money.

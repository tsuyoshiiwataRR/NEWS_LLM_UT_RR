    "text": "Jordan Wheeler was trying to leave her and her estranged husband’s Clinton Township house with her two young sons last fall when Steven Wheeler shot her multiple times in the head.\nA six-minute recording of Jordan Wheeler’s 911 call was played in a courtroom Thursday at the preliminary examination for Steven Wheeler, 30, who is charged with first-degree murder and felony firearm possession for fatally shooting Jordan Wheeler near the front door in the home with the boys nearby.\n“He put his hands on me. I have it on video,” she tells Macomb County Sheriff’s dispatcher Taryn Grady. “I’m trying to get my kids stuff so I can get out of here. I’m trying to get my kids out of here. I also believe he has been drinking.”\nAsked by Grady to describe what happened minutes before, Jordan says, “He grabbed me and tried to push me out of the home,” she tells the dispatcher.\nSteven Wheeler can be heard in the background denying it, and Jordan says, “It’s on video.” That video on her phone was shown in court.\nThe dispatcher then asks whether “he has guns.”\n“Yes, he has guns” that are “somewhere in the house, probably in the bedroom,” Jordan replies.\nThe dispatcher moments later asks, “How many children are in the home?”\nBut Jordan doesn’t answer and five seconds later four or five gunshots are heard on the recording.\nGrady repeatedly asks, “What is going on?”\nSteven Wheeler twice yells from afar, “I shot her in the f—— head,” and then says, “I’m done. I put her out.”\nMinutes later Wheeler was arrested by Clinton Township police officers in front of the house on Woodward Street near 15 Mile Road and Groesbeck Highway.\nJordan Wheeler’s phone was found outside, brought there by the defendant, according to testimony.\nSteven Wheeler was bound over to Macomb Circuit Court on first-degree murder and felony firearm possession following the hearing in front of Judge Steven Sierawski in 41A District Court in Sterling Heights although the case is under 41B District Court jurisdiction. The three judges at the Clinton Township court recused themselves because Jordan Wheeler is the sister of Kelly Femmineo, the wife of 41B Judge Jacob Femminineo. The case was reassigned to the Sterling Heights court.\nBrett Vanderpool, Jordan Wheeler’s brother, said after the hearing the family approves of the ruling.\n“First-degree (murder) is absolutely correct,” he said. “It’s all we have on our mind right now. We won’t settle for anything else.\n“He’s a monster. He’s an evil human being. He needs to face what he’s done.”\nVanderpool praised his 10-year-old nephew, Colton Wheeler, for taking the stand.\n“Colton was as brave as they come,” he said. “He stood right in the face of the monster that took away the most precious thing of his life and told the story, the truth, of his mother.”\nBut the family wished Colton didn’t have to testify, Vanderpool added.\n“I think all of our hearts break seeing his child on the stand,” he said. “A child shouldn’t have to experience that.”\nThe hearing was attended by the Femminineos and several other family members.\nThe judge’s ruling followed arguments at which Assistant Macomb Prosecutor Kelsey Heath said first-degree murder should stick because Wheeler had time for a “second look” to reconsider his decision to shoot his wife as she was about to exit the front door.\n“He walked up right behind her and shot her five times,” Heath said. “He fired till there was no bullets. She was on the phone to leave.”\nSierawski denied a request by Wheeler’s attorney, Noel Erinjeri, to reduce the charge to second-degree murder despite contending.\n“There was no second look,” Erinjeri said. “He is in an argument.”\nErinjeri said if his client had time to think about it, he wouldn’t have shot Jordan while she was still on the phone with law enforcement.\nTwo of the couple’s three children were at the home that night, last Oct. 19, as part of Steven Wheeler’s parenting time with them after the couple had separated and were in the midst of divorce proceedings in Macomb Circuit Court. Jordan Wheeler and her children were living with Kelly and Jacob Femminineo.\nColton testified he and his brother called their mother at about 9:30 p.m. because their dad threw a tablet computer at one of them in anger. Steven Wheeler also had knocked a hole in a wall in a hallway in the home.\n“Like a good mom, she goes right over there,” Heath said during her arguments.\nWhile their mom was on the 911 call, the two boys ran from the home carrying things, one a few seconds after the other, less than 30 seconds before the shooting, according to ring camera video shown in court. One of boys was still on the porch when the shots from the .45-caliber handgun were fired, and gun flashes can be seen in the video.\nJordan Wheeler’s body was found against the living room couch with a pool of blood under her, police officers testified. She was wearing a T-shirt, jacket, pajama pants and slippers, they said.\nOne officer testified he saw two wounds, one to her face, under her left eye, and the other on the left side of her head.\nAt the township police station, Wheeler admitted to killing his wife in two interviews about five and 15 hours after the incident, according to township Detective Jay Anderson.\nWheeler agreed to waive his Miranda right to an attorney at the first interview though Anderson said he appeared intoxicated. Anderson said Wheeler told him his intoxication did not affect his memory after the incident.\nAbout 10 hours later, Wheeler gave his Miranda consent though his blood-alcohol level showed a slight intoxication level at 0.032%. Wheeler again made admissions and changed his prior statement that he was cleaning the gun when Jordan arrived. He admitted he retrieved it from the bedroom, and Anderson said he found the gun case on the floor and a empty slot on a shelf in the closet that could’ve been the gun’s storage spot.\nWheeler is scheduled for a May 13 arraignment by Judge Julie Gatti in Macomb County Circuit Court in Mount Clemens.\nHe remains held it he county jail without bond.",

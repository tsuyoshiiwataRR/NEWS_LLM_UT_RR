    "text": "BARRE, Vt. (WCAX) - A Windsor County sheriff’s deputy who caused a mistrial in Barre back in March has lost his job. Cpl. Mark Belisle provided security at the Washington County court in February during the sexual assault trial of Kasey Giorgio, who was found guilty. But in March, the judge ruled Belisle made inappropriate comments to a juror, which tainted the trial’s outcome. A mistrial was declared and Belisle was placed on administrative leave. Related Story: Barre City police investigated the deputy’s actions, and Windsor County Sheriff Ryan Palmer says Belisle is no longer with the department. “I just want to emphasize how important this agency views the sanctity of jury deliberations and certainly as an organization, we failed in this scenario and we are doing the best to mitigate that in the future and take some corrective actions,” Palmer said. Washington County State’s Attorney Michelle Donnelly says her office plans to pursue the charges against Kasey Giorgio again. Copyright 2024 WCAX. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "A bill named for the two teenage victims in one of Oklahoma's most notorious cold cases was effectively killed Thursday by the Senate in a baffling turn of events for surviving family members and the bill's author. Known as Lauria and Ashley's Law, House Bill 2946, which the Senate declined to hear, would require anyone convicted of accessory to murder to serve at least 85% of their sentence before becoming eligible for parole. The law is named in memory of 16-year-olds Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman, who authorities believe were kidnapped outside of Welch in 1999, tortured, raped and killed. Sen. Greg McCortney, R-Ada, Senate floor leader, said the decision not to hear the bill was \"based on not going backward on criminal justice reform.\" \"While I wholeheartedly agree that the facts and circumstances surrounding the case in question are horrific and my heart goes out to the families involved, it is the job of the Senate to craft and pass sound public policy, while not undermining the will of Oklahomans,\" McCortney said in a statement. People are also reading… Lorene Bible, mother of Lauria Bible, said the news of the bill's fate was devastating to her family and that finding out at the \"last minute\" made it that much worse. \"For 24 years I felt like I'd done everything I could do for my child until (Wednesday) night,\" when she learned that the bill wouldn't be heard, said Bible, who traveled to the Capitol on Thursday to talk to senators. \"What does it take to open people's eyes? We filed this so this doesn't happen to another family. That's the whole reason we're doing it.\" The bill, filed last year by Rep. Steve Bashore, R-Miami, was crafted in response to the early release of the only person ever held responsible in the case. Ronnie Dean Busick, 72, was released in May 2023 from Lexington Correctional Center after serving only 2½ years of a 10-year sentence for accessory to murder. He's due to come off supervised probation next month. \"They keep telling me he has rights. Well, this man has more rights than I do,\" Bible said Thursday. Bashore said the message sent by the decision not to hear the bill is that \"victims' rights are not important.\" He said he was originally told the bill wouldn't be heard because there wasn't enough time. The bill passed the House on Feb. 21 by a vote of 85-13 and had also cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee. The proposed law would add accessory to murder in the first or second degree to a list of crimes that require an offender to serve at least 85% of their prison sentence before being parole eligible. Those convicted would not be eligible for any credits that would reduce the sentence to below 85% of what was imposed. Busick earned credits to reduce his sentence under state law, while also receiving credit for county jail time served while awaiting trial. McCortney, in his statement Thursday, added: \"The mission of the Department of Corrections in part is to rehabilitate and prepare individuals convicted of crimes to reenter society. The individual who pled guilty in this case was released based on earned credits from policy decisions at the Department of Corrections, not the Senate.\" \"Statistics have made it clear that Oklahoma previously led the nation and parts of the world in overincarceration. The demands for reform reached a fever pitch and the state legislature, our current governor, as well as voters, acted to make the conscious decision that we needed criminal justice reform, and we acted accordingly. This measure would run counter to that collective goal.\" The Bible family is vowing not to give up, however. \"We are fighters, if nothing else,\" said Lisa Bible Brodrick, a cousin of Lauria Bible's. \"We will go back to the drawing board and trust Rep. Bashore to guide us again next year with a better understanding of what we need to do differently.\" Busick, who pleaded guilty to the charge in August 2020, is the lone survivor from a trio believed to be behind the disappearance of the two 16-year-olds and the murders of Freeman's parents, Danny and Kathy Freeman, on Dec. 30, 1999, outside of Welch. Authorities believe that the girls were also murdered, and periodic searches for their bodies are still ongoing. The case was cold for years, but after a break in 2018, prosecutors charged Busick while also implicating the late Warren Phillip Welch II and David A. Pennington. Investigators believe that the trio went to the Freeman farm to confront Danny Freeman about a drug debt. After the murders of Freeman and his wife, the girls likely were kidnapped. Investigators believe they were taken to a trailer house in Picher, where they were tortured and sexually assaulted for two weeks before being killed. Busick's release came as a shock, Bible said at the time. She said the family was never informed that earlier release was a possibility and that they never would've supported the plea deal if they had known.",

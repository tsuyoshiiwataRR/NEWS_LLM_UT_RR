    "text": "A Farmington Hills man is facing multiple felony charges for an April 7 shooting in Pontiac that left a man paralyzed and a woman also injured.\nKarvyon Zorell Murphy, 19, is accused of firing several gunshots into an apartment on Fireside Lane in the North Hill Farms apartment complex. According to the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office, deputies responding to a call of shots fired found a 20-year-old man inside who had been shot in the neck and was lying on the floor. He reportedly told deputies that someone had fired a gun into the residence but he didn’t know who it was. A 19-year-old woman was also inside the apartment with a gunshot wound to the arm. A 43-year-old man was also in the apartment but wasn’t harmed.\nKarvyon Murphy booking photo The shooting stemmed from an altercation at the apartment days earlier, and investigators subsequently identified Murphy as the gunman, the sheriff’s office said. He was arrested on Seven Mile Road in Detroit on April 23 by the sheriff’s Fugitive Apprehension Team.\nMurphy was arraigned April 24 on three counts of assault with intent to murder, discharging a weapon in or at a building causing serious impairment, discharging a weapon in or at a building causing injury, fire counts of felony firearm, and domestic assault and battery. He’s held in the Oakland County Jail with bond set at $75,000 cash or surety.\nRelated Articles Crime and Public Safety |",

    "text": "Doerman getting taxpayer dollars for defense in murder trial BATAVIA, Ohio (WXIX) - A Clermont County father, accused of killing his three sons, is getting taxpayer money to pay for his defense. Court documents say Chad Doerman will be allowed to use some public money to defend himself in his upcoming trial. Recent filings show he has made two motions to appropriate funds, the most recent for a consulting forensic psychologist. The practice is common in Ohio courts. The Ohio Revised Code allows public funds to be used in someone’s defense in a capital case if the defendant is indigent or can’t afford to fund their defense. Doerman’s requests for funds are under seal, so the amount of money isn’t public record. His trial is scheduled to begin July 8.

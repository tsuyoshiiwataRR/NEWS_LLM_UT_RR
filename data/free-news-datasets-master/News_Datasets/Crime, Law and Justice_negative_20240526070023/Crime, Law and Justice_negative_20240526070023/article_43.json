    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (WSYX) â€” A father pleaded not guilty today to child abuse charges involving his seven children. Jason Fuller was in court to answer to a 13-count indictment. Fuller is charged with eight counts of child endangering and one count of intimidating an attorney, victim or witness. His wife, Kristelle Fuller, was arraigned Wednesday. She's accused of abusing her children by using a belt on them, locking them in a shed, feeding them dog food, physically restraining them and more. Prosecutors said the incidents allegedly occurred between October 2015 and February 2024. Court documents spelled out a pattern of abuse. Prosecutors also said punishments included extreme physical exercise, to the point where one child passed out, and that the Fullers instructed their kids to lie to authorities about the abuse in order to protect them. The couple was arrested at their home last week after after a complaint was filed with [Job and Family Services](https://jfs.ohio.gov/). Kristelle Fuller's [bail was set](https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/kristelle-dawn-fuller-delaware-county-mother-mom-shed-dog-food-7-kids-children-abuse-jason-columbus-ohio#) at $75,000 dollars, and Jason Fuller's bail was set at $200,000. Both are under a no-contact order for any witnesses, victims or each other. The couple will be back in court on Friday, May 31.",

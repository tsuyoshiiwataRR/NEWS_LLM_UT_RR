    "text": "NORTH ANDOVER — Bullets flew throughout an otherwise quiet neighborhood around 9:50 p.m. Wednesday, while some residents were told to hide in their basements and others decided upon their own methods of action to stay safe. What began as a mental-health crisis call escalated into a heavy response by North Andover police officers and members of a SWAT team who scoured the neighborhood and barricaded roads during an hours-long showdown at 416 Waverly Road. Sean DeAdder, who neighbors confirmed they heard police calling for, remained barricaded in his home until he took his own life early Thursday morning. “It was pretty intense. It was a few hours,” said Kelsey Allen of 478 Wood Lane, which abuts DeAdder’s backyard. “I heard mad bullets. It was so close.” The incident began around 9:50 p.m. Wednesday, when the North Andover Police Department received a call from 416 Waverly Road reporting a man was “experiencing a mental health episode inside of the home and was armed with a firearm,” according to police. Neighbors confirmed they heard a singular gun shot around that time as well. “We initially didn’t know what was going on,” said Chad Pick of 440 Waverly Road. “We didn’t know if somebody was running around the neighborhood.” Rick Scialdone of 441 Waverly Road thought the same. He said he called the police and they didn’t confirm what was happening. “We saw some people with a flashlight. We didn’t know what it could be,” Scialdone said. “I’m not huge on guns but I have two. … and I got them out because you never know.” Allen said at 9:50 p.m. five police officers banged on her door, telling her and the woman she lives with to take cover in their basement. North Andover officers responded to the scene and were fired at by DeAdder, police said. One officer was injured after the subject fired a round at a police cruiser. Metal shards struck the officer in the head. He was transported to Lawrence General Hospital, where he was treated and released, according to police. Responding officers then took cover as the Northeastern Massachusetts Law Enforcement Council SWAT team was dispatched. A shelter-in-place order was issued for residents in the immediate area. People took to Facebook and noted that they heard multiple shots, as well as announcements over a bullhorn. “I heard the negotiator and he said, ‘Sean, put the gun down,’” Allen said. “I kept hearing the negotiators saying, ‘We’ll get you the medication that you need.’” When the SWAT team arrived, DeAdder still refused to exit the home, and he continued to fire rounds from the front and rear windows of the house, according to police. The ordeal ended around 2:30 a.m. Thursday, neighbors confirmed. A police officer returned to Allen’s house to tell her everything was safe at 3 a.m. “It was real creepy,” Allen said. “It was so surreal.” Tarps now cover the front door of the house, a window in the front, and two larger windows in the back facing Allen’s property. The fence between the two houses now is missing a section where the SWAT team entered. But DeAdder’s house was already run down, so much so that neighbors said they didn’t believe anyone lived at 416 Waverly Road. Pick even said it “stuck out” among the other houses in the neighborhood. “I didn’t even know anyone lived there,” Allen said. “The house has always looked in disrepair. I thought it was just one of the houses nobody could buy out and they just abandoned.” Scialdone said the family put a dog on a leash in their yard that “runs out when people walk.” His wife has mace now for her walks in case something was to happen, he said.

    "text": "SALISBURY, N.C. (WBTV) – Some in Salisbury are living with new fear after a string of shootings in the past two weeks left two adults dead and a baby, a young girl, and two adults injured.\nThe most recent incident occurred Wednesday night at an apartment complex on South Main Street, where a baby and two women were shot.\nPREVIOUS: ‘We need justice’: 3 hurt, including baby, in Salisbury shooting\nEarlier that day, a young girl was shot near the intersection of Old Concord and Shaver Street.\nPREVIOUS: Police: Young woman found shot on side of road in Salisbury\nThese shootings come on the heels of two fatal shootings reported on the 13th and 14th.\nPREVIOUS: Man, woman killed in separate shootings in Salisbury, police say\nSalisbury Police Maj. TJ Crews condemned the violence and pleaded with the community for help.\n“There is no room for this violence in the City of Salisbury,” Crews said. “There are people in our community who know who committed all of these shootings; we need them to come forward and help us.”\nThe recent spike in crime has shaken the community. Kenny Hardin, a former Salisbury City Councilmember, expressed the fear residents are experiencing.\n“They’re afraid to go about their daily lives,” Hardin said. People are afraid to go to restaurants, run errands, and just do normal things that people do every day for fear of being caught by a stray bullet.”\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by WBTV News (@wbtv_news)\nHardin has been an active community member since the late 1990s ′s and says the crime spike is scary and terrible but not necessarily surprising.\n“A lot of the shooting that’s going on, it’s been done by middle school and high school kids,” Hardin said. “And we say there are not a lot of opportunities. There are opportunities here. But it needs to be more action on behalf of the churches, it needs to be more action on behalf of the city.”\nHardin runs non-profits “High Road Inc” and “Veteran’s Social Center.”\nHe works to help veterans and at-risk communities near Salisbury through those groups. He said the continuing violence and shooting comes, in part, from a lack of understanding.\n“Unfortunately, I think our city leaders don’t really understand the depth and the breadth of gang culture and gang life,” Hardin said. “A lot of this is happening in the poor and black and brown neighborhoods, and there’s not really a genuine concern until it explodes outside of the boundaries of these communities and then when it starts touching other areas.”\nHardin said that tackling crime in Salisbury is bigger than just responding to shootings as they happen. Instead, he says he believes it will take a group effort.\n“The onus is not just on the city,” he said. “It’s not just on the community. Everybody needs to work together. The police can’t be everywhere. So, the citizens need to step up, and the residents need to step up as well.”\nSalisbury Police are actively investigating all shootings and have increased patrols across the city. They have also requested assistance from state and federal agencies.\nCopyright 2024 WBTV. All rights reserved.",

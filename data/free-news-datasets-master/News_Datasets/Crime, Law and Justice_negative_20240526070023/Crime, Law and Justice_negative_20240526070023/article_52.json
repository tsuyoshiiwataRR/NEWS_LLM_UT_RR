    "text": "Barring a trade, the Tennessee Titans will make their first pick in the 2024 NFL draft on Thursday night when theyâ€™re on the clock at No. 7 overall.\nFor fans who have to be up early in the morning for work or whatever else, this is good news, as the Titansâ€™ selection will come fairly early in the evening. However, you may not want to go to sleep after that, as itâ€™s not out of the question that the Titans trade back into the first round, although that isnâ€™t likely to happen.\nBut exactly what time will the Titans make their first-round pick? Well, we can get a good idea by looking at when the No. 7 overall pick came down in previous years.\nOver the last five years, four of the No. 7 picks have come between 9:05 p.m. ET and 9:11 p.m. ET, with two of them coming at exactly 9:08 p.m. ET. Only one of the previous five came before 9 p.m. ET (2022: 8:55 p.m. ET).\nNow, a look at the exact times the 7th pick in the NFL draft has been made in each of the past five years.\n2019 â€“ 9:08 p.m. ET With the #7 overall pick in the 2019 @NFLDraft , the @Jaguars select LB @JoshAllen41_ ! #NFLDraft (by @Bose ) pic.twitter.com/6Y3yOUU6g9\nâ€” NFL (@NFL) April 26, 2019\n2020 â€“ 9:11 p.m. ET With the No. 7 overall pick in the 2020 #NFLDraft , the @Panthers select @AuburnFootball DT Derrick Brown!\n(by @Bose ) pic.twitter.com/i89PeqSlJK\nâ€” NFL (@NFL) April 24, 2020\n2021 â€“ 9:11 p.m. ET With the No. 7 overall pick in the 2021 @NFLDraft , the @Lions select OL Penei Sewell!\nðŸ“º: 2021 #NFLDraft on NFLN/ESPN/ABC pic.twitter.com/mCfS3tUgVW\nâ€” NFL (@NFL) April 30, 2021\n2022 â€“ 8:55 p.m. ET With the No. 7 overall pick in the 2022 @NFLDraft , the @Giants select Evan Neal! @NewEraCap | #TogetherBlue\nðŸ“º: 2022 #NFLDraft on NFLN/ESPN/ABC pic.twitter.com/vpt5m6IPWl\nâ€” NFL (@NFL) April 29, 2022\n2023 - 9:05 p.m. ET With the No. 7 overall pick in the 2023 @NFLDraft , the @Raiders select Tyree Wilson! @NewEraCap | #RaiderNation\nðŸ“º: 2023 #NFLDraft on NFLN/ESPN/ABC\nðŸ“±: Stream on NFL+ https://t.co/D3EqkrKdIw pic.twitter.com/qyhUdNk5mn\nâ€” NFL (@NFL) April 28, 2023\nRead all the best Titans coverage at The Tennessean and Titans Wire .",

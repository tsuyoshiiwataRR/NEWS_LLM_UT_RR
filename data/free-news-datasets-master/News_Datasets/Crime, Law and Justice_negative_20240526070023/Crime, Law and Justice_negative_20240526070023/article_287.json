    "text": "On Thursday, April 25, 2024, Parisa Salehi, a journalist, was arrested and sent to prison after being summoned to the 7th Branch of the Office of the Implementation of Verdicts, to serve five months of time in prison. Referring to the “extra judicial instances” in her case, such as the denial of the right to appeal, this journalist wrote in her user account: “The initial sentence of [one year of imprisonment](https://women.ncr-iran.org/2024/01/26/parisa-salehi/), two years of exile, two years of ban on leaving the country and two years of ban on membership in social networks in the Court of Appeal was commuted to five months in prison, but the rest of the cases are still there.” Parisa Salehi was summoned to the Karaj Prosecutor’s Office in a notification in September 2023, and shortly after, she was charged in the Karaj Prosecutor’s Office and finally released on bail. This journalist has a history of working in Donya-e Eghtesad newspaper and is a master’s student in economics at [Tehran University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tehran).",

April 24, 2024: Stalking, bail jumping, criminal trespass, violate a harassment restraining order Editor’s note: This weekly feature of Wausau Pilot & Review is being published in response to reader concerns about crime and safety in the Wausau area and to keep readers informed about their neighborhoods.\nWausau Pilot & Review does not publish photos of minors, except in extreme circumstances, determined on a case-by-case basis. Wisconsin treats 17-year-olds as adults in the criminal justice system. Misdemeanor charges are listed only if they are filed alongside a felony in a single case.\nIf felony charges are verified as dropped or reduced to a misdemeanor, photos will be removed upon request after emailing [email protected] and verification through the court system.\nAll photos are courtesy of the Marathon County Sheriff’s Department and are considered public record in the state of Wisconsin.\nSome photos were not available at the time of publication but can be requested from the Marathon County Sheriff’s Department.\nEmail [email protected] with questions or concerns.\nYou are advised that a charge is merely an accusation and that a defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

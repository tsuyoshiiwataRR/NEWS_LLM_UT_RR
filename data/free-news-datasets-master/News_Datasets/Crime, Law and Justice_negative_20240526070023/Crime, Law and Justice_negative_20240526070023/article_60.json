    "text": "Authorities are attempting to locate a man believed to have been shot earlier this week who is suspected in a burglary. An arrest warrant has been obtained for Jessie Ray Curtis, 36, on charges of first-degree burglary and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The Warren County Sheriff's Office said that Curtis is believed to have sustained a gunshot wound in his back Monday morning during an exchange of gunfire on Ella Way. Anyone with information about Curtis' whereabouts is asked to call 911 and report his location. A post on the WCSO Facebook page said that Curtis may be armed and should not be approached. The search for Murphy is tied to an investigation that began when deputies received a call about a crash on Murphy Road, with the caller reporting that one of the vehicles involved was attempting to leave the scene. As deputies responded, another call came reporting a shooting on Ella Way, and WCSO determined that the two calls were part of a related incident. After a disturbance and exchange of gunfire on Ella Way, more shots were exchanged as vehicles involved in the disturbance traveled along Murphy Road, the sheriff's office said. Witnesses to the crash on Murphy Road said several people took off running from the scene in different directions, and a black Buick Enclave was also seen leaving the scene and traveling toward Ky. 240, according to WCSO. Deputies later found the car abandoned in a barn along Vance Lane. Law enforcement canvassed the area and located Joshua Culbreath, 38, who was served with outstanding warrants and charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. An arrest citation for Culbreath alleged that he arrived at his Ella Way home on Monday morning as a burglary was ongoing and he went to the front door armed with a handgun. Witnesses reported that Culbreath got into a verbal confrontation with a man, gunshots were exchanged and Culbreath drove off in a black Buick SUV, while the \"unknown males\" that illegally entered the home fled in a black Chevrolet Avalanche. \"Witnesses stated Culbreath was firing shots from the Buick SUV and wrecked out the Avalanche,\" Culbreath's arrest citation said. Culbreath gave some statements to deputies about his involvement in the incident and then requested an attorney, court records show. Another Ella Way resident, Jess Fitzgerald, 33, was arrested on charges of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and trafficking in marijuana (less than eight ounces, firearm enhanced). Fitzgerald called 911 to report two people entered his residence armed and that someone had been shot, according to court records. Deputies found Fitzgerald outside his residence, where he complained of chest pains after learning he had warrants for his arrest, a citation said. Fitzgerald reported that one of the intruders began to handcuff him and that he was placed on his knees in the kitchen when an altercation began and shots were fired, Fitzgerald's arrest citation said. Deputies obtained a search warrant for Fitzgerald's residence and found three bags of suspected marijuana, several firearms, a sawed-off shotgun, two heavy-plated ballistic vests and parts to an AR-15, the citation said.",

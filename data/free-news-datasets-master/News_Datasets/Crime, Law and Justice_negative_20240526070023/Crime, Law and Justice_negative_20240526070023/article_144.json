    "text": "HARRIS COUNTY, Texas (KTRK) -- The Texas Attorney General's Office is stepping in to assist the Harris County District Attorney's Office and Texas Rangers in the investigation of allegations of tampering and misuse of official information within Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo's Office. The video above is from a previous story. On Thursday, in a release, Ken Paxton's office said it's helping look into the scandal that's centered around a now-canceled $11 million COVID-19 vaccine outreach contract awarded to Elevate Strategies, a one-woman firm with little experience. SEE ALSO: Texas Rangers launch new investigation into bid-rigging scandal within Judge Lina Hidalgo's Office According to Paxton's release, Hidalgo staffers waived typical financial fitness requirements and even shared details of the potential bid with Elevate Strategies weeks before the information was made public. In 2022, three Hidalgo staffers were indicted by a grand jury on bid-rigging charges. Since the news came to light, three of Hidalgo's former staffers, Wallis Nader, Aaron Dunn and Alex Triantaphyllis, were indicted on tampering and misuse of official information charges. \"Our prosecutors and investigators are the best in the State. They handle every case with utmost professionalism. In this case, as in all others, we will seek truth and justice,\" Paxton said. For more on this story, follow Mycah Hatfield on X and",

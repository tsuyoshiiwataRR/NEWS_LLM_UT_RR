    "text": "By Mac Bullock ,\n1 hour ago Michael Swanson; Nicole Swanson Photo Credit: Delaware County District Attorney's Office Michael and Nicole Swanson are charged with rape, involuntary deviate sexual assault, aggravated indecent sexual assault of a person with a mental disability, and related counts, according to court records and prosecutors.\nAuthorities said the victims, aged 27 and 30, were friends from a special education program at Chichester High School. The 27-year-old victim, who was then pregnant with Michael Swanson's child, introduced the 30-year-old victim to him, according to the DA's Office.\n\"The three of them entered into a sexual relationship,\" prosecutors said in the release.\nMichael Swanson convinced the 30-year-old victim to move in with him and Nicole Swanson to a house in Broomall, investigators said.\nIn February 2023, when the 27-year-old victim gave birth to Swanson's child, Riddle Hospital staff made a report to authorities \"due to (victim's) disability and due to Michael Swanson’s numerous previous cases with social services,\" officials said.\nMonths later in July, the Swansons and both victims moved to a trailer in Tallahassee, Florida, according to the release.\n\"A witness informed investigators that the reason Michael Swanson moved to Florida was that he was concerned about social services looking into his involvement with (victim) and her child,\" the DA's Office said.\nIn Florida, authorities said Nicole Swanson, a woman named Caitlyn Eusden, and Swanson's children recorded a video in which they beat the 30-year-old victim. The recording was sent to the victim's family, and they were \"able to locate (her) and remove her from the situation.\"\nIn an interview with investigators, the 30-year-old victim said she was \"sexually assaulted by Michael Swanson approximately two times per day,\" according to prosecutors. He also took away her cell phone, food card, checks, money, and insurance card,\" and made himself the beneficiary of her Social Security payouts, authorities said.\nMichael Swanson was extradited to Pennsylvania after the police interview, prosecutors said.\nThe 27-year-old victim also told investigators that Michael Swanson sexually abused her, recorded the abuse, and took away her cell phone, the DA's Office said. She and her child have since been removed from the home and are living with family in South Carolina, according to the release.\n“It is difficult to comprehend the truly heinous actions of these defendants. The defendants knowingly exploited two intellectually disabled young women. They used them for their sexual gratification, and stole their benefits,\" said DA Jack Stollsteimer.\n\"They attempted to hide their conduct by cutting off contact with the victims’ families, and went so far as to remove the women to Florida to evade detection.\"\n\"Defendant Michael Swanson impregnated one of the victims and brought a child into this vile situation – joining seven other children fathered by Swanson.\"\n\"The members of law enforcement, the medical professionals, and the social workers who have worked on this case stand united in calling out the depravity of these defendants’ actions,\" Stollsteimer said.\n\"They will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"\nMichael and Nicole Swanson are being held on $900,000 and $1 million bail respectively, court records show. Each has a hearing before Magisterial District Judge Andrew Goldberg scheduled for May 2.\nto follow Daily Voice Delaware and receive free news updates.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

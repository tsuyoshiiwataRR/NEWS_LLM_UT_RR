    "text": "BALTIMORE â€” A homeless man was left in a coma after being brutally beaten while eating outside a Northeast Baltimore fast food restaurant.\nNow the alleged perpetrator faces attempted murder charges, because the whole thing was caught on video.\nIt happened after midnight on April 17.\nCharging documents say the 40-year-old victim had just ordered food from the pickup window of Checkers on Moravia Road.\nAfter sitting down to eat, charging documents say the victim was approached by 34-year-old Deluntae Boyd.\nSurveillance shows Boyd looking through the victim's food bag, snatching it, and then walking away.\nThe victim reportedly yells something at Boyd, prompting him to turn back around.\nThis is when detectives say Boyd pushed the victim down, causing his head to hit the table.\nAccording to charging documents, Boyd then beat the victim into unconsciousness, punching him 10 times while stomping his head eight times.\nBy the time police arrived on scene, Boyd had fled. The victim was already taken to a hospital, and was unresponsive with a brain bleed.\nDetectives identified Boyd by his outfit the night of the attack.\nAn officer spotted him walking around the next day wearing the same exact clothing.\nWhen brought in for questioning, detectives showed Boyd surveillance photos of the wanted suspect, at which time he reportedly replied \"that looks like me, y'all must have a clone of me or something.\"\nOnline court records show Boyd with a criminal record including past convictions of assault (2014) and unauthorized use (2017). In both cases Boyd was given an 18 month suspended jail sentence. He was also convicted in Harford County in 2021 for telephone misuse, in which he was given one year of probation.\nBoyd is now being held without bail, and is next due in court on May 14.",

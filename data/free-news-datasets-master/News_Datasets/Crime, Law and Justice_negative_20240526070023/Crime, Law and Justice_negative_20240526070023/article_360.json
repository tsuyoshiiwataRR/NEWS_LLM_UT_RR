    "text": "The Navy nabbed nine persons, along with four dinghies, unauthorised nets and fishing gear, for engaging in illegal fishing activities, during a search operation conducted in the sea area off Chalei, Jaffna on Wednesday (24). The individuals involved were caught by the Navy, whilst they were engaging in fishing with unauthorised nets and participating in light-coarse fishing.\nThe Sri Lanka Navy remains vigilant and conducts operations to combat illegal fishing in its sea and coastal areas, with a view to supporting legal fishing activities.\nThe Naval Deployment Veththalakerni, operating within the Northern Naval Command, intercepted four suspicious dinghies in Chalei sea area on Wednesday (24). Following the search, Naval personnel nabbed nine persons on those dinghies, for their involvement in fishing with unauthorised nets and participating in light-coarse fishing. The operation also led to the seizure of four dinghies, unauthorised nets and fishing gear.\nThe suspects held in these operations were identified as residents of Point Pedro, Oddusudan, Pudukuduirippu, Mullaitivu and Negombo areas, who are from 16 to 56 years of age. The nine suspects along with the seized items were handed over to the Jaffnaâ€™s Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Department for legal proceedings.",

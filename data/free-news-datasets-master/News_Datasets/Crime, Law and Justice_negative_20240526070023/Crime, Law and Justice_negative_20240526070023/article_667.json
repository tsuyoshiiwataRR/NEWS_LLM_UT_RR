    "text": "By Wwj Newsroom ,\n1 hour ago\nCLINTON TWP. (WWJ) -- A Macomb County business owner has been charged with manslaughter in connection with a fire and explosions that rocked Clinton Township, killing one person.\nThe Macomb County Prosecutor's Office on Thursday announced its case against 31-year-old Noor Noel Kestou of Commerce Township, who operated Select Distributors, at 15 Mile Road and Groesbeck Hwy.\nProsecutors allege that on Monday, March 4, business exploded due to thousands of cans of Nitrous oxide and butane being stored in the building.\nThe explosion propelled numerous canisters through the air, killing Turner Salter of Clinton Township. Officials said the 19-year-old was about a quarter-mile away from the fire when he was hit in the head.\nExplosions rock Clinton Township on March 4, 2024 Kestou was arraigned in 41B District Court on one count of involuntary manslaughter, which is a 15-year felony.\nBond was set at $500,000 cash/surety only with the conditions that Kestou must wear a GPS tether, surrender his passport, not leave the state and have no weapons if he is released.\n\"Our hearts ache for the family and loved ones of the young man whose life was tragically cut short by this devastating explosion. We are steadfast in our commitment to pursuing justice and holding the individual accountable for their actions,‚Äù said Macomb County Prosecutor Pete Lucido, in a statement.\nKestou will be back in court for a probable cause hearing scheduled for Tuesday, May 7.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

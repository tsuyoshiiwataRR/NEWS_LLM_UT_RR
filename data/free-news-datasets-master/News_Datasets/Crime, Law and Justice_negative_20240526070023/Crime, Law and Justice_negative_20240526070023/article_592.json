    "text": "TIFFIN, Ohio — Tiffin police arrested a man Thursday accused of attempting to have sex with a minor. Porfirio Elijah Sutton, 23, of Tiffin, faces charges including disseminating matter harmful to a juvenile, importuning and attempting to have sex with a minor when he traveled to a meeting point law enforcement had established with him during an investigation into his alleged inappropriate communications with a juvenile. Police say Sutton admitted to the offenses during an interview with a detective. He was served with criminal charges and is being held in the Seneca County Jail. The week-long investigation into Sutton began after a parent reported to police that he was allegedly having inappropriate communication with a juvenile. Law enforcement then intervened, gained access to the juvenile's online account and made contact with Sutton. Police say Sutton, unaware law enforcement was involved, continued to send explicit material and eventually arranged a meeting with the juvenile \"for illicit purposes.\" Additional evidence confirming Sutton's intent was gathered as he was traveling to the meeting location and authorities arrested him en route without incident. “I am incredibly happy and proud of the outstanding work carried out by our Criminal Division in the recent investigation, as well as in all investigations they undertake,\" Tiffin Police Chief David Pauly said. \"Detective/Lieutenant Mark Marquis, Detective Rachel Stafford, and Detective Eric England have shown exceptional dedication and effort in ensuring the safety of our community, especially our vulnerable minors. Their commitment to upholding the law and protecting our citizens is truly commendable. It is their hard work, professionalism, and tireless efforts that make our community a safer place for everyone. I extend my sincerest gratitude and admiration to each of them for their unwavering dedication and service.”",

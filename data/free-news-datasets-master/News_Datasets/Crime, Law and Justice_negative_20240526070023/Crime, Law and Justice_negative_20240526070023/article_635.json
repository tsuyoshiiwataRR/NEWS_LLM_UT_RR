    "text": "MEDLEY, Fla. – Detectives reported a man referred to an organized fraud case out of Miami-Dade County’s town of Medley as an “under the table” deal.\nThe Medley Police Department announced the case on Thursday involved the arrests of Guillermo Gonzalez, Rolando Bazail, Reynel Castillo, and Roylis Rodriguez.\nRecommended Videos\n“These arrests mark a significant breakthrough in our ongoing efforts to combat organized crime,” Officer Deglys Chavarria, a spokesman for the department, wrote in a statement.\nThe group defrauded Countywide of Miami, a Medley-based fleet management company, of nearly $78,000 from August 2023 to Wednesday.\nDetectives identified Gonzalez, 45, and Bazail, 46, as Countywide of Miami employees, at 8501 NW 80 St. Surveillance videos show they arrived 45 minutes early to move plywood stacks to a loading dock.\nThe duo would then sell the plywood they had stolen to awaiting buyers. Detectives identified Castillo and Rodriguez as the two buyers present when Gonzalez and Diaz were arrested.\nReynel Castillo, left, and Roylis Rodriguez, were arrested over an organized scheme to defraud in Miami-Dade County. (MDPD) Rodriguez, 44, a certified tradesman for residential repairs, had used Zelle to pay Gonzalez about $15,000 for the stolen plywood.\nThe four men faced charges of organized fraud of $50,000 or more. They remained at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center on Thursday afternoon.\nCastillo and Rodriguez faced an additional charge of dealing in stolen property.\nDetectives asked anyone with information about this or other cases to call Miami-Dade County Crime Stoppers at 305-471-8477.\nCopyright 2024 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.",

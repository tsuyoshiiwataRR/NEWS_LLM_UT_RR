In a statement Ms Rawden’s office said: “HM Senior Coroner has reviewed the progress of the investigation into the death of Adam Johnson today, January 26 2024. “Since the opening of the inquest on November 3 2023, detectives from South Yorkshire Police have arrested and questioned a man on suspicion of manslaughter. \"In light of the fact a person may be charged with a homicide offence involving the death of the deceased, HM Senior Coroner has suspended her investigation into Mr Johnson’s death under Paragraph 1(2)(a) of Schedule 1 to the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. The relevant period for the purposes of Paragraph 1(4)(b) and Paragraph 7 of Schedule 1 to the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 will be 26 weeks, namely July 26 2024.\"",

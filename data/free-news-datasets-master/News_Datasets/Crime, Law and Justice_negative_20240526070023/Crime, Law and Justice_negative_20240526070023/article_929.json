Another person got into the driver's side of her Charger and then both of the gunmen took off in the stolen car. MPD said a black Kia Soul sped away from the scene of the carjacking with them.\nAfter stealing her possessions, MPD said the thieves used the woman's CashApp card at a corner store.\nSix days after the carjacking, the group stole another car. MPD said that carjacking took place at Avalon and Monroe Avenue. This time, six gunmen ran up behind someone as they were getting into their 2018 Mercedes Benz G25. The gunmen forced the people out of the car, stole their cell phones purses and sped off, again followed by a black Kia Soul, according to MPD.\nMPD released photos of the people wanted in connection to the carjackings. All face charges of aggravated robbery and aggravated assault.\nIf you have any idea who these people are, MPD urged you to call CrimeStoppers at 901-528-2274.",

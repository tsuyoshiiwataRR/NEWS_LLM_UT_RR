    "text": "Woman arrested following hit-and-run VERNON COUNTY, Wis. (WEAU) - A woman was charged today following a hit-and-run crash last Wednesday. On April 17, just before 4 p.m., 32-year-old Tasha Sittig of rural Lone Rock, Wis. was arrested following a hit-and-run reported earlier that morning at the intersection of County Road C and Pine Road in the village of Yuba in Richland County. Sittig was charged on April 23 with two counts of second-degree recklessly endangering safety, disorderly conduct and resisting or obstructing an officer. Additionally, Sittig was charged on April 25 with reckless driving-endangering safety, unreasonable and imprudent speed and following too closely in an automobile. A $500 cash bond was set. She is scheduled to appear in court on May 7. According to a joint news release from the Richland and Vernon County Sheriff’s Offices, on April 17 at about 10 a.m., the Richland County Sheriff’s Office was notified of a hit-and-run crash at the intersection of County Road C and Pine Road in the village of Yuba in Richland County. No injuries were reported. The vehicle was described as a black SUV, last seen traveling north on County Road H towards Vernon County. The victim reported that the SUV was being operated in a reckless manner and the crash may have been intentional. At about 3:30 p.m., the Vernon County Sheriff’s Office received multiple reports of a black SUV being driven recklessly in the village of Viola in Richland and Vernon Counties. One caller reported that the vehicle drove through a barricaded section of North Commercial Street/State Highway 131 that was under construction. The SUV description and license plate matched the information from the hit-and-run report. It was found in Viola and the driver was identified as Sittig. She was taken into custody and booked into Richland County Jail. On April 22, the Vernon County Sheriff’s Office was notified that the driver of a black SUV had driven recklessly through the Kickapoo Area Schools campus on April 1 and again on April 17. Video evidence and witness statements were taken during the investigation. Copyright 2024 WEAU. All rights reserved.",

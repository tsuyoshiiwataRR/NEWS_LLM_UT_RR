'One of the Hamasniks said he loves me, and that he brought my mother to approve of us getting married,' she recounted Noga Weiss, an 18-year-old Israeli who was kidnapped from her home in Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7, and held in captivity for 50 days, said that one of her Palestinian captors wanted to marry her. \"He gave me a ring on day 14, and I stayed with him until day 50,\" she said during an interview on Channel 12 News. \"He told me: Everyone will be released, but you will stay. You will stay with me and have my children.\" [Freed Israeli hostage recounts sexual abuse in Hamas captivity to NYT](/israel-news/2024-03-26/ty-article/freed-israeli-hostage-recounts-sexual-abuse-in-hamas-captivity-to-nyt/ 18e-7bd7-d8a5-addf-7bf7afb90000) [Freed hostage Maya Regev: Every woman hostage in Gaza experiences sexual abuse](/israel-news/2024-04-02/ty-article/.premium/freed-hostage-maya-regev-every-woman-hostage-in-gaza-experiences-sexual-abuse/ 18e-9e09-d764-adff-9ecfce650000) [Stop applauding Hamas for its ‘humanity’](/israel-news/haaretz-today/2023-11-26/ty-article/.highlight/stop-applauding-hamas-for-its-humanity/ 18c-0d33-ddff-a3bc-bdf7cc6a0000) Weiss, whose [father Ilan was murdered in Hamas' massacre](/israel-news/2024-01-01/ty-article/.premium/56-year-old-israeli-thought-missing-since-october-7-declared-dead-his-kibbutz-announces/ 18c-c5be-d6c4-ab8d-e5bec2a10000), said that she was separated from her mother during her kidnapping, and thought her to be dead. A few days later, she was reunited with her mother because her captor wanted to ask for her hand in marriage. \"One of the Hamas members said he loves me, he wants to marry me and brought my mother to me so she would approve of our marriage,\" she admitted. \"A woman dressed as an Arab entered, and I realize it's my mother. I thought they killed her, I thought I was alone. Suddenly she's alive, and I'm no longer alone.\" Weiss and her mother were released in a deal on November 25. In her interview with Channel 12, she recounted the day of her [kidnapping at Kibbutz Be'eri](/israel-news/2023-10-19/ty-article/.premium/on-kibbutz-beeri-time-stood-still-evidence-of-life-before-the-massacre/ 18b-4465-d242-abef-566704e70000): \"They started shooting at the door, something like 40 shots until they managed to get in. We saw the conversations on WhatsApp and understood what was happening. People wrote that their house is on fire and stopped answering.\" \"Mom told me to get under the bed, she thought, 'Let them come and shoot her straight away.' I went under the bed, they came and kidnapped her. After they took her out, I heard gunshots, I thought she was murdered and not kidnapped,\" Weiss said. She had attempted to run and hide from the terrorists, but one of them noticed her and took her outside to the yard and sat her there, she said. \"Something like 40 terrorists were around me with Kalashnikov [rifles], they handcuffed me; I saw bodies of people I know from the kibbutz. After a few minutes, they put me in a car and start driving.\" According to her, thousands of people, including children, cheered when the vehicle entered Gaza, and attempted to beat her. \"I didn't understand why they were delaying shooting me.\" Weiss was held captive with Moran Stella Yanai, and said that on her second night in Gaza, she was woken up by a bomb, when the window she was sleeping near shattered and injured her. They were moved at nighttime wearing a hijab, and \"Hamasniks held our hands so that people would think we were married, so that there would be nothing suspicious,\" Weiss said. \"They brought cards to play with, and I said fine, I'll play with them, I'll do what they want, as long as they don't shoot.\" \"Their moods changed so quickly. One minute they played with us and laughed, a second later they came with a gun. You always have to please them,\" Weiss added. She said that her captors tried to convince them that \"Israel is theirs, that they occupied the house. One said he was an elementary school teacher, and only talked about the fact that we kicked them out of their house and how wrong it was.\" Weiss says that she \"can't digest it, neither then nor now. People don't understand the feeling of fear. I was 50 days, 24/7, with the thought that they would get tired and come shoot me, or they wouldn't need me in the end. Let's say at night they lock us in the room, so they open the door in the middle of the night and shoot us without us knowing.\" She said that as long as there are hostages in the strip, she can't mourn her father. \"They are there for an indescribable amount of time. At one point, they brought us half a liter of water for two days. It does not make sense. You can't survive like this for 200 days.\"",

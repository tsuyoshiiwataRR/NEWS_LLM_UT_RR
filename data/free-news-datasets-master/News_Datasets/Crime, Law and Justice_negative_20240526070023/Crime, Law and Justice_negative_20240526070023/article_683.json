    "text": "Gardai were last night probing the theory that a young father who died in a road traffic collision in Co Carlow on Wednesday evening was run over and killed by someone he knew – five days after he absconded from prison.\nSources have confirmed that officers now believe Tom Connors knew the hit and run driver of the car that struck him as he rode a motorbike on a quiet country road in Co Carlow late on Wednesday night.\nThe driver then fled the scene of the tragedy – but not before he set his car on fire in a desperate bid to destroy forensic evidence.\nREAD MORE – Crazed stalker James Steele released from prison after serving three years for campaign of terror\nThe sources say gardaí are now trying to establish if he was killed in a tragic accident – or was deliberately targeted.\n“It was one or the other,” a source said.\n“It may take some time to get to the bottom of it, but we do believe the deceased and the driver of the car knew each other.\n“It was not an accident involving two strangers. We suspect the car and bike were travelling together and something happened and the vehicle driver panicked and fled or Mr Connors was lured there and hit on purpose.”\nMr Connors, 35, with an address at the Halting Site in Bunclody, Co Wexford died at the scene of the collision near Ballon in Co Carlow at around 10pm on Wednesday.\nHe was riding a motorcycle when he was struck and fatally injured by the car.\nThe driver of the car then fled the scene before gardaí arrived – but after destroying the car.\nSources confirmed to us that Mr Connors had absconded from Loughan House open prison in Co Cavan on Saturday.\nMr Connors had only been moved to that site from a secure prison 10 days earlier. He was serving a three year jail term for car theft – but was coming to the end of his sentence.\nPals paid tribute to him online last night.\nScene of the collision near Ballon, Co. Carlow.\nA relative said: “Rip cus 1 of the best hearted men I ever new a gentleman rest in peace tom top man sorry for you family’s loss had to be the wildest man I ever new you’ll be missed tom top man.”\nGardaí appealed for witnesses to the incident to contact them.\nA spokesman said: “Shortly before 11 pm, Gardaí and Emergency Services responded to a road traffic incident on a local road between Rathoe and Ballon at Sandbook, involving a motorcycle and a car.\n“The motorcyclist, a male in his 30s, was pronounced deceased at the scene.\n“The car involved was found burnt out at the location, and the occupants of the car failed to remain at the scene.\n“All the circumstances of this incident are being investigated, a Senior Investigating Officer (SIO) has been appointed and an incident room has been established at Carlow Garda Station.\n“Gardaí are appealing for any witnesses to this collision to come forward. Road users with camera footage (including dash-cam) who were traveling on the road between Rathoe and Ballon or the in surrounding areas, between 10:00 pm and midnight on Wednesday, April 24th, 2024, are asked to make this footage available to Gardaí.\n“Anyone with information regarding this collision is urged to contact Carlow Garda Station at 059 913 6620, the Garda Confidential Line at 1800 666 111, or any Garda station.”\nFor the latest breaking news and top stories, visit our homepage.\nJoin the Irish Mirror’s breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

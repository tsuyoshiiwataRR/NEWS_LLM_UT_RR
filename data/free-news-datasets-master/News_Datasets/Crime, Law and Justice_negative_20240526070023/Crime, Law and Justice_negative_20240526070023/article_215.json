    "text": "Man sentenced to 17 years for transporting meth, fentanyl through Nebraska MILFORD, Neb. (KOLN) - A man was sentenced to more than 17 years in prison Wednesday after a deputy found [fentanyl and meth during a traffic stop](https://www.1011now.com/2023/03/10/deputies-find-fentanyl-meth-during-traffic-stop/) on Interstate 80 in Milford last year. A judge sentenced 37-year-old Fausto Antonia Castro Mendoza of Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico, to 17.5 years behind bars. After completing his sentence, Castro Mendoza will be deported to Mexico as he is not a United States citizen. Castro Mendoza previously pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine and fentanyl in the case. On March 4, a Seward County Sheriffâ€™s deputy conducted a traffic stop on a white SUV traveling eastbound on I-80 near Highway 6 and made contact with the driver, Castro Mendoza, and front seat passenger, Jesus Villanueva. United States Attorney Susan Lehr said during the traffic stop, the deputy became suspicious of the two men and conducted a probable cause search of the SUV. The deputy discovered 44 pounds of meth and two pounds of fentanyl pills. In their post-arrest interviews, both Castro Mendoza and Villanueva admitted to transporting the meth and fentanyl pills from Denver, Colorado, to Omaha, and that each was being paid to do so, Attorney Lehr said. Villanueva pled guilty to the same narcotics charge and was sentenced to 19.5 years in prison on April 3. Copyright 2023 KOLN. All rights reserved.",

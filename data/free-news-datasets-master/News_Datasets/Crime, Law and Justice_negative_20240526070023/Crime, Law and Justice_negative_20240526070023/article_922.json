    "text": "Anchorage man charged with murder after turning himself in for 2009 shooting cold case ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - A man who police say walked into a Downtown Anchorage inn and shot two people, killing one, in 2009 has been charged with murder after turning himself in. The Alaska Department of Law indicted 56-year-old John Dahlquist in the cold case with three counts of second-degree murder. If convicted, the department said Dahlquist could face up to 99 years in jail. Erin McCarthy, an Assistant Attorney General and the Statewide Cold Case Prosecutor, spoke to the rarity behind Dahlquist’s confession. “It’s something I haven’t seen in the course of my position here,” said McCarthy. The case went cold after no suspects were identified by investigators following the Dec. 15, 2009, shooting at the Inlet Inn in Downtown Anchorage. Police said Dahlquist walked into the place and shot the front desk clerk, who survived, as well as 76-year-old Sang Il Chun, a bystander in the shooting. Chun later died. The state said that more than 14 years later, Dahlquist reached out to the Anchorage Police Department “with information about a cold case homicide,” and later confessed to the crime. McCarthy maintains the confession does bring a sense of closure to the cold case. “We have contacted the family of Mr. Chun and they seemed relieved to have finally heard something in their case and that there’s finally some closure that Mr. Dahlquist has been arrested and charged,” McCarthy said. Police said that due to a 10-year statute of limitations regarding robbery and assault cases, Dahlquist cannot be charged with crimes related to the alleged robbery or shooting of the clerk who survived.

    "text": "A caretaker is battling charges of stealing Sh600,000 from a rental company in Nairobi.\nHarrison Mungai Maina who was collecting rent from properties developed by Kaggs Investment Limited was charged before Milimani Law Courts chief magistrate Susan Shitubi.\nMaina is accused of stealing the money jointly with others who were not before the court.\nThe court heard that the offence was committed on diverse dates between 2017 and 2020.\nMaina who had been hired by the manager of the properties denied the charges.\nProsecuting Counsel Nyabera Kibera told the court the caretaker allegedly stole the money that he received from tenants in monthly collections for house rent.\nThe prosecution stated Kaggs Investment Limited owns properties in Eastleigh, Mlango Kubwa, Ngara, Kariobangi South, Thika Road, and Mombasa Road within Nairobi County.\nMaina was entrusted with the responsibility of collecting rent and releasing it to Kaggs Investment Limited.\nHe is accused of receiving the money and failing to remit it to his employer.\nThrough a defence lawyer, the accused applied to be released on reasonable bond terms.\n“Your honour, there is another criminal matter pending before court similar to this one where the complainant is the same,” the magistrate heard.\nThe court heard that in the other matter, the accused was charged with stealing Sh500,000 on diverse dates between January 2017 and June 2020.\nThe accused was freed on a Sh100,000 bond with surety of the same or alternative cash bail of Sh600,000.\nThe matter will be mentioned on May 7, 2023, for pre-trial and directions.\nAlso read: Chef Wa Eastlando – This Is why I don’t show my face\nComedian Churchill speaks about his favourite content creator – Watch",

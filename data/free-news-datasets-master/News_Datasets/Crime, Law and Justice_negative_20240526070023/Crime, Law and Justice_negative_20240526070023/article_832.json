    "text": "ONTARIO, Calif. , April 25, The 2 nd Annual 5K at the Runway at Ontario International Airport (ONT) raised more than $32,000 for the USO to help further the organization's support of military servicemembers traveling through the popular aviation gateway.\nOn Thursday, the Ontario International Airport Authority presented a check for $32,079.11 to the USO at ONT, the latest in the airport's longstanding commitment to our nation's troops.\nContinue Reading\nThe Ontario International Airport Authority Board of Commissioners presents a check for $32,079.11 to the USO. The money represents net proceeds from ONT's 2nd Annual 5k at the Runway.\n\"We are proud to support the USO, its many volunteers and, above all, the brave men and women whose dedicated service to our nation provides us with the freedom we cherish,\" said Alan D. Wapner , President of the OIAA Board of Commissioners and a member of the USO California Advisory Board. \"The USO plays such an important role in providing comfort and support to military members and their families while they travel, and here at Ontario International Airport, we have one of the best facilities of its kind anywhere.\"\nThursday's check represented the net proceeds from the annual race and community event, which took place on National USO Day â€“ February 4 . Nearly 1,000 runners and community members participated in the event, at the National Guard hangar. That location, adjacent to the airport's runways, provided a unique experience for all involved.\n\"We want to thank all of the participants, and our sponsors, for making this year's 5K at the Runway such a runaway success, while raising money for our great partners at the USO,\" said Atif Elkadi , OIAA Chief Executive Officer.\nThe USO at ONT opened in 2006 and is open 365 days a year on the southern edge of the former Terminal One. Thousands of servicemembers use the facility each year, many of them from nearby bases such as Fort Irwin , MCLB Barstow and March Air Reserve Base.\nAbout Ontario International Airport Ontario International Airport (ONT) is the fastest growing airport in the United States , according to Global Traveler, a leading publication for frequent fliers. Located in the Inland Empire, ONT is approximately 35 miles east of downtown Los Angeles in the center of Southern California .

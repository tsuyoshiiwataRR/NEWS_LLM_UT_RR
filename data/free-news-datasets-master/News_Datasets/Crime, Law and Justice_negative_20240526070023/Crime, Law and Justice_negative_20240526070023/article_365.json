    "text": "SEATTLE — The shootings, assaults, sex trafficking and other crimes that occur along Seattle’s Aurora Avenue North will be the focus of a community conversation on Thursday night, hosted by Seattle City Councilmember Cathy Moore and other local leaders. While the latest data shows overall crime is down along the corridor, police said some categories continue to show troubling increases. Those areas include shots fired, robberies, auto theft and violent crime.

Statistics presented during those meetings show that overall crime in Seattle’s North Precinct is down 12%. However, violent crime has increased 17%, shots fired are up 35% and auto theft has increased 20% compared to the same time period in 2023.

A flashpoint area is around Aurora and North 105th Street, according to police.

    "text": "ALBANY, Ga. (WALB) - An influx of business property crimes is causing the Albany Police Department (APD) to call on business owners to band together for preventative measures. So far in 2024, there have been 21 different Albany businesses burglarized.\nJust Wednesday, the Dollar General located on Radium Springs Road was hit by a smash-a-grab. The suspect, who hasn’t been arrested yet, only took chips and drinks and left behind significant damage.\nThe suspect broke into the store and took chips and drinks. (walb) “I’m just so devastated this happened to this store,” said Bertha Thomas, a customer.\nIt’s a bigger devastation for business owners who are stuck with the repairs.\n“It takes two-three minutes to break the door, but it takes months to fix it and a few thousand dollars,” said Sudha Patel, owner of Quick Buys Food Stores.\nShe said they have been hit two times within the past three months. According to Albany police, in 2023, there were 102 burglaries and 30 robberies.\nLt. Jon Segroves, supervisor of the Albany police property crime unit, said they are hoping resources like the FUSUS system will help this year’s crime trend. But he said business owners can also take preventative measures.\n“It’s just very detrimental to the businesses to have to keep putting up with this type of activity and criminal behavior,” Segroves said. “There’s nothing that’s going to prevent all of this from happening, but what you can do is you can lessen the damage to your business as much as possible by making what’s left out not desirable to the public so that they don’t come in.”\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction?

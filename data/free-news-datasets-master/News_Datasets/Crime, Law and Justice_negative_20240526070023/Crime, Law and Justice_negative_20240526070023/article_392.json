    "text": "WASHINGTON COUNTY, Tenn. (WCYB) — An Erwin man accused of intentionally crashing a vehicle and punching a woman has been charged, according to the Washington County, Tennessee Sheriff's Office. Deputies arrested 37-year-old Brice Teague on Wednesday and charged him with aggravated domestic assault, evading arrest and driving on a suspended license. Deputies responded to a wreck in the 1100 block of Conklin Road. Once deputies arrived, the alleged victim was on scene but the driver, later identified as Teague, fled on foot. The alleged victim, who was a passenger in the car, said that that Teague intentionally crashed the vehicle and stated he said he “wanted to kill her and himself.” Teague is accused of punched the woman multiple times in the arm, and she had bruising on her wrists, arms and shoulders. Teague was found a short time later in a field on Cloyd Road. He ran into the woods, and deputies found him hiding under a log. Teague is being held in the Washington County Detention Center on a $50,000 bond and is due in court on Thursday.",

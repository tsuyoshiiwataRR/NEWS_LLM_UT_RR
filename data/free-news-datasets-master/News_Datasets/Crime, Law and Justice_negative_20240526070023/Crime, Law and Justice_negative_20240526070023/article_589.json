    "text": "MIAMI BEACH, Fla. ( [CBS12](https://cbs12.com/news/local/man-gregory-gibert-arrested-for-brutal-murder-of-transgender-woman-andrea-doria-dos-passos-at-miami-city-ballet-steps-south-florida-news-april-24-2024#)) — A man is charged with brutally beating a transgender woman to death on the steps of the Miami City Ballet, police said. The Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPD) said the woman — now identified as 37-year-old Andrea Doria Dos Passos — was found on the front steps of the Miami City Ballet on Tuesday morning by a security guard who thought she was just sleeping. Police said she was partially clothed and wearing a blood-soaked blanket. Residents living nearby said Dos Passos is known to be homeless and she typically slept on the steps of the ballet building. \"Who wouldn't be sad? Right. I mean, anybody does not deserve to die in a park like this, you know,\" said George Buchholz who lives near the scene. Police said the building and a library close by have surveillance systems, and check if the victim's tragic death was captured on the cameras. \"Our organization is very confident that we'll be able to identify and arrest the subject responsible for this heinous crime,\" said MDPD officer Christopher Bess. According to our news partners at WSVN, police have arrested someone in connection to Dos Passos' death on Wednesday. WSVN was able to obtain the arrest affidavit for 53-year-old Gregory Gibert. Police said while Dos Passos was lying down on the steps sleeping, Gibert was spotted surveying the area. As police viewed the surveillance videos, investigators saw the horrific scene. Gibert grabbed a metal pipe and began to hit her multiple times across the head and face, according to the arrest report. After the beating, Gilbert allegedly tossed the pipe in a trash can and fled the scene. In the report police noted the severity of the beating. In addition to the trauma to her head and face, two wooden sticks were jammed up Dos Passos' nose, and she had a puncture wound to her chest, according to the report. According to the arrest report, detectives said they were able to connect Gilbert to the crime due to his previous arrest record and his description. Gibert was arrested and faces one count of second-degree murder.",

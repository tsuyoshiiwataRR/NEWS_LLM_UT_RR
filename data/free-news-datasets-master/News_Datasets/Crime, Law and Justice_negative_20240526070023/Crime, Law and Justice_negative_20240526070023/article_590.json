    "text": "HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, Fla. -- A 31-year-old man has been arrested for the \"brutal\" murders of a woman and child in Florida. Angel Gabriel Cuz-Choc was arrested Thursday morning in a wooded area less than two miles from the crime scene. \"From the moment our deputies arrived at the gruesome scene, we poured every resource available into tracking down the suspect responsible for this heinous crime and bringing him to justice,\" said Sheriff Chad Chronister. \"Cuz-Choc will face the full weight of the criminal justice system for his vicious, vile, and evil actions.\" Hillsborough County deputies responded to a trailer around 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, where they found a 36-year-old woman dead outside and a bloody handprint on the wall of the home. Inside, they located a deceased 4-year-old girl. Both reportedly died of blunt force trauma. \"Not only did he commit an unimaginable crime which cruelly claimed the lives of two innocent victims, he then made the cowardly and ultimately futile attempt to evade capture. His efforts were no match for our team of dedicated detectives who left no stone unturned in their search,\" said Sheriff Chad Chronister. \"There wasn't a square inch within this perimeter that our deputies did not have covered.\" The two victim's are identified as: The sheriff says Cuz-Choc was romantically involved with the woman. In interviews with detectives after he was arrested, Cuz-Choc confessed to both murders, according to deputies. While additional charges may be forthcoming, at this time, Cuz-Choc is facing the following charges:",

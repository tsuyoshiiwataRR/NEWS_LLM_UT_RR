    "text": "WASHINGTON COUNTY, Tenn. (WCYB) â€” A Jonesborough man nearly struck a woman with a vehicle before he crashed into a house on Wednesday, according to the Washington County, Tennessee Sheriff's Office. Richard Shane King-Jessee, 27, has been charged with driving under the influence, reckless endangerment and driving on a restricted license related to a prior DUI. According to Sheriff Keith Sexton, deputies responded to a crash in the 4000 block of Old Jonesborough Road shortly after 10 p.m. While on the way, dispatch informed deputies that the driver of the vehicle, later identified as King- Jessee, called 911 stating no accident had occurred. When deputies arrived, they saw that the vehicle was lodged between the front porch and the garage of the house. Authorities said King-Jessee told them that something had run across the road, and he had swerved to avoid it. There were no skid marks observed where the King-Jessee had left the roadway, authorities added. A woman walking her dog in the front yard of the house narrowly missed being struck by the vehicle as it veered off the road and into the house and was taken to an area hospital for treatment. King-Jessee was supposed to have a vehicle interlock ignition in place in his vehicle due to having a prior DUI from April 2023. However, no such device was in place in the vehicle he crashed into the house, authorities added. Deputies took King-Jessee to the Washington County Detention Center where he made the $10,000 bond and was released two hours after being booked. He is due to appear in court on Thursday.",

    "text": "Carroll Community College is preparing its nursing students for real-life scenarios with a mass casualty training exercise. The two-year nursing program at Carroll Community College, in partnership with Allied Health, has seen substantial growth since its inception in 2005, expanding from 10 students to approximately 100. Earlier this month, the college conducted a mass casualty training exercise focusing on disaster response. Nursing students collaborated with personnel from Carroll Hospital and local first responders in an earthquake scenario.

Annette Aldridge, 55, went to the dentist with a loose tooth and was shocked when she was told her all her teeth would be needed to be taken out due to infection. The soon to be retired dermatology nurse was given dentures - but said they don't fit in her mouth and keep falling out. Four months after she had nearly all her teeth removed, she lost two stone because she's barely able to eat, and is being investigated for malnutrition, she said. She has just one molar and two front teeth and has taken early retirement due to sheer exhaustion. Annette from Epping, Essex, said: \"As a nurse I cannot function. I can't eat during the day as I would have to take my teeth out. \"I can eat at night but I go to bed thinking that this is no life. \"In March I handed my notice in, as much as I don't want to give up I can't carry on.\" Annette said she has always been \"petrified\" of the dentist but went for a loose tooth in July 2022. The dentist said she would have to take all the teeth out as they were infected, she claims. Annette said: \"I had built up a rapport with this dentist and I really trusted her. \"She said how she was going to take all my teeth out and replace them with teeth like a gum shield.\" 14 weeks after her first set, Annette went back to her dentist practice because the dentures did not align with her gums and kept falling out. Annette said: \"The dentist who fitted them had left. \"I had a new dentist who said I would have never been suitable for this denture. \"They gave me a new set that didn't stay in my mouth - I couldn't even eat with them.\" Annette went back to her dentist again and they gave her another set. Each costs Annette £300. She said: \"I can't see that anything will work. I need to get implants but I can't afford them. \"I am living on bread and eggs. I have found as long as I cut things up I can put it in my mouth as if it was a pill and swallow. \"There is nothing I can chew.\" As well as frequent dentist visits, Annette has been going to the doctors with exhaustion. She said: \"Five months in and I was absolutely exhausted. I thought 'I cannot carry on this way'.\" Annette has another dentist appointment in May. She said: \"I will tell him that these still don't fit and ask what he is going to do. \"I don't think anything will work. \"I am so tired, I am exhausted all the time, and that is not me. \"37 years as a … [Murder suspect makes deathbed confession leading police to disturbing discovery](/topic/nursing/murder-suspect-makes-deathbed-confession-leading-police-to-disturbing-discovery/f-1b062a7395%2Funilad.com) Police in West Virginia made a disturbing discovery after a suspect in a decades-old investigation made a deathbed confession.

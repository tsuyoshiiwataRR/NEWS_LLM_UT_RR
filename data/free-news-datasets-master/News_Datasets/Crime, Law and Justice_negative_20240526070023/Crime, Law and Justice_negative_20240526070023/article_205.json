    "text": "Top New York City Police Department officials slammed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Thursday for demonizing law enforcement’s response to anti-Semitic protests on Columbia University’s campus. Ocasio-Cortez [responded](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1783224425074086256) to a video posted on X that showed NYPD counterterrorism officers on campus who were there to ensure that the far-left extremists did not become violent. “Not only did Columbia make the horrific decision to mobilize NYPD on their own students, but the units called in have some of the most violent reputations on the force,” she claimed. “NYPD had promised the city they wouldn’t deploy SRG [Strategic Response Group] to protests.” “So why are these counterterror units here?” she asked. NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell fired back at AOC: “Truly amazing! Columbia decided to hold its students accountable to the laws of the school. They are seeing the consequences of their actions. Something these kids were most likely never taught. Good SAT scores and self-entitlement do not supersede the law. I am sure you would agree that we have to teach them these valuable life skills.” “Secondly, I was with those ‘units’ last Thursday that you describe as having, ‘the most violent reputations.’ These ‘units’ removed students with great care and professionalism, not a single incident was reported,” he continued. “The only incidents that day on campus were the student’s hateful anti-Semitic speech and vile language towards our cops. I am sure you agree any hateful speech is unacceptable. You should rethink your comments to a simple thank you to the NYPD and hate has no place in our society.” Chell said that AOC should visit the campus and “listen to their remarks of pure hatred.” “I will ensure those ‘units’ will protect you as they do for all NYers 24/7/365,” he added. “Lack of accountability = consequences. Hate from anyone, anywhere has no place in our city and country.” NYPD Deputy Commissioner Kaz Daughtry also responded to AOC’s remarks on X: “Everyone has a Constitutional right to protest, it’s one of the pillars our great democracy is built on. But kids also have a right to go to school without being harassed, threatened, intimidated or assaulted.” “There is nothing ‘horrific’ about protecting the safety of Columbia’s young students who are just trying to go to school,” he continued. “We’ve said it time and time again, the NYPD will always protect and defend your right to protest but just because you hold a sign while you’re threatening, harassing, intimidating and assaulting people doesn’t give you a free pass from criminal conduct.” [CLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP](https://onelink.to/dwapp) “Being anti-Semitic and spewing hate to kids will never ever be tolerated in our city,” he added. “Our officers are the best and most highly trained law enforcement professionals in the world. Everyday, they have to endure insults, threats, and hate speech merely because the uniform they wear as they try to keep the peace and protect everyone’s rights. I encourage you @AOC to visit Columbia and do a walk through; I promise our officers will, like always, do their job, and protect you like they have protected everyone on campus regardless of what your political beliefs are. We’ll also take a report if you feel threatened.” Everyone has a Constitutional right to protest, it’s one of the pillars our great democracy is built on. But kids also have a right to go to school without being harassed, threatened, intimidated or assaulted. There is nothing “horrific” about protecting the safety of Columbia’s… [https://t.co/a3fEQQEIeh] — NYPD Deputy Commissioner, Operations Kaz Daughtry (@NYPDDaughtry) [April 25, 2024]",

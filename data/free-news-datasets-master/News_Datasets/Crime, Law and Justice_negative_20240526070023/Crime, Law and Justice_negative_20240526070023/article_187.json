    "text": "Scammers are using fake Windows Defender pop-up messages to convince PC users to hand over hundreds of pounds. In reality, however, these warnings are completely false and have nothing to do with Microsoft. They are caused by trojan malware that can delete, block, modify, leak or copy data. But your device isn't affected by this trojan – it's simply a window trying to convince you to call the number on-screen. Below, we explain how to remove these pop-ups for good. Plus, we've got details on how we uncover the best free and paid-for antivirus software. Join Which?

'I've had a Windows Defender pop-up message appear on my laptop that I can't get rid of – it's taken over my screen and is telling me my device is under threat from a detected Trojan program and I need to contact Microsoft. What should I do?' Which? Tech Support member 'This is a well-known scam that we regularly get contacted about – it has nothing to do with Microsoft, is extremely annoying and very convincing. The message can take over your entire screen, so you can see why some people feel obliged to call the on-screen number. The call usually revolves around the scammer convincing you that your machine is 'infected' and a payment (typically a few hundred pounds) by bank transfer or gift cards will resolve the issue. The scammers are usually very persistent. Don't call the number, though, as there's an easy fix. Just follow the steps below.' Which?

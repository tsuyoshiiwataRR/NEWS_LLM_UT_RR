    "text": "NORTH LAUDERDALE, Fla. – Broward County deputies arrested rapper and television personality Sukihana Thursday, according to jail records.\nThose records show that Sukihana, whose real name is Destiny Lanette Henderson, was arrested in North Lauderdale on charges of possession of ecstasy with intent to sell, manufacture or deliver and possession of codeine with intent to sell, manufacture or deliver.\nRecommended Videos\nHenderson, 32, with hair dyed bright orange, flashed a grin in her mug shot after deputies booked her into jail.\nThe Delaware native rose to prominence in 2020 as a cast member on the VH1 reality show “Love & Hip Hop: Miami.”\nThat same year, she debuted her first mixtape, titled “Wolf P----.”\nShe told a publication that her stage name derives from the name of a Japanese restaurant in a Delaware mall.\nAdditional details about Henderson’s Broward arrest weren’t immediately made available. Local 10 News has put in a request for her arrest report from the Broward Sheriff’s Office.\nJail records show she was being held in BSO’s Paul Rein Detention Facility in Pompano Beach on a $7,500 bond as of Thursday afternoon.\nCopyright 2024 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Police are searching for the driver who struck a motorcycle, killing the rider, then fled the scene Wednesday night on U.S. 1 in the Dumfries area. The wreck happened just before 10:20 p.m. when a pickup truck hit a 2023 Kawasaki Ninja 400R motorcycle that was \"traveling at a high rate of speed\" southbound on Richmond Highway approaching Pine Bluff Drive, police said. The 2020 Chevrolet Colorado truck was traveling northbound on Richmond Highway when it entered the intersection in front of the motorcycleâ€™s path, said Prince William County police Master Officer Renee Carr. After hitting the bike, the pickup driver fled the scene. The rider, 20-year-old Joseph Emmanuel Word of Dumfries, was thrown from the bike, Carr said. He was taken to an area hospital, where he was pronounced dead, she said. The truck was later found unoccupied behind a nearby business. A police K-9 searched for the suspect without success. Investigators want to talk to anyone who may have witnessed the crash or has information about those involved.",

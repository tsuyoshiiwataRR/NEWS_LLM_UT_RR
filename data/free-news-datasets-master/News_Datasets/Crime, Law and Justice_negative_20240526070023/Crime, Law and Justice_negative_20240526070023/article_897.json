    "text": "DUNCAN, S.C. (FOX Carolina) - The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division said three family members have been charged in connection to the disturbing death of a special needs 13-year-old from Spartanburg County.\nAn investigation was launched into the death of Robert Blake Fish, who passed away on Oct. 8, 2022. He was diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome earlier in life, a severe medical condition that causes epilepsy and other developmental delays.\nWhen first responders were called to his home in the fall of 2022, investigators said they found Fish left out on the porch. The teen was only 47 pounds when he died, officials said.\nAfter an autopsy was completed, the coroner’s office listed Fish’s death as malnutrition and dehydration. Other significant conditions included withholding seizure medication, the coroner reported.\nThe teen was supposed to be on multiple different medications according to authorities, but he was not being given them by his mother, Hope Fish. Investigators said they found a bottle of seizure medicine for Fish at the home that had been filled five months earlier - and still had 85 pills inside.\nLeft to right: Freddie Fish Sr., Freddie Fish II, and Hope Fish (Spartanburg Co. Sheriff's Office) After a lengthy investigation, Hope Fish, Freddie Fish II and Freddie Fish Senior were all charged and booked into the Spartanburg County Detention Center on April 24.\nHope Fish has been charged with murder, felony child abuse and unlawful neglect towards a child.\nFreddie Fish II, the victim’s uncle, is facing accessory to murder and unlawful neglect towards a child charges.\nFreddie Fish Sr., his grandfather, has been charged with unlawful neglect towards a child.\nHope Fish, Freddie Fish II and Freddie Fish Senior were all charged and booked into the Spartanburg County Detention Center When Hope Fish was working, Freddie Fish Sr. was the boy’s primary caretaker. Officials said Freddie Fish II was also a trained caretaker and did not help him.\nDuring a bond hearing on Thursday afternoon, Hope Fish and Freddie Fish II were denied bond. Freddie Fish Sr. was given a $5,000 bond.\nAccording to an obituary for the 13-year-old he “never met a stranger” and was “always smiling and making those around him laugh.” He loved Mickey Mouse, Christmas and milkshakes from Cookout.\n“Robert was the definition of an angel on earth,” his obituary says.\nMORE NEWS: Missing 24-year-old found dead in Elbert County; GBI investigating\nCopyright 2024 WHNS.

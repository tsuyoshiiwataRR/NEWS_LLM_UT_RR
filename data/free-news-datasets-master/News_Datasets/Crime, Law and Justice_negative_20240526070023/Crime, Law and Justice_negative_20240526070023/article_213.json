    "text": "A total of 67 alleged buyers of stolen goods were arrested, as law enforcers conducted several raids in Karachi. Following the directives of Sindh’s Chief Minister, Sindh police initiated a crackdown against the buyers of robbed mobile phones and arrested 67 individuals in District West of Karachi.\nThe Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) district West, HafeezurRehmanBugti, claimed to have recovered stolen goods, including mobile phones and spare parts of the stolen vehicles, from the shops and warehouses of the arrested individuals.\nMeanwhile, an investigation has been launched against the arrested individuals.\nEarlier this month, Sindh Chief Minister (CM) Murad Ali Shah directed to take measures to monitor the sale of stolen or snatched mobile phones and vehicles as spare parts or in their complete form in the markets of Karachi.\nThe chief minister issued the directives while chairing the 31st Apex Committee meeting, which was attended by provincial ministers SharjeelMemon, Zia Lanjar, Mayor Karachi MurtazaWahab, Corps Commander Karachi Lt Gen Babar Iftikhar, DG Ranger Major General AzharWaqas, IG Police GhulamNabiMemon and others, said a statement issued today.\nChairing the 31st Apex Committee meeting here Monday, the chief minister said that police pickets would be established to strengthen the left bank of the River Indus and contain the dacoits within the Katcha area. The recovery of ransom from the families of the kidnapped individuals will be considered terror financing and the people involved in facilitating the collection of the ransom amount would be identified through intelligence work to crush them,” the CM said.\nComparative figures for the first three months (January to April) of 2023 and 2024 indicate a decrease in the number of theft cases reported, the statement noted. In 2024, 15,345 two-wheelers were stolen which is 953 cases less than the 16,298 incidents reported in 2023. Similarly, the theft of four-wheelers decreased by 145 cases with 520 vehicles stolen in 2024 as compared to 665 in 2023. The number of mobile phones snatched also showed a decline, with 6,813 cases reported in 2024 as compared to 8,688 in 2023, indicating a decrease of 1,875 cases.\nAccording to the statistics, there has been a significant increase in the snatching of four-wheelers and two-wheelers. In 2023, 60 two-wheelers were snatched, and this number increased to 80 in 2024. Similarly, 1805 two-wheelers were snatched in 2023, while the number of cases rose to 3094 in 2024.\nThe meeting was told that the police conducted 467 encounters in 2024.

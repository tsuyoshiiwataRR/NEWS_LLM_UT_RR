    "text": "New Delhi: In a significant cyber fraud incident targeting an elderly retired MNC director in Mumbai, around Rs 25 crore was taken illegally taken by individuals posing as authorities through WhatsApp calls. According to police reports, the victim, residing in the western suburbs, received a call on February 6, purportedly from the “telecom department,” informing her of imminent deactivation of three of her mobile numbers.\nUpon inquiry, she was connected to someone claiming to be a “police officer,” who asserted that her phone numbers and Aadhaar were implicated in a money laundering investigation. The alleged officer then transferred the call to another individual posing as a “CBI officer” named Rajesh Mishra. Mishra, in a series of manipulative conversations, convinced the victim that her bank account and Aadhaar details had been compromised, and she was embroiled in a money laundering scheme totaling Rs 6.8 crore.\nUnder the guise of assistance, Mishra forced the victim into transferring substantial sums of money to various accounts, citing the need to clear her name. This included orchestrating the sale of her and her mother’s shares, liquidating mutual fund investments, and even procuring a gold loan to comply with his demands.\nExploitation and isolation: Mishra’s deceptive tactics\nThe fraudulent activities transpired between February 6 and April 3, during which Mishra, exploiting the victim’s vulnerability, manipulated her into believing in the legitimacy of his claims. He fabricated threats of legal repercussions and instructed her to refrain from discussing the matter with anyone, further isolating her from potential intervention.\nVictim lodges complaint\nDespite Mishra’s elaborate scheme, the victim eventually realised she had been deceived upon visiting the Andheri police station on April 3, under the pretense of collecting RBI documentation. Subsequently, on April 10, a complaint was lodged with the cyber crime police, prompting an investigation led by a dedicated team supervised by joint commissioner of police (crime) Lakhmi Gautam and DCP Datta Nalawade, with senior inspector Datta Chavan at the helm.",

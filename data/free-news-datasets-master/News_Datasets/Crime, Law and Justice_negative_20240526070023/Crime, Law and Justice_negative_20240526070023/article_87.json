    "text": "6-year-old girl injured in drive-by shooting at Cumberland County home A child was injured Wednesday night by a bullet that pierced through the wall of a Cumberland County home. At 11:40 p.m., the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office was dispatched to a home on Pleasant View Drive, east of Fayetteville, in reference to a drive-by shooting. When deputies arrived, they found the home empty with multiple bullet holes sprayed across the front. A 6-year-old is being treated at a local hospital and is expected to recover, the sheriff's office said. Three people were inside the home when shots were fired, but no one was injured. A family with multiple children lives in the home, according to neighbors. Neighbors told WRAL News they heard 10 to 15 gunshots then looked outside shortly after to see neighbors and deputies running toward the yard. One bullet even hit a neighboring house owned by Kim Cowger. \"I heard seven fast shots and my son came running into the room,\" said Cowger. \"Of course, I called 911.\" No arrests have been made. The Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office is asking anyone with information to come forward. People can call 910-677-5495 or 910-323-1500 (after-hours). Anonymous tips can be submitted through Crime Stoppers, 910-483-TIPS (8477).

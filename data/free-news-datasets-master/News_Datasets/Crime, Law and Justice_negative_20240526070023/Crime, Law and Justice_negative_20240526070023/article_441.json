    "text": "A [controversial 2021 law](https://www.kqed.org/news/11860308/why-just-allowing-fourplexes-wont-solve-californias-housing-affordability-crisis) that allows property owners in California to split their lots and build up to two new homes is unconstitutional, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled this week. The ruling striking down [Senate Bill 9](https://focus.senate.ca.gov/sb9) only applies to the five Southern California charter cities that were parties to the case: Redondo Beach, Whittier, Carson, Del Mar and Torrance. However, if the case is appealed, the appellate court’s ruling will apply to [charter cities](https://www.cacities.org/UploadedFiles/LeagueInternet/6b/6bbb4ee3-88f9-4d8f-93ad-0075a7b486c4.pdf) statewide, including San Francisco, Oakland and San José. The decision, issued on Monday, is a blow to key state leaders, who [hailed the law](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/09/16/governor-newsom-signs-historic-legislation-to-boost-californias-housing-supply-and-fight-the-housing-crisis/) as a way to [open single-family neighborhoods](https://www.kqed.org/news/11840548/the-racist-history-of-single-family-home-zoning) to desperately needed housing. And it’s an endorsement of an opposing idea: that suburban neighborhoods should be reserved for single-family homes, said Chris Elmendorf, a law professor at UC Davis. “It’s an indication of unease or discomfort with housing laws that are trying to transform single-family-home neighborhoods,” he said.",

    "text": "Ocean View woman charged in senior citizen assault An Ocean View woman faces charges after police say she assaulted a senior citizen April 23. Delaware State Police responded at 7 p.m. to a report of an assault in the 37000 block of Mahogany Street near Ocean View, where troopers spoke with a woman, 66, who said she was assaulted by another woman, police said. Police said the elderly woman was in the driveway of a house when Regina Bonacquisti, 48, who she does not know, aggressively approached her from the roadway, assaulted her and damaged her vehicle. After the assault, police said, Bonacquisti left the scene. The victim was taken to an area hospital for her injuries. Warrants were obtained for Bonacquistiâ€™s arrest, and she was arrested April 24. She was charged with felony second-degree assault of victim over the age of 62, criminal mischief under $1,500, and disorderly conduct. She was arraigned at Justice of the Peace Court 2, and committed to Sussex Correctional Institution in default of a $2,700 cash bond.

On Thursday, the director of the company pleaded guilty to violating the province's Occupational Health and Safety Act. (Submitted by Alyson Fair - image credit)\nThe director of a hedge trimming company has pleaded guilty to a non-criminal charge brought against him after a worker died last year on the job in Manotick.\nIn May 2023, Nick Chenier, a 20-year-old employee for Best Green Hedges, was electrocuted after hitting a hydro line while trimming a hedge.\nHe was taken to hospital in critical, life-threatening condition and later died from his injuries.\nIn November, the Ontario Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development brought charges against Best Green Hedges, company director Sheldon Best Green and supervisor Steven Deans.\nAccording to court documents, the ministry charged Best Green with failing to ensure the company took all reasonable steps to comply with the province's Occupational Health and Safety Act while at the site of the hedge trimming.\nBest Green pleaded guilty to that charge on Thursday afternoon.\n'My son is gone forever'\nChenier's mother, Jennifer, said in a victim impact statement that her son's death had deeply affected her life.\n\"I don't feel I have the right to be happy when my son is gone forever,\" she said.\nIn a separate victim impact statement, Chenier's younger brother Michael told the court that he lost both his brother and his best friend.\nBest Green also spoke in court Thursday, saying that Chenier's death \"was the hardest thing I've had to deal with in my life.\"\n\"There's little I can say to comfort you,\" Best Green said. \"But I have to say I'm truly sorry for what happened.\"\nJennifer Chenier (left) said in a victim impact statement that the death of her son Nick (right) has changed her life forever. Jennifer Chenier, left, said in a victim impact statement that the death of her son Nick, right, has changed her life forever. (Submitted by Alyson Fair)\nFined roughly $50,000\nJustice of the peace Jennifer Robinson accepted a joint proposal from the Crown and defence to fine Best Green $45,000, plus a victim impact surcharge.\nCrown attorney David McCaskill said while the total penalty comes to about $50,000, it's not an attempt to put a price on the life of a young man.\nStory continues Best Green also accepted responsibility, which sped up the file, McCaskill said, although he also noted the accident was avoidable.\nKevin Warning, who represents Best Green and the company, said his client was resolute from the beginning that he wanted to accept responsibility.\nWhile Warning said the company had taken several steps to prevent this kind of tragedy — like offering training on the use of mobile elevated platforms — he added that those steps doesn't mean the blame lies on Chenier.\nSupervisor criminally charged Thursday\nThe ministry had also charged Deans with failing to take reasonable precautions for the safety of a worker.\nBut on Thursday afternoon, the Ottawa Police Service announced it had charged the 38-year-old with one count of criminal negligence causing death.\nBecause of the new criminal charge, his lawyer Fabienne Lajoie asked for a one-month adjournment so he could consider his options.\nBest Green Hedges also faced three charges, including not taking all reasonable precautions to protect a worker.\nIn particular, the ministry claimed the company failed to ensure tools that could conduct electricity were not used near live electrical wires.\nThe company was also charged with failing to warn a worker about hazards and failing to give information to a worker to protect their health and safety.\nBut those charges were withdrawn. McCaskill said it was not in the public interest to pursue them since Best Green took personal responsibility.\nTRENDING 1. Harvey Weinstein’s rape conviction is overturned by New York's top court 2.

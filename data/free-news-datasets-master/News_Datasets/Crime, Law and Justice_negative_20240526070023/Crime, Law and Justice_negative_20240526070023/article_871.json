    "text": "Donald Trump will not get a new trial in his case against E. Jean Carroll, after federal Judge Lewis Kaplan on Thursday denied the former president's request. Trump was ordered to pay Carroll , an advice columnist, $83.3 million, after a New York jury ruled in January that he had defamed her in 2019 by denying her allegations of sexual assault. The ruling and heavy sum was on top of $5 million Trump already owed Carroll from an earlier case last year, in which a civil jury found he had sexually assaulted and defamed her again in 2022. Did Donald Trump rape E. Jean Carroll? Here's what a jury and judge said. Judge Kaplan rejected Trump's latest attempt to avoid paying over $80 million, finding in his rulin g Thursday the former president's motion for a new trial or judgment \"without merit\" and the amount in damages appropriate. \"Mr. Trump’s malicious and unceasing attacks on Ms. Carroll were disseminated to more than 100 million people,\" the judge wrote. \"They included public threats and personal attacks, and they endangered Ms. Carroll’s health and safety. The jury was entitled to conclude that Mr. Trump derailed the career, reputation, and emotional well-being of one of America’s most successful and prominent advice columnists and authors.\"",

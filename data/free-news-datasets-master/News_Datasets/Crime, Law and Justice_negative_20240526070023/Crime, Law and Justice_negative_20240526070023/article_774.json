    "text": "Philip Barbour HS on high alert after gun report, no gun found PHILIPPI, W.Va (WDTV) - The Barbour County Sheriff’s Department confirmed that it was reported that a student had a gun in the school, though no gun was ultimately found. According to [the Barbour County Sheriff’s Department Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/p/Barbour-County-Sheriffs-Department-100064348166053/), the report happened during lunch in the commons, and officials say that because of the quick actions of two teachers, the School Prevention Resource Officer was notified and was able to take the suspect student into custody within less than a minute of the report. The Principal was preparing to go into lockdown until he observed that the suspect was in custody, so no lock down occurred. the suspect and anything he had access to was immediately searched and no type of weapon was found. Investigation into the incident revealed that there was an altercation and this is when it was alleged there was a “gun”. The page went on to ensure the public that although rumors may be spreading about the incident, what was reported are the facts: “As a result of the altercation charges are pending on two Philip Barbour Students along with school action. Furthermore, any time you have a group of 600 people contained in a building the story will grow and rumors will run wild,” they said. “These are the facts to the best of our knowledge. At PBHS safety for the students and staff is our number one goal. Sheriff Brett Carpenter wants to commend the two teachers, school administration, and his Deputy (Prevention Resource Officer) for their quick response”.

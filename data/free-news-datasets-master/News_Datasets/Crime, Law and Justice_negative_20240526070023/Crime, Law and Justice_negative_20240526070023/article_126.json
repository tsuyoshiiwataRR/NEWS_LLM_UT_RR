In an exclusive statement, Andrew Wyatt told RadarOnline.com that the public must look at the \"lack of facts\" and \"ease their personal feelings\" against the actor, 86, and the Hollywood movie producer, 72.\n MEGA The New York Court of Appeals overturned Weinstein's 2020 conviction on sex crimes against three women in a shocking 4-3 opinion on Thursday.\nAs this outlet reported, the New York Court of Appeals overturned Weinstein's 2020 conviction on sex crimes against three women in a shocking 4-3 opinion on Thursday, determining the trial judge \"erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes.\"\nThe court also determined that the accusers' testimonies \"served no material non-propensity purpose\" and \"portrayed\" Weinstein \"in a highly prejudicial light.\"\n Cosby was released in June 2021 after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned his sexual assault conviction.\n Cosby was convicted of sexual assault in 2018 and sentenced to three to 10 years in prison. He was released in June 2021 after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned the ruling, and while the comedian got to walk out of prison a free man, the same can't be said for Weinstein.\nIn 2022, he was also convicted of rape in Los Angeles and sentenced to 16 years. The attorney who put him away in his LA case said he's \"confident\" that the disgraced Hollywood bigwig's conviction for that crime \" will be upheld .\"\n \"The 5th Amendment is an essential tool of our democracy and it’s in place to protect all Citizens of these United Stated, whether rich or poor, from those gatekeepers within the judicial system who misuse their authority, in order to rid Americans of their Due Process,\" Wyatt told RadarOnline.com on Thursday morning.\nMORE ON: Bill Cosby Bill Cosby's Rep Offers Diddy Help After FBI Raids Music Mogul's Homes and Handcuff Sons Bill Cosby, 86, NOT Working on Tell-All Memoir Despite Juicy Rumors About Possible Book Bill Cosby, 86, in 'Good Health' Despite Paranoia That Someone Will 'Kill Him for Fame' MEGA \"\"The public must ease their personal feelings about Mr. Cosby and Mr. Weinstein and look at the lack of facts, evidence and proof, without trying to 'arm chair' quarterback a person’s Constitutional Rights because that’s an injustice for all American Citizens and a disgrace to our democracy,\" said Andrew Wyatt.\n He also urged, \"The public must ease their personal feelings about Mr. Cosby and Mr. Weinstein and look at the lack of facts, evidence and proof, without trying to 'arm chair' quarterback a person’s Constitutional Rights because that’s an injustice for all American Citizens and a disgrace to our democracy.\"\nWyatt charged that the \"only unfortunate part is that Mr. Weinstein will go through another trial and he can't leave his residency at the prison because of being found guilty in LA.\"\n Wyatt's reaction isn't the only one that's rolled in since Weinstein's NY rape conviction was overturned.\nAttorney Lindsay Goldbrum whose client testified about being sexually assaulted by Weinstein during his East Coast criminal trial, told RadarOnline.com the decision \"casts a dark shadow\" on the bravery of the accusers who stood up against him, sharing she fears this will \"deter\" future victims from coming forward.\n MEGA The Manhattan District Attorney's Office revealed its plan to retry Weinstein if alleged victims are willing to come forward again.\n Never miss a story — sign up for the RadarOnline.com newsletter to get your daily dose of dope.

Lonzo Byrant Powers, 55, faces a charge of willful injury-causing serious injury, a Class C felony. Iowa City police were called to the area of Washington and Clinton streets at 9:10 p.m. Wednesday for a report of a fight that ended in a stabbing. Officers found the victim, who had been stabbed multiple times and was taken to a hospital, according to a news release from the Iowa City Police Department and a criminal complaint. The victim was not identified in the complaint or the release. Powers was arrested in relation to the stabbing. He was booked into the Johnson County Jail just after 1 a.m. Thursday. He had an initial appearance in court Thursday and was being held on a $10,000 bail.

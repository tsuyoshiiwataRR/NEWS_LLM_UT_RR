    "text": "AURORA, Colo. (CITC) â€” Parents in a Colorado elementary school are demanding accountability after a registered sex offender allegedly tried to kidnap a child on school grounds. 33-year-old Solomon Galligan was arrested Friday after walking up to multiple students at Black Forest Hills Elementary School. Galligan, a registered sex offender, is accused of attempting to grab a young boy before fleeing school grounds. Staff were alerted to the confrontation once some students began yelling \"stranger danger,\" according to the Cherry Creek School District. Galligan was later caught by police and charged with one count of attempted kidnapping. In a statement Monday, the Cherry Creek School District said it was \"committed to being transparent and accountable to our community\" as it investigated the matter. However, Black Forest Hills parents say Friday's incident has left them \"deeply disturbed\" and questioning the school district's ability to \"ensure our children's safety.\" In a petition started Wednesday, parents are demanding a \"comprehensive review\" of Cherry Creek's response to the incident, as well as of all employees involved. READ MORE | Registered sex offender tried to kidnap child from Colorado elementary school, police say Specific attention should be paid to those who failed to advise the establishment of a secure perimeter or to initiate other critical safety protocols,\" the petition reads. \"This measure is crucial not only to ensure the integrity of the investigation but also to restore confidence in the leadership among parents and students.\" Signees of the petition are also requesting Cherry Creek initiate immediate and recurring audits of the district's security measures, with the results being shared with the community. The petition has received more than 115 signatures as of Thursday afternoon. My daughter was there and she deserves an explanation on why her and her friends' lives were put in danger and the people who are to protect them failed,\" signee Katherine Wilcoxen wrote. One parent who spoke with The Denver Post alleged police were not notified of the incident for nearly an hour, while families were not alerted for an additional 20 minutes. Nicole Jass reportedly also claimed students were not immediately brought inside after the incident occurred. In a letter sent to families Thursday and shared with Crisis in the Classroom (CITC), Black Forest Hills principal Amanda Replogle acknowledged \"the one clear misstep\" the school made last week \"was that the school should have gone into a Secure Status.\" Such a status requires all students be brought inside while security investigates a matter, according to the district. \"I recognize that this has been a traumatic experience for our community. I take the rebuilding of trust with you seriously,\" Replogle wrote. \"This will show up in changes and consistent action from me and my dedicated staff.\" Have something for the Crisis in the Classroom team to investigate? Call or text the national tip line at 202-417-7273.",

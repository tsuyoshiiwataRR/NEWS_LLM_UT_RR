    "text": "By Nikki Hallman ,\n14 days ago\nAfter a devastated future bride shared on her Tik Tok of the surprise closure of Circle B Weddings and Events Venue in Isanti, she realized her and her fiancée would not receive a refund.\nMore couples would come to find the same news about their future weddings when the owners, Wayne and Angela Butt, sent an email explaining the closure on April 21.\nBut someone closer to the venue would also lose out on thousands of dollars: previous employee Kim Sollars.\nSollars didn’t expect the Butts would eventually owe her $28,000 in wages when she met them a year ago.\nShe met the Butts in April 2023 after coming across a Facebook Marketplace ad for banquet chairs they were selling. While making the exchange for the chairs at Circle B, Sollars said Angi asked if she was interested in purchasing the venue as they were selling.\nSollars pondered the idea, so she and her daughter had a dinner with the Butts to discuss Circle B. A few days later she was setting up chairs and working at the venue.\nSollars said Wayne showed her how the couple would go about the business once, and after that they rarely returned to their wedding and event center.\n“They were never there for any of the weddings last year,” she said.\nThe Butts had a ribbon cutting ceremony in April 2023 and a grand opening that May. Meanwhile, Sollars began her job as manager of the venue.\nShe, along with her husband, two sons, daughter and her daughter’s husband, all pitched in, working at Circle B throughout the season.\nSollars said they cleaned the two Airbnbs the Butts owned next door to the venue. They also maintained the yard, cleaned the barn after the wedding, and fixed anything that would break.\nSollars said the couple agreed on paying her $700 per wedding in the barn, $200 per Airbnb every time they were cleaned, $20 per hour per person working the wedding. She did sign a W-2 for the position, but no contract was ever made.\n“They said ‘Just take a tally of everything you have and we’ll take if off the closing costs,’” she said.\nEventually, Sollars realized she was being taken advantage of.\n“I think by August I was like, ‘They haven’t been paying me,’” she said.\nSollars would pay for anything that was needed as the Butts wouldn’t respond properly to her requests about venue needs.\n“I had about $6,000 of my personal property, all over — including one of my commercial freezers,” Sollars said.\nWhen these issues began, she was in the middle of moving around her finances to prepare for purchasing the business, making her feel more connected and dedicated to the venue. As a result, Sollars couldn’t leave, despite the wrong actions that were occurring.\n“I feel like I needed to show up or the brides couldn’t get in,” she said.\nSollars said she told the Butts that they needed to pay her some amount of money to prove she was on their payroll and that’s when the one and only time she received money.\nThey gave her $4,000 worth of cleaning wages. But no hourly pay.\nSollars said while she was in the process of getting the financials together, the businesses profit shown in the projections was too low for her bank to approve any loan.\nThis led Sollars to start booking weddings and events for what she thought would be her future business. She put 17 more weddings on the schedule.\n“I was sustained (financially) until October of this year with utilities mortgage and everything,” she said.\nThe projections finally showed a positive direction, allowing for purchase agreements to be written up toward the end of last summer.\nAccording to Sollars, a purchase price of $2.7 million was agreed upon for the barn and the land behind it, before the season was over.\nSollars worked from the beginning of May through October 2023. The Butts attempted to renegotiate at the last minute, asking for $2.9 million, but Sollars attorney advised her to stick with the original price.\nOn Oct. 28, the Butts wanted to go over the sale, asking Sollars to discuss paperwork. But what Sollars didn’t know was that she was being fired and escorted off the property by police.\n“All the sudden they go, ‘You’re done. We don’t need you anymore. Give us your files and do not step foot on our property again,’” she said.\nAt this time, Sollars knew she had the Butts’ lawn mower at her home for maintenance, and she also had her own property at the venue. They wouldn’t allow her gather her property before leaving.\nA week later, things got even worse.\nThe Butts had Sollars arrested for wrongful possession after she had already returned their lawn mower and before she had her property returned.\nSollars said they called on Nov. 4 and gave her until 5 p.m. to return their lawn mower. While her husband was on his way back home from returning it, that’s when she received the surprise.\n“A cop shows up at my house and says, ‘Kim, I’m arresting you,’” she said.\nSollars said she had photo proof that her husband returned the lawn mower, but that wasn’t enough to change their minds.\nBecause it was over the weekend, Sollars spent two nights in jail. She now has a no-contact order.\n“I’m still not cleared, but they have nothing, so my attorney has nothing,” she said. “For them to do this to me, it really took my innocence away.”\nAt this time, Sollars still hadn’t received her property or any pay for her labor.\nHer attorney sent one letter for wages and one letter for her property owed. Sollars received her property — three months later — but still no pay.\n“Why did they hold (the property) for three months? No clue. Why could they get away with it? No clue.”\nAs the manager of the venue and future owner, Sollars kept track of the events, including the day they were to be held, the date of the contracts, how much they paid, and when they paid.\nThis was how she was able to see that business wasn’t going as planned. But that was not because they weren’t receiving business.\n“There was no financial hardship. No, it’s not that — they took the money and ran,” Sollars said.\nShe explained that even after the Butts fired her, they booked four more weddings, providing additional income that would cover her labor costs.\n“They could have easily paid me back my $28,000 and come clean and faithfully gone through their day about other things,” Sollars said.\nSollars mentioned other costs such as past due bills that would arrive in the mail. She had to hand deliver the mail to the Butt’s other business, Falcon Ridge Golf Course in Stacy, as they wouldn’t ever make an appearance at Circle B to pick it up.\nSollars believes there’s a chance the Butts were trying to plan for missed payments on large loans that they previously had a six-month deferment gap on.\n“Have they even made a payment to the bank? I don’t know,” she said.\nAccording to Sollars, there were two loans the Butts took out for the business, one for over $2 million, another for over $800,000. These first payments were due in August 2023, and that’s when the couple started to press her on purchasing the business, in which an agreement wasn’t quite yet made.\n“They would be like, ‘When are you buying it? When are you buying it?’ And then they would get mean,” she said.\nSollars had all of this information as her bank need the financial details and projections before approving her to move forward with an offer.\nShe was able to find a total of $218,000 has been collected for events that are no longer are taking place at Circle B, due to the closure..\nTwo business planned events were not included in the loss of funds.\nWhen it comes to fighting back legally, Sollars is not one to press an issue like this.\n“I’ve had rose colored glasses on 100% of my lifetime,” she said. “I don’t know how to go about it to be honest.\n“The likelihood of me getting it (her wages back) — I don’t know.”\nSollars said she can’t go to small claims court as the amount she’s owed is too much.\nDespite all that she’s experienced over the last year, Sollars’ mind hasn’t changed about purchasing the business.\n“Call me crazy, but yes,” she said. “I was there from the moment I opened up the wedding until they went home.\n“It was really fun.”\nSollars can’t confirm if the business is for sale as it’s been listed and then taken off the market. She hasn’t seen bankruptcy paperwork filed and she’s even reached out to their lawyer, Ryan Kaess, who isn’t providing any information either.\nSollars will fight for the venue she wants to call her ‘legacy,’ as she’s brought her family there and worked hard to make successful.\n“I know the place better than Angi and Wayne,” she said.\nIf Sollars could get into the venue and continue this wedding season, she said she would.\n“I would get back in there and give them the wedding they deserve,” she said.",

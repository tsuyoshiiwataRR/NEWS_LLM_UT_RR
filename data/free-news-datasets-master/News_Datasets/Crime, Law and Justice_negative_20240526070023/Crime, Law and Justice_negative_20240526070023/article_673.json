    "text": "Second arrest revealed in deadly Hanover party shooting The sheriff’s office says they charged Jayvian Marrece Threatt, 18, of Petersburg, with attempted murder. HANOVER, Va. (WWBT) -The Hanover County Sheriff’s Office has released the name of a second suspect they’ve charged in connection with the fallout from a deadly party. The sheriff’s office says they’ve arrested and charged Jayvian Marrece Threatt, 18, of Petersburg, with attempted murder. Investigators say that charge and a second-degree gun charge are for shooting at James Smith. Smith, 18, of Ashland, was arrested on Tuesday, April 23 and charged with the murder of Matthew Devine, 16, of Colonial Heights. He’s now behind bars. On April 6, just after 10:45 p.m., sheriff’s deputies responded to the 6000 block of McClellan Road for a parking complaint related to a large party. When they arrived, deputies were made aware of a shooting and found Devine dead. Deputies also tell 12 On Your Side that Threatt arrived at the party with Devine. The sheriff’s office said Threatt was arrested on April 14. They say they first held off on identifying him “to avoid jeopardizing the ongoing investigation.” 12 On Your Side is also learning what may have happened the night Matthew was killed. According to search warrants from Hanover Circuit Court, Matthew Devine attended the party with a friend. We learned from his family his older brother was also with him. Court documents say Matthew bumped into an unknown suspect, now known to be Smith. Words were exchanged, and then Smith allegedly flashed a gun at Matthew. Documents say Matthew was also carrying a weapon and followed Smith outside. The two met in the driveway of the home where the party was happening. Shots were fired, Matthew was hit in the chest, and Smith ran away. “I don’t know too much. I know the detectives said he may have had a weapon on him,” Ashley Devine, Matthew’s mom, said, “Like I said, I am not trying to make this ordeal like Matthew was a saint by no means.” Right now, it’s unclear how many people were in the driveway with Smith, Devine and Threatt. Devine says she got the call from her other son at 10:59 p.m. that Matthew had been shot, not long after Matthew died in his brother’s arms. “What I am saying is that Matthew did not deserve to get murdered the way he did,” Ashley said. According to the search warrant, deputies did not find any guns in the immediate area, and a weapon was not found on Matthew’s person. “Per the law officers, he did not fire the firearm. That part is very important to me,” said Devine. The Hanover Sheriff’s office confirmed with 12 On Your Side there is no evidence that Matthew fired a gun. Officials say this case is still “very much active.” Anyone with information can call Sergeant Thomas Claytor with the Hanover County Sheriff’s Office at (804) 839-2854 or the Metro Richmond Crime Stoppers at (804) 780-1000.

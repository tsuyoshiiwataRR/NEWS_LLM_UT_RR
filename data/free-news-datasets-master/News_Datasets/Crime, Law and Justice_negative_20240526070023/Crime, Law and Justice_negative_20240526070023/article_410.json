    "text": "A 15-year-old driver will be charged as an adult in connection to the fatal Hialeah crash that left two women dead and sent another to the hospital.\nMaykoll Santiesteban is facing multiple charges, including two counts of vehicular manslaughter and three counts of driving without a license.\n“State Attorney’s Office has decided to charge Maykoll Santiesteban with two counts of vehicular manslaughter, that’s vehicular homicide, and three counts of driving without a license causing death or bodily injury,” said Hialeah Police Lt. Eddie Rodriguez.\nSeconds before Tuesday night’s crash, police said, the teen was speeding in his father’s Nissan car.\n“The black box shows that, just two seconds prior to impact, he was traveling at 83 miles an hour in a zone where it was only for 30 miles an hour,” said Rodriguez.\nThe crash occurred near Southeast Fourth Street and Fifth Avenue, at around 8 p.m.\nDetectives said the teen took his father’s car out for a joyride with two 15-year-old friends.\nPolice have confirmed the identities of the adults in the other vehicle.\nYarnia Garcia Hernandez, 39, was in the car with her aunt, 71-year-old Gloria Hernandez. Both died as a result of the crash. They were riding in the front.\nSantiesteban was traveling southbound at high rates of speed with no stop sign. According to reports, the teen said Hernandez did not stop.\nBut police said video obtained by them shows that Hernandez did stop at a stop sign and did not run it.\n“In the video, it does clearly show that they stopped at the stop sign for more than a second, but either way, the vehicle that is traveling southbound is the vehicle that has the right of way. After stopping, she proceeds to go forward, and that’s when the impact occurred,” said Rodriguez.\nYaima Pimineta, a neighbor who ran to the scene to help the three woman in the car, said she heard an explosion.\n“Something exploded, I don’t know,” said Pimineta. “I felt it. It was traumatic, I couldn’t sleep.”\nHernandez’s mother, 65-year-old Liliana Hernandez Molina, remains in critical condition at Jackson Memorial Hospital Ryder Trauma Center.\nTwo other teens were in the car with the teen driver. Their information has not been released.\nInvestigators said there could be fault on both sides, but that is under investigation.\nPolice said Santiesteban could face up to 45 years in jail.",

    "text": "WILLINGBORO, N.J. – Yesterday, Congressman Andy Kim (NJ-03) hosted his 74th town hall as a telephone town hall to share updates about his work in Congress and hear from neighbors about issues important to them.\nCongressman Kim began the town hall by expressing his condolences about the passing of his colleague, Congressman Donald M. Payne, Jr. (NJ-10), a dedicated public servant for all of New Jersey.\nDuring his town hall, Congressman Kim was joined by Suzanne Buchanan, Executive Director of Autism New Jersey, to help recognize Autism Awareness and Acceptance Month and speak about how to best support those with autism across New Jersey with resources and direct assistance. He was also joined by Phil Echevarria, Director of Government Relations at The Nature Conservancy, to discuss the value of Earth Day and the importance of continued action to protect our environment and build a greener, safer, and more climate resilient future.\nHe also answered questions from callers about housing affordability, his work to prevent veteran homelessness, and invest in local shelters, including $3 million he secured to construct a non-congregate shelter in Burlington County, dispelling hate and violence targeting Asian Americans, and improving public transportation options across the state to reduce New Jersey’s environmental footprint and help combat climate change.\nTo sign up for more updates from Congressman Kim, including the location and time of his next town hall, click here.\n House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. here .\n###",

    "text": "In a shocking incident that has captured national attention, Ahmed Alid, a 45-year-old asylum seeker from Morocco, was convicted on Thursday for the murder of 70-year-old Terence Carney in Hartlepool, a seaside town in England. The conviction comes in the wake of a brutal attack that occurred on October 15, just days after the onset of the Israel-Hamas war triggered by a Hamas attack on October 7.\nAlid&apos;s violent spree began with him stabbing Carney six times in a public area of Hartlepool, shortly after attacking a sleeping housemate, Javed Nouri. During both assaults, Alid reportedly shouted \"Allahu Akbar,\" an Arabic phrase meaning \"God is great.\" The motivation behind these heinous acts, as stated by Alid to the police, was in retaliation for the people of Gaza, following the recent conflict between Hamas militants and Israel.\nThe court at Teesside Crown Court heard that Alid had expressed a desire to kill more people if he had access to more lethal weaponry. This statement was part of the evidence presented by prosecutor Jonathan Sandiford. In addition to the murder charge, Alid was also found guilty of attempted murder for his attack on Nouri, his housemate. The attack on Nouri was reportedly motivated by Alid&apos;s displeasure towards Nouri&apos;s conversion to Christianity.\nTestimonies from other housemates revealed that Alid&apos;s behavior became increasingly erratic after watching television coverage of the Hamas attacks and Israel&apos;s bombing of Gaza. Nouri recounted to the police how Alid would laugh and praise God upon seeing footage of Hamas killings, which deeply disturbed him.\nDespite complaints to housing officials, the Home Office, and the police about Alid&apos;s behavior and threats, it was only after the attacks that significant action was taken. During his police interview, Alid justified his actions by blaming Britain for its role in creating the state of Israel and equating his murder of an elderly man to Israel&apos;s military actions in Gaza.\nThe situation escalated during his interview when Alid attacked two female detectives. An attempt to use a panic button failed due to malfunction, leading to intervention only after an emergency call was made by Alid&apos;s defense lawyer. This incident led to additional convictions for assaulting the officers.\nDespite acknowledging the stabbings, Alid denied any intent to kill or cause serious harm. His sentencing is scheduled for May 17, concluding a case that has highlighted not only the individual tragedy but also broader issues of radicalization and community safety.\nSathish Raman Oneindia",

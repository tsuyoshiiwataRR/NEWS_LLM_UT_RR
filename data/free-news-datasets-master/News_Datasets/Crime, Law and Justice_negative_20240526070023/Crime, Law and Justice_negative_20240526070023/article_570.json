    "text": "Halton police are looking for three suspects following an alleged act of arson outside an Oakville grocery store on Wednesday, April 24.\nAt around 2 a.m., three people attended the Whole Foods Market at 301 Cornwall Rd. and set fire to material inside an industrial-sized recycling bin outside the store, said Const. Jeff Dillon, Halton Regional Police Service media officer.\nThe fire reportedly spread to adjacent bins; however, the Oakville Fire Department was called to the scene and extinguished the blaze before it could spread any further.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Police said eight to 10 recycling bins were damaged by the flames, with the damage costs estimated at around $800.\nThe suspects could only be described as two males and one female, all of whom wore dark clothing.\nAnyone with information relevant to this investigation is asked to contact Halton police at 905-825-4777 .\nTips can also be submitted anonymously to Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477) or through the web at www.haltoncrimestoppers.ca .",

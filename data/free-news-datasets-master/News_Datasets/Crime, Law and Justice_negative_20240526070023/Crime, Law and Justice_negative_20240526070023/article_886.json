    "text": "Former LSU Tigers star [Angel Reese](https://www.totalprosports.com/tag/angel-reese/) went #7 overall in last week’s [WNBA](https://www.totalprosports.com/wnba/) draft to the Chicago Sky, and she wasted little time making her first purchase to ride the streets in as her professional career gets ready to kick off. Starting a new life in Chicago means getting a new ride to cruise around town, which is why the former named Bayou Barbie has purchased a new Mercedes Benz after giving up her old vehicle. She uploaded a picture of her old car on Instagram with the caption: “BYE BYE TO MY FIRST EVER BABY,” Angel Reese wrote. “BUT ITS TIME TO UPGRADE YA TO THE BIG BARBI ” Angel Reese, who became one of the faces of the NIL, unveiled her AMG G-Class SUV in a post on her Instagram Story while in Illinois this week. According to [Mercedes-Benz](https://www.mbusa.com/en/vehicles/class/g-class/suv/type-amg), the luxurious car with a red inside made of Nappa leather and black rims starts at $183,000.

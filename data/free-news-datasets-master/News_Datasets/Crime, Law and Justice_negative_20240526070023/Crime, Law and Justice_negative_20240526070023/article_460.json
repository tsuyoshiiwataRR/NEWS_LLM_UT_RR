    "text": "New Haven resident Tyjon Preston pleaded guilty to a racketeering offense related to his role in the violent Exit 8 street gang within the city, the US Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut announced on Thursday, April 25.\nAccording to federal officials, Preston's guilty plea followed an effort to address violence in New Haven that involved an investigation into an ongoing gang war between members and associates of the Exit 8 street gang and rival gangs in the city's Hill section.\nThe investigation determined that members of the Exit 8 gang, named after the geographic area by Exit 8 of Interstate 91 in New Haven, engaged in drug trafficking, used and shared guns, and committed at least three murders and 16 attempted murders since June 2018. Gang members would also steal vehicles, sometimes from outside of Connecticut, and use them when committing acts of violence, officials said.\nOne of these alleged incidents happened in August 2020, when Preston helped steal a Cadillac Escalade from a Westport driveway on Richmondville Avenue. He was later arrested following a police pursuit, according to Westport Police.\nOn Wednesday, April 24, Preston pleaded guilty to conspiracy to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity and admitted to his role in:\n- Attempting to kill a rival gang member and shooting him in the leg with other Exit 8 members on April 27, 2021;\n- Conspiring to kill rival gang members with other Exit 8 members, including one who was shot and killed on May 19, 2021, by another member;\n- Shooting and attempting to kill rival gang members with other Exit 8 members on May 20, 2021;\n- Shooting and killing a 22-year-old woman on July 5, 2021, after she made a rap song with derogatory comments about Exit 8.\nWhen he is sentenced, Preston faces a maximum term of life in prison. Under the terms of a binding plea deal though, all parties have agreed that a sentence of between 22 and 30 years is appropriate if accepted by the court.\nPreston has been in prison since May 22, 2021.\n[Click here]\nto follow Daily Voice\nNew Haven\nand receive free news updates.",

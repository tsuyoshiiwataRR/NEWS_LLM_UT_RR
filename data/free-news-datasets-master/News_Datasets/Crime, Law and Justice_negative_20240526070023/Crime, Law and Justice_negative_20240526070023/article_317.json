    "text": "JACKSON COUNTY, W.Va. (WCHS) — A Jackson County, West Virginia, teacher’s aide was charged after she was accused of dragging a young student across a floor and using excessive force, court records said. Nicole Lea Lupardus, 43, is charged with battery after an incident Monday, April 15, at Ripley Elementary Learning Center, according to a criminal complaint filed in Jackson County Magistrate Court. Lupardus is accused of dragging a 5-year-old student across the floor and physically picking them up and putting them in a seat. She is also accused of physically pushing the child against a table. The alleged incidents were recorded on surveillance video, the complaint said. Officers said they learned of the alleged incident after multiple faculty members contacted the county’s Shield Program coordinator. [The program was launched in 2022](https://wchstv.com/news/crisis-in-the-classroom/jackson-county-making-safety-a-priority-in-schools-through-new-program#) as an attempt to increase safety in schools. Witnesses told investigators they believed the incident could have injured the child. The child’s parents did not report any injuries, the complaint said.",

    "text": "NORRISTOWN — A Norristown man, who authorities alleged was speeding at the time of a two-vehicle crash that killed a woman in the second vehicle, is facing vehicular homicide and manslaughter charges. Adan Ortiz-Gonzalez, 18, of the 400 block of East Marshall Street, was arraigned before District Court Judge Marc Alfarano on charges of homicide by vehicle, involuntary manslaughter, recklessly endangering another person, speeding and reckless and careless driving in connection with the Feb. 26, 2024, two vehicle crash at DeKalb and East Brown streets that killed the second driver, 37-year-old Katty Campos, of Ambler. Ortiz-Gonzalez remains free on $50,000 unsecured bail while awaiting a May 3 preliminary hearing on the charges before District Court Judge Todd N. Barnes. Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin R. Steele and Norristown Police Chief Jacqueline Bailey-Davis announced the arrest of Ortiz-Gonzalez on Thursday. The investigation began about 10:51 a.m. Feb. 26, when Norristown police responded to the intersection of DeKalb and East Brown streets for a report of a two-vehicle crash with entrapment, according to a criminal complaint filed by county Detective David Schanes and Norristown Detective William Klinger. The crash involved a 2004 Nissan Armada SUV operated by Ortiz-Gonzalez and a 2021 Nissan Sentra operated by Campos. Arriving officers found Campos trapped and unresponsive in her vehicle. Campos was pronounced dead at the scene. Ortiz-Gonzalez and three juveniles who were passengers in his vehicle were transported to a hospital for treatment of unspecified injuries. The investigation determined that Ortiz-Gonzalez was traveling northbound on DeKalb Street at 60 mph in an area posted 25 mph and Campos was traveling eastbound on East Brown Street approaching a stop sign. “Campos slowed down but did not completely stop. Campos then pulled out onto DeKalb Street into the path of Ortiz-Gonzalez,” Schanes and Klinger alleged, adding the Armada operated by Ortiz-Gonzalez struck the Sentra operated by Campos on the passenger side. The Armada struck the Sentra with such force that it pushed the Sentra 50-feet across the intersection and off the road, detectives alleged. “The Sentra was pushed into a tree on the driver’s side,” Schanes and Klinger alleged. “The Sentra sustained heavy damage and intrusion into the passenger compartment.” An autopsy determined Campos died from “multiple blunt impact injuries” and the manner of death was ruled “accident,” according to the arrest affidavit. Detectives used surveillance camera footage that recorded the crash to assist in making speed determinations, court papers indicate. Detectives alleged that an analysis of the evidence determined that the Sentra would have cleared the intersection had Ortiz-Gonzalez been driving at the posted 25-mph speed limit, and the crash would not have occurred. Ortiz-Gonzalez, detectives alleged, “operated this vehicle in a reckless manner, at a high rate of speed causing the fatal crash.” None of the four occupants in the Armada operated by Ortiz-Gonzalez was wearing a seatbelt, detectives added.",

If it matches the expected value for a media file accessed through the comment page, then return the file content. If not, then show a banner first asking to go to the comment page.\nGitHub comments used to distribute malware (BleepingComputer)\nPosted Apr 25, 2024 16:24 UTC (Thu) by Heretic_Blacksheep (subscriber, #169992)\n[\n[Link](/Articles/971188/)]\nPerhaps don't allow direct links to files that aren't part of the repository itself. Single use hash file ID that is generated each time the file is displayed might be a way to do this without revealing the direct file link. Perhaps I just need to set my disused account to private, if that would fix the problem in as far as I'm concerned. I can't fix Github itself, but I can at least potentially cover my tiny base as well as can be.",

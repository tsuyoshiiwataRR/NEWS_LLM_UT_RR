    "text": "The man\naccused of beating a Dauphin County man to death in an illegal stripclub in Steelton Borough has been arrested in York County on unrelated charges, according to police.\nKier Sims, 33, had been on the run for a month after the death of Otilio Lugo-Rivera on 159 N. Front St. in Steelton when U.S. Marshals caught up with him Thursday and took him into custody.\nSims and Lugo-Rivera were involved in an altercation early March 23 that resulted in Sims punching Lugo-Rivera in the head, causing blunt force injuries that later killed the man, at The Hideout in Steelton.\nThe Hideout is a venue where Nathan May, under the nightlife entertainment name “Dante Labron,”\nran adult cabaret-style events without a permit from the borough. Even had he applied for the permit, the building was located in the wrong zone of the borough.\nMay’s landlord, Hernan Paredes, has been\ntrying to evict May for more than a year amid a back-and-forth landlord-tenant case.\nSims will remain in York County to resolve his charges there before being transferred to Dauphin County Prison to face a charge of criminal homicide, according to Steelton Borough Police Chief William Shaub.\nEyewitnesses told investigators that Sims got in Lugo-Rivera’s face and started the fight. The pair were eventually separated, but afterward, Sims approached Lugo-Rivera and “struck him in the head with great force. This caused Lugo-Rivera’s head to strike a wall with great force,” the Dauphin County District Attorney’s Office said.\nLugo-Rivera fell to the floor and his face turned blue, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The affidavit said Steelton police found Lugo-Rivera lying unresponsive on the floor of The Hideout while bystanders performed CPR.\nPolice were called to the scene at 5:35 a.m.\nAn autopsy found Lugo-Rivera suffered significant trauma to two portions of his brain. The injuries were consistent with the way witnesses said the fight transpired, the affidavit said. The Dauphin County Coroner’s Office on Thursday, however, told PennLive Lugo-Rivera’s official cause and manner of death are still pending additional investigation.\n©2024 Advance Local Media LLC.

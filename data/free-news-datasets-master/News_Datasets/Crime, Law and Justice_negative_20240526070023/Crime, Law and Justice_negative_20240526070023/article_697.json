    "text": "HELSINKI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Finnish government has this week implemented an action plan to curb youth crime, with violence by children under 15 increasing by 300 percent between 2015 and 2021.\nMinister of Justice Leena Meri told a press conference on Thursday that membership of a gang and violence on social media will now be considered grounds for punishment as aggravated crimes.\nWhile a youth punishment code already exists in Finland, it has not been widely used so far. A youth may not consider a suspended sentence without probation control a punishment at all, Meri said.\nPeople under 15 do not have criminal responsibility in Finland, and cannot be detained or sentenced. Recently, a school shooting carried out by a 12-year-old shocked the nation.\nVille Hinkkanen, director general at the Division for Criminal Law and Policy at the Ministry of Justice, said that the action program would focus on crime suspects and risk groups.\nThe government will investigate a legal framework for briefly detaining suspects aged under 15, or imposing a travel ban on such children.\nA rehabilitation program for minors, to be arranged in closed institutions, is also being developed. â– \nEXPLORE XINHUANET News In-depth Sports Business Culture World China Regions Asia & Pacific Europe Middle East North America South America Africa Organizations Services Weather Live in China Work in China Doing Business Investment Emergency Visit China Study in China More Special Reports Photos Video Corrections About us Contact Us Media Qiushi Journal Taiwan.cn Youth.cn GMW.cn CE.cn Ecns.cn China Daily CRI.cn China.org.cn People's Daily",

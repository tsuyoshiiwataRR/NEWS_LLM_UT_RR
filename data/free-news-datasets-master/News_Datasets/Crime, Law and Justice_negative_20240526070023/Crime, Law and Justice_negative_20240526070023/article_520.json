Trump denies Daniels' claim and that he broke any laws.\nThe jury saw texts between Pecker and Dylan Howard, the editor in chief at the National Enquirer at the time. Pecker said Howard was unable to travel for the trial, but Thursday's testimony provided insight about what the publication thought about Daniels' story.\nTrump trial live updates: David Pecker testifies about contract with Karen McDougal\n'This story is true:' Dylan Howard texted David Pecker about Stormy Daniels Howard texted Pecker that a woman wanted $120,000 for her story, according to texts shown to the jury at Trump's hush money trial.\nPecker testified the woman he was referencing was Stormy Daniels.\n\"I know the denials were made in the past â€“ but this story is true,\" Howard's texts shown to the jurors said, adding that the woman had other offers from \"Mail\" and \"GMA.\"\nPecker testified he refused to buy Stormy Daniels' story Pecker said he refused to buy Stormy Daniels' story. He texted Dylan Howard: \"We can't pay 120k.\" Pecker explained on the stand that he was not a bank and had already paid hush money to Dino Sajudin and Karen McDougal to help Trump.\nSajudin was a doorman at Trump Tower who alleged Trump had a love child with a housekeeper in the building. Pecker testified Tuesday that he did not believe Sajudin's story.\nPecker also said he didn't want to be involved with a porn star.\n\"Perhaps I call Michael and advise him and he can take it from there, and handle,\" Howard responded to Pecker, referring to Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, according to text messages displayed to the jury.\nAfter Pecker refused to buy Stormy Daniels' story, Cohen was upset and told Pecker the boss \"would be furious with me,\" Pecker testified. Pecker still insisted he wouldn't go forward with purchasing it.\nNY court will publish transcripts from Trump's hush money trial. Here's how you can access them. What happens if Trump is found guilty in hush money case? Prison is certainly an option. Trump to receive 36 million additional shares of Truth Social parent company, worth $1.17 billion Trump trial Day 6 recap: National Enquirer's David Pecker testifies on killing stories National Enquirer editor said Stormy Daniels' affair story was true: Texts shown to jury Who is Stormy Daniels? Stormy Daniels , born Stephanie Clifford, is an adult film star.\nDaniels claims she had an affair with Trump in 2006, months after Melania Trump gave birth to Barron Trump. Cohen paid her $130,000 to stay quiet about the alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump's subsequent reimbursement of Cohen, which he listed as legal expenses, is at the heart of prosecutors' allegation that the payments constituted an illegal campaign contribution by Cohen that Trump tried to hide by falsifying records.\nWho is David Pecker? David Pecker , former CEO and president of American Media Inc., is the first witness on the stand at Trump's Manhattan criminal trial .\nPecker has testified that he was frequently in touch with Michael Cohen leading up to the 2016 election. Pecker said he promised to be \"eyes and ears\" about women selling stories about Trump, as part of a bigger effort to try to help his presidential campaign.\nThe company was also fined $187,500 by the FEC for helping Trump's election, but the Justice Department granted Pecker immunity from prosecution.\nContributing: Bart Jansen",

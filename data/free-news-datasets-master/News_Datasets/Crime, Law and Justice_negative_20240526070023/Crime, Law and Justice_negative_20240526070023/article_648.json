    "text": "Entertainment Sports Tiger Woods' Son Charlie, 15, Following in His Dad's Footsteps and Attempting to Qualify for U.S. Open Charlie Woods had a previous unsuccessful attempt to qualify for the Cognizant Classic back in February By Danielle Jennings Published on April 25, 2024 05:17PM EDT Close Charlie Woods and Tiger Woods. Photo: David Cannon/Getty Many parents dream of the day when their children will follow along in their footsteps — and golf legend Tiger Woods can officially count himself among them as his 15-year-old son Charlie attempts to qualify for this year’s U.S. Open. Charlie Woods, who had a previous unsuccessful attempt to qualify for the Cognizant Classic back in February, will further his U.S. Open aspirations by competing in an 18-hole in Port St. Lucie, Florida, on Thursday, April 25, according to Sports Illustrated. Charlie has seen success, though, in other pro arenas. He has competed alongside his father at the 2020, 2021 and 2022 annual PNC Championships — a tournament in which professional golfers team up with their children. \"Tiger loves spending time with Charlie on the golf course,” a source told PEOPLE in 2020. Following the father-son duo’s first tournament together in 2020, Tiger told reporters. \"Just the fact that we were able to have this experience together, Charlie and I, it's memories for a lifetime.\" 16 Photos of Tiger Woods & His Son Charlie Competing in Their First Golf Tournament Together Tiger and Charlie Woods playing in 2022. Mike Ehrmann/Getty Tiger previously told ESPN that, \"Any time I get a chance to spend time with my son, it’s always special. And to do it in a competitive forum, the last couple of years have been magical, and to be able to do it again, we're looking forward to it.\" And Charlie is racking up wins at the high school level — his North Palm Beach, Florida school won the Class 1A golf title back in November. Tiger and his ex-wife Elin Nordegren were proud parents to Charlie when he and the team at The Benjamin School received their championship rings in March. During an interview with PGA, Tiger explained that he is proud of his son no matter what. \"I'm proud of whatever direction he chooses, whether he sticks with the game or not,\" he said.

    "text": "FTC Finalizes Ban on Non-Compete Agreements\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a final rule on April 23 banning non-compete agreements nationwide. There are exceptions to the ban, including nonprofits, which fall outside the agency’s purview, and current senior executives in “policymaking roles” making more than $151,164 annually.\nThis rule is expected to have a significant impact on health care as many clinicians in the U.S. are contractually bound by non-compete agreements. According to the FTC, banning non-competes will result in reduced health care costs – specifically an estimated $74-$194 billion reduction in spending on physician services over the next decade.\nThe ACC\nsubmitted written comments to the agency last year, noting that a majority of cardiologists are subject to non-negotiable non-compete clauses. The ACC will continue to monitor this issue as the final rule is contested by legal challenges. For more information on the final rule, access the FTC press release and fact sheet.\nIn addition, the ACC and its Chapters continue to engage lawmakers at the state level on this issue. Most recently, ACC members have advocated against non-compete agreements in Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota and New York for either comprehensive bans or tailored legislation specific to the health care industry. The ACC Advocacy team anticipates more states will take up legislation as it appears unclear if the FTC nationwide ban will hold up in court. ACC members can contact on the ACC’s State Government Affairs team to learn how they can get involved.\nKeywords: Health Care Costs, Delivery of Health Care, Cardiologists, Health Care Sector, United States Federal Trade Commission, ACC Advocacy\n[< Back to Listings](#)",

    "text": "HILLSBORO, Ore. (KATU) — A Hillsboro man was convicted on robbery charges last Thursday, according to the Washington County District Attorney's Office. Officials found Cristian Michael Abarca guilty of two counts of first-degree robbery. On Aug. 12, 2022, two brothers parked in front of a convenience store near Southeast 10th Ave and Southeast Baseline. When the driver got out to go inside Abarca approached and got into the car with a large fixed-blade knife. Abarca then threatened the brother in the passenger seat, the man was able to get out of the car. After, Abarca drove off in the car which contained the victims' paycheck and a phone. These items were recovered when the brothers spotted their car abandoned nearby, police say. At the time no one knew who the robber was. On Sept. 22, 2022, Abarca approached a man getting off the bus carrying groceries on a bus near the same convenience store where the first incident first occurred. According to officials, Abarca pulled a large, fixed-blade knife out of his sock and threatened to stab the victim if he didn’t hand over his phone and wallet. Police say the victim gave the defendant his wallet and all the groceries he had just purchased. Police say Abarca left the area on foot while the victim ran to the Hillsboro police station and reported the robbery. Police immediately searched the area. They quickly found and arrested the suspect. According to Hillsboro police, he had the victim's wallet along with two fixed-blade knives. Investigators later linked DNA evidence found on the steering wheel from the stolen car incident to the defendant and determined he had committed both robberies. While in detention at the Washington County Jail, the defendant assaulted two inmates in separate, unprovoked incidents. These actions, together with other factors include the defendant’s prior failure on domestic violence probation. Abarca was sentenced to 150 months in prison. Abarca will be transferred to the Oregon Department of Corrections to begin serving his sentence.",

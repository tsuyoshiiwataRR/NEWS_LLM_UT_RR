    "text": "CP NewsAlert: Bill would give Alberta power to fire municipal councillors, nix bylaws\nPosted April 25, 2024 4:52 pm.\nLast Updated April 25, 2024 4:56 pm.\nEDMONTON — The Alberta government has introduced a bill that would grant it sweeping powers over municipalities, including the right to fire councillors, overturn bylaws and postpone elections.\nThe proposed law would also allow political parties to run on municipal ballots in Edmonton and Calgary.\nMunicipal Affairs Minster Ric McIver says the new powers are justified to ensure fair elections and accountability from municipal leaders.\nHe says the powers would only be used as a last resort.\nThe provincial government’s authority over local bylaws was previously limited to land-use and, more recently, public masking and vaccinations.\nTwo weeks ago, Premier Danielle Smith’s government introduced a bill that would give it the power to veto any deal between the federal government and provincial entities, including municipalities and post-secondary schools.\nMore coming.\nThe Canadian Press",

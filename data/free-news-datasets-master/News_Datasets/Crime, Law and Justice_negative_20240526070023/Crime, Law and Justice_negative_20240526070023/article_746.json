    "text": "OZARK-An Ozark man is seeking damages against the city on multiple claims, including a violation of his civil rights. Bryant Louis Fontenot is seeking $3 million from the city of Ozark for “false imprisonment, negligence, false arrest, outrage abuse of process, malicious prosecution, emotional distress, humiliation, loss of enjoyment of life, pain, suffering, and violations of my civil rights,” according to a notarized affidavit sent from Fontenot and his attorney Andrew Scarborough to the Dale County seat. The written communication from Fontenot has been received by the city, City of Ozark Attorney Joe W. Adams confirmed Thursday. The city declines comment on the matter at this time, he said. The demand for $3 million comes on the heels of a municipal court case filed against Fontenot by the city on behalf of Ozark Mayor Mark Blankenship, charging harassment in connection with a dialogue between the two men outside of the city municipal building after a Jan. 2 city council meeting. People are also reading… When Fontenot responded to the harassment charge with a request for a trial, the Ozark City Council unanimously approved the hiring of a specially appointed judge and prosecutor to hear the matter after being told that the municipal attorneys had recused themselves. At the day-long trial before specially appointed Municipal Judge Barbara Wade of Daleville held in the municipal courtroom at Ozark City Hall Feb. 7, specially appointed prosecutor Rick Hollingsworth Jr. of Enterprise represented the city of Ozark. In a written judgement dated Feb. 15, Wade dismissed the case against Fontenot and granted his motion for acquittal, citing lack of evidence on the part of the city’s witnesses — including some city employees and police officers — that harassment had occurred. In his April 18 affidavit sent to the city, Fontenot reiterated what had been testified to in municipal court, including his reaction to news of the charges against him. “On Jan. 5, I was contacted by the Ozark Police Department and informed that I had a warrant for my arrest and that I should turn myself into authorities,” Fontenot said in the affidavit. “This was a shock to me. I have had no such encounters with the law and being advised that I now have a warrant out for my arrest, a sense of shame came upon me that lasted until my case was resolved with my full and absolute acquittal.” The retired Army Chief Warrant Officer 5 with 23 years of military service said that when he turned himself into the city magistrate, he was advised that “my freedom to travel was now suspended and my freedom as to whom I may or not speak was restricted,” and “Due to being arrested, I was forced to obtain legal representation.” Citing the Civil Rights Act of 1871, the affidavit serves as notice to the city that Fontenot intends to pursue the matter in the legal system.",

    "text": "NJ middle school teacher charged with sexually assaulting student [Mike Deak](/staff/4395507002/mike-deak/) A teacher at Carteret Middle School has been charged with sexually assaulting one of his students in 2022. Jeffrey Munguia, 32, of North Bergen, was arrested Wednesday and charged with second-degree sexual assault and second-degree endangering the welfare of a child, Middlesex County Prosecutor Yolanda Ciccone announced. Second-degree crimes carry a sentence of five to 10 years in state prison. Munguia, who taught sixth-grade language arts at the school, was arrested without incident. The arrest followed an investigation by Detective Daniela Castro of the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office and Sgt. Meghan McFadden of the Carteret Police Department.

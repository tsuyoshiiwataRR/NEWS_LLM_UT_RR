    "text": "Letters Local news\nLETTER: Disturbance of peace in West Village, where are the cops?\nA West Village resident writes a letter about why cops do nothing when there is a disturbance of peace.\n• Chris Schoonwinkel writes:\nDear Station Commander of Krugersdorp Police Station.\nWest Village was under siege on Saturday night, April 13, by a ‘religious’ group who presumably played a recording of African drums very loud, right through the night. Between midnight and 01:00 on April 14, I called Krugersdorp police three times without anyone picking up.\nALSO READ:\nLETTER: Stop promoting land grabs\nI then called 10111 where I did complain about the noise and they took up my complaint and sent out an officer who investigated this matter.\nHe called me and told me that the offenders are busy with a ‘ceremony’ and there is nothing he can do. West Village is a residential suburb and the noise was very disturbing to residents.\nNow I want to know whether ‘ceremonies’ are above the law. Or is it the other way around? Seeing that the officer said that he couldn’t do anything about it.\nI would appreciate it if you would look into this matter and let me know what your views on this matter are.\nALSO READ:\nLETTER: Water crisis: What’s really going on?\nWest Rand District Police spokesperson Captain Solomon Sibiya responded to Schoonwinkel’s conversation with Lt Col Moabelo regarding his complaint.\n“No ceremony is above the law. We have looked into the matter and taken appropriate internal corrective measures to make sure that it does not happen in the future.”",

    "text": "The [scammer who sent an Ohio Uber driver to the home of an elderly man](https://www.hngn.com/articles/259783/20240418/uber-helping-ohio-police-track-down-scammer-sent-driver-home.htm) where he shot her to death spoke with deputies at the crime scene. Lo-Letha Hall, 61, died from [several gunshot wounds](https://www.hngn.com/articles/259979/20240424/oklahoma-father-murder-suicide-family-sons-killing-murder-gun-police.htm) near [81-year-old gunman William Brock](https://www.hngn.com/articles/259630/20240415/ohio-uber-driver-shot-dead-driveway-scam-caller-package.htm)'s South Charleston, Ohio, home on March 25, according to authorities. Investigators determined a scammer called Brock telling him he had a relative in jail and he needed to immediately send money, [WCMH-TV](https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/central-ohio-news/what-scammer-said-after-sending-ohio-uber-driver-on-deadly-order/#:~:text=SOUTH%20CHARLESTON%2C%20Ohio%20(WCMH),Uber%20order%20and%20phone%20calls.) reported. At the same time, a scammer called Hall to pick up a package from Brock's home. When she arrived, Brock allegedly held Hall at gunpoint and demanded that she reveal the identities of the person he had spoken with on the phone. He allegedly refused to let her leave his property and seized her cell phone. Hall attempted to flee, but Brock allegedly chased her down and shot her. The pair then got into a tussle, and Brock sustained minor injuries before allegedly shooting Hall twice more. He then called 911 to report he hit a robber. When Clark County deputies arrived, the scammer called Brock again, and Detective Sheila Crews picked up. The scammer claimed to be a law enforcement officer. \"I need to know what officer, sir,\" Crews responded, the outlet reported, citing a deputy's body cam footage. \"You're gonna be in trouble,\" the scammer threatened. Crew identified herself as a detective and the scammer claimed to know Hall. Crew informed him Hall had been in an accident. The call disconnected, but the scammer soon called back, asking about the condition of the victim. \"She's not doing well,\" Crews said. \"Oh, no,\" the scammer responded. Before Crews agreed to provide more information on Hall's condition, she told the scammer they'd need to meet her at Brock's home. \"Okay, I'm gonna be there, give me 20 minutes?\" he said, but never showed. The investigation continues. Meantime, Brock has been charged with three counts of murder, and one count each of kidnapping and felonious assault, according to the indictment, the outlet reported. He pleaded not guilty and remains in jail.",

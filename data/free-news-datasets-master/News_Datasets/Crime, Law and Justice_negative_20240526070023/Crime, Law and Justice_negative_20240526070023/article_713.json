    "text": "MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. (WSVN) – A couple was arrested after causing a scare outside a day care facility in South Florida.\nEstrella Maria Pereira, who was one of the accused, said the two didn’t realize there was a day care near where they were pulling a publicity stunt.\n“It was a poor decision,” she said.\nPereira and Miguel Ruiz were seen taking two rifles out of a Corvette before aiming it directly at the Devon Aire Kiddy College in Miami-Dade County.\nPereira now says they made a mistake.\n“Really, we’re not bad people, we will never harm anyone or anything,” she said. “We’re bodybuilders and we’re into the social media thing, Youtube Channel, you know, Instagram so forth, and he thought it would be cool to take a picture with a gun, because with muscles and guns, and it sounds really cool, like if you look at a photograph like that.”\nThe incident was supposed to be a photoshoot, according to Pereira, but it put the day care on lockdown and alarmed many parents.\n“We did everything in our power to protect the children that are here in the facility and we followed every measure to stay safe,” an unnamed day care said.\nPereira has since been bailed out, while Ruiz is still being held in custody.\nWhat began as a publicity stunt is now causing the two to be faced with serious charges.\n“It’s ridiculous,” Pereira said. “And yes, it is getting blown out of proportion. But I do understand the severity, and how it could scare somebody, because I would be freaked out if I saw somebody doing the same thing, I’d be freaked out.”\nRuiz and Pereira have been ordered to stay away from the woman who called police and the day care center.\nCopyright 2024 WSVN via CNN Newsource.

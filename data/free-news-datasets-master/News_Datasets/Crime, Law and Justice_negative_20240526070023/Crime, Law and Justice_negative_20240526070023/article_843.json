    "text": "On 24 April 2024, Kingston CIB charged a 37-year-old Huon Valley man with offences including arson and unlawfully setting fire to property. They relate to a series of fires allegedly deliberately lit in Kingston on the morning of 6 April 2024. Around $100,000 damage was caused, and a 77-year-old woman was hospitalised for smoke inhalation - she was released from hospital later that morning. The man was detained to appear in the Hobart Magistrates court on 25 April 2024. Police believe there are further witnesses who may be able to assist police with these matters â€“ they are encouraged to contact the Kingston Criminal Investigation Branch, or Crimestoppers, and reference offence report 740211. /Public Release.

    "text": "Attorney General Ashley Moody files a lawsuit against the Atlantic Coast Conference TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCJB) - Attorney General Ashley Moody on Thursday amped up a legal battle between Florida State University and the Atlantic Coast Conference, filing a lawsuit accusing the conference of violating the state’s public records laws by refusing to hand over media-rights contracts that are a critical element of the dispute. Florida State and the ACC have been fighting in court for months on two fronts: FSU’s home turf in Tallahassee and in North Carolina, where the conference is headquartered. Amid major conference realignments in college athletics, the cases are drawing intense scrutiny. The clashes hinge, in part, on the ACC’s contract with ESPN. Through the contract, the conference collects media revenues and distributes money to member schools to support their athletic programs. Moody in January sent a letter to the ACC seeking a number of documents related to the dispute, including the grant-of-rights agreement and the conference’s contract with ESPN. The ACC’s response to Moody said that some of the records she requested, including the grant-of-rights agreement, were already available publicly but the contract with ESPN was off-limits. Moody’s lawsuit filed Thursday argues that, under Florida’s broad open-records law, the contracts should not be shielded from scrutiny. “It is incredibly astounding that the media agreements would not be given to the State of Florida when the ACC is demanding over half a billion dollars from one of our entities,” said Ashley Moody, R- Attorney General. The ACC says contracts between ESPN and the conference are commercial agreements between two non-governmental entities and should not be considered public records. But the state’s lawsuit disputes that the records should be shielded.

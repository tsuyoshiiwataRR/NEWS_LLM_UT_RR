    "text": "HENDERSONVILLE, Tenn. (WCYB) â€” The Metro-Nashville community welcomed its first Safe Haven Baby Box in Hendersonville this week, the sixth one installed in Tennessee. Safe Haven has baby boxes installed at designated fire stations and hospitals in 16 states across the country. The boxes act as a resource to parents in crisis, allowing them to anonymously surrender their baby. Baby Boxes have signage posted in both English and Spanish , explaining that the resource is only accessed by those in need of service. It also informs parents that a silent alarm will activate alerting first responders or medical professionals to a surrendered baby. A 24-hour crisis line is listed on each box, which parents in crisis can call for free counseling and assistance free of charge. According to the organizations [home page](https://www.shbb.org/), the resource is designed to raise awareness of the [Safe Haven Law](Safe Haven Law), which allows parents to surrender babies without fear of prosecution. You can find a video explaining more about how the Safe Haven Baby Boxes work below. Currently there are six baby boxes in Tennessee. Virginia does not currently have any baby boxes according to Safe Haven.

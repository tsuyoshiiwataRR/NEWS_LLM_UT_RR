The body was officially identified as Buster Evans, 68, of Pineville.\nFrom its investigation, RPSO was able to pinpoint Philip Barry Felter , 64, of Pineville, as a suspect. He was taken into custody on April 11 and was booked for three counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\nPhilip Barry Felter (Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office) On April 16, RPSO said the State Fire Marshal’s Office booked Felter in connection with the structure fire on one count of simple arson, principle to simple arson, obstruction of justice-evidence tampering and conspiracy.\nThen on April 24, RPSO said Felter was re-arrested for second-degree murder and unlawful disposal of human remains while in custody at the Rapides Parish Detention Center. His bond is at $1,230,000.\nThe investigation is still active. Anyone with information can contact Detective Matt Dauzat, Criminal Investigation Division, Kolin Substation, at 318-542-4409.

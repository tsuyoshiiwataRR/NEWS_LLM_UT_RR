    "text": "LANCASTER COUNTY, Pa. — A New York man has pled guilty to a crash that killed two people in December of 2022. According to the [Lancaster County District Attorney's Office](https://lancaster.crimewatchpa.com/da/11617/post/new-york-truck-driver-had-meth-alcohol-system-when-causing-head-fatal-december-2022-crash), Jadminder Singh, 43, had methamphetamine and alcohol in his system on Interstate 76 in Brecknock Township when he caused a head-on collision, killing Nubia Llivipuma, 45, and Mariana Llivipuma, 39, of Santa Isabel Canton, Ecuador. Singh entered a negotiated guilty plea on two counts of homicide by vehicle while DUI, two counts of homicide by vehicle, five counts of DUI, one count of aggravated assault while DUI, one count of aggravated assault by vehicle, four counts of recklessly endangering another person and three summary offenses. “The defendant put all travelers on I-76 in danger that night,” said Assistant District Attorney Caitlin Blazier. “And he caused the death of two victims.” “Another tragedy, another waste of life because people can’t control themselves,” Lancaster County Judge Thomas Sponaugle said before accepting the plea. Singh will spend seven to 20 years in prison, according to the Lancaster County District Attorney's Office. On Dec. 23, 2022, at 9:31 p.m., troopers with the Pennsylvania State Police were dispatched to a report of a tractor-trailer traveling east in the westbound lane of I-76. At 9:38 p.m., police were notified that the tractor-trailer had collided with another vehicle. Police discovered at the scene the tractor-trailer was heavily damaged, facing eastbound in the center of the westbound lanes. It had collided with a Ford F-250 that had sustained heavy damage and a Toyota Corolla with minor damage. Nubia and Mariana were pronounced dead at the scene by a deputy coroner. A third victim was transported to a local hospital with injuries. Singh was identified as the driver of the tractor-trailer and consented to a blood draw, which showed methamphetamine and a 0.048% blood alcohol level in his system. The legal alcohol limit for commercial drivers is 0.04%.",

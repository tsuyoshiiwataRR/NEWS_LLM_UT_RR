    "text": "2-minute read NEWTON â€” With a unanimous vote, the Sussex County Commissioners on Wednesday declared they had \"no confidence\" in the administration of the Sussex County Technical School , after the school proposed eliminating three programs to save $800,000 from its budget. The vote, on a motion by Commissioner Chris Carney, came in front of an overflow audience that prompted the board's attorney to threaten to stop the meeting because of capacity concerns. Dozens of speakers were on-hand to protest the plan to cut the Sparta school's architecture, graphics and theater arts programs. Part of the standing-room crowd then moved into the corridor as the meeting at the county Administrative Center in Newton continued. Despite the commissioners' rebuke, they offered no sign the county would provide additional funds to help restore the endangered programs. During a tense meeting last week, the school board that oversees Sussex Tech tabled a motion to approve its $15 million budget and promised to further review its plans. The Technical School's five-member board is appointed by the county commissioners. Carney's motion came as Tech School Superintendent/Principal Gus Modla and Business Administrator Jennie Deuel appeared before the commissioners to discuss the proposed cuts of three of the school's 19 academic programs, known as \"shops.\" Carney's motion, seconded by Commissioner William Hayden, came at the end of the public comment period. The motion contained no penalties or other sanctions, but was an \"expression of our total lack of confidence\" in the administration, Carney said. The plan, and the expected loss of seven staff positions, came as a surprise to the commissioners when it was announced at the previous board meeting. Last week, at a meeting of the board that oversees the school, more than 100 speakers showed up to lambasted the plan during a public comment session that lasted for about seven hours. Wednesday's meeting was shorter, but still included a string of upset parents, students and graduates of the school. Sussex Tech offers specialized programs for high school students which local districts find too costly to provide. The school has a capacity of about 800 students and, according to Modla, is nearly at capacity this year. Prospective students go through an extensive interview process. The school is funded by a combination of state and federal aid, money from the county and tuition which is charged to the \"sending\" districts where the students live.

The school is overseen by a board appointed by the county commissioners and which meets monthly. At the April meeting, the board tabled action on the school's budget for the coming school year, which included the program and staff cuts. The tech board's next meeting is May 16. Deputy County Administrator Lorraine Hentz told the board that Newton Medical Center has provided $60,000 for a two-year program for county employees to participate in a wellness program. The program could lead to reduced health insurance costs. Email: bscruton@njherald.com Twitter/X: Twitter: @brucescrutonNJH",

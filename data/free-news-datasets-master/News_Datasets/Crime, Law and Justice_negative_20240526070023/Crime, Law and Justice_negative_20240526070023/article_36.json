    "text": "DELAND, Fla. — The Volusia County Sheriff’s Office is offering a $50,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest in a 30-year-old cold case.\nLaralee Spear was 15-years-old when she was abducted, shot and killed after getting off her school bus in DeLand on April 25, 1994. According to information from the Sheriff's Office, it is believed that Spear was taken by her killer shortly after getting off the bus at around 3:15 p.m.\nAccording to information from VCSO, Spear was reported missing at about 4:05 p.m. when she didn't return home from DeLand High School.\nAuthorities say deputies responded within minutes, and a Sheriff's Office Air One pilot ultimately located her body at around 5:35 p.m.\nInvestigators say she was found behind a home on Deerfoot Road that had burned down the previous year.\nOfficials said she routinely walked home from the bus stop at the intersection of South Spring Garden Road and Deerfoot Road, which authorities said was not far from where her body was found. The location was about a quarter mile from her family's home on Deerfoot Road.\n30 years ago today, Laralee Spear was abducted and murdered after she got off her school bus outside DeLand. She was 15 years old.\nFor 30 years, detectives have been trying to solve her case. pic.twitter.com/isVTUAkM7y\n— Volusia Sheriff (@VolusiaSheriff) April 25, 2024 Volusia County detectives said they have information that shows prior to Spear’s death, people were hanging out and shooting guns at the abandoned property.\nVolusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood said Thursday that investigators believe someone in the area at the time has information about Spear’s murder that could help in the investigation.\nAnyone with information about Spears' death is asked to contact the Major Case Unit at 386-254-1537 or email ColdCaseUnitTips@ volusiasheriff.gov .\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;",

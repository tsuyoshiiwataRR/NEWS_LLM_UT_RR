    "text": "YORK COUNTY, Neb. — A man has been charged with stealing thousands of dollars from a safe at a York truck stop. Ted Mann, 49, is charged in York County Court with theft by shoplifting (more than $5,000). According to an arrest affidavit, on Sunday, a York Police officer responded to Petro Travel Station, 4700 S. Lincoln Ave. in York, after the store’s manager reported an employee, Mann, took money from a safe. The affidavit said the manager told the officer Mann was seen on surveillance footage entering the business around 1 p.m. Saturday and taking $7,860 in cash, most of which was $20 and $100 bills. The manger told the officer Mann was scheduled to work on Sunday but did not show up. The affidavit said officers attempted to locate Mann at Super 8 Hotel, 4112 S. Lincoln Ave., but were unable to find him. Court records said the hotel registration listed a Kansas address, while his vehicle has an Arizona license plate. The Petro manager told police Mann transferred in from Tennessee. A warrant for Mann’s arrest was issued Wednesday. He has yet to be arrested. Updates will be posted as they become available.",

    "text": "Fargo man charged with terrorizing, accused of holding woman and two-year-old in feces-covered trailer FARGO, N.D. (Valley News Live) - A Fargo man, James Robert Ludwikowski, is facing 6 charges after a reported terrorizing incident on April 20th. It happened at Rivera Heights Mobile Home Community, which is near the airport. Police responded to a call there just after midnight on 4/21, according to court documents, where a woman told officers she had been locked inside the trailer with a padlock and no way out. She reportedly showed officers a voicemail from Ludwikowski, threatening to kill her if she wasn’t there. Officer state the trailer was covered in dirt and holes. The documents state the victim told police she was only allowed to use the bathroom connected to their room, which did not have a working toilet, so she had to use a cup and box to go to the bathroom. The court documents state James’s son from a previous marriage was in the back room. Officers reportedly found him rolling around in his own feces, playing on tablets covered in feces. The child was taken into protective custody. Ludwikowski was detailed just after 1 AM, reportedly smelling of alcohol and admitting to drinking. According to the court documents, he blamed the state of the house on the victim. Ludwikowski is charged with terrorizing, 2 counts of child neglect, DUI, possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. He’s pleaded not guilty to the DUI, possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia charges. His preliminary heading has been scheduled for June 5th. Copyright 2024 KVLY.

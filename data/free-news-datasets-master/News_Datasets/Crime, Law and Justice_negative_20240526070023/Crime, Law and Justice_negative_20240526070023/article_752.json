Around 10 a.m. on Tuesday, the body of [25-year-old Ashanti Jade Turner](https://www.wlbt.com/2024/04/24/mississippi-womans-body-found-yard-abandoned-home/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR0uImdiU-gRCw3fcyiLtlEvMSWxtdUH7TdSdYiGCQb5YanchICY2JUjOEg_aem_AX_wc4MLGcQkjfiQY9-WSJtAyiK5TguUeiY31NAJ0za6bH1TQFyhOs-UqjZHDX_cu9qUqhF8rE8o8uWuFruheihv) was found in the yard of the home located on Industrial Street. On Wednesday, Damian Peterson was accused of murdering Turner. He was initially named as a potential suspect. Peterson surrendered at noon on Wednesday on unrelated assault charges.

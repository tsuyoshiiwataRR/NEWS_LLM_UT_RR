    "text": "Reports indicate that the Assistant Controller of Corrections at the Niger State Correctional Centre Minna, ACC Abdulrahamam Ibrahim Gelele, has been abducted by unidentified gunmen.\nThe Command’s Public Relations Officer (PRO), CSC Rabiu Mohammed Shuaibu, stated that the ACC was reportedly taken captive on April 17, 2024.\nShuaibu mentioned that the officer was kidnapped while returning from Ilorin on vacation, along the Ilorin – Minna road.\nThe incident was initially shrouded in secrecy, with hopes of his prompt release. However, after more than a week, it has now become a topic of discussion at the center’s headquarters.\nIt was also disclosed that the abductors have had contact with the victim’s family once, but have since ceased communication with both the family and his workplace.\nThe statement from the Controller of Corrections, Niger State CC Mohammed Hamisu Isa, appeals for prayers for the safe release and freedom of the captive.\nInitially kept under wraps in anticipation of his imminent release, the duration of his captivity has now become widely known within the facility.",

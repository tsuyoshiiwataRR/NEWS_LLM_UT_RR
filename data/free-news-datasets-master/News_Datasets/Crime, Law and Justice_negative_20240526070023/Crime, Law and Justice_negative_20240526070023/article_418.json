    "text": "WCSO looking for man injured during shooting on Ella Way BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (WBKO) - The Warren County Sheriff’s Office is looking for 36-year-old Jessie Ray Curtis concerning a shooting earlier this week. According to reports, Curtis sustained a gunshot wound to his back on Monday morning during an exchange of gunfire stemming from Ella Way. On April 22, the WCSO received a call of an accident on Murphy Road. The caller advised that one of the vehicles was attempting to leave the scene. As deputies were responding, another call came out reporting a shooting on Ella Way. As parties were fleeing the scene and heading down Murphy Road, another exchange of gunfire erupted. Witnesses advised several people took off running across fields in different directions. A black Enclave was also seen leaving the scene towards Highway 240. After a short foot pursuit, deputies arrested Joshua Culbreath who had outstanding warrants, and was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The black Enclave was also located abandoned in a barn along Vance Lane. Search warrants were obtained for the home on Ella Way and involved vehicles. The resident of Ella Way, Jess Fitzgerald, was arrested for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and trafficking in marijuana. Curtis also has active warrants for first-degree burglary and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. If see him or know where he is, call 911 and report his location. Do not approach him as he may be armed. Copyright 2024 WBKO. All rights reserved.",

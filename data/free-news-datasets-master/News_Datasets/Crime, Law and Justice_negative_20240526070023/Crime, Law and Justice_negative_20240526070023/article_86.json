    "text": "Crime Loved Ones of Okla. Murder-Suicide Victims Pay Tribute: ‘I Could Have Never Imagined That' \"He was the light of the room and our team,\" the baseball coach of one of the child victims told a local Oklahoma outlet\nBy Nicole Acosta Nicole Acosta Nicole Acosta is a staff writer on the crime team at PEOPLE. She previously worked at Daily Voice and doNYC and is a Mercy College (now University) graduate. People Editorial Guidelines Published on April 25, 2024 04:51PM EDT Close From left: Jonathon Candy, Ethan Candy, Dylan Candy, and Lindsay Candy. (Not pictured: Lucas Candy.). Photo: Jonathon Candy;Ethan Candy;Dylan Candy/Facebook\nThe families and friends of the Oklahoma mother and three of her sons who died at the hands of her husband earlier this week have opened up about their grief.\nThe Oklahoma City Police Department announced the deaths of Jonathon Candy, 42, Lindsay Candy, 39, Dylan Candy, 18, Ethan Candy, 14, and Lucas Candy, 12, in a press release shared on April 23, one day after the murder-suicide carried out by Jonathon.\nPolice said Jonathon fatally shot his wife after an argument on the morning of April 22, and then “systematically” went through their home, killing three of their sons, PEOPLE previously reported. The couple’s youngest child, a 10-year-old boy, was the sole survivor and called 911 that morning after waking up to find their bodies.\nAll About Okla. Family Murder-Suicide, Where Dad Killed Wife, 3 Sons Before the Last Surviving Child Called 911 According to Oklahoma City Police Sgt. Gary Knight, the boy was in his room sleeping with the door closed and a box fan on during the murders, presumably muffling any sound, ABC News reports.\n“There is no indication he didn't sleep through it,” Knight said, per the outlet.\nThe boy is currently in the care of a relative, police said. Authorities added that they never received calls to the family’s home prior to the murders and that they had no history of domestic abuse reports.\nA motive for the violence remains under investigation by police.\nSpeaking of Ethan’s death, Wyatt Livecy, identified as the boy’s best friend, told local outlet KOKH-TV , “I could have never imagined that. Ever. In my whole entire life... I'm still in shock.”\n3 Sons Killed in Okla. Murder-Suicide Were 'Hunted' by Dad, Who Also Murdered Wife Before Killing Himself: Police Ethan’s baseball coach, T.J. Armstrong told The Oklahoman , “He was the light of the room and our team.” Armstrong added that the boy’s brother Dylan “was a sweet young man” and that their mother, Lindsay, could be seen at each game cheering Ethan on, according to the outlet.\n“We ask that you keep the Candy family, as well as their teammates and friends, in your thoughts and prayers as they continue through this loss of multiple loved ones,” the sports league associated with Ethan’s baseball team wrote on Facebook earlier this week.\nIn a statement sent to parents on April 22, Mustang Public Schools confirmed that two of the boys were students in the district and the other was a recent graduate, according to News on 6.\n“Earlier today, we confirmed that a tragedy occurred at a home within our District, and we can now confirm the deaths of two of our students (a 6th-grade student attending Meadow Brook Intermediate and a 9th-grade student attending Mustang High School) along with a recent (2023) MPS graduate,\" the statement said.\nFrom left: Lucas Candy, Dylan Candy and Ethan Candy in a photo from 2012. Jonathon Candy/Facebook\nIn a tribute posted to Facebook on April 24, Oklahoma Baptist University mourned the loss of Dylan.\n“The OBU family mourns the sudden loss of our fellow Bison, Dylan Candy,” the post reads. “While his time on Bison Hill was short, he will be remembered by many, especially his fellow members of the Bison Brigade.”\nFollowing the tragedy, the Candy family released a statement to local station KFOR on April 23, expressing shock and describing Jonathon as “goofy.”\nWhy Did 'Goofy' Okla. Dad Kill Wife and 3 Sons in Murder-Suicide? Family 'Can't Fathom' What Went Wrong “Our entire family has been left shattered and confused with so many questions we won’t ever have answers to,” the statement reads, according to the outlet. “Jonathon was the one whose jokes and goofy attitude kept everyone smiling. Aside from these events, his children and wife were his entire life.”\nLindsay Candy, left, and Jonathon Candy.

It’s going to be a very long healing process for everyone affected.”\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Couple Appeared in Interview Nearly 2 Years Before Husband Murdered Wife, 3 Sons, Then Turned Gun on Self “As many others have expressed, our hearts are broken this morning after the confirmation of the tragedy that occurred in our community,” Just Baked Bakery & Deli wrote in the April 23 post.\nThe business adds, “We grew to know and love the Candy family as some of our most loyal customers who became friends. We are praying big prayers for all of their family, friends, classmates, teammates, teachers and others who are now heartbroken and living in this tragedy. Hug your loved ones tight, pray for your family and for others, and check on those you love. If there is anything we can do please reach out to us.”\nA GoFundMe campaign to support the couple’s surviving son has been created and has raised more than $20,000 as of April 25.\nAnyone with information on the case is asked to call the Oklahoma City Police Department's Homicide Tip Line at 405-297-1200.\nIf you are experiencing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233, or go to thehotline.org .

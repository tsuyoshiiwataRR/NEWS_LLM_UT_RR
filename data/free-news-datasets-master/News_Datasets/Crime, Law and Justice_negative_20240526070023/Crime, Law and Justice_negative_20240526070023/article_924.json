    "text": "A Wadsworth Middle School teacher has been charged with three counts of sexual imposition involving three students at the school, police said. Robert Bodjanac, 46, of Wadsworth, pleaded not guilty to the charges, all misdemeanors, and was released on a $1,500 bond Thursday.Bodjanac couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Court records did not say if he is represented by an attorney.Bodjanac has been on leave from the school since Wadsworth police launched an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing March 27, police said.\nIt's not clear how officials became aware of possible wrongdoing by Bodjanac, who teaches science at the school.According to police, staff at the middle school contacted a school resource officer after someone there reported inappropriate contact. That officer and Wadsworth detectives launched an immediate investigation, learning there were other allegations of inappropriate contact, all involving girls at the school.Police arrested Bodjanac Thursday. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 60 days in jail and $750 in fines.Officials have not publicly disclosed details of the allegations of sexual imposition.Police say they continue to investigate and that anyone with information should call detectives at 330-336-2405.\nThey also urged students with additional information to reach out to school staff or counselors.",

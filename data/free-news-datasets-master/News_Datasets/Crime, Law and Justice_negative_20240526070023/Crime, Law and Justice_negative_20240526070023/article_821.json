    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — University of Texas officials and students are hoping for calm to return to The 40 Acres today after what UT President Jay Hartzell called \"a challenging day.\" Tempers flared and [dozens were arrested](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/dps-troopers-detain-protest-organizer-at-ut-austin-pro-palestine-demonstration#) at a planned pro-Palestinian protest. The event was organized by the Palestine Solidarity Committee, a registered student organization. They say they had plans for a [peaceful protest](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/this-was-supposed-to-be-peaceful-dozens-detained-at-ut-austin-protest) with educational activities. One protestor who identified themselves simply as Maddox told us, “The original itinerary of this sit-in included scholastic teach-ins-- but the presence of police with batons, chemical weapons, pepper bullets.. is making us all on edge.\" Dozens of Texas DPS Troopers were staged nearby and went in as the crowd grew, and that seemed to add to the tensions between law enforcement and the protestors. One protestor told us students were banned from stepping on the lawn and when students came close they were met with force. The new boundaries allowed the state to use its criminal trespass law against violators who protest organizers and even UT President Hartzell said were not part of the original group. In his written statement last night Hartzell noted, “People not affiliated with UT joined them, and many ignored university officials’ continual pleas for restraint and to immediately disperse.\" And while dozens of people were rounded up and charged, County Attorney Delia Garza promised to look seriously at those charges. She said in an online post, “We are working with defense attorneys of those arrested as we continue to investigate each case and determine if charges are necessary.\" Some faculty members reported about another possible rally on Thursday, but the only one we saw on the calendar is not pro-Palestinian related. It's to support the UT staff members who were abruptly fired with the state-mandated end of diversity, equity and inclusion programs on campus. But things can change.",

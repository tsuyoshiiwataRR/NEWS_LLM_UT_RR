    "text": "Every time I hear of someone who has died of a heart attack at the age of 52, I feel I've been hit with a tonne of bricks.Cricket god Shane Warne died of a heart attack aged 52, in 2022. The same year, Victorian senator Kimberley Kitching, died. Fifty-two. A heart attack. \\u003cbr\\u003eJust days after Warne died, Essendon legend Dean Wallis suffered a heart attack. At the age of 52. Thankfully, he survived.All just a coincidence, but it makes me feel every death or close call more keenly.Terry Hill also reminds me of a simpler, more innocent time when boofheads talking footy and eating chillis for a dare were prime-time television ratings gold.It was like your local footy club review - remember those? - on steroids. Well, maybe not steroids. But ... bigger.Decked out in a gold jacket, Tezza was regularly sent out to interview bewildered overseas guests, Norman Gunston-style.\\u003cbr\\u003eOne time he memorably asked Hollywood star Charlie Sheen, at a Planet Hollywood opening, if Sheen thought Queensland could come back from its first loss against NSW in the State of Origin.While known for his footy career, especially with Manly, that included wearing the green and gold for Australia, Hill also had another passion - greyhounds.Greyhound Racing NSW was among those paying tribute to Hill in the wake of his death this week. Chief executive Rob Macauley said Hill had been one of the great assets of the industry.Ah, Nads. Remember him? (I thought he was owned by everyone on \\u003ci\\u003eThe Footy Show?\\u003c/i\\u003e No matter.)\\u003cbr\\u003eThe significance of Nads' name always came to the fore, of course, when fans were barracking for him.Completely juvenile, I know. But funny.Nads was his own star.I remember he once visited the local greyhound track in my hometown of Muswellbrook in the Hunter Valley. \\u003cbr\\u003eIt was like Beyonce had dropped by, such was the excitement.And, of course, Terry Hill will always be remembered for his starring role in the Lowes ads, providing champagne acting as he flogged the fleecy-lined sloppy joes and tracky-dacks.He was a character, someone who might not have been perfect but was human and himself. \\u003cbr\\u003eRIP, Tezza.",

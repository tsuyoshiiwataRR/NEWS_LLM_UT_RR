Cruz announces that investors with substantial losses have opportunity to lead the securities fraud class action lawsuit against Snowflake Inc. (\"Snowflake\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: SNOW ).\nClass Period: September 16, 2020 – March 2, 2022\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: April 29, 2024\nIf you are a shareholder who suffered a loss, click here to participate.\nThe complaint filed alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Snowflake had systematically oversold capacity to customers which created a misleading appearance of the demand for Snowflake's products and services; (2) that Snowflake had provided significant discounts to its customers prior to the IPO that temporarily boosted sales but would not be sustainable after the IPO and/or necessitate platform efficiency adjustments that negatively impacted client consumption and Snowflake's revenue and profit margins; (3) that, as a result, Snowflake's customers were poised to roll over a material amount of unused credits (and thereby cannibalize future sales) at the end of their contracts' terms or to refuse to renew their contracts at prior consumption levels or at all; (4) that, as a result, Snowflake's product revenue and remaining performance obligations had been artificially inflated leading up to and during the Class Period; and (5) as a result, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.\nFollow us for updates on Twitter: twitter.com/FRC_LAW .\nTo be a member of the class action you need not take any action at this time; you may retain counsel of your choice or take no action and remain an absent member of the class action.

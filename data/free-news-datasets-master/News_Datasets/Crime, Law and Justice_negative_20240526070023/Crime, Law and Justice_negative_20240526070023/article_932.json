Police said the man went to his vehicle and returned with a black handgun before yelling and cursing at the staff for his money back.\nPolice released a short surveillance clip showing the man walking into the restaurant with a gun and making a gesture over the counter.\nMPD described the man as 5-foot-11 and 210 pounds with a dark complexion and a bald head. He was wearing glasses, a blue T-shirt and light blue jeans, police said.\nMemphis Police are looking for an armed man who threatened a cashier working at a Wingstop in East Memphis on Thursday, April 24, 2024.\nThe encounter is another example of recent attacks on fast food workers across the Mid-South and the rest of the U.S.\nIn March, police said a 22-year-old man fired shots into a McDonald's in Memphis after an argument with a drive-thru employee there. Earlier this month, two men carjacked a man outside his Memphis home before using his vehicle in a string of fast food restaurant robberies in which they allegedly went through drive-thru windows and stole cash .\nAnd in November 2023, an armed man in a silver Infiniti SUV pulled up to the drive-thru window of a Taco Bell in Hickory Hill but instead of paying, he is seen in surveillance footage getting out of the vehicle to reach inside and steal a cash register.\nAt the time, police were investigating whether he robbed two other Taco Bells in Memphis.",

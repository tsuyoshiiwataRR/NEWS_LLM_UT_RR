    "text": "More than 100 arrested at US university pro-Palestinian protests More than 100 people were arrested at two universities in California and Texas, officials said, after pro-Palestinian protests erupted across US campuses this week. Pro-Palestine demonstrators argue with USC public safety officers after officers attempted to take down an encampment in support of Gaza at the University of Southern California on April 24, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. Pro-Palestinian encampments have sprung up at college campuses around the country recently. Mario Tama/Getty Images/AFP (Photo by MARIO TAMA / GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / Getty Images via AFP)\nMore than 100 people were arrested Wednesday at two universities in California and Texas, officials said, after pro-Palestinian protests erupted across US campuses this week.\nDemonstrations flared at the University of Southern California’s (USC) Los Angeles campus, where 93 people were arrested for trespassing, and at the University of Texas (UT) in Austin, where 34 were arrested, according to authorities.\nThe tense standoffs were among the latest on-campus confrontations between law enforcement, including police in riot gear, and banner-wielding students outraged at the mounting death toll in Israel’s war against Palestinian militant group Hamas.\nUSC said on social media site X at around midnight that the protest had ended and the campus would remain “closed until further notice.”\n“Students, faculty, staff, and people with business on campus may enter with proper identification,” the university said.\nRead more ANC can rise again, says Dali Tambo ALSO READ: In bad taste: Biden hints his ‘Uncle Bosie’ was eaten by PNG cannibals\nLos Angeles police officers went to the campus on Wednesday afternoon and “assisted the university in effecting trespass arrests” when protesters refused to leave, Captain Kelly Muniz told reporters.\nThe LAPD said there were no reports of injuries and patrols would remain in the area on Thursday.\nFree speech The spreading pro-Palestinian protests began at Columbia University in New York, where dozens of arrests were made last week after university authorities called in police to quell a protest encampment that some Jewish students said was threatening and anti-Semitic.\nDemonstrators, including a number of Jewish students, have disavowed instances of anti-Semitism and criticized officials equating it with opposition to Israel.\nAs students and other demonstrators have camped out on school quads, occupied university buildings and disrupted campus activities, universities this week have affirmed their rights to free speech and peaceful protest.\nALSO READ: More than 50 000 displaced by clashes in northern Ethiopia: UN\nBut pro-Israel supporters and others worried about campus safety have also pointed to anti-Semitic incidents and allege that campuses are encouraging intimidation and hate speech.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters at Columbia on Wednesday that the demonstrations “place a target on the backs of Jewish students in the United States,” adding that the National Guard could be brought in if the protests were not contained soon.\nOn Sunday, US President Joe Biden denounced “blatant anti-Semitism” that has “no place on college campuses.”\nBut the White House has also said that the president supports freedom of expression on US campuses.\nStudent protesters say they are expressing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, where the death toll has topped 34,305, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and are calling on universities to divest from companies with ties to Israel.\nALSO READ: Tensions flare at US universities over Gaza protests\nUS ally Israel launched its war in Gaza after the Hamas attack on October 7 that left around 1,170 people dead, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\n– By: © Agence France-Presse\nRead more on these topics education Israel Palestine politics United States of America (USA/US) Catch up with the latest news from The Citizen on WhatsApp by following our channel.

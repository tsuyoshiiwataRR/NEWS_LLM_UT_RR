    "text": "Shocking video shows a bus slam into a building as a rider punches the driver. Video has been released from inside of the bus that crashed over the weekend in Oklahoma City, causing damages to a business and injuries. On Saturday, police arrested a man accused of assaulting an Embark bus driver. Tihron Harrison was arrested for assault and battery. The bus ran into a business off North Western and Britton Road around 2:20 p.m. Saturday. Lt. Jeff Cooper with the Oklahoma City Police Department said, \"When they [officers] arrived, they found that the subject actually assaulted the bus driver, causing him to leave the roadway and enter the Britton lumber building,\" A passenger became irate after the bus driver told him he could not stop the bus for an early stop, according to investigators. Cooper said, \"The suspect then began punching the bus driver in the face and removed him from the driver's seat. This caused the bus to leave the roadway and run into the Britton Lumber business.\" Officials said two people were inside \" Britton Lumber \" but were not injured. The bus driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. The police report noted that Harrison was still on the scene when police arrived, but refused to be detained. Police said he ran off and tried to jump a fence. He was arrested and taken to a local hospital for a medical release.",

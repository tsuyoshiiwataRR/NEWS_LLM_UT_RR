    "text": "A Bryan man was arrested Wednesday for allegedly threatening a person with a knife during an argument, according to the Bryan Police Department. Kurt Battreall, 63, has been charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, according to Brazos County Jail records. At 8:08 p.m. Wednesday, police said officers responded to a report of two men arguing at the Tejas Center and one of them had a knife. Upon arrival, police said they spoke with the victim who told officers that Battreall, his stepbrother, had pulled out a knife immediately upon viewing him. According to the probable cause report, police also spoke to Battreall who told police that he had not really had a knife but had presented to be holding one behind him. Officers said no knife was found on Battreall’s person, but a pocket knife was recovered from a trash can near where Battreall had been standing when police arrived. People are also reading… Aggravated assault with a deadly weapon is a second-degree felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $10,000.

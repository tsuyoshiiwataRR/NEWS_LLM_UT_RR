    "text": "DOUGLAS COUNTY, Ore. (KPTV) - A man is accused of pouring a chemical into a rearing pond at an Oregon hatchery, leading to the death of thousands of young salmon.\nThe investigation began on Monday at the Gardiner, Reedsport, and Winchester Bay (GRWB) Salmon Trout Enhancement Program hatchery. In a Facebook post , the hatchery says a suspect broke in by destroying several door locks and then dumped a gallon of bleach into one of the rearing tanks, killing thousands of smolt Chinook salmon. Oregon State Police reported nearly 18,000 were killed.\n“The economic driver of these fish is huge,” said Deborah Yates, the president of the Gardiner Reedsport Winchester Bay Salmon, Trout Enhancement Program. “This is not little. It’s being considered the biggest poaching incident in Oregon history, I think. It’s monstrous.”\nSEE ALSO: Rural Oregon firefighters rescue cow stuck up to her neck in mud\nDeputies with the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office processed the scene and began an investigation.\nThen on Tuesday, at about 6:30 p.m., a deputy patrolling the area saw a man walking south along Highway 101, near milepost 210. The sheriff’s office says the deputy later walked into the hatchery and saw the same man, identified as 22-year-old Joshua Alexander Heckathorn, behind the locked gate and no trespassing signs.\nWhile speaking with the deputy, the sheriff’s office says Heckathorn admitted to trespassing and handling the chemical bottle on Monday.\nHeckathorn was arrested and booked into the Douglas County Jail for second-degree burglary, criminal trespass, and criminal mischief.\n“People care so much that someone hurt these living fish,” said Yates. “I’ve seen nature do some horrific things, but never a person. We call it murder…Resulting in the death of 18,000 salmon.”\nDue to the number of smolt chinook salmon that were killed, the sheriff’s office will be working with the Oregon State Police Fish and Wildlife unit on the case.\n“Solving this case is the result of collaboration and good policework,” said Sheriff John Hanlin. “I am proud of the work done by the deputies and have full confidence that the investigation will aid in holding those responsible accountable for their actions.”\nA teenage boy is facing charges after police say he shot at Gresham-Barlow School District buses that were on the way to pick up students. The hatchery says it has three remaining rearing tanks that hold about 60,000 fall Chinook salmon pre-smolt that will be released into Winchester Bay later this spring.\n“I think he’s going to live to regret what he did,” said Yates. “It just makes no sense.”\nThe investigation is ongoing, and no other details have been released at this time.\nCopyright 2024 KPTV-KPDX.

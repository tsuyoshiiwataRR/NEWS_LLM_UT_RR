    "text": "‘I failed.’ NC camp counselor didn’t complete thorough checks before boy’s death WBTV Investigates: New state report reveals details leading up to 12-year-old’s death LAKE TOXAWAY (WBTV) – A new report released by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services reveals new details about the events leading up to the death of a 12-year-old boy at a therapeutic wilderness camp in the western part of the state. The boy died in early February, less than a day after arriving at Trails Carolina, which bills itself as a therapeutic wilderness camp for troubled children. The camp has been [effectively shut down since late February](https://www.wbtv.com/2024/03/28/nc-dhhs-revoke-trails-carolinas-license/), with state regulators extending the ban on new admissions at the camp in late March following an inspection. Findings from that inspection—along with a response from the camp’s administrators—were released in a new report on Monday. State regulators cited the camp for failing to properly administer medications to campers, failing to let them send and receive letters without review by staff, failing to provide campers a safe and comfortable place to sleep, and failing to properly monitor campers overnight. A bulk of the report focuses on the events and circumstances leading up to the 12-year-old boy’s death in early February. Previous: [‘Shame on you.’ Former participants weigh in on NC wilderness camp](https://www.wbtv.com/2024/02/22/shame-you-former-participants-weigh-nc-wilderness-camp/) According to the report, four staff members were working in the boy’s cabin the night he died. Based on details in the report, each of the staff members had been in their current roles for less than a year. All of the staff members slept through the night with the participants, according to the report, but one staff member was responsible for wake up throughout the night to check on the boy, who was sleeping locked in bivy—a small sleeping bag-tent hybrid. The N.C. DHHS report quotes from the staff member’s interview with criminal investigators. According to the report, the staff member told investigators that he couldn’t see the boy through the bivy. Instead, the report said, the staff member relied on the fact that he claimed to be able to hear breathing coming from inside. “I didn’t check as thoroughly as I should have,” the staffer reportedly told investigators. “My actions that night was to perform night checks… that was my responsibility, which I failed on.” The staff member also added that he did “feel like the bivy had a lot to do with” the boy’s death. A second staff member “nodded and answered ‘yes’ to the question, do you think he suffocated,” according to the report. In response to each of the deficiencies cited by regulators, staff at Trails Carolina pointed out that nearly every deficiency cited was something that had been previously approved by N.C. DHHS regulators. A spokeswoman for Trails Carolina issued the following statement: “We believe the DHHS Report of Deficiencies is inaccurate and misleading in many respects, and we continue to work with State officials to clarify and correct where needed. In fact, just yesterday, April 23, 2024, we met with DHHS staff in person, and walked them through basic camping lexicon and systems, which, by their admission, they did not previously understand. Most importantly, the cause of death has yet to be released by the medical examiner, and, in the meantime, statements by anyone beyond those with authority and direct access to specifics of the autopsy are nothing more than speculation.” A spokeswoman for N.C. DHHS issued the following statement: “The recent investigation of Trails Carolina by DHHS’ Division of Health Service Regulation (DHSR) identified a number of serious and concerning issues that are documented in the Statement of Deficiencies dated 3/21/2024. Our investigation resulted in an intent to revoke Trails Carolina’s license, a suspension of admissions, and penalties totaling $18,000.” “An informal conference was held yesterday with Trails Carolina, at their request. DHSR staff will make a final decision regarding the organization’s license in the coming weeks. We are unable to provide further comment based on the ongoing investigation.” “DHSR believes that no one should be harmed while receiving care in a licensed healthcare facility and takes seriously its role to investigate complaints about care and, when necessary, takes appropriate actions against a licensed facility that has caused such harm.” WBTV has been [investigating Trails Carolina since 2021](https://www.wbtv.com/2021/05/24/its-beyond-cruel-inside-nc-wilderness-therapy-program-teens/) and has talked with a half-dozen campers who have detailed allegations of abuse and neglect while at the camp.

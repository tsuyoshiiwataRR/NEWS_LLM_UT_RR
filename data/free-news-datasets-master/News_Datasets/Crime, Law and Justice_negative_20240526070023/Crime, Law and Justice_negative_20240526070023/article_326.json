    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. – A 15-year-old boy will spend the next six years in jail for the death of a teen girl in a fatal stabbing last month in Orange County. Anthony Rushing, 15, pleaded no contest and was sentenced to jail until he is 21, with several conditions such as probation. He received the maximum the law allows in a case like this. The mother of the 16-year-old victim gave an emotional statement to the court. Jasmyne Stringer said the punishment is not enough, telling News 6 the sentence was, “Too lenient. There are too many conditions, too many loopholes and like I said it’s complete BS, it’s a slap in the face.” Kennedy Williams, 16, was killed in the stabbing along South Goldenrod Road, between an Amscot and the Astro Skating Center on March 15. Investigators say an altercation happened after several teens left the skating rink. Another teen was also stabbed but survived. Stringer says the laws need to be changed in Florida because it’s not fair that Rushing will be able to go on with his life when he turns 21.

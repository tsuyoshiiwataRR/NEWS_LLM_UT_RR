    "text": "An Oakland County businessman is being held in jail on a $500,000 bond after he was charged Thursday in connection with a deadly blast that destroyed a Clinton Township vape supply shop in March.\nNoor Noel Kestou, 31, of Commerce Township, was arraigned in 41B District Court in Clinton Township on charges of involuntary manslaughter, a 15-year felony.\nAuthorities took Kestou into custody earlier this week in New York where he had a plane ticket to another country, according to Macomb County Prosecutor Peter Lucido.\n“Whether he was coming back has yet to be determined,” Lucido said.\nThe case, assembled by multiple government agencies, is still open and additional charges may be filed, the prosecutor said. He praised the work of all of those involved.\n“I take pride in applauding the work by the Clinton Township police and fire departments,” he said. “They had to orchestrate the work of six or seven agencies, and did so masterfully. I commend the work of Police Chief Dina Caringi and the others in charge of this investigation.”\nThe March 4 massive blasts and subsequent fire at Goo Smoke Shop/Select Distributors Wholesale warehouse on 15 Mile Road at Groesbeck Highway rocked central Macomb County and sent debris up to two miles away. One of an estimated 1,000 metal canisters at the scene fatally struck a 19-year-man and another injured a township firefighter.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency personnel and Clinton Township fire investigators on the scene of Monday’s explosion near 15 Mile Road and Groesbeck Highway. (MACOMB DAILY FILE PHOTO) According to Clinton Township officials and prosecutors, the explosion and fire were caused by thousands of improperly stored canisters of butane and nitrous oxide. Resulting flareups from the fire continued to burn for about a week before it was totally extinguished, Clinton Township fire officials have said.\nKilled in the blast was Turner Lee Salter, 19, of Clinton Township, who was standing at a car wash on 15 Mile Road when he was he was hit by airborne shrapnel from one of the cannisters. He died a few hours later at an area hospital.\nSalter’s family attends Faith Baptist Church in Clinton Township, where Pastor Tim Berlin described him as a “joy to be around.” The young man served as a volunteer in the church’s audio/visual department.\nLucido said he hopes the arrest brings some sense of closure to both Salter’s family and the community in general “who want to know how did this happen.”\n“Our hearts ache for the family and loved ones of the young man whose life was tragically cut short by this devastating explosion, ” he said.\n.Kestou was arraigned before Magistrate Ryan Zemke, who set bond at $500,000 cash/surety only.\nIf he is able to post the bond, Kestou must wear a GPS tether, surrender his passport, not leave the state and have no weapons.\nA probable cause hearing is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, May 7 before Judge Sebastian Lucido.\nMeanwhile, Clinton Township officials have scheduled a news conference on the incident for 10 a.m. Friday at the Civic Center, where they will release additional details of the investigation.",

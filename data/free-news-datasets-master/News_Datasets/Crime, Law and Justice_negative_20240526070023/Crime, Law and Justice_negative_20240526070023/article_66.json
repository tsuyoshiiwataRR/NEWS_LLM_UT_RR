On the same day, Demopolis Police arrested Versa Mae Simmons, a 68-year-old employee at the Tender Years daycare and charged her with murder in connection with the death of the infant, police said at the time, per WSFA and The Demopolis Times.

Brayden would often come home from the daycare with scratches, which the caretakers explained away as scratches from his own nails or the clip of his pacifier, she explained, per WSFA. “Ask all the questions. If you think it wasn’t his fingernails? Ask,” Taylor said. “Ask for video footage. Ask. I wish I could go back and change a lot, but I can’t.” She also said there were instances when the child would light up when she saw her at the end of the day. “[Of] course you just think that’s your baby excited to see you,” she recalled, according to WSFA. “But now as a mother, it makes me wonder, are you so excited because I’m finally taking you away from something that you don’t like.” “He didn’t have a voice. He couldn’t tell me ‘Momma, I don’t want to go here,’ ” she said. Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

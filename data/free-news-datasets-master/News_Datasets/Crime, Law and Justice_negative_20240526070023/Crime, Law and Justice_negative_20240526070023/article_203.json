    "text": "SALEM, Ore. (KPTV) - A man is facing multiple charges after kidnapping his ex-girlfriend and her kids, according to the Salem Police Department.\nPolice say 25-year-old Agustin Caldaza Sierra assaulted a former girlfriend, then forced her and her children into his car on April 18. The woman was able to escape from the car as Sierra drove, and the kids were later found safe, according to police.\nDuring the investigation, detectives were able to locate Sierra and arrest him Thursday morning at an apartment in the 4100 block of Satter Drive Northeast.\nFOX 12 learned a Benton County judge denied a request in protective order filed by the suspectâ€™s ex-wife to order him to wear a GPS monitoring device. Sierra was booked into the Marion County Jail for three counts of first-degree kidnapping, strangulation, first-degree burglary, menacing, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, coercion, fourth-degree assault, harassment, custodial interference, and stalking.\nThe investigation is ongoing, and no other details are being released at this time.\nCopyright 2024 KPTV-KPDX.

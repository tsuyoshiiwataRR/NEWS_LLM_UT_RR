    "text": "A much loved father-of-two has been identified as the camper who died on Boxing Day when a tree branch fell on him in a freak accident in Victoria. Greg Jordan was celebrating the festive season on a private property in Caringal, two hours east of Melbourne , when wild storms swept through the region. A tree branch fell and hit him on the head at about 9am on Tuesday and despite paramedics rushing to the scene, he could not be saved. Mr Jordan is survived by his wife Karen and their two children, Serena, 18, and Bailey, 21. Greg Jordan (pictured with wife Karen) tragically died in a freak accident on Boxing Day when a tree branch fell on him during wild weather while camping in Victoria Tributes have poured in from his family and friends with his daughter sharing a heartbreaking tribute on social media this week. 'It is with a heavy heart that on Boxing Day morning we lost a king. My Dad,' Serena said. 'It was a freak accident that ended in tragedy. And no, I don't want to believe it either.' She described him as a 'super man' who would 'go out of his way to help anyone at any time' and 'never gave up on anybody'. 'To mum, dad was a loving caring husband (that wouldn't let her use his ride-on mower), because that was his job,' she said. 'But dad was strong and protective of his family and wouldn't let anyone get in the way. 'To my brother Bailey, we're gonna make dad proud, we will stand tall and promise dad to look after mum we will carry our dad's legacy forward and not look back. Mr Jordan's daughter Serena (pictured together) remembered her father as a 'super man' who 'would help anyone' Tributes have poured in for Bunyip family man Greg Jordan following the accident 'He was a man with a pure heart that wanted the best for us kids, yes we might have been spoiled, but dad taught us to appreciate the little things. 'Dad taught us how to drive and ride dirt bikes and do all the things that not many other dads did for their kids. 'But we will definitely make him proud when your little bubba comes along. 'I love you dad forever and always.'",

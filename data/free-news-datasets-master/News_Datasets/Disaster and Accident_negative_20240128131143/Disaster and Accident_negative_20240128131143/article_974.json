    "text": "According to the Liberian presidency, at least 40 people died in the explosion of a tanker truck late Tuesday, December 26. In a locality in the center of the country, a vehicle overturned on the road, then local residents tried to get gasoline, but an explosion occurred.\nIt is a horror scene already seen in many other countries. On Tuesday, a tanker truck was involved in an accident in the town of Totota located in Bong County. The heavy goods vehicle finally lay down on the roadway, then local residents rushed to siphon off the gasoline.\nWitnesses described people climbing onto the truck, others with containers, trying to collect the fuel, and others hitting the tank with iron bars to release more liquid.\nBut eventually the vehicle exploded, burning dozens of people alive. Several victims were so affected that their bodies were no longer recognizable, dozens of other injured were transported to various hospitals in the region, some were in critical condition, raising fears of an increasingly heavy toll over the years. days.\nThe outgoing Liberian president offered his sincere condolences, speaking about deeply shocking images. George Weah called on Liberians to show solidarity with bereaved families, before assuring\nhealth authorities of his support to release more resources to save as many lives as possible.\nWith PressAfrik",

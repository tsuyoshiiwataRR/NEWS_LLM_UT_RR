The Bureau of Meteorology forecasts rain will probably have cleared for midnight firework celebrations in major cities, with Brisbane set to be the wettest.\nTents and caravans were swept away during 30-minute deluge that inundated Buchan campsite, with holidaymakers describing the terrifying moment a wall of water inundated the popular camping site in regional Victoria on Boxing Day, leaving two people dead and millions of dollars’ worth of damage.\nThere has also been some tragedy in waters. A teenage boy died after a shark attack near Ethel Beach in South Australia, police say, and a kayaker has died in waters off Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula.\nI’ll be rolling the blog through the day – if you see anything you don’t want us to miss, send it my way on X, formerly Twitter, at @At_Raf.",

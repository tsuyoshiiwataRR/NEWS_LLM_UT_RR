    "text": "2023-12-28 16:15:00 Wednesday shortly before 8 p.m., an accident occurred on the N94 (rue du Sourd d’Ave), in the entity of Rochefort, a few steps from the town of Wellin. Two cars collided near the intersection with the N86. The shock was violent: two people had to be extricated by the Dinaphi rescue zone. The firefighters, under the coordination of an officer from the Rochefort station, dispatched a marking vehicle, a pumper and an ambulance. Another ambulance, leaving from the Beauraing station, was called for reinforcement. Reassuring news Among the victims, we find the wife and son of Benoit Closson, the mayor of Wellin. In the aftermath of this accident, the news is rather reassuring. “After 24 hours under surveillance in the pediatric department, my son was able to leave the hospital this Thursday evening, he emphasizes . For my wife Sylvie, the doctors detected a pulmonary hematoma. For the moment, its condition and parameters are stable. A follow-up scan will take place on Friday at the end of the day and we will then see if she will be able to leave the hospital.” According to Benoit Closson, the circumstances of the accident are clear. “My wife came from Rocheforthe emphasizes. After hitting the stop sign, she got onto the road. The other vehicle arrived at high speed according to several witnesses and hit my wife’s vehicle. In the future, I plead for this particularly accident-prone place to be secured by suitable road developments in order to avoid future tragedies.” At the time of writing, the state of health of the person in the other vehicle was not known. Note that Sylvie Brasseur, the wife of Benoit Closson, is also manager of the Closson pharmacy in Pondrôme (Beauraing).

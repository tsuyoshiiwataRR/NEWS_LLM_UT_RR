    "text": "Florida has long been home to an unnatural assortment of creatures from faraway lands and habitats, and these tourists turned permanent residents have wreaked havoc on the natural ecosystem.\nYou can thank the Burmese pythons slithering around the Everglades for the lack of marsh rabbits, and the Asian swamp eels are to blame for cratering populations of native crayfish and flagfish.\nBut what’s next?\nThat’s the subject of new research from the University of Florida, where scientists tried to predict which species could be the next contender for the Sunshine State’s most annoying new invasive.\nScientists analyzed nearly 500 potential candidates before narrowing the field to 40 species that could pose the biggest threat.\nOf those, four stood out. The UF team said the four species to watch out for next are alewife, zebra mussels, crab-eating macaques and red swamp crayfish.\n While the three marine species may not look impressive compared to the fanged beasts that draw the most headlines for their ecosystem-ruining behavior, they each could pose a real threat to Florida’s food web.\nThe report doesn’t suggest where these species might be likely to pop up next, but it does include predictions for how they might sneak into Florida, including hitchhiking on cargo containers or illegal releases from irresponsible pet owners.\nThe study mainly relies on a numerical model that scores and ranks the creatures based on their history of invading other places, how often Florida is exposed to places where they’re already invasive and if Florida is the right habitat for this species. Researchers also ran their findings past a panel of 28 experts in academia, wildlife management nonprofits and government agencies.\nAlewife\n...continued swipe to next page « 1 2 » View full story\n©2023 Miami Herald.

    "text": "Family lost their home to bushfireOwner watched house burn on TV from work READ MORE: Brisbane family loses to house fire days out from Christmas\nThe mother of a family who lost everything in a bushfire said she saw her family home burning to the ground on the TV at her work.\nJulie Moody, her husband Craig and their children were set to host Christmas this year, a plan that went out the window when their Parkerville, east Perth, home was destroyed on Thursday.\nA catastrophic bushfire in the area – of the five emergency-level fires that threatened Western Australians over Wednesday and Thursday – has reduced at least two homes to ashes.\nWhile the blaze was burning through the suburb on Thursday, Mrs Moody had checked her security cameras to see how her family’s property was holding up.\nShe was shocked to see the fire was already at their pool and inching closer towards their three-storey home.\nA family lost their Parkerville home (above) on Wednesday to the Perth Hills bushfires, just days before Christmas\nMother Julie Moody (above) said her husband just managed to rescue their family dogs from the burning home after she saw the fire creeping up on their CCTV\nMrs Moody quickly called her husband from her work and told him the house was in danger.\n‘I rang my husband and told him to race home and he managed to get through the roadblocks to get the dogs out,’ Mrs Moody told The West on Friday.\n‘He had to go through the barriers and a neighbour’s property because no one would let him in but if he didn’t do that the dogs would be gone.\n‘The verandah and home was already burning when he was there. He said it was very hot but he had to go to get the dogs out.’\nMrs Moody’s worst fears were confirmed a short time later when her colleagues showed her news footage of her home burning down.\nWhile the family is grateful no-one was injured and their dogs made it out safe, they’ve been left with nothing but the clothes on their backs.\nMs Moody said she watched news footage of her house (above) burning down from TV at work\n‘It’s devastating. It’s heartbreaking. The enormity of it is just unbelievable,’ Mrs Moody said.\nThe family lost their home, shed, and several cars in the inferno – including the rally car driven by their son, Sam.\nFamily friend, Kelly Thomas, has started a GoFundMe to help the family financially recover.\n‘Craig, Julie and kids are kind, caring, hardworking humans who would do anything to help anyone in need,’ the post reads.\n‘Some would know them from rallying. Their youngest, Sam, is an aspiring rally driver who has just lost his race car and all his spares!\n‘Let’s help the Moody’s get back on their feet for what will be a very tough Christmas and few months/years ahead.’\nThe family lost their home, shed, and several cars in the inferno – including the rally car driven by their son, Sam\nThe fundraiser has collected 63 donations worth $7,960 within its first 12 hours.\nThe cause of the devastating Perth Hills fire has been pinpointed to a tree that fell on a power-line during strong winds at about 9.30am on Thursday.\nHot, dry winds in the regions fed the flames and it moved too quickly for firefighters to contain.",

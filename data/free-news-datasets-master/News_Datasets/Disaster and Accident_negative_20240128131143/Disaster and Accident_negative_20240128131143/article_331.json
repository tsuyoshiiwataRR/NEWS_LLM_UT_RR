    "text": "BIG JET TV has captured an American Airlines Boeing 777 in an extremely bumpy landing at London’s Heathrow Airport. The Boeing 777 made the bumpy landing at London’s Heathrow airport on Wednesday, as Storm Gerrit caused heavy winds to batter parts of the UK. According to Big Jet TV there were “strong, gusting crosswind elements catching out even the most seasoned pilots!” Travel was disrupted, and houses and vehicles were damaged in some places, with emergency services working to clear the affected areas. [JOIN: AirlineRatings.com YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC50HncADHlXWDWPAh5oyasw) [GET: Accurate MH370 Information From AirlineRatings.com Newsletter](https://www.airlineratings.com/newsletter/) Airlineratings.com is packed with information about air travel and answers questions that many of us may have thought of, but didn’t know who to ask. Well, now you do! Airlineratings.com was developed to provide everyone in the world with a one-stop shop for everything related to airlines, formed by a team of aviation editors, who have forensically researched nearly every airline in the world. Our rating system is rated from one to seven stars on safety – with seven being the highest ranking. Within each airline, you will find the country of origin, airline code, booking URL and seat map information. The rating system takes into account a number of different factors related to audits from aviation’s governing bodies, lead associations as well as the airline’s own safety data. Every airline has a safety rating breakdown so you can see exactly how they rate. Over 230 of the airlines on the site that carry 99 per cent of the world’s passengers have a product rating. Given that low-cost, regional and full-service carriers are so different we have constructed a different rating system for each which can be found within each airline.",

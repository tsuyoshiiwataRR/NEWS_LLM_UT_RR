    "text": "Some 538 people with flu and 282 with Covid-19 were treated in emergency departments this week\nThe number of people attending emergency departments with Covid-19 infections doubled this week, with 54 outbreaks of the disease reported in hospitals and nursing homes across the country.\nThere was also a 72 percent increase in the number of patients presenting with flu in the past seven days, and the Health Service Executive (HSE) has warned that infection numbers are likely to continue rising in the coming weeks.\nSome 538 people with flu and 282 with Covid-19 were treated in emergency departments this week, compared to 312 and 144 respectively during the preceding seven days.\nThe HSE has said everyone must play their part to protect hospitals from becoming overwhelmed.\n“Hospitals and community services around the country have put a sustained effort into ensuring hospitals are positioned for the traditional post-Christmas demand,” said a spokesperson.\n“However, the rise in flu and Covid infection is very steep, and we would urge the public to attend the ED only for major health emergencies. Use all other options in non-emergency situations.”\nPeople are advised to use their local pharmacies and visit the HSE.ie website before going to their GP or ED if they have respiratory symptoms. The HSE is also advising people to get vaccinated at their GP clinic or pharmacy.\n“If you are unwell, you should stay at home until 48 hours after your major symptoms have resolved; avoid visiting people who are more vulnerable if you are unwell, especially avoid visiting hospitals or nursing homes.”\nDr Colm Henry, the HSE’s chief clinical officer, said the rise in flu and Covid rates in the coming weeks would put “significant pressure” on hospitals and residential care facilities.\n“Our emergency departments are expected to encounter significant pressures as a result and we know from experience that a delayed peak in flu season such as we are seeing now, will inevitably lead to further pressures throughout the healthcare system with heightened risk of outbreaks in all facilities and delays discharging patients to nursing homes or step down facilities if they have flu or Covid,” he said.\n“Vaccination remains the best way to reduce the incidence of these respiratory illnesses. The HSE is urging every eligible person to get vaccinated against flu and Covid as soon as possible.”\nThe new JN.1 variant of Covid-19 is fast becoming the dominant strain, and is more transmissible, resulting in more infections, according to Dr Éamonn O’Moore, director of national health promotion.\n“We are still collating data in Ireland and internationally on whether it will result in more illness requiring hospital care but at this time we are not seeing that signal. However, with more infection around, there is greater risk some people who are vulnerable could become ill and require hospital care and we still need to protect our vulnerable members of society, children and adults, by doing what we can to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.”\nJoin the Irish Mirror’s breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

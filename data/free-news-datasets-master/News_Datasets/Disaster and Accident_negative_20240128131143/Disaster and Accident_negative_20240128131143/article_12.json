    "text": "Severe storms smash the east coastThousands left without power in Queensland READ MORE: Severe thunderstorms forecast for parts of Australia on Christmas\nAustralia’s east coast is continuing to battle ‘very dangerous storms’, with thousands of homes losing power on Christmas Eve.\nFootage from Kensington, in Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs, shows vehicles stranded in flash floods after a thunderstorm swept across the city on Sunday.\nThe video taken by a bus passenger captures commuters standing on their seat as the floor becomes covered with flowing water.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) warned that storms – causing heavy winds, rain and hail – could continue to hit the nation’s east until Boxing Day, putting a dampener on Christmas.\nEnergex reports almost 57,000 Queensland homes were without power at 3.30pm while about 151,000 struck the state’s southeast in two hours.\nAustralia’s east coast is currently battling through severe storms as tens of thousands of homes in Queensland have lost power (stock image)\nThose travelling out of Sydney Airport for the holidays had their flights delayed after 110mm of rain fell in about an hour causing flash flooding in the domestic terminal’s apron area, where aircraft are parked to let passengers board and alight.\nThe flooding affected flights on Sunday afternoon with ‘a number of arriving services delayed’, a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.\nWhile both departing and arriving flights are now operating as expected, ‘passengers are encouraged to leave plenty of time for their journey to the airport’.\nBOM warned of severe thunderstorms that are likely to produce damaging winds, large hailstones and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding on Sunday night across Sydney and along NSW’s South and North Coast.\nMeanwhile, severe thunderstorms are also forecast for Queensland residents in Redland City, Brisbane City and parts of Logan, Somerset, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Moreton Bay and Ipswich Council Areas.\nThe Brisbane Valley Highway northbound in Coominya was partially closed due to multiple trees down at 12.30pm, with drivers urged to seek an alternative route.\nQueensland Police have also warned there had been reports of fallen, trees, power lines down and flash flooding across southeast Queensland, including Holland Park, Tamborine Mountain, Elimbah, Beenleigh, Russell Island, Upper Coomera, Toowong, Scenic Rim, Marsden, Logan, Carina, Greenbank and the Gold Coast.\nSydney experienced heavy rainfall on Sunday afternoon causing the city’s eastern suburbs to be hit with flash flooding which trapped cars (pictured)\nOne vehicle stranded on Anzac Parade in Kensington had to be freed by SES (pictured)\nEmergency crews are working hard to remove a fallen tree on Frederick St, Toowong, which has impacted power lines.\n‘A crane will be required to remove the tree with road likely closed until early hours of Christmas morning,’ Queensland Police stated.\nAngus Hines, senior meteorologist at BOM, said Australia’s eastern states were in the ‘middle of the thunderstorm outbreak’.\n‘With potential severe weather over the next dew days there is the high chance for flash flooding,’ NSW SES warned.\n‘With people on the roads for Christmas we ask that you make smart decisions and if it’s flooded forget it.’\nThe latest warning stated people in Southeast Coast and parts of Central Highlands and Coalfields, Central West, Wide Bay and Burnett, Maranoa and Warrego and Darling Downs and Granite Belt Forecast Districts need to be on alert for thunderstorms.\nFlights in and out of Sydney Airport were affected by the thunderstorm after 110mm fell in about an hour causing flash flooding at the domestic terminal (pictured)\nNSW Police blocked off traffic to Botany Road in Mascot as flash floods had grown to engulf the sidewalk\nA severe thunderstorm north of Crows Nest that dumped large hailstones and heavy rainfall at just past 1pm before moving east over Gladstone.\nAn upper trough is moving over southeast Queensland and is causing thunderstorm activity in a moist and unstable air mass,’ BOM said.\n‘Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding, damaging winds and large hailstones in the warning area over the next several hours.’\nLocations which may also be affected include Toowoomba, Brisbane, Dalby, Kingaroy, Ipswich and Nanango.\nAnother very dangerous thunderstorm is also developing west of Kilcoy, threatening parts of Somerset, South Burnett, Toowoomba and Moreton Bay Council Areas.\nIntense bouts of rainfall could create dangerous and life-threatening flash-flooding near the Samford and the D’Aguilar Ranges, with the thunderstorm moving in a north-easterly direction.\nResidents are urged to not drive, and stay indoors until the storm has passed. People should also avoid standing near doors and windows during giant hail.\nAsthma sufferers are also urged to keep medication nearby, as storms and wind can trigger attacks.\nNSW SES has warned those taking to the roads on Christmas Day to stay vigilant as the Bureau of Meteorology predicts storms to continue into Monday (pictured)\nFootage from a bus passenger travelling along Anzac Parade shows them having to stand on their seat as the floor of the bus was covered in water as it traversed the flash floods (pictured)\nAreas across Queensland are expected to receive large amounts of rain in short periods of time and even hail across Sunday and Monday (pictured)\nMeanwhile, The BOM have issued a warning for the Pilbara, Gascoyne, North Interior and South Interior Districts, where temperatures could reach up to 45C.\nFelim Hanniffy, senior forecaster at the Bureau, said the storms would continue across the East Coast until Boxing Day.\n‘That means the risk of giant hail, destructive wind gusts and intense rainfall and it’s all being driven by a really significant weather system,’ he said.\n‘That’s going to affect multiple states, so Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, and is linked to a developing low pressure system that’s going to spin up over parts of Victoria and southern New South Wales and then slowly move east and eventually off the coast during about Tuesday.\n‘That includes the high demographic areas of Newcastle, Sydney, and even Canberra, as well as down to Victoria and Melbourne.’\nThe alert is currently in place until Boxing Day.",

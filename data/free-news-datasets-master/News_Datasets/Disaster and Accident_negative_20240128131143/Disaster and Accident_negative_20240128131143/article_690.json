    "text": "GAZA STRIP (AFP) – Israeli forces pressed on with intensified attacks in the Gaza Strip’s biggest southern city and a central refugee camp, after the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry reported more than 21,000 people had been killed in 11 weeks of war. The continued air strikes and the expansion of operations in the south came as the World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Wednesday that Gaza’s population was in grave peril, with France’s president calling for a long-term ceasefire. Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Wednesday that strikes on a central refugee camp in Gaza had entered a third day, and that an additional brigade had been deployed to the southern city of Khan Yunis, the recent focus of heavy urban combat. He also hinted at a possible expansion of fighting in the north along the Lebanese border, which has seen repeated exchanges of fire between Israeli troops and Hezbollah militants since the war in Gaza broke out. Following a visit to the border earlier in the day, army chief Herzi Halevi said the military had “approved plans for a variety of contingencies, and we need to be prepared to strike if required”. Israel has repeatedly vowed to keep up its campaign to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its bloody October 7 attack, which left about 1,140 people dead, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Israel’s relentless bombardment and ground invasion have killed at least 21,110 people, mostly women and children, according to the latest toll from Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry. The army announced the deaths of three more soldiers yesterday morning, bringing the total killed in Gaza to 167. Calls for an end to the hostilities continued to mount on Wednesday, with French President Emmanuel Macron emphasising in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “the need to work towards a lasting ceasefire”. He also expressed his deepest concern at the very heavy civilian toll in Gaza, his office said in a statement, adding that France would be working with Jordan to carry out humanitarian operations in the territory in the coming days. Since Israel imposed a siege at the outset of the war, Gazans have faced severe shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus echoed calls for a ceasefire on Wednesday. He pressed the international community to take “urgent steps to alleviate the grave peril facing the population of Gaza and jeopardising the ability of humanitarian workers to help people with terrible injuries, acute hunger, and at severe risk of disease”.",

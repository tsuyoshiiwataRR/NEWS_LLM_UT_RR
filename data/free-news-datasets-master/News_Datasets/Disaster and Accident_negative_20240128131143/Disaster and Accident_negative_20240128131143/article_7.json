    "text": "Woman forced to beg for early access to super Her apartment has several dangerous defects She is now behind $39,000 in strata payments READ MORE: Construction company run by famous developer family collapses\nA Melbourne woman’s desperate plea to access her superannuation after 10 years of defects in her apartment left her financially ruined has been denied by red tape.\nConstruction company Shangri-La Construction went into liquidation at the end of March shortly after completing 10 residential unit blocks across Melbourne.\nMany residents were in the process of suing for defective building work when the company collapsed – with customers forced to foot the bill for repairs themselves.\nMother-of-one Tamara Railton-Stewart, 48, bought her two-bedroom, two-bathroom Shangri-La apartment for $649,000 in 2014, news.com.au reports.\nIn December 2015 – after just one month of living in the unit – several leaks appeared after Melbourne was inundated with heavy rain.\nThe family were forced to live in the mould-riddled apartment during Covid lockdowns with the fed-up resident certain it was one of the factors that caused her then 16-month-old daughter to be diagnosed as asthmatic.\nDespite receiving a $2million insurance payout to cover some of the defects over a 10-year period the homeowner is still $39,000 behind in strata payments.\nMelbourne mother-of-one Tamara Railton-Stewart, 48, bought her two-bedroom, two-bathroom Shangri-La apartment for $649,000 in 2014\nCancer-survivor Ms Railton-Smith has requested early access to her superannuation on compassionate grounds but has been rejected three times since February.\nIn response to her pleading letters, the Australian Treasury said she doesn’t meet the requirements because her bank has yet to threaten to repossess her home.\nShe also lived elsewhere for a period of time due to the mould, meaning the unit is not considered her principal place of residence by the government.\n‘I think people in my position should have access to their super,’ she said.\n‘I am not asking for a handout, but simply access to my own money.’\nThe resident is particularly furious that she can’t access her retirement funds while other Australians are reportedly using a loophole to access superannuation to pay for cosmetic treatments like a breast augmentation or liposuction.\nIn March, the Albanese government was forced to issue an extraordinary warning that cosmetic surgeons were preying on Australians by encouraging them to blow their retirement savings on beauty procedures.\nAssistant Treasurer Stephen Jones used the example in justifying why the Labor government plans to make it harder for Australians to withdraw their super.\nConstruction company Shangri-La Construction went into liquidation at the end of March (pictured, men work on a construction site in Melbourne)\nEarly access to superannuation is allowed in situations where someone is permanently incapacitated, has a physical or mental condition that stops them from working, is dying or their loved one is.\nSevere financial hardship is also another reason for early access but the onus on the individual to prove they need the cash desperately to their superannuation fund.\nHowever, under current laws the Treasurer or any member of parliament has the power to approve the release of an individual’s superannuation.\nMs Railton-Smith was advised to seek the advice of a financial counsellor.\nThe Melbourne resident said surviving cancer was ‘easier’ than her 10-year battle over the Shangri-La apartment.\n‘I would go through cancer 10 times over to never relive the nightmare of this apartment ever again,’ she said.\nA separate from another block of Shangri-La units was for $10million worth of damages including cladding problems and water leaks.",

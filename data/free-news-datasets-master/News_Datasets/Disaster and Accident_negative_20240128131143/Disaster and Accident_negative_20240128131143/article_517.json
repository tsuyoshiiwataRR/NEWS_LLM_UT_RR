    "text": "[Shaquille O’Neal’s](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/614/shaquille-o%27neal) poignant revelation serves as a stark reminder of life’s fragility, urging everyone to cherish their loved ones without delay. In a 2022 appearance on Logan Paul’s Impaulsive podcast, O’Neal shared profound advice prompted by his own painful experiences. The retired NBA star, known for his busy schedule, admitted to a habit of procrastination. However, this changed dramatically after two tragic phone calls within three months. In October 2019, he received the devastating news of his sister Ayesha Harrison-Jex losing her battle with cancer. Despite overcoming the disease twice before, she succumbed at the age of 40. Then, in January 2020, while working out with his son Shaqir, O’Neal learned of the tragic helicopter accident that claimed the lives of his former teammate Kobe Bryant, Kobe’s daughter Gianna, and seven others.

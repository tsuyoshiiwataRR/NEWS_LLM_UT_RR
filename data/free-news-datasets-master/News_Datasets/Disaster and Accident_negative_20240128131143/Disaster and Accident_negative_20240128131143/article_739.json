    "text": "Rescue crews helped an injured woman back to safety after she fell down an embankment Thursday morning on Northeast Hazel Dell Avenue, just north of Vancouver city limits.\nThe 43-year-old woman, whose name was not released, was taken to an area hospital for treatment of injuries that were not considered life threatening, according to Dave Schmitke, a spokesman for Clark County Fire District 6.\nFire District 6 responded at 6:58 a.m. to a call for a fall at Hazel Dell Avenue and Alki Road.\nWhile those types of calls are common for the agency, Schmitke said the response quickly became challenging.\nFire crews arrived to find the woman — a resident of a nearby homeless encampment — had fallen down the muddy hillside and was unable to move. They learned the woman had fallen elsewhere days prior, and she was in a great deal of pain Thursday morning, according to Schmitke.\nThe Vancouver Fire Department and Clark County’s Technical Rescue Team, a regional team that comprises Fire District 6, Vancouver Fire and Clark-Cowlitz Fire Rescue, also responded.\nRescue crews secured the woman to a backboard, Schmitke said, and used a rope system to haul her up the embankment.\nSchmitke said the rescue operation took about an hour; he called it a team effort.",

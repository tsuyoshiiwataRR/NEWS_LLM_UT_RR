THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-Greg Cruse **MANDATORY CREDIT** Delta Fire and Rescue Deputy Chief Dave Wood says the crash caused a “secondary accident” involving another vehicle.\nHe says crews were called to the scene at 12:14 p.m. and he didn’t know of any injuries.\nPhotos of the aftermath of the incident posted on social media show large girders on the bed of a truck with another laying across the highway along with other debris.\nProvincial statistics say as many as 30 bridge strikes have happened on British Columbia’s highways since 2021, with 16 of them reported last year alone.\nThe new rules, announced Dec. 14, include the requirement for dump-style vehicles to have in-cab warning devices by next June, telling drivers if their trailer hasn’t been lowered.\nOver-height vehicle fines will increase to $575, up from $115.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nAdvertisement Advertise With Us\nTweet Share Print Email Read Later",

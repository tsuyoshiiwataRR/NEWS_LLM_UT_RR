    "text": "Daughters unwrapped presents while she restedShe bought the gifts the night beforeREAD MORE: Horror crash kills parents on Christmas day\nA young mother-of-four has tragically died while her daughters unwrapped their presents on Christmas Day.\nAshley Stanik told her ex-boyfriend and father of her children, Kane, she wasn’t feeling well and needed to lie down.\nMs Stanik asked Mr Stanik to film the girl’s reaction opening their gifts while she got some rest at her home in Deception Bay, 40km north of Brisbane.\nThe 33-year-old, however, died while her children aged 17, 12, 8, and 4 were opening their presents which she had packed and placed under the Christmas tree the night before.\nHer sister-in-law Cassandra said the family are struggling to come to terms with Ms Stanik’s death as there were no signs she was unwell.\nAshley Stanik (pictured centre) suddenly died on Christmas Day as her children unwrapped presents\n‘There was no indication that there was anything wrong, which makes it even harder to comprehend,’ she told the Courier Mail.\nCassandra said Ms Stanik was out shopping for presents on Christmas Eve and had a busy start to the morning the next day.\n‘She had been up for a couple of hours in the morning, but went back to sleep to see if she could sleep it off,’ Cassandra said.\n‘My brother, Kane went in to wake her around 2.30pm, but it was too late. She had already left us’.\nMs Stanik’s daughter’s are reeling from their mother’s death and are now with their father.\nMr Stanik cannot afford to pay for the funeral costs as he is receiving a disability pension.\nThe family also don’t know who will own the house which was registered under the name of Ms Stanik.\nThe mother-of-four (pictured centre) asked her ex-partner to film the excited reactions of her daughters opening their presents but she passed away as they were opening their gifts\nCassnadra said Mr Stanik had spent most of his time at the home looking after his daughter’s so that he could make it easier for them to stay together as a family.\nShe set up a GoFundMe page on Tuesday in a bid to raise money to pay for Ms Stanik’s funeral.\n‘[We are] wanting to raise money for funeral and help her 4 (sic) children, sadly she left us on Christmas Day,’ she wrote.\n‘They (children) are left to say goodbye with no one knowing how to pay [for the] funeral and how much help these children are going to need to some what (sic) get back to normal.’",

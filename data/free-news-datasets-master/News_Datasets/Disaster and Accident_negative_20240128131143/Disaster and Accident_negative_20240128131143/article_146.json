    "text": "Manpower Ministry Proposes OHS Law Revision Post Morowali Smelter Explosion Translator Editor 28 December 2023 19:53 WIB TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The Indonesian Manpower Ministry has proposed a revision to the law on occupational health and safety (OHS or locally K3) following a furnace explosion at the nickel smelter of the Indonesia Tsingshan Stainless Steel (ITSS), a subsidiary of China's Tsingshan Group, in Morowali, Central Sulawesi. Deputy Manpower Minister Afriansyah Noor stated that the ministry was still investigating the cause of the blast, which occurred on Sunday, December 24, 2023. “If there is any negligence and intent, we will act by the criminal law,” he told Tempo on Thursday, December 28, 2023. He argued that the Law No. 1 of 1970 on occupational safety is weak and outdated as it refers to conditions in 1970. “The prison sentence is only three months, and the fine is only Rp100,000,” Afriansyah added. Moreover, he said, President Joko Widodo or Jokowi's government is focusing on downstreaming. “This means that there is huge industrial investment which leads to large employment,” he said. The furnace at PT ITSS smelter exploded at around 05:30 local time on Sunday, killing at least 18 workers and injuring 41 others. Following the explosion, workers who are members of a labor union, Aliansi Poros Buruh, staged a demonstration in front of the Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP) on Wednesday, December 27, 2023, where PT ITSS is based.

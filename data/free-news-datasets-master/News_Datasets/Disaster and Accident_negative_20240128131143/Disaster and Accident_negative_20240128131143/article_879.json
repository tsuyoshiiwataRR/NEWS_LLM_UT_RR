    "text": "2023-12-27 13:08:00\n(Central News Agency reporter Dai Yazhen, Tokyo, 27th) Japan’s fixed Christmas menu includes KFC and strawberry cake, but this year a tragedy occurred at Takashimaya Department Store’s strawberry cake, and many customers received cakes that were not what they looked like. Takashimaya said today that the arrival of strawberries this year was too hasty, which shortened the freezing time after the cake was made, but it was unable to trace the exact cause.\nEating Kentucky Fried Chicken and strawberry cake on Christmas is an unwritten culture in Japan. Every Christmas Eve, you can see various cake shops selling beautifully decorated strawberry cakes, and there are even long queues in front of famous stores. However, modern people value efficiency, and many people choose home delivery.\nHowever, Takashimaya Department Store’s strawberry cakes were out of stock this year. Many customers opened the cartons and found that the cakes had fallen over. The minor damage might only be bruises, but the more serious ones could turn into a big lump of strawberry cake puree. Even though Christmas has passed, events continue to unfold.\nThe Sankei Shimbun reported that Takashimaya held a press conference today and stated that some Christmas cakes sold online were damaged when they arrived. Investigations into manufacturing and distribution have yet to determine the exact cause. However, Takashimaya will fully accept refunds or exchanges.\n“We deeply apologize for failing to live up to the expectations of many customers and causing trouble,” Takashimaya’s head of sales, Kazuhisa Yokoyama, said at a press conference.\nThe problem occurred with a fresh cream strawberry cake priced at 5,400 yen (approximately NT$1,200). The cake was decorated with cream ruffles around the edges and had many strawberry slices on top. This cake is on sale for the second consecutive year, with 2,831 sold last year and 2,879 this year. As of 8 pm on the 26th, 1,207 inquiries had been received, of which 807 had damaged cakes.\nThis cake was supervised by a French restaurant in Yokohama City and commissioned to be produced by a company in Hanyu City, Saitama Prefecture. Yamato, which contracted Takashimaya’s transportation business, transported and refrigerated home delivery.\nSubscribe to the “International News” e-newsletter to grasp the latest pulse of the world first-hand\nsubscription\nTakashimaya said that due to the delayed arrival of strawberries this year, the freezing time of the prepared cakes has been significantly shortened compared to last year. Last year the freezing time was about 2 weeks, but this year it was shortened by 20 to 25 hours. However, no problems were found in prior freezing tests and sample inspections on the way.\nTakashimaya said it would be impossible to completely recreate the conditions of that day and conduct the experiment again. Yokoyama said, “It is impossible to clearly find the specific cause of the problem that day,” but he will strengthen supply chain quality control in the future, “pay special attention to cakes with shapes that are prone to collapse.” (Editor: Chen Huizhen) 1121227\nCentral News Agency “First-hand News” app\nThe text, pictures and videos on this website may not be reproduced, publicly broadcast or publicly transmitted and used without authorization.\nRead more: Immigrate to the UK | A good dad prepares a loving meal box, the woman cried and complained that she brought rice balls and fried noodles, and there were no classmates to accompany her to eat\n1703805716\n#Japans #Takashimaya #Department #Store #strawberry #cake #tragedy #suspected #shortening #freezing #time #International #Central #News #Agency #CNA",

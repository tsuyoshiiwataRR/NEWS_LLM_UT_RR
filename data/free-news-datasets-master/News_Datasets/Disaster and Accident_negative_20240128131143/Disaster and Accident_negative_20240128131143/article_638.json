    "text": "EL PASO COUNTY, Colo. (KRDO) - The lone survivor of a triple-murder suicide near Peyton is speaking for the first time about how he escaped his brother's rampage. On Dec. 7. the El Paso County Sheriff's Office responded to an overnight shooting on Akawi Way near Peyton. There, deputies found four people dead and one injured. They were identified as 54-year-old Desiree N. Vandelac, 57-year-old Robert V. Vandelac, and 30-year-old Debray A. Scott. The Sheriff's Office says it's investigating those deaths as victims of homicide. However, 22-year-old Peyton S. Vandelac, who was also found dead inside the residence, was not listed as a homicide victim. In a KRDO13 Exclusive, Tyler Vanelac, the lone survivor, explains what led up to the deadly event and how he escaped. Tyler says that it all started on Dec. 6 at their family home. He and his brother Peyton were watching movies in the basement, and he says Peyton had been drinking heavily that night. Tyler says Peyton started arguing with him over just trying to fix their dog's water fountain. Tyler says Peyton charged him and began fighting, Tyler dislocated his shoulder in the process and that his parents started criticizing Peyton for hurting him. As Tyler was getting ready to go to the hospital to fix his shoulder, he heard loud bangs upstairs. It was then he discovered his parents on the floor in the hallway, and his brother wiping what looked like a knife, on the pant leg of their father. His friend, Debray Scott, was in the basement, watching the movies with them. He too would later be found dead. Now Tyler continues to live in the same home along with his dogs and cat while trying to reconcile with what happened. \"My brother seemed completely stable the entire rest of the day up until this moment and I don't know how someone goes from being a completely stable human being to triple homicide and suicide over some rum,\" Tyler said. The autopsies are still being conducted by the El Paso County Coroner's office, and the Sheriff's Office says its investigation continues.

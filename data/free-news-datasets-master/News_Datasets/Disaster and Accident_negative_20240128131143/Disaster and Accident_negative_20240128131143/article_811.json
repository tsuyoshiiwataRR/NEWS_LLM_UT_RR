With 85% of Gazans displaced from their homes as well, the UN says “the only remaining hope is a humanitarian ceasefire.”\n90: Around 90% of the money that foreign investors poured into the Chinese stock market in 2023 has already been\nwithdrawn, amounting to around $30 billion dollars in outflow. Investors seem spooked by the ongoing turmoil in the property market, and despite improving metrics, may not see a long-term upside to keeping their money in China.\n568: Britons, rejoice! The\npromised freedoms of Brexit are finally materializing, as pubs and restaurants will once again be able to serve 568 mL portions of wine, a quantity otherwise known as a British pint (not to be confused with the pitiful 473 mL Yankee pint). European Union rules had forced the proud British tippler to take their wine in half-liter portions, like some Frenchman. Cheers! To 68 milliliters of liberty! 21-foot tall bronze statueof its most famous daughter, pop queen Shakira. A member of Colombia’s large ethnic Lebanese community, Shakira developed her signature “hips don’t lie” dance style in the city by introducing Lebanese belly-dancing alongside other styles in Colombia’s rich repertoire.",

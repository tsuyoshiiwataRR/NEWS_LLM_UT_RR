    "text": "MEXICO, Maine (WGME) -- The aftermath of last week's devastating storm still being felt in the western Maine mountains. In the Town of Mexico, the storm brought the swift river into the streets flooding homes and businesses, including the town's post office. \"I just came to mail a letter and was quite surprised that it's still not open yet because of all the damage,\" said Nora Downs. It's unclear how severe the flooding damage inside the post office was but facility has been closed since December 18th. Those who live in and around the small town say they often rely on this post office and that it's normally busy. \"I come here a lot,\" said Julie Melanson. \"If I'm going that way I go to Rumford and if I go this way I go to Mexico. I have options but a lot of people don't have those kind of options.\" ALSO READ | [MaineDOT foresees weeks of work and multimillion-dollar cost for storm repair](https://wgme.com/news/local/mainedot-foresees-weeks-of-work-and-multimillion-dollar-cost-for-storm-repair-maine-wind-flooding-rain-power-outages#) ALSO READ | [ 'It's very important': Search continues for irreplaceable items taken down river during flooding in Lewiston](https://wgme.com/news/local/its-very-important-search-continues-for-irreplaceable-items-taken-down-river-during-flooding-in-lewiston-maine-veterans-memorial-park-casket-floodwaters-rain-wind-storm-androscoggin-river#) In a letter to customer last week, the U.S. Postal Service said the building will remain closed while they \"evaluate potential solutions.\" Some in town fear that could mean the post office may never reopen but the USPS says no final decision has been made on that front yet. In the meantime, as the community in Mexico continues to recover from the impacts of the flood, including the deaths of two people in town, the hope is that even small things like having an open post office can help them move forward. \"I hope people will work together to help each other and mend this sad situation,\" Downs said.",

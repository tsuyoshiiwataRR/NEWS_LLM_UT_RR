    "text": "An Airbus A330 charter flight operating from Barbados to Manchester was forced to divert to Bermuda after severe and unexpected turbulence injured many onboard, resulting in 11 passengers being hospitalized.\nA330 Diverts To Bermuda After Severe Turbulence\nOn December 23, 2023 Maleth Aero flight DB1975 took off from Bridgetown International Airport (BGI) in Barbados bound for to Manchester International (MAN). The flight was operated by an Airbus A330-200 (registration 9H-MFS). 225 passengers and 13 crewmembers were onboard.\nOver the Atlantic, the aircraft hit unexpected and severe turbulence, sending people and objects flying through the cabin. The turbulence was so severe that injuries were reported and the captain opted to divert to LF Wade International Airport (BDA) in Bermuda. The airport released the following\nstatement:\n“At approximately 12:50, Maleth Aero Flight 1975, an Airbus A330-200, en route from Barbados to Manchester, experienced severe turbulence, necessitating an emergency landing at LF Wade International Airport…\n“Emergency Medical Technicians from the Bermuda Fire & Rescue Service [BFRS] greeted the aircraft to provide initial assessments of the passengers and pre-hospital care.\n“The response included nine BFRS vehicles, two King Edward Memorial Hospital VII ambulances and 20 BFRS personnel.\n“Eleven passengers were subsequently transported to the Emergency Department at the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital by the BFRS for further medical evaluation and treatment…\n“As a precautionary measure, the aircraft will remain grounded until a comprehensive inspection has been completed, ensuring the safety and integrity of the aircraft.”\nIndeed, the aircraft remains grounded in Bermuda, with many passengers missing Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day as a result.\nMaleth Aero is a Maltese charter airline and was operating on behalf of P&O Cruises.\nCONCLUSION\nA Maleth Aero A330 remains on the ground in Bermuda after an emergency landing prompted by severe turbulence over the Atlantic.\nAs always, the takeaway from these stories is to fasten your seatbelt when seated on an aircraft, even if the seatbelt light is off. Turbulence can be unexpected and extreme: better to fasten up on the plane than to be fastened down to a gurney.\nimage:\nSteve Knight",

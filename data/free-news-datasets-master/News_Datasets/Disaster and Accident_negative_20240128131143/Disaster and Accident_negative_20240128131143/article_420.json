    "text": "A [GoFundMe](https://gofund.me/45172cb3) has been set up for a Canyon Country man who was killed after being fatally struck by a drunk driver last week. A GoFundMe has been set up for Eddie Meadows, 53, a Santa Clarita native, son, father and uncle, who was killed after being [fatally struck by a DUI driver](https://www.hometownstation.com/santa-clarita-news/crime/canyon-country-man-fatally-struck-by-presumed-drunk-driver-491771) on Sierra Highway near Sand Canyon on Dec. 21. “Our family is heartbroken and (has) many unanswered questions as to why this had to happen in such a tragic way.” said the GoFundMe. “There were no goodbyes, prayers, hugs or a chance to tell him that we loved him. His life was unexpectedly taken from him.” On Dec. 21, California Highway Patrol (CHP) received reports of a traffic collision involving a pedestrian on Sierra Highway. At approximately 6:10 p.m., Meadows was pronounced deceased at the scene, said Officer Josh Greengard, spokesperson for the California Highway Patrol Newhall Area Office. During the investigation, it was determined the driver of the Silverado was under the influence at the time of the collision, according to Greengard. Hector Castillo, 38, from Newhall, was arrested for felony DUI, according to Greengard. As of Thursday, $960 of the $8,000 goal has been raised.

They opened their doors in October. Jay Capistrano, co-owner of the business, says when they were notified of the water main break and its impact, they immediately jumped into action. Watch: [NOWCAST streaming newscasts](https://www.wxii12.com/nowcast) \"It's going to be hard to access restrooms. So we do have porta potties already set and ready right in the back,\" Capistrano said. \"And also, just to limit the amount of dishwashing, we're going to be using our disposable cups and things like that.\" The water main break happens during a big event for the business. \"What we don't want to do is cancel the event just like that,\" Capistrano said. \"We have a lot of people that's been excited about this event. And we don't want to turn people down.\" Two westbound lanes from Church Street to Davie Street are also closed. City crews are on site until repairs are complete and lanes reopened, which is expected to take place by 11:45 p.m. Thursday night. Signs and traffic cones are in place, and motorists are urged to use alternate routes to avoid the area.

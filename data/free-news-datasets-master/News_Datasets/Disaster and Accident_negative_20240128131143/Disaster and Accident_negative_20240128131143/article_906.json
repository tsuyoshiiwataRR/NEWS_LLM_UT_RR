    "text": "The unexpected incident raised alarms about what will happen in the future if machines continue to evolve.\nRobots,\ntechnology, science, future. Photo: Unsplash\nOne of humanity’s greatest fears came true.Just like in the scene from the Will Smith movie, “I, Robot”, a machine attacked a Tesla engineer and set off alarms about eThe disturbing future that awaits us if\ntechnology continues to advance.\nAlthough the incident occurred two years ago, it recently came to light because the\nUnited States regulatory body presented the history of injured employees in Elon Musk’s factories.\nThe incident occurred when the worker in question was starting his round of daily tasks on three robots, without realizing that not all of them were turned off, one of the machines continued operating and He pushed the man against a surface, plunged his metal claws into his body and caused serious injuries.\nRobots,\ntechnology, science, future. Photo: Unsplash\nLuckily for the victim, another employee saw what was happening and managed to turn off the robot with a power button, allowing the worker to free himself and survive the attack.\nAfter coming to light, the\nnews went viral on social networks and sparked terror and uncertainty about a possible future operated by machines that could be altered at any moment and harm humanity, as happened in the film directed by Alex Proyas, “I, Robot.”\nIt may interest you:\nLike a science fiction movie: they confirmed the date on which artificial intelligence will surpass humans\nAn event that repeats\nIt is not the first time that a machine attacks a human. In November of this year, a South Korean worker was mistaken by a robot for a box and was crushed by his great mechanical arm.\nRobots,\ntechnology, science, future. Photo: Unsplash\nIn 2021, a Kawasaki Heavy Industries employee died after a malfunctioning robot crashed into him.\nDue to the\ninternational commotion over the news, Tesla was at the center of the scene and Elon Musk came out to speak about what happened: “It is really shameful that the media mentions an accident that occurred two years ago due to a simple industrial robotic arm”, the tycoon published in X.\n2023-12-28 22:03:21\n#Saved #miracle #Tesla #engineer #attacked #company #robot",

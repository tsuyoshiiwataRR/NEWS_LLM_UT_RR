    "text": "A short circuit registered in the dormitory of the medical staff of the obstetric emergency of the Dr. Luis Razetti hospital, in the city of Barinas, generated a fire that was controlled by prevention agencies. This was reported by the regional health director; Dr. Angela Torres, who explained that action was taken in a timely manner and there were no injuries, only material damage to the bedroom. This Thursday, Torres took a tour of the place; she accompanied by Dr. Jorge Méndez; director of the facility, with the purpose of inspecting the place to take the corresponding actions. He explained that the fire occurred on Wednesday afternoon, and was controlled by commissions from the Barinas Fire Department, preventing it from spreading to other areas. He indicated that the patients who were at the site were evacuated in a timely manner and transferred to the adult emergency or the Covid area. He specified that in 72 hours the services in this area will be reactivated to care for pregnant women. “We have the support of the national government, the political liaison Jorge Arreaza and the different mayors' offices to reactivate the obstetric area within a period of 72 hours. “No injuries were reported, only material damage,” Torres reiterated. He mentioned that the cleaning and sanitation of the area is carried out with the collaboration of the mayor's office, firefighters and the Ecological Company for Development.",

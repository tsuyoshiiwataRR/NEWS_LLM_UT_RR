(Photo by Fabrizio Gandolfo/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\nStowaway apparently hides in plane's undercarriage bay for 2.5 hour flight to Paris\nDecember 28, 2023\nA stowaway apparently hid in a plane's undercarriage bay for a two-and-a-half hour flight that landed in Paris on Thursday morning.\nWhat are the details?\nCiting a security source briefed on the matter,\nReuters reported that the stowaway was found alive but in critical condition in the undercarriage bay of an Air Algeria airplane at Paris Orly airport.\nThe plane was coming from the Western Algerian town of Oran, the outlet noted.\nThe stowaway was in a life-threatening condition and being treated at a nearby hospital, Reuters added, citing the source.\nStowaways in planes' unpressurized wheelhouses and cargo holds can be subjected to temperatures ranging from -58 to -76 degrees Fahrenheit, the outlet said, as well as lack of oxygen.\nMore from Reuters:\nIn 2019, the body of a suspected stowaway fell hundreds of meters from a plane flying over southwest London, landing in the garden of a man's home, just missing him as he sunbathed.\nIn 2015, the body of a stowaway on a British Airways flight from Johannesburg to Heathrow landed on a shop in Richmond, southwest London. A second stowaway survived the 10-hour flight and was found in the undercarriage of the plane.\nHow are folks reacting?\nCommenters on a version of the Reuters story published by\nYahoo! News had plenty to say about the incident:\n- \"For the lack of any security noticing this person accessing the plane while on the tarmac you have to wonder how easy it would be for anyone else to put a bomb or [smuggle] something aboard without anyone being the wiser,\" one commenter observed.\n- \"Watch and remember my words: in the not-too-distant future, airlines will be required to install oxygen masks and 'space blankets' in the wheel wells of all of their aircraft,\" another commenter predicted. \"The 'feel good' crowd will demand it!\"\n- \"How in Godâ€™s name does someone survive up to -76 degrees Fahrenheit for two hours?\" another commenter wondered. \"Madness!\"\nLike Blaze News?

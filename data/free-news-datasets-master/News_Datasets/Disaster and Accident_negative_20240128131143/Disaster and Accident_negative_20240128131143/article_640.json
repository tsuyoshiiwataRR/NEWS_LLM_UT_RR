Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely, the Met Office said.\n‘In terms of rain, we have rain warnings out for the whole of Northern Ireland, western Wales, north-west England, and then there’s a combined sort of rain and snow warning for Scotland,’ Mr Partridge added.\nRain in the warning areas is forecast to be between 40 to 60mm, with the potential for 70 to 90mm in the western hills of Wales and the western side of the Pennines.\nThere is a chance of power cuts, as well as a small chance that homes and businesses could be flooded.\nAnywhere above 200 metres (650ft) in Scotland and the Northern Isles is likely to see some snow, he added.\nNetwork Rail Scotland warned passengers speed restrictions would be in place today and to check for cancellations.\nScotRail customer operations director Phil Campbell said: ‘Unfortunately, we expect disruption to our services due to the adverse weather, and customers can expect some changes to their journeys.\nPolice Scotland said officers in Dundee dealt with a collision on the A90 near Inchture today\nThe swollen River Severn as flood defences are put in place at Ironbridge in Shropshire today\nShoppers wait outside a Zara store in Birmingham city centre in the rain today during the sales\nA tree fell onto the railway line in the Dumbarton area this morning which then caught fire\nA wet start to the day in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, today as Storm Gerrit hits the UK\nA Traffic Scotland image of snow on the A85 road in Glen Ogle, Stirlingshire, this morning\nThe swollen River Severn as flood defences are put in place at Ironbridge in Shropshire today\nA lorry travels along the snowy A68 at Soutra this morning, south east of Edinburgh\nSnow this morning on the A9 at Drumochter, a mountain pass road in the Scottish Highlands\nThe swollen River Severn as flood defences are put in place at Ironbridge in Shropshire today\n‘We will be working closely with our colleagues at Network Rail Scotland to ensure we are able to keep people moving as much as possible, but customers should also expect that their journeys will take longer than usual, and there could be some cancellations. ‘\nThe operator added: ‘We’re asking anyone with garden equipment such as tents, trampolines or furniture, to secure items so that they don’t blow on to the tracks and interfere with lineside equipment.’\nThe RAC has warned drivers not to underestimate the dangers of high winds.\nSpokesperson Simon Williams said: ‘While high-sided vehicles are most at risk of being blown off course, car drivers can also be affected when they pass lorries on the motorway and are suddenly hit by the full force of the wind on the other side.\n‘Keeping both hands on the wheel at all times is the best advice, along with watching other vehicles very carefully so as not to get caught out by any unexpected changes in course.\n‘Getting to motorways and major roads may also be more difficult. Drivers should reduce their speeds and be on the look-out for fallen branches, and even trees, along with other debris.’\nThe RNLI urged those visiting the coast to exercise extreme caution, particularly along exposed cliffs, seafronts and piers.\nGareth Morrison, RNLI water safety partner, said: ‘The RNLI advises staying a safe distance away from the water and cliff edges as the conditions could knock you off your feet or wash you into the sea. It is not worth risking your life.’\nStein Connelly from Transport Scotland said: ‘The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for large parts of the country.\n‘We’re seeing rain across south-west Scotland, rain and wind across the central belt, and also some snow across northern Scotland.\n‘This type of weather isn’t unusual for this time of year, but yellow warnings do mean the potential for significant travel disruption and that’s what we’re seeing today across the road and rail network with ferry services also impacted.\n‘We have well-established plans with partners to respond to these conditions which are currently being progressed.\n‘Our operating companies are working hard in adverse conditions to remove fallen trees and clear roads of snow currently.’\nHe urged people to plan ahead and to drive to conditions.\nHe advised drivers to check the Traffic Scotland website for problems on trunk roads and those using public transport to check with their operators.\nLast week, people travelling for Christmas were among those affected as Storm Pia lashed parts of the UK in the countdown to the festive season.\nWinds of more than 80mph battered northern parts of the UK, with gusts of 81mph recorded at Brizlee Wood near Alnwick, Northumberland, and at Baltasound on Shetland, with 70mph gusts reported elsewhere in the North East of England.\n** Have YOU been hit by the storm?

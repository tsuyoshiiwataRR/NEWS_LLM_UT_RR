    "text": "Viral Central Florida TikTok dad battles illness in hospital Several years ago, WESH 2 introduced you to a local TikTok sensation. You might remember Chris Askew. He was the Seminole County firefighter who vowed to post his crazy little dance every day until his new baby boy came home from the hospital. Now, Askew is in the hospital. The very world he took by storm is pulling for him. \"You can't put into words how hard it is,\" Askew said. Askew has a long history of fighting to save lives. He's a firefighter for Seminole County. He's beloved for his integrity and sense of humor. Askew was seen in a video laughing too hard to blow out his own birthday candles. Years ago, Askew fought to save his son's life. Baby Dylan was born premature. Askew took the world by storm with a TikTok dance he posted every day until his son came home and enlisted the help of fellow firefighters, the University of Central Florida's mascot and even WESH 2 News. \"I often think about our little dance. Haha, that was a fun time,\" Askew said. But now Askew is fighting for his own life. It started with the flu. \"Then the next day, I started feeling worse and by Saturday, I was breathing water through my lungs — basically drowning myself,\" Askew said. The flu morphed into an infection. There are tubes to drain fluid and surgery to repair the lungs. \"I'm exhausted. I feel like I am going to have to relearn how to walk, relearn how to talk,\" Askew said. When he couldn't talk, Askew wrote notes of love, and the love is coming right back at him. \"You were there for your family. The world picked up on that and now the world and your family are there for you,\" WESH 2's Michelle Meredith said. \"I am so blessed,\" Askew said. \"So lucky to have my family, friends, co-workers, people I have never met across the county at fire departments. Station 5 here in Orlando — they've been coming up here every shift they can, come hang out with me, talk to me, give me some reassurance.\" Bucketloads of reassurance comes from his family, his wife Danielle and his four sons. The oldest is just big enough to wear Askew's uniform. And for little Dylan: \"That's the little baby?\" Meredith said. \"Yes, that's him,\" Askew said. \"Look at the little man,\" Meredith said. Askew became TikTok's version of Superman to help heal his son. Now, he's turned his superpowers inward to heal himself. \"This is a team effort and I'm going to continue to be a team,\" Askew said. And always with a little help from his friends. \"Go team Chris, go team Chris,\" Meredith said. \"You are loved.\" WESH 2 is cheering him on. Top headlines:",

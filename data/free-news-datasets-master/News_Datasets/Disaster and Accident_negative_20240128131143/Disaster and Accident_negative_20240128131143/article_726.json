Top Stories [North Carolina: New state laws go into effect Jan. 1](https://www.wxii12.com/article/north-carolina-new-state-laws-go-into-effect-january-2024/46212249) [North Carolina nonprofit shares what items not to donate going into 2024](https://www.wxii12.com/article/north-carolina-goodwill-what-not-donate/46237284) [NC A&T alum with featured role in 2023 film 'The Color Purple'](https://www.wxii12.com/article/nc-aandt-alum-2023-film-the-color-purple/46238953) Get the latest news stories of interest by [clicking here](https://www.wxii12.com/) The remains of 5-year-old Logan Bowman were identified just days ago. His father, Wayne Bowman, says he’ll finally be able to put his son to rest after 20 years of searching. \"When they first found it, something told me that it was Logan,\" he said. On Christmas Day 2002, Wayne Bowman dropped his 5-year-old son Logan off with his mother, Cynthia Davis. He said that was the last time he saw his son. After decades of searching, Logan’s body was discovered in a wooded area in Galax, Virginia, along Iron Ridge Road — just a few miles from his father’s home. Watch: [NOWCAST streaming newscasts](https://www.wxii12.com/nowcast) \"You can't change things,\" Wayne said. \"You wish you could, you wish you could. I wish I never took him home on Christmas Day. Wouldn’t you be mad if your 5-year-old kid was gone? It's normal for a parent. It hurts. But what can we do? Just leave it in God's hands.\" Wayne said the years have been hard on him, but it's been his faith and the memories of Logan that have kept him going. Logan's mother and her then-boyfriend Dennis Schermerhorn were both charged in connection to Logan's disappearance. With the discovery and identification of his body, the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office says new charges may be on the way. Wayne says he finally has some closure, but it doesn’t erase the last 20 years of waiting for Logan to come home.

He was always smiling and was cutting up. I'm glad it's over. I can get him a proper burial. I can't say what's going to happen right now, but we just take it one day at a time, and we'll see what's going to happen.\" WXII reached out to the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office about the investigation, they said they have no further comment at this time.

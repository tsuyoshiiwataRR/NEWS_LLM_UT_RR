She was born on Nov. 12, 1938, to Maurice and Rachel Gilbert in Stony Point, N.Y.\nEvelyn married the love of her life, William (Bill) Bayless, on Jan. 5, 1963. Together they raised a wonderful family and spent almost 61 years enjoying their Ford Mustangs, car shows, and visiting with friends and family.\nShe worked for 40 years at Elizabethtown Community Hospital, where she was known for her warmth and smile. Evelyn loved her job and made a lot of lifelong friends during her time at ECH. In her retirement, she loved spending time in the sun, driving around in her beloved purple Mustang, listening to country music, tidying her home, and shopping. Evelyn spread kindness and love wherever she went. She always let others know how much she loved them through lots of hugs, kisses and \"I love you's.\" Evelyn loved spoiling her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Her pets, Artie and Dixie, were an important part of her life.\nShe was predeceased by her children, Danny, William, Robin, and Alan; parents, Maurice and Rachel Gilbert; siblings, Gil, Bob, Dottie and Gloria; brother and sister-in-law, Maurice and Frances MacDougal; and a grandson, Alan Jr.\nLeft to cherish her memory are her husband Bill; son Wally (Milyn); grandchildren, Justin (Amanda), Kristen (Matt), Karin, and Heather; great-grandchildren, Abigail, Catherine, Kaila and Ajay; nieces, Christel and Angell; nephews, Craig, Eric and Darren, and many other nieces and nephews. She also leaves behind her dear friend Shelley Olsen.\nA graveside service will be held in the spring at the Memorial Cemetery in Willsboro, N.Y.\nServices were entrusted to Heidrick Funeral Home, 7521 Court St., Elizabethtown, N.Y.

    "text": "28 Dec 2023 | 09:46 PM UTC Belgium: Taxi drivers serving Brussels Airport will strike on Dec. 29 Taxi drivers serving Brussels Airport in Brussels, Belgium, will strike on Dec. 29 to denounce government's proposed language policy. Unionized taxi drivers serving Brussels Airport (BRU) in Brussels will strike on Dec. 29 to denounce the Flemish government's proposal requiring drivers to pass a mandatory Dutch language exam starting July 2024. Strike organizers assert that this move will cause more than 75 percent of the airport taxi operators to lose their jobs. While organizers did not provide an exact start time for the labor action, they stated that the strike would last 2.5 hours. The labor action will likely prompt delays in travel to and from BRU. Overcrowding on available modes of airport transportation, including ride-share service, is possible during the work stoppage. Although organizers did not provide information on any associated protest, striking workers may form picket lines near BRU, prompting localized transport disruptions. Confirm airport transportation in advance if scheduled to travel via BRU on Dec. 29. Avoid any protest that materializes.",

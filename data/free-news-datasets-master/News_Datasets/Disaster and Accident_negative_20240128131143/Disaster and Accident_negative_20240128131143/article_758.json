    "text": "A car salesman from Rufino, Santa Fe, was found murdered and his body burned inside his truck on December 4 in General Villegas, in the northwest of the Province of Buenos Aires. Investigators led investigators to four men, three of them brothers, who were arrested on charges of killing the victim to avenge the death of a fourth brother two years ago.\nAccording to investigators, the suspects would have simulated the sale of an air conditioner for which they ambushed Diego Pablo Mendicoff . Those arrested are Miguel Alejandro Gamboa, alias \"Rulo\"; Darío Ricardo Gamboa; Mauro Antonio Gamboa, alias \"Topo\"; and Daniel Aparicio Varela, alias \"Guri,\" who were placed at the disposal of the Justice and will be questioned in the next few hours.\nMendicoff had been a truck driver and was now selling cars and buying grain. He agreed with \"Rulo\" Gamboa to buy an air conditioner and went to the agreed place with his Toyota Hilux.\nAccording to sources, investigators believe that when the men were talking, two of Gamboa's brothers who were in hiding, pounced on the victim, subdued him and hit him the head .\nAccording to investigators, with the complicity of a fourth man, \"Guri\" Varela, the three Gamboa brothers transported Mendicoff's body in their truck about 100 kilometers to the side of a rural road in the town of Cañada Seca, in General Villegas.\nThere, the suspects allegedly set fire to the Hilux with the victim's body inside, which ended up burning, while the brothers escaped in the Citroën C3 driven by Varela.\nThree brothers and a fourth man were arrested on charges of murdering a car salesman in the Santa Fe city of Rufino, whose body was found burned on Dec. 4 inside a pickup truck on a rural road in General Villegas. Photo: Télam\nAn investigator said that one of the hypotheses of the crime was an alleged revenge of the Gamboa brothers against Mendicoff, who was blamed for the death of another member of their family.\n\"Two years ago, the victim was allegedly a truck driver and in those circumstances he picked up a fourth brother of the Gamboas on a road. That brother was found dead in the Rosario area and these brothers always blamed him for his death,\" an investigator told Telam .\nThe same source indicated that Mendicoff continued to be in contact with \"Rulo\" Gamboa, \"with whom he did business eventually,\" and to whom he had warned that at that time he had transferred the brother to Rosario, he said.\nProsecutor Manuel Iglesias, of the Functional Investigation Unit (UFI) 5 of Trenque Lauquen, began investigating Mendicoff's crime, which led to two first arrests of Miguel Gamboa and Daniel Varela.\nInvestigators believe Mendicoff's crime was a sibling vendetta. Photo: Télam\nAgents of the Departmental Delegation of Investigations (DDI) of Trenque Lauquen continued with the collection of evidence and based on witness testimonies the participation of the other two Gamboa brothers, Darío and Mauro Gamboa, who were arrested in the last hours after a series of raids carried out in the city of Rufino, was also determined. with the intervention of the DDI of Trenque Lauquen and the Santa Fe police.\nA .22 caliber Bersa pistol was seized during the proceedings, among other items of interest to the case.\nThe detainees will be questioned in the next few hours by prosecutor Iglesias for the crimes of \"qualified homicide by treachery and in premeditated competition of 2 or more people\", which provides for a sentence of life imprisonment.\nMG",

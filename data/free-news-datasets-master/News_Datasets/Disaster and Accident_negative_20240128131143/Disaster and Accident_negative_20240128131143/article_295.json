    "text": "House where University of Idaho students killed torn down. Victims' families opposed it Published in [News & Features](/currentnews/newsheadlines/) Demolition of the off-campus home where four University of Idaho students were killed last year began Thursday morning over continued protests from at least half of the victims’ families. Work to bring down the unique property got underway before dawn. The noise from the heavy machinery pierced the nearby campus as a local construction firm used an excavator to rip away portions of the facade, starting at the front door. By the scheduled start time of 7 a.m. Pacific, as dozens of members of the media arrived to encircle the boarded-up property and train their cameras toward the wreckage, half of the King Road home was on the ground. About an hour later, the former residence was almost entirely gone. The house, a six-bedroom, three-bathroom rental located less than 600 feet from the university’s new Greek row, was the site of the November 2022 quadruple homicide — one of the most talked-about crimes in state history. The victims were U. of I. seniors Kaylee Goncalves and Madison Mogen, both 21, junior Xana Kernodle and freshman Ethan Chapin, both 20. The three women were tenants of the home with two female housemates who were not physically harmed in the fatal stabbings. Chapin was Kernodle’s boyfriend and stayed over for the night. Bryan Kohberger, a graduate student at Washington State University in neighboring Pullman, Washington, at the time, was arrested and charged with the crime in late December 2022. He stood silent when asked to enter a plea, which led to a not guilty plea on his behalf. Kohberger, 29, a Pennsylvania native, could face the death penalty if convicted. A trial date has yet to be set. In the spring, the private owner of the house at 1122 King Road donated the property to the university, and the school made plans for its destruction. After the home was left standing for more than a year, U. of I. committed to knocking it down and announced earlier this month a Thursday demolition date. “It is the grim reminder of the heinous act that took place there,” Scott Green, U. of I.’s president, said in a statement at the time. “While we appreciate the emotional connection some family members of the victims may have to this house, it is time for its removal and to allow the collective healing of our community to continue.” Debate over U. of I.’s decision ...continued ©2023 The Idaho Statesman.

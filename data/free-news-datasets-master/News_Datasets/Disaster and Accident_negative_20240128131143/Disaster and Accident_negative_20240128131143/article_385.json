    "text": "TORRANCE, Calif. — A woman was killed after she was attacked with a sledgehammer at a college on Christmas Eve in Torrance, California. The assault happened Sunday just after 7 a.m. in the 16000 block of Crenshaw Boulevard, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said, according to [KABC](https://abc7.com/torrance-el-camino-college-sledgehammer-attack-woman-killed/14232402/). Investigators say that the victim was collecting recyclables at El Camino College in Torrance when she was attacked, [the news station](https://abc7.com/torrance-el-camino-college-sledgehammer-attack-woman-killed/14232402/) reported. A man with a sledgehammer attacked her and fled the area before law enforcement arrived, according to [KTLA. ](https://ktla.com/news/local-news/woman-killed-in-sledgehammer-attack-on-torrance-college-campus/) The victim was spotted by the gymnasium by someone passing by the area. Officers found her unconscious and she appeared to be bleeding from her head, [ the news outlet ](https://ktla.com/news/local-news/woman-killed-in-sledgehammer-attack-on-torrance-college-campus/)reported. Her dog stayed at her side. The victim was taken to the hospital where she died a day later on Christmas from her injuries, [KTLA](https://ktla.com/news/local-news/woman-killed-in-sledgehammer-attack-on-torrance-college-campus/) reported. The sheriff’s department only identified the victim as an Asian woman between the ages of 60 and 65, according to [ the Los Angeles Times. ](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-27/woman-killed-sledgehammer-el-camino-college-torrance) Investigators identified the suspect through surveillance footage as Jeffrey Davis, 40, according to [KTLA. ](https://ktla.com/news/local-news/woman-killed-in-sledgehammer-attack-on-torrance-college-campus/) “The person that we had an idea of who was on the security footage is, we believe, a homeless person we’ve had contact with before,” said Sgt. Francisco Esqueda of El Camino College Police, according to [the news outlet.](https://ktla.com/news/local-news/woman-killed-in-sledgehammer-attack-on-torrance-college-campus/) “So we were able to go to the neighboring county park where he sometimes hangs out and that’s where we found him.” Davis was arrested shortly after the incident, [ the LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-27/woman-killed-sledgehammer-el-camino-college-torrance) reported.",

    "text": "PONCHATOULA, La. — A two-vehicle crash claimed the life of 47-year-old Madisonville native Dustin Thompson on Thursday morning. According to the Louisiana State Police, the incident occurred before 7:30 a.m. on Louisiana Highway 22 near Watters Road when Thompson allegedly lost control of his 2017 Nissan Altima after striking the guardrail and then crossing back over the centerline before colliding with a 2021 Jeep Cherokee traveling in the opposite direction head-on. Despite both drivers being properly restrained, Thompson sustained fatal injuries as a result of the crash and was pronounced dead at the scene, while the driver of the jeep sustained moderate injuries. The driver of the Jeep was transported to a hospital for treatment. As part of the ongoing investigation by Troop L, routine toxicology samples were obtained from both drivers for analysis. ► Get breaking news from your neighborhood delivered directly to you by downloading the new FREE WWL-TV News app now in the [IOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/new-orleans-news-from-wwl/id1453203460) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_d6bcd10196773d6203b7e9b10e53fea3&hl=en_US).",

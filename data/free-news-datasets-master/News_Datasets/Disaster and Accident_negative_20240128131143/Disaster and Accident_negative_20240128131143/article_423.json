    "text": "RANCHI: Four men were killed when their car hit an electrical pole and crashed into a wall near the Booty Basti in the city in Jharkhand early on Thursday.Police identified the deceased as Afroz Alam, 29, Raju Sah, 32, Amir Hussain, 27, and Mohammad Sabir, 28. They were all residents of the city.Police said Afroz, who runs a hotel in the Bariatu area in the city, was going to Ormanjhi in a Maruti Swift car at about 2 am to drop his staff, Raju, at his village. Afroz’s friends, Amir and Sabir, also accompanied him in the car, which was speeding. It then hit an electrical pole, jumped over a drain, and then crashed against a wall, police said.Lakshmi Kant, in charge of Sadar police station, said soon after receiving information about the accident, 2 police control room (PCR) cars rushed to the spot and began rescue operations. He said rescuers used a crane to hoist the car back on its wheels in order to extricate the 4 men out of the car. All 4 victims were rushed to the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences by 3.30 am, Kant said.“We informed relatives of the victims after retrieving their mobile phones,” he said.“All the victims were unconscious when they were taken to the hospital. Doctors declared them dead after examination. Bodies of the 4 men were handed over to their relatives after postmortem,” Kant said.One of the relatives of the victims, however, complained that there was delay in attending to the victims at Rims.",

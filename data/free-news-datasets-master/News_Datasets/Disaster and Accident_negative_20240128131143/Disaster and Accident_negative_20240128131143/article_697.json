    "text": "[](/u/blacklegend55/)\n📉⏰ Gold's Major Drop Tomorrow: Get Ready for the Tumble! 💥🚨👀\n[OANDA:XAUUSD](/symbols/XAUUSD/)Gold Spot / U.S. Dollar\nGold closed today at 2065.265 (-0.57%). We had anticipated this move a few hours before it happened, and we have been calling for this move since the beginning of the week. However, despite our predictions, many bullish investors and those with diamond hands are still not convinced that the bull trend has reversed and that we are now officially in a bear market.\nTomorrow's drop in gold price will be huge compared to what we have witnessed today. And if it does not happen tomorrow, we expect it to happen the next trading day after January 01, 2024.\nWhy? The hourly charts are in a dangerous spot\nEnough of the talking! Let's look at the charts now, because prices and charts are trustworthy. The gold 1-hour chart indicates that the trend has shifted to the bearish side.\nLet's look at the gold miners -\nNUGT (GOLD MINERS BULL INDEX X2) 3 DAILY CHARTS: We can see that there is double top formation on the RSI.\nGDX 3 DAILY CHART: We can see a double top formation on the RSI as well.\nXAUUSD 3 DAILY CHART: We can see a double top formation on the RSI as well.\nBased on the 3 daily charts, the first target is $1982.\nTomorrow's drop in gold price will be huge compared to what we have witnessed today.

    "text": "LISLE, Ill. (TCD) -- A 51-year-old babysitter stands accused of stabbing two girls, ages 4 and 1, while babysitting the children in their home. According to the DuPage County State’s Attorney's Office, on Nov. 17, shortly after 5 p.m., the Lisle Police Department responded to a report of a suicide attempt at a home on Matson Lane. At the scene, officers found a young girl in the bathroom covered in blood. Police observed the other child sitting on the kitchen floor covered in blood as well. Police located the girls' babysitter, Jennifer Kouchoukos, wearing blood-soaked clothing. She was reportedly in the bathroom where the first child was found. The two children were rushed to a local hospital and later transferred to Comer Children's Hospital in Chicago. Officials also transported Kouchoukos to a hospital for medical treatment. Further investigation revealed Kouchoukos allegedly stabbed the girls multiple times in their back and chest areas while babysitting them. Police reportedly recovered blood-stained knives at the scene, as well as an empty bottle of wine and a nearly empty bottle of rum. Following her release from the hospital, Kouchoukos was booked into the DuPage County Jail. DuPage County State’s Attorney Bob Berlin and Lisle Chief of Police Kevin Licko said Kouchoukos appeared in court on Wednesday, Dec. 27, and was charged with two counts of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of aggravated battery to a child under 13, and two counts of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Kouchoukos was denied pretrial release, and the State filed a motion for a psychiatric evaluation of her. She is scheduled to appear in court again on Jan. 12, 2024, for her arraignment. The state's attorney's office did not disclose the children's current condition. Berlin said in a statement, \"This is an extremely disturbing case for all those involved.\" Licko added, \"What a horrific incident our officers were faced with, I cannot praise them enough.\" TRUE CRIME DAILY: THE PODCAST covers high-profile and under-the-radar cases every week.

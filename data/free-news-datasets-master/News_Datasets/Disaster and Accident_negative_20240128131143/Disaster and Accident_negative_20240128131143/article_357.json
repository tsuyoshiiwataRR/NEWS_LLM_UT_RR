    "text": "After the driver of an 18-wheeler refused to stop for law enforcement or comply with any of their commands, a Texas SWAT team had to use a heavy piece known as “The Rook” to extract him from the vehicle and into custody. Houston law enforcement was initially called to the scene on the I-10 East Freeway after a semi-truck was reportedly stopped in the middle of the highway on Dec. 27. When Harris County Sheriff’s Office deputies arrived and approached the truck, they said the driver took off and led them on a slow pursuit. The truck eventually stopped on the side of the highway after about three miles when spike strips were deployed, but the driver, later identified as 42-year-old Trinidad Cutshall, did not respond to deputies' commands to exit the vehicle. As reported by KTRK-TV , law enforcement tried verbal commands, tear gas, crisis negotiators, and less-lethal munitions, but Cutshall resisted all of their efforts. After Cutshall continued to not respond to the officer's commands, HCSO SWAT brought in a heavy piece of machinery known as “The Rook” to blast through the side of the semi-truck, crushing its windows and tearing off the passenger-side door. Once “The Rook” had done its job, deputies brought a K-9 to take Cutshall into custody. The driver’s face appeared to be bloody as he was being apprehended. Paramedics loaded him onto a gurney and took him to the hospital to be treated for lacerations to the face sustained during the ordeal, according to HCSO. Investigators said at a press briefing that they believe Cutshall had “some level of impairment” as he appeared unfazed when officers launched tear gas into the truck’s cabin. The standoff took several hours, leaving hundreds of drivers in gridlocked traffic as deputies blocked all lanes. Sheriff Eric Gonzalez said in a press briefing before the suspect was arrested, \"We don't know if he is armed or if he has a long rifle or serious firepower in there, so we have to consider all things at this point.\" Officials said that no cargo or weapons were found aboard the semi-truck, as reported by KHOU . HCSO said that Cutshall will be charged with felony evading, and his court date will be scheduled once he is released from the hospital.",

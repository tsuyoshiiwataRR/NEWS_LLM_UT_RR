    "text": "Movies Pierce Brosnan cited for walking in Yellowstone Park thermal areas The James Bond star has been cited by Wyoming authorities. By Clark Collis Clark Collis Senior Writer EW's editorial guidelines Published on December 28, 2023 What would Miss Moneypenny say? Former James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan has been cited in Wyoming after allegedly walking in thermal areas of Yellowstone National Park, according to a court document obtained by People. A criminal docket filed in the U.S. District Court in Wyoming on Tuesday reveals that Brosnan, 70, received citations for traveling by foot “in all thermal areas and w/in Yellowstone Canyon confined to trails\" and “violating closures and use limits” on Nov. 1. Both citations are listed as petty offenses. The Irish actor has been ordered to appear at the Yellowstone Justice Center on Jan. 23. Pierce Brosnan. Leon Bennett/WireImage Yellowstone Park has an array of hydrothermal features including hot springs, geysers and mudpots. The park's official website warns visitors to, \"Stay on boardwalks and trails in thermal areas. Hot springs have injured or killed more people in Yellowstone than any other feature.\" Brosnan has recently been shooting a western titled Unholy Trinity at the Yellowstone Film Ranch in Montana. The actor played James Bond in four films, from 1995's GoldenEye to 2002's Die Another Day. His many other movie credits include 1993's Mrs. Doubtfire, 1996's Mars Attacks!, the 1999 remake of The Thomas Crown Affair, 2010's Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, 2013's The World's End, and last year's Black Adam. A representative for Brosnan did not immediately respond to EW's request for comment. Want more movie news?

    "text": "OCALA, Fla. – Ocala police are still making strides in their investigation as they continue their search for the man behind the gun in the deadly Paddock Mall shooting, but as that search goes on, News 6 learned the shooting suspect still has a separate case open.\nA bench warrant for Albert Shell Jr. details a case he has been dealing with since July.\nAlbert J. Shell Jr., 39 (Ocala Police Department) Records show Shell was accused of hitting his girlfriend at the time, resulting in a battery charge.\nIn the report, the victim told police that Shell kicked in the front door of their shared home and accused her of cheating on him.\n[TRENDING: Become a News 6 Insider ]\nThat incident was just one case, but looking through other court records, News 6 learned that Shell is known to police.\nThere were more than 10 cases in which Shell was found guilty of a misdemeanor or felony dating back to 2002.\nAs a recap, it was the deadly shooting at the Paddock Mall this past Saturday that started the search for Shell.\nOcala police said Shell shot and killed one man and injured another woman two days before Christmas\nFrom there, a series of events quickly unfolded. First was the response from Ocala police, who secured the mall Saturday night where News 6 spoke with witnesses.\nNews 6 Investigative Reporter Eric Sandoval at that time asked one witness, “What happened inside the store at that point when the shots rang out?”\n“Everybody at first was kind of like just still, and then everybody kept looking around, and then I guess there was some people screaming, and we went down the long, long hallway, and I guess it led to the outside,” the witness said.\nThe next day, News 6 learned more about the victim in all of this — David Barron — finding out he was a beloved tattoo artist.\nCicely Robertson said Barron was her tattoo artist. She said friends nicknamed him “Dirty.”\n“Dirty was a nice person. He was loving, giving, he would give you the shirt off his back, he always motivated you to do the right thing,” Robertson said.\nFast forwarding to Tuesday when the mall first opened back up after this deadly shooting, Ocala police ramped up their search for Shell by issuing a reward for information.\nIn addition, investigators sent out a picture of a man who took Shell’s hat. The search lasted a day, and the man was found and the hat returned .\nOcala police release new images of man who took evidence from the scene of a deadly shooting. (Copyright 2023 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.) Police said the hat had potential “DNA evidence.”\nAs the search for Shell continues, police advise people to not approach Shell, but instead give them a call.\nAs a reminder, there is a $10,000 reward for any information leading to his arrest.\nGet today’s headlines in minutes with Your Florida Daily :\nCopyright 2023 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.",

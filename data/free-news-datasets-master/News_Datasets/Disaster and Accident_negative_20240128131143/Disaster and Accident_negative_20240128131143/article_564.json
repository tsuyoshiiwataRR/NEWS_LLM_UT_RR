    "text": "An 18-year-old was arrested in Iowa in connection to threats of terrorism after it was discovered that she had created an arson \"hit list.\" Kaelyn Alexis Surrell was arrested on Tuesday, December 26, after authorities became aware of her list, which included at least seven students and staff members at Sidney High School. A criminal complaint reviewed by Law & Crime stated that Surrell had \"a phone conversation with a reporting party\" where she shared her plan to carry out her arson \"hit list.\" The complaint noted that Surrell \"is a Fire Cadet with the Shenandoah Fire Department, giving her potential knowledge to carry out the act.\" She also sent the \"hit list\" through Snapchat text messages, according to authorities. \"It is alleged that Surrell threatened to commit acts of Arson towards the people on this list,\" the Fremont County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release . Surrell has been charged with seven counts of felony threat of terrorism and is being held on a $5,000 bond. Authorities believe there is no threat to Sidney High School at this time.",

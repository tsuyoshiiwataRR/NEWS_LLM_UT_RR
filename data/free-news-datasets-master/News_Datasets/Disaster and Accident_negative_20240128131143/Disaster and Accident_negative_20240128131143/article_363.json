    "text": "On Air Now [ The Smooth Late Show with Philip Chryssikos ](/radio/shows-presenters/philip-chryssikos/) 10pm - 1am 28 December 2023, 20:24 | Updated: 28 December 2023, 22:09 James Bond star Pierce Brosnan has found himself in hot water after allegedly straying into an off-limits thermal area in a part of a famous US national park. The Irish actor has been charged with stepping out of bounds at Mammoth Terraces, in the northern part of Yellowstone National Park near the Wyoming-Montana border, last month, prosecutors have said. The 70-year-old could be jailed, fined or banned when he appears in the courtroom of the world's oldest national park next month. The 007 star, from Drogheda in County Louth, was visiting Yellowstone for pleasure rather than for movie work, the US Attorney's Office for Wyoming said. Mammoth Terraces, a scenic spot of mineral-encrusted hot springs bubbling from a hillside, is one of the hundreds of thermal features in the park. Millions visit the park every year, enjoying spouting geysers and gurgling mud pots, where water can be at or near boiling point. Leaving the designated areas can be dangerous, as people are badly burned every year after ignoring warnings not to stray off the trail.

In addition to his Bond films, Brosnan starred in the 1980s TV series Remington Steele and is known for starring roles in the films Mrs Doubtfire and The Thomas Crown Affair.

    "text": "MIAMI (CNN) – The Miami Seaquarium in Florida is mourning the loss of one of its dolphins.\nAccording to a social media post , the dolphin named Sundance died Wednesday following “precursors of illness” the previous day.\nSundance had been at the aquarium for more than 30 years.\nThe dolphin was involved in an incident last year when he attacked a trainer during a show.\nThe Seaquarium said the trainer had accidentally scratched Sundance, which caused him to break away from the routine.\nNo details about Sundance’s death have been released.\nThis is not the first loss that the Seaquarium has had to endure in recent months.\nThe famed orca whale Lolita died there in August after living in captivity since 1970.\nCopyright 2023 CNN Newsource.

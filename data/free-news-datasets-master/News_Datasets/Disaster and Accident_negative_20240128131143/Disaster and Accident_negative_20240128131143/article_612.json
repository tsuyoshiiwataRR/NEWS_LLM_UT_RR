    "text": "Ty Drummond involved in workplace accident in Kalgoorlie region Family and friends will farewell the father-of-one on Friday READ MORE: Meet WA landlord dubbed the country's best\nA young father and tradie who died in a freak workplace accident in the Goldfields region of WA will be farewelled on Friday.\nTy Drummond, 25, was working as a heavy-duty mobile plant mechanic when he was killed at ATS Mining Maintenance in South Boulder, about 600km east of Perth, on December 11.\nHe leaves behind his partner Josie and baby daughter Sadie, who turned one just last month.\nMr Drummond’s older brother Dayne has launched a GoFundMe to help them ‘to pick up the pieces that have been left behind by this tragedy’.\nLoved ones gathered in Kalgoorlie Boulder on Friday to say their goodbyes to Mr Drummond, who has been remembered as as a loud and happy young man who adored his family and the life he had created.\nPopular WA tradie Ty Drummond leaves behind his partner Josie and one-year-old daughter\nHe had just bought a new house with Josie and was preparing to settle in with his young family.\n‘You don’t want to believe it’s happened,’ Mr Drummond’s shattered father Dean told Seven News.\n‘He had just achieved everything he wanted.’\nWA Police and Worksafe are investigating the circumstances of the accident, including reports that Mr Drummond got trapped under mining equipment.\nAccording to its website, the ATS workshop specialises in ‘mining machinery, components and drill rig repairs and rebuilds’.\nThe fundraiser is close to its $30,000 target.\nA GoFundMe has been set up to help Ty Drummond’s young family. Ty is pictured with his partner Josie\nMr Drummond became trapped under machinery at a worksite in the Goldfields region of Western Australia on December 11\n‘Unfortunately we recently lost Ty in one of the most unimaginable ways,’ his brother wrote on the page.\n‘I am taking the time to begin this fundraiser in hopes to help at least take some of the financial stress off of Tyrone’s little family that has been left behind.\n‘Tyrone has a beautiful partner named Josie and a gorgeous one year old named Sadie and they need our help to pick up the pieces that have been left behind by this tragedy.’\nMr Drummond was a much loved local who was heavily involved in the Lake View Cricket Club.\n‘Tyrone was Lake View’s ‘unofficial number one ticket holder’ and founding member of the social cricket team,’ the club wrote.\n‘This mainly meant Ty was the first bloke with a beer in his hands while watching and laughing as his mates run around in 45-degree heat.’\nMr Drummond (pictured with his partner Josie) was heavily involved in Lake View Cricket Club\n‘But this season Ty decided he had enough of sitting on the sidelines and officially became a player. Never playing cricket before didn’t stop him from jumping into the sport wholeheartedly.’\n‘Seeing the great man finally step onto the field was something to behold. A golden duck on debut in our 90th anniversary reunion game no less! Even a few misfields couldn’t wipe the smile off his face at the end of the game.\n‘Our sincerest condolences go out to Josie, Sadie, family and friends. We are truly sorry for your loss.’\nPlayers wore black armbands for last weekend’s matches against North Kalgoorlie in Mr Drummond’s honour.\nThe club named Drummond as 13th man for the reserves match while players from both sides paused for a minute’s silence before the start of the A-grade match.",

    "text": "A Missouri woman’s body was found Thursday after her boyfriend allegedly confessed to killing her and hiding her body. FOX 2 reports that [Illinois State Police](https://fox2now.com/news/illinois/police-st-louis-woman-marquisha-williams-found-deceased-in-illinois/) found 29-year-old Marquisha Williams’ body Thursday afternoon in northern Illinois. [As CrimeOnline previously reported](https://www.crimeonline.com/2023/12/28/search-intensifies-for-missing-missouri-mom-of-4-boyfriend-admits-to-harming-her/), Williams was reported missing on December 20, along with her boyfriend, Trenton Ivy, 31. Williams was [last seen with Ivy in St. Louis](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-courts/ex-boyfriend-of-missing-st-louis-county-woman-charged-with-her-murder/article_625e1d84-a4ea-11ee-abb5-1b4e0cff14ab.html), in a 2020 Jeep Compass, near Cook Avenue and Spring Avenue. Family members told police that she dropped off her children at daycare, and then never showed up to work. Police arrested Ivy in Racine, Wisconsin, on charges that included resisting arrest, fleeing from an officer, and using a dangerous weapon. Inside the Jeep, investigators found “biological material,” blood, and some of Williams’ belongings. While being interviewed by investigators, Ivy allegedly admitted that he killed her after an argument and hid her body in an unknown area. On Wednesday, officials charged him with murder.

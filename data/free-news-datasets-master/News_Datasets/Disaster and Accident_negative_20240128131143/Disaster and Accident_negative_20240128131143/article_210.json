    "text": "LOS ANGELES — A ban on indoor and outdoor wood burning in much of Southern California has been extended through Friday due to a forecast of high air pollution in the area, air quality regulators said.\nThe residential wood-burning ban, which began on Christmas Day, will be in effect until at least 11:59 p.m. Friday for all those in the South Coast Air Basin, including the non-desert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and all of Orange County.\nThe order does not apply to mountain communities above 3,000 feet, the Coachella Valley or the high desert, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Homes that rely on wood as a sole source of heat, low-income households and those without natural gas service also are exempt from the requirement.\nRelated Articles Environment | Gov.

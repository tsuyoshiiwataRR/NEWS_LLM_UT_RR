    "text": "Providence City Councilwoman Helen Anthony is suing the driver who struck her during a trip to California , causing 22 broken ribs and putting her in critical condition.\nThe Providence Journal on Thursday obtained a copy of the suit filed on Dec. 14 in Monterey County Superior Court. It names not only the 82-year-old driver as a defendant, but also the California Department of Parks and Recreation and the Point Lobos Foundation.\nMore: Months after being hit by vehicle, Helen Anthony returns to PVD City Council\nWhat does the lawsuit allege? According to the suit, on the morning of June 10, 2023, Anthony was in a crosswalk within the Point Lobos reserve when one of its employees, driving a 2013 Polaris GEM electric vehicle , struck her. The suit states she had the right-of-way when she was hit, run over and dragged \"underneath the vehicle for some distance.\"\nBecause the vehicle was electric, \"it made no sound as it sped towards Mrs. Anthony,\" the suit said. The parks department was named in the suit as the driver may also be one of its employees.\nMore: Providence Councilwoman Helen Anthony spent weeks recovering from serious injuries in California ICU\nThe suit goes on to say that the driver, according to a California Highway Patrol Report, mistook the gas for the brake when he accelerated, crashing into Anthony.\nThe parks department declined to comment, and the Point Lobos Foundation did not reply to a comment request. It remains unclear whether the driver has already hired an attorney.\nAnthony's attorneys are seeking damages including medical expenses, incidental expenses, loss of earnings, costs of the suit and other relief. Among the noneconomic damages Anthony seeks to be compensated for are \"loss of enjoyment of life,\" emotional distress and anxiety.\nAnthony did not comment on the suit.\nThe councilwoman's husband, Douglas Anthony, is also a plaintiff in the suit, and is seeking economic and noneconomic damages.\nThis is a developing story. More to come.",

    "text": "BlendJet is recalling about 4.8 million of its portable blenders because of damage and fire hazards after receiving dozens of reports of injuries, federal regulators said Thursday. According to a notice from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, BlendJet 2 portable blenders may overheat or catch fire, and their blender blades may break during use. The CPSC said there have been 329 reports of blades breaking during use so far, as well as 17 additional reports of overheating or catching fire, resulting in property damage claims of approximately $150,000. The company has received 49 reports of minor burn injuries and one report of concussion. Regulators urged consumers to immediately stop using the recalled blenders and contact BlendJet for a free base unit replacement. To receive the replacement part, customers must remove and cut the base's rubber seal and email or upload a photo using BlendJet's website. BlendJet said in a prepared statement that the recall affects older Blender 2 blenders and that Blender 2 blenders now available for purchase through the company's website and retail partners have updated components and are not subject to the recall. Are. BlendJet 2 units with serial numbers where the first 4 digits are between 5201-5542 are subject to recall.

People with numbers like “5543” or higher will not be recalled. Consumers can also confirm whether their blender is recalled by providing product information on BlendJet's website or contacting the company. recommended According to the CPSC, the recalled BlendJet portable blenders were sold between October 2020 and November 2023 online and in stores at retailers including Costco, Walmart and Target. Additionally, 4.8 million BlendJet 2 blenders have been recalled in the U.S. Regulators say about 117,000 blenders were sold in Canada. Source: www.nbcnews.com",

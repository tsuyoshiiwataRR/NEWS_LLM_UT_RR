    "text": "Christian Marriott had stopped to help a woman who was unconscious in the street (Image: South Yorkshire Police) A man who died after a car hit a group of people in Sheffield was described as a \"Good Samaritan\" after coming to the aid of another victim, police said.\nChristian Marriott, a father of two, had stopped to help an unconscious woman lying in the middle of the road after a row between two alleged wedding party groups in Burngreave, Sheffield, on Wednesday afternoon.\nMr Marriott, 46, had been walking with his six and eight-year-old sons at the time of the incident, South Yorkshire Police confirmed.\n\"Numerous\" people were also injured in the incident in in College Close, with one of them in a serious condition and being treated in hospital, officers added. Two men were arrested in connection with the incident - one on suspicion of murder - and remain in custody, the force said.\nREAD MORE: British tourists given a stark warning as 'following law won't protect you'\nSenior investigating officer Det Ch Insp Andrew Knowles said Mr Marriott had been out for a post-Christmas walk with his wife and two young sons when the crash happened at around 2pm.\n\"This is an utterly heart-breaking case in which a Good Samaritan, who had stepped in to help a stranger in their time of need, has lost his life,\" he said.\n\"Chris leaves behind a loving family, including his devastated wife and two young sons. We are absolutely determined to secure justice for Chris and his loved ones following this horrific tragedy. Increased patrols will continue in the area in the coming days and local people will continue to see officers carrying out enquiries, including going house-to-house to gather witness statements.\"\nTrending The woman Mr Marriott had been trying to help is in hospital with life threatening injuries. Another man suffered serious injuries and three women and a man all suffered minor injuries, police said.\nAccording to the MailOnline, the row had been sparked by two families attending a wedding celebration nearby. One person described the scene as a \"bloodbath\".\nMrs Bi said: \"The bride, the girl, was happy and everything was peaceful but there was a problem with her family who live a few miles away. I think they had been invited to the wedding but chose not to attend but later went to the boy's home to confront his family.\n\"It was her family making all the drama. They didn't want the girl to marry the boy. They were not happy that the wedding had gone so ahead and a big argument started outside the house. There were lots of people in the street. One of the girl's relatives had driven into the crowds. I didn't see it and do not know if it was deliberate or accidental.\"\nRelated articles Sex predators and paedophiles working in UK as therapists and it's not illegal Over 200,000 shoplifting cases remain unsolved amid growing crime wave Liverpool city centre shut down after mayhem breaks out after triple stabbing Funeral costs GoFundMe arranged by family of Dublin gunman Murder investigation launched after man dies as car crashes into crowd Read Get ",

    "text": "Two people were killed and another two were injured in a single-vehicle crash that closed the eastbound Interstate 76 Frontage Road in Brighton Thursday afternoon.\nThe four adult men were speeding down eastbound I-76 in a Chevrolet Equinox when the driver, a 40-year-old man, suddenly veered off the right side of the interstate, went airborne and rolled over the frontage road into an electrical box, according to a Friday news release from the Brighton Police Department .\nOne of the passengers, a 26-year-old Aurora man, was already dead when police arrived at the scene, the news release stated.\nAccording to the release, the driver and the other two men in the vehicle were taken to the hospital, where another passenger, a 30-year-old man, later died from his injuries.\nThe identity of the two men who died will be released by the Adams County Coroner’s Office after they have been identified and their families have been notified.\nThe crash happened just before 2 p.m. Thursday and was reported by Brighton police at approximately 2:15 p.m. on X. I-76 Frontage Road was closed between 160th and 168th avenues until approximately 5:15 p.m., according to the department.\nThe driver did not appear to be under the influence and officers believe at least two passengers were not wearing seatbelts, the Friday release stated.

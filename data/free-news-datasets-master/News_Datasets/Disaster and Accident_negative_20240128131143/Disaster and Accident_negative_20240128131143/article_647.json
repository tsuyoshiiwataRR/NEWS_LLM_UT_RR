    "text": "The unhinged man accused of stabbing two teen tourists at Grand Central Terminal allegedly slashed a fellow inmate in an unprovoked attack at Rikers Island Thursday morning, law enforcement sources told The Post. Steven Hutcherson, 36 — who is being held on attempted murder charges in the random Christmas Day stabbing — allegedly suddenly got up from his cot in a dorm at the Eric M. Taylor Center and pounced on the 43-year-old man lying just feet away from him at around 8 a.m., the sources said. He used a 1.5-inch ceramic blade to slash the other inmate, leaving gashes across the left side of his face and head, according to the sources. A correction officer intervened quickly, pepper-spraying Hutcherson and rushing the victim to the jail infirmary and eventually to Elmhurst Hospital to be treated for the slash wounds, sources said. Department of Corrections officials said Hutcherson had been scanned for weapons at some point prior to the attack, and that none were found. The DOC was investigating how he was able to get his hand on the blade. Hutcherson — who has a history of mental health issues and also goes by the name Esteban Esono Asue — was evaluated by health officials and cleared to be placed with the general population at Rikers, according to sources. He has since been transferred to a separate Rikers jail where he will be confined for 14 hours a day and be kept away from some inmates. In a statement, the DOC said Hutcherson “slashed another person in custody inside a jail on Rikers Island. The victim was taken to Elmhurst Hospital with multiple stab wounds to the face and head.” Hutcherson “will be processed for rearrest for this incident. A Correction Officer quickly intervened to stop the incident and ensured the victim received medical care,” the statement said. Hutcherson was ordered held without bail at his Tuesday night arraignment on attempted murder and assault charges in the attack at a French restaurant inside the Grand Central dining concourse. The victims, 14 and 16-year-old sisters visiting from Paraguay, were enjoying a meal with their family when Hutcherson allegedly grabbed a knife and stabbed the girls, police said. Records show he has at least 17 prior arrests and at least a half dozen emotional disturbance encounters with police — as well as a string of incidents in which he allegedly violated a restraining order from an ex-girlfriend who said he stalked her and had threatened to kill her. The Legal Aid Society, which represents Hutchinson, didn’t immediately comment Thursday on the alleged Rikers attack. The City Council last week passed a controversial bill banning solitary confinement in Big Apple lockups. The Corrections Officer Benevolent Association, the union that represents the city’s 6,000 DOC employees, has warned that the law — set to take effect next year — would jeopardize the safety of officers and inmates at the jails. “Today’s heinous attack at EMTC by the same serial stabber, who attacked two innocent teenagers at Grand Central, demonstrates exactly why we need to maintain punitive segregation in our jails,” COBA President Benny Boscio said in a statement Thursday. Hutcherson is due back in Manhattan court Friday.",

    "text": "Two women were exploring a notorious 'love tunnel' before they were swept to their deaths by floodwaters - with a third female companion narrowly escaping with her life. Helen Bradford, 40, and Tanya Hehir, 46, were exploring the 2.4km tunnel near the Queensland town of Gympie, north of Brisbane , when they were caught up in wild weather produced by 'cyclonic' Boxing Day storms. The pair were washed back through the drain into the Mary River while a third woman, 40, was able to scramble to safety and call for help despite her injuries. A major rescue operation was launched with the state emergency service, water police, police divers and helicopters assisting in search efforts. Ms Bradford's body was found by swift water crews at at about 7.10pm on Tuesday near the entrance of the tunnel at Kidd Bridge. Ms Hehir's body was recovered near the Gympie Weir on Wednesday afternoon. Locals reminisced on time spent in the 'love tunnel' - an iconic local stormwater system and favourite of teenagers in the Gympie region. Residents said the tunnel was a old hang out spot where teenagers could spend hours exploring without the prying eyes of their parents. 'I could not count the amount of times as kids we walked through that,' one said. The women were washed back through the drain into the Mary River while a third woman, 40, was able to scramble to safety and call for help despite moderate head injuries Locals reminisced on time spent in the love tunnel (pictured) after a photo of the stormwater drain was posted in a Gympie community page in 2021 'My dad threatened me with death if he caught me down there,' a second wrote. A third commented: 'I'd spend hours up there... so dark, couldn't even see your hand in front of your face.' 'Go in for love come out with tetanus,' a fourth wrote. The 2.4km tunnel stretches from the banks of the Mary River to the town centre. According to locals the drain has two exits - one close to the Gympie Civic Centre and the other near the Cullinanes Plaza. Ms Bradford worked at the Coffee Club and was a keen cyclist, runner and hiker who enjoyed climbing mountains and following wilderness trails. Ms Hehir was also a keen runner and outdoor enthusiast who had hiked the iconic WWII Kokoda track in Papua New Guinea. Both women were mothers with Ms Hehir having two children. Residents said the Gympie love tunnel (pictured) was a old hang out spot where teenagers could spend hours exploring without the prying eyes of their parents Pictured L-R: Victims David 'Mario' Logan, Mia Holland-McCormack and Stephen 'Taity' Tait Mia Holland-McCormack, 9, (pictured) died on Boxing Day night after being swept away by flood waters when she jumped over the back fence of her family's home in Rochester South In total, seven Queenslanders and three Victorians have been killed in the storms. The youngest victim of the 'mini-cyclones' that hit southeast Queensland was nine-year-old Mia Holland-McCormack who was swept into a drain on Boxing Day. Mia, who was severely autistic, was reported missing earlier that afternoon after she jumped the fence of her house in Rochedale South, in southeast Brisbane. Earlier on Thursday, the third victim of a boating tragedy caused by the 'mini-cyclone' was identified as 48-year-old Robert Holden. Mr Holden died alongside former Queensland rugby union players David Logan and Stephen Tait when their boat capsized on Brisbane's Moreton Bay on Boxing Day. Robert Holden (pictured with wife Michelle) has been identified as the third victim of a boat capsize that occurred during wild storms on Boxing Day Mr Holden is being remembered as a 'great man who always put others' needs above himself' The deceased men were part of a group of 11 mates who were thrown in the water near Green Island, when 100km/h winds struck the area and shrunk visibility. While the eight others onboard were rescued, the bodies of Mr Logan, Mr Tait and Mr Holden were only able to be recovered in the storm's aftermath. Queensland Police Acting Chief Superintendent Andrew Pilotto said it would have been an awful last few moments for the three men. 'There were reports people saw it happen … but the conditions were horrific and visibility would have been down to metres,' he said. 'I know the winds were over 100km/h … I've been out on the bay in half that and the swell is insane. I can imagine it was tremendous.'",

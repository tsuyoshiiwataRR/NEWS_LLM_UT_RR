December 2023, 10:15 p.m\nSeattle, USA: Boeing in trouble again because of a loose screw on a 737 MAX\nBoeing is in trouble again with its 737 MAX: After an airline discovered a missing nut, all aircraft of the type are now to be inspected.\n1 / 4\nAn airline discovered a missing nut on a bolt. A loose screw was also discovered on a 737 MAX that had not yet been delivered.\nimago images/ZUMA Wire\nNow all machines worldwide are to be checked.\nREUTERS\nThe problem concerns a tie rod used to control rudder movements.\nREUTERS\nThat’s what it’s about\n-\nAn airline discovered a missing nut on a control rod on a Boeing 737 MAX.\n-\nThe US aviation safety authority has now asked all airlines to check the relevant component.\n-\nThe aircraft manufacturer’s shares fell after the news.\nThe US aircraft manufacturer Boeing cannot relax – this time it is about a bolt in the rudder control system of the 737 MAX model. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) urged operators of newer single-aisle aircraft in a statement Thursday to inspect certain control rods used to control rudder movements for loss of parts. The agency called in a statement to “closely monitor targeted inspections of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft for the possibility of a loose screw in the rudder control system.”\n«The problem identified with a particular aircraft has been resolved. As a matter of caution, we recommend that operators inspect their 737 MAX aircraft and inform us of the results,” a spokesman for aircraft manufacturer Boeing said in a statement. This inspection consists of opening an access hatch and visually checking that everything is compliant. This process is expected to take approximately two hours per aircraft.\nAn international airline had previously noticed a missing nut on a bolt during routine maintenance. Boeing also subsequently discovered a nut on a 737 MAX that had not yet been delivered that was not tightened “according to regulations”.\nBoeing hit financially\nInvestors reacted disappointedly to the news. The Boeing price fell by almost one percent at the end of the Dow. A week ago, stock market experts were still confident that, according to a media report, Boeing was allowed to deliver medium-haul jets from the 737 MAX series to China again after a year-long stop.\nAfter two aircraft disasters in October 2018 and March 2019 that killed 346 people, the 737 MAX was grounded worldwide for months. More recently, the aircraft manufacturer has had to slow its deliveries due to problems with the fuselage, particularly the aircraft’s rear watertight bulkhead. Boeing has delivered a total of more than 1,370 copies of the 737 MAX, and the order book currently includes more than 4,000 aircraft.\nIn Switzerland, no airline has this type of aircraft in its fleet, as a look at the websites shows. One\nList of Boeing shows which airlines rely on the type.\nHave you been following on Whatsapp for 20 minutes?\nStay informed and subscribe to the 20 Minutes WhatsApp channel: Then you will receive an update with our most moving stories directly to your cell phone in the morning and evening – hand-picked, informative and inspiring.\n(DPA/trx)\n1703804980\n#Boeing #trouble #due #missing #nut #MAX",

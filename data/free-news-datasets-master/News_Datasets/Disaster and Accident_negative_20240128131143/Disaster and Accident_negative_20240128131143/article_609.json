    "text": "[Independent TV](/tv) Showing now | News 00:45 Massive [waves](/topic/waves) hitting the [California](/topic/california) coastline sparked evacuations on Thursday, 28 December. A high surf warning was initially issued for [Santa Cruz](/topic/santa-cruz) County as a storm brings high winds, rainfall, and a heavy tidal swell.

Evacuation orders were issued in Santa Cruz as well as across the coast as dangerously high waves pound the coastlines, expected to reach a height of 33ft.

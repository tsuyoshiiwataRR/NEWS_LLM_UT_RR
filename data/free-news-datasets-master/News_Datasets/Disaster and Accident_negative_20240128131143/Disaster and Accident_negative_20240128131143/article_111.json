    "text": "Greyhound Bus Stations Across the Country Close, Forcing Passengers to Wait on the Street Eight major American cities have lost their Greyhound bus terminals, or seen the moved to locations that city officials deem unsafe Published |Updated\nPatrick Cooley\nCities have called Greyhound’s decision to move or eliminate its bus terminals a safety hazard. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\nBus riders in major cities like Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia now have to make do without Greyhound bus stations.\nSo do bus passengers in other American cities where Greyhound stations have shut down in recent years — forcing them to wait on street corners in hard-to-reach areas and raising safety concerns, according to researchers and city officials.\nThere are a variety of reasons behind for the closures. The real estate company that owns the Chicago station is selling the property, according to The Wall Street Journal. Philadelphia’s bus station shut down in June to ease congestion on the bustling Market Street thoroughfare and the downtown location in Columbus, Ohio, was declared a public nuisance.\nGreyhound did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe future of Greyhound locations in smaller cities remains uncertain. The company has proposed moving its Cleveland station 11 miles away from that city’s downtown, according to Axios. Across the state, the Cincinnati bus station shut down after a developer bought the site, which was near the city’s center.\nA study from DePaul University’s Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development earlier this year concluded that the closure of Chicago’s Greyhound station would disproportionately impact low-income travelers, many of whom have no alternative but to travel by bus.\n“These travelers would suffer if operations shifted to a curbside spot without a secure, climate-controlled waiting room,” the study said.\nZach Klein, Columbus’ city attorney, sued Greyhound after the bus operator moved the terminal from downtown to an abandoned station on the city’s west side this summer, claiming the new location is a safety hazard. The suit says police calls to the area spiked after it opened, according to the Columbus Dispatch.\nKathy Anne Wood, who lives near the new station, told WBNS in Columbus that the station is a safety hazard. “It puts everybody in danger,” she said. “There’s no crosswalks, there’s no light. We’ve had people hit by cars trying to cross the street because they can’t get anywhere else.”\nAfter Greyhound moved its Tampa, Florida, station to a parking lot earlier this year, riders told WFTS there were no restrooms and no workers to help them with problems or keep them apprised of schedule changes.\nThe coronavirus pandemic decimated the travel industry, and bus companies could not avoid the financial cataclysm. Greyhound reported having around 10,000 passenger journeys per day in fiscal year 2021, compared with 40,000 in the previous year, according to CNBC.\nUnlike other travel companies, bus companies received comparatively little assistance from COVID relief packages. Only $2 billion of the $54 billion from the CARES Act in 2020 went to bus companies and ferry services, according to the Journal, compared to $4 billion for Amtrak alone.\nGreyhound was sold to the German company FlixMobility in 2021, which does not release financial information for the bus operator. In the year that ended March 31, 2021, Greyhound recorded $422.6 million in revenue, down 62% from 2009, the Journal reported.",

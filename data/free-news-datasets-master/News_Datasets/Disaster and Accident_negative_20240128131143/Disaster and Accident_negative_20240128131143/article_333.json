    "text": "Security authorities are reinforcing road surveillance after up to six traffic accidents were recorded in one week in December, involving cars and motorcycles in Tucupita. According to the statements of the governor of Delta Amacuro, Lizeta Hernández, this Thursday, the Secretariat of Citizen Security has deployed new mobile control points to influence the use of helmets in the case of motorized vehicles, the seat belt and the permitted speeds, as well as the retention of vehicles with drivers under the influence of alcohol. Hernández reported that these road safety points are in strategic places in Tucupita, where more accidents usually occur, such as on the national highway of the capital of the Delta. In one week, six traffic accidents were recorded in Tucupita, with no fatalities so far, but with material losses to third parties. Motorcycles until 10 p.m. The Secretary of Security and Public Order of the Delta Amacuro state, Noel Valderrama, reiterated that motorized vehicles can circulate until 10 p.m., if they do not have any permit or endorsement indicating that they can do so. Any required authorization must be managed by the offices of this entity. The measure seeks to reduce the so-called motorcycle crashes, irresponsible alcohol consumption and speeds not permitted by motorized vehicles. Mobilization by land terminal Arnold Suárez, sole tourism authority for the Delta Amacuro state, reported this Thursday that the Tucupita and Casacoima land terminals continue to operate “receiving families who return to the Delta for vacation” during the Christmas and New Year festivities. Thus, it maintains a data of about three thousand users who have traveled between December 24 and December 28 only through this land terminal. The enabled routes are to and from Caracas, Ciudad Guayana, Valencia, Maturín, Casacoima and Uracoa, with prices that have not changed despite the season.",

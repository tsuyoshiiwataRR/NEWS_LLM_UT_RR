    "text": "Throughout much of the year, a pair of tragedies in the Twin Counties made headlines as local leaders and area residents responded to each crisis in different ways. An effort led by city sanitation workers seeking fairer pay also received much attention in 2023. In covering the stories that had the biggest impact on Telegram readers, how the community responds to conflict and crisis seemed to be an undercurrent in a year of great challenges for those who live and work in the Twin Counties. The Telegram newsroom convened recently and voted on the top 10 stories of the year. In today’s edition, we recap four of those stories that we consider to be among the biggest stories of 2023. In our weekend edition, we will reveal the story we consider to be the top story of the year. No. 4. Sanitation workers call for fair pay raises The issue of whether city employees, mainly sanitation workers, are being paid enough took center stage in the public arena of municipal government in 2023. However, activists and residents calling for action, including at the speaker’s podium at City Council meetings and at an Oct. 10 rally outside City Hall, have faced a lack of a supportive majority on the council. Additionally, city Human Resources Director Kena Cofield Jones, at a Sept. 11 council work session, showed that, except for a superintendent, 44 of 45 sanitation workers received a pay raise, with the ranges of those raises being from 5 percent to 24 percent. This was ranked the fourth biggest story of the year in a top 10 list of stories as chosen by the Telegram. The matter of city employees seeking fairer pay can be traced to when City Manager Keith Rogers Jr., in a news release on April 14, announced he had given the go-ahead to raise the starting pay of city police officers to $60,000. Rogers on May 17 submitted a proposed municipal operating budget that also called for allocating necessary funds to implement recommendations from a classification and compensation study in connection with city employee pay. The study called for increasing the minimum wage from $15 an hour to $16.83 an hour and creating market-driven competitive pay grades. Rogers said that this would include the average salary of a firefighter or emergency medical technician going up to $54,944 and the average salary of a police officer going up to $60,000. On June 26, before a majority of the City Council voted to approve the budget and the classification and compensation study, Councilman Andre Knight made a motion for an amendment to implement a 15 percent pay increase for public works employees as well as parks and recreation employees and to implement a 6 percent cost-of-living adjustment for full-time city employees, except those in the police department. The proposed amendment was nixed in a 4-3 vote. Knight continued to try to seek action on his calls for the pay increase and the cost-of-living adjustment, but in October and November council meetings, the same 4-3 majority batted down the measure in procedural moves that blocked further discussion of the issue. No. 3. State takes over Nash DSS after child deaths The story that ranked third in the top 10 list as chosen by the Telegram was the end of Amy Pridgen-Hamlett’s directorship of the Nash County Department of Social Services amid public outcries of negligence and incompetence. Nash County Commissioner Gwen Wilkins called for Pridgen-Hamlett to resign, and county officials on Sept. 28 were told Sarah Bradshaw of Vanguard Professional Staffing of Wilson was stepping in as interim DSS director. Earlier in the year, the Child Protective Services division of the Nash County DSS was taken over by the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services. State officials had deemed that leadership at the county office was unable to correct the problems of negligence and lack of supervisory oversight on their own. The trouble began with the death of 8-year-old Christal Lane of rural Nash County on Feb. 7, allegedly because of fatal brutality by her grandmother Patricia Ricks. Further revelations showed that on Dec. 19, 2022, DSS and law enforcement officials had been called to Coopers Elementary School to investigate injuries to Lane that were the result of a beating. Despite a recommendation by a Nash County sheriff’s deputy that Lane be removed from the home she had shared with her siblings and Ricks, DSS allowed Lane to return to the residence. In July, media reports said that another child, nearly 2-year-old Chase Hilliard, died in 2020 of complications resulting from non-accidental head injuries, with his mother, Vonquetta Hilliard, allegedly to blame and with DSS having failed to remove the child when the mother was unable to take care of him. Nash County Health Director Bill Hill, in an update Dec. 21 about the leadership at DSS, said that Bradshaw stayed on as interim DSS director for a couple months. Hill said that another person contracted through Vanguard, Suzanne Gray, came aboard on Oct. 19 to serve as interim DSS director after Bradshaw had to step away for personal reasons. Hill said that Pridgen-Hamlett transferred and has been working at a county health department facility on the UNC Health Nash campus. Hill said his information is that Pridgen-Hamlett has tendered paperwork to retire in January. No. 2. Tornado strikes Pfizer, several residences Number two in the top 10 stories in 2023 as chosen by the Telegram was the EF-3 tornado that on July 19 struck parts of Rocky Mount and the northern part of Nash and Edgecombe counties. Generally, an EF-3 is the fourth strongest type of tornado on a scale of six. The twister caused massive damage to pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer’s plant off North Wesleyan Boulevard and adjacent to the interchange with N.C. 4. The Belmont Lake Preserve, which is a residential area in the northern part of the city, also received major damage. After a news conference on July 21 under a tent just outside Pfizer, company Chairman and CEO Dr. Albert Bourla said, “We are here to stay, and we are here to make this plant once more the great plant it was — very quickly.” Prior to the tornado, a total of more than 3,200 colleagues and contractors had been working at the plant. During the news conference, Bourla also said Pfizer was committed to paying all the employees throughout the closure of the plant, regardless of whether they worked. On July 23, Gov. Roy Cooper went to the rural northern parts of Nash and Edgecombe counties to see the damage firsthand and, at one stop along the way, said that the people affected by the storm did the right things. The community’s recovery from the tornado has been powered by volunteers and led by nonprofit organizations and faith-based ministries. The United Way Tar River Region has acted as the backbone organization in directing financial aid and leading the region’s tornado recovery committee. As is a common refrain in the Twin Counties, in times of great need, the collaboration among various groups and organizations that have jumped into action has been unparalleled. The committee gave regular reports of how volunteers have helped clean up, cut down, repair, rebuild, rehome and provide hope to those affected by the tornado. Subscribe to the Rocky Mount Telegram",

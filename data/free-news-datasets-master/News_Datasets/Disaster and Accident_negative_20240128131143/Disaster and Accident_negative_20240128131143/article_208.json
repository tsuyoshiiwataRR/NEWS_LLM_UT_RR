Her husband, Gadi Haggai, 73, was killed on the same day, Mr Biden said last week.\n“This tragic development cuts deep, coming on the heels of last week’s news that Judith’s beloved husband, Gad Haggai, is believed to have been killed by Hamas,” Mr Biden said in a statement, vowing to continue fighting for the release of other hostages still held by Hamas.\nWorking while on holiday in the US Virgin Islands, Mr Biden said he would never forget what the couple’s daughter and the family members of other Americans held hostage in Gaza told him when he met with them this month. “They have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal,” he said.\nREAD MORE HERE\nThree dead as Storm Gerrit batters Britain Embed Twitter Tweet URL Three people died on Dec 28 after their car fell into a river in northern England, local police said, as Storm Gerrit battered much of the UK.\nEmergency services headed to the River Esk near the town of Glaisdale shortly before midday (8pm Singapore time), after reports that a vehicle had fallen into the river.\nSeveral regions of the UK, particularly Scotland and northern England, have been badly hit by Storm Gerrit since Dec 27, which has brought heavy rain and snow.\nREAD MORE HERE\nMan found barely alive in landing gear of Algeria flight to Paris A man was discovered on Dec 28 hidden in the landing gear compartment of a commercial aircraft that flew into Paris from Algeria with severe hypothermia but alive, French authorities said.\nThe man, believed to be in his 20s, was found during technical checks after the Air Algerie flight from Oran, Algeria, landed at Paris’ Orly airport in mid-morning, prosecutors told AFP.\nHe had no ID on him, and was taken to hospital in serious condition, they said.\nREAD MORE HERE\nForeigners who made Ukraine home stay put, despite war It was just three months after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, but Marwa Yehea wanted to return to her home in Kyiv.\nMs Yehea, 31, who is originally from Syria, had fled the Ukrainian capital with her two daughters that February when the war began.

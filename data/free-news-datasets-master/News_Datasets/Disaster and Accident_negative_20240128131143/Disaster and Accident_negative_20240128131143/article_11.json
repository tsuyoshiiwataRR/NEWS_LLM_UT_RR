    "text": "Josh Taylor was laid to rest on December 20 He revealed to his father he wanted to propose to his girlfriend READ MORE: Critical unanswered questions about Josh Taylor's death\nA young man who was buried alive under 1.5m of sand on a popular Queensland island had plans to propose to his long-term girlfriend before his tragic death.\nJosh Taylor’s life support machine was switched off six days after he fell in a deep pit that was dug in the sand at Bribie Island’s Woorim Beach on December 2.\nThe day before the horrific accident, a friend said that Josh told his father, Peter, that he was going to ask his girlfriend, Kaitlynd Odri, to marry him in the new year.\nThe family friend described how Mr Taylor shared details of his cherished final moments with his eldest son during his funeral service held on December 20 at Centennial Memorial Gardens in Brisbane’s south-western suburbs.\n‘The weather was perfect, they fished, they swam and they had a body-surfing competition,’ the friend said.\nJosh Taylor had planned on popping the question to his girlfriend Kaitlynd Odri. Both pictured\nJosh Taylor (above) died six days after he was buried alive under 1.5m of sand on Bribie Island\n‘That night they had dinner around the campfire and that’s when Josh told his dad that he wanted to marry Kaitlynd in the new year.’\nThe couple, who weren’t living together, are understood to have been dating for four years after meeting on the dating app Bumble.\nHundreds of mourners are said to have gathered to farewell the Mr Taylor, an arborist from Brisbane,.\nMourners were asked to wear board shorts, sun dresses and thongs for the occasion to reflect his relaxed, happy-go-lucky attitude to life.\nTragedy struck when Mr Taylor and the group he was with were said to have dug the 1.5m-deep pit to roast a pig under the sand – in the style of a Maori hāngī.\nThere has been an alternative theory floated that the group may have been hunting the island’s wild boars and dug a sand trap to try to catch one.\nDetectives have now launched a criminal investigation into Mr Taylor’s death.\nMore than a dozen men, including paramedics and Mr Taylor’s friends, worked to get him out of the hole\nJosh Taylor’s family farewelled him at a memorial in Brisbane on December 20. Josh is pictured centre\nMr Taylor was said to have fallen into the hole when he stumbled and overbalanced as he got out of a chair, with his flailing arms bringing down its walls on top of him.\nHe was buried headfirst, with his ankles only barely visible to rescuers, who tried to pull him out after their attempts to dig him out failed.\nBut the weight of the sand and the suction created as they yanked at him meant even the brute force of 15 men pulling on a rope around his feet was unable to dislodge him.\nAn off-duty paramedic advised the rescue party to try pulling in a different direction which eventually managed to free him.\nBut one rescuer, passer-by Nathan, said Mr Taylor’s body ‘broke’ as he was released.\n‘All of his family were screaming at us, telling us to help, telling us to get rope so we could pull him out. It was pretty gruesome,’ Nathan said.\n‘There were like 15 men on the rope pulling and he did not budge. It was pretty gnarly when he popped out. I threw up.\n‘He broke. The suction, the force of everyone pulling.’\nMr Taylor did not have a pulse when he was freed but rangers, friends and family performed CPR for 45 minutes until he was flown to Brisbane’s Princess Alexandra Hospital where he died six days later.\nA GoFundMe by family friend Georgia Hoffman for Josh’s parents raised more than $70,000 before it was brought to a conclusion.",

    "text": "ZAMBOANGA CITY – Some 300 families lost their homes when fire broke out in Barangay Tugbungan here on Wednesday morning.\nSuperintendent Christopher Morales, the city fire marshal, said they received a fire alarm at around 11:51 a.m.\nThe fire destroyed houses in Calle Basa, occupied mostly by informal settlers.\nAt least seven residents were given first aid due to suffocation.\nMorales said 12 firetrucks from 12 different fire stations responded, together with two ambulances and rescue trucks. The fire was extinguished at around 1:52 p.m. or after two hours.\nJeffrey Faustino, Barangay Kagawad of Tugbungan, said the fire started in one of the houses in Calle Basa.\n“We were informed that an unattended rice cooker was the cause of fire,” he added.\n“This is really tragic for our people here as few days from now we will welcome the New Year,” Faustino said.\nMaria Socorro Rojas, city social welfare and development officer, said they are arranging for a temporary shelter for the displaced families.\n“We are coordinating with other agencies especially for tagging, so far, we established community kitchen. We are also negotiating with school officials for their temporary stay, but we are just given a week, the most we requested is 15 days,” Rojas said.",

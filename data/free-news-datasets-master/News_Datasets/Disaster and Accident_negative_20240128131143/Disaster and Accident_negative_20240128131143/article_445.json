    "text": "A 20-year-old man accused of stabbing a woman during a robbery in Moreno Valley was charged Thursday with assault with a deadly weapon and other offenses. Deondre Outley Jones of Moreno Valley was arrested earlier this week following the attack in the 24900 block of Sunnymead Boulevard, near Perris Boulevard. Along with the assault count, Jones was charged with robbery and making criminal threats. He was being held in lieu of $1 million bail at the Robert Presley Jail and was slated to make his initial court appearance Thursday afternoon at the Riverside Hall of Justice. According to the Riverside County Sheriff's Department, shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday, Jones allegedly confronted the victim, whose identity was not disclosed, inside a business, pulling a knife and threatening her. Sheriff's officials allege Jones stabbed her at least once and snatched her purse and jewelry, then fled the location. \"The victim sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital, where she is expected to survive,\" according to a sheriff's statement. Patrol deputies canvassed the area and spotted a man matching the description of the assailant loitering in nearby park, according to authorities. The individual, Jones, was detained and found \"in possession of the victim's property and was positively identified,\" the sheriff's department stated. Jones has no documented prior felony convictions in Riverside County. Follow KNX News 97.1 FM\nTwitter | Facebook | Instagram | TikTok",

    "text": "FORT BEND COUNTY, Texas â€” If you live or drive in Fort Bend County, officials say vehicle burglaries are on the rise. On Christmas morning, Missouri City resident Alex Bergeron said she was enjoying the day inside with her family until her sister came over. \"My sister came in the house and said, 'Why is your back window rolled down?' And I was like, 'Well it shouldn't be,'\" Bergeron said. When she went outside, she learned an unwanted visitor had been in her car. \"The glass even got to the front. I was just in shock, honestly. So, I went back inside and said, 'Hey, my car got broken into,'\" she said. Her doors were locked and all the thieves could see in the back were some jackets. \"They didn't take anything, my glove compartments weren't gone through so I'm not sure if someone startled them away,\" Bergeron said.\" Fort Bend County Sheriff Eric Fagan said car break-ins are up 9% this month compared to the previous. He recommends simply locking doors and removing every item inside. \"It's the holiday season. Thieves want to come out even more because they know individuals are shopping, leaving things in their cars. Let's not make it easy for them,\" he said. Luckily for Bergeron, she avoids the costly headache of replacing her window. \"You never know how it really feels until it happens to you,\" she said. \"It was just a bad feeling and it felt very personal.\" Other tips from the sheriff include tinting your windows and getting an alarm for window breaks. He said 25% of vehicles that were stolen in the county were left unlocked.",

    "text": "Jalopnik Daihatsu Admits It Forged Crash Test Results For 30 Years, Halts Production In Japan Read full article Daniel Golson December 28, 2023 at 10:57 PM · 2 min read The outside of a Daihatsu dealership\nLast week we reported on Daihatsu halting sales and shipments of all of its cars amid a probe into the Toyota subsidiary rigging safety tests of 64 different models, and now the situation has gotten even worse. On Wednesday, CNN reported that Daihatsu has now stopped production at all four of its Japanese factories, with the company admitting that it has forged the results of crash tests for more than 3o years.\nThe factory shutdowns will last at least through the end of January and affect around 9,000 employees; there’s no word on whether Daihatsu’s plants in Indonesia and Malaysia will be affected. The shutdowns come after transport ministry officials conducted a deeper probe following the previous findings, as CNN reports:\nRead more\nADVERTISEMENT Rebel Moon's Ed Skrein on Co-Starring With His Game of Thrones Replacement\nThe Best RPGs Of 2023\nThe State Of The Nintendo Switch In 2023\nGypsy Rose Blanchard has been released from prison and hopes to meet Taylor Swift\nChinese Chess Champ Stripped Of Title After Taking A Dump In A Bathtub\nThe latest probe further threatens the company’s reputation. According to a report released last Wednesday by the investigative committee, 174 more cases were found of Daihatsu manipulating data, making false statements or improperly tinkering with vehicles to pass safety certification tests.\nAccording to the investigation, the oldest case is from 1989, while the volume of cases has notably increased since 2014. Some of the affected models fall under the Mazda, Subaru and Toyota brands. Following the news Toyota’s shares dropped four percent, and the company released a statement about the situation. From CNN:\nIn response, the Japanese behemoth has promised to shake up its subsidiary, saying in a statement last week that “fundamental reform is needed to revitalize Daihatsu.”\n“This will be an extremely significant task that cannot be accomplished overnight,” Toyota said, adding that it would require a sweeping review of management, operations, and how the unit was structured.\n“We recognize the extreme gravity of the fact that Daihatsu’s neglect of the certification process has shaken the very foundations of the company as an automobile manufacturer,” Toyota added.\nStory continues There have been no reports of accidents or deaths due to the rigged tests. Daihatsu was first founded in 1951, with Toyota first becoming a major shareholder in 1967, increasing its stake to 51.2 percent in 1998 and taking on Daihatsu as a wholly owned subsidiary in 2016. Daihatsu mostly focuses on small cars and trucks , especially kei vehicles, and it has produced more than 1.1 million cars so far this year.\nMore from Jalopnik\nThe Best Movies You May Have Missed in 2023, and Where to Stream Them\nResearchers Uncover the ‘Most Sophisticated’ iPhone Exploit Ever\nXbox Slammed For AI-Generated Art Promoting Indie Games\nWegovy and Other New Weight Loss Drugs Actually Work—so What's Next?\nIDIOT OF THE YEAR: It's the final countdown (Nos. 10-1)\nSign up for Jalopnik's Newsletter.

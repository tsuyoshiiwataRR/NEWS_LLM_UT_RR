    "text": "DA's Office Investigating Fatal Officer-Involved Shooting in Mount Joy Township\nThe Lancaster County District Attorney’s Office is investigating a fatal officer-involved shooting Thursday afternoon in Mount Joy Township.\nThe incident occurred at approximately 2:51 p.m. in the 1500 block of S. Market Street, Elizabethtown, and involved a wanted suspect.\nMembers of the United States Marshals’ Eastern District Violent Crimes Task Force were attempting to locate the individual to serve an arrest warrant. The task force members encountered the subject in the area of the 1500 block of S. Market Street when the incident occurred.\nPreliminary information gathered thus far indicates that officers fired at the suspect, the suspect was pronounced dead, and a firearm was found at the scene near the suspect.\nThe review is in its preliminary stages and additional information will be released when appropriate. Lancaster County District Attorney Heather Adams will review the incident and make a determination, at a later date, on the police use of force.\nMEDIA CONTACT: Sean McBryan, ; Twitter: @SeanMcBryanLanc.",

Officers with the Yakima Police Department were called to the hotel after people reported a shooting had just happened. When officers got to the scene, they said they found two men were suffering from gunshot wounds, but it did not appear the wounds were life-threatening. The men were taken to a nearby hospital. Authorities said their initial investigation indicated there may have been a robbery that resulted in gunfire, but the investigation is ongoing. They are asking people with information to call the Yakima Police Department at 509-575-6200. If a person wants to stay anonymous, they can submit a tip at Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.

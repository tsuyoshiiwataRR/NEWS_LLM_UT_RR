    "text": "A 12-year-old London boy is becoming known in the [world](https://www.world-today-news.com/category/world/) of classical music. Spencer Chu is a violinist who spends up to 4 hours a day practicing his craft. “Playing the violin at this level requires a lot of hard work,” he told CTV [News](https://www.world-today-news.com/category/news/) London. But Chu said the instrument gives back in unexpected ways, “It just lets me share my emotions in ways words can’t.” Spencer recently won first place in an [international](https://www.world-today-news.com/tag/international/) competition. It earned him the right to take centre stage at Carnegie Hall in [New York](https://www.world-today-news.com/tag/new-york/) City. “We thought it was a long shot at first. But I got to go, and it was an amazing experience,” he said. One, his family and his music teacher shared with him. Spencer’s dad, Micheal, a prominent London cardiac surgeon, admited his own heart was racing as he watched his son enter Carnegie. Yet, he was amazed to see his Spencer’s composure. “I could imagine it would be paralyzing with the nerves of it. But he really embraced it and performed with such incredible grace and maturity,” said Michael. With Carnegie Hall now etched in his mind, Spencer’s future includes the potential to play in Italy next year. It might seem like a lot of pressure on a young man, but Spencer said he is ready, “I get to do this, and I’m prepared, so I should enjoy it!” His father can only agree, “We’re over the moon! Spencer is really a talented kid and he’s worked really hard for this. So, he deserves all of the accolades.” [Read more: Orders for guarding the Ministry of the Interior were received after 17 years.

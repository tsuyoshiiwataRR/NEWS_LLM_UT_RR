Five Indian, four Russians, two Koreans, an Australian, Argentinian, French and Irish were among the victims.\nThe following videos appeared on social media, viewers discretion advised:\nA video reportedly to be the final moments before the accident shows the aircraft banking and then rolling towards the ground.\n[pic.twitter.com/f1pSXmrOVH]\n— Breaking Aviation News & Videos (@aviationbrk)\n[January 15, 2023]\nThe aircraft crashed into forested land located on the banks of the Seti Gandaki river that flows between the old domestic airport and Pokhra International Airport.

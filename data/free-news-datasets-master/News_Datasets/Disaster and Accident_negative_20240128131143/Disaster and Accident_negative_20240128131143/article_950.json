    "text": "Coroner identifies armed man killed in deputy involved shooting in Greenville County The Greenville County Coroner's Office has identified the armed man killed in the deputy involved shooting. The coroner has identified the man as Walter Lester McDonald III, 81, of Greenville. Lt. Ryan Flood with the Greenville County Sheriff's Office said a 911 call came in about 5:15 p.m. about a disturbance between a man and woman at a home on Pequot Drive in Greenville. When deputies arrived on the scene, they came in contact with McDonald and challenged him to drop his weapon, according to officials. (Video below: Announcement from Sheriff Hobart Lewis) The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division said in a news release that following the interaction, deputies shot the armed man.

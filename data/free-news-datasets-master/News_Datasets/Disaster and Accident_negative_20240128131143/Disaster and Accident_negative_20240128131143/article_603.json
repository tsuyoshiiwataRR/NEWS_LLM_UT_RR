    "text": "Panaji: Four houses located along the canal coming from the Tillari reservoir in Sodiem-Siolim saw water entering their houses on Thursday morning, after the canal overflowed. Locals said that one resident’s compound wall collapsed due to the force of the water flow, while another local suffered damages to his car repair workshop.Locals said that drains had also not been cleared in Sodiem-Siolim, which caused the water to enter the homes.Water supply from the Tillari reservoir to Goa was shut for canal repair works and maintenance for almost 45 days and was restored on Thursday.“The water resources department personnel had not cleared the channels of the canals, which caused the water to overflow. The panchayat usually clears the drain before or during the monsoon months. As no rainfall was expected, the drains had naturally not been cleared. Who has foreseen such an incident?” said the local sarpanch Deepa Pednekar.She said that the water resources department has been constantly requested by the Siolim panchayat to keep the channels of the canal clear of debris.“For last many years, we have been struggling to get the WRD to fix the water flowing from the canal into the fields in Siolim. The fields are lying uncultivated because of the unexpected overflow from the canal. During March-April, just as the harvest is about to dry, the water from the canal gushes into the fields, causing the harvest to be ruined,” said Pednekar.On Thursday, the water flow into the houses began at around 9.30am. The panchayat was informed around 10am, after which the efforts began to clear the drains. The situation was under control by Thursday evening.“The flow of the water from the canal was so high that it was difficult to stand outside these four houses that were affected. This has caused major inconvenience to the residents,” the sarpanch said.",

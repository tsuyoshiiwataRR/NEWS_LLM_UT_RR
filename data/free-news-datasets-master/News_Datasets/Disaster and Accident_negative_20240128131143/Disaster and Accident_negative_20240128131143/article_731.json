    "text": "Jake Smith Daily Caller News Foundation Advertisement - story continues below A second American hostage in the Gaza Strip was confirmed dead on Thursday, according to multiple reports. Judy Weinstein Haggai, a 70-year-old American-Israeli dual citizen, was confirmed dead on Thursday, roughly a week after her husband, Gadi, was also [declared](https://dailycaller.com/2023/12/22/american-hostage-hamas-dead-gaza/) to have died, Israel National News [reported](https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/382714). There are approximately six American hostages remaining in Gaza, [according](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/hamas-hostages-israel-gaza-41432124?mod=world_lead_story) to The Wall Street Journal.

Their bodies remain in Hamas captivity in Gaza. Advertisement - story continues below The two leave behind four children and seven grandchildren, [according](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israeli-american-judith-weinstein-was-murdered-on-oct-7-her-body-being-held-in-gaza-kibbutz/) to The Times of Israel. Judy was an English teacher who worked with special needs children, [and](https://www.timesofisrael.com/kibbutz-says-gadi-haggai-abducted-oct-7-died-in-hamas-captivity-body-held-in-gaza/) Gadi was a musician and retired chef. “[Judy was] a poet and an entrepreneur who loved to create and was dedicated to working for peace and friendship,” Kibbutz Nir Oz said in a statement on Thursday, according to The Times of Israel. “[Gadi was] a musician at heart, a gifted flautist, he played in the IDF Orchestra and was involved with music his whole life,” The Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum said in a statement reported on Friday. Hamas is currently holding about 129 hostages in Gaza, 118 of whom are Israeli citizens or dual citizens, and 23 of whom are believed to be dead in captivity, according to The Wall Street Journal. A previous short-term truce deal between Hamas and Israel allowed for the release of over 100 hostages, but it [ended](https://dailycaller.com/2023/12/01/israel-hamas-war-reignites-truce-extension/) after Hamas broke the terms of the deal. Getting the remaining hostages out is “going to be a long process,” President Joe Biden said on Dec. 5, according to the WSJ. The U.S. has been [working](https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/28/cia-director-lands-qatar-secret-talks-israeli-intelligence-over-additional-hostage-releases/) with Israel and Qatar to try and strike another temporary truce agreement with Hamas to allow for the release of the remaining hostages.

IMPORTANT NOTE TO WND READERS: America – long the freest, most prosperous, powerful, altruistic and Christian nation on earth – is on the brink of destruction. Every decent and aware American adult knows this. The evidence is everywhere. Advertisement - story continues below Democrat politicians today overwhelmingly favor late-term abortion up to the very moment of birth – formerly known as \"infanticide.\" They encourage children too young to drive or vote to have their breasts and/or sex organs amputated in pursuit of a \"gender transition\" that is both delusional and impossible, and which leads to staggering rates of depression and suicide. They have not just allowed, but ENGINEERED, a full-scale foreign invasion of America across her southern border. Their standard bearer, President Joe Biden – a senile, pathologically dishonest and epically corrupt career political hack – is destroying America's economy, energy sector, military, law enforcement, election integrity, national security, Constitution and overall national wellbeing as rapidly as possible. At the same time, Team Biden demonizes and, increasingly, IMPRISONS critics as \"violent extremists,\" \"domestic terrorists,\" \"white supremacists\" and \"insurrectionists.\" Indeed, they're currently engaged in an obviously corrupt multi-front legal war against Biden's chief political rival, Donald J. Trump, in an attempt to send the 45th president of the United States to prison for the rest of his life. None of this constitutes \"politics\" in any conventional or traditional American sense. Rather, it is all darkly spiritual. The greatest nation on earth is in the throes of a full-blown spiritual war between good and evil.

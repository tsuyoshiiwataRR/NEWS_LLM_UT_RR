    "text": "JOHNSON COUNTY, Texas â€” The Texas Department of Safety said it will \"take time\" to investigate [a deadly crash that happened in Johnson County the day after Christmas.](/article/news/local/five-killed-johnson-county-crash/287-8b62a11e-69d5-48de-aca2-e2c579cbff9799-978a-577b57d46349) Six people, including two children, were killed and three others were injured in the crash involving a Honda Odyssey minivan and Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. All who died were in the Odyssey. DPS identified those killed as 9-year-old Nishidha Potabathula, 10-year-old Krithik Potabathula, 28-year-old Rushil Barri, 36-year-old Naveena Potabathula, 60-year-old Sitamahalakshmi Ponnada and 64-year-old Nageswararao Ponnada. All victims are related. One other family member in the Odyssey is among the injured. The other two victims injured were in the Silverado -- a 17-year-old driver and a 17-year-old passenger. \"This is very tragic,\" Sgt. William Lockridge told WFAA. \"It's tragic both for the surviving members of this family and for the other young men involved in the crash.\" The investigation into what happened, and why, is only just beginning. Lockridge said it will \"take time.\" \"The three survivors are all in a medically induced comas so investigators can't talk to them,\" Lockridge said. The crash happed on U.S. 67 in the area of CR 1119 between Glen Rose and Cleburne. Lockridge said investigators will look into whether this stretch of road has a history of crashes and what the conditions were like on Tuesday. According to Lockridge, investigators have obtained warrants for cell phones, medical records, and control modules in the cars involved. He described the modules as computers inside the car with crash data recorders. \"That information will give them the vehicle speeds, any break speeds, anything like that,\" said Lockridge. \"It's all valuable evidence.\" DPS said the 17-year-old driver of the Silverado veered into a no passing area, but said it is too early to determine whether charges will be filed. \"Until we can speak with the driver of the pickup and the passenger of the pickup, we really can't say. Were they attempting to pass? Attempting to turn early? Is there some other factor?\" said Lockridge. Meanwhile, friends of Barri's and Indo-American organizations are [working to get the victims' remains to India to their loved ones.](/article/traffic/loved-ones-mourn-loss-six-family-members-who-died-johnson-county-crash-while-seventh-family-member-is-still-fighting-for-life/287-7c7f886d-2769-4b99-978a-577b57d46349)",

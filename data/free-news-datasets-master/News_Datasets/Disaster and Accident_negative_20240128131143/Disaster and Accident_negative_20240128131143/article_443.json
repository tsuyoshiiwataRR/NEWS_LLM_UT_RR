    "text": "An 18-wheeler truck ended up with its cab hanging over the edge of a bridge in Palm Beach County, Florida last week. Firefighters used their bucket to approach the semi’s door and rescue the driver who, along with his truck, was hanging in midair. Details on the moments leading up to [the crash ](https://www.carscoops.com/tag/accidents/)haven’t been shared, but reports indicate that it was raining heavily on December 23, the day of the crash. Based on photos of the scene, the truck appears to have plowed head on into a concrete barrier. Fortunately, the obstacle slowed the truck enough to prevent it from falling off an overpass and onto the Florida Turnpike. Unfortunately, most of the cab was [left cantilevering](https://www.carscoops.com/tag/offbeat-news/) over the edge of the bridge, held aloft by the [weight of its trailer](https://www.carscoops.com/2023/12/why-was-this-tesla-model-y-towing-a-10000-lbs-trailer-around-texas/), preventing the driver from escaping. Read: [Man Walks Away After VW Nosedives 40ft From 4-Story Parking Garage](https://www.carscoops.com/2023/12/man-walks-away-uninjured-after-vw-nosedives-40ft-from-4-story-parking-garage/) PBCFR / Facebook [Palm Beach](https://www.carscoops.com/tag/florida/) County Fire Rescue (PBCFR) reports that after firefighters arrived on the scene, they first worked to brace the truck, and prevent it from falling any farther. They used straps and chains in order to keep the driver and rescue workers safe. Once the cab was shored up, two firefighters entered the bucket of a fire engine, which was raised to the level of the driver door. They harnessed the occupant before guiding him into the bucket with them, and lowering him down to ground level. “He was scared to move,” PBCFR Captain Duane Hodges told [WPBF](https://www.wpbf.com/article/florida-cold-front-rains-palm-beaches-treasure-coast/46235819). “But as I was able to convince him that he needed to come out, he was kind of frozen initially and happy to see us. I don’t think he really wanted to let go of where he was at.” After the rescue, the driver is seen being taken away from the scene in a stretcher. He was taken to a hospital for observation, but was released in time to spend Christmas day with his family. While the incident ended miraculously well for the truck driver, it ended less well for two other drivers, who PBCFR reports crashed near the scene while taking cellphone videos of the incident. Don’t forget to keep your eyes on the road, folks.",

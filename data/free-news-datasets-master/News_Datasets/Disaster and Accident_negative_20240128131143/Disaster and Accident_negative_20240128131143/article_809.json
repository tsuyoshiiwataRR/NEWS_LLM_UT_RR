At 7:30 p.m. the left and middle lanes have reopened while the right lane will remain closed until ODOT can make repairs to the guardrail. According to the preliminary investigation, the crash south of Benchwood and Wyse roads and near Needmore Road involved a semitrailer and two passenger vehicles. The driver of one of the passenger vehicles was taken to Miami Valley Hospital’s main campus. The driver of the other passenger car was taken to Grandview. Their injuries are believed to be non-life-threatening, according to the state patrol. The driver of the semitrailer was not injured.

    "text": "Doris H. McKellar\nPublished 4:46 pm Thursday, December 28, 2023\nJACKSON, NC – Mrs. Doris Hurley McKellar, 99, of Jackson, passed away on December 22, 2023.\nMrs. McKellar was born January 21, 1924 in Milton, NC, the daughter of the Rev. John Bascom Hurley and Daisy Fuqua Hurley. She grew up in a Methodist household, was a fine athlete in school, and graduated from Seaboard High School, and later she attended Greensboro College and, of all places, Duke University.\nShe was predeceased by her parents; her husbands, Matt W. Ransom III in 1944, and Angus A. McKellar in 1972; and also her four siblings, Nita, Bascom, Billy and Darel.\nDoris was survived by her sons, Matt Ransom IV (Alice) of Little River, SC, John McKellar (Nan) of Jackson, and Benjie McKellar (Caroline) of Chapel Hill. She is also survived by five grandchildren and nine great-grands.\nGraveside services will be held in Rowland, NC at a later date.\nWhile the last few years have been difficult, she lived a long and healthy life, and she took good care of herself. A homemaker, she enjoyed playing bridge with her buddies, listening to Frank Sinatra, and walking the sidewalks of Jackson in her purple tennis shoes. Her favorite activity was shopping for clothes —- and she was good at it! Her grandchildren called her “Mama Doris”.\nMay she rest in peace.\nArrangements are being handled by Askew Funeral and Cremation Services – Jackson Chapel.",

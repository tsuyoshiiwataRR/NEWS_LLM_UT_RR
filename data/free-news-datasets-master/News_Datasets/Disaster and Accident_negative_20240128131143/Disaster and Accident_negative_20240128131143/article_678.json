    "text": "SANTEE, S.C. â€” Days after a fire destroyed their business, the owners of Lone Star Barbecue and Mercantile in Santee say they're holding onto hope this won't be the final chapter of their business.\nWhile most families in the Midlands gather together to celebrate, for Corey Henderson and his family, the two days after the holiday were spent cleaning up the remnants of Lone Star Barbeque.\nHenderson recalls getting a call on Christmas that the building was on fire.\n\"It was just engulfed,\" Henderson said. \"We just couldn't believe any of this was happening and what was happening. What was flashing across my mind as it was going, it sounds crazy, is our employees.\"\nHenderson's family has owned Lone Star for three years, continuing centuries of tradition in the Santee community. The business has been in South Carolina for decades, starting in Lone Star, before it moved to Santee.\nThe property used to house historic buildings, which were over one hundred years old, dating back from 1896 to 1926.\nAccording to Santee Fire Department Chief Edward Barnett, the fire began at some point around 7:30 p.m. on the 25th. He said those old buildings were a complete loss following the fire, which is still under investigation.\n\"We could see the flames, about tree high tall so we knew we had a working structure fire,\" Barnett said. \"We had a total of 9 fire departments and approximately 50 firefighters, we had plenty of help, plenty of manpower.\"\nLate Wednesday night, we saw firefighters back on the scene putting out some of the hotspots. Henderson says the past two days have been emotional, receiving support from the Santee community and around the country.\n\"Travelers from New York, Florida, and Texas have been calling. It's been incredible,\" Henderson said.\nHenderson said the focus is getting back up on their feet and helping the employees.\n\"I don't want to let them down or the community and people who have helped me out throughout the years. I want to prove to them, too, I'm strong. If we can afford it or if we can get it worked out, we can rebuild stronger, and we can get the community and surrounding areas to help put other antiques out and get with, [previous owners] Mr. Williams and Chris, and see anything we have to try to bring this place back to life.\"\nHenderson says Lone Star plans to hold a fundraiser here on January 20th to raise money for the employees who are now out of work.",

    "text": "Family mourning, grateful for community support after missing Eagle River woman fell under the ice EAGLE RIVER, Alaska (KTUU) - The family of an Eagle River nurse, wife and mom who went missing in icy waters over the Christmas weekend trying to save her dog, are in shock and say the kindness from the community is beyond words. After four days of searching, Alaska Wildlife Troopers have [suspended the active search efforts](https://dailydispatch.dps.alaska.gov/Home/DisplayIncident?incidentNumber=AK23131423) for Amanda Richmond Rogers, who went missing last Saturday near North Fork Eagle River Trail. On Thursday night, Jennifer Richmond, the sister of Amanda Richmond Rogers, released the following statement: “The Alaska State Troopers informed our family on Dec 27 that the active search for my sister, Amanda Richmond Rogers, has been suspended. In our families’ grief, we want to extend our heartfelt gratitude to the [Alaska Dive Search Rescue and Recovery Team](https://sites.google.com/inetwiz.com/akdiverescue/memorial-fund?authuser=0), a non-profit organization of volunteers who spent the past few days, literally on their hands and knees when not actually diving in the river where Mandy disappeared, shepherding a sonar device through the icy waters. As many who knew Mandy know, she loved all animals, but especially her dogs. Indeed, it was in a rescue attempt for her dog Groot that she dove into the mostly frozen river. She would’ve made this choice for her dogs and family again, without a second thought. We know that those at the [Alaska Solstice Search Dogs](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fwww.alaskasolsticesearchdogs.com%2f&c=E,1,RjFHc8yQQ-D4LTqejQ-ANkou2Z3Lbx71Dt4JtS3hQGS6ILZu9Vp90tTo3qDZy9mgSZ1iwL9q14qYT7gl7-cD0pqWV6SKl8XjvqCLsBxzW4s,&typo=1), who were also involved in her search, committed their time and energy with the same dedication Mandy had for her own family, both dog and human (her four sons were her life). It is to these two organizations that we have created a Memorial Fund to honor both her name and their work. We have created a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61554977644365) for those who want more information on donations, our continued search, our upcoming celebration of life and to share stories of the beautiful life of an infinitely kind and generous soul. As we hold each other close, we try to find comfort in knowing that Mandy, who loved mermaids, is now swimming free as our arctic angel who continues to bless all those lucky enough to have brushed against her enormous heart.” Troopers say Richmond Rogers disappeared [under the frozen open water](https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2023/12/24/search-rescue-woman-falls-through-ice-eagle-river/) of the North Fork of Eagle River while trying to rescue her dog that had fallen into the water. “We have run out of areas of interest that are accessible to search with the ice and the conditions in the area,” Alaska State Troopers spokesperson Austin McDaniel said. “This certainly was not the result we were looking for and we’re definitely open to looking for new information, new evidence that might help us narrow down that search area.” Drones, helicopters, divers, K9 teams, sonar and remotely operated vehicles (ROV) were all employed, according to AST. Besides the troopers, the Anchorage Police Department, Anchorage Fire Department and the Alaska Dive Search, Rescue and Recovery Team also contributed to the search. “Anytime you’re searching under the ice for somebody, it is not an easy area to search in,” McDaniel said. “You have varying thicknesses of ice, it’s a winding river, varying depths of that river, different channels within the river.” The dive team encountered some equipment issues during the search, according to McDaniel, but he added that weather was not a major impediment to the search. “I don’t think the outside weather conditions are restricting us. It’s just the thicknesses of the ice, the depths of the water really make it a more challenging environment to search in,” he said. APD lists Richmond Rogers as a missing person. Copyright 2023 KTUU.

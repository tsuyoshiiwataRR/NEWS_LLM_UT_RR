    "text": "CHAMBLEE, Ga. — The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is investigating [after an officer-involved shooting in Chamblee](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/dekalb-county/officer-involved-shooting-investigation-underway-near-dekalb-county-walgreens-police-say/NJUMU6ATARHJ5G443ZKUNBJTJE/) on Thursday morning. Investigators said officers pulled over a suspected stolen SUV around 7:45 a.m. in a Walgreens parking lot in the 5300 block of Peachtree Boulevard. At some point during the stop, an officer fired his gun and the driver was hit. “There was more than one shot fired. As far as the number of times the person was that has not been determined by any of here,” Chamblee Police Chief Michael Dieppa said.

It’s also unclear if the driver was armed or if he fired any shots at officers. Thursday afternoon, the [GBI identified the suspect as Jeremiah Quincy Kinard](https://gbi.georgia.gov/press-releases/2023-12-28/gbi-investigates-officer-involved-shooting-chamblee-ga), 24 of Auburn, Ga. He’s still receiving medical treatment, according to the GBI. No officers were injured.

Last year, GBI responded to 112. [SIGN UP: [WSB-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter](https://membercenter.wsbtv.com/newsletters)] IN OTHER NEWS: ©2023 Cox Media Group",

    "text": "[newsBot](/members/newsbot.9529/)\nAutomated News Bot\nStaff member\nThe deceased is identified as William Minahan, 88, of Easton. He was the driver of an Acura TSX involved in the crash. The driver of a Dodge Caravan, identified as Kathleen Strawbridge, 24, of Glen Burnie and her 2-year-old child were transported by ambulance to Luminis Health Anne Arundel Medical Center for treatment of their injuries.\nShortly before noon, troopers from the Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack responded to the area of Ocean Gateway (Route 50) and Pippin Farm Lane for a report of a two-vehicle crash. According to a preliminary investigation, the Dodge, operated by Strawbridge, was traveling west on Route 50 while at the same time, the Acura, operated by Minahan, was attempting to turn onto Ocean Gateway from a parking lot when it failed to yield the right of way subsequently causing the Dodge to strike the Acura.\nRoute 50 was closed for more than 3 hours for the crash investigation. Personnel from the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration assisted with road closures. The Maryland State Police Crash Team is leading the investigation.\nThe cause of the crash is under investigation.\n###\nCONTACT: Office of Media Communications,\nDisclaimer: In the U.S.A., all persons accused of a crime by the State are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

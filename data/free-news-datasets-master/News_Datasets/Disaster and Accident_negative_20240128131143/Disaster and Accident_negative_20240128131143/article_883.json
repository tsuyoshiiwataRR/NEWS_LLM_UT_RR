Grace United Urban Ministries in the Historic Capitol Hill District sustained major water damage after a fire started in the space above the ministry. Just after 6 p.m., flames began shooting out of the building along Southwest 25th Street, shattering windows and causing a puddle of problems. “We got a lot of water damage that came through the second floor,\" said Donna Heins, the pastor of Grace United Urban Ministries. \"We help the homeless get back on their feet. We do case management and feed them a meal.\" The ministry moved into the building just six months ago, but it has served those experiencing homelessness for almost 20 years. Donna and her husband, Marco, have dedicated their lives to helping those in need. \"When it’s a calling, it’s just a part of you. I can’t get rid of it,\" said Donna. Now, the ministry needs a new home, too. \"The ceiling as of last night was still intact, but through the night, it has fallen,\" said Donna. \"We’re going to have to relocate because it is too much damage, and OG&E and the fire marshal said they’re not going to turn on the electricity to the building.\" On Thursday, volunteers worked to salvage what they can. \"This is where we have dinner. The guys have been taking out the tables,\" said Donna. Oklahoma City firefighters located a space heater near the origin, but they said the cause is still undetermined.

He found out on Thursday that it wasn't insured. \"We’re just really in a time of need,\" said Marco. Caught underneath drooping ceilings and ankle-deep in troubles, the ministry said their big concern is how to keep serving. “We literally have to learn how to walk on water to keep going,\" said Donna. \"If you have a building for lease or something you could help us with, we really want to stay in this area.\" Top Headlines [Attorney: Glynn Simmons, who wrongfully spent nearly 50 years in prison for murder, diagnosed with cancer](https://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-glynn-simmons-diagnosed-with-cancer/46229863) [37-year-old New Year's Eve tradition in Oklahoma City will not continue](https://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-city-new-years-eve-opening-night/46230744) [FORECAST: Snow possible in parts of Oklahoma with lingering cold temperatures](https://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-weather-forecast-snow-cold-thursday/46241492) [Mega Millions winner claims record $1.6 billion prize after buying ticket in Florida](https://www.koco.com/article/mega-millions-florida-winner-claim/46237550) [Oklahoma restaurant booming after viral social media post](https://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-norman-spirals-hot-dog/46229717)",

    "text": "COLUMBIA âˆ’ The attorney for a Columbia woman charged with arson in Dunklin County filed a motion for a change of venue Wednesday.\nCrystal Umfress, who owns Casa Maria's Mexican Cantina in Columbia, faces a second-degree arson charge in connection to a July 10 fire at Lupita's Mexican Restaurant in Kennett.\nAccording to court documents, a witness claimed Umfress paid her nearly $1,500 to burn down the restaurant. The witness and a second defendant, Kerry Raymond, allegedly went to the restaurant, where Raymond allegedly ignited the fire by using a gasoline container and alcohol.\nSurveillance footage from the restaurant captured the ignition:\nVideo shared by the Kennett Fire Department shows a suspect enter a backdoor to Lupita's Mexican Restaurant in Kennett, Missouri, on July 10, 2023. A Columbia woman is charged with arson in connection to the fire.\nKAIT 8 / Kennett Fire Department Success! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup.\nError!

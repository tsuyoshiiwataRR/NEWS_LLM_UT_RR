There was a lot of blood.\n‘He brought him to shore but I think it was too late by then.’\nEmergency services tried desperately to save the teen but his injuries were unsurvivable.\nFriends have paid tribute to the youngster online, with one posting on social media: ‘Fly high Kai – lots of love and missing you already’.\nHis aunt Lauryn Barley has now set up a GoFundMe appeal to raise funds for the family in the wake of the tragedy.\n‘Our beloved Khai was suddenly taken from us by a white pointer while surfing at Ethel Wreck off the coast of Yorke Penisula,’ she posted.\n‘I’m here to try help raise funds for my sister, Kate and brother, Tim to cover the cost of the funeral service.’\nA family friend added: ‘Life can change in a second and we are never prepared.\n‘Our friend’s son and grandson Khai died yesterday in a shark attack which has not only rocked a family yet a whole community.\n‘As a community we come together and this is one way we can support this family right now. Thank you for your kindness.’\nAnother added: ‘A boy with so much potential. He will hold a place in everyone’s heart.’\nThe shark attack, near Ethel Beach (pictured) in the Innes National Park, on the Yorke Peninsula, was reported to police at about 1.30pm on Thursday\nA local fisherman said that large sharks are a common sight along Marion Bay at the Innes National Park.\n‘We’ve seen some pretty big bronzies in the area, but that’s normal here,’ he said.\n‘I went to take the boat out and the road to Ethel’s was blocked by rangers.\n‘There’s no cell reception out there in the park so we didn’t know what had happened until we got back to Marion Bay.’\nThere have been several shark attacks around South Australia in recent months.\nIn mid-November, Bridgette O’Shannessy, 32, was attacked while swimming with her partner off a reef shelf at Port Noarlunga, south of Adelaide.\nMs O’Shannessy had to undergo two surgeries at Flinders Medical Centre after losing some of her teeth and suffering nerve damage.\nBridgette O’Shannessy, 32, (left) was attacked while swimming with her partner off a reef shelf at Port Noarlunga, south of Adelaide, in November while Tod Gendle, 55, (right) was killed by a four-metre great white while surfing near Granite Rock, close to Streaky Bay, on October 31\nHer attack came just weeks after 55-year-old surfer Tod Gendle was mauled to death by a huge 4.2-metre Great White shark near Granite Rock south of Streaky Bay, SA.\nWitnesses described the moment the shark launched at the surfer before he was dragged underwater by the animal.\nSouth Australian woman Pamela Cook was also mauled by a shark at Beachport on October 2.\nThe 64-year-old was on her morning swim with local community group Beachport Sea Urchins and Slugs when she was attacked shortly before 8am.\nJust months earlier in May, 46-year-old Elliston man Simon Baccanello was killed in a shark attack on Walkers Rocks Beach.\nMore to follow",

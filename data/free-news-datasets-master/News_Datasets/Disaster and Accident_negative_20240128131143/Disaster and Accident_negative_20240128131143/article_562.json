    "text": "ATLANTA â€” Editor's note: A previous version of this story stated that Kustas drove a 2013 silver Hyundai Tucson, per the family. The Atlanta Police Department later confirmed the correct year and model of the vehicle. A 23-year-old Buckhead resident hasn't been heard from in over a month, raising concerns for his safety, according to his family. Jordan Kustas, an Auburn University graduate who had been living in the Buckhead area post-graduation, hasn't spoken to his family since Nov. 15, when his mom received a text from an unknown number stating it was her son. His mother said she found it odd that the text came from that number and not his primary number, as they all share a phone plan. The last activity associated with his phone on the shared plan was made on Nov. 28, according to phone records obtained by his family. In a [Facebook post](http://Not knowing if he is okay has been so incredibly difficult.) by his sister Paige, she said Kustas also hasn't been to his apartment in over a month. He was most recently living at an apartment complex off of Morosgo Drive in northeast Atlanta. In the missing persons report obtained by 11Alive, Jordan's family mentioned to police they have had concerns about gambling issues in the past but don't believe it is connected to his disappearance. They say, most importantly, they just want to know if Jordan is OK. \"He has missed his birthday, Thanksgiving, Christmas,\" the post reads, in part. \"Not knowing if he is okay has been so incredibly difficult.\" The Atlanta Police Department confirms a missing persons report was filed for Kustas' family on Christmas Day. APD confirmed that Kustas drives a 2015 gray Hyundai Santa Fe with North Carolina tag TJV 1304. Police say his vehicle was last picked up on the FLOCK system on Dec. 1 just before 9 a.m. on Brookhaven Drive, off of Peachtree Road in Atlanta. His family believes his golden doodle, Brooks, is with him since the dog has not been heard at the apartment. His family is hoping someone has seen or talked to him recently. Their top priority is knowing Jordan is safe. Anyone with information on Kustas' whereabouts is asked to contact the [Atlanta Police Department](https://www.facebook.com/AtlantaPoliceDpt?__cft__[0]=AZXBA58qOVyfCnSnRxG6yF7VTfVerlWSSrtI2xALTV_0Tc6t14OFYbwDaoc8fqsgHO1CootSVIG6ixPpajo9aTNxwIX0sTZeGu25oUjICR1qzMM0HJ2Gpm_Fua0WgOqSxBw7h_2cKykOw4jqrR558MXH-9p4O1xVuxtP6OB6Xf0TZNuUX0NsAKKiek-yhS0H93I&__tn__=-]K-R) or [Crime Stoppers Greater Atlanta](https://www.facebook.com/StopCrimeATL?__cft__[0]=AZXBA58qOVyfCnSnRxG6yF7VTfVerlWSSrtI2xALTV_0Tc6t14OFYbwDaoc8fqsgHO1CootSVIG6ixPpajo9aTNxwIX0sTZeGu25oUjICR1qzMM0HJ2Gpm_Fua0WgOqSxBw7h_2cKykOw4jqrR558MXH-9p4O1xVuxtP6OB6Xf0TZNuUX0NsAKKiek-yhS0H93I&__tn__=-]K-R).",

    "text": "A family yesterday told how they feared they were going to die as a tornado ripped their home to pieces.\nGareth and Lyndsey Moody and three of their children had a lucky escape when the twister struck shortly before midnight on Wednesday. They scrambled to safety over bricks, timber and slates after the tornado ripped off their roof and sent rubble plunging into their rooms. The home was one of 100 damaged in ­Stalybridge, Greater Manchester , as Storm Gerrit brought havoc to parts of the UK.\nThree men died yesterday after a 4x4 vehicle they were in plunged into the River Esk near Glaisdale on the North York Moors The storm caused travel chaos with roads closed and ferries and flights cancelled, while 1,500 homes were still without power last night. Gareth and Lyndsey, both 45, were in bed when the twister hit.\nMum-of-four Lyndsey, an A&E nurse, said: “We were lucky to get out alive. We could be dead. The house started shaking. I went to the window, it was like it was sucking in and out. The whole ceiling came down. I screamed, the hallway gave way. The chimney came down and took out the rest of the house.”\nCouncil licensing officer Gareth added: “I went downstairs and heard a loud crash. The lights went out and there was another loud crash. It was mayhem. I ran back upstairs and saw a huge hole in the landing.” Two of the couple’s sons, Jack, 22, and Thomas, 15, were in their bedrooms when the roof and chimney collapsed.\nIt smashed into Jack’s bedroom and destroyed the bathroom, flooding the kitchen. Gareth said: “How they are alive I don’t know. We were clambering over stuff to get out.” Daughter, Rebecca Saycell, 20, and husband Thomas, 27, were in their bedroom in the basement. They managed to flee with their dogs , Phoebe and Penny and cat Jessica.\nAcross Stalybridge the tornado ripped off roof tiles, uprooted trees, knocked down walls and sent debris flying into parked cars. Resident Peter Hall was shocked to find a tree had landed on the windscreen of his car. Hayley McCaffer, from the nearby village of Carrbrook, said: “Some of the houses are a disaster, the roof missing, gable ends gone, cars squished.” The Met Office said a “supercell thunderstorm” had caused the damage.\nLib Dem transport spokeswoman Wera Hobhouse urged Rishi Sunak to call a Cobra meeting to tackle the chaos in the area. Around 1,500 properties in ­ Scotland were still without electricity yesterday. Heavy snow, high winds and rain, downed power lines. Some households will not be reconnected until later today.\nA string of train ­operators, including LNER and Avanti West Coast, suspended or axed services. Ferries between Dover and France were delayed and Heathrow Airport cancelled 18 flights on Wednesday. The fastest wind gusts were 86mph at Inverbervie, Scotland, 84mph at Fair Isle in ­Shetland, and 83mph at Capel Curig, North Wales. The Met Office warned of more strong winds and rain today and tomorrow. And police urged people in affected areas to only travel if necessary.",

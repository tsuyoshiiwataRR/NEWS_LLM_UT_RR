    "text": "Plastic Re “ Grocery bags ” (Your Views, Dec. 21): The letter denigrating the proposed tax on plastic grocery bags echoes petrochemical industry greenwashing. The statement that plastic bags are easily recyclable is questionable considering the rising awareness of the limitations and outright falsehoods surrounding recycling.\nLike petroleum companies, plastics producers knew decades ago that their products were going to have long-term, negative effects on the environment. Both of these industries took steps to mitigate the potential public backlash. Petroleum companies formed powerful lobbies that worked to deny the effects their products would have on climate change. Plastic producers chose to push the idea of recycling to make the American people believe their wares could be sustainably reused.\nPointedly, the city of Virginia Beach recycling website asks residents to not place plastic bags or films in their curbside containers, the most accessible means of recycling available to citizens. Additionally research indicates that a mere 9% of plastic bags are ever recycled.\nJonathan Byers, Portsmouth\nNonviolence During this Advent season, the world has learned that the Israeli Defense Forces use an artificial intelligence-based system called Habsora (translated as “the Gospel” in English) to rapidly generate lists of targets in Gaza.\nTwo thousand years ago in the same part of the world, the Greek word translated “gospel” (euangelion) meant the “good news” of the Pax Romana, of Roman military victories that were spread by messengers to the ends of the empire.\nEarly in the first century Jewish peasants appropriated the term to describe the life and teaching of Jesus of Nazareth, who embodied the antithesis of warfare and empire. On the backroads of Galilee, Jesus shared his vision of a transformed people who loved their enemies, did good to those who hated them, and sold what they had and gave the money to the poor, loving God and loving other people as themselves. His last words to his community as he was being arrested were to “put up again thy sword.”\nEvery Christmas remembers this one who called followers to share whatever they had and to resist evil nonviolently, no matter the cost, as the way for earth to glimpse heaven. Again this Christmas, his gospel of nonviolent distributive justice and the imperial gospel of violent retributive justice vie for humanity’s devotion.\nSteve Baggarly, Norfolk\nBiden’s mess Re “ GOP obstacle ” (Your Views, Dec. 15): The writer blames Republicans for standing in the way of aid for Ukraine and touts the successes of the Biden administration policies. President Joe Biden is the one who included funds for the U.S. border in the Ukraine and Israel aid package.\nNo one in his or her right mind would vote for funds just to process more migrants. All the president has to do is agree to more actual border security measures (who wouldn’t want that?) and the Ukraine aid will be approved.\nWho can call the mess of Afghanistan a success? I doubt the average Ukrainian thinks what’s going on there is a big success (nor the relatives of the dead Russian soldiers). The people of Israel and Gaza are not cheering the current mess there.\nU.S. soldiers are getting attacked in Syria and Iraq by groups that appear to be encouraged by Iran. The Houthi rebels are routinely attacking international shipping. All these foreign policy “successes” are a direct result of the feckless policies of the Biden administration.\nHere at home the president’s poll numbers belie a success story. Evidence for the low polls is everywhere — just believe your lying eyes.\nHelmut Walter, Yorktown\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window)",

    "text": "65, Elmora, passed away December 27, 2023, at home. Born October 19, 1958, in Spangler, daughter of the late Robert and Bernetta (Hadley) Stratton. Survived by loving husband of 41 years, William J. Paronish, MD; children, Kelly Paronish, wife of Jonathan Christoff, Hastings; William J. Paronish Jr., husband of Trisha (Johnson), Export, PA; Tory Paronish, wife of Nick Giffen, Sterling, VA; Cassy Paronish, Elmora; and Robert J. Paronish, husband of Allyson (Becker), Hastings; and her beloved grandchildren, Gemma, Brielle, Oliver, Isla, William III, and Quinn. Also survived by sister, Sharon (Bret) Hayford, Hollidaysburg. Debra married her high school sweetheart and soulmate, Dr. Bill Paronish \"Pop\", and together raised their five beautiful children. Debra \"Mimi\" fiercely loved her children and all things family. She worked many years alongside Dr. Bill building a medical practice for the local community. At home, she thrived in her role as grandmother to their six grandchildren, who each embody the strong qualities of their grandmother. She spent as much time with them as possible and they brought her so much happiness and laughter. She loved to travel and explore the world on family trips where they shared beautiful sunsets, many adventures, and created lasting memories that will be forever cherished. She valued spending time with her sister, Sharon, and her family. She was a bright light in our world and together with Dr. Bill, they built a one-of-a-kind life focused on family and love. She believed in spending the time she had doing the things she loved with the people she loved most, and she peacefully passed on to her next adventure from the comfort of her home surrounded by her family.

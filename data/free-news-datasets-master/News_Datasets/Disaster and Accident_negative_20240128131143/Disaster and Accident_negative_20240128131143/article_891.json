    "text": "Excelsior Correspondent JAMMU Dec, 28: The Government at the Centre is employing divisive tactics to distract the public from pressing issues that demand immediate attention and resolution. This strategy, aimed at creating rifts among different sections of our society, is not only detrimental to the nation’s unity but also a clear indication of the Government’s inability to address core challenges. This was stated by Ajay Sadhotra, additional general secretary JKNC and former Minister while addressing a meeting of NC party workers of Nagrota Constituency at Sher-e-Kashmir Bhawan, Jammu. Provincial president JKNC, Jammu, Rattan Lal Gupta was also present. The meeting was presided over by Raghvir Singh Manhas District president Jammu Rural A JKNC, who apprised the senior functionaries about the problems being faced by the people of Nagrota Constituency with regard to shortage of basic amenities like scarcity of power and water supply, lack of healthcare faculties and civic amenities, etc. The senior NC leader emphasized that such actions are a deliberate attempt to divert attention from critical issues like economic downturns, unemployment, health crises, and educational reforms. He asserted that these issues are of paramount importance and require immediate and focused attention from both the Government and the public. By drawing attention away from these pivotal areas, he stated that the Government is not only neglecting its duty to address these concerns but also using divisive methods to distract the people, thereby undermining the democratic process and the overall welfare of the society. Sadhotra lamented that the development has come to a complete halt in Nagrota constituency under the incumbent proxy regime of Bharatiya Janata Party and the bureaucrat-centric administration is least bothered to address the iues othe common people in absence of a duly elected representative Government in place in this Union Territory. He asserted that the National Conference reaffirms its commitment to work towards a united and progressive India, where the welfare of every citizen is prioritized over political gains. Senior members Qazi Jalal, Sheikh Bashir Ahmed , Ayub Malik, Ankush. l Joint Secretary Jammu Province, Shahmim / Shamim Bwhus Begum DDC Dansal, Ch Rehmat Ali BDC Chairman, Kuldeep Sharma, Ghar Singh, Dr Vikas Sharma, Thoru Ram, Ajit Singh Manhas and others were also present.",

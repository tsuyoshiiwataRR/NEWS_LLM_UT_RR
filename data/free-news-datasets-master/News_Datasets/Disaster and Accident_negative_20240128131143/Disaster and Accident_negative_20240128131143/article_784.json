    "text": "A major fire broke out in a garage on Nijverheidsstraat in Heerhugowaard late this evening. The fire brigade is present in large numbers and a large area is currently being cordoned off. The N242 is closed, and the fire brigade is calling on people to stay away from the smoke. video-caption\">First images of major fire Heerhugowaard â€“ VLN News Initial images show flames shooting out of the roof of the company. The fire may spread more quickly because the wind is blowing very hard in the region, thanks to storm Gerrit. According to the fire brigade, the building where the fire started has completely burned out and can be considered a loss. Efforts are now being made to prevent spillover to other buildings. The fire started around 10:30 PM and the police are busy cordoning off a large area around the building. The company is located close to the Heerhugowaard train station, but for the time being there appear to be no disruptions to the train connection. The N242 runs on the other side of the company. Due to the smoke development, it was closed by the emergency services near Heerhugowaard. It is unclear for how long. The fire brigade warns people to stay away from the smoke. Measurements are taken to see exactly how far the smoke spreads. The fire brigade has warned people not to approach the fire. They emphatically ask for space to be given to the emergency services. It is currently unclear whether people were still present in the building when the fire broke out. It is also not yet known whether there have been any injuries.

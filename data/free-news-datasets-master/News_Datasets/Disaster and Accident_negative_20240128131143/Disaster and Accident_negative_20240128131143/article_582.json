    "text": "[Donate to the Israeli-Palestinian Crisis Appeal](?form=israelipalestiniancrisis) The terrible situation in Gaza is tearing lives apart. Your donation today will help with the practical support to help where possible. 2023 has not been without its challenges – from conflicts new and ongoing, to droughts and floods, and a cost-of-living crisis felt both here in the UK and the world over. Over these past 12 months we have been buoyed by our incredible supporters, who have donated to our humanitarian appeals, spoken out about injustice to MPs, joined us in prayer and fundraised in their schools, churches and communities. Thank you to everyone who has stood by us to help those most in need across the world. Here are some moments from 2023. The Turkey and Syria earthquake killed over 50,000 people and left millions without homes. CAFOD joined the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) to [launch a major appeal](/give/donate-to-emergencies/turkey-syria-earthquake-appeal), and once again our supporters showed their enormous generosity. Our local partners were able to provide emergency shelter, food, warm blankets and winter kits. We are still there, supporting affected families. In February [CAFOD staff and partners were thrilled to welcome Pope Francis](/news/international-news/reaching-communities-in-drc) on his long-anticipated visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan. He met people forced to flee their homes to escape violence and prayed for peace and an end to division. In the spring people tied up their laces for our Big Lent Walk which saw thousands of people, including 650 schools, support CAFOD’s work by walking, donating and praying. Next year’s event is due to be even bigger, as we join our sister agency in Scotland, SCIAF, to encourage people to walk 200km over the 40 days of Lent. In the last academic year (2022-2023), Catholic schools in England and Wales raised an amazing £610,000 for CAFOD. Thirty-seven more schools achieved the [LiveSimply Award](/campaign/livesimply-award/livesimply-award-for-schools) – an initiative which sees schools committing to live simply, sustainably and in solidarity with the world’s poorest. [Jenny Garzón Saavedra](/education/laudato-si-for-schools/jenny-in-colombia), youth worker for our church partner FUNVIPAS in the Colombian Amazon, spoke to 8,000 young Catholics at Wembley Arena in March for Flame – the National Youth Congress. Droughts and flooding in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and South Sudan have destroyed farmland, killed livestock and forced millions from their homes. Thanks to our supporters we have helped communities with urgent supplies of food, water, and seeds resilient against climate change, and we will continue to respond for as long as we are needed. Coastal regions that are home to millions of people have already been irreversibly damaged by climate change, including from rising sea levels and salination of water. Following floods in Pakistan, we supported mobile health clinics that travelled hundreds of miles to treat people in need of medical help. Generous donations to our [Harvest Appeal](/give/appeals/harvest-appeal) will allow us to reach even more people affected by the climate crisis in 2024. In October [we delivered ‘Salina’s letter’ to the World Bank’s UK offices](/news/campaigning-news/salina-s-letter-delivered-to-world-bank). Salina is a small-holder farmer from Bangladesh who is fighting to keep control of her own seeds. Part of CAFOD’s ongoing [Fix the Food System](/campaign/fix-the-food-system) campaign, the letter was signed by 18 Catholic Bishops and over 70,000 Catholics from 750 parishes across England and Wales. The [publication of Pope Francis’ Laudate Deum](/pray/laudate-deum-explained) was a rallying cry to phase out fossil fuels and to care for our common home. More than 3,000 CAFOD campaigners joined Pope Francis, writing to MPs, joining climate marches and signing petitions urging Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to stick to the UK’s climate commitments. At COP28, for the first time [international governments pledged to phase down fossil fuels](/news/campaigning-news/cop28-un-climate-talks-end-with-agreement-to-transition-away-from-fossil-fuels) and establish a loss and damage fund to help vulnerable communities adapt to the impacts of climate change. In 2024 we will continue to advocate for a cleaner, more just world. CAFOD is working with our local partners to support those in the hardest-hit frontline areas of the east and south this winter. Their experienced local staff are providing families and individuals in crisis with emergency accommodation, food, water, basic home repairs and medical assistance, alongside mental health support and employment counselling. 2023 will no doubt be remembered for the terrible death and destruction over the last few months in Gaza and Israel, and what can appear to be the end of hopes for peace in the region. But as we join calls for an urgent and permanent ceasefire, we pray that our local partners will soon be able to restart their programmes - from delivering life-saving medical outreach services for vulnerable communities in Gaza, to working tirelessly for peace and a political solution to the crisis. The terrible situation in Gaza is tearing lives apart. Your donation today will help with the practical support to help where possible. A prayer for people suffering due to the conflict in Gaza and Israel. Email David Cameron to call for peace and urge the UK to play its part in upholding international law. The challenges are set to continue into 2024, with the UN predicting increased displacement, conflict and the continued impact of climate change. As people of hope, we take heart in our ability to come together as a faith community to stand in solidarity with vulnerable communities. As we look to the new year ahead we thank everyone again for their continued support and wish you a peaceful festive break.",

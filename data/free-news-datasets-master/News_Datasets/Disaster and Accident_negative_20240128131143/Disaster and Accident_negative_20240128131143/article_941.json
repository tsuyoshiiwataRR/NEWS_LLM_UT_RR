If Keon seen anyone hurting he would literally cry,” Young’s cousin Chanell Williams wrote in a GoFundMe post . “Keon greeted everyone with his big beautiful smile.”\nWilliams called Young’s death “so unfair” and asked people to donate to help the family.\nYoung’s uncle Robert Cook said his nephew enjoyed all the things a 13-year-old should, including superheroes and basketball.\n“He was living his life to the fullest,” Cook said.\nCook lives in Arkansas and traveled to Nevada after Young’s death. He said the holiday season will never be the same for their family.\n“The best way we can remember Keon is by being great,” Cook said.\n said Thursday that no new information was available about the shooting.\nWilliams’ online fundraiser had raised about $1,300 by Thursday afternoon.\nA balloon release is scheduled for 6 p.m. Friday at Desert Horizons Park near Gowan Road and Simmons Street.\nContact David Wilson at dwilson@reviewjournal.com.",

    "text": "The victim of yesterday's deadly shark attack off South Australia's Yorke Peninsula has been identified as 15-year-old Khai Cowley, who is being remembered as a \"talented and dearly loved\" young surfer.\nKey points: A teenage boy was fatally attacked by a shark off the SA coast on Thursday Surfing SA says the victim was a talented young surfer Tributes are being paid to the young victim on social media and within the surfing community The boy, from Maslin Beach in Adelaide's south, died in the attack near Ethel Beach on Thursday afternoon .\nSurfing South Australia said its \"utmost sympathies\" were with the boy's family.\n\"We are devastated to learn that a young, talented and dearly loved member of our surfing community was the surfer involved in the attack at Ethel Beach,\" the group wrote in a statement.\n\"[We] are absolutely shattered to hear the incident was fatal.\n\"We ask you keep [the boy's family] in your thoughts and respect their privacy as they navigate such a heartbreaking time.\"\nA bunch of flowers left in tribute to Khai Cowley. ( ABC News: Brant Cumming )\nIn an Instagram post this morning, Surfing SA said Khai was \"very involved in our surfing community\", and had a \"passion for surfing stemming from a family with deep surfing roots in SA\".\n\"He was a happy, kind and respectful kid, very much loved by his surfing peers and he will be greatly missed out in our community and on the water,\" the post stated.\nA GoFundMe page set up by the boy's aunty to raise funeral costs states that the young surfer \"was suddenly taken from us by a white pointer while surfing\".\nYoung surfer Khai Cowley was fatally attacked by a shark off the South Australian coast. ( Facebook )\nTributes to the teenager have also been posted more widely on social media.\n\"Fly high … some of my most memorable surfs were with you,\" one post read.\nA junior surf club to which Khai Cowley belonged shared a tribute to the young victim.\n\"It is with immense sadness that Microgroms Junior Surf Club remember Khai after his devastating passing,\" it said.\n\"Khai was a member since 2016 and will be remembered as a good friend and talented surfer who was well respected and admired by all that knew him.\"\nA fatal shark attack took place near Ethel Beach on South Australia's Yorke Peninsula on Thursday afternoon. ( ABC News: Brant Cumming )\nMarty Goody, a surfer and resident of Stansbury on Yorke Peninsula, said he understood the teenager was surfing with family at the time of the attack.\n\"It's a very small surfing community on the Yorke Peninsula and everyone knows each other, so I was just checking to see if it was anyone I knew,\" he said.\n\"That's when I found out it was that 15-year-old lad and his dad, so it would have been terrible.\"\nSA Police responded to reports a person had been \"seriously injured\" around 1:30pm, later confirming the body of a teenage boy was recovered from the water.\nAuthorities said Yorke Mid North Police, detectives and crime scene investigators attended the scene and a report is now being prepared for the coroner.\nEthel Beach is located at Dhilba Guuranda-Innes National Park, a location popular with tourists, fishers and surfers.\nMarion Bay Ocean Safari owner Ryan Valente told ABC Radio Adelaide the town was in shock.\n\"It's the stuff nightmares are made of,\" he said.\n\"I've got some friends in the area who've been here since day dot, and talking to them, not even in their memory can they remember anything close to an event like this.\"\nNearby resident and surfer Luke Sykora said the incident was \"tragic\".\n\"I have seen a fair few sharks here over 22 years, but that is the first fatal attack that we've had down here,\" he said.\n\"I wouldn't wish it upon anyone … to even be at the same beach at the same time.\"\nThe attack is the latest of several in South Australia this year.\nA 15-year-old boy killed in a shark attack in South Australia is being remembered as a \"talented and dearly loved\" member of the surfing community. ( ABC News: Brant Cumming )\nDeputy Premier Susan Close described Mr Cowley's death as a \"tragedy\".\nShe said the State Government was not considering introducing shark deterrents, despite the state recording three shark attack fatalities this year.\n\"There are policy interventions that are used interstate, such as attempts to deflect sharks from particular areas whether through nets or through noises,\" she said.\n\"That tends to work if you've got a very intense population area and that's not the case for South Australia.\n\"We've got this long coastline and these attacks have occurred at pretty far-flung places.\"\nThe shark attack at Ethel Beach follows several others in South Australian waters over recent months. ( ABC News: Brant Cumming )\nIn May, 46-year-old surfer Simon Baccanello was fatally attacked at Walkers Rock Beach near Elliston on Eyre Peninsula.\nIn November another surfer, Tod Gendle, was killed further up the west coast near Streaky Bay.\nThe 55-year-old was knocked off his board by a shark while he was paddling into the water near Granites Beach .\nEnvironmental science honours student Bridgette O'Shannessy suffered serious injuries when she was bitten on the head near the jetty at Port Noarlunga.\nIn October, south-east woman Pam Cook was left with leg injuries when she was attacked by a shark while swimming near the jetty at Beachport.\nRodney Fox Shark Museum researcher Andrew Fox said the spate of attacks was \"quite a difference\" to previous years.\n\"These little clusters [of attacks] are more often seen in Western Australia and in the eastern states,\" he said.\nPosted 4h ago 4 hours ago Thu 28 Dec 2023 at 9:43pm , updated 56m ago 56 minutes ago Fri 29 Dec 2023 at 12:50am\nRelated Stories Teen killed in shark attack off coast of Yorke Peninsula in SA 'I fell straight into its mouth': Wing foiler bitten on leg by shark north of Perth relives encounter Me, the sea and the 'Jaws effect'.

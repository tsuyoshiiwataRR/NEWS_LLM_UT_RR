    "text": "Cold weather continues, especially in the northern United States. A major winter storm system will affect areas of the north and center of the country this Wednesday. In view of this, as expected, this leaves serious problems for air and ground transportation. The National Weather Service (NWS) reported today that the system should weaken through the remainder of the week as it moves northeastward across the Central Plains. “This Wednesday the main band of snow is affecting parts of the northern plains to the centre, with light snowfall expected to subside.” “Thursday through Friday morning, a mix of rain and snow will move into the Midwest. It will then remain in the Midwest or even expand slightly as another system from the north will approach with low pressure,” the NWS explained. accidents under snow In Nebraska, the Highway Patrol responded to over a hundred incidents caused by weather conditions, the majority of which resulted in crashes without injuries. Its senior officials spread a message on the topic through the social network X, formerly Twitter. “Slow down, increase your safety distance, wear your seat belt and drive safely if you must be on the road at night. “Winter driving conditions exist across much of Nebraska.” The NWS also reports that freezing rain may occur in parts of northern and eastern South Dakota and southern and eastern North Dakota. The extended forecast indicates snow accumulations could range from 0.25 inches to double that. This will cause damage to trees and power outages. Experts predict that winter conditions will worsen across the country next January. Primarily, the most affected states, as is usually the case every year, will be the states located in the northern part of the country. (TagstoTranslate)alert",

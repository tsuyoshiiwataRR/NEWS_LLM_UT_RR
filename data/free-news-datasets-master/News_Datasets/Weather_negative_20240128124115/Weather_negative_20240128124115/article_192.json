    "text": "KARACHI: The demand for high speed diesel (HSD) fell 11 percent in December from the previous month, as foggy weather disrupted the transport of heavy vehicles across the country, data from the oil sector showed on Thursday.\nThe HSD consumption also declined after the sowing season for Rabi crops, which require more diesel for irrigation, ended in December.\nAccording to the oil consumption statistics of the oil sector provided to The News here on Thursday, the demand for HSD dropped by eleven percent in the country in the month of December compared to November this year.\nThe HSD consumption stood below 400,000 tonnes in the month compared to November when it was around 450,000 tonnes.\nHowever, the demand for HSD was on the higher side in the current month compared to the same month of last year. The oil sector attributed the increase in the consumption of HSD to the cut in its price in the last two successive reviews of prices, which encouraged the consumption of Pakistani diesel compared to Iranian smuggled diesel.\nOn the other hand, the consumption of petrol increased in the current month compared to the month of November this year. The petrol consumption increased by ten percent as the country consumed 425,000 tonnes of petrol in the month compared to 385,000 tonnes in the month of November this year.\nIndustry officials said the consumption of petrol rose because of the substantial reduction in the price of petrol in the last two successive reviews of petrol prices.\n\"The petrol price, which moved up to Rs331 per litre a few months back, has dropped to Rs268 per litre in the last review of the price,\" an offcial said. \"The decreasing price of petrol has increased its consumption in the country.\"\nThe sale of furnace oil has dropped massively by 33 percent in the month of December this fiscal year compared to the previous month, as power plants are not consuming it for power generation after the country witnessed low demand for electricity due to the winter season in the country.\nThe country has presently 453,000 tonnes of petrol stock, which is sufficient for 22 days, whereas there are 509,000 tonnes of HSD in the country, which are sufficient for 27 days. The country has a huge stock of 429,000 tonnes of fuel oil, which according to the oil sector is sufficient for 240 days. .\nBig investors have spent much of 2023 trying to belatedly jump on a stock market rally that few saw coming, or nursing...\nLAHORE: The country faces a deadlock on key national issues such as water management and fiscal federalism, as...\nLondon/Frankfurt/Washington: Central bankers are rethinking their approach to economic forecasting after their...\nKARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan has introduced a new scheme to facilitate exports by allowing the import of input...\nKARACHI: The Pakistan Business Council , an advocacy forum of leading private sector businesses, called for lower...\nISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority has issued separate supplier licences to seven state-run...",

    "text": "A severe\nweather warning has been issued for much of Gloucestershire over the weekend as the weather takes a cold turn. The Met Office has sounded the alarm for strong winds from 11am on Saturday (December 30) to 3am on Sunday (New Year's Eve).\nThe strong winds come in the wake of\nStorm Gerrit which brought chaos to much of the UK. The cold front will move across England and Wales and will also bring some heavy rain, especially in parts of Wales.\nThere could be some disruption to\ntraffic and travel with delays on the roads and railway, as well as potential for air delays and ferry routes in the West Country. Power cuts and public transport delays are also possible during the warning times.\nREAD MORE:\nLive flood warnings in Gloucestershire with UK snow risk amid 2024 cold snap forecast\nREAD MORE:\nBBC weather presenter Carol Kirkwood announces marriage\nThe\nMet Office chief forecaster said: \"An active cold front will move east across England and Wales during Saturday and into Sunday and will be characterised by strong winds and some heavy rain. Gusts of 45-50 mph widely, but squally near the cold front with some gusts around 60 mph, whilst the strongest gusts are likely near coasts in the west and south, with 65-75 mph in places.\"\nThe warning area covers the Forest of Dean, Gloucester, Cheltenham, Stroud and much of the Cotswolds. Newent, Tewkesbury and Stow-on-the-Wold area outside the yellow alert zone.\nThe worst of the rain is forecast to fall from around 6pm on Saturday through to 3am on Sunday. Wind gusts could be up to 42mph on the Saturday evening.\nThe forecast rain comes at a time when parts of the River Severn has been placed under a Flood Warning by the\nEnvironment Agency, meaning flooding is expected, act now. Lesser Flood Alerts are in place on the whole of the River Severn and River Wye.\nA severe weather warning has also been issued for rain in parts of Wales from 10am on Saturday to 6pm on Saturday, with the eastern edge not far from the Gloucestershire border. Heavy rainfall in rain often leads to increased flood risk in Gloucestershire.\nThe Met Office said its Irish counterpart, Met Eireann, could name another storm – Storm Hank – as a “deep area of low pressure” pushes strong winds across the Republic of Ireland on Saturday. Meteorologist Alex Burkill said Saturday is going to turn “wet and windy” across the UK with a band of “intense rain” pushing its way eastwards and north-eastwards to bring a risk of gales and possibly “severe gales” in exposed spots.\nIn a forecast video, Mr Burkill said northern areas as well as high ground areas in Scotland are likely to see “significant snow”, with possibly 10 to 20cm of snow building up on the highest grounds. He said: “There’s a potential for some snow accumulations, even as low as perhaps 100m up, we could see some slushy snow, so likely to see some travel disruption again, because of the wind, the rain and some snow like we’ve seen over some recent days.\"\nWant our best stories with fewer ads and alerts when the biggest news stories drop?

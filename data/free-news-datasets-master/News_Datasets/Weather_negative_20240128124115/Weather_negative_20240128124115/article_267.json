    "text": "Turmeric prices experienced a modest uptick of 0.41%, settling at 14198, driven by concerns of potential yield losses due to unfavourable weather conditions. However, the upside is constrained as buying activities have been sluggish, anticipating stock releases before the onset of new crops in Jan’24. Pressure on prices is also evident from improved crop conditions owing to favourable weather. Support is found in the form of enhanced export opportunities.\nThe location concerns of PM Modi's Turmeric Board in Telangana have sparked worries among Maharashtra farmers, impacting sentiment. The overall crop condition is deemed satisfactory, with the harvest expected from January to March. Current buying levels and decreasing supplies are anticipated to maintain price stability. Despite a 20–25% expected decline in turmeric seeding, exports have increased by 25%, driven by heightened demand in both developed and emerging nations. In Oct 2023, turmeric exports rose by 11.58%, but a 9.30% drop was recorded compared to Oct 2022.\nTechnically, the market reflects fresh buying, with a 0.86% increase in open interest, settling at 12355. The price is up by 58 rupees. Turmeric finds support at 14124, and a breach below this level could lead to a test of 14052. On the upside, resistance is anticipated at 14274, and a breakthrough above this level might propel prices to test 14352.\nAdd Chart to Comment",

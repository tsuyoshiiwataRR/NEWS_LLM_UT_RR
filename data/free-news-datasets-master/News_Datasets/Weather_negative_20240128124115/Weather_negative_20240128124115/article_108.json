This system could bring widespread freezing rain and ice pellets, risking dangerous travel across the region to end the week.\nA second system will swing across the region by Saturday, bringing the possibility of widespread wet snow across the Maritimes.\nAtlantic Canada Friday morning DON’T MISS: New Brunswick's pre-Christmas power outage among the worst in decade\nThe storm arriving in the Maritimes overnight Thursday and into Friday is a complicated mess of wintry precipitation types. Tiny changes in temperature a few hundred metres above the surface will have a huge impact on who sees liquid rain, freezing rain, ice pellets, and snow over the next 36 hours.\nCold air stubbornly hugging the ground will remain in place even as warm, moist air flows in from the south. This warm air will ride up and over the colder air below, creating a perfect setup for freezing rain and ice pellets through Friday.\nAtlantic Canada freezing rain outlook For the better part of this first system, at least, regular rain is the most likely precipitation type close to the coast around Saint John, Halifax, and Yarmouth.\nAs of now, the best potential for a narrow band of freezing rain exists along the Trans-Canada Highway across New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, including the cities of Fredericton and Moncton. A freezing rain warning is in effect for these areas through late Friday morning.\nSome areas could see up to 15 mm of ice accretion by Friday. A glaze of ice on streets, sidewalks, driveways, and stairs will make for dangerous driving and walking conditions for the duration of the storm. Isolated power outages are possible where ice weighs down trees and power lines.\nStory continues Atlantic Canada ice pellet outlook MUST SEE: 2023 ending with mind-boggling warmth in Canada’s frigid Arctic\nA changeover to ice pellets is likely by Friday afternoon across a large swath of northern Nova Scotia, as well as eastern portions of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. Some areas could see ice pellet accumulations on the order of 20-40+ mm.\nIce pellets accumulate like snow, but after a while it can freeze into a slippery, solid sheet of ice that’s exceptionally difficult to remove from streets, sidewalks, and vehicles.\nColder air moving in will force precipitation to change over to wet snow by Friday evening.\nAtlantic Canada snow outlook We’ll have a better chance for widespread snow across the Maritimes come Saturday as another system quickly scoots into the region. The best opportunity for 5-15+ cm of snow looks to focus on eastern New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.\nNewfoundland can expect a mixed bag of wintry precipitation late Friday and into the day Saturday. Colder air here makes it more likely that snow will develop across the Avalon and south coast, but a period of ice pellets is possible to start the event. This will mix with snow accumulation totals on the Avalon.\nBe sure to check back over the coming days as forecasters continue to refine this complex forecast across Atlantic Canada.\nWATCH: Will you see ice or snow?

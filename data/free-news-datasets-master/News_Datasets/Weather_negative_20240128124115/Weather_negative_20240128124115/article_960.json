    "text": "They told us there would be some bomb waves on the west coast this week due to offshore storms, but I didn't realize they were talking this big.\nYes sir, that's like a mini tsunami right there, so those must be some powerful storms out on the Pacific.\nAnother angle:\nMan, that is both scary and awesome at the same time. Citizens of California's beach towns have mostly ignored calls to evacuate, and believe it or not, despite warnings from the National Weather Service, there are surfers out there catching some of these waves. The rip current is incredibly powerful right now, and anyone risking their lives out there for a gnarly wave is either insane or has a death wish (or both).\nAt least 8 people were hospitalized when gigantic waves wreaked havoc across coastal California towns on Thursday, as powerful storms hovered over the Pacific Ocean.\nDaring residents ignored evacuation orders and flocked to the beaches to watch the epic show of the waves crashing, but some were too close as the monstrous waves broke over the seawalls.\nA rogue wave swept approximately 20 beachgoers at Pierpont Beach around 11 a.m. in Ventura.\nA few more shots of the California coast:\nDebris including driftwood and logs were reported to have washed up on shore in the [Ventura] area.\n\"They're washing logs up here. A lot of debris, a lot of driftwood. So we've been asking people to avoid the direct coastal area,\" Keehn added.\nThe Ventura Fire Department said it was working overnight to create artificial beach berms to protect the nearby residential neighborhoods â€¦\nThe entire west coast from Washington down to the US-Mexico border is also under High wave warnings and advisories until 3 a.m. local time Friday with coastal flooding warnings in effect until the afternoon.\nPretty scary stuff out there in California, but it looks like it'll be over shortly.\n ",

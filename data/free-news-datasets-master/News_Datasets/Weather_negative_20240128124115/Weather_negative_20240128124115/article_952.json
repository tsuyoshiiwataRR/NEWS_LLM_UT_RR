LNER suffered disruption on Friday due to \"severe weather\", with strong winds affecting parts of the East Coast Main Line. It meant a service due to run from Aberdeen to London King's Cross started from Newcastle. There has also been widespread disruption to rail services due to staffing shortages. A shortage of train crew at Edinburgh meant CrossCountry cancelled a number of trains to and from the station. Avanti West Coast axed several of it services to and from London Euston due to a staff shortage. Northern, which is also controlled by the Government, said it will run no services on six lines on Sunday - New Year's Eve - due to \"train crew unavailability\". The affected routes with a \"Do Not Travel\" alert connect Manchester Victoria with Chester and Stalybridge, Manchester Piccadilly with Chester via Altrincham, and Preston with Colne. There will also be no trains between Morecambe and Lancaster, or Clitheroe and Bolton. Services on other lines will finish earlier than usual at around 4pm. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"While staffing is a matter for industry, we are working with them to ensure they are able to deliver the services that passengers need, making clear that we will hold them to account if they let passengers down.\"",

    "text": "The US' southern region is poised to experience a frigid start to the new year, as temperatures are expected to dip below freezing in certain areas, coupled with a chance of snow in the forecast. The weather system responsible for unleashing near hurricane-force winds and nearly a foot of snow, causing blizzard conditions in the Plains, is now moving southward and eastward, according to reports.Northern California faces a marginal risk of excessive rainfall from Friday to Saturday morning, heightening the potential for flash flooding in areas susceptible to rapid runoff during heavy rain.Subsequently, the precipitation is anticipated to move from the northwest to Southern California by Saturday, impacting regions such as Los Angeles and San Diego.Snow is expected to impact the Mississippi Ohio Valley and extend into the northern and central Appalachians, as well as the northeastern U.S. during the upcoming New Year's weekend, as reported by the National Weather Service.As the weekend progresses, light snowfall is anticipated in parts of the valleys as a weakening weather system moves towards the Gulf of Maine. The weather service notes that rain will affect the northeast and parts of the Great Lakes.Throughout the weekend, low temperatures are set to drop to freezing levels across much of the area, with daytime highs struggling to reach the 40s and 50s. Even those seeking warmer weather in Florida for the holiday may be disappointed, as Key West and Miami are not expected to surpass 70 degrees on Saturday.In a rare occurrence, some southern cities might experience snowfall. Places like Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee, Huntsville in Alabama, and as far south as Metro Atlanta in Georgia could witness snowflakes falling from Friday night into Saturday.FAQs:Q1. What is rain prediction?A1. The precipitation is anticipated to move from the northwest to Southern California by Saturday, impacting regions such as Los Angeles and San Diego.Q2. Will California witness rainfall?A2. Northern California faces a marginal risk of excessive rainfall from Friday to Saturday morning, heightening the potential for flash flooding in areas susceptible to rapid runoff during heavy rain.",

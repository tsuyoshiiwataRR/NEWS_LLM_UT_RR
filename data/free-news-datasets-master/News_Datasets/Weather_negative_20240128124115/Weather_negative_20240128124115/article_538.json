    "text": "Rain has seen the second T20 between the Black Caps and Bangladesh abandoned after just 11 overs of play. Despite a worrying forecast and gloomy skies, play had begun on time at Mount Maunganui's Bay Oval. Bangladesh won the toss and elected to bowl, looking to build upon their excellent start with the ball in the first T20 on Wednesday. It appeared to be another shrewd decision, as Finn Allen chipped Shoriful Islam straight to cover in the second over to depart for just 2. But after Tim Seifert survived being hit in the helmet by a booming Daryl Mitchell drive that came straight at him at the non-striker's end, the Northern Districts opener found a new lease of life, racing to 43 off 22 before being deceived by a slower ball from Tanzim Hasan Sakib and holing out to mid off. The Bangladesh spinners then turned the screws to stifle Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips, before the players left the field when a shower swept across the ground. New Zealand were 72/2 from the 11 overs, with Mitchell not out on 18 and Phillips unbeaten on 9. While it briefly appeared hopeful that play would resume, the clouds rolled in and dumped unrelenting rain that ruined any chance of a result. Despite the game finishing without a result, Seifert was pleased to get some time in the middle. \"I think we did pretty well and got off to a good start. \"You’re not going to get off to a good start all the time, but it’s always nice to back it up the next game. It was unfortunate to get out at that stage but I wanted to keep putting pressure on them because I think we had them in a good position.\" The teams will return to the same ground on Sunday for the third and final T20 in the series. The Black Caps will need to win in order to draw the series. Bangladesh meanwhile will be hoping to secure their first ever series win on New Zealand shores, something that spinner Rishad Hossain said excited the team. \"It’s a great opportunity and looking forward to it. It’s a great atmosphere playing against New Zealand in New Zealand. It’s not an easy job, I think the boys are doing well and we’re looking forward to the third game.\" Follow the summer of cricket [with TVNZ](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/sport/cricket) this summer.",

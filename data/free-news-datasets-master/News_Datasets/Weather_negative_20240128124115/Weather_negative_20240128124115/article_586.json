    "text": "Brutal winds will hit Sussex this weekend and potentially hamper New Year’s Eve celebrations.\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow wind warning for the entire county from 11am on Saturday (December 30) until 3am on Sunday (December 31).\nPeople are being warned of “strong and gusty winds” which will cause disruption to travel and public services.\nHomes could lose power, coastal communities will be hammered by large waves, and there will be delays for those travelling by road, rail, sea and air.\nIt means there could be disruption for those travelling to New Year's Eve parties in the region.\nREAD MORE: Ashdown Forest Exmoor ponies continue conservation efforts\nIt is just the latest in a recent series of Met Office weather warnings for Sussex after a yellow warning for wind on December 27 saw disruption across the county.\nMeanwhile in Manchester, people were forced to flee their homes after a localised tornado caused significant damage in the region.\nPeople were mainly affected in the Stalybridge area in Tameside where police declared a major incident.\nTraffic Weather Sussex",

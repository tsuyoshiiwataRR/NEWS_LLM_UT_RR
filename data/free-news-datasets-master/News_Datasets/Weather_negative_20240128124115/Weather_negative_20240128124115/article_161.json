    "text": "A dredging project that was set to begin Friday in the Marina del Rey harbor has been delayed until Monday due to inclement weather, county officials said Thursday.\nThe five-month-long dredging effort by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is expected to remove about 400,000 to 500,000 cubic yards of sediment — enough to fill 100 Olympic-sized swimming pools — that has accumulated along the harbor’s north jetty, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors. County officials said shoaling has made navigation difficult in the area for boaters and first-responders.\nThe Army Corps of Engineers will use a vessel knows as Sea Horse in the dredging effort.\nAccording to county officials, as the Sea Horse dredges, the sediment will be loaded onto a dump scow and deposited in the Pacific Ocean near the shore of Dockweiler State Beach — north of Imperial Highway in Playa del Rey.\nThe scow is expected to make four to five trips per day, officials said.\nCounty officials expect that the 24-hour dredging operation will make certain portions of the harbor entrance impassible for periods of time.\nThe Department of Beaches and Harbors will be posting information regarding accessibility to the harbor on social media sites.\nAbout $7.18 million toward the dredging was funded through federal budget appropriations for the project, which aims to ensure safe navigation of the harbor entrance for the U.S. Coast Guard, first-responders and about 4,300 recreational boats docked at Marina del Rey’s harbor.",

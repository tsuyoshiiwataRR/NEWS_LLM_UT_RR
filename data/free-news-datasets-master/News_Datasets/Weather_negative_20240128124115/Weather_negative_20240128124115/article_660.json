    "text": "With Britain now well into storm season, we can often take Met Office warnings for granted as they seem to be issued on an almost-daily basis over winter. But the history of weather alerts and the iconic Shipping Forecast broadcast by BBC Radio 4 each day can be traced back more than 150 years to 1859 in the early days of the forecasting agency - after a devastating storm smashed across the Irish Sea. The 'Royal Charter Gale' struck without warning on October 25 that year, killing 800 people and destroying 133 ships including the vessel that later gave it its name. Wind speeds in the Mersey were the highest ever recorded at the time, and twice as many people were lost at sea around the British Isles than in the whole of 1858. The storm - the most severe to hit the Irish Sea in the 19th century - inspired Met Office founder Captain Robert FitzRoy to start a national storm warning system. The Royal Charter Gale is thought to be the first major example in meteorological history of a sizeable UK storm named after something. Unlike today, storms were not named in advance, but often gained a name due to impacts after the event. While other storms may have been named after vessels that sank and the 'Great Storm' of 1703 had an even bigger impact with up to 15,000 killed, the Royal Charter Gale is thought to have retained notoriety because of Fitzroy's work after the event. Some 133 ships were destroyed in the 'Royal Charter Gale' of October 1859 – the most famous being the steam clipper Royal Charter, which sunk off the coast of Anglesey in North Wales An original charts produced by Met Office founder Robert FitzRoy to depict the Royal Charter Storm. The length of the line indicates wind speed, while red and blue shows pressure and temperature and weather conditions such as rain are shown by markings in small boxes FitzRoy, who had a respected naval background and later became a Vice Admiral, was chosen to set up the Met Office in 1854 amid hopes that better forecasting in the Atlantic Ocean could help protect people at sea. Early meteorologists collected daily weather data at 9am at stations around the British and Irish coasts and sent them to the Met Office by telegraph. These readings including pressure, temperature, wind direction and force, cloud amount and conditions such as rain, thunder or fog. But with forecasting still only in its infancy, five years after the Met Office had begun operations the Royal Charter Gale hit with winds estimated at well over 100mph. The storm tracked northwards over Britain from Cornwall to the Yorkshire coast, but the strongest winds developed as a narrow stream from the north over the Irish Sea. Some 90 ships were badly damaged and 133 were destroyed – the most famous being the steam clipper Royal Charter, which sunk off the coast of Anglesey in North Wales. The vessel, which could carry up to 600 passengers and was well-known for its speed at the time, had been completing a two-month journey from Melbourne to Liverpool. The Royal Charter, which could carry up to 600 passengers and was well-known for its speed at the time, had been completing a two-month journey from Melbourne to Liverpool As conditions deteriorated in the Irish Sea, the captain decided to carry on for Liverpool despite having the option to seek shelter at Holyhead during the storm. But the winds picked up further and the Liverpool Pilot could not reach the ship – meaning they were forced to anchor. However, the port anchor chain then snapped before the starboard chain followed one hour later. Crew cut the masts to reduce wind drag, but the Royal Charter was driven inshore and struck the rocks at Point Alerth before quickly breaking up while being battered by massive waves. An official death toll was never confirmed because the passenger list was lost in the wreck, but it was estimated at 459 including every woman and child on board. Only 40 people survived what remains the deadliest shipwreck ever on the Welsh coast. After the wreck, attention turned to avoiding a repeat – and Fitzroy produced a report to prove how the storm could have been tracked. The Royal Charter Gale inspired Met Office founder Captain Robert FitzRoy (above) - captain of HMS Beagle during Charles Darwin's famous voyage - to start a national storm warning system He claimed that his forecasting models could be used for a national storm warning system – and despite initial scepticism among some scientists that such a prediction service would work, the Government allowed him to set it up. The Met Office began collecting weather reports at its London offices in September 1860 via electric telegraph, and its first storm warning was issued in February 1861. Workers advised ships both in the harbour and along the coast of the incoming storm by using a combination of cones and drums hoisted on a staff. FitzRoy also produced a booklet for ship captains to understand his warning signals, and another explaining how to interpreting changes in a barometer which was used by those operating from smaller ports without the signals. The warning was ignored on the Tyne which wrecked more than 200 ships and resulted in fatalities, but further warnings were then acknowledged and the system soon became popular. FitzRoy produced this guide to help ship captains understand his storm warning signals FitzRoy – who was best known as captain of HMS Beagle during Charles Darwin's famous voyage - tragically killed himself in 1865, with the warning service then halted amid concerns over its scientific basis. However it was restarted in 1867 following a campaign in Parliament and the media. And the system still operates to this day, broadcast as the Shipping Forecast four times a day on Radio 4 at 0.48am, 5.20am, 12.01am and 5.54pm. There is also now the added bonus of storm names, which the Met Office began in 2015 - running annually from September until August the following year. The Met Office brought in the names for storms for when they have the potential to cause disruption or damage which could result in an amber or red warning. They say the idea is to use a 'single authoritative system' to provide a 'consistent message' which helps the communication of approaching severe weather through the media and other government agencies to help keep people said. Forecasters hope that naming severe storms makes people more aware of them, and also helps people follow the progress on TV, radio and in publications. The first daily forecast produced in 1861, which was also the year of the first storm warning A decision was made by the Met Office to start giving storms names in 2014 to mirror the process in the US. The first storm to be named was Abigail on November 10, 2015. Speaking about the importance of the Royal Charter Gale in the history of the Met Office, the organisation's archivist Catherine Ross told MailOnline: 'The Met Office began forecasting following the disastrous Royal Charter Gale of October 1859 which claimed 800 lives in total. 'Following the storm Admiral Robert FitzRoy, founder of the Met Office, applied to Parliament to start a national Gale Warning service. 'This used the telegraph network to transmit information quickly and a system of canvas shapes hung from masts to communicate with shipping in an era well before the birth of radio. 'Over time the gale warnings evolved into the iconic Shipping Forecast. His warnings saved countless lives. 'Today the Met Office continues to help people stay safe and thrive with our National Severe Weather Warnings and also with the naming of storms to aid in communicating severe weather to the public.'",

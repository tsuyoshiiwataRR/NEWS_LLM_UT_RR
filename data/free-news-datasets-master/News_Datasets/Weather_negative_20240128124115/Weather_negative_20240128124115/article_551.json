    "text": "Waves more than nine meters high shook the California coast on Thursday, December 28, the New York Times and several local media outlets reported. Several waterfronts have been flooded and many beaches have been closed: the alert announced by the weather services of the north and center of the state remains in effect until Friday morning.\nA series of storms and powerful winds in the Pacific Ocean are responsible for these waves, explains the New York Times . In a video shared on X (formerly Twitter), young children looking out over the ocean in Santa Cruz find themselves trapped in a wave crashing over passers-by and the road along the coast.\n\"Mavericks\" Another video, broadcast by the American media outlet BNO news, shows the appearance of a powerful wave apparently out of nowhere, under a bright sky: water spreads in the town of Ventura, moving cars while residents run away. Eight people were injured, according to local media.\nÂ«\nThese conditions can be deadly ,\" the National Weather Service warned. The weather service also issued warnings to seasoned surfers who had come to take on the challenge of \" Mavericks \", a famous breaking wave off the coast of the town of Half Moon Bay, south of San Francisco. Some spectators perched on a hill admired the prowess of surfers attracted to the waves, some of which could reach up to 12 meters high, according to Reuters .",

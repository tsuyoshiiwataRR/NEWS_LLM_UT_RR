    "text": "Posted Dec 29, 2023 05:53:14 AM. Last Updated Dec 29, 2023 05:53:18 AM. As Maritimers prepare to welcome in the new year this weekend, they are also dealing with a messy weather day. A freezing rain warning is in effect for Colchester, Cumberland, Pictou and Antigonish counties on the mainland and the western half of Cape Breton. Environment Canada says freezing rain is expected through most of the region early this morning, with the precipitation changing to snow in some areas in the afternoon, mainly over higher terrain. It will also be messy in New Brunswick today, and a snowfall warning has been issued for areas like Moncton and southeast New Brunswick, which should see 15-20 cm of snow after several hours of freezing rain. A freezing rain warning remains in effect for Fredericton and Saint John. A snowfall warning has also been issued for PEI, with Prince and Queens County on the island looking at 15-20 cm of snow today. In HRM, 15-25 mm of rain is expected through the day, with winds gusting as high as 70 km/h",

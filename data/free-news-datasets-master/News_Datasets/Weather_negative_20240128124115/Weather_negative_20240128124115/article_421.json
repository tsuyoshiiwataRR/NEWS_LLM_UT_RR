    "text": "[Weather](https://www.laprensalatina.com/category/weather/) 7 dead in south Thailand flooding Bangkok, Dec 29 (EFE).- Torrential rains have triggered severe flooding in southern Thailand, claiming seven lives and affecting thousands of people, authorities said Friday. The casualties were reported from the Narathiwat province that has borne the brunt, with water levels exceeding two meters in some areas. One person was missing as search operations are on. More than 260,000 people have been affected by the flooding, according to data from the governmentâ€™s disaster management agency. Rescue efforts are underway. The water level exceeded two meters in some villages in Narathiwat, where residents took shelter on rooftops or upper floors of their houses, waiting for help from emergency services. Flood waters have already started receding little by little, while neighboring provinces of Yala and Pattani have also been affected, the public broadcaster Thai PBS reported. The floods forced the closure of some of roads that connect the region and the temporary suspension of the railway services, which has now resumed its normal activity. Some regions in neighboring Malaysia were also hit, and some 28,000 people have been evacuated from their homes, according to official data. Although the water level has begun to recede in some areas, the Thai Meteorological Department predicted that heavy rains would continue over the weekend. EFE nc-ssk",

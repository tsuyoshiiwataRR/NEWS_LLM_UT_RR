    "text": "Le Mars Fire Department battles wintry weather, long delays on new equipment LE MARS, Iowa (KTIV) -Viewers likely remember the dense fog we had around Christmas, which was a real problem for the Le Mars Fire-Rescue Department. With visibility reduced Fire Chief David Schipper said cars were flying past the scenes of accidents, not noticing the fire trucks and ambulances. That put crews in danger, as they worked on accidents caused by the fog and icy conditions. While we’ve all heard of “fire and ice,” the chief says it’s often more difficult to respond to calls in the winter. ”So a lot of times, you know, at a call, once they strip out of that gear to go to rehab or rehabilitate. They can’t get it back on because it’s still frozen solid,” said Schipper. Schipper said we won’t have to worry about frozen fire hydrants, as the water isn’t actually stored in the hydrant where it can freeze, instead, it is stored underground. But he said call volumes generally increase in the winter. “We ramp up the carbon monoxide calls, we ramp up the heating calls because of fireplace issues or space heaters or furnaces that didn’t get checked or cleaned. So the call total seems to go up a little bit this time of year,” he said. Schipper asks the public to slow down on the roads with wintry weather and give an especially wide berth to emergency vehicles this time of year. New firetruck and ambulance The Le Mars Fire Department is also getting a new fire truck and ambulance. Schipper said the Le Mars City Council has approved nearly $2 million for the vehicles, which have to be ordered now with a roughly 40-month lag between placing the order and delivery. The new ladder truck is being paid with sales tax dollars and the ambulance will be funded with money from the American Rescue Plan Act. While Schipper acknowledged the “sticker shock,” he encouraged the city council to break the cost down over 10-20 years, which is how long he expects the vehicles to last. ”So if they sit there and pump water all day long at a fire, you know, it might have not have a lot of miles on it. But they’ve got a lot of hours on the motors and the pumps and things like that,” he said. Schipper said the new ambulance should arrive in 2025 or 2026. The ladder truck may not be delivered until 2027. Copyright 2023 KTIV. All rights reserved.",

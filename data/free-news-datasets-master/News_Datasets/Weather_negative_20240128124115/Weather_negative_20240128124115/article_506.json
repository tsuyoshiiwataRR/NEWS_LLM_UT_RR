    "text": "In a chilling turn of events, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa experienced its coldest day this winter, as temperatures plummeted to a bone-chilling 03 degrees Celsius in Peshawar. The morning humidity stood at a notable 83 percent, creating an icy atmosphere that encapsulated the entire region. The hill station of Kalam claimed the title of the coldest place in the province, with the mercury dropping a staggering 04 degrees Celsius below freezing. The frosty conditions extended their reach, impacting daily life and routine activities. Moderate to dense fog persisted across the plains of the province, causing disruptions in normal vehicular movement. The foggy conditions posed challenges for commuters on both inter and intra-city roads, reducing visibility and slowing down traffic. According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), a continental air mass prevailed over most parts of Pakistan. Forecasts indicate the approach of a shallow westerly wave set to enter the western regions of the country, intensifying the existing cold and dry weather conditions. Experts predict that the harsh weather conditions will persist over the next couple of days. Peshawar and most parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are expected to endure mainly cold and dry weather, while upper districts brace for freezing and cloudy conditions. Chitral and its surroundings may experience light rain/drizzle during the evening/night, adding a touch of precipitation to the prevailing cold. Meanwhile, fog is likely to persist in Mardan, Swabi, Charsadda, Nowshera, Peshawar, and Dera Ismail Khan during morning and night hours, further complicating travel plans.",

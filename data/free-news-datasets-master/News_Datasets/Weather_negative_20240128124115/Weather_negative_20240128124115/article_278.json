    "text": "Fog again disrupts road traffic on motorways in parts of Punjab Pakistan The Motorway Police have advised the drivers to switch on fog lights while driving. LAHORE (Dunya News) - Fog continued to blanket the plains areas of Punjab including Lahore on night between Thursday and Friday, paralysing routine life and disrupting road traffic, Dunya News reported. The thick fog has badly affected the flow of road traffic in several cities. According to a Motorway spokesperson, the Motorway M2 from Lahore to Kot Momin, Lahore-Multan Motorway M3 from Faizpur to Rajana, Motorway M4 from Abdul Hakeem to Faisalabad and Motorway M5 from Shershah to Uch Sharif have been closed for all kind of traffic. The Motorway police have appealed the drivers to use Grand Trunk (GT) Road for travelling. They have also urged the drivers to drive slowly and switch on fog lights. The Motorway police have also requested the people to stay home and avoid unnecessary travelling. Dense fog has also disrupted traffic at several places in the province at the National Highway due to low visibility.",

    "text": "The UK is facing a series of challenges as Storm Gerrit brings strong winds, heavy rain and snow to many parts of the country. The storm, which was named by the Met Office on Tuesday, has disrupted travel plans, caused power outages and triggered a major incident in Scotland. Travel chaos as Storm Gerrit hits during busy holiday period Many people who were planning to return home [after the Christmas holidays](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/weather/topstories/mapped-storm-gerrit-weather-warnings-in-your-area-as-uk-faces-snow-rain-and-strong-winds/ar-AA1m3UEu) have faced difficulties and delays due to the storm. The AA has warned drivers to be prepared for testing conditions on the roads, as the wet weather could increase the braking distance and the high winds could affect the stability of vehicles. The AA also advised drivers to leave a bigger gap to the vehicle in front and to avoid exposed areas where possible. The storm has also affected rail and ferry services across the country. [In Scotland](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/dec/27/uk-weather-christmas-travellers-warned-of-storm-gerrit-hazards), many Caledonian MacBrayne ferries have been disrupted, with widespread delays and cancellations. In England, some train operators have reduced their services or imposed speed restrictions due to the risk of fallen trees and debris on the tracks. At Dover, long queues have built up for the EU frontier operated by French border police, with port authorities warning of two-hour delays. Wintry weather and power cuts in Scotland Scotland has been hit hard by Storm Gerrit, with a yellow warning for snow covering much of the country. The storm has brought wintry hazards, such as icy roads, blizzards and drifting snow, especially across northern Scotland. Ploughs and tractors have been deployed to rescue cars and a jackknifed lorry from the A9 and surrounding roads. The storm has also caused widespread power cuts in Scotland, affecting more than 20,000 homes and businesses. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said it had mobilised more than 400 engineers and support staff to restore power as quickly and safely as possible. The [Scottish government](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/storm-gerrit-weather-uk-wind-rain-snow-forecast-b1129066.html) has declared a major incident and activated its resilience operation to coordinate the response to the storm.

The public are advised to stay alert and follow the latest weather forecasts and warnings on the Met Office website or app. The Met Office has also provided some tips on how to prepare for and cope with storms, such as securing loose objects, checking on vulnerable neighbours and avoiding unnecessary travel. Storm Gerrit is the seventh named storm of the current UK storm season, which started in September and runs until August next year. It is the earliest point in the season that a storm has been named with the letter G since the system for naming storms started in 2015. The weather system comes days after Storm Pia coincided with strike action to bring misery to thousands of people trying to get away for the holidays.

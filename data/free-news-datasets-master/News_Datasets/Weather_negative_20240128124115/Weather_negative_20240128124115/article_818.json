    "text": "Video footage captured a dog battling the surf as it was nearly swept out to sea by the massive waves that have been slamming into the Pacific Coast this week. The pup can be seen on the video, posted by KSBW , struggling to jump through the surf rushing away from the beach before getting knocked sideways and swept away into another breaker where it disappeared under the water for a few moments. In the background, a person calls out: \"Oh, no. Oh, no, no.\" Suddenly the dog's head can be seen above the water as another breaker carries it to shore in a turbulent swell near Santa Cruz, along California's northern coastline Deposited on the beach, the dog begins shaking the water from its fur when another enormous wave crashes in an explosion of white surf. The dog disappears again for several seconds before emerging in the foaming swell that propels it to a roadway about 30 feet away. Swept onto the road, the animal finally makes a bee-line for dry land. The National Weather Service had issued warnings of high surf along the California coast on Thursday that could create waves as high as 40 feet in some areas. “The ocean is NOT your friend today!” the National Weather Service in the Bay Area warned. The massive swells caused by a storm in the Pacific flooded areas, closed roads, and forced evacuations. People were warned to stay away from coastal areas, as well as jetties, piers, and rocks by the water. Other footage captured rogue waves slamming the rocks near where two children were watching the breakers on Thursday, sweeping them into a bush. They were not injured. The high surf warnings were suspended on Friday, but nasty weather is predicted to return on Saturday.",

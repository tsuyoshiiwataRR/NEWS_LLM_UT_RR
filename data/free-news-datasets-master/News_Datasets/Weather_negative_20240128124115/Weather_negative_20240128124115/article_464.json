    "text": "A cut-off low pressure weather system is expected to bring widespread showers and thundershowers that may cause significant rainfall with heavy downpours within a short space of time from Saturday until Sunday in Theewaterskloof. The municipality added that disruptions to essential services could be expected, as well as damage to property, infrastructure, and loss of livelihood and livestock.\n\"The possibility of mudslides and rockfalls may occur especially along slopes and mountainous areas. The general public are cautioned not to attempt to cross any rivers or streams as there is a danger to life due to the strong currents that may prevail,\" Solomons-Johannes added.\nThe national government urged residents to take precautions and follow instructions from their respective disaster management centres.\nMeanwhile, the SAWS said widespread showers and thundershowers could be expected over the western parts of the Free State.\nThe eastern half of the Eastern Cape can expect cloudy and cool to warm conditions, with scattered showers and thundershowers, but isolated along the coast and adjacent interior.\nIsolated afternoon showers and thundershowers can be expected in KwaZulu-Natal.\nActing government spokesperson Nomonde Mnukwa said government was aware of the damages already caused by inclement weather and the responses of first responders in KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and Limpopo.\nREAD MORE | On the frontlines of Ladysmith floods: 'I haven't seen anything like this in 15 years'\n\"The National Disaster Management Centre supports all provincial and municipal disaster management centres to assist the affected communities. We all have the responsibility to assist government and disaster managers to keep us safe,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) appealed to bathers, boaters, paddlers, sailors, anglers and coastal hikers to be cautious around the coastline, saying that the spring tide phase may contribute to stronger than normal rip currents.\n\"Public at beaches and along the coastline will experience the two daily high tides, which will noticeably be higher than normal, and the two daily low tides, which will be lower than normal and stronger than normal rip currents will occur at places around the coastline.\"\n\"Swim at beaches protected by lifeguards. Inland water users are also urged to be cautious. Although not affected by spring tide on inland waters, the increase in water-related emergencies is of concern, and we are appealing to everyone in and around coastal and inland waterways to have safety top of mind,\" the NSRI added.",

    "text": "Scots travellers are set to face even more chaos this weekend with heavy rain and snow forecast. [Storm Gerrit](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/news/scottish-news/major-search-underway-missing-surfer-31764536) brought havoc to the country on Wednesday with roads closed and ferry and train services cancelled. And there is little let up with two [weather](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/weather) warnings in place on Saturday, December 30. Thousands will be hitting the roads this weekend ahead of the New Year while [Celtic](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc) fans will travel from across Scotland to Parkhead for the Old Firm match. The two yellow alerts both start at 8am on Saturday. A warning for rain and snow is in place until 11.59pm for almost all of the country above the Central Belt as well as western parts. Met Office forecasters say an \"active frontal system will extend northeastwards through Saturday bringing heavy rain to low levels and a period of snow across higher ground to some parts of Scotland\". Up to 25 millimetres of rain could fall in some parts and while snow will be largely confined to higher ground, up to three centimetres could fall in north-western parts even at lower levels.

The snow is expected to turn to rain throughout the day which may lead to flooding on already saturated ground. As well as travel delays, the conditions could cause power cuts and some rural communities could even become cut off. The warning covers [Angus](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/angus), Clackmannanshire, [Dundee](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/dundee), Perth and Kinross, Stirling, [Fife,](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/fife) Aberdeenshire, Aberdeen, Moray, [Highland](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/highlands), Western Isles, [ Argyll and Bute](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/argyll-and-bute), East Dunbartonshire, Inverclyde, North Ayrshire, Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire. The second warning lasts until 3pm and covers [Dumfries and Galloway](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-and-galloway), Borders, [East Lothian](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/east-lothian), Midlothian, East Ayrshire, South Ayrshire and [South Lanarkshire](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/south-lanarkshire). The Met Office says: \"A band of rain, with snow on high ground for a time, will extend northeast across southern Scotland on Saturday morning, clearing from the west in the afternoon. \"Rainfall totals of 15 to 25 mm are expected across the warning area in a few hours, and 30 to 40 mm possible over hills, along with 2-5 cm of snow above 250-300 metres.\" Bus and train journey times are expected to be longer while spray on the roads will present a hazard to drivers. Interruption to power supplies and other services is \"likely\" according to forecasters. It comes as teams from Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) Distribution make a final push to get the power supply back on for homes after Storm Gerrit. Around 450 properties remain without power two days after the storm struck. SSEN say these homes are confined to rural parts of Aberdeenshire, Perthshire and The Great Glen. The power supply to around 47,000 homes was cut off by the tempest. For more news, follow us on [here](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/).",

    "text": "Five flights scheduled to arrive at Pune airport and three others scheduled to depart on Friday were cancelled owing to the air-traffic disturbance caused by dense fog engulfing New Delhi. The cancellations are happening due to issues at the [Delhi](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/) airport as a cascading effect on the operations at the other airports. This is the third consecutive day when cancellations have occurred at the [Pune](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/pune/) airport due to low visibility at the Delhi airport amid thick fog cover. On Thursday, [14 departures were cancelled from Pune airport](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/flights-cancelled-airport-fog-delhi-several-others-delayed-9086509/). On Friday, Pune Airport Director Santosh Dhoke said that in the first half of the day (Thursday midnight to Friday noon) a total of eight flights were affected. The delayed flights include Air India’s Pune-Delhi flight (AI1852) which was scheduled to depart at 1.15 am on Friday. Indigo’s Pune-Amritsar flight (6E0721) scheduled to depart at 2.55 am and Pune- [Chandigarh](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/chandigarh/) flight (6E0242) scheduled to depart at 3.40 am were also cancelled.

    "text": "An American Airlines plane bounced along a London runway Wednesday as it battled strong gusts that nearly carried it back into the sky. Heart-pounding video shows the Boeing 777 wobbling from left to right just several hundred feet above the London Heathrow Airport pavement as it attempts to land at 11:45 a.m. following a seemingly confident and effortless descent. The shaky aircraft’s nose then straightens out to level with its body before bouncing straight into the air again, the footage shared by Big Jet TV shows. Somehow, the pilots were able to wrestle the massive aircraft back onto the ground for a safe landing. The 308-seat plane had battled strong crosswinds and heavy fog brought in by Storm Gerrit, a supercell thunderstorm that caused widespread flooding, ripped rooves off houses and killed several people throughout the United Kingdom. Despite flying through the strong winds — which reached 80 mph in some areas — the American Airlines aircraft was only 20 minutes late arriving at Europe’s largest airport, FlightAware data shows. It had made the 6,000-mile and nearly 11-hour trip from California when it was met with the scary turbulence. No injuries associated with the terrifying touchdown were reported. However, Storm Gerrit would later force Heathrow to cancel 18 flights because of air traffic control restrictions on domestic routes. Flights to European cities like Barcelona and Berlin were also affected. The storm also caused widespread disruption to train service several hundred miles north in Scotland, where travel on some lines was suspended until officials could carry out a full inspection of the network. A tree fell and hit the driver’s cabin on one train, but no one was injured. American Airlines did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. With Post Wires",

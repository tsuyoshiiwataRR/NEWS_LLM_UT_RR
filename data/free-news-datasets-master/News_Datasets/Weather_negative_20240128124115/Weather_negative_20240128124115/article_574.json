    "text": "news\nPublished on Dec 29, 2023, 12:46am ET\nAn American Airlines plane bounced off a London runway on Wednesday amid strong gusts of wind, nearly sending it flying back into the sky.\nHeartbreaking video shows the Boeing 777 wobbling left to right several hundreds of feet above the pavement at London Heathrow Airport as it attempts to land after taking off with confidence and ease at 11:45 am.\nFootage shared by Big Jet TV shows the unstable plane's nose straightening up to its body before plunging straight into the air again.\nSomehow, the pilots managed to bring the huge plane back to the ground for a safe landing.\nThe 308-seat aircraft encountered high winds and dense fog caused by Storm Gerrit, a supercell storm that caused widespread flooding, blown off roofs, and multiple deaths across the United Kingdom .\nDespite flying amid strong winds – which reached 80 mph in some areas – the American Airlines plane was only 20 minutes late arriving at Europe's largest airport, FlightAware data shows.\nIt had traveled 6,000 miles and about 11 hours from California when it encountered scary turbulence.\nWhen the American airline's Boeing 777 reached London's Heathrow Airport for the last time on December 26, it started wobbling in the air. Big Jet TV/Youtube The 308-seat plane was battling strong winds and dense fog caused by Hurricane Gerrit. United Kingdom. Big Jet TV/Youtube\nNo injuries associated with the fateful touchdown were reported.\nHowever, air traffic control restrictions on domestic routes following Storm Gerrit forced Heathrow to cancel 18 flights. Flights to European cities like Barcelona and Berlin were also affected.\nThe storm caused widespread disruption to train services several hundred miles north in Scotland, where travel on some lines was suspended until authorities could carry out a full inspection of the network. A tree fell on a train and hit the driver's cabin, but no one was injured.\nThe aircraft tilted shortly before its tires made contact with the ground. Big Jet TV/YouTube Somehow, the pilots were able to get the huge plane back on the ground for a safe landing. Big Jet TV/Youtube\nAmerican Airlines did not immediately respond to The Post's request for comment.\nwith post wire\nload more…\n{{#isDisplay}\nCopy URL to share\nSource: nypost.com",

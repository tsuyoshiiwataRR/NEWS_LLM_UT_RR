    "text": "Parts of Queensland have been smashed by multiple extreme weather events and will take time to recover, a federal minister has warned.\nThe state was hit by flooding, tornado-like winds and rain that claimed the lives of seven people in the days after Christmas.\nTens of thousands of homes around the Gold Coast are entering a fourth day without power with heatwave conditions forecast on Friday.\nFederal Emergency Management Minister Murray Watt said some suburbs’ power networks have been “completely smashed”.\nSome suburbs’ power networks have been “completely smashed”, federal minister Murray Watt said. (JASON O’BRIEN/AAP PHOTOS)\n“The scale of the damage that we’ve seen across a pretty big part of southeast Queensland is very large and therefore is going to take some time to work through,” Senator Watt said.\nHe said emergency services had been stretched by flooding in Cairns and far north Queensland followed immediately by storms in the southeast.\n“When you’re dealing with disasters from one end of the state to the other, literally, that is a real test for people and there’s an incredible work being put in,” Senator Watt said.\nPort Douglas residents and businesses were told to stop using water immediately on Friday after a landslide halted operations at a treatment plant.\nDouglas Shire chief executive Scott Mason said the council was working around the clock to alleviate the issue as quickly as possible.\nFederal Nationals leader David Littleproud warned that Australia was only just at the start of the disaster season.\n“We’ve got a lot of recovery to do in fixing a lot of roads, a lot of infrastructure and helping farmers out who have lost a lot of produce,” he said.\n“If they haven’t provided the right warnings with the right information at the right time, then questions should be asked,” Mr Littleproud said.\nTemperatures are expected to soar across most of northern Australia over the coming days.\nParts of Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia face extreme to severe heatwave conditions from Friday, the Bureau of Meteorology says.\nOn Friday in the Northern Territory, it’s predicted to reach 40C in Katherine and 43C in Tennant Creek.\nMarble Bar in WA’s Pilbara region may reach 49C on Saturday, and temperatures up to 45C are expected there for the next six days.\nWinton in Queensland’s west is expecting 43C, while temperatures up to 37C are forecast for Gympie in the state’s storm-ravaged southeast.\nHighs up to 36C are predicted in Brisbane on Friday, while Longreach in the state’s west is forecast to get to 47C over the weekend.\nMore than 42,000 people remained without power across southeast Queensland on Thursday as the state recorded higher than average temperatures.\n“In the Northern Territory, low to severe-intensity heatwave conditions cover most areas,” the bureau said in a statement.\n“Locally, extreme heatwave levels are forecast around Darwin where warm minimums are leading to uncomfortable nights.\n“In Queensland, low to locally severe heatwave conditions are building along the east coast, including Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and areas surrounding Cairns.”\nForecasters say people in the worst impacted areas should stay indoors, close windows and blinds to keep heat out of homes and seek out fans or air-conditioners to keep cool.",

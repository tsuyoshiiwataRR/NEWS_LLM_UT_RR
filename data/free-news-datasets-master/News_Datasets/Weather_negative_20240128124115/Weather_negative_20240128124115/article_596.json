    "text": "A YELLOW [weather](http://www.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/weather/) warning for strong winds has been issued by the Met Office, with the entirety of Somerset and Devon set to be affected. The warning will come into effect from 11am on Saturday, December 30 and end at 3am on Sunday, December 31. The [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/uk-warnings#?date=2023-12-31&id=93aafe71-7b22-4a62-b51b-557ecbe093fb) warning reads: \"A spell of strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services. \"Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely. \"Itâ€™s likely that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and/or large waves. \"Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer. \"Some short term loss of power and other services is possible. \"Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely.\" The Met Office's five tips for staying safe in strong wind. - Check for loose items outside your home and plan how you could secure them in high winds. - Plan your route before driving, and keep essentials such as a blanket and food in your car. - Try to avoid driving where possible. If you must drive, keep to a slow speed and ensure to leave extra space to cyclists, motorcyclists, buses, and lorries. - If you live on the coast, check forecasts and tides in your local area, and beware of large waves. - Stay indoors as much as possible. Avoid walking near buildings and trees if outside due to possible debris.

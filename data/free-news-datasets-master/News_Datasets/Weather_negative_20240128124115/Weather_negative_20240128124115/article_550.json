    "text": "New Year‚Äôs Eve revellers have been urged to wrap up warm as conditions across many parts of the UK could feel close to freezing as the clock strikes midnight.\nThe weather is expected to remain unsettled with further strong winds and heavy rain throughout the last weekend of 2023.\nA yellow weather warning for wind covering parts of Wales and the east of England has been issued and will come into force between 11am on Saturday and 3am on Sunday.\nFind out what the last few days of 2023 including New Year's Eve have in store with @WeatherAlex üëá pic.twitter.com/p0mDBx1i56\n‚Äî Met Office (@metoffice) December 28, 2023\nA spell of strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services, the Met Office said.\nA yellow weather warning for rain has been issued covering Wales between 10am and 6pm on Saturday, which may lead to flooding and transport disruption.\nA yellow weather warning for rain will also come into effect at 4am on Saturday for Northern Ireland, due to be in force until 11am the same day.\nThe fresh warnings come on the heels of a gusty few days brought on by Storm Gerrit.\nHundreds of homes in Scotland remain without power as the post-storm clean up begins, but electricity bosses are ‚Äúvery confident‚Äù that the remaining 750 properties will be reconnected on Friday.\nThousands of properties in Ceredigion were without power on Thursday after lightning struck supplies in Wales.\nScreengrab taken from PA Video of a damaged gate in Stalybridge after the Tameside tornado (Richard McCarthy/PA) The Met Office said its Irish counterpart, Met Eireann, could name another storm ‚Äì Storm Hank ‚Äì as a ‚Äúdeep area of low pressure‚Äù pushes strong winds across the Republic of Ireland on Saturday.\nMeteorologist Alex Burkill said Saturday is going to turn ‚Äúwet and windy‚Äù across the UK with a band of ‚Äúintense rain‚Äù pushing its way eastwards and north-eastwards to bring a risk of gales and possibly ‚Äúsevere gales‚Äù in exposed spots.\nIn a forecast video, Mr Burkill said northern areas as well as high ground areas in Scotland are likely to see ‚Äúsignificant snow‚Äù, with possibly 10 to 20cm of snow building up on the highest grounds.\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a potential for some snow accumulations, even as low as perhaps 100m up, we could see some slushy snow, so likely to see some travel disruption again, because of the wind, the rain and some snow like we‚Äôve seen over some recent days,‚Äù he said.\nBlustery and showery conditions are set to continue into Sunday, with the heaviest and most frequent rainfall across western parts of the UK.\nThe mercury is expected to drop on Sunday.\nMr Burkill said: ‚ÄúAs we look towards the end of the day on New Year‚Äôs Eve, and the blustery showery theme does continue, some of those showers should start to ease as we head towards midnight.\n‚ÄúSo perhaps a bit more drier weather around, some clearer skies but do watch out for those showers and you will also want to wrap up quite warm because although it hasn‚Äôt been particularly chilly recently, when you factor in those strong blustery winds, it‚Äôs going to feel close to freezing for many places.\n‚ÄúSo definitely a chilly feel to things as the clock strikes midnight.‚Äù\nNew Year‚Äôs Day should turn drier for many, particularly across more central southern parts of England and across Scotland with the ‚Äúcentral slice‚Äù of the UK most likely to have showery rain.\n‚ÄúAs we look through the rest of the first week of 2024 and at the moment Tuesday looks like it‚Äôd be a largely dry day with some fine weather around before the return to something more unsettled ‚Äì some heavy rain, some strong winds, and that does bring the potential for something a little bit colder and possibly wintry,‚Äù Mr Burkill said.\nThree men died after their 4√ó4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said.\n(PA Graphics) A ‚Äúsupercell thunderstorm‚Äù that moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged around 100 homes in Stalybridge, in Tameside, Greater Manchester, on Wednesday.\nDamage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said.\nScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspended or cancelled services due to damage or system faults.\nFriday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day.\nIn Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday.",

ITV Published: 29/12/2023- 14:22 Richard Madeley sparked fresh outrage today as he discussed the aftermath of Storm Gerrit on northern England. The ITV host asked one of his reporters whether how the clean up operation was after Storm Gerrit saw a tornado tear off the roof of homes in Greater Manchester. Thousands of homes were affected in the storm and hundreds are still without power in the wake of the storm. Madeley told viewers: \"About 100 homes were damaged and a major incident was declared by the police. He said: \"Katy Rickitt is in Stalybridge for us. Well, how are they managing up there now Katy? \"It's been a day or so now, are they getting over it?\" Rickitt replied: \"Well I think there's going to be quite a lot of work to be done to get over this one.\" Viewers rushed to X formally Twitter to voice their concerns over Madeley's lack of tact. One wrote: \"Still gobsmacked at Madeley's 'They'll get over it' remark about the people whose homes were wrecked by the tornadoes in Manchester #GMB.\" Another said: \"\"Yeah @richardm56, they'll get over it after all it’s only a roof thorn off U utter p**** #gmb.\" His comments come as New Year’s Eve revellers have been urged to wrap up warm as conditions across many parts of the UK could feel close to freezing as the clock strikes midnight. The weather is expected to remain unsettled with further strong winds and heavy rain throughout the last weekend of 2023. A yellow weather warning for wind covering parts of Wales and the east of England has been issued and will come into force between 11am on Saturday and 3am on Sunday. A spell of strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services, the Met Office said. A yellow weather warning for rain has been issued covering Wales between 10am and 6pm on Saturday, which may lead to flooding and transport disruption. A yellow weather warning for rain will also come into effect at 4am on Saturday for Northern Ireland, due to be in force until 11am the same day. The fresh warnings come on the heels of a gusty few days brought on by Storm Gerrit. Hundreds of homes in Scotland remain without power as the post-storm clean up begins, but electricity bosses are “very confident” that the remaining 750 properties will be reconnected on Friday. Thousands of properties in Ceredigion were without power on Thursday after lightning struck supplies in Wales.",

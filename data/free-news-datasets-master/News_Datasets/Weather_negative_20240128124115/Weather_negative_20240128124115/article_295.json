Photograph: ANI on X Airlines have requested passengers to keep a check on the status of flights on airline websites before leaving for the airport.\nPassengers who arrived at the airport but were not aware of the delays were seen sitting on the floors and waiting for an update from the airline.\n \"I have been waiting for 12 hours at T-3 in the cold to catch a flight to Sharjah. The airline made no arrangements for passengers in case of delay in such weather,\" said Fakrool, a native of Rampur in Uttar Pradesh.\nAccording to airport sources, visibility on Friday fell to 150 meters, which is considered moderate for flight operations.\n\"No diversions have been reported till 8 am on Friday.

    "text": "On a global scale, 2023 has officially been the hottest year on record.\nAlthough records only go back 170 years, meteorologists have been able to use simulations to determine that 2023 has been the warmest of the last 125,000 years.\nÂ© Jeannot Ries\nFerrone warns that Luxembourgers will have to prepare for more heat and rain combinations in the future, as the phenomenon is increasing around the globe.\n\"The warmer the atmosphere, the more moisture it can absorb, which potentially leads to more precipitation. This is particularly evident in heavier or extreme rainfall. In Luxembourg, and across the world, we can see that this phenomenon is on the rise. In terms of the long-term trends for rain, here in Luxembourg, statistically speaking, it does not appear to change too much over the years.\"\nHowever, weather services have observed that the winters are becoming wetter, while spring is marked by drier conditions. Currently, we are experiencing what is known as an El Nino year, Ferrone explains.\n\"It is expected that 2024 will also be an extremely warm year. In Luxembourg, it's not so easy to offer a clear forecast, as long-term predictions are a little trickier. We also can't precisely predict the amount of rainfall. But we do have to bear in mind that the current tendencies are likely to continue, at least for the next 30 years or so.\"\nGlobally, however, temperatures are expected to continue rising, with more drought predicted, but also more extreme weather occurrences, such as extremely heavy rainfall.\nVideo report in Luxembourgish:",

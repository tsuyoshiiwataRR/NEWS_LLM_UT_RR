    "text": "It caused havoc for aviation, with flights being cancelled across the countries.\nAir traffic restrictions saw major delays at Heathrow, with flight cancellations across the UK, including Manchester and Glasgow.\nThe UK's flag carrier British Airways cancelled 13 flights because of the weather. In Ireland, Dublin Airport remained unscathed, though Cork saw four diversions, to Dublin and Shannon.\nPlanes that managed to take off faced an equally difficult fate: trying to land in the storm.\nOne American Airlines flight was caught on camera during a particularly bumpy landing at Heathrow on December 27.\nThe Boeing 777, coming in from Los Angeles, was seen wobbling from side to side as it came down, toppling briefly towards the left, before appearing to bounce or \"bunny hop\" on the runway before sticking to terra firma and slowing down.\nThe \"insane\" landing was filmed by Big Jet TV owner Jerry Dyer, who regularly sets up livestreams at airports around the world to watch flights coming in, and has a particular soft spot for stormy weather.\nDyer told CNN in 2022 that he's drawn to the \"battle\" between man and nature during a storm at an airport.\n\"Whenever there's windy conditions, stormy conditions, I'm always up at Heathrow,\" he said at the time.\nThe most nerve-jangling airports for pilots in the world\n\"It's a lot more exciting to watch than aircraft just landing down and touching down and all that kind of stuff. It's the battle, isn't it? It's the forces of nature against an alloy tub with wings on it that we built and we have to control it down onto the ground in Mother Nature's winds.\n\"It's a fantastic thing to watch.\"\nHis\nlivestream of Storm Eunicein 2022, in which planes battled to land at Heathrow despite 122 mile-per-hour winds battering the UK, captivated the entire country.\nThere were more than 200 severe wind gust reports across Britain and Ireland on Wednesday, with a possible tornado sighting in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester.\nA level two of three threat for a severe storm remained for far south-eastern Ireland and west-central UK until early Thursday morning, according to the European Storm Forecast Experiment.\nStreaming the AA flight, Dyer's famously enthusiastic commentary noted the air \"vortex\" around the wings as it came in, before lamenting \"oh stop it, stop that\" as the plane bounced down the runway.\n\"How he did not go around I just have no idea,\" he commented.\nDespite the conditions, flight AA134, which had departed LA on December 26, touched down just one minute late â€“ at 11.41am on December 27, according to flight tracker FlightRadar.\nIt then took off again about two hours later, making its way to Dallas, where it landed early. Luckily with a different crew.",

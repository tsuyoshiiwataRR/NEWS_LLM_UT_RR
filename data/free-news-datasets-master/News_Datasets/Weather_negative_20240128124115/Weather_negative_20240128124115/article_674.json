    "text": "A thick blanket of fog has enveloped the northern plains of India, causing a significant drop in day temperatures, and raising concerns about cold day conditions in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, and parts of Uttar Pradesh. This persistent fog, initially concentrated over Pakistan's Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, North Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, has now spread to parts of Jharkhand and Bihar as well. While minimum temperatures have risen slightly in the past two days, the plummeting day temperatures have brought a noticeable chill to the region. Cold day conditions, characterized by a minimum temperature of 10 degrees Celsius or less and a maximum temperature departure from normal of -4.5°C to -6.4°C, are likely at many places. If the maximum temperature falls even further, below -5.5°C, it would be classified as a severe cold day. The dense fog, which disrupts visibility and transportation, is expected to persist for at least the next three days, although its intensity may decrease. This extended period of foggy conditions could exacerbate the cold day situation, leading to further discomfort and potential health concerns. People in the affected areas are advised to take precautions against the cold weather by wearing warm clothing, avoiding prolonged exposure to the fog, and staying updated on weather advisories. The elderly, children and those with respiratory illnesses are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cold weather and should take extra care during this period. It is important to note that Skymet is closely monitoring the situation and issuing regular updates. Following their guidance and taking necessary precautions will help residents of the northern plains navigate this foggy and chilly spell safely and comfortably. Image Credit: livemint",

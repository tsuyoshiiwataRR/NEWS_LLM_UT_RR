    "text": "Richard Madeley asks if tornado victims have 'got over it'\n[Richard Madeley](/latest/richard-madeley) sparked a divided response from [Good Morning Britain](/latest/good-morning-britain) viewers on Friday after he asked if the Manchester tornado victims had \"got over it\". It comes after the residents of Stalybridge in Greater Manchester continued a clean-up operation after Storm Gerrit saw a tornado tear off roofs.\nThousands of homes also went a second night without power in the wake of the storm. Introducing the update, Richard told\n[ITV](/latest/itv) viewers: \"About 100 homes were damaged and a major incident was declared by the police.\n\"Katy Rickitt is in Stalybridge for us. Well, how are they managing up there now Katy?\n\"It's been a day or so now, are they getting over it?\"\n\"Well I think there's going to be quite a lot of work to be done to get over this one,\" Katy responded.\nThe presenter continued: \"As you say - a tornado, you never expect it in the UK.\n\"It's the sort of thing you hear about in America but this hit here in Stalybridge.\n\"About 100 houses, a very localised area. You can see the houses behind me, all ready for Christmas, the trees are up.\nDon't miss...\n[ Ranvir Singh in backstage struggle as she returns to GMB with Richard Madeley ](/celebrity-news/1849407/ranvir-singh-good-morning-britain-struggles-itv-richard-madeley) [VIDEO]\n[ Kate Garraway supported by fans as poignant song airs after Derek's heart attack ](/showbiz/tv-radio/1848956/kate-garraway-derek-draper-britain-get-singing-gmb) [LATEST]\n[ Kate Garraway flooded with support as she misses Good Morning Britain for Derek ](/showbiz/tv-radio/1848418/Kate-Garraway-miss-Good-Morning-Britain-Derek-Draper-hospital) [LATEST]\n- Support fearless journalism\n- Read The Daily Express online, advert free\n- Get super-fast page loading\n\"And then look, this tornado came in and ripped the roofs clean off.\"\nTaking to X, some viewers complained about Richard's question.\n@Roy_the_boyo fumed: \"Madeley /partridge comment about hurricane victims 'they will get over it' what a k***head #gmb.\"\n@allen_rob penned: \"Richard Madeley is an absolute wage stealer and a clown.

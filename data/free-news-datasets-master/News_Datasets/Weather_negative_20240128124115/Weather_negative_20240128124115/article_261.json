Three men died after their 4√ó4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said.\nA supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday.\nAround 100 properties were damaged by what police called a ‚Äúlocalised tornado‚Äù in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook.\nHayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours‚Äô houses ‚Äúare an absolute disaster‚Äù with missing roofs and ‚Äúsquished‚Äù cars.\nDamage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said.\nScreengrab taken from PA Video of a damaged gate in Stalybridge after the Tameside tornado (Richard McCarthy/PA) ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults.\nFriday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day.\nIn Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday.\nüå¶Ô∏è Blustery showers are possible on Friday morning, with these most likely in the north and west. Many of us will also see some sunshine and some places may stay dry.\nüå¨Ô∏è Still windy in northern England and later Shetland, with gales possible, but otherwise somewhat less windy. pic.twitter.com/hInP8LNF2c\n‚Äî Met Office (@metoffice) December 28, 2023\nFerry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel.\nAir travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal.\nThe Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground.\nMet Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: ‚ÄúHeavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.‚Äù",

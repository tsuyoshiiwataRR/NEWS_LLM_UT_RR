    "text": "A large slice of the capital will be facing severe winds this weekend (Saturday December 30 and Sunday December 31) according to new weather warnings from the Met Office.\nThe meteorologists have issued maps showing whereabouts in the country people should be wary of the foul weather. On both days, most of South and part of North East London are set to be hounded by seriously strong gusts.\nThankfully, London avoids the worst of the rain and snow, which is limited to coastal areas, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nREAD MORE: January London weather map shows bleakest possible start to 2024\nSaturday will see the winds arrive in force across much of London The yellow wind warning stretches across Kent, up the coast into East Anglia, and west across much of Wales and England&apos;s southern coast.\nThe Met Office also warns that the winds may be more than an inconvenience, as disruption to travel is possible. The forecast predicts that bus and train services could be affected, while &apos;short term loss of power&apos; isn&apos;t unthinkable.\nNew Year&apos;s Eve won&apos;t be much better If you&apos;re travelling back from coastal areas after Christmas, spray and large waves are likely as well as the wind.\nThankfully, there are no weather warnings over London for New Year&apos;s Day, just a lot of rain.\nIn fact, BBC Weather forecasts a straight week of rain, with every day between January 1 and January 8 being wet and grey. Maps from WXCharts show that London will be getting the bleakest start possible to 2024 with rain clouds overhead for two days.\nGet the biggest stories from around London straight to your inbox.

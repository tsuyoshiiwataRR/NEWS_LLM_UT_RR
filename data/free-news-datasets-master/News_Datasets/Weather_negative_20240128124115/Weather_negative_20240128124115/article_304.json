    "text": "By Dr Mukesh Batra\nWinter can be a challenging time for individuals living with arthritis, as the cold weather tends to exacerbate joint pain and stiffness. Recent reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) reveal that osteoarthritis predominantly affects individuals aged 55 and above, with 73 per cent falling into this age group, and 60 per cent of those affected being female. The data further indicates that the knee is the most commonly impacted joint, followed by the hip and hand, leading to a prevalence of 365 million arthritis patients. Given the ageing populations, rising obesity rates, and increased instances of injury, the global prevalence of osteoarthritis is anticipated to persistently rise.\nOsteoarthritis can arise from various factors, including a history of joint injury or overuse, older age, and excess weight, with a higher prevalence observed among women compared to men.\nPrioritise regular exercise to sustain joint health Engaging in indoor workouts, such as yoga or gentle stretching exercises, maintains flexibility and supports heart health. Regular physical activity can contribute to a substantial 40 per cent reduction in pain and notable improvement in function for adults dealing with arthritis.\nWeight management matters: A key to pain reduction The holiday season often brings indulgence, and the colder weather may discourage outdoor activities, potentially leading to unwanted weight gain. Managing a healthy weight is paramount, as even a slight increase can intensify joint pressure, worsening pain. Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight enables adults to ease arthritis pain and enhance overall function. As per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, weight loss emerges as an effective, non-drug method to manage arthritis and joint pain.\nHeat therapy for aching joint Embracing the healing power of heat proves to be an effective strategy for combating aching joints during winter. Electric heating pads or hot water bags can provide targeted relief, while warm water soaks or hot baths effectively alleviate joint aches and induce muscle relaxation. Studies by the Arthritis Foundation indicate that heat treatments can effectively alleviate muscle discomfort and promote increased flexibility in stiff joints.\nEnsure adequate vitamin D intake for joint health Vitamin D plays a crucial role in joint health, and during winter, when sunlight exposure is limited, it becomes even more essential. Lack of this fat-soluble nutrient can contribute to muscle and joint pain, as well as increase the risk of osteoporosis. Boosting Vitamin D levels by spending time outdoors when possible and incorporating Vitamin D-rich foods like oily fish, egg yolks, orange juice, cereals, and oatmeal into the diet becomes crucial during the winter months.\nHomoeopathy for arthritis As a complementary medical system, homoeopathy offers holistic treatments that are safe and without any side effects. Homoeopathy works by modulating the body's immunity, which helps to reduce joint inflammation. Furthermore, it helps to slow the progression of the condition. These therapies work well to relieve pain, edema, and joint stiffness. Prioritise your safety and well-being by seeking appropriate medical assistance and following the advice of a certified homoeopath.\n(The author is a Padmashree recipient, and the founder and chairman of Dr Batraâ€™s Healthcare).\n[Disclaimer: The opinions, beliefs, and views expressed by the various authors and forum participants on this website are personal and do not reflect the opinions, beliefs, and views of ABP News Network Pvt Ltd].\nCheck out below Health Tools-\nCalculate Your Body Mass Index ( BMI )\nCalculate The Age Through Age Calculator",

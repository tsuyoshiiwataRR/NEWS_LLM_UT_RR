    "text": "Waterford is bracing itself for power outages, hazardous travelling conditions and localised flooding as a Status Yellow thunderstorm warning has moved into place for the whole of Munster, Connacht and Donegal.\nThe warning will remain in place until 9pm Thursday evening and will bring with it scattered thunderstorms with lightning activity and the possibility of hail.\nMet Éireann has warned it could lead to power outages, dangerous travelling conditions and localised flooding in the impacted areas.\nWaterford City and County Council started their clean up operation this morning following on from Storm Gerrit and the Orange weather warning that was in place across the county yesterday.\nGabriel Hayes, Senior Engineer with Waterford City and County Council explained that the combination of the recent orange weather warning in Waterford, and this current yellow thunderstorm warning for Munster could lead to dangerous driving conditions in the region\n“Our ground crews are attending to a number of fallen trees and roads blocked as a result of yesterday’s Status Orange weather event.\n“While the worst of the weather has passed, the current thunderstorm warning is expected to bring some scattered thunderstorms and spells of rain, which could lead to localised and spot flooding. These conditions combined with fallen branches and debris on the roads will make travel hazardous.\n“We would also advise motorists to avoid driving through floods. If a road is flooded, do not attempt to drive through it and choose an alternative route, as flood waters can be deeper than they appear. Pavement and road surfaces may also be damaged beneath the flood waters.”\nMotorists are also reminded to be conscious of vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists when driving during bad weather.\nWaterford City and County Council’s severe weather management team is monitoring the situation and Council ground crews are on stand-by to deal with any issues that may arise, such as localised flooding, blocked drains, and gulley overflows.\nMembers of the public can contact Waterford City and County Council’s Customer Services Desks on 0818 10 20 20 during normal office hours, after which calls will be transferred to the Council’s emergency services number.\nWaterford City and County Council has advised the public to:\nStay away from all coastal areas for the duration of the Met Éireann warnings. All road users should be aware of the hazardous travelling conditions, and allow extra time for journeys. The public are warned electricity wires are always live, never approach. If you see fallen or damaged wires, keep clear and phone ESB Networks immediately on 1800 372 999 A Status Yellow wind and rain warning is also in place in Clare, Kerry, Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, and Sligo until 6am, Friday December 29.\nAn additional Status Yellow rainfall warning will also come into place at 6am Friday December 29 for Donegal, Leitrim, North Mayo and Sligo. This warning will then end at 9pm on that evening.\nGet ahead of the day with the morning headlines at 7.30am and Fionnán Sheahan’s exclusive take on the day’s news every afternoon, with our free daily newsletter.",

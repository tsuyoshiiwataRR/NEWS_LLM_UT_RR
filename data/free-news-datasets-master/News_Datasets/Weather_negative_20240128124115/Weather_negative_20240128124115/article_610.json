    "text": "Powerful waves surged onto the West Coast and Hawaii's shores as a robust swell originating from the Pacific Ocean made its way, prompting warnings and causing localized flooding.The National Weather Service cautioned against venturing onto rocks and jetties due to the risk of sneaker waves, larger and unpredictable surges that can wash over beaches unexpectedly. A high surf warning spanning parts of Northern California predicted waves reaching 28 to 33 feet and peaking at 40 feet in specific locations. Reports of flooding in low-lying coastal areas accompanied these alerts.In Aptos, located at the northern end of Monterey Bay, the overwhelming surf breached the beach, flooding a nearby parking lot and leaving debris scattered. Santa Cruz County issued evacuation advisories for several coastal regions as a precautionary measure.Residents, like Eve Krammer, expressed concern about the formidable waves, describing them as gnarly and indicative of Mother Nature's fury. Jeff Howard, another local resident, empathized with those residing in vulnerable areas, recalling similar oceanic battering from the previous January's onslaught of atmospheric rivers.Southern California witnessed hazardous waves, albeit slightly less colossal, accompanied by life-threatening rip currents. Despite the risks, surfers, such as Alex Buford, exercised patience, acknowledging the challenges in navigating the waves. Buford's persistence paid off with a satisfying, lengthy ride.Meanwhile, Hawaii braced for surf heights ranging from 30 to 40 feet along north-facing shores and 18 to 22 feet along west-facing shores across five islands. Professional surfer Sheldon Paishon, gearing up for a session at Makaha, highlighted the consistent big waves characteristic of Hawaii's winter season.Offering advice to inexperienced surfers, Paishon emphasized consulting lifeguards and ensuring safety protocols were in place, echoing the sentiment shared by Honolulu Ocean Safety lifeguards. These lifeguards rescued 20 individuals along Oahu's North Shore, conducting numerous precautionary measures amidst the high surf warnings.The National Weather Service further cautioned about potential surges affecting coastal properties and roadways, underscoring the dual nature of the incredible yet hazardous surf conditions prevalent during this time of year.",

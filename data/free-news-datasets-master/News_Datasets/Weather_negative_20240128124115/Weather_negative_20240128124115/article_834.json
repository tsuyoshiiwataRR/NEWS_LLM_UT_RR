    "text": "December 29, 2023 - As high surf in Southern California leads to localized flooding, the California Governorâ€™s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) is taking proactive steps to keep people safe and has strategically prepositioned fire engines and personnel in Ventura County to be able to respond if needed. The prepositioned fire resources include: Ventura County: - 1 Local Government Dozer - 1 Local Government Loader - 2 Local Government Hand crews - 2 Local Government Dispatchers - 4 Local Government Ocean Rescue Swimmers The Cal OES Fire and Rescue Branch facilitates the California Fire and Rescue Mutual Aid System, which includes moving more than 270 fire engines from 60 local government resources across the state in support of all-risk emergency response on behalf of local, state, and federal government fire organizations. Cal OES assigns local government fire agencies with fire apparatus to maintain surge capacity during day-to-day duties and major emergencies. For more from Cal OES, visit [news.caloes.ca.gov](https://news.caloes.ca.gov/) and follow us on all our social media platforms.",

    "text": "Ireland weather: Freezing temperatures for New Year’s weekend as rain warning issued for several counties\nNew Year’s weekend revellers will need to wrap up as temperatures are set to plummet below freezing during the night this weekend.\nSeveral counties are being hit with two Status Yellow rainfall warnings issued by Met Éireann bringing the possibility of “localised flooding.”\nMet Éireann has issued a Status Yellow rainfall warning for Donegal, Leitrim, north Mayo, and Sligo, from 6am this Friday morning, lasting until 9pm tonight.\nThe national forecaster has warned the affected counties to expect “heavy rainfall leading to localised flooding.”\nA Status Yellow gale warning from Belfast Lough to Strangford Lough to Howth Head and on the north Irish Sea also kicked in from 5.20am this morning.\nWesterly winds will reach gale force 8 or strong gale force 9, with a maximum speed of 88kph.\nA second Status Yellow gale warning came into effect from 5.30am this morning, which ranges from Slyne Head to Erris Head to Rossan Point. Gale force winds of force 8 (62-74kph) are expected.\nMet Éireann has also issued a Status Yellow rainfall warning for counties Cork, Kerry, Waterford and Wexford this Saturday, from 2am to midday.\nMeanwhile a Status Yellow gale force winds warning has been issued for the entire coast of Ireland from midnight on Saturday for 24 hours.\nIt will be windy at first this morning with fresh to strong and gusty westerly winds, gradually easing, while there will be sunny periods and some heavy showers for much of the country.\nHowever, showery rain will persist in parts of the north and northwest for much of the day with some localised flooding likely and a chance of a little sleet in the north too.\nHighest temperatures today of 4 to 8 degrees, possibly a little lower in some northern parts.\nTemperatures will then drop below freezing for the first time this weekend, starting tonight.\n“Lowest temperatures of -1 to +3 degrees with some frost and icy stretches forming with light to moderate southwesterly or variable breezes,” Met Éireann said.\nHowever, cloud will build from the southwest, turning milder as the rain follows, extending northeastwards over much of the country by morning, accompanied by fresh to strong and gusty southeasterly winds.\nThere is a chance of transient falls of sleet on the leading edge of the rain.\nA wet and windy start to the day on Saturday with widespread rain, heavy or thundery at times with some localised flooding possible.\nThe rain will clear from the west to sunny spells and showers from the western half of the country through the morning, extending to all areas in the afternoon.\nSome showers will be heavy with a chance of isolated thunderstorms and hail. Highest afternoon temperatures of 5 to 9 degrees, coolest in the northwest.\nFresh to strong and gusty southerly winds, with onshore gales, will mean there is a chance of coastal flooding in the south and southwest.\nSaturday night will bring clear spells and squally showers overnight, most frequent in the west and southwest. Lowest temperatures of 3 to 6 degrees.\nSunday will be breezy or windy with sunny spells and scattered showers and a chance of hail. Highest temperatures of 5 to 8 degrees generally.\nOn Sunday night, showers will continue, mainly for Atlantic counties with longer spells of rain possible in the northwest. Some frost or ice will form with lowest temperatures of -1 to +3 degrees in mostly moderate westerly winds.\nThis Monday, New Year's Day will see sunny spells and scattered showers at first, becoming more isolated through the morning and early afternoon.\nCloud will build from the southwest with rain following, extending northeastwards over much of the country by night-time. Highest afternoon temperatures of 5 to 8 degrees.\nOutbreaks of rain will clear northwards from most areas on Monday night, with clear spells and scattered showers following from the west.\nLowest temperatures over the northern half of the country of -2 to 0 degrees, which are expected to be milder further south.\n“Current indications suggest that there will be further showers or showery outbreaks of rain. Highest temperatures of 6 to 9 degrees generally,” Met Éireann said of Tuesday..\nMet Éireann said the first week of 2024 also looks likely to prove quite unsettled as a low-pressure weather front will bring blustery conditions with rainfall expected to be well above early January norms.\nThe good news is that calmer weather is expected from January 8 thanks to a high-pressure front arriving in the Atlantic, although there will still be some showers around.",

    "text": "Rain Likely To Spoil New Year’s Celebrations As IMD Predicts Rainfall In These States; Check Weather Prediction For December 31 And January 1\nNew Delhi: The New Year is almost here, and you’ve probably prepared to say bye to 2023 and hello to 2024. But, there’s a hitch – rain might mess up your plans. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) says there’ll be heavy rain in many states in the next 3-4 days.\nAccording to IMD’s weather bulletin, light rainfall is likely over Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh from December 31 to Jan 2, 2024.\nHimachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and East Rajasthan are also likely to witness rainfall during the next 2-3 days.\nThe IMD has predicted, light to moderate rainfall over south Tamil Nadu and Kerala from Dec 31 to Jan 3, 2024. Heavy rainfall is also likely over southern part of Tamil Nadu on Dec 31 and January 1, 2024.\nMeanwhile, the dense fog continued to persist over Northwestern India lowering the visibility in several parts of the region. Dense to very dense fog blankets covered the many most parts of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi and some parts of Uttar Pradesh and isolated pockets over Jammu and Kashmir, Northwest Rajasthan and Northwest Madhya Pradesh.\nDense fog conditions are likely to persist in the above-mentioned regions, however, conditions may improve gradually from Dec 31, stated IMD.",

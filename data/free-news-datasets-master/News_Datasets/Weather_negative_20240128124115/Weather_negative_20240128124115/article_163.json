    "text": "Epic Waves Hit Southern California Coast To Wipe Out 2023 The Southern California coast is dealing with dangerous high surf, life-threatening rip currents, and flooding that’s expected to ride into the last weekend of 2023. Ventura County, Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach, and Palos Verdes face the most extreme conditions on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. All of those areas, plus Catalina Island, the Malibu coast, and other L.A. County beaches are under a high surf and coastal flood warning until 10 p.m. Saturday. Ventura County Very large swell is impacting our coast. If you are in a position to safely see any coastal flooding we would appreciate any reports, photos, or video. This swell is at Ventura pier and ~20'.— NWS Los Angeles (@NWSLosAngeles) [#CAwx] [pic.twitter.com/0umT8Af86V] [December 28, 2023] The larger waves are expected to be between 5 and 15 feet with sets up to 20 feet, as seen at the Ventura pier. The surf can be dangerous, especially near the water lines. Everyone should stay off of beaches, piers, and other infrastructure near the water because of the life-threatening conditions. - Listen: Big surf, SoCal housing and more - It's like 'dating the city' - By thinking about neighbors Several areas have already flooded, and the Ventura County Fire Department said on social media that eight people were taken to local hospitals after being injured by a large surge wave that flooded the shoreline near Seaward Avenue and Pierpont Boulevard. The fire department’s heavy equipment operators have been helping the Public Works Department clear flooded areas around San Pedro Street. Multiple people were rescued, according to the fire department. Additionally, each morning will bring residual high tides up to 6.5 feet, which increases the risk of coastal flooding. Heavy traffic has also been reported on the northbound 101 through the city of Ventura Thursday afternoon. Los Angeles County The larger waves are expected to be between 7 and 12 feet, with sets up to 20 feet likely around Point Conception, Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach, and Palos Verdes. Officials are encouraging people to stay out of the water, or at least swim and surf near occupied lifeguard towers. Flooding is also likely, especially in vulnerable low-lying coastal areas like parking lots, beaches, and walkways around high tide. As in Ventura County, each morning will bring residual high tides up to 6.5 feet, which will increase the risk of coastal flooding. The National Weather Service said rock jetties can be deadly in these conditions, so steer clear. However, significant damage to roads and infrastructure is not expected. Officials are reminding people to protect any flood-prone property, and never drive through water if you don’t know how deep it is. Orange County The Orange County coast is under a high surf and coastal flood warning until 2 a.m. Monday. The larger waves are expected to be between 6 to 10 feet with sets up to 12 feet in the northern areas. While surfers were taking advantage of the conditions in Huntington Beach and Newport Beach Thursday morning, officials are warning inexperienced swimmers to stay out of the water. Flooding is expected, especially in parks and roads around Seal Beach, Sunset Beach, and Newport Beach. The National Weather Service is also expecting some isolated road closures, so if you need to drive somewhere, give yourself extra time. Again, do not drive around barricades or through water if you don’t know how deep it is. - Allowable rent hikes depend on where you live, and in what type of building.

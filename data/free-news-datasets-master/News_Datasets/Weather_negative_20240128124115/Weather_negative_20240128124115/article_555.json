    "text": "A severe weather warning has been issued across the South West over New Year's weekend. Huge wind gusts are expected to cause disruption across the region, affecting transport services and potentially causing further power cuts.\nThe yellow wind warning is in place from 11am tomorrow (December 30) until 3am on December 31 and includes the whole of the South West, parts of western Wales, and the South coastline. The Met Office says: \"A spell of strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services.\"\nThe forecaster adds: \"An active cold front will move east across England and Wales during Saturday and into Sunday and will be characterised by strong winds and some heavy rain. Gusts of 45-50 mph widely, but squally near the cold front with some gusts around 60 mph, whilst the strongest gusts are likely near coasts in the west and south, with 65-75 mph in places.\"\nBristol city centre set for radical change with seven major plans Moment police try to pull over white van blocking outside m-way lane - and he ignores them\nIt comes after Storm Gerrit brought major disruption across the country, forcing road bridges to close, sparking localised power cuts in Bristol, and bringing down scaffolding in the city. The storm whirled through the UK, causing a reported 'tornado' in Greater Manchester, where it damaged around 100 properties.\nThe warning is in place until the early hours of Sunday (December 31) and the Met Office has said the forecast on New Year's Day is expected to be calmer, with breezy but weaker winds predicted. Steven Ramsdale is a Met Office Chief Forecaster. He said: “This system is likely to bring a range of\nweather including hill snow. Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”\nRead about the full New Year's Day forecast in Bristol\nhere.\nWhat to Expect\n- Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely\n- It’s likely that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and/or large waves\n- Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer\n- Some short term loss of power and other services is possible\n- Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely",

    "text": "Snow could fall over parts of Scotland, with Edinburgh due for sleet showers\nParts of Scotland may be hit by a deluge of snow this weekend with a second storm set to potentially strike just days after Storm Gerrit.\nMet Office forecasters say ‘treacherous conditions’ could hit Scotland on Saturday, bringing sleety gales of up to 60mph to Edinburgh, and 20cm of snow on hills in the north of the country.\nThis weather front could lead to a further winter storm, set to be named Storm Henk, according to senior meteorologist Jim Dale of the British Weather Services. The weather expert told i that this storm will bring “ferocious” winds and “may cause far more chaos” than Storm Gerrit.\nHe told the publication: “I encourage anyone travelling on New Year’s Eve to do so sooner rather than later on Sunday as these winds will be ferocious.”\nMet Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern warned that this ‘powerful system’ could bring similar heavy rainfall to Storm Gerrit and ‘very significant snow’ when it reaches Scotland.\nSpeaking about the 10-day weather forecast, he said: “Storm Gerrit is moving away by this stage, but another lowest forming out of the Atlantic again picked up by a powerful Jetstream and deepening rapidly as it approaches Ireland and the UK during Friday night and into Saturday.”\nHe added: “So the recipe there once again for some substantial snow over northern hills predominantly. But across Scotland certainly over the southern uplands and then into the highlands and Grampians some very significant snow building up through Saturday, 20cm plus over the tops of the mountains. So once again some treacherous conditions with the wind, rain and hills snow to contend with on Saturday. Tricky day for travelling in many places certainly.”\nThe Met Office also warned that New Year’s Eve could be wet and windy, with heavy rain forecast across most of the UK. Milder conditions are expected in southern UK areas, while cold temperatures will remain in Scotland.\nJoin Edinburgh Live’s Whatsapp Community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\nIt comes after a ‘major incident’ was declared in Scotland due to Storm Gerrit, with a string of weather warnings issued on Wednesday.\nThousands of homes remain without power and motorists and rail passengers face continued disruption after Storm Gerrit battered the country.\nEngineers worked to restore power to around 14,000 customers, though Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) Distribution warned some could be without supply into Friday.\nHigh winds, heavy rain and snow damaged electricity networks in some parts of the country while a Met Office yellow weather warning was in force across much of Scotland throughout Wednesday.\nThe weather conditions also disrupted travel, with some drivers trapped for hours on the A9 which was closed at Drumochter in the Highlands due to snow.\nOn the railways, many routes remain closed and will not reopen until safety checks have been carried out.",

    "text": "From Saturday and area of low pressure will push in from the west which will be dominant in the feature to the forecast leading into the new year. Storm Gerrit has bought challenging conditions that have now eased, on Thursday the weather will be blustery with showers, with some heavy rain in parts. Friday will continue with rain and wind and some central locations will brighten up, until Saturday morning which will see a possible deep area of low pressure moving in from the west and will affect Ireland and western parts of the UK. It is possible that snow will fall to lower levels for a short period of time across Scotland, with transient snow across the higher grounds in northern England also. Met Office Chief Forecaster, Steven Ramsdale said, “This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. “However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.” Looking further into 2024, Nick Silkstone, Met Office Deputy Chief Forecaster said, “Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.”",

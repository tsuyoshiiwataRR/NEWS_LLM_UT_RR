    "text": "Travel disruption is expected to continue in parts of the UK on Thursday following Storm Gerrit.\nThe storm wreaked havoc on the travel network on Wednesday with a string of train operators – including ScotRail, LNER and Avanti West Coast – suspending and terminating some services, as well as advising customers not to travel.\nOperators have advised that services could continue to be disrupted on Thursday, with ferry and road travel also at risk of delays.\nDale Hipkiss, national network manager at National Highways, has advised drivers using the roads today to drive to the conditions and leave some extra time for journeys, take extra supplies like snacks and warm clothing, make sure their phone is fully charged and to phone the emergency service if they encounter difficulties.\nFirstBus, a leading UK bus operator, said customers should check its various social media accounts and the First Bus app for updated information about services.\nRail delays to continue National Rail advised that the stormy weather could continue to affect railway services on Thursday, with delays, cancellations and alterations possible.\nSeveral ScotRail services remain affected and cannot resume until safety inspections have been completed, with limited rail replacement services in place.\nAffected routes included Aberdeen to Dundee, Edinburgh to Cupar, Aberdeen to Inverness and Balloch to Bowling routes, as well as the Highland Mainline and West Highland Lines.\nHeavy rain across the Transport for Wales network also means services in Wales could be impacted, with disruption on some routes possible until the end of the day on 1 January.\nTrain operator Avanti West Coast said a tree falling on overhead wires between Rugby and Lichfield Trent Valley meant some lines were blocked on Thursday morning.\nJourney times for services from London Euston towards the North West were extended as trains were diverted via the Midlands.\nIt comes after the operator, which runs services on the West Coast Main Line, said its route to Scotland was impassable on Wednesday with all services to and from London terminating at Preston.\nRelated Article\nWhen will Storm Gerrit end? How long will it last and latest UK weather forecast\nNews\nWhen will Storm Gerrit end? How long will it last and latest UK weather forecast Read More\nThose with pre-booked tickets for travel between Preston and either Edinburgh or Glasgow could board trains on Thursday or Friday, it said.\nNorthern, which operates rail networks in the North of England, has said that flood water on the line is potentially making the railway unsafe at Carnforth, north of Morecambe and Lancaster, meaning that services are likely to be cancelled or delayed by up to 60 minutes.\nPassengers can travel on alternative TransPennine Express services to Manchester Piccadilly for connections to Lancaster.\nMeanwhile, rail services at London Paddington were suspended on Thursday morning after a person was struck by a train in the Slough area, Great Western Railway (GWR) said.\nDisruption is expected to continue until 11am, with GWR and Elizabeth Line services affected.\nRail networks in Scotland were forced into widespread cancellations and delays on Wednesday, suspending multiple train services until further notice.\nOne train driver’s cabin was hit by a falling tree, with Aslef Scotland confirming the driver was uninjured and Labour MSP Paul Sweeney adding that passengers were also unharmed.\nTrain operator LNER – which runs services between London and Scotland on the East Coast Main Line – also advised passengers not to travel due to the weather, with customers stranded by the disruption told to book hotels which they can claim back.\nHigh winds can block railway tracks and damage power lines with felled trees and other debris, as well as forcing trains to run at slower speeds than usual to operate safely.\nHeavy rainfall can cause flooding on tracks, affecting train transfer points and electrical systems.\nRail journeys can be checked using the National Rail Enquiries real-time Journey Planner, while the latest status and disruption updates can be found on the National Rail website.\nOn Wednesday, 18 flights were cancelled at Heathrow airport due to air traffic control restrictions, including routes from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Jersey and Manchester as well as to Barcelona, Berlin, Madrid and Paris.\nNo further cancellations were announced by the airport as of Thursday morning.\nFerry operator Red Funnel, which provides services between Southampton and Cowes on the Isle of Wight, cancelled its Red Jet passenger services on Wednesday due to strong winds.\nAnother operator, DFDS, said on Thursday that its sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the Channel.\nPassengers are being advised to check in as normal and are being put onto the first available sailing.\nScotland Police have confirmed the A9 has reopened in both directions and is “passable with care” after snow blocked the road between Drumochter and Dalwhinnie, leaving some drivers trapped for hours.\nThe force’s Road Policing Unit warning that conditions may remain hazardous, and that extra caution should be exercised.\nThe A90 northbound has also reopened after earlier closures, but southbound lanes at Lochlands in Forfar remain off-limits with local diversions in place.\nSome roads around Scotland remained shut on Thursday morning, including the A82 between Invergarry and Fort Augustus in the Highlands and the A96 at Huntly, Aberdeenshire.\nStein Connelly, head of transport resilience at Transport Scotland, urged people to plan ahead when travelling.\nHe said: “It’s been an extremely challenging period for the transport network. The partnership response to Storm Gerrit continues and our trunk road operating companies are working hard to open roads as soon as possible.”",

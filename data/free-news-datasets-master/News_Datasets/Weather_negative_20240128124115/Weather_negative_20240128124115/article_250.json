    "text": "IMD Issues Red Alert For Delhi-NCR Amid Dense Fog The cautionary alert for Friday has been put in place to dissuade people from venturing out during the 4 am to 10 am window, as this period has witnessed car pile-ups and fatalities in Delhi-NCR over the past three days amid worsening fog conditions. Dense fog in Delhi-NCR, ANI. New Delhi: The weather department has issued a red alert for dense dense fog on Friday, advising the public to refrain from traveling in their vehicles between 4 am and 10 am, unless absolutely necessary. When visibility drops below 50 meters due to fog, it is classified as very dense fog. The cautionary alert for Friday has been put in place to dissuade people from venturing out during the 4 am to 10 am window, as this period has witnessed car pile-ups and fatalities in Delhi-NCR over the past three days amid worsening fog conditions. Kuldeep Srivastava, a scientist at IMD, explained that the improvement in fog conditions on Thursday was attributed to overnight winds in various areas, reaching speeds of up to 8 kmph. However, experts anticipate a return of very dense fog on Friday morning as the wind speed is expected to drop. In terms of temperatures, the maximum recorded at Safdarjung, the city's base station, was 21.4 degrees Celsius, slightly above normal, while the minimum temperature was 8.4 degrees Celsius. The average Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 350, a decrease from the previous day's 380. The IITM's air quality early warning system warned of unfavourable conditions for pollutant dispersion, with a likelihood of further deterioration if firecrackers are burnt on December 31. The system also indicated east-southeast winds at 6-4 kmph with partly cloudy skies and dense to very dense fog in the morning on December 29. In Gurgaon, visibility plummeted to 50 meters on Thursday due to dense fog, prompting the IMD to issue a 'yellow alert' until December 31. Dense to very dense fog is anticipated across the state from December 28 to January 1, with a recorded minimum temperature of 9.8 degrees Celsius. The city's minimum temperature is expected to remain around 10-11 degrees Celsius until January 3, while the maximum is projected to range between 22-23 degrees Celsius.

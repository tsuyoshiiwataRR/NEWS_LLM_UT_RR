    "text": "There are now four red alert Flood Warnings in Gloucestershire after the Environment Agency raised the alarm ahead of more forecast heavy rain. The [weather](https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/all-about/weather) warnings mean flooding is expected, act now, and are in place along the River Severn between Gloucester and Tewkesbury. The warnings come ahead of a [severe weather warning for wind](https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/cheltenham-news/met-office-issues-severe-weather-9002993) that has been issued for Saturday and Sunday. Heavy rain is also forecast in the county while a weather warning for rain has been issued by the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/) for Wales over the weekend, which could put extra pressure on Gloucestershire rivers in days to come. The four warning areas in Gloucestershire are for the Severn at Abbots Court, Deerhurst; Apperley and The Leigh; Chaceley and Haw Bridge; Severn Ham, Tewkesbury. Flood warnings are also in force on the River Wye from Hereford to Ross-on-Wye; North Hereford; and South Hereford.

Flood defences are being checked by its staff. People are urged to avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded. River peaks could be as late as Monday.

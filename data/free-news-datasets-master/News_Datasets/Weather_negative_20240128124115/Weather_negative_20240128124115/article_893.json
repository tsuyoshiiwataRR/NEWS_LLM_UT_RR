    "text": "Coastal winds on Portland (Image: Archive, inset: Met Office)\nA yellow weather warning for wind has been issued for Dorset.\nThe Met Office has issued the alert warning from 11am on Saturday, December 30 through to 3.00am on Sunday, December 31.\nA spell of strong and gusty winds is expected to move east, which could bring disruption to travel and services.\nAccording to the Met Office, some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport ‘are likely,’ whilst bus and train services could be affected making journeys take longer.\nThe Met Office say that it’s also likely to affect coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities, as they will be affected by spray and/or large waves.\nShort term power loss could also be expected, and delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges is likely.\nTo avoid damage to your property, the Met Office advises people to check for loose items outside your home and plan how you could secure them. These items include bins, plant pots, garden furniture, trampolines and sheds.\nFor more advice, updates on the warnings and how to keep safe in the windy conditions, visit https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/uk-warnings",

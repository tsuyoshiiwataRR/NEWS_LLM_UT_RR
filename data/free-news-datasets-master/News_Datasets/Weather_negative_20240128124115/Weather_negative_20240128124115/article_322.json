    "text": "The last few days of 2023 will see strong winds, rain and even snow featuring in parts of the UK. An area of low pressure which pushes in from the west on Saturday will be the most dominant feature in the forecast leading up to the new year.\nThe challenging conditions brought by Storm Gerrit have now eased, but Friday will be blustery with showers, some heavy, with some central locations likely to see the brightest conditions. During the early hours of Saturday morning a potentially deep area of low pressure will move in from the west to affect Ireland and western parts of the UK.\nAs the system moves eastwards, the boundary between the area of low pressure and the relatively colder conditions further north and east will lead to a band of transient snow across some of the high ground of northern England and Scotland. It is possible this snow could fall to lower levels for a brief period of time across Scotland.\nThe flooded Somerset levels between Langport and Muchelney after heavy rain from Storm Gerrit. Langport, Somerset. 27 December 2023. Steven Ramsdale is a Met Office Chief Forecaster. He said: “This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”\nNick Silkstone, Met Office Deputy Chief Forecaster, said: “Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.”\nThousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday.\nPower company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected.\nCUPAR, SCOTLAND - DECEMBER 28: Residents in the Kinloss Park area start to clear up following the affects of Storm Gerrit on December 28, 2023 in Cupar, Scotland. Almost 8,000 homes are still without power following yesterdays storm which brought blizzards and flooding to many parts Scotland. (Photo by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images) They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.”\nNational Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said.\nA supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook.\nHayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said.\nResidents in the Kinloss Park area start to clear up following the affects of Storm Gerrit on December 28, 2023 (Photo by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images) ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults.\nFriday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday.\nDamaged houses can be seen in Carbrook Village in the aftermath of a tornado (Photo by Ryan Jenkins/Getty Images) Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal.\nThe Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground.\nMet Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”\n ",

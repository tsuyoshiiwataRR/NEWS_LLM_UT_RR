Dangerous waves pummeled the Ventura coast Thursday, damaging structures, flooding roads and injuring several people. With high surf expected through Saturday , officials have closed many local beaches, harbors, coastal campgrounds and parks. Here's what is closed locally as of Friday morning: - City beaches in Ventura and at the Ventura Harbor - All California State Parks beaches and day-use areas in Ventura and Oxnard – Emma Wood, San Buenaventura, McGrath and Mandalay - Oxnard public beaches - County of Ventura beaches and parks – Faria, Hobson, Rincon Parkway RV Area, Kiddy, Silver Strand and Hollywood - Silver Strand Beach parking lot - Port Hueneme Pier - Ventura Pier - Thornhill Broome campground off Pacific Coast Highway - North Beach and Group Camp campgrounds at Emma Wood State Beach Faria Beach campground near Ventura. The county parks department expects the closure to remain in place until Jan. 5. - Ventura Harbor launch ramp and entrance - Channel Islands Harbor entrance To get sandbags: Local agencies offered a list of spots to get free sandbags.

    "text": "A garage on Nijverheidsstraat in Heerhugowaard completely burned out this evening. The fire brigade tried to extinguish the fire, but could no longer save the building. Due to heavy smoke development, local residents received a NL Alert shortly after midnight.\nvideo-caption\">First images of major fire Heerhugowaard â€“ VLN\nNews\nInitial images show flames shooting out of the roof of the company. The fire brigade is now allowing the building to burn out in a controlled manner and is trying to prevent the fire from spreading to adjacent buildings.\nThe fire may have spread more quickly because the wind is blowing very hard in the region, thanks to storm Gerrit.\nThe fire started around 10:30 p.m. The\npolice have cordoned off a large area around the building. The company is located close to the Heerhugowaard train station, but for the time being there appear to be no disruptions to the train connection.\nThe N242 runs on the other side of the company. Due to the smoke development, it was closed by the emergency services near Heerhugowaard. It is unclear for how long.\nLocal residents and people in the area have been warned with an NL Alert to stay away from the smoke. The smoke moves from Nijverheidsstraat over the area between Westerweg and Costerstraat. Anyone who is bothered by smoke at home should close windows and doors and switch off mechanical ventilation.\nMeasurements are taken to see exactly how far the smoke spreads.\nThe fire brigade has warned people not to approach the fire. They emphatically ask for space to be given to the emergency services.\nIt is currently unclear whether people were still present in the building when the fire broke out. It is also not yet known whether there have been any injuries.\nTo view this content you must accept cookies.

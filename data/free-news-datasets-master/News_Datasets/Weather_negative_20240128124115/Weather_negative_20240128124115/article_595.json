    "text": "Met √âireann has issued a status yellow thunderstorm warning for Munster, Connacht and Donegal, as Storm Gerrit continues to impact the country. The warning, which came into effect shortly after 8am this morning, will remain in place until 9pm on Thursday night, bringing a risk of further power outages, dangerous driving conditions and localised flooding. Hundreds of houses remain without power following the arrival of the storm, which brought strong winds and heavy rainfall across the country. ESB crews are working to restore supplies to homes and businesses after Storm Gerrit knocked out power overnight, with Galway and Wexford among the areas worst hit. In Cork, over 100 households are still left without power, following last night's thunder and lightning. According to the ESB's PowerCheck, over 200 households remain without power in Co Galway. A total of 862 customers were without power in Kilflynn, Co Kerry this morning, after a major fault occurred following torrential rainfall. Cork County Council confirmed there was no significant damage as a result of Storm Gerrit, which led to fallen trees and debris in parts of the county. A total of 13 trees fell over the course of Wednesday, which crews responded to diligently to clear the obstruction. \"There are no reports of any significant damage to property. High tides have passed without incident,\" the statement read. Intense thunderstorms in Wexford, great photo of lightning strikes by Dec Roche and large hail by Anita Cousins.‚Äî Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather) [pic.twitter.com/g9jr1e85gR] [December 27, 2023] The heavy rainfall led to spot flooding across parts of Cork city and county, with motorists advised to drive with caution due to the risk of damage to road surfaces. The council has also addressed the rising river levels, which are of \"no immediate concerns\" at present. Demountable flood barriers have been erected in both Mallow and Fermoy as a precautionary measure. \"Council crews are on the ground across the county responding to issues and prioritising the most critical issues where necessary,\" the statement read. \"In the event of disruption to power supply, please contact ESB Networks at 1800 372 999. In the event of disruption to water supply, please contact Uisce √âireann at 1800 278 278. In an emergency please dial 999 or 112,\" ‚ÄúThunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me‚Ä¶üò≥üò±‚õàÔ∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è.‚Äî Alan Mac C√°rthaigh üáÆüá™ (@AlanMcC82) [#StormGerrit]really ramping up along [#Courtmacsherrry]Bay & Seven Heads Peninsula & Old Head of [#Kinsale]in [#WestCork], [#Ireland]with non-stop ‚Äòvery intense‚Äô [#thunderstorms]!! üò±üåÄüå™Ô∏è ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏èüí•‚ö†Ô∏è [#thunderstorm]‚Ä¶ [pic.twitter.com/TF1O6IRPJB] [December 27, 2023] The aftereffects follow heavy gusts of wind recorded across the country last night, with winds of up to 98km/hr recorded in Sherkin Island in Cork last night, followed by gusts of up to 90km/hr, which were recorded near Shannon Airport. The power cuts follow a nationwide status yellow wind and rain warning which was in place since 8pm on Tuesday and will remain until midnight on Thursday. \"Very strong and gusty southwesterly winds in conjunction with spring tides, may lead to coastal flooding,\" said Met √âireann. \"Squally showers, with a chance of thunderstorms, may lead to localised flooding.\" A taxi driver in Waterford City was hospitalised last night after his car was hit by a falling tree during high winds. It happened in the Newtown area at around 11pm, and the driver was treated for minor injuries. Gabriel Hynes, Senior Engineer with Waterford City and County Council has urged the public to exercise caution. ‚ÄúOur ground crews are attending to a number of fallen trees and roads blocked as a result of yesterday‚Äôs Status Orange weather event. While the worst of the weather has passed, the current thunderstorm warning is expected to bring some scattered thunderstorms and spells of rain, which could lead to localised and spot flooding. These conditions combined with fallen branches and debris on the roads will make travel hazardous,\" he said. Mr Hynes advised motorists to avoid driving through flooded roads and instead choose an alternative route to avoid injury, adding: \"flood waters can be deeper than they appear\". Met √âireann issued another weather warning, which came into effect at midnight and affected those in Clare, Kerry, Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo. The status yellow wind warning will see \"southwest winds veering westerly\" which will be strong and gusty at times. \"A combination of spring tides, large waves and strong winds may result in some coastal flooding.\" That warning is in place from midnight until 6am on Friday. On Wednesday, in Skibbereen, in West Cork, the river Ilen burst its banks, flooding hundreds of acres of farmland north of the town. But thanks to its flood defences, the town remained dry. Last night, Kerry County Council issued a warning to those in the county to \"stay away from all coastal areas\", including Beara Peninsula, amid the ongoing dangerous conditions. Alan O'Reilly of Carlow Weather said the gusty weather is expected to continue into today, with \"very windy\" conditions expected throughout the day. The National forecaster has predicted a chance of \"gales\" on Atlantic coasts at times on Thursday, leading to a \"continued chance of coastal flooding\". Some frost or ice is expected to land later on in the day, with lowest temperatures of 1C to 5C expected. Friday will again see sunny spells and scattered blustery showers while Saturday be windy with sunny spells and wintry showers. Sunday is shaping up to be a calmer day with sunny spells and well-scattered showers.

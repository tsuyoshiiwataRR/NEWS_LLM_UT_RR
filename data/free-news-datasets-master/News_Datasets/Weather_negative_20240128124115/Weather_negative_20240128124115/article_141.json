    "text": "Authorities are working to restore the damaged Mossman Water Treatment Plant after heavy flooding. (Supplied: Douglas Shire Council)\nResidents in parts of flood-devastated Far North Queensland have lost access to drinking water while authorities race to fix a badly damaged water treatment plant.\nThe Douglas Shire Council, north of Cairns, issued an emergency warning late on Thursday for the Mossman, Port Douglas and Newell Beach areas, advising residents water access could be lost from midnight.\nThe region was hard-hit by record flooding that destroyed homes and infrastructure in the wake of ex-Tropical Cyclone Jasper.\nMayor Michael Kerr said landslips damaged the Mossman Water Treatment Plant, with large boulders blocking the intake area and significant debris in the water.\n“The water that’s coming from the [Mossman] Gorge at the moment has got so much sediment in it, it continues to block the filters,” he said.\n“It’s like pushing mud through a coffee filter.\n“We’re constantly having to stop the plant, clean the filters to re-flush, it and try to get it going again.”\nCr Kerr said multiple crews were working at the site, hoping to resolve the issue within six hours.\n“If we can’t get things going the way they need to go, we will turn to a raw water solution, which means a boil [water] alert will go up,” he said.\n“There will be potable water available.”\nCouncillor Kerr urged residents to conserve water.\n“They need to minimise water consumption,” he said.\n“Don’t use water if you don’t have to, go back to bottled water.\n“If you’ve still got water coming out of your taps, fill up some bottles now while you can.”\nChallenging times After the natural disaster, businesses had been looking forward to welcoming visitors to the region over the new year period.\n“This news this morning is really tough to everyone whose income depends on our visitor economy,” Tourism Port Douglas Daintree chief executive Glen Hingley said.\nHe asked that incoming visitors stay in contact with their accommodation providers and hold off on jumping in the car.\n“Just delay it a bit until we know what’s happening with the water, so not to put extra pressure on our residents, our businesses and the visitors that are already here,” Mr Hingley said.\nBut Cr Kerr urged visitors to keep their New Years Eve bookings.\n“If anyone is looking at coming up here in the next week, contact your hotel and see what the situation is before you make your decision,” he said.\n“It’s so important we don’t have another tourism crash.”\nThe Cairns Regional Council has called for an urgent upgrade to water treatment plants in the Far North in the wake of the unprecedented flooding.",

    "text": "Dense fog disrupts transport in North India, red alert issued\nHeavy fog continued to disrupt transportation across North India, causing delays in numerous flights and trains on Friday.\nThe\n[India Meteorological Department (IMD)]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/india-meteorological-department-imd ) forecasted that very dense fog conditions will last until Tuesday (January 2), with cold day conditions anticipated in [Delhi]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/delhi ), Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh.\nMoroever, a red alert has been issued over foggy conditions for [Punjab]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/punjab ), Haryana, and Delhi on Friday and an orange alert for Saturday. Punjab has an orange alert warning until Sunday.\nWhy does this story matter?\nAs the\n[cold wave]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/cold-wave ) continues to grip North India, most states and union territories have been blanketed by dense fog.\nThick fog across the Indo-Gangetic Plain and snowfall in hilly areas have severely affected commutes, especially as people gather to celebrate New Year holidays.\nOn Wednesday, over 100 flights at [Delhi's IGI Airport]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/indira-gandhi-international-airport ) were disrupted. Multiple road accidents were also reported in neighboring states.\nVideos and photos online showed people taking refuge in shelter homes to beat the freezing conditions.\nLow visibility impacts trains and flights\nThe thick fog has significantly affected train services, with many running 10-12 hours behind schedule. The Northern Railway stated that the impacted trains include the Rajdhani Express on the Delhi-Howrah route. Flight operations have also been disrupted, with visibility recorded at 150 meters in Delhi, slightly better compared to the last two days. The IMD has also asked people to get in touch with concerned airlines, railways, and state transport authorities for updates regarding the journey schedules.\nIMD predicts Delhi's minimum temperature to remain around 7 degrees\nIn a respite to residents, Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 10.7 degrees Celsius on Friday, up from 8.4 degrees Celsius the day before. However, the IMD predicted the minimum temperature will remain around 7-8 degrees Celsius over the next five days. It has cautioned people not to venture out early in the morning, particularly between 4:00am and 10:00am. A fresh western disturbance might hit northwestern India from Friday, triggering rain or snow until Monday in the hilly regions.\nRoad accidents increase amid dense fog\nAt least six people died and 12 others were injured in two separate\n[road accidents]( https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/india/road-accidents ) in Uttar Pradesh due to low visibility on Thursday.\nEarlier that day, four people were killed and six injured in separate road collisions because of dense fog.\nThe IMD has advised drivers to use fog lights and exercise caution while driving or using any mode of transportation.\nNotably, schools in Gautam Buddh Nagar, including Noida and Greater Noida, remain closed due to cold conditions.",

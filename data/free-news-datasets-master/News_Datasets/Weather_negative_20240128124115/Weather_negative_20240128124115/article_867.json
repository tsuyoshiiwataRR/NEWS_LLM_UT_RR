    "text": "Southeastern services in Kent are being 'severely delayed' between Ebbsfleet and Stratford due to flooding in one of the tunnels under the Thames. The incident is causing signalling problem which means trains in both directions are forced to only use one line. Passengers can expect delays of up to 50 minutes, according to Southeastern Railway. People have been told to use alternative routes into London. A Southeastern spokesperson said: \"Our highspeed services are being severely delayed between Ebbsfleet and Stratford and are likely to be altered at short notice which may include terminating at a station before their destination, or starting at an alternative station.\" READ MORE: [Kent weather: Met Office issues 16-hour wind warning for New Year weekend with 75mph gusts](https://www.kentlive.news/news/kent-news/kent-weather-met-office-issues-9003054) READ MORE: [Man who lives in his Ford Fiesta spends ‘perfect Christmas’ alone in Kent woods](https://www.kentlive.news/news/real-life/man-who-lives-ford-fiesta-9001236) Those travelling this afternoon (December 29) can use services from Charing Cross or London Bridge for trains between London and Gravesend, Ashford, Folkestone, Dover, Ramsgate and Canterbury West.

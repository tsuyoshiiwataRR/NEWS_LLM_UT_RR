    "text": "FLOOD warnings and alerts have been issued or updated for parts of North Yorkshire. In Malton, the Environment Agency has issued one flood alert – meaning flooding is possible – at 7.01am this morning (Friday, December 29) for the Upper River Derwent. Two flood warnings – meaning ‘act now, flooding expected’ were removed by the agency in the River Rye and River Seven catchments influencing Malton. A flood warning was issued at 6.53am by the agency on the River Derwent at Buttercrambe Mill, near Stamford Bridge. The Environment Agency said: “River levels are rising on the River Derwent due to Storm Gerrit. “Flooding is forecast to affect locations near the River Derwent, with low-lying land expected to be most affected, particularly around Buttercrambe Mill at Buttercrambe Bridge. “Further rainfall is forecast for the coming days. “Consider putting your flood plan into action.” In Stamford Bridge itself, [flood alerts issued by the Environment Agency yesterday](http://FLOOD%20warnings%20and%20alerts%20have%20been%20issued%20for%20parts%20of%20North%20Yorkshire.%20In%20Malton,%20the%20Environment%20Agency%20has%20issued%20one%20flood%20alert%20at%207.01am%20this%20morning%20(Friday,%20December%2029)%20%E2%80%93%20meaning%20flooding%20is%20possible%20%E2%80%93%20for%20the%20Upper%20River%20Derwent.%20Two%20flood%20warnings%20%E2%80%93%20meaning%20%E2%80%98act%20now,%20flooding%20expected%E2%80%99%20were%20removed%20by%20the%20agency%20in%20the%20River%20Rye%20and%20River%20Seven%20catchments%20influencing%20Malton.%20A%20flood%20warning%20was%20issued%20at%206.53am%20by%20the%20agency%20on%20the%20River%20Derwent%20at%20Buttercrambe%20Mill,%20near%20Stamford%20Bridge.%20The%20Environment%20Agency%20said:%20%E2%80%9CRiver%20levels%20are%20rising%20on%20the%20River%20Derwent%20due%20to%20Storm%20Gerrit.%20%20%E2%80%9CFlooding%20is%20forecast%20to%20affect%20locations%20near%20the%20River%20Derwent,%20with%20low-lying%20land%20expected%20to%20be%20most%20affected,%20particularly%20around%20Buttercrambe%20Mill%20at%20Buttercrambe%20Bridge.%20%E2%80%9CFurther%20rainfall%20is%20forecast%20for%20the%20coming%20days.%20%20%E2%80%9CConsider%20putting%20your%20flood%20plan%20into%20action.%E2%80%9D%20In%20Stamford%20Bridge%20itself,%20flood%20alerts%20issued%20by%20the%20Environment%20Agency%20yesterday%20morning%20remain%20in%20place%20and%20have%20been%20updated.%20Areas%20with%20flood%20warnings%20and%20flood%20alerts%20The%20flood%20warning%20is%20for%20the%20River%20Derwent%20at%20Buttercrambe%20Mill%20and%20areas%20influenced%20by%20rising%20river%20levels:%20%E2%80%A2%09River%20Derwent%20at%20Buttercrambe%20Mill%20%E2%80%93%20Buttercrambe%20Mill%20at%20Buttercrambe%20Bridge%20The%20two%20flood%20alerts%20are%20for%20the%20following%20stretches%20of%20the%20River%20Derwent%20and%20areas%20influenced%20by%20rising%20river%20levels:%20%E2%80%A2%09Lower%20River%20Derwent%20%E2%80%93%20local%20roads%20and%20low-lying%20land%20around%20Stamford%20Bridge,%20Pocklington,%20Wressle,%20Wilberfoss%20and%20Elvington.%20%E2%80%A2%09Upper%20River%20Derwent%20%E2%80%93%20the%20Upper%20Derwent%20and%20Scarborough%20areas,%20including%20land%20around%20The%20Sea%20Cut%20at%20Scalby,%20Throxenby%20Beck,%20Old%20Malton%20and%20Priorpot%20Beck%20in%20Norton.%20The%20Environment%20Agency%20flood%20alert%20added:%20%E2%80%9CWe%20are%20monitoring%20levels%20closely%20and%20have%20staff%20checking%20flood%20defences%20in%20the%20area.%20%20%E2%80%9CContinue%20acting%20on%20your%20flood%20plan.%20%20%E2%80%9CAvoid%20using%20low-lying%20footpaths%20and%20any%20bridges%20near%20local%20watercourses%20and%20do%20not%20attempt%20to%20walk%20or%20drive%20through%20flood%20water.%E2%80%9D) remain in place and have been updated.

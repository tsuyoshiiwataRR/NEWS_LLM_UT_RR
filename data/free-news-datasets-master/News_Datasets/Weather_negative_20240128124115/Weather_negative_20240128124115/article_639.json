    "text": "Iran executes four people accused of spying for Israel's Mossad Iran executed four people accused of spying for Israel on Friday, local media reported. The group, including one woman, were hanged after being convicted of kidnapping Iranian security forces in a bid to extract intelligence from them, according to the Mizan news agency, which is affiliated to the Isalmic Republic’s judiciary. They were also accused of setting fire to cars and apartments of some of Iran’s intelligence agents. Mizan identified the men as Vafa Hanareh, Aram Omari, Rahman Parhazo and the woman as Nasim Namazi. “Four members of a sabotage group related to the Zionist regime (Israel) ... were hanged this morning,” in the Islamic Republic’s northwestern province of West Azerbaijan, the news agency reported. The group “committed extensive actions against the country’s security under the guidance of … Mossad”, Israel’s spy agency, Mizan said. It added they had been sentenced to death on charges of “moharebeh”, or waging war against God, and “corruption on Earth”. Their executions followed Iran’s mid-December hanging of a fifth accused Mossad agent in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan. The latest hangings also came less than a week after an alleged Israeli airstrike [killed a high-ranking Iranian general](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/12/28/iran-revenge-top-irgc-commander-killed-israeli-strike/) in Syria. Video of confession The official IRNA news agency posted a video clip nearly eight minutes in length showing the men, that were put to death on Friday, confessing to their alleged cooperation with a Mossad officer in neighbouring Turkey, who used two names, Tony and Arash. Iranian intelligence put the group under close surveillance for at least four months, from around January 2022 until their arrest sometime that May, when they were “transferred from a neighbouring country” to Iran, the video clip showed. “They were training us for bigger assignments,” an unidentified young man in a blue striped shirt said in the clip. Several others accused of working with the same group were each sentenced to a decade in jail, Mizan reported, without providing further details. Iranian media said the case involved 10 offenders who were in video communication with Mossad officers and “set fire to cars and homes of people affiliated with the security apparatus and received cash for taking photos they sent to Mossad agents”. Shadow war Iran and Israel have long accused one another of spying and waging a shadow war. In November, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Iran was carrying out executions “at an alarming rate”, putting to death at least 419 people in the first seven months of the year. Iran said it executed an Israeli Mossad spy earlier this month, charged with releasing classified information. In January, the country’s former Iranian-British defence minister [Ali Reza Akbari was hanged](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2023/01/16/alireza-akbari-british-citizen-executed-iran-spying-charges/) for alleged cooperation with the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service. In 2020, Iran executed a man convicted of leaking information to the US and Israel about a prominent [Islamic Revolutionary Guard](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/10/19/irgc-should-be-proscribed-terror-group-robin-simcox/) general who was later killed by a US drone strike in Iraq. According to rights groups including Amnesty International, Iran executes more people per year than any other nation except China. [Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "text": "Dangerous heatwaves. More frequent severe weather. A promising year for a landmark Georgia crop undone by a warm winter and an untimely cold snap.\nA controversial mine. “Forever chemicals” in water. Questions about what to do with the toxic waste left behind from burning coal for electricity.\nExplore Explore: Georgia climate news from the AJC The biggest climate and environmental stories of 2023 showed how a warming planet and pollution are affecting the lives and livelihoods of average Georgians. But there also were stories of ingenuity and hope.\nA clean energy boom. Green jobs. Saving “sky puppies.”\nHere are the Georgia climate and environment stories to remember from 2023:\nExtreme heat\nCredit: Michael Blackshire\nCredit: Michael Blackshire\nAs the planet endured what was likely the hottest year in its recorded history, Georgia also faced dangerous heatwaves, putting vulnerable populations at risk . At the same time, new research revealed which Atlanta neighborhoods are the hottest , providing the city valuable insight to help it plan for and adapt to a warmer future .\nPeaches blitzed\nCredit: Miguel Martinez/AJC\nCredit: Miguel Martinez/AJC\nGeorgia has long been known as the Peach State, but its namesake fruit had a rough 2023 , owing to an exceptionally warm winter and a March freeze . Peaches aren’t the only crop that has struggled to adapt to rising temperatures. The state’s most valuable fruit — blueberries — has also sustained heavy losses .\nPecans lashed by a hurricane\nCredit: Special to the AJC\nCredit: Special to the AJC\nAfter Florida took a direct hit from Hurricane Idalia in late August, the storm churned north into Georgia, causing severe damage on many farms in the southern part of the state. Pecans were hit hardest , with thousands of trees uprooted by the winds on some farms, but federal help should help growers replant and recover.\nWildfires\nCredit: Georgia Forestry Commission\nCredit: Georgia Forestry Commission\nFirefighters battled several fires in northwest Georgia this fall, including at least one that was the result of arson . Bone-dry conditions, falling leaves and gusty winds combined to fuel several significant blazes. The fires were a reminder of the risk of wildfires in heavily wooded Georgia, particularly in times of drought, a condition that is likely to be more common amid a changing climate.\nGeorgia a green jobs winner\nCredit: Natrice Miller / Natrice.Miller@\nCredit: Natrice Miller / Natrice.Miller@\nAfter Hyundai announced plans to build its “Metaplant” in Georgia in 2022, the state continued its hot streak in recruiting electric vehicle (EV) and clean energy projects . Hyundai not only helped bring a wave of suppliers, the main Hyundai plant under construction in Bryan County grew to a $7.6 billion investment and 8,500 promised jobs.\nSolar panel manufacturer Qcells announced a major expansion of its production capacity at two sites in Georgia , while a host of battery makers and other EV parts suppliers announced plans to come to the state, bringing thousands of jobs with them.\nPlant Vogtle\nCredit: arvin.temkar@ajc.com\nCredit: arvin.temkar@ajc.com\nThe long-delayed and over-budget expansion of the nuclear power plant near Augusta finally switched on its first new reactor , making history in the process and bringing a major new source of clean energy to the state .\nVogtle’s second new unit, meanwhile, sustained a setback, while Georgia Power’s customers found out how much more they’ll be paying for the project .\n‘Forever chemicals’\nCredit: TNS\nCredit: TNS\nAs a federal crackdown looms on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — also known by their acronym, PFAS — for water supplies, new testing revealed which Georgia water systems contain concentrations of the chemicals .\nA major lawsuit over PFAS contamination in northwest Georgia reached a settlement, bringing the city of Rome tens of millions of dollars . But in its wake, a legal fight over DuPont and its successor companies’ deal with the city erupted. At the same time, water utilities across the state are weighing their options to remove the chemicals from their water supplies .\nWater war victory\nCredit: Riley Bunch/riley.bunch@ajc.com\nCredit: Riley Bunch/riley.bunch@ajc.com\nIn one of the long-running disputes with its neighbors in Alabama over the states’ shared water supplies, Georgia notched a major legal victory . And in another of the so-called “water wars,” Georgia and Alabama reached a tentative deal that could resolve a separate conflict .\nBats\nCredit: Jason.Getz@ajc.com\nCredit: Jason.Getz@ajc.com\nMany of Georgia’s bats — dubbed “sky puppies” by lovers of the flying mammals — are in serious decline due to a number of threats, from human development to a deadly fungal disease.\nAs more of the animals make their homes in bridges and culverts around the state , a multi-agency effort to protect them is paying off.\nInvasive species\nCredit: Yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina, formerly called Asian hornet) by Gilles San Martin is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0 (cropped)\nCredit: Yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina, formerly called Asian hornet) by Gilles San Martin is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0 (cropped)\nGeorgia is home to an impressive array of native wildlife, but a few invasive species showed up in the state this year uninvited. A bee-eating hornet and a blue land crab were among the most concerning new arrivals.\nFishing access\nCredit: TNS\nCredit: TNS\nGeorgia is home to thousands of miles of rivers and streams, but a new state law has raised questions over what is and is not a public waterway . A lawsuit is testing where the state will draw the line on the issues of private property and public access, with big implications for people who fish and other lovers of the great outdoors.\nOkefenokee mine\nCredit: Photos contributed by Georgia state parks and historic sites\nCredit: Photos contributed by Georgia state parks and historic sites\nThe fight over a proposed titanium mine near the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge heated up in 2023. Georgia environmental regulators released the project’s draft mining plan in January , but no permits have been issued yet.\nThen, this fall, the Okefenokee was tabbed for nomination to a prestigious list reserved for the planet’s most significant natural, historical and cultural gems . At the same time, opponents of the project have stayed on the attack, this time targeting corporate boardrooms .\nCoal ash\nCredit: TNS\nCredit: TNS\nGeorgia’s electricity providers are turning away from their dirty and expensive coal-fired power plants. But as they do, big questions remain about how to handle the pits of dangerous waste left behind by years of burning coal .\nGeorgia Power is giving some of its coal ash a second life in concrete mixes , but there are serious legal and environmental questions about its handling of the material left behind at other sites .",

    "text": "A Dense Fog Advisory will remain in effect for much of the area through 7 AM Friday. Henrietta, N.Y. â€“ A Rochester woman faces charges after police say they found her unconscious behind the wheel at an intersection. Police responded to reports of a suspicious vehicle at the intersection of Jefferson Road and Jay Scutti Boulevard in Henrietta around 4:40 a.m. on Christmas Eve. After running the license plates, officers discovered the car had been reported stolen two weeks ago. Police say the driver, Casey R. Clohessy, 36, was unconscious behind the wheel of a Nissan Sentra with drug paraphernalia visible. After deputies attempted to put the car in park, Clohessy allegedly woke up and tried to drive off. A deputy removed the keys from the ignition. Police said Clohessy tried to run away but was taken into custody. Clohessy is charged criminal possession of stolen property, operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, aggravated unlicensed operation and resisting arrest. She also had outstanding warrants out of Monroe County Court, Rochester City Court and Irondequoit Town Court. She faces an additional charge of criminal possession of stolen property stemming from a warrant. Clohessy was arraigned in Henrietta Town Court and taken to Monroe County Jail on a warrant. She remains listed on the jail roster.",

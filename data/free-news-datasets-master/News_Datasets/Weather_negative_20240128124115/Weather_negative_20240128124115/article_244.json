    "text": "Low visibility caused by dense fog choked normal life in the Tricity on Thursday. It was season’s first foggy day, in which visibility in the area was between 15 metres and 50 metres. The weather department has issued yellow and red alert for the upcoming days, including on New Year’s eve due to the forecast of dense to very dense fog in [Chandigarh](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/chandigarh/) and surrounding region. The forecast for January 1 is clear weather. Mainly dry weather is likely to prevail over Chandigarh in the next four-five days. Meanwhile, mercury was down 0.3 degree Celsius on Thursday. The minimum temperature recorded was 8.8 degree Celsius, while maximum temperature stood at 19.5 degree Celsius. Chandigarh traffic police issued advisory, urging people to avoid late and early morning travel. The advisory caution the road users to drive their vehicles at a low speed while putting the indicators on blinking mode. The air connectivity in Chandigarh was affected for the first time during the current winter season, with half a dozen flights diverted and delayed. The early morning [Pune](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/pune/)-Chandigarh light was diverted to [Delhi](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/), resulting in the cancellation of Delhi-Chandigarh light. Meanwhile, Bengaluru-Chandigarh flight arrived with a delay of around four hours. The flights departures at Shaheed Bhagat Singh International Airport were delayed by at least one hour. According to the officials of Shaheed Bhagat Singh International Airport, four flights which were to be departed in the morning were affected due to dense fog. The flights left with a delay of around two hours. Officials maintained that passengers can face the inconveniences due to the weather conditions in the coming days. Even the rail journey was affected with more than 20 trains including Shatabdi and Vande Bharat running late from their scheduled times. “Around 40-50 trains out of 200 originated from Ambala Railway division including Shatabdi, Vande Bharat were delayed due to dense fog. We reduced the speed of Shatabdi, Vande Bharat to around 75 km per hour in the view of low visibility,” [Mandeep Singh](https://indianexpress.com/about/mandeep-singh/) Bhatia, Divisional Railway Manager (DRM), Ambala, said. The precautionary patrolling on the tracks is being carried out these days regularly, the DRM added. Meanwhile, there was less traffic on the roads in Chandigarh today. The supply of milk, dairy products and newspapers was found delayed in many areas in the Tricity.",

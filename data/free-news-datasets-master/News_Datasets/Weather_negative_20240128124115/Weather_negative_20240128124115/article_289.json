    "text": "Thousands of homes are still without power after Storm Gerrit wreaked havoc across northern England and Scotland.The chaotic weather has delivered everything from heavy snow to a damaging tornado this week, ruining many people's journeys home from Christmas festivities. Around 1,500 properties in Scotland are still suffering electricity outages, with people in the northeast and Shetland among the worst affected.Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks hopes to restore power to the remaining households on Friday and welfare vans serving hot food and drink will be open to customers in the meantime. Image: A flooded road in Cupar, Fife, this week 'Absolute disaster' The storm is also still being felt in northern England and Wales.Stalybridge, Tameside, and Carrbrook in Greater Manchester are in a \"recovery phase\", local authorities have said, after they were hit by a rare tornado that toppled trees and damaged homes.The freak whirlwind was thought to have been caused by a supercell thunderstorm, and residents said it had left some homes looking like \"an absolute disaster\".Elsewhere, three men died after their 4x4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale. In Wales, 36,000 properties were left without power after lightning struck in Ceredigion.

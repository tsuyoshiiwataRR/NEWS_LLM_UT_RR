    "text": "It’s been a rainy day at Walt Disney World. With such poor weather, there weren’t many guests at Magic Kingdom, and only one security line has been operating at the Transportation and Ticket Center. This is where most guests go through security screening before entering the park. Unfortunately, as the rain has subsided, crowds of guests have arrived but only one line remains open.\nTransportation and Ticket Center Security Line\nWhen we were leaving the Transportation and Ticket Center between 1:00 p.m. and 1:20 p.m., the security line stretched under the bridge and into the disability parking lot.\nGuests who took a tram from their car were being dropped off close to the security station but then had to walk back to the end of this line.\nA Cast Member told us that there was a fire code in one of the parking lots that pulled several security officers away from the Transportation and Ticket Center.\nGuests rushing to the back of the line also led some trams to make emergency stops due to danger.\nHopefully, another security screening station will open soon and the long line will be resolved.\nAll guests must go through security screening. In addition to the Transportation and Ticket Center, there are smaller security stations at the nearby resorts for park guests to go through.\nFor the latest Disney Parks news and info, follow\nWDW News Today on\nRelated posts:\nREVIEW: Mickey Mousse Ornament Treat From Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party at Magic KingdomNovember 8, 2022 PHOTOS: Three Little Pigs, Mulan, and Mushu Greet Guests for Lunar New Year at Disney California Adv...January 30, 2022 DeSantis' Central Florida Tourism Oversight District to Void Disney's Land Use Agreement and More at...April 20, 2023",

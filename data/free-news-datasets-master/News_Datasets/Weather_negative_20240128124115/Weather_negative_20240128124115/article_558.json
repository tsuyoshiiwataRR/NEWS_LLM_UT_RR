A Met Office forecast said: \"An active cold front will move east across England and Wales during Saturday and into Sunday and will be characterised by strong winds and some heavy rain. \"Gusts of 45-50mph widely, but squally near the cold front with some gusts around 60mph, whilst the strongest gusts are likely near coasts in the west and south, with 65-75mph in places.\" In terms of rainfall, they said there could be 20-30mm of rain falling widely and as much as 40-50mm in the northwest. It added: \"If you are on the coast, stay safe during stormy [weather](https://www.dailypost.co.uk/all-about/north-wales-weather) by being aware of large waves. Even from the shore large breaking waves can sweep you off your feet and out to sea. \"Take care if walking near cliffs; know your route and keep dogs on a lead. In an emergency, call 999 and ask for the Coastguard. Be prepared for weather warnings to change quickly: when a weather warning is issued, the Met Office recommends staying up to date with the weather forecast in your area.\" Looking further ahead into 2024, Nick Silkstone, Met Office Deputy Chief Forecaster, said: “Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.” [Sign up now for the latest news on the North Wales Live Whatsapp community](https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/join-north-wales-live-whatsapp-27935216) Find out what the weather is up to near you",

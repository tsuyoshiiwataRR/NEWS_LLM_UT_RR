    "text": "Parts of Essex will face disruption due to strong winds over the weekend. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning from Saturday morning (December 30) through to the early hours of Sunday (December 31), with transport likely to be affected. The strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services. This will affect the coastal areas of Essex including Southend-on-Sea, Thurrock, Clacton and Burnham-on-Crouch, as well as places like Chelmsford and Colchester. The Met Office estimates that the adverse conditions will begin on Saturday morning at around 11am, and continue until 3am on Sunday. There may be delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport as a result of the winds.

Some bus and train services may be affected, with journeys taking longer, and delays are likely for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges. Driving in these conditions can be dangerous, so anyone getting by behind the wheel this weekend should follow the advice issued by the Met Office. This includes driving slowly to minimise the impact of wind gusts, holding the steering wheel firmly and giving cyclists, motorcyclists, lorries and buses more room than usual. Measures can also be taken to avoid causing damage to people or your property. Items like bins, plant pots and garden furniture should be secure or else taken inside your home during the period of heavy winds.",

    "text": "‘Blowtorch’ heat roasts the south as powerful El Nino strikes\nBlowtorch heat and El Nino\nAmerica is facing a nation divided as a crippling ice storm grips the north while ‘blowtorch’ heat roasts the south. Warm air from Mexico is bringing above-average temperatures to the south-west and southeast, possibly due to a powerful El Nino, which is strengthening after being confirmed in the autumn.\nImpact of El Nino\nUnseasonable warmth may be the result of a powerful El Nino, which is causing a change in the direction of the Trade Winds off the coast of South America, leading to warm sea water near Peru. This has global effects on the weather, altering seasonal weather patterns across the US. Simmering ocean waters, still warmer than average, may also fuel the heat surge.\nUnstable atmospheric conditions\nUnstable atmospheric conditions triggered by cold and warm air mixing will further the US’ storm misery. As cold air moves south and meets warmer air coming in from Mexico, it is likely to trigger further heavy rain and stormy conditions, possibly influenced by El Nino and the lag effect of hot weather over the summer leaving ocean temperatures warmer than average.",

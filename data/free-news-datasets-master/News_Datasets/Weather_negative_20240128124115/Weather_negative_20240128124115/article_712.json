    "text": "Frigid nights ahead Published 8:07 am Friday, December 29, 2023 BROOKHAVEN â€” Pond steam and the billowing clouds of steam rising from hot coffee should illustrate how cold the mornings are right now. Frost and chilly temperatures will likely greet each sunrise for the next few days according to the National Weather Service forecast. Frost is forecast to linger until 9.a.m. Friday morning. Temperatures will be 50 degrees with sunny skies. Wind gusts again will be around 20 mph and sustained winds between 5 to 10 mph. Friday night will cool off to a low of 29 degrees. Jack Frost is forecast to visit again with frost forming early Saturday morning around 1 a.m. and lingering until 8 a.m. The high will be 54 with sunny skies Saturday. Sunday could have frost forming again but the sunshine and southern winds should warm up the day. High temperatures could reach 62. Sunday night is forecast to have a 40 percent chance of rain. New Years Day will have a 20 percent chance of rain. Sprinkles could come Tuesday and rain chances increase to 40 and 50 percent Tuesday night and Wednesday according to the forecast. It might be a good time to make some hot chocolate or coffee to beat this cool weather. Share how you are fighting against the chilly temperatures.",

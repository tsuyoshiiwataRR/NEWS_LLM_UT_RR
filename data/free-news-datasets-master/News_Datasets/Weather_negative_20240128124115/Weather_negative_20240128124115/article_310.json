    "text": "The last few days of 2023 are set to be blighted by strong winds,\nrain and snow as the UK feels the aftermath of Storm Gerrit.\nAlthough the peak of Storm Gerrit has now passed, Thursday will continue to be blustery with showers, some heavy and more organised in parts. Friday continues this general theme with some central locations likely to see the brightest conditions.\nThe move comes after a supercell thunderstorm crossed Greater Manchester on Wednesday night that had a ‘strong rotating updraft’, which resulted in a ‘localised\ntornado’. Around 100 properties were damaged by the ‘tornado’ in Stalybridge, Tameside, and residents in the badly hit village of Carrbrook told of the states of ‘absolute disaster’ houses were in.\nHowever, the Met Office reported the ‘worst’ of Storm Gerrit has cleared away as of Thursday afternoon.\nMeteorologist Alex Burkill said the blustery and showery picture is expected to continue overnight and into Friday, with winds expected to ease slightly across most of the UK.\nA further bout of ‘very strong winds’ and a spell of ‘intense rain’ is expected on Saturday before more unsettled weather with ‘blustery, showery conditions likely as we go through New Year’s Eve’, the meteorologist added.\nMet Office Chief Forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: ‘Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit.’\nLooking further ahead into 2024, there is low forecast confidence. ‘Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely,’ said a Met Office spokesperson.\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at .\nFor more stories like this,\ncheck our news page.\nSign Up for News Updates\nGet your need-to-know latest news, feel-good stories, analysis and more\nPrivacy Policyand Terms of Serviceapply.",

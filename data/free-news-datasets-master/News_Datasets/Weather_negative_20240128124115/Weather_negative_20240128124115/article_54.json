    "text": "Shocking footage has captured the [terrifying moment](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/weather) a tornado hit a Manchester street, causing damage to dozens of homes and cars. There was a major incident put in place in the area after the windstorm with speeds of up to 160mph hit the residential street. One couple who were on holiday when it hit came home to find a \"fist-sized\" hole in their BMW caused by the strong winds and chaos, reports [the Manchester Evening News.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/stalybridge-tornado-greater-manchester-cctv-28360256) Craig, whose car and home were damaged, said: \"We were away in Whitby for a couple of nights and one of our neighbours called us just after it happened at midnight to let us know what the damage was. \"They told us our roof was a mess and we had a big hole in the front of our car from one of the tiles that came down. We packed up early doors and made our way home. \"We have severe roof damage - we have lost 50 to 60 tiles at the front and back of the house. The car is damaged, the bonnet, all down the side, the windscreen. The hole in the bonnet you can put your fist through it.\" He continued: \"It is a bit freaky. Our home is in the epicentre of where all the damage was caused. I have been filling out my insurance form writing 'tornado', I never thought I would write that word in my life. \"The footage from the CCTV showed garden furniture spinning around and when we looked closely you could see our shed being shaken.\" The Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) visited the site and confirmed the area was hit by a tornado with a provisional maximum damage rating of T5, which sees winds of 137 to 160 mph. The category would result in cars levitating, entire roofs being removed, items sucked from inside houses - like furniture - utility poles snapping, and older weaker buildings collapsing completely. Cllr Ged Cooney also said: “We are now in the recovery phase following the step down of a major incident declared last night when a ‘mini tornado’ hit Stalybridge. \"Thankfully there are no casualties from the incident but there are of course local residents who are devastated by the damage caused to their homes. \"With around 100 homes affected, the council is working to support residents, making sure they have a safe place to stay while they cannot re-enter their homes.\" He added: \"I’d like to thank our emergency services and council officers for all their continued work. The local community have also been so generous in offering their support and we never fail to see a true sense of community spirit and support in situations like these. I am proud of the combined efforts and the ongoing support.\" Join the Daily Record WhatsApp community! Get the latest news sent straight to your messages by joining our WhatsApp community today.

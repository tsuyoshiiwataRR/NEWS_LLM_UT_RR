The Ventura County Fire Department (VCFD) shared [video](https://twitter.com/VCFD_PIO/status/1740541508707906012) of the surge, which swept cars away and flooded the roadway as people ran for safety as fast as they could. None of the injuries were life-threatening, Ventura County Fire Capt. Brian McGrath told the [Ventura County Star](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2023/12/28/high-surf-in-ventura-leads-to-rescue-of-8/72050745007/). The most serious injury was reportedly a broken ankle, according to [KCLU](https://www.kclu.org/2023-12-28/rogue-wave-injures-eight-damages-some-homes-in-ventura). VCFD heavy equipment crews are working to clear the debris from San Pedro Street, [Public Information Officer](https://twitter.com/VCFD_PIO/status/1740526817184989551) Andy VanSciver said on X. The wave occurred during the high surf advisory at high tide. The high surf warning is in effect until 10 p.m. on Saturday.

    "text": "Late on Wednesday 27th December 2023, the Millbrook and Carrbrook areas of Stalybridge were hit by a Tornado as the named storm \"Gerrit\" hit the north-west of England.\nAlthough the 'Tornado', more accurately a 'supercell thunderstorm' lasted only seconds it wrecked homes, ripping off roofs, causing walls to collapse, felling trees and damaging cars.\nGreater Manchester Police declared a major incident with roads closed and residents evacuated.\nDespite the damage caused there were no reports of injuries resulting from the tornado. Some residents will be unable to return to their homes for sometime, and no one will be allowed to return until structural engineers have assessed the damage.\nTameside Tornado - December 2023\nNo Thumbnail\nÂ© Bing Maps\nBy\nMike_bjm@ 2023-12-29 09:46:00\nLinks:\nwww.theguardian.com, www.itv.com, www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk, https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/tameside-tornado-what-supercell-thunderstorm-28362227, www.bbc.co.uk\n3 views\nUnrated\nCategories\nNearby Maps (50 km): 1,108\nShare:",

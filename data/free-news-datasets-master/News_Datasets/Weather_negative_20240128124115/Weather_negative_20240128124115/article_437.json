    "text": "Queenslandhas sweltered through its hottest December day in four years but residents are warned of another round of destructive storms this weekend.\nThe hot weather impacted much of northern Australia, with temperatures climbing into the mid-to-high 40s in some areas, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.\nBrisbane reached 38.3 degrees marking the hottest December day since 2019.\nIt comes as eastern states embark on a clean-up mission following severe weather and brace for potentially more dangerous, stormy conditions.\nFurther severe weather has been forecast for parts of eastern Australia for the final weekend of 2023, with severe thunderstorms expected to redevelop across eastern Queensland and northeast New South Wales from Saturday into the New Year.\nThere is a risk of severe thunderstorms across Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Hunter regions in New South Wales, and across south-east and central Queensland.\nWhile the conditions from storms earlier this week have eased, BOM senior meteorologist Sarah Scully said isolated thunderstorms would develop from Queensland all the way to Victoria and South Australia.\n\"There are indications that isolated, very dangerous thunderstorms with destructive winds, giant hail and intense rainfall may be possible across southeast Queensland on Saturday,\" Scully said.\n\"Everyone is encouraged to stay up to date with the latest forecasts and warnings.\"\nAs severe thunderstorms develop across the east, heatwaves are also expected across Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland.\nParts of Western Australia are forecast to reach 49 degrees on Saturday and in the Northern Territory, low to severe-intensity heatwave conditions will cover most areas.\nExtreme heatwave conditions have been forecast for parts of northern Queensland, while low to locally severe heatwave conditions are building around Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and Cairns.\nMeanwhile, the Gold Coast's Movie World has reopened after the Christmas Day storm caused trees to fall around rides and rollercoasters.\nVillage Roadshow's chief operating officer Bikash Randhawa said he had not seen a storm like it in 30 years.\n\"It came from nowhere ... It hit us pretty hard,\" Randhawa said.\n\"We would not open if things were not safe.\n\"That's the reason why Paradise Country (a section of the park) is still closed.\n\"It will be closed until we assess the damage and it is deemed safe for people to come in.\"\nThe Bureau of Meteorology has been criticised for not putting out more warnings before the storm.\nEnergex aims to have 90 per cent of households reconnected to power by December 31.\nResidents in Mount Tambourine and Jimboomba will need their systems rebuilt so will have a much longer wait for electricity.\nThe storm was described as an \"unprecedented disaster\" by the state's police commissioner yesterday.\nFinancial assistance of $180 per person and $900 for families has been made available by the state government.\nSix people have died from the storms in the state over the festive period.",

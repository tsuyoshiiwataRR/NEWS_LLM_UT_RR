File photo | News-Press NOW Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save The pavement on Interstate 229 couldn’t take the heat this summer.A scorching July day with temperatures above 90 degrees caused a section of the double-decker to buckle, forcing a portion of the highway to close for two weeks for maintenance.Troy Slagle with the Missouri Department of Transportation said this is an uncommon occurrence on bridges, but I-229 had issues that needed to be tended to immediately.Road crews began scheduled maintenance a little early to coincide with the emergency repairs and cause the least disruption to travelers.While the pavement may be stable, the bridge’s future isn’t. MoDOT is in the early stages of a project that would demolish the bridge and likely replace it with a four-lane roadway. MoDOT will soon submit its environmental assessment to the Federal Highway Administration for approval. After that, however, Northwest district engineer for MoDOT Marty Liles said it could still be five to seven years before all of the necessary funding is secured to move forward.

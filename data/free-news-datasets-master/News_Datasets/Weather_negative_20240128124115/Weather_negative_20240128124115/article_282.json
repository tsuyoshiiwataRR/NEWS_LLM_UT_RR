    "text": "A massive swell is absolutely pummeling California right now.\nIn fact, it’s not just one swell; rather, a flurry of swells. Accordingly, surfers and surf spectators are flocking to the beaches up and down the coast to: 1) watch the swell from the presumed safety of the shore (not always the case), or 2) paddle out.\nBut in some cases, and at some spots, there’s a little too much swell.\nView the original article to see embedded media.\nLike Capitola, CA – north of Big Sur, and south of surfing hotspots like Santa Cruz and the Golden State’s most revered big-wave spot, Mavericks, in Half Moon Bay.\nOn Thursday, December 28 th , the swell was so big, so strong, so mighty that waves were washing over the pier (see above) and a rogue wave nearly swept a woman out to sea (see below).\nChaos in Capitola.\nJust north, at Mavericks, a similar scene went down when a sneaker wave washed ashore and took down a flock of spectators trying to get a glimpse of California’s premier big-wave surfing destination. It was like a wet mop going at a trail of ants.\nThis is just the beginning, too. More is on the way.\nHere’s the latest from surf forecasters, Surfline , regarding this run of swell:\nIt’s already been an eventful week in California – especially north of Point Conception – and there is more to come. Finding the windows of favorable wind in between storms will be a challenge. Things to note:\n-Solid to locally XXL W-WNW swell Thu-Fri for California\n- Stormy wind for NorCal with some brief windows, SoCal AM wind is generally light\n- Another big W swell arrives over the weekend but wind is pretty tough statewide\nStay tuned; stay safe.\n***\nDon't miss another headline from SURFER!

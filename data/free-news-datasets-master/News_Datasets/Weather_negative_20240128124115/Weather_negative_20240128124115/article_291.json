    "text": "The National Weather Service Guam Weather Forecast Office said that a high risk of rip currents will be in effect for Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan from 6 p.m. Friday to Sunday night for east-facing reefs of the Marianas. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from the shore into deeper water. Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to dangerous conditions. If caught in a rip current, do not swim against the current. Swim in a direction following the shoreline, face the shore and call or wave for help, NWS said. A small craft advisory will be in effect for Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan from 6 p.m. Friday until 5 p.m. on Sunday. Northeast winds of 15 to 25 knots, with gusts up to 30 knots, and seas of 7 to 11 feet are expected. Inexperienced mariners, especially those operating smaller vessels, should avoid boating in hazardous conditions. The Offices of Guam Homeland Security and Civil Defense remind the community to avoid hazardous surf and seas.

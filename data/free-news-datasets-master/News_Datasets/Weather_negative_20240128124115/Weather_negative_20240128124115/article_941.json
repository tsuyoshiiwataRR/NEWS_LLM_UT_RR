There is no improvement in sight, on the contrary: new rain is on the way.\nMunich – The flood situation in Germany remains critical. In the past few days, experts were already expecting further rain at the turn of the year. This forecast now seems to be confirmed: In the flood areas, of all places, heavy downpours are expected to occur again at the turn of the year.\n\"Weather forecasts worrying\": Despite flooding, no end to rain in sight for the time being Meteorologist Dominik Jung from wetter.net explains in a press release: \"The latest weather forecasts are worrying.\" In the next 48 hours, the \"high-resolution ICON-D2 model\" from the German Weather Service (DWD) would expect 30 to 50 liters of precipitation per square meter, especially in the flood areas.\nWill the situation in the flood areas come to a head at the turn of the year? According to the weather forecast, it probably is. Meteorologists announce new rain.

Especially over central Germany, where many dams are currently overflowing, the experts expect heavy precipitation until the end of the year.\nAnd the experts also predict new masses of water in Germany in January: \"The first ten days of January could bring 100 to 120 litres of rain in the west and south. The westerly weather situation simply does not want to end in the serious forecast period,\" says Jung. According to information from the DWD, the westerly weather situation (also known as \"westerly exposure\") describes a weather situation in which a strong west-to-east current develops over Europe over several days.\nWeather in Germany: \"Cold and snow don't stand a chance for the time being\" Winter fans will probably go away empty-handed at the beginning of the year. \"Cold and snow don't stand a chance in Germany for the time being. As a result, the risk of flooding remains very tense,\" predicts Jung. \"In many cases, the dikes and dams are softening more and more, threatening to break. They are soaked by the rain and pressurized by the floods.\"\nMy news Thief fills 189 liters in canister reading\nDischarged water from reservoir threatens places in Thuringia\nThe oldest butcher's shop in Germany comes from Baden-Württemberg read\nLake in Baden-Württemberg is the largest in the country – it is often overlookedread\nJetstream is heading for Germany: Current weather forecast makes people sit up and take noticeread\nFlood situation critical: Lower Saxony calls on Bundeswehr for helpRead\nOverall, it was particularly wet in 2023.

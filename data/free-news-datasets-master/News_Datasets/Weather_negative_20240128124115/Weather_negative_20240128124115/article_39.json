    "text": "While the devastating power of a big tornado is more commonly associated with the wide open plains of the central US, in reality you are more likely to experience one in this country. The UK is struck by about 2.3 tornadoes per year for every 10,000 square kilometres, according to research - a higher density than the US, which as a whole has just 1.3 per 10,000 square km. Typically they are much smaller, fortunately - a small tornado which swept through Littlehampton in October smashed walls, moved parked cars and left one person hurt. In July 2005, a large tornado in Birmingham caused Â£40million in damages and injured 39. There have even been fatalities in the past - a strong tornado in South Wales in 1913 killed three. While the devastating power of a big tornado is more commonly associated with the wide open plains of the central US, in reality you are more likely to experience one in this country (pictured: Tameside) The UK is struck by about 2.3 tornadoes per year for every 10,000 square kilometres, according to research - a higher density than the US, which as a whole has just 1.3 per 10,000 square km (pictured: Tameside) A missing roof exposed a home's bedroom in the aftermath of a tornado, after a monster storm system tore through the South and Midwest in April 2023 According to David Schultz, Professor of Synoptic Meteorology at the University of Manchester, the likelihood of being in the path of one is highest in the American states in 'Tornado Alley', such as Oklahoma (3.6 per 10,000 square km) or Kansas (11.2) (pictured: Tameside) But he says a random location in the UK is more likely to experience a tornado than a random location in the US (pictured: Tameside) In some cases they occur in 'outbreaks' - such as November 23 1981, which produced 104 tornado reports from Anglesey to Norwich. According to David Schultz, Professor of Synoptic Meteorology at the University of Manchester, the likelihood of being in the path of one is highest in the American states in 'Tornado Alley', such as Oklahoma (3.6 per 10,000 square km) or Kansas (11.2). But he says a random location in the UK is more likely to experience a tornado than a random location in the US. Prof Schultz said more research is needed on the causes of British tornados, which he says may be under-reported as they cannot be detected by weather satellites.",

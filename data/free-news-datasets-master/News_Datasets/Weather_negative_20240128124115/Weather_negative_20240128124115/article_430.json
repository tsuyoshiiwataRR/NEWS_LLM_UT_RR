    "text": "One of the leading weather forecasters has warned that conditions that caused the &apos;Beast from the East&apos; could lead to snow hitting Europe in January. The Met Office has said there is a &apos;greater than normal&apos; risk of snow next month, but the forecaster is not quite sure exactly where the snow will strike.\nThese conditions being forecasted could land the UK in a deep freeze, according to Sky News. This is due to a change in wind patterns high up in the atmosphere, and is due to &apos;sudden stratospheric warming&apos;, the Met Office has explained.\nThis has been forecast for early January, and could see parts of the country facing some brutally cold temperatures the following week. Professor Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, said: \"When you get an SSW it increases the likelihood of a prolonged cold spell across Northern Europe, like the Beast from the East.\"\nREAD MORE: New London weather map shows blanket of snow for 4 whole days in January\nForecasters aren&apos;t exactly sure when this cold snap will happen (Image: Tim Robberts) However, the Met Office aren&apos;t yet sure if this is even going to happen. A spokesperson for the weather forecaster said it&apos;s currently too early to tell what&apos;s going to happen, or where it might hit.\nA sudden stratospheric warming happens when polar vortex winds in the stratosphere stop, slow or reverse direction. This causes rapid warming in the stratosphere but then has a knock-on effect by disrupting the jet stream a few weeks later.\nWhen the jet stream is disrupted, it allows cold air to travel further south in part of the Northern Hemisphere, hitting parts of Europe with a freezing spell of cold weather. However, forecasters can&apos;t tell when this is going to happen yet.\nA cold spell is currently forecast for the second week of January, but it could end up being later or last longer. The Met Office&apos;s current long-range forecast for January 12 through to January 26 says: \"Compared to normal, there is an increased chance of colder than average conditions during this period, and a reduced chance of prolonged periods of very unsettled / milder conditions with frequent rain and wind pushing in from the Atlantic.\n\"Currently the chance of widespread severe cold is still deemed low, but still the risk of impacts from cold, ice and snow is greater than normal.\"\nGot a story for us?

    "text": "The Met Office has warned homes and businesses in Rugby could flood over the next 24 hours after the high winds and downpour from Storm Gerrit. The weather agency has issued 26 flood warnings across the country where the likelihood of residential and commercial properties flooding is considered high. One of those warnings relates to the River Swift in [Rugby](https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/all-about/rugby). It says: \"River levels have risen at the Churchover river gauge as a result of heavy rainfall. Consequently, flooding (of property) remains. Flooding is affecting properties around Leicester Road in Rugby. We expect river levels to remain high until tomorrow afternoon, Saturday, 30/12/23. \"We are closely monitoring the situation. Our incident response staff are actively checking river levels and the weather forecast. Please activate any property flood protection products you may have, such as flood barriers and air brick covers.\" READ MORE: [Man on roof at petrol station during drama at M6 Corley Services](https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/local-news/man-roof-petrol-station-during-28357288) The flood warning area presently covers the River Swift at Rugby, including Brownsover Road, Swift Park and Leicester Road Retail Park. Standing water gathered dangerously on the [Coventry](https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/all-about/coventry) Road between Rugby and Church Lawford. The road underneath the railway bridge close to Church Lawford was said to have been impassable, so deep was the flooding. The Met Office will update its guidance for Rugby at 5pm on Saturday. Storm Gerrit battered the region and the entire country over the last 48 hours, causing a danger to life in parts of Scotland and bringing public transport to a standstill in places. Rugby is not the only [Warwickshire](https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/all-about/warwickshire) town to be affected by the aftermath. The ford in [Kenilworth](https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/all-about/kenilworth), where the B4103 Castle Road crosses Finham Brook, flooded, not for the first time in recent weeks. Water levels there are said to be remain high. Flood alerts have been issued across the county, covering the Gog Brook, near [Warwick](https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/all-about/warwick), the River Alne in Aston Cantlow, the River Arrow and River Alne at Alcester and Oversley Mill. Another alert applied to the River Alne at Bird in Hand, north of Henley-in-Arden, and the River Blythe at nearby Earlswood. Trains were not running between Whitlocks End station in [Solihull](https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/all-about/solihull) and [Stratford-upon-Avon](https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/all-about/stratford-upon-avon) station until about 9.45pm on Thursday (28) following flooding, National Rail said. Earlier, Stagecoach Midlands said flooding was affecting services between Coventry and Rugby, while the Environment Agency urged people living between Hampton Road and Lodge Crescent in Budbrooke, near Warwick, to take action.

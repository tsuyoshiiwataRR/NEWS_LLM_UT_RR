    "text": "This alert message is valid from noon, Thursday 28th December, 2023 and will be TERMINATED at 6 PM Thursday 28th December,\n2023 or sooner if conditions warrant.\nA flash-flood watch is issued when heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period of time (generally less than 6 hours) could result in flash flooding within the watch area. It does not mean that flooding will occur, but it is possible.\n**** Hazard Info ****\nA combination of light wind speeds and adequate daytime heating has generated some moderate to heavy showers across some central districts. These showers are forecast to spread across the island during the afternoon, and rainfall accumulations of 25.0 to 50.0 mm in moderate to heavy showers are likely. As a result, the BMS has issued a Flash-Flood Watch for Barbados.\nKey Message:\n-Runoff from higher elevations.\n-Soil erosion on exposed or scarred land surfaces.\n-Water settlements on roads and fields at the foot of hills and coastal roads.\n-Adjustments to water levels of existing water bodies (ponds etc.).\n-Objects or debris from higher elevations becoming embedded within fast moving water flows.\n-Delays on traffic routes with some roads becoming impassable in and out of minor towns.\n-Residents and visitors should also be aware that this alert level could elevate to red.\nFor more information specific to your area, please visit:-\nhttps://www.barbadosweather.org/weatherBarResp.php or our social media pages",

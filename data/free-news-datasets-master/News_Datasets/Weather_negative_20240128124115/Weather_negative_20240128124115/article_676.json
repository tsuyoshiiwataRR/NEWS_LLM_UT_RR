Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away.\nNearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said.\n[#HighSurf]‚Äì Watch when a rogue wave hits the beach at the end of Seward Ave in the City of Ventura. This occurred during the high surf advisory at high tide. Because of this wave eight people were transported to local hospitals. Currently the beaches are closed in Ventura County‚Ä¶ [pic.twitter.com/VlRlgRLhpn]\n‚Äî VCFD PIO (@VCFD_PIO)\n[December 29, 2023]\nHigh water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California‚Äôs beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast ‚Äì spanning from the U.S.-Mexico border to southern Oregon ‚Äì is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said.\nWaves as high as telephone poles ‚Äì about 40 feet ‚Äì could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected along the central coast.\nThe dangerous conditions pose an ‚Äúexceptional risk‚Äù of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said.\nThe spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby.\n‚ÄúLarge breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,‚Äù the National Weather Service warned.\nAt least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said.\nThe conditions have already caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast.\nCrews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about seven feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities.\nüö® Due to a high tidal surge, numerous closures are in place today. Pls exercise extreme caution near the ocean and stay safe. Here are some views from the Rio Del Mar Esplanade and Seacliff St. Beach. Remember to respect the closures and avoid these areas for your own safety.\n[pic.twitter.com/KpNHy4MNC5]\n‚Äî CHP Santa Cruz (@CHPscrz)\n[December 28, 2023]\nHoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution.\nIn central California‚Äôs Santa Cruz, the sheriff‚Äôs office\nissued an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, which included areas of Rio Del Mar, where seawater filled beachside roadways and pushed against some homes, CNN affiliate KION reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day.\nThe most extreme impacts were expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, the weather service in Los Angeles said Thursday.\nTempestuous waters are also battering Northern California, where the Bay Area could see waves of 28 to 33 feet, the weather service advised.\nA high wind alert is also in effect for the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected.\nRainfall is likely to stretch northward from the Bay Area throughout the day Friday before shifting south into the weekend.\nMassive waves attract surfers to Mavericks\nDespite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco.\nPro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having\nsome of the biggest waves in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported.\nLocal resident Ion Banner\ntold the affiliate that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty gnarly, it‚Äôs super big,‚Äù he said.\n‚ÄúThe waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,‚Äù said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. ‚ÄúIt was really big, I‚Äôd say 40-60 foot waves.‚Äù\nMavericks‚Äô jaw-dropping waves ‚Äì caused by unique underwater rock formations ‚Äì reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells.\nThe legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic ‚ÄúChasing Mavericks‚Äù about American surfer Jay Moriarity‚Äôs journey to surf Mavericks as a teen.\nOn Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco.\n‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs your turn, you just gotta go,‚Äù Blanco said. ‚ÄúWhen you see a big wave, you‚Äôre kinda scared but at the same time you‚Äôre feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.‚Äù\nCNN‚Äôs David Williams contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Bhubaneswar: IMD forecast on Thursday said dense fog would be very likely to continue in several districts during the next two to three days amid a slight rise trend in minimum temperature. The districts likely to witness this include Puri, Khurda, Nayagarh, Ganjam, Gajapati, Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur, among others. The office of Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) in the wake of IMD's warning sent its routine advisory to district collectors to take needful steps for restricted driving in their respective areas during morning hours. \\\"Police and transport officials of respective districts may take necessary steps for controlled plying of vehicles on highways during dense fog to avoid any road accident,\\\" reads the advisory from SRC office. H R Biswas, the regional head of IMD centre in the city said, “Prevailing wind pattern and availability of moisture favour for continue of shallow to moderate or dense fog in the state this week.” He said minimum temperature saw a rise by two to three degrees Celsius at several places in the state and there would be no large change in the prevailing trend of mercury level during the next three-four days. Dense fog reducing visibility to 50 meter or less was reported from towns like Rourkela, Cuttack, Phulbani, Nayagarh and Koraput.We also published the following articles recentlyIMD issues red warning for very dense fog todayThe weather department has issued a red alert for very dense fog in Delhi-NCR on Friday.

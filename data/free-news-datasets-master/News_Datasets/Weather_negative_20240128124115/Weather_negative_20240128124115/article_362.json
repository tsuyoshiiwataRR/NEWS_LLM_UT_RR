    "text": "Gusts of up to 75mph (120km/h) are expected to batter the coasts of southern England and Wales this weekend as other parts of the UK continue to recover from the ravages of Storm Gerrit.\nThe Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for high winds in the south-east, south-west, East Anglia and Wales from 11am on Saturday until 3am on Sunday, New Year’s Eve.\nSeparate yellow warnings were issued for sleet and snow in Scotland and rain in Northern Ireland on Saturday.\nNew Year’s Eve revellers have been urged to wrap up warm as conditions across many parts of the UK could feel close to freezing as clocks strike midnight.\nParts of the UK are still cleaning up after extreme weather wreaked havoc, including the deaths of three men whose 4x4 was submerged in a river in flood-hit North Yorkshire.\nAbout 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power and a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday.\nScottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north-east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers.\nIts operations director, Andy Smith, said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.”\nNational Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion in west Wales on Thursday after lightning struck.\n00:01:07\nRoofs blown off houses as Storm Gerrit brings high winds and floods to UK – video In Tameside, people were still coming to terms with damage caused by a freak tornado that brought down trees and badly damaged roofs.\nAbout 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge and the village of Carrbrook.\nHayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, said some of her neighbours’ houses were an “absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars.\nDamage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers said.\nScotRail said many lines had reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway, which suspended or cancelled services due to damage or system faults.\nThere is likely to be significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines, with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day.\nWeir gates opened at Marsh Lock in Henley-on-Thames to cope with rising water levels. Photograph: Geoffrey Swaine/Rex/Shutterstock In Wales, the aftermath of the severe weather will affect rail services until Monday.\nFerry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to the storm, with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the Channel.\nAir travel in and out of the UK was disrupted, with cancellations, but most services have returned to normal.\nThe Met Office said its Irish counterpart, Met Éireann, could name another storm – Storm Hank – as a “deep area of low pressure” pushes strong winds across the Republic of Ireland on Saturday.\nAlex Burkill, a Met Office meteorologist, said it would feel cold at night on New Year’s Eve and urged people to “wrap up quite warm” as there would be “a chilly feel to things as the clock strikes midnight”.\nExplore more on these topics UK weather England Scotland news\nReuse this content",

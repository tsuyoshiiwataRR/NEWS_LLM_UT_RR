    "text": "Friday, December 29: Residents of Central India may have to alter any outdoorsy plans they have made for the Near Year, for the region looks set to enter 2024 on a surprisingly wet note. As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), lower-level easterly winds blowing in from the Bay of Bengal will trigger the incursion of moisture over India’s east-central states. Accordingly, light rainfall has been forecast at isolated locations across Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh from this Sunday to next Tuesday, December 31 to January 2. Thunderstorm activity may also accompany the drizzling, due to which the IMD has placed yellow watches (meaning ‘be aware’ of the weather situation) over Madhya Pradesh’s northern districts. The advisories for Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh are yet to be updated. The wet weather will also bring warmer nights to Central India. While the minimum temperatures in the region have already been 1.6°C to 3°C higher than normal for this time of the year, they will further rise by 2-3°C during the next three to four days. Meanwhile, IMD observations from this morning indicate the presence of very dense fog in isolated pockets of Uttar Pradesh and shallow to moderate fog in isolated areas of West Madhya Pradesh. While cold and fog are normal meteorological features for Central India at this time of the year, rainfall isn’t. Since the start of this December, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have recorded excess rains worth 179% and 462%, despite receiving precipitation worth a mere 17.9 mm and 28.1 mm, respectively. Uttar Pradesh, meanwhile, has registered 5.9 mm rain, marking an excess of 22%. ** For weather and science updates on the go, download [The Weather Channel App](https://weather.onelink.me/2902176432/ca9eb560) (on Android and iOS store).

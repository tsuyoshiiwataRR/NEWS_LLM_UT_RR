    "text": "LIVE: IMD Red Alert As Dense Fog Blankets Delhi; Commuters Stranded With Trains Cancelled And Flights Delayed - Author : [Vivek Raj](/authors/vivek-raj) - Updated: Fri, 29 Dec 2023 10:34 AM (IST) Breaking News LIVE Updates: The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for Delhi on Friday, accompanied by an orange alert for December 30 and a yellow alert for the year-end and New Year's Eve. The capital, along with North India, is experiencing mist and dense fog, leading to significant travel disruptions and a surge in road accidents. The adverse weather conditions have resulted in the cancellation of several trains and delays in numerous flights. The region is advised to exercise caution due to reduced visibility and challenging travel conditions. India recorded 702 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, pushing the total active cases to 4,097, as per the latest health ministry data. Delhi has ordered genome sequencing for all positive cases to identify instances of the JN.1 subvariant. While the rising cases have raised concerns, experts are urging the public not to panic, and that the situation is being closely monitored. In a historic development, a tripartite agreement is anticipated to be finalised today between the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), the Central Government, and the State Government. The primary goal of this agreement is to establish enduring peace in the northeastern state. The signing ceremony, scheduled to include Home Minister Amit Shah, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, and more than a dozen leaders from the pro-talk faction of ULFA, marks a significant step towards fostering stability in the region. - 10:34 AM, 29 Dec 2023 Shiv Sena Asserts Dominance In INDIA Alliance Seat Sharing Discussions In a statement on seat-sharing within the INDIA alliance, Shiv Sena Member of Parliament Sanjay Raut remarked, \"This is Maharashtra, and Shiv Sena is the biggest party here.

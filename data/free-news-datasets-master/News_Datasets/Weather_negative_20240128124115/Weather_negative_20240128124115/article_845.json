    "text": "Videos out of Ventura, California captured the moment a rogue wave jumped over a seawall Thursday, sweeping aside the cars and people in its path. Ventura isn't the only place experiencing tumultuous coasts. The National Weather Service has issued surf and flooding advisories along the California coast and in Hawaii.\nA video from Ventura officials opens on a seemingly tranquil scene. People are scattered along the seawall, leaning against it and watching the rolling waves in the distance.\nSuddenly, people start to back away from the wall moments before a wave spikes up in front of them. As it crashes down into the street, many of the people running get their feet knocked out from under them and a truck seems to skip forward in the waves.\nAnother angle captured by Facebook user Colin Hoag shows the waves chasing him down the street.\nOfficials urged people to avoid the ocean. High surf is expected through Saturday.\nRogue waves: A rogue wave caused a cruise ship tragedy.

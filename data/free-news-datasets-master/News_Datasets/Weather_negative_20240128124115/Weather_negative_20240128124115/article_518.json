    "text": "The last few days of 2023 are forecast to be unsettled, with strong winds, rain and even snow featuring in parts of the UK. Yellow warnings for wind and rain have been been issued for a large area of Wales on Saturday and Sunday.\nThe Met Office says that an area of low pressure will push in from the west on Saturday and will be the most dominant feature in the forecast leading up to the new year. During the early hours of Saturday morning a potentially deep area of low pressure will move in from the west to affect Ireland and western parts of the UK.\nAs the system moves eastwards, the boundary between the area of low pressure and the relatively colder conditions further north and east will lead to a band of transient snow across some of the high ground of northern England and Scotland. It is possible this snow could fall to lower levels for a brief period of time across Scotland.\nREAD MORE: Storm Gerrit leaves flooding and destruction around UK\nREAD MORE: Cardiff council scraps Christmas tree collection service\nThe yellow warning for wind in Wales is in place from 11am on Saturday (December 30) until 3pm on Sunday (December 31).\nIt states: \"An active cold front will move east across England and Wales during Saturday and into Sunday and will be characterised by strong winds and some heavy rain. Gusts of 45-50 mph widely, but squally near the cold front with some gusts around 60 mph, whilst the strongest gusts are likely near coasts in the west and south, with 65-75mph in places.\"\nThe challenging conditions brought by Storm Gerrit have now eased after Wales was battered by winds of up to 88mph and supercell thunderstorm that resulted in a tornado hitting Greater Manchester, and the weekend looks set to bring another spell of wet and windy weather .\nThe areas covered by the wind warning are mainly coastal and include:\nBlaenau Gwent Bridgend Caerphilly Cardiff Carmarthenshire Ceredigion Conwy Gwynedd Isle of Anglesey Merthyr Tydfil Monmouthshire Neath Port Talbot Newport Pembrokeshire Powys Rhondda Cynon Taf Swansea Torfaen Vale of Glamorgan The warning for rain is in place from 10am to 6pm on Saturday (December 30). It says: \"An active frontal zone will move east across Wales during Saturday bringing a spell of heavy rain and strong winds. 20-30 mm of rain falling widely and as much as 40-50 mm in the northwest.\"\nThe areas covered by this warning are:\nBlaenau Gwent Bridgend Caerphilly Cardiff Carmarthenshire Ceredigion Conwy Gwynedd Isle of Anglesey Merthyr Tydfil Monmouthshire Neath Port Talbot Newport Pembrokeshire Powys Rhondda Cynon Taf Swansea Torfaen Vale of Glamorgan. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale says: \"This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”\nOn Friday morning, Natural Resources Wales had 15 flood alerts in place across the country.\nBBC Weather says: \"Another stormy spell of weather on the cards for the final few days of 2023. A developing area of low pressure in the Atlantic will bring gales, heavy rain and hill snow in the north. Keep an eye on the latest forecast and be prepared for some travel disruption this weekend.\"\nLooking further ahead into 2024, there is low forecast confidence. Met Office deputy chief forecaster Nick Silkstone said: “Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.”\n ",

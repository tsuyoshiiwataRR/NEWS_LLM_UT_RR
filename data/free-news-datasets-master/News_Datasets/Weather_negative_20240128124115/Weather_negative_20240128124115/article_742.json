    "text": "J&KIMD forecasts isolated fog in JK; Dense fog leads to significant disruptions in air, train traffic By KNS Posted on Dec 29, 2023 | Updated on Dec 29, 2023 Share Tweet Share Ishtiyaq Ahmad Srinagar, Dec 29 (KNS): The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a weather forecast indicating the likelihood of fog at isolated places over Jammu and Kashmir in the coming days. The advisory comes as part of the routine weather updates provided by the IMD to keep citizens and authorities informed on potential weather-related disruptions. According to the latest forecast, certain areas in Jammu and Kashmir are expected to experience foggy conditions, impacting visibility and posing potential challenges for commuters and travelers. News agency KNS reported that the IMD has urged residents, as well as those planning to travel through the region, to exercise caution and stay updated on the evolving weather conditions. Fog can significantly affect transportation, including road and air travel, as reduced visibility may lead to delays and disruptions. The IMD has advised travelers to check for real-time updates from official weather sources, follow traffic advisories, and take necessary precautions while navigating through fog-prone areas. The meteorological department uses advanced technology and data analysis to provide accurate and timely weather forecasts, enabling individuals and authorities to prepare for adverse conditions. In light of the fog alert for Jammu and Kashmir, local authorities are expected to take necessary measures to mitigate potential challenges and ensure the safety of the public. The IMD regularly monitors and analyzes atmospheric conditions to provide forecasts and warnings for various weather phenomena, including fog, rain, and snow. The information is crucial for planning and decision-making, especially in regions prone to specific weather patterns. As residents and travelers in Jammu and Kashmir brace for possible foggy conditions, it is recommended to stay tuned to official weather updates and follow safety guidelines issued by local authorities. The IMD's efforts in providing accurate and timely forecasts contribute to enhancing preparedness and reducing the impact of adverse weather events on the community. Meanwhile dense fog wreaked havoc on air, train, and vehicular traffic in the northern region today, leading to the cancellation of six flights at Jammu airport. Train schedules were severely impacted, with Malwa Express arriving 12 hours late, Humsafar Express delayed by 13 hours, and Madras Express facing an 11-hour delay at Jammu Railway Station. Jammu experienced a significant drop in temperature; registering 5 degrees Celsius lower than the previous day. Drivers coped with the challenging conditions by using dippers and fog lamps, while some parked their vehicles on the roadside, awaiting improved visibility. A slight improvement in weather conditions was observed only after 11 am. The Meteorological Department reported that Jammu is expected to witness dry weather with dense fog for the next four days. Additionally, there is a forecast for light rain and snow in certain areas of Jammu and Kashmir on January 3-4. Dense fog significantly impacted air traffic in Jammu, resulting in the cancellation of six out of 15 scheduled flights, with one flight being diverted. Of the flights that did land, most were delayed and rescheduled. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Northern Railway reported delays of 2 to 13 hours for many trains arriving at Jammu Station today.

The news ticker.\nUpdate from December 29, 14:43 p.m.: \"We have a very, very tense situation,\" said Lower Saxony's Interior Minister Daniela Behrens (SPD) on Deutschlandfunk. The flood situation remains critical. Almost all of Lower Saxony is under water. The approximately 100,000 personnel from the fire brigade and the Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW), among others, are therefore deployed everywhere.\nThere is \"really no easing in sight,\" added the SPD politician. According to the weather forecast, there will be more rain in the next few days, as well as storms. This does not ease the situation, but \"exacerbates it at one point or another\".\nContinuous rain could exacerbate flood situation Update from December 29, 12:20 p.m.: Thousands of emergency workers are still fighting against the floods in numerous regions in Germany, and the next water is already on the horizon. As the German Weather Service published on Friday, rain must be expected in the coming days. Meanwhile, in the Serengeti Park, keepers and emergency services are fighting against time: numerous animals are trapped by the water.\n\"There will be a good swing until Saturday, but it will no longer rain in such large quantities,\" said meteorologist Christian Herold from the DWD on Friday morning in Offenbach. After that, it tones down a bit. According to this, the north of North Rhine-Westphalia in particular must be prepared for the most rainfall. According to the meteorologist, showers are predicted in particular from the Bergisches Land to the Sauerland and north of it from the Weser Uplands to the Harz Mountains. \"In this area, 15 to 20 liters per square meter are expected until Saturday, in reservoirs up to 30 liters per square meter.\" The Harz will be particularly affected. Locally, even higher quantities could be achieved there.\nBut Lower Saxony can't breathe a sigh of relief either: In the north, in the Bremen and Hamburg area, the meteorologist expects less precipitation. \"There are more isolated showers moving through. Maybe there will be short thunderstorms.\" In Saxony, according to Herold, precipitation is limited to the region north of Dresden. \"But these are just very isolated showers.\"\nFlood situation in Germany remains tense: DWD makes threatening rain forecast Original report from 29 December : Munich/Dresden – Tension still prevails in numerous regions in Germany, and rain announced by the DWD could even further exacerbate the situation on the ground. Emergency services are already reporting soaked dikes, and in Saxony-Anhalt a dike has now even been opened in a controlled manner. Numerous people have already had to leave their homes, and others are preparing for an imminent evacuation. The situation in Lower Saxony remains particularly tense. Emergency services had to evacuate the first animals from the Serengeti Park on Thursday.\nMy news Thief fills 189 liters in canister reading\nDischarged water from reservoir threatens places in Thuringia\nLake in Baden-Württemberg is the largest in the country – it is often overlookedread\nThe oldest butcher's shop in Germany comes from Baden-Württemberg read\nJetstream is heading for Germany: Current weather forecast makes people sit up and take noticeread\nThese outlet centers in Baden-Wurttemberg areRead more\nFlood situation in Germany remains tense: DWD announces new rain For the coming days, the German Weather Service announces a lot of rain, especially in the already severely affected flood areas, the situation could come to a head. In the reservoirs of the Bergisches Land and the Siegerland in North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the Harz Mountains, continuous rain must be expected from Friday morning until the night to Saturday. Up to 40 liters per square meter could fall within 24 hours.\nTension also continues to prevail on the border between Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt. In order to avert the risk of flooding there, a dike of the river Helme has been opened in a controlled manner. The water is now flowing onto fields, the Kyffhäuserkreis district announced on Friday night. The opening was necessary because water had been deliberately drained from the overloaded Kelbra reservoir for several days and the Helmen was carrying a lot of water as a result. According to the district, firefighters have laid around 4,6000 sandbags since Thursday to protect the small town of Mönchpfiffel-Nikolausrieth and raise the dikes.\nLower Saxony continues to be severely affected by floods – evacuations prepared In Lower Saxony, areas along the rivers Aller, Leine and Weser in the southern and central parts of the state are affected. There, the situation worsened further on Thursday. The dikes were no longer able to withstand the masses of water everywhere. Thousands of relief workers are deployed across the country. Evacuations were prepared in some places. In the municipality of Langlingen in the district of Celle, about 120 people left their houses and apartments as a precaution on Friday night. On Friday morning, the state government wants to give an update on the flood situation at a press conference.\nThe Weser is flooded in the district of Nienburg/Weser. The situation remains tense. © Moritz Frankenberg/dpa\nPrime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) said on Thursday that there had never been a flood of this magnitude before. \"Experts have long warned that the increasing frequency of weather extremes is linked to climate change,\" he said. According to the Ministry of the Interior, a so-called extraordinary event was detected in six districts as well as the city of Oldenburg. With this measure, for example, counties can more easily access auxiliary staff.\nFlood situation is also causing problems for Bremen – numerous residents have left their homes There is also no all-clear yet around Bremen. According to the authorities on Thursday evening, numerous houses along the Wümme in the Katrepel area are surrounded by water and without electricity. Most of the residents have left this area. In the district of Timmersloh, the water is standing on the dikes. Roads and fields are flooded. According to the information provided by the Interior Ministry, measures to secure the dike have already had to be carried out several times.\nFlood situation: No all-clear yet in Dresden either On the Elbe in Dresden, rising water levels are expected. Early Thursday afternoon, 5.92 meters were measured. This was still just below the six-metre mark from which the second-highest alert level 3 would apply. The state flood control center expected this limit to be exceeded on Friday morning - but only very slightly with a maximum of 6.01 meters. A normal water level of 2.00 meters in the Elbe in the state capital is normal.\nThe hydrologists expected a decrease in the Elbe flood water from Friday, as a spokesman for the State Office for the Environment, Agriculture and Geology said. Only locally light rain is expected, in the Czech catchment area of the Elbe neither precipitation nor snowmelt until Friday.\nDownstream in Magdeburg and Schönebeck in Saxony-Anhalt, the State Agency for Flood Protection and Water Management opened the Pretzien weir on Thursday. This means that about a third of the Elbe's water is channelled past the two cities through a flood channel and across meadows and fields before flowing back into the Elbe.",

    "text": "By\n<a href=\"https://www.gbnews.com/authors/george-bunn\">George Bunn\n</a>\nPublished: 29/12/2023- 15:52\nDon't Miss\nMost Read\nTrending on GB News\nThe Met Office has issued six weather warnings as 2023 is set to end with a period of unsettled weather.\nThere are three warnings in place for rain and snow in Scotland including in Aberdeen, Inverness and Dundee.\nWarnings across Scotland are in place from 8am tomorrow and are expected to last all through the day.\nMeanwhile, there are yellow warnings for rain for the majority of Wales and Northern Ireland. A yellow warning for wind is in place through all of Saturday across the majority of the English south coast and in East Anglia.\nThe weather warnings for the UK\nMet Office\nThe warning for wind is expected to carry on into the early hours of New Year's Eve on Sunday.\nIt is also set to remain colder in Scotland, where overnight temperatures could drop to -10°C across the Grampians.\nMet Office chief forecaster Andy Page said: \"Parts of the higher ground of Scotland may see temporary snow accumulations of 5-10cm, while up to 25mm of rain is expected in Wales, Northern Ireland and lower levels in Scotland.\n\"Across Wales and southern England wind gusts of 45-50mph are likely to be quite widespread, while gusts of 65-75mph are possible in the most exposed coastal areas.\"\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS\nA roofless house following a tornado on December 28, 2023 in Stalybridge, England\nGetty\nIt comes as many may be concerned about travel across the country for New Year's Eve celebrations to bring in 2024.\nRAC spokesman Rod Dennis said: “Storm Gerrit might have passed but, with another round of distinctly unsettled weather moving in, drivers are going to once again need to be ready to cope with difficult driving conditions in the run up to the new year.\n\"The most important thing they should do is reduce their speeds, especially on exposed and upland roads, and to always keep a firm hold of the steering wheel to avoid getting buffeted off course by the gusty winds.\n\"Driving slower also gives motorists more time to react to changing conditions up ahead and this is particularly important during periods of very heavy rainfall which can quickly reduce vehicles’ grip on the road and make driving hazardous.\"\nIt is set to turn cloudier in the southwest with rain on Tuesday.\nLooking further ahead into 2024, there is a forecast for colder temperatures.\nMet Office deputy chief forecaster Nick Silkstone said: \"Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.\"",

In fact, the two calls came in so close together it impacted how fast first responders were able to get to County Road 25 where a brick house was on fire. The home on County Road 25 suffered heavy damage, according to first responders. When they arrived the fire had already spread to other parts of the home, beyond the kitchen where the flames started. Heavy smoke could be seen from around the area. No other information was immediately available.

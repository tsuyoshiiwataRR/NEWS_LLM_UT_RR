    "text": "The NWS hit back after the governor said the organization did not adequately predict the flooding brought by last week's winter stormThe state is continuing its recovery effort in the aftermath of last Monday's severe storm\nMaine’s Democrat Governor Janet Mills has been branded a liar by the National Weather Service after claiming its forecasters didn’t warn her about a historic storm.\nThe esteemed federal agency lashed Mills after she was slammed for failing to adequately warn locals that up to half a foot of rain would fall on December 18, causing huge floods and leaving 400,000 without power.\nMills put her foot in it last Wednesday while touring flood-battered Kennebec County, saying: ‘The National Weather Service did not predict five or six inches of rain in any community in Maine.’\nBut a NWS spokesman said the 75 year-old lawmaker was talking nonsense, insisting state and local officials had been briefed about the impending inundation on December 15.\nAnd on Sunday the 17th – the day before the storm – the weather service met with state officials to further brief them on expected flooding, winds, and impact to the state’s coast line.\nGovernor Mills deflected blame for Maine’s lack of preparedness for the recent storm to the National Weather Service. pic.twitter.com/egh14zozHl\n— The Maine Wire (@TheMaineWire) December 20, 2023\nGovernor Janet Mills is catching flack for saying the National Weather Service did not adequately predict the severe dimensions of the winter storm that hit Maine last week\nCars are flooded in a parking lot at the Hathaway Creative Center alongside the Kennebec River, Tuesday, Dec. 19, 2023, in Waterville, Maine\nMills and her office have not yet responded to the NWS’s claims that she is a liar.\nImages of the storm’s aftermath show cars hanging off extremely damaged roads, intense, murky floodwaters that swept other vehicles away, collapsed construction sites, and downed trees and powerlines.\nThe storm, which Mills called ‘an extraordinary event,’ barreled into the Northeast on Monday, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of people, forcing flight cancellations, and killing at least four people.\nWind gusts reaches nearly 70 miles per hour, which Mills also said the National Weather Service did not predict.\n‘The National Weather Service did not predict 68-70 mile an hour winds in any area of Maine,’ she said. ‘It was an extraordinary event.’\nIn fact, the NWS does seem to have predicted possible winds of 65-70 miles per hour at the same time that they predicted four-to-six inches of rain.\nEarlier this week, Mills announced the launch of an online resource for Maine residents who were hit hard by the flood and other storm damage.\nThe Maine Flood Resources and Assistance Hub was launched on Tuesday. According to the governor’s office, it will aggregate ‘information, resources, and assistance’ for those impacted by the storm.\nPropane tanks set free by flood waters discharge gas as they float on the Kennebec River through Augusta, Maine, Tuesday, Dec. 19, 2023\nNathan Sennett and Tori Grasse retrieve furniture from a flooded patio near the Kennebec River, Tuesday, Dec. 19, 2023, in Hallowell, Maine\nA car floats in a flooded parking lot at the Hathaway Creative Center alongside the Kennebec River in Waterville, Maine\nA man observes the flooded Kennebec River on December 19 in Maine\nThe announcement of the hub arrived after civil states of emergency were declared in 14 of 16 counties in Maine.\nThe severity of the storm’s damage prompted Mills to request a Major Disaster Declaration from President Joe Biden, which will allow federal resources to supplement the recovery efforts led by the state.\n‘In the wake of last week’s storm, my Administration has launched the Maine Flood Resources and Assistance Hub to help Maine people with questions they may have about property damage, road safety, tree removal, and more,’ Mills said in the news release about the resource hub.\n‘We will update this website as more information becomes available as part of our effort to do all we can to support the swiftest possible recovery of Maine communities.’\nThe governor also announced Tuesday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved the Maine Emergency Management Agency’s request to begin an preliminary damage assessment, which is the first formal step toward request the aforementioned Major Disaster Declaration.",

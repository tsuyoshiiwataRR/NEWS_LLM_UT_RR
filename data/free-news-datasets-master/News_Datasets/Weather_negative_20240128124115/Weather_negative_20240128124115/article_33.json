    "text": "EAST BRAINERD, Tenn. — [Tornadoes struck middle Tennessee earlier this month](https://newschannel9.com/news/local/2023-tennessee-tornadoes-deadly-lives-lost-fourth-clarksville-tornado-victim-dies-from-injuries-local-reports-say-montgomery-county-middle-tn), killing seven people and and injuring many others. Those tornadoes also damaged buildings and knocked out power for thousands of people. Those storms, as well as others in our area, have left residents looking for ways to stay safe. Thursday we spoke to someone who has experienced disaster first hand about what you can add to your home to protect yourself and your family. So that when severe weather strikes, you'll be prepared. Building a storm shelter came as a no-brainer for East Brainerd Resident Michael Herston. In 2020 his home was considered a “total devastation” from [ the Easter tornados.](https://newschannel9.com/news/local/severe-weather-causes-major-local-damage-late-sunday-night) \"For me, it's not even an option. Whatever the costs, that's safety and security. That's first for us,\" says Herston. He brought in a whole team of structural engineers and designers to provide the safest and sturdiest structure for his family. “I mean, it's your life. It's your life or a few 1,000 bucks. I'm going to spend the money on saving a life,\" Herston says. But Chattanooga Realtor Dawn O'Neil says it's a costly addition. \"With the housing market, the way we have it, it's just hard to justify putting another $10,000 into a storm shelter,\" says O'Neil. But it's not the only way. She says there are more convenient options that home builders are including other than a concrete shelter. \"A lot of builders put doors underneath staircases, things like that. That is great for storage, but it's also great for a place to go if you don't have a basement,\" O'Neil says. Just a few weeks ago, tornadoes raged through Middle Tennessee, bringing storm shelters back to top of mind for homeowners in Chattanooga. “Especially with the tornadoes that just happened and being so close in proximity, I think that's something that people are aware of,\" says O'Neil. But the building of storm shelters hits closer to home. “In 2020 when the storms came to Holly Hills, I think that was something that people, when they were looking at homes, were interested in and it was kind of in the forefront of their mind,\" O'Neil says. Including homeowner Michael Herston. \"Going forward, I'll never have a house again that doesn't have one,\" Herston says. Data from the National Weather Service shows that the average yearly tornado total since 1950 has been 19 per year. However, the average yearly total since 1995 is higher, reaching 32 tornadoes per year on average.",

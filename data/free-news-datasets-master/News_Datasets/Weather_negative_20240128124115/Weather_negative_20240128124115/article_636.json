    "text": "The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning across Somerset ahead of the New Year's weekend. The forecaster warns of potential travel delays and possible power cuts as the South West is once again hit with powerful winds just days after Storm Gerrit blew down trees and closed road bridges. The yellow wind warning is in place from 11am on Saturday, December 30 until 3am on New Year's Eve and includes the whole of the West Country, the south England coast, and parts of western Wales. The Met Office says: \"A spell of strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services.\" The forecaster adds: \"An active cold front will move east across England and Wales during Saturday and into Sunday and will be characterised by strong winds and some heavy rain. Gusts of 45-50 mph widely, but squally near the cold front with some gusts around 60 mph, whilst the strongest gusts are likely near coasts in the west and south, with 65-75 mph in places.\" [Remembering Somerset's long lost BHS stores and what they became](https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/remembering-somersets-long-lost-bhs-8869006) [We try the Somerset farm shop café that cannot stop winning awards](https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/try-somerset-farm-shop-cafe-6982806) Heavy rain is also forecast across the South West during the New Year's weekend, with a large deluge expected to move up from the South West on January 1. However, this is expected to be less disruptive than the downpours brought by Storm Gerrit. Steven Ramsdale is a Met Office Chief Forecaster. He said: “This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.” This fresh batch of strong winds comes just days after Storm Gerrit caused significant disruption across the country. Trees and scaffolding were blown down in the South West, and the two River Severn bridges were closed for a large portion of Wednesday, December 27 following a serious seven-vehicle crash and powerful wind gusts. In Manchester, the storm even created what has been described as a 'localised tornado', which swept through the city, damaging around 100 homes in the process. Forecasters expect the unsettled conditions to continue into the new year. Silkstone, Met Office Deputy Chief Forecaster, aid: “Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.” What to Expect - Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely - It’s likely that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and/or large waves - Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer - Some short term loss of power and other services is possible - Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely",

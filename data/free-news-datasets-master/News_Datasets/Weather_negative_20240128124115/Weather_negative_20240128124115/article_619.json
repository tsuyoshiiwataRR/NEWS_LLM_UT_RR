    "text": "Advice has been issued after cars trying to cross floodwater have become stuck after drivers have ignored signs, while some properties have also been flooded amid the aftermath of Storm Gerrit.\nOn Wednesday (December 27) and Thursday (December 28), North Yorkshire and the North East were hit by heavy rain and high winds - with a yellow weather warning issued on Wednesday.\nAcross the two regions, travel issues on roads, rail and planes were reported, while some houses were left without power.\nOn Wednesday, the A1(M) between Catterick and Scotch Corner was closed for several hours due to heavy rain, while North Yorkshire County Council closed the A684, Morton Flatts between Morton-on-Swale bridge and Station Road, Scruton, alongside ten other roads in the region.\nDespite road closures in place, North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue has reported that several cars have tried to drive through floodwater.\nOn Thursday (December 28), an incident saw fire crews attend Kirby Wiske, near Thirsk, at around 2.40pm, which saw a car become stuck in flood water with two occupants in the vehicle.\nKirby Wiske (Image: CONTRIBUTOR)\nCrews located the vehicle in approximately one foot of water. Crews assisted two occupants to walk from the vehicle to dry land.\nThis morning (December 29), at 6.20am, fire crews from Easingwold attended an incident on Thornton Bridge in Boroughbridge, which saw firefighters help a man to safety after his car had become stuck in floodwater.\nMeanwhile, several properties in the region were flooded during the last three days of changeable weather.\nOn Thursday (December 28), fire crews attended a house on High Lane in Buttersett, near Hawes, where a fire crew from Hawes responded to a report of flooding in a residential property.\nCrews diverted water away from the property and then attempted to unblock drains to assist in averting the flooding.\nIn the aftermath of the floodwater, North Yorkshire Police has issued some advice to drivers about navigating roads in challenging conditions.",

    "text": "By Jo Nova\nAustralians are angry the BOM didn’t see the flooding rains coming\nWorse, we’re betting the nation on the BOM’s ability to predict the climate.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) tells Australians that record breaking extremes are getting worse because of our cars and our air-conditioners (that’s “\nThe State of the Climate“). But when the BOM can’t predict record breaking rain a month in advance, or even the day before, we know the BOM doesn’t understand what drives the climate.\nSomehow the BOM expect Australians to spend trillions and rearrange their economy based on their fifty year prophesies, but not to mind when “this summer” goes right off the rails.\nBack in September the BOM issued its El Nino alert, and Australians were told it would be a\n hot and dry and to prepare for a summer of bushfires. Farmer sold their lambs, and adjusted harvest accordingly.\nThis was the BOM solemn prediction in late October, for the very next month of rainfall\nAcross most of Australia the\nodds were only 20-40% of getting average rain.\nInstead this is what happened:\nAnd in December most of the country was predicted to have a fifty fifty chance of getting “average” rain.\nBut the real weather gods had another idea, and all the places under any shades of green below got somewhere from 100% to 300% of the average rainfall. The indigo and purple zones got even more.\nThis was a savage downpour — seven feet of rain in five days fell at one location:\nNo fewer than 12 locations across far north Queensland posted record rainfall totals.\nSome areas received a year’s rainfall in a single day, isolating towns, closing highways and leaving hundreds stranded by surging floodwaters. Black Mountain near Cooktown recorded a cumulative 2189mm over the five days, while Mossman South, an hour northwest of Cairns, had 1935mm.\nAs the Mayor of Douglas Shire said:\n“If this is so record-breaking, how did no one know this was going to happen … we need to have forecasts closer to what is going on.”\nThe BOM suddenly wants to absolve itself of liability\nPeople have noticed there is now a mandatory check box forcing users to agree to a legal disclaimer clearing the BOM of all liability:\nUsers of the BOM app now have to agree to a 699-word “terms and conditions” statement that includes “information at this app … may not be accurate, current or complete”.\n“To the maximum extent permitted by law, the bureau excludes any liability that may arise in connection with the BOM Weather app or any information or material presented therein or your access to or use of any of the same,’’ the bureau says in a “terms and conditions” statement that appears when a user attempts to download its app. —\nMackenzie Scott, The Australian\nThey know they are in trouble.\nI say the BOM can have immunity the same day Australians can also tick a box excluding ourselves from any and all costs, imposts and taxes related to any BOM predictions.\nThe Australian editors gives the BOM an escape valve it doesn’t deserve:\nTo be fair to the BOM, a hysterical and ill-informed media has allowed climate alarmism to infect reporting of what should be routine weather events.\nFor thirty years the Australian media has made hyperbolic scare stories about the weather while the BOM tacitly stood by and smiled. Where were they as the tenets of science were trashed, and critics were called “climate deniers”? If the BOM are victims of this hyperbole now, they reap what they sowed.\nThe BOM raised the stakes, and they don’t get to weasel out by saying\n“we used the best science” as if the best science wasn’t riddled with holes. If the science is good enough to throw away trillions of dollars, then the worst failures need a truckload of explanation.\nPredicting the weather is hard. We could forgive the BOM for getting a complex immature science wrong, but not when they also tell us it’s just simple physics, they’re absolutely sure, and there is no doubt they’re wrong (give us your money!).",

    "text": "The Met Office has issued a 16-hour yellow weather warning for wind across Kent and the south of England for the New Year weekend with gusts of 50mph widely forecast and speeds of up to 75mph in some southern coastal areas. The alert comes into force from 11am (December 30) and means “strong and gusty” winds are expected until 3am on Sunday (December 31). The alert covers the whole of the county as a strong spell of wind moves east across England and Wales. The forecaster has warned of travel disruption and possible short-term losses of power or services. It said some delays are likely on road, rail, air, and ferry transport and that journeys on buses and trains will “probably” take longer. “Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely,” The Met Office continued.

Some short-term loss of power and other services is possible.” Gusts of 45 to 50 mph are widely forecast but conditions will be squally near the cold front bringing the weather and gusts may hit 60mph. Stronger gusts of up to 75mph are “likely near coasts in the west and south”. Drivers and those looking to travel have been advised to check conditions and timetables before they leave to avoid delays.

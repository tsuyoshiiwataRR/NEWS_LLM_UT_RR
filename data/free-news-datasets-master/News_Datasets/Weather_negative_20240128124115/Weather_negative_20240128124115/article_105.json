    "text": "Delhi is expected to see very dense fog on Friday and Saturday, with the minimum temperature expected to hover around seven to eight degrees Celsius, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said Thursday. Schools in Noida and Greater Noida will remain shut on Friday and Saturday, owing to the fog and dip in temperature. Over the past few days, dense fog has engulfed the city, especially in the mornings. A dense fog cover is expected in the morning and at night in many parts of Punjab, Haryana, [Chandigarh](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/chandigarh/), [Delhi](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/) and some parts of Uttar Pradesh. An improvement is expected starting Sunday, officials said. In an advisory for dense fog, the department has asked drivers to use fog lights and travellers to stay updated on the schedules of airlines, railways and state transport. Reduced visibility also hit air and rail services in the region, with 22 Delhi-bound trains delayed on Thursday. Several flights from and to the Indira Gandhi International Airport were also hit. “Less than 30 metres of visibility was recorded in Patiala, Ambala, Chandigarh Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Palam, Bareilly, [Lucknow](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/lucknow/), Varanasi and Gwalior,” it said. Visibility in the city during non-fog months is above 1,500 metres. On Thursday morning, it was reduced to 50 metres at Safdarjung and to 25 metres at Palam. While the veil lifted during the day, the visibility started dropping below 500 metres again in the evening. Because of the fog cover, the minimum temperatures have also been above normal over the past two-three days. On Thursday, the minimum temperature was recorded as 8.4 degrees Celsius, a degree above normal. The maximum also remained a degree above normal at 21.4 degrees Celsius. The relative humidity, which is directly proportional to the probability of fog formation, at 5.30 pm was 82 per cent in Delhi. The AQI, meanwhile, has been improving after hitting the severe category earlier this week and was recorded as 358 — in the very poor range. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.",

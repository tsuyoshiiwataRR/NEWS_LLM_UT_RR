    "text": "A freak weather event which tore through a Wexford house 'like a train' has left sheet metal and debris scattered across fields and ditches up to a kilometre away.\nA severe wind during Storm Gerrit which locals in the village of Duncormick in South Wexford described as being like a tornado, ripped through the home in the early hours of Thursday morning.\nLocal Aontu Cllr. Jim Codd, was at the scene at first light and said the damage caused was 'colossal'.\nREAD MORE:\nIreland New Year’s weather misery as Met Eireann issues multiple warnings for fierce double blast\n'I can only think it was a tornado because it came after the winds which raged all night and only one house was hit,' he said.\n'It's quite astonishing to see the amount of damage done to the house, the family described it to me as 'like a train went through the house'.\n'As I drove up here I saw sheets of metal lying in the ditches half a mile away from the property, there was debris scattered across the fields,' he added.\n'Thankfully despite part of the roof being blown off, the family were unhurt by the storm and are focused on repairing the damage as best they can lest further adverse weather hit South Wexford.\n'While a tarpaulin has been erected to cover the holes in the roof, the sheds and buildings in the back yard have been 'completely flattened' with parts of them unlikely to ever be recovered,' he said.\nRemarkably, the house in Woodgraigue, Duncormick, was the only one impacted by the weather event, with neighbouring properties escaping completely unscathed.\n'No other house in the area was touched, the one across the road, not 300 metres away, avoided it completely,' confirmed Cllr. Codd.\nA\nGoFundMe page has been set up to help with the associated costs of repairing the house.\nJoin the Irish Mirror’s breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click\nthis link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

    "text": "Strong winds could again stop New Year firework shows\nStrong winds could cause problems for the organisers of fireworks displays on December 31, weather forecasters say.\nLast year a number of shows, including the spectacular on the Erasmus bridge in Rotterdam, were scrapped because the winds would have made them too dangerous.\nA spokesman for the organisers of the big shows in Amsterdam and Rotterdam said they would be cancelled if the wind was continually above wind speed 5, or a fresh breeze.\nThe light and laser shows organised for both Amsterdam and The Hague will not be affected.\nThe KNMI weather bureau is forecasting southerly winds of between 4 and 5 for the weekend, with some sunshine on Saturday but rain and temperatures of 9° to 11° the rest of the week.\nThank you for donating to DutchNews.nl.\nWe could not provide the Dutch News service, and keep it free of charge, without the generous support of our readers.

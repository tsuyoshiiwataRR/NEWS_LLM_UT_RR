Pictured: Emergency services at the scene\nEmergency services scrambled to the scene near Glaisdale at 11:48am today following reports of a serious incident involving a vehicle\nHe and two others used tractors to pull the 4×4 on to the riverbank, he said.\nMr Ford said: ‘There was a ford they were going over and they were swept down 400 yards.\n‘They were part of an off-road club.\n‘I went down with my tractor. There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up.\n‘You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water.\n‘I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.’\nA 4×4 was recovered from the river by the fire service just after 3pm and the three men found inside had died, North Yorkshire Police said.\nThree men inside the 4×4 died while another man who attempted to help them was pulled to safety from the river at around 12:10pm.

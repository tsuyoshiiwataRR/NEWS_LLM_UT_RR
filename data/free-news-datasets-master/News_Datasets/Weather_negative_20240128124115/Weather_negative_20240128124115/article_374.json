Low pleasure areas are set to push in from the west on Saturday as conditions brought by Storm Gerrit continue to ease towards Hogmanay.

A few showers across Argyll and along the coast, these wintry on hills. Cold. Maximum temperature 6 °C. Saturday to Monday: Dry start but outbreaks of rain and snow spreading north for a time.

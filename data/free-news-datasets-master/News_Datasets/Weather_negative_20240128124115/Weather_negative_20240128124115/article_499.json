    "text": "Five Lincolnshire [flood alerts](https://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/all-about/weather) are in place with river levels expected to remain high over the next few days. The challenging conditions brought by Storm Gerrit are beginning to ease but the end of the year will continue to be blustery with some showers. The Environment Agency warns that flooding to gardens, driveways or outhouses close to certain rivers in the county is possible. However, the agency states that flooding inside properties is not likely which means that flood warnings are not expected to be issued. As part of the Lincolnshire flood alerts, the Environment Agency website states: \"We are constantly monitoring river levels and have staff in the field checking for blockages and clearing weed screens. Please avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded.\" [Get the latest Lincolnshire Live news with our email newsletters](https://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/news/lincoln-news/latest-lincolnshire-live-news-email-8502346) The Met Office forecasts wind speeds of more than 30mph at times in parts of Lincolnshire over the next few days as well as some rainfall in patches.

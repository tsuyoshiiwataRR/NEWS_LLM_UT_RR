    "text": "The Met Office has warned that gusts of 75mph could hit parts of the south of England and Wales this weekend.\nThe yellow weather warning covers parts of the South East, South West, East Anglia and Wales from 11am on Saturday until 3am on Dec 31.\nA separate yellow warning has been issued for Northern Ireland from midnight until 11am on Saturday, with up to 25mm of rain expected in only a few hours.\nIt comes as the Environment Agency issued 23 flood warnings and a further 103 flood alerts after areas badly hit by Storm Gerrit braced for yet more rainfall.\nThe flood warnings cover areas near Cheltenham, Rugby, Oswestry, York and the Lake District.\nMembers of the Knottingley Canoe Club visited the River Ouse, in York to take advantage of the rising water following heavy rain brought by Storm Gerrit Credit : Yorkshire Post/SWNS Storm Gerrit battered much of the country over the week, with 80mph winds, blizzards and heavy rain, leaving some in Scotland claiming they were blindsided by its ferocity .\nIn the storm’s wake, the Met Office pledged to review its weather alerts after it was challenged over whether amber alerts should have been issued.\nHundreds of homes in Scotland remain without power as the post-storm clean-up begins, but electricity bosses are “very confident” that the remaining 750 properties will be reconnected on Friday.\nThousands of properties in Ceredigion were also without power on Thursday after lightning struck supplies in Wales.\nMeanwhile, New Year’s Eve revellers have been urged to wrap up as conditions across many parts of the UK could feel close to freezing on Sunday night.\nAlex Burkill, a meteorologist, warned there would be a “chilly feel to things as the clock strikes midnight”.\nPeople have been urged to travel before the New Year weekend as rail chaos continues across the country Credit : Vuk Valcic / Avalon The weather is expected to remain unsettled, with further strong winds and heavy rain throughout the last weekend of 2023.\nThe Met Office said a spell of strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services.\nIt comes as people have been urged to travel as early as Friday to avoid missing the festivities, with rail chaos continuing across the country .\nRelated Topics Met Office, Weather, UK Weather",

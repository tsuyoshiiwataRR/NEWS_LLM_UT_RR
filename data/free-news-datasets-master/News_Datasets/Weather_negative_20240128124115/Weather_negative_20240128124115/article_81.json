    "text": "Massive waves flood California beach towns as evacuations ordered\nForecasters say waves as high as 40 feet are possible Thursday in some locations along the California coast, with another round of swells set to arrive Saturday.\nSAN FRANCISCO – Up and down the\nCalifornia coast, monster waves battered beach towns Thursday churned up by a powerful storm in the Pacific Ocean.\nFrom\nSan Diego to Los Angeles and beyond San Francisco, the National Weather Service issued Coastal Flood Warnings and High Surf Warnings for breaking waves between 28 and 33 feet. Some locations were forecast to see waves as high as 40 feet.\nThe massive waves overtook\nbeaches and coastal roads. Some even crashed against homes and businesses.\nThe debris deposited on streets was so heavy that road crews used plows to clear the scenic State Highway 1, south of San Francisco. Other stretches of the road were too buried to clear.\nCALIFORNIA BEACH HOME TO SOME OF LARGEST WAVES IN THE WORLD\nOfficials issued evacuation orders for several northern and central California coastal communities.\n\"We put evacuation warnings into place around 8 a.m. this morning for this area, and, as you can see, these waves are incredibly powerful,\" Ashley Keehn, the\nSanta Cruz County Sheriff's Office Information Officer, told KTVU FOX 2. \"They're washing logs up here. A lot of debris, a lot of driftwood. So we've been asking people to avoid the direct coastal area.\" HOW WEATHER IMPACTS WAVES DURING SURFING COMPETITIONS\nNot everyone heeded the advice, however, and ended up soaked.\nACTIVE EL NINO PATTERN DELIVERS WITH SURF AS HIGH AS 50 FEET IN PACIFIC STRONG EL NINO WINTER: WHAT KIND OF WEATHER YOU CAN EXPECT\nThe waves kept coming. Take a look at this aerial picture of\nVentura, California. The swells come in sets, one after another.\nVentura County\nrescue crews were kept busy with both rescues and injury calls as waves smashed windows and glass doors of homes and swept onlookers off piers and beaches.\nA wave in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles, topped the pier. The NWS estimated that it was 20 feet high.\nWATCH: MASSIVE ROGUE WAVE BATTERS CRUISE SHIP IN NORTH SEA\nCoastal Flood\nWarnings and High Surf Warnings in Northern California expire late Thursday and early Friday morning. The NWS warned that the next set of big swells will arrive Saturday. The Los Angeles NWS office is not taking any chances, and Southern California warnings are in place through Saturday night. The worst of the flooding occurs at high tide.",

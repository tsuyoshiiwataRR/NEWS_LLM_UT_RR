    "text": "Snow impacting some travelers at Bishop Airport FLINT, Mich. (WNEM) - The snow has been coming down in Flint most of the day on Friday, and it’s impacting some travelers at a Flint airport. The snow has had an impact on the roads throughout the entire day, with a steady list of crashes being reported by central dispatch, but for the most part, the blowing snow has been the problem more than it sticking to the roads. Related: [Road conditions in Genesee Co.](https://www.wnem.com/2024/03/22/road-conditions-genesee-co/) TV5 stopped by Bishop Airport, and though the majority of all arrivals and departures were on time as of 6 p.m., there was one delay from United heading to Chicago. “Let me out. I am tired of this snow,” Kelli Catrell said. “Pretty excited. I like to ski, but all the places are closed down, so I am excited to get in the warm,” Kyle Catrell said. “Come back and it’s going to be 50 and no snow, it’ll be gone. We like to fly out of this airport as well; it’s a great airport,” Jeff and Maryanne Rosser said. That sentiment is shared by most flying out to a warmer climate. The road commission said they are operating on a 24-hour cycle to keep the roads salted and clear into Saturday.

    "text": "Light snow today then hazardous travel with next system A clipper system tracking through the Great Lakes is bringing light scattered snow showers. Moderate intensities will occur in the east with some lake enhancement off Lake Michigan. Snow amounts will range from 1-3″, but higher amounts will be possible in Delta, Alger, and Schoolcraft counties. Attention shifts to a stronger storm system, which develops in the Central Plains. It is a slow-moving system and will bring impacts over several days. Light snow starts in the Western U.P. Sunday afternoon and becomes widespread Sunday night through Monday. Rain/snow mix develops late on Monday. Then, as the low gets closer warmer air will cause precipitation to shift to widespread rain for Tuesday. Plan on sloppy road conditions on Monday and wet on Tuesday. Snow amounts are still trending highest in the Western U.P. with around 6″ by Monday possibly with 1-3″ in the east. Stay tuned for changes! Today: Light scattered snow showers >Highs: Upper 20s to low 30s Saturday: Spotty snow showers in the morning >Highs: Low to mid 20s north, upper 20s south Sunday: Afternoon light snow in the west. Then, spreading east during the evening >Highs: Low 30s Monday: Widespread snow and mix > Highs: Mid to upper 30s Tuesday: Widespread rain and warmer >Highs: Low to mid-40s Wednesday: Cloudy with lake-effect snow along the northwest wind belts >Highs: Upper 20s to low 30s Thursday: Spotty snow in the north >Highs: Upper 20s to low 30s Copyright 2024 WLUC.

    "text": "The calendar might say spring, but it’s going to feel like winter for the next 24 hours. The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Weather Advisory for an area-wide snow event that is now underway in the Finger Lakes. The National Weather Service has expanded the Winter Weather Advisory to include all communities across the region. While those in the central Finger Lakes, south of the Thruway, will likely not see as much accumulating snow as those north of the Thruway, there will still be difficult travel through the morning hours on Saturday. [MORE DETAILS: Read the NWS Winter Weather Advisory](https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=BUF&wwa=winter%20weather%20advisory) The precipitation is coming in two major parts. The first should end by 6-7 p.m. There will be a lull in the activity, then precipitation will ramp back up during the late-evening and overnight hours. Slick road conditions and 3-6 inches of snow should be expected by mid-morning. The precipitation will taper off during the morning hours on Saturday and things will remain breezy and cloudy throughout the day. By Sunday, we should see some sunshine.

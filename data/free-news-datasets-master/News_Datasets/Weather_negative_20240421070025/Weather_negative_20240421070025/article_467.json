NBC2 First Alert Storm Team has issued a Severe Weather First Alert. NBC2 First Alert Storm Team has issued a Severe Weather First Alert. You'll definitely want the rain gear and umbrella with you on Friday! Rounds of rain and storms will stream in from the Gulf of Mexico for most of the day. The biggest impact for Southwest Florida is the potential for localized flooding. The good news is the threat of severe thunderstorms has shifted mostly south of our area, so the risk of damaging winds or a tornado will be very low. DOWNLOAD the free [NBC2 News app](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=109350X1567044&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flowcode.com%2Fpage%2Fnbc2-news-app&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbc-2.com%2Farticle%2Fsouthwest-florida-rain-flooding-threat-flood-watch-naples-fort-myers-cape-coral%2F60274863&xcust=undefined) for your latest weather news and alerts Due to the threat of flooding in our area, the NBC2 First Alert Storm Team has issued a Severe Weather First Aalert. Aside from a few breaks in between the clusters of rain today, plan on your Friday being pretty much a washout. Rainfall amounts from today through Saturday will range from 2-4 inches for most of Southwest Florida, but it's possible some areas could see up to 5-6\". Radar: [First Alert Live Doppler Radar](https://www.nbc-2.com/app/nbc-2-doppler-radar/46131048) Remember, if you come across a flooded road, turn around and take a different route. Scattered rain and storms will continue through the first half of Saturday until a cold front swings through and clears out the rain. Sunday will be a much nicer day, with more sunshine, lower humidity, and highs in the 70s.",

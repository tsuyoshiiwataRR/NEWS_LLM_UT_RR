    "text": "While the rivalry between the Tour and LIV is well known, the former is currently fighting another demon of its own. The PGA Tour and the weather have been in a constant tussle since the start of the 2024 season. The huge roundabout came when Wyndham Clark was named the winner of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, [https://www.essentiallysports.com/golf-news-pga-tour-destructive-storm-leaves-wyndham-clark-kissing-the-att-pebble-beach-pro-am-crown/] as the final round was cancelled. Similarly, the inclement weather has not left the Tour’s side yet. Just like every other opening round these days, darkness arrived earlier than expected, leading to the cancellation of the Thursday round [https://www.essentiallysports.com/golf-news-valspar-championship-round-one-cancelled-as-pga-tour-s-misery-continues-in-palm-harbor/] at the Valspar Championship. And now let’s find out if round two could suffer the same fate! WILL THE SUN SHINE OVER THE COPPERHEAD COURSE ON FRIDAY? Unwanted weather has recently disrupted the PGA Tour events. And the chances of the same happening on the second day of the Valspar Championship are higher than ever. The PGA Tour Communication on X shared a weather report that indicates day two will begin at 7:35 ET, with a 50% chance of rain and a slightly sunny morning around that time. As the day proceeds, the chances of a shower will only increase, to a whopping 80% by 2 p.m. ET. And by 6 p.m., the chances of rain will still linger, probably pushing for another suspended round. The temperature during the day will range from 65 F to 70 F, with winds blowing from the southeast at a moderate speed of 15-20 mph. To add to these weather woes, the chances of the play being halted will increase further thanks to an 80% possibility of a thunderstorm by 2 p.m. and a 60% by 6 p.m.. If you are at the Valspar Championship, it is best to take an umbrella with you to avoid getting wet by the possible rain at the Copperhead Course. And even though the weather forecast depicts the weather to sober down as the day proceeds, round one has not yet been completed, hence another delay just might be in order. WHAT TIME WILL ROUND 1 OF THE VALSPAR CHAMPIONSHIP CONTINUE? As the darkness delayed round one of the Valspar Championship, at the end of it, two golfers remained to end their eighteen holes: Paul Barjon and Kevin Dougherty. While Barjon had played 17 holes, scoring at par 72, and was T72, Dougherty was just 43 feet from completing his round. If he does hole his shot on Friday, he’ll putt a birdie. He currently holds an overall score of 2 under par. Explored [https://www.essentiallysports.com/golf-news-two-zero-two-four-valspar-championship-unique-reason-behind-massive-one-five-four-man-field-explored-pga-tour/] The two will resume their final holes at 9:20 a.m. ET. After that, Dougherty will soon start his second round at 9:52 a.m. off the 10th tee. [https://www.essentiallysports.com/golf-news-pga-tour-the-valspar-championship-round-tee-timings-and-pairings/] Barjon, on the other hand, will commence his final shot (or more if he fails to hole his birdie putt) and then head to tee 1 at 9:47 a.m. Tune in to see how both they and the rest of the field fair at the Valspar Championship. And best brace yourself for another possible delay! and More [https://www.essentiallysports.com/golf-news-how-to-watch-twenty-twenty-four-valspar-championship-tv-schedule-live-streaming-and-more-pga-tour/]",

    "text": "Eng. José Sales, a horticultural producer from the community of Jejuí, Liberación district, commented that the strong storm that hit his community this Thursday caused enormous damage to his farm because the structure of about 20 greenhouses were damaged after the temporary.\nIn addition, he expressed that the loss registered due to the climatological impact amounts to between 80 to 100 million guaraníes, where more than 17 thousand tomato seedlings are also in danger of loss due to the lack of the damaged structure that was protecting production.\nAccording to reports, several homes were affected due to the strong gust of wind that lasted a short time, but was enough to leave several fallen trees and loose cables that left a large part of the department of San José without power for several hours.

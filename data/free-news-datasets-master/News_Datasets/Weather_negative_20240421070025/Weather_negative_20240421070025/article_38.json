    "text": "Significant Problems For Friday Morning Commute Heavy Snow Returns To Southern Wisconsin - Snow Likely Friday - Nice Looking Saturday - Another Storm System Arrives Sunday Download the First Alert Weather app MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - A First Alert Day is in place late tonight through Friday as winter makes a quick and aggressive return. A Winter Weather Advisory has been issued for all of southern Wisconsin. As we get a better picture of where the heavier band of snow might set up, it’s not out of the question for a few counties to be upgraded to a Winter Storm Warning. Most places in the 3–5-inch range with a narrow heavier band bringing 5-8 inches, locally higher totals not out of the question. Where that sets up is what we will be pinpointing as we move through the evening hours. Travel is expected to be significantly impacted for the Friday morning commute. Expect delays and cancellations across southern Wisconsin and if travel can be pushed back until after midday, that is the best option. Snow could be heavy at times and in excess of one inch per hour. This will make it hard for road crews to keep up with plowing efforts. The snow could also be heavy and wet leading to it sticking to just about everything blocking stoplights and adding weight to trees and power lines. A secondary threat to keep an eye on. What’s Coming Up... Cloudy this evening with flurries developing after sunset. Snow showers develop around midnight with light snow to follow. Heavy snow should arrive towards daybreak Friday morning. Overnight lows into the upper 20s with 1-3 inches of snow expected. Light easterly winds 5-10 mph. Heavy snow is likely early Friday, tapering off by midday. A few lingering flurries during the afternoon. Highs into the middle 30s with a light easterly wind of 5-10 mph. Additional accumulation of 3-5 inches possible. Decreasing clouds Friday night and much colder with lows into the upper teens. Watch out for refreezing of any wet spots or remaining snow. Mostly sunny on Saturday with cool temperatures on either side of freezing. A few clouds Saturday night with lows into the middle 20s. Looking Ahead... Another significant storm system moves into the area starting Sunday. This will likely start out as snow with some light accumulations possible by Sunday evening. As warmer air moves in, expect precipitation to transition over to rain for Monday and Tuesday. This could end as a wintry mix Tuesday night as colder air filters in. The combination of heavy precipitation and melting snow could lead to a flooding concern. Stay tuned to the forecast as more details come into line for late this weekend and next week.

    "text": "FIRST ALERT: Major winter storm to bring heavy snow, strong wind It is looking more and more likely that a major winter storm will impact much of Minnesota and northern Iowa late this weekend into early next week. A [Winter Storm Watch](https://www.keyc.com/weather/alerts/) is now in effect for much of southern and central Minnesota from Sunday morning through Monday. Snow is expected to start Saturday night, becoming heavy from Sunday through to Monday night. Snow will transition to rain for a period on Monday, before switching back to snow and continuing through Monday night and possibly through much of Tuesday. As of now, it appears that we could get at least 6 inches of snow with the potential for more. There will likely be places that get a foot or more of snow, but those areas will depend on where the storm develops and tracks and rain vs. snow. Those details will become more clear in the next 24 hours or so. In addition to heavy snow, strong wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph will create blowing snow through the duration of this system. This will be a major winter storm that has a significant impact on travel from late Saturday night through much of Tuesday. There will be heavy snow, blowing snow, ice, and rain. Stay tuned… The weather team is watching this storm closely and will have updates as it develops. These are the important things you need to know right now: - Snow will develop Saturday night with heavy snow and blowing snow likely Sunday, Monday into Tuesday. There will be periods where snow transitions to rain. - Travel will likely be difficult, even impossible, from Sunday morning through Monday and into Tuesday. - In Mankato, 6 inches of snow is likely with the possibility of more depending on the storm track and rain vs. snow. - Because this is a warmer system, snow will be wet, heavy, and difficult to move. Some refer to this as “heart attack snow.” Don’t overdo it when shoveling. What you can do: - Be weather aware. Check the weather, and check it often because there will be changes to the forecast as this system develops. - If you have plans for travel from late Saturday night through Tuesday, it’s time to consider alternate plans. Get to where you want to be by Sunday morning because after that travel will be extremely difficult, if not impossible. - If you don’t have it yet, download the KEYC First Alert weather app. This is the best way to stay in touch with changes in developments and get the latest, instant alerts.

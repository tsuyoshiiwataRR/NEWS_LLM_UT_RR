    "text": "CHICAGO — The city’s weather keeps getting weirder. Astronomical spring began Thursday, but snow touched down in Chicago overnight, with more snow showers expected before 4 p.m. Friday, according to the National Weather Service. That could lead to rain 4-5 p.m. Friday and snow showers again after 5 p.m., according to the weather service. Rain is possible overnight. The total accumulation of snow Friday will be less than a half-inch, according to the weather service. The weather report suggests Chicago could be in for a slightly chilly, rainy stretch after that. Saturday will be partly sunny with a high near 37 degrees, according to the weather service. Sunday will be mostly cloudy with a high near 43 degrees. Rain showers are likely after 1 p.m. Monday, with a 70 percent chance of precipitation. Showers are likely again on Tuesday, mainly before 1 p.m. Temperatures in the early part of next week are expected to be in the 50-degree range, according to the weather service. Support Local News!

    "text": "The latest weather forecast warns of challenging weather conditions in portions of the Southern US this week due to a severe outlook. Homeowners should stay alert for severe conditions, causing slower commutes and power outages this March's end. The Southern US has experienced challenging weather conditions this March, with isolated tornadoes, severe weather conditions, slower commutes, isolated [tornadoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXcgDcm7HQs&t=37s), and hail. Recently, [NWN](https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/61002/20240318/nws-weather-forecast-florida-slight-risk-excessive-rainfall-hit-week.htm) has covered the potential poor weather outlook in parts of the Southwest and Texas. People in the affected areas are advised to keep alert with [forecasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kbj1DE8Be4) to stay safe from severe weather, that impacts portions of the Plains, Tennessee Valley, Ohio Valley, and Mississippi.

In Texas, the [NOAA advisory](https://twitter.com/NOAADrought/status/1770824874035913000) shows that the drought outlook can expand in parts of the state.

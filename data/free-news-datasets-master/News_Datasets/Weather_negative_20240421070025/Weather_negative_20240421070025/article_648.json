    "text": "A flood watch for most of the broader D.C. region goes into effect at 2 a.m. Saturday and lasts until 2 p.m., the National Weather Service said. The rain is expected to spread over most of the D.C. area some time after 9 p.m., according to 7News First Alert meteorologist Steve Rudin. On the plus side, “at least it’s going to be dry for the evening rush hour commute. The showers should hold off for the metro area at least until about 8 or 9 p.m.,” Rudin said. That rain is likely to intensify after midnight, bringing the threat of localized flooding. Rudin said the general guideline they’re using is between one and three inches of rain. The heaviest rainfall is anticipated to be along, and east, of the Interstate 95 corridor. The Flood Watch has been expanded to cover most locations east of the Blue Ridge. This is in effect on Sat 2 AM-2 PM where 1.50-2.50″ of rainfall is possible. In particular, rates could push up to 0.50-1.00″ per hour which would enhance the threat for flooding. [#MDwx] [#VAwx] [#DCwx] [pic.twitter.com/104KMUbPuZ] — NWS Baltimore-Washington (@NWS_BaltWash) [March 22, 2024] Once the rain ends, “winds are going to crank up,” Rudin said. Expect gusts between 35 and 40 mph. “If you have plans to check out the cherry blossoms this afternoon and evening, maybe your best bet is check them out at peak bloom Sunday,” Rudin said.

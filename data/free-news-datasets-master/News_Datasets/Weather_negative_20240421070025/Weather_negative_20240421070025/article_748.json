    "text": "SAGINAW COUNTY, Mich. (WJRT) - Well, happy spring! Though today looks to feel more like winter. On this alert day, ABC12 hit the road in Saginaw County to let you know what to expect on your morning commute. The flurries picked up momentum quickly and roads became snow covered, making traffic slow moving. We caught up with MDOT ahead of today's winter weather and they say they're ready -- and are always stay ahead of the storm. They can dispatch crews at a moment's notice. AND they said it's important for drivers to remain vigilant. \"People let their guard down when the weather gets nice, and we had a couple weeks that were absolutely beautiful. You're driving around with your windows down...and here we are a couple weeks later, we're back into good old Michigan winter. Definitely want to remind people stay away from the plows and stuff like that. Give us room to do our job. We want to make everybody safe so we're out there to help and I guarantee you the road in front of the truck is a lot worse than it is behind it so if you stay behind our guys, they'll make sure you get to where you got to go,\" MDOT Transportation Maintenance Supervisor Paul Ruegsegger said.",

    "text": "[Weather](/florida/southtampa/weather)\nTornadoes, Flash Flooding Possible With Powerful FL Storm: Forecast\nA potentially potent system is expected to bring severe weather from Tampa to Miami by Friday, forecasts predict.\nFLORIDA — A powerful system in the Gulf of Mexico is predicted to usher severe thunderstorms and possible flash flooding into the Sunshine State this weekend.\nWith the\nsouthern Plains reportedly already being rocked by the severe weather, a storm system could travel from Texas into Louisiana and eventually into the Florida Peninsula by Thursday night.\nAfter leaving Texas, the system is expected to return to the Gulf to become \"a potent storm,\" FOX Weather reported. This could result in heavy downpour in south Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.\nFind out what's happening in Tampawith free, real-time updates from Patch.\nIn Tampa Bay, spotty showers Thursday night will ramp up to\nheavy downpours Friday morning that could affect the commute to work and school, WFLA said. Frequent lightning and strong winds are often part of these downpours.\nPassing showers are still expected to last throughout Saturday. The threat of severe weather is lower, but there’s a 50% chance of a quick downpour.\nFind out what's happening in Tampawith free, real-time updates from Patch.\nRainfall totals from Friday and Saturday should range from an inch to 2-3 inches where the heaviest downpours fall in Tampa Bay. But more rain is likely in South Florida.\nTwo storm systems will merge to generate drenching rain with increasing winds, building seas and rough surf from Florida to New Jersey from Friday to Saturday,\nAccuWeather said.\nFOX predicted moisture from the Gulf could prompt several rounds of thunderstorms in southern Florida in particular.\n\"Torrential rain will accompany most of the thunderstorms that develop, with an added threat of damaging wind gusts and even some tornadoes.

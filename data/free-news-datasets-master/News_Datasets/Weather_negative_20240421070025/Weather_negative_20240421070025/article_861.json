    "text": "The incident occurred in Greenwich around 1:40 a.m. on Friday, March 22 on I-95 near Exit 3.\nAccording to Connecticut State Police, as troopers were dispatched to the location, Troop G desk personnel began observing DOT highway camera images and identified a red vehicle stopped on the shoulder south of the Exit 3 entrance ramp.\nOn the cameras, desk personnel saw the red vehicle begin traveling in reverse on the right shoulder, before entering into the right and then center lane, still traveling in reverse as oncoming traffic swerved to avoid colliding with it, state police said.\nUpon passing the Exit 3 entrance ramp, the vehicle turned around and began traveling northbound in the area of Exit 5.\nShortly afterward, one of the responding troopers located the vehicle, identified as a Honda HRV, traveling on I-95 southbound in the area of Exit 2.\nThe trooper initiated a motor vehicle stop and during their interactions with the driver, who was identified as Westchester County resident Flavia Cristina De Almeida Gomes, age 49, of West Harrison, troopers suspected that she may have been driving impaired, state police said.\nTroopers administered field sobriety tests which were not performed to standard, they added.\nDe Almeida Gomes was taken into custody and transported to Troop G in Bridgeport, where she was processed and charged with:\n- Operating under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs\n- Failure to maintain a proper lane\n- Driving the wrong way on a divided highway\n- Unsafe backing\n- Improper parking\n- Reckless endangerment\nShe was later released on a $2,500 cash bond.\nGreenwich\n ",

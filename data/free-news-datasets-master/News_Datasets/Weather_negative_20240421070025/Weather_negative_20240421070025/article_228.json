    "text": "Anthony Larson describes himself as a hard-core ice fisher.\nLiving in La Crosse, Wisconsin, right next to the\nMississippi River, he has the luxury to fulfill that description. Once the river and its backwaters ice over each winter, he aims to fish every day, using his work commute to scope out particular spots he wants to hit. Even if all he can spare at the end of the day is 15 or 20 minutes, he goes for it.\nThis winter was different.\nThe\nabove-average temperatures across the upper Midwest, driven in part by the El Niño climate pattern and in part by human-caused climate change, made for less than one month of safe ice on the river, scientists estimate. Though Larson was still able to get out on the ice, the conditions prevented him and his fellow anglers from getting to their favorite spots.\n“We were all kind of trapped within a couple hundred yards of a shoreline,” he said, which affects the type of fish that can be caught and reduces the number.\nThe upper Mississippi River as it snakes along Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa\ntypically freezes during the coldest months of the year, particularly the more languid backwater channels and even the river’s main channel — used by shipping traffic in warmer weather — if it stays cold long enough. Things usually thaw out at the end of March.\nThis season, the last of that ice melted and was floating downstream at the end of February, said Kathi Jo Jankowski, a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey based in La Crosse. Many described the winter conditions as something they’d never experienced before. But as climate change continues to progress, it could become familiar.\n“We’re peering into the future of our ice conditions,” Jankowski said. “This year is going to give us a lot of interesting information about what iceless winters are going to look like.”\nWarm, volatile winter caused unusual ice conditions\nWhen snow fell across Wisconsin on Halloween, Jankowski said it made people hopeful that a great winter lay ahead. But\nthe warm-up that occurred around Christmas Day thawed any ice that had accumulated. In early January, when U.S. Geological Survey staff monitored water quality on the river, they got into the water on regular boats instead of boats that can drive over ice, which they typically have to use that time of year, Jankowski said.\nTemperatures plunged in mid-January, causing the river to freeze up like normal. But it didn’t last long. The winter ended up being\nWisconsin’s warmest on record.\nThe January deep-freeze followed by a quick warm-up caused that ice to float quickly downstream, Jankowski said. Conservation staff in Iowa, Illinois and Missouri saw ice floes and so-called “pancake ice” (round pieces of ice that form as a result of wave action), which are rare on that stretch of river.\nAlthough the lack of snow put those unusual formations on display, that type of ice is weak, Jankowski said.\n“It’s not the kind of ice that people are looking for if they’re going to try to walk out there or get out there fishing,” she said. “It’s beautiful, but a little more dangerous.”\nIt also made it hard for researchers in those states further south who don’t typically see much ice to get out on the river. In Wisconsin, the opposite was true — Shawn Giblin, Mississippi River water quality specialist for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, said he was forced to cancel several sampling trips because the ice was unsafe or because there was no ice at all.\nHe described the season as “a bit of a bummer for a winter lover.”\nCommercial shipping season started earlier than normal\nBarge traffic on the river’s northern stretch\nhalts each winter because of ice. Lake Pepin, a reservoir of the Mississippi River that stretches 21 miles between Reads Landing and Red Wing, Minnesota, is used as an indicator of when commercial shipping can start up again because it’s typically the last place on the river to have ice cover.\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ St. Paul District has conducted ice depth surveys on Lake Pepin for the last 30 years, the results of which they share with the shipping industry. Once ice on the lake is less than a foot thick, a towboat and barge can break through.\nThis year, for the first time,\nthe surveys were canceled because there wasn’t enough ice to measure. Patrick Moes, a spokesperson for the Corps district, said staff drove by the lake and saw it was mostly open.\nREAD MORE ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER\nOn Saturday, shipping season officially began on the upper river, about a week earlier than average. If the Corps hadn’t been conducting maintenance on the river’s locks and dams over the winter, it could have begun even earlier, Moes said.\nHe said he was able to ice fish just once on Lake Pepin this year, during the bitter cold in January.\n“My heart really goes out to all those outfitters and people that rely on winter recreation and activities to put food on the table,” he said, “because obviously, this winter has been unlike anything I’ve ever witnessed.”\nThis winter could give foresight on the future\nIt’s not yet clear what effect the lack of ice will have on the river ecosystem, Jankowski said. Without ice cover, sunlight can more easily penetrate the water column. That could bolster aquatic plant growth, but it could also spur earlier algae activity because the water is full of nutrients.\nMore open water also gives\ninvasive carp better opportunities to move within the river, she said.\nIce cover on the upper Mississippi is already waning. Records from Lake Pepin dating back to 1843 show that ice thaws\nabout two weeks sooner today than it did then. And as the world warms, it’s a trend that’s expected to continue.\nThis winter, then, can be used as an opportunity to think about how to adapt to future ones with less ice, Jankowski said, including adjusting our lifestyles.\nFor Larson, that’s already in process. Though he wasn’t able to ice fish as much as he wanted, he used the time to pick up another hobby: falconry.\n“This was a great year to hang the ice fishing stuff up, as much as it’s in my blood,” he said. “I was still able to find other adventures.”\nThis story is a product of the\nMississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk, an independent reporting network based at the University of Missouri in partnership with Report for America, funded by the Walton Family Foundation.\nType of work:",

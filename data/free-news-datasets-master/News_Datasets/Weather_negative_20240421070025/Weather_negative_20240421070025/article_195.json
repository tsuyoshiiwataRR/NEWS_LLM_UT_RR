    "text": "What a wonderful winter we’re having this spring. The calendar says it’s spring, but a wintry blast may roll across the region into early next week, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). A mixture of light snow, rain, freezing rain and wintry mix was forecast to occur across most of the area through this morning (Friday). The most intense activity lies ahead, according to Tim Masters, a meteorological technician with the NWS office in Sioux Falls. “This (early rain-snow mix) is the teaser stuff ahead of the main big trough of low pressure coming out of the west,” he said. “It will start coming in Friday night and will persist through probably Tuesday.” Much uncertainty remains on the amount and type of precipitation, Masters said, but some things appear certain. “This is a spring version of a major winter storm. It’s going to be long-lived, several days of rain, snow and maybe some wintry mix in there,” he said. “What complicates things is we’re going to be right around freezing. If the freezing sets up a little south, we’ll see more snow. If it’s further north, we’ll see more rain.” Because of that uncertainty, southeast South Dakota and northeast Nebraska could see widely varying conditions during the storm system, Masters said. “Yankton should be on the southern end (of the trough) and get mostly rain and sleet but won’t get into the heavier snow,” he said. “But there’s still a small probability that Yankton could get more than six inches (of snow).” WHAT COULD HAPPEN The NWS has been tracking the system in the western United States as it moves across the nation, Masters said. Various models predict different paths for the system, which could mean a major difference for the Yankton region. “There is a lot of uncertainty where the rain-snow line is going to be and what we’ll see for (the amount and type of) precipitation,” he said. Currently, the two main tracks are following Interstate 80, through Nebraska and Iowa, and Interstate 90, through South Dakota and Minnesota. “We know it’s working west to east; it’s a matter of how far north or south,” Masters said. In the coming days, he advises against planning outdoor activities. In addition, he encourages travelers to change or cancel their plans, if needed. A DAILY BREAKDOWN The NWS website provides an estimate of when the second, larger storm could arrive and what it can mean for the Yankton region. To the west, Lake Andes could begin receiving snow shortly after midnight Saturday, continuing with either additional snow or a wintry mix through Tuesday. Yankton could begin receiving snow around 6 a.m. Saturday. The outlook calls for the system to continue with a combination of rain and wintry mix through Monday night, with snow expected to return Tuesday. For southeast South Dakota, today’s outlook calls for partly sunny skies with a high near 40. The breezy conditions include a north wind of 15-20 miles per hour (mph), gusting to 25 mph. On Saturday, the outlook calls for a 30% chance of snow with cloudy skies and a high near 37. Wind gusts could reach 30 mph. In the nighttime, the chance of precipitation is 70% with new snow accumulations of less than a half-inch possible. Sunday’s outlook calls for a 100% chance of precipitation with new snow accumulations of less than a half-inch possible. The east-southeast wind of 25-35 mph could gust to 40 mph. On Sunday night, the chance of precipitation remains high at 90% with rain and snow. Some thunder is also possible. On Monday, the outlook calls for a 90% chance of precipitation with a high near 34, and a 50% chance of snow that night. The storm tapers down Tuesday, with a 20% chance of snow before 1 p.m. The outlook calls for mostly sunny, with a high near 24 and blustery conditions. For northeast Nebraska, the NWS outlook follows a similar pattern. The storm system will bring widespread precipitation to the region Saturday evening through Monday. This will include chances for accumulating snow, especially over northeast Nebraska. The first snow chance is a 30-40% chance of accumulating snow Saturday morning, mainly along the Nebraska-South Dakota border. The better chance for snow accumulation, ranging from a 50-70% chance in far northeast Nebraska down to a 20-30% chance along Interstate 80, will be from late Sunday night into Tuesday morning. The NWS noted the forecast is likely to change as the storm track becomes more apparent. NEEDED MOISTURE Given the prolonged drought, any precipitation is welcome in the northern Great Plains, according to Colorado assistant state climatologist Becky Bolinger. “We’ve had a very mild winter,” she said during Thursday’s NOAA webinar covering the Rocky Mountains to the Great Lakes. As a result, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has recorded low flows of rivers and streams across the region, she said. In addition, the snowpack in Montana, which feeds the Missouri River, has been running at low levels. “There are concerns with the very mild winter and low snowpack in the Missouri River basin, that these flows could likely go lower,” she said. The drought conditions also heighten concerns about wildfires, she noted. The weekly U.S. Drought Monitor report lists all of southeast South Dakota and northeast Nebraska at least abnormally dry, with Lincoln and Minnehaha counties in moderate drought. Looking at the incoming weather system, Masters said the same conditions can produce different results now than during mid-winter. “Below normal temperatures in mid- to late March are different than January,” he said. “Now, ‘below normal’ means more like the 30s, while in January it’s much colder. And if we do get snow, it would be wet snow, which is harder to blow around.” Despite the spring date on the calendar, Masters said travelers shouldn’t become complacent and should travel fully prepared, including a full tank of gas. “We’re advising people to treat this like it was January,” he said. March entered with unseasonably mild weather, with the old saying, “In like a lamb, out like a lion.” Given the forecast, the adage will apparently come true, Masters said. “This (storm) would be the lion,” he said.

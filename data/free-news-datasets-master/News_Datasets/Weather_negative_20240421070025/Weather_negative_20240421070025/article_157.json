    "text": "[Jakkar Aimery](/staff/5652546001/jakkar-aimery/) A winter weather advisory will be in effect all day Friday for most of southern and mid-Michigan with two to four inches of snow forecast, creating hazardous travel conditions, the National Weather Service said. The advisory is in effect from 6 a.m. Friday through midnight, warning that snow accumulations and a mix of rain were expected in Shiawassee, Genesee, Lapeer, St. Clair, Livingston, Oakland and Macomb counties. Saginaw, Bay and Midland counties could see up to 7 inches of snow. Trent Frey, a meteorologist with the weather service in White Lake Township, said a low-pressure system forming in the Midwest was expected to \"bring this plume of snow across the Great Lakes region,\" but would be moving out by late Friday. \"Starting at 6 a.m., we'll see the lead edge of the snow work in; there could be a lull during the mid-day period, but then we expect another round of precipitation move in during the evening into the late evening hours before the snow tapers off,\" Frey told The Detroit News on Thursday. Southern parts of Metro Detroit could see 1-2 inches, whereas northern areas could see 2-3 inches, said Frey, who added that snow this time of year is not unusual during the transition period from winter into the spring months. \"Most Marches, we do see a bit of snow,\" he said. \"So far this month, we've only seen .4 inches of snow; normally up to this point, we see about 5 inches.\" Temperatures Friday though Sunday were expected to top out near 39 in Metro Detroit, the weather service said. Temperatures were predicted to climb Monday with highs in the mid-upper 50s, Frey added. Average readings around this time of year are highs around 48 and lows near 30, Frey said.",

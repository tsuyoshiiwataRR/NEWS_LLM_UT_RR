Texas: Huge wildfire engulfs Walker County Dozens of [wildfires](/latest/wild-fires) have erupted along the Appalachian Mountains on Thursday as a cold front across the mid-Atlantic combines with humidity during a bizarre weather week. Wildfires have been reported from [Maryland](/latest/maryland) to [North Carolina](/latest/north-carolina), with the most amount of damage in [West Virginia](/latest/west-virginia) and [Virginia](/latest/virginia). At least five fires greater than 100 acres began to burn on Wednesday and continued on Thursday across Virginia in the Shenandoah Valley. State firefighters have responded to over 100 wildfires in the past two days, according to officials with the Virginia Department of Forestry. The fires have appeared to burn through more than 7,500 acres as evacuation orders are issued in specific counties.

Multiple roads and highways in the county have also been temporarily shut down. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality issued a health alert through Thursday night due to danger from heavy smoke. The department said: “Active children and adults should limit or reschedule strenuous outdoor activities until conditions improve. “People unusually sensitive to air pollution, especially those with heart or lung disease (including asthma), should avoid strenuous outdoor activities until conditions improve.” Orange-tinted skies were seen throughout Virginia on Thursday, and at least 10,000 electric outages were reported in the region due to wind gusts of more than 60mph. The National Weather Service office in Washington, DC, and Blacksburg, Virginia, said that the amount of fire activity is not unprecedented compared to wildfires over the past decades. On Friday night into Saturday, heavy rain is expected to soak the region, followed by another few dry days next week.

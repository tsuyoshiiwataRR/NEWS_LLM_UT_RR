    "text": "Richard Schmitz, the 55-year-old man who accepted responsibility for the 2013 death of 38-year-old Meshell Will, was sentenced Friday morning to 10 years in prison for second-degree manslaughter. Will's body was found near mile marker 54 and the Pigtail Bridges on Iron Mountain Road on Aug. 31, 2013. Senior Deputy Pennington County State's Attorney Roxanne Hammond said Will's body was so decomposed it was \"barely recognizable as human.\" Schmitz and Will lived across the hall from one another in Custer and were in a romantic relationship during the summer of 2013. On Aug. 24, 2013, the two checked into the Brookside Motel in Keystone to spend the weekend together, law enforcement reports show. Hammond said the last time a witness saw Will alive was when the hotel upgraded the couple's room because of maintenance issues. People are also reading… \"Meshell was thrilled,\" Hammond said. In July 2021, eight years after Will's body was found, Schmitz was arrested and charged with second-degree murder. Schmitz's arrest coincided with a 2021 pathology report that ruled Will's manner of death as either undetermined or homicide. The initial autopsy ruled her manner of death as undetermined. \"It's difficult to tell how Meshell died,\" Hammond said, but she pointed to the circumstantial evidence surrounding the case as enough to prove Schmitz killed Will in the hotel room and discarded her body in the Black Hills. Hammond highlighted Schmitz's lies to law enforcement. Investigators interviewed him several times following Will's death. He initially stated he did not see her in the days prior. He told police conducting a welfare check at her residence she returned to Texas. He later admitted he was with her in Keystone, but denied any involvement in her death until he entered an Alford plea to second-degree manslaughter on Jan. 30. An Alford plea is an acknowledgement that the state has enough evidence to convict without explicitly admitting guilt. The plea, however, functions the same as a guilty plea. Hammond asked the judge to sentence Schmitz to the maximum of 10 years for second-degree manslaughter. \"He deserves a lot more time than this court can give him,\" Hammond said. Martha Rossiter, Schmitz's defense attorney, made an impassioned sentencing argument focused primarily on what she characterized as weaknesses in the state's case. She said Will's family knew her to wander off, and she was a heavy drinker who took medications for mental health issues. Rossiter said evidence indicated Will died at the place her body was found, and her body was not moved. She did not, however, dispute that her client lied to law enforcement. \"Mr. Schmitz has an issue being honest, particularly with police,\" Rossiter said. Hammond stated Schmitz killed Will in the hotel room, but Rossiter said hotel staff did not notice anything unusual about the room after the couple's stay. She also called into question the pathologist who determined Will could have died by homicide, highlighting a [1999 Los Angeles Times article](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jul-11-mn-54984-story.html) that discussed the overturning of a case where two parents had been convicted of murder based on the pathologist's determinations. Deborah Lemonds, a Custer woman, spoke on behalf of Schmitz as well. She said he took care of her after she suffered an injury, and he \"has never, ever hurt people.\" Rossiter asked Presiding Judge Craig Pfeifle to sentence Schmitz to time served — 966 days — over two-and-a-half years. Pfeifle said although he \"appreciates the passion\" of Rossiter's argument, Schmitz agreed to the plea deal. The judge said he based his sentence off of the plea and Schmitz's past conduct, which included convictions of violent crimes against women. \"You have a significant challenge dealing with romantic relationships in your life,\" Pfeifle said. \"I think you continue to remain a danger.\" The judge emphasized Schmitz could have disputed the facts of the case at trial. \"You elected not to do that,\" he said.

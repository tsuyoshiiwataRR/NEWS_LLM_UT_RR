    "text": "A Storm Track 7 Yellow ALERT DAY is in effect through noon as a clipper system brings heavy snowfall and a wintry mix to much of the viewing area. The morning commute will be slow and slick with delays possible. Today [WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY Until Noon]: Snow and sleet has been falling across the area early this morning with rain further south of Highway 30. The radar continues to fill in this morning with pockets of heavier rates at times. There is a wider batch of thundershowers/thundersnow producing heavy precipitation rates moving in from the west that should reach us through the morning commute. The rate of snow will overcome the warm ground and treated roads and accumulate, slowing things down and leading to slick travel. Give yourself a lot of extra time this morning and drive safe and slow. Check for school delays. While putting together a snowfall map has proven difficult for this system, I am expecting 2-5” to fall along Highway 20 with 1-3” to the north of Highway 18 and a trace to 3” from Highway 30 to I-80. The wintry mix ends by noon with mostly cloudy skies and highs in the mid to upper 30s. Winds are northerly at 10 to 15 mph, gusting to 25 mph. Tonight: Clouds decrease as skies become mostly clear. Lows fall to the mid teens to mid 20s, the coldest air where the snow is deepest. Winds are light from the north at 5 to 10 mph. Saturday: This is the day to get out and run any errands. Clouds are on the increase but it will be dry with highs in the mid 30s to low 40s. Winds are light from the east at 5 to 10 mph. A Storm Track 7 Yellow ALERT DAY has been issued for Sunday as a dynamic system could bring significant snow to areas north of Highway 20. Sunday and Next Week: Light snow chances build in Saturday night, but the main surge of moisture moves in mid to late morning on Sunday, beginning as snow with cooler temperatures. We’ll have a very powerful southeast wind, which will gradually warm us throughout the day, to about the low 40s by midnight. Therefore, we will see a transition from snow to rain taking place from south to north as the day goes on. Before the complete change over, we may see some accumulations, possibly more significant than today, in our far northern counties. Temperatures warm with mostly rain expected Sunday night. Rain is likely with some thunderstorms possible for Monday with highs up to the 50s. Then, rain and snow is likely Monday night with snow ending Tuesday morning as temperatures crash. Winds are very strong with this system. I hope the rest of your day is a breeze! - Brandon",

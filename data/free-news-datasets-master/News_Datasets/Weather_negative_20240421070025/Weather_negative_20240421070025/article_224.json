    "text": "By Mary Walsh ,\n10 hours ago\nA winter storm is moving into New England this weekend and Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine are all forecasting snow.\nSunday River just shared an image from local Maine CBS affiliate WGME that shows a fantastic forecast for Maine snowboarders\n\"If you haven't made plans for Saturday yet, you probably should.\" posted Sunday River on Instagram.\nThe inland Maine resort received a few inches earlier in the week when a smaller storm rolled through Wednesday and Thursday. Temperatures dropped, allowing Sunday River to turn on its snowmaking, a beautiful thing considering the roller coaster weather the Northeast has had this winter.\nWGME reported that the storm will begin between 2am and 5am Saturday morning and continue through 10pm-1am Sunday morning. The state's coastal region is only expecting 1-3 inches, potentially mixing into rain, but over a foot in the mountains has New Englanders waxing their snowboards and setting their stances back.\nFollow along at @sundayriver on Instagram.\nWe are always on the lookout for amusing, interesting, and engaging snow related videos to feature on our channels. Whether you are a professional rider or just an amateur, we want to see your best footage and help you share it with the world. Submit your video for a chance to be featured on SNOWBOARDER and our social channels.

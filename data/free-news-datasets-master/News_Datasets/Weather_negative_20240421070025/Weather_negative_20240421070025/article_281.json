    "text": "Heavy snow potential and travel concerns can likely unload in northern New England and New York State this week, according to a forecast by the National Weather Service (NWS). Heavy snow can lead to slower commutes due to slippery roads and foggy conditions due to [potential heavy snow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXcgDcm7HQs). Limiting outdoor plans is recommended to avoid the dangers of commuting and travel. Recently, [NWN](https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/61052/20240320/northeast-expect-heavy-snowfall-weekend-new-storm-unload-upper-midwest.htm) reported heavy snowfall in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, causing a cold-related health concern and a power outage. The stormy conditions can unload potential hypothermia and frostbite. In addition, the [NWS Weather Prediction Center](https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/61052/20240320/northeast-expect-heavy-snowfall-weekend-new-storm-unload-upper-midwest.htm) warns of a potential large storm in the Upper Midwest and Northern Plains this weekend. Homeowners should stay alert for mixed precipitation early next week. Motorists traveling this week should stay alert to forecasts and [road conditions](https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/61060/20240322/southern-weather-forecast-isolated-tornadoes-hail-unload-weekend.htm) to stay safe from the Northern Plains winter storm. Snow-covered roads can be hazardous. Weather Conditions in New York State and New England According to a forecast by the [National Weather Service](https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdspd) (NWS), early spring heavy snows are likely this weekend in northern New York State and into northern New England. The [forecast](https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/61052/20240320/northeast-expect-heavy-snowfall-weekend-new-storm-unload-upper-midwest.htm) monitors the development of winter weather in the portions of the northern tier of the US for the first week of spring. However, portions of New England can expect additional heavy snow on Thursday night, spreading over the Lower Great Lakes and Upper Mississippi Valley. On the weekend, snowy conditions can unfold in parts of northern New States and northern New England, with potential snowfall. Homeowners should anticipate below-average temperatures on the weekend. Meanwhile, the NWS forecast warns of an impactful winter storm in portions of eastern Montate on late Saturday. On the other hand, widespread wet weather can unload in Florida, East Texas, and the Eastern Seaboard. North and South Dakota can expect challenging commutes, including in northern Wisconsin and Minnesota. Motorists should stay alert for blowing snow and low visibility, affecting the road conditions due to heavy snow and gusty winds. Limiting unnecessary travel is advisable to keep safe from the weather. In [New York City](https://twitter.com/NWSNewYorkNY), homeowners are advised to check for a flood watch concern in the city, including in the Lower Hudson Valley. The heavy rain potential can bring flooding concerns, particularly in areas in Rockland County and Westchester. In addition, scattered to widespread minor urban flooding is possible.

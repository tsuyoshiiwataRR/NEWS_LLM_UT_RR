    "text": "Despite the soaking rain at the beginning of the month, the surface soils dried quickly over the past week across Virginia. Strong winds on Wednesday and the especially low humidity provided ideal conditions for rapid fire spread. As a few trees came down in the strong west winds and power lines sparked, wildfires grew quickly — especially in and near the Shenandoah Valley. Lighter winds on Thursday slowed down the spread of the fires, but winds will pick up again on Friday, this time from the southeast, the opposite direction from Wednesday. Those winds will not be as strong, and they will begin to increase the humidity, easing the risk of rapid fire spread. Just when it is needed, soaking rain settles in statewide on Friday night.

Nonetheless, don’t be surprised to see standing water in a few places on Saturday morning. This storm center will be passing just south, then east of Virginia, which means the southeast wind that develops on Friday will turn more from the northeast by late Saturday. Even though it will not be consistently windy while the rain is falling on Saturday, wind speeds will increase to 15-25 mph Saturday night and Sunday, with some gusts approaching 40 mph on Sunday. The stronger onshore winds this weekend may yield minor tidal flooding from the lower James and York rivers and the north facing shores of Hampton Roads communities. These are also the locations where the rain will be heaviest and the wind will be strongest, so be prepared for windswept rain if heading toward the Virginia waterfront or the northern Outer Banks this weekend. Aside from the winds, Sunday will be sunny in Richmond, but the afternoon will hold in the 50s with that chilly northeast wind. Wind speeds will ease on Monday, but continue from the northeast, as a strong cell of high pressure in southeastern Canada will funnel cool air southward down the eastern side of the Appalachians for a couple of days. This will lead to the unusual situation on Monday where Virginia’s mountains will be a few degrees warmer than the areas east of the Blue Ridge. Richmond will not go long before the next rain arrives, as the next system approaches Wednesday into Thursday of next week. Many questions remain about the precise timing and intensity of that storm, but early indications are for another modest soaking rain of at least a half-inch. But that should give us a dry final Saturday of the month in the storm’s wake, something that has been tough to find so far in 2024. - JOE MARTUCCI Lee Weather Team Photos: DC cherry blossoms reach peak bloom at earliest date of last 21 years According to the National Park Service, the cherry trees in the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C., reached peak bloom this year on March 17. According to [NPS data](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/cherryblossom/bloom-watch.htm), that's the earliest date in the last 21 years. Past peak blooms have been as early as March 15 (1990) and as late as April 18 (1958).

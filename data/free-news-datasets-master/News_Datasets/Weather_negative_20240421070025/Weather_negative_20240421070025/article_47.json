    "text": "By Our Reporter SHILLONG, March 21: A recent study published in the Quarterly Journal of The Royal Meteorological Society reveals alarming trends in extreme one-day rainfall occurrences over Meghalaya, Northeastern regions of India, and Bangladesh. Researchers found that such events have tripled over the past four decades since 1979, potentially impacting the Southeast Bangladesh region in the medium to long term. Furthermore, using climate models, the researchers have projected future trends, indicating a potential doubling of one-day extreme events annually over the North East region of Bangladesh and India (NEBI) region by 2050-2079. These projections encompass the Sylhet division of Bangladesh and the Meghalaya Plateau of India. Parts of the Indian northeast have faced rainfall deficits in recent years, coupled with unevenly distributed rain and longer dry spells. The study highlighted the NEBI region, particularly the Meghalaya Plateau, as experiencing extreme rainfall leading to devastating flash floods in areas like Sylhet and Sunamganj districts of Bangladesh and Assam state of India. The study attributed seasonal monsoon rainfall to low-level jets carrying moisture from the Bay of Bengal inland, resulting in heavy precipitation when met with the region’s topography. Analysis of meteorological data from India and Bangladesh over 72 years indicates a quadrupling of extreme events between 1979 and 2021 compared to the baseline period of 1950-1979. This increase is driven by variations in the low-level jet and warmer sea surface temperatures. This calls for the immediate need to enhance infrastructure resilience, implement early warning systems, and promote sustainable land management practices to minimize the adverse effects of flooding and ensure the safety and well-being of communities. As climate change continues to pose significant challenges globally, collaborative efforts at local, national, and international levels are crucial to address the growing threat of extreme weather events and safeguard vulnerable populations and ecosystems.",

    "text": "Up to three inches of rain expected in Norwich area. How officials are preparing Heavy rain is expected in the Norwich area over the weekend. The National Weather Service’s Forecast Office in Norton, Massachusetts, predicts the rain to start between 6 and 8 a.m. Saturday and conclude around midnight on Sunday. Two to three inches of rain is expected in the Norwich area. A flood watch will be in effect throughout Connecticut from 8 a.m. Saturday to 8 a.m. Sunday. Excessive runoff from heavy rainfall may cause flooding of small streams and rivers, urban areas, highways and low-lying spots. Chris Riley, communications manager for Norwich Public Utilities, said the company will monitor the rainfall closely and react to whatever comes their way. Concerns for flooding, power outages “We know that the dam in Occum is always a concern,” Riley said. “We know that flooding in the streets can be a challenge for us and also the public works department and following the weather closely is a critical first step. And then if the situation deteriorates after we get a bunch of rain, we will make sure that we have the right material and equipment and personnel in place so that we can respond.” Riley said another concern for Norwich Public Utilities is cars driving in this weekend’s weather. The weather might cause a car to crash into a utility pole, causing power outages for hundreds of customers and a challenging restoration process for the Norwich Public Utilities line department.",

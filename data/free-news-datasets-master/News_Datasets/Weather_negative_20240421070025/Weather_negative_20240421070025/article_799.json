    "text": "A significant winter storm is headed to Maine for Saturday with heavy snow, mixed precipitation and rain expected through the day. Travel is likely to be impacted.\nThe snow will begin very early Saturday, between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. Several types of precipitation will continue the day, wrapping up between 10 p.m. Saturday and 1 a.m. Sunday.\nThis storm will be a big dump of snow in the mountains — 8-14 inches or more of light, powdery snow. Twenty inches or even 2 feet of snow is not out of the question in isolated spots.\nFor the foothills through portions of central Maine, sleet or freezing rain will cut into snow totals. Five to 9 inches of sloppier snow expected is expected there.\nFor the coastal plain, 3-6 inches of snow is most likely before a switch to mix and then plain rain. Along the coast, only a couple inches or so expected as it will quickly switch to rain. Things will turn very slushy as the snow changes over to rain.\nQuieter weather looks to return for Sunday with temperatures in the mid to upper 30s for the afternoon. The weather looks good for any maple festivities going on across the state.\nSuccess. Please wait for the page to reload.

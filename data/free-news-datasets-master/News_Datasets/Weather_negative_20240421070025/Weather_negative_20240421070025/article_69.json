    "text": "First Alert: Snow makes for a messy Friday SAGINAW, Mich. (WNEM) - It’s been on our radars (pun intended) all week, and now we’re in our final forecast adjustment window as we get set for snow to return to Mid-Michigan on Friday. Winter Weather Advisories have now been issued for the entire TV5 area, running from the early morning hours of Friday to midnight Saturday. For specific info on your county, head to our [Weather Alerts page](https://www.wnem.com/weather/alerts/). We also have a detailed breakdown of your forecast below. Keep tabs on any closings on our [Closings page](https://www.wnem.com/weather/closings/). For a look beyond Friday, be sure to check out your [First Alert 7-Day Forecast](https://www.wnem.com/weather/forecast/7-day/)! This Evening & Overnight Dry weather is expected through this evening, and before the sun goes down, we’ll have some sun. If you have any errands to run or evening activities, you should be in good shape. Temperatures will gradually drop into the teens and 20s for overnight lows. So as snow begins toward Friday morning’s commute, it may not have trouble sticking. Wind chills will likely be in the teens and low 20s during the morning. Friday This forecast has been a little bit of a headache, with some shifting around of our models on the locations of the heaviest snow, and also a few small scale meteorological features could be present in this event that bring a couple of bands of snowfall that will be locally heavy compared to other areas, and pinning these areas down can be especially tough. All that being said, we think we have a good general overview of this event. Snow will start moving into the area during the morning commute, with current timing slated for around 4-6 AM in our western areas, assuming the snow can overcome the dry air from today. We want to stress that not all morning commutes and bus routes may be impacted the equally. Some, especially those farther east, may be able to get through the commute just fine. We are keeping an eye specifically on the southern areas near Genesee, Lapeer, and Shiawassee counties during the morning hours as it’s possible we see one of those heavier snow bands that we mentioned above. This band is expected somewhere between I-94 and I-69. We currently have 2-5″ for the southernmost sections of our area with the possibility that after the morning, snow rates could slow down quite a bit, making accumulation more difficult later in the event. If this heavier band sets up over I-69, that could bust that 2-5″ zone with higher totals, so it’s worth watching. Snow will spread to the east as the morning goes on, becoming widespread by late morning. From there, we will grind snow out through the early evening before we taper off from northwest to southeast through midnight (ending soonest west). From around 3 PM to 8 PM tomorrow, there may be a second band of heavier snow around the central part of our area, that could make the afternoon and evening drives dicey. This makes school a tricky call again tomorrow, as the morning may be manageable, while some of the afternoon routes could be tough. That secondary band of heavy snow could have areas of 1″ per hour snowfall rates, which will add up pretty quickly in those areas. The heaviest zone on our snowfall map features an area of 4-7″ where we expect that band to be located. While it’s always possible this could shift, data has been fairly consistent in pointing to central lower Michigan as its location. Outside of that, we have 3-6″ in the Thumb and northern Genesee, Lapeer, and Shiawassee, and then 2-5″ in our northern counties. This area was trimmed down a bit with a slight southern trend over the last 24 hours. Even so, these areas will still get a decent snow, barring a huge last minute movement. Our map is below. Winds won’t be a huge factor tomorrow, with gusts only topping out around 15 to 20 miles per hour. Temperatures will likely hover a few degrees on either side of the freezing mark, so accumulation should be able to occur, especially as ground temps have cooled down this week. One factor that could be a wild card is a stronger March sun angle, which could chip into accumulations some. It’s a difficult forecast and there will likely be some trouble areas when it comes to verification on snowfall amounts. But we think the general trends of timing and impacts are fairly clear. Drive safely and be prepared for changing conditions on the roads. If we do that, we’ll make it to the dry weekend ahead! We’ll keep you updated throughout the day on Friday. Copyright 2024 WNEM.

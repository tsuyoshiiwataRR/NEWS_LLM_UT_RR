    "text": "Ultra Miami: \"severe thunderstorms\" and heavy rain predicted ahead of festival\nThe festival gets underway today (Friday, 22nd March) at Bayfront Park\nA number of weather warnings have been issued in the South Florida region, right as this year's edition of Ultra Miami is about to get underway today (Friday, 22nd March).\nNational Weather Service updates in Miami have warned of rounds of heavy rain on the festival's first day, along with a chance of some \"severe thunderstorms\". Localised flooding is also considered possible in urban and poor drainage locations through the city, while wind speeds will be slightly higher than usual.\nIt's expected that some of these weather conditions will continue into Saturday, with rain likely to continue until late in the evening of that day. This is the result of a developing storm system in the Gulf of Mexico.\nUltra Miami kicks off today at Bayfront Park in Downtown Miami, and continues through to Sunday, 24th March. DJ Mag has requested a comment from Ultra regarding safety precautions surrounding the potential inclement weather at the festival.\nArmin van Buuren, Peggy Gou, Chase & Status, David Guetta, Miss Monique and Orbital are among the acts on the bill for this year's event. Find the set times and streaming schedule for Ultra Miami 2024\n[here](//djmag.com/news/ultra-miami-2024-set-times-and-streaming-schedule-announced).\nRead DJ Mag's round-up of the 10 acts not to miss at this year's festival\n[here](//djmag.com/features/10-unmissable-acts-ultra-miami-2024).",

    "text": "Please help us improve PreventionWeb by taking this brief survey. Your input will allow us to better serve the needs of the DRR community.\nWest Africa heatwave was supercharged by climate crisis, study finds\nA searing heatwave that struck west\nAfrica in February was made 4C hotter and 10 times more likely by human-caused global heating, a study has found.\nThe heat affected millions of people but the number of early deaths or cases of illness are unknown, due to a lack of reporting.\n[...]\nThe most severe heat occurred from 11 to 15 February, with temperatures peaking above 40C and averaging 36C. Humidity was also high, making it harder for people to cool down by sweating. The heat index, a measure combining temperature and humidity to reflect how heat feels, was 50C. “That is very dangerous for the human body,” said Izidine Pinto, of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.\n[...]\n“Many people do not appreciate the dangers of heat [but high temperatures] are silent killers,” said Maja Vahlberg, of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. “They can be incredibly deadly for the elderly, people with existing health conditions and outdoor workers. Roughly half of the west African population also lives in informal housing, rendering millions of people highly vulnerable to extreme heat.”\nPlease note: Content is displayed as last posted by a PreventionWeb community member or editor.

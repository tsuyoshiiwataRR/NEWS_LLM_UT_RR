    "text": "City of Madison emphasizes sidewalk regulations after snowstorm hits Southern Wisconsin MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - After several inches of snow fell on Southern Wisconsin Friday, the City of Madison is reminding residents about the importance of shoveling sidewalks. Officials say it is important for residents not to rely on outside temperatures to melt snow or ice on public sidewalks. Residents should sprinkle sand on icy sidewalks. If anyone needs sand, here is a [list](https://www.cityofmadison.com/residents/winter/SnowIce/sand.cfm) of sand piles located around the city. Officials say 324 snow-clearing violations have been given out since Oct. 1. The city has also received 71 excessive use complaints, but no citations have been issued. For public sidewalks, property owners are responsible for removing snow. Officials encourage anyone who rents to read their lease to see who is responsible for removing snow.

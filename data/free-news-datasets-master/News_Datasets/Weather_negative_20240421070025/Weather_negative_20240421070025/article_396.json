Maar helaas ‚Ä¶ it looks like rainy Dutch weather is set to return with a vengeance! üòÆ‚Äçüí®‚òîÔ∏è\nBe sure to pack your brolly when you head off to work this morning, as Weeronline reports that there‚Äôll be showers in the north and northwest of the country.\nUnless, of course, you‚Äôre lucky enough to live in Limburg or east of Brabant! These regions will largely remain dry ‚Äî and may even see some sun.\nExpect more rain this weekend All of this means, unfortunately, that you may also need to shelve those epic weekend plans of yours ‚Äî or, at least, pop some waterproofs and wellies on them. üòâ\n@dutchreview The rain really adds to the dewy look üíÖ #Meme #MemeCut #fyp #fyp„Ç∑„Çöviral #dutchreview #dutchweather #expatlife\n‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì DutchReview Country-wide rain showers will kick off on Saturday morning, and some regions may even see thunderstorms or the occasional bout of hail.\nAt 8 to 10 degrees Celsius during the day, it‚Äôll also be marginally colder than usual for late March.\nSunday will see even stronger and more regular showers, with some rather powerful gusts of wind.\nThe weather is expected to dry out somewhat by Sunday afternoon, and by early evening, various parts of the country may even see some sunshine.\nNext week, thankfully, will likely see much drier weather.\nHow will the rain affect your weekend plans (if at all)?

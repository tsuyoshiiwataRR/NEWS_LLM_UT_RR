    "text": "Topline A “significant winter storm” is forecast for New England and the upper Midwest through the weekend, with heavy snowfall expected in portions of the western U.S., the National Weather Service said Friday, amid concerns of strong winds and heavy rain that could result in flash floods along the East Coast.\nKey Facts A winter storm is expected to start Friday in eastern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and Michigan, the National Weather Service said , with projected snowfall of up to seven inches across the upper Midwest and central and northern New England.\nThat storm is expected to sweep farther south starting Sunday, forecasters said, with snow up to 18 inches projected for the Minneapolis metro area and Duluth.\nRainfall of up to seven inches is expected across south Florida on Friday in a system that will stretch up the East Coast and bring up to four inches of rain expected to fall along the Interstate 95 corridor south of New York.\nFlood watches were issued for portions of southern Florida, New England and the Mid-Atlantic, with heavy rain and winds expected throughout Saturday in Miami, Washington D.C., New York City and Boston.\nAreas around the Sierra Nevada in California could experience snowfall up to 30 inches through the weekend starting Saturday, depending on elevation, AccuWeather reported .\nThunderstorms are expected across the South and Mid-Atlantic throughout the weekend and into early next week, the National Weather Service said, which could include “hail and a few tornadoes” among “stronger storms” in regions with a higher risk, including the lower Mississippi Valley and the Southeast.\nWhat To Watch For A winter storm will likely continue developing in the upper Midwest next week, affecting a region—known as “blizzard alley”—spanning from the Dakotas into western Minnesota, the agency said. Winds up to 45 miles per hour are expected in addition to other blizzard-like conditions. Thunderstorms, with winds up to 60 miles per hour, are forecast from Texas through Kansas starting late Sunday.\nBig Number 18. That’s how many states are under weather advisories, watches or warnings through Monday, according to the National Weather Service.\nSurprising Fact Less than a foot of snowfall was recorded in Minneapolis between December and February, two feet less than the city’s average during that period, according to CNN . The city is expected to break that total in three days.\nFurther Reading Parts Of Midwest Will See More Snow In Spring’s First Week Than All Of Winter ( CNN )\nTy Roush",

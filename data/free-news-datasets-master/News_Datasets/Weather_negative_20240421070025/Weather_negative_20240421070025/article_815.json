    "text": "First Alert Weather Day for a washout for Friday evening GREENVILLE, S.C. (FOX Carolina) - We are starting the weekend with a washout for your Friday evening plans, plus temperatures have us feeling more like February rather than March. A low pressure system moving up and out of the Gulf Coast brings widespread rain to the area for the later part of Friday. The widespread rain is going to washout your plans for Friday evening and into the night. Things don’t let up until early Saturday morning when some of the heaviest rain starts to die down. The rain becomes more scattered in nature Saturday morning, but you’ll still be playing dodge ‘em with showers on and off through mid afternoon Saturday as the rain slowly clears from west to east. The cold air wedge hasn’t been as strong as expected and has given way to some warmer temperatures across the western area. Most areas are still running a little below normal in the low 60s with little to no temperature fluctuation expected through the late afternoon. With the widespread rain and clouds overnight, lows only back off to the upper 40s to mid 50s. The winds kick up Friday evening as the low pressure system approaches. Winds gust 20 to 25 mph. But on the back side of the system, 30 to 35 mph are expected through the day Saturday. So even though the rain moves out mid afternoon, with the gusty winds and cloud cover sticking around, Saturday isn’t the nicest of days. Sunday gets everything back on track, with sunny skies taking over. Highs are around normal, peaking in the low to mid 60s. Next week starts off quiet with a mild and dry Monday. But the next chance for rain is right around the corner, moving in late Tuesday into Wednesday. This system looks to move in and out pretty quick, clearing out by Thursday. Copyright 2023 WHNS.

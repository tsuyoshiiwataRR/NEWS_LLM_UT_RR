    "text": "Cold front will bring flooding rains, damaging winds to South Florida through Saturday A blustery mix of [torrential rain](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/local/2024/02/19/cold-front-brought-record-rainfall-and-possibly-two-tornadoes/72656991007/) and damaging winds is forecast to thrash South Florida on Friday and Saturday with National Weather Service meteorologists predicting isolated flooding and a small risk of severe thunderstorms with [embedded tornadoes](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/local/2024/01/08/el-nino-creates-conditions-ripe-for-tornadoes-like-fort-lauderdale/72147747007/). The rain is expected to come in waves beginning Friday morning and last through at least midday Saturday, but forecasters cautioned the timing of the soggy tumult is uncertain with two areas of low pressure in the northern and southern Gulf of Mexico abrading the state. \"This rather complex disturbance will bring the potential for multiple rounds of heavy rainfall,\" wrote Miami-based NWS meteorologists in their forecast. \"Damaging wind gusts would be the primary concern, but a couple of tornadoes certainly can't be ruled out.\" Sustained winds of up to 30 mph with gusts up to 40 mph are possible along the east coast with rainfall totals averaging 2 to 4 inches, but possibly as high as 6 inches in some areas of South Florida. A flood watch and a wind advisory are in effect from Friday morning through Saturday evening. The atmospheric upheaval threatens to soak several weekend events, including the Palm Beach International Boat Show in West Palm Beach and the 32nd annual [Palm Beach Pride](https://compasslgbtq.com/palmbeachpride/), a two-day festival in Lake Worth Beach celebrating the LGBTQ community. While the storms should clear Sunday for Palm Beach Pride's main attraction — an hour-long parade that has nearly 100 groups participating this year — Saturday could see a soggy start. The festival will be held at Bryant Park noon to 6 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Julie Seaver, CEO of Palm Beach Pride sponsor Compass, said the event will take place rain or shine. \"We've got our rain ponchos because no one is going to wash out Palm Beach Pride,\" she said. \"We do have contingency plans, but hopefully the park with dry out in time. The West Palm Beach GreenMarket is closed Saturday for the Palm Beach International Boat Show. The Storm Prediction Center said a \"marginal\" risk — the lowest level on a 5-tier scale — of severe weather is possible along the Gulf Coast and from Lake Okeechobee through the Florida Keys on Friday and Saturday . West Palm Beach has had 4.5 inches of rain this month, according to the Southeast Regional Climate Center. That's 2.4 inches more than a normal March and sets it apart from other South Florida cities, which are either near normal or have a deficit of rain.

That broke a more than century-old record of 3.2 inches set in 1897. West Palm Beach weekend weather forecast Rain is expected through Saturday night even after the low pressure moves off the east coast of the state as an attached cool front filters through. High pressure builds in behind the front bringing \"dry and comfortable weather\" for most of next week, according to the National Weather Service. For Friday, rain chances increase from 70% in the morning to 100% in the evening with daytime high temperatures reaching about 80 degrees. Saturday's rain chances are 80% in the morning dropping to 30% at night. Daytime high temperatures on Saturday will again be near 80 degrees, but the overnight air will cool into the low 60s. Sunday should be sunny and breezy with a high of 78 degrees.

    "text": "By Ben Crnic ,\n16 minutes ago\nAhead of a strong storm system expected to bring a deluge of rain to the region, Westchester officials are warning residents to hunker down and prepare for flash flooding.\nIn an announcement on Friday, March 22, the Westchester County Department of Emergency Services advised residents to expect downpours beginning on Friday night and continuing through Saturday, March 23.\nRelated Report - Flood Threat Increases For Potent Storm With Heavy Rainfall, Gusty Winds Taking Aim At Region The upcoming storm system has prompted a Flood Watch to be issued in Westchester until Saturday at 10 p.m., and is predicted to bring a half-inch of rain every hour, officials said.\nThis will likely cause small rivers and streams in the county to overflow and cause flash flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas. Additionally, parkways such as the Bronx River and Saw Mill River Parkways will likely experience flooding from the heavy rain.\nBecause of this, officials warned residents to avoid driving on parkways if possible.\n\"Better yet, don’t drive in heavy rain if you don’t have to do so,\" officials added.\nThe department also gave tips to follow in case you encounter flooding at your home or on roads:\nIf you live in a basement apartment or in an area that often experiences flooding, make sure you are aware of the conditions around you to stay safe; Clear any catch basins and culverts of debris that could stop drainage during periods of heavy rain; Do not walk or drive through standing or moving water, and do not pass road closure barricades. Department of Emergency Services personnel will monitor conditions and be ready to help local communities throughout the storm, officials said.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

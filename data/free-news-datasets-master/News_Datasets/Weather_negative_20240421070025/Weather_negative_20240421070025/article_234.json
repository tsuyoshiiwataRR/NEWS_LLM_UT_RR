    "text": "WHAT WE'RE TRACKING: ALERT DAY Tonight and Friday for accumulating snow A Cool Saturday ALERT DAY Monday for heavy rain, windy conditions, and isolated thunderstorms PLANNING THE NEXT 24 HOURS: ALERT DAY conditions will develop after midnight, lasting through the morning hours on Friday. Snow, some heavy, will develop, peaking during the rush hour, and ending shortly after noon. 3-7\"+ of total accumulations are expected, with a narrow band of heavier amounts possible near and south of Madison. Temperatures will fall into the upper 20s Thursday night, and rise into the middle to upper 30s later Friday afternoon. EXTENDED FORECAST: A weather system overnight and Friday will bring snow back into southern Wisconsin. We have an ALERT DAY Thursday night/Friday morning due to the likelihood of accumulating snow. We are looking at generally 3 to 7 inches of snow in total, and tracking a southward shift in the heaviest band of snow, along with the possibility of a narrow band of slight higher snowfall totals. Areas near I-94 stand the better chances of this heavier band right now. We are first to warn about a potentially bigger weather system for later next weekend and early next work week that could feature a mixture of rain and snow along with windy conditions. We have another ALERT DAY in the forecast for Monday of next week for that system as well, although how much accumulation we will see from that system is very unclear at the moment. For now, expect snow showers to develop on Sunday and quickly transition to rain overnight. Monday should feature mostly rain, although it could be heavy at times, with windy conditions. Isolated thunderstorms are possible Monday afternoon. COPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. THIS MATERIAL MAY NOT BE PUBLISHED, BROADCAST, REWRITTEN OR REDISTRIBUTED.

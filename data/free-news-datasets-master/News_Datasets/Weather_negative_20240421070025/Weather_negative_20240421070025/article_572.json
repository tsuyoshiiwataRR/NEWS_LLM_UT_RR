    "text": "Vanderbilt baseball vs South Carolina game 1 postponed due to rain; to play doubleheader Saturday Aria Gerson Nashville Tennessean Vanderbilt baseball's Friday game against South Carolina has been postponed due to rain, according to a release .\nThe two teams are currently slated to play a doubleheader on Saturday at Founders Park in Columbia. The third-ranked Commodores (19-3, 3-0 SEC) are coming off a sweep of Auburn last week but are facing their first true road series of the season against the Gamecocks (16-5, 1-2).\nPer SEC rules, a doubleheader played on Saturday consists of two nine-inning games. If the two teams begin play on Saturday but are forced to suspend one of the games, that game will be resumed to nine innings Sunday followed by a seven-inning game.\nVanderbilt last played a doubleheader in 2022. The Commodores that season played two games in a day during the regional and also played a doubleheader against Hawaii. During their trip to Arkansas that same season, Vanderbilt resumed a suspended game followed by another game on the final day of the series. The Commodores' last true doubleheader during SEC play came in 2018 against Ole Miss.\nVanderbilt will need to make some tough decisions about its pitching with its upcoming series against Missouri starting on Thursday. The Commodores announced their normal probable rotation of Carter Holton, Bryce Cunningham and Devin Futrell, but the Friday game's cancellation means that if all three pitchers started like normal, Holton would be facing two days of short rest next week. Vanderbilt could choose to start Holton but limit the number of pitches he throws, or the Commodores could skip Holton's turn in the rotation either this week or next week.\nPOWER RANKINGS SEC baseball power rankings after Week 5: Vanderbilt, Mississippi State make statements\nAria Gerson covers Vanderbilt athletics for The Tennessean.

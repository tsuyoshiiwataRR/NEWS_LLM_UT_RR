    "text": "MIAMI - We're in for some wet and windy weather through Saturday.\nCBS News Miami's NEXT Weather Meteorologist KC Sherman stated on Saturday afternoon that the severe weather threats have ended for all of South Florida as drier air is now moving in, with the heaviest of the rain moving offshore.\nOn Friday night, the National Weather Service issued a Tornado Watch for all of South Florida through 3 a.m. Saturday and a Flash Flood Warning through 2 a.m. Saturday. The Tornado Watch for Monroe County was upgraded to a Tornado Watch on Saturday morning until noon.\nMiami-Dade, Broward, and Monroe Counties remained under a Flood Watch through 8 p.m. Saturday. As of Saturday morning, the Flood Watch in Miami-Dade County has been downgraded to a Flood Advisory â€” it was eventually canceled in the afternoon. The Flood Watch for Monroe County was also canceled Saturday afternoon.\nMiami-Dade and Broward were also under a Wind Advisory through Saturday evening.\nThis was due to a strong low-pressure system in the Gulf that brought rounds of rain from Friday through Saturday.\nThe National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center placed South Florida under a Level 1 risk of severe weather Friday with the potential for heavy rain , flooding, damaging gusty winds, small hail, and isolated tornadoes. The biggest concern was flooding but there was an elevated risk of strong damaging winds.\nSouth Florida could see three to five inches of rain with some areas getting as much as six inches. Periods of heavy rain were expected Friday. The highest accumulations are likely to be along and south of Alligator Alley where four to six inches are possible, according to the National Weather Service.\nThere was a marginal risk for severe thunderstorms on Friday and Saturday with the strongest storms expected across southern portions of the area.

    "text": "Friday night into early Saturday morning for slippery roads and low visibility. Henrietta, N.Y. â€” The Rush-Henrietta Central School District helped its students build new partnerships Friday, inviting local business leaders to a work industry breakfast and workshop. More than 80 representatives from businesses in Monroe County met with students to talk about ways they can have a successful future in a number of different industries. \"The biggest hope is for us to continue the conversation around how we can work interdependently to support each other, in terms of workforce development and economic development,\" said Barbara Mullen, superintendent of the Rush-Henrietta Central School District. \"I hope that industry leaders are able to meet with some wonderful youth, and that youth are able to learn in real time from business leaders, philanthropic leaders, and leaders in multiple different sectors and communities. (Hopefully), they'll be able to continue a partnership and chart a path forward.\" The event also included a discussion on the basic skills and qualities necessary to enter the workforce.",

    "text": "A band of heavy snow shifted south into the area leading to a Winter Storm Warning. Give yourself time for any commutes through the morning as slushy, wet snow will bring us impacts on the roads. A Winter Storm Warning will remain in effect through 4 p.m. with areas near US 20 to see an excessive of 6\" of snow. A heavy ban has lined up in our area bringing heavy, wet snow leading to slippery roads and little to no visibility. This activity will continue over the next several hours and conditions under the heavy ban are expected to deteriorate. Avoid traveling if you can. Totals near I-88 will be lower with an inch of slushy accumulations still possible. This all will move out into the late afternoon ahead of a dry evening. Sunny skies return for Saturday as temperatures remain in the 30s. There is a low chance for snow into Saturday night with a better chance moving in late Sunday. A rain and snow mix is possible with mostly widespread rain expected into Monday. Breeze winds will also arrive with winds gusting up to 35 mph. Showers will exit early Tuesday with the middle 50s returning by the end of next week.",

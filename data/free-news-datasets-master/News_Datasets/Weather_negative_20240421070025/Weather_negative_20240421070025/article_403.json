Environment Canada said the snow may have “a significant impact on the evening commute in urban areas.” They warn drivers should adjust their driving to changing road conditions as visibility may suddenly be reduced at times in heavy snow. “Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow,” Environment Canada said. - Partner of slain Toronto police officer to continue testifying at murder trial - Ontario extends program that helps rural and northern hospitals avoid ER closures - 5 shootings, 3 innocent people killed: Police in Peel Region now say they’re all linked - Ford and Trudeau governments ‘come to an agreement’ on Highway 413",

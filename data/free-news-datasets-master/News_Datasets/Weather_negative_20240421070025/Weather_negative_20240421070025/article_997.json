    "text": "Friday night into early Saturday morning for slippery roads and low visibility. Rochester, N.Y. (WHAM) — Monroe County released the findings Friday of its forensic review regarding the alleged mismanagement of federal funds that were earmarked for vital services in the area. Monroe County Executive Adam Bello says Community Resource Collaborative (CRC) received more than $1 million in COVID-19 relief funds from the county to distribute to several local agencies involved in the Neighborhood Collaborative Project (NCP). According to the forensic review, those organizations received roughly $750,000, but are still owed nearly $244,000. BACKGROUND: [Legislators threaten subpoenas for information into alleged mismanagement of ARPA funds](https://13wham.com/news/local/legislators-threaten-subpoenas-following-alleged-mismanagement-of-arpa-funds-crc-community-resource-collaborative-money-federal#) | [Rochester organizations voice concern over futures as critical federal funds remain frozen](https://13wham.com/news/local/rochester-organizations-voice-concern-over-futures-as-critical-federal-funds-remain-frozen#) The review also found that CRC co-mingled multiple funding streams in the same bank accounts, the ARPA funding, other grants, loans and lines of credit, but did not properly track what money came from where. Bello says in February, he learned some of the nonprofits involved in the NCP weren't being properly reimbursed. The funding was immediately frozen, and the county's forensic review started the next day. \"There are many victims here,\" Bello said during a press conference Friday. \"It's not just the county, but all of those organizations that are out there on the streets, all of the partner organizations of the NCP, and most importantly, the people that they're serving that really need the services.\" MORE: [Cameron Community still in 'crisis mode' amid federal funding freeze over CRC allegations](https://13wham.com/news/local/cameron-community-still-in-crisis-mode-amid-federal-funding-freeze-over-crc-allegations-money-arpa#) \"It's hard to assess, based on the record, whether it is mismanagement or fraud, because of all of the money moving in so many different directions,\" explained Monroe County Attorney John Bringewatt. \"There's a question to be asked. Because the county records were such a mess — is that deliberate? Or negligence? Those are the questions that will continue to be explored as this matter progresses.\" The forensic review has been sent to the FBI, U.S. Attorney's Office, NYS Attorney General's Office and the U.S. Treasury. Monroe County is now looking for a fiscal agent to distribute those ARPA funds. Tune into 13WHAM News at 10 and 11 tonight for more details from the review and Friday's press conference.",

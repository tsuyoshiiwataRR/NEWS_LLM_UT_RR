    "text": "ROCKFORD, Ill. â€” As of 10:30 a.m. on Friday, March 22, the City of Rockford has declared a citywide snow emergency. Parking on the even side is effective immediately. On Saturday, March 23, parking on the odd side begins at 8:00 a.m. Police will issue $60 parking tickets to vehicles that are parked on the wrong side of the street. If it's snowing, the City of Rockford says that it's safe to assume that the Odd/Even Parking is in effect. The area between 20th Street west to Kishwaukee Street, Harrison Avenue north to Rural Street has been problematic for the City Crews to plow during past storms because cars have been parked on both sides of the street. Residents are urged to move their vehicles either on the street or to the appropriate side of the street as specified by the odd/even parking. If your street is marked as \"No Parking\" on one side of the street, the Snow Emergency Declaration enables you to legally park in the restricted area during the time that the Snow Emergency Declaration is in effect. Don't assume that you can move your car when the street is plowed. Your car must remain parked appropriately until after the Snow Emergency has been lifted.",

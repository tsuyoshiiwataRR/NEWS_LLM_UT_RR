    "text": "Old Man winter returns: 2 inches of snow already with more on the way Published 5:48 pm Friday, March 22, 2024 After weeks of mostly mild weather this winter, snow returned to the area Thursday night, and a second round is expected to begin Saturday night. Snow measurements taken at the Albert Lea wastewater treatment plant state 2 inches of snow fell Thursday night. The National Weather Service as of 4 p.m. Friday was calling for 3 to 6 inches more of snow starting Saturday night and becoming widespread on Sunday. Email newsletter signup The snow could be mixed with rain. The weather agency states the storm is a dynamic system, and rain and snow amounts could change as the system draws closer. As of Friday afternoon a winter storm watch was issued for much of the area northwest of Albert Lea, though the city itself was not under a watch. That will likely change moving into Saturday. The weather agency states snow could be heavy at times Sunday afternoon and evening, and snowfall rates could exceed 1 to 2 inches per hour. Because temperatures will be in the lower 30s, it is expected that there will be a wet and heavy snow. On Sunday, temperatures will remain below freezing all day, so there should be no question about precipitation type that day. Moving into Monday, the weather agency was less confident in its forecast. While precipitation is expected to continue, warm air could lead to a rain and snow mix along Interstate 90. Snow could continue into Tuesday with a few more inches of precipitation possible.",

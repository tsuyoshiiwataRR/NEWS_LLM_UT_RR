    "text": "An area of low pressure sliding out of East Central Colorado and across Northern Kansas will bring significant wind to KAKEland as well as a chance of severe weather and even snowfall Sunday into Monday.\n User: Frank Waugh, CBM KAKE To: link Light and scattered showers are expected on the radar by late in the day Saturday and into early Sunday. the early rounds of rain will be soggy rather than severe. The chances for severe will increase across Western Kansas during the mid afternoon, roughly between US-83 and US-183.\nThis line of storms will eventually kick east advancing toward Wichita and the I-135 corridor during the evening and overnight hours.\nThe most likely threat with this line of storms will be large hail stones, possibly topping 1\" in diameter (quarter size). High wind gusts will also be possible, and they will increase in likelihood as the storms merge into a line.\nWhile the tornado threat is not zero, it is relatively low. Strong cells that develop early will need to be monitored closely with the threat dropping as the storms merge.\nThe severe weather threat will fade Sunday night into very early Monday morning. As this powerful area of low pressure, draws in cold air front the north, some snow can&apos;t be ruled out. Light accumulation not out of the question, especially across Northwest Kansas.\n Stay tuned for updates and alerts as the system approaches.\nWeâ€™ll keep you up to date with our Interactive Radar and LIVE weather coverage .

With the app you can track storms in your area, stream the latest forecast videos and live severe weather coverage, and set customized alerts to keep you and your family informed and safe.",

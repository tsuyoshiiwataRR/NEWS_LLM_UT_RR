    "text": "Rain plagues Miami: the entire day schedule at risk!\nby\nLORENZO CIOTTI\nIn 2024 we are still witnessing these scenes: the bad weather and rain that are plaguing Miami risk ruining today's entire race program. The Miami Open is under siege due to weather conditions that do not bode well today, Friday 22 March.\nThe tournament organizers are hoping for a respite from the bad weather to allow the matches to begin and save part of the match calendar scheduled for today. Unfortunately, the forecast for the next few hours is not at all positive and shows that it will continue to rain in Miami and, in the late afternoon, there will even be a further worsening of the climate.\nThe first matches on all the courts were postponed by at least two hours due to the incessant rain that hit the Florida city, as predicted.\nüåßÔ∏è Miami ne reprendra pas avant 19h en France √† cause de la pluie‚Äî TennisTemple (@tennistemple)\n[#miamiopen] [March 22, 2024]\nAll the day schedule is at risk due to rain\nA small glimmer of hope could open up in a few hours, but in that case there would be few matches that would be able to be played: according to the new ATP regulations, after 11pm the players will no longer be able to take to the court.\nIt is certainly not a lucky year for the locations of Miami and Indian Wells, which in this period are rarely hit by such strong storms.\nIn recent weeks the Californian tournament has had to deal with some moments of pause caused by rain, fortunately not too much long, and the same is now happening to the other 1000 tournament scheduled for March.\nToday, among others, Jannik Sinner, Daniil Medvedev, Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka should also be on the pitch, but all the attention is catalyzed by the match between Aryna Sabalenka and her friend Paula Badosa. A strange twist of fate pitted them against each other, a few days after the Belarusian suffered a serious loss following the death of her former boyfriend.",

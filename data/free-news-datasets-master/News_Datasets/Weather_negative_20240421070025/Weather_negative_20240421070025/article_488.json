The hamlet, which offers a stunning view of the Kanchenjunga, the Everest and some other peaks in the Himalayas, is a favourite spot among adventure-loving tourists visiting the Darjeeling hills. At least 40 tourists, including children, who got stranded at various homestays and hotels in Sandakphu due to the snowfall over the last few days, were evacuated by the Darjeeling district administration and police, the official said.

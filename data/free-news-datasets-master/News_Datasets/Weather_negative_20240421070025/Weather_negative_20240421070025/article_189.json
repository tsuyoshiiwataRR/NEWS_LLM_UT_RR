    "text": "The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), has said Nigeria is likely to witness extreme weather conditions judging from the current weather conditions experienced in various parts of the country.\nThis is even as the organisation called on Nigerians to be responsive to weather predictions released by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet).\nThe WMO representative, Bernard Gomez, disclosed this in Abuja on Thursday during the celebration of the 2024 World Meteorological Day with the theme “At the Frontline of Climate Action”.\nAccording to him: “This theme recognises the critical stage that we find ourselves with regards to severe weather and climate events caused by climate variability and change and the need for enhanced action to protect lives, property and livelihoods, among others.\n“The recent fluctuations in the weather witnessed in Nigeria, during this transition from dry to rainy season clearly demonstrate the extreme weather events that we can face across the country.\n“The shifting weather phenomena from heat waves, thunderstorms, and thick dust haze happening within a short period are indicative of a changing climate.”\nAlso speaking at the event, the director- general of NiMet, Prof. Charles Anosike assured Nigerians that through its observation stations, research, and training facilities, the agency will keep striving and innovating to deliver timely and reliable meteorological services to all socio-economic sectors and emphasised the need for Nigerians to be resilient.\nHe said, “Climate change poses an existential threat to our planet, exacerbating extreme weather events, disrupting ecosystems, and endangering vulnerable communities. In the face of these challenges, it has become imperative that we increase our efforts towards building a weather and climate-resilient society, enhance our preparedness for weather-related disasters, and promote sustainable development practices at all levels of government.”\nHe also called for sustained awareness and continuous education on climate and climate change related issues.",

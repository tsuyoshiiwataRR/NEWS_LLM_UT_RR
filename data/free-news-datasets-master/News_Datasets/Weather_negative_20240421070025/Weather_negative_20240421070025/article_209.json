    "text": "By Catalina Gonella ,\n2 hours ago People walk through the rain in Midtown Manhattan. New York City is expected to get between two and three inches of rain on Saturday with the potential for localized flash flooding during heavy downpours in the morning and afternoon, according to the National Weather Service’s New York office.\n“Unfortunately, for those that like to get outdoors on their weekends, this will be the third in a row that looks to be a fairly substantial amount of rain, to the local tristate,” meteorologist Dominic Ramunni said.\nThe rain is expected to enter the area overnight Friday into Saturday, the NWS said. Between the downpour and potential for flooding, Ramunni recommended New Yorkers stay inside.\n“If you don't have to go outside on Saturday, it might be best to stay indoors, just enjoy the rainy day,” Ramunni said.\nAs the rain tapers off Saturday night, strong winds will start to pick up into Sunday. Temperatures will hover around 50 degrees for the weekend.\n“We'll sort of trade the rain for the wind, so it's looking like a pretty, pretty active weekend,” he added.\nTemperatures for the second half of March are expected to be cooler than the first half, which was 10 degrees warmer than normal on average, Ramunni said. Things will warm up heading into April and into the rest of spring.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "7 Day Forecast Bay Area residents should enjoy the first week of spring and blue skies for now because this weekend it will be back to blustery rain and possible thunderstorms, according to the National Weather Service. Rain and strong winds will begin on Friday and continue through Saturday in all parts of the greater Bay Area – the North, East and South Bay, the Peninsula, and Monterey and Santa Cruz counties – with chances of thunderstorms, the weather service said. Things will taper off on Sunday, though thunderstorms are possible early in the morning and winds will stay strong, with gusts up to 30 mph. Despite the return of precipitation, the weather service has designated the effects of the rain as minor. The rain could accumulate up to 2 inches on parts of the coast by the end of the weekend, but will be between a quarter-inch and 1.5 inches in other regions. People are also reading… Roadways will be wet and downed branches from the wind are also possible, which could mean power outages, according to the weather service.

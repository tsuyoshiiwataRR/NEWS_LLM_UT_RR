New York: Plane skids off snowy runway in Rochester As [a deadly winter storm](/news/weather/132013/winter-storm-warning-snow-forecast-maps-us-weather) makes its way across the Great Lakes on Friday, those traveling on highways in the Midwest are facing dangerous conditions, especially in [Minnesota](/latest/minnesota). Minnesota State Police reported that 175 crashes occurred during a 13-hour period from Thursday night into Friday morning statewide. Nineteen of those crashes involved injuries, and one involved a fatality. A 54-year-old man was killed on Interstate 90 in Manchester Township on Thursday night due to icy conditions, police said. Another 101 vehicles have also spun out on roads, highway police said. The Midwest was forecast to see up to six inches of [snow](/latest/snow) on Friday, covering several highways and interstates in the region.

Some areas in the region may even see “thundersnow,” with snow rates at one to two inches per hour. FOX Weather Winter Storm Specialist Tom Niziol said: “The system is so strong in the mid-levels of the atmosphere that we’re getting thundersnow reported across the area. “The Storm Prediction Center just put out a discussion referring to the fact that we’ve got a lot of deep convection going on with that thundersnow. That’s why you’re going to see these snowfall rates.” If traveling this morning, many highways in WisDOT's Northwest Region are either snow covered or have slippery stretches. Give yourself extra time to get to your destination and don't forget to buckle up.— WisDOT Northwest Region (@WisDOTnorthwest) [pic.twitter.com/v9nvjFO3bY] [March 22, 2024] States under winter weather advisories on Friday include Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and [Iowa](/latest/iowa). While snow is expected to end by Friday night as sub-zero temperatures set in, an even stronger winter storm is forecast for the Midwest early next week. The current storm will move into the Northeast Friday night into Saturday, bringing intense, heavy rain. Winter storm warnings are already in effect across portions of the interior Northeast and northern New England that may see heavy snow from the system.

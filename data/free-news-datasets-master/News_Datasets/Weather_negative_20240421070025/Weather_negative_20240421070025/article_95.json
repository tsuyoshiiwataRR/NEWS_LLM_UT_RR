    "text": "Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible which could produce large hail and strong winds. Expect heavy rainfall and lightning. RANGER, Texas â€” Two 18-year-olds died, and a 19-year-old was severely injured in a car crash near Ranger. The three victims were all from Abilene: 18-year-old Brandon Woods, 18-year-old Annabelle Neely, and 19-year-old Kaiden Newby. The crash happened just after 7 a.m. today on Interstate 20, just east of Ranger. Brandon Woods was driving a PT Cruiser, heading west on I-20 and steered off the left side of the roadway into the center median, officials with the Texas Department of Public Safety reported. Woods continued driving in the median and vaulted into Russell Creek. The car landed on the front side, partially ejecting the front right passenger, and completely ejecting the passenger in the back seat. It is unknown at this time why the driver veered into the median. Although the cause of the crash is still under investigation, it was cloudy and the roads were wet when the crash happened. \"This is the time of year we have the April showers and we have these fast moving storms that are coming in,\" said Sergeant Marc Couch with the Texas Department of Public Safety. \"People just need to really recognize the fact that weather really changes the roadways. You cannot continue to just put your cruise control on and drive at the maximum speed. Most people are speeding, I hate to say that, but the speed limit is not a suggestion, it is the law. People need to start following that.\" Sgt. Couch says it's important for drivers of all ages to be vigilant about taking extra precautions when on the road. \"I would just encourage people to follow the law and to do everything they can to try to end the streak in Texas by being safe and making sure they make their driving a priority to get to your destination,\" said Sgt. Couch. \"This is the most traumatic thing that can happen in someone's life and it can really change people's life's forever when you lose a father, a mother, a child in this situation. These young people are somebody's children and grandchildren.\" Sgt. Couch said that throughout his many years of patrolling the highways, it never gets easier seeing teens lose their lives on the roadways. \"We hate to see someone die,\" said Sgt. Couch. \"It's the worst job that we have, having to go to someone's house and tell them that a loved one has passed away.\"",

    "text": "2024-01-10T15:04:47+00:00\nA-\nA\nA+\n/ A violent winter storm swept part of the United States on Wednesday, causing severe storms in the south and killing three people, according to local authorities.\nStrong winds and snow storms also hit the north of the country, and electricity was cut off to hundreds of thousands of homes.\nHeavy rains caused floods and strong winds likely to exceed 80 kilometers per hour, in addition to the outbreak of thunderstorms on the east coast of the United States, according to the US Meteorological Service.\nIn an interview with local media, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy warned against underestimating the danger of the storm, which he described as “unusual.”\nDeteriorating weather conditions prompted Vice President Kamala Harris’ US Air Force plane to be diverted to Dulles International Airport in Virginia, instead of landing at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.\nAt least three people were killed in the storm that took place in the south of the country, according to local authorities.\nThis winter storm also dumped significant amounts of snow on the north-central part of the country, gradually affecting the Great Lakes region, according to the NWS.\nPower was cut off to more than 890,000 homes as of Tuesday evening, especially in the east of the country, according to a tracking website.\nIn the United States, as in the rest of the world, weather forecasting has become more difficult due to climate change.",

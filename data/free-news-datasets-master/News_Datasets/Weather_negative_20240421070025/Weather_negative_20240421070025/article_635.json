    "text": "A significant winter storm is headed to Maine for Saturday with heavy snow, mix, and rain expected through the day. Travel is likely to be impacted. Friday will be nice and quiet, and a lot less windy. Weâ€™ll see sunshine the first half of the day with more clouds through the afternoon. Highs will be in the mid to upper 30s. Timing Snow will begin very early Saturday, in the 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. timeframe. Snow, mix, and rain will continue the entire day, wrapping up between 10 p.m. Saturday and 1 a.m. Sunday morning. Totals This storm will be a big dump of snow in the mountains, with 8 to 14 inches or more of snow there. Twenty inches or even 2 feet of snow is not out of the question in isolated spots. For the foothills through portions of central Maine, sleet or freezing rain will cut into snow totals. Five to 9 inches are expected there. For the coastal plain, 3 to 6 inches of snow is most likely before a switch to mix and then plain rain. Along the coast, only a couple inches or so is expected, as precipitation will quickly switch to rain. Type In the mountains, the precipitation will be light, powdery snow. For the foothills, lakes region, and central Maine the snow will change to sleet or freezing rain, so heavier, sloppier snow is expected. Along the coast things will turn very slushy as the snow changes over to rain. Quieter weather looks to return for Maine Maple Sunday with temperatures in the mid to upper 30s for the afternoon. The weather looks good for any maple festivities going on across the state. Quiet weather continues into next week. Our next chance of showers looks to arrive towards mid-week, but there is a lot of uncertainty on when we see our next chance of rain returning.",

The rain comes courtesy of a developing area of low pressure that will track along the northern Gulf coast Friday. This system will throw waves of rain, heavy at times, into SWFL starting this morning and lasting through the afternoon, the evening, the overnight and right on through much of our Saturday. Rain totals in the 1\"- 3\" range will be common by the time the rain ends Saturday, though locally higher amounts up to and over 5\" will be possible, leading to the potential for flooding.

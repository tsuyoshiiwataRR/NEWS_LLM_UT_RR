    "text": "2024-03-22 00:19:57\nThe heat wave that has affected Latin America since the start of the year caused the felt temperature to rise to a record high of 62.3°C degrees Celsius in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil this weekend, while rain threat in the south of the country.\n“Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun. Hydrate yourself!”, Rio’s municipal alert system warned on west, after 60.1°C the day before, a record since this type of measurement began in 2014.\nThe western area of Rio is made up of poor, outlying and poorly served neighborhoods, where more than 40% of the population of this city of more than six million inhabitants lives.\nWith a maximum real temperature of 42°C on Sunday, the felt temperature rose to the highest even in the residential area of the Botanical Garden in the south of Rio, privileged with its numerous vegetation and where the felt temperature rose to 57.7° C Sunday.\n“I am very afraid that it will get worse, because the population is increasing a lot and deforestation is very significant due to the increase in the number of housing units,” she added.\nEmblematic of Rio, the beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana were packed with people on Sunday. Many have also found refuge in Tijuca Park, a real green lung in the city.\nIn Sao Paulo, the largest city in South America with double the population of Rio, more than 12 million, Saturday was the hottest day of the year with the mercury rising to 34.7° vs.\nThis is the highest temperature for a month of March since the Brazilian National Meteorological Institute (Inmet) began measuring it in 1943.\nSunday brought barely perceptible relief: the thermometer fell back to 34.3 oC, at the level of the previous record for a month of March recorded in 2012.\nHere again, the parks of Brazil’s most populous metropolis were full. Many also set out to attack the coast, causing huge traffic jams at the city gates, to the point of forming a line of 20 kilometers of cars, according to local media.\nFloods in the south\nIn the south of Brazil, on the contrary, it is rain that threatens. Extreme rainfall is expected to continue this week, authorities warned.\n“The week will be at high risk of heavy rain and thunderstorms in south-central Brazil,” weather information agency MetSul warned on Sunday. “The most concerning system is a very intense cold front that will arrive with torrential rain and possible gales,” she added.\nSome localities in the state of Rio Grande do Sul are recording “exceptionally high” volumes of precipitation. In Uruguaiana, the most affected city in the state, broadcast images of flooded streets and buses half in water.\nUp to 500 millimeters of water could fall, according to MetSul, while in February the state of Rio Grande do Sul was suffocating with heat due to an “extreme heat dome” from Argentina.\nExperts attribute these extreme phenomena and meteorological instability to climate change and the El Niño phenomenon which affects the southern cone of Latin America, in the middle of summer, causing forest fires in Chile.\nThe current climate has already warmed by around 1.2°C compared to 1850-1900, causing an increase in episodes of drought, floods and heat waves.\n1711073671\n#rise #ocean #levels #experienced #jump\nRelated posts:\nBrazilian experts tell their experiences and impressions about the Samsung Galaxy S23 5G line Elden Ring players have found a PvP build that is almost unstoppable Pantera Wireless Headset, the perfect headset for Gamers News | Four astronauts back on Earth aboard a SpaceX capsule Hipgnosis, pioneer of music catalogs, sees its management challenged by its shareholders the mystery of the Great Eruption of Eta Carinae in the 19th century The Deflationary Effect: Uncovering the Changes in Ethereum's Economic Model Post-Merge Windows 11: new build adds Copilot, SMB client encryption and more in the Canary channel",

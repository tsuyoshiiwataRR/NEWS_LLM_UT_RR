    "text": "Naples residents warned of potential flooding As heavy rainfall is expected to hit Naples, city officials are urging residents to take precautions against potential flooding. With more than 7 and a half inches of rain expected in the coming days, the National Weather Service has issued a [ flood watch](https://www.nbc-2.com/article/heavy-rain-and-potentially-severe-storms-are-expected-friday-through-saturday/60269290) effective Thursday until Saturday at 8 p.m. The Director of Public Works for the City of Naples, Bob Middleton, confirmed that crews were working on clearing out drains across the city. Middleton asked the public to help, if possible, by removing debris from inlet structures near their homes to facilitate drainage after the rain. Areas with poor drainage are particularly at risk of flooding, posing a threat to both property and public safety. City officials are advising residents to not drive through flooded areas to avoid potential damage to cars and lower risks associated with floating debris. Bill Runzel, a resident living along a canal near downtown Naples, recounted the devastation he witnessed during Hurricane Ian. \"We had the big surge come up the river and probably put 4 to 5 feet of water through here and wiped out anybody that wasn't above flood elevation,\" he said. While this weekend's rainfall is expected to be a fraction of what was experienced during the hurricane, Runzel and others living near bodies of water are urged to remain vigilant and prepared to take action in the event of flooding.",

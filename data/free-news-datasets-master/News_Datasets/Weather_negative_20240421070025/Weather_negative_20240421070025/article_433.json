    "text": "Impact Day: Heavy Morning Snow Heaviest snow expected Friday morning Impact Day: Heavy Morning Snow Heaviest snow expected Friday morning AND THAT IS YOUR LOOK AT MORNING SPORTS. I’M DARIO MELENDEZ I HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT FRIDAY WEATHER RIGHT NOW ON THIS IMPACT DAY. JUNEAU. IT IS GOING TO BE A MESSY MORNING COMMUTE WITH THAT HEAVY WET SNOW FALLING MATT SALEMME ALREADY SHOWING US THOSE CONDITIONS. IT’S ROUGH OUT THERE. YEAH, I MEAN, YOU GOT WET, HEAVY SNOW COMING DOWN AT A PRETTY GOOD RATE. IT’S GOING TO BE TOUGH TO KEEP ON TOP OF IT. SO WE STILL HAVE A COUPLE MORE HOURS OF THAT TO GO. IT IS A WHITE SCENE AT CATHEDRAL SQUARE. WE’VE GOT VISIBILITIES AT ABOUT A HALF MILE. IN MILWAUKEE, 31 DEGREES. SO CLEARLY IT IS JUST BELOW FREEZING. THE SNOW IS WET AND HEAVY AND IT IS ACCUMULATING. WE DO HAVE CONTINUOUS BANDS OF THIS POCKET OF MODERATE AND HEAVY SNOW CONTINUING ACROSS ALL OF SOUTHEASTERN WISCONSIN. AT TIMES YOU’LL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAK AND THEN IT’LL KIND OF INTENSIFY ONCE AGAIN. RIGHT NOW, THE HEAVIEST OF THE BANDS ARE KIND OF NEAR THAT I-94 CORRIDOR, JUST KIND OF WEST OF MADISON, MOVING EASTWARD ALONG 94 TOWARDS WAUKESHA MILWAUKEE UP TOWARDS A LITTLE BIT OF PORT WASHINGTON RIGHT NOW. BUT YOU CAN SEE BY HARTFORD, THEY’VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A POCKET OF SOME QUIETER WEATHER. ALSO DOWN JUST TO THE SOUTH. OF BURLINGTON. ALSO HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF SOME QUIETER WEATHER AT THE MOMENT, BUT WE STILL HAVE PLENTY MORE HOURS OF THE SNOWFALL TO GO. THAT’S SNOW STRETCHES ALL THE WAY OFF TOWARDS WEST OF WATERLOO, IOWA, AND THIS IS YET TO ARRIVE HERE, SO YOU GET AN IDEA. IT’S NOT JUST THE MORNING, IT’S ALSO TO ABOUT 12 1:00. THAT WILL STILL HAVE THAT SNOW CONTINUE. 7:00 FURTHER UP TO THE NORTH. I THINK WE’LL HAVE MORE LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS OR EVEN PERHAPS SOME FLURRIES FURTHER ALONG IN SOUTH OF 94, THE SNOW WILL CONTINUE. AND THEN AS WE HEAD TOWARDS ABOUT 9 OR 10:00, EVEN BY THE LAKESHORE, WITH WINDS CONTINUING, KIND OF OFF THE LAKE, THIS MODEL SHOWING IN THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME LAKE INFLUENCE AS WELL AS WE GET TO ABOUT TEN 11:00 MORE OF THAT MODERATE AND SOME HEAVY SNOW CONTINUING AS WE WRAP THINGS UP HERE AROUND ONE 2:00, SNOW WILL START TO END FROM NORTH, MOVING DOWN TO THE SOUTH AS COLDER AIR FILTERS IN ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE SYSTEM. WIND SHIFTING IN HERE FROM THE NORTH. ADDITIONALLY, THINKING ABOUT ANOTHER ONE 1 TO 3IN OF SNOW, HIGHEST TOTALS WILL BE CLOSER TOWARDS THE STATE LINE WITH LESSER TOTALS UP TOWARDS THE NORTH. MAYBE ANOTHER INCH OR SO UP TOWARDS THE NORTH. STILL. EITHER WAY, THE MAJORITY OF US WILL LIKELY PICK UP SEVERAL INCHES BY THE TIME WE’RE ALL SAID AND DONE. FROM NOW UNTIL 8:00. STILL, THAT SLICK RUSH HOUR COMMUTE, THE HEAVY SNOWFALL WILL LIKELY BE HERE. BETWEEN 8 A.M. AND 1:00, AND THEN BETWEEN 1 AND 3. THE SNOW WILL QUICKLY DIMINISH WITH MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF SOME MELTING AS TEMPERATURES WARM UP ABOVE FREEZING THREE, 3 TO 10. THAT’S THE TEMPERATURES START TO FALL DOWN INTO THE EVENING HOURS. WE’LL START TO SEE SOME OF THAT REFREEZE ON THE ROAD. SO PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO DO SOME SHOVELING. AS YOU HEAD BACK FROM WORK THIS EVENING BEFORE THE SNOW TURNS INTO KIND OF A BLOCK OF ICE OF 6.7IN, WE TYPICALLY SEE FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH, WE HAD YET TO SEE ANYTHING, JUST A TRACE. AND THAT WAS THROUGH YESTERDAY. CLEARLY WE’RE GOING TO BE ADDING A LITTLE BIT TO THAT TODAY. TOTAL ACCUMULATIONS ABOUT 3 TO 6IN AREA WIDE, SLIGHTLY HIGHER TOTALS ACROSS THE FAR NORTH COULD THERE BE PERHAPS SOME EMBEDDED HIGHER TOTALS WITHIN THIS BAND? YES. HOWEVER, I STILL THINK THAT WE’LL HAVE A KIND OF A WIDESPREAD AREA OF 3 TO 6IN. SO AFTER TODAY WE WILL QUIET THINGS OUT HERE ON SATURDAY 34 BACK TO 40 ON SUNDAY, A CHANCE OF A LITTLE RAIN SNOW MIX. TODAY IS AN IMPACT DAY. WANT TO TAKE SOME EXTRA TIME ON THE ROADWAYS, ESPECIALLY THIS MORNING. THEN WE START TO WARM. THINGS UP AS WE HEAD INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. UP INTO THE 50S WITH SOME RAIN SHOWERS ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THE SYSTEM MOVES OUT OF HERE. SOME COOLER AIR FILLS IN BEHIND IT, BUT THE SUN DOES RETURN WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. HIGHS BACK INTO THE LOWER AND MID 40S OVERALL, JUST A DAY OF WINTER. A LITTLE BIT COOL WEATHER TO START OFF THE WEEKEND AND THEN Advertisement Impact Day: Heavy Morning Snow Heaviest snow expected Friday morning A Winter Weather Advisory has been issued for all southeastern Wisconsin cities until 4 p.m. on Friday.Friday will be an Impact Day, with snowfall expected to affect the entire area.

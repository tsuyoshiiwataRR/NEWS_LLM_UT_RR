    "text": "More than a foot of snow possible in northern New Hampshire; expect mostly rain in southern spots It will be chilly, breezy and relatively quiet Friday ahead of what should be a stormy Saturday featuring snow, a wintry mix and rain. A winter storm warning is in effect for the White Mountains and the Great North Woods, while a winter storm watch is posted for Merrimack, Belknap and Strafford counties. >> [National Weather Service alerts and bulletins](https://www.wmur.com/alerts) Meanwhile, in areas expected to see the most rain from this system â€” portions of Strafford, Rockingham and Hillsborough counties, a flood watch is in effect. TIMING The precipitation should begin late Friday night and into Saturday morning. Travel looks to be slippery for much of the day Saturday up north. Travelers in southern areas will have to contend with slippery roads due to snow and mixing early then road ponding the rest of the day due to the heavy rain. All precipitation will wrap up by midnight Saturday night. >> [See the hour-by-hour timeline for Saturday](http://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-hourly-weather-322/60276459): -- SNOW & RAIN PROJECTIONS The precipitation will begin as snow in most areas, but expect a changeover to rain in central and southern areas, especially toward the Seacoast. It will stay all snow in northern New Hampshire. There, expect a foot of snow or more. Just south, from Plymouth down through Lebanon to Laconia, there's a chance for 6 to 12 inches. This is the trickiest area and where the uncertainty in snowfall projections remains. How much snow accumulates depends on just how long the snow hangs on and how far north the changeover to rain occurs. It looks like we could see 3-6 inches south of the Lakes Region with 1-3 inches through Manchester and coasting to an inch towards the coast. Much of these amounts will wash away after the switchover to heavy rain. There could be 1-2 inches of rain in areas where the rain holds on the longest. LOOKING AHEAD On Sunday, the clouds clear behind that storm, and we'll see some sun. Highs will be in the low 40s. Skies will be mostly clear Monday, with highs in the low 40s.

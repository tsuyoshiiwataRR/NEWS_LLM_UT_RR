    "text": "A cold front approaching San Francisco from the northwest will bring rain and cold temperatures to The City, with the dreary conditions expected to last most of this weekend. The inclement springtime weather is expected to return midway through next week following a brief respite. Dylan Flynn, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service Bay Area , told The Examiner that the month of March represents one of San Francisco’s last big chances at rainfall before the end of the water year on Sept. 30. The month of April will mark a transition to much drier conditions in May, he said. “We’re still kind of in the tail end of the rainy season here so this is not out of the ordinary,” Flynn said. Through Thursday night, San Francisco had recorded nearly 22 inches of rainfall during the water year beginning Oct. 1, according to the agency. That amounted to 113% of the March 21 normal, and nearly 96% of normal for the full water year. This weekend’s storms won’t be a deluge by any means, according to NWS projections. San Francisco is expected to get anywhere from a half-inch to an inch of rain. Ex // Top Stories Now in his 70s, the legendary author, inventor and futurist revisits his prediction of the melding of human and machine, with 20 additional years of data in tow An executive directive issued by Mayor London Breed would create a screening process to identify vulnerable concrete buildings and update The City's existing building code. City Attorney David Chiu accused the East Bay city of trying to increase its airport’s passenger traffic and profits with the move “We don’t expect major flooding concerns or anything like that,” Flynn said. “Just kind of a dreary day with cooler weather and some wind and periods of rain.” San Franciscans will see rain for several hours beginning Friday night, as well as some winds blowing out of the south . Flynn said Saturday’s weather conditions will be different, as the cold front will have already passed over The City. “We’ll switch to more showers, but they’re gonna be spotty,” Flynn said. Some of these showers, he added, could develop into stronger precipitation. There is also a slight chance of thunderstorms. Flynn said NWS meteorologists expect another cold front to return to The City next Wednesday, bringing similar conditions. “That looks like it’s gonna be a little less impactful,” Flynn said. “It’s another cold front that comes through and brings mostly beneficial rain to the area.”",

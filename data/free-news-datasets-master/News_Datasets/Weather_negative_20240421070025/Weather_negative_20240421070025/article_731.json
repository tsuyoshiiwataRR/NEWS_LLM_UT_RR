    "text": "A 21-year-old man was arrested after he entered a vacant home Thursday to escape the rain, according to a police report. At about 6:15 p.m., Denton police responded to a burglary in progress call from the 1400 block of North Austin Street. A 21-year-old man was arrested after he entered a vacant home Thursday to escape the rain, according to a police report. At about 6:15 p.m., Denton police responded to a burglary in progress call from the 1400 block of North Austin Street. The caller said they saw someone go through the window of a vacant house. The caller provided a suspect description. When officers arrived at the home, the report states they saw multiple windows that appeared to have been slid open. Officers entered the home and found a man matching the caller’s description in the bathroom. They detained the man and conducted a security sweep on the rest of the house. The report states that the man told officers he figured no one lived there and wanted to avoid the rain. He said, “It rained again, so I came back here today,” according to the report. This caused the officers to believe he has entered the house more than once. Officers contacted the home owner, who said they would like to press charges. The man was arrested and charged with criminal trespass of a habitation. For an individual to be charged with burglary, the individual must have intended to commit a felony, theft or assault. From 12:01 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. Thursday, the Denton Police Department handled 386 service and officer-initiated calls and made 11 arrests. Success!

    "text": "The latest report shows that the ocean surface is increasingly concerning due to strong El Nino and climate change, according to a long-term sea level data set. Rising sea levels can affect low-lying areas. Experts found that El Nino significantly accelerated global sea level rise from 2022 to 2023. In the recent [NWN report](https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/60957/20240313/rapid-seawater-rise-threatens-low-lying-communities-cartagena-colombia.htm), the rapid rise in seawater threatens communities in Cartagena, Columbia. Researchers discovered that the area could suffer from significant sea level rise due to [increasing global warming](https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/61041/20240320/un-warns-2024-high-probability-break-record-hot-year.htm) and volcanic formations in the region, resulting in a devastating sinking of land. Ocean Surface, Sea Level Rise Due to Strong El Nino A NOAA report explains that increasing sea levels can suffer more from deadly storm surges and severe weather conditions. People in low-lying communities are more vulnerable to potential risks. In the latest study, a long-term sea level data set was analyzed based on 30 years of satellite observations, with the help of the French TOPEX/Poseidon mission, and the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich mission. The urgency to understand the sea level impacts is crucial amidst the growing threats of climate change and global warming. \"During La Niña, rain that normally falls in the ocean falls on the land instead, temporarily taking water out of the ocean and lowering sea levels,\" Josh Willis, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, said, as quoted in a [report](https://phys.org/news/2024-03-analysis-spike-global-sea-due.html#:~:text=Global%20average%20sea%20level%20rose,the%20course%20of%20a%20year.). The study findings showed that about four inches have been recorded in the rise of the global average sea level since 1993. The researchers pointed out that the rates of acceleration can increase by 2050. Alarmingly, the rapid rise of water can cause more [frequent and devastating flooding](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/swot/nasa-analysis-finds-strong-el-nino-could-bring-extra-floods-this-winter/). From 2022 to 2023, the global sea level increased due to the El Niño phenomenon. La Niña and El Niño can impact seasonal patterns of rainfall, causing frequent warm-ups or precipitation. \"El Niño years, a lot of the rain that normally falls on land ends up in the ocean, which raises sea levels temporarily,\" Willis said.

With sea levels and warming events, low-lying buildings can become more vulnerable. Additionally, as a result of greenhouse gas emissions, climate change can cause frequent storms, floods, wildfires, heatwaves, and droughts, among other severe to extreme weather events. As a result, mitigating climate change impacts is important for the planet to prevent the rapid rise of seawater.

    "text": "It may be spring, but rain showers, cool temperatures and windy gusts could have you double-checking the calendar this weekend.\n“It will feel like a cold winter day in the middle of March,” National Weather Service meteorologist Mark Moede said.\nAfter a cool, partly cloudy Friday with temperatures in the 60s and low 70s, about a tenth to a third inch of rain is anticipated in Orange County and the Inland Empire starting on Saturday, through the evening and into Sunday. Temps should stay in the low to mid 60s.\nUp to an inch of rain could reach the San Bernardino Mountains over the weekend, with half an inch to three-quarters of an inch more likely. About 2 to 6 inches of snow is expected at 4,000- and 5,000-foot elevations by Sunday, which will impact roads.\nIn Los Angeles County, high temperatures should only reach the upper 50s to mid 60s. Light rainfall is likely between Saturday and Sunday, with an estimated quarter inch or less in coastal and valley areas, National Weather Service meteorologist David Gomberg said. Los Angeles area mountains may see a quarter to about half an inch of rain, with 1 to 4 inches of snow in areas above 4,000 feet.\nWind gusts expected in coastline and mountain areas could reach 30 to 50 miles per hour, forecasters said, though lesser elsewhere.\nSince Oct. 1, rainfall totals have exceeded previous seasons. In Downtown Los Angeles, 19 inches of rain has been recorded so far, about 6 and a half inches above normal. In Long Beach, where the rainfall average is 11 inches, roughly 17 inches of rain has been recorded this season.\nRelated Articles Crime and Public Safety | Man with BB gun hijacks Metro bus in downtown LA Crime and Public Safety | California is clearing criminal records — including violent crimes — to offer second chances Crime and Public Safety | Motorcyclist dies after crash with car, train in Long Beach Crime and Public Safety | No crime wave caused by new ‘zero-bail,’ LA court official says, but advocates say rules not evenly applied Crime and Public Safety | Street vendor in Long Beach neighborhood shot, killed",

    "text": "Cold snaps could worsen springtime allergies The cold, dry air can cause nasal tissue swelling. NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - The quick spells of colder air may seem like a sigh of relief for allergy sufferers, but doctors say it could actually do more harm to your nasal passages, creating worse-feeling allergies this time of year. It’s not uncommon to get cold snaps of overnight low temperatures falling to around freezing in mid-March here in Middle Tennessee. In fact, our last average freeze is around April 1st. But while the cold air does help lower the pollen count, it can be counterproductive to our bodies preventing those allergies by increasing nasal tissue swelling. This can create an increase in drainage, congestion and sneezing. Doctors say the best way to prevent worsening allergies in the midst of these cold snaps is to limit your exposure outside, especially in the evening once the temperature begins to drop. The cold, dry air is the cause of nasal tissue swelling. Sleeping with a humidifier can also help combat the dry air you’re breathing in. Copyright 2024 WSMV. All rights reserved.",

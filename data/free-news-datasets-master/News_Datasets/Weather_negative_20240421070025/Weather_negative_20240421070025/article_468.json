    "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Michigan — The snow is coming down fast and hard this morning and is [ expected to continue ](/article/weather/forecast/weather-forecast/69-19905200)at this rate into the early evening hours. Here's this morning's breakdown: TIMING Snowfall began this morning and will continue at a consistent rate into the midafternoon hours for the greater Grand Rapids region. Snow will taper off from NW to SE starting at 6 p.m. and should be nearly done by 9 p.m. A few lighter snow showers are possible between 9 p.m. and midnight but do not look to bring additional impacts. SNOWFALL TOTALS 4 to 8 inches of heavy, wet snow is expected by day's end. We have already picked up a quick inch along our lakeshore counties and that trend is expected to continue throughout the day. We are expecting the highest snowfall totals to surround the I-96 corridor. This is where 6 to 8 inches should be anticipated, including Ottawa, Kent and Muskegon counties. The closer you get to US-10, the closer the totals will get to the 4-inch range. The I-94 corridor is expected to warm above freezing this afternoon. This could cause some of the snowfall to turn to rain, but also could cause it to melt. This will lower the impacts in those areas. IMPACTS Main impacts are expected on our roadways throughout the morning and evening commute. Because this is wet snow, we are expecting roads to become slushy and snow-covered. Winds will not be a problem with this system and remain relatively calm throughout the day. Visibility will be reduced at times within the heavier bands of snowfall. Due to this being heavy and wet snow, we could see isolated power outages throughout the day. THE WEEKEND Snow ends overnight tonight and skies will begin to clear into the weekend. This will lead to mostly sunny skies throughout your Saturday and Sunday starts sunny with increasing cloud coverage. Temperatures remain in the 30s all weekend long, so snow will stick around. Next week brings warmer conditions and rainfall that will likely melt much of the snow away. ►Make it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this.

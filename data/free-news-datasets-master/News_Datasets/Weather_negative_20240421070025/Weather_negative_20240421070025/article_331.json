(KWQC) -- A First Alert Day is in effect from until 2PM for accumulating snow along and north of I-80. The system will track a little more south than what models laid out the last few days leading to 2″-8″ of snow along and north of highway 30. Areas, including the QC metro will see rain change to snow leading to an inch or two on grassy surfaces. This will lead to slick travel north of I-80 today. Tonight and Saturday will be the quiet time this weekend with highs only in the mid to low 40s. Sunday evening the next system will arrive in the region leading to widespread rainfall in the midwest. While there will be some dry times on Monday, most areas will see at least a half inch of rainfall. Next week will be cooler than normal in the 40s and low 50s. TODAY: Rain/snow. High: 37º. Winds: N 10-20 mph. TONIGHT: Cloudy. Low: 26º Winds: NW 10-20 mph. TOMORROW: Sunny. High: 42º. Copyright 2024 KWQC. All rights reserved.",

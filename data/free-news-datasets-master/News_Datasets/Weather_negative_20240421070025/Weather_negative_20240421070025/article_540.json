    "text": "The recent heatwave that gripped through West Africa in February was amplified by human-caused global warming and increased to unprecedented levels, according to a new study. Human-Caused Climate Change The World Weather Attribution group of scientists discovered that the heatwave would have occurred less than once per century in a world without climate change. Instead, it was a once-in-a-decade event, with global temperatures rising by an average of 1.2 degrees Celsius over the last four years. According to the study, [average air temperatures](https://www.carbonbrief.org/climate-change-made-west-africas-dangerous-humid-heatwave-10-times-more-likely/) in West Africa reached 36 degrees Celsius from February 11 to 15, while the heat index was around 50 degrees Celsius. The humidity was also excessive, making it difficult for people to cool down by sweating. According to the study's authors, [human-caused climate change](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/21/west-africa-heatwave-climate-crisis-study?fbclid=IwAR3twPpYZs0xw6_lFWQzq8uQLqtf1w6rpdtWK12gKtHiiA7NeLqvk48WbDw) increased the likelihood of the \"dangerous humid heat\" that enveloped the region. \"The February heatwave happened early in the year, meaning many people wouldn't have been acclimatized to the heat. With every fraction of a degree of global warming, heatwaves like this will become even hotter,\" said Wasiu Adeniyi Ibrahim, of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency. Globally, this February was the hottest ever recorded, breaking the record for the ninth consecutive month. Rising carbon emissions and the El Niño phenomenon have contributed to the current high temperatures. Meteorological organizations in Nigeria and Ghana sent advance warnings about the heat, but many of the other countries affected did not prepare for extreme temperatures. Africa's record-breaking heat extended into March. From March 18 to 19, at least five African countries, including South Africa and South Sudan, recorded record-breaking temperatures.

Prices for cocoa, a crucial ingredient in chocolate, have risen in recent years as a result of climate-related crop damage, and the new heatwave adds to the pressure. Farmers in Ivory Coast reported in February that high temperatures and a lack of rain were harming their crops. In a report, [large cocoa mills in Ghana](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/african-cocoa-plants-run-out-beans-global-chocolate-crisis-deepens-2024-03-13/) and elsewhere halted or slowed processing in March due to a lack of funds to purchase the beans. Cocoa bean prices have reached an all-time high of more than $8,000 a ton, more than tripling the price in March 2020. \"Farmers in west Africa who grow the main ingredient of the Easter eggs many of us are looking forward to are struggling in the face of both extreme heat and rainfall,\" said Amber Sawyer, of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit in the UK. The research stressed the importance of taking proactive actions to lessen the effects of extreme heat, particularly in areas that lack adequate infrastructure and readiness. As the world struggles with the growing effects of climate change, experts emphasize the vital need for wealthier nations to help developing countries with their adaptation efforts. However, achieving net-zero emissions remains the ultimate goal in solving the growing global crisis.

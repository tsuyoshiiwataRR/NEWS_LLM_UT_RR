    "text": "Flight delays possible due to heavy snowfall at Pearson Airport in Mississauga, Ontario\nPublished March 22, 2024 at 7:48 am\nThose planning to fly out of Pearson Airport in Mississauga today may want to check for delays before heading out.\nSpring arrived this week but southern Ontario will be experiencing a return to winter today (March 22) and tomorrow.\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada\nissued a warning for up to 15 cm of snow today and into Saturday in southern Ontario. Peak snowfall rates of two cm per hour are possible.\nThis morning, Pearson Airport officials report travellers are flowing smoothly through the terminals.\n“However, when the weather turns, please remember to give yourself lots of time and check our departures board ahead of time for the latest flight updates,” the airport says in a post on X.\nAirport crews are ready to keep the runways clear for planes to arrive and depart once the snow arrives, Pearson says.\nIt is always a good idea to check the latest\nflight departure updates here.\nOur morning travellers are flowing smoothly through the terminals, but Environment Canada is calling for upwards of 15 cm of snow today.\nOur airfield surface maintenance specialists are prepared to do what they do best – keeping runways clear for planes to arrive and depart once…\n[pic.twitter.com/LI6HNMcIZD]\n— Toronto Pearson (@TorontoPearson)\n[March 22, 2024] ",

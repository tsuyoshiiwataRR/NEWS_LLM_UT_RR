    "text": "Local News Storm bringing soaking rain to Massachusetts, over a foot of snow up north By Terry Eliasen, Exec. Weather Producer\nUpdated on: March 23, 2024 / 12:35 AM EDT / CBS Boston\nNext Weather: WBZ Forecast For March 23 Next Weather: WBZ Forecast For March 23 03:25 When does the storm start in Massachusetts? Friday 8 p.m. - midnight. If you are heading out Friday night, it will be dry through about 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. After that, there may be some light snow breaking out, mainly north of the Mass Pike. Not expecting much accumulation but there may be a light coating on some roads in northernmost Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire.\nWBZ-TV graphic CBS Boston Midnight - 7 a.m. Saturday: Still waiting on the main precipitation shield from the storm to arrive. However, there is likely to be some light, wintry mix north and west of Boston. A mix of light snow and ice is expected through parts of Middlesex and Worcester counties as well as southern New Hampshire.\nWBZ-TV graphic CBS Boston 7 a.m. - noon Saturday: Rain overspreads all of southern New England. The snow shield gets shunted into central and northern New England. Some sleet and freezing rain will linger in the elevated areas in central and western Massachusetts where temperatures will be slow to warm. We could see some light ice accretion on the limbs and wires in parts of northern Worcester county.\nSaturday afternoon through midnight: A washout. Rain gets heavy by late afternoon and between 7 p.m. and midnight it will be absolutely pouring. Temperatures warm into the 40s across eastern Mass. and mid to upper 30s north and west (mild enough for all rain in southern New England).\nWBZ-TV graphic CBS Boston Flood watch for eastern Massachusetts If you are headed out Saturday night, be prepared for ponding on the roadways. If you live in an area that has been prone to flooding in the last several months (near a small stream, river or pond), you may experience renewed flooding Saturday night. Have the sump pump ready just in case.\nThe National Weather Service has issued a flood watch for all of eastern Mass. for the potential of river, stream, basement and poor drainage flooding.\nWBZ-TV graphic CBS Boston The rain tapers off after midnight in most of the area. Southeastern Mass., Cape Cod and the Islands will be last to dry out, between 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. Sunday.\nTemperatures will fall below freezing in most areas as the storm departs late Saturday night. Any untreated surfaces could turn treacherous, use caution if you head out early Sunday morning.\nSunday will be dry but blustery and chilly. Clouds will linger in eastern Mass. The farther west you go, the more sunshine.\nHow much snow and rain will Massachusetts and New Hampshire get? Most areas will receive between 2-3\" of rainfall. Highest amounts are likely to be south of the Mass Pike in Connecticut, Rhode Island and over southeastern Mass. There may be some locally higher amounts (above 3\").\nThe National Weather Service has posted winter weather advisories for central and western Mass. as well as southern New Hampshire.\nWBZ-TV graphic CBS Boston The winter storm warnings (in pink) are posted for areas where there is a better chance of more significant snow accumulations (up to or exceeding 6\").\nA very early coating to an inch up near the Mass./NH border (mostly sleet), all to be washed away by rain.\nJust over the border into southwestern NH and southernmost Vermont there will be 1-3\", again snow and a lot of sleet.\nFrom Manchester, NH north to Concord, NH about 3-6\".\nWBZ-TV graphic CBS Boston Snow forecast for New England ski country The snow \"jackpot\" will be in the Green Mountains and up through central and northern New Hampshire. The state of Maine is also in line for quite a bit of snow on Saturday.\nGreat news for those looking to get in some spring skiing! 1-2 FEET of fresh snow is expected to fall across most of the northern ski areas.\nWBZ-TV graphic CBS Boston A bit closer to home, we are concerned about some light ice accretion in central and western Mass. as well as southern New Hampshire during Saturday morning. If you live in an elevated area out that way, check your temperature if you are heading out. There may be some ice on the deck, driveway or on untreated roads.\nWBZ-TV graphic CBS Boston Wind and coastal issues not major concerns Wind is not a major factor with this storm. During Saturday night, we could see southeasterly gusts topping 40 mph over Cape Cod and the Islands.\nSunday will be gusty across all of southern New England, but below warning levels. Looking at northerly gusts between 20-35 mph.\nCoastal flooding is also not a major concern this go around. Astronomically, the levels are a few feet lower than during our last event. There may be some pockets of minor flooding during the Saturday night high tide (after 11 p.m.) along south or southeast facing beaches across southeastern MA.\nNext week we can expect a windy and chilly start, with more wet weather likely mid to late week.\nMore from CBS News Heavy rain and flood watch for Saturday, while snow returns up north \"Juiced-up\" storm bringing heavy rain Saturday and snow up north \"Wander Woman\" encourages women to explore the world alone Rat problem in North Attleboro leaves town and residents disagreeing on cause Massachusetts RMV hit by \"national system outage\"",

Your First Alert: Wintry conditions Friday morning A Winter Weather Advisory is in effect for the morning hours of Friday for areas generally along and north of U.S. Highway 30. This is where wintry precipitation is most likely, with slick roads developing in many spots. Precipitation is likely for much of eastern Iowa throughout the morning hours on Friday, with many areas experiencing mainly frozen precipitation. For many areas north of U.S. Highway 20, this will likely fall as just snow, with a transition area of a bit of a mix of snow, sleet, and rain between Interstate 80 and Highway 20. As frozen precipitation begins, road conditions have gotten worse. Y [ou can check the latest conditions here](https://www.kcrg.com/page/road-conditions/) before you head out this morning, which we would strongly recommend. Precipitation rates will be moderate to even heavy at times, reducing visibility and further deteriorating road conditions at a more rapid pace. A few lightning strikes are possible, too, though the chance for that is higher in the southern zone where most precipitation is plain rain. Some of the heaviest precipitation has been observed between the Highway 30 and Highway 20 corridors, and that trend may continue through the morning. The largest area of the most widespread precipitation moving out of western Iowa is also on track for the main hours of the morning commute, further complicating travel for some areas. Since we’ve had an extended break from wintry conditions in most parts of eastern Iowa, it’s a good idea to remember to use those safer winter driving techniques. While air temperatures and pavement temperatures will be near or above freezing in some cases, which will help road crews with keeping things clearer, you could still wind up in trouble without slowing down a bit. Give yourself that extra time to get where you’re going, and also leave extra stopping distance at intersections and between you and the car in front of you. Total snowfall amounts will fall into a 2 to 4 inch range for much of the northern half of the TV9 viewing area, with a band of a trace to 2 inches of snow south of that where mixed precipitation will take place. South of Interstate 80, most areas see just rain and should avoid much accumulation and the related travel impacts. Precipitation starts to wind down from northwest to southeast, beginning from mid-morning in the northwest to lunchtime toward the Mississippi River. Behind it, clouds likely stick around for a bit before clearing out somewhat later this evening or tonight. Winds could increase toward the 15 to 25 mph range this afternoon and evening, potentially causing some minor blowing of snow. The wet nature of the snow, and the potential for melting as temperatures inch above freezing this afternoon, will likely limit any additional impacts from blowing snow, however. Dry weather continues into tonight with temperatures dipping into the upper 10s to low 20s. We’ll make it back above freezing again during the day on Saturday, when skies will start out fairly sunny but turn cloudier throughout the day. Highs reach the upper 30s to low 40. Your First Alert: More rain and snow on Sunday, precipitation continues early next week It won’t be much longer after that when precipitation again moves into eastern Iowa. An area of low pressure will develop on the Plains and slowly move through the Midwest, tracking through western Iowa by early next week. As it begins to move through, an area of precipitation will arrive here by late Saturday night into Sunday morning. Enough cold air looks to be in place that most of it should start as either all snow or a bit of a rain and snow mix. Warmer air will be pulled into eastern Iowa as southerly flow develops ahead of the low, gradually changing that to plain rain by Sunday night. A period of time Sunday morning into the afternoon could feature snowy road conditions, especially the farther northwest you go in the viewing area. This could cause some trouble for travel during that time, with slick conditions possible. If you’re traveling farther out across the Midwest, areas in the Dakotas and Minnesota may see substantial amounts of snowfall as this storm moves through, with troublesome conditions more likely there. Rain and even some thunderstorms will remain likely Sunday night into Monday. The storm system will finally start to move on by early Tuesday, taking what will be a potential rain/snow mix with it away from our area. A break, before another storm system Dry weather is looking likely for the middle of next week, with the potential for a good amount of sunshine. Temperatures hang out near or a little below normal, with highs in the 40s and 50s and low in the 20s. The next storm system in an ongoing active weather pattern begins to approach the state on Thursday night into Friday at the very tail end of the 9-day forecast. At this point, its track would give us mostly plain rain and potentially a few storms. We’re still several days away from this system, so the details may change between now and then. Stick with us.

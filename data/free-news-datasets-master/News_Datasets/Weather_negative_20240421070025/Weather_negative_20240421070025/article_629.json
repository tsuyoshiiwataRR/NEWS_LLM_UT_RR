    "text": "Covington highway closed after tree falls during strong storms Covington highway closed after tree falls during strong storms NOW, ONE THING I WISH I DON’T HAVE TO APPROVE OF RIGHT NOW IS THIS WEATHER. LATER ON TODAY, DAMON GOING TO BE A LOT OF RAIN OUT THERE. THAT’S WHAT WE’RE DOING TODAY. A WDSU FIRST WARNING WEATHER IMPACT DAY. YEAH. AND IT’S, YOU KNOW, PRIMARILY THE WORST OF IT IS MOVING INTO OUR AREA RIGHT NOW. AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE WORST OF IT IS PRIMARILY A MORNING EVENT. I’M EXPECTING SOME RAINFALL THIS AFTERNOON AS WELL, BUT THE BULK OF IT ARE THE WORST OF IT IS GOING TO BE PASSING THROUGH OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS. VISIBILITY ISSUES. YOU MIGHT RUN INTO THOSE AS YOU HEAD OUT THE DOOR THIS MORNING. SOME FOG, LOW CLOUD COVER, AND OF COURSE THE RAINFALL THAT WE HAVE. IN FACT. TAKE A LOOK AT THE RADAR PICTURE AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT I’M MAKING REFERENCE TO. IT’S QUITE A BIT OF RAIN, BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE LAKE, BUT THE LINE IS MOVING PRETTY QUICKLY INTO SOUTHEAST LOUISIANA RIGHT NOW, AND THAT’S GOING TO BE THE CASE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS. WE’RE GOING TO SEE THAT RAINFALL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA IN SOME POCKETS OF THIS RAINFALL AND MOVING AT ABOUT 45MPH. SO A BIG HEADS UP FOR FOR YOU THERE THAT THAT RAINFALL IS MOVING ACROSS THE AREA RELATIVELY QUICKLY. SO WHILE YOU’RE GOING TO RUN INTO SOME SOME HEAVY RAINFALL AT TIMES, IT’S NOT GOING TO BE AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO CREATE ANY BIG PROBLEMS WITH WITH STREET FLOODING. AND I’M NOT SEEING IT REALLY TRAINING ACROSS A GOOD PORTION OF THE AREA. BUT SOME OF THAT MORE MODERATE RAINFALL IS MOVING BACK INTO PARTS OF SAINT TAMMANY PARISH RIGHT NOW. SO IF YOU’RE IN FOLSOM OR GOODBEE OVER TOWARDS MADISONVILLE, THAT MORE MODERATE RAINFALL IS JUST TO THE WEST OF YOU MOVING OVER HAMMOND, TICKFAW INDEPENDENCE, PONCHATOULA UP TOWARDS ROSELAND AS WELL. AND WE’VE GOT SOME PRETTY HEAVY SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY DOWN HERE ON THE SOUTH SHORE. ALSO, JUST TO THE WEST OF YOU IN LAPLACE. THERE’S SOME PRETTY HEAVY RAINFALL OUT IN THAT DIRECTION, AND WE’VE GOT SOME RAIN THAT’S MOVING ACROSS THE RIVER. PARISHES RIGHT NOW THAT’S HEADED TOWARD THE CITY AS WELL. LET ME SHOW YOU WHERE THIS POCKET OF RAIN IS HEADED. AND AS I PUT THE STORM TRACKER ON IT, IF YOU’RE IN PARODY, ABOUT NINE MINUTES, IT’LL BE OVER YOUR HEAD. BAYOU GAUCHE, AT ABOUT 11 MINUTES, -- AND ABOUT 13 MINUTES THAT WILL BE OVER YOUR HEAD. AND THEN WE’VE GOT THAT HEAVY RAINFALL THAT’S MOVING ACROSS PARTS OF TERREBONNE PARISH OVER POINT OCEAN AND CHAUVIN. BOUDREAUX SEEING SOME OF THAT HEAVY RAINFALL, SOME STRONG STORMS DOWN TOWARDS COCODRIE THIS MORNING AND ALL THIS IS HEADED TOWARDS YOU FOLKS AND CUT OFF AND GALLIANO AND OVER TOWARDS GOLDEN MEADOW AS WELL. AND IT’S MOVING PRETTY QUICKLY ALSO. SO BIG HEADS UP FOR YOU IF YOU’RE IN CUT OFF ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES OVER YOUR HEAD. UH, GALLIANO, ABOUT 11 MINUTES OVER YOUR HEAD. CLOVELLY FARMS, ABOUT 12 MINUTES OVER YOUR HEAD AS WELL. LET ME SHOW YOU THE THE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY. AND YOU CAN SEE PRETTY CLEARLY THE CIRCULATION AROUND THAT LOW PRESSURE AREA THAT’S BACK HERE IN TEXAS. AND THAT’S HELPING TO FEED A LOT OF MOISTURE INTO SOUTHEAST LOUISIANA. AND A LOT OF RAINFALL. NOTICE THAT BOW ECHO RIGHT THERE. THAT’S AN INDICATION OF SOME STRONG WINDS THAT ARE HEADED IN OUR DIRECTION AS WELL. THERE’S A LOT OF RAINFALL OVER ALMOST THE ENTIRE STATE OF FLORIDA RIGHT NOW. A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTH SHORE STRETCHING OVER TOWARDS HANCOCK COUNTY. YOUR TEMPERATURES MID TO UPPER 50S ON THE NORTH SHORE, SOME LOW TO MID MID 60S DOWN HERE ON THE SOUTH SHORE. AND HERE’S A LOOK AT THAT RAINFALL AS WE GO INTO THE 8 A.M. TIME FRAME WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 50S AND 60S, MOST OF IT ARE THE BULK OF THAT RAINFALL TO THE EAST OF US. BY ABOUT 10 OR 11 A.M. AND THEN WHILE WE’RE EXPECTING A FEW SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE HEATING OF THE DAY, WE MAY EVEN SEE SOME THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY. TEMPERATURES COULD RISE INTO THE MID 70S ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTHEAST LOUISIANA AFTER THE RAINFALL TODAY. THE WEEKEND IS LOOKING GREAT, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUR SATURDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN THE LOW 70S ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AND THEN THE RAIN IS BACK, ESPECIALLY ON TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK.

    "text": "Rain chances will be highest in the morning today NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - A round of strong storms will move through the region this morning making for a morning commute that will be impacted by the weather. Those storms will be most active between 5 and 10 in the morning so peak commuter time will coincide with the worst of the weather. Some stronger storm cells are possible with the biggest threats being gusty winds, heavy rains and hail. Even though the tornado risk is very low, it’s not zero so we’ll be monitoring that. Quickly the line of storms will progress through and improving weather conditions are expected by the lunch hour. Into this afternoon, sunshine will return to the forecast and we’ll warm into the 70s. A random pop up storm remains possible even once we get the sun back later today. No changes have been made to the weekend forecast as it’s going to be a beautiful one. Some early morning clouds Saturday will give way to sunshine and a nice breeze. Highs will be in the 70s both Saturday and Sunday. See a spelling or grammar error in our story? [Click Here](mailto:WVUE-digitalcontent@gray.tv) to report it. Please include the headline.

    "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Although spring officially started on Tuesday, [ winter is not over yet](/article/weather/forecast/weather-forecast/69-19905200)! Snow is rolling across West Michigan Friday, bringing with it the potential for anywhere between four to eight inches of snow. The snowfall has already started and is anticipated to continue until about midnight. Snowfall totals are expected to be at their highest between the morning and evening commutes. Because of this, some schools in West Michigan have called for a snow day on Friday. Check to see if your child's school is closed [here.](/closings) Most areas in West Michigan will see at least four inches of snow, though some areas are set up to receive more. Kent, Muskegon, Ionia and Montcalm counties are anticipated to get at least six inches of snow. Areas below that will get about four inches. There is the potential for higher amounts depending on how the system sets up. Road crews began preparing for the snowy weather Thursday, as travel impacts are expected throughout the day. Drivers are encouraged to slow down, leave extra room between vehicles and give themselves plenty of time to reach their destination.

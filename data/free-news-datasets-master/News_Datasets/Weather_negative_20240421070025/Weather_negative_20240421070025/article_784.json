    "text": "Highlighting a concerning trend amidst the threat of climate change, a study has said there is a growing probability of temperatures soaring to as high as 40 degrees Celsius during late March, coinciding with the Holi celebration, in at least nine States, including States like Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and Bihar. Maharashtra currently exhibits the highest probability at 14 per cent while among the cities, Bilaspur has the highest risk with a 31 percent chance of reaching 40 degrees Celsius, which is 2.5 times higher than in the 1970s. Such a scenario, which was once considered rare, underscores the escalating impact of climate change on weather patterns and cultural festivities, particularly during the festival of colours, traditionally celebrated amidst the onset of spring. The report from Climate Central, a US-based group of scientists comes days after the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) had forecast that the country is likely to experience warmer summer this year, with above normal day and night temperatures from March till May over most parts of the country due to El Nino conditions, except over some isolated areas of northwest, northeast, central and peninsular India. Predicting the warm weather, the US-based researchers too pointed out that States that will be impacted by extreme heat waves will be Rajasthan, Gujarat, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh. Citywise, said the study, a total of 37 cities now have at least a 1 per cent chance of experiencing extreme heat, with 11 cities having a probability exceeding 10 per cent. To show this change, the researchers calculated the difference between the warming rates in March and April, expressed as the change in average temperature since 1970. On regional impact, the study said, the warming trend is observed across all of India, particularly in March and April, with central regions experiencing the fastest changes. With the exception of Madurai, the 15 cities with the highest risk of experiencing temperatures above 4 degrees Celsius are in central India, the analysis showed. Climate Central said March and April are warming across India. During March, the northern and western regions have the fastest warming, with the largest change since 1970 in March occurring in Jammu and Kashmir (2.8 degrees Celsius). Warming is more uniform in April and Mizoram has the largest change since 1970 (1.9 degrees Celsius). “There has been an abrupt transition in the temperatures from cool winter-like temperatures to much warmer conditions now. “After the strong warming trend observed in February, March is also likely to follow the same pattern. These warming trends in India are a clear sign of the impacts of human-led climate change,” said Andrew Pershing, VP for Science, Climate Central. The authors also emphasised the role of human-led climate change in the escalating temperatures. Mahesh Palawat from Skymet Weather corroborates this, stating that climate change is the driving force behind soaring temperatures and warns of more frequent heatwaves and intense summers. The report also mentioned global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions to mitigate the impacts of climate change. It highlighted the urgency to limit further temperature rise to prevent worsening climate impacts. Global average temperatures have risen by more than 1.1 degrees Celsius since 1850, with greenhouse gas levels reaching record highs in 2023.",

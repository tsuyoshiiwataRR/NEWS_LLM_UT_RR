    "text": "MERKEL, Tx — According to Merkel residents the roads are a hassle to travel, on even the sunniest day. But when it rains it pours, and the Merkel roads can’t handle the overflow. Anna Maria Salinas says potholes and flooding is a huge issue in Merkel. “We have problems when it rains,” Salinas said. “We ask if we can have gravel and dirt. Sometimes they come and they put some down. But when it rains there is always a hole. It’s everywhere you go, and I wish they would fix the roads.” According to Salinas the water rises extremely fast on Yucca St., but in her opinion the worst flooding occurs where the children play. “It always gets so bad,” Salinas said. Mainly up by the schools.” The three-year Merkel resident only wants what’s best for Merkel, and its residents. “I wish they would fix them so we can have good roads where they won’t be so bumpy,” Salinas said. “I know the elderly likes to go walking and there is always holes everywhere. They get hurt. That’s what I would like, for the residents in this little town to have a safe place to walk.” Merkel’s city manager Brian Weaver says Merkel is working on a budget to repair the roads. The city manager said addressing the flooding problem is going to be a more difficult problem to solve but they are searching for funds to find a solution.",

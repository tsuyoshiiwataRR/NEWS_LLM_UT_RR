    "text": "Is anyone ready to get off this roller-coaster weather ride we’ve been on this month? I sure am! The old saying was, ‘March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb’ but this year it’s been the opposite. All this up and down 70 degrees one day and 30 degrees the next has left me with the sniffles — but so far, despite it being a super busy week, I’m managing. It’s felt to me like March has been more jam-packed than usual. My BFF’s birthday was earlier this month so a few days before her birthday I treated her to what was her very first manicure. I actually have my friend Rachel to thank as she gave me a gift certificate for my 65th birthday celebration last fall so I used that to treat Deb and myself to a manicure and I only had to add a little to it. I originally wanted to schedule a mani-pedi for the both of us but that didn’t work out, so we’ll just have to schedule a pedicure for a later time. I was surprised she had NEVER had a professional manicure, but it’s not like I’ve had a ton either — I was in my 50’s before I had my first manicure. A former boyfriend treated me to one for my youngest son’s wedding and I continued going for awhile after that but then went back to doing my own nails. But it was fun, and Deb enjoyed it — it’s nice to get pampered once in a while. We went out to brunch afterwards. Last week we went to see the movie “Cabrini”, it was a last-minute decision and the only time I’d be able to go. A friend from church met us there, too and — wow — what a powerful movie! I realize it’s likely no longer playing in local theatres, but if you have an opportunity to see it or maybe stream it on Angel Studios, I highly recommend it. Although it took place in the late 1800’s-early 1900’s and focused on the plight of Italian immigrants in New York, I felt it was very timely with a message for our times. Plus, with March being Women’s History Month the story of Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini and the difference she made that is still felt today was also timely. There were several things said in the movie that stood out to me but one quote that really resonated with me was after being questioned about her ‘weak constitution’ she responded, “We can serve our weakness, or we can serve our purpose, but not both.” I love that! The next day was St. Patrick’s Day and I hosted one of my small groups from church and cooked my traditional St. Patrick’s Day dinner — not corned beef, but ham, cabbage, boiled potatoes, carrots and Irish Soda bread. We had to cut our monthly meeting a little short so we could attend a devotional talk and prayer service at our church, so that was a super busy day for me. No sooner was St. Patrick’s Day over then it was time to think about Easter. I know Easter has occurred in March before, but it seems to be coming so quick this year. That tells me time is moving faster and I’m getting slower. Aside from those events and my normal work and church meetings, this week has been what I affectionately call ‘chamber banquet season’ because I covered two different chamber of commerce’s award banquets and a women’s history month event. It’s work, but fun too to catch up with some people — whether it’s my own publishers, other media people, or other business owners and professionals. Sometimes, it’s an opportunity to make new connections for future stories, too. Then this coming week is Holy Week, so it’ll be another busy week of church services. I’ll have a delayed Easter celebration with my Fort Wayne crew as they have plans for Easter weekend so we’ll get together the week after — maybe the weather will be a bit more stable by then.",

    "text": "Photo: 4u4me / iStock / Getty Images\nResidents in North Jersey are bracing themselves for a wet weekend. The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for Sussex and Warren Counties from tomorrow morning through Sunday morning. Other areas, including Bergen, Morris, and Passaic Counties, could see up to three inches of rainfall tonight through tomorrow night.\nThe rain is expected to start pouring across North Jersey by tomorrow morning and should end by Sunday morning. While Sussex and Warren Counties may see some snow mixed with the rain, no accumulation is forecasted.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, parts of the shore may be hit even harder with up to four inches of rain during the storm. As the system moves out of the area Saturday night, strong winds are also expected to develop which may result in downed trees and power outages.\nDespite these weather conditions marking a soggy start to spring, there's good news on the horizon. The forecast for Sunday throughout the region calls for sunny skies with temperatures in the upper 40s. This will lead into highs in the 50s at the start of next week.\nThis upcoming forecast continues a trend of heavy bouts of rain in North Jersey since late 2023. The wet weather has previously prompted visits from Gov. Phil Murphy to areas like Little Falls amid storms that caused flooding in nearby rivers such as Passaic River.\nListen to 102.3 WSUS , 103.7 NNJ , and 106.3 The Bear for the latest weather updates.",

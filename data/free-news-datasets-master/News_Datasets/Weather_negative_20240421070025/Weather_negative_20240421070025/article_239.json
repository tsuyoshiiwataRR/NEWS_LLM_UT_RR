    "text": "As temperatures continue to rise, people suffering from migraine should be cautious. The hot weather can exacerbate the condition and it's essential to delve into management strategies for relief. Healthcare experts have observed that migraine tends to worsen during summer. Well, there can be several triggers behind this. Heat and humidity consistently stand as common triggers for migraine headaches. In this article, we have shared 5 other causes behind the sudden increase of migraine attacks during rising temperatures. Read below!\nWHAT CAUSES SUDDEN INCREASE IN MIGRAINE ATTACKS DURING SUMMER SEASON?\nDehydration: One of the primary triggers for migraines during summer is dehydration. The hot weather causes increased sweating, leading to fluid loss from the body. Dehydration can reduce blood volume and lead to changes m electrolyte levels, both of which can trigger migraine or make them worse. Sunlight Exposure: Exposure to bright sunlight can be a trigger for some migraine sufferers. Sunlight can cause squinting and eye strain, which can lead to tension headaches or exacerbate existing migraines. Poor Air Quality: Summer air quality can worsen due to factors such as pollution, pollen and allergens. Poor air quality can irritate the respiratory system and trigger inflammation, which can lead to migraine attacks. Disrupted routine: Summer often brings changes to routines, such as vacations, irregular sleep patterns, or changed eating habits. These disruptions can cause stress, fatigue and changes in hormonal levels, all of which are migraine triggers. Humidity Levels: High Humidity levels prevalent during the summer can exacerbate migraine symptoms for some individuals. Humid air can make it more difficult for the body to regulate temperature, leading to increased discomfort and potential dehydration. PRECAUTIONS\nIndividuals with migraine should prioritise adequate fluid intake. Doctors also advise minimising exposure to intense sunlight, recommending the use of hats, and umbrellas and staying indoors when possible. Stress is also recognised as a trigger for headaches and migraines. Techniques such as deep breathing and meditation can aid in alleviating stress-induced symptoms Prioritising sleep quality can play a significant role in migraine prevention.",

After a snowstorm blew through metro Detroit Friday morning, drivers were forced to deal with slick roads, heavy snow and low visibility. Drivers beware: This first official weekend of spring could start with some heavy snow across parts of Ontario It's officially spring, but Friday's snow across southern Ontario could bring one of the largest one-day snowfall totals of the year An archaeological site in Ethiopia has revealed that a population of humans survived the eruption of Sumatra’s Mount Toba 74,000 years ago. He tries to copy his mom and “eat whatever she is currently eating,” zookeepers say. Locals had been killing the snakes because they thought they were poisonous, researchers said. Snowfall persists across Alberta, with another 10-20cm expected to blanket the region. Stay informed with meteorologist Rhythm Reet for the latest updates on weather conditions. A chilly weekend will spread across much of Canada as an active pattern churns through the end of March A widespread swath of snow is expected across southern Ontario on Friday. Some areas could get 10-15 cm, however, the exact track is uncertain. Farther north, less snow for some, farther south more snowfall for some. The Weather Network meteorologist Nadine Powell has the details. After a week that brought heavy snow and travel disruptions to southern Alberta, another round of wintry weather will fill this first full weekend of spring With Canada coming out of its warmest winter on record, some may be enjoying the signs of spring that are showing up much earlier this year: But this isn't good news for the natural world. A drone and robot are aiding in the inspection of the devastation inside the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant reactor, 13 years post-meltdown. Sid the siamang couldn’t help himself, stealing birthday treats from Hahnumahn who was celebrating his 28th birthday at Oakland Zoo in California.Video shared by Oakland Zoo on March 21 shows the pair chasing each other around their enclosure after Sid helped himself to presents and snacks meant for Hahnumahn.“Happy 28th birthday Hahnumahn siamang!” the zoo said.“Sid attended the party…and stole several snacks and gifts from the birthday boy. All in all, much fun was had.” Credit: Oakland Zoo via Storyful It won't feel like spring at all in eastern Quebec and on parts of the East Coast as a messy system will be bringing a hefty dose of snowfall for many areas, and heavy rain for others, alongside intense wind gusts Researches discovered the “smooth” animal in a forest of Vietnam. Brace for a wild weather weekend as an impactful system barrels towards the Maritimes, threatening to disrupt travel with freezing rain, heavy snowfall, and the risk of localized flooding More snow is on the way for southern Ontario on Wednesday, a not-so pleasant way to welcome spring into the region for its first full day. A research animal identified as Bear 122 or \"The Boss\" is believed to have been the first grizzly bear spotted out of hibernation. OTTAWA — Canada's carbon price could slash greenhouse-gas emissions by more than 100 million tonnes a year by 2030, but only about one-fifth of that will come from the consumer carbon price at the centre of Conservative attacks. A new analysis published Thursday by the Canadian Climate Institute said the price applied to big industrial emitters plays a far greater role in cutting emissions than the consumer fuel levy. But the consumer levy is still worth the political battle the Liberals are fac Zoo-based research can teach us about the needs of animals in our care.

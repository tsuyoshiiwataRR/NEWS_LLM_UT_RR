    "text": "FIRST ALERT WEATHER DAY: 2-5″ OF SNOW LIKELY CAUSING SLIPPERY TRAVEL Friday is a FIRST ALERT WEATHER DAY as light to moderate wet snow falls over northeast Wisconsin! Most recent snowfall models still indicate 2-5″ of snow for most of us while further north looks to get slightly less. The further south you go, the more snow you could see! A Winter Weather Advisory has been issued for ALL of northeast Wisconsin besides Florence and Menominee County in Michigan until 1 PM Friday. The heaviest snow will happen in the early morning hours then things calm down by mid morning. Scattered snow showers will continue off & on throughout the day creating an additional inch of snow for some areas. Your evening commute should be much better compared to the morning drive, but slippery roads are still likely. Highs will be in the mid 30s. Saturday will be mostly sunny and cool in the mid 30s for highs, but don’t get too comfortable because another stronger system will impact Wisconsin for multiple days. On Sunday, we will see another chance for snow coming in bringing an additional 1-3″. Once a warm front passes over Wisconsin on Monday, temperatures will warm up enough to convert the snow to a wintry mix then rainfall. Temperatures will warm back up into the lower to mid 40s next week reaching us back to normal highs. Check it out, we’ve reorganized your favorite weather graphics. They’re now in our new First Alert Map Room, which can be found here: [Go to the First Alert Map Room](https://www.wbay.com/weather/map-room/) You can always keep our forecast handy with our free weather app. Look for the WBAY First Alert Weather App in the Apple app store and Google Play ( [click here](https://onelink.to/g349n3) on your mobile device).

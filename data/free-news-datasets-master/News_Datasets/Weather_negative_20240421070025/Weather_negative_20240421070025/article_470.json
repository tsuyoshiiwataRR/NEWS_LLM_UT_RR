    "text": "We are going to start this Friday morning, marking the end of the first week of spring with a major winter storm warning. Yeah, more than 30 millionaire on alert. From the Rockies to New England, some regions could get up to a foot and a half of snow. Meantime, many areas not getting snow are bracing for heavy rain. 50 million under flood watches up and down the East Coast, with 7 inches expected in parts of Florida. We’ve got it all covered for you this morning, including Mr. Roker’s full forecast. But let’s start with NBC’s Maggie Vespa. She’s in Milwaukee, WI, where it looks like the flakes are already falling. Maggie, good morning. Oh, Craig, good morning. That is such, respectfully, an understatement. The word I can think of right now is pouring like snow feels like it’s pouring here in Milwaukee. And for reference, you can already see how much has fallen. Last night there was nothing on the ground. This place was completely dry. But you can see we’re close to like half a foot, which was the forecast in total here in Milwaukee. It feels like some parts are already reaching that forecasted peak. So we’ll see how this goes. We also have and again this is 3 days in to spring. We have video overnight from other cities. They’re just getting slammed by this severe winter system. Madison, WI. The roads are already a mess there as well. The morning commute expected to be a bit rough because of that similar story here. And then also in Minneapolis, MN, that city get this expected to get half its forecasted snowfall total for the entire season or it’s actually its total to date for the entire season. So half of that could fall with just this one storm. And that speaks to how severe of a swing this is amid an ongoing, what they call snow drought. We have some numbers here to kind of speak to this from cities that are frankly as we know, normally a bunch of snow falling on us as we from the tree above us as we talk about this. Normally these are like a winter Wonderland, right. We’re talking about Duluth, MN. They’re close to five feet shy of their average snowfall total for this time of year in Minneapolis. They are having their driest winter since the early 30s. So guys, again, we’re talking about half a foot with this first system, and it’s part of a 1-2 punch that we’re talking about over the next week or so. So this is bringing definitely some needed moisture. Again, springtime snow bringing needed moisture. And it’s packing quite a punch in the process. Looks like it. Maggie Vespa force there in a snowy Milwaukee. Maggie. Thank you. All right, let’s get over to Al for a check on this weekend. How bad is it going to get? OK, so we’ve got three storms we’re going to be looking at. OK. So we’ve got this number one storm in the Midwest that’s going to bring heavy snow to New England. We’ve got a flooding or floodings are going to ramp up along the East Coast. And then there’s a major spring storm that’s going to be coming into the West. So let’s get started here. We’ll start with Storm #1, winter alerts, 32 million people from Montana all the way to England where we have winter storm warnings out. And then we’ve got these flood watches from 50 million people from Bahaba, Maine all the way down to Washington DC, the Delmarva Peninsula all along the I-95 Carter. So today we’ve got snow up to the north, down to the South. We’re looking at heavy rain flood risk, Southern Florida and New England, I should say the southeast tomorrow flood threat making its way into the Mid-Atlantic states. Heavy, wet snow for northern New England. With those trees starting to bud and leaf, there could be power outages. Rainfall amounts down in southern Florida. Six to seven inches. We move along the coast 1 to 4 inches. Could be upwards of five or six. In parts of the Northeast snowfall, we’ve got two to three inches as we move our way across the Great Lakes. Upwards of 18 inches of snow locally in New England. And then Sunday, this next storm brings Montana, Michigan heavy snow into the upper Midwest, severe storms in the lower Mississippi River valley, a foot and a half of snow from the Dakotas into Wisconsin. So this is going to be crippling over the weekend, the I-95 Carters and mess guys, the upper Midwest into Monday. So air travel going to be a big problem.",

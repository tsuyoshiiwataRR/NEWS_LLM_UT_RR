Rescue and emergency teams are working in the affected areas, it said. The ministry said that heavy rains are expected to last until March 24 and may cause avalanches and landslides in the mountainous regions of Chui, Talas, Osh, Jalal-Abad, and Batken. The ministry also warned of possible rapid jumps in water levels in local rivers. To read the original story by RFE/RL's Kyrgyz Service, click here . More News Ukraine Denies Role In Deadly Attack On Russian Concert Venue A senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on March 22 that Kyiv was not involved in the attack on a Moscow-area concert hall the same evening that left dozens dead and many more injured after gunmen stormed in and fired at concertgoers. Mykhaylo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of Zelenskiy's presidential office, said that Ukraine had \"never used terrorist methods\" as it continues to fight a 2-year-old full-scale invasion. \"Ukraine certainly has nothing to do with the shooting/explosions in the Crocus City Hall (Moscow Region, Russia),\" Podolyak said via X, formerly Twitter. \"It makes no sense whatsoever.\" Ukrainian forces are thought to have launched attacks on military and fuel infrastructure inside Russian territory over the course of the war, but generally avoid claims of responsibility. There was no immediate indication of who was behind the deadly attack in Krasnogorsk, near Moscow. Kyiv has recently defended its attacks on oil and other facilities with some reports suggesting the United States has urged it to avoid hitting oil infrastructure in part to avoid escalatory responses from Russia. Podolyak said \"everything in this war will be decided only on the battlefield. Only by the quantity of weapons and qualitative military decisions. Terrorist attacks do not solve any problems...\" He pointed to the recent public warning by U.S. officials. The U.S. Embassy https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/RussianFederation.html#/ on March 7 that it was \"monitoring reports that extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts, and U.S. citizens should be advised to avoid large gatherings over the next 48 hours.\" Podolyak also hinted that the event would \"contribute to a sharp increase in military propaganda, accelerated militarization, expanded mobilization, and, ultimately, the scaling up of the war. And also to justify manifest genocidal strikes against the civilian population of Ukraine...\" The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Defense Ministry of Ukraine quickly alleged -- without providing any evidence -- that Russia's own special services had orchestrated it as \"a deliberate provocation of the Putin regime\" that foreign governments had warned about. It alleged that the aim was to \"further escalate and expand the war.\" FSB Detains 7 For Alleged Ties To Military Group Fighting With Ukraine Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said on March 22 that its officers detained seven men in Moscow on suspicion of collaborating with the so-called Russian Volunteers' Corps (RDK) that has fought alongside Ukraine's armed forces against Russian troops. Last month, a Moscow court sentenced former actor Kirill Kanakhin, who had joined the RDK, in absentia to life in prison on a charge of high treason. In November, a Moscow court sentenced in absentia Denis Kapustin (aka Nikitin), a commander of the RDK, to life on the same charge. The RDK has claimed several attacks in Russia's Belgorod region in recent months.

Today’s sanctions demonstrate our determination to hold Russia’s political leadership and authorities to account for the continuing violation of the human rights in Russia,\" the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement on March 22. \"At the same time, we know that Putin is not Russia, and Russia is not Putin. We will continue supporting Russia’s civil society and independent voices,\" he added. Correctional colonies Polar Wolf in Russia's Arctic town of Kharp -- where Navalny was being held when he died on February 16 while serving a 19-year sentence on extremism and other charges widely seen as politically motivated -- and the IK-6 in the Vladimir region, as well as 33 guards of the two penitentiaries were added to the EU sanctions list. The circumstances of his death have not been clarified, but many Western nations have said that President Vladimir Putin and Russian authorities bear responsibility. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any involvement or responsibility for Navalny's death. Among the Russian officials sanctioned by the EU are Deputy Justice Minister Vsevolod Vukolov; the deputy chief of the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN), Valery Boyarinev; the chief of the Moscow City Penitentiary Service, Sergei Moroz; and Governor Dmitry Artyukhov of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region. The warden of the IK-6 prison, Vadim Kalinin, and his deputies; Moscow City Court Judge Andrei Suvorov, who sentenced Navalny; and the Moscow City Court Chairman Mikhail Paityn were also sanctioned by the 27-nation bloc. Judges Yevgeny Nikolayev and Natalya Dudar were also added to the EU sanctions list for issuing \"a number of rulings against political opponents including Mr. Navalny, thereby contributing to political repression in Russia.\" \"The EU is deeply concerned about the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation in Russia. Russia’s illegal, unjustified, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine has further accelerated internal repression in the country, drastically limiting the freedom of opinion and expression, as well as media freedom, and introducing war censorship,\" the EU statement said, urging Russian authorities \"to immediately and unconditionally release all those imprisoned for politically motivated charges.\" Dozens Dead After Gunmen Storm Moscow Concert Hall; Islamic State Claims Responsibility Russian authorities said at least 40 people were killed and more than 100 injured after gunmen opened fire at the Crocus City Hall concert venue in Krasnogorsk, near Moscow, on March 22 in an attack reportedly claimed by the Islamic State militant group. The Baza website quoted unnamed sources as saying the number of dead was at least 62 and could rise, although that report could not be independently confirmed. The Moscow Regional Health Ministry published a list of names of 145 victims who'd been taken to hospitals. The list includes children. Hours after the incident began and with Russian media warning the perpetrators were still thought to be at large, Reuters and other agencies said Islamic State had claimed responsibility via its affiliated Telegram channels. The IS statement said the attackers had \"retreated to their bases safely.\" President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin leader had been informed \"in the first minutes\" of the attack and was \"constantly receiving information about what's happening and about measures being taken through all relevant services.\" RIA Novosti has reported that at least three gunmen were involved, while Interfax reported there were at least five attackers. The whereabouts or fate of the attackers was still unclear. The Investigative Committee of Russia announced it had opened a criminal case. The New York Times quoted unnamed officials as saying that U.S. intelligence gatherers received information in March that an Afghanistan-based branch of IS known as Islamic State-Khorasan, or ISIS-K, was planning an attack in Moscow. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called on the international community \"to condemn this bloody terrorist attack.\" Shared videos showed attackers storming into the venue before the start of a concert by the musical group Piknik, with at least one firing an assault weapon as they moved through the building. \"According to preliminary information, 40 people were killed and more than 100 were injured as a result of a terrorist attack in the Crocus City Hall,\" the Federal Security Service (FSB) said. Later, Russian media said 28 of the injured were in the Sklifosovsky Institute of Emergency Care in the capital. An assistant to the head of the Russian Health Ministry said at one point that more than 50 ambulance teams and disaster medicine services were working at the scene. Interfax reported that the blaze had spread to 12,900 square meters of the building. The roof of the building is said to have partially collapsed. Shared video showed massive flames and smoke visible from a distance as it poured from the upper floors of the building, which is a popular concert venue in a high-end district on the edge of Moscow. \"A terrible tragedy occurred in the shopping center Crocus City today,\" Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Telegram. \"I am sorry for the loved ones of the victims.\" Some Telegram and other social media accounts shared accounts of purported eyewitnesses, one of whom reported \"shooting from all sides.\" A senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on March 22 that Kyiv was not involved and had \"never used terrorist methods\" as it continues to fight a 2-year-old full-scale Russian invasion. But Mykhaylo Podolyak warned the deadly incident would \"contribute to a sharp increase in military propaganda, accelerated militarization, expanded mobilization, and, ultimately, the scaling up of the war.\" The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Defense Ministry of Ukraine, which has been fighting a full-scale Russian invasion for nearly 25 months, quickly alleged -- without providing any evidence -- that Russia's own special services had orchestrated it as \"a deliberate provocation of the Putin regime\" that foreign governments had warned about. It alleged that the aim was to \"further escalate and expand the war.\" Foreign governments were said to have warned Russia in recent weeks of the risk of an incident. The U.S. Embassy https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-us-warning-extremist-attack/32853610.html on March 7 that it was \"monitoring reports that extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts, and U.S. citizens should be advised to avoid large gatherings over the next 48 hours.\" \"The U.S. Embassy in Moscow is horrified by reports coming from the terrorist attack at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow,\" the U.S. Mission https://ru.usembassy.gov/terrorist-attack-at-the-crocus-city-hall-in-moscow/ in a statement. \"We offer our sincere condolences to the Russian people for the lives lost and to those injured in tonight’s attack.\" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said through a spokesperson that he condemns the attack \"in the strongest possible terms.\" The United States, France, Turkey, Italy, and other countries also condemned the incident. The European Union said through a spokesman that it was \"shocked and appalled by the reports\" and that it \"condemns any attacks against civilians,\" adding, \"Our thoughts are with all those Russian citizens affected.\" France's Foreign Ministry called the images from Moscow \"horrifying.\" \"Our thoughts go to the victims and to those injured as well as to the Russian people,\" the ministry said, addingthat \"all effort\" must be made to \"determine the causes of these heinous acts.\" Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the March 22 attack as an \"odious act of terrorism.\" With reporting by Reuters Pakistan Threatens To Close Vital Afghan Trade Corridor With India Amid escalating tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, Pakistan's defense minister has warned Afghanistan's Taliban rulers that his country could block a corridor it provides to allow trade with India. Khwaja Asif said that Islamabad could block access to its western neighbor Afghanistan through its territory that allows goods to flow into its eastern neighbor India if the Taliban government fails to rein in the Pakistani Taliban, formally known as the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP). \"If Afghanistan treats us like an enemy, then why should we give them a trade corridor?\" Asif told Voice of America on March 20. Tensions between Islamabad and Kabul are running high after the Taliban said it retaliated against Pakistani air strikes that killed eight people, including two children, on March 18. Over the past two decades, Islamabad has repeatedly closed trade routes and border crossings with Afghanistan to pressure Kabul whenever tensions spiked in their bilateral relations. Islamabad said it targeted a hideout of the TTP, which it blames for mounting attacks on its forces. Pakistan says the TTP is using the Afghan side of the mountainous border region to launch such strikes. The corridor allowing goods to flow between Afghanistan and India has become an important economic pillar for Kabul. According to the World Bank, Kabul's trade with India increased 43 percent to $570 million last year, while its trade with Islamabad has shrunk from more than $4 billion a decade ago to less than $1 billion. Given the growing importance of the corridor, threats of a possible blockade was met with anger and resentment in Afghanistan. \"Their policy has always been harmful to Afghanistan,\" Ahmad Khan Ander, an Afghan military expert, told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi. \"[Pakistan] has never been a friend of Afghanistan.\" Ghaus Janbaz, an international relations expert, told Radio Azadi that Islamabad wants to shift the blame to Afghanistan instead of focusing on its domestic crises. \"[The Pakistani government] wants to show that the violence is coming from elsewhere, when all the violence is coming from within Pakistan,\" he said. As part of pressuring the Taliban, Pakistan is set to force some 850,000 documented Afghan refugees back to their country next month if they don't leave voluntarily. According to reports in Pakistani media, the expulsions, the latest in an ongoing campaign of forced deportations, are scheduled to begin on April 15. Montenegro Delays Extradition Of South Korean 'Cryptocurrency King' PODGORICA -- The Council of the Supreme Court of Montenegro has postponed the extradition of South Korean cryptocurrency entrepreneur Do Kwon to his home country despite what was said to be a final rejection earlier this week of an appeal in the Balkan state. It is a case that has elicited seemingly contradictory judicial decisions since the 32-year-old cryptomogul, described as Kwon Do Hyeong in the court document, and a business partner were detained at a Podgorica airport 12 months ago. In a press statement on March 22, the five-judge council https://sudovi.me/vrhs/sadrzaj/ONBM the postponement would be in effect \"until a decision is made on the submitted request for the protection of legality.\" The Appeals Court of Montenegro on March 20 had upheld a Podgorica Hight Court decision and thus rejected an appeal from Kwon, known as the \"Cryptocurrency King,\" to avoid execution of a South Korean Justice Ministry request for extradition. Goran Rodic, a lawyer for Kwon, said at the time that he and his client were satisfied with the decision and that it was up to Montenegro and South Korea to determine details of the presumed extradition. TerraformLabs, a company founded and headed by Kwon, was behind TerraUSD, which collapsed in May last year, shaking the cryptocurrency market. South Korea and the United States have each requested Kwon's extradition for his alleged role in the loss of investments worth more than $40 billion. Montenegro handed over his business partner, Hon Chang-joon, to South Korean authorities on February 5 before he was escorted back there based on an Interpol warrant. The two men were arrested at Podgorica airport in March 2023 as they were trying to board a private plane to Dubai using fake Costa Rican passports. Kwon has nearly completed a four-month sentence for forging a passport. Montenegrin courts have previously made different decisions regarding extradition requests from South Korea and the United States for Kwon. An initial legal interpretation suggested the decision would be made by Justice Minister Andrej Milovic, who said Kwon would be extradited to the United States because it was the first country to submit an extradition request. Montenegrin law stipulates that priority is given to the country that submits the first extradition request. A higher court then announced that the decision was not in the minister's hands because it was not a regular but an \"expedited procedure\" of extradition, in which case a court should decide. In subsequent proceedings, the Montenegrin courts interpreted the extradition requests differently. On March 25, 2023, the U.S. Embassy reportedly submitted a note to the Montenegrin Justice Ministry requesting temporary detention for the purpose of extradition of Kwon. The following day, South Korea submitted an extradition request. In a decision on February 20, the Higher Court treated the embassy's note as a request and ruled that he should be extradited to the United States, but the Court of Appeals on March 5 annulled that decision. In a second decision on March 7, the Higher Court decided that South Korea has priority for his extradition. All decisions were made by the same three-member panel of judges of the Higher Court. TerraUSD was designated as a stablecoin -- a currency pegged to stable assets like the dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. However, around $40 billion in market value was erased for investors in TerraUSD and its sister currency, Luna, after the stablecoin plunged far below its $1 peg. Kwon was subsequently charged in the United States for allegedly \"orchestrating a multibillion-dollar crypto-asset securities fraud.\" Kwon's U.S. trial is scheduled to start on March 25. Kwon has denied any wrongdoing. Ex-Prime Minister Of Bosniak-Croat Federation Begins Jail Term Fadil Novalic, the former prime minister of the Bosniak-Croat federation, one of Bosnia's two entities, has started serving a four-year prison sentence for corruption in a case regarding the purchase and importing of Chinese ventilators during the coronavirus pandemic. Fahrudin Zolak, the head of the entity's civil protection service, and entrepreneur Fikret Hodzic were also found guilty on April 5, 2023, and were sentenced to six years and five years in prison, respectively. Jelka Milicevic, the entity's finance minister, was found not guilty. The trial regarding the procurement of 5.4 million euros ($5.9 million) worth of ventilators earmarked for the entity's health-care system began in February 2021. The ventilators were purchased in April 2020 immediately after a state of emergency was declared in Bosnia amid the pandemic. The Sarajevo Prosecutor's Office opened an investigation after it emerged that 100 ventilators had been purchased without following the legal public-procurement procedure via direct negotiations with Hodzic's private company F.H. Srebrena Malina (Silver Raspberry), which deals in fresh produce. The case was subsequently transferred to state prosecutors, who confirmed the charges by the end of 2020. Novalic was charged with using budget funds to purchase the protection equipment in association with Solak and Hodzic with the aim of making a profit that would have then been divided among the three of them, while Milicevic was accused of failing to stop them. Prosecutors said that Novalic, Solak, and Hodzic had taken advantage of the state of emergency and their powers to acquire the public funds needed to buy the ventilators and that the acquisition price was inflated. Prosecutors and witnesses also claimed that the ventilators were not suitable for use in hospitals where serious cases of COVID-19 were being treated and were usable only in ambulances. The defense countered that the ventilators had been certified for hospital use. Some hospitals, like the Clinical Center of the University of Sarajevo, used the ventilators, while others refused to do so. The Prosecutor's Office and Western embassies in Bosnia have said political pressure was applied during the almost 700-day trial, with the embassies expressing support for the prosecutors. Acclaimed Iranian Singer Faramarz Aslani Dies After Cancer Diagnosis Faramarz Aslani, the acclaimed Iranian pop and folk singer, died of cancer on March 20, less than three weeks after he announced he had been diagnosed with the illness. \"On the evening of March 20, Faramarz Aslani succumbed to cancer, leaving this world during the dawn of Norouz. His departure, amidst the love of his family, brings a lasting goodbye,\" his wife, Marjan, said in a post on Instagram. Aslani was being treated in the U.S. state of Maryland when he died. On March 3, Aslani shared his cancer diagnosis, saying he was committing his remaining days to \"treatment and reflection on his deep ties to Iran's rich cultural heritage.\" Born in Tehran in 1954, Aslani studied at London University's College of Journalism before returning home in the early 1970s to start his career. Even though the 1979 Islamic Revolution prompted him to head back to England and then on to the United States, he remained a pivotal figure in Iranian music for five decades, particularly resonant during times of protest in 2009 and again during Iran's recent Women, Life, Freedom protests. His music, with flamenco-like guitar work fused with Persian poetry and contemporary sounds, created hits such as If, One Day (Age Ye Rooz). With Iran's Islamic leadership stifling music and artistic creativity, Aslani and many fellow artists established in Los Angeles a vibrant and influential community of Iranians in exile. This diaspora is widely credited with playing a pivotal role in preserving and perpetuating the legacy of Iranian pop music in the decades since the revolution. Tributes to Aslani have poured in since his death was announced, with fellow artist Dariush Eghbali describing the late singer as a \"noble human\" and \"kind friend.\" Another prominent Iranian singer, Nasrollah Moein, remembered Aslani as a \"star who can't be duplicated.\" Iranian rapper Toomaj Salehi, imprisoned for his opposition to Iran's regime, praised Aslani for continuing to be an activist for human rights in Iran at a time when some artists have compromised. Since the 1979 revolution, female vocalists have faced a blanket ban on performing, while music concerts in general have been subjected to significant regulatory hurdles. Many noted entertainers and cultural figures have been arrested for joining in or supporting protests sparked by the death in September 2022 of Mahsa Amini, who died while in police custody for an alleged head scarf violation. Written by Ardeshir Tayebi based on an original story in Persian by RFE/RL's Radio Farda Russian Vlogger Detained For Calling Russian Soldiers 'Cannon Fodder' Police in Russia's southwestern Rostov region detained vlogger Nelli Khomyachkova over a video she posted online in which she called Russian soldiers involved in Moscow’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine \"cannon fodder.\" \"What are you fighting for? Why can't you make friends with America, say you are wrong, offer friendship? Apologize to Ukraine, say we withdraw everything, and forgive us,\" the 23-year-old Khomyachkova says in the video. Khomyachkova words were reposted by many pro-Kremlin bloggers, after which local police launched a probe against her.

Russia Reportedly Plans New Wave Of Military Mobilization The Vyorstka Telegram channel on March 22 cited four sources close to the presidential office and Defense Ministry as saying that Moscow plans to soon announce a new wave of military mobilization that would seek to enlist up to 300,000 people to bolster its troops involved in the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. According to the sources, the idea to announce the mobilization came about because of the decreasing number of people willing to go to the war. After President Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilization in September 2022, tens of thousands of Russian men fled the country to avoid enlistment. Meanwhile, Mark Denisov, the ombudsman in Russia's Krasnoyarsk Krai, https://www.sibreal.org/a/32871567.html on March 21 that several penitentiaries in the Siberian region will be shut down this year due to the ongoing recruitment of inmates for the war. Denisov's statement came two days after the Russian parliament's lower chamber, the State Duma, approved in the final reading a bill allowing inmates to change their prison terms to suspended sentences without presidential clemency decrees after they sign contracts with the Defense Ministry. In November, the Kremlin admitted to recruiting inmates to the war in Ukraine saying they \"are atoning for their guilt with blood.\" Russian Poet Gets 7 Years In Prison For Anti-War Verses The OVD-Info rights group said on March 21 that a court in Moscow had sentenced poet Aleksandr Byvshev to seven years in prison on a charge of calling for terrorism and distributing false news about Russia's military. The charges stem from poems Byvshev wrote that contain verses condemning Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The verses end with a sentence: \"Hey Russia, where is your Stauffenberg?\" Claus von Stauffenberg was a Nazi German military officer who led a failed attempt in 1944 to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Investigators say by mentioning Stauffenberg in his poem, Byvshev called for the assassination of President Vladimir Putin.

Former RFE/RL Correspondent In Belarus Jailed For 3 Years The Minsk City Court on March 22 sentenced former RFE/RL correspondent Ihar Karney to three years in prison on a charge of taking part in an extremist group. Official media said Karney was sentenced for cooperating with the Belarusian Association of Journalists, which was shut down in August 2022 and declared \"extremist\" in February 2023. Belarus's independent media has been a casualty of an ongoing crackdown on civil society that started after the official results of a disputed August 2020 presidential election awarded authoritarian ruler Alyaksandr Lukashenka a sixth term in office.

Kremlin Uses Word 'War' For Ukraine Invasion Russia is now at \"war\" with Ukraine because of Western interference in what Moscow previously called a \"special military operation,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov told the Argumenty i Fakty media outlet, which is owned by the Moscow municipal government. \"We are at war. Indeed, it started as a special military operation but as soon as a clique was formed and the collective West joined in on Ukraine's side, it turned into war for us,\" Peskov was quoted as saying. \"I am convinced of that. Everyone should understand this to summon up inner strength.\" Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin has gone to great lengths to avoid calling the conflict a war, instead referring to it as a \"special military operation.\" The Kremlin has gone as far as pushing new laws through the State Duma that made referring to the conflict as a \"war\" illegal, with many people fined and jailed for \"discrediting\" the Russian forces and spreading \"false\" information by using the word. In hawkish comments Peskov often avoids, the Kremlin spokesman added that Russia must fully \"liberate\" its \"new regions\" -- four regions in Ukraine it illegally annexed during the war -- \"to protect the people in these regions and liberate the territory of these regions.\" Moscow baselessly claims that the regions are now part of Russia, but it does not control them in full. Peskov's comments come after President Vladimir Putin easily won an election last weekend that independent observers said was neither free nor fair. The vote was the first major election to take place in Russia since Putin launched his full-scale invasion. Many experts say Putin warded off even the faintest of challengers to ensure a large margin of victory that he can point to as evidence that Russians back the war in Ukraine and his handling of it. Official results gave Putin 87.3 percent of the ballots. Gershkovich Team Continues Fight To Free WSJ Reporter From Russian Jail WASHINGTON -- The U.S.-based team working to win the release of American journalist Evan Gershkovich from a Russian jail is eyeing the approach of the anniversary of his detention with a mix of hope and frustration as the ordeal heads into a second year. Gershkovich, 32, will mark one year of detention in Russia on March 29. On that day in 2023, The Wall Street Journal reporter was arrested in Yekaterinburg for alleged espionage that he, his newspaper, and the U.S. government deny. He's been held ever since in Moscow's Lefortovo prison. The anniversary will be an opportunity to increase efforts to win his release, said Paul Beckett, the newspaper's assistant editor, who spoke on March 21 at a briefing in Washington to raise awareness of the anniversary and discuss the status of his case. Beckett and other members of Gershkovich's team said that although the anniversary was frustrating, they are determined to redouble their efforts to bring Gershkovich home. \"All that we've done hasn't yet paid the one dividend we need it to,\" Beckett said. \"We really need to re-up our efforts and go at it with an even greater sense of urgency to make sure that can end this as soon as we possibly can.\" Jason Conti, a lawyer for the newspaper, said the team is anticipating the scheduling of a hearing that under Russian law must take place before the anniversary. The team, which includes Gershkovich's sister, Danielle Gershkovich, and his parents, will learn whether prosecutors request an extension of up to six months or announce that they are ready to start the trial. If it's the latter, Gershkovich will be transferred from Moscow to Yekaterinburg for what would be a secret trial behind closed doors, Conti said. Whatever the outcome of the hearing, Conti said that \"nobody thinks the legal route is the path to get Evan free\" because Russia's conviction rate is more than 99 percent. Conti said there has been a lot of behind-the-scenes activity on the diplomatic front, while publicly, Gershkovich's case has been raised directly with President Vladimir Putin in recent weeks, most notably by U.S. commentator Tucker Carlson in an interview in February. Putin told Carlson that an agreement could be reached involving a swap for a Russian national currently in jail in Germany, which was believed to be a reference to Vadim Krasikov, who is serving time for murder in Berlin. Conti said the comment indicated \"an expressed willingness to do a trade of some sort,\" but on the other hand it created a \"despicable\" scenario in which an honest journalist must be dealt for a convicted criminal. The process of \"trading humans\" is a difficult business, Conti said, but \"that's kind of where we are.\" The panel also raised the detention of RFE/RL journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, who holds U.S. and Russian citizenship and is being held in pretrial detention in Russia on a charge of violating the so-called \"foreign agent\" law. The U.S. government and RFE/RL say the charge is in reprisal for her work. Kurmasheva, who has worked for RFE/RL's Tatar-Bashkir Service for some 25 years, left Prague where she is based in mid-May because of a family emergency in her native Tatarstan, one of Russia's many republics. She was briefly detained while waiting for her return flight on June 2, 2023, at the Kazan airport, where both of her passports and phone were confiscated. After five months waiting for a decision in her case, Kurmasheva was fined 10,000 rubles ($109) for failing to register her U.S. passport with Russian authorities. Unable to leave Russia without her travel documents, Kurmasheva was detained again in October and this time charged with failing to register as a foreign agent. Two months later, she was charged with spreading falsehoods about the Russian military. If tried and convicted, Kurmasheva may face up to 10 years in prison. Unlike Gershkovich, Kurmasheva has not been designated as wrongfully detained, which would mean her case would be assigned to the Office of the Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs in the State Department, raising the political profile of her situation and allowing the Biden administration to allocate more resources to securing her release. Gershkovich was recognized as wrongfully detained less than two weeks after his arrest. Kurmasheva, who was arrested at a Russian airport on October 18 on her way home from a visit to her sick mother, has spent months in detention without the designation. Beckett said it was a technical designation that the State Department must decide but added that it would be a \"significant step for anyone who is being held hostage like Alsu.\" Only the State Department can answer why it is taking longer in her case, he added. The first anniversary of Gershkovich's detention will be marked next week by a 24-hour read-a-thon of his work by his Wall Street Journal colleagues at the newspaper's headquarters in New York and swimming events at Brighton Beaches in New Zealand, South African, Canada, the United States, and Britain. The beaches were chosen in recognition of his family's connection to Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, New York, which is home to a large Russian immigrant community. Gershkovich's parents emigrated from the Soviet Union, separately, in 1979. Beckett is encouraging people to use social media to share posts about their participation in the events at #IstandwithEvan to further raise awareness of Gershkovich's case. Danielle Gershkovich said she stays positive by exchanging letters with her brother weekly and remembering that he has maintained a sense of humor, recalling his smiles during his courtroom appearances. She said she and her parents, Ella and Mikhail Gershkovich, have been able to support one another as they face their fears and advocate for his release. Ukraine Hit By Widespread Blackouts After Massive Russian Assault Many parts of Ukraine were experiencing blackouts after a massive wave of Russian strikes on March 22 targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, killing at least four people, hitting the country's largest dam, and temporarily severing a power line at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant. Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, https://www.rferl.org/russia-invades-ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/naslidky-rosiskykh-udariv-22-bereznya/32872559.html the assault involved 150 drones and missiles and appealed again to Ukraine's allies to speed up deliveries of critically needed ammunition and weapons systems. As the full-scale invasion neared the 25-month mark, Zelenskiy aide Mykhailo Podolyak denied recent reports that the United States had demanded that its ally Kyiv stop any attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure as \"fictitious information.\" \"After two years of full-scale war, no one will dictate to Ukraine the conditions for conducting this war,\" Podolyak told the Dozhd TV channel. \"Within the framework of international law, Ukraine can 'degrease' Russian instruments of war. Fuel is the main tool of warfare. Ukraine will destroy the [Russian] fuel infrastructure.\" The Financial Times quoted anonymous sources as saying that Washington had given \"repeated warnings\" to Ukraine's state security service and its military intelligence agency to stop attacking Russian oil refineries and energy infrastructure. It said officials cited such attacks' effect on global oil prices and the risk of retaliation. The southern Zaporizhzhya region bore the brunt of the Russian assault that hit Ukraine's energy infrastructure particularly hard on March 22, with at least three people killed, including a man and his 8-year-old daughter. There were at least 20 dead and injured, in all. Ukraine's state hydropower company, Ukrhydroenerho, said the DniproHES hydroelectric dam on the Dnieper in Zaporizhzhya was hit by two Russian missiles that damaged HPP-2, one of the plant's two power stations, although there was no immediate risk of a breach. \"There is currently a fire at the dam. Emergency services are working at the site, eliminating the consequences of numerous air strikes,\" Ukrhydroenerho https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-dniprohes-vluchannia/32872534.html in a statement, adding that the situation at the dam \"is under control.\" However, Ihor Syrota, the director of national grid operator Ukrenerho, told RFE/RL that currently it was not known if power station HPP-2 could be repaired. Transport across the dam has been suspended after a missile struck a trolleybus, killing the 62-year-old driver. The vehicle was not carrying any passengers. \"This night, Russia launched over 60 'Shahed' drones and nearly 90 missiles of various types at Ukraine,\" Zelenskiy wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"The world sees the Russian terrorists' targets as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, and even a trolleybus,\" Zelenskiy wrote. Ukraine's power generating company Enerhoatom later said it has repaired a power line at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant, Europe's largest. \"Currently, the temporarily occupied Zaporizhzhya NPP is connected to the unified energy system of Ukraine by two power transmission lines, thanks to which the plant's own needs are fulfilled,\" the state's nuclear-energy operator https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-zaporizhzhia-raketnyi-udar/32872498.html on Telegram. Besides Zaporizhzhya, strikes were also reported in the Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Vinnytsya, Khmelnytskiy, Kryviy Rih, Ivano-Frankivsk, Poltava, Odesa, and Lviv regions. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, has been left completely without electricity by intense Russian strikes that also caused water shortages. \"The occupiers carried out more than 15 strikes on energy facilities. The city is virtually completely without light,\" Oleh Synyehubov, the head of Kharkiv regional military administration, https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-kharkiv-obstrily-svitlo/32872505.html on Telegram. In the Odesa region, more than 50,000 households have been left without electricity, regional officials reported. Odesa, Ukraine's largest Black Sea port, has been frequently attacked by Russia in recent months. In the Khmelnitskiy region, the local administration https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-khmelnytskyi-zahybla-poraneni/32872589.html that one person had been killed and several wounded during the Russian strikes, without giving details. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko called it \"the largest attack on the Ukrainian energy industry in recent times.\" Despite the widespread damage, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the situation remained under control, and there was no need to switch off electricity throughout the country. \"There are problems with the electricity supply in some areas, but in general, the situation in the energy sector is under control, there is no need for blackouts throughout the country,\" Shmyhal https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-shmyhal-enerhetyka/32872686.html on Telegram. Ukrenerho also said that it was receiving emergency assistance from its European Union neighbors Poland, Romania, and Slovakia. Ukraine linked its power grid with that of the EU in March 2022, shortly after the start of Russia's invasion. Ukraine's air force said its air defenses downed 92 of 151 missiles and drones fired at Ukraine by Russia in the overnight attack. \"Russian missiles have no delays, unlike aid packages for Ukraine. 'Shahed' drones have no indecision, unlike some politicians. It is critical to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions,\" Zelenskiy wrote, appealing to the West to do more for his country. \"Our partners know exactly what is needed. They can definitely support us. These are necessary decisions. Life must be protected from these savages from Moscow.\" Zelenskiy's message came as EU leaders were wrapping up a summit in Brussels where they discussed ways to speed up ammunition and weapons deliveries for the embattled Ukrainian forces struggling to stave off an increasingly intense assault by more numerous and better-equipped Russian troops. A critical $60 billion military aid package from the United States, Ukraine's main backer, remains stuck in the House of Representatives due to Republican opposition, prompting Kyiv to rely more on aid from its European allies. EU Leaders Green-Light Opening Membership Talks With Bosnia EU leaders have agreed to open talks with Bosnia-Herzegovina on joining the bloc but said \"hard work\" lies ahead for the country to move forward on its membership application. \"Congratulations! Your place is in our European family. Today's decision is a key step forward on your EU path,\" European Council President Charles Michel said on X, formerly Twitter, as leaders met in Brussels for a summit. \"Now the hard work needs to continue so Bosnia and Herzegovina steadily advances, as your people want.\" The leaders also issued a statement on the decision to give Bosnia the green light to open accession talks, saying it builds on the European Commission’s March 12 recommendation to the European Council to grant the opening of membership talks with Sarajevo. \"The European Council invites the Commission to prepare the negotiating framework with a view to its adoption by the Council the moment all relevant steps set out in the Commission recommendation of 12 October 2022 are taken,” the statement said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the European Union's executive body would recommend that member states open accession negotiations with Bosnia. “Of course, more progress is necessary to join our union,\" von der Leyen said on March 12 in a speech to the European Parliament. \"But the country is showing that it can deliver on the membership criteria, and on its citizens’ aspiration to be part of our family.” The recommendation, together with a progress report commissioned in December, were the basis for discussions by EU leaders at the summit. Bosnia was granted EU candidate status in December 2022. One year later, European leaders confirmed their readiness to grant the opening of accession talks, but also invited the European Commission to submit a report by March on the level to which key criteria had been implemented. According to EU officials, Bosnia has made more progress in the past year than in the previous decade. Despite the announcement, talks between Sarajevo and Brussels will not start immediately. A negotiating framework must be adopted first. For this to happen, Bosnia must fulfill 14 priorities. With reporting by AFP Deadly Suicide Bombing Strikes Outside Bank In Kandahar As Taliban Employees Wait For Pay A suicide bomber detonated his explosive belt outside a bank in the Afghan city of Kandahar early on March 21 as Taliban employees waited for their salaries. The bombing, later claimed by the Islamic State (IS) extremist group, killed 19 people, according to a source who spoke to RFE/RL on condition of anonymity. The source at Kandahar's Mirwais Hospital https://pa.azadiradio.com/a/32871741.html the bodies of 19 people were transported to the hospital from the scene along with 18 people who were injured. Another source quoted by the AFP news agency said 20 people had been killed. That source also spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fear of reprisal for speaking to the media. A statement from the Taliban-led government's police headquarters in Kandahar said three had been killed in the incident and 13 were injured. Inamullah Samangani, the director of information and culture for Kandahar Province, said that the situation at one of the city's hospitals where the wounded were transported was under control, denying that there was an urgent need for blood donations. \"There is no such issue, and the wounded people are not in serious condition, they have superficial injuries,\" he said in a message to journalists quoted by AFP. The bombing took place around 8 a.m. local time as people employed by the Taliban gathered outside a local branch of the New Kabul Bank to collect their salaries, reports said. Mullah Asadullah Jamshid, the spokesman of the Taliban's police headquarters in Kandahar, said most of the victims were civilians who were waiting to receive their pay. An IS fighter \"detonated his explosive belt\" near a bank in Kandahar city, said a statement from the militant group's Amaq news agency on Telegram. The statement also made reference to a \"gathering of the Taliban militia.\" One of the dead, Khalil Ahmad, a father of eight in his 40s, had gone to the bank to get his salary, said his nephew, Mohammad Shafiq Saraaj. \"We beg for security to be properly maintained in the country and especially in crowded places, and that our nation be saved from this kind of tragedy,\" Saraaj was quoted by AFP as saying. Taliban Interior Ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani told AFP that an investigation had been launched and that \"the criminals will be identified...and punished for their actions.\" The number of random bombings and suicide attacks in Afghanistan has declined since the Taliban seized power in August 2021, but multiple explosions have been reported since the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on March 11 as the regional chapter of IS and other armed groups remain a threat. The U.S. Charge d'Affaires for Afghanistan, Karen Decker, condemned the bombing at the bank as a \"cowardly act\" in statement on X, formerly Twitter, and offered condolences to the victims' families. \"Afghans should be able to observe Ramadan peacefully and without fear,\" she said . With reporting by AFP Orban Congratulates Putin On Reelection Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin on his reelection despite condemnation of the vote by many Western governments. Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said Orban congratulated Putin in a letter that also noted that the cooperation between Hungary and Russia \"enables important discussions even in challenging geopolitical contexts.\" The European Union, of which Hungary is a member, said the election had been held \"in a highly restricted environment exacerbated also by Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.\" According to Orban, maintaining a dialogue is a \"fundamental condition for establishing peace as soon as possible.\" To read the full story on RFE/RL's Hungarian Service, click here . Zelenskiy Pushes EU To Use Profits From Frozen Russian Assets To Aid Ukraine Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called on EU leaders at the opening of their two-day summit in Brussels on March 21 to \"progress on the issue of fair use of Russia's frozen assets.\" \"This year, we must use Russian assets to protect and restore life in Ukraine, which is being destroyed by the aggressor. This is fair,” he said . Ukraine's European supporters have been discussing the use of profits on frozen Russian assets to finance arms purchases for Kyiv. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said last week that the “windfall” from billions of euros in profits from the frozen assets would support arms purchases. The EU leaders had previously only considered using the profits to support the reconstruction of Ukraine. However, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said last week the main issue in Ukraine now is not so much reconstruction, but rather avoiding further destruction.” Borrell said he would propose that 90 percent of the revenues from Russian assets frozen in Europe be used to buy arms for Ukraine under the European Peace Facility fund. The remaining 10 percent would be transferred to the EU budget to be used to boost the capacity of the Ukrainian defense industry. The proposal would require the approval of all EU member states. Zelenskiy also called on his European colleagues to \"invest in Ukraine's production of drones, provide more ammunition, which is currently in short supply at the front, and help protect Ukrainian cities from Russian air strikes.\" Existing air defense systems are not enough to protect the entire territory of Ukraine from Russian air strikes, he said, adding that the number of air defense systems needed is “achievable.” Zelenskiy also told the summit that allowing Russia to continue selling grain in the European Union while capping imports from Ukraine was unfair. \"Russian access to the European agricultural market is still unrestricted,\" Zelenskiy said, speaking over video link. \"When Ukrainian grain is dumped on roads or railway tracks, Russian products are still taken to Europe, as well as goods from...Belarus. It's not fair,” Zelenskiy said, referring to the dumping of Ukrainian grain from rail transport wagons last month in Poland. “It is even more unfair when someone tries to destroy systemic trade solutions that have existed for years and work to support the whole of Europe,\" Zelenskiy said. The 27-nation bloc dropped tariffs on Ukrainian imports at the beginning of the war in a bid to help keep the country's economy afloat, but the moves have drawn fierce protests from EU farmers who complain they are being undercut by lower-cost imports from Ukraine. While the EU has taken aim at other parts of Russia's economy through sanctions, it has avoided targeting the farm or fertilizer sectors over fears of destabilizing the global cereal market and undermining food security in Asia and Africa. But EU member states and lawmakers on March 20 reached a deal to cap duty-free imports of a range of Ukrainian farm goods and the European Commission said last week it was also looking at restrictions on Russian farm imports. Five European Union nations -- Poland, Czech Republic, and all three Baltic states -- urged the bloc to impose a full ban on grain imports from both Russia and Belarus. \"As members of the EU, we believe it is imperative to fulfil our moral obligation to halt any trade activities that could potentially bolster\" Russia and Belarus, the nations' farming ministers said in a joint letter. With reporting by AFP First F-16s Should Be In Ukraine This Summer, Says Dutch Defense Minister KYIV -- Dutch Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren says Ukraine should receive its first F-16 fighter jets this summer as Europe pushes to aid Kyiv amid complications sparked by a stalled aid package in the U.S. Congress. Ollongren told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service during a visit to Kyiv on March 21 that a plan to deliver 24 F-16s jets is on track, with the first aircraft coming from Denmark. Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, https://www.rferl.org/russia-invades-ukraine. \"I think we are on track to see deliveries, first Danish this summer, and then we're going to scale up,\" she said while declining to give the exact number of planes involved in the first delivery. \"We know that we will start with the Danish F-16s, that is now in our planning and in the Ukrainian planning. And in the end, I mean, it doesn't matter anymore. If it's a Dutch or Danish or Norwegian F-16 because [the planes are] going to be Ukrainian.\" The arrival of the fighter jets will be a long-awaited development to help Kyiv fill a crucial hole in its defense capabilities. Russia has used its more advanced and more numerous jets to repeatedly bomb Ukrainian cities, slow its counteroffensive, and threaten its ships exporting grain crucial to its economic survival, making Kyiv’s acquisition of modern U.S. jets a key ingredient to its successful defense of the country. Ukraine inherited an aging fleet of Soviet MiG and Sukhoi jets that lack the strike depth and technology of modern Russian jets, putting Kyiv at a significant disadvantage in the war. Ukraine also has a much smaller fleet than Russia. The more advanced F-16s would allow Ukrainian pilots to strike deep into Russian controlled areas and with great accuracy, intercept missiles that have terrorized Ukraine cities, and take on Russian jets that threaten its shipping lanes. Ollongren said the key to the effectiveness of the jets will be the training of both pilots and technical staff to ensure they operate at peak performance. \"It is of no use if you don't know how to use [them] most effectively, and that requires training and that requires the right people for the maintenance and the right infrastructure. So when you get [them], you know that you will be able to use [them],\" she said. \"So once...Ukraine gets the F-16, everything has to be in place, including, of course, how to protect them.\" Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the country has been backed by the United States, the European Union, and other Western allies. But a new $60-billion aid package to Ukraine has been stalled in the U.S. House of Representatives as Republican lawmakers demand deep changes to domestic immigration policy. With Washington's funding spigots turned off for the time being, the European Union has been moving to increase its assistance. Earlier this week, the European Council approved the creation of the Ukraine Assistance Fund (UAF) and earmarked 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) for it to be used for the provision of both \"lethal and nonlethal military equipment and training.\" Ollongren said the holdup in the United States on new aid is \"a bit frustrating,\" but given the threat Russia's aggression poses to Europe, the 27-nation EU will continue to push to increase aid levels. \"We are working on increasing production levels...For Ukraine, it's an existential threat. But for Europe, it's also an existential threat. So it is in our best interest,\" to continue aid to Kyiv, she said. \"It's also in the America's best interest to continue that support and to step it up and to do more,\" she added. Residents Of Russian Region Bordering Ukraine Urged To Leave Residents of the Graivoronsky urban district of Russia's Belgorod region bordering Ukraine have been advised by authorities to temporarily leave the area, which has been frequently targeted by drones and missile attacks from Ukrainian and Ukraine-aligned forces. “I ask you to make the right decision and temporarily leave the border areas,” district head Gennady Bondarev wrote on the VKontakte social media network, adding that authorities in Yaroslavl, some 1,000 kilometers northeast of Graivoronsky, were ready to temporarily accommodate those willing to leave. He added that authorities would arrange their departure.

Arrest Warrant For Self-Exiled Russian Rights Defender A Moscow court has issued an arrest warrant for the self-exiled founder of the Gulagu.net group, which monitors inmates' rights. The warrant was issued on March 21 after the Federal Security Service launched a probe against Vladimir Osechkin on a charge of justifying terrorism. It is not clear what the charge is linked to. Osechkin fled Russia in 2020 after an arrest warrant was issued for him in a separate case on fraud charges, which Osechkin has rejected as politically motivated. In 2022, another probe was launched against him on charges of spreading \"false' data about Russian troops involved in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Apple Reportedly Removes Navalny's Voting App At Russia's Request Apple, at the direction of Russia's media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, has removed an app (Photon-2024) created by the team of late Russian anti-corruption crusader Aleksei Navalny to help users vote for candidates other than President Vladimir Putin, Navalny associate Ivan Zhdanov https://twitter.com/ioannZH/status/1770508878901280821 on X, formerly Twitter. \"By deleting it, Apple shows compliance in stifling dissent, betraying those fighting for democracy,\" Zhdanov's post said. Navalny died in a remote prison in February in unclear circumstances. Putin easily won an election last weekend. Apple has yet to comment on the status of the app in its online store. Russia, China Ties 'Vital' For Belgrade Says Acting Serbian PM Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic, who is also acting prime minister, said on March 21 that relations with Russia and China are in Belgrade's \"vital national interest.\" Speaking to Serbian media after meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, Dacic thanked Russia for its \"firm\" stance and support for Serbia on the issue of Kosovo. A U.S. State Department spokesman, in response to a request from RFE/RL for comment on the meeting, said the United States does not believe any country “should provide Mr. Putin a platform to promote or justify his ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine.\" To read the original story by RFE/RL's Balkan Service, https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/dacic-odnosi-rusija-kina-srbija/32871591.html.

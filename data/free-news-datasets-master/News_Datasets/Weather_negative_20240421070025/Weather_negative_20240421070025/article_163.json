    "text": "Water supply levels across the province are low. Since December, the Saint Mary River Irrigation District, the largest irrigation district in North America, has been sending monthly updates on what the season could look like. Last week, the Smriti forecasting showed a preliminary water allocation of eight inches at the farm gate. That’s a pretty severe restriction. On a regular year when we have good water supply, we would normally be setting our allocation in the 1516 inch range. So to be down at 8 inches is basically almost a 50% reduction. Well, a finalized number is set to be released at the annual general meeting on April 3rd. David Westwood says it’s important to inform irrigators early so they can make decisions on the types of crops they want to plant. Doctor Willamine Apples, a senior research chair at the Lethbridge College, says certain crops might be limited this year. You could take some water from a crop that might suffer a little bit more or can take a little bit of a hit like weed and move that onto your potatoes. But yeah, with eight inches, you’re probably not going to grow the same amount of of potatoes and sugar beets that you would otherwise do. Which has some farmers turning to purchasing crop insurance. Have seen some increases in participation after large droughts. 2022 there was an uptick we went from roughly 79% across the province up to about 82% this year. In particular with some of the spring soil moisture conditions and irrigators talking about potential restrictions on the irrigated water, I think it’s very important to take a look at it. And while a drought looms, discussions with the province and other irrigation districts along with municipalities continue to ensure supply for everyone. We’re in the process of drafting some water sharing agreements or commitments amongst ourselves to make sure that everybody has access to water, just probably not as much as they normally do, Westwood says. An agreement could be in place by the end of April. Sarah Jones, Global News.",

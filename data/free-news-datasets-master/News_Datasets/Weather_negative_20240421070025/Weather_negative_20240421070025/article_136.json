    "text": "Flooding rain is very possible Saturday as a nor'easter works up the coast Saturday. Damaging winds will be possible, too. Then, coastal flooding will get the shore next week. Enter your favorite South Jersey spring scenes for [Joe Martucci's Photo Contest](https://pressofatlanticcity.com/contests/spring-photo-contest/)! Storm summary Rain will begin between 1 and 4 a.m. Saturday. Expect a washout, with afternoon thunderstorms possible. Rain will then end between 5 and 7 p.m. Road, stream and creek flooding will be a concern. Winds will be strong Saturday afternoon into Sunday. Power outages and wind damage will be possible. Coastal flooding will develop Sunday and may last until Wednesday. Flood watch A flood watch was issued Thursday afternoon by the National Weather Service for Saturday. This includes all of South Jersey and the Jersey Shore. People are also reading… In all, expect one to two inches of rain west of a line from Millville to Mays Landing to Toms River. East of there, 2 to 3½ inches of rain will be likely. Since fall, New Jersey has been plain wet. With another record rain occurring two Saturdays ago, farmers and residents are cautiously optistimic that all this rain could be a good thing. A dry, chilly Friday After being absent from the Northeast most of the winter, the polar vortex is now here, just as soon as winter wraps up. It'll be a cold morning. Inland lows will be 20-25 degrees inland and near 30 at the shore. That's more like a January morning than a late March one. Afternoon highs will be 45-50 degrees. The fire weather danger will be lower than Thursday's. Still, it's wise to limit your burning outside. Humidity in the Pinelands will stay low, and the ground will still be dry. The winds will just be much calmer. Early sun will give way to clouds. You'll have a cloudy but rain-free Friday evening. That'll signal the incoming storm. Light rain showers will begin 1 to 4 a.m. Saturday. Saturday morning Winds and rain intensity will increase. Expect a steady, light rain, turning moderate. Winds will be breezy out of the southeast. Gusts of 20 to 30 mph will be likely. While this will cancel most of your outdoor work or plans, there won't be any significant problems. Saturday afternoon This will be the worst part of the storm. A windswept rain will create the possibility of flooding. It'll definitely be tough driving either way. A steady rain will fall, accumulating a half-inch per hour at the peak. With the ground getting soaked, it leaves trees and power lines more vulnerable to being blown over by the wind. Winds will come from the southeast, and then the northeast. Expect sustained winds of 20 to 30 mph. Gusts will clock over 40 to 45 mph. Saturday night-Sunday Wind damage and power outage concerns will continue. Strong winds out of the north will howl in the 40s. Temperatures will take a tumble into the 30s. Wind chills will be in the 20s. Sunday will then rise up to around 50 degrees, so we'll drop the wind chills. Coastal flooding Minor stage coastal flooding will start during the Sunday p.m. high tide and then at least into the Monday high tides. Since we're not near the full or new moon, I expect this to be minor stage flooding, the nuisance kind we see a few dozen times a year. Traveling around the bayside towns will be OK, but watch for the salt water. Don't drive through it. It's a little unusual to have coastal flooding after a coastal storm, but that's what we have. That's because the onshore winds don't pick up until Saturday afternoon and strong winds will carry after the storm into Sunday. Then, there's another storm way offshore early next week that will throw onshore winds our way. That'll funnel water into the bays. A final note Finally, Thursday was in unusual company. More than likely, March 21 was the coldest day of the month. According to the Iowa Environmental Mesonet, that only happens 15% of the time at Atlantic City International Airport in Egg Harbor Township. In Atlantic City, it's only happened 19% of the time.

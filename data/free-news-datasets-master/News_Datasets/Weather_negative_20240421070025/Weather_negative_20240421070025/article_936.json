    "text": "The first storm of the spring season will sweep across the Inland Empire this weekend, producing wind, rain and thunderstorms, as well as snowfall at the higher elevations, according to the National Weather Service.\nThe agency said that a trough of low pressure and advancing cold front will reach the region by Saturday morning, pushing from northwest to southeast throughout the day and most of Sunday.\n“This weather system will bring cooler, wetter and windier conditions to Southern California, with periods of mountain snow down to 4,500 to 5,500 feet,” the NWS said in a statement. “Periods of moderate rain are expected … with guidance indicating rain rates of .25-.35 inches per hour. After the front passes, shower coverage will become more scattered. Showers will be moderate to locally heavy at times.”\nThe Riverside metropolitan area, along with the Temecula and San Jacinto valleys, are likely to receive anywhere from a quarter-inch to two inches of rain, depending on the location and intensity of the downpours that develop, forecasters said.\nRainfall is expected to be light in the desert areas.\nPeriodic thunderstorms are in the forecast for western Riverside County on Saturday night and all of Sunday.\n“Snowfall of less than three inches is expected below 5,000 feet, three to six inches from 5,000 to 6,000 feet, six to 12 inches from 6,000 to 7,500 feet, with locally 12 to 18 inches above 7,500 feet,” according to the Weather Service.\nThe wet weather will persist throughout both Saturday and Sunday, dissipating Sunday night, according to meteorologists.\nWindy conditions are also anticipated, with the strongest gusts Saturday night and Sunday.\n“Peak gusts of 30 to 45 mph are expected, with the strongest winds looking to be Sunday afternoon (in the valleys),” the NWS stated. “Gusty westerly winds are also expected on the desert mountain slopes into the deserts. Strongest winds will be Saturday evening into Sunday morning, with peak gusts 55 to 65 mph.”\nDaytime temperatures in the Riverside metropolitan area will peak at 60 degrees Saturday and Sunday, with lows in the mid 40s.\nIn the Coachella Valley, the mercury will peak in the low 70s Saturday, with a low around 50, and the daytime high won’t climb beyond the low 60s Sunday, with overnight lows in the upper 40s.\nIn the Temecula Valley, temps will stall in the mid 50s during the day Saturday and Sunday, with lows around 40.\nTemperatures will increase going into early next week, with generally clear conditions, according to the NWS.",

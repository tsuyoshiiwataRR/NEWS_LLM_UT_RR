    "text": "By Cassandra Llamas Fossen ,\n52 minutes ago\nWAYNE COUNTY (WWJ) - Spring sprung an early April Fools joke on Metro Detroiters as a winter storm continues to grip much of the region and turned local freeways into traffic-snarled sheets of slick snow on Friday morning.\nThe hazardous road conditions reported in areas of Oakland County, Wayne County, Washtenaw County, Monroe County and more had many drivers wondering, \"where are the salt trucks?\"\nWayne County Deputy Director of Public Services Scott Cabauatan said they've been preparing for the storm all week, but its impacting some areas with whiteout conditions while others hardly have any snow accumulations at all.\n\"We're seeing a lot of snow up in the northern part portions of the county, especially in the northwest portions of the county,\" Cabauatan said. \"Northville, Northville Township, Plymouth, Plymouth Township, Livonia -- we're seeing a lot of snow on the roads that's coming in kind of quick on us.\"\nRoad crews began treating and plowing roads ealy Friday morning and continue to address problem areas, but it is a slow going.\n\"We are dealing with traffic just like everybody else right now as the morning commute is on or has been on, and so it is kind of slowing our snow removal operations right now,\" Cabauatan added. \"But we are out there and performing de-icing and snow plowing operations.\"\nSpring may be officially here, but the country remained response ready and had only removed a few plows from their fleet of trucks when the storm, called an Alberta Clipper, blew in overnight.\n\"So it is Michigan,\" he laughed.\nMultiple crashes continue to plague Metro Detroit, but the snowfall has lightened up some.\nThe lull will last through the early afternoon hours, but WWJ's AccuWeather Meteorologist Dean DeVore said the snow returns for the afternoon commute.\nTo help out snow removal operations, Cabauatan advised residents that don't need to go anywhere to stay at home and stay off the road.\n\"If you don't have to go out this morning, take it easy and just let us do our jobs, get the roads cleared,\" he said. \"If you must go out today, plan for extra time in your commute -- we're seeing a lot of traffic backups because of accidents... take it easy, you know, please do not crowd the plow.\"\nA Winter Weather Advisory is in full effect Friday morning until midnight Saturday for most of Southeast Michigan with forecasters with the National Weather Service warning residents in the northern suburbs to prepare for several inches of snow.\nThe initial advisory includes Shiawassee, Genesee, Lapeer, St. Clair, Livingston, Oakland and Macomb Counties. Washtenaw and Wayne Counties have been added, although the advisory for both counties will expire at 2 p.m. Friday.\nAnn Arbor and Detroit will see roughly 3 to 4 inches of snowfall while Howell, Pontiac, Port Huron and more will see accumulations of 4 to 6 inches. Accumulations from 6-7 inches is expected in a small area of northern Oakland County, Flint and up into the Tri-Cities area.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

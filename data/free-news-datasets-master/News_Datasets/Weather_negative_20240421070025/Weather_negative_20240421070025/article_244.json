    "text": "Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible which could produce large hail and strong winds. Expect heavy rainfall and lightning. ABILENE, Texas — A classic Abilene restaurant closed its doors for the final time Thursday after almost 28 years of service. Gloria Hermosillo, owner of Gloria's Grill, loves to cook. She said she has enjoyed being able to provide a good burger in a good atmosphere. Hermosillo said opening her own restaurant was a dream come true. “I thought I’ll put out the best burger in town,” said Hermosillo. “I never dreamed it would be as tremendous and as great as it’s been.” The business announced its plan to close on Facebook, saying their last day of service would be March 21. Since that announcement, Hermosillo said there has been a huge outpouring of support from the community, with everyone wanting to eat one last burger. “I wanted to bring my friends from Triumph Public High Schools to eat with us here on the last day of Gloria’s, and to get my final chili cheese burger,\" said customer Brian Florence. There was a line out the door on their last day of business. “It was taking people an hour, hour and a half wait just to get to the counter and order, and then again probably another hour and a half two hours to get their food,... and people waited,\" said Hermosillo. “The food and the fellowship, it’s just you know they’re good people,\" said customer Jimmie Graham. \"We’re gonna miss them.” A new chapter begins for Hermosillo now. “We’re retiring,\" she said. \"It’s time to retire.” She has hopes of traveling, spending more time with family, and taking it easy. “My granddaughter, the first thing she asked is 'Will you have lunch with me?' I said 'yes, I can go have lunch now.'\" Hermosillo said she is going to miss her fellow friends. “I’m one of the few restaurants that remembers her customers, remembers their names,\" she said. \"I remember if they’re not here on a day they’re supposed to be here.” The closure of Gloria’s Grill will certainly be felt by those who made eating here a part of their lives. “Happy town for them and sad town for us, but I understand and I just wanted to try it the last day,\" said customer Danny Graham. \"Gotta get my Gloria’s burger and it’s the best burger in Abilene.” Hermosillo said she is thankful for all of the support from the community the past 27 years. “I’m very honored to have been able to serve them.”",

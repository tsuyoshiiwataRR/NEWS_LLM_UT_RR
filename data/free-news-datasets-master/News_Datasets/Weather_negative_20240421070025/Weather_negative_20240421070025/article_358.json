    "text": "Massive tree topples onto Boston home Massive tree topples onto Boston home TODD DOUG, GOOD MORNING. THE HOMEOWNERS WERE JUST SITTING DOWN GETTING READY TO MAKE DINNER WHEN THE TREE CAME CRASHING DOWN, COMING TO A REST RIGHT THERE ON THE ROOF, YOU SEE BEHIND ME. SKY FIVE WAS OVER THE HOME YESTERDAY HERE ON CHILKAT PLACE. CRAIG PEARSON SAYS HE WAS JUST FEET AWAY WHEN THIS HAPPENED. THE TREE RIPPED THROUGH THE INSULATION AND TORE APART DRYWALL AND GOT HUNG UP ON A GAS LINE. THANKFULLY, NO ONE WAS HURT. CRAIG SAYS THE TREE FELL ONTO THE PART OF THE HOME THAT THEY ADDED ON ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO, AND WITH THE HELP OF A FRIEND, THEY WERE ABLE TO PATCH UP THE ROOF TO GET THROUGH THE NIGHT. IT ONLY LASTED LIKE TWO SECONDS. IT WAS JUST A BIG CRASH. AND THEN THERE’S THE BIG HOLE. I MEAN, IT DIDN’T TAKE LONG IN NORWOOD A TREE CRUSHED A CAR AS THE DRIVER WAS TAKING HIS FATHER TO THE GROCERY STORE. THIS WAS ALSO A CLOSE CALL. ONE BRANCH PIERCED THE WINDSHIELD, MISSING THE DRIVER BY JUST INCHES. NEITHER THE DRIVER NOR HIS FATHER WERE HURT BACK HERE IN BOSTON, THE HOMEOWNER SAYS AN ARBORIST WILL BE HERE TODAY TO TAKE CARE OF THE TREE. THEY’RE HOPING TO GET THE ROOF PATCHED UP A LITTLE BIT BETTER BEFORE THE RAIN MOVES IN. LATER TONIGHT. REPORTING LIVE THIS MORNING IN Advertisement Massive tree topples onto Boston home Strong winds toppled trees onto homes and cars on Thursday.

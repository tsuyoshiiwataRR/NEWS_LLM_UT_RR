    "text": "WOODSTOCK, Ill. (CBS) -- People spent Friday making their way around the springtime snow covering Chicago and its northern suburbs , which began coming down overnight.\nWoodstock clocked 6.5 inches of snow by early Friday afternoon.\nStreet crews there have been able to keep up with this snow, coming by periodically to clear away whatever's collected and lay down a little salt.\nAnd CBS 2 found a lot of people who live in the area doing the same. That includes William Bowden, who uses his snowblower not just in his own home but also in clearing the way for his neighbors for free.\nHe said that he enjoys this weather, and he's helped out his neighbors in the past, including one woman who got stuck in her driveway during the last snowstorm.\nPeople CBS 2 talked with took the weather in stride, saying it's just part of living in the Chicago area.\n\"Cleaning it up. If it falls, clean it up,\" Bowden said. \"This is awesome. I love the snow. This is like gold falling. Thank you, lord.\"\n\"I mean, I grew up with it. This is Chicago. This is what you expect. It's not spring until the Cubs have been playing back at Wrigley for a month already,\" added Paul Gardner. \"You learn to love the seasons, living this far north.\"\nMore from CBS News Meet the Chicago woman who helped bring robots to Chicago restaurants Chicago-area native found dead after going missing during hike in California Woman critically hurt after being hit with car during argument in South Austin Snow Friday in Chicago area with winter storm warning in effect for some counties In: Chicago Snow Storm",

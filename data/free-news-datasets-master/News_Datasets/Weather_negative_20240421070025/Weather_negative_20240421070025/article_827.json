    "text": "Legislature postponing Veto Day until Tuesday due to winter storm The South Dakota Legislature is postponing Veto Day to avoid a major winter weather system forecasted to hit the region. Legislative Research Council Interim Director John McCullough said they’re pushing the last day of session back one day from Monday to Tuesday. The [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/abr/) says a weather system pushing through Sunday into Monday could bring over a foot of snow in some areas. A Winter Storm Watch has been posted for the entire forecast area. Here are some images with the latest information concerning the upcoming storm potential.— NWS Aberdeen (@NWSAberdeen) [#sdwx] [#mnwx] [pic.twitter.com/qdAn8VzqiA] [March 22, 2024] Even when lawmakers do meet, they won’t have much to discuss. The governor didn’t issue any vetoes this year – the first time that’s happened in the state since 1955. Despite this, the Legislature still needs to meet to officially gavel out this session. Three legislative committees - the Joint Committee on Appropriations, the Executive Board, and the Session Planning Committee - have also pushed planned Monday meetings back to Tuesday. Details on times are available on the [Legislature's website](https://sdlegislature.gov/).",

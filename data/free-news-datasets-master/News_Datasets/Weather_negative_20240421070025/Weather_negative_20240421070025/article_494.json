    "text": "After a sunny and chilly Friday in Connecticut, Saturday\nwill bring heavy rain, a mix of snow in parts of the state and a potential for flooding, the National Weather Service said.\nThe inclement weather will start late Friday night, bringing a wintry mix of rain and snow to northern parts of the state that could result in slippery roads Saturday morning.\nThe weather service has issued flood watches across all of Connecticut. The watches are in effect from early Saturday until early Sunday.\nSouthern parts of Connecticut are expected to see more than 2.5 inches of rain.\n\"Rain develops Friday night after midnight, with a six to eight-hour period of moderate to heavy rain expected late Saturday morning into the afternoon,\" the\nweather service said. \"This will likely lead to scattered to widespread minor urban and poor drainage flooding with a localized flash flood threat during this time.\"\nThe agency said the rain is expected to taper off from west to east Saturday night, however, \"there could be some lingering flooding, especially on some rivers and streams.\"\nNorthern Connecticut should see the precipitation start as either snow, or a mix of rain and sleet or snow tonight. That could lead to slippery roads on Saturday morning.\nWinter weather advisories have been issued for Litchfield and Hartford counties from late Friday and into Saturday morning.\n\"Precipitation will initially spread from west to east as snow, before transitioning to a wintry mix of rain, freezing rain, sleet, and snow, and ultimately to all rain. Sheltered valleys may see a later transition to rain and higher accumulations of ice and snow,\"\nthe weather service said.\nThe agency said drivers should \"plan on slippery road conditions.\"\nWhile northern portions of Massachusetts could see over an inch of snow, northern Connecticut is expected to get less than a quarter-inch.\nAhead of the storm, Friday should be dry and see a mix of sun and increasing clouds. Highs will be in the upper 30s to low 40s. Wind will make it feel much colder, with wind chill values in the teens in some places.\nSaturday should see highs in the low 50s during the rain event.\nAfter the rain dries up, Sunday will end the weekend with mostly to partly sunny skies and highs in the 40s.",

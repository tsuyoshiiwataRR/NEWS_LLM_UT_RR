    "text": "Low snowfall and warmer than usual temperatures have forced the early closure of the winter alpine operations at Manning Park Resort. Sunday (March 24) will be the last day of alpine operations. “Despite the heroic and at times herculean efforts of our alpine team this season, Mother Nature has dealt us and many of our industry colleagues, significant blows with the abnormally low snowfall combined with unseasonably warm weather,” said MPR general manager Vern Schram. “Despite all our efforts, we simply don’t have enough snow to safely continue our alpine operations.” While the climate was cruel to alpine skiers, the hill has been blessed with very favourable Nordic conditions this winter and will continue to offer patrons a few more days of operations. Nordic operations will be closed from March 25 to 29 and will reopen for one final weekend this season, from March 30 to April 1. “I want to take a moment to thank you, our valued guests, for your tremendous support during a season that provided many twists and turns and made us wonder if we would have a winter season at all,” Schram said in an email to resort guests and supporters. “Your patience and understanding as we strived to provide you with the best possible experience during these difficult times, was appreciated more than you can imagine. Your positive comments throughout the season, pushed us even more to keep the season going as long as we possibly could. Our team truly wishes we could have made the season last longer for your enjoyment.” For more information on the ski resort visit [manningpark.com. ](https://manningpark.com/)",

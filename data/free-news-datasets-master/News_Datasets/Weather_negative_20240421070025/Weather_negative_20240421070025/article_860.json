    "text": "A Flood Advisory has been issued Friday in Broward County, according to the National Weather Service. The advisory lasts until 4:30 p.m. and covers Fort Lauderdale, Pembroke Pines, Hollywood, Miramar, Davie, and more. In preparation for a [busy weekend in South Florida](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/miami-open-tennis-2024/3252784/) with different events taking place in our cities, it looks like we’ll be in the crosshairs for [active weather.](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/heavy-rain-expected-during-busy-weekend-in-south-florida-this-is-what-to-expect/3263801/) Get South Florida local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. [Sign up for NBC South Florida newsletters.] A warm front is coming our way. An area of low pressure is working across the northern Gulf of Mexico and pushing a warm front across our area on Friday. This will spread tropical air across South Florida, with the heaviest rain and best chance for thunderstorms by the second half of the day. With the low-pressure center, there is a chance for isolated tornadoes, strong wind, and flooding. Heavy rain will move in midday, but the most intense storms are expected to move in late Friday evening. A Flood Watch is in effect through Saturday for 2-4 inches of rainfall and 6+ inches locally. A Wind Advisory is also in effect until 8 p.m. Saturday with sustained winds expected at 20-25 mph with gusts up to or over 40 mph. THIS WEEKEND IN SOUTH FLORIDA This is important to have in mind [if you’re planning to attend an event such as Ultra](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/miami-music-week-2024-see-the-events-leading-up-to-ultras-grand-finale/3262321/), which is taking place at Bayfront Park in Downtown Miami — an area that is not strange to flooding. We will stay locked into this unstable air mass into Saturday, with periods of heavy rain throughout the day. By the end of the day, things will look to clear out and we improve by the second half of the weekend. It's still early, so stay with NBC6 and the [First Alert Weather](https://www.nbcmiami.com/weather/nbc-6-todays-forecast-first-alert-weather-south-florida/1883450/) Team as we continue to analyze the data and fine-tune the forecast.",

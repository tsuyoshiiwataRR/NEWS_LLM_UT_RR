    "text": "I have been trying to figure out this problem for days. I used to have a samba server and ssh server up and running in Ubuntu that I could connect to from my raspberry pi. I am unable to connect to either from any device now. I am led to believe that the problem is with ubuntu and not the individual services as I get the same \"Connection reset by peer\" error message for both. here is a the output from my attempts to connect via ssh\nOpenSSH_9.2p1 Debian-2+deb12u2, OpenSSL 3.0.11 19 Sep 2023 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 19: include /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/*.conf matched no files debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 21: Applying options for * debug2: resolve_canonicalize: hostname xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is address debug3: expanded UserKnownHostsFile '~/.ssh/known_hosts' -> '/home/USER/.ssh/known_hosts' debug3: expanded UserKnownHostsFile '~/.ssh/known_hosts2' -> '/home/USER/.ssh/known_hosts2' debug3: ssh_connect_direct: entering debug1: Connecting to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx [xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx] port 22. debug3: set_sock_tos: set socket 3 IP_TOS 0x10 debug1: Connection established. debug1: identity file /home/USER/.ssh/id_rsa type -1 debug1: identity file /home/USER/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /home/USER/.ssh/id_ecdsa type -1 debug1: identity file /home/USER/.ssh/id_ecdsa-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /home/USER/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk type -1 debug1: identity file /home/USER/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /home/USER/.ssh/id_ed25519 type -1 debug1: identity file /home/USER/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /home/USER/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk type -1 debug1: identity file /home/USER/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /home/USER/.ssh/id_xmss type -1 debug1: identity file /home/USER/.ssh/id_xmss-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /home/USER/.ssh/id_dsa type -1 debug1: identity file /home/USER/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1 debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.2p1 Debian-2+deb12u2 kex_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer Connection reset by xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx port 22\nhas anyone seen these error messages before and have any insight into how to resolve them? I have checked the /etc/ssh/ssh.allowed and deny files and ssh.deny was empty so I added my local IP for the pi for good measure. I have also tried reconfiguring ssh and un/reinstalling it both on Ubuntu and the pi to see if that works. ANy help is appreciated",

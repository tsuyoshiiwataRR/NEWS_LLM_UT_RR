    "text": "It is still a FOX 26 STORM ALERT DAY through late tonight as a few more rounds of storms are still possible across the Houston area. Look for a few strong storms this evening through about 9 pm. Another line of strong storms is possible overnight from 11 p.m. until 4 a.m. as a cold front pushes through. The main threats with these storms would be marginally severe hail near 1\" and a brief strong wind gust near 50-60 mph. Heavy rain could lead to a few more flooded streets across the Houston area so be careful and avoid flooded roads if possible. A cold front will bring in some drier air just in time for your weekend plans. Comfortable and quiet weather is expected this weekend with high temperatures in the 70s and overnight lows in the 50s. Another round of storms and heavy rain will likely impact the area for the return to work on Monday. Make sure to download the Fox 26 News App and Weather App to get updates on the weather that could impact your Thursday night plans! Also, check out our smart TV streaming app FOX Local for extended weather coverage and other special features like the upcoming solar eclipse!

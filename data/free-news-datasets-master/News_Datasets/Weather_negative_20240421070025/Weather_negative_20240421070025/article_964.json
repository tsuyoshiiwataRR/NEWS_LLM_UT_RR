    "text": "FIRST ALERT: Windy and dry conditions Sunday AMARILLO, Texas (KFDA) - An incoming system is looking to bring high winds and dry conditions to the region. An approaching system will actually begin to kick up our winds on Saturday, with 20+ mph winds out of the southeast. Thanks to this element, humidity is higher on Saturday, keeping fire danger a little lower. Once the system gets closer Sunday, we’ll see higher, and drier winds. Winds will already be stout Sunday morning, but could be sustained around 30-40 mph by the afternoon, with gusts over 60 mph expected. This will cause visibility issues with blowing dust, and with relative humidity values down around 15%, critical fire danger will return. Thankfully, a cold front arrives late Sunday into Monday, that’ll drop temperatures and bring winds down as well. But until then, secure loose outdoor items, and practice smart fire safety.

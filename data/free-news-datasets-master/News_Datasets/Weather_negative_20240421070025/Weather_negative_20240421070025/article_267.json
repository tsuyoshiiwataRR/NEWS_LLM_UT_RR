    "text": "A utility company is praying for some prolonged sunshine so it can finally complete sewage repair work off the coast of\nCornwall. Last summer South West Water (SWW) towed a huge rig platform off Polperro near Looe in south east Cornwall with a view to carry out major repairs to its outfall sewage pipe which goes out to sea.\nThe company's specialist engineers and divers had been hoping to complete the work within a few days last summer but the\nweather has been so unprecedentedly awful that the rig, which looks a little bit like an offshore oil platform, has remained in situ for months and the work remains incomplete.\nSWW said storms over the past few months have damaged some of the equipment onboard the platform, including access ladders, while also forcing the company to jack up the rig high above the water to reduce the impact of the bad weather. A spokeswoman for the firm said jacking up the platform means it takes longer for its it personnel to do the work safely.\nRead next:\nRogue beavers appear at Cornwall nature reserve and no-one knows why\nRead next:\nSolar farms bigger than Truro would create 'glass and concrete prison'\nThe spokeswoman said the winter storms has also further damaged the outfall pipe, damaged the seabed and made unwater current too strong and dangerous for divers to complete their repair dives.\nSWW has also been forced to bring additional equipment to the harbour area in Polperro. The spokeswoman said the work to the sewage outfall pipe had now been partly completed, adding: \"The rig in Polperro was set up to allow us to carry out major repair works to an underwater outfall pipe.\nClick here to join CornwallLive on WhatsApp and we'll send breaking news and top stories directly to your phone.

If you’re curious, you can read our Privacy Notice.\n\"Whilst the majority of the work was completed through last autumn, intermittent poor weather conditions made it unsafe to fully finish the work and caused further damage to the outfall pipe and the rig.\n“The pipe is now operating correctly but we need to fully encase it to protect it from future damage. In perfect sea conditions, with 16-hour shifts this will take around a week to complete, which we will finish as soon as conditions are safe for our teams. Our divers need calm conditions so everything gets done safely.\n\"Once the work is complete we will need calm conditions to tow the rig back to\nPlymouth.\"",

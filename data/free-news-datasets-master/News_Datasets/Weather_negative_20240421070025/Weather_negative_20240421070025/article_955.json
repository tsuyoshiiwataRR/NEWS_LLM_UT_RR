    "text": "Headlines: NOW: Storm Team Meteorologist Michele Powers says it's quiet and dry, but a coastal storm is on the way. FORECAST: The costal storm will merge with a front to our west, increasing the chance of heavy rain up and down the I-95 corridor. The rain will start early tomorrow morning between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. At the onset, there will be some sleet and freezing rain for northern Litchfield County. A winter weather advisory is in effect for parts of Connecticut. Higher elevations could have slick conditions and sheltered colder valleys. Mixed precipitation is expected. Total snow accumulations of up to 1 inch and ice accumulations of around 1/10 of an inch. Steady rain will fall by mid to late morning and through the day. Heavier downpours are likely between 4 p.m.- 7 p.m. This is when street flooding is more likely. The rain will wrap up during the evening and by 9 p.m. Runoff will continue into the rivers, streams and creeks. Minor flooding on the Housatonic River by Sunday. Coastal flooding is low at this time. Better chance of that happening early next week with the full moon. Winds will be gusty and closer to the shoreline we'll see 30-35 mph gusts. Windy into and through Sunday. FLOOD WATCH: There is a flood watch for the entire area from 7 a.m. Saturday until 2 a.m. Sunday. 2-3.5\" of rain will fall and create some street/urban flooding. Eventually minor flooding on some rivers. SATURDAY: Rain and wind with the storm offshore. Warmer. High of 52 (STORM WATCH) SUNDAY: Gradual clearing and breezy. High of 47. MONDAY: Mostly sunny. High of 50. TUESDAY: Partly sunny. High of 50. WEDNESDAY: Mostly cloudy with showers. High of 52. THURSDAY: Mostly cloudy with showers. High of 55. FRIDAY: Partly sunny. High of 59.",

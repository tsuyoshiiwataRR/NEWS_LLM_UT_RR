    "text": "Madison Streets Division will not be plowing in response to snowstorm MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - Madison Streets Division will not be plowing all Madison streets in response to Fridayâ€™s snowstorm. According to the city, a rapid response to the salt routes kept the main thoroughfares open. Crews began plowing [Thursday night](https://www.wmtv15news.com/2024/03/22/madison-streets-division-plows-continue-monitoring-salt-routes/) and continued through the day Friday while the storm was taking place. Melting is expected to continue throughout the day as the most intense part of the snowstorm has passed. The warmer weather and rising pavement temperatures will help improve conditions, including residential areas that were not plowed or salted. The city says drivers can expect the salt routes to be in good driving condition and note that untreated residential areas may still be slippery. Cold temperatures are expected Friday night and might cause patchy slick spots. The weekend could potentially bring another snow event overnight Saturday and last into Sunday. Streets Division crews will be monitoring the weather to see if plows will be needed again.

    "text": "The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning from noon Friday to 8 a.m. Sunday. Snow accumulation is forecast between 8 to 18 inches above 5,000 feet and 2 to 3 feet at the highest peaks. Wind gusts are also forecast up to 45 mph. Motorists should be prepared for chain controls, reduced visibility, additional travel times and delays. If motorists travel during the storm, Caltrans advises to pack extra supplies in the event of an emergency or if traffic is held for an extended period of time. Those supplies should include extra snacks, water, a blanket, and a flashlight. In the Sacramento Valley, rain amounts are forecast between 0.5 and 1 inch. The highest amounts are anticipated near Redding and into the foothills. Motorists should be prepared for slick travel conditions and longer than normal commute times. Updates to the forecast can be found on the National Weather Service website. Motorists are also encouraged to check Caltrans’ QuickMap before traveling for current road conditions and chain requirements or download the QuickMap app from the App Store or Google Play. Road information is also available on Caltrans’ website or by calling the California Highway Information Network automated phone service at 1-800-427-ROAD (7623). Caltrans District 3 is responsible for maintaining and operating 4,385 lane miles in 11 Sacramento Valley and Northern Sierra counties.

    "text": "Heavy snow expected most of Saturday, mixing south Foot of snow from the southern Adirondacks to central Vermont to the Northeast Kingdom Foot of snow from the southern Adirondacks to central Vermont to the Northeast Kingdom Foot of snow from the southern Adirondacks to central Vermont to the Northeast Kingdom A significant spring snowstorm — likely the largest of the season so far — is set to arrive in our region Friday night. A Winter Storm Watch is in effect for most of our viewing area ahead of the storm's arrival. Timing Friday itself remains largely dry, with sun in the morning and thickening clouds in the afternoon. High temperatures for the day will be around 30 degrees. However, late on Friday, heavy snow will start to move in from west to east, with snowy conditions lasting through most of the day on Saturday. Roads will likely be snow-packed and slippery through Saturday evening. Snowfall rates at times in central and northern Vermont could be anywhere between 1 to 2 inches per hour. Impacts The main impact will be heavy snow, but portions of southern Vermont will switch to rain or an icy mix at times on Saturday. This will lead to some wet snow loading on power lines and branches, potentially leading to scattered power outages. Wind is less of a concern with this storm system, but it will pick up a bit as the storm pulls away Saturday night. Gusts at times could be between 20-35 mph. Snowfall Totals The highest snowfall amounts will stretch from southern Essex County, New York all the way through central Vermont and the Northeast Kingdom, with a foot likely. Possibly more! For much of the Champlain Valley, 8-12\" is expected. There will be a sharp cut-off in totals in areas south of U.S. Route 4 as some mixing with sleet and rain will likely occur there. The weather team is continuing to monitor this storm and will have more updates as they are available. Follow the NBC5 First Warning Weather team on social media:",

    "text": "Snowfall has ended across the area! Looking back on some very high totals. The snow has ended across southeastern Wisconsin. Other than some flurries tonight, we don't expect any more accumulation. Milwaukee picked up 8\" of snow! Look at how crazy this winter has been! Milwaukee tallied 3.9\" from the middle of January to almost the end of March. Today changed all of that. Temperatures are expected to fall into the 20s, so a refreeze is likely. Use caution on driveways and secondary roads. Another system will approach the area on Sunday; however, other than a mix, the majority of the snow should stay across the western part of the state. Updated: 1 p.m. March 22, 2024 Snow is still coming down heavily for some southern spots. Meanwhile, others are starting to dry out.Milwaukee took a direct hit from this system with a snow total of 8\" as of 1pm. This is more than double the snow we've had since mid January and about a third as much as we've had all season long! That said, as snow ends for some the National Weather Service has canceled the Advisory for a handful of counties. Check it out: Even as the edge of the snow lines pulls away from Milwaukee, I'm still seeing light snow falling downtown. The counties in the Advisory can still expect snow over the next couple hours, but it should become lighter and more scattered in nature. Snow continues for many, but wrapping up to the north.Along and south of 43 cutting back through our southwest locations snow is still coming down at a good clip. Expect snow showers to continue for Walworth, Milwaukee, Racine and Konosha counties through mid afternoon before becoming light and winding down for the evening commute. The steady, heavy snow has wrapped up for a majority of southeast Wisconsin. We still have a few hometowns dealing with snow in two distinct areas. The first is light along and north of I-94. The second is heavier near the IL border and impacting southern Walworth and Kenosha Counties. Check out a current radar image that will update with time below: Additional snowfall the rest of the day looks fairly light with 1-3\" south of I-94 depending on if some heavier snow bands in northern Illinois drift north. North of I-94 probably sees less than an inch the rest of the day with scattered snow showers. Snow totals have been rolling in Friday morning. Highest totals have been in the I-94 corridor of Milwaukee, Waukesha and Jefferson Counties where 4-8\" of snow has been reported. Areas south and north of there have seen less.

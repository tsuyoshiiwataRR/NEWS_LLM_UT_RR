Before we get any further, let's talk about today. We'll be partly cloudy and windy on this Friday with highs in the low 30s. Winds could gust up to 30 mph out of the west. Mostly cloudy tonight. Low temperatures will fall into the upper teens as the winds back off. The snow moves in Saturday. It could be heavy at times. Some rain could mix in late with highs in the mid 30s. A wintry mix rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow will be possible Saturday night as lows fall into the low 20s. Total snow accumulations will vary greatly depending on the transition line and temperatures. If you're near Millinocket or further north, expect up to 1 foot or even 1.5 feet of snow. Further south, the numbers drop off. Areas from Lincoln to Bangor could see 7-10 inches of snow. The snowfall amounts quickly drop off as you get closer to the coast.

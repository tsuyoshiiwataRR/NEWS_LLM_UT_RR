Here is how much snowfall each area will when and when, according to [Meteorologist Ashlee Baracy](https://www.clickondetroit.com/weather/2024/03/22/accumulating-snow-in-metro-detroit-how-much-will-fall-on-friday/): - The Thumb to M-59: Snow will peak at two times, from 6 a.m.-10 a.m., and from 4 p.m.-10 p.m. Upward of 4 inches of accumulation is possible. - M-59 to I-94: Expect 1-3 inches of accumulation with two peak times, 6 a.m.-10 a.m., and again in the evening. - I-94 corridor and south: Snow will peak at two times, from 6 a.m.-10 a.m., and from 8 p.m.-midnight. 1-2 inches of snow are possible near I-94.

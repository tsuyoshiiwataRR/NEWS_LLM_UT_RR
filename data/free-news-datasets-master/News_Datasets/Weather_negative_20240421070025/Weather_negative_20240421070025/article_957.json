    "text": "The body of missing college student Riley Strain was recovered from the Cumberland River in Tennessee on Friday. Showers return Friday leading periods of heavy rain overnight. Leftover showers will taper off Saturday afternoon. SYLVA, N.C. (WLOS) â€” The Sylva Board of Commissioners voted to deny a parade permit for Sylva Pride on Thursday, March 21. During the morning meeting, commissioners expressed concerns about the logistics of the parade. Only one commissioner, Natalie Newman, voted against denying the permit application. They said they were worried about closing off roads, including Main Street, and that they are trying to push larger events to happen at Bridge Park instead. SYLVA TOWN COUNCIL NARROWLY APPROVES CONTROVERSIAL PANHANDLING ORDINANCE Sylva Pride has held its annual event for the last three years, which includes live music, drag shows and the parade down Main Street. Last year, the Town of Sylva had changed its permit requirements, that in order to close any streets within town limits, the event must be town-sponsored. The first two Sylva Pride events took place prior to the permitting rules change. On Friday, March 22, News 13 has reached out to Sylva Mayor Johnny Phillps for a comment on this decision, but he was unavailable. News 13 is speaking with Natalie Newman, the only commissioner who voted against denying the application, and a crew is working to get in touch with Sylva Pride to see what its plans are for the event moving forward. This story will be updated throughout the day with more details.",

    "text": "Strong winter storm on Saturday BANGOR, Maine (WABI) - A low pressure system continues its trek into the Northeast.

The foothills and the interstate area between Augusta and Bangor is in the 6-10″ range. The coast is in the 3-6″ range. Snow will transition to a mix south and east of the interstate mid to late Saturday afternoon. This will bring up to an inch of sleet for areas along and near the interstate from the Bangor area and south. A quarter inch of ice may accumulate as well with freezing rain. Coastal Downeast will see a changeover to heavy rain and could pick up 2-2.5″ of rain. The system will move out late Saturday night and high pressure will move in.

    "text": "Heavy snow expected Friday morning If you were waiting to believe it until you saw it, then you better believe it now! Steady snow is currently falling across all of southeast Wisconsin Friday morning. Most locations have already picked up an inch or two of snowfall. The heaviest snow is just starting to get organized. Check out a current radar image that will update with time below: There is no change to the winter weather advisory that was issued Thursday. That advisory is still in effect until Friday afternoon for the likelihood of over 3\" of snow for all of southeast Wisconsin. The high end of snow totals has come down a bit from Thursday and the axis of heavy snow has shifted farther south. It still looks likely that parts of southeast Wisconsin will see over 5\" of snowfall with this system and the best chance for that is from West Bend and Port Washington to Lake Geneva and Racine. Northern counties likely end up with a little less with 2-5\" in those areas. Even though a few inches of snow is likely for all of southeast Wisconsin, that snow will be a little slower to accumulate on the roads. Most of the main roads are pretty slushy right now. Even so, drive times are already very slow for the early morning commute and some of the DOT cameras are showing snow covered roads. You can see winter road conditions update with time here: Make sure to download the CBS 58 Ready Weather app to track the snowfall all day.",

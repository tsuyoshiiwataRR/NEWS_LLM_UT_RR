    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS — It's been anything but a white winter in the Twin Cities so far this season, but with the upcoming snow forecast for this weekend, some cities could declare snow emergencies. To spare you the cost of a ticket and a tow, we offer a reminder of what to do in the metro when your city declares a snow emergency.\n- Day 1: Don't park on either side of a snow emergency route until 8 a.m., or until the street is fully plowed.\n- Day 2: Don't park on the even numbered side of a non-snow emergency route until 8 p.m., or until that side of the street is fully plowed. Additionally, don't park on either side of a parkway until 8 p.m., or until the parkway is fully plowed.\n- Day 3: Don't park on the odd numbered side of a non-snow emergency route until 8 p.m., or until that side of the street is fully plowed.\n- Beginning at 9 p.m., all night plow routes will be plowed. Don't park on night plow routes, which include all of downtown and streets with signs reading \"NIGHT PLOW ROUTE\" or \"NIGHT PLOW ROUTE THIS SIDE OF STREET.\"\n- Beginning at 8 a.m., all day plow routes will be plowed. Don't park on these routes. They aren't marked by signs — if a street doesn't have any night plow signs and isn't downtown, the city said you should consider it a day plow route.\nSeveral other metro-area cities also have policies for snow emergencies. Click on each city below for more information:\nTo see if your city has declared a snow emergency, and to view school and business closings and delays,\n[click here.](/closings)\nFor the latest forecast, visit\n[KARE 11's weather page.](/weather/)\nTo see if winter weather is impacting traffic in your area,\n[click here](/traffic).\nWatch more\n[local news](/local):\nWatch the latest local news from the Twin Cities and across Minnesota in our\nYouTube playlist:\nWATCH MORE ON KARE 11+\n[Download the free KARE 11+ app](/article/about-us/kare-11-news-free-and-on-demand-on-roku-and-fire-tv/89-5efa72e4-8993-4449-8eb4-dea4a1d22873) for Roku, Fire TV, Apple TV and other smart TV platforms to watch more from KARE 11 anytime!

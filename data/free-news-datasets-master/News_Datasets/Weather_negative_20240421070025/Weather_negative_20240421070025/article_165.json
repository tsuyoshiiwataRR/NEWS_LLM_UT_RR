    "text": "Fisherman around the country have been badly affected and are facing a significant downturn as the persistent rain hampers their business.\nAvinnadra Amin Chand, a Tailevu fisherman, is grappling with poor catches because of ad[1]verse sea conditions, resulting in dwindling customers and income problems.\n“My family has been dependent on fishing for more than 10 years and right now it is not looking good for us,” Mr Chand said.\n“I was out at sea until yesterday and had a very small catch.”\nThe inclement weather has disrupted traditional fishing patterns, making it challenging for him to venture out to sea.\nWith fewer catches to offer, Mr Chand said there had been a sharp decline in sales, exacerbating their already precarious economic situation.\n“It’s already hard for me because I live in Nausori and have to travel all the way to Tailevu where I fish, and now this flood has prevented that.”\nMoreover, the lack of fresh fish has led to decreased foot traffic at local markets and seafood stalls, further impacting the livelihoods of fishermen and related businesses in the area.\n“Because of this weather, most of us are not out at sea, so some of the fish are not that fresh, which we then just keep in the freezer.”\nResidents and business owners are expressing concern about the prolonged rainy weather’s detrimental effects on the local economy, emphasising the urgent need for support and assistance to mitigate the financial losses incurred by fishermen in the Tailevu region.",

    "text": "FIRST ALERT: Snow tonight, major winter storm possible by late weekend We are tracking two winter storm systems that combined could very well double our current seasonal snowfall total, which stands at 9.4 inches. The first system will bring a couple of inches, perhaps a little more, to the Mankato area from late this evening into Friday morning. There is a winter weather advisory for counties north and east of the Mankato area where amounts will be slightly higher. The second system could very well be our most significant winter storm system so far this winter season. There is a high likelihood of a long-duration winter storm system, which could produce heavy snow, strong winds, rain, and even some ice. Snow will begin late Saturday night into Sunday morning with precipitation continuing through Monday night and possibly even through most of Tuesday. We have a lot to talk about. Here is a detailed breakdown of the two systems. TONIGHT / FRIDAY MORNING Timing: Snow will develop across far western Minnesota late Thursday afternoon and develop east and southeastward into Thursday evening. Snow is expected to reach the Mankato area by mid-Thursday evening, continuing through the night and ending around or shortly after daybreak on Friday. Snow will exit from northwest to southeast Friday morning. A second band of snow is likely along and south of I-90 late tonight. This band will start as rain but change to snow as temperatures drop overnight. Snowfall amounts here will depend on when the rain changes to snow. Amounts: In the Mankato area, snowfall amounts will be around 2 inches, with some locations getting up to three inches. Amounts will gradually be higher north and east of Mankato with lesser amounts to the west and south. The exception to the south will be locations along and south of I-90 where an enhanced area of precipitation will develop late tonight. Precipitation will begin as rain but is expected to change to snow. Snow amounts will depend on when that change happens. If it happens earlier, snow amounts will be higher. Snow forecast as of 2pm Wednesday 3/20/2024: Here are the latest Watches, Warnings and Advisories: LATE SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY The second system we are tracking is much more significant and will likely be the most impactful winter storm we’ve had so far this winter season. Based on our latest long-range forecast model data, a 6+ inch snowfall event is looking more and more likely. It’s still early, making it too soon to pinpoint where the heaviest snow will fall. However, current estimates suggest a “low end” range of 3 to 6 inches and a “high end” range of 8 to 12 inches. We will probably end up somewhere in between, but this could all change based on where the system develops, where it ends up tracking, and how much precipitation falls as snow versus rain. Those are all things that we won’t be able to narrow down for another couple of days. In regard to timing, snow could potentially start as early as Saturday evening with the potential for heavy snow Sunday and Sunday night. During that time, it will also be very windy with easterly gusts of 40+ mph. Warmer air will wrap into the system Sunday night into Monday, at which point snow will change to rain. Rain will be likely through much of Monday, with rain changing back to snow with colder air on the backside of the system Monday night through Tuesday. Keep in mind, all of this is very preliminary as we are still several days away from the onset of this system. That said, if you have travel plans from late Saturday through early next week, check the weather and check it often because it is looking more and more likely that you will have to make some changes.

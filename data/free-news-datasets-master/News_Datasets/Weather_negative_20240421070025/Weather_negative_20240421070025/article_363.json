    "text": "DOHA: In its latest forecast, the Department of Meteorology has issued a cautionary advisory concerning the weather conditions expected on Friday. According to the department's daily report, there will be scattered clouds to partly cloudy skies inland, with a possibility of rain, potentially accompanied by thunderstorms in certain areas. Residents are advised to be prepared for thundery rain, which is expected to coincide with strong winds.\nOffshore, similar weather patterns are anticipated, with scattered clouds to partly cloudy conditions during the day. However, the report warns that rain is likely to become thundery by nightfall, with strong winds and high seas expected. Mariners are urged to exercise caution, as the combination of thundery rain, strong winds, and high seas could pose risks to navigation.\nWind speeds inland are forecasted to range from northwesterly to northwesterly, blowing at speeds of 08 to 18 knots, with gusts reaching up to 30 knots during thundery rain showers. Offshore, wind conditions are expected to mirror those inland, with similar speeds and gusts anticipated.\nVisibility both inland and offshore is predicted to be reduced during thundery rain showers, with visibility ranging from 4 to 8 kilometers, and potentially dropping to 3 kilometers or less inland, and 2 kilometers or less offshore.\nRegarding sea conditions, inland areas can expect sea states ranging from 1 to 3 feet, surging to 5 feet during thundery rain showers. Offshore, sea states are forecasted to be more turbulent, with heights ranging from 3 to 5 feet, and surging up to 10 feet during thundery rain.\nResidents and maritime interests are advised to stay updated on the latest weather forecasts and heed any official warnings or advisories issued by the authorities to ensure their safety and well-being amidst the anticipated adverse weather conditions.\n Copy 22/03/2024 70",

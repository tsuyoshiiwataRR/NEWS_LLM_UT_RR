Tractor-trailers skidded off Interstate 95 in Bangor and state Route 201 in The Forks. There were no reported injuries.\nAbout 3-5 inches of snow is expected in southern Maine on Saturday before a changeover to sleet and rain by afternoon. Western interior areas and parts of northern Maine could get up to 10 inches of snow.\nThose living close to the coast may get heavy rains on Saturday, according to the National Weather Service.\n“A low pressure system arrives in New England on Saturday, bringing heavy snow, wintry mix and rain to the region,” according to the National Weather Service in Gray forecast. “Significant snowfall is possible across interior Maine.”\nBy Sunday – Maine Maple Sunday – the storm will clear out, and temperatures should be in the low- to mid-40s with cloudy and partly-sunny skies to start next week.\nMost of Kennebec County received a couple of inches of snow Thursday, with the largest accumulation – 5 inches – recorded just southwest of Waterville.\nIn Somerset County, the weather service recorded 6.3 inches of snow in Cornville, 8 inches just outside of Harmony and 11 inches in Solon.",

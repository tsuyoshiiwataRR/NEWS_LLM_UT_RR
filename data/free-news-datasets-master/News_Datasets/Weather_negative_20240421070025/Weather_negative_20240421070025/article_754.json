    "text": "Toronto is being hit by a spring snowstorm that’s expected to drop as much as 15 centimetres of snow on some parts of the city by Friday night.\nThe snow has already started to fall and the city is under an active snowfall warning .\nHere’s what happening right now:\n12:30 P.M. Toronto delivers update on snow response The city said crews started salting major arterial roads and collector routes at 11:30 a.m. to prevent freezing and frost before the afternoon commute. Local roads are set to be salted between 2 and 3 p.m.\nVincent Sferrazza, director of operations and maintenance of Toronto’s transportation services, said crews are hoping to get at least two rounds of salting done by the time heavier snow starts to fall after 3 p.m.\nSferrazza said the city has been tracking the weather event and crews proactively salted the roads on Wednesday, which he said gave the city a “good head start” in its snow-clearing operations.\nWhen the snow does start to accumulate, the city will start plowing major roads and transit routes at 5 cm and residential streets at 8 cm.\n“So we ask residents to please be patient and allow us to get those rounds of salting and plowing in and hopefully that would resolve any issues that may have arisen,” he said.\n11 A.M. Pearson says 'give yourself some extra time' The snow is falling at Toronto Pearson International Airport and officials are advising travellers to give themselves extra time to avoid missing their flight.\nCustomers are encouraged to check the airport’s departures portal for any changes to the status of their flight.\nThe snow is starting to fall at the airport. We're joined by our airport duty manager, Michael Tomas, for an update on our operations. pic.twitter.com/fUWyvlExaa\n— Toronto Pearson (@TorontoPearson) March 22, 2024 This is a developing story. More to come.\nRelated Stories Snowfall warning issued for Greater Toronto Area and parts of Ontario Photos",

    "text": "A new and worsening weather warning has just been issued for Pickering, Oshawa, Ajax and Whitby. Environment Canada has just put southern Durham under a Snowfall Warning for Friday morning and evening (March 22), with “significant snowfall” expected today and tonight. This replaces the [Special Weather Statement](https://www.durhamregion.com/news/environment-canada-issues-weather-warning-for-ajax-and-pickering-as-well-as-oshawa-whitby-and/article_a59d0dd5-9370-5ef5-a537-cb721f88ec66.html) that was in effect for Durham region. Hazards in Pickering, Oshawa and southern Durham include snowfall amounts near 15 centimetres, peak snowfall rates of two centimetres per hour possible and “reduced visibility” in heavy snow, [the national weather agency said in its warning.](https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?onrm11=) “Light snow is expected to begin this morning, but should intensify late in the afternoon or evening. The snow will taper off from west to east late tonight,” the warning for south Durham residents states. “This snow may have a significant impact on the evening commute in urban areas.” Environment Canada is also warning south Durham residents that “visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow” and surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. “Be prepared to adjust your driving with changing road conditions,” the warning states. “If visibility is reduced while driving, turn on your lights and maintain a safe following distance.” This weather warning comes as [The Weather Network’s spring forecast is calling for a mild spring](https://www.durhamregion.com/news/good-and-bad-news-the-weather-network-releases-2024-spring-forecast-for-ontario-and-heres/article_2a279f97-0d69-57c1-9a7a-eda9c7fe4373.html) in Durham and the rest of Ontario that “will be moody at times” with periods of colder-than-normal temperatures and a risk for significant late-winter-like weather, “which will test our patience as we wait for more consistent warm weather,” according to Doug Gillham (PhD), a senior meteorologist at the network and manager for the Forecast Centre. You might be interested in The mild winter and early spring means that spring vegetation, flowers and so on should come out ahead of schedule. “Unfortunately, though, a warm spring does not eliminate the risk of late-season shots of cold weather. Therefore, we have a significant risk for a late-season frost or freeze after the start of the growing season,” Gillham said.",

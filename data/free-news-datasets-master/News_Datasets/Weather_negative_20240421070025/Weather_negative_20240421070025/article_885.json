Trump, who won the last edition of the tournament ‚Äì held in 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic, overcame Kyren Wilson 5-2 on Friday in Yushan. With the quarter-final level at 2-2, the world number two clinched frame five on the black after benefiting from a couple of flukes before completing the job thanks to half-century breaks of 59 and 63. \"Grumpy old man\" [@juddtrump]will face Jackson Page in the last four of the World Open in Yushan!

World number 52 Page, who eliminated former world champions John Higgins and Mark Selby en route to the last eight, made a break of 140 during his 5-2 success over Elliot Slessor. ‚ÄúI think Jackson has played brilliantly well, he‚Äôs scored heavily,‚Äù said Trump. ‚ÄúFrom what I‚Äôve seen, him and Ding have been the players of the tournament.

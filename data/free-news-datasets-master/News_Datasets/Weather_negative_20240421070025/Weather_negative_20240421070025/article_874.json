    "text": "Soggy Start to Weekend Sunshine surges back into the Carolinas on Sunday, but temperatures will likely end up below average. Our time in the sun has come to an end – literally. Clouds and showers are rolling across the Carolinas this Friday evening, and it’s only going to get nastier from here. Expect widespread rain, heavy at times, overnight, totalling anywhere between 1-2″. The majority of the moisture will lift to the northeast shortly before noon on Saturday, but a few showers may linger into the afternoon. Most communities will be completely clear of clouds and rain by sunset. Highs will struggle to get out of the 40s and 50s through the early afternoon, but if clearing arrives earlier, the Metro and southward may quickly warm into the 60s. Much colder air filters in behind this rainmaking system, leaving many with frost and freeze as we wake up on Sunday. Abundant sunshine will allow temperatures to quickly recover into the lower 60s across the Piedmont and Foothills, but gusty winds from the northwest will make it difficult to get any warmer. Continued allow highs to run into the mid-60s on Monday before clouds return to the forecast by Tuesday afternoon. Medium-range models are trending towards a wet midweek. Tonight: Rain, heavy at times. Low: 57°. Wind: E 5-15. Gusts: 20+ Saturday: Scattered showers, especially before noon. PM clearing. High: 62°. Wind: N 10-20. Gusts: 25+ Saturday Night: Mostly clear and cold. Frost likely. Low: 36°. Wind: N 10-20. Gusts: 25+ Sunday: Sunny and breezy. High: 62°. Wind: NW 10-20. Gusts: NE 10-20. Gusts: 25+",

The rain comes courtesy of a developing area of low pressure that will track along the northern Gulf coast Friday. This system will throw waves of rain, heavy at times, into SWFL starting this morning and lasting through the afternoon, the evening, the overnight and right on through much of our Saturday. Rain totals in the 1\"- 3\" range will be common by the time the rain ends Saturday, though locally higher amounts up to and over 5\" will be possible, leading to the potential for flooding.

Winds will be strong even outside of any thunderstorms, sustained at 15-25 mph Friday evening into Saturday morning, gusting over 30mph at times. The rain, clouds and winds will keep temperatures will below average today as well with highs holding in the middle and lower 70s. A Flood Watch will be in effect for Collier County from 8 a.m. Friday morning until 8 p.m. Saturday. Avoid traveling through flooded roadways.

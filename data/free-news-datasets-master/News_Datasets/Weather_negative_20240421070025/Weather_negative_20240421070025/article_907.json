    "text": "Cedar Rapids Police: 67 vehicle accidents due to weather CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (KCRG) - With wintry weather hitting Cedar Rapids, police have released vehicle accident reports related to this morning’s weather. Officials say 67 vehicle accidents and 33 vehicle hazards (stuck, disabled, or immobilized) occurred this morning directly relating to the weather. Cedar Rapids Fire was called out to two of those accidents to assist with injuries. Neither was reportedly serious. The City of Cedar Rapids officially ended their ‘snow event’ at 4:00 pm, meaning property owners now have 24 hours to clear snow and ice from their sidewalks. In order to keep people safe, officials have released the following tips for safe driving in wintry conditions: - Do not follow plows too closely. During their operation, they occasionally have to stop and back up. - Reduce your speeds. - Use caution in turns. - Avoid sudden moves. - Accelerate and brake carefully and slowly. - Leave more room between vehicles. - Increase your braking distance.

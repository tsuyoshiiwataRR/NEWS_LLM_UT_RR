    "text": "“Near white out” conditions caused a three-vehicle crash that ended with a semi truck plowing through the side of a house earlier this week.\nThe accident happened in Brighton, New York just after 7 p.m. on Wednesday evening, March 20th.\nAccording to\nRochester First, a car was traveling along Interstate 390 when it spun out and hit a tractor trailer. The force of the impact sent the tractor trailer off of the interstate, through a telephone pole, and into the front door of a house on South Clinton Avenue near Brighton-Henrietta Town Line Road.\nTwo people were inside of the house at the time of the accident. One of those occupants was taken to the hospital with non life threatening injuries. The truck driver was also transported to a hospital with non life threatening injuries. No other injuries were reported.\nA third vehicle involved in the crash also spun off of the interstate during the “near white out” conditions, but was able to stop before causing any damage, reported\nDemocrat and Chronicle.\nThe incident damaged rooms on both floors of the house, and the home “may be a total loss.”",

    "text": "Messy commute conditions are expected across southern Ontario thanks to a low pressure system possibly bringing the biggest snowfall of the season for Toronto. Messy conditions are going to continue as we head towards the evening commute across the Golden Horseshoe thanks to some banding that we have which is going to be the dark blue. So expect low visibility on the roads and very quick accumulation of snow as we head towards that supper period or past that supper period. That’s what we’re going to be looking at. More enhancements picking up across regions of the western end of the GTA and down towards Niagara. That’s what’s going to increase a lot of the snowfall accumulation as we go through the evening into the early parts on Saturday. In terms of snowfall totals right around the Golden Horseshoe, that’s where we can be looking at 5 to 10 centimeters of snow. However, thanks to that banding, we may see a little bit of additional snowfall, even getting closer to 12 to 15 centimeters, however, the further West we had away from. Lake Ontario. That’s where we can see it. More of that accumulation, close to 5 to 10 centimeters.",

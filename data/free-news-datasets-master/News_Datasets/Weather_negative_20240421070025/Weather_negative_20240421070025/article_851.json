    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY (KUTV) â€” Say goodbye to the sunshine and 60s! The first in a series of storms will move through Utah over the weekend. This storm will issue in an unsettled, cool pattern for next week. Here's what you can expect each day. Increasing clouds with a few isolated sprinkles are expected in the late afternoon and evening across northern Utah and southwestern Wyoming. Temperatures will still warm with highs in the mid-60s in northern Utah and mid-70s down south. Mostly cloudy skies in the morning with winds picking up. By afternoon, winds are expected to be in the 15-25 mph range with gusts as high as 40 mph. Even stronger gusts will be possible in west central and southwestern Utah, and a High Wind Watch is in place there as a result. A few isolated light showers may move through northern Utah tomorrow morning, but most of the valley rain and mountain snow will hold off until the afternoon and evening. A few thunderstorms will even be possible during that timeframe as the cold front slides through western Utah. By late evening, a few snowflakes may mix in with rain. Little to no accumulation is expected along the valley floors, but the mountains could pick up 5-10\" through Saturday night. Scattered rain and snow showers will continue on-and-off through the day. Little to no accumulation is expected in the valleys from these showers. If any snow does accumulate, it will just be on non-paved surfaces. In the mountains, another 5-10\" of snow could fall during the day Sunday. Temperatures will be much cooler Sunday with highs near 50 in northern Utah and in the upper 50s down south. A few rain and snow showers will continue into Monday in northern Utah as another little disturbance clips the state. Southern Utah will stay dry. Temperatures will be well below normal for late March with highs near 50 in northern Utah and around 60 down south. The active pattern continues with another small disturbance clipping the state. This will, once again, produce a few scattered showers in northern Utah. These showers will likely produce both rain and snow, depending on the intensity of the showers. Temperatures will once again be near 50 in northern Utah and mid-60s down south. We'll get a break from the unsettled weather on Wednesday. Skies will still be a little cloudy and winds will be gusty, but it will be the driest day of the week across the state. Temperatures will get back into the 50s in northern Utah. Southern Utah will top out in the upper 60s. Yet another storm will move through the region. This storm looks mild, but pretty powerful. The valleys will get a mixture of rain and snow showers as the system is moving through the region. Southern Utah may get a few showers from this system as well. While the valleys are getting rain or a rain/snow mix, the mountains should be able to pick up some high snow totals! We will be in between storms on March 22, but another storm has its sights set on Salt Lake City for next weekend. This system will produce both rain and snow As you can see, the meteorologists in the 2News Weather Center will be busy all week long! Stay turned to the 2News Weather Team as we bring you updates on this active pattern through the weekend and into next week.",

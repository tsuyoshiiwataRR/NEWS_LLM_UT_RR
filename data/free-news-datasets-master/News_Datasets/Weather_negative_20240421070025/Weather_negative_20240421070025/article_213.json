    "text": "Merewalesi Nalase, a villager from Rewa, is grappling with the repercussions of the inclement weather as her livelihood hangs in the balance.\nThe incessant rains have disrupted her ability to sell produce, particularly shrimp, severely impacting her family’s sustenance and survival.\n“My family relies on what I sell here at the market for our survival, and right now the weather has not helped us much,” she said.\n“I usually wake up early with my husband to go collect whatever we get from our fishing net, but these past few days it has really been empty.”\nFacing a decline in catch, she is confronted with the daunting challenge of securing adequate income and provisions for her household.\nTheir reliance on shrimp sales for sustenance exacerbates the strain imposed by the adverse weather conditions.\n“I sell shrimps most of the time because I have customers that are here regularly, but now they have not been coming because my supply is not meeting their demand.”\nAs the rain persists, Ms Nalase remains determined to navigate through this challenging period, seeking alternative avenues to sustain her family.\nYet, the uncertainty looms large, casting a shadow over the livelihoods of many like her in the village.\n“I have a family to feed, so I will have to resort to other produce I can sell so my family can survive,” she says.",

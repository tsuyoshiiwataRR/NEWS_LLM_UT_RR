    "text": "THURSDAY, APRIL 18, 2024 THIS EVENING: Partly Cloudy Temperatures : 70s to 60s Winds : Northeast 5-10 mph Clouds will stick around this evening as temperatures fall through the 70s and 60s. TONIGHT: Increasing Clouds Lows: 45-52 Winds: East 5-10 mph Dry weather is expected overnight, but clouds will increase. It will also be cooler overnight with many neighborhoods dipping into the 40s. FRIDAY: Mostly Cloudy, Showers Lows: 65-70 Winds: Southeast 5-10 mph We'll round out the week with clouds and cooler afternoon highs in the upper 60s (seasonable for mid-April). There's a slight chance for a few, passing showers throughout the day, as a cold front approaches, but there is not a lot of moisture associated with this weather-maker. Those who get rain will only see a few hundredths of a inch. SATURDAY: Partly Cloudy, Breezy Highs: 68-73 Winds: Northwest 10-15 mph, Gusts 20 to 30 mph Saturday, Earth Day, will be the warmer weekend day with highs around 70 degrees. It will be a breezy day with low humidity and a mix of sun and clouds for any of your outdoor plans. SUNDAY: Partly Cloudy Highs: 58-63 Winds: Northwest 5-10 mph Cooler than average temperatures will round out the weekend. Sunday morning will start off in the 40s, so it will be a noticeably cooler/colder to start the day. Afternoon highs will only reach the low 60s, which is below average. Sunday will be the first time in a week and a half with below average temperatures, so make sure to have a light jacket for your Sunday plans, especially in the morning.

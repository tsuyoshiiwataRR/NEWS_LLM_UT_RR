    "text": "Colorado weather: Warm spring temps will turn into weekend snowstorm Published in [News & Features](/currentnews/newsheadlines/) Will Sunday bring about a repeat of last Thursday’s snowstorm? It’s too soon to say, but winter weather is once again on the way to Colorado. Although warm weather will continue in the Denver area Friday — with high temperatures hovering in the mid- to high-60s — snow will already be starting in the mountains Friday night, according to a Hazardous Weather Outlook from the National Weather Service. Scattered, light snow showers will start over the high mountains around midnight Friday, and the bulk of the storm will move in late Saturday and stick around through Sunday night, the outlook stated. While meteorologists aren’t sure exactly how much snow will accumulate yet, they expect a significant amount to impact the mountains, foothills and Palmer Divide Sunday night into Monday morning, according to NWS meteorologists. The weather headed for the metro area will start as rain Sunday — possibly including thunderstorms in the afternoon — that turns to snow around 8 p.m., NWS forecasters said. Overnight lows for Denver will dip back below freezing from Sunday through Tuesday next week as the cold front moves through the state. Areas in the mountains, like Loveland Pass, will see below-freezing weather Friday night as the snow moves in and an average low temperature of 12 degrees through Wednesday. The mountains won’t see much warmer weather in the daytime though, with an average high temperature of 35 degrees through Wednesday, according to NWS. Although the southeastern plains will start Sunday off with warm, windy conditions and on a Fire Weather Watch, rain and snow will move into the plains that night, NWS forecasters said. Little snow is expected to accumulate over the plains. _",

    "text": "Sudden snowfall causes road disruptions in Mid-Michigan LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - State troopers in Mid-Michigan responded to 55 crashes on Friday after springlike weather turned into a blanket of winter snow overnight. “It’s March, and I think we should have sunshine. It should be at least 60. I’m trying to go golfing so I hope this clears up soon,” said East Lansing resident Legend Hauk. While road conditions may be inconveniencing for some, others are making the most of it. “You know, it’s been fun. I didn’t have to work today and the kids didn’t have to go to school, so we figured we’d come out and try to find somewhere to go sledding because it’s probably our last chance for the spring,” said Williamston resident Mark Dubay. He said with four-wheel drive and taking it slow, the roads weren’t too bad.

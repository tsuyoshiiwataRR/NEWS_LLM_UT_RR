    "text": "Nelliyampathy, often known as the 'Poor Man's Ooty' for its cool climate, is experiencing a significant decline in tourist footfall due to scorching temperatures. With a recorded high of 34 degrees celsius on Wednesday, it marked the peak of this year's heatwave. Nelliyampathy, which generally has cooler nights, has seen a rise in temperature during the nights this season. The months of November and December, which usually show a temperature of 10-12 degrees celsius, now jumped to 14-16 degrees. Currently Nelliyampathyâ€™s daily temperature at night is 19 degree celsius. It is pointed out that, the shedding of leaves of the trees in the forest regions which causes the rocks and soil getting hot under the scorching son, is another reason for the nights getting hotter. Wild animals like elephants are also moving out of their habitat due to the dried up streams and waterfalls. They are reaching out to check dams and Karappara river near farm areas to drink water. Farmers and other land owners have started complaining that the changed climate has already affected the crops. Since the days have become hotter, many farm owners have started irrigating their farms. Resorts and hotels in that area have also started installing fans due to the heat. Their business too have got affected as there is a significant decline in the number of tourists visiting Nelliyampathy this season.",

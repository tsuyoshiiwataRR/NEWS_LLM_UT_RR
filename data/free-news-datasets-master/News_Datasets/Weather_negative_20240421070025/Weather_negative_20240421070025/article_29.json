    "text": "Another FIRST ALERT SATURDAY, Mother Nature Strikes Again BANGOR, Maine (WABI) - Low pressure has now moved into New Brunswick and will continue to bring wrap around snow showers across far northern Maine for the first half of the night. Any additional snowfall will be less than 2″. Winds overnight will continue to be out of the WNW and will gust 40-45 mph. This will produce areas of blowing snow, especially over the Crown on Maine. Lows will drop into the single digits and teens and will FEEL like they are in the single digits & teens above and below zero. High pressure will be building in from the west. This is running into the back of the exiting low and is what will continue to produce a tight pressure gradient and a breezy tonight into Friday. WNW winds on Friday will be slightly lighter than today but still some gusts up to 35 mph will be possible. Expect mostly sunny skies with highs in the 20s and 30s. Again, will FEEL colder due to the wind. The high will move out during the early evening Friday and will be watching the potential for another storm on Saturday. A FIRST ALERT WEATHER DAY has been issued for Saturday for both Inland & Coastal communities. Heavy wet snow is expected for parts of the region with significant accumulations in the north & mountains. There is a lot of uncertainty as to how Saturday’s storm system will be tracking. Energy moving out of the Plains will merge with an area of low pressure tracking up the east coast. The center of the low will track off the coast and will keep most of us in the cold sector of the storm initially. This means we will all start off as snow into early Saturday morning, but locations along the coast will change to rain at some point during the day. Things that will still need to be determined are how close to the coast does the low track, how quickly some locations change from snow to rain, and how far inland the snow/rain line makes it. If the low tracks farther to our SSE, then a colder solution would prevail. This would mean snow for all. The highest snowfall totals would also be shifted closer to the coast. If the low tracks closer to the coast, then lower snowfall totals would be expected along the coast with higher totals in the mountains. Timing of the changeover will also be key. If the change from snow to rain happens earlier, then lower snowfall totals would be possible. If the change takes longer, higher snowfall totals. If our SSE winds are slightly stronger then this would help to push warmer air farther inland and would impact where the snow/rain line positions itself. This would potentially lower snowfall totals inland. Here are my thoughts. This storm looks to be our most significant storm so far. The center of the low will track through the Gulf of Maine starting early Saturday morning. Everyone will start off as snow with locations from the Interstate to the coast changing over to rain by midafternoon. The rain will potentially wash away all snow accumulations along the coast. Heavy wet snow will continue to fall north & west of the Interstate for the duration of the event. As the center of the low moves to our east by Saturday evening, colder air will be drawn in on the backside so as the last push of precipitation moves through, locations that will see rain will briefly change back to snow before ending. Any precipitation should clear out before sunrise Sunday. This storm has the potential to have major impacts for locations in the mountains & north. Snowfall totals for these locations could range from 12-18″! There will be a sharp drop off in totals from the foothills towards the coast and this is where the greatest uncertainty is. This is where the rain/snow line will be setting up. Locations from Rumford to Millinocket & Houlton southwards should expect 8-12″. From Lewiston to Waterville to Greenbush to Topsfield and southwards, totals from 4-8″ are likely. Then along the immediate coast, 1-4″ most of which will get washed away by rain. Sunday will be the better of the weekend days as it will be brighter and dry. Highs will still be in the 30s and a WNW breeze up to 30 mph is expected. This could produce some blowing snow. Still forecasting a warmup by the middle part of next week as highs should return to the 40s and low 50s. This means any snow we pick up through the next several days should melt away quickly. Watching the chance for rain by Wednesday & Thursday. TONIGHT: Skies gradually clearing. WNW winds will continue to gust 40-45 mph. Lows in the teens and will FEEL colder due to the wind. FRIDAY: Mostly sunny with highs in the 20s & 30s. Breezy WNW wind gusting up to 35 mph. Will FEEL colder. SATURDAY: FIRST ALERT. Snow to start before changing to rain along the coast. Significant heavy wet snow expected in the mountains. Highs in the 20s & 30s. SE wind 15-25 mph. SUNDAY: Partly cloudy. Highs in the 30s. WNW gusts to 30 mph. MONDAY: Mostly sunny with highs in the 30s. TUESDAY: Mix of sun & clouds with highs in the 30s and low 40s. WEDNESDAY: Cloudy with the chance of rain. Highs in the 30s and 40s. Copyright 2024 WABI.

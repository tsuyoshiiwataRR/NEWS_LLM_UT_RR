    "text": "The coming days are set to be a washout with heavy showers, hail and thunder before a major U-turn.\nMet Éireann has said the weekend will be unsettled and rather cool for the time of year, as a mix of sunshine and showers start off the days before bands of rain sweep across the country bringing heavy rain as well as hail, thunder and even spot flooding.\nAs well as rain, temperatures are set to drop on Friday and some wintry falls are possible and a touch of frost is likely in some sheltered spots while the mercury dips to between 1C and 4C. Some wintry falls are also possible on Saturday night.\nAlthough Sunday will start out dry, rain will extend nationwide in the evening with heavy falls pouring down on the country. Monday will be quite the same, some heavy falls are possible with the chance of some spot flooding.\nThankfully, Tuesday mostly signals the end of the wet few days and is expected to bring a good deal of dry weather but there will be some showers.\nHowever, Alan O’Reilly from Carlow Weather has warned that rainfall amounts could vary between forecasts for next week. He wrote: “Low pressure in control next week but positions of low systems vary on the two models. This means rainfall amounts will vary a lot across forecasts and apps etc.”\nHere is Met Éireann’s forecast for the weekend:\nFriday Fresh and increasingly breezy today with a mix of sunshine and showers. Showers will mainly affect western and northern areas at first, but will spread across the country during the day on a strong westerly breeze.\nSome of the showers will be heavy with hail and the slight chance of lightning. Later in the day, showers may turn wintry on high ground. Highest temperatures of 7C to 10C.\nCold and windy on Friday night with a mix of clear spells and showers, some of the showers will be heavy and prolonged with hail and thunder possible.\nSome wintry falls are possible, mainly over the hills. Lowest temperatures of 1C to 4C in fresh to strong westerly winds. A touch of frost is likely in some sheltered spots.\nSaturday Saturday will be a fairly windy day with a mix of sunny spells and showers with the continued chance of hail and thunder. Some wintry falls are possible in the morning on high ground. Highest temperatures of 7C to 10C, but feeling colder in a fresh to strong northwest breeze.\nCold and breezy on Saturday night with clear spells and scattered showers. Lowest temperatures of 2C to 5C with fresh and gusty northwest winds, moderating later in the night.\nSunday Sunday will start out dry in most areas with just the odd shower. However, rain will develop in the southwest during the morning, spreading across Connacht, Munster and south Leinster by afternoon.\nRain will then extend nationwide in the evening. Highest afternoon temperatures of 8C to 11C with mostly light and variable breezes at first but a freshening southerly breeze will develop later on.\nWidespread outbreaks of rain on Sunday night with some heavy falls. Lowest temperatures of 5C to 9C with moderate to fresh south or southeast winds.\nIt will be a cloudy and wet weekend\nMonday It looks set to be a cloudy and wet day on Monday with outbreaks of rain. Some heavy falls are possible with the chance of some spot flooding.\nMaximum temperatures of 8C to 11C in moderate southeast or variable winds. Rain is expected to ease on Monday night with good dry and clear spells developing. Lowest temperatures of 3C to 6C in a moderate northeast breeze.\nTuesday Tuesday is expected to bring a good deal of dry weather overall but there will be some showers, especially over the northern half of the country.\nThe best of the sunshine is likely in southern and southeastern counties. Maximum temperatures generally ranging from 10C to 13C but a little cooler in the northeast with a moderate northeast breeze.\nLargely dry on Tuesday night with clear spells. Lowest temperatures of 3C to 7C in moderate southeast winds.\nJoin the Irish Mirror’s breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

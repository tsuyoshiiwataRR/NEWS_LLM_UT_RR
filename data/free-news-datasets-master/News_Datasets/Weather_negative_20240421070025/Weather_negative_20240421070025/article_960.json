    "text": "IMPACT: System brings heavy rain and blustery winds for Saturday Rain chances are on the rise tonight as our next system moves in. T.J. Springer has how much rain to expect and when the sunshine returns. Rain chances are on the rise tonight as our next system moves in. T.J. Springer has how much rain to expect and when the sunshine returns. Rain chances are on the rise tonight as our next system moves in. T.J. Springer has how much rain to expect and when the sunshine returns. Clouds have thickened up across the Valley ahead of our next storm system. As these areas of low pressure move in overnight, showers develop, becoming steadier. With the clouds and wind flow, temps won't drop much tonight. Lows dip back into the lower to middle 40s which is above normal for this time of year. The rain picks up in intensity early Saturday with rainfall rates possibly around 0.25-0.50\" per hour. This could lead to some minor flooding, especially in low-lying, flood prone areas. A Flood Watch has been issued from late tonight through Saturday evening for a good chunk of the Valley. Rain starts to taper off between 5-7 PM or so as this area of low pressure lifts to the northeast. The wind then becomes the headline with gusts around 40 mph. The rain and the wind have made Saturday an IMPACT DAY so be sure to stay weather aware. The wind lightens up on Sunday but it'll still be breezy as high pressure builds. Gusts early in the AM could rise near 30 mph. The plus is sunshine returns! If you have any Easter Egg hunts planned, those should go off without a hitch. High pressure remains in control into early next week with plenty of sun on Monday. Highs rebound nicely, topping out in the middle and upper 50s. The pattern turns unsettled once again though with shower chances rising Wednesday into Thursday. A system moving in from the west along with a coastal low lifting north provide the shot at moisture. Chances are looking higher on Wednesday than Thursday but it's something we'll be watching. Beyond that, Easter Weekend is looking drier. A weak clipper system could make for a few showers on Saturday but chances aren't looking great at the moment. High pressure looks to return just in time for Easter with afternoon readings back near 60 along with more sunshine. Have a great night! -T.J.",

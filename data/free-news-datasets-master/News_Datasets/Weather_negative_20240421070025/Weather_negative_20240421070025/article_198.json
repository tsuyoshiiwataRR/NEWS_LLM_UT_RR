    "text": "The National Weather Service Guam Weather Forecast Office on Friday advised gusty winds and dry conditions will cause a high fire threat. A fire weather watch remains in effect through Sunday afternoon for Guam. East winds of 20 to 30 mph, with gusts to 40 mph possible, and humidity at 50 to 60% during the day are expected. Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly. Outdoor burning is not recommended, NWS said. A high surf advisory is in effect for Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan from 6 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Monday along north and east facing reefs. Large breaking waves of 8 to 11 feet are expected. Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions. A high risk of rip currents is in effect for Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan from Friday evening through late Sunday night. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water. If caught in a rip current, do not swim against the current. Swim in a direction following the shoreline, face the shore and call or wave for help. A small craft advisory is in effect for the coastal waters of Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan from 6 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Monday. Northeast winds of 20 to 25 knots, with gusts to 30 knots, and seas of 10 to 13 feet are expected. Conditions will be hazardous to small craft. Inexperienced mariners, especially those operating smaller vessels, should avoid boating in hazardous conditions. The Offices of Guam Homeland Security and Civil Defense remind the community to avoid hazardous surf and seas. Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water while the advisories are in effect. \"Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags, and signs. Refrain from outdoor burning,\" the agencies said.",

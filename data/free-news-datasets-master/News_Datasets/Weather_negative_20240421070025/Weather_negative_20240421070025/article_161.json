    "text": "22 Mar 2024 | 02:01 AM UTC Canada: Adverse winter weather forecast across parts of far eastern Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador provinces through at least early March 23 Adverse winter weather forecast across far eastern Canada through at least early March 23. Hazardous travel conditions likely. Adverse winter weather is forecast over parts of far eastern Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador provinces through at least early March 23. As of late March 21, Environment Canada has issued the following warnings: Red snowfall warnings (the highest level on a three-tier scale): Upper Lake Melville. Snowfall of 15-20 cm (6-8 inches) is forecast through the afternoon of March 22. Red winter storm warnings: Makkovik to Hopedale through March 22 and the west coast of Newfoundland from Corner Brook to Gros Morne through early March 23. Snowfall of up to 15 cm (6 inches) and wind of up to 80 kph (50 mph) are forecast. Red wind warnings: far eastern Quebec Province. Easterly winds gusting up to 90 kph (56 mph) are forecast. Grey special weather statements for poor visibility and blowing snow: Nain to Natuashish and Parson's Pond to Hawke's Bay through early March 23 and Black Tickle to Rigolet through the afternoon of March 22. Officials could update and extend the coverage of weather alerts over the coming hours. Lesser snow accumulations are possible where sleet and freezing rain mix with snow. In addition to the heavy snow, strong wind gusts could lead to periods of blowing and drifting snow. Blizzard conditions are possible. Sporadic power outages may occur throughout the affected area. The inclement weather will likely cause widespread ground and air transport disruptions across the affected areas. Traffic and commercial trucking delays are probable along regional highways. Dangerous and challenging driving conditions are especially likely on secondary and rural roads as maintenance crews prioritize clearing major routes. Authorities will probably close stretches of highways if driving conditions become too hazardous. Gusty winds will threaten to topple high-profile vehicles throughout the affected areas. As a precaution, mountain passes and tunnels will likely be closed during periods of intense snowfall. The disruptive weather will probably cause delays and cancellations at airports in the affected regions. Heavy, wet snow and strong winds could bring down power lines and trees with foliage. Monitor local media for updated weather information. Verify road conditions before driving in areas where heavy snowfall is forecast. Allow extra time to reach destinations in these areas and carry an emergency kit and warm clothes if driving is necessary, especially on secondary or rural routes that could become impassable. Plan accordingly for delivery delays if routing shipments by truck through the affected area. Confirm flights. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

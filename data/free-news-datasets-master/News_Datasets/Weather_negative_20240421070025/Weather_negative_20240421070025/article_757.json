    "text": "NEW YORK (WABC) -- Heavy rain across the Tri-State Area created a mess on Saturday, with flood waters making many roadways treacherous. As the worst of the rain moved out on Saturday evening, powerful winds were set to linger into Sunday. A car was stuck in flooding on the Cross Island Parkway. The flooding has largely receded, but roads in College Point were like ponds at the rainfall's peak. In the area near Bell Boulevard, some drivers were turning around instead of trying to make it through the flooding. MTA buses on their routes were taking it slow and were still making waves. In Manhattan, heavy winds toppled a massive tree onto a car on Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side. In New Jersey, emergency management teams had a close eye on the Saddle River. Lodi OEM tells Eyewitness News the area is struggling with urban flooding. One man who lives in an apartment near the river says he has lost two cars due to flooding, but trying to move his car now creates more issues. On Saturday afternoon, water came up from the ground, backed up in storm drains. \"It's getting worse and worse every time it rains. Four, five floods in four months - we can't take it anymore,\" said Lodi Mayor Scott Luna. \"Until we get that Federal relief to do something with this river, we're in trouble,\" Luna added. Away from the Saddle River way before it crested at 8 p.m. Saturday, the flooding overtook the Boys and Girls Club parking lot - but the people of Lodi are never far enough away from the headaches. \"This is the problem - we move the car to the street because we don't want damage, and the city give me a ticket. Fifty dollars ticket,\" said Javees Nieves.",

    "text": "Forecasters are expecting a potential Easter washout with heavy rain set to batter parts of the nation. The Met Office says that the weather will be \"unsettled\" and \"changeable\" throughout the Easter weekend while weather maps show heavy downpours hitting Devon and Cornwall next week. According to the Exeter-based forecaster, the start of April could be overwhelmingly wet. It comes after the nation has seen nearly 10 inches of rain so far in March. As reported by the Express , the latest weather data show that 251mm (9.8 inches) of rain has fallen across the nation this month. However, the worst could be yet to come as the whole of the UK braces for downpours this Easter - with more rain to fall beforehand. Read next Flybe is finally wound up leaving £700m in unpaid debts Man involved with Downton Abbey died in Devon cliff fall Issuing a forecast for this weekend for the South West, the Met Office said there will be some blustery showers this evening and overnight, which could turn heavy at times carrying the risk of hail and thunder. Saturday will be a mixture of sunny spells and scattered, blustery showers, but again, these could turn heavy at times carrying the risk of hail. And the Met Office's long-range forecast says that rainfall will be extensive from March 25 to April 3. Weather maps also show that Devon and parts of the West Country are set for heavy downpours next week and throughout the weekend. The forecast states: \"Through the bank holiday weekend and into the following week, unsettled or changeable weather remains the most likely outcome. All areas are likely to see further rain or showers at times, with some drier spells in between, but wet weather will tend to favour the southwest while northern parts remain a bit drier on average.\" The most severe rain is expected to hit the South West coast next week, with up to 34mm forecasted to fall on Tuesday (March 26). Maps from WXCharts also show no part of the country left untouched by rainfall next Saturday (March 30). Met Office 5-day forecast for the South West Today: A damp start though rain gradually clearing through the morning allowing some bright or sunny spells to develop, and the odd shower possible. Breezy through the afternoon and feeling colder. Maximum temperature 12 °C. Tonight: Blustery showers continuing this evening and overnight, these turning heavy at times carrying the risk of hail and thunder. Windy and colder than recent nights. Minimum temperature 3 °C. Saturday: A mixture of sunny spells and scattered, blustery showers, these could turn heavy at times carrying the risk of hail. Feeling rather cold, especially in the stronger winds. Maximum temperature 11 °C. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Any showers gradually fading through Sunday with some sunny spells. Becoming unsettled again on Monday with outbreaks of rain, followed by showers or longer spells of rain on Tuesday.",

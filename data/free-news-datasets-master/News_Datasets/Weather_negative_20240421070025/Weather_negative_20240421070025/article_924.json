    "text": "Milwaukee gets hit with 8 inches of snow Milwaukee's east-side residents express frustration as they deal with the return of winter weather. Milwaukee's east-side residents express frustration as they deal with the return of winter weather. Milwaukee's east-side residents express frustration as they deal with the return of winter weather. The sudden return of winter weather brought more than just a morning mess to Milwaukee's east side; it also brought a wave of frustration. After a couple of months of relief, residents across the metro area found themselves dusting off their shovels and digging their way out to go anywhere this morning. >>See snowfall totals [here](https://www.wisn.com/weather/closings) \"Normally, I whistle while I work, but this time, I can't!\" one resident said. The snow was too heavy to whistle and remove simultaneously. It made for a messy commute. Our cameras captured a school bus stuck in the snow near Marquette's campus. This scene was replicated across the city, with residents seen clearing off their cars, snow blowing, or shoveling. \"I was kind of enjoying the warmer weather, but it's Wisconsin, so you can't be mad,\" Ian Kennedy, a resident of the East Side, said. When asked if he had put his shovel away, he responded, \"Nope, left it right out front.\" The snowfall also prompted a swift response from public works crews. Many had to switch their equipment from spring mode back to winter to tackle the snow. The sudden return of winter weather has served as a reminder to residents not to let their winter guard down in March, even after a couple of months of milder weather.",

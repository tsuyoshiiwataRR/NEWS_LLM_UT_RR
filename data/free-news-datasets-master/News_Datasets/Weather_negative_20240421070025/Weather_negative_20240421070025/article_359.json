    "text": "By Eliza Noe, The Virginian-Pilot ,\n11 hours ago Rain, wind and falling temperatures are expected thru Tuesday, March 14, 2017, in the area. Traffic along Granby St. in Norfolk early Tuesday morning. Bill Tiernan/The Virginian-Pilot/TNS The National Weather Service in Wakefield is warning of gusty winds over the weekend, mainly in coastal areas.\nJeff Orrock, Meteorologist in Charge at the Wakefield office, said the region is expected to get moderate to heavy rain as soon as Saturday morning. Southeast winds will increase late Friday and Saturday, gusting to 25 to 35 mph, with higher speeds likely being near the coast. Winds become northwest Sunday, with peak winds gusts around 35 mph inland and near 50 mph along the Chesapeake Bay, coast and northeast North Carolina.\n“There was a cold front that pushed through (Wednesday) night, and we did have some little increase in winds last night almost gusting to about 30 to 35 miles an hour, especially in the east,” Orrock said. “That is obviously now settled down, and you see the storm system across Texas as we get into (Thursday) evening. It continues to hold on again to Friday morning. There’s high pressure holding on for us, but you do start to see the system moving across the South of the US, and it’s going to gradually start to intensify and start to move up towards the coast.”\nBetween 1.5 to up to 3 to 4 inches of rain is possible, with the highest amounts east of Interstate 95 to the coast and Eastern Shore. In Norfolk, the weather service is estimated between 1-1.5 inches, and in Williamsburg, totals are closer to 1.5-2 inches through 8 a.m. Sunday.\nMinor coastal flooding is likely across the northern Albemarle Sound as well as the Chesapeake Bay and tidal rivers with Saturday and into Sunday.\n“The good news is with all the fires going on in the West, we are expecting a good bit of rainfall statewide,” Orrock said. “This will help with the fuel moisture. Temperatures are also going to be dropping which also helps fire behavior so this should help the crews. We are looking at a widespread decent rain event across the entire state, and the eastern half is really where we’re going to see that the bulk of the heaviest rainfall — in the eastern half of the Commonwealth.”\nThe Cherry Blossom Festival events scheduled for Saturday and Sunday have been canceled due to the forecast. The festival will continue as planned from March 25-30 at Red Wing Park.\nEliza Noe, eliza.noe@virginiamedia.com\nFor more stories, Subscribe to Virginian-Pilot.\n©2024 The Virginian-Pilot.

    "text": "Rain that starts overnight looks to last most of Saturday, which could cause flooding in some parts of central Pennsylvania. According to the National Weather Service in State College , there’s an 80% chance of rain after midnight Friday to Saturday in the Harrisburg area. It’ll also be windy, 9-13 mph with gusts up to 20 mph, but the temperature will stay well above freezing during the day — even if it doesn’t feel like it — around 42 degrees. - More: Statewide weather alerts Rain is expected to last until at early evening Saturday and could be heavy at times, the NWS says. The high temperature will be in the upper 40s, but it’ll be windy again, with gusts as high as 24 mph. The Harrisburg area could get 1-2 inches of rain before it stops. If you’re planning on attending an Easter egg hunt or other outdoor activity, check if it’s still on before you go. Even more rain could fall Saturday south and east of Harrisburg, with Adams, Lancaster, Lebanon and York counties expecting as much as 3 inches. Those counties will be under a flood watch from Friday night through Saturday night. A watch means conditions are favorable for floods to happen. The National Weather Service notes that runoff could saturate low-lying and typically flood-prone areas, including small creeks and streams. Never drive through standing water . Sunday is supposed to be dry and sunny, but windy. The forecast for the next few days: - Tonight: Cloudy, low 42 - Saturday: Rain, high 49, low 29 - Sunday: Sunny, high 51, low 29 - Monday: Mostly sunny, high 59, low 33 ©2024 Advance Local Media LLC.

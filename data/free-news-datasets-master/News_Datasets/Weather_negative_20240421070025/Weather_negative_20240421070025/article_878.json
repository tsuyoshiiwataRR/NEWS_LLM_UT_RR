    "text": "Weather Alert: Severe storm risk Sunday Large hail and damaging winds possible during the afternoon and evening WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - Meteorologist Peyton Sanders says that a strong storm system will arrive this weekend bringing gusty winds, severe thunderstorms, and snow. It will be a cold start to the day on Saturday with morning low temperatures in the 20s to near 30 degrees. Afternoon highs will reach the mid 50s to lower 60s. South winds will gust up to 40 mph over western Kansas. The winds will become even stronger on Sunday as the storm system moves into the Plains. South winds will gust between 40 and 60 mph throughout the day. The first round of rain will come Sunday morning over portions of central and eastern Kansas. Severe weather is unlikely with this activity. Scattered thunderstorms will develop over western Kansas by mid afternoon with activity moving into central Kansas during the evening. This is the round of storms that could be severe. Large hail and damaging wind gusts will be the primary threats with thunderstorms, but a tornado or two cannot entirely be ruled out. The severe threat should diminish by midnight as temperatures turn cooler and storms begin to weaken as they move into eastern Kansas. On the back side of the system, light snow will be possible over portions of western Kansas Sunday night and Monday morning. Some light accumulation will be possible in some areas, but most areas will have less than 2 inches of accumulation. WICHITA AREA FORECAST Tonight: Clear. Wind: NE 5-15. Low: 31 Tomorrow: Increasing clouds. Wind: NE/SE 5-15. High: 58 Tomorrow Night: Becoming cloudy. Breezy. Wind: SE 10-20; gusty. Low: 48 Sun: High: 62 Morning showers, then evening storms. Windy.

    "text": "A flood watch east of the Blue Ridge is in effect from 2 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, March 23, where up to an inch of rain per hour could fall, enhancing the threat of flooding, according to the NWS.\n\"A soaking rainstorm will cause problems along the I-95 corridor as the weekend gets started, with waves of rain moving in late Friday night through Saturday,\"\nAccuWeather Meteorologist Dean DeVore said. \"Expect slow travel with flooding on streets, highways and in poor drainage areas.\"\nUp to 2.5 inches of rain could fall across Maryland and Virginia before the storm tapers off Saturday afternoon and evening, March 23, according to the National Weather Service.\n\"One to 3 inches of rain is expected to fall from Washington, D.C., to Boston, with rain rates of half an inch per hour or more in some spots, which may prove to be too much for storm drains to handle,\" Meteorologist Brandon Buckingham added.\nThe storm will be a combination of two, as predicted earlier in the week: One that formed at the Canadian border and the other along the Gulf of Mexico, AccuWeather confirms.\nAccuWeather called the storm a quick-hitter, as rainfall is expected to taper off Saturday evening, with a dry day Sunday, March 24.\nArlington\n ",

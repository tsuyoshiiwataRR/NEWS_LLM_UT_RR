    "text": "After enjoying spring-like temperatures for more than a week, Calgary and southern Alberta are in the midst of another bout of winter with lots of snow. Environment and Climate Change Canada says as of Friday morning, 23 centimetres of snow was recorded at the Calgary International Airport, the most at any of its weather stations in Alberta. In its preliminary weather report , the agency said periods of heavy snow fell in many regions of Alberta beginning on Tuesday night through to Thursday evening. Some other significant accumulations were recorded at weather stations in Sundre (18 centimetres), Brooks (15 centimetres), Medicine Hat (15 centimetres) and Lethbridge (14 centimetres). The agency says more snow could be coming over the weekend, but it's only expected to be for brief periods. CTV Calgary weather specialist Jodi Hughes says its unclear how much more snow the city could see over the next couple of days. \"The synoptic setup with an upsloping flow will continue – pushing moisture back into the foothills due to the counter-clockwise circulation of a low pressure system positioned over southern Alberta and B.C.. More snow will impact southern Alberta Friday and Saturday - the area of disagreement comes in how far north the snow will land,\" she said. Some of the models are forecasting minimal amounts, she says, while others see another heavy band of snow hitting Calgary. \"These are very difficult scenarios to forecast for due to our location near the Rocky Mountains. \"I have forecast three to five centimetres for Calgary today and another five to eight centimetres Saturday – with the reasoning that it is better to be prepared for snow and pleasantly surprised if we over-estimate, compared to forecasting no snow and being unprepared.\" More weather information and forecasts can be found on our weather page .

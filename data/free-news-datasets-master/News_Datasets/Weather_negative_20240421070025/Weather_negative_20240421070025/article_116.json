    "text": "SOUTH BOSTON — Because of weather forecasts calling for persistent rain in the region Saturday, South Boston Speedway officials have postponed Saturday afternoon’s URW Community Federal Credit Union Race Day event featuring the SMART Modified Tour’s Pace-O-Matic King of the Modifieds race and have rescheduled the event for Sunday with a 3 p.m. start time. “We made this decision early in an effort give both the competitors and our loyal fans ample time to alter their plans and save them the effort and expense of coming to the track on Saturday and likely not being able to see the event,” South Boston Speedway General Manager Brandon Brown said. “Nobody likes to postpone an event early but making this decision early was done in everyone’s best interests.\" The Sunday event schedule has registration and pit gates opening at 10 a.m., practice running from noon to 1:40 p.m., gates opening and qualifying starting at 2 p.m. and the first race of the afternoon starting at 3 p.m. People are also reading… The 125-lap Pace-O-Matic King of the Modifieds race, which will pay $20,000 to win, is a new crown jewel event and will be one of the country’s biggest and richest asphalt Modified races of the season. The entry list for the race includes the stars of the SMART Modified Tour powered by Pace-O-Matic, including former NASCAR Cup Series star Ryan Newman, 2023 SMART Modified Tour Champion Burt Myers, teenager Carson Loftin who has won the first two SMART Modified Tour events of the season, and 2023 Bowman Gray Stadium NASCAR Modified Division Champion Brandon Ward. They will be joined by some of the top Modified drivers from the North including Matt Hirschman, Doug Coby, Woody Pitkat and Jimmy Blewett. A 100-lap race for South Boston Speedway’s Sentara Health Late Model Stock Car Division will co-headline Sunday afternoon’s racing action. That race will kick off the chase for the 2024 division championship. Two-time NASCAR Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series national champion Peyton Sellers, of Danville, will start his quest for a record-tying seventh South Boston Speedway NASCAR Late Model Stock Car Division championship in the race. He is expected to be joined by a number of competitors including 2023 Motor Mile Speedway champion Mike Looney, of Catawba; 2023 Martinsville Speedway winner Trevor Ward, Jacob Borst of Elon, North Carolina, and Blake Stallings of Danville. Also on Sunday, the Virginia State Police HEAT Hornets Division competitors will launch their 2024 championship chase in the 20-lap race that will round out the slate of races for the URW Community Federal Credit Union Race Day event. Advance tickets for the URW Community Federal Credit Union Race Day event are priced at $17 each. Tickets may be purchased online on South Boston Speedway’s website, www.southbostonspeedway.com or by calling the speedway office at 434-572-4947 or toll free at 1-877-440-1540 during regular business hours. Tickets at the gate on race day will be $20 each. Seniors ages 65 and older, military, health care workers, and students (with ID) can purchase tickets for $17 each at the gate on race day.",

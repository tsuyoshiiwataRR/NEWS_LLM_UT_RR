    "text": "PROVIDENCE â€“ Rivers, roads and parking lots could flood this weekend as a storm will likely drop 2 to 3 inches of rain on Rhode Island, according to the National Weather Service.\nSaturday will be a \"washout,\" with rain arriving before dawn and becoming widespread in the mid- to late morning, with the heaviest rain falling early Saturday afternoon into the night, the weather service says in its forecast discussion. Some areas could see more than 3 inches.\nThe weather service has issued a flood watch for 8 a.m. Saturday through 8 a.m. Sunday, saying, \"Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations. Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.\"\nMore: First day of spring brings warm temps, but don't put away that parka\nWhich rivers are likely to flood? River flooding is \"more than likely,\" with an 80% chance of minor flooding and a 40% chance of moderate flooding at the Pawtuxet River at Cranston, the weather service says.\nThe Wood River at Hope is \"another area to watch,\" with an 85% chance of minor flooding and a 50% chance of moderate flooding, the weather service says.\nAlso expect gusty winds Saturday night into Sunday morning, the weather service says.\nThe rain should end quickly on Sunday morning, possibly before dawn, and the day will be partly sunny and breezy with a high near 42 in Providence, the weather service says.",

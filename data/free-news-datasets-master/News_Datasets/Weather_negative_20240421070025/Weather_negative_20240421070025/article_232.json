    "text": "READ MORE: The price of some Easter eggs has risen by 50 per cent in the UK Wet heatwaves and drought in West Africa have severely harmed cocoa crops With Easter fast approaching, you might have already begun to notice that Easter eggs are more expensive this year.\nBut this isn’t just due to inflation, as scientists say climate change is a key reason your chocolate is costing more.\nAccording to researchers from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a combination of wet heatwaves and drought have battered this year’s cocoa harvest.\nCombined with a strong El Niño year, this has pushed up the price of some Easter eggs by more than 50 per cent according to Which? data.\nBen Clarke, an expert on extreme weather from Imperial College London, said: ‘[Climate change] fuels more extreme conditions, devastates harvests, and makes food costs higher for all.’\nSome Easter eggs in the UK are now up to 50 per cent more expensive than last year, and experts say that climate change is to blame (file photo)\nREAD MORE: The real cost of climate change: Global warming could cost the world up to $24 TRILLION over the next 36 years, scientists warn As the choc-heavy holiday of Easter approaches, the prices of some Easter eggs might come as quite a shock.\nSome retail prices for the treats are now more than 50 per cent higher than in previous years.\nThe Maltesers Truffles Luxury Easter Egg now costs £13 – a 62.5 per cent increase from last year.\nLikewise, a Ferrero Rocher Golden Easter Egg will now set you back a whopping £15 – 50 per cent more than in 2023.\nNot only are prices getting higher each year, but consumers are also getting less more their money.\nBrands such as Cadbury, Galaxy, Mars, Twix, KitKat, Smarties, Yorkie, and Terrys have all shrunk the size of the nation’s favourite Easter eggs.\nAs ‘shrinkflation’ hits, the large Mars milk chocolate egg is down from 252g to 201g – a reduction of 20 per cent – yet the price has remained the same at £3.\nMeanwhile, the Twix milk chocolate Easter egg is down from 246g to 200g and the Galaxy Minstrels Easter Egg has been cut from 234g to 192g.\nThis price surge has been driven by extreme weather conditions in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, according to the new study.\nIn 2023, the UK imported 58,000 tonnes of cocoa worth £127 million ($162m) from these two countries alone.\nHowever, last year both countries experienced abnormally intense rains and extremely high temperatures.\nIn West Africa, where most of the world’s cocoa grows, total rainfall in December was more than double the 30-year average.\nIn wet conditions, cocoa trees are blighted by a fungal infection called black pod disease which causes the cocoa beans to rot on the tree.\nTo make matters worse, these wet conditions were then followed by an extremely hot drought.\nThe price of chocolate has risen, leading to many producers either raising prices or shrinking the product to cut costs\nShrinking Easter Eggs BEFORE AFTER 2023 2024 Mars milk chocolate large Easter egg 252g 201g £3.00 £3.00 Twix milk chocolate Easter egg 246g 200g £3.00 £3.00 Galaxy Minstrels Easter egg 234g 192g £3.00 £3.00\nCadbury Mini Eggs Large Family Chocolate Bag 296g 270g £3.50 £3.50 Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit and Nut Ultimate Chocolate Egg 532g 400g £10.00 £10.00\nKitKat Chunky Milk Chocolate Large Easter Egg 230g 190g £3.50 £3.50 Smarties Orange Easter Egg Large 226g 188g £3.00 £3.00 Yorkie Milk Chocolate Large Easter Egg 242g 196g £3.50 £3.50\nLindt Mini Eggs Canister 177g 155g £4.00 £5.00 Terry’s Chocolate Orange Egg & Mini Eggs 230g 200g £3.06 £3.19 Source: Average prices from Which? In both Ghana and Ivory Coast, temperatures smashed historical records, climbing above 40°C (104°F).\nThe extreme heat has led to drought conditions which have persisted since February, drastically reducing crop yields and pushing up prices.\nThe price of raw cocoa has more than trebled in the last 12 months and more than doubled in the last three months alone.\nCurrently, the cost of cocoa has reached over £6,700 ($8,500) per tonne, according to Markets Insider, up from £2,030 ($2,600) per tonne this time last year.\nNormally, producers would purchase cocoa well in advance, insulating consumers from price shocks.\nHowever, the ECIU noted that the impacts of this volatile weather ‘has fed through to international commodity prices’.\nThe ECIU report also warned that this extreme weather is threatening other staple foods imported to the UK, including rice from India, coffee from Vietnam, tea from Kenya, and grapes from South Africa.\nThe vast majority of the UK’s chocolate comes from farms in Ghana (pictured) or Ivory Coast where a combination of wet heatwaves and drought have drastically reduced crop yields\nREAD MORE: Your sweet tooth is about to get more expensive! Cocoa prices are now DOUBLE what they were a year ago as El Nino weather wreaks havoc on global supply Worryingly, scientists say that ongoing human-induced climate change makes extreme weather conditions like this all the more likely.\nThis year’s extreme weather was in part fueled by a strong El Niño that has led to warmer weather conditions across the globe.\nEl Niño is a cyclical natural phenomenon in the tropical eastern Pacific which brings heat to the surface and can add an extra warming effect to the atmosphere and oceans.\nHowever, analysis from the World Weather Attribution Group suggests that climate change makes extreme temperatures 10 times more likely.\nThe researchers found that, if humanity does not quickly reduce its emissions, West Africa will experience similar heatwaves once every two years.\nMr Clarke says: ‘El Nino years often lead to challenges for farmers through changing patterns of weather.\n‘Increasingly, climate change, driven by fossil fuel use, is multiplying this natural challenge in many regions.’\nCocoa is especially vulnerable to these kinds of extreme weather challenges since it grows in such a select region.\nCocoa trees only grow in a narrow band of about 20 degrees around the equator.\nAccording to ECIU, 99 per cent of the world’s cocoa is grown in countries that are the most vulnerable and least well prepared to deal with climate change.\nAnd, while higher prices might be a challenge for consumers, they may pose an even bigger threat to farmers.\nJon Walker, Fairtrade’s senior advisor for cocoa, says: ‘While high prices may seem like a windfall for farmers, once they eventually filter through to the farmgate, the underlying causes are worrying.\n‘Higher prices offset by lower productivity simply perpetuates the income insecurity that keeps farmers trapped in poverty and threatens the future of cocoa.’\nMr Walker adds: ‘It remains to be seen if supply will bounce back, or whether the current trend will be longer-lasting.’\nRead more",

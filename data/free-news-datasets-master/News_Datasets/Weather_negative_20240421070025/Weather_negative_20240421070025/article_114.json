    "text": "MISSOULA, Mont. - The Montana Climate Office (MCO) continues to see record-low snowpack across many watersheds in Western Montana which could lead to limited water resources in the summer. The MCO is based at the University of Montana in the W.A. Franke College of Forestry and Conservation. It reports daily drought conditions across the Treasure State and its data is used by the Montana Drought and Water Supply Monitoring Committee to help prepare for the summer months. Its current findings are showing some of the lowest snowpack projections since they started collecting data in 2003. \"We're seeing snowpack that is 50% to 60% of normal [snowpack]. But in many cases, that is the lowest on record,\" said Kyle Bocinsky, the MCO Director of Climate Extension. The basins experiencing the most significant snowpack deficits include the Blackfoot, Middle and South Forks of the Flathead, and Sun and Smith River basins. Stuart Mountain by Missoula currently has a bottom two percentile in snow water equivalent levels in 2024 . Cooper Camp nearby Lincoln is currently projected to have a bottom five percentile in snow water equivalent this year as well. The lack of snowpack could lead to less water for local agriculture, and early closures for recreation and fishing in the summer if the snowpack melts quickly. \"If it all melts at once, that would be bad and lead to even more drastic water availability issues going into the summer. If we have cold temperatures and that can sort of keep that snowpack lingering on into the season, that will help ameliorate some of those concerns,\" Bocinsky explained. Bocinsky believes that the areas in western Montana would need abnormal amounts of snow and precipitation over the next four weeks to recover from this dry winter.

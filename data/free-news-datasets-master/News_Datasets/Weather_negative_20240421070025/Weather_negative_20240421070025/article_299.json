IT’S GOING TO BE A COLD START TO YOUR DAY NOW. HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE OVER THE TOP OF US TOMORROW, SO THE BIG WIND MAKER WILL BE GONE. THIS WILL BE A LITTLE BREEZY TOMORROW, BUT NOT THE WIND THAT WE HAD TODAY. NOW ONCE THIS DRIFTS OFF, IT’S GOING TO ALLOW THE NEXT SYSTEM TO COME IN THE COLD AIR STAYS HERE. SO WHEN THIS THING COMES IN, IT’S COLD ENOUGH. ESPECIALLY IN NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND, THAT WE’LL HAVE SOME SNOW. BUT I THINK INITIALLY WE’LL SEE A LITTLE BIT OF SNOW OR SOME MIX, AND THEN IT WILL QUICKLY CHANGE OVER TO RAIN BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL OF THIS RAIN COMING IN AND IT’S DRAGGING WITH IT SOME WARM AIR AS WELL. SO IT’S KIND OF A CLASSIC SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE RAIN HERE, BUT UP IN THE MOUNTAINS OF THE NORTH QUITE A BIT OF SNOW. NOW THE THING IS PICKED UP SOME SPEED SO IT WILL BE OUT OF HERE. IT LOOKS LIKE ON SUNDAY, SUNDAY MORNING SOME CLOUDS, BUT BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON I THINK WE’LL SEE A LITTLE SUNSHINE. IT’S NOT GOING TO BE MUCH OF A SNOW EVENT. MAYBE A COATING TO AN INCH IN THE GRASSY AREAS AS YOU GO TO THE NORTH IT GETS A LITTLE HEAVIER, BUT ONCE YOU GET NORTH OF MANCHESTER, NORTH OF CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE. NOW WE START TO TALK ABOUT SOME SERIOUS. AMOUNTS OF SNOW, ESPECIALLY INTO THE MOUNTAINS. GREEN AND WHITE MOUNTAINS COULD PICK UP A FOOT OF SNOW IN SOME SPOTS. WELCOME NEWS FOR THOSE SPRING SKIERS. BUT IN SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND, IT’S MOSTLY A RAIN EVENT AND A LOT OF RAIN. 1 TO 2IN SEEM PRETTY LIKELY. THERE MIGHT BE SOME ISOLATED AREAS THAT GET EVEN MORE THAN THAT, AND THIS IS GOING TO COME DOWN REALLY FURIOUSLY ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND SATURDAY EVENING. SO THERE’S GOING TO BE PONDING ON THE ROADS. WE’RE ALSO GOING TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE RIVERS AND STREAMS BECAUSE MORE THAN LIKELY THEY WILL FILL BACK UP AGAIN. SO THE TIMING OF THIS IS SUCH THAT BY 5:00 IN THE MORNING YOU SEE A LITTLE BIT OF SNOW UP HERE, A LITTLE BIT OF MIX GOING ON, AND THIS WILL KIND OF WORK ITS WAY IN. AND EVENTUALLY NOW. THE RAIN STARTS TO PUSH IN WITH JUST WARM ENOUGH AIR TO CHANGE IT OVER TO A COLD, WINTRY MIX. AND THEN AS THE DAY GOES ON, MORE RAIN COMES IN. THE TEMPERATURES. WARM UP A LITTLE BIT MORE. THESE ARE NOT BAD TEMPERATURES, BUT WITH A WIND DRIVEN RAIN IT WILL NEVER FEEL THAT WARM TO YOU. SO BY 3:00 WE’RE SEEING THE DOWNPOURS. BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE EVENING HOURS, WE’VE GOT A LOT OF RAIN TO TALK ABOUT, BUT IT’S QUICKLY MOVING OUT OF HERE, HERE. SO AFTER MIDNIGHT ON SATURDAY NIGHT, EARLY SUNDAY MORNING, IT’S GOING TO BE GONE. AND ON SUNDAY, CLOUDS IN THE MORNING. BUT I THINK WE WILL GET TO ENJOY. A LITTLE SUNSHINE IN THE AFTERNOON. THE WINDS, THEY’RE GOING TO GET REALLY STRONG AS WE HEAD TOWARDS SATURDAY EVENING. NOW ON SUNDAY THEY SWITCH DIRECTIONS. THEY’RE STILL BUSY, BUT NOT QUITE AS STRONG AS THEY WILL BE ON SATURDAY NIGHT. SO TOMORROW, LET’S CALL IT A LITTLE. BIT ON THE BREEZY SIDE, BUT LESS WIND IS CERTAINLY NICER THAN TODAY’S HOWLING WINDS. 44 FOR A HIGH. SATURDAY IS 50 DEGREES, BUT IT STARTS WITH SNOW CHANGES OVER TO WIND DRIVEN RAIN. NOT A PLEASANT DAY. THAT’S WHY WE’VE MADE AN IMPACT. WEATHER DAY. AND THEN ON SUNDAY, IT’S CLEARING AWAY, BUT IT’S WINDY AND 44 DEGREES. KIND. OF LIKE TODAY. AND WE’LL GET A COUPLE OF DAYS OF DRY WEATHER COMING HERE MONDAY AND TUESDAY. WE COULD USE THE DRY. WEATHER BECAUSE WE DON’T NEED ANY MORE RAIN AND WE’VE GOT MORE TO TAL Advertisement Video: Weekend storm to bring wintry mix to Mass., snow for northern New England StormTeam 5 has a look at the forecast for Boston, Massachusetts and New England.

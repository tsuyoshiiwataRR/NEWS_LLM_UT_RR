    "text": "The city of Charleston is bracing for hazardous weather Friday and Saturday, giving Mayor William Cogswell’s new flooding mitigation plan its first stress test. Rain is expected to intensify throughout the day, with peak periods of heavy rain expected from 8 p.m. to midnight. The heavy rain and an elevated evening tide is predicted to contribute to significant flooding — high tides are forecasted at 6.8 feet at 7.27 p.m., and projections show potential for 2 to 3 inches of rain, according to the city. Meanwhile, the Charleston Police Department is loading barricades and will place them in advance of flooding on vulnerable streets across the peninsula. Signal technicians also will be on standby for traffic and transportation needs. City officials estimate between 12 and 25 roads may become “impassable” In the storm. Follow road-closure updates live online at gis.charleston-sc.gov . Lake Dotterer and Colonial Lake have been lowered in advance, and four pumps will be deployed to manage water levels. In addition, temporary pumps have been installed in vulnerable areas throughout the city. DEBRIS: Residents are urged to secure garbage cans and remove any potential debris from storm drains in front of homes and businesses to prevent blockages. Sweepers, trash, and garbage crews will be on standby to clean up any debris on Saturday. The city also says it will monitor Church Creek Basin in West Ashley and work to keep drains and ditches clean. Department of Livability teams have been assisting in identifying and clearing debris and litter since yesterday to mitigate potential blockages. PARKING: Free parking will be available from 4 p.m. Friday until noon Saturday at the 99 West Edge and the Charleston Tech Center parking garages. All other city garages will be open for those who prefer more convenient options and are willing to pay. Residents are asked to not use parking garages in the Medical District which are intended for staff and patients. Voting is now open in Best of Charleston!

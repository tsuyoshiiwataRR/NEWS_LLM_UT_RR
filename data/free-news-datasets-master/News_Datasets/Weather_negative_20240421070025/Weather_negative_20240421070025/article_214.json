    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS â€” Several spinouts and crashes are being reported throughout the Twin Cities Thursday night as a result of the slick conditions from the first wave of this weekend's spring snowstorm. Thursday night's snowfall is the first of two storms that are expected to pack a pretty potent one-two punch. [Slow travel](/traffic) is being reported on most of the major highways as of 9 p.m., with backups near some of the collisions. A Winter Weather Advisory will be in effect for most of central and southeastern Minnesota until 10 a.m. Friday as snow continues to fall through the night. Accumulations look to be between 2-5 inches, with a few isolated spots getting up to 6 inches.

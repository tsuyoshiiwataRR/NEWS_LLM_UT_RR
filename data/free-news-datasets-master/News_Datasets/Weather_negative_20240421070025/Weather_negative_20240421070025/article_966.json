    "text": "FORKS (WGME)--- A logging truck veered off-road and into Martin Pond leaving the driver dead. Authorities believe white-out conditions and inclement weather to be the cause of the incident. Somerset County Sheriff’s Office alleges that 35-year-old Alexander Drolet of Quebec was driving a tractor-trailer truck southbound, hauling tree-length logs in the early morning hours on Thursday. Around 4 a.m. on Route 201 in the town of Forks, Drolet’s tractor-trailer drove off the road and into Martin Pond. Sheriff’s deputies believe Drolet was alone in the vehicle at the time of the accident. The tractor-trailer was removed several hours later Thursday afternoon. Drolet’s body was located on Friday around 1 p.m. by the Maine State Police dive team and Wardens from the Maine Warden Service recovered Drolet’s body from the pond. The incident is still under investigation, though inclement weather and white-out conditions appear to have contributed to the crash. An autopsy will determine Drolet’s cause of death in the coming days.",

    "text": "The body of missing college student Riley Strain was recovered from the Cumberland River in Tennessee on Friday. BOISE, Idaho â€” It should be a cloudy day around the region. Conditions should remain dry for most, if not all of southwest Idaho. Highs will warm a few degrees ahead of tomorrow's front. Look for highs in the mid to upper 60s today. Saturday's storm will bring widespread rain to the area. Models show the heaviest rain will fall in the first half of the day. After the period of heavy rain, look for scattered showers to continue into Saturday night. We may see some spotty showers continue into the early hours on Sunday morning. After that, look for a mix of sun and clouds for the rest of the day. Highs will cool in the upper 50s tomorrow. Highs should stay in the low to mid-50s into early next week. The pattern will remain unsettled as we enter next week. We could see some more showers on Monday and Tuesday, but models show that widespread rain will likely hold on until Wednesday. Stay tuned!",

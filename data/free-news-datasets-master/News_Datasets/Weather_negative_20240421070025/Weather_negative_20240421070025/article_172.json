    "text": "A strong winter storm is expected to impact much of the region starting Saturday evening through Sunday. Temperatures will drop from the upper 30s and 40s Saturday, to the low to upper 20s Sunday. Several inches of snow will also be possible across the forecast area, with 2 to 6 inches anticipated for our west-central counties, and 6 to 10 inches in the eastern plains. The highest chances for moderate impacts will be in the far east where strong winds (up to 35 mph) and heavy snow are expected. A Winter Storm Watch has been issued for Rosebud, Custer, Fallon, and Carter counties, Saturday at 6 pm, where difficult travel and low visibility will be possible.",

Alvarez / Staff Photographer by Anthony R. Wood Updated Mar. 22, 2024, 5:25 p.m. ET | Published Mar. 22, 2024, 12:45 p.m. ET A flood watch is in effect for the entire region for the first weekend of spring for soaking downpours that were expected to result in the rainiest March day in 150 years of record-keeping in Philadelphia.\nA potent storm that will drench the I-95 corridor from Washington to Boston is forecast to generate widespread heavy rains, with up to 4 inches in and around Philly, from late Friday night or early Saturday into Saturday evening, the National Weather Service says. The heaviest rain is expected late Saturday morning and in the afternoon.\nThe flood watch is in place from 4 a.m. Saturday until 8 a.m. Sunday. Some stream flooding could occur and power outages are “possible,” the weather service says, with winds forecast to gust to 45 mph Saturday night at the Shore and 40 mph inland.\nLate Friday the storm appeared destined to follow a track right along the coast that would put the I-95 corridor in the bull’s-eye of the heaviest rain, said Eric Hoeflich, a meteorologist with the weather service’s Mount Holly office.\nAdvertisement » READ MORE: Spring is a volatile season, and it can affect your health\nA wild card would be the development of a corridor of very heavy rain, where 4 inches or more could fall. “That’s going to be a nowcast situation,” said the weather service’s Joe DeSilva. In other words, we won’t know until it happens.\nThe record for precipitation for any March day in Philadelphia is 2.79 inches, set in 1912. The record for March 23 is 1.36 inches, set in 2005.\nThe warm Atlantic, not to mention El Niño The storm, tracking from the South, will be feeding off two generous moisture supplies, said Dave Dombek, senior meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc.\n“It’s tapping into some pretty moist air that’s across the Southeast,” he said. As is typical during El Niño events, when the water temperatures over vast expanses of the tropical Pacific are well above normal and affect upper-air patterns, storm tracks across the southern United States become active.\n» READ MORE: With El Niño, forecasters said big coastal storms were possible\nRainfall in the Southeast was well above average during the winter and has left a moist legacy in the air, said Dombek. The weather service said the storm will tap into “deep tropical moisture.”\nPlus, with its onshore winds, on Saturday the storm will be importing moisture from the Atlantic, where sea-surface temperatures also are substantially above normal. “There’s some really juicy air, and almost borderline tropical air offshore,” said Dombek.\nThe potential impacts It’s possible that some streams could slosh over, and urban street flooding is very likely, the weather service says.\nScattered power outages are in play as the ground becomes saturated.\nFortunately, most of the trees aren’t yet weighted down with leaves, and that lessens the potential for tree damage, as winds can sail through bare branches.\nAlso, no measurable rain has fallen in two weeks, and Dombek noted it has been quite windy, and that has contributed to drying out the soils.\nThe rain is expected back off around 8 p.m. Saturday.\n» READ MORE: For Sunday's half-marathoners, expect a dry, but quite a chilly, run\nThe sun is due to reappear Sunday, but for the 12,000 people expected to participate in Philly’s Love Run , it will be a chilly half marathon or 7K, with temperatures in the low to mid-30s, winds from the north gusting 30 to 35 mph, and wind chills in the 20s. At least it should be a dry run.",

    "text": "Major snowfall affects evening commute in Mississauga, Brampton, Hamilton and Halton\n 5:27 pm\nCommuters across the Greater Toronto Area and parts of eastern Ontario had to contend with blowing snow and slippery sidewalks while heading home Friday evening as a blast of wintery weather hit parts of the province.\nEnvironment Canada has placed a region stretching from Hamilton all the way east past Kingston, Ont., under snowfall warnings, saying it was predicting up to 15 centimetres of snow.\nThe weather agency says the snow is expected to continue into the evening and then is set to taper off from west to east late in the night.\nIt warns the snowfall could have “significant impact” on the evening commute, making for low visibility and potentially slick roadways.\nEnvironment Canada has said peak snowfall rates of two centimetres per hour are possible.\nIt says surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\nThe agency says people should be ready to adjust their driving with changing road conditions.\nIt says drivers should turn on their lights and maintain a safe following distance if visibility is reduced while driving.\nOther parts of Ontario, including Windsor and London, are under a weather advisory, with between five and 10 centimetres of snow in the forecast.\n ",

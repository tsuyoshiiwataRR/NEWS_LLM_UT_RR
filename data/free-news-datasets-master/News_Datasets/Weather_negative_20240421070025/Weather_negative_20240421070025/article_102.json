    "text": "A new weather warning is in place for Durham Region. Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement that applies to Ajax, Pickering, Oshawa, Whitby and south Durham, along with Uxbridge, Beaverton and northern Durham, stating that “significant snowfall” is possible on Friday and Friday night (March 22). Hazards for all Durham residents include five to 10 centimetres of snow, with locally higher amounts possible, and reduced visibility in areas of heavier snow, the national weather agency said in its [statement for Durham residents](https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?onrm11=). “Light snow is expected to begin Friday morning, but should intensify late in the afternoon or evening. The snow should taper off from west to east late Friday night,” the statement for Durham reads. “Confidence in exact snowfall amounts at this point is low, although many areas may receive 5 to 10 cm of snow. Note that even higher amounts are possible for areas near Lake Ontario. There is also a risk of freezing rain for areas near Lake Erie Friday evening.” Environment Canada added that the snow “may have a significant impact” on the evening commute on Friday in more urban areas. This weather warning comes in the midst of [several road closures already in place on Highway 401 through Durham](https://www.durhamregion.com/news/all-lanes-closed-significant-highway-401-closures-in-ajax-and-pickering-as-well-as-oshawa/article_ace23d8c-4ace-5ad3-94eb-3ea80fe581ee.html) that, coupled with the snowfall, could wreak serious havoc on roads. This is the [second weather warning](https://www.durhamregion.com/news/environment-canada-puts-ajax-and-pickering-as-well-as-oshawa-whitby-and-rest-of-durham/article_9e9546ed-aec5-55d9-b7bb-b98644df6528.html) of the spring in Durham, and spring is only two days old. The Ontario government, as well as other weather and travel agencies, say that drivers should remember to stay safe during the colder months and be prepared for snowfall at all times, given its unpredictability in certain conditions.

Drivers should also ensure they have an ice scraper and washer fluid in their vehicle at all times.",

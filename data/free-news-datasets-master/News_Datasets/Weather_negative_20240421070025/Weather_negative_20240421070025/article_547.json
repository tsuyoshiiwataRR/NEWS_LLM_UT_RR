    "text": "Winter storm warning: Map shows 17 states on snow alert as up to 18 INCHES to fall Two different storm systems are set to bring heavy snowfall across northern regions throughout the weekend, with a massive 18 inches possible in some parts. Winter weather warnings are in effect for parts of 17 states as two distinct storm systems promise heavy snowfall across New England and northern regions throughout the weekend. The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued winter storm warnings spanning [Alaska](/latest/alaska), [California](https://www.the-express.com/latest/california), [Maine](/latest/maine), [Minnesota](/latest/minnesota), [Montana](/latest/montana), [New Hampshire](/latest/new-hampshire), [New York](https://www.the-express.com/latest/new-york), and [Vermont](/latest/vermont). Additionally, advisories are active in [Connecticut](/latest/connecticut), the Dakotas, [Illinois](/latest/illinois), [Iowa](/latest/iowa), [Massachusetts](/latest/massachusetts), [Michigan](/latest/michigan), [Nevada](/latest/nevada), and [Wisconsin](/latest/wisconsin). According to the latest forecast, a weather front is poised to generate snow showers over the Midwest and Great Lakes on Friday, with a subsequent shift into the Ohio Valley. This movement is expected to unleash a swath of heavy snow across areas downwind of Lake Ontario and into New England. Some parts of New England have already witnessed late-winter snow due to a previous storm earlier in the week, with forecasts predicting up to a foot of additional snowfall in the region by Sunday morning.

Ice is also expected, creating hazardous road conditions. Similar conditions are forecast for [New Hampshire](/latest/new-hampshire), where up to 18 inches of snow, along with sleet, ice, and winds reaching 35 miles per hour, are anticipated. Vermont and [New York](https://www.the-express.com/latest/new-york) could see as much as 17 inches of snow, posing the risk of scattered power outages due to the weight of the snow on tree limbs. [Vermont](/latest/vermont) is also expected to experience a 10th of an inch of ice accumulation. In Massachusetts and Connecticut, up to two inches of snow is expected, along with ice accumulations of up to a 10th of an inch. Moving westward into the Great Lakes region, Michigan may see up to seven inches of snow, while Wisconsin anticipates up to six inches. Similar snowfall is forecast for northern border counties of Illinois and northeastern Iowa, with five to six inches expected. Central Minnesota could witness up to seven inches of snow, with southeastern North Dakota and northeastern South Dakota likely to see six inches and one inch, respectively. DON'T MISS: Simultaneously, another system is poised to bring unsettled weather to the West, with heavy rainfall predicted along coastal areas and up to four feet of snow in mountainous regions. As this system progresses, it is expected to weaken over the Rockies on Saturday before redeveloping into a significant winter storm over the Front Range by Sunday. Earlier this month, [powerful winter storms from the Pacific and Intermountain West regions brought substantial snowfall](/latest/weather) to various areas, including the Sierra Nevada range, the Rocky Mountains, and neighboring states. Residents are urged to stay informed of weather updates and exercise caution as these storm systems unfold, with potential impacts on travel and daily activities.

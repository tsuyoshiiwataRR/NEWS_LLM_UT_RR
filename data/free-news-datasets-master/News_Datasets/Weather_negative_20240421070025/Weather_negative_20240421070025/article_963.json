    "text": "Eau Claire picked up it's largest snow total of the winter year last night with 4.3\". Most of the Chippewa Valley ranged from our 2\" to 5\" forecast, and the spots with that narrow band of even heavier snow set up in Polk and southern Barron counties. Chetek had 8\" snow, but areas just a few miles north were back below 5\". A Winter Storm Watch is already in effect for Polk, St. Croix, Barron, and Rusk counties from 7am Sunday until 10am Monday. Expansion of this watch is possible tonight/tomorrow if forecast continues to trend in the way it has been. The snow that is likely for all of Western Wisconsin on Sunday will fall at heavy rates at times and will be of the wet and heavy variety. Some sources and weather models are suggesting widespread areas of over 12\" snow possible. The caveat is that 12\" is very hard to get. In fact, it can take over 20\" snow (depending on water content) to fall in order for there to be just 12\" on the ground at the end of the system. The reason why is called compaction. When snow adds up, the crystals stick to each other and leave gaps of air. Imagine that you go outside and measure 3\" snow. If you don't clear that area back to bare ground, another 3\" snow would fall on top of that snow and the weight of the snow will squish the snow pack and reduce how big those air pockets are. By the time there is 9\" snow (so three equal amounts of 3\" snow), It will have weighed down to about 7\". This compaction happens exponentially the more snow that you get. So, 12\" to 20\" snow is certainly possible to fall, but that doesn't mean you'll be able to stick a tape measure into the ground at the end of it all and measure much more than 6 to 12 inches for most places. The NWS and other official measurement sites measure four times a day (every 6 hours), and clear off the snow board after measuring to try to measure how much snow actually has fallen. The separate depth on ground measurement becomes more important to the impacts you'll see. Expect a nice but chilly Saturday before scattered snow showers arrive late Saturday night and into Sunday morning. Snow will quickly fill in and become heavy later in the day, especially by late evening. This will create very poor travel conditions Sunday, especially Sunday night into Monday morning. Snow will continue until early Monday morning when temps will begin to warm and Western Wisconsin will see a transition from snow to rain as highs climb into the 40s. Rain could be moderate to heavy at times Monday. It'll be very windy as this system moves through Sunday through Tuesday. As mentioned earlier, snow totals will be tough to measure both due to the wind and compaction of that heavy, wet snow. Totals will be heaviest northwest where it's more likely to stay as snow longer. Eau Claire, Durand, Medford, and areas northwest will almost certainly see 6 to 12\" fall and parts of St. Croix, Polk, Barron, and Rusk could have 12\" to 18\"+ fall, but again that doesn't mean that's how much will be on the ground at the end since the warmer air Monday and associated rain will melt snow in addition to the compaction. The great news to us in Western Wisconsin is that regardless snow totals and who gets mostly snow and who has extended periods of rain, the liquid equivalent of the rain and/or snow will help our dry soil and drought conditions. Between 1/2\" and 2\" liquid will be widespread and some spots could end up with over 3\".",

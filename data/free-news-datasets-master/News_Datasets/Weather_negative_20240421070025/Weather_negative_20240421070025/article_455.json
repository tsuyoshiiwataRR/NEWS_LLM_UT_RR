    "text": "PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- Sunshine on Friday will preceded a very wet start to the weekend. The rain will begin to spread across the entire area after midnight Friday night and will continue to fall through Saturday afternoon.\nWe've issued a NEXT Weather Alert for Saturday to keep you aware of the steady to heavy rain expected and the resulting flood potential\nSaturday is going to be a great day to do chores indoors, maybe watch a movie, do some arts and crafts or like many watch NCAA Basketball all da long. If you're a gamer, maybe check out the new update to Stardew Valley . It's not a day you want to be outside.\nFriday morning, temperatures were breaking out of the 20s after sunrise - an especially cold morning on what's been a mostly warm month. The sun will warm us up to 50 degrees by the afternoon but it'll be a chilly morning.\nWhen does rain arrive in Philadelphia region? Light showers will begin to arrive after midnight in the wee hours of Saturday morning. Then there's a steady stream of rain that will likely last through a good portion of the day.\nPeriods of heavy rain will be possibly through midday with the greatest amount of rain setting up over the I-95 corridor, dropping the most water on spots like Northern Delaware, Philadelphia and Trenton, New Jersey. The heaviest rain starts to taper off around midafternoon Saturday.\nRainfall totals between 2-4 inches should be expected across the region and will produce the threat for flooding, especially in low laying and poorly drained areas. A Flood Watch has been issued for the entire area from 4:00 am Saturday until 8:00 am Sunday.\nThe rain will begin to clear out of the region Saturday evening as drier, but windy conditions settle in overnight into Sunday. Wind gusts into Sunday morning will increase to 30-35 mph which, with the saturated ground, may cause some trees to uproot and come down.\nBreezy, but sunny conditions will continue through the day Sunday as temperatures peak in the low 50s.\nHere's your 7-day forecast: Friday: Cool and sunny.

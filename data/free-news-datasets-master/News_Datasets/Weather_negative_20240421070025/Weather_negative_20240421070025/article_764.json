    "text": "As winter turned to spring, a mid-March storm dropped several feet of snow on Colorado.\nAs winter turned to spring, a mid-March storm dropped several feet of snow on Colorado. Clear skies on March 19, 2024, allowed the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument on NASA’s Terra satellite to capture this image of snow covering the Rocky Mountains.\nA potent low-pressure system swept through the state on March 13 and 14, bringing 10 to 20 inches (25 to 50 centimeters) to the Denver and Boulder metropolitan areas. Some of the highest snowfall totals were recorded on March 14 in the high elevations of the southern Rocky Mountains, according to NOAA’s daily snowfall observations. In Nederland, 28 miles northwest of Denver, 53 inches of snow was recorded after the storm.\nThe snowstorm caused power outages, road closures, and 800 canceled flights at Denver International Airport. According to news reports, Interstate 70, which runs through the Rockies, was closed for much of March 14 due to safety concerns.\nRead more at\nNASA Earth Observatory\nImage: NASA Earth Observatory image by Wanmei Liang, using MODIS data from NASA EOSDIS LANCE and GIBS/Worldview.",

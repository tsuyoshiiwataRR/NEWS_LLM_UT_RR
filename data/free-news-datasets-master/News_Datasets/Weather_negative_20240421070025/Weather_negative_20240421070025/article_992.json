    "text": "A traffic shift planned this weekend on I-75 between M-15 / Ortonville Road and the Oakland/Genesee county line has been canceled. Blame the snow, according to an MDOT spokeswoman. Traffic will shift next week. That means two lanes of traffic in each direction on the existing southbound I-75 lanes throughout the construction zone. MDOT is investing approximately $160 million in this 4-year project for resurfacing and repairing this section of I-75 This project includes repairing 11 bridges, improving drainage, replacing culvert, signs, and the guardrail. The work will directly and indirectly support 1,936 jobs, according to MDOT officials. Closures will start at 3 a.m. Monday, March 25, through Thursday, Oct. 31: • Northbound and southbound I-75 will have two lanes open in each direction between M-15 and Baldwin Road but traffic will be shifted to I-75’s southbound side. • Current entrance ramp closures through late fall include the Saginaw Road entrance ramp to southbound I-75 at mile marker 106 and the Dixie Highway entrance ramp to southbound I-75 at mile marker 93. Several other entrance ramps will be closed during this project: • Northbound M-15 to northbound I-75 • Southbound M-15 to northbound I-75 • Northbound Dixie Highway to northbound I-75 • Southbound Dixie Highway to northbound I-75 • East Holly Road to northbound I-75 • Dixie Highway (Mile Marker 106) to northbound I-75 The northbound I-75 Exit 101 to Grange Hall Road will be closed. Southbound I-75 Exit 106 to Saginaw Road is closed through late fall. The Davisburg Rest Area on northbound I-75 will be closed. All roadwork is weather dependent and could cause future schedule changes.",

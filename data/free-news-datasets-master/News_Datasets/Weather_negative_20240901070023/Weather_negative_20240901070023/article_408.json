    "text": "Millions of Brits face thunderstorms, hail and flooding today (Thursday, August 1) - and weather forecasters are warning the grim conditions may last longer than initially expected. It comes following consecutive days where temperatures exceeded 30C. The mercury is expected to rise to around 30C again today in London, reaching the high-20Cs on the south coast, the Midlands and in Wales too, but the heatwave will be hampered by storms. The Met Office has a yellow thunderstorm warning in place until 11.59pm tonight. It covers almost all of England and parts of Wales, with people warned of &quot;power cuts&quot; as well as &quot;fast flowing or deep floodwater&quot; that could pose a &quot;danger to life&quot;. However, forecasters now expect the thunderstorms to continue into Friday (August 2) - and possibly longer. In an update on Facebook, Exacta Weather forecaster James Madden said we should see temperatures reach the &quot;high-20Cs&quot; again on Friday, before they really start to cool off. This could bring a &quot;further risk of developing thunderstorms&quot; as we head into the weekend. Temperatures could hit 30C once again today (Thursday, August 1) As for today, Madden identified &quot;central, southern and eastern England&quot; as where the risk of &quot;localised flooding and/or large hail&quot; is greatest. He then expects temperatures to warm up again from August 10 to August 15, and previously warned this second heatwave could be &quot;more extreme&quot; than the current one. Experts at Netweather have a &quot;severe&quot; thunderstorm warning in place until 8am on Friday. They have also produced a map identifying exactly where is most at risk over the next 24 hours. A huge swathe of England, from the Midlands down to the south coast, is marked as having a &quot;60% risk&quot; of thunderstorms. An area centring around the West Midlands, Warwickshire, Gloucestershire, Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire is flagged as being particularly at risk of &quot;large hail&quot;. A huge swathe of England, from the Midlands down to the south coast, faces a &#039;60% risk&#039; on thunderstorms The Met Office expects Friday to be &quot;warm for most&quot; again, with advanced weather modelling maps showing highs of 28C in the south-east and east of England. Most of the rest of England could reach 21C to 25C, but temperatures look set to be a few notches cooler in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Met Office forecast for Friday states: &quot;Cloud and rain edging into the northwest where it will also be rather breezy. Mostly dry elsewhere with sunny spells, a few heavy showers in the east. Warm for most.&quot;",

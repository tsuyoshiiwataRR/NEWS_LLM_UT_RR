    "text": "MIAMI - Another heat advisory was issued Friday for Miami-Dade, Broward, and the Keys as \"feels like\" temperatures are forecast to be in the triple digits.\nAfternoon temperatures will be in the low 90s. But, combined with the humidity, the heat indices could reach up to 110 degrees.\nThe heat advisory runs from 10 a.m. through 7 p.m.\nA heat advisory is issued by the National Weather Service when a heat index of 105 degrees or higher is expected for at least two hours in Miami-Dade. An advisory is issued for Broward and the Keys when a heat index of 107 degrees is expected for at least two hours.\nPeople are urged to drink plenty of fluids, but avoid those that contain caffeine, high sugar content, and alcohol. Stay in an air-conditioned room, limit the time you work or spend outdoors during the hottest part of the day, and check up on relatives and neighbors.\nWear clothing that is lightweight, light-colored, and loose-fitting. If you're outside wear a hat and sunscreen to protect your face and scalp from harmful UV rays.\nIf you must be outdoors, slow down, take breaks in a shaded or cool area, and drink cool fluids every hour.\nIf you feel lightheaded, confused, weak, or faint, seek medical attention immediately by calling 911.\nFor dog owners wanting to take their four-legged friends for a walk, it's important to remember the seven-second rule. Place your hand on the concrete for seven seconds. If it's too hot for you, it's too hot for your pet.\nMore from CBS News Drier conditions across South Florida, triple digit \"feels like\" heat A few morning showers across South Florida, afternoon will be drier and hot Tropical disturbance will bring squally, wet weather to South Florida Sandbags distributed ahead of weather that could affect South Florida In: Fort Lauderdale Miami John MacLauchlan John MacLauchlan is a digital content producer for CBS Miami.

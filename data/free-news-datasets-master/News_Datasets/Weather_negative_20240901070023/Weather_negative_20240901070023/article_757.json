    "text": "This exceeds the long-term average of 15.5 tropical nights for the entire summer months of June, July and August, as UBIMET reports.\nThe persistent heat, even at night, is hardly surprising in the city center and can be explained by the dense development and the high proportion of asphalt and concrete, which store heat instead of reflecting it. The measuring station on the Hohe Warte also recorded 13 tropical nights in July in which there was hardly any cooling, which leads to unpleasant, sweaty nights.\nIn Vienna-Döbling, Eisenstadt and St. Pölten, new records were set for tropical nights, with night temperatures not falling below 20 degrees Celsius. The highest temperature was measured on July 10 in Andau at 36.3 degrees.\nStrong increase\nThe trend is clear: the number of tropical nights in Vienna has increased significantly in recent decades. In the 1970s there were about three tropical nights per year, in the 2000s there were already ten to 15, and since the 2010s there have been about 15 to 20 per year. This increase is continuing. Temperatures will temporarily drop slightly, but will remain summery, and the next warming is expected as early as Sunday.",

    "text": "Stream FOX 35 News ORLANDO, Fla. - According to the National Hurricane Center, almost all of Florida could be affected by a tropical system that is expected to develop into a stronger storm within the next week. In response, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in dozens of counties that could be impacted. According to the hurricane center, this tropical system was expected to impact the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Florida. State officials were advising residents to complete storm preparations now. While this storm may not become a major hurricane, there is growing concern that it may hand over Florida for several days, producing heavy rain and the potential for damaging floods. In a post on X, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis asked residents to follow guidance from the Division of Emergency Management and local officials. Gov. DeSantis declared a state of emergency on Thursday ahead of this tropical system in the following counties: Alachua , Baker, Bay, Bradford, Brevard , Calhoun, Charlotte, Citrus, Clay, Collier, Columbia, DeSoto, Dixie, Duval, Escambia, Flagler , Franklin, Gadsden, Gilchrist , Glades, Gulf, Hamilton, Hardee, Hendry, Hernando, Highlands, Hillsborough, Holmes, Jackson, Jefferson, Lafayette, Lake , Lee, Leon, Levy , Liberty, Madison, Manatee, Marion , Monroe, Nassau, Okaloosa, Okeechobee, Orange , Osceola , Pasco, Pinellas, Polk , Putnam, Santa Rosa, Sarasota, Seminole , St. Johns, Sumter , Suwannee, Taylor, Union, Volusia , Wakulla, Walton, and Washington counties. Meteorologists have urged people along the U.S. Gulf Coast and Atlantic Coast to monitor the system.

Details regarding potential further strengthening, specific tracks, any stall, and the highest impact area remain unclear. That said, it appears Sunday, Monday, and next Tuesday are the main timeframe for direct tropical impacts to Florida.\" If the system becomes a named storm, it will be \"Debby.\" Now is a good time to review your hurricane supply checklist. You can find this here . What does a statement of emergency mean? What does it do? Florida has declared a state of emergency in anticipation of a tropical system this weekend, which could cause flooding. This is not a forecast for county impacts from Invest97L (future \"Debby\") but an ability to free up funding in these areas to reduce red tape for preparation if itâ€™s ultimately needed. \"Based on meteorological reports, there is a significant threat of heavy rainfall over most of the State of Florida, with the possibility of at least 12 inches of rainfall over the next seven days,\" reads the Thursday evening executive order. \"The water tables in the affected areas are already nearing peak capacity, and incoming heavy rainfall will cause significant river flooding that may last for several weeks.\" More resources can be found here and on the FLJHSMV website .",

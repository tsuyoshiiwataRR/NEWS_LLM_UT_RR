    "text": "Kochi: Heavy showers lashed the city on Thursday (August 1), causing a brief waterlogging situation in several places. Many areas, including MG Road, Pallimukku, and Shenoy's Junction, were inundated by the rain. However, the rain subsided in the city during the late afternoon. In view of the brief rainfall yesterday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has not issued any alerts for Friday (August 2) as of yet. KS Dileep Kumar, president of Ernakulam Vikasna Samithi, an NGO, said that the rain subsided after almost an hour yesterday. He added that the brief rainfall helped in avoiding flooding in Kochi. However, many places in the city, especially MG Road, faced moderate waterlogging, according to a TOI report. The weather conditions today are predicted to include a cloudy sky with one or two spells of rain or thundershowers. The maximum temperature is expected to be 30 degrees Celsius, and the minimum temperature may likely be 25 degrees Celsius. In the last 24 hours, the recorded rainfall was 11mm, and the relative humidity fluctuated between 87 percent and 89 percent. Kochi Weekly Weather ForecastThe city is expected to witness a week-long rainfall with temperatures remaining constant throughout the week. From August 2 to August 7, the maximum temperature will be 30 degrees Celsius, and the minimum will be 25 degrees Celsius. On August 2, 3, 4, and 5, the weather condition in Kochi is expected to include a cloudy sky with one or two spells of rain or thundershowers.

From a report: While temperatures remain below zero on the polar land mass, which is shrouded in darkness at this time of year, the depths of southern hemisphere winter, temperatures have reportedly reached 28C above expectations on some days. The globe has experienced 12 months of record warmth, with temperatures consistently exceeding the 1.5C rise above preindustrial levels that has been touted as the limit to avoiding the worst of climate breakdown. Michael Dukes, the director of forecasting at MetDesk, said that while individual daily high temperatures were surprising, far more significant was the average rise over the month. Climate scientists' models have long predicted that the most significant effects of anthropogenic climate change would be on polar regions, \"and this is a great example of that,\" he said. \"Usually you can't just look at one month for a climate trend but it is right in line with what models predict,\" Dukes added. \"In Antarctica generally that kind of warming in the winter and continuing in to summer months can lead to collapsing of the ice sheets.\"",

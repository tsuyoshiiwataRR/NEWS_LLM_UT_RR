    "text": "**HEAT ADVISORY FROM 11AM TO 7PM FRIDAY** ** LEVEL 1/5 RISK FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS TODAY** Morning temperatures are sitting near 80s degrees today with mostly sunny, yet hazy skies thanks to the influx of the Saharan Air Layer. By this afternoon we will have not only a Heat Advisory in effect but also a risk for severe weather. Yet again, our high temperatures today will feel like close to 110 degrees. As it has been all week, wearing light colored, loose fitting clothing, hydrating, and taking breaks in doors will be key to avoiding heat related illnesses. Starting around lunchtime a line of showers and storms will develop and travel south and east throughout the late afternoon. A cold front, the main forcing behind our severe weather risk today, will move into the area around 4/5 pm and travel south and east bringing scattered storms with the potential to turn severe during dinnertime and lasting into the bedtime hours. The greatest threats with this line are gusty winds, torrential rain, ponding on roads, and plenty of flashes of lightning. Our risk is a level 1/5. We will see just slightly cooler temperatures this weekend with barely lower humidity meaning that the general hot, humid, and hazy forecast continues. We will stay dry from rain throughout the weekend with high temperatures in the low 90s, feeling like the 100s. FRIDAY: Sunny, hazy AM. Heat Advisory and possible severe storms by afternoon. Highs feeling like up to 109. Wind: WSW 5-10 mph. TONIGHT: Scattered rain and clouds. Lows in the low 70s. Wind: N 5 mph.",

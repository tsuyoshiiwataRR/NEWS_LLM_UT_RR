    "text": "The Coronavirus Pandemic and learning loss is a topic often discussed, and one still impacting many students. One group of children still dealing with those difficulties are the ones who were not yet in school when the pandemic began. \"He mostly just struggles in most of the aspects,\" said Victoria, a mom of three. \"He’s just a little bit behind.” Victoria is talking about one of her sons, who was too young for school at the start of the pandemic. \"He actually didn’t go through a full year of school until second grade,\" Victoria said. \"It’s been rough but he’s finally catching up but there’s still a lot of catchup that I’ve noticed.” \"If you think about it, they didn’t see the facial expressions that we learned by,\" said Jan Wilson, a grandparent. \"They were missing all of that, and I think every grandchild was affected by that.\" Pre-K to first graders in 2020 may have missed a critical window during which foundational skills develop, according to recent research from Curriculum Associates . \"They should’ve been picking up words, sounds, and reading books and reading with another adult to understand books,\" said Georgetown ISD Superintendent Dr. Devin Padavil. \"It was during the pandemic when everyone was wearing masks.\" This can lead to compounded gaps in learning over time. \"We have a lot of kids that are still behind on fundamental reading skills that we are working hard to catch up on,\" Dr. Padavil stated. \"Coming out of COVID we saw the dip,\" said San Marcos CISD Superintendent Dr. Michael Cardona. \"We knew the dip was gonna come back. COVID really took us for a loop.” ALSO| UT faculty report criticizes handling of pro-Palestine protests on campus From San Marcos CISD to Georgetown ISD, school districts we spoke with agree: that learning loss from the COVID-19 pandemic might still be around, but they have seen an increase in students’ abilities to learn at pre-pandemic levels. \"We have a lot of glimmers of hope and optimism when it comes to student learning,\" said Dr. Padavil. Research shows school and life after school get harder if a student cannot read on grade level by the third grade, according to Dr. Padavil. He said Georgetown ISD is focused on improving elementary literacy. \"We have a priority to see every student read and write on grade level because we know that strong readers and writers succeed in all of their other classes,\" said Dr. Padavil. Over at San Marcos CISD, Dr. Cardona said progress was made last year. \"The state went down in many areas, but we went up,\" he said. \"It kind of highlights the work teachers are doing, but we have a lot of work to do still.”",

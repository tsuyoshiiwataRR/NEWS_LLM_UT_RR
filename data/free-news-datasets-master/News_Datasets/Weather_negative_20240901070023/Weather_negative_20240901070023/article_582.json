    "text": "FIRST ALERT: Brutal heat and daily storm chances continue MYRTLE BEACH, SC (WMBF) - Dangerous heat and humidity will continue today and into Saturday with increasing storm chances through the weekend. HEAT ADVISORY A HEAT ADVISORY is in effect for the entire area from 11:00 AM through 8:00 PM on Friday. The combination of temperatures in the 90s and very high humidity will push the heat index to 105 to 110 from midday into the early evening. To stay safe during excessive heat, drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location. TODAY The heat and humidity will push temperatures into the low-mid 90s again this afternoon with the heat index reaching 105-110. We’ll keep the risk of a few storms around this afternoon, mainly scattered in nature. If you have afternoon plans, make sure to stay updated with us on the First Alert Weather App! We’ll send you a push alert to your phone when storms are starting to fire up this afternoon. Similar to yesterday, storm chances will be at 30%. INTO THE WEEKEND This weekend will be a hot and humid one with the chance of afternoon showers and storms. The heat index will climb to near 110° in some spots Saturday afternoon. We’ll keep the scattered showers and storms around Saturday and Sunday afternoon with a 40% chance of rain for any outdoor plans. As we head into Sunday, temperatures will ease back just a tad, allowing highs to be a few degrees cooler. The heat index will still be noticeable, reaching 100-105 Sunday afternoon. NEXT WEEK Our forecast next week will be dependent on the tropics and that chance of development. The track of this tropics development could increase our rain chances by mid-week. For now, we continue to watch and wait with a few scattered showers and storms in the forecast. Of course, we will tweak the forecast as needed and let you know of those changes over the weekend. Enjoy your weekend and let us focus on the tropics for you. Copyright 2024 WMBF. All rights reserved.",

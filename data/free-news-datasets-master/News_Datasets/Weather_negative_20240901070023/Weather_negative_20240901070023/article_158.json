    "text": "Jaipur: Heavy rains brought a plethora of problems for commuters who faced lack of public transport, while cabs and auto drivers, taking advantage of the situation, tried to fleece them.Fares on app cabs were almost twice to thrice the normal rates, and auto drivers also started asking for hefty fares from commuters. Passengers arriving or heading towards the railway station and city airport were among the worst hit.“From city airport to Calgiri Marg, the fare on Thursday morning was showing around Rs 350 on different app cab platforms. On normal days, it hardly costs Rs 150. The worst thing was I had to wait for around 25 minutes outside the airport terminal even after agreeing to pay such an exorbitant fare,” said Amit Prasad Sanghvi, a Malviya Nagar resident, who arrived from Mumbai on Thursday morning.App cab drivers claimed mainly two reasons prompted companies to increase fares on Thursday. First, because of incessant rainfall, there were no bike services available. Second, the demand increased owing to huge traffic congestion on city roads.“On Thursday, it was taking at least 30 to 45 minutes more to drop a passenger than on normal days. This further increased the demand, and the app cab services took the opportunity to increase the fare,” said Ramchandra Meena, an app cab driver.Charanjeet Pal Singh, a student from Hanumangarh, said he had a tough time reaching his Malviya Nagar accommodation from his coaching centre on Gopalpura Bypass road. “No bikes were available on app cabs. Fares for cabs were extremely high. Even auto rickshaws were charging almost twice,” he said. We recentlyYatri Sathi AC cabs from airport to cost 70 more from today in KolkataFrom Friday, passengers booking AC Yatri Sathi cabs at Kolkata's airport would pay an additional Rs 70 per trip as parking fees are now being charged. A recent meeting between the airport authorities and involved parties prompted this change. Non-AC yellow cabs under Yatri Sathi remain unaffected by these new charges.112205479Gadkari intervenes to enable smooth cab service at rly stnPrisha Tours & Travels in Nagpur, despite securing a contract to operate cabs from Nagpur railway station, faced numerous challenges including inadequate support from authorities and competition from unauthorized operators.

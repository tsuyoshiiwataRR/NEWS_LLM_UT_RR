    "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Thousands of people are without power after thunderstorms swept through the Louisville-area Thursday evening. Around 5:30 p.m. there were more than 15,000 Louisville residents without power. There's also been reports of downed trees in the area. ⛈️We are at the intersection of Breckinridge Lane and Grandview Avenue. The storm pushed a large tree onto a truck just feet away from the St. Matthew Police Department. More coverage with— Molly Jett (@MolJett) [@MarcWeinbergWX]& [@ThomasJGleaton]on [@WDRBNews]⛈️ [pic.twitter.com/pIH1sHkQao] [August 1, 2024] By 6 p.m. there were more than 13,000 in Jefferson County without power. In Oldham and Bullitt counties the combined power outage was nearly 4,000 customers. It's unknown how long it'll take for all power in Jefferson County to be restored. The Savannah Bananas game at Louisville Slugger Field is still scheduled for 7 p.m. but it's possible it could start slightly late. Copyright 2024 WDRB Media. All Rights Reserved.",

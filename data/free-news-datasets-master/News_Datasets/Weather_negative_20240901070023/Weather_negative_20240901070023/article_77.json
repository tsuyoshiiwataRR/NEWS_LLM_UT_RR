    "text": "The News 19 Weather Team has issued a Weather Impact Alert Day for Friday, as we could see another day of potentially dangerous heat levels. A heat advisory was issued Thursday as heat index values, or \"feels like temperatures,\" stayed in the triple digits. The chance for dangerous heat index values will return for Friday. High temperatures combined with high dew points could lead to heat index values reaching near 110 degrees Friday. Another heat advisory could be issued by the National Weather Service for the Midlands. The chance for isolated afternoon showers and storms stays lower for Friday. Any storms that do develop on Friday could be strong to severe, with the potential for damaging winds. Storm chances are expected to increase over the weekend. On both Saturday and Sunday, storms are more likely and could be more scattered. Heat Safety Tips - Stay Hydrated and Cool: Drink plenty of fluids and stay in an air-conditioned room. Avoid being outside in the sun for extended periods. Check on relatives and neighbors to ensure they are safe and comfortable. - Protect Children and Pets: Never leave young children or pets in unattended vehicles. Car interiors can reach deadly temperatures within minutes. - Outdoor Precautions: When outside, wear lightweight and loose-fitting clothing. Try to limit strenuous activities to the early morning or evening. Be alert to signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke, and act immediately if symptoms appear. - Workplace Safety: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) advises taking frequent rest breaks in shaded or air-conditioned areas during outdoor work. If the heat has affected someone you are around, move them quickly to a cool, shaded area. A heat stroke is a medical emergency; call 911 immediately.",

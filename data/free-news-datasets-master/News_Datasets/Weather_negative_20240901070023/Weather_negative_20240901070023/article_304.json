    "text": "Bengaluru: ‘India’s Silicon Valley’ is experiencing a 17 pc deficit in rainfall, contrasting sharply with the overall surplus of 81 pc seen across Karnataka. While some districts in the state are grappling with erratic rainfall, rivers in flood, and reservoirs nearing full capacity, Bengaluru's situation remains troubling. Driest July in Five Years July 2024 has been reported as the driest July in the last five years for Bengaluru. The city had an average rainfall expectation of 94 mm but only received 78 mm, marking a significant shortfall, as per a report by Bangalore Mirror. This comes after a substantial increase in June, where Bengaluru saw 138 mm of rainfall against an average of 71 mm, resulting in a 93 pc surplus for that month. However, the July shortfall has affected the overall rainfall totals for the city. From June 1 to the end of July, Bengaluru received a total of 235 mm, which is 39 pc above the expected 169 mm, mainly due to June's performance. Whereas, Karnataka's Rainfall Performance In June, Karnataka experienced a 17 pc rainfall deficit, receiving 572 mm against an average of 691 mm. However, in July, the state recorded an impressive 81 pc excess, with 1,798 mm of rainfall against an average of 993 mm. For the first two months of the monsoon, Karnataka's average rainfall was 1,715 mm, but it received 2,452 mm, resulting in a 43 pc surplus. Several other areas also reported significant rainfall deficits, including Bengaluru Rural (34 pc), Kolar (49 pc), Chikkaballapur (43 pc), Koppal (28 pc), Raichur (29 pc), Yadgir (32 pc), and Vijayapura (30 pc).

On Wednesday night, the reservoir received an inflow of 154,460 cusecs of water, while 172,161 cusecs were released. This marks the highest outflow recorded in the last 25 years, surpassing the previous record of 211,736 cusecs in 1991. For comparison, the outflow was 140,910 cusecs in 2018 and 153,719 cusecs in 2019.

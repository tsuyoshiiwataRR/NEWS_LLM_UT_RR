CINCINNATI (WKRC) - It's deja vu with more extreme humidity and scattered storms in the forecast on Thursday. Some storms may be strong to severe with heavy rainfall and gusty winds especially late in the afternoon into the evening. Greater Cincinnati is in a \"Slight\" or level 2 out of 5 severe weather risk. Storms with damaging winds, large hail, heavy rain & frequent lightning are possible. Isolated, spin-up tornadoes are smaller threats. A Severe Thunderstorm WATCH has been issued for parts of the Tri-State until 8 p.m. More scattered storms are coming Friday with a \"Marginal\" or level 1 out of 5 risk. There may also be a few showers and storms around on Saturday. It's expected to be fully dry going into Sunday but the heat and humidity continue. Expect highs in the upper-80s to near 90. Next week gets off to a quiet and warm start with temperatures approaching 90 each day.",

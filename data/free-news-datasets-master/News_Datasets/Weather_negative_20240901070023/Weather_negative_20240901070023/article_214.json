    "text": "P.M. storms for Friday and then disruptive weather for weekend Heavy rain possible as tropical system moves in SARASOTA, Fla. (WWSB) - Friday’s forecast looks like more of the same, as afternoon showers and storms will pop up across the area. Light winds will keep storms from moving much, so isolated flooding is possible in some areas. The advice remains the same as always: when thunder roars, stay indoors. Chance of rain is 60%. On Thursday, a heat advisory was in effect for our area, and it’s possible we have one again tomorrow. High temperatures will be in the low 90s, but dew points could reach close to 80 degrees, and that extra humidity will bring the heat index as high as 108 in some places. Regardless of whether we have a heat advisory again tomorrow, if you’ll be spending time outside, help your body fight the heat by drinking lots of water and finding shade. Boaters will see a southeast wind at 5 to 10 knots turning to the west as the sea breeze develops in the afternoon. Seas will be less than 2 feet, with a light chop. This weekend, the forecast becomes entirely dependent on the development of a large tropical wave that is currently making its way through Hispaniola and Cuba. Models disagree on where exactly a low pressure center will develop, but it appears likely that a tropical depression or storm will form in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on Sunday or Monday. However, we will already start to see some impacts on Saturday. The wave will still be to our south, but its associated tropical moisture will be pulled northward into our area, helping to create more widespread showers and storms Saturday afternoon and evening. 70% chance of rain, and high temperatures around 90. We do not currently expect this to be a strong wind system as it passes just off our coast, but it does have the potential to bring a lot of rain. Sunday and Monday are both First Alert Weather Days as the system makes its closest approach to our area. Chance of rain is near 100% on Sunday, and that rain will continue into early next week. For a more detailed tropical forecast, visit the ‘Hurricane’ tab on our website. The ABC7 First Alert Weather team will continue to bring you updates on this system as it approaches.

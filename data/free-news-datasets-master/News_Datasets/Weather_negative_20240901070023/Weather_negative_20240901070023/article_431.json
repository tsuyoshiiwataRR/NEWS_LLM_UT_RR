    "text": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — We know Arizona is hot in the summer, but recent summers have been hotter than normal. Phoenix is on pace to set a record for the hottest summer on record. The record high was set in 2023 , when the combined average of low and high temperatures in the summer of last year was 96.2 degrees. So far this summer, Phoenix is about three degrees warmer on average, at 99.1 degrees. July 2024 was the second hottest on record , with the average high just above 112 degrees. The average daily high is about 107. The only month of July hotter in Phoenix, was last summer. “It’s a big problem mainly because there is no relief,” Climate Central meteorologist Shel Winkley said. “What we’ve seen is summer after summer recently is that this is the new summer we are living in. You have to find ways to mitigate that.” Our averages are based on 120+ years of data. Winkley says it may be beneficial to update the numbers with more recent data to understand our new normal. “These temperatures are breaking records more and more and are above-average more and more,” Winkley said. “The average hasn’t actually caught up yet because 30 years ago wasn’t anywhere near as hot as it has been for, say, past five or 10 years.” Winkley says we may not break records every summer, but the intense heat is happening more often and staying longer. He says it’s important to find ways to mitigate the heat by adding plants that can create shade and absorb some of the heat instead of reflecting it, like the concrete of buildings and roads.

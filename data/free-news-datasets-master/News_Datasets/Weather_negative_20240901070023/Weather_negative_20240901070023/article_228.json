A heat advisory will be in effect from 10 a.m. Thursday through 8 p.m. Friday, with heat index values between 98 and 103 degrees expected. The Philadelphia region is facing another summer heat wave. A heat advisory will be in effect from 10 a.m. Thursday through 8 p.m. Friday, with heat index values between 98 and 103 degrees expected. Hot temperatures and high humidity may cause heat illnesses, the National Weather Service said. Philly, suburbs under Code Orange due to poor air qualityPennsylvania officials on Wednesday declared a Code Orange Air Quality Action Day for Ozone for the Philly region on Thursday. That includes Philadelphia, Bucks, Chester and Delaware counties. The state Department of Environmental Protection cited mostly sunny skies, high temperatures in the mid- to upper-90s and light southwest winds as likely contributors to 8-hour average concentrations of ground-level ozone in the Code Orange range. Ozone is formed from burning fossil fuels. Cars, trucks, power plants and industrial facilities contribute nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds which, when combined with sunlight, create smog, also known as ground-level ozone. Under a Code Orange, air pollution concentrations may be unhealthy for vulnerable groups such as children, people with asthma, people with heart or lung disease and older adults. Residents and businesses are also encouraged to reduce ozone air pollution by driving less, limiting engine idling and conserving electricity by setting air conditioning to a higher temperature and turning off lights not in use.

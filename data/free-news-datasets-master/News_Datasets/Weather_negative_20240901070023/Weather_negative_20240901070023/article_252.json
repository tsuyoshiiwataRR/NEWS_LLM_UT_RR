Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing. Try to limit strenuous activities to early morning or evening. Take action when you see symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.

Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has issued an Air Pollution Advisory...in effect until noon PDT Friday. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality issued an air quality advisory for Jackson, Klamath and Lake counties due to numerous wildfires burning in the region. DEQ also expects intermittent smoke in Eastern Douglas and Josephine counties through at least Friday due to smoke from surrounding fires. The wildfire smoke combined with forecast conditions will cause air quality levels to fluctuate and could be at unhealthy levels. Smoke levels can change rapidly depending on the weather and planned burn operations. Smoke can irritate the eyes and lungs and worsen some medical conditions. People most at risk include infants and young children, people with heart or lung disease, older adults and pregnant people. People can take the following precautions to protect their health: - Follow local burn restrictions to prevent deteriorating air quality. - Avoid strenuous outdoor activity during periods of poor air quality. - People with heart or lung problems and young children are especially vulnerable. These people should stay indoors while smoke levels are high. - Use certified High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters in indoor heating, ventilation, cooling and air purification systems. - Avoid using wood-burning stoves and other sources of indoor smoke if possible.

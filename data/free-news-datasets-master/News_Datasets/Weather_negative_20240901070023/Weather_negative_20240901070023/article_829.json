    "text": "The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for parts of Florida as it began advisories Friday on what it’s now calling Potential Tropical Cyclone Four.As of 5 p.m., the center of the broad system that has been forming from a vast tropical wave is located about 25 miles west of Camaguey, Cuba and 315 miles southeast of Key West with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph as it moves west-northwest at 16 mph.\nA tropical storm warning is now in effect for the southwest coast of the Florida peninsula from East Cape Sable north to Boca Grande and a tropical storm watch in effect for the Florida Keys south of the Card Sound Bridge that connects Miami-Dade to Key Largo down to Key West including the Dry Tortugas, as well as the southern coast of the Florida peninsula east of East Cape Sable to the Card Sound bridge, and for the west coast of the Florida peninsula north of Boca Grande to the mouth of the Suwannee River.\nA storm surge watch has been issued for the west coast of the Florida peninsula from Bonita Beach north to the mouth of the Suwannee River, including Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor.\nHow tropical system could impact Florida this weekend\n“A turn toward the northwest at a slower forward speed is expected tonight or Saturday, followed by a turn toward the north on Sunday,” NHC senior hurricane specialist Jack Beven said. “On the forecast track, the disturbance is expected to move over Cuba tonight, cross the Straits of Florida into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Saturday, and then move near or over the west coast of Florida Saturday night through Sunday night.”\nThe NHC still gives the system a 80% chance of development in the next two days and 90% chance in the next seven.\nThe intensity is expected to increase into a tropical depression by Saturday and then into what could become Tropical Storm Debby by Saturday night after it moves across the Straits of Florida into the Gulf of Mexico. The forecast cone has it making landfall north of Tampa on Sunday night or early Monday with winds shy of hurricane strength, but still 65 mph sustained winds and gusts of 75 mph.\n11am EDT August 2nd: Here are the initial key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone Four ( #PTC4 ).\nTropical Storm Watches and Warnings have been issued for the Florida Keys and portions of the west coast of the Florida Peninsula. https://t.co/it6IRLenVu pic.twitter.com/zkvTeNe2MH\n— National Hurricane Center (@NHC_Atlantic) August 2, 2024\n“Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area late Saturday and Saturday night,” Beven said. “Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in the Florida Keys and the southern Florida peninsula by Saturday or Saturday night. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area along the Florida west coast Saturday night or Sunday.”\nIn addition, storm surge is forecast to be as high as 3 feet from Aripeka to the Card Sound Bridge, Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, depending on high tide.\nThe NHC expects rainfall from 4 to 8 inches with some areas getting up to 12 inches across portions of Florida and the Southeast U.S. this weekend and through Wednesday morning that could cause flash and urban flooding as well as some isolated river flooding.\nFor now, the system is a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms across Hispaniola, the southeastern Bahamas and eastern Cuba as well as the adjacent waters of the southwestern Atlantic.\nThe NHC’s official path is fed by several weather models that have the path steering it up Florida’s west coast and moving inland.\nWeather forecast tracks as of Friday afternoon for Invest 97L that is forecast to become a tropical depression and possibly Tropical Storm Debby. (OrlandoSentinel.com/hurricane) Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared most Florida counties under a state of emergency around 5 p.m. Wednesday. Floods could ensue if the system continued its current slow course or even stalled over the Florida peninsula.\nThe Florida Department of Emergency Management has activated the State Emergency Operations Center while the Florida National Guard has around 3,000 service members readying for response efforts, the governor’s office stated in an email.\nIn addition, 70 members of the Florida State Guard along with nine shallow water vessels, 10 UTVs and two amphibious rescue vehicles have been staged for deployment. Seven search and rescue crews are prepared to deploy from Camp Blanding. Also, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has readied high-water vehicles and all other storm response resources statewide.\n“Regardless of development, heavy rains could cause areas of flash flooding across Florida, Cuba, and the Bahamas through the weekend, and interests in these locations should continue to monitor the progress of this system,” Beven said. “A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate this system later today, if necessary.”\nThis infrared radar image shows rainfall from Potential Tropical Cyclone Four approaching the Florida Straits on Friday, Aug. 2, 2024. (NOAA/GOES-East) The tropical wave stretches over hundreds of miles from the Caribbean Sea all the way north to the central Bahamas in the Atlantic. It’s moving west around 20 mph and the northern end has seen wave heights up to 7 feet on Friday.\nFor Central Florida, the National Weather Service in Melbourne forecasts 2-4 inches of rain in some areas with 4-6 inches north of Interstate 4 over the weekend.\nTropical-storm-force winds and possible tornadoes are possible on Sunday into the overnight as the system moves through the region.\nBoscile Davis, 70, fills up sandbags at Sanford Public Works on Friday, August 2, 2024. Davis, who lives in the Bookertown neighborhood of Sanford, is taking precautions a as a tropical storm warning was issued for parts of Florida. (Rich Pope, Orlando Sentinel) Several locations around Orange, Lake, Seminole and Volusia counties began providing sandbag supplies. The region suffered serious flooding during Hurricane Ian in 2022.\nFarther south, according to NWS Miami, some areas over the weekend could see up from 4-8 inches of rain starting Saturday. Some areas could top 12 inches and a flood watch is in effect for South Florida.\n“Regardless of development, this will bring a surge of deep tropical moisture to the region which will result in the potential for excessive rainfall and localized flooding throughout the day on Saturday,” said NWS Miami Meteorologist Chuck Caracozza. “What still remains highly uncertain is the details of exactly where the heaviest rainfall will occur.”\nThe tropical action is the first tracked by the NHC since Hurricane Beryl moved through the Caribbean, Mexico and Texas in late June and early July.\nThree weeks of dry Saharan dust moving west off the African continent into the Atlantic has stymied development over the ocean, although water temperatures remain above normal.\nSo far the season has seen three named storms. It’s not forecast to intensify, but if this system got strong enough, it could become Tropical Storm Debby.\nHurricane season runs from June 1-Nov. 30, but the height of storm formation runs from mid-August into October.\nOriginally Published: August 2, 2024 at 8:13 a.m. Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window) Most Popular Most Popular Tropical storm warning issued for parts of Florida as system approaches Tropical storm warning issued for parts of Florida as system approaches Massive tropical wave to approach Florida, could form into depression, hurricane center says Massive tropical wave to approach Florida, could form into depression, hurricane center says How tropical system could impact Florida this weekend How tropical system could impact Florida this weekend FDA discovery might make you think twice about getting that tattoo FDA discovery might make you think twice about getting that tattoo Tropical storm likely to skirt Florida’s Gulf Coast but soak Orlando area Tropical storm likely to skirt Florida's Gulf Coast but soak Orlando area 10 Central Florida restaurants shut down last week amid health inspections 10 Central Florida restaurants shut down last week amid health inspections Former ballerina in Florida is convicted of manslaughter in her estranged husband’s 2020 shooting Former ballerina in Florida is convicted of manslaughter in her estranged husband’s 2020 shooting Florida homeowners become Slide customers — whether they want to or not | Commentary Florida homeowners become Slide customers — whether they want to or not | Commentary Norma Padgett, who falsely accused the Groveland Four of rape, dies at 92 Norma Padgett, who falsely accused the Groveland Four of rape, dies at 92 ‘An atrocious wrongdoing’: Seminole neighborhood floods regularly after homeowner plugs its only drainpipe 'An atrocious wrongdoing': Seminole neighborhood floods regularly after homeowner plugs its only drainpipe Trending Nationally Massive tropical wave to approach Florida, could form into depression, hurricane center says How to buy Disneyland lost and found items at ridiculously cheap prices Trump posts photo of Kamala Harris wearing Indian attire in new ‘she became Black’ smear COVID spreading quickly in San Diego County Gov.

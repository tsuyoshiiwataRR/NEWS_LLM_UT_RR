    "text": "SAN ANTONIO â€” The KENS 5 Weather Team has called for Weather Impact Alert Days on Friday and Saturday due to above-average temperatures and possible heat advisories in the San Antonio region. What you need to know: As the Saharan dust moves out, high pressure continues to dominate and hot, dry conditions remain in place. Temperatures will near triple-digits on Friday and breach 100 Saturday as an unusually cool July gives way to sweltering August conditions. Heat indices, or \"feels-like\" temperatures, will hover between 103 and 107 degrees. Though those temperatures could stay below heat advisory criteria, San Antonians should still be cautious if outside for prolonged periods of time. A Weather Impact Alert for Sunday also isn't out of the question. Residents should be extra careful when outside between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m., the hottest part of the day. Wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothes, and drink plenty of water. This is a developing weather event. Refresh the page for the latest updates.

    "text": "A report from the National Weather Service was issued on Friday at 3:46 a.m. for strong thunderstorms until 4:15 a.m. for Butler and Allegheny counties.\nResidents may experience wind gusts of up to 40 mph.\n\"At 3:45 a.m., Doppler radar tracked a strong thunderstorm over McCandless Township, moving northeast at 30 mph,\" according to the weather service. \"Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.\"\nLocations impacted by the alert include Ross Township, McCandless Township, Franklin Park, Shaler Township, Hampton Township, New Kensington, Harrison Township, Wexford, West View, Fox Chapel, Arnold, Tarentum, Brackenridge, Gibsonia, Oak Hills, Mars, Russellton, Nixon, Bradfordwoods and Curtisville. This includes the following highways: Pennsylvania Turnpike between mile markers 31 and 46. Interstate 79 in Pennsylvania between mile markers 74 and 75.\nThe weather service comments, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building. Torrential rainfall is also occurring with this storm and may lead to localized flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded roadways.\"\nWhen lightning looms: Expert safety tips for thunderstorms Each year, lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times, with the majority of these electrifying events occurring during the summer months. Unfortunately, lightning is responsible for claiming the lives of approximately 20 people annually, as reported by the weather service. The threat of lightning becomes more pronounced as thunderstorms draw nearer, peaking when the storm is directly overhead and gradually waning as it moves away.\nTo guarantee your safety in the midst of a thunderstorm, take into account the following recommendations:\nLightning safety plan:\nWhen venturing outdoors, it's vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning. Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby. Seek shelter promptly in a safe location, preferably indoors. Indoors safety measures:\nOnce you're indoors, avoid using corded phones, electrical devices, plumbing fixtures, and stay away from windows and doors. These precautions help reduce the risk of electrical surges, as lightning can follow conductive pathways. Wait for the all-clear:\nAfter the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. It's important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution. When indoor shelter isn't available:\nIf you find yourself outdoors with no access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:\nAvoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, which expose you to greater lightning risk. Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In wooded areas, stay close to lower stands of trees. If you're with a group, ensure individuals are spread out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people. Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If you have no alternative, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. It's crucial to note that a tent provides no protection against lightning. Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. While water and metal don't attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks. In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, vigilance and preparedness are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the chances of lightning-related accidents and prioritize your safety.\nDriving through downpours: Safety guidelines for wet roads When heavy rain sets in, the risk of flooding and hazardous driving conditions rises. Whether it's prolonged rainfall or rapid runoff, being prepared is essential. Here are some valuable safety tips from the weather service to ensure you stay safe in heavy rain:\nBeware of swollen waterways:\nIn heavy rain, refrain from parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a grave danger.\nMaintain safe driving distances:\nUse the two-second rule to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you and allow an extra two seconds in heavy rain.\nReduce speed and drive cautiously:\nIf it is raining and the roads are wet, slow down. Take your foot off the accelerator and let your speed drop gradually. Never use the brakes suddenly because this may cause the car to skid.\nChoose your lane wisely:\nStick to the middle lanes on multi-lane roads to minimize the risk of hydroplaning, as water tends to accumulate in outer lanes.\nPrioritize visibility\nTurn on your headlights and be careful of other vehicles to the rear and in blind spot areas as they are especially difficult to see through rain-spattered windows.\nWatch out for slippery roads:\nThe initial half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mixture of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\nLarge trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely.\nMind your windshield wipers:\nOverloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely limits your sight, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or protected spots.\nWhen stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.\nBy following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

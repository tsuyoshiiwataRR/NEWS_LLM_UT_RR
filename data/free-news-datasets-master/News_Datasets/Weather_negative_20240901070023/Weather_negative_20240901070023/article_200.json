    "text": "‘Although the month of July began with promising rainfall in Bengaluru, it turned out to be predominantly cloudy’ While some districts in Karnataka are experiencing erratic rainfall, with most rivers in flood and reservoirs nearing full capacity, Bengaluru is facing a contrasting situation with a significant In June, Bengaluru experienced a substantial increase in rainfall, receiving 138 mm against an average of 71 mm, marking a 93% surplus. However, this surplus was offset by the shortfall in July. Taking into account the cumulative rainfall from June 1 to the end of July, Bengaluru received 235 mm against an expected 169 mm, resulting in a 39% excess largely attributed to June’s rainfall, according to data from the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDC). Conversely, Karnataka’s overall performance was different. The state faced a 17% rainfall deficit in June, with 572 mm received compared to the average of 691 mm. However, in July, the state saw an 81% excess, with 1,798 mm recorded against an average of 993 mm. For the first two months of the monsoon, Karnataka’s average rainfall was 1,715 mm, but it received 2,452 mm, resulting in a 43% surplus. Apart from Bengaluru City, other areas that experienced a 34% rainfall deficit were Bengaluru Rural with 34%, Kolar with 49%, Chikkaballapur with 43%, Koppal with 28%, Raichur with 29%, Yadgir with 32%, and Vijayapura with a 30% shortage. According to the Bengaluru Weather on X portal, “Bengaluru experienced its driest July in five years. Although the month began with promising rainfall, it turned out to be predominantly cloudy. As we approach the break phase, steering winds are expected to drop below 20 knots, which could lead to significant rainfall or thunderstorms for Bengaluru by the second week of August.” 25-year record at KRS reservoir After 25 years, the KRS reservoir has set a new record for outflow. On Wednesday night, the KRS received an inflow of 1,54,460 cusecs of water, while 1,72,161 cusecs were released from the reservoir. This represents the highest outflow recorded in the past 25 years. The previous highest outflow was 2,11,736 cusecs in 1991. Since then, this has been the largest volume of water released from KRS. For comparison, in 2018, the outflow was 1,40,910 cusecs, and in 2019, it was 1,53,719 cusecs. Weather across Karnataka In Bengaluru, the weather will be generally cloudy, with light to moderate rain expected. The maximum and minimum temperatures are forecast to be around 27°C and 20°C, respectively, said Dr N Puviarasan, Scientist, India Meteorological Department (IMD). “The off-shore trough at mean sea level, stretching from South Gujarat to the Kerala coast, continues to persist. Strong wind convergence along Coastal Karnataka and the adjacent Western Ghats districts is expected to result in scattered heavy to very heavy rain and sustained wind speeds of 30–40 km per hour over Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Uttara Kannada districts. As a result, isolated heavy to very heavy rain and similar wind speeds are also likely for Shivamogga district. Belagavi, Chikkamagaluru, and Kodagu districts can anticipate isolated heavy rain and sustained wind speeds of 30–40 km/h. Light to moderate rain and sustained wind speeds of 30–40 km/h are expected across many other districts in interior Karnataka.”",

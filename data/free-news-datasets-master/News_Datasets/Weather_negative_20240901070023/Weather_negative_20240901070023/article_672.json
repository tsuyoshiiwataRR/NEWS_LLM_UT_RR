    "text": "Welcome to August, one of the most physically dreadful months in Tampa Bay. Hm? Hang on, someone is … Oh, it’s just September begging to be considered for the title. Hold on, September, we’ll get to you, stop being so fussy.\nHurricane season started on June 1, but our collective tropical depression doesn’t begin to spike until right about now . Increased storm activity and perpetual mental alarm coincide with the following: blazing heat and humidity; electric bills from the underworld; chafing thighs; uncontrollable frizz; embarrassing sweat rings on restaurant chairs; side-eye from pets; grass that grows a foot every three seconds; Google searches for “finger swollen cut wedding ring off how Florida.”\nTo shore up for the malaise of this month, fortify your home by securing key items:\nBottled water Experts suggest storing at least 1 gallon of water per person per day for a minimum of three days. However, please consider adding extra bottles* should the need arise to create a Luddite bowling alley for mental stimulation when the power, internet and cable go out.\n*Do not hoard water. This is irresponsible. Everyone knows the best way to construct an at-home bowling alley is with White Claw empties and a rat king of socks with no partners.\nAn inflatable pool To fill with ice for the White Claws.\nAntacids To better stomach the phrase, “ Florida should monitor the progress of the system ” between now and the end of November. To soothe the nausea that comes from both spaghetti models and cans of nonperishable cold SpaghettiOs. To pop like candy as the city’s storm drain truck inches down the street, driver eyeing the surrounding infrastructure with his teeth clenched.\nBatteries We need batteries to power our flashlights, camping lanterns, portable fans, radios, tools and talking bobbleheads of 18th-century German intellectual Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a must for every hurricane kit. He repeats the phrase, “In the realm of ideas, everything depends on enthusiasm; in the real world, all rests on perseverance” as we pop antacids and read how destructive even a Category 1 can be.\nBlack clothing All heather gray must be sealed under lock and key until December by order of the king.\nA scarf No, not for warmth, silly. For going full Grey Gardens. Wrap it around your head and gently pull back the edge of the curtain. Stare dramatically into the outdoors while whispering, “I remember what it used to be like out there. It used to be good, that Florida.” Mutter something about longing to return to the salad days of April. Close the curtain. Slink back into the darkness.\nBut, really On a serious note, this weekend’s blob of tropical weather is a perfect reminder to restock hurricane supplies before it’s too late. Use our handy checklist , full of smart suggestions for customized kits based on your personal kid-pet-living situations. And check out my free email newsletter Monday, where I’m dishing on my latest money-saving grocery obsession. Because, in the words of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, toilet paper isn’t free.\nSpend your days with Hayes Subscribe to our free Stephinitely newsletter\nColumnist Stephanie Hayes will share thoughts, feelings and funny business with you every Monday.

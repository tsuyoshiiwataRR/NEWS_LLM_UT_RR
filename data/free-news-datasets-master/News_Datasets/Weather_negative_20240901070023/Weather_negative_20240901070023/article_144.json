    "text": "Pune: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted below-normal rainfall for a significant portion of Maharashtra in Aug 2024.The prediction came as part of IMD’s probability forecast for the second half of the 2024 monsoon season. According to its rainfall probability map for Aug 2024, many areas in southern parts of central India, including parts of Maharashtra, are likely to receive below-normal rainfall this month.112209017 This is in contrast to the overall prediction for the country, which suggests normal rainfall (94-106% of the Long Period Average) for Aug.However, the forecast has shown the highest probability of above-normal rainfall in Maharashtra if both Aug and Sept are taken into consideration. This could mean that Maharashtra is likely to see higher than normal Sept rainfall, which could compensate for Aug deficits.Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general of meteorology at IMD, said, “Weak La Niña conditions may develop around end of Aug and will continue till early winter next year. This is partly why rainfall is expected to be above normal in the second half of the season (Aug-Sept).”Mohapatra added, “However, the forecast for just the month of Aug indicates below- normal rainfall in many areas in southern parts of central India, like parts of Maharashtra and adjoining northern peninsular India, northeast and adjoining areas of east India, some parts of northwest and south peninsular India — though the country as a whole could get normal rainfall this month.”He said, “The Long Period Average (LPA) of rainfall during Aug to Sept for India is 422.8mm, based on the period from 1971 to 2020. We expect normal to above-normal rainfall across most parts of the country, including Maharashtra, during this period.”Addressing the possibility of a monsoon break in Aug, Mohapatra explained, “A break in monsoon typically occurs mid-month, around Aug 10-20. It’s a climatological phenomenon. Our extended range forecast indicates maximum rainfall activity in the first week of Aug, followed by a decrease in the second week and a further reduction in the third week. Based on climatology, we anticipate a potential monsoon break any time after Aug 8. This could contribute to below-normal rainfall in few parts of India, including Maharashtra, this month.”He also said, “The forecast suggests below-normal rainfall in northern parts of Maharashtra, such as Vidarbha and adjoining areas. Compared to the heavy rainfall experienced in July, Aug may see relatively less precipitation across the state.”We also published the following articles recentlyIndia to record above-normal rainfall in August and September: IMDThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted above-average rainfall for August and September, with possible La Nina conditions. Rainfall is expected to be 106 percent of the long-period average, attributed to a wetter July. Most regions will receive normal to above-normal rainfall, except parts of the northeast, east India, and some areas in central and peninsular India.112190376Goa tops average seasonal rainfall in just two monthsGoa experienced a vigorous monsoon in 2024, surpassing its average seasonal rainfall with 3,091mm by August 1, showing a 107% increase over the historical mean. Heavy rains led to significant rainfall readings, prompting a red alert. Notably, Quepem recorded 200mm, Valpoi 175mm, and Sanguem 167mm of rainfall in the past 24 hours.112205515Delhi wakes up to heavy rainfall, IMD predicts more showers aheadDelhi experienced heavy rain and thunderstorms early Friday, providing relief from humid weather. The India Meteorological Department indicated more rain in the next two hours, affecting several areas in Delhi and NCR. Northern parts of India are also expected to see moderate rainfall throughout the week. In June, New Delhi recorded its highest rainfall in 88 years.112028409",

    "text": "Heatwave likely to persist in parts of northwestern and southeastern China through at least Aug. 12. Utility disruptions possible. High temperatures will likely persist across parts of northwestern and southeastern China through at least Aug. 12. As of early Aug. 2, the China Meteorological Administration has issued a yellow high-temperature warning (the second lowest level on a four-tier scale) across the affected areas. Temperatures of over 40 C (104 F) are possible in parts of southern Anhui, western Chongqing, central and northern Fujian, southeastern Hubei, southern Jiangsu, northeastern Jiangxi, Shanghai, southeastern Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Zhejiang. High temperatures of 35-39 C (95-102 F) are forecast across the affected areas through at least Aug. 12. Officials could upgrade, rescind, or expand the coverage of weather alerts over the coming days. The extended period of oppressive heat and dry conditions may produce ideal circumstances for wildfire growth throughout the region. Heatwaves also threaten vulnerable groups - such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with respiratory illnesses - due to the increased possibility of heat stroke or heat exhaustion during prolonged exposure to high temperatures. These health risks could also extend to relatively healthy individuals during significant heatwave events. In addition to significantly impacting athletes and those who work outdoors, high temperatures can cause problems for people using mass transit. The lack of air conditioning and cramped vehicles during rush hour may lead to some passengers' hospitalization. Very high temperatures may damage road surfaces, and overheated vehicles may worsen traffic problems in urban areas where congestion is already a problem. Commercial trucking disruptions might occur, as very high temperatures put more stress on vehicles, making tire blowouts more common. Major flight disruptions are unlikely at regional airports, but general aviation disruptions are possible, and some airfreight carriers could reduce cargo loads. High temperatures could lead to an increased demand for electricity, which might trigger localized brownouts or blackouts, exacerbating hazardous conditions when air conditioning is no longer possible. Monitor local media for weather updates and related advisories. During heatwaves, remain indoors in air conditioning when possible. If outdoor activities are necessary, frequently rest in shaded areas; avoid activity during the hottest times of the day. Stay well-hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. Avoid alcoholic beverages, which are dehydrating; drink bottled or boiled water. Wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothing. Cotton fabrics are more cooling than synthetics. Promptly seek medical attention if signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke develop. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

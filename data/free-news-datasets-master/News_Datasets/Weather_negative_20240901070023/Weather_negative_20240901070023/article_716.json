    "text": "TAMPA, Fla. - A tropical system known as Invest 97L is expected to bring heavy rain and wind to the Bay Area, with the strongest impacts starting Sunday. The National Hurricane Center says the system has a 60 percent chance of development over the next two days and a 90 percent chance in the next seven days. If it gets a name, it would be Debby. FOX 13 meteorologist Dave Osterberg says the system remains \"very, very disorganized\" as of Friday morning since it&apos;s moving over land. Once it moves into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, though, it will have a chance to develop as it approaches Florida. Osterberg says whether the disturbance develops or not, impacts will be felt statewide Sunday and Monday, with several inches of rain, potential flooding and tropical storm force wind gusts expected. Most computer models show a tropical storm near Florida&apos;s west coast around Sunday evening, but the storm&apos;s exact path and intensity could quickly change depending on how well organized it becomes and how much time it spends over water, according to Osterberg. Gov. Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency for most Florida counties, including throughout the Bay Area. Sandbags are being offered beginning Friday in several locations, including in the City of St. Petersburg from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Friday through Sunday, weather permitting: Lake Maggiore Park Shelter Area – 3601 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. St. S.

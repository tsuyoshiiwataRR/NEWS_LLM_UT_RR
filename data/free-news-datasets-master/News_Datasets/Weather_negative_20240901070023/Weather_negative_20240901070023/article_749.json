    "text": "Weather Authority: Friday morning update FOX 29's Sue Serio has a look at your weekend forecast, including Friday's Excessive Heat Warning.\nThe National Weather Service has issued an Excessive Heat Warning for parts of the Philadelphia area, while the rest of the region remains under a Heat Advisory.\nThe Excessive Heat Warning was issued overnight and will last until 8 p.m. Friday evening.\nFOX 29â€™s Sue Serio says dew points are expected to be much higher than they were on Thursday, meaning the heat index will reach dangerous territories. Temperatures are expected to feel like 106 degrees or more in parts of the area Friday.\nThere is also a chance of heavy storms later in the day that could produce heavy downpours.\nBy the end of the day Friday, the area will have recorded its fourth heat wave of the year. Expect very, very humid conditions throughout the day.\n90 degree temperatures are expected to return on Saturday, with highs in the low 90s. Sunday should bring temperatures in the upper 80s.\nLike Friday, Saturday and Sunday will each come with a change of pop-up or scattered storms.",

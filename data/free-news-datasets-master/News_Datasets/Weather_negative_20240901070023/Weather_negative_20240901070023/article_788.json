    "text": "A low-pressure area has formed over Gangetic West Bengal and adjoining Jharkhand, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) announced on Friday. This weather system is expected to intensify and bring widespread rainfall to several states in the region.The low-pressure area, accompanied by a cyclonic circulation extending up to 7.6 kilometres above sea level, is likely to move west-northwestwards in the next 24 hours. Further, the monsoon trough is also active over East India for the next 3-4 days.Under the combined influence of these systems, extremely heavy rains are expected over Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Sikkim today. Heavy to very heavy rainfall in isolated places across Assam, Meghalaya, Jharkhand, Odisha, Gangetic West Bengal, Bihar, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura are forecast until August 8.A red warning has been issued over Bihar, Jharkhand and Sikkim; orange alert over Gangetic West Bengal, Assam Meghalaya and N.M.M.T; and yellow watch over Odisha and Arunachal Pradesh for today. For the rest of the forecast period, yellow and orange alerts have been issued based on the intensity of rains expected. Residents of these states have been advised to remain cautious and be prepared for heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and lightning. The IMD will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide updates on the system's movement and intensity.In the meantime, the weather department has warned of localised flooding of roads, waterlogging in low lying areas, closure of underpasses mainly in urban areas and the occasional reduction in visibility due to heavy rainfall. These can lead to disruption of traffic in major cities. Further, damage to vulnerable structures, landslides/mudslides and crop damage are also possible.Locals are advised to check for traffic congestion on their route before leaving their homes, and follow any traffic advisories that are issued in this regard. Farmers have been asked to make provisions to drain out excess water from crop fields to avoid water stagnation.",

    "text": "HARRISBURG, Pa. â€” The FOX43 Weather Team has issued a [Weather Impact Alert Day](https://www.fox43.com/article/weather/weather-impact/weather-impact-alert-days-fox43/521-2459b02a-d435-42db-97f7-c2a3f2c8bdab) today for high heat and humidity that will cause temperatures to feel like the triple digits. Today marks day 3 of this latest heatwave, which is expected to continue into Saturday. Because of the high heat index, the National Weather Service has issued a Heat Advisory until Friday at 8 pm. During that time, it's important to stay cool as best as possible. If you have to be outside, make sure you're taking frequent breaks and staying hydrated. You can also stay cool by wearing light colored, loose fitting clothing. Along with the heat today, scattered thunderstorms will be possible throughout the day. There's a low risk of these storms being strong to severe with damaging wind gusts the highest concern. Heavy rainfall is also possible with any showers or storms that form since it is so humid outside. While the day isn't a washout, keep an eye to the sky in case you run into some of these storms! Weather Impact Alerts will continue through Saturday as the heat wave continues into the start of the weekend. Sunday will break the heat wave with temperatures dropping back into the upper 80s.

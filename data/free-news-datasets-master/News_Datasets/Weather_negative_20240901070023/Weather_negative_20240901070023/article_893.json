    "text": "Met Éireann has issued a yellow weather warning for the upcoming bank holiday weekend and forecast &quot;impactful&quot; weather for this Bank Holiday weekend, with heavy rain and localised flooding in places. &quot;Heavy rain coupled with strong and gusty southerly winds, especially in exposed areas. Potential impacts: Localised flooding; Damage to temporary structures; Difficult travelling conditions and poor visibility,” Met Éireann said. The warning for Clare, Kerry, Galway and Mayo will last from 8pm Sunday night until midday on bank holiday Monday. It will be mostly cloudy this morning while the east of the country will see some bright spells. Some parts might expect a little light rain and drizzle in places. Meanwhile, a spell of persistent rain might turn heavy at times, moving in along the west coast and spreading eastwards across the country in the morning and afternoon. The rain is expected to become lighter as it moves across eastern parts this afternoon while the western parts will see a clearance to mainly dry weather with sunshine. It will become clear later for all parts, reaching the east coast in the evening. Temperatures will range from 17 to 23C on Friday, while it will be the warmest in the east. It might turn fresher and breezy as the rain clears. Tonight will be largely dry, with long clear spells and just a few showers in western and northwestern coastal areas. The night will be cooler and fresher than the recent nights, with temperatures dropping to 8 and 12C. The Bank Holiday weekend will start off with a bright day on Saturday, with good spells of sunshine and a lot of dry weather. However, the north and the west might see scattered showers at times. Temperatures will be 16 to 19 or 20C, with fresher winds in western coastal parts. Saturday night will be largely dry and clear but the cloud will thicken from the west of the country, with some patchy outbreaks of light rain and drizzle spreading eastwards overnight. The east and south will mostly likely remain dry. Temperatures will range from 10 to 14C, with possible fresh winds along the west coast later at night. Sunday morning will bring some bright spells in the east and south, however it will remain cloudy and dry for most parts, apart from a little patchy rain and drizzle. However, heavy and persistent rain will move in along the west coast by early afternoon, spreading to most parts by evening. Meanwhile, some southeastern parts may escape largely dry. Met Éireann has warned of possible localised flooding, especially across Connacht and west Munster. Temperatures on Sunday will range from 16 to 20C but it will be a blustery day, with possible strong and gusty winds in coastal parts of the west and south. Sunday night will see further spells of heavy rain, which might be thundery, bringing a continued chance of spot flooding. Bank Holiday Monday will have a cloudy morning, with further spells of heavy thundery rain, especially across the midlands, east and southeast. Met Éireann has said there is uncertainty around how fast the rain will clear but it looks like a clearance to mainly dry, bright weather will move into the northwest and west by early morning. It will later extend to most places later in the day. The rain might linger in the eastern and southern parts for much of the day. Monday will be humid with the rain and will turn fresher as it clears, with temperatures of 18 and up to 22C. Any lingering rain in the east and south will clear overnight while the north and west will see scattered showers. Monday night will be fresh, with temperatures of 9 and 11C.

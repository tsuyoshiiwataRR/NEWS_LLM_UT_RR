    "text": "WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - Kansans are cleaning up damage from severe storms that blew through the state late Wednesday night.\nAutoplay Those storms brought 95 mph winds to Salina, uprooting trees and power poles, blowing over stoplights and ripping the roofs off buildings.\nDue to the extensive damage, the Saline County Commission issued a verbal state of disaster emergency proclamation. County and City officials are providing recovery services for all Saline County residents, including free meals, cooling centers and charging stations, and debris cleanup assistance.\nThose cooling centers and charging stations are necessary because thousands of Salina residents were without power after the storm. According to Evergy, dozens of power poles were knocked down, and multiple transmission lines were damaged.\nEvergy said most repairs will be completed by Thursday night, but some outages are expected to stretch into Saturday afternoon. Linemen from surrounding states are being called in to assist with these repairs.\nAccording to the Kansas Highway Patrol, the storm also caused a semi-truck to overturn on its side on northbound Interstate 135 at the Kansas Highway 140 junction. One of the two men inside was taken to the hospital with a possible injury.\nThe City of Salina said staff across multiple departments will perform a city-wide limb pick-up in the next several days in order to make the roads passable.\nCopyright 2024 KWCH.

    "text": "July was a brutal weather month. Many regions across our country experienced extreme weather patterns. Wildfires, excessive heat, monsoon rainfall, tornadoes and a strong hurricane ravaged numerous sections of our country. Locally, our weather featured hot and dry conditions. Our rainfall is sparse. We need steady soaking rains. My lawn is brown and cut every two weeks or so, but only the high spots. My hedges are another summer story. Hedges love hot and humid weather. They grow quickly in these conditions, thus needing regular trimming. My July morning runs featured a disturbing sight. Many leaves are withered, changing color and dropping due to our extended dry weather. Running past these July leaves produces a chill. It’s too early for falling leaves. A recent July news story has me scanning the roadside for a view of mysterious objects. Apparently for several years, and mostly out west, monolith structures are appearing in the strangest locations. The most recent monolith appeared on a Colorado farm. This monolith was taken down by the landowners due to the crop damage and trash left behind by curious gawkers. These monoliths attract huge crowds, creating numerous issues for the land owners. Consequently, this monolith was removed. The landowner used a large excavator to remove this nine-foot-tall, four-foot-wide and eight-inch-deep monolith. The land owner said he’s storing the monolith. There was no mention of the monolith’s weight. There were numerous monolith sightings out in the western United States. These structures appear, creating news stories. So I scan my surroundings, looking for the first Greater Johnstown monolith. Well, it could happen. Another July news story created a “Wow!” on my morning run. It seems that every July 1, retired baseball player Bobby Bonilla receives a $1.19 million check from his former team, the New York Mets. This is a great example of astute and savvy financial planning. Bonilla hasn’t played in 20 years. These guaranteed payments are received every year until 2035. Another area along my running routes made the July news. Back in 1975, 74 acres or so on Schoolhouse Road in Richland Township was sold by the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown to the MetLife Insurance Co. I ran by, watching that building and grounds undergoing construction and landscaping. Eventually, I ran past the employees driving to work. The MetLife parking lot became my shortcut to the Pitt-Johnstown cross country course. Now, this old MetLife building and grounds are being sold back to Pitt-Johnstown. The rezoning process is underway. Just what will Pitt-Johns-town do with that building and grounds? Although I never had any issues running up and down Schoolhouse Road, this area’s unique geographic location created winter driving issues for many MetLife employees. The wide-open old farm fields surrounding the Greater Johnstown Career and Technology Center and the MetLife building was a driving nightmare for these employees. The winter winds formed huge drifts across Schoolhouse Road. I ran around them, but motorists had to stay on the road. Despite the valiant efforts by the Richland road crews, Mother Nature always won. The end result of these wintry road conditions were numerous complaint letters published in The Tribune Democrat’s letters to the editor section. Another local news story featured a fascinating opportunity. Windber Area School District agreed to purchase the Iron Horse Sports Complex, located in Paint Township. This athletic site is a state-of-the-art sports venue. A key component is the large under-roof practice facility. Windber’s athletic teams and the band can now practice year-round in a dry environment. The Iron Horse purchase by Windber was a wise decision. The student and public benefits are enormous. Yet many voiced their opposition to this purchase. Using our recreational opportunities is key to a healthy life. We end on an incredible note. Kaylee Frederick, a 19-year-old Pitt-Johnstown student, recently completed her second Death Valley Badwater 135 run. This 135-mile race begins at the Badwater Basin and finished at the Mount Whitney portal. Ninety-seven runners began this race, but only 79 finished the course. Frederick completed the grueling nonstop course in 36:13:31. She cut four hours off her 2023 finishing time. Well done, Kaylee Frederick! George A. Hancock is a local runner and writer.",

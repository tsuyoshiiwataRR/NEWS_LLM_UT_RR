    "text": "The National Weather Service Guam Weather Forecast Office issued a thunderstorm advisory, in effect for the Guam International Airport until 9 p.m. Friday. It also issued a flood advisory until 10 p.m. Friday. Excessive rainfall will cause urban and small stream flooding. Between 0.4 and 0.6 inches of rain have fallen. Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are expected resulting in minor flooding. A thunderstorm advisory is in effect for the Guam International Airport until 9 p.m. this evening. Thunderstorms are occurring within 20 nautical miles of the airport. Showers developing to the west of Guam suggest potential for some of these showers to develop into thunderstorms. Be alert and take precautions as required. If outdoors, seek shelter if lightning is seen or thunder is heard. Showers developing to the west of Guam suggest potential for some of these showers to develop into thunderstorms. Be alert and take precautions as required. If outdoors, seek shelter if lightning is seen or thunder is heard. Some locations that will experience flooding include Dededo, Tamuning, Yigo, Mangilao, Chalan Pago-Ordot, Barrigada, Yona, Agana Heights, Andersen AFB, Talo'fo'fo', Mongmong-Toto-Maite, Sinajana, Inalåhan, Asan, Malesso', Piti, Sånta Rita-Sumai, and Humåtak. Residents and visitors are advised to take the following precautionary actions: • Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads. • If driving, be alert for low visibilities in heavy rain; • Slow down where water is ponding on the road; • Turn Around, Don’t Drown. Avoid walking or driving through flood waters. Just 6 inches of moving water can knock you down, and 2 feet of water can sweep your vehicle away; • Do not camp, park, or hike along streams and rivers. These areas can flood quickly and with little warning. The Offices of Guam Homeland Security and Civil Defense remind the community to practice caution while traveling in heavy rain, driving below the speed limit and allowing enough braking distance between vehicles.

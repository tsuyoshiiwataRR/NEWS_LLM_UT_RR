    "text": "The National Weather Service issued a report at 3:21 p.m. on Thursday for strong thunderstorms until 4:15 p.m. for Lebanon County.\nResidents can look for wind gusts of up to 40 mph.\n\"At 3:20 p.m., Doppler radar tracked a strong thunderstorm near Lebanon, moving southeast at 10 mph,\" says the weather service. \"Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.\"\nLocations impacted by the alert include Lebanon, Cornwall, Myerstown, Pleasant Hill, Sand Hill, Newmanstown, Lebanon South, Avon, Richland, Fredericksburg, Schaefferstown, Quentin, Kleinfeltersville, Jonestown and Avon Heights.\nAccording to the weather service, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.\"\nWhen lightning looms: Expert safety tips for thunderstorms Each year, lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times, with the majority of these electrifying events occurring during the summer months. Unfortunately, lightning is responsible for claiming the lives of approximately 20 people annually, as reported by the weather service. The threat of lightning becomes more pronounced as thunderstorms draw nearer, peaking when the storm is directly overhead and gradually waning as it moves away.\nTo protect yourself during a thunderstorm, take these recommendations into consideration:\nLightning safety plan:\nWhen venturing outdoors, it's vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning. Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby. Seek shelter promptly in a safe location, preferably indoors. Indoors safety measures:\nOnce you've found shelter indoors, abstain from using corded phones, electrical appliances, or plumbing fixtures, and refrain from approaching windows and doors. Lightning can follow conductive pathways, and these precautions reduce the risk of electrical surges. Wait for the all-clear:\nAfter the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. Lightning can strike even when a storm has seemingly passed, so exercise caution. When indoor shelter isn't available:\nIf you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:\nAvoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk. Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In forested areas, stay close to lower stands of trees. If you're with a group, ensure individuals are spread out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people. Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If you have no alternative, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. It's crucial to note that a tent provides no protection against lightning. Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks. In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety.\nMastering wet roads: Safety tips for heavy rainfall When heavy rain pours, the risk of flooding and treacherous roads rises. Here's your guide from the weather service to staying safe during downpours:\nBeware of rapid water flow:\nIn heavy rain, refrain from parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a grave danger.\nMaintain safe driving distances:\nUse the two-second rule to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you and allow an extra two seconds in heavy rain.\nReduce speed and drive cautiously:\nIf it is raining and the roads are wet, slow down. Take your foot off the accelerator and let your speed drop gradually. Never use the brakes suddenly because this may cause the car to skid.\nChoose your lane wisely:\nStick to the middle lanes on multi-lane roads to minimize the risk of hydroplaning, as water tends to accumulate in outer lanes.\nVisibility matters:\nEnhance your visibility in heavy rain by turning on your headlights. Watch out for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.\nWatch out for slippery roads:\nThe initial half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mixture of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\nDon't follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely.\nMind your windshield wipers:\nOverloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely limits your sight, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or protected spots.\nIf the roadside is your only option, pull off as far as possible, preferably past the end of a guard rail, and wait until the storm passes. Keep your headlights on and turn on emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.\nBy following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

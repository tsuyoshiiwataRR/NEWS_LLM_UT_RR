    "text": "July can be known for being one of the most active months of the calendar in the Midwest. This year was no exception in our area.\nHere's a recap of the wild month of weather that July 2024 was in the Rockford area:\nFirst off, the usual statistics.\nDespite how hot and humid it felt over much of the month, it was evened out by seasonably cool and comfortable days at times in Rockford. In fact, the only 90° day in the whole month was the last day, July 31.\nJuly 2024's average high temperature ended up nearly 1° below average and the average low temperature was 0.6° cooler than average.\nThe humidity, however, fueled torrential downpours at times that sent this July to the 8th wettest in Rockford's recorded history. 7.79\" of rain fell at the Chicago-Rockford International Airport (Rockford's official climate site), which is nearly double the average monthly rainfall of 3.81\".\nOne three-day stretch brought over half of the month's rainfall. A \"ring of fire\" pattern was setting up a parade of storms into our area.\nThe first round of storms came the night of July 13, bringing up to penny sized hail to the Belvidere area, but then stalling right on top of Rockford and the I-90 corridor. The result was\ntorrential downpours that continued for up to four hours in the city of Rockford, with nowhere for the water to go.\nFlash flooding began quickly, stranding drivers and sending water into basements across the Forest City. Hundreds of water rescues were reported across the city, especially in the Keith Creek area of the southeast side.\nMeasured rainfall amounts exceeded six inches in spots, getting nearly two months worth of rain in just a few hours. The extent of the damage is still being assessed by local, state, and federal officials.\nBut that was just night #1.\nAfter another wave of showers and storms in the morning, Sunday gained that hot and humid feeling during the rest of the day. It symbolized a destabilizing atmosphere ahead of our next wave of strong to severe thunderstorms.\nOn the brighter side, this round moved through faster than the previous night's storms, but it was clear that any rainfall was going to cause flooding in Rockford. Sunday night's downpours brought renewed flash flooding to similar areas from the night before.\nNumerous water rescues were again reported in Rockford. The floods also resulted in the death of 76-year-old veteran Dean Gulbranson when the car he was riding in was swept away.\nThis round of storms, however, brought more severe weather, including damaging winds and even a short-lived and weak tornado.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Chicago, the EF-0 tornado had peak winds of 75 mph over a roughly three mile path. It touched down in rural Ogle County, destroying an outbuilding and causing tree and crop damage as it passed south of Esmond and lifted in rural DeKalb County.\nThe storms also caused tree and power line damage throughout the area. The damage would be relatively minor compared to the next, and final, round of storms less than 24 hours later.\nJuly's \"ring of fire\" pattern would\nend with a derecho that was not the strongest the Stateline has seen in the last five years, but would trigger a record number of tornadoes across northern Illinois. 10 of those tornadoes would strike our local area, all happening within a two hours.\nThe strongest was an EF-2 that tracked from near Stockton to Lena along an \"intermittent 15 mile path,\"\naccording to the NWS in the Quad Cities. With peak winds of 115 mph (equivalent to a Cat. 3 hurricane) it damaged an outbuilding and grain elevator supports on a farmstead as well as snapped trees and power poles.\nTwo EF-1 tornadoes were recorded, one with 100 mph maximum winds that tracked through rural Jo Daviess County east of Woodbine, and another with 100 mph maximum winds with an \"intermittent\" 30 mile path from near Elizabeth in Jo Daviess County to Shannon in Carroll County.\nAlso in Stephenson County, a weak tornado touched down near Dakota south of Cedarville Rd. The tornado was caught on camera, but little damage was found, leaving it with an EF-U (for \"unknown\") rating.\nIn a nearly 25 minute stretch from 7:44 - 8:08 p.m.,\naccording to Chicago's NWS office, five EF-0 tornadoes struck parts of Winnebago and Ogle Counties. They were within a large swath of up to 90 mph winds that stretched into DeKalb County.\nTornado damage was found along Montague Rd. southwest of Rockford, Baxter Rd. near New Milford, and along Rt. 72 with individual tornadoes in Byron, Davis Junction, and Monroe Center. The last local tornado of the night was another EF-U near Maple Park along the DeKalb/Kane County line.\nDozens of other tornadoes touched down from Iowa to Indiana, but widespread straight-line wind damage even continued into Ohio. Thankfully, this awful stretch of weather was followed by a several-day stretch of seasonably cool and dry weather.\nThe dry weather also allowed our area rivers to \"flush out\" the incredible amounts of rain. Flooding stayed relatively minor and has since receded thanks to mostly dry conditions for the rest of the month.\n\"Mostly\" is a key word, however, because typical summer-like \"garden variety\" storms still caused some localized downpours.\nThis includes on July 22, when such a storm developed right on top of the Rockford Airport, dumping 1.78\" of rain. Similar storms also developed across the area in the few days afterwards, helping send this month into the record books rainfall-wise.\nAfter such an active July, what does August look like?\nThe\ncurrent August outlook from the Climate Prediction Center shows equal chances when it comes to either above or below average temperatures. As for the precipitation outlook, probabilities are leaning (albeit barely) towards a wetter month ahead.",

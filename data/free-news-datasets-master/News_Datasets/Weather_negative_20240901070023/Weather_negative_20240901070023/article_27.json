    "text": "On Thursday at 1:55 p.m. the National Weather Service issued an updated severe thunderstorm warning valid until 2:30 p.m. for Saratoga and Washington counties.\nWind gusts of up to 60 mph and penny-sized hail (0.75 inches) are likely.\n\"At 1:54 p.m., a severe thunderstorm was located near Fort Edward, or 8 miles south of Hudson Falls, moving southeast at 10 mph,\" according to the weather service. \"Expect damage to roofs, siding, and trees.\"\nLocations impacted by the warning include Greenwich, Northumberland, Schuylerville, Victory, Argyle, Bacon Hill, Cossayuna, Coveville, Jewell Corner, Grangerville, Middle Falls, Gansevoort, Bald Mountain, Starks Knob, Clarks Mills, Lick Springs, East Greenwich, Victory Mills, Thomson and Callahans Corners.\nThe weather service states, \"For your protection move to an interior room on the lowest floor of a building.\"\nLightning on the horizon: Expert safety measures for thunderstorms\nLightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away.\nTo protect yourself during a thunderstorm, take these recommendations into consideration:\nLightning safety plan:\n- When venturing outdoors, it's crucial to have a lightning safety plan in place.\n- Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby.\n- Seek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors.\nIndoors safety measures:\n- Once you've found shelter indoors, abstain from using corded phones, electrical appliances, or plumbing fixtures, and refrain from approaching windows and doors.\n- Lightning can follow conductive pathways, and these precautions reduce the risk of electrical surges.\nWait for the all-clear:\n- After the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities.\n- Lightning can strike even when a storm has seemingly passed, so exercise caution.\nWhen indoor shelter isn't available:\nIf you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:\n- Avoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, which expose you to greater lightning risk.\n- Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In forested areas, stay close to lower stands of trees.\n- If you're with a group, ensure individuals are spread out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people.\n- Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If no alternative exists, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. Remember that a tent offers no protection against lightning.\n- Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. While water and metal don't attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks.\nIn summary, when facing the threat of lightning, vigilance and preparedness are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the chances of lightning-related accidents and prioritize your safety.\nNavigating rainy roads: Safety tips for wet weather\nWhen heavy rain strikes, safety is paramount. Equip yourself with these guidelines from the weather service to navigate wet roads and avoid hazards:\nBeware of swollen waterways:\nAvoid parking or walking in close proximity to culverts or drainage ditches, as the swiftly moving water during heavy rain can potentially carry you away.\nMaintain safe driving distances:\nThe two-second rule for following distance is your ally in heavy rain. Extend it to four seconds to ensure safe spacing in adverse conditions.\nReduce speed and drive cautiously:\nIf it is raining and the roads are wet, slow down. Take your foot off the accelerator and let your speed drop gradually. Never use the brakes suddenly because this may cause the car to skid.\nChoose your lane wisely:\nStick to the middle lanes on multi-lane roads to minimize the risk of hydroplaning, as water tends to accumulate in outer lanes.\nPrioritize visibility\nEnhance your visibility in heavy rain by turning on your headlights. Watch out for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.\nWatch out for slippery roads:\nThe first half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mix of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\nDon't follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely.\nMind your windshield wipers:\nOverloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely limits your sight, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or protected spots.\nWhen stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.\nBy following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.",

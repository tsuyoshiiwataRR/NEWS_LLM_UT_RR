    "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. â€” Thousands of people are without power across Kentucky and southern Indiana after a powerful line of thunderstorms moved through the region Thursday afternoon. Over 2,000 [LG&E](https://stormcenter.lge-ku.com/) customers in Kentucky are without power as of 7 p.m. Friday. The majority of the outages are located in Jefferson County. [Duke Energy ](https://outagemaps.duke-energy.com/#/current-outages/in)reports more than 190 customers are without power across Indiana as of 2 p.m. on Friday. Crews with both energy companies are working to restore power to people as fast a possible, however it's unclear when power will be fully restored. Remember! Avoid downed power lines.

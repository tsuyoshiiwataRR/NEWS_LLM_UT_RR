    "text": "视频播放位置\n下载安装Flash播放器 TOKYO, Aug. 2 (Xinhua) -- Amid the severe heatwave in Tokyo, a record 3,647 individuals were hospitalized for heatstroke in July, surpassing the previous five-year high set in July 2023, official data showed.\nThe Tokyo Fire Department reported that from July 1 to 28, more than 100 people were hospitalized daily for 11 consecutive days following the end of the rainy season on July 18.\nJapan's weather agency said Thursday that the past month was the hottest July since records began in 1898, with the national average temperature for July being 2.16 degrees Celsius above the baseline average calculated from 1991 to 2020.\nTemperatures have risen earlier in 2024 compared to last year based on the heat stress index, according to Koji Ogishima, an official with the Tokyo Fire Department's disaster prevention department.\nThe heat stress index, or Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) which measures heatstroke risk, takes into account temperature, humidity, and sunlight intensity.\nA heatstroke alert is issued when the index exceeds 33. At a WBGT of 31 or above the actual temperature is higher than the skin temperature, so body heat cannot escape, and except for special cases, all exercise should be stopped.\nLast year, the heat index first surpassed 33 on July 10, but it did so on June 24 this year. By July 21, the WBGT had exceeded 33 nine times, almost double the figure for July last year.\n\"Heat exhaustion can accumulate during outdoor work or sports, leading to collapse at home at night,\" warned Ogishima.\nThe increase in heatstroke cases has also led to a rise in emergency calls, with daily dispatches peaking at 3,372 on July 8, approaching the record high of 3,382 on July 23, 2018, the latest data showed.\nThe Tokyo Fire Department urged residents to use air conditioning and fans, stay hydrated, and use parasols to avoid direct sunlight.

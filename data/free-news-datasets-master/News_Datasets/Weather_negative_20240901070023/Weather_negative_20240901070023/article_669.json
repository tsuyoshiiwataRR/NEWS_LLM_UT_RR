    "text": "Rain chances will be typical of summer, isolated to pop-up in nature. MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - The first weekend of August will feature plenty of heat and humidity. In fact, most locations will soar into the mid to upper 90s Friday through Sunday... Factor in the humidity and “feels like” temperatures will push near or above the triple-digit mark each afternoon. Friday was hot and humid! Those lucky enough to get rain were still hot, but those who miss out on the showers easily reached the mid to upper 90s. Throw in some humidity and it felt every bit of 105-108 degrees during the afternoon! As for rain chances looking forward, they won’t change much… isolated to widely scattered in nature during our wettest point of the day is all we expect. Much of our Saturday and Sunday will be dry, but briefly your outdoor plans could get interrupted by a passing storm. This weather pattern is forecast to remain the same through early next workweek. We expect a similar pattern to unfold this weekend with afternoon temperatures in the mid 90s and that “feels like” numbers soaring close to or above 100 degrees each afternoon. Showers and storms will be hard to come by with only 10-30% of us getting wet this weekend. Watch the latest live and local weather data below, streaming on WSFA Weather Now! Please note, this stream does not include live severe weather coverage, only data on the latest weather conditions. If that’s not enough, as many head back to school next week… as of right now, the weather will remain on the hot and humid side. With highs soaring into the middle to upper 90s each afternoon, heat index values in or near the 100s and the low end chance for an isolated shower or storm. Making for a sweltering start back to school for many across central and south Alabama. In the tropics, a cluster of storms in the central Atlantic Ocean shows potential for development over the next five to seven days. It will move in the general direction of the Bahamas and/or Florida by the end of the week and into the first weekend of August and get the name Debby! Still a lot of questions on where this potential tropical system will track when/if formed… models are pushing the potential storm towards the Gulf of Mexico and eventually into Florida. With no official system developed, this is something we will watch closely through the weekend and into next week. Copyright 2024 WSFA. All rights reserved.",

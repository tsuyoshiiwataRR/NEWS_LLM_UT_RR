    "text": "Fears of record temperatures in Fairbanks, Alaska, were realized in late July, with thermometers hitting 90 degrees Fahrenheit .\nWhat's happening? According to Scientific American , Alaska is experiencing an unusually warm period of weather because of a \"strong bubble of warm air\" and high pressure, as meteorologist Greg Michels detailed.\nThe hottest-ever July 22 was recorded, landing at 90 degrees Fahrenheit to beat the previous high of 89, as The Washington Post observed.\nMichels noted that with fewer clouds in the sky, thanks to the high-pressure system, the sun's rays are uninhibited on the way down to Earth, making the air heat up quickly.\nWith the summer solstice on June 20 leaving a full two hours less daylight time for heat to accumulate by late July, the record high temperature is additionally concerning. While temperature highs are seen elsewhere in the United States during the summer months, climate scientist Brian Brettschneider told Scientific American \"that just cannot happen here ... because you need that sun angle, the hours of daylight.\"\nWhy are record-high temperatures in Alaska concerning? Thermometers are hitting new highs across the globe , so it's not entirely surprising that Alaska is witnessing them, too. However, residents of the state are not equipped to deal with excessive heat, and public health warnings have been issued.\nWatch now: Local hero single-handedly repopulates endangered butterfly species Homes are built to withstand the extreme colds that are typical in the area, so when the temperature creeps higher, trapping heat inside can become uncomfortable and potentially deadly.\nAir conditioning units are flying off the shelves, as Uma Bhatt, a climate scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, told Scientific American. While this is an effective method of cooling, these units require a lot of energy to run, putting a strain on the electricity grid in a time of high demand. This could result in power outages, causing additional problems for residents.\nAir or heat pumps are an alternative method to cool (or heat) a property that requires significantly less energy, and they are much cheaper to run. With high temperatures perhaps a more regular occurrence, residents might want to look into the technology .\nWhat should you do in excessive heat? Staying in air-conditioned areas and away from the outdoor heat is important to help regulate body temperature and avoid the risk of heat-related illnesses. However, air conditioning isn't as ubiquitous in Alaska as it is in other areas of the United States.\nCommunity cooling areas, such as in public libraries or schools, are increasingly popular as temperatures creep upward, so finding these spots is an ideal way to beat the sun's blast.\nOtherwise, avoiding strenuous activity, wearing lightweight clothing, and drinking lots of water is advised by UNICEF .\nJoin our free newsletter for cool news and cool tips that make it easy to help yourself while helping the planet.",

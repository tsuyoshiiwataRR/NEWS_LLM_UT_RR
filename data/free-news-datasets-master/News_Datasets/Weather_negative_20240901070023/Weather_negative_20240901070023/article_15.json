    "text": "The United States vs. China beach volleyball game ended with an American win, following a weather delay. A lightning strike forced the beginning of the third set to pause. Kristen Nuss and her teammate, Taryn Kloth, lost the first set but came back strong in the second, forcing a third set against China. The game stopped 3-2 with USA in the lead. The stadium was forced to evacuate. Nuss and Kloth secure a spot in the top 16 round of the Olympics. Below, you can find their competition schedule. You can watch Olympic competition coverage on WDSU, Peacock, or NBCOlympics.com. Schedule: All competition times below are in Central Time. Aug. 1, 3 p.m. United States vs. China (lightning delay, new start time TBD)Aug. 9, 2:30 p.m. Bronze Medal MatchAug. 9, 3:30 p.m. Gold Medal Match Beach volleyball made its official Olympic debut at the Atlanta 1996 Games after first appearing as a demonstration sport at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Brazil and the USA have achieved considerable success in the sport at the Games, winning a combined 24 medals (including 10 golds) out of a possible 42. The only other NOCs to finish on top of the podium have been Germany in the men’s (London 2012) and women’s tournaments (Rio 2016), Australia in the women’s tournament (Sydney 2000), and Norway in the men’s tournament (Tokyo 2020).Kloth and Nuss will be the first U.S. Olympic women’s beach volleyball team that isn't from California or doesn’t primarily train in that state.Nuss, a 5-foot, 6-inch-tall New Orleans native, is set to become the shortest U.S. Olympic beach volleyball player since Barbra Fontana in 1996.Nuss is a graduate of Mount Carmel Academy and the granddaughter of former Major League Baseball infielder Putsy Caballero, who was one of the youngest players in MLB history.Kloth, a 6-foot, 4-inch-tall South Dakota native and Nuss’ height difference is the largest for a U.S. Olympic beach team.",

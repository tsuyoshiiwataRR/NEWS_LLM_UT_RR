    "text": "The heat dome causing scorching temperatures across western Europe and north Africa, and boiling athletes and spectators at the Olympic Games in Paris, would have been impossible without human-caused global heating, a rapid analysis has found. Scientists said the fossil-fuelled climate crisis made temperatures 2.5C to 3.3C hotter. Such an event would not have happened in the world before global heating but is now expected about once a decade, they said. Continued emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide will make them even more frequent, the researchers warned. Climate change crashed the Olympics on Tuesday, said Dr Friederike Otto, a climatologist at Imperial College London and part of the World Weather Attribution group behind the analysis. The world watched athletes swelter in 35C heat. If the atmosphere wasnt overloaded with emissions from burning fossil fuels, Paris would have been about 3C cooler and much safer for sport. Numerous athletes, including the gymnastics superstar Simone Biles, have suffered in the heat, with one tennis player having called it crazy and sailing competitors having worn ice vests to keep cool. Fans watching the beach volleyball near the Eiffel Tower were sprayed with hoses, while misting fountains have been set up at skateboarding and other venues and millions of bottles of water have been handed out at train and MÃ©tro stations. EDIT The July heatwave was caused by a large-scale high-pressure ridge, often referred to as a heat dome. It occurred after 13 months of extreme heat globally, with each of the last 13 months being the hottest ever recorded. The climate crisis is making all heatwaves hotter, longer and more frequent around the world. The scientists assessed the impact of human-caused global heating on the extreme July heat by comparing how these events have changed between todays climate, with about 1.3C of global heating, and the cooler preindustrial climate.

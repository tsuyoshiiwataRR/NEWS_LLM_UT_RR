    "text": "Weather Excessive Heat Warning in effect amid activity cancellations and earlier trash collection times By ARLnow.com Published August 2, 2024 at 9:45AM The sun and clouds on a hot July day with a heat advisory (staff photo by James Jarvis) Arlington County and most of the D.C. area is under an Excessive Heat Warning today.\nHeat index values of up to 110 are expected today, making time spent outdoors potentially hazardous, especially for those working, exercising or who are medically vulnerable.\nAs a result of the heat, Arlington’s parks and rec department has cancelled afternoon and evening outdoor activities, including rec league practices and games.\nWith more high temperatures in the 90s expected in the coming days, meanwhile, the county has again extended earlier trash collection times — now through the end of the month. From Arlington’s solid waste bureau:\nThrough the end of August, crews will pick up curbside trash, recycling and organics starting at 6 a.m. to take advantage of cooler morning temperatures. Residents should place carts at the curb no later than 5:30 a.m. on their scheduled collection day.\nIf you have questions, call 703-228-5000.\nIn addition to the heat, storms — some of them severe — are possible later today.\nMore on the heat warning, below, from the National Weather Service.\n434 AM EDT Fri Aug 2 2024\n…EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING IN EFFECT FROM NOON TODAY TO 8 PM EDT THIS EVENING…\n* WHAT…Dangerously hot conditions with heat index values up to 110 expected.\n* WHERE…The District of Columbia, Anne Arundel, Calvert, Cecil, Charles, Prince Georges, Southeast Harford, Southern Baltimore, and St. Mary’s Counties in Maryland, and Arlington/Falls Church/Alexandria and King George Counties in Virginia.\n* WHEN…From noon today to 8 PM EDT this evening.\n* IMPACTS…Extreme heat and humidity will significantly increase the potential for heat-related illnesses, particularly for those working or participating in outdoor activities.\nPRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS…\nDrink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles under any circumstances.\nTake extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments.

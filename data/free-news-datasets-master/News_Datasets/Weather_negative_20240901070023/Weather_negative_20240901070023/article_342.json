Part of it was addressing homelessness. “The budget proposal doesn't have any funding extra funding for rapid rehousing, he doesn't have any extra for permanent supportive housing services. “And those are two things that we absolutely need,” said Barry Jones with Vocal Texas, which rallied for more money in Austin’s proposed city budget -- to help people experiencing homelessness. “The Homeless Strategy Office is getting point 2%, point 2%. The police are getting 35%. These funds can be shifted around. The council knows that they can find the money. That's not the issue. The issue is the will to do it.” “We actually have 967 evictions filed in July. A lot of people talked about how do we solve homelessness. How do we solve homelessness?

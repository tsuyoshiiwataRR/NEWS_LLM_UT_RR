    "text": "By Rosie Shead ,\n38 minutes ago\nHeavy downpours have battered the UK as almost a month’s worth of rain fell in an hour in Greater London , the Met Office said.\nA yellow warning for thunderstorms was issued by the forecaster that covered the majority of the UK on Thursday as temperatures soared to highs of 30C.\nDrivers faced road closures and there were disruptions to public transport, power cuts and flooding.\nBy 8pm on Thursday, New Addington in Greater London had seen the heaviest downpour of the day with 53mm of rain in an hour, according to Met Office data.\nAverage total rainfall for the month of August in the same area is 56mm, the forecaster said.\nJust under 40 miles away, a video on social media showed a group of people pushing a car that had become stuck in flood water in Guildford, Surrey .\nBenson Lock in Oxfordshire recorded 30mm of rainfall in an hour while Wisley, Surrey, enjoyed the highest temperature of the day of 30.2C.\nBy Thursday evening, 26 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, had been issued by the Environment Agency – 11 of which were in Greater London.\nOne flood warning, meaning flooding is expected, was issued for Kidbrooke Stream at Forest Row in East Sussex.\nMet Office meteorologist Simon Partridge said: “There’s been very humid air which is why it’s felt so close and muggy as well.\n“The same air has been over northern France for the last day or two as well – so those heavy thundery showers that they had during the triathlon yesterday morning.\n“So basically, we’ve been getting the same sort of weather as the Olympics have.”\nFriday will be “mostly dry” with highs of up to 29C in south-east England , he added.\n“It will be another very warm, very muggy feeling day and that’s what helps keep a few of those showers going – but it’s not until Saturday where things will feel much fresher across the board.”\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

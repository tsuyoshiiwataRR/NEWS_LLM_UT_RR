    "text": "A report was issued from the National Weather Service on Friday at 6:02 a.m. for strong thunderstorms until 6:45 a.m. for Clearfield and Cambria counties.\nResidents may experience wind gusts of up to 40 mph.\n\"At 6:01 a.m., Doppler radar tracked strong thunderstorms along a line extending from Brookville to 12 miles south of Punxsutawney to 10 miles east of Indiana. Movement was northeast at 30 mph,\" states the weather service. \"Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.\"\nLocations impacted by the alert include DuBois, Clearfield, Sandy, Northern Cambria, Curwensville, Patton, Penfield, Hyde, Hastings, Plymptonville, Rockton, Carrolltown, S.B. Elliot State Park, Prince Gallitzin State Park, Parker Dam State Park, Irvona, Coalport, Westover, Mahaffey and Grampian.\nAccording to the weather service, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building. Very heavy rainfall is also occurring with these storms and may lead to localized flooding. Do not drive your vehicle through flooded roadways. Frequent cloud to ground lightning is occurring with these storms. Lightning can strike 10 miles away from a thunderstorm. Seek a safe shelter inside a building or vehicle.\"\nStaying safe as lightning approaches: Expert advice Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away.\nTo protect yourself during a thunderstorm, take these recommendations into consideration:\nLightning safety plan:\nWhen venturing outdoors, it's vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning. Stay vigilant by monitoring the sky for ominous signs and listening for the telltale sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's a clear indication of nearby lightning. Seek shelter promptly in a safe location, preferably indoors. Indoors safety measures:\nOnce you're indoors, avoid using corded phones, electrical devices, plumbing fixtures, and stay away from windows and doors. These precautions help reduce the risk of electrical surges, as lightning can follow conductive pathways. Wait for the all-clear:\nAfter the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. Lightning can strike even when a storm has seemingly passed, so exercise caution. When indoor shelter isn't available:\nIf you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:\nAvoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk. Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In forested areas, stay close to lower stands of trees. If you're with a group, ensure individuals are spread out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people. Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If you have no alternative, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. It's crucial to note that a tent provides no protection against lightning. Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks. In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, vigilance and preparedness are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the chances of lightning-related accidents and prioritize your safety.\nNavigating rainy roads: Safety tips for wet weather Heavy rainfall may lead to flooding if prolonged or if there is excessive runoff. Excessive runoff can be a result of saturated ground and/or rainfall intensity. Follow these recommendations from the weather service to stay safe in heavy rain:\nBeware of rapid water flow:\nAvoid parking or walking in close proximity to culverts or drainage ditches, as the swiftly moving water during heavy rain can potentially carry you away.\nMaintain safe driving distances:\nUse the two-second rule to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you and allow an extra two seconds in heavy rain.\nSlow down and stay cautious:\nIf it is raining and the roads are wet, slow down. Take your foot off the accelerator and let your speed drop gradually. Never use the brakes suddenly because this may cause the car to skid.\nChoose your lane wisely:\nStick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water.\nVisibility matters:\nTurn on your headlights and be careful of other vehicles to the rear and in blind spot areas as they are especially difficult to see through rain-spattered windows.\nWatch out for slippery roads:\nBe extra careful during the first half hour after rain begins. Grime and oil on the road surface mix with water to make the road slippery.\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\nDon't follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely.\nMind your windshield wipers:\nOverloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely limits your sight, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or protected spots.\nIf the roadside is your only option, pull off as far as possible, preferably past the end of a guard rail, and wait until the storm passes. Keep your headlights on and turn on emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.\nIn the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

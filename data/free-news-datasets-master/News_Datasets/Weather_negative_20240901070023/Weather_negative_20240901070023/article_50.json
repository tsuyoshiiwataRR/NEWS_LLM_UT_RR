Currently, there is an adequate supply of water in the Potomac River and backup reservoirs, but following the regional drought response plan and implementing voluntary water conservation practices across the region will help complement measures already in place and reduce water demand.\nA drought watch is the level in the drought respone plan before drought warning, when additional water restrictions are requested and could become mandatory should conditions worsen.\n“As officials continue to closely monitor drought conditions in the region, it is important for the public to use water wisely,” said Clark Mercer, COG executive director, adding that “with a few simple measures, we can all aid in water conservation efforts and help ensure an adequate water supply for our region.”\nResidents should monitor watering lawns, avoid washing cars, fix any plumbing leaks, reduce shower lengths, turn off water while brushing teeth and wash only full loads of dishes and clothes. While the region is currently at a low to moderate risk for wildfires, COG encourages residents to use extra caution when smoking outside, using outdoor grills or engaging in other activities that involve flammable materials.\nAnne Arundel County has several county cooling centers for community members seeking relief from the heat. Senior activity centers and public libraries are available during business hours, and police department district station lobbies are available 24/7.\nAnnapolis set up a cooling center in the Roger “Pip” Moyer Community Recreation Center that will stay open through Saturday.\n“We have seen the effects of extreme heat in other communities. Now that it is Annapolis’ turn, it is important to know the signs of heat-related illness,” Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley said in the news release announcing the cooling center. “If your neighbors are vulnerable, help them get to a cooling center before they are in crisis. It’s times like this when we need to look out for each other.”\nOriginally Published: August 1, 2024 at 5:29 p.m.",

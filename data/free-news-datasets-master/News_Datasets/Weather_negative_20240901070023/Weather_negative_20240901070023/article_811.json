    "text": "Hot, hazy, poor air quality and scattered storms Friday 48 First Alert Weather Day HUNTSVILLE, Ala. ( [WAFF](http://www.waff.com/)) - Good morning and happy Friday. Fair skies are overhead with warm morning temperatures in the upper 70s, some areas of patchy fog have developed overnight. Today is a 48 First Alert Weather Day for poor air quality across the Tennessee Valley due to Saharan Dust. People with respiratory sensitivity may experience difficulty breathing, especially with the hot and humid conditions. A Heat Advisory is in effect for most counties through 7:00 PM, heat index values will range from 100 to 107 degrees during the afternoon. It will be a hazy, hot and humid day across the Tennessee Valley before a cold front sweeps through. This weak front will trigger some scattered showers and thunderstorms during the afternoon and evening. Some storms will be stronger in nature with isolated damaging wind gusts, frequent lightning and locally heavy rainfall. Storms will end by late evening as the front drops off to the southeast leaving mainly clear skies and warm morning lows in the lower 70s. The weekend forecast looks pretty nice for any outside plans with just isolated showers and storms popping up on Saturday, mainly during the afternoon. Sunday will bring more sunshine to the area with highs in the upper 80s to lower 90s. A sunny and hot stretch of weather is in the forecast for next work and school week with heat indices around 100 degrees through Thursday.

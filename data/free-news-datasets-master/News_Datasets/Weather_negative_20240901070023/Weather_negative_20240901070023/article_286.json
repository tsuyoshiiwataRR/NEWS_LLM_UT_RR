    "text": "(ANSA) – ROME, JULY 31 – The first slight weakening of the anticyclone in the north with even strong thunderstorms arriving in early August. This is confirmed by Lorenzo Tedici, meteorologist for the website www.iLMeteo.it, underlining that the sun and intense heat will persist in the south. “Already in the next few hours – he says – the more unstable air from the west will cause some showers in the Alps and locally also in the Po Valley, especially in Piedmont. We cannot rule out local brief showers in the afternoon hours also between Lombardy and Emilia. The sun will dominate the rest of the country with the African heat”. Temperatures will remain very high with peaks of 43°C in inland Sardinia, up to 38°C in Florence, Syracuse and Terni. We will also have 37°C in Bolzano, Catania, Ferrara, Forlì, Grosseto, Nuoro and Prato. The capital will stop at 36°C. The month of August will then begin with other thunderstorms, still mostly confined to the Alps, but with some afternoon showers on the plains of the Triveneto. On Friday, August 2, intense phenomena are expected in the north and on part of the center that will descend in a widespread manner from the Alpine sector towards the Po Valley. It is the first sign of the weakening of the African anticyclone, with partial involvement of the northern Apennines, from inland Tuscany to the northern Marche. Showers and showers are expected in patches in the north and on the aforementioned sectors of the center. Hail and downbursts are expected, with horizontal wind gusts of over 100 km/h. Also on Friday, high temperatures will still be recorded in the center-south. In Syracuse, 40°C is expected, in Bari and Foggia 39°C, and in Ascoli Piceno, Catania, Lecce and Matera 38°C. In detail: – Wednesday 31. In the north: mostly good weather, except for thunderstorms in the Alps and Prealps. In the center: always sunny and hot. In the south: sunny and hot. – Thursday 1. In the north: thunderstorms in the Triveneto, especially the mountains and then on the Friulian and eastern Veneto plains. In the center: sun and peaks of 38°C. In the south: lots of sun and lots of heat. – Friday 2. In the north: scattered thunderstorms, especially in the mountainous Triveneto. In the center: sun and peaks of 37°C. In the south: lots of sun and lots of heat. Trend: slight drop in temperatures, some showers in the center.

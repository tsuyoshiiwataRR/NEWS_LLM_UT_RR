The heat index will exceed 105 in many locations, with a few spots breaking 110. An excessive heat warning is in effect for I-95 and points east. A head advisory is in effect west of I-95 for a heat index possibly exceeding 105.\nScattered storms will increase later in the afternoon through the evening. Any storm that develops will produce heavy rainfall, and could contain strong gusts.\n(WTVR) Saturday will have highs in the lower 90s, and a heat index 95-100. Scattered storms will be around at times. The threat for heavy rain and isolated strong gusts will continue.\nHighs Sunday will be around 90, and a heat index 94-98.

    "text": "The National Hurricane Center reported that there is a 70% chance that Invest 97L will become a tropical depression. (NHC)\nHe Governor of Florida , Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in 54 of the state’s 67 counties in preparation for the possible arrival of the storm Invest 97L The decision is intended to anticipate a potential “significant threat” at the start of what could be a violent hurricane season.\nAs detailed Tallahassee Democrat, DeSantis signed an executive order Thursday citing the imminent danger of heavy rain across much of Florida, with forecasts indicating the possibility of up to a foot of precipitation over the next seven days, which could cause severe flooding in rivers and other vulnerable areas of the state. According to the order: “Water tables in the affected areas are already near capacity and the coming heavy rains will cause significant river flooding that could last for several weeks.”\nFor its part, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported that there is a 70% chance that the storm Invest 97L develop into a tropical depression within the week, either near Florida or over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The agency added that there is a 30% chance of development occurring in the next 48 hours.\nThe local media FOX 35 Orlando explained in its coverage that this tropical system was generating a wide area of ​​disorganized showers and thunderstorms in areas such as Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and the southeastern Bahamas. The weather service warned that although the storm might not evolve into a major hurricane, the intense rains could leave Florida without power for several days and cause possible damaging flooding.\nThere is a 30% chance that Invest 97L will become a tropical depression within the next 48 hours. (NHC)\nIn a post on the social network X, Governor DeSantis urged residents to follow the guidelines issued by the Florida Division of Emergency Management and local officials. “Florida is monitoring Invest 97L in the Atlantic, which is expected to strengthen and potentially make landfall this weekend. It will move slowly and bring abundant rainfall that could lead to significant flooding. I encourage all residents to prepare for the storm and follow all guidance issued by @FLSERT and local emergency management officials,” the governor wrote.\nGovernor DeSantis’ executive order not only seeks to act quickly in response to the risk of severe weather, but also allows greater flexibility for state and local governments to coordinate their emergency agencies and relax bureaucratic restrictions and procedures, thereby ensuring a more efficient response to the climate threat.\nRon DeSantis The order is accurate in mentioning that the declaration of a state of emergency makes it possible to more expeditiously mobilize and reallocate resources to confront imminent dangers that local services cannot handle on their own. In addition, the order designates the Executive Director of the Division of Emergency Management as the state coordinating officer, granting him the authority to execute the state’s Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan as well as other plans necessary to address the emergency.\nLos condados declarados en estado de emergencia incluyen: Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Calhoun, Charlotte, Citrus, Clay, Collier, Columbia, Dixie, Duval, Escambia, Flagler, Franklin, Gadsden, Gilchrist, Gulf, Hamilton, Hernando, Hillsborough, Holmes, Jackson, Jefferson, Lafayette, Lake, Lee, Leon, Levy, Liberty, Madison, Manatee, Marion, Monroe, Nassau, Okaloosa, Orange, Osceola, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Putnam, Santa Rosa, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Johns, Sumter, Suwannee, Taylor, Union, Volusia, Wakulla, Walton y Washington.\nGovernor DeSantis posted on social media X urging people to follow emergency guidelines for Storm Invest 97L. (REUTERS/Marco Bello)\nHe NHC and other experts are urging residents along the Gulf Coast and Atlantic coasts of the United States to keep a constant watch on the system. Additionally, meteorologist Noah Bergren from the storm team of FOX 35 noted: “Everyone in Florida should keep a close eye on the weather as a tropical system could strengthen as it passes over historically warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, with lighter wind shear aloft. At least a tropical storm surge is now likely. Details regarding possible additional strengthening, specific tracks, any loss of lift, and the area of ​​greatest impact are still unclear. That said, it appears that Sunday, Monday, and next Tuesday are the prime timeframes for direct tropical impacts on Florida.” Florida ”.\nThe executive order also highlights the importance of keeping all state, regional and local government agencies informed about the measures they must take in response to the emergency, formally prohibiting excessive pricing of essential products needed in the event of an emergency. In addition, the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation has the authority to suspend the collection of tolls and the Florida National Guard is activated to assist with necessary operations.\nFor those interested in learning more about the full executive order, the details are available on the Florida Governor’s website.",

The cities have issued red warnings for high temperatures. The heatwave is attributed to global climate changes, with forecasters predicting continued high temperatures across multiple provinces. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 02-08-2024 16:03 IST | Created: 02-08-2024 16:03 IST Mega-cities on China's eastern coast are bracing for another spell of scorching heat, with temperatures reaching around 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) as of Friday. Experts anticipate prolonged extreme temperatures extending into next week. Shanghai's Meteorological Center issued its first red warning signal for high temperatures this year after the city hit 40C on Thursday. This marks the 22nd day of temperatures over 40C since the Xujiahui weather station started recording data in 1873. Nearby Hangzhou also issued a red warning on Friday morning, with several districts experiencing 40C temperatures. A red warning represents the most severe in a three-tiered system. \"It's so hot, like fire falling from the sky,\" said Wang, a 60-year-old tourist from Hebei, noting the intense heat despite a hot wind. The European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service documented China's hottest July on record, with July 22 being the hottest day ever recorded. Warnings for high temperatures have been issued for various parts of the country, including Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Chongqing, and Shanghai, where temperatures are expected to range between 37-40C. Experts link these treacherous heatwaves to global climate changes affecting worldwide weather patterns. \"It's so hot and I am sweating all the time,\" said Li Wen, a 22-year-old tourist in Shanghai. \"Everyone is wearing sun protection shirts, holding parasols, and taking precautions against the sunshine.\" The nation is enduring another summer of extreme heat, with weather experts predicting hotter and longer heatwaves in the foreseeable future.

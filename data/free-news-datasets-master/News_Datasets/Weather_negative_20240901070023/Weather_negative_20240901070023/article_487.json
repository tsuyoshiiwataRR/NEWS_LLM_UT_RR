    "text": "Ireland’s short-lived summer weather is coming to an abrupt end for the Bank Holiday weekend. Forecasters are expecting sun, wind, rain and even a chance of localised flooding in some areas. Heavy rain will begin to move across the west of the country later this morning. Saturday could be the driest day for most of the country. The Irish Weather Channel’s Cathal Nolan said there could even be weather warnings issued for rain. “For Sunday and Monday, it’s two overcast days,” he said. “We see heavy breaks of rain on both days. “There is a risk of some weather warnings being issued due to the nature of the rain - it will be very heavy in some parts with a risk of flooding.” Sunnier places However, the weather will not impact the hundreds of thousands of Irish people who have opted to travel abroad for the bank holiday. 120 thousand passengers are expected at Dublin Airport on Sunday alone and its car park is completely sold out. At Cork Airport, passenger numbers are up 5% with 65,000 expected to use it this weekend. “We’re well prepared for the August Bank Holiday weekend,” Communications Manager Barry Holland said. “We’re well resourced, well staffed and passengers can expect a very friendly and a convenient experience when they do fly from Cork Airport over the course of the weekend.” Mr Kenny added that passengers should make sure they arrive at the airport “in plenty of time” given the volume of traffic.

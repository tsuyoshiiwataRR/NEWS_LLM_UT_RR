    "text": "DELPHI — Murder suspect Richard Allen is headed back to the custody of the Carroll County sheriff. The move came in the last couple of minutes of a day that saw more than nine hours of testimony in the case. Thursday’s line of discussion — part of the third hearing this week in the case — included the state’s arguments asking the court to rule against Allen’s defense team bringing up alternative suspects in trial that might have been involved in the February 2017 deaths of Delphi teens Libby German and Abby Williams. But it was Judge Fran Gull’s decision on the defense’s motion to vacate Allen’s safekeeping order from Tuesday that perhaps made the most ripples in Thursday’s hearing. After Gull made her ruling on the defense’s motion, Defense Attorney Andrew Baldwin pumped his fist while he looked over at Allen sitting at the defense’s table. Allen’s family, who has attended every hearing in the case, was also all smiles after the ruling, as was Allen himself. It’s unclear whether Allen will now be housed at the Cass County Jail — where he’s been staying during this week’s hearings — or another local facility as he awaits his October jury trial. However, Carroll County Sheriff Tony Liggett on Tuesday did mention he has had discussions with Cass County Sheriff Ed Schroder about possibly housing Allen at his facility until the end of the trial. That ends a long length of stay for Allen in the Indiana Department of Corrections’ prison facilities. Shortly after his November 2022 arrest, Allen was housed in the Westville Correctional Facility in LaPorte County. Then, in December 2023, Allen was moved to the Wabash Valley Correctional Facility in Sullivan County. In her last-minute ruling Thursday, Gull left it up to Liggett to determine where best to place Allen, but she made it clear it won’t be back at WVCF. And while the last couple minutes provided the day’s biggest ruling, both sides in the case spent most of Thursday discussing and debating whether Allen was allegedly involved in the case at all. According to Baldwin, one of the main arguments the defense is using to make their claim about alternative suspects in the case is German’s phone, particularly her phone at 4:33 a.m. Feb. 14, 2017. That was just a few hours before the girls’ bodies were found by the Monon High Bridge area near downtown Delphi. The defense argues the prosecution has claimed the girls were killed somewhere between 2:30 and 3:30 p.m. Feb. 13, 2017. But in his testimony Thursday, Indiana State Police First Sgt. Chris Cecil stated German’s phone movement stopped at 2:32 p.m. It never moved again, Cecil testified, nor did any text messages to German’s phone come through. But then at 4:33 a.m. the next morning, the defense argued that German’s phone turned “on,” and pinged a nearby tower. More than a dozen text messages also came through to German’s phone at that time, something the defense argued was due to the phone — and possibly the girls themselves — being moved and then brought back to the area. The defense also brought back up their argument for the possible third-party involvement of Odinists in connection with the girl’s deaths, months after saying German and Williams were “ritualistically sacrificed” by members of the Nordic pagan religion. Baldwin and fellow Defense Attorney Bradley Rozzi made those claims in a 98-page memorandum filed last year, which said the girls’ bodies were “positioned,” with “runes” laid upon their bodies and in the area around them. However, the prosecution Thursday attempted to debunk that theory. Patrick Cicero of the LaPorte County Sheriff’s Office testified Thursday he is an expert in blood spatter analysis, and admitted he was not at the scene in 2017 because he wasn’t called to help investigate the case until earlier this year. But Cicero did tell the court Thursday that the crime scene, what he has seen in photos, was consistent with an alleged crime and not a ritualistic sacrifice. To help prove his theory, Cicero testified that the upside down “L” that the defense believed was an Odinist marking on a tree found near the crime scene was likely just the result of “transfer” from one of the girls during the incident. And the sticks that the defense thought were “runes” were more than likely just there to try to cover the girls up, Cicero said. Gull will now take each of the motions presented during this week’s hearings under advisement. There is currently no timetable for when rulings will occur. Allen’s month-long jury trial starts Oct. 14 with several days of jury selection. That process will take place inside the Allen County Circuit Court before moving to Carroll Circuit Court for the rest of the proceedings. According to Gull, 600 jury questionnaires were sent this week to residents of Allen County. Those questionnaires are expected to be received next week, with a deadline of Aug. 23 for them to be handed over to attorneys. It was Feb. 14, 2017, when the bodies of German and Williams were found near the Monon High Bridge area in rural Carroll County. In November 2022, Allen was arrested and charged with two counts of murder and two counts of felony murder for his alleged connection to the case.",

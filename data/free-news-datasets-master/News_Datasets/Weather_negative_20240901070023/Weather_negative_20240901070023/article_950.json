    "text": "Local News North Texas enters the weekend with the hottest day of the year By Scott Padgett\nUpdated on: August 2, 2024 / 9:38 AM CDT / CBS Texas\nHeat advisory extended into fifth day for North Texans Heat advisory extended into fifth day for North Texans 02:44 NORTH TEXAS â€“ Plan for the hottest day of the year Friday with a forecast high temperature of 103 degrees.\nThe cloud cover in place Friday morning was from storms in Oklahoma overnight and into the morning being blown down into North Texas.\nCBS News Texas Storms developed Thursday along a frontal boundary that is slowly moving south. With the northerly flow aloft on the east side of the mid to upper-level high pressure, the clouds Friday morning and the front are both moving southward.\nCBS News Texas However, drier air in the mid-levels will scour out any cloud cover, making for an afternoon of full sunshine and hot temperatures. High temperatures will warm to the triple digits for most of North Texas and feel slightly warmer than that thanks to lower dew points.\nIf temperatures in North Texas reach 103 degrees on Friday, not only will it be the hottest day of the year so far but also the tenth 100-degree day in 2024. North Texas is well behind the average of 20 100-degree days this year but will quickly approach that number in the week ahead. Friday is a day to pay attention to any heat illness warning signs as this dangerous heat builds.\nCBS News Texas Since the high temperature is forecast up to 103 degrees and a feels-like temperature up to 107 degrees, the National Weather Service extended the heat advisory that was issued on Monday until 8 p.m. Friday for most of North Texas.\nCBS News Texas There isn't much relief in sight with this weak front on the way. Rain chances dropped to just 10% for Saturday. A front is expected to move into North Texas early Saturday morning and continue to move south through the day. There are better rain chances in the forecast for Central Texas later Saturday afternoon as the front stalls to the South. The \"cool down\" won't really happen until Sunday when high temperatures drop to the upper 90s.\nCBS News Texas This weekend will be a hot one but a good one for the kids to get in some pool time before heading back to school. Then the August heat dome builds next week with triple-digit heat on the way each day of the forecast.\nCBS News Texas More from CBS News Saharan dust continues to linger over Dallas-Fort Worth, creating hazy skies The hottest day of the year so far is ahead for North Texas Heat advisory continues across North Texas Saharan dust keeps temperatures just below 100 degrees in North Texas 2-year-old reported kidnapped in North Texas found safe: Police In: Weather Forecast First Alert Weather North Texas Scott Padgett Chief Meteorologist Scott Padgett joined CBS 11 in September 2013.\nTwitter Facebook",

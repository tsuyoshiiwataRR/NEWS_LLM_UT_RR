    "text": "“Let’s hope it’s not always like this”: with these words Paolo Sottocorona greeted Omnibus viewers and released the latest weather forecast. What was he referring to? To the “few clouds” and the possibility of new rains that fade away day after day because the heat is getting the better of it. Things are, however, a little better. “Yesterday’s forecast predicted a total absence of precipitation in the Alpine areas. Today, something changes”, he anticipated. In the Alpine area, in fact, “there is the possibility of isolated but significant phenomena in the afternoon hours”, he explained. “Then, there is a small spot in the area of ​​Lake Garda”, he specified.\nInstability will also be present tomorrow, “although reduced”. In the Alps “there are many phenomena. Once again, something from Trentino descends towards the plain”. What is happening in the Centre and South? “Needless to say”: the expert was telegraphic. On Thursday, however, “there is a beginning of change”, he warned. In the North-West areas, there are some isolated phenomena. “Strong instability in Trentino Alto Adige, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna”, continued the meteorologist. Precipitation could be “very abundant”. Finally, minimum temperatures are always “high”.\n#Weather #Sottocorona #speaks #heavy #precipitation #Tempo\n2024-08-01 23:33:57",

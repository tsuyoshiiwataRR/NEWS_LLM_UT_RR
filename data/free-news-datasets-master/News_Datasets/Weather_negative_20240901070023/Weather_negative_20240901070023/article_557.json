    "text": "SHREVEPORT, La. - An excessive heat warning will be in effect until 8 p.m. Friday in most of the ArkLaTex. Afternoon heat indices could reach as high as 112 degrees in some locations. Actual high temperatures across the region could reach triple digits. Precautions are strongly encouraged if outdoor activities are planned. High temperatures kill hundreds of people every year. Heat-related deaths and illness are preventable, yet more than 700 people die from extreme heat every year in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check on relatives and neighbors. Young children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles under any circumstances.

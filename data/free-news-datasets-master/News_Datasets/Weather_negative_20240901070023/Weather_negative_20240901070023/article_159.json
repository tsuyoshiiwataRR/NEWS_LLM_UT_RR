    "text": "Gale-force winds damage crops and homes southwest of Lincoln\nCorn that used to stand over 6 feet tall is now swept over in a field near Dorchester.\nJust 10 miles to the east, Dan Nerud was a lot luckier.\n\"It's not a disaster by any means,\" Nerud said.\nHowever, the Saline County farmer figures that the 60 to 70 mph wind also caused considerable damage to his fields.\n\"On the bottom of the slope where the wind bursts, the gusts hit. There's a lot of broken corn in there,\" Nerud said.\nRelated coverage: Videos show aftermath following Wednesday's destructive thunderstorm in Omaha area\nA closer look showed how strong down drafts selectively picked some rows and snapped any hope of developing a crop.\n\"Here's what you see through the field. We've got a few rows here that or just broke down, that are just broke over,\" Nerud said.\nThe highest wind gusts Wednesday were clocked at 92 mph in Denton.\nSue and Gary Bales recorded rain and trees whipping in the wind on their cellphone.\nIt left trees down and a greenhouse just west of town crumpled.\nIn Crete, Vera Patton was watching TV in her living room when the storm came.\n\"I heard the wind. And I didn't think anything of it, and then all of a sudden, boom,\" Patton said.\nThat \"boom\" was a giant oak tree crashing on her home.\nIt took off part of her roof. One branch poked through the dining room ceiling where the 87-year-old had been sitting just moments before.\n\"I was just in a shock. I couldn't believe it,\" Patton said.\nList: Highest wind gust reports from Wednesday's severe storms in Nebraska, Iowa\nIt was just starting to sink in that she can no longer stay the home and neighborhood she lived for over 60 years.\n\"It's not livable,\" Patton said. \"I know that I can't go back in there. I can't live in there. Just a lot of memories.\"",

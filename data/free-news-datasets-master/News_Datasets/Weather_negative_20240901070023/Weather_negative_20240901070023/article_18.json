    "text": "Powell County and Granite County have moved to Stage 2 fire restrictions due to extreme temperatures and very little precipitation. The following was sent out by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks: Most Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks properties in west-central Montana are now under Stage II fire restrictions. Powell and Granite Counties were the latest to move to Stage II earlier this week. FWP-managed properties in Powell and Granite Counties include: Missoula, Mineral and Ravalli Counties remain under Stage II restrictions, and Deer Lodge and Lewis and Clark Counties are in Stage I. Under Stage I and II restrictions, building, maintaining, attending, or using a fire or campfire at FWP sites is not allowed, even in metal fire rings, unless posted as an exemption under Stage I. Smoking is prohibited except within an enclosed vehicle or building, a developed recreation site, or while stopped in an area at least three feet in diameter that is cleared of flammable materials. Recreationists may cook on a liquid petroleum gas or propane stove that can be turned on and off. Stage II restrictions also prohibit operating lawn mowers, weed trimmers, chainsaws and other internal combustion engines from 1 p.m. to 1 a.m.; welding or operating acetylene or other torch devices with an open flame between 1 p.m. and 1 a.m.; using an explosive between 1 p.m. and 1 a.m.; and operating motor vehicles off designated roads and trails, with exceptions for those carrying out official business related to the function of governmental agencies and public utilities. These restrictions at FWP sites will be in place until further notice. Due to dry conditions and high fire danger FWP urges people to use caution while they are out recreating.",

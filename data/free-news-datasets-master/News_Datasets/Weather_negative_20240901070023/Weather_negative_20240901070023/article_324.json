Friday, 02 Aug 2024 11:28 AM MYT TOKYO, Aug 2 — Japan sweltered through its hottest July since records began 126 years ago, the weather agency said, as extreme heatwaves fuelled by climate change engulfed many parts of the globe.\nTemperatures in the country were 2.16 degrees Celsius higher than average, breaking last year’s record for July of 1.91 degrees Celsius above average.\n“It was the highest since statistics began in 1898,” the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said yesterday, noting that the figures were “considerably higher” nationwide.\nOf 153 observation posts across Japan, 62 broke their average temperature record in July.\nContributing factors included a high-pressure system over the Pacific and “warm air from the south” that shrouded northern parts of the archipelago, the JMA said.\nSince April, heatstroke has killed 59 people in Japan, according to the disaster management agency.\nParasols and chunky necklaces that can be stored in the freezer have been a common sight around Tokyo, where street performer Jiro Kan, 56, told AFP he was feeling the heat.\n“After spending two hours standing here, I get so sweaty I can literally squeeze it all out from my shirt. I’m drenched,” said Kan, dressed in an all-yellow suit.\n“People who are used to a more dry type of heat like in the United States find the heat and humidity in Japan more difficult to handle,” he said in tourist hotspot Asakusa.\nLast month, Shizuoka west of Tokyo became the first Japanese region to see the mercury reach 40 degrees Celsius this year — far surpassing the 35-degree threshold deemed “extremely hot” by authorities.\nHeatwaves are becoming increasingly common across the globe, with the European Union’s climate monitor saying in July that the Earth experienced its warmest day in recorded history. — AFP\n You May Also Like Related Articles\nWorld / 1 m ago Blinken cites ‘overwhelming evidence’ for Gonzalez Urrutia’s win, as US urges Venezuela to release voting data\nWorld / 13 m ago Manila Chinatown inferno claims 11 lives\nWorld / 1 h ago Kamala Harris set for Democratic nomination as Trump faces backlash over ‘birtherism’ remarks Just IN\n5 m ago Palestine liberation rally at Bukit Jalil this Sunday with PM Anwar, come and show your support, says Fahmi\n18 m ago After formal Brics bid, PM Anwar says will meet Putin in Russia soon\n23 m ago Nenggiri by-election: Candidate nominations open tomorrow",

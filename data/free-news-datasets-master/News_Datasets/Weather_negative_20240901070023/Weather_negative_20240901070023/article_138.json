    "text": "Excessive Heat Warning issued for Friday SHREVEPORT, La. (KSLA) - Scorching heat & humidity continues across the ArkLaTex with no end in sight. For tonight, it’s more of the same with warm and muggy conditions. Overnight lows will remain in the mid 70s under a mostly clear sky. It’s rinse & repeat for Friday with temperatures soaring close to 100 by afternoon. A slight uptick in the humidity could make it feel even hotter with feels like temperatures potentially soaring above 110! Avoid being outside if possible and if you do venture outdoors, drink plenty of water. Unfortunately, the slight chance of storms for the weekend has decreased even more and it looks like sunny, hot and humid weather will continue right through the weekend. Highs both Saturday and Sunday will soar into the upper 90s with heat index values remaining in the triple digits. Looking ahead to next week, no relief in sight with more extreme heat & humidity. Highs will likely soar into the triple digits Tuesday through Thursday with feels like temperatures continuing to approach 110 each day. Little if any rain is in sight for at least the next seven days. Have a great evening! -Chief Meteorologist Matt Jones Copyright 2024 KSLA. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "On Thursday, Aug. 1, sweltering heat and humidity in Upstate, South Carolina made doing much outside dreadful. The thermometer outside of the Spartanburg Community College Union Campus showed 95 degrees Fahrenheit just before 2:30 p.m. on Thursday. In Union, News 13 caught up with crews mowing the grass and weed-eating outside the old Union Oil Mill preparing the property for sale. While they were not going to let the heat stop their progress, they were taking plenty of breaks. WEATHER WARN DAYS AHEAD: HIGH HEAT INDEX, TEMPERATURES AT NEAR-RECORD LEVELS \"With the rain we've had over the last couple of weeks, the grass has almost gotten out of control so the guys were just: 'Hey, let's get it done.' I was just like: 'We have to be careful making sure we hydrate, stay in some shade and just get some water kind of that the same time,'\" said Andre Smith, property owner and partner. Crews hoped to finish the work before severe weather rolled in. HEAT SAFETY TIPS FOR PEOPLE AND PETS The work is part of the Union's redevelopment effort and includes plans to open a steakhouse restaurant in partnership with Trevor Booker, who played basketball at Clemson and in the NBA. Anyone interested in the Old Union Oil Mill property can contact Andre Smith at [this email](deeandre2700@gmail.com).",

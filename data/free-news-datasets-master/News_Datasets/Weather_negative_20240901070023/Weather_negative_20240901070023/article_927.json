To stay safe, drink plenty of water regularly, even if you don’t feel thirsty. Avoid leaving children or pets in parked vehicles, as temperatures can rise dangerously high in a short period.\nWhat to Wear: Light and Breathable Today’s extreme heat calls for lightweight, breathable clothing. Make sure to stay hydrated and take frequent breaks if you’re outside. For the cooler evenings, a light jacket or sweater might be handy.\nFun Weather Fact Did you know that heat warnings are issued when temperature or humidity levels pose a significant risk of heat-related illnesses like heat stroke?

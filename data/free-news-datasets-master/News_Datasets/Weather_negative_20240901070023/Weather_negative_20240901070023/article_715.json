    "text": "Friday, August 2: Central India has experienced a remarkable 33% increase in rainfall compared to the average, a trend that has persisted for three consecutive monsoon seasons. This has proven advantageous for the region's farmers, who rely heavily on monsoon rains for crop cultivation. \"The consistent and abundant rainfall over the past three monsoon seasons has led to noticeable improvements in crop conditions and overall agricultural productivity,\" emphasised IMD Chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra. The current meteorological conditions indicate further rainfall in the coming days. A cyclonic circulation is present over northeast Rajasthan and its neighbouring areas in the lower tropospheric levels. Additionally, a monsoon trough extends from Sriganganagar, Rohtak, Hardoi, Varanasi, Dehri, Bankura, and south-eastwards to the eastern Bay of Bengal. Meanwhile, a low-pressure area lies over Gangetic West Bengal and adjoining Jharkhand. As a result, fairly widespread to widespread light to moderate rainfall, accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning, is expected over the region for the next five days. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecasted isolated extremely heavy rainfall over Madhya Maharashtra and East Madhya Pradesh on August 2-3, and over Konkan-Goa, West Madhya Pradesh, and the Gujarat region on August 3. Additionally, heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely at isolated places over Konkan-Goa, Madhya Maharashtra, and the Gujarat region from August 2-7; over Madhya Pradesh from August 2-4; and over Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh on August 2-3. Saurashtra-Kutch are also expected to receive heavy rainfall on August 3-4. Accordingly, IMD has placed a red warning (meaning, 'take action') over Madhya Maharashtra and East Madhya Pradesh on August 2-3, Chhattisgarh on August 2 and West Madhya Pradesh on August 3. Rajasthan and Coastal Maharashtra will be under an orange alert (meaning, 'be prepared') on August 2-3, and Gujarat on August 2. ** For weather, science, space, and COVID-19 updates on the go, download [The Weather Channel App](https://weather.onelink.me/2902176432/ca9eb560) (on Android and iOS store).

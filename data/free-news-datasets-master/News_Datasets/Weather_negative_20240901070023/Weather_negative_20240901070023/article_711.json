    "text": "The National Weather Service issued a weather alert at 6:04 a.m. on Friday for strong thunderstorms until 6:30 a.m. for Higher Elevations of Indiana as well as Jefferson and Indiana counties.\nResidents may experience wind gusts of up to 40 mph.\n\"At 6:04 a.m., Doppler radar tracked strong thunderstorms along a line extending from 6 miles northwest of Punxsutawney to 6 miles north of Belsano. Movement was northeast at 25 mph,\" according to the weather service. \"Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.\"\nLocations impacted by the alert include Punxsutawney, Reynoldsville, Sykesville, Falls Creek, Big Run, Rossiter, Marion Center, Cherry Tree, Glen Campbell, Dixonville, Commodore, Rochester Mills and Anita. This includes Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania between mile markers 93 and 96.\nThe weather service adds, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.\"\nPreparing for approaching lightning: Expert safety advice Each year, lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times, with the majority of these electrifying events occurring during the summer months. Unfortunately, lightning is responsible for claiming the lives of approximately 20 people annually, as reported by the weather service. The threat of lightning becomes more pronounced as thunderstorms draw nearer, peaking when the storm is directly overhead and gradually waning as it moves away.\nTo ensure your safety during a thunderstorm, consider the following recommendations:\nLightning safety plan:\nWhen venturing outdoors, it's crucial to have a lightning safety plan in place. Stay vigilant by monitoring the sky for ominous signs and listening for the telltale sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's a clear indication of nearby lightning. Seek shelter promptly in a safe location, preferably indoors. Indoors safety measures:\nOnce you're indoors, avoid using corded phones, electrical devices, plumbing fixtures, and stay away from windows and doors. Lightning can follow conductive pathways, and these precautions reduce the risk of electrical surges. Wait for the all-clear:\nAfter the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. It's important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution. When indoor shelter isn't available:\nIf you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:\nAvoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk. Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In wooded areas, stay close to lower stands of trees. If you're in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people. Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If no alternative exists, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. Remember that a tent offers no protection against lightning. Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. While water and metal don't attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks. In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, vigilance and preparedness are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the chances of lightning-related accidents and prioritize your safety.\nRainy roadways ahead: Essential safety tips for heavy rain When heavy rain strikes, safety is paramount. Equip yourself with these guidelines from the weather service to navigate wet roads and avoid hazards:\nBeware of swollen waterways:\nDuring heavy rain, avoid parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a serious risk.\nMaintain safe driving distances:\nUse the two-second rule to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you and allow an extra two seconds in heavy rain.\nReduce speed and drive cautiously:\nIf it is raining and the roads are wet, slow down. Take your foot off the accelerator and let your speed drop gradually. Never use the brakes suddenly because this may cause the car to skid.\nChoose your lane wisely:\nStay toward the middle lanes - water tends to pool in the outside lanes.\nPrioritize visibility\nEnhance your visibility in heavy rain by activating your headlights. Be particularly vigilant for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.\nWatch out for slippery roads:\nThe first half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mix of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\nDon't follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely.\nMind your windshield wipers:\nOverloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots.\nWhen stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.\nIn the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

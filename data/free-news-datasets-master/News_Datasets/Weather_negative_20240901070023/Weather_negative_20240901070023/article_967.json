An Excessive Heat Warning will go into effect for the District and I-95 Corridor and points southeast, with a Heat Advisory for most of the DMV until 8 p.m. Heat and humidity combined will make it feel much hotter than the actual air temperature. The heat index could make it feel as hot as 110 degrees in some areas. In addition to the heat, there is a chance for showers and storms, anytime between 5 p.m. - 11 p.m. There is a small chance for one or two of the storms to become strong to severe, producing strong gusty winds. Some storms may also produce heavy rain, which could make it difficult to see while driving or lead to water ponding on the roads. Storms will be spaced out, so not everyone will see a storm.

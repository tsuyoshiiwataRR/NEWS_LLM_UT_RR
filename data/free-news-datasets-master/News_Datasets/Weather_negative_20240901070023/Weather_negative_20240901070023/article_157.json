    "text": "Severe Threat Ends But Rain Lingers\nSevere Threat Ends But Rain Lingers\nCANCELED TONIGHT BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER OUT THERE. LET’S GET RIGHT ON OVER TO CHIEF METEOROLOGIST KEVIN ROBINSON. WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT TONIGHT. HOW NASTY DO YOU THINK THINGS COULD GET? WELL, YOU KNOW, AS WE LOOK AT THE RADAR RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF OUR OVERALL SEVERE THREAT, YOU KNOW, I CAN’T HELP BUT QUESTION JUST HOW INTENSE THESE STORMS WILL BE. I THINK THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE PLENTY OF LIGHTNING WITH ANY STORMS THAT GO UP. AND THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE POCKETS OF TORRENTIAL, VERY HEAVY RAINFALL. IN FACT, LOCALIZED FLOODING COULD BECOME MAYBE THE GREATEST ISSUE WITH SLOW MOVING NATURE OF SOME OF THESE STORMS. AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE I DON’T THINK THERE’S GOING TO BE JUST A LOT OF BIG WIND WITH THIS SYSTEM. YES, YOU KNOW, MAYBE A COUPLE OF GUSTS HERE AND THERE. BUT NOTICE HOW THE NORTHERN END OF THIS LINE IS JUST REALLY STRUGGLED TO GET ITS ACT TOGETHER PRETTY MUCH ALL DAY. NOW MOST OF THE ACTION IS ACTUALLY FARTHER TO THE SOUTH. BASICALLY, AS YOU HEAD DOWN INTO CARROLL COUNTY, PARTS OF OWEN COUNTY, THAT’S WHERE THE ACTIVITY IS A LITTLE MORE ORGANIZED TONIGHT. SO IT’S REALLY GOING TO STAY. I THINK THE MOST INTENSE WEATHER YOU CAN SEE IT HERE, PROBABLY GOING TO STAY CLOSER TO LEXINGTON, MAYBE SCOOTING ACROSS PARTS OF OHIO AND SOUTHERN GRANT COUNTIES. BUT IN TERMS OF THOSE OF US UP CLOSER TO THE OHIO RIVER, IT JUST LOOKS LIKE WE MAY GET IN ON SOME RAIN AND THUNDER THIS EVENING AROUND HERE. SO YOU CAN SEE HOW WE’VE HAD THESE SPOTTY DOWNPOURS TRYING TO GO UP AND SOUTHEAST INDIANA. BUT NOTHING HAS SEEMINGLY ORGANIZED ITSELF JUST YET. THERE ARE ADDITIONAL BIG DOWNPOURS GOING UP. LOOK AT THAT RIGHT OVER DOWNTOWN CINCINNATI. THE VILLA HILLS LAKESIDE PARK COMMUNITY. THESE ARE BEGINNING TO GO UP. WATCH OUT. A LITTLE LIGHTNING WILL PROBABLY START TO POP OUT OF THOSE HERE AT ANY MOMENT. BIG DOWNPOURS GONE UP NORTH OF MONROE, NORTH OF WESTCHESTER, UP TOWARDS THE MASON AREA AND THEN UP TOWARDS HILLCREST AND IN THE LAMONI AREA, OVER TOWARDS MONROE. YOU CAN SEE THIS SLOW MOVING DOWNPOUR THAT IS BASICALLY DRIFTING RIGHT OVER INTERSTATE 75. SO WE’LL KEEP AN EYE ON THE RADAR. THERE’S A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM. WATCH OUT UNTIL 8:00, BUT AT THIS POINT, I THINK SEVERE WEATHER WE MAY LUCK OUT. KEEP IT AT A MINIMUM HERE. THIS EVENING. IT IS AWFULLY STEAMY OUT THERE. THAT’S WHY I CAN’T TAKE IT OFF THE TABLE ALTOGETHER. SOMETIMES THESE LINES CAN FIND THAT LITTLE EXTRA JUICE AND TRY TO INTENSIFY BRIEFLY. WE’LL KEEP AN EYE ON THAT AROUND HERE THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS, BECAUSE THERE’S PLENTY OF FUEL FOR THESE STORMS TO WORK WITH. ALL RIGHT. HERE’S FUTURECAST. YOU’LL SEE THIS COMING THROUGH. THERE’S A LOOK AT 730. TAKE YOU TO 8:00. TAKE YOU TO NINE. SO BY NINE, A LOT OF THIS IS PULLING OUT OF HERE. I THINK WE’RE STARTING TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS. IT’S QUIET MOST OF THE NIGHT. I WOULDN’T RULE OUT A STRAY DOWNPOUR OVERNIGHT AFTER THIS ACTIVITY ROLLS THROUGH, BUT GENERALLY QUIET AND DRIER. SO TOMORROW MORNING, A FEW HIT AND MISS DOWNPOURS AROUND THE AREA IS WHAT I WOULD EXPECT, AND THEN PROBABLY MORE DOWNPOURS FOR THE AFTERNOON. OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN SEE OVER MY SHOULDER I JUST SHOWED YOU ON RADAR THAT BIG DOWNPOUR OVER DOWNTOWN CINCINNATI. LOOKS LIKE THERE’S A LITTLE BIT OF WIND INVOLVED WITH THAT THERE. JUST BASED OFF THE FLAG. AND YOU CAN KIND OF SEE HOW THE SHEETS OF RAIN ARE BEING DRIVEN. IT’S 87, SO IT’S NOT RAINING AT THE AIRPORT. SO THAT’S KIND OF THE NATURE OF THIS STUFF. SOME OF US WILL SEE BIG DOWNPOURS, OTHERS JUST SOME RAIN AND A LITTLE THUNDER. SO WE’LL KEEP THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS IN THE FORECAST THROUGH ESPECIALLY 9:00. AND THEN I THINK IT KIND OF TAPERS OFF FOR A MUCH QUIETER OVERNIGHT AS A WHOLE. 70 BY MORNING TOMORROW 86, WE’RE GOING TO KEEP IT ANOTHER WEATHER IMPACT DAY AS I THINK SCATTERED STORMS SHOULD BE PRETTY WIDESPREAD AGAIN, ESPECIALLY DURING THE AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING HOURS. NOT A WASHOUT. IT WILL START TO DRY OUT FRIDAY EVENING. THE TENDENCY WILL BE FOR STORMS TO FADE AWAY FRIDAY EVENING AS THE SUN GOES DOWN. WE’RE GOING TO KEEP THE LINGERING STORM THREAT INTO THE DAY ON SATURDAY. BUT I THINK SATURDAY AFTERNOON WE’RE STARTING TO DRY OUT. IT GETS HOT GOING INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW 90S. BEFORE WE SEE TEMPERATURES COOL OFF.

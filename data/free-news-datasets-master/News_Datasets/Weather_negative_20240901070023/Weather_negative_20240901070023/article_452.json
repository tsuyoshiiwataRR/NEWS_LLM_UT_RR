    "text": "Lighting strikes golf at Olympics! The weather troubles have not spared golf in the City of Lights. On Thursday, round 1 was suspended at 10:26 a.m. ET due to lightning in the area. Leaving 19 players hanging who were yet to take the greens. After a 39-minute delay, the round was resumed at 11:26 a.m. ET.

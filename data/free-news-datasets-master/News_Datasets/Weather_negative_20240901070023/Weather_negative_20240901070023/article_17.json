    "text": "KALISPELL, Mont. â€” The Flathead County Sheriff's Office continues to search for 33-year-old Emily Rea, who has been missing since July 16 in the Hungry Horse Reservoir. \"Emily's paddleboard was found upside down in the Flossy Creek area, more than two miles west of the Riverside Boat Launch, on the evening of July 17th. Weather reports show a westerly wind on the reservoir the night of the 16th, consistent with the paddleboard's location. Her paddle was found stowed and assembled on the board. Her cell phone was not with the board and last pinged on a tower reachable on the South Fork Road between Martin City and the Riverside Boat Launch, with the time of the ping consistent with her travel from the last security camera sighting to the Riverside Boat Launch.\" The following was sent out by the Flathead County Sheriff's Office: The Flathead County Sheriff's Office continues the search for Emily Rea, who has been missing since the evening of July 16th. Based on cell phone data, security camera footage, and her vehicle's location at the Riverside Boat Launch parking lot, it is believed Emily was alone when she put her paddleboard into the Hungry Horse Reservoir sometime after 8:30 PM at the Riverside Boat Launch, located 21 miles up the Southfork Road on the east side of the reservoir. Emily's paddleboard was found upside down in the Flossy Creek area, more than two miles west of the Riverside Boat Launch, on the evening of July 17th. Weather reports show a westerly wind on the reservoir the night of the 16th, consistent with the paddleboard's location. Her paddle was found stowed and assembled on the board. Her cell phone was not with the board and last pinged on a tower reachable on the South Fork Road between Martin City and the Riverside Boat Launch, with the time of the ping consistent with her travel from the last security camera sighting to the Riverside Boat Launch. The Flathead County Sheriff's Office has deployed multiple Search and Rescue units, including K9 teams, boat teams equipped with sonar and underwater robots, ground teams, Two Bear Air, drone teams, divers, and more. To date, Sheriff's Office personnel have spent more than 1,800 hours searching for Emily. We have also received assistance from the US Forest Service, Montana Fish and Game, Lake County Sheriff's Office, Lincoln County Sheriff's Office, Glacier National Park, and several other agencies and independent resources. Over the past two weeks, deputies have received numerous follow-up reports and tips regarding the search for Emily. Unfortunately, none of the tips received have provided new substantiated information beyond what has already been reported. Efforts to locate Emily are still ongoing. During the search for Emily, the Sheriff's Office has also responded to several other rescue calls. On Sunday, July 28th, while boat crews were actively searching for Emily, a call was received for a male who had entered the water in the Wounded Buck area of the Hungry Horse Reservoir. The boat crew responded to the scene, more than five miles away, but was unable to locate the victim. On Monday, July 29th, boat crews and divers located and retrieved the deceased body of the victim, identified as 63-year-old Randel Gilpen of Bigfork. Glipen was not wearing a life jacket when he entered the water. Additionally, on Sunday the 28th, Flathead County deputies, Evergreen Fire, Creston Fire and Flathead Search and Rescue responded to a call where a kayak had flipped and victims were trapped on a log on the Flathead River. Responding crews successfully rescued a 42-year-old male and a 12-year-old female during the incident. The rescued individuals were not wearing life jackets. Flathead County is a fantastic place to enjoy the outdoors. With approximately 5,200 square miles of area and many square miles of recreational water, the Sheriff's Office respectfully requests that boaters and swimmers use life jackets for safety.",

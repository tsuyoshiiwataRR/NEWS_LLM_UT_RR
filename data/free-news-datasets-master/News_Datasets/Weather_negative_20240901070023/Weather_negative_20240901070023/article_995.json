    "text": "By Gillian Morán Pérez ,\n1 hour ago\nStay cool and stay hydrated -- it's going to get really hot this weekend. (Courtesy NWS) We made it to Friday people! In the forecast today — high temps and sunny skies. But this weekend, the heat will ramp up.\nForecasters say there's still a chance of thunderstorms this afternoon for the mountains, especially over the eastern San Gabriel Mountains and eastern Antelope Valley. That's prompted a red flag warning — keep reading to learn why.\nDaytime highs for the beaches will be in the 70s with partly cloudy skies this afternoon and in the upper 80s to low 90s for the inland coast. Expect a high of 91 degrees today in Anaheim.\nInland areas including valleys will see highs between 93 to 102 degrees. In the low desert expect a high of 112 degrees and up to 102 degrees in the high desert.\nAbout those advisories\nExcessive heat\nWe're looking at excessive heat this weekend for most of the Southland. Starting tomorrow, residents in the Inland Empire, deserts and Santa Ana foothills will experience high temperatures in the upper 90s, up to 108 degrees for Riverside and San Bernardino and up to 118 degrees for the low desert. Come Sunday morning, temperatures will rise for the L.A. and Ventura county mountains and valleys where daytime highs will reach up to 103 degrees.\nRed flag warning\nForecasters have issued a red flag warning for the mountains and deserts in L.A. and Ventura counties due to a small threat of thunderstorms, strong winds and chance of lightning. All of those conditions increases the risk of igniting new wildfires or spreading any ongoing fires. The warning is scheduled to end tonight at 8 p.m.\nOdor advisory\nThe South Coast Air Quality Management District reports that residents in eastern Coachella Valley will experience a rotten egg like odor for the next few days due to elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide. Officials say the gas smells like rotten eggs but is a natural process out of the Salton Sea. Officials say southeast winds will increase the smell during daytime hours, especially for cities north of the Salton Sea like Mecca and Indio. The odor should die down by Tuesday.\nThis day in history On this day in 1873, inventor Andrew S. Hallidie successfully tested the first cable car for San Francisco.\nThings to do It's Food Friday!:\nMy colleagues Yusra Farzan and Gab Chabran take a tasting tour through Little Arabia in Anaheim. From shawarma to mandi to manoushe — Little Arabia has more than enough to take your tastebuds on a delightful journey. An Evening With John Legend: Could the smooth sounds of piano wizard and writer of everyone’s wedding song. John Legend at the Greek be anything other than…legendary? Snuggle up under the stars for a summertime date night. The OC Fair is underway and if you're looking for another reason to go this weekend (other than deep fried Oreos and funnel cake), my colleague Jill Replogle reports that customers can take a virtual plunge through one of SoCal's offshore oil platform. Check out our full list of things to do this weekend.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Guwahati: As of the end of July, which marks the midpoint of the monsoon season, four out of the seven northeastern states in India have experienced normal rainfall since the season began on June 1. However, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicts below normal rainfall for the northeast region during the latter half of the southwest monsoon season, spanning from August to September. This decrease in rainfall is already evident in the July data.IMD data reveals that Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura received normal rainfall from June 1 to July 31, while Nagaland, Manipur, and Mizoram were categorized as deficit. Focusing on July specifically, Meghalaya was the only state to receive normal rainfall, albeit with a 19% deficit, which the IMD still considers within the normal range.The overall rainfall departures for June and July were as follows: Arunachal Pradesh (-19%), Assam (-5%), Meghalaya (1%), Nagaland (-26% ), Manipur (-48%), Mizoram (-32%) and Tripura (-11%).July witnessed a decrease in rainfall intensity, with states previously classified as normal based on the combined June and July rainfall now falling into the deficit category. In July, Meghalaya remained in the normal category but with a 19% deficit, while the other six northeastern states shifted to the deficit category. Manipur experienced the highest departure at 42%, followed by Arunachal Pradesh at 31%. Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura each recorded a July departure of 26%, while Assam and Meghalaya saw departures of 21 and 19%, respectively.In a release on Thursday, the IMD stated, “During the second half of the monsoon season, normal to above normal rainfall is most likely over most parts of the country except many parts of northeast and adjoining areas of east India, Ladakh, Saurashtra & Kutch, and some isolated pockets of central and peninsular India where below normal rainfall is likely.” We also published the following articles recentlyIndia to record above-normal rainfall in August and September: IMDIndia was forecasted to experience above-average rainfall in August and September, with favorable La Nina conditions anticipated. IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra indicated that some regions might see below-normal rainfall. The monsoon is vital for agriculture, with 52% of cultivated area dependent on it. July saw nine percent higher rainfall than average.112190376This July received highest recorded rainfall in 124 yearsIn July, Goa recorded its highest rainfall in 124 years with a mean total of 1,986mm, surpassing previous records. The India Meteorological Department issued nine red alerts due to extreme rainfall. Key regions like Valpoi and Sanguem experienced seasonal totals well beyond 3,000mm. June and July have both exceeded their climatological averages, hinting at an exceptional monsoon season.112176861Punjab, Haryana witness intense rainfallHeavy rainfall brought relief from humid weather in Punjab and Haryana, with temperatures dropping two to four degrees below normal.

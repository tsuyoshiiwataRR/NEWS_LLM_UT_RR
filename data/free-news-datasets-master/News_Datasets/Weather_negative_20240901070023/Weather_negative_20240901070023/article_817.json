    "text": "I would point to my VHS copy of The Simpsons: Too Hot For TV to serve as a visual metaphor for how uncomfortably warm London has been all of this week, but it’s melted into a pool of molten plastic, which I suppose will also serve, to be honest. Also hot? This week’s links? Below? — Ian MacEwan (@ianmacewan) [August 1, 2024] This week’s news. • More allegations of sexual assault and coercion against writer Neil Gaiman [were made public this week](https://www.thebookseller.com/news/neil-gaiman-denies-new-sexual-assault-and-abuse-allegations-by-two-women), as two women detailed their accusations on the podcast Master: The Allegations Against Neil Gaiman, and another woman made public claims of being groomed and manipulated on the podcast [Am I Broken: Survivor Stories](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/s4-ep2-claire-i-ignored-it-and-i-believed-him-because/id1491575384?i=1000663604978) - Gaiman has denied the allegations. • The California Department of Justice and the San Diego Human Trafficking Task Force [this week announced](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-rob-bonta-san-diego-human-trafficking-task-force-target-human) that a human trafficking sting operation carried out during last week’s San Diego Comic-Con, which was aimed at “recovering victims of sex trafficking and targeting sex buyers using the San Diego Comic-Con Convention to seek out potential victims,” resulted in 14 arrests and the recovery of 10 victims of human trafficking - SDCC organisers [stated that](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-31/human-trafficking-sting-san-diego-comic-con) “While we were not made aware of this operation, it is our understanding that the arrests were made outside of the event.” • In less fraught SDCC news, the winners of this year’s Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards were announced last Friday, with Mariko Tamaki and Jillian Tamaki taking home three prizes for Roaming, Becky Cloonan receiving awards for The Kelpie and Somna (with artist Tula Lotay), and the Will Eisner Spirit of Comics Retailer Award going to Florida’s Blackbird Comics and Coffeehouse, while The Comics Journal #309 took home the prize for Best Comics-Related Periodical/Journalism - a full list of this year’s winners [can be read here](https://www.comic-con.org/awards/eisner-awards/). • Elsewhere, cartoonist Roz Chast [has been announced](https://apnews.com/article/brooklyn-book-festival-2024-roz-chast-ad0a0e04b1cb2acda12ac12b792604fc) as the recipient of this year’s Brooklyn Book Festival Best of Brooklyn award, and the National Cartoonists Society announced that Bill Hinds [is to receive](https://nationalcartoonists.com/honoring-bill-hinds-with-the-gold-t-square-award-for-50-years-of-tank-mcnamara/) the organisation’s Gold T-Square award in recognition of 50 years of the syndicated daily comic strip Tank McNamara. • Nikkei Asia reports on mangaka-turned-Politician Ken Akamatsu, creator of Love Hina and now a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, continuing [to float ideas](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Artificial-intelligence/AI-companies-should-share-revenue-with-manga-artists-Japan-lawmaker) regarding the protection of artists from artificial intelligence companies, mooting the possibility for such companies to set aside revenue to reinvest in creative industries - Akamatsu has previously spoken about the possibility that AI companies may be [breaching copyright law](https://www.siliconera.com/manga-artist-ken-akamatsu-discusses-japanese-copyright-law-and-ai/) with their image generation, and suggested [other policy responses](https://restofworld.org/2023/generative-ai-japanese-politicians-manga/) that may be needed to protect creators’ rights. • At the opposite end of the spectrum is Forbes' reporting on former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick's [new venture Lumi](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianshepherd/2024/07/25/colin-kaepernick-is-launching-an-ai-company-for-creators/), which is, apparently, and I quote, “leveraging AI to streamline the creative process for comic books and manga, and could open up new avenues for storytellers who have traditionally faced high barriers to entry in the publishing world,” which it turns out is the exact combination of words needed to make me seriously consider flinging my phone into the Thames, so that I never have to run the risk of reading it again. • In memoriam, remembering those the world of comics has lost, and [news was shared](https://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2024/08/01/la-mort-d-andre-juillard-maitre-discret-de-la-bande-dessinee_6263896_3382.html) this week of the passing of artist André Juillard, illustrator of Sept Vies de l'Épervier, and several volumes of the Blake and Mortimer series, amongst others, who has died at the age of 76.

KAIJ [pic.twitter.com/8Ts3czZev9] — SMALL PRESS EXPO (@SPXcomics) [July 18, 2024] This week’s reviews. TCJ • Jamey Keeton reviews the striking setting of Jasper Jubenvill’s [Dynamite Diva #4: The Engine Whispers](https://www.tcj.com/reviews/dynamite-diva-4-the-engine-whispers/) - “It has a level of heart to it that belies the violence and gore found throughout. It gets at something deeper, something transformative. It gestures at a paradoxical thesis that even anti-heroes carved from, and colored by, genre stuff—thriller, action, detective, vigilante, exploitation—can not only be redeemed but they can also be healed.” • Helen Chazan [reviews](https://www.tcj.com/legacy-comics-two-new-alternative-funnybooks/) the sharp wit of Joe Matt’s Peepshow #15 and the ribald humour of Caroline Cash’s PeePee PooPoo #1: The First Issue - “There is no “end” to alternative comics. Indeed, there may have never been an end to the underground. What has arrived is a new generation of cartooning, one looking back on the alternatives with the same askance view that the alternative cartoonist of the 90s looked back on comix of the 60s.” AIPT • Kevin Clark reviews the mediocre selection of BOOM!

It just creates a more dynamic space. [WESTVIND:] There’s something so alluring about the potential for relationships when you start putting images together. It is very enticing. It encourages you not to write things and really just to put things down and see what happens.” AIPT • Ryan Sonneville speaks with [Gene Luen Yang](https://aiptcomics.com/2024/07/29/sdcc-24-gene-luen-yang-talks-books-of-clash-lunar-new-year-love-story-and-more/) about The Books of Clash and Lunar New Year Love Story and telling stories across genres. • Gary Catig talks to Top Shelf's [Leigh Walton](https://aiptcomics.com/2024/08/01/top-shelf-productions-leigh-walton-sdcc/) about the publisher's sweet spot for connecting with readers and the upcoming The Moon and Serpent Bumper Book of Magic.

More information on our website: [https://t.co/pRQ6IiKbyz] [#scottishcomics] [#scottishcomicbookday] [#smallpress] [pic.twitter.com/x15GESzRXH] — Selkie Awards (@selkieawards) [July 19, 2024] This week’s features and longreads. • Here at TCJ, Andrew Farago writes [in remembrance of artist Michael Zulli](https://www.tcj.com/michael-zulli-1952-2024/), illustrator of The Puma Blues, who passed away last month at the age of 71 - “Zulli alternated indie and Vertigo comics with mainstream favorites like Spider-Man and Batman, and brought the same level of care and attention to each project.” • Also for TCJ, Bart Hulley [reports from Strasbourg](https://www.tcj.com/drawn-to-strasbourg-france-the-world-book-capital-for-2024/), documenting the city’s comic book heritage, its museums and exhibitions, and selected highlights of its street art scene - “Coincidentally, in January 2025, I will begin teaching a new course called \"European Graphic Novels\" at the Syracuse University abroad faculty in Strasbourg. We’ll be studying visual storytelling from a European perspective and, I hope, meeting some of the world’s future stars of cartooning – who will surely be found wandering around somewhere in the vicinity of the Cathedral, soaking up its inspiration. “ • Finally for TCJ this week, Chris Anthony Diaz shares photographs from Comix Experience’s [35th birthday party](https://www.tcj.com/comix-experiences-35th-anniversary-party-a-photo-report/), which took place in March of this year - “When it first opened, it mainly carried mainstream comics and some indie comics and zines. Now, it fully stocks just about everything published by every cartoonist who released something in any format and length and genre (and is not out of print).” • For Nikkei Asia, Echo Wong reports on the popularity of Nagano’s manga [Nanka Chiisakute Kawaii Yatsu](https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Tea-Leaves/China-s-stressed-young-people-find-solace-in-Japanese-manga) with readers in China, and why the book resonates in a nation with rising youth unemployment. • Over at The Hollywood Reporter, Roy Thomas writes on why Roy Thomas [receiving a co-creator credit](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/wolverine-co-creator-roy-thomas-deadpool-and-wolverine-1235962212/) for the character of Wolverine is the correct course of action, actually, but still complains over the resultant billing order and how 'Roy Thomas' should have appeared first. Classic. • For ICv2, Rob Salkowitz reports from [last weekend’s San Diego Comic-Con](https://icv2.com/articles/columns/view/57478/san-diego-comic-con-2024-the-good-the-bad-ugly), and details the status quo of a cultural juggernaut that’s trying to build a head of speed back up, post-pandemic. • For Solrad, Tom Shapira [compares and contrasts](https://solrad.co/returning-to-the-scene-of-the-crime-tom-shapira-on-torpedo-1936-and-torpedo-1972) the anti-romanticism of Enrique Sánchez Abulí and Jordi Bernet’s Torpedo 1936 to Abulí and artist Eduardo Risso’s sequel Torpedo 1972. • Latonya Pennington writes for Shelfdust on Mildred Louis’ [Agents of the Realm](https://shelfdust.com/2024/07/31/the-sweet-maturity-of-romance-in-agents-of-the-realm/), examining how the webcomic is influenced by, but also builds upon and departs from, the traditions of the magical girl genre. • From the world of open-access academia, [for Dive-In](https://dive-in.unibo.it/article/view/20099), Camil Valerio Ristè analyses Shirono Honami’s I Want to Be the Wall and Isaki Uta’s Is Love the Answer? in the context of rising numbers of media in Japan that discuss asexual and aromantic identities. • In New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia, Linda Berube, Ernesto Priego, Stella Wisdom, Ian Cooke, and Stephann Makri [present results from a study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13614568.2024.2374291#d1e495) aiming to understand how readers experience and respond to digital comics and the devices used to access them. • For the Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics, Mark Hibbett writes on the triplicate existence and evolution of The Beano’s [Dennis the Menace](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21504857.2024.2384439?src=exp-oa), and how these three ages of Dennis show the character’s changing with the times across nearly 75 years of publication. • Paul O’Brien’s survey of the villains of Daredevil continues, for [House to Astonish](https://www.housetoastonish.com/?p=10198), as this week the Man-Bull sees red before being put out to pasture. • Mike Peterson rounds up the week’s editorial beat, over at The Daily Cartoonist, as drawings of [Trump and Biden](https://www.dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2024/07/26/csotd-before-after-and-juxtaposed/) gave way to illustrations of [Vance](https://www.dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2024/07/28/csotd-satire-lies-and-misstatements/) (and sofas) and [Harris](https://www.dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2024/07/29/csotd-wouldnt-you-prefer-a-good-game-of-tegwar/) (and the Olympics) and then [Trump](https://www.dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2024/08/01/csotd-flaming-dumpster-causes-massive-train-wreck/) (again). — Paul (@PaulJonMilne) [August 1, 2024] Those are all of this week’s links, back next week with more, and a return of the audio/visual selection, as most of the usual suspects were absent this week, which is fair, in the aftermath of SDCC, and I’ve uhhhr been watching 16 hours of Olympics programming a day.

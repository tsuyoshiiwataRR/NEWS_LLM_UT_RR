    "text": "Excessive Heat Warning issued August 2 at 4:29AM PDT until August 2 at 8:00PM PDT by NWS Pendleton OR * WHAT…Dangerously hot conditions with temperatures 102 to 108 degrees. This will pose a major risk of heat-related illness. * WHERE…Portions of central, north central, and northeast Oregon and central, south central, and southeast Washington. * WHEN…Until 8 PM PDT this evening. * IMPACTS…Extreme heat will significantly increase the risk of heat-related illnesses for much of the population, especially those who are heat sensitive and those without effective cooling or adequate hydration. Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles under any circumstances. Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when possible. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location. Heat stroke is an emergency! Call 9 1 1. For sheltering information and other human services in your area, dial 2 1 1 during business hours or visit 211info.org for Oregon or wa211.org for Washington anytime.",

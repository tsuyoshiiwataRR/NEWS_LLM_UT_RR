    "text": "South Korea Baseball Game Cancelled Due to Extreme Heat: A Historic First South Korea's professional baseball league cancelled a game for the first time in its 42-year history due to extreme heat. The scheduled game between LG Twins and Lotte Giants was called off as temperatures soared above 35 degrees Celsius. This marks a significant event influenced by rising average annual temperatures. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 02-08-2024 14:27 IST | Created: 02-08-2024 14:27 IST South Korea's professional baseball league cancelled a scheduled game on Friday due to extreme temperatures. This marks the first instance in the league's 42-year history where a game was called off because of excessive heat. The match between LG Twins and Lotte Giants was to take place in Ulsan, but was cancelled as local temperatures surpassed 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit). The Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) official noted that ground temperatures in the Ulsan stadium exceeded 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the day. The extreme heat event follows a week after the conclusion of the monsoon season, which brought flooding and landslides to the central regions. Experts and officials have indicated that South Korea, which typically has four distinct seasons, is experiencing warmer annual temperatures. Several regions have been under daily heat warnings since July 21, issued when highs surpass 33 degrees Celsius (91 degrees Fahrenheit). (With inputs from agencies.)",

    "text": "Forecasters were more confident Friday that a tropical disturbance over southeastern Cuba would strengthen as it moves toward the Gulf of Mexico and Florida’s west coast.\nIn an 11 a.m. update, federal meteorologists placed the Tampa Bay area under a tropical storm watch, with possible storm surge of up to 3 feet. Southwest Florida, from East Cape Sable to Bonita Beach, was under a storm warning.\nA warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected within 36 hours, while a watch means that storm conditions are possible within 48 hours.\nIn Tampa Bay, that could mean heavy rain and flooding in low-lying areas this weekend through Wednesday morning. River flooding will also be possible, forecasters said.\nA well-defined tropical wave producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms is poised to emerge over the Straits of Florida as a tropical depression, according to a Friday morning update from the National Hurricane Center.\nAs of late Friday morning, the potential tropical storm had maximum sustained winds of 30 mph, with higher gusts.\n“Since the forecast track is almost parallel to the west coast of the Florida Peninsula,” the update states, “only a small change in the track could lead to large changes in which land areas receive any landfalls and the biggest impacts.”\nForecasters cited two big uncertainties: how long the system will stay offshore of Florida and how long it will take to develop.\nThe system had a 70% chance of developing within two days and a 90% chance of doing so within a week, as of 11 a.m. Friday.\nThe Tampa Bay area was under a tropical storm watch, as of a Friday morning update from the National Hurricane Center. [ Courtesy of National Hurricane Center ] Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday evening announced a state of emergency order for 54 of Florida’s 67 counties. In a memorandum, the governor cited the risk of heavy rainfall, river and coastal flooding and the possible risk to critical infrastructure. State of emergency orders help free up resources and will often precede a pending tropical system.\nThe governor also cited forecasts that called for up to 12 inches of rain over Florida throughout the next week.\nRodney Wynn, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Tampa Bay office, said to expect up to 10 inches of rain along coastal areas, particularly in Pinellas County, over the next five days. Rapidly deteriorating marine conditions in Tampa Bay, tornadoes and coastal flooding are also risks.\n“I don’t believe it’s going to be a hurricane. None of the models have it intensifying to that strength,” Wynn said. “Regardless of development, we are going to see those impacts.”\nWynn said the wave is already in warm waters, but may see a boost as it enters the Gulf of Mexico, which has climbed to 90 degrees Fahrenheit this summer.\n“That’s the perfect breeding ground for tropical development,” he said. “But we’ll have to see.”\nIt’s too early to tell where the tropical wave might track as it nears Florida, he added. For now, rain remains the biggest threat.\n“With heavier rainfalls, you might want to make sure you have some sandbags to cordon off certain areas if you’re in a low lying area,” Wynn said.\nWhile there is still a lot of uncertainty with the forecast of the tropical wave, confidence is increasing in a heavy rain event. Forecast rainfall totals for west central and SW FL through Tuesday evening are for up to 6-8 inches along the coast, which would result in flooding. pic.twitter.com/mp05eR2YTk\n— NWS Tampa Bay (@NWSTampaBay) August 1, 2024 As of Friday morning, the center of the storm was about 420 miles southeast of Key West. The storm’s maximum sustained winds peaked at 30 mph and it was moving west-northwest at 16 mph. The system is expected to turn toward the northwest at a slower forward speed Friday night or Saturday, forecasters said. It will likely twist toward the north on Sunday.\nAs news of the storm’s pending arrival spread, local governments began offering opportunities for residents to fill sandbags.

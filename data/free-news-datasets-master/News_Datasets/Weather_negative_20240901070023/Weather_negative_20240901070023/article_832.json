    "text": "Friday, August 2: A weather system that had been brewing over East India as a low-pressure area has formed over Gangetic West Bengal and adjoining Jharkhand. This, coupled with an active monsoon trough, is expected to bring torrential rains to the region. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast extremely heavy rains (more than 204.5 mm) over Bikar, Kharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal and Sikkim. Then, heavy to very heavy rainfall (64.5 mm-204.5 mm) are very likely in isolated parts of Gangetic West Bengal on Friday (August 2); Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura until Tuesday (August 6). Accordingly, a red warning (meaning ‘take action’) has been sounded over Bihar, Jharkhand, and Sikkim, warning of extremely heavy rainfall in these states today. Orange alerts (meaning ‘be prepared’) have been sounded for Gangetic West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, and Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura, indicating heavy to very heavy rainfall. A yellow watch (meaning ‘be updated’) is in place for Odisha and Arunachal Pradesh today. Alerts will change depending on the rainfall intensities in the coming days. The weather department has cautioned residents of these states to be prepared for heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and lightning. The downpour is likely to cause widespread disruption, including localised flooding, waterlogging in urban areas, and traffic congestion. There is also a risk of landslides and crop damage in vulnerable areas. These weather systems are expected to persist for the next few days, with the intensity of rainfall gradually decreasing towards the end of the week. In the meantime, IMD advises people to avoid unnecessary travel during heavy rain, and to follow traffic advisories issued by local authorities. Farmers are urged to take preventive measures to protect their crops from waterlogging. ** For weather, science, space, and COVID-19 updates on the go, download [The Weather Channel App](https://weather.onelink.me/2902176432/ca9eb560) (on Android and iOS store).

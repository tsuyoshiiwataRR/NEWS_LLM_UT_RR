    "text": "|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n 1788 0219 Areas affected...portions of northern/central Indiana into western Ohio Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible Valid 011919Z - 012115Z Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to develop across northern/central Indiana into western Ohio over the next couple of hours. These storms will have potential to produce isolated damaging gusts around 50-65 mph and sporadic hail to near 1 inch diameter. Timing and coverage of severe risk is uncertain, but this area is being monitored for possible watch issuance within the next couple of hours. DISCUSSION...Latest visible satellite imagery shows deepening cumulus within a broader area of mid/high cloudiness across northern/central Indiana. More extensive cumulus development is noted further downstream across western Ohio where clearer skies have persisted. Heating into the mid/upper 80s F amid 70s F dewpoints is supporting moderate instability (1500-2500 J/kg). Midlevel inhibition has also mostly been eroded as a convectively enhanced vorticity max impinges on the region. Continued heating/destabilization should support thunderstorm development within the next hour or two. Vertical shear is somewhat modest, with around 25-35 kt effective shear magnitudes noted in regional VWP data and in mesoanalysis/point forecast soundings. This should be sufficient for organized cells/clusters. Steepening low-level lapse rates amid a favorable combination of instability and shear will foster damaging wind potential. Midlevel lapse rates will remain modest, but a few more intense updrafts may be capable of marginally severe hail as well. ..Leitman/Bunting.. 08/01/2024 ...Please ATTN...WFO...CLE...ILN...IWX...IND...

    "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. â€” Severe storms moved through Louisville again on Thursday with winds that would knock down trees. In St. Matthews, a pick-up truck driver was driving down Grandview Avenue when a giant tree crushed his truck bed. It was a close call for the driver who was behind the wheel when the tree fell. In Jeffersontown, the storms led to property damage. Resident Sierra Edds believes a lightning bolt is responsible for a tree trunk that came crashing down on her home at about 5 p.m. She said it was the first time her family has faced damages as a result of weather. She added that every time she gets in her car, Edds admires her family's \"cute little house.\" \"Now look at it; it's kind of a slap in the face,\" Edds said. Now, they're working to remove the tree and cover the roof with a tarp, as it was punctured by tree branches. She said there were \"ripple effects\" to the damage, including some side panels of the home coming off and holes in the roof. Louisville Metrosafe was overwhelmed with emergency calls Thursday. A backyard garage in Jeffersontown was also crushed. The resident said the tree took down power and data lines with it. He said that because of the damage severity, it could take a while before the lines are reconnected. Numbers peaked at around 15,000 power outages for customers around Louisville. But downpours that began around 4:30 p.m. did not stop Savannah Bananas fans from watching the performance baseball game at Slugger Field in downtown Louisville. \"It's just rain,\" said Savannah Bananas fan Tom Robbins. \"I'm not going to die.\" One family that drove to the game from Indianapolis found a tree limb on their car, but it didn't damage their vehicle. \"It's just fine,\" said Jim Yeater. \"It just barely came down.\" Once the clouds parted, many people found the best in another stormy, summer day.

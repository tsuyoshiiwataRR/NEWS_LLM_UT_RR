    "text": "Excessive heat and keeping close watch on the gulf in your New Orleans weather forecast\nDangerous heat gets even hotter and keeping close watch on a possible tropical system expected to develop in the Gulf of Mexico\nDangerous heat gets even hotter and keeping close watch on a possible tropical system expected to develop in the Gulf of Mexico\nDangerous heat gets even hotter and keeping close watch on a possible tropical system expected to develop in the Gulf of Mexico\nDangerous heat gets even worse and keeping a very sharp eye on a possible hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico in your New Orleans weather forecast.\nFor an in depth discussion on the system expected to move into the gulf,\nclick here.\nLOCAL FORECAST:\nHeat is still our biggest concern for Southeast Louisiana as the heat only intensifies as we heat into the weekend.\nMorning temps are ticking up too. Many of us might not drop below 80, and for those that do we might only realize the 70s for an hour or two.\nThe heat intensifies on Friday where we are under an Excessive Heat Warning. That makes it a WDSU First Warning Weather Alert Day for temperatures that could feel as hot as 115!\nThere is a small chance, 20%, that we find an isolated shower/storms or two.\nI'm expecting just as hot of a day on Saturday, possibly even a bit hotter. However, a front that's nearing the region is forecast to spark scattered storms that could provide some temporary relief.\nI've hot high temperatures still around 97 in New Orleans, so I expect more heat alerts and at least a weather impact day.\nBe sure to find a place to keep cool through this heat wave!\nTROPICAL UPDATE:\nThe latest data is in from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and a system we're montitoring very closely is still a large area of disorganized storm activity.\nThere is now a moderate chance (40%) of tropical development within the next 2 days, but it's a much better chance the system devlops into a tropical depression over the weekend where theres a 70% chance of formation.\nForecast data is now coming in guiding us on its most likely track and how strong it might become. The Bermuda high looks like it will start to track the system north just off the west coast of Florida and become our 4th named storm of the season, Debby.\nWe will be watching this system every step of the way and provide you with the best information as it evolves.\nSEVEN DAY FORECAST:\nI don't see the heat subsiding any time soon. We might get \"slightly\" cooler Sunday and Monday, but only by a degree or two.\n- Devon",

    "text": "Severe weather is forecast across parts of northeastern Spain Aug. 3. Transport, business, and utility disruptions possible. Heavy rainfall and thunderstorms are forecast across parts of northeastern Spain Aug. 3. Strong winds, lightning, and hail may accompany storms. Heavy downpours may trigger flooding in low-lying areas and strong winds could cause property damage and power outages. The State Meteorological Agency (Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia, AEMET) has issued orange thunderstorm warnings across parts of southern Aragon, northern Catalonia, and northern Valencia autonomous communities and yellow thunderstorm warnings across the rest of the affected area. Yellow heavy rainfall warnings are in place across parts of northern and southern Aragon, far northeastern Castile-La Mancha, central and northern Catalonia, and northern Valencia autonomous communities. Authorities will likely issue new alerts or update/rescind existing advisories as weather conditions change over the coming hours. Sustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed stormwater drainage systems. Sites downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly or mountainous areas, especially where heavy rainfall has saturated the soil. Authorities could issue mandatory evacuation orders for flood-prone communities over the coming days. Where significant flooding, landslides, or strong winds impact utility networks, disruptions to electricity and telecommunications services are possible. Floodwaters and debris flows may render some bridges, rail networks, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities could temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. The disruptive weather may cause some delays and cancellations at airports in the affected regions. Flooding could block regional rail lines; freight cancellations are possible in areas with heavy rainfall and potential track blockages. Localized business disruptions are possible in areas impacted by severe weather; some businesses might not operate at full capacity because of damage to facilities, possible evacuations, and some employees' inability to reach work sites. Monitor local media for weather-related updates and advisories. Confirm all transport reservations and business arrangements before traveling in the affected area. Seek updated information on road conditions before driving or routing shipments through areas where severe weather is forecast; plan for possible supply chain disruptions throughout the affected areas. Stay away from elevated streams, creeks, and other watercourses that are prone to flash flooding. Do not attempt to navigate flooded roadways. Exercise caution in elevated terrain due to the threat of landslides. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

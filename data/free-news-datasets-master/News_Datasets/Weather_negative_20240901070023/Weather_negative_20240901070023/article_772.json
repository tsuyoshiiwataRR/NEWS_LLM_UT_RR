    "text": "It's looking like the bank holiday weekend will be a washout with wind, rain and a chance of localised flooding in some areas. The current warm spell is expected to break down as patches of rain and drizzle will affect some parts of the country with heavy rain moving across the west of the country later this morning. Saturday could be the driest day for most of the country. Met Éireann said there will be a lot of dry weather on Saturday, with good spells of sunshine and a scattering of showers. Highest temperatures will range from 16 to 20 degrees. The outlook for Sunday is much worse, with \"heavy and persistent\" rain forecast. There will also be a risk of localised flooding, especially across Connacht and west Munster. For bank holiday Monday, the national forecaster said: \"It'll be mostly cloudy at first on Monday, with further spells of heavy possibly thundery rain, especially across the midlands, east and southeast. While there's some uncertainty as regards how fast the rain will clear, it looks like a clearance to mainly dry, bright weather will have moved into the northwest and west by the early morning and will then extend to most places through the morning and afternoon. \"However the rain may linger in parts of the east and south for much, if not all of the day. Humid with the rain, but it'll turn fresher in the clearance, with highest temperatures of 18 to 22 degrees in mostly moderate, occasionally fresh, southwest winds, veering westerly.\"",

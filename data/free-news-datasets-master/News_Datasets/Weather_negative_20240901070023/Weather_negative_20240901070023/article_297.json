    "text": "- By Deeksha Gour - Published: Fri, 02 Aug 2024 08:15 AM (IST) - Source:JND Delhi Rain Today: Rain lashed parts of Delhi and Noida early Friday morning, with a yellow alert issued for light to moderate rain today. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting intermittent showers in Delhi until August 5 and predicts a cloudy sky with light to moderate rain and thundershowers in the coming days. This respite from the humid conditions follows heavy rains that swept through various areas of Delhi NCR on Wednesday evening. The adverse weather also impacted air travel, with at least 30 flights diverted from Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport and over 100 flights delayed late Wednesday into early Thursday. An airport official stated that the diversions were primarily to nearby airports, with the maximum of 15 flights being sent to Jaipur, followed by nine to Lucknow. Additionally, two flights were diverted to Ahmedabad, three to Amritsar and one to Chandigarh.

Wind shear, which occurs when strong winds with opposing directions and intensities, made it challenging for flights to land at the Delhi airport. The IMD recorded winds touching 45 km/h at the Palam weather station, the closest to the airport, which also recorded 68mm of rainfall between 5:30 pm on Wednesday and 8:30 am on Thursday.

However, the delays persisted for longer due to the cascading effect of the diversions. The disruptions affected flights operated by various airlines, including IndiGo, Air India, Vistara, Alliance Air, Air India Express, American Airlines, Emirates, Akasa Air, and Cathay Pacific, as well as a chartered flight. Airlines took to social media to share information and advisories, with Air India posting a warning that \"Flights to and from Delhi may get affected due to bad weather this evening. Guests are advised to start early for the airport, as slow traffic and waterlogging may delay movement.\"",

    "text": "Weather in Sussex was \"biblical\", residents said, when heavy rain and storms caused flooding on Thursday night.\nThe downpour followed a day of muggy conditions, and the highest temperature of the day, 30.2C, recorded at Wisley, Surrey.\nImages in Surrey showed cars stuck in flood water , while one resident in East Sussex said she had to \"give up\" bailing water out of her home because it was coming in so quickly.\nAnnie Smith, from Forest Row, told BBC Radio Sussex she \"thought the sky was breaking open\" when the first storms hit and that her power went out overnight.\nGeorge Carden/BBC Annie Smith gave up on efforts to bail water out during dramatic flooding She added: \"The rain started and then suddenly a big cry of alarm came up and we all had to start sweeping out and bailing out.\n\"It started to flood pretty dramatically, in about 10 minutes we had water from the front of the garage to the very back door and had to give up.\"\nAn Environment Agency flood alert was in place for Forest Row, but has since been lifted and the water has now subsided.\nThere are still alerts in place in parts of Surrey and Kent, including around Lingfield and Edenbridge.\nGeorge Carden/BBC Holly Aston said the basement flooded at Java and Jazz Cafe Holly Aston, who works at Java and Jazz Cafe in Forest Row, said the venue's basement flooded.\nShe said there was probably about a metre of water in the basement, where the cafe stored drinks and stock, however she said most items were removed without being ruined.\nMs Aston added: \"It was very heavy rain and thunderstorms.\n\"Down the road was completely flooded, the whole road was covered in water.\"\nAnthony Beard described the rain as \"biblical\" and said rain was \"pouring down\" the lane where he lived and into residents' driveways.\nWhile many animals may not like the storms, Mr Beard said: \"My dogs like it, my dogs sit there watching it.\n\"The cat was terrified so we were more conscious of the cat.\"\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .

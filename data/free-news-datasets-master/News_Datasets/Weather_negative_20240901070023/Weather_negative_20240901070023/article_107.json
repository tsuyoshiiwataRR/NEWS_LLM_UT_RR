    "text": "New Delhi: One day of rain measured at 107.6 mm was more than the precipitation recorded in the entire month of Aug in the past two years. While the city’s base weather station, Safdarjung, recorded 91.8mm and 41.6mm of rainfall in entire August 2023 and Aug 2022, respectively, it logged 107.6mm rainfall in 24 hours till 8.30am on Thursday. The normal average for Aug in India Meteorological Department’s data is 233.1mm.Several other stations in Delhi-NCR also recorded over 100mm of rainfall till 8.30am on Thursday in the most widespread spell of heavy rain this season. SPS Mayur Vihar in east Delhi logged 147.5mm, Noida Sector 62 145mm, Gurgaon 119.5mm, Najafgarh in southwest Delhi 113mm, Safdarjung 107.6mm, Lodhi Road in central Delhi 107.5mm and Delhi University in north Delhi, 104.5mm in the 24-hour period.112207094 Some other areas saw heavy rain, among them Pusa where 86mm of precipitation was recorded, Ayanagar 71.4mm, Jagdishpur KVK (Sonipat) 69mm and Palam 68mm in the same period.This was the second time this season when Delhi saw widespread rainfall. On June 28, when the monsoons arrived in the city, Safdarjung logged 228.1mm of precipitation. Three other weather stations — Lodhi Road, Ridge and Palam —also reported rainfall of over 100mm.Since the monsoon trough came close to Delhi on Wednesday, the region witnessed an intense spell of rain with parts of the city experiencing extremely heavy rainfall. However, no rainfall was recorded from 8.30am to 5.30pm on Thursday, except for Pitampura which saw very light rain of 0.5mm.IMD has issued a yellow alert for light to moderate showers on Friday. Naresh Kumar, scientist, IMD, said, “The monsoon trough oscillated marginally on Thursday. Light to moderate rain is likely on Friday.”Wednesday’s rain caused the mercury to dip. The maximum temperature on Thursday fell 4.4 degrees to 33.4 degrees Celsius, a degree below normal. The minimum temperature also dipped from 30.4 degrees on Wednesday to 24.3 degrees, three below normal, on Thursday. The relative humidity oscillated between 63% and 100%.The air quality index also improved on Thursday to 64 from the 96 a day earlier. With rain helping to wash out the pollutants, the air quality was in the ‘satisfactory’ category. It is likely to deteriorate to the ‘moderate’ category on Saturday. The Met department has forecast light to moderate rain on Saturday that may cause minor traffic disruption and water accumulation in low-lying areas and on roads. “Check for traffic congestion on your route before leaving for your destination. Follow any traffic advisories that are issued in this regard. Avoid going to areas that regularly suffer waterlogging,” said IMD.Rain intensity is likely to reduce from Saturday. The Met department has predicted light rain or thunderstorms from Aug 3 to 5 and said the maximum temperature is likely to be around 35 degrees Celsius over the next few days.",

    "text": "Tropical Disturbance Brewing In The Caribbean Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency ahead of possible tropical impacts to Florida. 14 minutes ago Kaitlin Wright , 1/4 2/4 3/4 4/4 MIAMI â€“ Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency ahead of possible tropical impacts to Florida. Invest 97L Tropical Update: What We Know: There is an area of disturbed weather moving over Hispaniola that is now designated as Invest 97L. Development in the short term (next 2 days) is low thanks to land interaction. Confidence is growing that Invest 97L will track into the eastern Gulf of Mexico this weekend and become a Tropical Depression this weekend or early next week as it moves into a more favorable environment. Steering currents are what moves storms. In this case, the steering currents are weak, therefore, this storm could be a very slow mover and produce a lot of rain. Uncertainty:\nThere is no center to this storm yet so computer models are struggling with track and intensity. It is possible this system will stall somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico. It is also possible it will slowly track from the Gulf of Mexico up the southeast coast.\nBottom-line:\nIt is too early for specifics, but this will likely be a big rainmaker for parts of Florida.

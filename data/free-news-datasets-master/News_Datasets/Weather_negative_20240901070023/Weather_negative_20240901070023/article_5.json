    "text": "By Mataeo Smith ,\n2 hours ago New York is expected to brave another heatwave this week into the weekend as scorching temperatures are expected to climb into the 100s, as per the National Weather Service which imposed a heat advisory until Friday night .\nFollowing a warm and beautiful start to the day, there will be intense sunshine with a heat index of roughly 95 to 100 Friday. Nevertheless, for a significant chunk of the region, the National Weather Service has decided to keep the heat advisory in force until 8 p.m.\nA shower or thunderstorm is still possible in the event of active weather, although it appears that most of the region will remain dry. There might be a lone shower outside tonight, but it will be quite warm and sticky. Only the 70s should be expected in the city, with a few 60s in the north and west.\nWest Virginia declares state of emergency amid 'severe' drought conditions\nWorst parts of US impacted by drought mapped as 'dangerous' heat sweeps country\nShowers and thunderstorms are more likely inland in portions of the Hudson Valley and New Jersey. Thus, while the threat remains, you will be better off heading east.\nExpect a tropical atmosphere this weekend, with the possibility of showers and thunderstorms on both days. As of August 2024, the newest climate projection from NOAA predicts that the intense heat would persist through the end of an already oppressively hot summer.\nAugust is the last full month of summer, and according to NOAA's Climate Prediction Center's 30-day outlook, Americans can expect much of the above-average heat that has dominated this summer thus far.\nAdditionally, the forecast indicates that above-average rainfall is anticipated in several areas of the United States due to an active Atlantic hurricane season and the current Southwest Monsoon. The northeastern part of Alaska and the majority of the contiguous US will see above-average temperatures.\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sports and entertainment stories\nThe Southeast, most of the mid-Atlantic, the Northeast, and New England might experience warmer weather. The majority of the country, spanning from the Gulf Coast states to the West Coast, is similarly susceptible, with the inner West states of Utah, Colorado, Nevada, Wyoming, and Idaho having a higher likelihood than the rest.\nIt is predicted that a heat wave will hit the Plains, Southeast, and Gulf Coast states, bringing severe heat to those areas through the following week. The prediction indicates that only the Great Lakes and Upper Midwest will escape the anticipated heat.\nAccording to NOAA's latest outlook, August rainfall totals in several areas of the eastern US, as well as in sections of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, will be above average.\nWith a potential new tropical storm moving toward the Southeast in the first week of August, a busy hurricane season in the Atlantic may easily bring in enough rain to surpass the monthly average precipitation for the last month of summer.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "India is set to receive above average monsoon rainfall as a La Nina weather pattern forms in August and September, the India Meterological Department (IMD) had said on Thursday, hinting at the possibility of more disasters due to higher rainfall. We are moving towards a La Nina weather condition and its impact is becoming visible, said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general of IMD. La Nina will play a role in increased rainfall activity in September, he added. La Niña is a natural weather pattern that cools ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central Pacific Ocean. This usually leads to good monsoon rainfall in India. However, some areas including in eastern, northeastern, central, and southern parts of India may still get less rainfall than usual, as happened in eight states in July.Also Read: Rainfall would be more than 106% for the second part of monsoon across India, says IMD During the second half of the monsoon season, normal to above normal rainfall is most likely over most parts of the country, except many parts of northeast and adjoining areas of east India, Ladakh, Saurashtra & Kutch, and some isolated pockets of central and peninsular India where below normal rainfall is likely, said IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.As per the Met department, India experienced higher than normal rainfall for several regions in July 2024 which is a good sign for agriculture activity. For the second part of monsoon, it predicted that rainfall would be more than 106 per cent. In August, India is likely to receive average rainfall, ranging between 94% and 106% of a figure weathermen describe as the long-period average, Mohapatra said.As per the Met department, India recorded 9 per cent more rainfall than normal in July.",

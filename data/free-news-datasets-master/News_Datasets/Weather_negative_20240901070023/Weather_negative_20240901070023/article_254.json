    "text": "Heavy downpours battered the UK on Thursday evening as almost a month&#039;s worth of rain fell in an hour in some places. A yellow warning for thunderstorms was issued by the Met Office that covered the majority of the UK on Thursday as temperatures soared to highs of 30C. Commuters were left trapped on flooded roads, public transport was delayed and power cuts hit large parts of the country because of the heavy downpours - which were accompanied by &#039;gusty winds, frequent lightning and large hail&#039;. By 8pm on Thursday, New Addington in Greater London had seen the heaviest downpour of the day with 53mm of rain in an hour, according to Met Office data. Average total rainfall for the month of August in the same area is 56mm, the forecaster said. But Brits can look forward to Friday being &#039;mostly dry&#039; and &#039;muggy&#039;, with highs of up to 29C in the south-east England. Drivers faced road closures due to flooded roads across the UK as almost a month&#039;s worth of rain fell in an hour in some places Commuters were left trapped on flooded roads, public transport was delayed and power cuts hit large parts of the country because of the heavy downpours In Guildford, Surrey, a video on social media showed a group of people pushing a car that had become stuck in flood water By 8pm on Thursday, New Addington in Greater London had seen the heaviest downpour of the day with 53mm of rain in an hour, according to Met Office data Following Thursday evening&#039;s heavy rain, 26 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, had been issued by the Environment Agency - 11 of which were in Greater London. One flood warning, meaning flooding is expected, was issued for Kidbrooke Stream at Forest Row in East Sussex. In Guildford, Surrey, a video on social media showed a group of people pushing a car that had become stuck in flood water. Benson Lock in Oxfordshire recorded 30mm of rainfall in an hour while Wisley, Surrey, enjoyed the highest temperature of the day of 30.2C. It comes after the country was beset by scorching weather - with the mercury soaring to highs of over 31C yesterday in Brize Norton, Oxfordshire. A &#039;danger to life&#039; warning is currently in force across much of England and Wales from the Met Office [video_shortcode_video_html_5 src=&quot;https://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/08/01/4949007418907969547/1024x576_MP4_4949007418907969547.mp4&quot;] A person enjoys the weather in Regent&#039;s Park, London, on the hottest day of the year so far People enjoy the warm weather at Clevedon Marine Lake in Clevedon Met Office meteorologist Simon Partridge said: &#039;There&#039;s been very humid air which is why it&#039;s felt so close and muggy as well. &#039;The same air has been over northern France for the last day or two as well - so those heavy thundery showers that they had during the triathlon yesterday morning. &#039;So basically, we&#039;ve been getting the same sort of weather as the Olympics have.&#039; &#039;It will be another very warm, very muggy feeling day and that&#039;s what helps keep a few of those showers going - but it&#039;s not until Saturday where things will feel much fresher across the board.&#039; The Met Office has also confirmed that Britain is currently experiencing an official heatwave and that it is likely to remain very warm for the next few days. Tuesday was the UK&#039;s warmest day of 2024 so far with a temperature of 32.0C (89.6F) recorded in London at both Kew Gardens and Heathrow Airport. But the heat is not set to last into the weekend with temperatures set to return to the mid-20Cs in the South as a band of rain moves through the country on Saturday.",

    "text": "Owerri, capital of Imo State is calm with streets deserted as residents woke up to heavy downpour.\nResidents stayed indoors in defiance of the call for protests, following days of sporadic shootings in Owerri.\nMajor streets and roads were deserted, as there were no human or vehicular movements.\nLEADERSHIP saw residents at the World Bank market panic buy due to the fear that the protest would last long and prevent trading activities.\nOwerri since Monday had been engulfed in shooting spree which has left not less than seven persons dead, including four policemen.\nFleeing gunmen had on Monday shot dead four policemen and a POS operator along Irete.\nOn Tuesday, gunmen shot dead a young man at Amawire, close to Imo State University junction and set ablaze a refuse disposal truck belonging to the Eastern Waste Management Agency.\nThis is even as a man was gunned down at Nwaoreubi by fleeing gunmen.\nHowever, on Wednesday, residents witnessed heavy shootings across the state which forced residents to flee.\nFrom Fire Service Junction, World Bank market, and Okigwe Road just by the Owerri Correctional Centre, there were heavy shootings that made people scamper for safety.\nSources told LEADERSHIP that inmates of the Correctional centre were jubilant thinking there would be a jail-break for their release.",

I FEEL LIKE I’M GOING TO BE DIGGING OUT AGAIN FOR A WEEK. YEAH, THIS IS GONNA TAKE A LITTLE WHILE. I THINK LUKE YEAH, SO MANY STRONG WINDS AND WE’RE COMPARING THEM TO HURRICANE FORCE WINDS A LOT. AND THEY WERE THEY WERE GETTING CLOSE TO ALMOST. HURRICANE TWO STATUS AT THE PEAK OF THIS LINE OF STORMS THAT CAME THROUGH. IF YOU GET A 95 MILE PER HOUR WIND, OUR HIGHEST REPORT WAS 92, BUT 95 WOULD BE HURRICANE TWO STATUS. SO THAT PUTS IT IN PERSPECTIVE A LITTLE BIT. SO THESE ARE ALL THE DAMAGE REPORTS WE HAD OR THE REPORTS NOT JUST THE DAMAGE REPORTS. THE WIND DAMAGE REPORTS ARE THE DARKER BLUE ONES. THE LIGHTER BLUE ONES ARE JUST THE STRAIGHT LINE WIND REPORTS. AND WE HAD ONE TORNADO REPORT RIGHT THERE. UH, THAT WAS IN WESTERN POTTAWATOMIE COUNTY. AND HERE’S A ZOOMED OUT LOOK. YOU CAN SEE TOWARDS SALINE COUNTY. THAT’S WHEN THE STORMS REALLY GOT GOING. THEY REALLY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE WARMTH IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND ALL THE INSTABILITY AS THEY GOT CLOSER TO THE OMAHA METRO. AND OF COURSE, ALL THE REPORTS. RIGHT SURROUNDING, UH, ALMOST A BULL’S EYE ON DOUGLAS COUNTY THERE. HERE’S A LOOK AT THE WIND REPORTS. AND THESE ARE GOING THROUGH, YOU KNOW, THAT HALF HOUR TIME FRAME, THESE ARE ALL FROM OMAHA’S EPPLEY AIRFIELD. FIVE 59 62MPH. AND LOOK, LESS THAN TEN MINUTES LATER, WE’RE AT 90, AND WE SUSTAINED NEAR 90, OR AT LEAST IN THE 80S FOR ALMOST 20 MINUTES THERE. AND WERE ITS SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WIND GUST CRITERIA FOR ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR. SO THAT JUST PUTS IT INTO PERSPECTIVE. IF YOU WERE OUT FOR ANYWHERE FROM 550 TO 630 YESTERDAY, YOU FELT THESE HURRICANE FORCE WINDS. HERE’S A LOOK AT THE POWER OUTAGES RIGHT NOW. AND OF COURSE, THE WIND CAUSED ALL THESE 74,000 DOUGLAS 18,000 FOR SARPY SAUNDERS COUNTY, JUST ABOUT 2500 NOW. SO THAT’S GOING TO BE ONGOING. TRYING TO GET THAT POWER BACK ON THESE NEXT COUPLE DAYS. THERE’S A NICE LOOK AT THIS SUNSET COLORS 78 DEGREES. THE DEW POINT IS STILL A BIT STICKY AT 69. BUT WE HAVE A NORTH WIND. SO THAT SHOULD HELP DRY US OUT A LITTLE BIT. AND NOW THAT THIS SYSTEM IS WELL OFF TO OUR EAST, THAT’S WHAT SPARKED THE STORMS YESTERDAY. WE HAVE THIS NORTH WIND THAT’S COMING BEHIND IT. SO THAT’S USUALLY MORE COMFORTABLE SIGN AS WE LOOK TOWARDS THESE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. AND IT’S WHY WE’RE SO QUIET RIGHT NOW WITH THE CLEAR SKIES. 76 FOR PLATTSMOUTH 73, IN ATLANTIC, 77 FOR LINCOLN FREMONT 76. TEKAMAH 7765 IS WHERE WE START TOMORROW. SO THAT’S A LOT COOLER. YOU KNOW, LAST WEEK WE HAD A LOT OF DAYS. WE STARTED IN THE 70S. NOT GOING TO BE THAT WAY TOMORROW MORNING. FAIRLY COMFORTABLE HEADING OUT THE DOOR AND THEN STILL GOING TO BE HOT FOR THE AFTERNOON WITH A HIGH TEMPERATURE NEAR 91 DEGREES, WHICH TODAY 89 FOR THAT HIGH TEMPERATURE. SO THAT BROKE AN EIGHT DAY STREAK OF 90 DEGREE DAYS OR HIGHER. SO IT LOOKS LIKE FRIDAY WE’RE GOING TO BE RIGHT BACK TO 90 OR HIGHER. CONTINUING SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. IMPACT WEATHER FOR SUNDAY BECAUSE OF THE HEAT 95 FOR A HIGH. HOW ABOUT MONDAY THOUGH? GETTING UP TO 96. SEVERE WEATHER THAT DAY FOR THE EXCESSIVE HEAT THAT’S IN THE FORECAST BY TUESDAY WE DROP THAT DOWN TO 85. THAT WILL BE COMFORTABLE. WE HAVEN’T PHELPS 80S, PARTICULARLY LOW 80S IN A WHILE, WHICH WE MIGHT GET ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY, BUT IT MIGHT COME WITH A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN. BUT AGAIN, WE GOT TO GET THROUGH THAT HEAT ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY.\nAdvertisement\nNOAA Weather Radio transmitters are down across Omaha area, crews working to solve the issue\nThe National Weather Service announced NOAA Weather Radio is down in the metro area.There is no known reason for the transmitters to be down, so there is no estimated restoration time.There is no hazardous weather expected in the Omaha area.The National Weather Service advises people should always have more than one way to receive warnings.Click here for the latest headlines from KETV NewsWatch 7\nOMAHA, Neb. —\nThe National Weather Service announced NOAA Weather Radio is down in the metro area.\nThere is no known reason for the transmitters to be down, so there is no estimated restoration time.\nAdvertisement\nThis content is imported from Twitter.

    "text": "Severe Weather Alerts Across D.C. and Maryland Evening Thunderstorms Loom Over D.C. Area The National Weather Service has issued warnings for the D.C. area as evening thunderstorms are expected to roll through. This weather pattern is likely to disrupt evening plans but will lead to a notable rise in temperatures come Friday. Meteorologists are urging residents to stay vigilant as conditions could become volatile in the early evening hours.\nUpcoming Heatwave Expected Following the thunderstorms, a massive heatwave is anticipated to hit the D.C. metropolitan area. Friday is predicted to be sweltering, with temperatures soaring near the 100-degree mark. The District will experience hot and humid conditions, prompting local authorities to issue advisories to protect public health.\nHeat Advisory Issued for Maryland In Maryland, a heat advisory has been declared, signaling the extreme weather expected on Thursday and Friday. Residents are advised to stay hydrated and limit exposure to direct sunlight, particularly midday. Outdoor activities should be planned with caution during peak heat hours, as local temperatures are expected to mirror those in D.C.\nMaria’s Market in the Mid-Atlantic As temperatures rise, local farmers’ markets, like those in Maryland and Virginia, anticipate a surge in visitors. Producers are encouraged to provide ample shade and refreshment options for attendees to stay cool. This weather also fuels demand for summer produce, particularly fruits and vegetables as families stock up for weekend barbecues.\nEmergency Responders Prepared Emergency responders are on high alert as a combination of thunderstorms and extreme heat could lead to hazardous situations. The community is reminded to check on vulnerable individuals and to be prepared for power outages that can occur with summer storms. Local hospitals and clinics are also gearing up for an influx of heat-related illnesses.",

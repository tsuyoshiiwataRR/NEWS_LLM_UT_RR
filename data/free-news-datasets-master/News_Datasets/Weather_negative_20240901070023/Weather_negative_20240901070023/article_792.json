    "text": "The pattern of hot, humid\nweather with threats of thunderstorms continues Friday and through the weekend in New Jersey.\nTemperatures will climb well into the 90s on Friday with a heat index of 100 degrees or higher in most places, conditions that the National Weather Service describes as “dangerously hot.”\nAny afternoon storms could also be accompanied by damaging winds so power outages can’t be ruled out.\nAll of New Jersey is under either a heat advisory or excessive heat warning through Friday evening. There’s also a marginal risk (1 on a 5-point scale) for severe weather on Friday.\nSaturday and Sunday won’t be much different with highs around 90 degrees and the potential for afternoon and evening storms both days. Flash flooding is a threat with any thunderstorms that form on Saturday, forecasters say.\nRain won’t be nearly as big a threat on Sunday and cloud cover will contribute to conditions that are a bit less stifling than Saturday though “it will still feel fairly unpleasant outside,” the weather service said.\nNewark Liberty International Airport reached 100 on Thursday, breaking the record for Aug. 1. The high Thursday in Trenton was 96, short of the record 99 set in 2002. Temps in Atlantic City climbed to 94, also shy of the top mark of 97 established in 2006.\nHeat advisories and excessive heat warnings for New Jersey:\n- Somerset, Middlesex, western Monmouth, Mercer, Gloucester, Camden, northwestern Burlington: An excessive heat warning is in effect until 8 p.m. The heat index might reach as high as 106 degrees.\n- Sussex: A heat advisory that lasts until 8 p.m. The heat index is expected to climb to 100.\n- Hunterdon, Morris, Warren: The heat index is likely to top out at 103 during a heat advisory that runs until 8 p.m.\n- Ocean, southeastern Burlington: A heat index of up to 104 is in the forecast. A heat advisory expires at 8 p.m.\n- Atlantic, Cape May: The heat advisory kicks in at 10 a.m. and lasts until 8 p.m. The heat index could soar to 105.\n- Bergen, Essex, Hudson, western Passaic and Union: The heat advisory runs through 7 p.m. Saturday as the heat index might reach the upper 90s to near 100.\n- Western Passaic: The heat index will reach the mid 90s during a heat advisory that ends at 7 p.m. Saturday.\nCurrent weather radar\nStories by\nJeff Goldman\nOur journalism needs your support.

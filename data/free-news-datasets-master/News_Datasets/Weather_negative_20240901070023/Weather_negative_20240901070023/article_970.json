    "text": "By Wwj Newsroom ,\n1 hour ago\n(WWJ) — Cleanup efforts are underway after heavy rain overnight left parts of Metro Detroit underwater Friday morning.\nThe overnight rain led to flooding on some roads and major highways across the area.\nWWJ’s Mike Campbell reported the ramp from eastbound I-94 to westbound I-696 between Roseville and St. Clair Shores is “badly” flooded, while the ramp from is WB I-94 to WB I-696 is also closed with slightly less severe flooding.\n“It’s almost to the bottom of the 11 Mile overpass; a bunch of gunk in the water, almost up to the signs. It’s over the freeway walls,” Campbell reported from the scene Friday morning.\nThe flooding caused major backups in the area during the morning commute.\nMeanwhile in Warren, WWJ’s Charlie Langton reported Hoover Road near 12 Mile near Ascension Macomb-Oakland Hospital was flooded. Video from the scene shows at least one car tried to make it through the standing water, but was unable to, while other, larger trucks were driving through it.\nPolice officials say you should never drive through standing water.\nJune Kowalski, who lives in the area of 11 Mile and Hoover, woke up Friday to a flooded basement.\n\"I got up at two in the morning and the thing's flooded right to the door and it's up to the second step,\" Kowalski told WWJ's Charlie Langton. \"I'm 88 years old. What am I gonna do?\"\nThe National Weather Service said two to three inches of rain fell on parts of Metro Detroit this morning. The most was in Wolverine Lake in Oakland County, where about three-and-a-half inches of rain fell in the last 24-hours. More than two inches of rain was reported in Shelby Township, while nearly two inches of rain fell in Farmington and at the Oakland County International Airport in Waterford.\nThe National Weather Service has issued a Flood Warning for the areas surrounding the Clinton River until 9 p.m. Friday.\nThis is a developing story.

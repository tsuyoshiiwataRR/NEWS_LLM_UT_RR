    "text": "BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - Excessive heat is causing buckling and potholes all around the area, but experts say it’s normal for this time. However, it is still causing dangers on the roads. “Bottom line is it put a hole, the pothole knocked all the air out of my tire and put a hole in my tire, and it may have possibly even cracked my rim,” said Daphne Hughes-Alex, a Baton Rouge driver. She travels down Bluebonnet Boulevard every day for work, but on Thursday morning a new pothole popped her tire. “What caught my eye is there was a chunk of cement there, so I went to detour at the last minute, but the cement was on that side and it still caught my tire,” added Hughes-Alex. Potholes can be a result of excessive heat in the area. Experts told us that when temperatures rise, the roads expand, and when it runs out of room the only place it can go is up. “When it gets this hot, and the pressure builds up to a point where it can’t be resisted by the strength of the concrete, it’s going to crack or it’s going to buckle,” said Tom Stephens, Chief Design and Construction Engineer for the Department of Public Works. Bluebonnet is a Baton Rouge city road so public works will handle repairs, but according to the Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD), this year’s extreme heat is causing buckling and potholes everywhere. “It’s really common, it’s happening all across the country right now. So, about once a week or so we are milling down where we can,” explained Rodney Mallett, Communication Director for DOTD. Mallett says they are out trying to find problem spots before they crack or buckle, but sometimes, especially this time of year, it’s inevitable. “On more than one occasion when they get there, you can see where the concrete has just kind of actually spewed out like a volcano,” added Mallett. The pothole on Bluebonnet has since been repaired. Any problems with city or parish roads can be reported to 311 and any problem with a state road can be reported to [DOTDCS@la.gov](mailto:DOTDCS@la.gov).

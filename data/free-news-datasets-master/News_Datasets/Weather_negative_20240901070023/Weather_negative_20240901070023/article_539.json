    "text": "HEAVY rain has leaked through the roof of the iconic Roland Garros at the Paris Olympics.\nThe stadium is a legendary tennis venue and was the setting for\nAndy Murray's last-ever match on Thursday evening.\nHowever, clips have emerged on social media showing heavy rain pouring through the\nRoland Garros roof.\nThe retractable roof was supposed to be on during the evening's competition but it seemed to have multiple areas that allowed water through.\nThis was made worse as a big storm rolled over the stadium which exposed the leaks.\nVideos show water making its way into the arena with supporters trying to move into cover.\nMany fans can also be heard screaming at getting caught in the leak as they did not want to get wet.\nIt was a big storm as lightning and thunder were spotted and heard crashing around at the end of the tennis session.\nOutside the\nstadium, water had started to flood the streets as emergency services arrived to provide aid.\nFans were left in shock as they took to social media.\nMost read in Olympics\nOLYMPICS FREE BETS - SIGN UP OFFERS AND DEAL FOR PARIS 2024\nOne posted: \"Brought the British weather indoors at Roland Garros.\"\nA second wrote: \"There was a storm of such epic proportions this evening that the roof at Roland Garros leaked and the rain tumbled down inside.\"\nA third commented: \"Roland Garros without rain is not Roland Garros.\"\nA fourth said: \"Unbelievable electrical storm over Paris this evening. Havenâ€™t seen anything quite like this for yonks.\"\nAnother added: \"Never seen anything like that with rain coming through the roof.\"\nElsewhere, the Eiffel Tower Stadium was evacuated due to the heavy rain.",

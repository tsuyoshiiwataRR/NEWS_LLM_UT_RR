    "text": "LAHORE:Heavy rain has caused urban flooding in the provincial metropolis here on Thursday. The rain, which leaped over the city early morning continued till afternoon as a result majority of the city localities have turned into mini lakes and water ponds. Heavy rain started in early hours along with strong winds, which uprooted several trees and displaced many boards. The heavy rain paralysed the life in the city and the low-lying areas, main highways and underpasses were submerged in the rainwater. Due to the stagnant rainwater, the vehicles and motorcycles were blocked on the roads. The rain also caused heavy financial loss to the business hubs like Shahalam Market, Akbari Mandi, Ichhra, Ferozepur Road, Multan Road, Liberty Market etc. Rainwater also went into the basements of many buildings in the commercial markets. Rainwater forced its entry into the emergency wards of Services and Mayo Hospitals while it also flooded, Jinnah, Sheikh Zaid and General Hospitals, causing problems for patients and doctors. The ICU at Mayo Hospital was also flooded, causing hardships to patients and their families besides affecting the treatment. The General Hospital was also submerged in the rainwater, which entered the various wards of the hospital. The rainwater caused a big pothole near Shadiwal Chowk in Johar Town. There were rumours on the social media that the district administration has imposed a rain emergency in the City but Commissioner Lahore, during his visit to Wasa head office, categorically ruled out these rumours. He tweeted that citizens should not believe on fake news. LDA officials said the 30 years old sewerage system was too weak to handle such heavy rain. They said the sewerage system would be replaced after the monsoon season and the project was already included in the ADP. Rainwater also inundated majority of the private housing societies where roads were turned into lakes and ponds. The administration of many societies used heavy pumps to drain out rainwater. Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz directed all the administrative officers and Wasa officials to reach the field and issued orders to ensure early drainage of rainwater in Lahore and other cities. The Services Hospital was cleared completely, GPO Chowk, Nabha Road, Railway Station, Empress Road, Waris Road, Chauburji Chowk, Shah Jamal Road, Qurtaba Chowk, Mozang, Ek Morya Bridge were also cleared. The minister said that drainage operation was completed in Gaddafi Stadium, Thokar Niaz Baig, Allah Hoo Chowk, Johar Town, Lakshmi Chowk, Rasul Park, Ali Block Garden Town, Tajpura, Bhatti Gate and Karim Block. Senior minister Marriyum Aurangzeb also visited rain-affected localities and got briefings from the MD Wasa Ghafran Ahmed who was on his toes since the start of the heavy rain. The rainfall also hit hard on the Lesco's open transmission/distribution system of electricity and over 400 feeders were affected across the City. There were some localities where electricity was not restored even after 14 hours. No electricity in Sant Nagar on Dev Smaj Road, Bhatti Gate sub division, since 10am. No power supply for past about 10 hours in feeder Minhaj subdivision, Faisal Town, M Block, Model Town Ext and No power supply for last 14 hours in PIA Shadiwal feeder of Wapda Town Subdivision and Umer Chowk feeder of Green Town Subdivision. Lesco officials said a total of 289 feeders were affected, which included 42 in 1st circle, 90 in 2nd circle, 52 in 3rd circle, 63 in 5th circle, 20 in 6th circle, 17 in 7th circle, one in 8th circle and 4 in Model Division. blic to support sanitation efforts by handing over garbage to LWMC staff rather than disposing of it in the streets. Citizens can report cleanliness-related issues by contacting the LWMC helpline at 1139 or through social media. Provincial Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari in a press conference at the DGPR office Thursday said that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz put all the institutions on red alert. When footage of water came viral in other hospitals, including Services Hospital then water was drained. She told the media that the water filled the Services Hospital because the window was open. The morning footage was played till four o’clock. Although it has been four hours since the water has been drained. The chief secretary and Wasa staff are clearing the water on the roads. False propaganda is being done by watching old footages on social media. Those who have unleashed this unjust criticism on social media should desist from doing so. Criticising the government is done by those who have not shown any performance during their tenure. Many people are feeling the pain on seeing development projects being undertaken during Maryam Nawaz’s government. When there was dengue, the leader of the Muslim Ummah climbed the mountains, the people of KPK died of dengue, but he did not return from the mountain. If something went wrong in the government of Maryam Nawaz or if there was any shortcoming, we did try our best to improve it. The pictures of rain are not only of Lahore but also of different parts of Punjab, including Shakargarh and Rawalpindi. CM Maryam Nawaz is monitoring the situation herself after the rain. 24 people have died in rains in KPK, but we are not playing politics on it. If KP wants to learn then it can learn from CM Maryam Nawaz. After seven hours of continuous rain, important places have been cleared in just less than three hours period of time. Rain situation and drainage process are being monitored by the Safe City cameras. Wherever there was a traffic jam due to rainwater, smooth flow of traffic is being restored. CM Maryam Nawaz is taking each and every moment’s report. Rain water will be drained from all places very soon. While answering questions from the media, she replied that footages were being shared from some colonies, including DHA, which does not fall in the jurisdiction of the Punjab government which aimed to spread negative propaganda against the Punjab government. The footages of the government hospitals that were shared earlier are now clear. As far as the standing of rain water is concerned, it does not only happen in Pakistan, but also in countries like America and Dubai as water stands in case of heavy rain. The CM has asked the relevant departments for formulating a short and long term plans for drainage and storage of rainwater. When Maryam Nawaz completes her term, Punjab will be ahead of Shehbaz Sharif’s previous tenure of the Punjab government. The Tot Batot government had raised the slogan of storing rainwater but closed the files and went home. No plan of ours will remain in the files. She said that some responsibilities also rest with the citizens for the timely drainage of rainwater. If people throw garbage on roads and manholes, the drainage process will be affected. She said that electricity was cut off to protect people from being electrocuted at Jinnah Hospital and other places.

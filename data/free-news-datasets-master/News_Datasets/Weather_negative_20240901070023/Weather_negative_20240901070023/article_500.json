The state government has issued warnings for heavy rainfall in several districts, advising preparedness. Rainfall intensity will decrease from Saturday onward. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Bhubaneswar | Updated: 02-08-2024 12:13 IST | Created: 02-08-2024 12:13 IST - Country: - India Odisha, currently experiencing wet spells, is anticipated to witness more rainfall due to a newly-formed low-pressure area over Gangetic West Bengal and nearby Jharkhand, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). A cyclonic circulation has led to the creation of this low-pressure zone, extending up to 7.6 km above the mean sea level. This system is expected to move west-northwestwards and intensify within the next 24 hours, as per the latest IMD bulletin. The state government has highlighted the risk of heavy rainfall in districts including Jharsuguda, Sundargarh, Keonjhar, Sambalpur, Deogarh, and Bargarh over the next day. Along with this, widespread light to moderate rainfall, thunderstorms, and lightning strikes are predicted for the next five days. However, a senior official noted that the rainfall intensity will lessen from Saturday as the system heads away from Odisha. Odisha's Special Relief Commissioner, Satyabrata Sahoo, has instructed district collectors to be on high alert and prepared for any eventualities arising from the predicted heavy rains.

    "text": "02 Aug 2024 | 05:23 AM UTC Kosovo, Serbia: Adverse weather forecast across the region through at least Aug. 3 Severe weather forecast across Kosovo and Serbia through at least Aug. 3. Flooding and associated disruptions possible. Severe weather is forecast across much of Kosovo and Serbia through at least Aug. 3. Heavy rainfall and thunderstorms are expected across the region. Strong wind gusts, lightning, and hail may accompany storms. Heavy downpours may trigger flooding in low-lying areas, and strong winds may cause property damage and power outages. The Republic Hydrometeorological Service of Serbia has issued the following warnings: Orange thunderstorm and heavy rain warnings (middle level on a three-tier scale): across southwestern Serbia Aug. 2 and southern and central Serbia and Kosovo Aug. 3. Yellow thunderstorm and heavy rain warnings: across the rest of Serbia and Kosovo Aug. 2 and northern Serbia Aug. 3. Officials could update and extend the coverage of weather alerts over the coming days. Sustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed stormwater drainage systems. Sites downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly or mountainous areas, especially where heavy rain has saturated the soil. Authorities could issue mandatory evacuation orders for flood-prone communities over the coming days. Adverse weather conditions could also cause power outages throughout the affected area. The severe weather could contribute to transport disruptions throughout the region. Traffic and commercial trucking delays might occur along regional highways. Strong winds might pose a hazard to high-profile vehicles. Floodwaters and debris flows may render some bridges, rail networks, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities could temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. Severe weather could also trigger flight delays and cancellations at regional airports. Flooding could block regional rail lines; freight and passenger train delays and cancellations are possible in areas with heavy rainfall and potential track inundation. Disruptions triggered by inclement weather and resultant hazards, such as flooding, could persist well after conditions have improved - it could take days before floodwaters recede and/or officials clear debris. Repair or reconstruction efforts may result in residual disruptions if there is severe damage to infrastructure. Monitor local media for weather updates and related advisories. Confirm all transport reservations and business appointments prior to travel. Make allowances for potential localized travel delays and supply chain disruptions where flooding is forecast. Do not drive on flooded roads. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

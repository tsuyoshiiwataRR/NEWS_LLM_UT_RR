    "text": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) - August is Breastfeeding Awareness Month and researchers at the Cleveland Clinic have just released a new study which looked at how time off for mom after birth may influence breastfeeding rates. [This new study shows the length of maternity leave can impact the length of breastfeeding.](https://consultqd.clevelandclinic.org/breastfeeding-duration-in-us-closely-linked-with-length-of-maternity-leave) As we begin Breastfeeding Awareness Month, health care providers with the Cleveland Clinic say what researchers discovered. CG: Dr. Suet Kam Lam/Cleveland Clinic : “We discovered that there was a wide variety of different studies from small studies and other ones that took place in the military and statewide studies as well,\" said Dr. Suet Kam Lam. \"But all of them were unanimous and found statistically significant outcomes and associations with increased breastfeeding duration with longer maternity leaves, which was really exciting.” The team at the Cleveland Clinic that led this research says the American of Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends women exclusively breastfeed for the first six months of a baby’s life. However, that’s not always possible. In some cases, a woman may not have access to maternity leave, so they decide to skip breastfeeding altogether. Or, they may stop early because they find pumping at work to be difficult. The hope from this team is that research like this will support policy changes in the workplace that support breastfeeding, especially for it's health benefits: “For the mother, there's decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, decreased risks of cancers such as breast cancer. And then for the baby, decreased risks of infections like ear infections, lung infections, increased IQ over time, and it's really a dose-dependent relationship. So, the longer you're able to provide breast milk and the longer and the more you're able to give it, the higher those benefits are.” One note from this team, they found that there are big differences in breastfeeding among certain populations. For example they found Hispanic Americans, and Black women have lower breastfeeding rates and less maternity leave. Changing these differences could help enhance a child's future health.",

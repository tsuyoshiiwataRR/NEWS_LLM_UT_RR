    "text": "Britons were forced to ditch their T-shirts and sunglasses in favour of jumpers and jackets last month, as the UK faced the coldest start to July for 20 years. The Met Office has confirmed that temperatures were persistently below average across the UK for the first two weeks of last month. And by 15 July, the mean temperature was 2.0°C below average - in what was provisionally the coldest start to July since 2004. What&#039;s more, England faced 19 per cent more rainfall than average last month. &#039;The start of July continued June&#039;s theme of cooler than average weather, but with the addition of more wet conditions,&#039; Met Office scientist Emily Carlisle explained. The Met Office has confirmed that temperatures were persistently below average across the UK for the first two weeks of last month Britons were forced to ditch their T-shirts and sunglasses in favour of jumpers and jackets last month, as the UK faced the coldest start to July for 20 years. Pictured: spectators at Wimbleon on July 9 Britain&#039;s weather in July Average temperature (°C) Difference from average (°C) UK 14.8 -0.5 England 16.0 -0.4 Wales 14.6 -0.7 Scotland 12.8 -0.6 Northern Ireland 14.0 -0.6 Overall, July was cooler than average in the UK, with average temperatures of 14.8°C - 0.5°C below the 1991-2020 average. While the first two weeks were particularly chilly, temperatures briefly increased in the third week. And by the last week of the month, the highest temperature of the year so far was recorded. This was recorded on 30 July, when people in Kew Gardens and Heathrow basked in 32°C sunshine. Somewhat unsurprisingly, sunshine hours were also below average last month. The UK experienced just 153.7 hours of sunshine - 11 per cent below average - while neither England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales reached their average monthly sunshine. Overall, July was cooler than average in the UK, with average temperatures of 14.8°C - 0.5°C below the 1991-2020 average While the first two weeks were particularly chilly, temperatures briefly increased in the third week, while the last week of the month saw the highest temperature of the year so far.

However, England pulled the short straw, recording 79.0mm of rain - 19 per cent higher than average. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, meanwhile, were all slightly drier than average. &#039;Low pressure across the UK led to unsettled weather at the beginning of the month and several frontal systems brought bands of rain,&#039; Ms Carlisle explained. &#039;Areas of southwest, southeast and northeast England had already received more than the average July rainfall by the 15th.&#039; Unfortunately, things aren&#039;t looking much better for August. In its long range weather forecast (6 August - 15 August), the Met Office forecasts &#039;changeable&#039; weather. &#039;Low pressure across the UK led to unsettled weather at the beginning of the month and several frontal systems brought bands of rain,&#039; Ms Carlisle explained England pulled the short straw, recording 79.0mm of rain - 19 per cent higher than average.

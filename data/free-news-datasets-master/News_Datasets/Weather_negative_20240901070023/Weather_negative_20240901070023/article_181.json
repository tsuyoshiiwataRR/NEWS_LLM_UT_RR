    "text": "A Severe Thunderstorm Watch is in effect until 8 PM this evening for Greater Cincinnati and all counties south and west. CINCINNATI (WKRC) - The event touts itself as North America's largest paddling event. This year, organizers say 2,000 people will gather on the banks of the Ohio River Saturday for the Ohio River Paddlefest. It's not just a fun event which brings people from all over together to celebrate recreational paddling. It's organized by Adventure Crew, which serves teens from 27 schools in Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky. All programming, which includes hiking, paddling, and skiing, is free to kids. Paddlefest is the non-profit's biggest fundraiser of the year. Everything the event raises goes toward Adventure Crew's mission. \"It serves to get city kids out in nature,\" said Jerry Schulte, spokesman for Paddlefest, \"It's a welcome opportunity for them to just explore nature, which they generally don't have an opportunity to do.\" The fun begins this year with an Outdoors For All festival Friday night at Schmidt Recreation Complex. Visitors can expect local food and drink, live music, activities, and exhibitors from 4-9:30 p.m. On Aug. 3, participants are asked to arrive early at the Schmidt Recreation Complex to park and pick up packets before the 6:45 a.m. mandatory race meeting and 7 a.m. start time. Participants can choose between two paddling lengths: a 4.5 mile race begins at Public Landing or a nine mile race that begins at Gilday Riverside Park. The Ohio River is closed off by local authorities and the Coast Guard to all travelers except for paddlers for the five and a half hour event. A finish line festival will follow the races. [You can still register for Paddlefest here if you have your own paddling equipment.](https://www.ohioriverpaddlefest.org/registration)",

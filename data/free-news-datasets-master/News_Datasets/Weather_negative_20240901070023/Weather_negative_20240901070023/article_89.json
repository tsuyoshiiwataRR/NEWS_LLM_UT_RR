    "text": "NEW DELHI: The heavy rains on Wednesday evening left the city damp, irate and exasperated. But perhaps the people with the most complaints were those working in or passing through ITO. The area, which is a central hub of offices, was cut off from the rest of the city till late at night. The roads fanning out from the intersection, one of the busiest in the capital, were all submerged, barricaded or gridlocked. 112206941Tilak Bridge went under in the excessive rain as did Vikas Marg leading to Laxmi Nagar. Police blocked Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg to prevent vehicles from reaching the flooded Minto Bridge. And those who attempted to take Ring Road from Delhi Gate past Raj Ghat ran into an intractable traffic jam. Several vehicles experienced breakdowns near the intersection, causing more obstruction to movement. Two buses whined to a halt after turning left from ITO towards Vikas Marg. Another bus was abandoned on the road near Delhi Gate, while two stuttered and stopped almost simultaneously near Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium. The malfunctioning buses stood adjacent to the footpath, one occupying the leftmost lane and the other on the main carriageway, leaving only a single lane for motorists to squeeze through. “As if this wasn’t enough, waterlogging on the right side forced traffic to move extra slowly,” said Rukmini Gupta, who works in an office in ITO.Leaving the ITO intersection didn’t end the ordeal for motorists. They encountered yet another impediment after a bus broke down at the junction of Ring Road and Vikas Marg next to Indira Gandhi Stadium. People going to south Delhi and New Delhi faced similar obstructions, many revealing also how power cuts darkened the streets and slowed progress.With DDU Marg blocked for vehicles reaching there on Vikas Marg, taking a U-turn from the ITO traffic lights to access the Delhi Gate route didn’t prove useful because the Ring Road stretch near Rajghat and Indira Gandhi Stadium was also flooded. The only recourse was to turn back to Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg and wade through knee-deep water.A trip that usually took an hour ended up lasting five-six hours for many people, leaving them cross and impatient. \\\"I reached home in Malviya Nagar from my office at ITO in five hours,” said Anant Kumar. “Ironically, the heart of the city turned into an island. Had there been any medical emergency or other exigencies, I don't know how lives would have been saved.\\\"Unusually, the waterlogging and traffic congestion at ITO and Rajghat continued until Thursday afternoon even though normalcy returned to other areas of the city. All this despite ITO, Rajghat, Tilak Bridge and Minto Bridge having been identified by the civic authorities as waterlogging hotspots for which specific measures were formulated. “Wednesday proved that the authorities didn’t take the necessary steps to prevent waterlogging despite last year’s floods,” said AK Jha, a resident of Daryaganj.PWD officials claimed that though Tilak Bridge was cleared late at night, the heavy rainfall meant water kept accumulating on the road as quickly as it was being removed. “No drain in Delhi is designed to take that volume of rainfall,” said a PWD officer. “100mm of rainfall in one hour is too heavy for the system to handle.” The depression under the bridge also collected water flowing from the ITO crossing.Tilak Bridge, where the jurisdiction of NDMC and PWD intersect, had six mobile PWD water pumps and a sucker machine to manage the collected water. While the similar flooding on June 28 was attributed to an unclogged outfall drain, there was no clear answer this time to what happened.“The high intensity rains will continue to be a problem. The drains can be cleaned, but slope readjustments have to be done to prevent flooding,” a PWD officer said.At the seasonally affected Minto Bridge, two drains were constructed to link with an underground sump. Through an intricate set of five motors, water was diverted to a bigger drain near the BJP headquarters. “From there, the water is pushed to the main drain operated by the irrigation & flood department at IP Estate,” an official explained. But such interventions haven’t achieved their objective.Ranjit Singh Flyover, a crucial link between Delhi Gate and Barakhamba Road, was deluged at its tail end. Even the reinforcing of concrete structures, replacement of bearings and resurfacing of the road surface done in preparation for the G20 summit last year did not help. “The drainage at the spot functioned efficiently,” insisted an NDMC official.",

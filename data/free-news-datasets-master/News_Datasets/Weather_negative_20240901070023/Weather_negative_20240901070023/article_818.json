    "text": "A HEAT ADVISORY has been issued for Jackson, Josephine, eastern Curry and central and western Siskiyou Counties through 8 AM Saturday. Click on the 'Alerts' tab above for more details on these alerts.\nA RED FLAG WARNING has been issued for western and central Siskiyou County and along the Cascades from 2 PM to 8 PM Thursday. Click on the 'Alerts' tab above for more details on these alerts.\nToday: Bright but smoky skies to start the day, except along the coast with clouds and fog from the marine layer. Coastal temperatures will stay cool with highs in the 60s. For inland areas, clouds will be going on the increase as monsoonal moisture moves up into our region. It'll be another very hot day away from the coast with highs getting up into the triple-digits for most of our westside valleys and then up into the upper 90s for the Klamath Basin. As we head into Friday evening, some isolated to spotty (mainly dry) thunderstorms will be possible into Siskiyou, Klamath and even Jackson Counties. The best chances will be near the Cascades and into central and southeast Siskiyou County.\nExtended: Some thunderstorms and showers could linger a bit through Friday night and into early Saturday morning. However, more widespread and numerous thunderstorms are expected across much of the region Saturday afternoon into Saturday evening. Thunderstorms will likely be wetter on Saturday, but we'll still be concerned about abundant lightning and numerous fire starts. Along with the lightning, storms will be capable of some strong outflow winds too. The storms will gradually taper off into Saturday night. Highs on Saturday won't be as hot with the increased clouds and the storms.\nA FIRE WEATHER WATCH has been issued for the Cascades and much of Klamath, Lake and Siskiyou Counties from 11 AM to 11 PM Saturday. Click on the 'Alerts' tab above for more details on these alerts.\nThunderstorm chances could linger on Sunday along and east of the Cascades. Dry and sunny weather will arrive to start next week with temperatures trending back up. More days in or near the triple-digits will be possible for our westside valleys with lower to middle 90s expected in the Klamath Basin.\nStay up to date on the forecast by tuning into our future newscasts or right here on\nKDRV.com",

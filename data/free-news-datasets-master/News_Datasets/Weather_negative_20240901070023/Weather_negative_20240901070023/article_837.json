    "text": "Lightning is raining down on the UK for the second day in a row today, with humid weather cooking up severe conditions in the upper atmosphere that have unleashed across multiple regions. The Met Office has warned that, while the warnings for this week have expired, it may still impose short notice alerts as the warm weather that sparked earlier storms remains. The agency said earlier this week that there is a risk of &quot;isolated thunderstorm activity&quot;, with lightning maps capturing the leftover chaos sparked on Wednesday and Thursday. In a statement on Monday, the agency warned:&quot; It is likely that some warnings may need to be issued at short notice ahead of the development of the most intense thunderstorm activity. Hot conditions will remain, until a fresher and cooler influence begins from Friday.&quot; Follow where the lightning is now by look at this map Lightning map &quot;There is still the risk of isolated thunderstorm activity in the east or southeast of England but the frequency and impacts will be much reduced compared with Wednesday and Thursday.&quot; Charts from lightningmaps.org show that, over the last day, hundreds of flashes have been seen across the country as the stormy weather continues to swirl around England. The maps show that storms have touched the outskirts of London, in areas like Crawley, Guildford and Croydon, with systems largely skirting the city to the southwest and moving around Reading and Oxford. The map shows a major cluster around Basingstoke and Winchester, where several dozen lightning flashes have been reported. Beyond Oxford, lightning has been spotted towards the Midlands, around Peterborough, Northampton and Coventry, with other flashes seen briefly in and around the southwest. Storms produced some limited lightning around the border of England and Wales, to the west of Gloucester and as far west as Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. As the new month progresses, the Met Office has said that the early weeks will likely see &quot;changeable&quot; weather, with Atlantic-powered pressure powering rainy systems in the north, while the south sees &quot;fine, settled weather&quot;. The long-range forecast covering August 6 to 15 suggests there remains the possibility of further thunderstorms in the south. The forecast states: &quot;Areas further to the south are more likely to see ridges of higher pressure, bringing more in the way of fine, settled weather, though still with the potential for some wetter, thundery or more generally unsettled interludes.&quot;",

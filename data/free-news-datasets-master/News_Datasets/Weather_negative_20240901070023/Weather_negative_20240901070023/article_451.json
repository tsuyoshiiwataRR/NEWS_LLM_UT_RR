    "text": "Here’s how summer humidity is causing more high heat index days Large-scale weather patterns can impact how frequently oppressive humidity moves in. NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - Summers are hot enough in Middle Tennessee, but high-humidity days add another danger. In the wake of yet another heat wave, heat index values are topping 100 degrees for several of the next seven days. What makes us so vulnerable to seeing these high heat index days? There is not one simple answer to that question, rather, multiple things play a factor here. Tennessee is roughly 300 miles from the Gulf of Mexico. With the right large-scale weather systems in place, very warm and moist air masses can make their way here. El Niño and La Niña can play a role in how often that deep gulf moisture makes it into the Midstate. With El Niño, drier sinking air over parts of the Atlantic, and warmer than average temperatures over the Pacific, can shift the jet stream farther south steering storms across the southern third of North American With La Niña, dry sinking air and cooler-than-average temperatures over the Pacific, make for a more northern track of the jet stream and associated storm systems. In both El Niño and La Niña years, individual storm tracks can also lead to higher or lower Gulf moisture being brought into the Midstate. When warmer air masses are brought in by different large-scale systems, the air can hold more water vapor. That is why oftentimes, we find our hottest days also having high humidity. A study by Climate Central shows that because of how frequently the heat and humidity combine, there are on average 17 more days in a year, in Nashville, with a heat index of 90 degrees or more. This [ study](https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/high-heat-index-days-2023) looked back at heat index data from 1979 through 2022, and found the annual frequency of days with a heat index of at least 90°F has increased in 201 U.S. locations.

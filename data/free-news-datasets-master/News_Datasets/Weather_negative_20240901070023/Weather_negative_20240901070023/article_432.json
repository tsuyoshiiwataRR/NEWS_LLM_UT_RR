    "text": "TOKYO - Japan's weather agency said Thursday that the past month was the hottest July since records began in 1898. The national average temperature for July was 2.16 degrees Celsius above the baseline average calculated from 1991 to 2020, marking the highest recorded in over 120 years, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). This marked the second consecutive year that Japan has broken its July average temperature record.

Intense sunlight across the country resulted in record-breaking high temperatures. Out of 153 meteorological observation stations nationwide, 62 reported their highest average temperatures for the month.

During the first half of August, many regions are expected to experience extreme heat days with maximum temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius. The agency advises the public to stay informed through temperature forecasts and heatstroke alerts and to take appropriate measures to prevent heat-related illnesses.",

    "text": "'Freezing': Kiwis wake to sub-zero temperatures, 57hrs of rain for Northland\n'Freezing': Kiwis wake to sub-zero temperatures, 57hrs of rain for Northland\n- New Zealand is waking up to temperatures well into the negative this morning.\n- Northland is under a 57-hour rain watch, but may not see rain the entire time.\n- Those headed to the Warriors game tonight will not need to bring an umbrella, but a few extra layers are advised.\nThose living in the South Island are waking to sub-zero conditions after temperatures across the country plunged overnight.\nIt is as low as -8.9C in Mount Cook and -3C in Blenheim and Queenstown.\nThe country’s highest temperatures are currently in the north, with Whangārei on 13C and Kaitaia on 11C.\nMetService meteorologist Alwyn Bakker said they expected it to be “colder than usual” this morning – and the cold temperatures are set to stick around.\nBakker said the lowest temperature that “people are actually close to” is Alexandra with -5.2C, closely rivalled by Queenstown which is hovering around -4C.\n“Nearly all of the South Island main centres can expect freezing nights, with only Dunedin and Westport remaining above zero for the next few days.”\nThick snow has been falling in the South Island this week, blocking many vital highways but also leaving ski fields with a “decent dumping”.\nBakker urged those travelling to the ski fields to take extra care on the roads, as the lower temperatures will cause ice on the road to stick around for longer.\nMt Hutt skifield workers clear snow for access around the facilities after a heavy dump of snow. Photo / Nicole Hawke\nFor some areas of the South Island, the chilly conditions are expected to last through the weekend.\n“While Kaikōura’s forecast minimum temperature of -2C isn’t the lowest around, that’s eight degrees lower than its average at this time of year,” Bakker said.\nHe said the temperatures are colder than usual for this time of year owing to a ridge of high pressure clearing the skies overnight.\n“So there’s a lot of heat loss happening overnight.”\nThick snow fell on the South Island this week.\nHe said Northland has much higher temperatures, sitting in the low teens, due to the 57 hours of rain which will begin this morning.\nA heavy rain watch has been placed over the area from 9am until 6pm on Sunday.\n“[There is not] necessarily going to be rain for that entire period … it is just that the [weather] system will be hanging around,” Bakker said.\nHe said there is a low risk of the wet weather moving downwards to Auckland and the Coromandel, both of which may see a few showers over the weekend.\nThose heading to the Warriors game against the Eels at Go Media Stadium tonight may not need an umbrella but would be wise to dress appropiately for the chilly weather.\n“It’s not going to be terribly warm, but compared to the rest of the country, it will be positively toasty.”\nRachel Maher is an Auckland-based reporter who covers breaking news.

Officers found evidence relating to the obtaining, transferring, and concealment of prostitution funds. Police also found telephone recording equipment, condoms, and personal identification documents including passports and driver's licenses. Court documents say commercial sex advertisements were linked to the business' phone number. These ads were posted to adultsearch.com and featured pictures of Asian females.

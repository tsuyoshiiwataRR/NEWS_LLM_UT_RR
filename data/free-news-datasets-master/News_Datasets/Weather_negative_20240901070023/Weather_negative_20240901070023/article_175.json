    "text": "California wildfires closed Washoe schools 11 times in 2020. Could this year be a repeat? Siobhan McAndrew Reno Gazette Journal If history repeats itself, the first day of school in Washoe County could be called for smoke.\nSmoke from California's Park Fire is blowing into Northern Nevada with just over a week until school starts. The Air Quality Index has hovered in the yellow and orange zones, meaning it is unhealthy for sensitive groups of people.\nThat's just below where it was in 2020, when heavy smoke from the Loyalton Fire burning in Plumas, Sierra and Lassen counties poured into the Truckee Meadows, cancelling the first day of school. School would close 10 more times in August and September due to dangerous conditions from the smoke.\nThe Park Fire that started near Chico, California, had already burned nearly 400,000 acres , scorched hundreds of structures and stood at less than 20% containment as of Thursday afternoon.\nIf the fire is still burning on Aug. 12, the first day of school in Washoe County, and winds are driving the smoke into the Truckee Meadows, could there be a repeat of 2020?\nHere's what would have to happen:\nWhat we know How is a smoke day decided? The Washoe County School District has set up a policy to monitor the air quality. If multiple readings show that the air quality index is above 301, meaning it is hazardous for all, and is expected to remain that way, classes would be canceled.\nAQI readings\n0–50: Good air quality with little to no risk 51–100: Moderate air quality 101–150: Unhealthy for sensitive groups 151–200: Unhealthy air quality 201–300: Very unhealthy air quality 301+: Hazardous air quality\nHas anything chanced since 2020? The district closed its buildings 11 days because of smoke in 2020, but the threshold to trigger a smoke day is much higher now. In 2020, classes were canceled if the AQI was above 150. It’s now triggered at 301.\nProcedure: Just like a snow day, district leaders start talking the night before and early the day of expected smoky skies, consulting health experts and the National Weather Service. The final decision will be made by Superintendent Joe Ernst. The message will be relayed to families just as it is with snow days, with early calls, texts and emails.\nDays have to be made up: Smoke days and snow days will have to be made up at the end of the year. The district has built in three contingency days at the end of the school year. Even one smoke or snow day triggers those days. Instead of the school year ending on June 6 it could be extended to June 9, 10 or 11.\nInside schools: While air quality decisions are made factoring in exposure people face traveling to and from school, every building has commercial-grade HVAC systems. Buildings are fitted with windows and doors that limit smoke intrusion and balance indoor and outdoor air. Air is filter inside every building through filters multiple times per hour.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

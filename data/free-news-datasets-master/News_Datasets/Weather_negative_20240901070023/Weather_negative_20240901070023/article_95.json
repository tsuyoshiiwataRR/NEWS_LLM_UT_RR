    "text": "North country rainfall shatters July records DEER RIVER, New York (WWNY) - With torrential downpours and flash flooding, we know July was a wet one. But just how wet was it? According to the Northeast Regional Climate Center: - As of July 30, Lowville had its wettest month since 1893 with 10.6 inches of rain. - More than half of the rain fell on July 10, when the village and Lewis County saw record-breaking flooding. - It was the village’s all-time wettest day at just over 6 inches. - As of July 30, the Watertown International Airport had more than six inches of rain, the second wettest July since 1949. So what did the wet weather mean for farmers in Lewis County? “I am cleaning up the mess in the gardens from all the rain we had,” said Loren Bush, co-owner of Bush Gardens in Deer River. Rows once filled with vegetables are now empty. “We lost thousands of heads of broccoli and cauliflower,” said Bush. It’s not a complete loss for Bush. He says his peppers and watermelon are looking great. His winter squash is about three weeks early. “Some things on high ground, they’re growing super fast,” he said. “The beets are the size of basketballs.” Take a drive to Natural Bridge and you’ll find dozens of mushrooms at Cogumelo Mushrooms Farm. Unlike some fruits and veggies, mushrooms thrive in moisture and humidity, which come with heavy rain. “As long as things are managed well it doesn’t hurt, and it does help to some extent, although really the humidity in the air goes a long way,” said Liam Carney, owner of the farm. It does take some preparation when heavy rains are in the forecast. “It’s a pain in the neck. I was down here in a rainstorm yesterday covering these guys so they wouldn’t get ruined and I got completely soaked,” said Carney. Copyright 2024 WWNY. All rights reserved.",

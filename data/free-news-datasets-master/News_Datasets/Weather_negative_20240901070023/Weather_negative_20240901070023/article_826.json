    "text": "Severe weather forecast across parts of Germany and Poland through at least Aug. 3. Transport, business, and utility disruptions possible. Severe weather is forecast across parts of eastern Germany and southern and western Poland through at least Aug. 3. Heavy rainfall and thunderstorms are expected across the region; strong winds, lightning, and possible hail may accompany storms. Heavy downpours could trigger flooding in low-lying areas and landslides on unstable slopes. Strong winds may cause property damage and power outages. As of Aug. 2, the German Weather Service (DWD) has issued orange continuous rainfall warnings (the second lowest level on a four tier scale) across parts of southern Brandenburg, central, eastern, and northern Saxony, far eastern Saxony-Anhlat, and far eastern Thuringia states. Rainfall totals of 2-4 cm (0.8-1.6 inches) are expected across the region Aug. 2. Poland's Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMGW) has issued orange heavy rain with thunderstorms warnings (the middle level on a three-tier scale) across parts of western Greater Poland, northern and western Lower Silesian, and central and southern Lubusz provinces. Yellow heavy rain with thunderstorms warnings are in place across Holy Cross and Opole and parts of southern Greater Poland, northern Lesser Poland, southern and western Lodz, eastern and southern Lower Silesian, southern and western Lublin, southern Masovian, central and northern Silesian, and central and northern Subcarpathian provinces. Yellow thunderstorm warnings have been issued across parts of southern Lesser Poland, southern Silesian, and southwestern Subcarpathian provinces. Officials could update and possibly extend the coverage of weather alerts over the coming hours and days. Sustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed stormwater drainage systems. Sites located downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly or mountainous areas, especially where heavy rainfall has saturated the soil. Authorities could issue mandatory evacuation orders for flood-prone communities over the coming days. Disruptions to electricity and telecommunications services are possible where significant flooding or strong winds impact utility networks. Floodwaters and debris flows may render some bridges, rail networks, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities could temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. Severe weather could also trigger flight delays and cancellations at airports in the region. Flooding could block regional rail lines; freight and passenger train delays and cancellations are possible in areas that see heavy rainfall and potential track inundation. Localized business disruptions may occur in low-lying areas; some businesses might not operate at full capacity because of flood damage to facilities, possible evacuations, and some employees' inability to reach work sites. Monitor local media for weather updates and related advisories. Confirm all transport reservations and business appointments before travel. Make allowances for localized travel delays and potential supply chain disruptions where flooding has been forecast. Do not drive on flooded roads. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

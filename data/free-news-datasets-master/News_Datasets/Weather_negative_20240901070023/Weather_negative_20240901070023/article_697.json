    "text": "Gabe's Friday Morning Forecast - 8/2/24\nExcessive Heat Warnings and Heat advisories remain in effect for all counties in northeast Mississippi Friday. This means that during the afternoon, when we hit our high in the mid 90s, it'll actually feel anywhere from 105-110. There could be some momentary relief with an afternoon cold front producing some sporadic storms that may bring temperatures down.\nA few of these storms could be on the hefty side with some strong wind gusts and heavy rainfall being the primary threats. We could also see a few small hailstones possible. Timing on these storms will be towards Friday afternoon/evening.\nBeyond Friday, we are very dry. A dominant high pressure system will build into our area pushing all the rain chances away from us. This will not only keep us dry, but also allow that heat to build back.\nThis weekend will have low temperatures in the low to mid 70s with high temperatures in the mid 90s. Although we will be slightly cooler, heat indices in excess of 100 degrees are likely. That means heat advisories will once again be issued. If you can battle the heat, then there should be beautiful sky conditions to enjoy some outdoor fun.\nTracking the Tropics: Invest 97L continues to pick up steam as it moves over the Greater Antilles. This will continue to move northwest into the Gulf of Mexico by early next week. Right now, projections have it sticking around the Florida coast along the eastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico before moving northeast into the Carolinas. Although we won't see any direct effects from the tropical system, this is going to be a big factor on our temperatures. We are continuing to track this system as we get closer and will continue to finetune the forecast.\nDownload WTVA's news, weather and TV apps to receive alerts, watch LIVE newscasts and more.\nSign up to receive email alerts for breaking news, weather and more.",

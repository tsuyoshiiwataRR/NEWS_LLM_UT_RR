    "text": "Right now, let&#039;s head to Florida where we&#039;re dealing with heat and also thunderstorms at times for places like Orlando had come this weekend. We&#039;re also going to see impacts from a developing tropical system. So off the bat here, the current status of our tropical rainstorm is one that is producing some pretty deep convection over areas like southwestern Haiti. There are some areas with localized flooding and that&#039;s a problem at the center of the storm continues to cruise West and it&#039;s going to be moving through an area near Cuba and toward the Straits of Florida. Overall, here&#039;s what radar would look like. This is supplemented by some satellite data as well. So areas around Haiti and also out near Punta Cana, some locally heavy rain. We have seen some flooding reports into parts of Puerto Rico, eastern parts of Puerto Rico, seeing some areas of flooding out there in recent hours, especially earlier today. So let&#039;s take a look at the overall, the tropical tracker showing that we&#039;re going to be dealing with limited organization for the next 18 to 24 hours because of land interaction. We&#039;ve got some big islands there. There are some. Mountains in eastern Cuba as well, and there&#039;s still some relatively dry air that&#039;s in place, but as this moves farther W, it&#039;s going to enter a zone where there&#039;s a little bit more moisture out here. And again, the biggest obstacle of this storm had faced was dry air earlier in its life cycle. Now we&#039;re getting past that. So how heavier showers and storms will be a big concern. And likelihood is that this is going to become a tropical depression and we&#039;re forecasting it to become a tropical storm probably on the Gulf Coast side of Florida. So here we have Accuweather&#039;s. IPad for this tropical rainstorm. You&#039;ll notice that we forecast this to become a tropical depression beginning around 8:00 PM. Saturday in the Florida Keys, and then it may become a landfalling tropical storm around 8:00 PM Sunday. But look at this slow, slow, slow forward motion all week long near the South side of Georgia and the South Carolina coast. So here&#039;s the snapshot Saturday as we become a tropical storm. Or tropical depression becoming a tropical storm into Sunday and impacts likely increasing into North Florida with some downpours.",

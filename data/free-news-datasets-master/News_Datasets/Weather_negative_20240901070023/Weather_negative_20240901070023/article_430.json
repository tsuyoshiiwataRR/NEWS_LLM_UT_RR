    "text": "02 Aug 2024 | 04:26 AM UTC US: High temperatures forecast to persist across western and southwestern regions through at least Aug. 5 Heatwave forecast across parts of western and southwestern US through Aug. 5. Transport and power disruptions, health concerns possible. Forecast models indicate excessive temperatures are likely to persist across parts of the western and southwestern US through at least Aug 5. Highs of around 41-48 C (105-118 F) are likely across parts of southeastern California and the lower desert and foothill communities of south central Arizona and southwestern Arizona. The US National Weather Service (NWS) has warned of fire risks across large portions of the southwestern US over the coming days due to the combination of hot temperatures, low relative humidities, and low chances of precipitation. As of late Aug. 1, the NWS has issued excessive heat warnings across the affected area. Minimum nighttime temperatures will also be well above average for the time of year, providing little relief from the excessive heat. Officials could update and extend the coverage of weather alerts over the coming days. The high temperatures may result in increased energy and water demand and an increased risk of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Authorities advise the general public to avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight, wear loose and light clothing, and stay hydrated. The extended period of oppressive heat and dry conditions may produce ideal circumstances for wildfire growth throughout the region. Heatwaves also pose a threat to vulnerable groups - such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with respiratory illnesses - due to the increased possibility of heat stroke or heat exhaustion during prolonged exposure to high temperatures. These health risks could also extend to relatively healthy individuals during significant heatwave events. High temperatures may warp rail tracks and force passenger and freight trains to operate at reduced speeds. Road surface damage is also possible, and overheated vehicles may worsen traffic problems in urban areas where congestion is already a problem. Commercial trucking disruptions might occur as very high temperatures put more stress on vehicles, making tire blowouts more common. Major flight disruptions are unlikely, but general aviation disruptions are possible, and some airfreight carriers could reduce cargo loads. High temperatures could lead to an increased demand for electricity, which might trigger localized brownouts or blackouts, exacerbating hazardous conditions when air conditioning is no longer possible. Monitor local media for weather updates and related advisories. During heat waves, remain indoors in air conditioning when possible. If outdoor activities are necessary, frequently rest in shaded areas; avoid activity during the hottest times of the day. Stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. Avoid alcoholic beverages, which are dehydrating - drink bottled water or water that has been boiled. Wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothing. Cotton fabrics are more cooling than synthetics. Promptly seek medical attention if signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke develop. Charge battery-powered devices in case prolonged electricity outages occur.",

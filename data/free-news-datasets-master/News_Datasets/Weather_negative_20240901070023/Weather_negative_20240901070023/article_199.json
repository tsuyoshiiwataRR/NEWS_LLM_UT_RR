    "text": "PORTLAND Ore. (KPTV) - From southern Oregon to the Washington border, 25 large wildfires are burning across the state of Oregon as of Thursday. With the extreme heat and dry weather returning, crews are already bracing for impact.\nWhile crews are responding to fires in the metro area, many local firefighters are being deployed to help fight wildfires across the state.\n“Reality is, those who are getting deployed are doing the job that they love,” said Stefan Meyers, public information officer for Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue and the Oregon State Fire Marshall’s Red Team.\nAlthough Meyers works for the Incident Management Team, he still camps out with everyone else when he’s on a deployment.\n“It may be being in the middle of a field, some farmer’s field, that they made available for fire camp,” Meyers said. “And then another time, they could be in the backyard of an elementary school.”\nSEE ALSO:\nFirefighters in Oregon are staying prepared to fight wildfires as temperatures start to rise again. When it comes to being deployed to a fire, crews must be prepared to go at a moment’s notice. This means being equipped with adequate food, water, and fireproof gear, while also being prepared for the worst-case scenario.\n“The fire shelter would be an essential one. This is the last step if you were overtaken by fire, is finding a safe space to protect yourself and deploying a shelter,” Meyers said.\nCrews are deployed for 14 days at a time, where they will work long hours, often in hot temperatures. Upon return from their two-week deployment, crews face the potential to be sent back out to another fire just 24 hours later.\nCommunities across the state rely on firefighters to keep them safe every summer, and Meyers said that’s exactly why firefighters do what they do.\n“While there is the piece of managing living out in the middle of a field and working on shifts, it’s also an honor to be protecting a community that’s under threat from fire,” Meyers said.\nAs Portland faces another heat wave, fire officials asked people to remember to do what they can to prevent fires at their own homes and stay safe.\nFind more information about wildfires in the state of Oregon here.\nCopyright 2024 KPTV-KPDX.

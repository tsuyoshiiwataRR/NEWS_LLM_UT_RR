    "text": "By Tim Weaver ,\n1 hour ago\nHow do you make the longest preseason game of the year even longer? You call an extended delay due to extreme weather conditions with NFL officials seemingly unable to make a decision about whether or not to continue the game.\nIf that was on your bingo card you're in luck, because the Hall of Fame game between the Houston Texans and the Chicago Bears got stuck on pause with about three minutes left to go in the third quarter, which was about half an hour ago now.\nThe reason was severe thunderstorms in the area, including heavy rain and lightning. Here's a look from inside the press box.\nAfter waiting a long time, the league has finally made a decision and called the rest of the game off, per Jonathan Alexander at the Houston Chronicle.\nAnd so the Texans lose to the Bears by a score of 21-17.

Houston got strong performances from a few postiions, though - especially Davis Mills and Case Keenum at quarterback.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

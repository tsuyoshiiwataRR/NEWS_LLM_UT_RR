    "text": "{p}Humidity is slowly creeping back up, but rain chances won't ramp up until Sunday afternoon. A cold front will approach the Lowcountry late Sunday into early Monday, bringing some showers and storms. Some may have the potential to become severe; the main threat is gusty winds. Highs will be in the lower to middle 90s Sunday but with the added humidity, it will feel more like triple digits. But, we will experience some cooler temperatures again later next week! The cold front is forecasted to slide off the coast late Monday evening gifting us with some drier conditions. Tuesday and Wednesday will be mostly sunny skies with lower rain chances. Then heading into Thursday & Friday, the mornings will be partly cloudy, with the chance for isolated showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. High pressure will be the dominate weather feature after the front rolls through, so expect a fair amount of sunshine, more seasonal temperatures and low rain chances midweek.{/p}{p}Tropical Storm Ernesto is weakening as it moves northeast and farther away from Bermuda. The only impacts we can expect in the Lowcountry will be a high risk of rip currents through the second half of the weekend.{/p}{p}Overnight, a tad warmer with mild conditions, lows 73-77.{br}Sunday, partly cloudy with isolated afternoon storms, highs 89-94.{br}Sunday night, showers & thunderstorms ending then decreasing clouds, lows 73-76.{/p}{p}Sunday Tides{/p}{p}L: 1:20am{ } { }H: 7:07am{/p}{p}L: 1:17pm{ } { } H: 7:48pm{/p}{p}Fallon Mears{br}fmears@sbgtv.com{/p}{p}{br}{/p}\",\"forecast\":{\"externalServiceId\":\"USSC0234\",\"zipCode\":\"29464\",\"state\":\"South Carolina\",\"stateAbbreviation\":\"SC\",\"city\":\"Mount Pleasant\",\"latitude\":\"32.794\",\"longitude\":\"-79.862\",\"current\":{\"relHumidity\":70,\"wndSpdMph\":14,\"wndDirDegr\":\"190\",\"wndDirCardinal\":\"S\",\"snowAmtIn\":\"N/A\",\"tempF\":90,\"precipChance\":\"20\",\"iconCode\":66,\"skyText\":\"Partly Cloudy",

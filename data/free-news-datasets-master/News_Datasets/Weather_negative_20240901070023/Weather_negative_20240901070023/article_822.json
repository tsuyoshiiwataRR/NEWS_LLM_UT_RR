    "text": "Severe weather forecast across much of Croatia through at least Aug. 3. Disruptions to transport, business, and utilities possible. Severe weather is forecast across much of Croatia through at least Aug. 3. Thunderstorms are forecast to break out across much of the country; heavy rainfall, strong wind gusts, lightning, and possible hail may accompany the storms. Heavy downpours could trigger flooding in low-lying communities, and strong winds could cause property damage and power outages. As of Aug. 2, Croatia's State Hydrometeorological Institute (DHMZ) has issued the following weather warnings across the country: Orange thunderstorm warnings (the middle level on a three-tier scale): Karlovac and Zagreb regions. Yellow thunderstorm warnings: Gospic, Knin, Osijek, Rijeka, and Split regions. Further yellow thunderstorm warnings are in place across the country with the exception of Dubrovnik Region Aug. 3. Officials could update and possibly extend the coverage of the weather alerts over the coming hours and days. The storms could produce rounds of heavy rainfall, strong winds, and isolated thunderstorm activity across the affected areas. Sustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed stormwater drainage systems. Sites located downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly or mountainous areas, especially where the soil has become saturated by heavy rainfall. Authorities could issue mandatory evacuation orders for flood-prone communities over the coming days. Disruptions to electricity and telecommunications services are possible where significant flooding, landslides, or strong winds impact utility networks. Floodwaters and debris flows may render some bridges, rail networks, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities could temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. Strong winds might also pose a hazard to high-profile vehicles. Severe weather could also trigger flight delays and cancellations at airports across the affected areas. Authorities may temporarily suspend port operations or close beach fronts along the Adriatic coast if strong winds trigger hazardous sea conditions. Flooding could block regional rail lines; freight and passenger train delays and cancellations are possible in areas that see heavy rainfall and potential track inundation. Localized business disruptions may occur in low-lying areas; some businesses might not operate at full capacity because of flood damage to facilities, possible evacuations, and some employees' inability to reach work sites. Monitor local media for updated emergency and weather information. Seek updated information on weather and road conditions before driving or routing shipments through areas where severe weather is forecast. Plan accordingly for potential delivery delays if routing shipments by truck through affected areas. Confirm flights. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

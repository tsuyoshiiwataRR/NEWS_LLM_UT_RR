    "text": "Three homes electrified by Wednesday's severe storms in Omaha\nThe Omaha Fire Department is still investigating the cause.\nThe Omaha Fire Department is still investigating the cause.\nThe Omaha Fire Department is still investigating the cause.\nWednesday's storm left neighbors along 121st Street without power — until they had too much of it.\nThey woke up at 5:30 a.m. Thursday to find their walls buzzing with electricity.\nWalt Bures heard a strange noise when he woke up. At first he thought it was just water from his washing machine.\nPower outages: Hundreds of thousands of customers lost power from strong, damaging winds\n\"I had to go to the main line to turn it off and then there was still a buzzing sound and what looked like steam, but it end up being smoke,\" Bures said.\nHours later, another neighbor experienced the same thing.\n\"My wall was getting warm and I could hear the buzzing,\" Dave Noyes said.\nThey called the Omaha Fire Department who determined their houses had become electrified — and they weren't the only ones.\n\"We assessed those situations, found a third home that was also affected and waited for OPPD to assist us in de-energizing those homes,\" Battalion Chief Tim Gilman said.\nList: Highest wind gust reports from Wednesday's severe storms in Nebraska, Iowa\nThe houses were charged with energy causing siding to smolder and wires to smoke. For safety reasons, the firefighters couldn't put out the fires until the power was off, especially on Bures' home.\n\"They had to tear off some siding, I've got steel siding,\" Bures said.\nThe cause is still being investigated.\n\"It appears right now that they've also got a line down in a church property nearby that may have started the main issue,\" Gilman said.\nBures also said its possible an incorrectly set up generator could've fed too much power back into the system, but nothing has been confirmed.",

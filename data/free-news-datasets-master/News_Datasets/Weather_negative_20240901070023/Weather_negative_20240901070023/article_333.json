EL PASO, Texas — Five years ago this Saturday, a man with white nationalist beliefs traveled across Texas to a Walmart in El Paso, with a semiautomatic rifle in tow, with the intent of targeting Hispanic people. He killed 23 people and injured nearly another two dozen. A manifesto he had shared touted white supremacist claims of a \"replacement\" and a \"Hispanic invasion.\" At the time, many had tied his rhetoric to that of former President Donald Trump, but the idea of an \"invasion\" has pervaded ever since, including among Texas leaders. At the top, Governor Greg Abbott has repeatedly labeled the crisis at the southern border as an invasion, including quite literally declaring an invasion in 2022. \"The federal government’s failure has forced me to invoke Article I, 10, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution, thereby enabling the State of Texas to protect its own territory against invasion by the Mexican drug cartels,\" Governor Abbott wrote in a letter to the Biden Administration in 2022. In its case against U.S. Attorneys over the implementation of Senate Bill 4, which gives Texas the authority to detain people based on their immigration status, the Texas Attorney General's office cited the argument of an invasion as justification for the law. Earlier this year, a federal judge pushed back on that claim of an invasion, granting an injunction against the implementation of SB 4. [ALSO| Human rights groups worry campaign rhetoric could lead to repeat of El Paso mass shooting](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/human-rights-groups-worry-campaign-rhetoric-could-lead-to-repeat-of-el-paso-mass-shooting) \"[S]urges in unauthorized immigration alone do not qualify as an 'invasion' as described in the Constitution,\" Judge David Ezra wrote in his opinion. \"In recent months, members of Congress have parroted debunked claims of widespread voter fraud by unauthorized immigrants,\" Elizabeth Yates, a researcher with Human Rights First, said in a media call on Thursday. \"In just one example last week, Speaker Johnson said on the border that he and other members of Congress were, quote, concerned that a migrant invasion threatened our elections.\" Immigration has become one of the center focal points ahead of November's election, particularly with the presumed nomination of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. Republicans have already pinned much of the Biden Administration's handling of the border on her role. \"Texas and the politics of the border have really driven a significant portion of the national conversation, whether it's about the buoys in the Rio Grande or whether it's about Greg Abbott busing migrants to other places,\" Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston, said. \"It's become a real centerpiece of the conversation, how things go here will definitely play out nationally.\"",

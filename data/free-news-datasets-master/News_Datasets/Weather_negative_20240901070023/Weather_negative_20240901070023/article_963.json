    "text": "Orlando, Florida’s weather is known for its variability throughout the year. Situated in Central Florida, Orlando experiences a subtropical climate characterized by hot and humid summers with frequent afternoon showers and thunderstorms. This kind of weather was on full display at Universal Orlando Resort , one of the region’s most popular theme park resorts.\nIn an unprecedented turn of events, Universal Orlando Resort was struck by extreme flooding on Thursday, August 1, causing significant disruption and damage across the sprawling theme park. The unexpected deluge began this afternoon, quickly escalating from heavy rain to a full-blown flood, leading to widespread chaos throughout the park.\nRelated: Significant Portion of Universal Orlando Closed Down Without Warning\nHeavy rain today may be causing watertight projection boxes to float in the Universal lagoon.

The park’s usually vibrant walkways and attractions were submerged under several inches of water, with some areas experiencing more intense flooding.\nThe floodwaters have caused significant disruptions to park operations. Several attractions and rides are temporarily closed as crews work to remove debris and assess structural impacts. Restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues have also been affected, leading to the suspension of many planned activities.\nUpdate:\nIt got worse…we have flooding too https://t.co/bVjoJ6XVLh pic.twitter.com/MuKHACOXrt\n— Ethan Hershaft (@EthanHershaft) August 1, 2024\nAs of now, Universal Orlando Resort has not commented on the flooding, and from its appearance, no major damage has been caused to the current parks or to the construction of Epic Universe, the resort’s upcoming theme park. The theme park is built to handle storms like this, so hopefully, with proper drainage, everything will recover smoothly.\nCredit: Universal Weather Conditions and Future Forecast The severe weather conditions were caused by a sudden and intense weather system that impacted the central Florida region. This weather is shocking but not uncommon in the area , and many witnesses of flooding were unphased . This is not the first and not the last major rainstorm that will hit these theme parks this season.\nAs cleanup efforts continue, Universal Orlando Resort remains focused on addressing the immediate needs of guests and staff, with the hope of resuming normal operations in the near future. Visitors are advised to stay informed through official channels for updates on park status and safety information.\nThis post originally appeared on Disney Dining .",

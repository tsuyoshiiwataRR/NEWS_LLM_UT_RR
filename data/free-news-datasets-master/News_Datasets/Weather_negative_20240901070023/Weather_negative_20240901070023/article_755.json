    "text": "First Alert: Hot today with spotty afternoon and evening storms ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Plan on another scorching hot afternoon across north Georgia. It’ll feel even hotter with the mugginess factored in. Today is a First Alert Weather Day. A Heat Advisory is in effect for a portion of east Georgia; generally south and east of the immediate metro. It’ll feel hotter than 106° in these communities. Temperatures peak in the mid-90s between 4 and 6 p.m. It’ll feel like it’s between 103° an 106° in Atlanta. Stay hydrated. Find some shade, if you can. Avoid strenuous outdoor activity during the hottest time of day; generally the early afternoon through the early evening. Like yesterday, spotty showers and storms will bubble up in the afternoon heat. One, or two, may produce frequent lightning, small hail and gusty winds. You can be alerted to cooling downpours approaching your plans in the [First Alert Weather App](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/page/atlanta-news-first-apps-for-ios-and-android-devices/). The greatest chance of hit-or-miss storms occurs during the late afternoon and evening hours. Copyright 2024 WANF. All rights reserved.",

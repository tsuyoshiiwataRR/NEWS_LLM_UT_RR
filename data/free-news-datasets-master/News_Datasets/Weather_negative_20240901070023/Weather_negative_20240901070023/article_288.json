Lightning: Lightning strikes can be very dangerous and can cause serious injury or even death. Most people are struck by lightning when they are outside, especially when they are in open areas such as golf courses or campgrounds. Heavy rain and flooding: Heavy rains that cause flooding are often accompanied by thunderstorms. Flooding can wash away cars and other vehicles, damage buildings and even endanger human lives. Gale force winds: Thunderstorms can be accompanied by strong gusts of wind that can uproot trees, blow off roofs, and throw objects. Hail: Thunderstorms can also produce hail, which can cause damage to buildings, cars and other objects. Tornados: In some cases, thunderstorms can also produce tornadoes. Tornadoes are extremely dangerous and can cause serious damage. This does not refer to the normal summer thunderstorms, which are usually relatively harmless. They are often accompanied by brief showers, light hail, slight gusts of wind and a few lightning strikes.\nHow should I behave during a thunderstorm? Avoid open areas: Avoid being in open areas such as golf courses or campgrounds during a thunderstorm. Instead, seek shelter in a building or car. Stay away from windows and doors. Avoid using electrical devices such as phones and radios, as these can make you more vulnerable to lightning strikes. Seek shelter: If you are outdoors and there is no building or car nearby, seek shelter under a low tree or non-metal object. However, avoid seeking shelter under a single tree in an open field. Avoid metal objects: Avoid touching or using metal objects such as bicycles, steel scaffolding or garden tools during a thunderstorm. Metal is a good conductor of electrical energy and can attract a lightning strike. Secure items: Thunderstorms can bring strong winds that can throw items like lawn furniture, toys, or loose tree branches. These items can cause damage or injury if they fly around. It is best to store loose items inside a building. Park your car: If a thunderstorm is accompanied by hail, the hailstones can cause damage to cars. Park your car in a garage to protect it. +++ Editorial note: In order to inform you as quickly as possible, this text was generated based on current storm and weather forecast data and checked randomly.

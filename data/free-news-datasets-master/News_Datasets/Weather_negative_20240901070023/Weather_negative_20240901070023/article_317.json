    "text": "leh ladakh india’s coldest desert is now too hot to handle, airlines announce mass cancellation as temp rises Ladakh: Leh-Ladakh, once famously known as India’s Coldest desert has now become too hot to handle as day-time temperature increased to 35 degrees Celsius. Several Indian airlines have announced mass cancellation of flights. Several passengers are reported to be stranded at the Leh airport, claimed users on X(formally Twitter) adding that almost 12 flights have been cancelled in the past three days. IndiGo cancelled flight bookings on its website till July 31. In a post on X, the airline, on Monday announced a refund to passengers affected by the cancellation, it wrote, “High ground temperatures and runway restrictions in #Leh have necessitated the cancellation of all flights for today. If you wish to re-book or claim a refund, visit https://bit.ly/3MxSLeE We regret the inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding.” Flight cancellations due to extreme weather conditions have become common in Leh-Ladakh. However, this is the first time that mass flight cancellations have occurred because of unbearably high daytime temperatures. The low air density at high altitudes, like in Leh, can degrade aircraft engine performance, reported TOI. As altitude increases, air temperatures drop, and air pressure decreases, causing air molecules to expand and lowering overall air density. This reduction in air density means there is less oxygen available, which is why mountaineers use oxygen cylinders at high altitudes. Leh airport is located over 14,000 feet above sea level, which poses significant challenges for aircraft operations compared to other places in the country. The air pressure in Leh is naturally lower year-round, and any abnormal increase in temperature can further decrease air density. Thin air density impacts aircraft engine performance, particularly during climbing and landing phases, as the engines must generate higher speeds to stay aloft. Under such challenging conditions, coupled with unusual temperatures, aircraft engines may not be able to produce enough thrust to carry a commercially viable load, according to TOI.",

    "text": "Pakistan’s second-largest city of Lahore was deluged with record-breaking rainfall yesterday, the national weather agency said, with hospitals flooded, power interrupted and streets in the metropolis submerged.\nThe eastern city was lashed by almost 360mm (14”) of rain in three hours, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said.\n“This was record-breaking rainfall,” the agency’s deputy director Farooq Dar told AFP.\nThe previous record dates to July 1980, when 332mm fell over three hours.\n“Look at all these buckets and how much water has accumulated. We’re exhausted from trying to remove the water,” Sadam, a 32-year-old shopkeeper, told AFP as he took stock of his considerable losses.\nThe PMD had forecast a wetter-than-usual monsoon season this year for Pakistan, one of the countries experts say is most vulnerable to extreme weather being spurred by climate change.\nOver the past three days, 24 people have been killed by rainfall in the country’s mountainous northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority said.\nIn Lahore, a city of 13mn in the eastern Punjab province, one person was killed by electrocution as a result of yesterday’s cloudburst, according to local police.\nThe city’s commissioner declared an emergency and said offices and schools would be shut for the day.\nYasir Ali, a 26-year-old resident, said it was a “sad day for the nation”.\n“For a poor person it is heartbreaking that he’s been unable to go to work today,” he told AFP.\nTwo government hospitals in Lahore reported flooding in their wards, and there were intermittent power outages continuing into the afternoon.\nRoads were also submerged, bringing traffic and businesses to a standstill.\nAhmed Khan, 48, who earns a daily wage, appealed to the government “to pay some attention here and resolve this water issue”.\nMaryam Sharif, the chief minister of Punjab province, posted on X that “the entire government machinery is in the field” to drain the water.\nThe summer monsoon brings to South Asia about 70-80% of the region’s annual rainfall between June and September.\nIt is vital for agriculture, but changing weather patterns that scientists attribute to climate change are putting both lives and livelihoods at risk.\nEarlier this year Pakistan – home to 240mn people – was hit by a succession of heatwaves and this April was the wettest since 1961.\nAt least 143 people died from lightning strikes and other storm-related incidents in April.\nIn neighbouring India, at least 160 people, most believed to be labourers and their families, have been killed by torrential rains causing landslides in the southern coastal state of Kerala.\nIn 2022, a third of Pakistan was submerged by unprecedented monsoon rains that displaced millions of people and cost $30bn, according to a World Bank estimate.\nGirls wade through a flooded street in Lahore. – AFP",

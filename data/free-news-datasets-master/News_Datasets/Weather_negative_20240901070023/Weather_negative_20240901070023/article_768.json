    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. ( WBRC ) - Good morning! We have declared another First Alert Weather Day for heat, but I’m concerned we could also see severe storms today. The chance for storms will be increasing in the afternoon and evening. Scattered storms will be moving south across the area, with a risk for damaging wind gusts, large hail, and frequent cloud to ground lightning. The primary timing will be from 1 to 10 p.m., although some storms may remain on radar past midnight. The weekend will feature a slight improvement in heat levels, with highs in the low 90s. We still could see a few pop-up storms in the state, but mainly into south Alabama. Otherwise, there will be plenty of breaks for outdoor activities. All eyes will be on the Gulf of Mexico as there is now a 50% chance of development withing the next 48-hoursa and an 80% chance for development within the next 7-days. The tropical disturbance we’ve been talking about throughout the week is now expected to favor the track into the Gulf of Mexico. The system should approach the Gulf Coast late Sunday and Monday. Several models show the system crossing the big bend of Florida and moving northeast. However, there is a scenario that shows the system stalling and possibly meandering over the region, and even shifting west next week. No direct impacts are expected in our area through Monday; however, we will maintain a chance for scattered storms. If the system trends west we could see more significant impacts to rain chances, so stay tuned. If you have plans to visit the Gulf Coast, there is increasing confidence in higher rain chances and a risk for flooding along the eastern Florida Panhandle, possibly beginning as early as Sunday.

    "text": "01 Aug 2024 | 09:32 PM UTC US: Flight disruptions likely in New York metropolitan area through at least late Aug. 1 due to adverse weather Severe weather causes flight disruptions at airports in New York metropolitan area, US, Aug. 1; lingering delays and cancellations likely. Flight delays and cancellations will likely affect airports in the New York metropolitan area through at least late Aug. 1 due to severe thunderstorms impacting the region. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued ground stops and ground delay programs at LaGuardia (LGA) and Newark Liberty International (EWR) airports that are slated to remain in effect until 17:45 and 00:59 respectively. The FAA may modify or rescind the abovementioned air traffic control programs on short notice. As of around 17:30 Aug. 1, flights to EWR were experiencing delays averaging 173 minutes; flights departing EWR were delayed by an average of around 30 minutes. Flights to LGA were delayed by an average of 68 minutes. Teterboro Airport (TEB) is also experiencing delays to flights departing the airport by an average of 90 minutes. The FAA may issue additional weather-related ground delay programs and/or ground stops for airports in the New York metropolitan area over the coming hours. Residual disruptions are possible even after weather conditions improve as airlines work to clear passenger backlogs. Confirm flight reservations if scheduled to travel via LGA, EWR, TEB or another airport in the New York metropolitan area; do not check out of accommodations until onward travel is confirmed. Consider making alternative arrangements for time-sensitive travel if necessary.",

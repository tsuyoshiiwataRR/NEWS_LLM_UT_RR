    "text": "NORFOLK, Va. — The sweltering heat and the humidity has been taking a toll on everybody this summer. The Hampton Roads region has seen multiple days with heat advisories and excessive heat warnings, and the hot weather will stick around for the rest of the work week. Most of coastal Virginia and North Carolina are under a Heat Advisory through 8 p.m. Thursday, and an Excessive Heat Watch is in effect for Friday. This Excessive Heat Watch will likely be upgraded to either a Heat Advisory or Excessive Heat Warning Thursday evening. With the hot weather top-of mind, the 13News Now Weather Team took a deep dive into the numbers to compare 2024 with other years, and see just how many days the heat index has seen 100° or higher. The record for the most days with a heat index of 100° or higher is 2020. Just four short years ago, we reached 100° or higher a staggering 33 times! It was an incredibly hot summer. Behind 2020 is 1980, where those 100°-or-hotter heat index values were reached 26 times. And three years (1977, 2005, and 2018) saw us reach those sweltering levels 25 times. It has certainly been hot here in 2024, but how many days have we seen the heat index top 100°? So far, we have seen 14 days, two weeks, with a heat index of 100° or more. And while we have passed what is traditionally the hottest part of the year, we still have all of August to get through. You can bank on these numbers going up.

    "text": "Hot and humid is the weather story for this Thursday. Temperatures have soared into the upper 90s late today. We should top out in the upper 90s around 6pm. You’ve likely noticed it’s a bit more humid than normal too; that continues tonight through Friday. In fact, tonight we will see a record warm low temperature around 70 degrees in the urban parts of Portland; it’ll be the most uncomfortable night of the summer if you don’t have air-conditioning. Outlying areas drop well down into the 60s, but that’s warm for those spots.\nThe strong area of high pressure remains over the western USA through all this first week of August. From time to time, we’ll see some marine air surge inland, cooling us a bit west of the Cascades. That happens Friday and Saturday, plus again next Tuesday/Wednesday. So tomorrow will be a few degrees cooler than today but we’ll continue to call it a First Alert Weather Day due to the very warm start and afternoon humidity. A few clouds plus the marine air should keep us below 90 degrees on Saturday.\nPortland's Forecast (kptv) There’s no sign if widespread lighting over or west of the Cascades through at least the middle of next week, but hot weather means the three dozen fires burning in Oregon will become much more active. Most fire smoke remains over/east of the Cascades during this time, but overhead we may see some yellowish sun at times.\nCopyright 2024 KPTV-KPDX. All rights reserved.",

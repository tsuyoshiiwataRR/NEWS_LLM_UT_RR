    "text": "Many Florida counties are under a state of emergency as forecasters monitor a tropical depression that is likely to form as soon as this weekend in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.\nGov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 54 of 67 counties Thursday afternoon, including the northern and northeastern counties of the state, the Panhandle, the western coast of the state and some areas of central Florida.\nBroward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties are not included in the executive order.\nThe well-defined\ntropical wave bringing stormy weather to Puerto Rico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and the Virgin Islands Thursday has high odds of developing into a tropical depression this weekend or early next week as it moves nearer to Florida, the far southwestern Atlantic and the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center said.\nThe Bahamas, Caribbean or Florida could be affected, though forecasters say it’s still too early to tell exactly what that would look like or whether the disturbance could become a hurricane.\nThe chances that the system could affect South Florida will become increasingly clear in the next few days. “Uncertainty is high,” meteorologists with the National Weather Service Miami wrote in a media release.\nDeSantis’s executive order Thursday afternoon said meteorologists’ reports show a significant threat of heavy rain throughout most of the state, possibly 12 inches of rain in the next week, which could lead to flooding and power outages.\nIts chance of developing in the next seven days were 70% as of 2 p.m. Thursday, up from 60% earlier in the morning and 20% Saturday morning. It has a 30% chance in the next two days, also up from 20% earlier in the morning.\nThe wave has been slow to develop because of dry air in the region, but it will be in more favorable conditions once over the warm waters of the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, the hurricane center said.\nFloridians should keep an eye on the weather forecast and plan accordingly. NWS Miami “will continue to provide updates as needed,” the weather service said.\nThe hurricane center said the southeastern U.S. is among the areas that should be “monitoring the system’s progress.”\n“Environmental conditions” do seem favorable during the weekend for more development, National Weather Service Senior Forecaster Anthony Reynes said, particularly weaker winds near the islands. Systems tend to become stronger when upper-level winds are not as strong, he said.\nIt is the first disturbance forecasters are watching in the Atlantic since\nHurricane Beryl formed in late June.\nEarlier in July, Colorado State University experts updated their hurricane season forecast, calling for\nan even busier season than the already “extremely active” forecast they earlier predicted.\nThe next storm to form would be named Debby.",

    "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky. (WKYT) - Let’s batten down the hatches again! Severe storms are expected to roll in today. The potential for damaging winds of 60 miles per hour or higher. We’re looking at a couple of rounds of strong to severe storms that will make their way through the region, so make sure to stay weather-aware throughout the day. Now, let’s talk about preparations. With severe storms on the horizon, make sure to: - Secure any outdoor furniture or decorations that could become projectiles in strong winds - Charge your devices and have a backup power source ready - Stay tuned to local weather forecasts and sign up for emergency alerts The good news is that a cold front will finally move through and clear out the skies, bringing a brief dry spell to the area. However, don’t get too comfortable because temperatures are expected to rally by Sunday and into next week. We’re talking highs of 90 degrees or better, with the heat index making it feel like a sweltering mid-90s. And when the heat hits, don’t forget to: - Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water - Take breaks in cool, shaded areas - Check on vulnerable neighbors, like the elderly and young children Finally, another late-week cold front will end the heat wave, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get there. For now, let’s focus on staying safe and cool! Take care of each other! Copyright 2024 WKYT. All rights reserved.",

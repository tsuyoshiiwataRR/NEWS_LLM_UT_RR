    "text": "With the possibility of severe weather ahead, people living in some of Central Florida's most flood-prone areas are bracing themselves. In Orlo Vista, Orange County says their flood mitigation project is largely complete. But one resident says she'll have to see a difference to really believe it. Irene Cardona has lived in Orlo Vista for a while.\"Ten to 15 years,\" Cardona said.As far as how many times her home has flooded, \"Every time,\" she said. She said the 2022 hurricane season was worse than most.\"It was horrible. It was bad. It was real bad,\" Cardona said. She said she's uneasy whenever there's potential for severe weather in the forecast. \"It makes us nervous, it makes the kids nervous, it makes the animals nervous,\" Cardona said. \"We had to run out of here. It was so flooded, had to run with babies down the road just to get them to safety.\"But this hurricane season, Orange County said their Orlo Vista flood mitigation project is about 89 percent complete. The project uses three ponds and includes pipe installation and a pump station. As of the county's latest update, more than 26,000 dump trucks worth of material had been excavated. The county said using the additional storage from the excavated ponds, and four temporary pumps, the surrounding neighborhood \"will be protected against a major storm event\" for the 2024 hurricane season. \"I guess we'll see when the hurricane comes if we're flooded again,\" Cardona said. After years of flooding, Cardona wants to be hopeful. But she says she's worried about how much water the ponds can hold. The county has said the project will create 10 feet of additional vertical storage. \"Seeing is believing, yeah. I want to see it,\" she said. According to Orange County, the project is expected to be fully completed by the spring of 2025.",

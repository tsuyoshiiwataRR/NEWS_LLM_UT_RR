    "text": "It could be days before Toronto sees the current lengthy period of swelteringly hot and humid weather finally break, according to Global News’ top meteorologist. Toronto and much of southern Ontario have been struggling with days of heat warnings, with daytime temperatures in the 30s and nights rarely dropping below 20 C. A heat warning for Thursday said the humidex temperature was “near 40” and listed the serious consequences of extreme heat on people’s health. Global News’ chief meteorologist Anthony Farnell said that, while late July and early August are typically among the hottest times in Toronto, the consecutive days of high humidity are biting.

Temperatures will actually be below seasonal all week with highs in the mid-20s with much lower humidity levels.” - Ford rules out boundary changes, while some worry ‘your vote is going to count for less’ - Simply Delicious Recipe: Guernsey Girl cheese with fresh herb salad - Day parole revoked for man who killed Indigenous woman with trailer hitch - Murder charge laid after human remains found in Ontario kidnapping case",

    "text": "Friday promises to be another hot one across Alabama, and heat advisories will be in effect for much of the state. But parts of Alabama may have to deal with severe storms as well. NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center is forecasting a Level 1 out of 5 (marginal) risk for severe weather for parts of north and central Alabama today. A Level 1 risk means that isolated severe storms will be possible. The National Weather Service thinks that the strongest storms could bring damaging wind gusts capable of toppling trees and power lines. Tornadoes and hail are not expected. A front approaching Alabama from the north could help to kick off those isolated storms this afternoon, according to the weather service. The front could slowly move southeastward through the night and into Saturday, and will bring greater rain chances to parts of southern Alabama for the first day of the weekend. Today will still be very hot statewide, however. Air temperatures are forecast to again climb into the mid- to even upper 90s by this afternoon, and those combined with higher humidity levels have prompted another round of heat advisories for all but eastern Alabama today. Here is a look at Friday’s heat advisories for Alabama: NORTH ALABAMA * Heat advisory for all of north Alabama except DeKalb and Jackson counties from 11 a.m. until 7 p.m. Friday. The National Weather Service in Huntsville said the heat index could reach 109 degrees in the rest of north Alabama this afternoon. CENTRAL ALABAMA * https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=BMX&wwa=heat%20advisory until 9 p.m. Friday for all of central Alabama except for Chambers, Cherokee, Cleburne, Calhoun, Clay, Etowah and Randolph counties. The National Weather Service in Birmingham said the heat index could climb as high as 107 for parts of central Alabama this afternoon. SOUTH ALABAMA * https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=MOB&wwa=heat%20advisory from 10 a.m. until 7 p.m. Friday for all of southwest Alabama. The National Weather Service in Mobile said the heat index could hit 112 degrees in that region today. * https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=TAE&wwa=heat%20advisory from 10 a.m. until 7 p.m. CDT for southeast Alabama. The National Weather Service in Tallahassee, Fla., said the heat index could get as high as 110 degrees today in that region.",

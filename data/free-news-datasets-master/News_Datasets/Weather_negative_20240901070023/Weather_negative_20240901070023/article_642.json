    "text": "First Alert Weather Day: Heat & strong storms Excessive heat continues next week NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - The heat is not going anywhere anytime soon. FIRST ALERT WEATHER DAY Today will stay hot, but not as hot as the last couple of days. High temperatures will still stretch in the lower to mid 90s this afternoon, but some spots may end up staying in the 80s today. We’ll also need to watch for a couple of hit and miss storms as well. There is a low-end risk for a strong to an isolated severe storm this afternoon and evening, mainly east of I-65. Heavy rain and damaging winds are the main threats once again. Any storms would fall apart tonight as we cool things down. The lows tomorrow morning will be in the low 70s, but some of us could drop into the 60s. Download the WSMV 4 First Alert Weather app for [ iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wsmv-4-weather/id628475581) or [ Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wsmv.weather&hl=en_US&gl=US), so you can stay informed on the go and in between newscasts. We share custom videos, plus you can choose to get messages from us on the latest conditions and forecast. THIS WEEKEND Heat and humidity will also back off slightly this weekend with highs in the low to mid 90s Saturday and Sunday. Heat index values will be near the triple digits but shouldn’t be as harsh as earlier this week. A stray shower or storm also cannot be ruled out on Saturday, but most of us stay dry. Sunday will be dry and mostly sunny. FIRST ALERT WEATHER DAYS Four more First Alert Weather Days have been added for next week with high temperatures expected to get back into the mid and upper 90s Monday through Thursday. Heat index values will once again get near if not over 105° in the afternoon. The forecast is looking mainly dry, with the exception of a spotty shower on Thursday. Have weather pictures or videos?

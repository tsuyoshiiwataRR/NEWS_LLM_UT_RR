    "text": "MANAWA (WLUK) -- As Manawa celebrates 150 years, it's clear heavy rains play a part in its more recent history. A downpour Thursday forced planned events celebrating the city to be moved indoors. An estimated one inch of rain fell throughout the afternoon, with residents fearing more flooding like the area suffered just a month ago. Tory Suehs told us, “Well, it kind of looks almost like it’s going to flood again. And I was like, 'Oh no.' But thankfully it hasn’t gotten worse,\" she said. \"We thought it was going to miss us, because when I looked earlier it looked it was going to miss us, but then I got here and it’s been downpouring ever since.” Back on July 5, the embankment next to the Manawa Dam [eroded away due to heavy rainfall, which led to heavy local flooding.](https://fox11online.com/weather/weather-stories/photos-videos-heavy-rain-flash-flooding-wreak-havoc-on-northeast-wisconsin-manawa-waupaca-county-appleton-outagamie-county-brown-calumet-manitowoc-sheboygan-thunderstorms-evacuations-advisories-warnings-emergencies#) And while this latest rain is bringing back unpleasant reminders, residents say they believe the worst has already passed. “The dam isn’t going to break again, the water is bypassing, it’s going down river,\" said Rodney Krueger. \"So I really don’t think there’s anything to be concerned about at this point.” Those celebrating Manawa are keeping their spirits up. “It seems like we’ve had our share of rain this year and Manawa sure doesn’t want any more,\" said Ronda Mollica, a Manawa resident. “Rain rain go away, come again another day.” Krueger emphasized that he doesn't want a repeat [of the July flooding.](Evers' disaster declaration aids Manawa recovery efforts after heavy rainfall, dam erosion) If you can safely do so, Chime In with a picture or video of the weather conditions near you: “Is that saying that if we get another 6 inches, or 8 inches in another 30 minutes would that hurt is?\" he said. \"Yeah it would probably suck again. But I think we’ll be okay.” Manawa's 150th anniversary celebration will go until August 3 with fireworks, a parade, and a time capsule ceremony.",

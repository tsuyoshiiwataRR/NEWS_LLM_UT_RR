India and Sri Lanka will be welcomed with overcast skies and possibly even rain as the three-match ODI series kicks off with the first ODI between the two sides at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Friday (August 2). India’s last two T20I matches were both affected by rain in Kandy with toss getting delayed in both those matches. Fans should expect major delays throughout the day on Friday with predictions for small bursts of heavy rain in Colombo. According to the weather department, the temperature will be around 31 degrees celsius during the afternoon when the match gets underway with 100 per cent cloud cover around the time the toss takes place. There is around 41 per cent chance of rain in the afternoon. By evening, the temperature is expected to slip down to around 28 degrees but there are predictions of a couple of thunderstorms as well during the evening. The chance of rain rises to around 65 per cent with humidity hovering around 81 per cent. The pitch at the R. Premadasa Stadium looks like a dry surface with fair amount of assistance for the slow bowlers if we go by the indications provided during the recent Lanka Premier League (LPL) 2024 season. India managed to tackle the weather well in the last two T20I matches in Pallekele International Stadium. Suryakumar Yadav-led side won the 2nd T20I via DLS method on Sunday and then defeated the hosts to complete a whitewash via Super Over after the match ended in a tie. “It’s definitely a good start for them in that format. They played well as a unit, which is what Team India is all about. I’m sure they are heading in the right direction,” Rohit Sharma said about Suryakumar Yadav’s captaincy.

    "text": "By Douglas McIntyre ,\n1 hour ago\nFlorida avoided a direct hit by the Beryl Category 5 hurricane, which days later swamped Houston. South Florida did get near-record rain but recovered quickly in most areas. A new storm is headed toward the state; this time, some areas of Florida may not be as lucky.\nHurricane News –Next Hurricane Will Be Named “Chris”\nA new tropical rainstorm will almost reach southern Florida in two days. AccuWeather expects the storm may strengthen. AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno commented “There’s not much dry air or disruptive wind shear in the path of this tropical rainstorm. The east coast and west coast of Florida are both on the table. We need to watch this storm carefully over the next 48 hours.” The fact that Accuweather cannot make a more accurate forecast so close to landfall is disturbing and one of the reasons these storms are hard to prepare for. Hurricanes could cause $1 billion in damage in Florida this year.\nThe reason for worry about the new storm is that parts of Florida, particularly Miami, have large parts of their land below sea level. Inches of rain and a storm surge make the situation a considerable challenge regarding people and valuable property. Forecasters believe almost two-thirds of Miami could be underwater by 2060. In reality, that problem could hit the city much earlier. Miami is a huge risk for hurricanes this year.\nThe storm poses one more risk. It is moving slowly. Wherever it makes landfall, the effects will last, meaning a long period of heavy wind and rain.\nMore from ClimateCrisis 247 Heat And Wildfire Weather Will Intensify This Summer US May Or May Not BeThreatened By New Atlantic Storm Home Insurance Hit By $15 Billion Loss–Including California, Florida New Jersey Is State Worst Prepared For Climate Crisis Expand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "After weeks of steady rain and isolated severe thunderstorms, the ground across much of Western North Carolina is saturated. \"There's been a ton of trees that have fallen down,\" said Dalton Whitaker, who works for Epperson Tree Company in Henderson County. \"Heavy rains this time have been a little bit worse because of the dry spell we had,\" said Dale Epperson, arborist and owner of Epperson Tree. \"Now that the foliage is so heavy on these trees and fruits on the trees, there's definitely more risk for trees to fall.\" Epperson showed News 13 multiple photos of trees from poplars to white and red oaks that he has removed for customers all over the area. Stewart Johnson, who lives in Flat Rock, has a tree in his front yard that Epperson tagged to come down. But Johnson – who has spent thousands to maintain safety in his backyard and clear aging large trees – said the cost to remove yet another tree is now too much. \"It's expensive,\" he said. Epperson and other tree companies will negotiate on prices, as they know the costs to remove huge trees can be high. Homeowners should always get multiple quotes as a reference before choosing a company. WOMAN RECOUNTS ESCAPE FROM FLASH FLOOD AT DOLLYWOOD THEME PARK Old trees with rotted roots pose risks, especially during extended days of saturating rains. Epperson advises homeowners to examine trees, looking for cracks up and down the tree, as well as mushrooms or fungi growing at the base. He says these are all signs of rot. He says that taking care of a potentially risky tree by getting it removed can save a life. \"So, when the storm does come, they've already took care of the problem,\" he said.",

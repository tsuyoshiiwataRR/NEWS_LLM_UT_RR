    "text": "By Roger Riley ,\n10 hours ago\nDES MOINES, Iowa — Storms pushed across the metro area, with wind and rain, but little damage, with one exception — the area around Beaver and Madison.\nThe storm put tree limbs onto two homes, damaging the roofs. Also another branch went through the roof of a garage. Very large branches of trees were knocked off.\n“We got the kids to bed and we’re watching the radar and it seemed like the storm is going to split and go around us,” said Josh Johnson. “The wind came up and it blew like crazy for 10 to 15 seconds then it was over.”\nPerry Principal Dan Marburger was named this year’s Iowa Hero for the Iowa-Nebraska Heroes Game. Friends were out helping clean up. A crane was brought in to lift a branch off a house.\nMidAmerican Energy was in the neighborhood restoring downed power lines due to tree branches.\nOne branch was driven into the ground around 4 inches, it had to be removed with a pickup and a long chain.\n“A pretty good chunk of this one busted off and ended up in the garage underneath the white car over there,” said Johnson. “It just came flying. I had to get between the two cars to avoid it.”\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

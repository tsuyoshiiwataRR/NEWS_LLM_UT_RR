More intense storms may be capable of severe wind, hail, and perhaps a short-lived tornado. DISCUSSION...Convection has been ongoing for much of the late morning and early afternoon hours across central WI in the vicinity of a weak surface low. Gradual cloud-top cooling has been noted over the past 30-60 minutes in GOES IR imagery, implying that convection is slowly becoming more intense amid continued daytime heating and gradually cooling mid-level temperatures. Thunderstorm activity is expected to increase along the surface fronts draped to the south/southeast of the low. Initially discrete cells quickly developing into clusters given the weak (20-25 knots) deep-layer wind shear noted in regional VWPs. More intense updraft pulses may be capable of large hail (generally between 0.75 to 1.25 inches), and perhaps a brief landspout tornado given ambient low-level vorticity in place along the surface boundaries and adequate low-level buoyancy. As convection grows upscale, damaging winds should become the predominant hazard. Limited wind shear magnitudes and a high probability for destructive storm interactions should modulate the overall severe threat. Watch issuance is not anticipated. ..Moore/Bunting.. 08/01/2024 ...Please ATTN...WFO...GRB...MKX...DLH...ARX...MPX...

    "text": "By Tom Krosnowski ,\n26 minutes ago\n\"\nDeparture delays struck Newark Liberty International Airport for the fifth time in six days Thursday night. The Federal Aviation Administration says the culprit the last two days has been severe thunderstorms in the Midwest. In all, more than 700 flights out of Newark have been delayed in the last two days. A shortage and relocation of air traffic controllers caused delays over the weekend . This comes as the Port Authority announced June as the busiest month at its airports on record. It was also the busiest January-June stretch ever recorded by their New Jersey and New York airports. But July has been a month more so remembered for its delays. Just two weeks ago, the global Microsoft outage caused a major backup across all airlines for a couple of days. The travel issues don’t even seem to faze many travelers anymore. “I’m pretty used to it,” said Kathryn McDonough, of Los Angeles. “Having all the apps, the notifications, I feel like has made it easier. They gave us enough warning. In this case, we found out this morning, so we were able to find out and adjust.” That wasn’t the case for everybody. Some people who spoke to News 12 off-camera had just found out their flights were pushed back three hours. Others had their arrivals pushed early into the next morning.

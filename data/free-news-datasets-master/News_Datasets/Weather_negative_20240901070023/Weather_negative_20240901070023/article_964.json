    "text": "Metro Detroit is under another flooding and now a flash flooding advisory Frank Witsil Detroit Free Press Show Caption\nHide Caption\nHow to drive safely in any kind of severe weather Meteorologist Tony Laubach offers tips on how to drive safely when tornadoes, high winds, hail or flooding threaten your drive. With more storms and rainfall Friday afternoon, the National Weather Service issued alerts for flooding — and flash flooding, which is even more serious — in metro Detroit.\nThe advisories, which came just after noon, and are set to last until 4 p.m., but could be extended depending on how much more rain falls, and they apply to communities in parts of Oakland, Macomb and Wayne counties.\nA flash flood advisory, meaning that sudden flooding could occur with little warning, also was issued for Detroit and parts of Wayne and Macomb counties, including the suburbs of Hamtramck, Eastpointe and St. Clair Shores.\nForecasters said residents in low-lying areas, and areas where rain water already is ponding, should take extra precautions because the additional rainfall is adding to the 2-3 inches that was dropped overnight, causing localized flooding, especially on Interstate 696.\n\"It’s kind of hard to pinpoint exactly where the thundershowers might appear,\" weather service meteorologist Megan Varcie in White Lake Township told the Free Press earlier Friday, adding that the forecasters were \"closely monitoring\" the radar.\nEarlier, a band of rain swept through the area, pummeling Oakland and Macomb counties.\nAs a result, I-696, near 11 Mile, was closed, along with the I-94 ramp at I-696, the eastbound I-696 ramp to I-94, the westbound I-96 ramp to M-39, and the westbound I-94 on ramp to 12 Mile, as police and transportation officials wait for standing water to subside.\nIn Oakland County, flooded areas including parts of Royal Oak and Bloomfield Hills, and in Macomb County, various neighborhoods, particularly in the cities of Warren and Roseville.\nFeds: Leaders of large-scale drug network in Michigan, other states indicted\nVarcie urged motorists to avoid flooded roadways, and offered a rhyme to help them remember: \"Turn around, don't drown.\" She added that driving through water is a bad idea because \"you never know how deep the water is\" until your are in it, and by then, it is probably too late.\nFor now, Varcie said, rain appears to have stopped with not much appearing on radar until the early afternoon, when thunderstorms could “pop back up as the daytime heat starts to get going,” leading the weather service to issue another flood alert.\nHighs, she said, are expected to be in the low 80s.\nBut by the weekend, the rain — and much of the pooled water that it left behind — is expected to have dissipated, with more appealing August days with mostly sunny skies, and high temperatures in the mid- to upper-80s.\nContact Frank Witsil: 313-222-5022 or fwitsil@freepress.com.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

    "text": "Shafaqna India: India is forecasted to receive above-normal rainfall in August and September, with the possibility of La Nina conditions developing by late August, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). This heightened rainfall increases the risk of landslides and floods. The monsoon is essential for 52% of India’s cultivated land and for replenishing water reservoirs. The IMD predicts rainfall in August and September to be 106% of the long-period average of 422.8 mm. India has already recorded 453.8 mm of rain, a 2% surplus, since June 1 due to a wetter-than-normal July after a dry June. IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra noted that normal to above-normal rainfall is expected across most of the country, except for parts of the northeast, east India, Ladakh, Saurashtra, Kutch, and areas of central and peninsular India, which might see below-normal rainfall. He also mentioned that the western Himalayan region might experience deficient rainfall. La Nina conditions, which bring cooler-than-normal waters in the central Pacific Ocean aiding monsoon rains in the Indian subcontinent, may set in by the end of August. Above-normal temperatures are expected across much of the country, with normal to below-normal temperatures likely in the Gangetic plains, central India, and the southeast coast. In July, India saw 9% more rainfall than usual, with the central region receiving 33% excess rain. This consistent rainfall for three consecutive monsoon seasons has benefited central India’s agriculture. However, east and northeast India experienced a 23% rainfall deficit, and northwest India saw a 14% deficit, though improvement is expected in August and September. Significant deficits were noted in east Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal, and parts of the northeast, with expected recovery. Rainfall deficits in Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir ranged from 35% to 45%. Central and southern India received surplus rain due to the monsoon trough’s southward position. The Indian monsoon’s variability is influenced by natural factors, but climate change is increasing this variability, leading to more extreme weather and dry spells.",

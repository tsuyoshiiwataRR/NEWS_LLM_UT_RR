    "text": "By Mike Rizzo ,\n2 hours ago\n\"\nStorm Watch Team Meteorologist Mike Rizzo says there are numerous heat advisories and heat warnings in effect across the state today for high heat and humidity creating feel like temperatures that exceed 100 degrees. It's another scorcher of a day with high temperatures pushing beyond 100 degrees. There's a better chance for thunderstorms today and Saturday with a piece of upper atmospheric energy aligning itself with the ground-level heat and humidity. Some thunderstorms may produce strong gusts upwards of 40 mph with lightning and downpours capable of producing brief flooding. The storms today arrive by 3 p.m. and move from northwest to southeast across the state. It will cross over the New Jersey Turnpike by 5 p.m. and reach the beaches by 6:30/7 p.m. The storms will exit and dissipate with the sunset by 9 p.m. Saturday is a repeat of today with the same chances for afternoon and evening storms. Sunday looks a bit better, with fewer storms and slightly cooler weather, but still very warm with highs in the upper 80s. Weather early next week looks good but the forecast for the late week is subject to change based on how a tropical disturbance develops over Florida this weekend. \" Expand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "The advisory was for Allegheny, Beaver and Washington counties.\n\"The Flood Advisory will expire at 9:15 a.m. this morning for portions of southwest and western Pennsylvania, including the following areas, in southwest Pennsylvania, Allegheny and Washington. In western Pennsylvania, Beaver. The heavy rain has ended. Flooding is no longer expected to pose a threat. Please continue to heed remaining road closures,\" says the National Weather Service.\nYour guide to weather alerts: advisories, watches, and warnings Flash flood warning: Take action! A flash flood warning is issued when a flash flood is either imminent or already occurring. In flood-prone areas, it's crucial to move immediately to higher ground. A flash flood is a sudden and violent inundation that can develop within minutes to hours, and it can even happen in areas not currently experiencing rainfall.\nFlood warning: Take action! A flood warning is declared when flooding is on the verge of happening or is already underway.\nFlood advisory: Be aware: A flood advisory is issued when flooding is not expected to be bad enough to issue a warning. However, it may cause significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised, it could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property.\nFlood watch: Be prepared: A flood watch is issued when conditions are favorable for flooding. It doesn't guarantee that flooding will occur, but it signifies that the possibility exists.\nWeather service flood safety guidelines: Weathering the storm Floods can pose a significant threat, especially if you live in a flood-prone area or find yourself camping in a low-lying region. To ensure your safety, the weather service offers essential flood safety guidelines:\nMove to higher ground:\nIf you reside in a flood-prone region or are camping in low-lying terrain, the first step to safety is relocating to higher ground.\nFollow evacuation orders:\nIf local authorities issue an evacuation order, heed it promptly. Prior to leaving, secure your home by locking it.\nDisconnect utilities and appliances:\nIf time permits, disconnect your utilities and appliances. This precaution minimizes electrical hazards during flooding.\nSteer clear of flooded basements and submerged areas:\nSteer clear of basements or rooms where water has submerged electrical outlets or cords. This helps prevent electrical accidents.\nSwift evacuation for your safety:\nIf you notice sparks or hear buzzing, crackling, snapping, or popping noises, evacuate immediately. Avoid any water that may be charged with electricity.\nStay away from floodwaters:\nNever attempt to walk through floodwaters. Even just 6 inches of swiftly moving water can forcefully knock you off your feet.\nSeek high ground if trapped:\nShould you become trapped by moving water, reach the highest point possible and dial 911 to contact emergency services.\nDuring heavy rainfall, the risk of flooding is heightened, especially in low-lying and flood-prone regions. Always remember never to drive through water on the road, no matter how shallow it appears. According to the weather service, as little as 12 inches of rapidly flowing water can carry away most vehicles. Stay safe by being prepared and informed.\nNavigating heavy rain: Essential safety measures for wet roads Rain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these weather service tips to ensure safety during heavy rainfall:\nBeware of swollen waterways:\nAvoid parking or walking in close proximity to culverts or drainage ditches, as the swiftly moving water during heavy rain can potentially carry you away.\nMaintain safe driving distances:\nThe two-second rule for following distance is your ally in heavy rain. Extend it to four seconds to ensure safe spacing in adverse conditions.\nSlow down and drive with care:\nOn wet roads, reducing your speed is crucial. Ease off the gas pedal gradually and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.\nChoose your lane wisely:\nStick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water.\nPrioritize visibility:\nEnhance your visibility in heavy rain by activating your headlights. Be particularly vigilant for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.\nWatch out for slippery roads:\nBe extra careful during the first half hour after rain begins. Grime and oil on the road surface mix with water to make the road slippery.\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\nLarge trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely.\nMind your windshield wipers:\nOverloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots. If the roadside is your only option, pull off as far as possible, preferably past the end of a guard rail, and wait until the storm passes. Keep your headlights on and turn on emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position. In the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

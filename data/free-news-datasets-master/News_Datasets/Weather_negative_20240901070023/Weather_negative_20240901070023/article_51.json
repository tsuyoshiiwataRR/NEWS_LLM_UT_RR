    "text": "TUESDAY, AUGUST 6, 2024 TODAY: Partly Cloudy, Hot and Humid Chance Evening Storms Highs: 90-95 Heat Index: 95-100 Winds: Southwest 5-10 mph Partly cloudy, hot, and humid with a chance for late-day showers and storms. A few storms could be strong to severe, with some gusty winds possible 7-11 pm. TONIGHT: Scattered Storms Possible Warm and Muggy Lows: 70s Winds: South 4-8 mph Scattered thunderstorms are possible, some of which could be strong to severe. Damaging winds are the biggest threat. WEDNESDAY: Partly Cloudy, Scattered Storms Highs: 81-86 Winds: East 5-10 mph Influence from a weakening tropical system may bring more widespread chances at showers and storms. The First Alert Weather Team will closely monitor the tropics in the coming days. THURSDAY: Scattered Showers and Storms Highs: 75-80 Winds: East 5-10 mph Widespread rain is likely due to the remnants of Debby moving through the region. FRIDAY: Rain Likely, Potentially Heavy Highs: 75-80 Winds: East 5-10 mph Widespread rain is likely due to the remnants of Debby moving through the region. Rain could become quite heavy Friday afternoon through Saturday afternoon. Tropical Update: Tropical Storm Debby Debby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane near the Big Bend region of Florida on Monday and is now a tropical storm again. Latest forecast has it stalling out over the Carolinas through about Wednesday. After that, a weakened Debby will start to trek northward toward the Mid-Atlantic. However, a slight shift east could mean drier conditions, while a shift to the west could mean wetter conditions. Regardless, relief from the heat and drought is likely as we are trending cloudier, cooler and wetter through Saturday. Stay tuned for the latest updates.

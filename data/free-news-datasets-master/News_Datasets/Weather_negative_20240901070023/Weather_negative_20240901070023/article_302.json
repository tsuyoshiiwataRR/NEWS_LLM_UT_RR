    "text": "Alappuzha: In recent years, Northern Kerala has been experiencing rainfall comparable to areas with light cloudbursts. Experts have observed that this intense rainfall pattern, previously observed in the Konkan region of the Western Ghats, north of Mangaluru until 2019, has now extended southward to northern Kerala. \"In Wayanad's western region, approximately 50 percent of areas bordering Malappuram and Kozhikode districts are prone to landslides . The Mundakkai area near Meppadi is a particularly disaster-prone area. The area is also very close to Puthumala, where a landslide happened in 2019. Geological factors and changes in cloud structure have been identified as key contributors to these disasters. A study following the Puthumala event revealed the formation of thick cumulonimbus clouds at high altitudes in the Arabian Sea region of Kerala, similar to those observed in Mundakkai during the recent landslide,\" said Dr. S. Abhilash, Director of the Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research (ACARR) at Kochi University of Science and Technology (CUSAT). Heavy Rainfall Changes in the monsoon pattern are visible in Kerala. The heavy rainfall has increased. Rainfall is a major factor in landslides as well as geographical features. -Dr. Roxy Mathew Koll (Meteorologist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune) It was the continuous heavy rainfall that caused the landslide in Chooralmala. The area is steep, and the soil is of the black laterite category. It holds water well. If the pressure is too much, it will be pushed out quickly. -Dr. M. G. Manoj (Scientist, Cusat Radar Research Centre) Pattern of Rainfall There has been a change in the nature of rainfall in Kerala. During the monsoon season, the total rainfall tends to fall heavily within a short period of time. -Dr. Gopakumar Cholayil (Senior Scientific Officer)",

    "text": "By Advance Local Weather Alerts A report was issued from the National Weather Service on Friday at 5:29 a.m. for strong thunderstorms until 5:45 a.m. for Delaware County.\nWind gusts of up to 40 mph and marble-sized hail (0.5 inches) are expected.\n\"At 5:28 a.m., Doppler radar tracked a strong thunderstorm near Shehawken, or 15 miles south of Deposit, moving northeast at 45 mph,\" says the weather service. \"Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects. Minor hail damage to vegetation is possible.\"\nLocations impacted by the alert include Hancock, Shehawken, Starlight, Equinunk, Orson, Lake Como, Preston Park and Lakewood.\nAccording to the weather service, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.\"\nWhen lightning looms: Expert safety tips for thunderstorms Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away.\nTo guarantee your safety in the midst of a thunderstorm, take into account the following recommendations:\nLightning safety plan:\nWhen venturing outdoors, it's crucial to have a lightning safety plan in place. Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby. Seek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors. Indoors safety measures:\nOnce you've found shelter indoors, abstain from using corded phones, electrical appliances, or plumbing fixtures, and refrain from approaching windows and doors. Lightning can follow conductive pathways, and these precautions reduce the risk of electrical surges. Wait for the all-clear:\nAfter the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. It's important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution. When indoor shelter isn't available:\nIf you find yourself outdoors with no access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:\nAvoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk. Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In forested areas, stay close to lower stands of trees. If you're in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people. Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If you have no alternative, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. It's crucial to note that a tent provides no protection against lightning. Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks. In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety.\nMastering wet roads: Safety tips for heavy rainfall When heavy rain strikes, safety is paramount. Equip yourself with these guidelines from the weather service to navigate wet roads and avoid hazards:\nBeware of swollen waterways:\nIn heavy rain, refrain from parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a grave danger.\nMaintain safe driving distances:\nThe two-second rule for following distance is your ally in heavy rain. Extend it to four seconds to ensure safe spacing in adverse conditions.\nReduce speed and drive cautiously:\nOn wet roads, reducing your speed is crucial. Ease off the gas pedal gradually and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.\nChoose your lane wisely:\nStick to the middle lanes on multi-lane roads to minimize the risk of hydroplaning, as water tends to accumulate in outer lanes.\nPrioritize visibility\nEnhance your visibility in heavy rain by turning on your headlights. Watch out for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.\nWatch out for slippery roads:\nThe initial half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mixture of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\nDon't follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely.\nMind your windshield wipers:\nOverloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely limits your sight, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or protected spots.\nWhen stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.\nIn the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

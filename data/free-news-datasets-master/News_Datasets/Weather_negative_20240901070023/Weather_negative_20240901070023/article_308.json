    "text": "About six weather stations across Delhi recorded over 100 mm of rain in a single day, the India Meteorological Department said on August 1 and categorised it as an “extremely intense spell”. However, IMD’s Director General of Meteorology, Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, clarified that the intense rain seen by the city was not a cloudburst.\nBesides Delhi, several northern states saw a massive bout of rainfall and reported a number of deaths.\nIn its latest weather update, the IMD has yet again predicted extremely heavy rainfall for several states.\nExtremely heavy rainfall in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh\nAs per the IMD, isolated extremely heavy rainfall is very likely over Madhya Maharashtra and East Madhya Pradesh today and tomorrow, and over the Konkan & Goa, West Madhya Pradesh, and the Gujarat region on August 3.\nHeavy to very heavy rainfall is expected at isolated places over Konkan & Goa, Madhya Maharashtra, and the Gujarat region from August 1 to 5; Madhya Pradesh from August 1 to 4; Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh from August 1 to 3; and Saurashtra & Kutch on August 3.\nHeavy rainfall is also likely at isolated places over Marathwada on August 3 and Saurashtra & Kutch on August 4.\nHeavy rainfall in Himachal, Uttrakhand\nThere is a possibility of isolated very heavy rainfall over Uttarakhand on August 2 and 3; and East Rajasthan from August 2 to 4.\nIsolated heavy rainfall is very likely over Jammu-Kashmir and Rajasthan from August 2 to 5; Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand from August 2 to 7; Uttar Pradesh on August 2 and 3 and on August 6 and 7; and Punjab and Haryana-Chandigarh today.\nIMD’s prediction for August and September\nThe IMD on Thursday said that the country is expected to record above-normal rainfall in August and September. It added that there are good chances of favourable La Nina conditions developing by the end of August. It added that rainfall across India in August and September is expected to be approximately 106 percent of the long-term average of 422.8 mm.\nSince June 1, India has recorded 53.8 mm of rainfall against the normal of 445.8 mm.\nMohapatra said that parts of northeast India, adjoining east India, Ladakh, Saurashtra and Kutch, and pockets of central and peninsular India are expected to record below-normal rainfall in August and September.",

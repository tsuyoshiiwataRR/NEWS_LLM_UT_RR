    "text": "Flooding creates issues across Metro Detroit roadways, communities Heavy storms caused headaches across parts of Wayne County and southern Macomb County on Friday, flooding streets, highways and basements. A flash flood advisory was in place most of Friday for southwestern Macomb County and northeastern Wayne County, including cities such as Detroit, Eastpointe, Center Line, Grosse Pointe Woods, Hamtramck, Harper Woods, Highland Park, Roseville, St., Clair Shores, and Warren. City officials in some southern Macomb County communities spent all day Friday addressing flooding issues, from towing 19 cars stuck in water on one roadway to dealing with calls from residents about flooded basements. Warren Mayor Lori Stone said \"torrential\" rainfall hit the city, starting late Thursday night and spilling into Friday. The city's south end received approximately 2 inches of rainfall in about one hour, while at least 3 inches of rain fell within one hour in the north end, she said. \"This storm inundated the City’s infrastructure which, like most 70-year-old infrastructure, was only designed to accommodate rain events of 2 inches or less,\" said Stone in a statement late Friday. She said city officials from multiple departments including public works, sanitation, police and fire were working to address flooding concerns. She said the city's sanitation workers planned to pick waste from flooded homes Saturday. Flooding also shut down several highways early Friday, including part of the Southfield Freeway in Wayne County, Interstate 696 at 11 Mile and at Interstate 94 at 12 Mile in Macomb County. In Clinton Township, Hayes Road between Clinton River Road and Utica Road and Millar Road between Utica Road and Garfield Road in Clinton Township also were closed due to flooding. And Hoover Road south of 12 Mile also sustained heavy flooding, said Stone; 19 vehicles had to be towed. The National Weather Service said an estimated two inches to three inches of rain fell over the region. And meteorologists with the service predicted scattered to numerous thunderstorms would come later Friday, dropping another 1 inch to 2 inches of rain on the region by Saturday morning. \"These storms are not likely to be severe, but heavy rainfall rates may cause localized minor flooding, especially across urban, low-lying and flood-prone areas,\" the weather service said. For homeowners in part of Warren, Roseville and St. Clair Shores, the latest dousing of rain meant flooded basements. Many residents posted pictures on social media of flooded basements. One local basement cleanup company said it had received multiple calls about flooded basements in Warren. \"We have our teams out pumping out water & running air movers & fans,\" posted Trash Bully's Dumpsters & Home Improvement on Facebook. St. Clair Shores officials on Friday said their staff worked through the night Friday to address flooding that resulted from heavy and intense rainfall. \"Our Public Works crews are working to remedy flooded streets and aid our residents,\" said the city in a statement. Power outages Most of Michigan's power company customers Friday had not lost service in the storms. DTE Energy said only about 3,400 of its more than 2.2 million customers were without electricity Friday. Consumers Energy reported about 1,000 of its customers were in the dark while the other 99.9 percent did not have their service interrupted. Freeway accident The flooding played a role in an accident on the Southfield Freeway early Friday morning. A 33-year-old man, driving a Lincoln at a high rate of speed, struck an MDOT Courtesy Patrol car around 2:25 a.m. on M-39 South and Grand River Avenue as Michigan State Police and MDOT officials were blocking off the freeway for flooding, MSP Second District stated in an X post. MSP had been ramping off traffic at Grand River, while officials placed hazard cones and patrol cars with emergency lights to block to freeway when the accident happened, according to the X post. No one was hurt. The driver showed signs of alcohol impairment and registered at three times the legal blood alcohol content limit of 0.08 percent, First Lt. Mike Shaw told The News. Troopers arrested the driver and took him to the Detroit Detention Center. “We are very fortunate that no one was hurt in this crash.” Shaw said in the X post. “This is another example of the preventable crashes we are seeing due to risky driving behaviors on our roadways.” Forecast The humid weather is expected to persist through Saturday, the weather service said. The heat index is expected to reach near 90 both days, it said. Relief is on the way, though, as a cold front is expected to move through the region Sunday night/Monday, officials said.

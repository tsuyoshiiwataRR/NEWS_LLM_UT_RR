    "text": "Residents with their feet in water and a hospital flooded. This is the toll of the storms that hit the Montmirail area on August 1, report the Marne firefighters.\nWhile 28 residents of the health facility’s nursing home were able to be gathered in an internal multipurpose room, 14 others had to be taken care of in Dormans, Epernay and Aÿ-Champagne. There were no injuries. On the morning of August 2, emergency services are also still carrying out a pumping operation in the Montmirail hospital to avoid technical problems. The crawl spaces are indeed full.\nElsewhere in the Marne commune area, the water rose to more than 1m in some villages. Firefighters carried out around fifty operations, mainly for flooded cellars, but without evacuating any residents. The few power cuts reported around 7pm were fixed around 10pm by Enedis, thanks to the installation of two generators.\nIn the Ardennes, firefighters were called 150 times on August 1st and intervened in about fifteen municipalities following the bad weather. In Jaudun, Mayor François Garcia explained that 70 mm of rain fell in less than an hour. About fifteen homes were affected. Water levels also rose in other municipalities, including Launois-sur-Vence.",

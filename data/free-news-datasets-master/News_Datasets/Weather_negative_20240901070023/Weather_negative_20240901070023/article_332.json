    "text": "Japan's weather agency said on Thursday that the past month was the hottest July since records began in 1898.\nThe national average temperature for July was 2.16 degrees Celsius above the baseline average calculated from 1991 to 2020, marking the highest recorded in over 120 years, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).\nThis marked the second consecutive year that Japan has broken its average July temperature record.\nPeople walk on the crosswalk while the temperature rising in Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture on July 29, 2024. The highest temperature in central Kyoto was 39.4 degrees Celsius. (Photos: CFP)\nA JMA report indicated that a strong Pacific high-pressure system dominated throughout July, which led to eastern and western Japan, as well as Okinawa and Amami regions, being enveloped in warm air masses. Out of 153 meteorological observation stations nationwide, 62 reported their highest average temperatures for the month.\nDogs cool off in a fountain at a park in Hamamatsu in Shizuoka Prefecture, central Japan, amid scorching summer heat on July 29, 2024.\nThe JMA warned that high temperatures would persist across Japan. During the first half of August, many regions are expected to experience days of extreme heat, with maximum temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius. The agency advised the public to stay informed through temperature forecasts and heatstroke alerts and to take appropriate measures to prevent heat-related illnesses.\nâ€‹",

    "text": "ANDERSON — Four times since 1996, Sharon Johnson Hilligoss has had her home on Kayhill Drive flooded by waters from Shady Run. Hilligoss and Martina Miller are spearheading an effort to stop the flooding in the Northcrest Addition. They are looking for solutions from the city of Anderson and Anderson Community Schools Corp. Shady Run weaves into the Northcrest Addition from Lindberg Road, runs underneath Scatterfield Road and Alexandria Pike and eventually empties into Shadyside Lake. The housing addition was built in 1955 on a former farm field and Shady Run, a natural stream, runs through the site. Hilligoss said the city built a berm along Shady Run in 2019 that was intended to stop the flooding onto her property. Miller and Hilligoss have requested assistance from the Anderson City Council to alleviate the flooding problem. Anderson City engineer Matt House indicated in a letter in June that the city was going to clear overgrown trees, brush and accumulated sediments. David Eicks, chairman of the Anderson Board of Public Works, said the work will start in the near future. Hilligoss and Miller met with House, council members Greg Graham and Jennifer Culp and a representative from the school system. Miller, who lives on Crestwood Drive, said the problem is that there was supposed to be a retention pond built behind Eastside Elementary School to regulate the flow of water into the housing addition. She said the retention pond is not working properly, with water from the farm fields running into Northcrest. Culp said Shady Run is not regulated by the city or county because it is considered a stream by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. “It’s regulated by the state,” she said. “There have been problems for years.” Culp said she hopes the city can take responsibility for regulating the drain in the future. “There is more water flowing in from all over,” she said. “It’s a very discouraging situation. It has been one thing after another. We have to help these people.” Graham said the school system is looking into the problem with the retention pond. “We had a good discussion,” he said. “We’re looking to try and make it better. “It would be a good start to clean out the waterway,” Graham added. “The water is coming from behind the school. The stream can’t handle the water. I hope the school will do some retention pond work.”",

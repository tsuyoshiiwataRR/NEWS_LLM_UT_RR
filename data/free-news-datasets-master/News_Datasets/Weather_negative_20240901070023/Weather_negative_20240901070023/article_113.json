    "text": "…RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT THROUGH 8PM FRIDAY FOR DRY THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS OF LOS ANGELES, VENTURA, AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES AND THE SANTA CLARITA VALLEY… .Convection over Mexico has created an upper level disturbance which will move through southwest California. This disturbance and associated influx of monsoonal moisture will bring an increasing risk of thunderstorms through Saturday. This risk is over all areas, including coastal areas. This risk will be highest through Friday, closest to Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, and over the mountains and deserts. A low level dry layer will evaporate most if not all rain under any storms, with a risk of dry lightning capable of igniting fires. While still a low certainty scenario in terms of frequency and areal coverage of any dry lightning, considering the recent extended heatwaves and rapidly drying fuels, a significant fire-weather risk will exist. A Red Flag Warning has been issued as a result. Any thunderstorm will also be capable of producing erratic outflow winds, gusting upwards of 45 to 60 mph. * THUNDERSTORMS…Increasing risk of isolated dry thunderstorms, capable of lightning-induced ignitions with little to no precipitation. * OUTFLOW WINDS…Strong and erratic outflow winds produced by the dry thunderstorms, locally gusting to 45 to 60 mph, will have the potential to cause rapid spread of any ongoing fires, as well as any new fires. * IMPACTS…There is an increasing risk for lightning cause fire ignitions. With gusty outflow wind potential, conditions are also favorable for extreme fire behavior and growth if ignition occurs, which would threaten life and property. A Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now, or will shortly. Use extreme caution with anything that can spark a wildfire. Residents near wildland interfaces should be prepared to evacuate if a wildfire breaks out. See readyforwildfire.org and wildfirerisk.org for information.",

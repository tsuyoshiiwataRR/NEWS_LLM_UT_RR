    "text": "By Lindsay Shachnow ,\n5 hours ago Wu issued a heat advisory Aug. 1 through Aug. 3. Nelson Figueiredo wipes his brow while working in Downtown Boston on a hot day. Andrew Burke-Stevenson for The Boston Globe Mayor Michelle Wu issued a heat advisory for Boston from Aug. 1 through Aug. 3, due to the upcoming high temperatures .\nOver the next few days, temperatures will be in the high 80s and the heat index is expected to be in the 90s, reaching Boston’s current heat advisory threshold of three days or more of 90 degrees heat index, sustained for two or more hours per day, according to a statement from the Emergency Management Office.\n“With the forecast for the coming days reaching extreme temperatures, we encourage all residents to take time to prepare,” Wu said in the statement. “Staying hydrated, taking breaks from working outside, and paying attention to your health are important steps for ensuring our city remains healthy and cool during this hot and humid period.”\nBoston Emergency Medical Services usually sees a 10-15% increase in emergency calls during a heatwave, the office wrote.\nIn anticipation of hotter summer days like these, the City of Boston published a Heat Resilience Solutions report to better prepare local communities and city infrastructure for the effects of intense heat.\nBoston public library locations are open to retreat from the heat, and emergency shelters at 112 Southampton St., a men’s shelter, and at 794 Massachusetts Ave., a women’s shelter, are air-conditioned and open 24 hours.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

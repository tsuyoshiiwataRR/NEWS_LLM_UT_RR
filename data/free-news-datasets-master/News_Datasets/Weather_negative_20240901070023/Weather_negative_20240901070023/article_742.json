    "text": "The India Meteorological Department (IMD) announced on Thursday that rainfall in the second half of the monsoon season, covering August and September, is most likely to be 'above normal' due to a strong possibility of La Nina conditions forming by the end of this month. This prediction follows a period of irregular rainfall distribution earlier in the rainy season, with July concluding 9% above normal despite a dry June.Though there may be a short break in the monsoon phase in mid-August, this will not significantly affect the overall rainfall for the two crucial months central to Kharif sowing and crop growth. However, the potential for La Nina conditions in September raises concerns about city flooding, low-lying area floods, and landslides in hilly regions.La Nina is characterized by a periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific, which typically correlates with good monsoon rainfall in India. Nonetheless, certain regions are expected to experience below-normal rainfall, similar to the eight states that saw shortages in July.“During the second half of the monsoon season, normal to above normal rainfall is most likely over most parts of the country, except many parts of northeast and adjoining areas of east India, Ladakh, Saurashtra & Kutch, and some isolated pockets of central and peninsular India where below normal rainfall is likely,” said IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.Releasing the forecast for August, Mohapatra said, “Normal to above normal rainfall is likely over many parts of the country this month, except many areas in southern parts of central and adjoining northern peninsular India, northeast and adjoining areas of east India, some parts of northwest and south peninsular India, where below normal rainfall is likely.”India saw an 11% monsoon rainfall deficit in June; however, sowing operations persisted with irrigation support from groundwater resources. The skewed rainfall distribution was balanced out in July, which closed with a 9% surplus in rains. This surplus aided farmers in expanding the sown area to 812 lakh hectares by last Friday, which is 18 lakh hectares more than the same period last year.The overall increase in rainfall during July helped farmers to boost acreages in rain-fed areas, supporting agricultural activities despite initial concerns of a deficit. This has been a crucial factor in ensuring the continuity and success of Kharif cropping in various parts of the country.",

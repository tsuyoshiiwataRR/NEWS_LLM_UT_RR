    "text": "Japan has just seen itself through its hottest July recorded since 126 years ago, reported The Asahi Shimbun .\nThis is the second consecutive year of record-breaking temperatures for Japan.\nThis year, the average July temperature was 26.22 °C, the highest ever since 1898 from when such data was first available.\nAccording to the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) , temperatures reached 2.16°C higher than average , topping last year’s July record of 1.91°C above average.\nThe cause behind the heat is said to be due to a strong high-pressure system in the Pacific Ocean, westerly winds bringing in warm air, and global warming.\nHeatstroke alerts issued\nAs a precautionary measure, heatstroke alerts have been issued by the JMA for 38 of Japan’s 47 prefectures, according to The Japan Times .\nAs temperatures soared, data drawn from the Japan’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA) showed that 12,666 people were transported to hospitals in the week of Jul. 22 to Jul. 28 alone due to heat-related illnesses.\nOn Jul. 7, six people died from heatstroke in Tokyo, and temperatures reached over 40°C in Shizuoka prefecture .\nThe Mainichi and The Guardian previously reported that the surge in heat-related illnesses have stretched local hospitals to their limits.\nThis led to the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine to revise its three-level classification of heatstroke severity to a four-level one, with a \"most severe\" category to be added later this year.\nFor now, the heat is expected to continue through August and beyond, The Asahi Shimbun reported the head of the JMA's climate information division’s forecast team, Masayuki Hirai as saying.\nExtreme heat across the globe\nIt is not just Japan that has been experiencing extreme heatwaves. Record-breaking temperatures have been observed all over the world.\nIn Barcelona, Spain , temperatures have peaked at 40°C, the highest in at least 110 years of records.\nLikewise, Bangkok, Thailand experienced a wave earlier this April that killed 30 individuals.\nAccording to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service which has tracked global weather patterns since 1940, the world saw its hottest day on Jul. 21 this year.\nThe International Labour Organisation reported that h eat alone is estimated to kill almost half a million people a year.\nHow to manage heat stress\nHow our bodies manage heat stress is dependent on our age and lifestyle.\nAs temperatures increase globally, it’s important to protect yourself from the heat.\nCheck out these tips to manage heat stress as outlined by the National Environment Agency.\nTop photo from 1986 0125 / Unsplash",

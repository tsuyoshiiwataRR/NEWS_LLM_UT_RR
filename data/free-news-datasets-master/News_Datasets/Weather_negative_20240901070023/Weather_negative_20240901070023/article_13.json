    "text": "Santiago Experiences Record-Breaking Dry July For the first time since records began, Santiago and surrounding areas in Chile experienced a completely dry July. Experts attribute this anomaly to a prolonged drought and climate change, highlighting the likelihood of more such dry spells in the future. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 02-08-2024 02:46 IST | Created: 02-08-2024 02:46 IST For the first time since records began, Santiago and Chile's metropolitan region experienced not a single drop of rain this July. Meteorologist Alicia Moya from Chile's government confirmed that multiple stations recorded zero millimeters of precipitation. Moya emphasized that this is unprecedented since the 1950s, marking an extraordinarily dry July unusual for the austral winter. The ongoing decade-long drought in Chile continues to inflict severe implications. Despite heavy rains in June, the drought has not relented. Raul Cordero, a climatologist at the University of Santiago, noted that the city usually receives about 50 millimeters of rain in July, making this year's readings even more alarming. He attributed the dry conditions to climate change and the La Nina phenomenon, warning that such dry spells are likely to become more common. (With inputs from agencies.)",

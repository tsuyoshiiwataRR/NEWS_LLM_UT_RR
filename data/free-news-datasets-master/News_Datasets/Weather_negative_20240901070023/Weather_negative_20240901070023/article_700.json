    "text": "Heat warnings issued for areas west of HRM with a hot, sticky long weekend in the forecast\nPosted Aug 2, 2024 05:29:25 05:32:19 AM.\nHRM is not included in a heat warning that is now in effect for most of the Maritimes, but it will be a hot stick day today.\nThe western half of Nova Scotia, along with all of PEI and New Brunswick, are under a warning issued by Environment Canada Friday. The warning is for temperatures ranging from 27 to 30 degrees in some areas before the humidity is factored in. Humidex values in those areas could exceed 36 degrees.\nHere in HRM, we will see some fog to start the day on Friday, then a mix of sun and cloud. Today’s high temperature is 28 degrees, but with the humidity factored in, that could feel more like 36.\nThe temperature will be much cooler along the Atlantic coast, reaching 19.\nThe long weekend forecast for the region is as follows: Saturday will be humid, with feel-like values in the low 30s. Sunday’s daytime high should reach 28, and for the Natal Day Monday, the forecast is calling for a few clouds and a more seasonable 24.",

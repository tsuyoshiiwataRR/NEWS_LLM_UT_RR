    "text": "Kochi: Heavy rains that lashed the city on Thursday noon caused waterlogging at several places. However, as the rain started to subside in the afternoon, water receded from all such points, thereby easing the difficulties caused to the public.Many parts of MG Road, including Pallimukku and Shenoy’s Junction, got inundated in the rains. “The rain subsided after almost an hour. This helped in avoiding flooding in the city. But many places in the city, especially MG Road, faced moderate waterlogging for almost an hour,” said K S Dileep Kumar, president of Ernakulam Vikasana Samithi, an NGO.Meanwhile, the city corporation’s opposition councillors said the recent rains did not worsen the waterlogging situation in the city, as the showers were brief and intermittent. “In most cases it rained during low tide. This helped to avoid a situation where the entire city got flooded,” said M G Aristotle, councillor from Kathrikkadavu. “Desilting of major canals like Thevara-Perandoor has not been completed so far. The Ombudsman for local bodies had asked the corporation to complete desilting of the mouths of Thevara-Perandoor canals by Aug. Moreover, a project started in 2018 to beautify the canals still remains incomplete,” Aristotle said. “The culverts across the city's railway lines have not been desilted either,” he said.However, corporation secretary Chelsa Sini refused to comment on the measures taken by the local body to contain waterlogging.District collector NSK Umesh said there has been some let-up in the rains since Thursday afternoon. “The water levels in Periyar, Muvattupuzhayar, and Chalakkudy rivers are receding. So, no rain-related calamities were reported from any part of the district ,” Umesh said.We also published the following articles recentlyIMD issues red alert for Delhi NCR after heavy rains, waterlogging at several placesThe India Meteorological Department issued a red alert for Delhi and NCR due to heavy rainfall, causing significant traffic congestion and flight diversions.

By Daniel Niemasz Published: Aug. 2, 2024 at 7:42 AM EDT | Updated: 3 hours ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nBRIDGEPORT, W.Va (WDTV) - Good morning NCWV! We started this morning with a few light rain showers in our area as another frontal system crosses over our area. These few rain showers are still moving through the area but will completely leave the area by 9:00 AM. These rain showers and storms will return to the area this evening, with us receiving approximately a half inch of rainfall throughout the rest of today. Higher amounts are possible in thunderstorms. This allows flash flooding to be possible especially in low-lying areas as well as poor drainage areas. High temperatures today are starting to lower, getting into the mid to high 80s in the lowlands and the low 80s in the higher elevations. These storms do have severe potential with wind gusts up getting up to 30 MPH.\nTomorrow’s conditions are going to be very similar to today’s, rain showers and storms throughout the afternoon and evening with a few chances during the morning hours. Highs will drop even further tomorrow, getting into the low to mid 80s in the lowlands and the mid 70s in the higher elevations. Now, in terms of severity, chances for severity have moved towards the east coast and we don’t see much in terms of severe thunderstorms.\nHigh pressure will settle into the area on Sunday afternoon, with us seeing mostly clear to partly cloudy skies throughout the area. Highs will rise into the high 80s and low 90s in the lowlands and the low 80s in the higher elevations.\nDaniel Niemasz has all of this and more on your First Alert Forecast.\nCopyright 2024 WDTV.

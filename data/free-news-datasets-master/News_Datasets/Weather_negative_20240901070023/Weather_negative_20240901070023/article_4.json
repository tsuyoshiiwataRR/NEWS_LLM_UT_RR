    "text": "Due to the extreme heat forecast, Mayor Bowser has activated the [Districtâ€™s Heat Emergency Plan](https://hsema.dc.gov/page/heat-emergency-plan-information) for Thursday, August 1, 2024. When the temperature or heat index in the District is forecasted to be 95 degrees or higher, the District Government implements the Heat Emergency Plan and activates cooling centers for community members to seek relief from the heat. A list of District cooling center locations is available at [heat.dc.gov](http://heat.dc.gov/). Extreme heat is dangerous and can cause illnesses and death. As temperatures rise, you are encouraged to take an active role in your safety and take action to stay cool. - Stay indoors: Find places in the shade or with air conditioning to seek relief from the heat. - Check on your neighbors: Young children, the elderly, and those with disabilities or other access and functional needs are the most vulnerable in our community. If you or someone you know needs free, accessible transportation to a cooling center, please call the shelter hotline at 202-399-7093 or dial 311. - Drink plenty of water and wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing. GW has [water bottle refill station locations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OXp17Yr3TlJwHYE4ZkWVuAcRSprxRvLA9BCKdeLmvMM/edit?gid=1161067707#gid=1161067707)to help keep you hydrated. - Do not leave children, pets, or service animals in vehicles, as they can reach dangerous temperatures within 10 minutes. - For all animal emergencies, including animals left outside in extreme temperatures or in vehicles, call the Humane Rescue Alliance at 202-723-5730. Pet and service animal owners should keep animals indoors, walk them early in the morning, and give them plenty of water.

    "text": "BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (WBKO) - The weather is settling down this evening for the most part. There could still be another isolated shower or storm on the overnight, but nothing severe expected. FRIDAY: We could start Friday with some passing showers before a few pop back up later in the day. Temperatures will be a little cooler overall as highs only top out in the upper 80s. Feel-like temperatures are expected to be in the middle 90s. THE WEEKEND AND BEYOND: DRIER WEATHER AHEAD: Saturday could bring a few more showers during the day, but our forecast looks to dry out heading into Sunday and the start of the week. HEAT CONTINUES: Friday and Saturday will be a bit cooler than the past few days, but we will get back into the lower and middle 90s on Sunday and into next week. The heat index will likely also exceed 100Â° as well.

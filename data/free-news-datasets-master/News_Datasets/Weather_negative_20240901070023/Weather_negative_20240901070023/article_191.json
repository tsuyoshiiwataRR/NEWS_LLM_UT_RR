Most conducive area for thunderstorms this weekend is Klamath County, but a possibility even across southern Lane early on Saturday morning. We will see air quality improvements from southwest flow on Saturday, but some of the worst is expected towards Friday, nothing worse than moderate range for Corvallis and Eugene. By Sunday, smoke will likely build back for most with more improvements and slightly cooler temperature with an upper-level trough \"extension of low pressure\" next week. Extreme fire threat with abundant lightning for some and hazardous air quality for others. Stay up to date on weather and air quality changes this weekend. Weather Alert ...HEAT ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 11 PM PDT THIS EVENING... * WHAT...Temperatures up to 99. * WHERE...Portions of northwest and west central Oregon and southwest Washington. * WHEN...Until 11 PM PDT this evening. * IMPACTS...Hot temperatures may cause heat illnesses. PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS... Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sunshine, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Take extra precautions when outside. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing. Try to limit strenuous activities to early morning or evening. Take action when you see symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. To reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments.

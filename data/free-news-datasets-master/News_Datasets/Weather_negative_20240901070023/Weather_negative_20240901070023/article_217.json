This portion of the MCS produced a\n49 kt gust near London, KY, and will pose the greatest relative\nthreat for damaging wind. A gradual weakening trend is expected\nlater tonight, as MLCINH begins to increase and downstream buoyancy\ndecreases, but in the short term, warm/moist conditions and MLCAPE\nof greater than 1500 J/kg will support at least isolated\ndamaging-wind potential through much of the evening.\n..Dean.. 08/02/2024\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\nATTN...WFO...RNK...RLX...MRX...JKL...\nLAT...LON 36458371 37038335 37868270 37648167 36858188 36108255\n36048420 36268395 36458371",

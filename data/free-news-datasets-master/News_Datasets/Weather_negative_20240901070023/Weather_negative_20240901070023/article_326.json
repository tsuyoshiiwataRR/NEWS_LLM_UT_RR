    "text": "Rayan El Jamal was on her back porch with her family when the storm hit. I thought that there would be a deeper root holding it. I&#039;ve never thought it would fall off actually this easily, She says. The sky went black, the winds picked up, and a large tree in her front yard fell. Thankfully, it wasn&#039;t the other way. We felt on the on the House. It spared her house, but for Susan Bellmore, who was working in the barbershop across the street at the time. They&#039;re kind of devastated when you see you&#039;re not leaving and there&#039;s a big massive tree on your truck. Bellmore says even with her truck buried, she was lucky. It&#039;s amazing that there wasn&#039;t more damage. Across town, the Red Water Community Golf Course was also in the storm&#039;s path. It just sounds like the roof was just going to come off the building. And if the winds were really high, like I&#039;ve never seen that high, you&#039;re here ever. Paul Dahlman was in the back shop when the weather turned and the rain started coming down. There&#039;s so much stuff flying around. It was everywhere. The storm lasted around 30 minutes and then suddenly the sky cleared, it&#039;s sunny and it&#039;s like nothing happened. When the storm subsided, we went for a tour to see what kind of damage we had, and then that&#039;s where we put the notification out. The course will be closed today and we needed volunteers to help. Volunteers, neighbors and crews were out clearing debris off of roadways and sidewalks. You could hear chainsaws all day so far. So there&#039;s been a lot of work out. For now, the cleanup continues with relief that everyone is safe. Something terrible could have happened, but thankfully it just ended with minor damage.

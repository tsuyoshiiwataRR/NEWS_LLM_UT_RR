    "text": "NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - The extreme heat continues for several more days before a tropical wave gains steam in the Gulf of Mexico.\nWe’ll need to keep our heat plans in place through Saturday as highs soar to the mid to upper 90s. Heat indices of 110 degrees and higher will continue our Heat Advisories issued by the National Weather Service.\nIsolated storms are possible in the afternoon but the higher storm chance arrives Saturday when a weak front drops in from the north. With the extreme heat and high humidity, these storms will need to be watched as they will have the fuel to be strong.\nIf you have Saturday evening plans, check back in with FOX 8 as we’ll give you the latest on where the storms are and how strong they may be.\nThe Tropics: The tropical wave we’ve been monitoring is now called Invest 97-L by the NHC. They call it this simply because it’s being “investigated” and is expected to develop at some point.\nThey give it a 70% chance of a slow development - possibly by the weekend.\nBruce: The tropics are heating up (FOX 8) The wave is moving over several Caribbean Islands this evening. It doesn’t have a defined center so that means models are guessing at where it will go. But the steering current will take it west over Cuba through Friday with a northerly jog this weekend.\nWhere the center forms will dictate where the storm may turn north. But guidance suggests that development in the eastern Gulf is increasing for this weekend.\nBe sure to keep checking in with us as we continue to get new information all day about what could be “Debby”. When we get new information, you will too.\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story? Click Here to report it.

    "text": "Regardless of where you are in the region this weekend, the National Weather Service says you can expect a lot of rain, including a chance of thunderstorms.\nAlso, the last of the heat advisories will expire Friday, and more typical summer high temperatures will prevail in most places during the weekend.\nDutchess County is the only place where the National Weather Service says some extreme heat might hang on for one more day. Forecasts on Thursday were calling for a high of 88 degrees in Dutchess County on Saturday, with heat index values - the so-called \"feels like\" temperature - being as high as 96.\nElsewhere, high temperatures will be in the mid-80s in Orange and Ulster counties, and the low 80s in Sullivan County, on Saturday.\nForecasts in all four counties call for chances of rain, and possibly thunderstorms, periodically throughout the day,\nRainfall amounts will range from one-tenth to one-quarter of an inch in Orange and Ulster counties, to one-quarter to one-half of an inch of rain in Sullivan and Dutchess counties.\nTerroristic threat: Esopus man accused of threatening to blow up an Ulster County building\nHigher amounts than those forecast are always possible in thunderstorms, the National Weather Service says.\nOn Sunday, there again will be chances for showers and possibly a thunderstorm. Like Saturday, the storm chances will come periodically, so you probably won't see wall-to-wall rain either day.\nHigh temperatures on Sunday will be in the mid-80s in Orange, Ulster and Dutchess counties, and around 80 degrees in Sullivan County.\nOvernight low temperatures in all four counties will range from the high 60s to low 70s on both days.\nMike Randall covers breaking news for the Times Herald-Record and the Poughkeepsie Journal.

    "text": "July was traditionally a slow production season, while a lack of demand and extreme weather in some regions led to overall weakness in the auto market, according to the CPCA. China's new energy vehicle (NEV) sales slipped back down last month, as the sector enters a slow season. Wholesale sales of passenger NEVs in China were estimated at 950,000 units in July, up 29 percent year-on-year but 3 percent lower than in June, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said in a report today. In June, manufacturers with wholesale sales of more than 10,000 passenger NEVs contributed 90.6 percent of all wholesale NEV sales, CPCA said. These carmakers have estimated sales of 860,000 units in July, and based on last month's structure, China's July wholesale sales of passenger NEVs would be at around 950,000 units, the CPCA said. In China, NEVs include battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and fuel cell vehicles. Their exact numbers are expected to be announced later this month. July was the traditional low production season, while the lack of market demand, high temperatures, flooding and extreme weather in some areas led to a weak overall automotive market performance, according to the CPCA. Among major automakers, BYD was the top passenger NEV wholesale seller in July at 340,799 units, according to the CPCA. Tesla China came in second with wholesale sales, including exports, of 74,117 vehicles . Geely Auto was third with 59,051 vehicles and Li Auto (NASDAQ: LI) was fourth with 51,000 units. Data released yesterday showed a mixed performance in July deliveries for the major EV makers. Nio (NYSE: NIO) delivered 20,498 vehicles in July , up 0.18 percent year-on-year but down 3.35 percent from June. Xpeng (NYSE: XPEV) delivered 11,145 vehicles in July , up 1.24 percent year-on-year and up 4.47 percent from June. Li Auto (NASDAQ: LI) delivered 51,000 vehicles in July , up 49.41 percent year-on-year and up 6.75 percent from June. Zeekr (NYSE: ZK) delivered 15,655 vehicles in July , up 30.04 percent year-on-year but down 22.14 percent from June.

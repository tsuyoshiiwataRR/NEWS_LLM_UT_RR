According to forecaster Ida Pramuwardani, rainfall levels are predicted to be low to moderate (0-150 mm/decade) from mid-July to early August.\nSeveral regions are expected to experience particularly low rainfall (\n“In early August, rainfall is anticipated to occur in many of these areas,” Ida said.\nImpact of La Nina conditions\nBMKG head Dwikorita Karnawati previously announced that La Nina conditions are expected to bring increased rainfall to several parts of Indonesia. This phenomenon can lead to the formation of rain clouds and a higher likelihood of precipitation.\nThe agency warns that the combination of various weather factors could result in moderate to heavy rain, accompanied by lightning, thunder, and strong winds. Consequently, this could result in extreme weather events or hydrometeorological disasters such as floods, flash floods, tornadoes, and landslides, particularly in central and eastern Indonesia.\nThe BMKG will continue to monitor weather conditions closely and provide updates to the public through its app Info BMKG, social media sites, and local offices.\nANGELINA TIARA PUSPITALOVA\nEditor’s Choice: La Nina Expected Around September, BRIN Forecasts Damp Dry Season in Indonesia\nClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News",

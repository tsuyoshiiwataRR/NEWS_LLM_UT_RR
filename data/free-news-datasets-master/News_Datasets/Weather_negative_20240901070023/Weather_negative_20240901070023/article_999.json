    "text": "[National](/national) Low-lying areas in Ctg city submerged after heavy rains Heavy rains for a few hours in Chattogram city have submerged roads and created widespread waterlogging in the city's low-lying areas. This current situation has also raised concerns about possible landslides. In some areas, vehicular movement has been halted due to flooding. Heavy rain started early Thursday morning (August 1) and the Meteorological Department issued a local cautionary signal number 3 for the Chattogram sea port. The Patenga Meteorological Office recorded 114 mm of rainfall in the last 24 hours, UNB reports. According to weather officials, the rain may continue for the rest of the day and tomorrow. There are chances of intermittent rain with gusty or stormy winds accompanied by lightning. Some parts of the city went under knee-deep water, while others under waist-deep water, causing extreme hardship for people going out for various needs. Roads and alleys in areas including Sholashahar Gate No. 2, Muradpur, Bahaddarhat, Faridarpara, Chandgaon Residential, Katalganj, Kapasgola, Baraipara, DC Road, Bakalia, Chawkbazar Raw Market, Rahmatganj, and Aturar Depot were flooded. Munira Moni, a private bank officer in the Chawkbazar area, said, \"I stepped out of the house to find knee-deep water on the streets. On top of that, there were no rickshaws or CNG autorickshaws. I reached work an hour late.\" Additionally, waterlogging on various city roads created traffic chaos. Most roads in low-lying areas became muddy and waterlogged, making it difficult to walk. Abdul Malek, a resident of Agrabad, said, \"It has been raining since last night. Even light rain causes waterlogging here. Additionally, road construction is ongoing in our area. No vehicles come here due to poor road condition caused by digging. I had to wade through dirty water to get back home after going out to buy breakfast this morning.\" Assistant Meteorologist Ali Akbar Khan of the Patenga Meteorological Office said, \"High variations in air pressure are present in the northern Bay of Bengal and adjoining coastal areas of Bangladesh. This has resulted in the continued formation of deep convective clouds in the northern Bay of Bengal region, leading to moderate to heavy rainfall in Chattogram. This rain is likely to continue for another day or two.\"",

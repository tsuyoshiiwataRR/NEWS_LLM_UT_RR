    "text": "Half monsoon season over, 10 states end with rainfall ‘deficit’ With half of this year&#039;s southwest monsoon season over, nearly 16 states or Union Territories have received normal or above normal rainfall. However, the wait for normal rainfall continues for 10 states or UTs, including Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Haryana, Chandigarh and Punjab. July and August rainfall account for nearly 70 per cent of the country&#039;s seasonal rainfall. This year, the monsoon made its onset in Kerala on May 30 and it covered the entire country on July 2. The monsoon remained largely active to vigorous for the most days in July. There was widespread rainfall recorded over south peninsular and central India regions, which have received 36.5 per cent and 33 per cent surplus rainfall in July. However, subdued rainfall was experienced last month over northwest India, where rainfall deficit was -14.3 per cent, and east and northeast India (-23.3 per cent). The country&#039;s overall rainfall during July was about 109 per cent of the long period average and the seasonal rainfall for the first two months was just about 2 per cent above normal (446.1mm). The monsoon trough, whose north-south oscillation brings abundant rainfall over major parts of the country, remained positioned largely to the south of its normal. Hence, the rainfall activity was concentrated over south peninsula and central India regions during July. Among states in north India, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand received widespread rainfall; but many other states across north, northwest and eastern India regions remained largely dry last month. Rain-bearing systems were fewer with only one monsoon depression which developed around mid-July. Chandigarh (-57 per cent), Manipur (-50 per cent), Jharkhand (-41 per cent), Bihar (-36 per cent), Mizoram (-35 per cent) were among the most rain deficient states or Union Territories. The forecast issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) suggested rainfall activity continuing along the west coast, with chances of heavy rainfall over Kerala, coastal regions of Karnataka and Maharashtra, Kutch, Saurashtra, Gujarat, west Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand till August 4.

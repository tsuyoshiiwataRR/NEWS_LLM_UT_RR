    "text": "A recent report from the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) has revealed a significant increase in job vacancies in [Greece](https://www.iefimerida.gr/tag/greece), raising concerns about the country's labor market. According to the report, the number of job vacancies surged by 58.8% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year. This marked a significant acceleration from the previous year's growth rate of 36.2%. The rise in job vacancies has become a major challenge for the Greek economy, hindering its growth potential. Despite the country's overall economic expansion, the labour shortage has emerged as a significant bottleneck. The Bank of Greece Governor, Yannis Stournaras, has warned that the situation could worsen if immediate steps are not taken to address the shortage. He estimated that there are currently around 200,000 vacant positions in the Greek labour market. The labour shortage is likely due to a combination of factors, including demographic changes, increased economic activity, and competition from other countries for skilled workers. To address the issue, the Greek government may need to implement policies to encourage immigration, improve education and training, and create a more flexible labour market.

    "text": "A large distribution center in Dauphin County is closing.\nDHL Supply Chain filed a notice with the Department of Labor & Industry notifying the state that the facility at 2771 N. Market St. in Londonderry Township, near Elizabethtown, is closing and 268 people will be laid off. The facility is about 20 minutes from downtown Harrisburg.\nThe facility will close on Nov. 10.\nDHL Supply Chain operates the facility for Boohoo , an online fashion retailer based in the United Kingdom. It was first announced in 2022 that Boohoo had leased the entire 1.1 million-square-foot facility. Last year, DHL Supply Chain said it was hiring hundreds of people to work at the distribution center.\nThis week, Boohoo announced it would cease supplying U.S. customers from its distribution center in Pennsylvania and will now fulfill all orders in the United States from its distribution center in the United Kingdom.\nThe people who will be laid off include two general managers, four operation managers, 16 operation supervisors, 23 group coordinators, 170 fulfillment specialists, 34 clerks, 14 operation support employees and five human resources employees.\nDHL Supply Chain provided the following statement to PennLive:\n“DHL Supply Chain was recently informed of a decision by one of our customers to restructure its distribution channels. As a result, the warehouse facility that supports [its] operations will ramp down operations through the end of the year. In the coming weeks, we will work with our associates to determine opportunities to continue their [careers] as valued team members of DHL Supply Chain.”\nThe Boohoo Group has 13 brands and says it sells clothing, shoes, accessories and beauty items to millions of customers across the globe. The company says its products target 16-40-year-old consumers in the United Kingdom and internationally.\nThe company’s Boohoo brand sells all types of clothing from dresses and jeans to suits and athleisure for women as well as shoes and accessories and beauty items. The brand also sells plus-sized items. The Boohoo Group also has a brand for men called BoohooMan.\nOfficials from Boohoo couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.\nStories by Daniel Urie Here’s why Penn State sold this building in Harrisburg after three decades of ownership Auction of Cumberland County camp and retreat center follows church’s 2-year-study 2 homeless shelters in Harrisburg to be open overnight all year long 5 vacant properties in Harrisburg to be transformed into affordable housing Large camp and retreat center in Cumberland County to be auctioned If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

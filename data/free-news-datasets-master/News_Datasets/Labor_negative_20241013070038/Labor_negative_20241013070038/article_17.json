    "text": "It would be “very dangerous and risky” for the federal Minister of Labour to impose binding arbitration in the dispute between Air Canada pilots and their employer, a lawyer believes.\n• Also read: Air Canada cancellations leave travellers in limbo\n• Also read: Possible strike at Air Canada: here are your options if your flight is cancelled\n“The minister has not yet announced that he intends to do so; it is the people at Air Canada who took the lead and sent a letter to the minister precisely with the aim of preparing,” explained Me Marc Boudreau, senior partner and founder of Marceau & Boudreau Avocats.\nSeveral members of the business community, such as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) and the Employers Council are to hold a press briefing at noon on this subject.\n“We are asking for action even before we exercise the right to strike or lockout,” said Me Boudreau in an interview with LCN on Thursday.\nAs was the case during the rail strike, some would like to see section 107 of the Canada Labour Code used. It states that “the Minister may take measures that he considers likely to promote good understanding in the world of work and to create conditions conducive to the settlement of disagreements or disputes that arise there.”\n“When the minister used this two weeks ago in the case of the strike in the train sector […] “People who know about this all say that it is an extremely dangerous precedent,” the lawyer stressed.\n“It was an exceptional situation, now we have reached the point where people at Air Canada are asking to use it as if it were an everyday means,” he lamented.\nHe hopes that Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon will not use binding arbitration, otherwise he “would become the employers’ puppet.”\nUnlike trains, a strike at Air Canada represents an inconvenience, but not a danger to the health and safety of the population, the specialist recalled.\n“Just because they earn big money doesn’t mean that their fundamental right to strike is diminished,” he said.\nWhat are the ⁢potential⁣ impacts of a strike by Air ⁤Canada pilots ‌on air travel and ‌the ⁤economy?

With ⁣a strike‌ looming, ⁣concerns are being raised about the potential consequences of imposing binding arbitration to resolve the dispute.\nAccording to‌ lawyer Marc⁣ Boudreau, senior partner and founder of Marceau & ⁢Boudreau Avocats, imposing binding‌ arbitration⁣ would be “very dangerous and risky”⁣ [[1]].

In fact, Air Canada has already⁣ begun canceling flights in anticipation of a potential strike, leaving travelers in limbo [[2]][[3]].\nSome ⁢members​ of the business community, including the‍ Canadian Chamber of Commerce, ‌the⁢ Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB),​ and ‍the Employers Council, are calling⁣ for action to prevent a strike [[1]]. They are pushing for the Minister of⁤ Labour to intervene, citing the potential⁢ economic consequences‍ of a prolonged ​strike.\nOne option being considered is the use of section 107 of the Canada Labour⁣ Code, which allows ⁤the Minister to ⁤take measures to promote good understanding and⁣ settle ⁤disputes [[1]]. This approach was‌ used recently in the case of a rail strike, but some argue that it sets a dangerous precedent.\nAs⁣ the situation continues to unfold, travelers are advised to monitor⁢ Air Canada’s website and social media channels for updates on flight schedules ⁢and cancellations [[2]]. Meanwhile,⁤ the airline and its ​pilots remain at an ‌impasse, with no ⁤clear ⁢end in sight to the ‍dispute.\nWith the clock ticking, ⁣the question on everyone’s mind is: ⁢what’s next for Air Canada and its passengers? Only⁣ time will tell if⁢ a resolution can be reached‍ before it’s too late.\nReferences:\n[[1]]\n[[2]]\n[[3]]\nNote: The article is‌ SEO-optimized with relevant keywords, ‍including ⁤”Air Canada”,⁣ “pilots’ strike”, ‍”binding arbitration”,​ and “labour dispute”.\nHere are some PAA (People Also Ask) related questions for the title: **Air Canada Pilots’ Strike Looms: Imposing Binding Arbitration could be “Very Dangerous and Risky”**: Air Canada Pilots’ Strike Looms: Imposing Binding Arbitration could be “Very Dangerous and Risky”\nThe Canadian aviation industry is bracing itself for a potential shutdown as Air Canada pilots and their employer remain deadlocked in negotiations.

With Air Canada being one of the largest airlines in Canada, a strike could lead to widespread flight cancellations and disruptions, causing inconvenience to thousands of passengers. The economic consequences of a prolonged strike could also be significant, with potential losses to businesses and industries that rely on",

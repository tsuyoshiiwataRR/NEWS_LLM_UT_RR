    "text": "Over 1,000 hotel workers and business owners rallied at City Hall, urging the City Council to reject Int. 991, a bill they say threatens NYC’s tourism industry and jobs.\nMore than a thousand hotel owners, employees, and small business operators, representing the newly formed Protect NYC Tourism Coalition, gathered on the steps of City Hall to oppose the City Council’s proposed “Safe Hotels” bill. The coalition urged the council to reject Int. 991, arguing that the legislation poses a serious threat to the stability of New York City’s tourism and hotel industries, putting thousands of jobs in jeopardy.\nThe Coalition consists of various prominent groups, including the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA), Hotel Association of New York City (HANYC), Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY), Asian American Hotel Owners Association (AAHOA), and the NYC Minority Hotel Association, among others. Collectively, these organizations play a critical role in supporting the city’s thriving tourism sector and have united to protect the industry from the potential fallout of the new legislation.\nInitially introduced by Councilwoman Julie Menin, Int. 991 has been framed by its advocates as a straightforward licensing measure. However, opponents argue it comes with a host of onerous and expensive mandates that could push numerous hotels out of business, ultimately leading to widespread job losses. The legislation places at risk not only 42,000 direct hotel jobs but also the nearly 260,000 jobs indirectly supported by the hospitality sector, along with billions in revenue for the city. Last year alone, tourism contributed $74 billion to the local economy, with $48 billion derived from direct spending.\nThe Protect NYC Tourism Coalition emphasized that safety is already a top priority within the industry. Member hotels adhere to rigorous safety protocols and are committed to combating human trafficking. The coalition noted that Int. 991 does not address hotel safety or human trafficking prevention, as these issues are already regulated under a law passed with the help of the hotel industry in 2022, mandating human trafficking awareness training for all employees.\nIn their ongoing efforts to safeguard the city’s tourism-driven economy, the coalition continues to advocate for policies that support, rather than hinder, the businesses and workers that form the backbone of New York’s hospitality industry. They argue that protecting jobs and revenue is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the city’s vibrant tourism ecosystem.",

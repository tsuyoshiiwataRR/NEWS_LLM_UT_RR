    "text": "Staff members at the Manitoba Teachers’ Society met the official launch of a third-party probe into the union’s embattled headquarters with outrage, tears and widespread skepticism this week. Richter Consulting has been hired to investigate workplace culture, harassment and morale issues raised by employees who are in charge of servicing more than 16,600 public school teachers. Glen Anderson, interim executive director, relayed the “workplace assessment” schedule, starting with a team of Montreal consultants who conducted in-person interviews between Sept. 10-12, during the first staff-wide meeting of the school year. Union leaders selected Richter to assess culture and climate on the Portage Avenue campus and review the organization’s structure after engaging with six consultants, Anderson said. The 9 a.m. meeting evolved into a two-hour event of emotional speeches and tense exchanges between employees and both their interim boss — the third individual to assume the union’s top non-partisan post in 10 months — and consultant Heidi Lange. “It’s been year after year after year of failed attempts to fix and so, I just feel completely hopeless. I have no hope and today has not helped at all,” one staffer said during the hybrid meeting, a recording of which was obtained by the Free Press. Another employee described the workforce, which she said is grappling with workload and cultural issues, as being in a collective state of mourning for an organization that has repeatedly proven to be dysfunctional. The 2021-22 handling of an equity audit, the 2023 pause of a strategic plan when workplace grievances were aired during consultations, and the brief tenure of MTS’ first human resources director were cited as reasons staff are skeptical of the latest initiative. This time last year, after receiving the damning results of a workplace survey conducted by Teamsters Local Union 979, MTS created an HR position to go beyond payroll duties and approach personnel and workplace issues from a broader perspective. Teamsters Canada represents roughly 80 people whose roles range from advocating for teachers who have classroom-related concerns to planning professional development sessions. Union spokesman Christopher Monette said Local 979 has filed 12 grievances in connection to what it calls “the reigning toxic work environment” in one of the largest public-sector unions in Manitoba. “(Richter’s) involvement has so far only worsened matters,” Monette wrote in an email Thursday. He noted a consultant referred to some employees as “coloureds” in the context of a discussion on race when speaking to staff about the firm’s proposal last month. “Our members are understandably frustrated and angry. The society has a legal obligation to provide a harassment-free workplace, and they are failing to meet that standard,” Monette added. On Tuesday, both Anderson and Lange apologized to employees for the latter’s comments on Aug. 20 and reaffirmed the partnership between MTS and Richter. “For me, it was lost in translation… My intention was not to hurt anybody or offend anybody. You have to know that for me, diversity, inclusion, equity are really important and values that I cherish a lot,” the francophone consultant said. Multiple employees expressed concern about the safety of a minority of MTS staff who identify as Indigenous, Black and people of colour in the review process and ensure their anonymity in a final report. Others criticized the organization’s elected board for not acting sooner to address employees’ concerns. There were several points during which the room erupted in applause in response to staff who vocalized frustrations. Anderson was accused of trying to silence employees around 10 a.m. when he suggested the group disperse to allow Richter’s team to begin interviewing. In a mass email to staff Wednesday, the interim leader — who is stern and, at times, audibly irritated in a recording — said managers felt it was important to acknowledge the prior day’s events were “difficult” for everyone involved. “As the meeting unfolded and emotions became more heightened, some staff conducted themselves in a disrespectful manner such as raising voices, interrupting, criticizing, and insulting co-workers,” Anderson wrote in the memo. Senior leaders will follow up to address such behaviour and ensure staff understand they are responsible for treating others with respect, “even when frustrated or upset,” he said. Teamsters is urging managers to listen, Monette said, adding: “We urge the society to stop viewing their staff as adversaries.” Lange, the main consultant, told the Free Press that employees’ distraught reactions on Tuesday demonstrated the importance of her consulting firm’s exercise. The project is ultimately a demonstration of the employer’s will to try to find a solution, she said. MTS president Nathan Martindale was not made available for an interview. Martindale and Cynthia Taylor, vice-president of the elected board responsible for governing the union, issued a joint statement on their commitment to working with Anderson to address staff concerns and needs. Richter does not have a hard deadline for its work. The consulting team is expected to submit a final report with recommendations to Martindale, Taylor and other members of the provincial executive.",

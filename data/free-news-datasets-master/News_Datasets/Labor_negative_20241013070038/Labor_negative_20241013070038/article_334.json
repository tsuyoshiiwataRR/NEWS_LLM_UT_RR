    "text": "Workers at the “Boeing” factory on the west coast of the United States will go on strike after 96 percent of employees voted to stop work.\nThis stops production in the company that sells the most airplanes in the world. “Boeing” is faced with production delays and growing debt.\nThe first labor strike since 2008 will begin at midnight Pacific time, just weeks after new CEO Keli Ortberg was installed in August to restore passenger confidence after a door panel fell off a near-new 737 MAX in January. summer.\nAbout 30,000 workers who make the 737 MAX and other planes in the Seattle and Portland areas voted for a new collective agreement after 16 years.\nAmong the members of the International Association of Machinists and Aviation Workers, 96 percent voted for the strike and 94.6 percent for rejecting the agreement with the company.\n“This is about respect, about dealing with the past and about fighting for our future,” said John Holden, who led the negotiations on behalf of the union, before announcing the results of the vote.\nBoeing has not yet responded to a request for comment.",

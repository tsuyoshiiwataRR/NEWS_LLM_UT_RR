    "text": "Over 30,000 Boeing workers, or about 20% of the company’s employees, are preparing to strike on Friday after rejecting a new labor contract.\nWorkers in Washington and Oregon voted against an agreement that Boeing and the labor union for machinists and aerospace workers proposed on Sunday. The vote was the first full contract vote in 16 years. It did not come out in Boeing’s favor: almost 95% voted to reject the contract and 96% voted in favor of striking.\nUnder rules set by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the labor union for Boeing employees, at least two-thirds of unionized workers have to vote in favor for a strike to begin or a contract to be rejected.\n“IAM members from across North America stand in solidarity with our members in the Pacific Northwest and California,” the union said in a statement released Thursday. “Our goal is to get a strong contract that meets the needs of our members.”\nOn Thursday, dozens of employees marched to a union hall near Boeing’s 737 Max plant in Renton, Washington, blowing whistles, banging drums, and holding up signs calling for a strike.\nThe strike would pause most of the American aircraft maker’s production, a headache for the company grappling with safety and reputation concerns after taking several hits this year. It is also a big blow to its new CEO Kelly Ortberg, who stepped into the role about six weeks ago.\nA day before the vote, Ortberg urged workers to accept the contract and not to strike, saying that it would jeopardize the company’s recovery .\nAccording to an estimate from TD Cowen, a 50-day strike could cost Boeing an estimated $3 billion to $3.5 billion. The last strike, in 2008, shuttered plants for 52 days and hit revenue by an estimated $100 million per day, Reuters reported .\nThe rejected contract would have increased workers’ general wages by 25% over the length of the four-year contract. Boeing would also build its next commercial plane in the Seattle area, as long as the program is initiated within four years of the contract. The tentative labor contract, which included a pay increase over four years, was touted as another win for the beleaguered company.\nThe proposal left workers unsatisfied, Jon Holden, president of the IAM’s district 751 and lead negotiator on the Boeing contract, told Reuters on Monday.\n“They’re angry,” Holden told Reuters. “It’s hard to come off of 10 years when you lost so many things that were critical.”\nSome union members had been pushing for a much higher wage hike— up to 40% — and the return of the company’s pension plan, which it discontinued a decade ago, Holden said.\nBoeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe post Over 30,000 Boeing workers are preparing to strike after rejecting a new labor contract appeared first on Business Insider .",

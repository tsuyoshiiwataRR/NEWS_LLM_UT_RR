    "text": "In a statement, the “ [Aterra](https://aterra.info/)” movement, against the expansion of [Humberto Delgado airport](https://www.lisbonairport.pt/en/lis/home), explained that 123 organizations from “all over the world have come together to declare September 13 as the International Day for the Prohibition of Night Flights at Airports”. “The current operation of Humberto Delgado airport violates the [WHO](https://www.who.int/) [World Health Organization] guidelines on environmental noise and Portuguese legislation itself, exposing more than 100,000 people to noise levels above the legal limit”, highlighted the activist of the “Aterra” movement Hans Eickhoff, quoted in the statement. According to the doctor, noise levels above the legal limit “not only harm the quality of sleep, but also significantly increase the risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular causes, and affect the cognitive and learning abilities of children and young people”. The movement indicated that several European cities, such as Lisbon, Frankfurt, Brussels, Luxembourg, Barcelona, Marseille, and London, have witnessed an increase in air traffic and a deterioration in health and quality of life. “On this 13th, the populations say enough is enough to the impunity with which the aviation sector continues to increase flights and seek profits at the expense of the health of people and the planet”, stressed “Aterra”, which brings together more than 20 Portuguese organizations that defend the decline of aviation and fair and ecological mobility. Defending the ban on flights at Humberto Delgado airport between 11:00 pm and 7:00 am, except for possible delays and emergency landings, the movement recalled that the [Zero](https://zero.ong/) association counted, during the last two weeks of August alone, more than a thousand flights at that time, “not counting cargo flights, charters or private jets”. “In a city with a current capacity for 36 air movements per hour, which is already completely unsustainable, the Government and [ANA Aeroportos](https://www.ana.pt/pt) insist on increasing air traffic to 48 movements per hour”, it lamented. “Aterra” also expressed solidarity with “all the people who […] see their health threatened daily by airport traffic”, opposing “any project to expand airport capacity in Lisbon, whether by expanding the current airport or by building a new airport”. “We propose a reduction in the number of flights permitted in Lisbon and the establishment of limits on air traffic at all national airports, in order to respect the well-being and lives of current and future populations,” he added.",

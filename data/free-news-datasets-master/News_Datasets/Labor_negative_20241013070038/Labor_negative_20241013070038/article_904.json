    "text": "30,000 Boeing Workers Go On Strike; First Since 2008 Summary from the AllSides News Team Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers rejected a deal between Boeing and the union on Thursday, and 96% voted in favor of a strike. The Deal: The offer would have increased wages by 25%, reduced employee contribution to health care costs, and ensured that Boeing's next plane model would be constructed at union plants in Washington state. Employees [said](https://www.allsides.com/news/2024-09-13-0750/economy-and-jobs-boeing-workers-vote-overwhelmingly-strike-defeat-troubled) they wanted a larger pay increase and did not want their annual bonus program cut. Early Friday, the company said it would return to the bargaining table. The Effect: Boeing's [stock has fallen](https://www.allsides.com/news/2024-09-13-0816/business-boeing-s-stock-drops-workers-strike-and-history-suggests-it-could-get) near a two-year low. In 2008, its stock fell until a deal was reached. The strike [could lower U.S. GDP growth](https://www.allsides.com/news/2024-09-13-0820/business-33000-boeing-union-workers-go-strike-first-major-walkout-2008), as Boeing is the nation's largest exporter. It could also cause serious issues for the nearly 10,000 Boeing suppliers across the country. The strike will cost Boeing an [estimated $1.5 billion](https://www.allsides.com/news/2024-09-13-0823/business-boeing-workers-are-set-strike-and-it-could-cost-company-billions) every 30 days and halt production of its 737 Max jet. How the Media Covered It: Sources on the left were more likely to include the 96% who voted in favor of a strike in the headline, emphasizing the unanimity of the decision. Outlets on the right were more likely to mention in their headlines that the workers rejected a 25% pay increase. Featured Coverage of this Story From the Right [Fresh Boeing crisis as 30,000 workers prepare to strike after rejecting 25% pay rise](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13846207/Fresh-Boeing-crisis-workers-prepare-strike.html) [Daily Mail See rating details ](/news-source/daily-mail) Boeing is facing a fresh crisis as 30,000 workers prepare to walk out after unanimously rejecting a 25 per cent pay rise. The strike at Boeing's West Coast factory will halt production of the planemaker's strongest-selling jet as it wrestles with chronic output delays and mounting debt. It comes after a series of shocking incidents involving the company's planes which have caused widespread uncertainty among the general public. From the Center [More than 30,000 Boeing workers to strike after turning down contract proposal](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/09/13/Boeing-union-strike/5581726224661/) [United Press International See rating details ](/news-source/united-press-international-media-bias) More than 30,000 Boeing workers will go on strike starting Friday after turning down a tentative contract proposal hammered out by the company and union negotiators. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers voted 94.6% to reject the agreement, while 96% voted in favor of a strike. From the Left [Boeing workers vote overwhelmingly to strike, in defeat for troubled company](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/13/boeing-union-contract-strike/) [Washington Post See rating details ](/news-source/washington-post-media-bias) Boeing workers picketed outside the company’s plants in Washington state early Friday morning after voting overwhelmingly to strike. Tens of thousands of machinists voted Thursday to reject a proposed deal between the company and the union that would have significantly boosted pay and benefits even as it fell short of other union demands.

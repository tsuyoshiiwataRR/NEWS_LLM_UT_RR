    "text": "Landing a job at a FAANG company (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) is a dream for many in tech. However, as more employees share their experiences, the glittering facade of these tech giants is starting to crack. Recently, an Amazon employee placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) took to social media to reveal their relief and newfound resolve to steer clear of any FAANG company in the future.\nThe Amazon employee recently shared their experience on social media after being placed on a PIP. They expressed relief at leaving the company with a tier-1 severance package, which amounts to 3.5 months of base pay.\nGot Piped from amazon , Yay - No more free bananas\nby u/DragZealousideal8287 in developersIndia\nIn their post, they candidly mentioned their decision to avoid FAANG companies in the future, opting instead for mid-sized, stable firms in less glamorous industries that offer more manageable workloads, even if the pay is only 40-50% of what FAANGs provide.\n\"I don't need money at the expense of my health deteriorating everyday,\" they noted.\nHow did people respond? This sparked a debate on how FAANG companies offer no work-life balance.\nOne person questioned why so many Amazon employees seem to be burnt out, leading to a flood of responses.\nAn employee shared their struggle, recounting a period of intense work: \"I was also doing excellent my first 2 years with close to promo. even after working 70 hrs per week - I was positive and excited. Last 6 months were disaster - reorgs, manager change, project shutdown, promo delayed - new manager too toxic and i am became scapegoat as newcomer is.\"\nCredit: Pixabay | Representational image\n\"Three years at Amazon is an achievement in itself,\" remarked another, highlighting the company's notorious work culture.\nSome suggested alternative options, with one commenter advocating for BISCO (Baidu, IBM, SAP, Cisco, Oracle) as preferable to the FAANG giants, citing better pay and a less stressful environment.\nThe debate underscores a growing sentiment that the high-stakes, high-pressure culture at the much sought-after FAANG companies might not be worth the toll on personal well-being.\nTo stay updated on the stories that are going viral, follow Indiatimes Trending .",

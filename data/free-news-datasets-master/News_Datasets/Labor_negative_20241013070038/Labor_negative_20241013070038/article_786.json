    "text": "Health workers of the Sarajevo Canton, due to the failure to reach an agreement with the Cantonal Government on salary increases, have announced a one-hour blockade of the Skenderija road from all directions for today from 12:00 to 13:00. However, they did not receive approval to change the traffic regime.\nThe President of the KS Health Workers’ Union, Senad Sadiković, pointed out that they did not give up blocking the main road, but that they received a response from the Ministry of Transport that they could not block it due to ongoing works.\n“We have decided to withdraw in front of the Canton Government, where our colleagues are staying in tents and where we will stay until the Canton Government offers us an acceptable hourly rate,” said Sadiković.\nHe announced that he will continue with the protests until their demands are met.\n“We are announcing for next week, on Thursday, a protest walk from the Eternal Flame to the Canton Government, where we will protest again. As soon as the conditions for a general strike are met, after the reconciliation that needs to be carried out, we will go on a general strike,” he said, adding that the conciliation process lasts 30 days.\nLet us remind you that the basic demand that healthcare workers are asking for is an increase in their hourly wages. The union submitted a request for the net hourly rate to be 3.70, while the Government offered 3.25. The union says that the offer is unacceptable.\nphoto: archive",

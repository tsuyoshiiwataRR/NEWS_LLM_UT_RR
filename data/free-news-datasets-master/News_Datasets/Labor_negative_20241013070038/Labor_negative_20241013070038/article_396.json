    "text": "The strike began at midnight local time, marking a major disruption for the aircraft manufacturing giant. Workers at Boeing represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) have embarked on strike following an overwhelming vote to reject a proposed contract. The strike began at midnight local time, marking a major disruption for the aircraft manufacturing giant. On Thursday night, IAM District 751 announced that its members had voted 94.6% against the contract offer, which included a 25% pay increase over four years. Additionally, 96% of the union members supported the strike action, CBS reports. With a required two-thirds majority needed among the 33,000 workers, predominantly based in the Seattle area, the strike vote signifies a clear mandate for action. “This is about respect, this is about the past, and this is about fighting for our future,” said Jon Holden, IAM District 751 President, as he addressed the enthusiastic crowd at the union hall, which erupted in chants of “Strike! Strike! Strike!” Boeing, which has been grappling with a tarnished reputation and financial challenges, responded by expressing its readiness to return to negotiations. “The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members,” the company stated. “We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union.” CBS reports that on the night of September 13, 2024, union members at a Seattle hall erupted in cheers following the announcement of vote results on a potential strike and a proposed contract. Boeing's year has been marked by challenges, including a panel failure that left a significant hole in one of its passenger jets in January and NASA's decision to keep two astronauts in space rather than return them on a malfunctioning Boeing spacecraft. A potential strike could further strain Boeing’s finances, depriving the company of crucial revenue from new plane deliveries. This presents a significant challenge for new CEO Kelly Ortberg, who assumed the role six weeks ago with the task of reversing a $25 billion loss over the past six years and catching up to European competitor Airbus. Ortberg cautioned that a strike could jeopardize Boeing's recovery efforts and diminish customer trust. He made a final appeal to machinists, stating that a strike would harm the company's progress and erode trust with its clients. Union members, dissatisfied with the proposed contract, have voiced their concerns on social media throughout the week. Meanwhile, on Thursday, they demonstrated their discontent by blowing whistles, banging drums, and holding signs advocating for a strike outside a union hall near Boeing’s 737 Max plant in Renton, Washington.

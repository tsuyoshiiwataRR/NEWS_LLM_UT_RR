    "text": "TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – A union at the Taiwan Railway Corporation (TRC) is mulling a strike vote to protest special holiday bonuses being paid out in vouchers instead of cash, reports said Friday (Sept. 13). Transportation Minister Chen Shih-kai (陳世凱) said he had entrusted senior TRC officials to sit down and discuss the matter with personnel, per [Radio Taiwan International](https://www.rti.org.tw/news/view/id/2220114). On Friday, he toured major transportation hubs to inspect preparations for next Tuesday’s Mid-Autumn Festival. The minister and TRC praised the readiness of railway employees to work night and day, during major holidays, weekends, and weekdays. The authorities had decided to distribute NT$1,500 (US$47) worth of vouchers per employee for the Tomb Sweeping, Lantern, and Mid-Autumn festivals, per [CNA](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/ahel/202409130028.aspx). TRC decided to start the practice for the Sept. 17 Mid-Autumn Festival, while new employees will have to wait until the company passes measures about performance bonuses. Management will investigate whether it is possible to expand the voucher bonus measures to include cash while trying to reach a consensus with the union, TRC said.",

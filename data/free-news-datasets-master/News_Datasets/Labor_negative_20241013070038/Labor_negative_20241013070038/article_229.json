Union leader Jon Holden said earlier this week he expected rank-and-file members to reject the contract and strike.\nOf the voting members, 95% voted to reject the contract and 96% voted to strike; the union had to have a two-thirds majority vote to strike.\nhttps://www.seattletimes.com/busines...act-or-strike/ It appears the offer was as follows:\n* 11% immediate pay increase\n* 4% annual wage increases in 2025 and 2026; 6% in 2027\n* $3,000 ratification bonus\n* Small decrease in monthly health care premiums\nDetails of rejected package below.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BGnYTuZ.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/p3M106R.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/cEOwSoK.jpeg",

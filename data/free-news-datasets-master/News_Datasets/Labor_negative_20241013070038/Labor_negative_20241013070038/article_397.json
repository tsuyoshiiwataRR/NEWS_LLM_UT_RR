    "text": "Boeing Workers Strike After Rejecting Contract Boeing aircraft assembly workers went on strike early Friday after union members rejected a proposed contract that would have increased wages by 25% over four years. The walkout involves 33,000 machinists in Washington state, affecting production of bestselling airplane models and marking another setback for Boeing. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Seattle | Updated: 13-09-2024 13:39 IST | Created: 13-09-2024 13:39 IST - Country: - United States In a major labor move, Boeing's aircraft assembly workers launched a strike early Friday, walking off the job at Boeing factories in the Seattle area. This action follows an overwhelming majority union vote rejecting a tentative contract offering a 25% wage hike over four years. The strike began at 12:01 a.m. PDT, shortly after the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers announced that 94.6% of voting members had rejected the proposed contract, with 96% voting to strike. The labor action includes 33,000 Boeing machinists, primarily based in Washington state, and is expected to halt production of Boeing's top-selling airline planes. While the strike is not expected to disrupt commercial flights, it represents another significant challenge for Boeing, already grappling with manufacturing issues and multiple federal investigations. Boeing responded, expressing readiness to return to negotiations to achieve a new agreement, emphasizing their commitment to improving relations with their employees and the union.

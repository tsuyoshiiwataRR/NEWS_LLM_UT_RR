After the announcement of the 10% cut in India’s workforce a Reuters report showed that the South Korean company plans to fire more employees in subsidiaries in different locations such as:\nAmerica Europa Asia Africa Overall, the company is expected to lay off up to 15 percent of its marketing staff at its branches, while its administrative staff is expected to be reduced by up to 30 percent. The cuts are expected to be made by the end of this year, but it appears the company is unlikely to make such a move in its home country of South Korea.\nAccording to reports, the “global mandate” for the layoffs was issued three weeks ago. Samsung, for its part, went so far as to say that these changes are aimed at improving efficiency and classified them as “routine.” The production team, for its part, is not expected to undergo any staff cuts.\nRecent reports suggest that the South Korean company is going through a tough phase due to declining consumer demand. The company’s workforce reduction efforts may be related to this, as well as increased competition in the smartphone space and the recovery of the company’s chip business from a sharp slowdown.\n1726193329\n#Layoffs #sight #Samsung #cut #employees #divisions #world\n**PAA Related Questions for the ​Title: Samsung Announces Global Job Cuts of Up to 30% Amidst Restructuring Efforts** Table of Contents\n1 **PAA Related Questions for the ​Title: Samsung Announces Global Job Cuts of Up to 30% Amidst Restructuring Efforts** 2 Here are some People Also Ask (PAA) questions related to the title “Samsung Announces Global Job Cuts of Up to 30% Amidst Restructuring Efforts”: Samsung Announces Global Job Cuts of ⁣Up to 30% Amidst Restructuring⁣ Efforts\nIn‍ a move that⁢ is sending shockwaves across the globe, Samsung Electronics has announced plans to cut jobs by‌ up to 30% in some divisions, affecting sales, marketing,⁣ and administrative staff across various regions, including America, Europe, Asia, ⁤and Africa [[1]][[2]].

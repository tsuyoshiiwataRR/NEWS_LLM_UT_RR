Statement from CWA Following Layoffs at Microsoft Gaming Microsoft’s decision to lay off 650 video game workers is an extremely disappointing move from one of the world’s largest and most profitable corporations. This news comes just after Sony Interactive Entertainment subsidiary Bungie announced 220 layoffs in late July. While none of those who are losing their jobs are represented by CWA, we understand how devastating layoffs are to the workers and their families. “Every worker deserves a voice on the job and a say over the impact of job cuts,” said Samuel Cooper, Senior Producer at World of Warcraft and member of WoWGG-CWA. “While we would hope that a company like Microsoft with $88 billion in profits last year could achieve ‘long-term success’ without destroying the livelihoods of 650 of our colleagues, heartless layoffs like these have become all too common. We stand in solidarity with everyone who lost their job today and encourage all video game workers to join with us and form unions so we can protect each other.” While union representation does not always protect against layoffs, collective bargaining does give workers a voice in the policies that affect them, including how layoffs are handled. Former Sony Computer Entertainment Europe President Chris Deering’s [callous suggestion earlier this week](https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-playstation-chief-criticized-for-saying-laid-off-developers-should-drive-an-uber-or-go-to-the-beach-for-a-year) that laid-off game workers should “go to the beach for a year” shows how insulated many executives are from the impact of their decisions on their workers. Amid the constant threat of layoffs in the tech and video game industries, organizing momentum continues to surge. Over 6,000 tech and video game workers have organized to join CWA, and we remain committed to supporting workers at Microsoft and throughout the tech and video game industry who seek to form a union and improve their workplace. ### About CWA: The Communications Workers of America represents working people in telecommunications, customer service, media, airlines, health care, public service and education, manufacturing, tech, and other fields.",

    "text": "More than 30,000 Boeing aircraft construction workers are to go on strike from today (Friday). The mass walkout by union members who produce models such as the 737 Max and 777 in Seattle and Portland was signalled as they rejected a deal that included at 25% pay rise. Machinists voted overwhelmingly by almost 95% to reject the contract offer and by 96% in favour of strike action. The strike was due to start at midnight local US Pacific Time with picket lines to be deployed at designated factory locations. The International Association of Machinist (IAM) union authorised the first strike at Boeing in 16 years. The walkout came as workers rejected a new four-year contract for workers, described by the union as including “substantial raises” including a 25% increase over the life of the deal. IAM said prior to the contract rejection: “Financially, the company finds itself in a tough position due to many self-inflicted missteps. “It is IAM members who will bring this company back on track. As has been said many times, there is no Boeing without the IAM. “Ultimately, we love this company and couldn’t be more proud of the jobs we do or the products we build. What we do defines who we are – these crafts are our livelihoods. When a plane leaves the factory, it’s our reputation on the line. This proposal helps keep our legacy alive.” However, Jon Holden, president of the largest IAM local at Boeing, said after the ballot result: “This is about fighting for our future. “We will be back at the table whenever we can get there to drive forward on the issues our members say are important.” Boeing’s new chief executive Kelly Ortberg had acknowledged in a letter to employees earlier this week that members had been upset over past contract terms, but he urged union members to move past that and vote for the deal. Boeing has yet to comment on the strike declaration.",

    "text": "Chief minister says urgent turnaround plan is required The chief minister has told Manx Radio it is ‘completely unsustainable’ for Manx Care to keep overspending its budget. The health body is forecasting a £16.8 million overspend for this financial year. You can find out more [here](https://www.manxradio.com/news/isle-of-man-news/manx-cares-forecast-overspend-down-to-16-8-million/). The predicted deficit comes despite people’s taxes being raised to contribute to healthcare services as part of this year's Budget. The higher rate of personal Income Tax [rose from 20 percent to 22 percent](https://www.manxradio.com/news/isle-of-man-news/additional-income-tax-to-be-ringfenced-for-healthcare/) in April in a move that was due to generate £20 million for government coffers. Alfred Cannan says a turnaround plan for Manx Care needs to be put into place ‘almost immediately’ and is planning to unveil what that will look like at next week’s [Isle of Man Government Conference](https://www.manxradio.com/news/isle-of-man-news/is-government-conference-detached-from-reality/). That will take place at The Comis Hotel on 17 and 18 September. Mr Cannan says it’s a ‘very, very concerning' situation: You can hear more from the chief minister on this topic in Perspective with Phil Gawne on Sunday (15 September).",

    "text": "Xbox brings total layoffs to 2.5k following $69billion Call of Duty buyout\nXBOX has announced that another 650 people will lose their jobs following its $69billion purchase of publisher Activision Blizzard.\nThe Call of Duty publisher is one of the largest companies in the industry, and also owns blockbuster series such as World of Warcraft, Diablo, and Candy Crush.\nHowever, the purchase has not been smooth for a large number of employees that are now under Xbox.\nThis round of layoffs follows the 1.9k job losses that followed the purchase early this year.\nMicrosoft gaming chief Phil Spencer circulated an internal email announcing that a further 650 people would be laid off in the games division.\nGame File gained access to the email that Spencer sent employees informing them of the layoffs.\nMore in Xbox\nIn the last round of layoffs, top executives like Blizzard president Mike Ybarra left the company, but Spencer confirms that this round is focused on corporate and support roles.\nHe does emphasise that “no games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed” this time.\nWe know that in the previous wave of layoffs, at least one project at Blizzard was cancelled and four studios and their projects were shut down.\nA few months ago, Microsoft increased the Xbox Game Pass prices to bring in more revenue, but the changes hadn’t even been implemented fully before the job losses were announced.\nMost read in Gaming\nIn the email Spencer says: “For the past year, our goal has been to minimise disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work.\n“As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming—mostly corporate and supporting functions—to organise our business for long term success.\n“I know that this is difficult news to hear. We are deeply grateful for the contributions of our colleagues who are learning they are impacted\n“Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games.\n“No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.\n“I know that going through more changes like this is hard, but even in the most trying times, this team has been able to come together and show one another care and kindness as we work to continue delivering for our players.\n“We appreciate your support as we navigate these changes and we thank you for your compassion and respect for each other.”\nIf you want to read more about Xbox, check out how\nTony Hawk teased a new Pro Skater game.\nAll the latest Xbox reviews from The Sun\nGet the lowdown on more of the latest Xbox releases from our expert reviewers.\nSouth Park: Snow Day Berserk Boy Eiyuden Chronicle Skull and Bones Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons Expeditions: A MudRunner Game WWE 2K24 Alone in the Dark Dragon’s Dogma 2 Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden\nFor PS5 and Nintendo Switch, check out our full game reviews section.",

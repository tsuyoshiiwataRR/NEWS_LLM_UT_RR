    "text": "Air Canada is warning that some operations could start being affected Friday as a potential strike by the air carrier’s pilots could begin on Sunday.\nThe airline says that operations like cargo and vacation packages could be affected as negotiations between Air Canada and the union representing 5,200 pilots have stalled.\nAir Canada has called for the government to be ready to intervene, to avoid major disruptions that would affect more than 110,000 travellers a day.\nNegotiations between the airline and the Air Line Pilots Association have been ongoing for 15 months, with the airline saying that the union is “being inflexible and corporate greed is keeping the pilots from getting what they are due.”\nThe union voted in August with a 98 per cent of the workers voting in favour of job action to achieve a new contract with the airline.\n“We are still not seeing the significant movement that we need to see from Air Canada, especially now that time is of the essence, and we are ready to go on strike if necessary,” reads a statement made on the union’s blog in August by First Officer Charlene Hudy.\nREAD MORE:\nAir Canada pilots union in position to strike as early as next week",

    "text": "A week after terminating the contract of its longtime CEO and president, Thundermist Health Center on Thursday laid off 124 workers, slashed salaries for all staff, and eliminated provider cross coverage and employee cell phone stipends as part of an effort to address the nonprofit’s financial crisis.\nAn email sent to top staff and board members explained that the cuts were necessary for the community health center , which serves more than 60,000 at its locations in West Warwick, Woonsocket, and South County, to make payroll.\nRelated : As the private-equity-firm owners look to sell, the future of two safety-net hospitals in R.I. is at stake ”We are very sorry to take the steps we are enacting today to reduce our payroll costs,” the email states. “If we don’t impose these measures, we will be unable to make payroll through the next month. With these actions, we will be able to buy the time we need to get plans in motion that will give us a fighting chance to balance our budget.”\nAdvertisement\nThe layoffs mean Thundermist is cutting nearly 14 percent of its staff.\nLast week, the organization terminated the contract of Jeanne LaChance, who had been president and CEO of the organization for 10 years.\nThe board of directors released a statement saying Thundermist was facing a “financial crisis” as a result of revenue decreases from the federal 340B drug rebate program and its Medicaid accountable entity.\nRelated : Why is Lifespan buying hospitals in Massachusetts instead of saving two in Rhode Island? “The board’s decision comes amid a financial crisis at our organization,” the board said in a statement on Sept. 6. “There are numerous challenges that have led to the current situation, including reductions in revenue from the federal 340B drug rebate program, which was a loss of $7 million in the last fiscal year. We have also experienced a decrease in revenues generated from our Medicaid accountable entity, totaling $8.5 million. There are additional challenges created by delays in provider credentialing and the cost of doing business and providing care to meet growing demand post-pandemic.”\nThundermist served more than 60,000 unique patients at its locations in West Warwick, Woonsocket, and South County in 2023, up from 49,000 in 2020, according to its annual report. The organization brought in $121 million in revenue and reported $118 million in expenses, according to its most recent tax filings.\nAdvertisement",

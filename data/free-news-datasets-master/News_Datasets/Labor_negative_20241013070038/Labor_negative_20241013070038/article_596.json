    "text": "Workers at US aircraft manufacturer Boeing have gone on strike after rejecting a deal between union representatives and the company over a pay rise.\nAbout 33,000 machinists have today downed their tools at two plants in the state of Washington – Renton and Everett – as the local branch of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers announced a near-unanimous decision by workers to strike.\nThe contract agreed in 2008 and renewed in 2014 expired on Thursday night (12 September).\nAlmost 95% of voting workers rejected the proposed contract and 96% approved the work stoppage, easily surpassing a two-thirds requirement.\nThose on strike assemble the 737 Max, Boeing’s best-selling airliner, along with the 777 and the 767 cargo plane. The walkout likely will not stop production of Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which are built by non-union workers in South Carolina.\nUSA news\nHR must not let bigots win as the DEI backlash continues Bank accused of ‘faking’ interviews for diversity hires\nThe workers have rejected a contract that the embattled aviation giant characterised as win for employees given the company’s parlous financial position stemming chiefly from safety issues with the 737 Max, which contributed to two fatal crashes and a series of incidents that have caused injuries to those on board.\nBy striking, the employees have rejected a deal that would have increased wages by 25% over four years.\nJon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751, said: “Our members spoke loud and clear tonight.”\nBoeing said in a statement: “The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members.\n“We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.”\nEarlier this week, union representatives advised members to support the proposed deal.\nIn addition to a 25% pay rise, the preliminary agreement rejected by workers included a commitment from Boeing to build its next commercial plane in the Seattle area if the project started during the lifetime of the contract.\nThe union initially targeted a number of improvements to workers’ packages, including a 40% pay rise.\nThe aerospace giant’s new chief executive Kelly Ortberg had told workers before the strike that any industrial action would put the company’s “recovery in jeopardy”.\nSign up to our weekly round-up of HR news and guidance\nReceive the Personnel Today Direct e-newsletter every Wednesday\nLatest HR job opportunities on Personnel Today\nBrowse more human resources jobs",

    "text": "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) has issued a statement on Microsoft’s latest round of layoffs that sees another 650 people let go from the company.\nThe CWA, which admittedly doesn’t represent anyone laid off in the latest layoffs, still represents workers within Microsoft, such as developers on World of Warcraft within Blizzard. They say they are disappointed to see more layoffs from “one of the world’s largest and most profitable corporations”.\n“Every worker deserves a voice on the job and a say over the impact of job cuts,” Samuel Cooper, Senior Producer at World of Warcraft and member of WoWGG-CWA, said via the statement. “While we would hope that a company like Microsoft with $88 billion in profits last year could achieve ‘long term success’ without destroying the livelihoods of 650 of our colleagues, heartless layoffs like these have become all too common.\n“We stand in solidarity with everyone who lost their job today and encourage all video game workers to join with us and form unions so we can protect each other.”\nWhile unions can’t fully prevent layoffs, the CWA says that they do help employees when it comes to how the layoffs are handled in general.\nThe CWA added that it remains “committed to supporting workers at Microsoft and throughout the tech and video game industry who seek to form a union and improve their workplace.”\nWhat do you think of the layoffs at Microsoft and the CWA’s statement?

They added that they’ve been negotiating with the hotel since November. Their contract expired at the end of March.\nThe workers included housekeepers, bartenders, servers, and chefs represented by Local 217, the Unite Here union.\nOn Thursday, they began striking, carrying signs, and chanting.\nThey said they felt overworked, underpaid, and exhausted after months of slow-moving negotiations.\n“We’re just looking for a way for people to get back on their feet,” said Josh Stanley, secretary treasurer, Local 217 Unite Here. “We’re talking about fair wages stable retirement and healthcare.”\nOmni Hotels and Resorts said this was not its first time dealing with something like this.\nIn response to the strike, it said in part:\n“Unfortunately, as has recently occurred in other markets, the union has determined that a strike is in its interest. In view of this labor action, the hotel has put in place plans to ensure services are not interrupted and that our guests will continue to experience the genuine hospitality, personalized service, and elevated experiences that are the hallmark of the Omni New Haven Hotel.”",

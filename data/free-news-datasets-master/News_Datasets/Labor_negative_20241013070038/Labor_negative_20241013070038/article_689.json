    "text": "More than 30,000 Boeing workers, members of the company’s biggest unionized group, walked off the job early Friday after staff rejected a new labor contract and approved a strike with a 96% vote. The work stoppage halts production of most of the company’s aircraft, including its bestselling 737 Max. The strike is another costly blow Boeing, which is trying to increase output and improve its reputation. Boeing ‘s factory workers walked off the job after midnight on Friday, halting production of the company’s bestselling airplanes after staff overwhelmingly rejected a new labor contract.\nIt’s a costly development for the manufacturer, which has struggled to ramp up production and restore its reputation following safety crises.\nWorkers in the Seattle area and in Oregon voted 94.6% against a tentative agreement that Boeing and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers unveiled Sunday. The workers voted 96% in favor of a strike, far more than the two-thirds vote required for a work stoppage.\n“We strike at midnight,” said IAM District 751 President Jon Holden at a news conference where he announced the vote’s results. He characterized it as an “unfair labor practice strike,” alleging that factory workers had experienced “discriminatory conduct, coercive questioning, unlawful surveillance and we had unlawful promise of benefits.”\nDavid Ryder | Reuters A worker holds a sign opposing the proposed contract as Boeing factory workers wait in line to vote on their first full contract in 16 years, at an International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 union hall, in Renton, Washington, U.S. September 12, 2024. He said Boeing needs to bargain in good faith. Boeing didn’t comment on his claims.\n“The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members,” the company said in a statement. “We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.”\nStephanie Pope, CEO of Boeing’s commercial airplane unit, told machinists earlier this week that the tentative deal was the “best contract we’ve ever presented.”\n“In past negotiations, the thinking was we should hold something back so we can ratify the contract on a second vote,” she said Tuesday. “We talked about that strategy this time, but we deliberately chose a new path.”\nThe tentative proposal included 25% wage increases and other improvements to health-care and retirement benefits, though the union had sought raises of about 40%. Workers had complained about the agreement, saying it didn’t cover the increased cost of living.\nThe vote is a blow to CEO Kelly Ortberg , who has been in the top job for five weeks. A day before the vote, he had urged workers to accept the contract and not to strike, saying that it would jeopardize the company’s recovery.\nHow fixing airplane engines became a $58 billion business Low-cost airlines are turning away airplanes to cut costs Southwest shakes up board, chairman to step down next year amid activist pressure Under the tentative agreement, Boeing had promised to build its next commercial jet in the Seattle area, a bid to win over workers after the company moved the 787 Dreamliner production to a nonunion factory in South Carolina.\nThe agreement, if approved, would have been the first fully negotiated contract for Boeing machinists in 16 years. Boeing workers went on strike in 2008 for nearly two months.\nThe ultimate financial impact of this strike will depend on how long it lasts.\nJefferies aerospace analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu estimated a 30-day cash impact from a strike could be a $1.5 billion hit for Boeing and said it “could destabilize suppliers and supply chains.” She forecast the tentative agreement would have had an annual impact of $900 million if passed.\nM.

Boeing has burned through about $8 billion so far this year and has mounting debt. Production has fallen short of expectations as the company works to stamp out manufacturing flaws and faces other industrywide problems such as supply and labor shortages.\nAircraft delivery delays from Boeing have vexed its airline customers. In response, they said they have had to redraw their hiring and growth plans. Southwest Airlines has already sharply reduced its delivery expectations from Boeing for the year.\n“As a result, we currently have the fleet needed to fulfill our upcoming schedules,” a spokesman said Friday. The airline’s leaders were in touch with Boeing ahead of the vote.\nM.

A door plug blowout on a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 at the start of the year has brought additional federal scrutiny of Boeing’s production lines.\n“Our aggressive oversight of Boeing continues,” the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement on Friday.\nMoney market funds hit another record high — but experts warn it’s time to move out of cash.

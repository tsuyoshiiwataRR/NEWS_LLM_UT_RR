    "text": "More than 30 Boeing workers are set to go on strike Friday evening, halting production of most of the company's planes, after staff overwhelmingly rejected a new labor contract proposal. Labor market experts see the strike as a costly development for the company as it struggles to increase production and restore its reputation following ongoing safety crises in its aircraft manufacturing. Workers in the Seattle area and Oregon voted 96 percent to strike against a tentative deal proposed by Boeing and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers on Sunday, far more than the two-thirds vote needed for a work stoppage. “We are going on strike at midnight,” Jon Holden, president of Boeing’s organized union, The IAM Union District 751, said at a news conference announcing the results of the vote. Holden called it an “unfair labor practice strike,” claiming that factory workers were subjected to “discriminatory treatment, coercive interrogation, illegal surveillance and illegal promises of benefits,” and said Boeing must bargain in good faith. Boeing has not yet made a statement on the issue.",

    "text": "The unionized group of Roaring Fork Transportation Authority bus operators filed an intent to strike with the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment after reaching an impasse in contract negotiations with RFTA. The Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1774 filed the intent to strike with the state on Tuesday, citing a refusal from RFTA to accept its proposals on a wage increase, housing stipend proposal and more. A strike would only occur if CDLE approves it and if a collective bargaining agreement is not reached by Dec. 31, when the current agreement is set to expire. If the strike is approved and negotiations are not completed, the union plans to strike in the new year, ATU Local 1774 President Ed Cortez told the Aspen Daily News. “This round of negotiations started in May, and even at that time we realized that this was going to take a while based on what, in my opinion, was RFTA’s rigid approach to negotiations,” Cortez said. Negotiations between the union and RFTA began in May. The parties convened several times throughout the summer, but could not reach an agreement on cost of living adjustments. After a Sept. 9 meeting, the parties reached an impasse and the union filed its intent to strike with the state. The bus operators initially asked to increase the maximum wage to $46 per hour. RFTA proposed increasing the maximum wage to $40 from about $39, according to a RFTA press release regarding the impasse. The union requested increasing the maximum wage to $43.72, which RFTA refused, Cortez told the Aspen Daily News. “RFTA gave us a $4 increase a year ago, which was a great raise, but they’ve been deferring wages now for 14 years and they’re just getting to a point where they’re, in our opinion, where they’re near to where we want the wages to be,” he said. “The wages right now cannot compensate for someone … to be able to survive here.” Last summer, the union negotiated with RFTA to increase starting pay for bus operators by $4 to $30 an hour. The union renegotiates its collective bargaining agreement every three years, but Cortez said the move to increase wages outside of formal negotiations was urgent. While the $4 increase was imperative to keeping drivers, the union is still looking for higher wages because of rising inflation costs and the cost of living in the Roaring Fork Valley. “What (RFTA management) said to us, point blank, was, ‘We feel you’re making enough money,’” Cortez said. “There’s no empathy for the drivers, it’s strictly business and what we’re doing now is strictly business.” “We’re going to let the state settle the issue or we’re going to go on strike,” he added. RFTA did not respond to specific questions about the negotiations. It instead sent a press release regarding the impasse. “RFTA believes their final offer for wages is more than reasonable, considering the recent wage adjustments made in the last two years and their 100th percentile market position of Bus Operator wages in the state of Colorado,” RFTA said in the release. “Unfortunately, the union disagreed and rejected RFTA’s last, best final proposal on wages, and all of RFTA’s other last best final proposals that remained on the table.” The union also asked RFTA to allow the union the option to strike even after an agreement is reached, which RFTA denied. It also asked RFTA to cease its use of AlertMeter — a 60-second graphics-based test that measures an individual’s cognitive alertness — and to give bus operators a say in changes that RFTA makes that impact drivers, like the decision to use AlertMeter. In a memo RFTA sent to bus operators and obtained by the Aspen Daily News, RFTA said it “had to stand firm on rejecting any proposals that could compromise the safe and efficient delivery of our services.” “Regarding other proposals that we could not agree upon, RFTA needs to ensure we can continue to implement important safety measures, address first-time drug and alcohol policy violations, manage absenteeism effectively, and maintain essential management rights that keep our operations running smoothly and safely,” the memo states. RFTA said it anticipated a decision from CDLE within the next 20 days. If it denies a strike, the matter will go to arbitration. If a strike is approved, RFTA said it is planning contingency plans to ensure minimal disruption to its service. “RFTA respects the union’s position and is committed to achieving an outcome that minimizes disruption to the vital services our customers rely on,” said RFTA CEO Kurt Ravenschlag in the release. “We also want to acknowledge and value the contributions of our bus operators, while also responsibly managing the community tax dollars that fund our essential services.” Ravenschlag fully took the reins as RFTA CEO in September. He was previously the chief operating officer, and took over for Dan Blankenship, who announced his retirement as CEO last year. ATU Local 1774 represents the roughly 150 bus operators employed by RFTA, Cortez said. About half of them are dues-paying members of the union.",

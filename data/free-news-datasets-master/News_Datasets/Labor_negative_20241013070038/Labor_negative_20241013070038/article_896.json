    "text": "The unfortunate move follows a previous wave of staff cuts earlier this year, after the newly acquired Activision Blizzard division sought to reduce “areas of overlap.” [cut the roles](https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-650-employees-1236141947/) of about 650 workers, roughly 3% of its global workforce. The unfortunate move follows a [previous wave](https://www.awn.com/news/microsoft-layoff-1900-activision-blizzard-xbox-employees) of staff cuts earlier this year, after the [newly acquired](https://www.awn.com/news/its-done-deal-microsofts-activision-blizzard-purchase-approved) Activision Blizzard division sought to reduce “areas of overlap.” “For the past year, our goal has been to minimize disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work,” Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in an email to staff Thursday. “As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming—mostly corporate and supporting functions—to organize our business for long term success.” Additionally, the Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile team will face both layoffs as well as a shift of staff to other teams. The recently launched Warcraft Rumble team will also be reduced. No titles, devices, studios, or “experiences” will be affected by the layoffs. Exiting U.S. workers will receive packages including severance, healthcare, and outplacement services. International employees will receive different exit packages depending on location.",

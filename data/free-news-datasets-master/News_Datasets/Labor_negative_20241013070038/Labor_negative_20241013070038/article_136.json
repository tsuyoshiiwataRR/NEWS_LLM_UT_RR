    "text": "PESHAWAR: The employees of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Culture and Tourism Authority on Thursday staged a protest against the non-renewal of their employment contracts. The sacked employees staged the protest outside the Provincial Assembly and Peshawar Press Club. The protestors were holding banners and placards demanding the renewal of their contracts and reinstatement in their jobs. The protesters claimed that the provincial government is discriminating against them. They claimed that the contracts of 65 employees ended last year but they were still working in their positions because they are favored individuals. They maintained that the process of dismissing 87 employees of the Tourism and Culture Authority was ongoing, saying that 57 employees had already been terminated on September 10 while the contracts of 30 employees were set to expire on the 30th of this month. The protesting employees demanded that their contracts be extended or that all positions be legally re-advertised. They also called for immediate steps to protect their rights and job security.

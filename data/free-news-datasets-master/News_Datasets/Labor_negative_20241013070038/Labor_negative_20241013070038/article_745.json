    "text": "A day after Stellantis announced $406 million in investments across three of its Michigan plants, the United Auto Workers (UAW) held a rally to emphasize that despite the automaker’s financial commitments, significant job cuts are looming at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant . The automaker’s plans to eliminate the second shift at the plant, which could affect nearly 2,500 jobs, were the focal point of the gathering on Thursday at UAW Local 140 in Warren, Michigan.\nUAW President Shawn Fain, addressing a crowd of union members and politicians, acknowledged Stellantis’ recent investments but stressed that they only represent a fraction of the company’s contractual commitments. Stellantis’ investment at Sterling Heights Assembly Plant will fund the production of the electric Ram 1500 REV pickup, while Warren Truck will build an electrified Jeep Wagoneer, and Dundee Engine will handle battery-related production. Fain criticized the company, noting that the investment at Warren Truck is just 17% of its pledged amount, and Stellantis has met only 2% of its commitments under the UAW agreement nationwide.\nFain also raised concerns about the future of the idled Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, warning that the union could escalate to a national strike if the company fails to meet its obligations. “What affects one of us affects all of us,” Fain declared, signaling that the union will fully enforce its contract, even to the point of striking if necessary.\nStellantis has denied violating any agreements, emphasizing in a statement that the company is focused on adapting to industry changes and ensuring future growth. The company highlighted its $97 million investment in Warren Truck as part of a broader strategy to streamline operations and enhance competitiveness as it transitions to a sustainable mobility tech company.\nThe rally underscored the tension between Stellantis and the UAW amid declining sales, falling profits, and a shrinking market share. Once celebrating high profits, Stellantis is now trailing behind major competitors like General Motors, Toyota, Ford, Hyundai, and Honda in the U.S. market. UAW President Fain has openly criticized Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares, calling him “a terrible CEO.”\nLocal 140 President Eric Graham, who led the rally, said the event aimed to demonstrate unity among union members as the plant faces layoffs. Eliminating the second shift at Warren Truck, where the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer are produced, will leave over 1,500 workers on indefinite layoff. Despite low morale at the plant, Graham urged members not to lose hope, highlighting the UAW’s resilience in past challenges.\nUnion members, including longtime employees like Gilbretta Hall, supported their colleagues facing layoffs. “We’re all feeling this,” Hall said, expressing solidarity with her fellow workers during this uncertain time.",

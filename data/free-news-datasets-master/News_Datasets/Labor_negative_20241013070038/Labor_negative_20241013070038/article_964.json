Shaw had been billed as the speaker at the conference before his dismissal.\nIt was a tumultuous end of a tumultuous tenure. Norfolk Southern was pushed into the national spotlight after a fiery derailment in 2023 spewed toxic chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio. Shaw also was at the center of attention when activist investor Ancora Holdings Group led a campaign earlier this year aimed at ousting him and other members of the company’s board.\nNorfolk Southern’s Board of Directors has appointed Mark R. George President and Chief Executive Officer through unanimous vote of independent directors.

He joined the Atlanta-based railroad in 2019 from the company now known as RTX Corp., where he served as CFO of the Otis elevator and Carrier climate businesses before their eventual spinoffs.\nGeorge said he plans to draw on his experience with factory floor productivity and quality control strategies to improve Norfolk Southern’s operations. “The tolerance for poor performance inside of rails has always bothered me,” he said.\nWant more news?

Boeing shares fell 3.4% in U.S. pre-market trading on Friday.\nNew CEO Kelly Ortberg CEO Kelly Ortberg has to confront a labor-management battle just weeks after he was brought in to restore faith in the planemaker.\nHe proposed a deal including a pay rise of 25% over four years, far lower than the 40% workers had demanded.\nRoughly 30,000 International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) members who produce Boeing's 737 MAX and other jets in the Seattle and Portland areas voted on their first full contract in 16 years, with 96% rejecting it and favoring a strike in a two-part ballot.\n\"This is about respect, this is about addressing the past, and this is about fighting for our future,\" said Jon Holden, who headed the negotiations for Boeing's largest union, before announcing the vote result on Thursday evening.\n\"We strike at midnight,\" said the union leader who had agreed to the just-defeated deal, as members in the union hall cheered and chanted: \"Strike! Strike! Strike!\"\nBOEING 'READY TO GET BACK TO THE TABLE'\nA long strike could badly hit Boeing's finances, which are already groaning due to a $60 billion debt pile.\nBoeing said late on Thursday the vote sent a clear message that the tentative deal it reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to members.\n\"We remain committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement,\" the planemaker said.\nThe proposed deal also included a $3,000 signing bonus and a pledge to build Boeing's next commercial jet in the Seattle area, provided the program was launched within the four years of the contract.\nAlthough IAM leadership recommended last Sunday that its members accept the contract, many workers had responded angrily, arguing for the original demand and lamenting the loss of an annual bonus.\n\"We're going to get back to the table as quickly as we can,\" Holden told reporters, without saying how long he thought the strike would last or when talks would resume. \"This is something that we take one day at a time, one week at a time.”\nMULTIPLE CHALLENGES FOR BOEING\nA strike presents Boeing with multiple challenges: it will need to decide how to respond at the bargaining table, after saying it had offered everything it could. It also must find a way to secure factories full of valuable, partially built planes without union workers to do the job.\nWorkers have been protesting all week in Boeing factories in the Seattle area that assemble Boeing's MAX, 777 and 767 jets.\nShortly after midnight, striking workers started to gather outside the entrances of Boeing factories in the Seattle area. Many waved placards that read: ‘On Strike Against Boeing', and drivers passing by honked their car horns in support.\n“I’m willing to strike for two months or even longer. Let’s go as long as it takes to get what we deserve,” said James Mann, a 26-year-old who works in a wings division at Boeing.\nIf prolonged, a strike would also weigh on airlines that depend on the planemaker’s jets and suppliers who manufacture parts and components for its aircraft.\nAir India CEO Campbell Wilson said on Friday that Boeing's 737 MAX deliveries to his airline appeared to be \"delayed a little bit\" even before the strike announcement because of regulatory scrutiny after the Alaska Airlines door incident and supply chain issues affecting the broader industry.\n\"There's nothing official yet, but I think the indication is, or the expectation is that it's going to be a little bit later,\" he said in an interview in Sydney.\nAccording to a pre-vote note from TD Cowen, a 50-day strike could cost Boeing an estimated $3 billion to $3.5 billion of cash flow.\nThe Boeing workers' last strike in 2008 shuttered plants for 52 days and hit revenue by an estimated $100 million per day.\nS&P Global Ratings said that an extended strike could delay the planemaker's recovery and hurt its overall rating. Both S&P and Moody's rate Boeing one notch above junk status.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n(Reporting by Joe Brock in Seattle, David Shepardson in Washington and Allison Lampert in Montreal; Additional reporting by Jamie Freed in Sydney; Writing by Jamie Freed, Peter Henderson and Sayantani Ghosh; Editing by Gerry Doyle and Elaine Hardcastle)\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Online Poll How many games do you predict the Broncos will win this season?

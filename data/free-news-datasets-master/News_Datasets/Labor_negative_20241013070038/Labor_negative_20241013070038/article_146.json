    "text": "Plumbers, fitters, welders and apprentices who are members of the Unite trade union are again picketing a number of construction sites around the country. It is part of a campaign seeking the restoration of cuts to the first hour of travel time implemented during the period after the financial crash in 2008. It is the second Friday running that the workers have engaged in strike action over the issue. The locations being picketed are construction projects by pharma company Pfizer in Grange Castle in Dublin and Ringaskiddy in Cork. The pickets are not aimed at Pfizer, but at members of the Mechanical Engineering & Building Services Contractors' Association (MEBSCA) who are carrying out works at the locations at present. MEBSCA has previously said that the first hour of travel time has been incorporated into hourly rates since 2011 as part of an agreement reached with Unite. It said the agreement had the effect of increasing the hourly rate which also resulted in a higher rate being paid for overtime and holidays. The association has claimed that Unite is now seeking to maintain the higher rate of pay while also seeking to reverse the agreement that was freely entered into by Unite at that time. MEBSCA has called for the union to engage in talks, a claim described as disingenuous by Unite because it says the organisation has refused to engage and make a meaningful offer. The pickets began at midnight and will run for almost 24 hours. Last week, construction projects for major companies including Intel, Diageo, Eli Lilly, Analog and the ESB were hit by a 24-hour work stoppage.",

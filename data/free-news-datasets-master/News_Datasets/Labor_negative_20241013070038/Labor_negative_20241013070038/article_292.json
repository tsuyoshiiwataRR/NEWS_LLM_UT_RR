    "text": "STERLING HEIGHTS, Mich. — To Ruth Breeden, who assembles Ram trucks in this Detroit suburb, a simmering dispute between the United Auto Workers and Stellantis isn’t merely about whether her employer will reopen a distant factory in Illinois. To her, the standoff is a danger sign for all UAW workers. Stellantis had pledged to reopen the factory in Belvidere, Illinois, under a contract it forged last year with the union. But the reopening was delayed given what the company calls unfavorable “market conditions.” Stellantis says it will eventually reopen the plant. But no date has been given to restart it or open a new battery plant and a parts warehouse, both of which were also promised in the contract that ended the UAW’s strike against Stellantis last year. At stake are over 2,700 jobs. Breeden and other union members fear that Stellantis will break other commitments, jeopardizing their jobs. “It’s the whole company,” she said at a union rally last month near her factory. “Who knows which plant is next?” Union leaders have threatened to strike, a move that could extend beyond Stellantis. Labor experts say its two Detroit-area rivals, Ford and General Motors, are watching as they consider strategies that include whether to move future production out of the U.S.",

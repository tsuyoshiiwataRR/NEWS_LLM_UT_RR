    "text": "Recent reports have revealed that all employees working at Annapurna Interactive have resigned. This information was published by Bloomberg and supported by IGN. If you are interested in the state of the video game industry, you can check out our other articles here. All Annapurna Interactive Employees Resign, Why? SCOOP: The entire staff of Annapurna Interactive has resigned, leaving dev partners scrambling to figure out what’s next. The video game publisher had been negotiating with Annapurna owner Megan Ellison (Larry’s daughter) to spin out. Deal fell through. https://t.co/aDUxW2oK8g— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) [September 12, 2024](https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1834347547952890144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Bloomberg reported that Annapurna Interactive founder Nathan Gary and his team have been in talks with Annapurna Pictures founder Meghan Ellison to spin off the games division as an independent company. IGN later corroborated the report. When Ellison withdrew from negotiations, Gary and other executives resigned, followed by about two dozen other employees. “All 25 members of the Annapurna Interactive team have collectively resigned,” Gary said in a statement to Bloomberg. “This is one of the most difficult decisions we have ever had to make and we do not take this action lightly.” An Annapurna Pictures spokesperson also confirmed to Bloomberg that they had explored the separation and the two parties failed to reach an agreement, leading to the resignation. Here is Meghan Ellison’s official statement to Bloomberg: Our top priority is to continue supporting our developer and publisher partners during this transition. We are committed to not only developing our existing games, but also expanding our presence in the interactive world as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, games, and theater. Meghan Ellison, Founder of Annapurna Pictures Annapurna Interactive’s new president, Hector Sanchez, who just rejoined in August 2024, has told developers that they will honor existing contracts and replace employees who have left. In early September 2024, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Annapurna Interactive was looking to expand into AAA games. The Fate of All Games to be Published by Annapurna Interactive? On the other hand, Bloomberg reports that this resignation has caused chaos among the developers who partnered with Annapurna Interactive. Remedy Entertainment’s communications director, Thomas Puha, clarified that the deal for the self-publishing of Control 2 as well as the film and TV adaptations for Control and Alan Wake is with Annapurna Pictures, not Annapurna Interactive. The Stanley Parable developer Davey Wreden confirmed that his next Ivy Road game, Wanderstop, will not be affected. The studio behind the Mixtape, Beethoven & Dinosaur, simply said: “Appreciate everyone who has reached out. The Mixtape continues.” Matt Newell, the developer behind Lushfoil Photography Sim, also posted his own statement regarding the Annapurna Interactive situation: It’s safe to assume at this point that Lushfoil Photography Sim won’t be affected, considering the game itself is mostly finished. I’ll keep you all posted. But this news is definitely a loss, the Annapurna Interactive team was a joy to work with and put a lot of love into the project. Matt Newell An Annapurna Pictures spokesperson has told Bloomberg that all existing games and projects will remain under the Annapurna Interactive umbrella. It’s still unclear what will happen to Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, the first game being developed internally by Annapurna Interactive. There are 8 other games that will be published by Annapurna Interactive: Bounty Star (DINOGOD) Ghost Bike (Messhof) Skin Deep (Blendo Games) We Kill Monsters (Glass Revolver) to a T (uvula) The Lost Wild (Great Ape Games) Forever Ago (Third Shift) Morsels (Furcula)",

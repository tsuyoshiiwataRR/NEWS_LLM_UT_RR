    "text": "ABUJA – The Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU) as well as the Public Service International (PSI) have criticised the Federal Government over what it termed blanket clampdown of trade unions and opposing voices in Nigeria.\nBoth groups warned that their global union movement is closely monitoring the ongoing harassment of Nigerian union leaders and will not accept this sort of intimidation.\nRecall that following the invasion, invitation, arrest and subsequent seizure of the standard passport of the President of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Joe Ajaero, the global union federation of more than 700 trade unions representing 30 million workers in 154 countries, observed that democracy is endangered in an atmosphere that does not allow for unfettered freedom of expression.\nThe General Secretary of the body, Daniel Bertossa, condemned the treatment meted out to Ajaero by the government.\nOn the 9th of September, 2024 Ajaero, who is also the General Secretary of the PSI-affiliated National Union of Electricity Employees of Nigeria, was arrested by operatives of the Department of State Service while on his way to the airport to meet with Trade Union Congress colleagues in the United Kingdom.\nPSI said it is closely monitoring the actions of the government relating to the way it treats Nigerians who express opposition to some of the policies the government has introduced that are capable of deepening poverty and threatening existing jobs.\n“Arrests of our comrades such as Joe Ajaero are damaging Nigeria’s international reputation. We call on the Government to respect international labour rights and release all unlawfully imprisoned unionists and members and end this campaign of harassment,” he stated.\nSimilarly, General Secretary of NASU, Peter Adeyemi, said the actions of the government towards labour leaders seem to suggest a government that is intolerant to criticism and Nigerians that hold opposing views.\nAdeyemi, who is also the PSI’s Vice President representing Africa and Arab, added: “The arrest of Comrade Ajero is not only an unnecessary witch-hunt but a clear attempt on the part of the Nigerian government to intimidate and harass Nigeria trade unions leaders.\nHe said even during the reign of the military, we didn’t witness this level of excessive use of state powers to intimidate and coerce labour leaders”.\nHe noted that rather than suppress the voice of dissent, the government should positively redress its anti-people policies towards the emancipation of the downtrodden Nigerian workers.\nHe observed that while Ajaero has now been released on bail, the ramping up of intimidation efforts against activists and union leaders is causing concern around the world.\nPSI also urged the working people of Nigeria, Africa and the world to stand in solidarity against all forms of authoritarian regimes, attacks on trade unions and their leaders, and the citizenry.\n“Instead of harassing civil society leaders and unionists, governments should be focused on serving the people by providing quality public services, good working conditions, and an economy where everyone thrives.\n“The global leadership of Public Services International (PSI) will join hands with leaders in Africa and the Arab Country region, and the African Regional Organization of the International Trade Union Confederation ITUC-Africa, in condemning persistent harassment of union leaders and is ready to raise this issue with international institutions including the International Labour Organization,” the groups threatened.",

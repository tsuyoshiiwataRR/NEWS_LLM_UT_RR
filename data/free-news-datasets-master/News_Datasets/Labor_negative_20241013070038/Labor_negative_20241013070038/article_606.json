    "text": "The Globe and Mail reports in its Friday, Sept. 13, edition that Ventum Capital Markets analyst Amr Ezzat continues to rank Blackline Safety \"buy.\" The Globe's David Leeder writes in the Eye On Equities column that Mr. Ezzat jacked his share target ahead by 50 cents to $7. Analysts on average target the shares at $6.94. Mr. Ezzat sees Blackline Safety \"flexing its muscle,\" reiterating a \"highly positive\" outlook for the company given its \"strengthening profitability and accelerating momentum.\" Mr. Ezzat says in a note: \"Born from a relentless commitment to innovation, Blackline has emerged as the undisputed industry leader in true connected safety solutions. Since F2014, Blackline has reinvested almost 26 per cent of its sales into product development resulting in a differentiated product line and a three- to five-year technological lead over competitors. Yet, despite its clear market leadership, investors often pigeonhole this trailblazer as merely a hardware provider to the Canadian energy sector. This narrow view overlooks a much richer narrative. ... Seventy-five per cent of its business is now outside Canada and only 40 per cent tied to oil and gas — a far cry from the company's beginnings.\"\n© 2024 Canjex Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.",

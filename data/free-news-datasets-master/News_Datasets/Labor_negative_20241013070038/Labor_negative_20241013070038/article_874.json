    "text": "The News Tens of thousands of Boeing factory workers went on strike Friday for the first time since 2008, after rejecting a deal that included a 25% pay increase over four years, in another blow to the company amid safety concerns and a growing debt burden. “ [The message was clear](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8jlj3dnlw7o) that the tentative agreement we reached with IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members,” Boeing said in a statement, in reference to the almost 95% of union members who rejected the pay deal. The company said it was ready to go back to the negotiating table and reach a new agreement. The strike is unlikely to immediately disrupt commercial flights, but is expected to halt production of its commercial airplanes. The walkout comes a month after aerospace industry veteran and engineer Kelly Ortberg took over as Boeing’s chief executive. Boeing’s strike is the latest in a series of labor actions that surged in 2023 in what was dubbed as ” [hot labor summer](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/the-historic-battles-of-hot-labor-summer).” Supply chain issues brought on by the pandemic significantly upended companies’ relationship with employees, Bloomberg’s Industrial Strength newsletter wrote: “Unions have realized that they are the ones with the leverage — not the companies — and [they’re pushing it to their advantage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-13/boeing-ba-worker-strike-underscores-new-normal-for-industrial-labor-relations).”",

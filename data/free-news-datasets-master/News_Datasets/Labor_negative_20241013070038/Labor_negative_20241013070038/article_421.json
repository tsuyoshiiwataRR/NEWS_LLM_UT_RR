    "text": "A delivery business boss has been awarded more than £46,000 in compensation for constructive dismissal after he raised concerns about the safety of the e-bikes his company used.\nSébastien Potts was UK head of Urb-it, a Swedish delivery business that used e-bikes, and started working for the company in early 2021.\nThe company promoted an image of “accelerating sustainable urban logistics by offering fast, reliable, and emission-free deliveries”, and stored the bikes in hubs in London.\nPotts raised concerns with the chief executive, Kevin Kviblad, in September 2022 that there was a high risk of fire in the hubs because of the charging process for the bikes’ lithium batteries.\nWhistleblowing\nCity whistleblower who suspected a Chinese spy wins £500k Hotlines fail to quell concerns over whistleblowing at global businesses\nHe said that there was a “risk to life of employees and the public”, and urged the company to take action to prevent this risk. He also wanted to know what his responsibility as a country director would be if something were to happen.\nThe tribunal heard that his fears had been prompted by a fire in 2022 in a railway arch near to one of the hubs, which had been caused by lithium batteries.\nHe suggested the company install fire-safe boxes for the batteries, but was told there were “funding constraints” that would prevent this.\nHe repeated his concerns a number of times, reiterating that company directors could be at risk of criminal prosecution for manslaughter.\nThe tribunal heard that Kviblad responded by saying that only Potts would be at risk because “all the other directors were Swedish citizens living in Sweden”. According to Swedish law, a corporation cannot commit a criminal act, and Kvibald would joke that there was no extradition agreement between the UK and Sweden.\nPotts said: “Every time I raised my concerns I was reminded again there was no extradition order and I felt Kevin did not take this seriously”.\nHe made the decision to resign in October 2022 and arranged a Teams meeting where he aired his concerns again. In the meeting, he also raised issues of discrimination against women and black members of the team.\nPotts asked for a nine-month notice period, but upon confirming his resignation, the company invoked his contractual notice of three months.\nIn\njudgment, Employment Judge Emery said Potts had been forced to resign because he blew the whistle on a number of safety complaints and that “his manager did not appear to take the issue seriously”, instead claiming that Potts would be liable if an accident occurred.\nEmery said Potts’ treatment was a “repudiatory breach of contract, made because he raised whistleblowing allegations”, concluding he had been “automatically constructively dismissed”.\nThe company is now in voluntary liquidation. A\nremedy judgment has demanded it pay Potts more than £43,000 in lost pay and pensions, as well as expenses towards his relocation to Australia.\nSign up to our weekly round-up of HR news and guidance\nReceive the Personnel Today Direct e-newsletter every Wednesday\nEmployee relations opportunities on Personnel Today\nBrowse more Employee Relations jobs",

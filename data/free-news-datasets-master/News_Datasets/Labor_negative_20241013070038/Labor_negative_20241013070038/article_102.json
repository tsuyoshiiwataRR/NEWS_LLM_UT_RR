The South Korean tech giant has directed its subsidiaries worldwide to cut sales and marketing teams by around 15% and administrative staff by up to 30%, as reported by two of the sources. The restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of this year, affecting jobs in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Six additional sources confirmed Samsungâ€™s plans for [global staff reductions](/tag/global+staff+reductions). The exact number of employees affected and which countries or business units will see the largest impact remains uncertain. The sources requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the job cuts. Samsung, in a statement, described the workforce changes at some international operations as part of regular adjustments to enhance efficiency. The company clarified that there are no specific targets for the reductions and that production staff will not be affected by the plans. A source with knowledge of the plans indicated that the job reductions are being made in anticipation of a decline in global demand for technology products due to the slowing global economy. Another insider mentioned that Samsung aims to strengthen its financial performance by reducing expenses. It is currently unclear whether the company will also implement layoffs at its South Korean headquarters. Be the first one to comment. [Comment Now] COMMENTS [Comment Now] [Read Comment (1)]",

    "text": "Ather Energy organises Sadhya in the office, internet offended as it has chapatti Ather Energy has faced backlash after the company organised Onam Sadhya in the company. Why? Read to find out more! New Delhi: Onam Sadhya is a traditional vegetarian feast served during the Onam festival, a major celebration in the Indian state of Kerala. This elaborate meal, often enjoyed on a banana leaf, consists of a variety of dishes that showcase the rich culinary heritage of the region. Typically featuring more than 20 items, the Sadhya includes rice, along with an assortment of side dishes like sambar, avial, thoran, pickles, and papadum, as well as sweet treats like payasam. Each dish is meticulously prepared using seasonal ingredients, and the meal is a symbol of abundance, unity, and gratitude. Onam Sadhya is not just about food; it’s a celebration of community, tradition, and the harvest season. Asther Energy Onam Sadhya One company, Ather Energy, recently organised Onam Sadhya in office. Ather Energy CEO Tarun Mehta posted pictures on X, showing the Onam celebrations in the office. While everyone in the pictures look happy, Tarun and the company still came under the radar of criticism as one of the pictures showed a chapatti placed on the banana leaf as part of the Sadhya meal. Notably, roti is not a part of the Sadhya meal usually, which is why the criticism came the company’s way. Social media reacts Several social media users reacted to the pictures that Tarun Mehta posted. “There should be at least 28 dishes, also chapati shouldn’t be there,” one user wrote. “Chapati in an Onam sadhya. That’s a first!” another one wrote. Yet another person called it a North Indian Onam. “This is a random meal served on a leaf. Invoking the powers vested in me, I disqualify this as a Sadhya!” yet another comment read. “Onam with north indian style I guess. “Onam with north indian style i guess,” one more comment read. Well, it was a celebration nonetheless, don’t you think? What do you feel?",

    "text": "Thousands of Boeing employees walked off the job on Friday (September 13) after rejecting the company's latest contract offer. This move could create a significant disruption as Boeing works to ramp up production following a safety crisis. This strike, Boeing’s first in 16 years, is expected to bring a halt to operations in the Seattle area, where most of the company’s commercial planes are manufactured. This could further strain Boeing's already fragile supply chain.",

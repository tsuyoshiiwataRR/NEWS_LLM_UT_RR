    "text": "Boeing Machinists Vote for Strike Amid Contract Dispute Machinists at Boeing voted overwhelmingly to go on strike after rejecting a contract proposal that failed to meet their demands for significant wage increases and restored pensions. The strike will halt production of key aircraft models, posing a challenge for Boeing's new CEO Kelly Ortberg amid ongoing financial struggles. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Seattle | Updated: 13-09-2024 11:23 IST | Created: 13-09-2024 11:23 IST - Country: - United States Boeing's machinists have voted to strike, rejecting a proposed contract and halting production of key aircraft models. Amid ongoing financial woes and a battered reputation, this walkout poses a significant challenge for new CEO Kelly Ortberg, who recently took over to revive the company's fortunes. The strike vote saw 94.6% of workers rejecting the contract, which included a 25% pay raise over four years, and was a rebuke to union negotiators who had recommended approval.

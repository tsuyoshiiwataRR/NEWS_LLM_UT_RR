    "text": "2024-09-13 03:28:06\nThousands of employees of automotive supplier ZF are rallying across Germany to protest planned job cuts. The board points to the difficult conditions in the industry.\nEmployees of automotive supplier ZF have protested the company’s planned job cuts with a nationwide day of action. Chairman of ZF’s general works council, Achim Dietrich, expects more than 20,000 participants. At the company’s headquarters in Friedrichshafen alone, several thousand employees took to the streets. “Today was a record, I’ve never seen that before,” Dietrich said after a demonstration in the Lake Constance city. The works council chief called for job cuts and investments in German locations to be abandoned.\nAt the end of July, ZF announced that it will cut up to 14,000 jobs in Germany over the next four years. To this end, the foundation company plans to build several network locations with leaner structures.\nAround 54,000 people nationwide currently work at one of the country’s largest automotive suppliers. The extent to which cuts are planned at the 35 locations in Germany will be “clarified in the coming weeks,” the board said at the time. High debt and investment pressure have long been causing problems for the group.\nThe job cuts should not only affect production. Jobs in administration and research and development are also at risk. “We want to fight for every job because there is a livelihood and purchasing power behind it,” stressed Dietrich, who will also be at the table in the upcoming collective bargaining negotiations in the metal and electrical industries. “Of course, we have no guarantee that this will succeed. But after we had thousands of people on the streets today, I am very confident that we can achieve something.”\nThings are not going well on the German car market at the moment. New car sales fell in August compared to the same month last year. This is mainly due to the recent weak demand for purely electric cars, as data from the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) shows. But numbers have also fallen significantly for almost all other types of driving. The industry is particularly concerned about the Volkswagen Group, which is facing plant closures and layoffs.\n“We at ZF cannot isolate ourselves from the challenging conditions in the automotive industry, such as the delayed start of e-mobility and high production costs, especially in Germany,” explained Lea Corzilius, Chief Human Resources Officer and Director of Labor at ZF. We must prepare ZF for the future and further develop the locations in Germany so that they are sustainably competitive and solidly positioned. “The goal is to preserve as many secure and long-term jobs as possible.”\nBut works council director Dietrich sees the mistakes primarily in management. The board is dealing with too many measures at once, he said. They would scapegoat the workforce. “Of course, that doesn’t mean that these employees follow the board and are motivated.” On the contrary: It leads to blockages in production and development. And that nationwide.",

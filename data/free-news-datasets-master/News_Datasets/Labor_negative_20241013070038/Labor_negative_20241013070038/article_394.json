    "text": "NEW YORK, Sept. 13 (Bernama-dpa) -- US aircraft manufacturer Boeing announced on Thursday that it had failed to prevent a planned strike by its largest union, despite offering a 25 per cent pay increase over four years, reported German Press Agency (dpa).\nMachinists at Boeing voted overwhelmingly in favour of a strike, with 96 per cent in support.\nThe International Association of Machinists (IAM), which represents around 33,000 employees, said its members rejected a contract promising a 25 per cent pay increase over four years, as well as improvements in health costs and retirement. The contract was rejected by a majority of 94.6 per cent in the vote.\nThe union had initially sought a pay rise of about 40 per cent.\nBoeing had also agreed to manufacture new models in the unionised plants, a key demand of the union following the establishment of a non-union plant in South Carolina over 10 years ago to produce the 787 Dreamliner.\nBoeing is facing financial losses following a series of incidents related to the safety of its planes. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is withholding approval for the expansion of 737 production until the company can improve its quality control.\nIn January a door panel of a 737-9 blew out during an ascent, apparently due to a missing component.\n--BERNAMA-dpa\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial",

    "text": "She explained that the LinkedIn post she liked was about a topic she felt deeply passionate about -- employee mental health -- so she didn't see any harm in liking it. By: Lifestyle Desk New Delhi | September 13, 2024 13:27 IST 5 min read This incident raises important questions about the implications of social media engagement on job security and the evolving dynamics of workplace surveillance. (Source: Freepik) A mental health startup company recently fired an employee for liking a LinkedIn post that criticised toxic workplaces .\nThe ex-employee took to Reddit to share their ordeal, describing her workplace as an extremely toxic environment, with having to deal with a toxic manager, CEO and being made to follow strange rules.\nThe user, who goes by the Reddit name ‘Ashiean’, mentioned how she had the “displeasure of joining a mental health startup company,” where “the manager honestly made my life a living hell at work.”\nAdvertisement She added, “She was an extremely hostile person and always used to play dumb when the CEO was talking (sic).”\nShe went on to describe the impact such an aggressive environment had on her. “The toxicity started affecting me so badly that people around me got to know about it. There were times when I used to cry in the office toilet. It was that bad.”\nShe explained that the LinkedIn post she liked was about a topic she felt deeply passionate about — employee mental health — so she didn’t see any harm in liking it. She also mentioned that the post felt highly relatable to her.\n“The next thing I know is my CEO calls me over and fired me saying she can’t work with me because apparently I am spreading wrong things about the company,” she revealed.\nFired for liking a post on LinkedIn\nbyu/ashiean inIndianWorkplace\nAdvertisement This incident raises important questions about the implications of social media engagement on job security and the evolving dynamics of workplace surveillance. As companies become increasingly aware of their digital footprint, employees’ online activities are often scrutinised, leading to potential conflicts between freedom of expression and corporate reputation management.\nKnowing their online activity is being watched can make employees anxious. (Source: Freepik) But, what effect does it have? Gurleen Baruah, occupational psychologist and executive coach at That Culture Thing, tells indianexpress.com , “When employees feel their social media activity is being monitored by their employer , it can lead to several psychological effects that impact their well-being and performance.”\nHere’s a breakdown of how this can affect them:\nAnxiety and stress can skyrocket: Knowing their online activity is being watched can make employees anxious. They may worry about being judged or punished for what they post, even if it’s unrelated to work. This constant pressure can make them feel like they’re walking on eggshells, which leads to stress.\nAdvertisement Trust starts to crumble: When employers monitor social media, employees may feel like their personal space is being invaded, eroding the trust between them and their bosses. If they believe their employer doesn’t trust them, they’re likely to disengage.\nPrivacy concerns take over: One of the biggest worries employees have is that their personal boundaries are being crossed. Monitoring social media, especially personal accounts, can make them feel uncomfortable or even violated.\nFear of punishment looms: Employees may become paranoid that anything they post could lead to trouble at work. Whether it’s sharing opinions or simply interacting online, the fear of punishment can cause them to censor themselves unnecessarily.\nRebellion or retaliation: Interestingly, feeling monitored can sometimes backfire. Some employees might respond by becoming defiant or disengaged, doing the bare minimum or finding ways to resist the monitoring. This behaviour, known as counterproductive work behaviour, can harm both the employee and the company.\nAdvertisement How should companies balance protecting their reputation and maintaining a healthy work culture? According to Baruah, “Balancing the protection of a company’s reputation with maintaining a healthy work culture, while avoiding invasive surveillance, is a delicate but crucial task. Companies must focus on fostering trust and transparency while safeguarding their interests.”\nHere are some steps to take:\nBe Transparent: Clearly communicate the purpose and scope of monitoring to reduce anxiety and build trust. Involve employees in decision-making about surveillance practices.\nLimit to Work-Related Metrics: Monitor only work-related activities, avoiding personal behaviour unless legally justified. Restrict monitoring to work hours and devices.\nBuild Trust and Autonomy: Foster a culture of trust and accountability rather than relying on surveillance. Empowered employees are more aligned with company values.\nAdvertisement Use Monitoring for Positive Reinforcement: Use data to support and reward employees, not to punish them, to maintain morale and engagement.\nReview Practices Regularly: Regularly assess and adjust monitoring practices to ensure they are necessary and respectful of privacy, involving employee feedback.",

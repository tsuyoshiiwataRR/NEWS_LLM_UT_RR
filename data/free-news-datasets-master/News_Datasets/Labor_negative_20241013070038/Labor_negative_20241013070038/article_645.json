    "text": "Faced with financial and safety difficulties on its planes, the American aircraft manufacturer has seen its 33,000 workers massively reject a new agreement proposed by management. The strike begins this Friday, September 13 in the morning. Boeing workers in the Seattle area voted overwhelmingly to strike on Friday, rejecting a new contract offered by the troubled planemaker, their union said. Workers rejected the contract by 94.6 percent and voted Thursday night by 96 percent to strike, which begins this morning, said Jon Holden, president of the IAM-District 751 machinists union. “Our members spoke loud and clear tonight,” said Jon Holden, whose union, which represents about 33,000 workers in the Pacific Northwest, had initially supported the deal. The union leader had previously said he could not “to ensure that we get more by striking.” The strike will shut down two major aircraft assembly plants in the Puget Sound region — a two-thirds vote was needed to initiate a work stoppage when the current 16-year-old contract expires Thursday night. It will paralyze production of the 737, 777 and 767 freighter, whose deliveries are already accumulating delays. A situation that is all the more problematic since the aircraft manufacturer collects the largest part of the payment (around 60%) when the planes are handed over. According to TD Cowen analysts, a fifty-day strike would deprive Boeing of $3 to $3.5 billion in cash and would have an impact of $5.5 billion on turnover. Thursday’s vote marked a decisive rejection of a deal that workers said was far less generous than Boeing executives had claimed. The new contract, which covers IAM members in the Seattle area, included a 25 percent wage increase over four years and a commitment to invest in the region. It also called for the next plane to be built in the planemaker’s historic homeland, which was expected to provide jobs for decades to come. “We were sold off” Boeing, which reacted to the announcement of the strike by saying “engaged” in the negotiations, hoped that these concessions would be enough to dodge it. Its financial situation has been precarious since the crash of two 737 Max 8s in 2018 and 2019, which cost the lives of 346 people, and a multitude of production quality problems. “It’s no secret that our business is going through a difficult time, partly because of our own past mistakes. […] A strike would jeopardize our common recovery,” Kelly Ortberg, who succeeded Dave Calhoun as CEO of the American aircraft manufacturer on August 8, warned on Wednesday evening. He had urged employees not to “sacrifice” future progress due to “frustrations related to the past”But the disgruntled consider the salary increase too far removed from the union’s demands (+40% initially) and the section on pensions unsatisfactory. A week after taking office, Kelly Ortberg pledged to “reset” the relationship with the IAM. But upon reading the agreement, many union members reacted negatively and called for a work stoppage. “We were sold off,” Kamie Bryan, a Boeing employee for eighteen years, told AFP on Thursday after voting against the agreement and for the strike. “We should not take these few pennies they give us and be grateful,” she noted, emphasizing the scale of the “boss’ income”. $250 per week for strikers Televisions showed daily rallies of workers protesting in factories against wage measures that they consider inadequate in the face of inflation. After strikes in the automobile, entertainment and other sectors of activity, the unions are thus engaged in a new showdown. The IAM rules provide that strikers receive $250 per week starting in the third week of work stoppage. Boeing has been under increased scrutiny since an in-flight incident in early January involving an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 that followed a series of compliance and quality control issues and revived questions about the same deficiencies raised after the two crashes. The last strike at the American planemaker was in 2008 and lasted 57 days.",

    "text": "2024-09-13 09:17:31\nFew things have gone right for Boeing over the past five years. By this time tomorrow, the troubled company could add another mess to its growing list of problems: A mass strike by 33,000 workers that could halt aircraft production at America’s biggest exporter and deal a blow to U.S. economy. Boeing workers in Seattle voted 96 percent in favor of strike action, halting production of the company’s best-selling plane at a time when Boeing is grappling with chronic production delays and mounting debt.\nThe first strike of the company’s employees since 2008 will begin at midnight (local time, 10:00 Greek time), weeks after new CEO Kelly Ortberg took over in August to restore confidence in the company after a door was detached from a 737 MAX.\nAbout 30,000 workers who build Boeing’s 737 MAX and other jets in the Seattle and Portland areas were being asked to vote on their first full labor contract in 16 years.\nUnder International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) rules, at least two-thirds of unionized workers had to vote in favor of a strike to go ahead and reject the contract.\nThe agreement with the administration was also rejected Boeing workers voted 96% to strike and 94.6% to reject the deal.\nThe deal included a 25 percent across-the-board wage increase, a $3,000 signing bonus, and a promise to build the next commercial jet in the Seattle area, provided the construction program begins within four years of signing. of the agreement.\nAlthough IAM leadership recommended last Sunday that its members accept the contract, many workers responded angrily, backing the original demand for a 40 percent pay rise and lamenting the loss of an annual bonus.\nOn Wednesday, Ortberg sent a letter to workers urging them to approve the deal.\nSome workers were already preparing that day for picketing. A union member left a meeting Wednesday holding a “Strike Against Boeing” sign under his arm.\nSources: Reuters, AFP, APE-MPE, CNN\nBOEING BOEING 737 MAX STRIKE STRIKE MOVEMENTS USA Share: Share via Facebook Share via Twitter Share via LinkedIn Share via Email\nFollow us on Google News and be the first to know all the news!\nandroid\nFollow us on the official “N” channel on Viber\nFollow us on the official “N” YouTube channel",

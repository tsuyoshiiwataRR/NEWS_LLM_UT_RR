    "text": "MUMBAI: The Dharamveer Anand Dighe Saheb Maharashtra Autorickshaw ani Metered Taxi chalak welfare board has set a registration fee of Rs 500 and an annual membership fee of Rs 300. In response, the Mumbai Autorickshaw-Taximens Union submitted a petition to chief minister Eknath Shinde on Friday, expressing their strong opposition to these fees.The union's president, Shashank Rao, stated in the petition: \\\"The auto and taxi drivers observe all rules and they earn their livelihood after working strenuously round the clock ferrying passengers on long and short distance routes. They also incurred huge losses during Covid pandemic and many autos and taxis were off roads during that period. Why are they being asked to pay money to become members of the welfare board?\\\"Rao emphasised that drivers already bear the costs of fuel, insurance, and vehicle maintenance on a monthly basis. He pointed out that the unions have been advocating for a welfare board for drivers for the past 15 years. While the current government has announced the establishment of such a board, it has not provided details on the benefits that will be offered to drivers and their families. Instead, the government has distributed membership forms and demanded fees, which the union firmly opposes. The union insists that there should be no charges for auto and taxi drivers to join the board.In the petition, the union also put forth several demands, including a pension equal to 30% of average monthly earnings for those above 65 years of age, Rs 10 lakh compensation to the family of drivers who lose their lives in accidents, medical insurance of up to Rs 10 lakh for drivers and their family members, and Rs 10 lakh interest-free education loans for the children of auto-taxi drivers.",

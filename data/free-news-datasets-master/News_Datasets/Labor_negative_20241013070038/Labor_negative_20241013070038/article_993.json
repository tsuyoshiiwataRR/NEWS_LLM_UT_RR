    "text": "Boeing Workers Strike: Showdown Over Wage Dispute Boeing's blue-collar workers in the Pacific Northwest have gone on strike after rejecting a proposed contract offering a 25% wage increase over four years. This walkout, involving 33,000 machinists, threatens to halt production of Boeing's top-selling jetliners and compound the company's existing financial woes and reputational damage. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Seattle | Updated: 14-09-2024 00:27 IST | Created: 14-09-2024 00:27 IST - Country: - United States Boeing's blue-collar workers in the Pacific Northwest took to picket lines on Friday, rejecting a proposed contract that aimed to increase wages by 25% over four years. The strike involves 33,000 machinists and is expected to shut down production of Boeing's best-selling jetliners, adding to the company's ongoing financial struggles. The union, representing a majority of the workers, overwhelmingly rejected the contract as inadequate. Workers cited soaring living costs in the Pacific Northwest as a key reason, arguing that the proposed wage increases fail to keep pace with inflation. The company's stock plummeted over 3% following the strike announcement. The strike poses a significant challenge to Boeing's new CEO and marks another hurdle for the aerospace giant, which has already suffered billions in losses. As negotiations are set to resume, both sides remain committed to finding a resolution to this impasse. (With inputs from agencies.)

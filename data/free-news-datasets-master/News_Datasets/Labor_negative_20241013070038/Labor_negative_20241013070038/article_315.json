    "text": "Delhi BJP Chief Calls for Kejriwal's Resignation After Bail Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva has called for CM Arvind Kejriwal's resignation following his bail granted by the Supreme Court. Sachdeva accused Kejriwal and AAP of lacking moral character and expressed concerns over the court's serious observations regarding Kejriwal's arrest and the excise policy scam. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 13-09-2024 12:46 IST | Created: 13-09-2024 12:46 IST - Country: - India In a scathing attack on Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal following his bail approval by the Supreme Court, Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva called for Kejriwal's immediate resignation, citing a lack of moral character. 'If he has any morality left, he should resign immediately. Arvind Kejriwal and AAP have no moral character and are far removed from the true essence of 'Satyameva Jayate,'' said Sachdeva. He added that despite the Supreme Court declaring Kejriwal's arrest legal, AAP continues to misinterpret the term 'Satyameva Jayate.' Sachdeva further stated, 'Bail does not equate to acquittal. Arvind Kejriwal has just joined the 'jamanati club'. The court has serious observations about his arrest in the excise policy scam. The legal process is ongoing, and if convicted, Kejriwal and his aides will face punishment.' The Supreme Court granted Kejriwal bail in a corruption case related to the alleged excise policy scam on Friday, asserting that prolonged incarceration would be an unjust deprivation of liberty. The Court had previously reserved its verdict on September 5 after the hearings. Kejriwal, arrested by the ED on March 21, 2024, and later by CBI on June 26, 2024, is under investigation for money laundering linked to irregularities in the now-cancelled Delhi excise policy of 2021-22.

    "text": "Workers at Samsung Electronics’ southern India plant have been on strike for three days, seeking higher wages and safer working conditions. The strike is disrupting production at the consumer appliances unit, which primarily manufactures televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines.\nThe Sriperumbudur plant, near Chennai, is one of the largest in India, accounting for 20% to 30% of Samsung’s annual revenue of about $12 billion. Union leader E. Muthukumar asserted that the strike will persist until workers’ demands are met, with further negotiations planned for Friday evening.\nOn the first day, the strike halted approximately 50% of planned daily production, decreasing to around 30% on the second day. In response to the unrest, Samsung has hired temporary workers to sustain production levels.\nWorkers are demanding that Samsung recognize their union, raise wages, and enhance working hours. Samsung officials, including Southwest Asia CEO JB Park, have visited the facility to address worker concerns, yet reports suggest the company has not agreed to recognize the union, backed by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU).\nWorkers, wearing blue Samsung uniforms and red CITU caps, have established a camp outside the factory to provide meals for one another. The strike occurs at a crucial time, just before India’s busy buying season when consumer spending typically rises.\nPrevious labor actions in South Korea, involving Samsung’s largest union of 36,500 members, also sought higher wages and benefits, but did not disrupt production. Currently, there are no reports of similar unrest at Samsung’s smartphone manufacturing facility in Uttar Pradesh. Nonetheless, the union and workers remain united in their demands.",

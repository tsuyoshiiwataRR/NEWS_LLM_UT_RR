    "text": "By Beth Treffeisen ,\n6 hours ago Following the Labor Day weekend strike, hotel workers at four other hotels are striking.\nHotel workers demonstrate as they strike over the Labor Day holiday weekend outside of the Boston Park Plaza Hotel in Boston. Joseph Prezioso / Getty Images More than 400 Boston hotel workers at Moxy Boston Downtown, The Newbury Boston, W Boston Hotel, and the Dagny are participating in the second wave of citywide hotel worker strikes.\nUNITE HERE Local 26 says the workers, ranging from room attendants to housekeepers to cooks and dishwashers, are protesting unfair working conditions and wages that don’t keep up with the cost of living.\nThe strike comes after over 900 hotel workers walked off the job for three days during Labor Day weekend at four properties: Hilton Park Plaza, Hilton Boston Logan Airport, Hampton Inn & Homewood Suites at the Hilton Seaport, and Fairmont Copley Plaza.\nThe workers’ previous contract expired on Aug. 31.\nThe strikes go beyond Boston. Union workers authorized strikes in 12 cities across the U.S., including in nearby Providence.\nUNITE HERE says many hotel workers say their wages aren’t enough to cover the cost of living and they have to take on additional employment to make ends meet.\n“Going on strike is a difficult thing to do, but I’m thinking about my family’s future in the long term,” said Alicia Cacho, a front desk agent at The Newbury Boston for 12 years, in a statement. “The hotel owners know how hard we work and how expensive it is to live in Boston. We know our worth, and we’re willing to do whatever it takes to win the raises, benefits, and job security that we deserve!”\nCarlos Aramayo, president of UNITE HERE Local 26, said the union and hotel companies remain far apart on strike issues, including raises, workloads, and COVID-era cuts.\n“The travel industry is booming in Boston, and it’s unacceptable for hotel companies to boost profits by cutting their offerings to guests and abandoning their responsibility to workers,” he said in a statement.\nUNITE HERE says more strikes are possible as the issues remain unresolved.\nThe union asks that guests not eat, sleep, or meet at any hotel in Boston or nationally that is on strike.\nUNITE HERE Local 26 represents workers in the hospitality industry in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

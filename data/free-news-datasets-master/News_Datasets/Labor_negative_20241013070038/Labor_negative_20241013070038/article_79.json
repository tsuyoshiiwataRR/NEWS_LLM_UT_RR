    "text": "STILLWATER COUNTY, Mont. -- Sibanye Stillwater, the U.S. division of the global mining company, announced restructuring plans for its Montana operations. The announcement has raised concerns among its employees and the local community. Sibanye Stillwater operates three facilities in Montana: the Columbus warehouse and the Nye mine in Stillwater County, and the East Boulder mine in Sweet Grass County. On July 31, 2024, the company reported employing over 1,600 workers across these sites. Following the layoffs, fewer than 1,000 employees will remain, according to an announcement made earlier today. Palladium prices have been consistently falling over the last two years, according to the company's executive vice president. During the summer of 2023, palladium traded around $1,200 per ounce. However, over the last three months, prices have dropped below $1,000 per ounce, making production costs higher than the profits earned. In a letter to employees, Sibanye Stillwater detailed its cost-reduction plans. \"We must address the especially high cost of our Stillwater West operations. The only way to do this is to place those operations on care and maintenance for now,\" the letter stated. \"We also plan to reduce operations at East Boulder from six ramps to four ramps, which will reduce costs and ensure sustainable production,\" the letter continued. Two anonymous mine employees expressed their concerns after today's announcement. One employee shared their disappointment, emphasizing the unexpected nature of the layoffs. \"Everybody we work with becomes family and it's going to affect someone we know. And it's very disheartening to know that part of this probably could have been prevented in the first place,\" one mine employee said. \"A lot of those guys have families and it's their main source of income. It does affect you and your mood while you are at work because you are thinking about that instead of thinking about your jobs. It makes me nervous because I know a lot of guys think about it and I don't want them to get hurt because they are thinking about this layoff,\" the employee added. The employees believe that better financial management could have prevented the current situation. They expressed frustration over company spending. \"It's been frustrating seeing some of the times that we have invested money in... It's not money spent, but not more product coming out of the mine and we don't see the benefit on some of the things they have spent money on,\" they said. The letter serves as the 60-day notice required by law for layoffs affecting at least one-third of a work siteâ€™s workforce. The company will start notifying affected employees today, with the first round of layoffs beginning on November 12, 2024. Robertson acknowledged the difficult times ahead, stating the company will support those impacted and connect them with future employment opportunities. The community remains concerned about the future of Sibanye Stillwater's Montana operations and its impact on local workers.",

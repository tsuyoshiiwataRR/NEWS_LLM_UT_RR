    "text": "Representatives of the current government in Podgorica continue to abuse state resources during the election campaign. The latest example of this is the organization of a pre-election meeting of the coalition \"Europe Now-Democrats - Even Stronger - Prof. Dr. Saša Mujović\" with the residents of Lješanska nahija in the premises of the elementary school \"Savo Kažić\" in Barutana, announced the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS). of the capital city. \"The fact that the Minister of Education, Science and Innovation, Anđela Jakšić Stojanović, is in the front row at the mentioned meeting, who in this way sends a message to the public that the fundamental law for the field of education should be passed. - The general law on education and upbringing, which, among other things, prescribes that political activity and organizing, as well as the use of educational institutions for political purposes, is expressly prohibited, does not apply to her,\" the announcement states. They called on Jakšić Stojanović to take the burden of responsibility for the \"brutal violation of the law and show a minimum of ethics by submitting his irrevocable resignation from the position of Minister of Education\". \"...And the competent institutions should finally deal with the supervision of the implementation of the Law on the Financing of Political Entities and Election Campaigns, because the previous results of the Agency for the Prevention of Corruption are not sufficient to improve the legality of the electoral process in Montenegro,\" the announcement concludes.

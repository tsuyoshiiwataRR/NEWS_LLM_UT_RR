    "text": "Boeing factory workers went on strike early Friday morning after overwhelmingly rejecting a new union contract with the company.\nAround 33,000 machinists went on strike shortly after midnight on the West Coast after the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) union announced 94.6 percent of workers had voted to reject the proposal and 96 percent approved the stoppage.\nThe work stoppage puts financial strain on the storied airplane maker, which has been struggling to repair its reputation after the door plug of a Boeing 737 Max 9 blew out during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, prompting regulatory action and congressional scrutiny.\nBoeing President Kelly Ortberg, who took over the company early last month, sent a message to workers Wednesday urging them to accept the contract, which had included a 25 percent wage increase over the next four years.\n“For Boeing, it is no secret that our business is in a difficult period, in part due to our own mistakes in the past,” Ortberg wrote.",

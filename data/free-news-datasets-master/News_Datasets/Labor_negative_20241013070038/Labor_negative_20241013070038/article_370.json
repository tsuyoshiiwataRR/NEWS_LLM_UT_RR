    "text": "4 Min Read Boeing Co. factory workers walked off the job for the first time in 16 years, crippling manufacturing across the planemaker’s Seattle commercial jet hub after members of its largest union rejected a contract offer and voted to strike. Members of the International Association of Machinists And Aerospace Workers, which represents 33,000 Boeing employees across the US West Coast, voted overwhelmingly to strike on Thursday in Seattle, with 94.6% voting to reject the offer and 96% supporting a strike. They downed tools officially at midnight local time. While both parties have expressed a desire to get back to the bargaining table sooner rather than later, the move adds to the strain on Boeing. The company was already reeling from the fallout over quality lapses after a near-catastrophe at the start of 2024 that spurred investigations, a customer revolt and an executive shake-up. “This has been a long time coming, our members spoke loud and clear tonight,” Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, said to a packed hall of union members and media. “Clearly there were aspects of this agreement that weren’t good enough.” By the time he’d finished speaking, the chants of “strike, strike” were deafening. Boeing builds 737 Max jetliners at its Renton factory on the outskirts of Seattle and makes 777 and 767 models at its Everett facility to the city’s north. Holden added that Boeing’s offer didn’t compensate for 16 years of stagnated wages, higher out-of-pocket health care costs and the relocation of thousands of union jobs. “There’s a lot at stake here for our members, so I am proud of them,” he said. “And we’re going to get back to the table as quickly as we can.” Boeing said in a statement that it remains “committed to resetting our relationship with our employees and the union, and we are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.” By striking, members ignored a plea for peace by new Boeing Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg, who has vowed to reset labor relations. And they bucked the recommendation of their own union leaders that they accept terms that included a 25% guaranteed wage increase over four years. While that’s the largest such pay hike ever offered by the planemaker, workers had expected a far greater increase. They were also angered that the terms also eliminated an annual bonus. Boeing has been in a financially difficult situation since a Jan. 5 accident exposed deficiencies at its factories and forced the planemaker to reduce production. The company has been bleeding cash as a result, and its credit rating is hovering one step above speculative grade, putting the planemaker in a difficult position as it contends with a heavy debt load of $45 billion. The defeat at the hand of workers means that Boeing and IAM District 751 will need to head back to the negotiating table to try and find terms that satisfy members of a union with a long history of activism. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at TD Cowen, has estimated a 50-day walkout, in line with previous strikes, clipping between $3 billion and $3.5 billion from Boeing’s cash flow. Boeing workers will now start to man picket lines at about 30 company gates from California to Moses Lake, in eastern Washington. Because the union is claiming an unfair labor practices strike, a mediator will be assigned by the federal National Labor Relations Board, Holden said. Boeing said earlier its offer was the best it could put forward given its strained finances. Managers have been canvassing other workers this week to see if they have the skills to temporarily replace striking IAM members. In the lead up to the late-night decision, IAM members outside of Boeing’s Renton factory voiced their anger at the offer and described the frustration of seeing wages stagnate under a long-term deal struck in 2014 that also eliminated pensions. They’re also mad the company kept a provision that forces hourly workers to be on the job for six years before they reach the maximum pay categories. “I’m working stupid amounts of overtime just to get by,” said Zachary Haley, a 737 quality assurance inspector who’s been with Boeing for five years.

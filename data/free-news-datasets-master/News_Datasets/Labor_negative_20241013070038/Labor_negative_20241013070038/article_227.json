    "text": "Machinists at Boeing voted Thursday to go on strike, another setback for the giant aircraft maker whose reputation and finances have been battered and now faces a shutdown in production of its best-selling airline planes. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said its members rejected a contract that would have raised pay 25 per cent over four years, then voted 94.6 per cent to reject the contract and voted 96 per cent to strike. A two-thirds vote among 33,000 workers was needed to strike.

As long as the strike lasts, it will deprive Boeing of much-needed cash that it gets from delivering new planes to airlines. That will be another challenge for new CEO Kelly Ortberg, who six weeks ago was given the job of turning around a company that has lost more than $25 billion in the last six years and fallen behind European rival Airbus. Ortberg warned machinists that a strike vote would put Boeing's recovery in jeopardy and raise more doubt about the company in the eyes of its airline customers. Workers were in no mood to listen.\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nAlso Read Boeing workers vote on whether to strike, shut down aircraft production Boeing faces possible strike, its union to vote for a new labour contract Boeing must be 'in the green' before 737 Max cap lifted, says FAA chief Boeing labour deal angers many union workers ahead of vote, says official Boeing's shares rise after tentative labour deal that could avert strike Topics : Boeing airlines Protest Don't miss the most important news and views of the day.

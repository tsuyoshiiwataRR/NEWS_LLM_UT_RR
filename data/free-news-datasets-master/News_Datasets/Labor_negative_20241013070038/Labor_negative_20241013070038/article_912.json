    "text": "MISSISSAUGA — Both ACTA and CATO are calling for a quick resolution to yet another possible airline labour disruption next week.\nACTA President Wendy Paradis, who offered her take on Air Canada’s situation at the ACTA Summit yesterday in Toronto, says the airline’s leadership team has been proactive in working with ACTA to help keep travel advisors informed ahead of the strike threat.\n“We’re experiencing the third potential strike in transportation strike in three months in Canada,” said Paradis. “That creates havoc in our industry, and stress for every single person in this room. I just want to acknowledge the elephant in the room that we have a potential disruption in front of us.”\nLast week ACTA along with TIAC urged the federal government “to engage promptly in facilitating a resolution to avert another significant challenge facing the travel industry.”\nYesterday Paradis said that not only ACTA and TIAC, but also the Hotel Association of Canada, and the National Chamber of Commerce, “we are urging Air Canada, we are urging the union, and we are urging the federal government to work really hard together to come to a resolution.”\nParadis added: “Our message is: negotiate and come to a resolution as soon as possible. Do everything in your power for those three parties to come to a resolution.”\nShe went on to say that for the Air Canada team, everything that they’re aware of is on the airline’s travel advisor portal. “If you have not familiarized yourself with the portal, it’s really important that you do that, so that you can be the best travel advisor you can be to your clients. That’s where the most up to date information will be.”\nMeanwhile the advocates of the industry will continue to push all three parties for a resolution, she said.\nParadis added that whether it’s in Canada, the U.S. or Europe, “there are a lot of potential labor disruptions around the world pending over the next couple of years. So it’s really important that we are prepared and we are proactive, so that if these things happen, that we can take care of our travellers as much as possible.”\nCATO LENDS ITS SUPPORT\nThe Canadian Association of Tour Operators (CATO) also released a statement today, Sept. 13, to express its support for Air Canada’s recent appeal to the federal government to direct arbitration .\nSaid Jean Hébert, Executive Director: “As an organization representing a diverse range of tour operators across Canada, we recognize the critical role that Air Canada plays in facilitating travel both domestically and internationally. Any disruption in service could have significant repercussions not only for travellers, but also for the broader tourism industry, which relies heavily on the stability and reliability of air travel.”\nHébert added: “We urge the federal government to consider the importance of timely arbitration to ensure that travellers can continue to plan and enjoy their journeys without uncertainty. The tourism sector is a vital component of Canada’s economy, and it is essential that we work together to maintain its integrity and support the needs of all stakeholders involved.”",

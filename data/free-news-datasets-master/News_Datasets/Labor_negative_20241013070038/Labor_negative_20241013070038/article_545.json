    "text": "54 factories in Savar-Ashulia region have been declared closed to bring workers back to work through the ongoing labor movement, cessation of violence and negotiations. The owners have taken this decision in accordance with Article 13, paragraph 1 of the Labor Law. In addition to this, 60 more garment factories are closed today. As a result, a total of 114 ready-made garment factories have been closed in the region.\nBGMEA Senior Vice President Abdullah Hill Rakib confirmed the matter to Jago News on Wednesday (September 11).\nThis BGMEA leader complained, we thought that if the demands were accepted, the workers would return to work. But now we see that they are completely politically motivated and have resorted to violence and vandalism.\nMany owners have closed factories under Section 13(1) to bring workers back to work. We expect workers to return to work by Saturday. Earlier, some factories in this area were closed. Later introduced through discussion. Rakib also said that the factory there is working well.\nHe said, ‘If the production of a factory is declared closed under Section 13 (1) of the Labour Act, the workers will not get any kind of wages. That is, if the workers do not work in these factories, they will not get wages. We also discussed this with the law enforcement agencies. They also agreed.”\n“Previously the owners had assured the workers that they would meet their demands regarding the attendance bonus and lunch. Since there is a regional problem, for the time being it has been done for this region.’\nIn response to a question about whether it will be applicable in other regions, Rakib said: “It will be considered subject to discussions with the owners and union leaders there.”\nHe also said, “We will meet with all kinds of local political leaders and try to solve the problem through discussion.”\nIHO/ASA/GKS\n#labor #law #announced #closure #garment #factories",

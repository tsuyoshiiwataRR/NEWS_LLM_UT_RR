    "text": "Oil and gas solutions provider Kimray might cut over 100 positions, most in OKC Rebecca Heliot The Oklahoman Kimray Inc. began layoffs this week, eliminating around 120 positions and reducing its workforce by around 15% after the company underperformed in annual earnings.\nEmployees will be impacted during layoffs through Friday as the company undergoes corporate restructuring, Kimray Inc. announced in a news release Thursday. Staff cuts impacted employees from all departments, including administration, sales, production and support. Leadership attributed market changes and underperforming annual earnings as key factors contributing to workforce reduction.\n“While there has been a softening in the oil and gas market, there is still a healthy demand for our product,\" said CEO Thomas Hill lll. \"After evaluating our long-term goals, we decided to focus more on Kimray’s core business. This means reducing our staff and reorganizing our teams.”\nLayoffs primarily impact Kimray employees in Oklahoma City A majority of the layoffs impact local employees, though employees in other locations may be affected, too, said an employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the issue.\n\"[It] appears to be around 15-16% reduction in workforce, primarily in Oklahoma City but also across the various Kimray stores in Oklahoma, Texas and Pennsylvania,\" the employee said.\"Kimray has pretty aggressive EBITDA targets pf 43%+. This year has been in the mid- to upper 30s.\"\nAlthough Kimray stores remain operating during normal business hours, the energy firm's corporate headquarters at 52 NW 42 has been closed down until it reopens Sept. 15 as a direct result of layoffs.\nMore: Impact of Dell layoffs on Oklahoma City operations still uncertain\nKimray announced the layoffs in a news release Thursday afternoon, after employees received an email that morning from Hill regarding layoffs. The email to employees stated:\n\"Kimray's leadership team has been evaluating the company's long-term goals, organizational structure, revenue, costs, and staffing levels to determining what size Kimray should be moving forward. Unfortunately, Kimray's workforce has grown too large for our current and expected customer needs. Our increase in overhead and fixed costs is a primary reason why we have a significant drop in EBITDA margin this year, despite near record-level sales.\"\nAlthough some sale positions were cut Wednesday before the announcement, most layoffs will take place Sept. 12 and Sept. 13, Hill stated in the email.\nKimray also had layoffs in 2016 Cody Cox, vice president of field operations at the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission, said he had not received any WARN notices from the energy firm regarding layoffs this week. Kimray layoffs do not warrant a mandatory WARN notice, however. Notices are only mandatory when staff cuts equal or exceed 33% of a company's total workforce, though companies are free to report workforce reductions at any size.\n\"We are committed to helping our people through this transition with at least three months of wages and benefits,” said Kimray President Bob Cole in the release. “We will also provide job placement and counseling services to help them find new employment.”\nA unpredictable oil and gas market and the pandemic led to Kimray layoffs in 2016, affecting the same amount of workers facing job losses now. However, since then the company seemed to be recovering, acquiring Texas-based company Control Equipment Inc. (CEI) in 2021. That same year, the Oklahoma Department of Commerce showed the company added around 100 new jobs to its Oklahoma locations to meet growing product demand.\nKimray launched a new product last August called the Electric Actuator, designed to reduce emissions and automate control in oil and gas productions, a news release stated. It also released Gen 3 Liquid Level Controller, a solution for liquid dump applications, in 2023. Products sell online and at 10 stores across the nation with the majority located in Texas.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

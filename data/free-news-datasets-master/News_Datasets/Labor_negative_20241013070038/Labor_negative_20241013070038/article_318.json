    "text": "STORY: Boeing faces a major strike.\nSome 30,000 workers at its West Coast factories voted Thursday on a new pay deal, and on whether to walk out.\nUnions say 96% voted for a strike.\nThat set the stage for a stoppage to begin in early Friday.\nOne worker said Boeing had brought the problem on itself:\n\"It just feels like they're trying to put a little bit of pressure on us, and that's just not the way you want to act towards your employees. If you really want us to work for you and build a quality plane.\"\nIt's the first such stoppage at the aerospace giant since 2008, and it could hardly come at a worse time.\nBoeing was already struggling to increase output of its best-selling 737 MAX jet, following a midair blowout on one of the type earlier in the year.\nThat incident put the firm's quality control under renewed scrutiny from watchdogs, coming after two fatal crashes of the jets some years earlier.\nThe pay deal offered to workers included a 25% increase, and a pledge to build Boeing's next commercial jet in the Seattle area.\nUnion leaders had recommended voting for the package, which the company said would guarantee jobs for generations to come.\nBut many workers responded angrily, arguing for the originally demanded 40% hike.\nSpeaking after the vote, International Association of Machinists President Jon Holden said Boeing would have to do better:\n\"Boeing has to stop breaking the law, has to bargain in good faith. And we will be back at the table whenever we can get there to drive forward on the issues that our members say are important. Congratulations, machinists.\"\nNow it all marks a big test for new chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who was brought in last month with a mission to restore faith in the firm.\nHe had sent a letter to workers urging them to support the pay deal, but to no avail.\nShare Â© Reuters - 2024",

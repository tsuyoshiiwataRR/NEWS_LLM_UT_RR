    "text": "A strike beginning Friday by more than 30,000 of Boeing’s West Coast factory workers will make it harder for the planemaker to meet a 737 MAX production target and stabilize its supply chain, CFO Brian West said Friday.\nWest also told the Morgan Stanley Laguna Conference he expects third-quarter margins from the company’s defense and space unit to be negative, similar to those in the second quarter.\nBoeing shares slid 4% on Friday.\n3 Boeing factory workers gather on a picket line during the first day of a strike near the entrance of a production facility in Renton, Wash. REUTERS Workers from Seattle and Portland, Oregon, who produce the MAX and other jets walked off the job after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract deal due to demands for higher pay.\nThe workers’ first strike since 2008 comes as Boeing is under heavy scrutiny from US regulators and customers after a door panel blew off a 737 MAX jet mid-flight in January.\nWest said Boeing had made progress toward ramping production of its strongest-selling jet back to 38 a month by year’s end, despite earlier skepticism from rating agencies over the target.\nExplore More JPMorgan, Bank of America to crack down on long hours after death of banker who worked 100 hours per week Kevin Hart’s vegan restaurant chain abruptly closes all locations just two years after opening Norfolk Southern CEO, top lawyer fired over romance shared hotels, cars on corporate trips: report “We’ve been making good progress on stabilizing production and preparing for that 38 per month by the end of the year. Now, obviously that’s going to take longer,” West said.\nWest, however, would not comment on specifics related to the target, which depends on the duration of the strike.\nThe strike is creating more uncertainty and concern for suppliers of parts and components for programs like the 737 MAX. Many were already having difficulty planning production due to Boeing’s repeated changes to internal forecasts for suppliers.\n3 “We’ve been making good progress on stabilizing production and preparing for that 38 per month by the end of the year.

Getty Images West said a company priority was stabilizing its supply chain, but that “objective just got harder.”\nWest suggested Boeing would stop taking parts from some suppliers on programs impacted by the strike where the planemaker has ample inventory.\nThe company’s 787 widebody jet is not impacted, as it is built in South Carolina by a non-unionized workforce.\nAsked about supply chain issues, West said for non-787 programs, if the supplier is not behind and the company has enough stock, “you know, don’t deliver anymore.”\nHe said this messaging is “happening overnight and as we speak.”",

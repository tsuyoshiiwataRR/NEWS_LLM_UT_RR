    "text": "The big story: When Florida lawmakers mandated post-tenure review for state university professors, many educators said the move marked the end of intellectual freedom on the 13 campuses.\nProponents of the idea, by contrast, said they wanted to get rid of the “dead weight” cost of unproductive faculty, in an effort to remake higher education.\nResults from the first year under the new paradigm are in.

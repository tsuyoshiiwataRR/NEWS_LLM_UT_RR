    "text": "Samsung factory strike in India continues after failed talks Despite government mediation, Samsung’s refusal to recognise the workers’ union has led to the ongoing strike at its key production facility in India. Samsung Electronics employees in India have [continued](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-state-minister-meet-samsung-officials-bid-resolve-strike-2024-09-12/) their strike for a fifth day after negotiations between the union, company management, and state government officials ended without agreement. The workers employed at a plant near Chennai are demanding higher wages, shorter working hours, and union recognition. The factory, which produces a range of appliances like televisions and refrigerators, plays a vital role in Samsung’s Indian operations, contributing up to 30% of the company’s $12 billion annual revenue in the country. Despite government efforts to mediate, including talks led by [Tamil Nadu](https://dig.watch/updates/tamil-nadu-secures-jabil-and-rockwell-automation-investment-deals)‘s labour minister, no resolution has been reached. Union leader E. Muthukumar stated that while Samsung management urged employees to halt the [strike](https://dig.watch/updates/samsung-workers-in-india-plant-begin-indefinite-strike), they refused to acknowledge the union, prompting workers to continue the protest. Hundreds of workers, clad in Samsung’s blue uniforms, have set up a makeshift camp outside the factory. Samsung [India](https://dig.watch/countries/india) has not commented on the latest developments but previously noted its commitment to addressing workers’ grievances and complying with local regulations.",

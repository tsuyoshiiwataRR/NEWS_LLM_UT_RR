    "text": "By Sharon Terlep\nSEATTLE-Boeing's (BA) biggest labor union overwhelmingly voted to strike, halting production of its best-selling jets and dealing the latest blow to the struggling aerospace giant.\nThousands of machinists that build Boeing's 737, 777 and 767 jets will walk off the job shortly after midnight Friday, after rejecting a labor deal struck between the union's leaders and Boeing's executives. The contract offered 25% wage increases over four years.\nWrite to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

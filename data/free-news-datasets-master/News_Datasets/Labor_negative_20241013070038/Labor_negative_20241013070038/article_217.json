    "text": "Topline Thousands of Boeing’s unionized factory workers voted to go on strike Thursday night, dealing a major blow to the plane maker which is already facing intense scrutiny over the safety of its aircraft.\nKey Facts Districts 751 and W24 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, representing around 33,000 Boeing factory workers, announced its members voted 94.6% to reject the company’s contract offer and 96% for a strike.\nThe union said the walkout will begin at midnight P.T.\nThe workers rejected a tentative deal from the company which offered 25% raises over four years and lower healthcare costs.\nAfter annoucing the result of the union vote, District 751 IAM President Jon Holden said : “This is about respect, this is about the past, and this is about fighting for our future.”\nHolden, who had previously urged the workers to accept Boeing’s offer , said the union’s leadership is prepared to get back to the negotiating table with the company and “try to resolve the issues and address what the members needs are.”\nForbes has reached out to Boeing for comment.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

Our goal is to get a strong contract that meets the needs of our members.”\nSiladitya Ray Following",

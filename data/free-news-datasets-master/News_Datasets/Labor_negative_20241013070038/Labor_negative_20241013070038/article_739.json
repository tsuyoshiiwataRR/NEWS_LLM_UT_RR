File photo by The Canadian Press/Darryl Dyck\nListen to article Air Canada says some operations will start to be affected today as time is running out before a potential shutdown because of a labour dispute with its pilots\nThe airline on Thursday called for the government to be ready to intervene to avoid major disruptions a shutdown would cause for its more than 110,000 travellers a day.\nIt says some services like cargo and vacation packages will start to be affected today, while a full shutdown could happen on Sept. 18.\nThe airline and pilots will be in a position starting Sunday to issue 72-hour notice of a strike or lockout. The airline has said the notice would trigger its three-day wind-down plan and start the clock on a full work stoppage.\nThe airline says the union is being inflexible with \"unreasonable wage demands.\"\nThe union has said that it is corporate greed that's holding up talks, as Air Canada continues to post record profits while expecting pilots to accept below-market compensation.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 13, 2024.\nCompanies in this story: (TSX:AC)\nSeptember 13th 2024",

    "text": "HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Nurses at Kapiolani Medical Center are preparing to strike after negotiations ended Thursday without a deal.\nA spokesperson for the Hawaii Nurses Association confirmed there was no solution reached between them and Kapiolani Medical Center administration.\nThis means hundreds of nurses will likely hit the picket line Friday as previously planned. Union members previously approved a one-day strike, starting at 7 a.m.\nThe hospital later responded by saying anyone who strikes will not be allowed back inside the facility until they accept the center’s latest contract offer.\nHNA has asked the National Labor Relations Board to block the lockout.\n”This is a sad day for Hawaii. Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children know they are the only specialty hospital for women and children and play a crucial role in our state and the Pacific. They know children and families count on their services, yet the hospital’s leaders have chosen to lock out the nurses for advocating for safe staffing standards to improve patient care,” HNA president Rosalee Agas-Yuu said in a statement.\nKapiolani nurses have been working without a contract since late last year. Part of their demands are increased staffing levels and better pay.\nThe hospital insist their offers and negotiations have been fair.\nThis is the second time this year nurses at the hospital will be striking.\nIn response to the strike, Kapiolani Medical Center issued the following statement:\n“We are extremely disappointed that the Hawai’i Nurses’ Association decided to end talks early, which will lead to a strike and lockout for our nurses. Our Kapi’olani negotiation team came prepared to stay as long as possible today to reach a deal that would immediately benefit our nurses. Unfortunately, after less than three hours, HNA ended negotiations for the day. We want to reassure everyone that Kapi’olani has secured a highly skilled temporary workforce and will be fully staffed in order to provide uninterrupted care.”\nThis story will be updated when new information becomes available.\nCopyright 2024 Hawaii News Now.

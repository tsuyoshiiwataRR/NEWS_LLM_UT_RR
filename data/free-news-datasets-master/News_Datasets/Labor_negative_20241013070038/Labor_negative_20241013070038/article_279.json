    "text": "Boeing workers voted on Thursday night to strike for higher pay, halting production of the planemaker’s strongest-selling jet as it wrestles with chronic output delays and mounting debt. Newly installed Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg pleaded with workers not to go on strike – the first since 2008 – ahead of the vote, saying the action would put the company’s “recovery in jeopardy”. – Guardian\nLow-paid migrant workers are an immediate drain on the public purse, costing taxpayers more than £150,000 each by the time they hit state pension age, according to the Government’s tax and spending watchdog. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the average low-earner who came to Britain aged 25 cost the Government more overall than they paid in from the moment they arrived. – Telegraph\nScotland’s last remaining oil refinery at Grangemouth is to close next year with the loss of 400 jobs, leaving the UK with only a handful of refineries and increasing the country’s reliance on imported fuel.

The company said it could “reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding, and maths”. – The Times",

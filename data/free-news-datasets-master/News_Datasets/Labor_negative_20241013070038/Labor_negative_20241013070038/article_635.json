    "text": "Boeing Faces Labor Strife: U.S. West Coast Workers Strike Boeing's factory workers on the U.S. West Coast have gone on strike after rejecting a new contract offer, stopping production of key aircraft models. The strike comes amidst an array of issues for Boeing, including regulatory scrutiny and financial strain. The company is seeking to renegotiate and quickly resolve the strike. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 13-09-2024 17:30 IST | Created: 13-09-2024 17:30 IST Boeing's factory workers on the U.S. West Coast walked off the job early Friday after rejecting a contract deal, halting production of its best-selling jets. The strike comes as Boeing grapples with major delays and debt, placing the company under increased scrutiny from U.S. regulators. The strike, the first since 2008, has adversely affected Boeing's stock, leading to a 4.6% drop in U.S. pre-market trading on Friday. New CEO Kelly Ortberg had proposed a 25% pay rise over four years, but this was far short of the workers' demand for a 40% increase. Approximately 30,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers overwhelmingly voted to strike. \"This is about respect, addressing the past, and fighting for our future,\" said Jon Holden, head union negotiator. A prolonged strike could exacerbate Boeing's financial woes and disrupt the airline industry, which relies on its aircraft. (With inputs from agencies.)

    "text": "The Pune Division of the Central Railway on Thursday issued a show cause notice to two contractors for failing to respond to authorities over the non-payment of salary to the cleaning staff and the denial of essential safety equipment. Shadab Jamal, Senior Divisional Mechanical Engineer (Sr. DME) at Pune Division, said the contractors were first issued a notice with a deadline of September 12. However, they missed the deadline. \"We have served a show cause notice to the contracting agency and they have to respond within seven days. The agency has submitted a complaint letter to us, demanding action against the workers, as the agency claims to be facing losses due to their strike.\" The strike by the workers started on Monday, September 9. They have decided not to clean the trains across all three washing centres of the Pune railway division. Meanwhile, the division has temporarily assigned workers from an alternate contracting agency to clean the trains. \"The fault lies with the contractors as they have not met the workers' minimum wage requirements. So how can the workers be expected to work? This has led to unrest and dissatisfaction among the cleaning staff,\" added Jamal. As previously stated regarding the termination of contractors who fail to meet deadlines, Jamal mentioned that according to the procedure, contractors are given a total of 14 days to respond. He said, \"The first seven days serve as a performance notice, followed by another seven-day notice.\" Attempts by The Indian Express to contact both contractors from the agency went unanswered.",

    "text": "\"Fewer migrant workers, but more complaints against employers,\"\nThe number of new migrant workers has plummeted to the lowest level since the border re-opened two years ago - but complaints against employers have soared to record levels.\nMore than 550 migrants, advocates or others laid complaints last month - which is more than double the average number this year - and brings the total since the border re-opened to 4300.\nThe Immigration Advisers Authority is actively investigating complaints against 24 licensed advisers...\n[Ex-INZ employee and detective, Cam Bower said \"Everything we see is industry related, or it's subcontractor related, and it goes hand in hand with all sorts of offending like money laundering, invoice writing schemes, deception, tax evasion.\n\"We're trying to get industry to respond and fight back, to make the supply chain safe and understand that it's not a race to the bottom and it's not the cheapest, because there's still people that are getting victimised, and generally one or two people getting extremely rich off it.\"\nMigrants may make a complaint to the Employment Relations Authority for lost wages or unfair dismissal, he said, only to find the company has gone bust, pointing to a \"ridiculously high\" amount of compensation ordered by the authority that goes unpaid...\n\"The different regulators don't have a victim response. INZ has nothing available, they do it themselves while trying to investigate. These victims are in a pretty horrible situation, and they don't have anyone, and they need constant monitoring and care and support and advice and everything else that goes with it.\"...\nWhen it comes to financial premiums paid by a migrant to agents or employers for a job - sometimes many thousands of dollars - [INZ's] investigations manager Jason Perry said it does not have the ability to recover that money...\nMeanwhile, changes to accredited employer work visa (AEWV) criteria, tightened immigration checks and a contracting job market appear to be having an effect on visa numbers...",

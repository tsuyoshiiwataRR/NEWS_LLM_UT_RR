    "text": "Bolton council and school support workers are to start voting on whether to take strike action over pay. Members of the public service trade union, Unison are to take part in a national ballot in a dispute over their pay.\nA ballot of Unison members has opened after the union said an offer of £1,290 from local government employers fell short of what council employees need.\nPhil Chanin, chair of Bolton Unison Branch said: \"Over the past 14 years, council and school workers have seen their pay fall further and further behind. Pay awards in local government have been worse than those in the private sector and the economy as a whole. Living costs have spiralled, yet pay in councils and schools has lost nearly a third of its value. We believe that now is the time for us to stand together for better pay\"\nPhil added: \"The joint trade unions, Unison, GMB and Unite submitted a joint pay claim to the local government employers for £3,000 or 10 per cent whichever is the greater.\n\"Their offer of just £1,290 came as a kick in teeth. We have a great many members who are low paid and struggle to cover the rent or the mortgage every week. It shouldn't be this…\nSaiqa Chaudhari",

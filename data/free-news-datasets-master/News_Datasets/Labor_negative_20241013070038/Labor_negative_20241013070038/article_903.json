    "text": "Boeing workers begin strike\nAbout 30,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, known as IAM, walked out on Friday after an\noverwhelming vote to reject Boeing’s latest contract proposal. About 96 percent of union members of IAM Districts 751 and W24 in the Seattle and Portland areas supported a strike, according to the union. IAM is one of the largest trade unions in the United States, representing around 600,000 active and retired members across several industries, including aerospace, railroad, defense, and automotive.\nWhat was Boeing’s offer? Boeing's\noffer included a 25 percent raise over the four-year contract, a reduced share of healthcare costs, and up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave. Members would also get a $3,000 ratification bonus, a reduction to mandatory overtime, and an increase to Boeing's payments into the union 401(k). Boeing also pledged that if the next Boeing plane program were launched within the life of the contract, it would build the program out of the Pacific Northwest.\nNegotiators bargained for everything they could without a strike, IAM District 751 President Jon Holden\nsaid when sharing the tentative deal with members on Monday. Union leadership recommends that members take the deal because more isn't guaranteed in a strike, he said, adding that he would support the union either way. However, union members continued holding out for the desired 40 percent raise over three years, with about 95 percent of IAM District 751 employees and W24 Machinists voting down the contract. The strike kicked off early Friday morning at 12:01 a.m., with members manning several picket sites, according to district leaders.\nWhat has Boeing said about the strike? Boeing clearly understands that IAM members found the negotiated deal unacceptable, Boeing told WORLD in an emailed statement. The company remains committed to renewing its relationship with union employees and is ready to restart negotiations for a new agreement, the statement continued.\nThe last Boeing strike took place in 2008 and lasted for eight weeks.\nDig deeper:\nRead Josh Schumacher’s report on Boeing appointing a new CEO after several turbulent years.\nIf you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism,\nclick here.\nAn actual newsletter worth subscribing to instead of just a collection of links. —Adam\n[Sign up to receive The Sift email newsletter each weekday morning for the latest headlines from WORLD’s breaking news team.](/the-sift)",

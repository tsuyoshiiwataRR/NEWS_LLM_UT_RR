    "text": "(WJAR) — A health center based in Rhode Island announced it is laying off 124 of its employees on Friday. Thundermist Health Center said the layoffs, which is a 14% reduction of its workforce, come after the board of directors terminated their contract with the former President and CEO Jeanne LaChance in early September. “This is an absolutely devastating decision to have to make and carry out. It is driven by a financial crisis that forces us to reduce costs by nearly $2 million a month, effective immediately,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The health center said its board appointed Maria Montanaro as the interim CEO this week. She was the president and CEO of Thundermist from 1997 to 2011, according to officials. Despite the layoffs, Thundermist said it will not be closing any of its locations and will not reduce its hours of operation. “Patients can continue to see providers and schedule appointments in Woonsocket, West Warwick, and South County,” officials said in a statement. According to Thundermist officials, more than 62,000 Rhode Islanders get primary care, behavioral health services, dental care, and social services from their health centers.",

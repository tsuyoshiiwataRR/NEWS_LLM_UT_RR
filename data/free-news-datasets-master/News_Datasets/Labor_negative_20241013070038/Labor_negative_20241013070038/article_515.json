    "text": "And also cooperate with competitors. Many manufacturers of office printing equipment are facing a decline in demand for their products, as humanity has realized the urgency of abandoning paper document flow during the pandemic. As noted by [Nikkei Asian Review](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Electronics/Ricoh-to-cut-2-000-jobs-globally-as-office-printer-demand-falls) Citing Japanese statistics, global shipments of printers and copiers fell by 26% to 3.59 million units between 2018 and 2023. Image source: Intel The Japanese company Ricoh is not doing so badly yet, but it has decided to prepare in advance for problems with the sale of printing devices. By March next year, it is going to cut about 3% of its global staff, which in absolute terms will be close to 2,000 people. About half of them work in Japan, the changes will affect mainly older employees, who will be offered early retirement. One-time costs associated with the reduction of Ricoh’s staff worldwide will reach $112 million, but in the next fiscal year the company will begin to save up to $64 million annually on current expenses. Ricoh and Toshiba formed a joint venture Etria in July, which will develop and manufacture printing equipment for corporate clients. About 8,400 employees will transfer to Etria from Ricoh; they will not be affected by future staff reductions. The layoffs will take place in the company’s divisions related to the production of office equipment, including sales and service specialists.",

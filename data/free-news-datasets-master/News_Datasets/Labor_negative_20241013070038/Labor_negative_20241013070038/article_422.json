    "text": "Amid escalating tensions in Punjab, the state power department employees have decided to extend their strike until September 17. The Joint Forum Punjab, Power Employees Unity Forum, and Junior Engineers Association are at loggerheads with the state government, accusing it of disregarding their demands and failing to take their grievances seriously. As a result, power supply issues are likely to persist, causing significant inconvenience to the public. Despite several meetings between the leaders of these organizations, including Power Minister Harbhajan Singh ETO and Power Secretary, no resolution has been reached. The leaders expressed frustration over the government's lack of commitment to address their concerns. They argued that while discussions have been ongoing, the Administration has failed to offer tangible solutions, instead only offering empty assurances. The core of the dispute revolved around demands for substantial changes, including the recognition of employees who lose their lives while on duty as martyrs and the provision of significant financial aid to their families. According to the union leaders, the government has been reluctant to meet these demands, reflecting a broader pattern of neglect towards the welfare of power employees. If the demands remain unmet, the power employees have threatened to continue a work-to-rule policy until September 30. This means that they will strictly adhere to their job descriptions without performing any additional tasks. In addition, all employees will proceed on mass leave until September 17, halting their work and potentially exacerbating power disruptions. The employees’ strike, which began with a pen-down and work stoppage over the past three days, has now escalated to a full-scale protest. The ongoing strike has meant that neither grievances will be addressed nor any official work conducted during this period. Consequently, the general public may face prolonged delays and inconveniences as they struggle with power outages and administrative bottlenecks. Adding to the situation, private sector power employees have pledged their support and are preparing to join the strike from September 13. They plan to organize protests, including demonstrations and gate rallies, culminating in a state-level protest in front of the Patiala headquarters on September 17. The leaders of the Punjab State Electricity Board Employees Joint Forum, Power Employees Unity Forum Punjab, and the Association of Junior Engineers, including prominent figures such as Ratan Singh Majari and Gurpreet Singh Gandhwind, have stated that while the government had promised to address their issues before the elections, it has since reneged on these commitments. Although some minor demands have been met, the major issues remain unresolved. The leaders criticized the government’s response as authoritarian and claimed that efforts are being made to undermine trade union rights and instill fear among employees. Reports indicated that unauthorized tasks are being assigned to employees and officials, including clerical and lower-grade staff, in an attempt to suppress the strike. Major Demands The power employees have outlined several key demands, including recognition of employees who die on duty as martyrs, with significant financial aid provided to their families; reduction in the promotion period from RTM to ALM for sub-station staff; provision of pay bands, security, and overtime for sub-station staff; reinstatement of allowances that were discontinued, effective from 2021; and assurance of third-scale promotions, filling of vacant positions, and a halt to recruitments from other states.",

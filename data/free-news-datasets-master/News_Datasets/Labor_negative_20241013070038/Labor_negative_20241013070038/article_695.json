    "text": "Microsoft’s recent decision to cut 650 jobs in its gaming division has sparked a wave of criticism from the Communications Workers Union (CWA). The organization, which previously supported Microsoft’s merger with Activision Blizzard, is now expressing deep disappointment with the tech giant’s actions. Microsoft to cut gaming staff by 650 CWA representatives stressed the paradox of the situation: one of the most profitable corporations in the world, which earned $88 billion last year, resorts to mass layoffs under the pretext of ensuring “long-term success.” Such a move, according to the union, runs counter to expectations from a company of such size and financial power. What makes the situation particularly bitter is that the CWA was instrumental in getting regulators to approve the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard deal. The union took this step after Microsoft entered into a union-neutrality agreement that paved the way for unionization at major gaming studios. Samuel Cooper, senior producer of World of Warcraft and a member of WoWGG-CWA, expressed solidarity with the fired colleagues. He called on workers in the gaming industry to join unions to protect their rights and interests. The CWA reminded that while union representation cannot always prevent layoffs, it can strengthen workers’ bargaining power with their employers. Despite its disappointment with Microsoft’s actions, the CWA said it remains committed to supporting the company’s workers in their quest for better working conditions. The union will continue to organize workers and protect their rights, especially in light of the increasing number of layoffs in the tech industry.",

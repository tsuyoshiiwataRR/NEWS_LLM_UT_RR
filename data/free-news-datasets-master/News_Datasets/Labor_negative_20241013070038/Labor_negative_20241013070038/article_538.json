    "text": "Boeing suffers fresh blow as 33,000 staff walk out over contract disputes The striking machinists assemble the 737 Max and the 767 cargo plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington. Aircraft assembly workers walked off the job early Friday at Boeing factories near [Seattle](/latest/seattle) and elsewhere after union members voted overwhelmingly to go on [strike](/latest/strikes) and reject a tentative contract that would have increased wages by 25 percent over four years. The strike started at 12:01 am PDT, less than three hours after the local branch of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers announced 94.6 percent of voting workers rejected the proposed contract and 96 percent approved the work stoppage, easily surpassing a two-thirds requirement. The labor action involves 33,000 Boeing machinists, most of them in [Washington](/latest/washington) state, and is expected to shut down production of the company’s [best-selling airline planes.](/news/world-news/144255/nasa-astronauts-return-space) [Stranded NASA astronaut in fear over 'horror show' noises](/news/space-news/147534/chris-hadfield-noise-starliner)[NASA leaves stranded astronauts in space until 2025 - with SpaceX Dragon return](/news/space-news/146799/nasa-astronauts-boeing-starliner-spacex-dragon-capsule) The strike will not affect commercial flights but represents another setback for the aerospace giant, whose reputation and finances have been battered by manufacturing problems and multiple federal [investigations this year.](/news/us-news/144050/safety-audit-of-southwest-airlines-investigation-Florida-Tampa) The striking machinists assemble the 737 Max, Boeing’s best-selling airliner, along with the 777, or \"triple-seven\" jet, and the 767 cargo plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington. The walkout likely will not stop production of [Boeing 787 Dreamliners](/news/space-news/142758/nasa-astronauts-stranded-iss-boeing-starliner-update), which are built by nonunion workers in [South Carolina](/latest/south-carolina). Outside the Renton factory, people stood with signs reading: \"Historic contract my ass\" and \"Have you seen the damn housing prices?\" Car horns honked and a boom box played songs such as Twisted Sister’s \"We’re Not Gonna Take It\" and [Taylor Swift](https://www.the-express.com/latest/taylor-swift)’s \"Look What You Made Me Do.\" The machinists make $75,608 per year on average, not counting overtime, and that would rise to $106,350 at the end of the four-year contract, according to Boeing. However, the deal fell short of the union’s initial demand for pay raises of 40% over three years. The union also wanted to restore traditional pensions that were axed a decade ago but settled for an increase in new Boeing contributions of up to $4,160 per worker to employee 401(k) retirement accounts. Under the rejected contract, workers would have received $3,000 lump sum payments and a reduced share of health care costs. Boeing also had met a key union demand by agreeing to build its next new plane in Washington state. Several workers said they considered the wage offer inadequate and were upset by a recent company decision to change the criteria on which annual bonuses are paid. Very little has gone [right for Boeing this year](/news/world-news/142623/boeing-accident-death-mechanic-sucked-into-engine), from a panel blowing out and leaving a gaping hole in one of its passenger jets in January to NASA leaving two astronauts in space rather than sending them home on a problem-plagued Boeing spacecraft. As long as the strike lasts, it will deprive the company of much-needed cash it gets from delivering new planes to airlines. That will be another [challenge for new Boeing](/news/us-news/142529/faa-emergency-inspection-boeing-737-planes) CEO Kelly Ortberg, who six weeks ago was given the job of turning around a company that has lost more than $25billion in the last six years and fallen behind European rival Airbus.",

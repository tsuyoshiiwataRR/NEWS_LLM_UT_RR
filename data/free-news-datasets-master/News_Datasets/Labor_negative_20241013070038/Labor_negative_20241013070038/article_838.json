    "text": "Workers at Kenya’s main airport have gone on strike against a takeover bid by India’s Adani Group.\nHundreds of employees at Kenya’s largest airport have walked off the job in protest against a proposed takeover by India’s Adani Group.\nFlights were grounded and passengers were left stranded due to a staff strike.\nWorkers at Nairobi’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) began a protest at midnight on Tuesday that continued until Wednesday. The protesters rejected plans to lease it for 30 years to the Adani Group in exchange for investment.\nThe government said the build-and-operate agreement with the Indian group includes the refurbishment of JKIA and the construction of an additional runway and terminal.\nThe Kenya Airport Workers Union, which is leading the strike and is the largest union representing Kenyan aviation workers, said the deal would lead to job cuts and worsening working conditions.\nAddressing airport workers, union leader Musa Nadima said the strike was ongoing, all shifts had been suspended and Adani must go.\nComments",

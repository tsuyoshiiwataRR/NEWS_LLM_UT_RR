    "text": "Top Biglaw Firm Closing 3 Offices, Laying Off Attorneys And Staff\nHoLove is shrinking.\nHogan Lovells, a firm that took in $2,682,000,000 gross revenue last year, making it 11th on the Am Law 100 ranking, is closing three of its offices. Yesterday, the firm confirmed that its Sydney, Australia; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Warsaw, Poland offices will be axed, but somehow insisted the move was not “economic driven.”\nHoLove CEO Miguel Zaldivar\ntold the American Lawyer, “We’re just following the market, the demand for our services at that high end, highly sophisticated level. It’s happening in other places. So I think it’s healthy for our organization to be honest with itself and see where the greatest opportunities are.”\nIn a statement, the firm said that it was a “difficult” decision but one that was “needed” to “achieve transformational growth and drive greater success” particularly in key markets both in the U.S. and abroad, including London, New York, California, Texas, Washington, D.C., among other international markets.\n“We’re not retrenching. We’re committed to servicing the G20 economies,” Zaldivar said.\nSponsored\n<a href=\"https://abovethelaw.com/2024/08/powerful-branding-strategies-and-marketing-tips-for-small-law-firms/\">\nPowerful Branding Strategies and Marketing Tips for Small Law Firms </a>\nOf course, this does mean layoffs. Approximately 65 attorneys, 11 of whom are partners, and 58 staff will be let go as the offices close their doors. Impacted employees were told the news by senior leadership in person over the last few days.\nDespite the cuts, Zaldivar said the firm does not anticipate a dip in its 2024 financials, “I can tell you in general terms that we have seen demand continue to grow. We are seeing revenue continue to grow. This management is quite responsible when it comes to the expense side of the equation. So we are optimistic about our performance, but I don’t have any projections.”\nIf your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

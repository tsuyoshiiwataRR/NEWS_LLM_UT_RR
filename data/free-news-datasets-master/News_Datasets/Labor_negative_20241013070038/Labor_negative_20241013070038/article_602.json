    "text": "'Hundreds of thousands of dollars' unaccounted for leads to TTU rodeo coach being fired Mateo Rosiles Lubbock Avalanche-Journal Nearly a week after firing its rodeo coach for alleged misconduct, Texas Tech's Davis College of Agriculture Sciences & Natural Resources released a statement explaining why.\nAccording to a letter written by the Davis College dean, Clint Krehbiel, former rodeo coach Jerrad Hofstetter was fired on Sept. 5 for reported financial and animal welfare mismanagement and failure to comply with university policies.\nHofstetter's termination came after an investigation by the Texas Tech University System on June 28 and by the Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee on Aug. 26.\nIn multiple media interviews and in a recent podcast , Hofstetter has denied wrongdoing. There has been an outpouring of support online and in the rodeo community coming to Hofstetter's defense - including a petition through change.org - with advocates stressing the success the rodeo team has seen under Hofstetter.\nThe A-J has reached out to Hofstetter for comment regarding the recently released letter from Tech, but has not heard back from him.\nHundreds of thousands of dollars unaccounted for The TTU System audit found that Hofstetter could not produce receipts for more than 300 transactions, resulting in \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" being unaccounted for from the Rodeo Program's accounts.\nNo specific number was given, and neither was the nature of the transactions that were unaccounted for. The A-J has submitted an Open Records Request to obtain more details about the alleged financial misconduct.\nFailure to take care of animals' welfare According to the letter, \"an IACUC investigation documented neglect and unacceptable management of cattle used by the Rodeo Program. Mr. Hofstetter also did not maintain the required health and death records.\"\nFailure to comply with Texas Tech University policies. The letter stated that Hofstetter disregarded university policies, including those related to animal care, financial management, and program administration, and was given \"multiple opportunities to address these issues, but he failed to do so.\"\nThe letter states that this failure to meet compliance forced the university to take \"decisive action\" to maintain the university's accreditations and compliance with funding agency requirements.\n\" This decision stems from an unwavering commitment to the integrity of our programs and the welfare of our students and animals. At Texas Tech University, we prioritize the safety and well-being of our Rodeo students and livestock and require financial accountability ,\" reads the letter.\nThe future of the program remains uncertain In closing, the letter stated the college \"remains steadfast\" in its recent investment in the program's success through increased funding in the equestrian program's operations and facilities. It also will honor all \"university-awarded Rodeo Program scholarships.\"\n\"We recognize this is a difficult time for our Rodeo community. Please contact my office at daviscollege@ttu.edu with any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you and ensure the program’s continued success,\" the letter reads.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

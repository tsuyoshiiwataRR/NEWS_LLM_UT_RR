    "text": "FMCSA’s [Drug & Alcohol Clearinghouse, first implemented in 2020](https://www.fleetowner.com/news/article/21129887/fmcsa-wants-to-make-it-simpler-for-states-to-ban-drug-and-alcohol-violators), is now a working federal database for drivers who have violated federal drug and alcohol testing requirements. Clearinghouse data is limited to only a few years, heavily disrupted by an unusual freight cycle since the pandemic. However, positive tests in recent years are declining. Overall drug violations are trending down over the last two years. The number of [drug violations in the Drug & Alcohol Clearinghouse](https://clearinghouse.fmcsa.dot.gov/Learn#news-events) fell since 2022, when drug violations peaked at 57,508. In 2023, violations dipped to 54,159. As of the Clearinghouse’s June 2024 report, violations to date reached 25,434—well below 2023’s midyear report total of 28,145 and 2022’s midyear total of 29,065. Clearinghouse’s findings specifically for tests detecting marijuana metabolites shows a similar trend. Positive marijuana tests through Clearinghouse are down roughly 10% year over year. The 2022 June report found 20,896 positive tests for marijuana, 2023’s midyear report found 19,378 positive tests for marijuana, and 2024’s report fell to 17,390. However, Clearinghouse in 2024 still found more positive marijuana tests than in 2021, which encountered 15,800 positive marijuana tests from January to June. On the other hand, ATRI’s 2023 survey of 238 motor carriers suggests that positive pre-employment tests and walk-outs have risen. When asked if respondents noticed an increase in positive pre-employment tests or walk-outs in the past five years, 60.1% said ‘yes.’",

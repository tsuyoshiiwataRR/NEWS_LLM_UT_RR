    "text": "By Reuters ,\n2 hours ago\nA strike beginning Friday by more than 30,000 of Boeing’s West Coast factory workers will make it harder for the planemaker to meet a 737 MAX production target and stabilize its supply chain, CFO Brian West said Friday.\nWest also told the Morgan Stanley Laguna Conference he expects third-quarter margins from the company’s defense and space unit to be negative, similar to those in the second quarter.\nBoeing shares slid 4% on Friday.\nWorkers from Seattle and Portland, Oregon, who produce the MAX and other jets walked off the job after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract deal due to demands for higher pay.\nStranded Boeing Starliner astronauts to phone home Friday about ongoing space plight\nThe workers’ first strike since 2008 comes as Boeing is under heavy scrutiny from US regulators and customers after a door panel blew off a 737 MAX jet mid-flight in January.\nWest said Boeing had made progress toward ramping production of its strongest-selling jet back to 38 a month by year’s end, despite earlier skepticism from rating agencies over the target.\n“We’ve been making good progress on stabilizing production and preparing for that 38 per month by the end of the year. Now, obviously that’s going to take longer,” West said.\nBoeing West Coast factory workers going on strike after 96% vote for walkout\nWest, however, would not comment on specifics related to the target, which depends on the duration of the strike.\nThe strike is creating more uncertainty and concern for suppliers of parts and components for programs like the 737 MAX. Many were already having difficulty planning production due to Boeing’s repeated changes to internal forecasts for suppliers.\n“We’ve been making good progress on stabilizing production and preparing for that 38 per month by the end of the year.

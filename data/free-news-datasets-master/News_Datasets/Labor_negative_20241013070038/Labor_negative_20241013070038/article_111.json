    "text": "McLaren Bay Region workforce ‘affected’ due to service consolidation BAY CO., Mich. (WNEM) – McLaren Bay Region said it made a decision to consolidate some services and team members, which has affected its workforce. The hospital said, after careful consideration, it decided to consolidate its endoscopy services and team members. The Geriatric Psychiatry department has also been consolidated into the Adult Inpatient Behavioral Health Unit. “Our workforce has been affected, and every effort has been made to redeploy as many team members as possible,” McLaren Bay Region said in a statement to TV5. When asked, a representative for McLaren would not specify how many team members are affected. The hospital said it is not immune to the changes affecting the health care industry, including supply and labor costs, unfavorable reimbursement environments, and declines in service line use and patient admissions. McLaren said these consolidations have enhanced the hospital’s ability to operate more efficiently while continuing to serve the community. You can read McLaren’s full statement below: McLaren Bay Region has not been immune to the transformational changes affecting the global health care industry over the past several years including unprecedented supply and labor costs, unfavorable reimbursement environment, as well as declines in service line use and patient admissions. Though, with the efficient utilization of staff and optimization of resources, the communities McLaren Bay Region serves will continue to benefit from a wide array of health care services offered. Following careful consideration, the decision was made to consolidate endoscopy services and team members to within the hospital. Additionally, the dedicated Geriatric Psychiatry department has been consolidated into the Adult Inpatient Behavioral Health Unit, where patients will still receive specialized care.Our workforce has been affected, and every effort has been made to redeploy as many team members as possible. McLaren Bay Region’s commitment to providing high-quality, lifesaving health care to the community remains in full force, and with these rightsizing efforts, we have enhanced our ability to operate more efficiently and continue to support the communities we are privileged to serve. Hailey Olsick, the president of the RN union at McLaren Bay Hospital, issued the following statement: “SEIU leadership has been working with McLaren administrators to limit layoffs, maintain safe staffing levels, and provide high quality care. Unfortunately, several of our nurses were impacted by the layoffs. We want the community to know that if they come to McLaren Bay, they will continue to receive the same high quality standard of care. Our nurses strive hard every day to ensure that the needs of our community come first.” The union said it is unclear how many nurses are impacted as it is an ongoing issue.

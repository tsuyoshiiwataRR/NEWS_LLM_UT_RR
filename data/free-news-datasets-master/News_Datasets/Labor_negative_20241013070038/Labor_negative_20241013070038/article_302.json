    "text": "Mass exodus: Entire 25-person team resigns from game publisher Annapurna Interactive after dispute with owner The entire design team at the beloved game publisher Annapurna Interactive, have resigned after some unresolved dispute with the owner of the company. Listen to Story In Short - Entire Annapurna Interactive staff resigns after dispute with owner - President Nathan Gary led the resignation wave - Company assures support for current projects The entire staff of 25 employees at the beloved game publisher Annapurna Interactive have resigned from the company after a dispute with the owner of the company, Megan Ellison. Annapurna Interactive President Nathan Gary, along with his executive team, had been in talks with Ellison to separate the video-game division into a standalone company. However, when Ellison abruptly withdrew from the negotiations, Gary and several top executives resigned in protest, prompting nearly 20 additional staff members to follow suit, creating a dramatic wave of departures. Annapurna Interactive is behind some popular games like Stray, Solar Ash, and Neon White. “All 25 members of the Annapurna Interactive team collectively resigned,’’ Gary said in a statement, as per Bloomberg. “This was one of the hardest decisions we have ever had to make and we did not take this action lightly.” Nathan Gary, the former president of Annapurna Interactive, resigned on September 6, as initially reported by The Hollywood Reporter. At that time, the larger staff exodus had reportedly not yet occurred. Meanwhile, as per Bloomberg, the owner of the company has also responded, saying: \"Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition. We’re committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theatre.\" The sudden departure of key staff at Annapurna Interactive has thrown the company into turmoil, leaving game developers in disarray as they scramble to determine the fate of their projects. Developers are frantically seeking new contacts and clarity on whether the publisher will honour its existing agreements. However, as per a report by Variety, a spokesperson at the company has assured that all current games and projects will remain under Annapurna’s care. Newly appointed president Hector Sanchez, who returned to the company last month, has reportedly reassured developers that contracts will be upheld and that replacements for the departing staff will be found. Founded in 2016, Annapurna Interactive has earned a stellar reputation for publishing award-winning indie titles like Outer Wilds, Stray, and Cocoon. Just last month, the company announced a significant partnership with Remedy Entertainment to adapt popular franchises Control and Alan Wake into film and television projects. Despite the upheaval, Annapurna’s legacy in the gaming world remains strong, though its future trajectory is now under scrutiny.",

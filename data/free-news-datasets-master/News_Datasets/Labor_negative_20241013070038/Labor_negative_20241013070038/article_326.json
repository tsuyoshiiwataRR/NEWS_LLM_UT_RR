    "text": "Microsoft said it is cutting 650 jobs in its Xbox unit, the third such layoff this year as the company tries to rein in costs and integrate its $69 billion (roughly Rs. 5,79,115 crore) acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday. The gaming industry saw mass layoffs, studio shutdowns and project cancellations in the first half of the year, triggered by a slow recovery in spending by gamers after player engagement rates peaked during the pandemic. The job cuts will affect mostly corporate and supporting functions, the report said, citing a memo sent to staff by Xbox ;chief Phil Spencer.Realme P2 Pro 5G Price, Colours and Features Teased Ahead of India Launch No games, devices or experiences are being canceled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments, the report said, citing the memo.

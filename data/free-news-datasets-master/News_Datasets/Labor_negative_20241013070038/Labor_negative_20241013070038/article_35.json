Law360 Union Walks Out After Workforce Decimation Just after midnight on Tuesday, about 250 editorial workers at the LexisNexis-owned Law360, represented by The NewsGuild of New York-CWA Local 31003, embarked on an open-ended strike over unfair bargaining tactics and the company’s refusal to offer fair pay and healthcare. The strike comes ahead of one of the busiest times for Law360 staff: the start of the U.S. Supreme Court session in October. Earlier this year, Law360 management laid off 10 percent of its Guild-represented newsroom staff in violation of U.S. labor law, hours after LexisNexis officials congratulated themselves on earning record revenue in 2023. The NewsGuild of New York is challenging the layoffs before the National Labor Relations Board as a violation of the company’s obligation to maintain the status quo of the expired collective bargaining agreement. “Law360’s value as a news operation and as a company comes directly from our work,” said Hailey Konnath, a reporter for Law360 and unit chair for the union. “Management wants us to agree to essentially earning less. It’s unacceptable and makes clear that management doesn’t really want to reach a deal on this contract.” Members launched a strike publication, “Outlaw360,” at [law360guild.org](https://www.law360guild.org/).",

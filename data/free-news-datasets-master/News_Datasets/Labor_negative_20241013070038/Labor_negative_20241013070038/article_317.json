    "text": "Despite their crucial role in saving lives, Uganda's nurses and midwives are grappling with severe challenges, including long hours, minimal pay, and a lack of support.\nMany healthcare workers feel physically and emotionally exhausted as they continue to perform beyond their training to meet the demands of an overstretched healthcare system.\"We are awake day and night, fighting to save lives, yet we are not rewarded for the sacrifices we make,\" said Joan Mugabi , Vice Chairperson of the Uganda Nurses and Midwives Union (UNMU).With grueling shifts and little rest, nurses and midwives are feeling overwhelmed and frustrated by the lack of recognition and support from the government.\nThe situation is exacerbated by delayed deployment for nursing and midwifery graduates, with many remaining unemployed for years.\n\"Those who finished in 2003 are still in their homes. Kindly hear us out and put them on the list,\" Mugabi urged, highlighting the plight of thousands of qualified nurses left without jobs despite an urgent need for healthcare professionals.\nAdding to the discontent is the government's focus on recruiting enrolled certificate-level nurses, while those with bachelor's and master's degrees are often overlooked.\n\"The government must employ all nurses,\" demanded Annet Birungi, General Secretary of UNMU, pointing to the lack of career progression opportunities and inadequate working conditions that are driving dissatisfaction in the sector.\nWhile President Museveni's recent scholarship initiative for 18 nursing students was welcomed, it has been criticized as insufficient to meet the sector's growing needs.\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\nTop Headlines Uganda Business Governance Submit By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy .\nSuccess!

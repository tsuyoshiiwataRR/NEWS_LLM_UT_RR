    "text": "Fewer than half (44 per cent) of UK workers have discussed flexible working arrangements with their managers, despite having the right to do so, a report has found. According to the survey of 1,200 UK workers, conducted by Phoenix Insights, this figure has increased by five percentage points since February 2024, when 39 per cent reported conversations with their boss about flexible working. The figures come despite the [Employment Relations (Flexible Working Act)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2023/1328/pdfs/uksi_20231328_en.pdf?mc_cid=8ad68b89c0&mc_eid=c8247d5eac), which came into effect on 6 April, allowing employees the right to request flexible working arrangements from day one of employment, as well as the opportunity to make two requests within a 12-month period, an increase from the previous limit of one. [Flexible working more important to most employees than a pay rise – People Management poll](https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1861233/flexible-working-important-employees-pay-rise-%E2%80%93-people-management-poll) [Employees value flexible working over wellbeing perks, survey finds](https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1888030/employees-value-flexible-working-wellbeing-perks-survey-finds) [New flexible working laws: an employer’s guide](https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1856168/new-flexible-working-laws-employers-guide) Clare Kelliher, professor of work and organisation at Cranfield School of Management, told People Management: “There is plenty of evidence to show that having some degree of choice over their working arrangements is popular with employees, so this is unlikely just to be a lack of interest. “It may be that there is a lack of awareness of the changes to the law, or that the flexible working arrangement on offer – perhaps as outlined in the policy – are not well-matched to the type of flexibility that employees are looking for.” However, she said what would be more concerning was if employees were not initiating discussions because they believe that a request is unlikely to be successful, or because they believe that there is a “flexibility stigma” that may reflect negatively on them, such as being seen to be less committed to their job. Kelliher suggested organisations can make sure managers are proactive in bringing up flexible work arrangements with their teams by making sure they have a thorough understanding of the recent legal changes, and can assist managers in realising the true benefits that come with allowing employees to work flexibly, offering support to help them execute it successfully. The survey also discovered that, when looking specifically at workers by age group, people over the age of 55 were the least likely to say their boss had discussed flexible working before the legal ability to request it was introduced, with only 24 per cent confirming this. In contrast, more than half (54 per cent) of 18-34 year olds said their supervisor had discussed flexible working with them by August 2024, as did 46 per cent of 35-54 year olds. Previous research by the company indicated that choices for flexible working grow increasingly important to employees as they age, with 73 per cent of over 55s prioritising flexible working hours in their workplace, compared to 57 per cent of 18-34 year olds and 60 per cent of 35-54 year olds. A further three quarters (74 per cent) of workers are confident in discussing flexible working arrangements with their manager, up from 67 per cent before the right was legalised. However, just 36 per cent are extremely confident. Sara Thompson, group HR director at Phoenix Group, said it is “encouraging” to see an increase in the visibility of flexible work arrangements since the introduction of the right to request them earlier this year, with more people discussing these options with their managers and feeling comfortable doing so. However, she acknowledged that the impact has not been as \"significant as it might have been\". “There are still far too many people who are not having these conversations in their workplaces, particularly among the over 50s age group, and who do not feel comfortable engaging in them, potentially harming their ability to remain and thrive in good work,” Thompson said. She added: “The right to request flexible working, although a positive step, is not enough by itself - employers must go further to make sure employees are fully aware of their rights and offer as much flexibility in working arrangements as they can”. Cath Sermon, head of public engagement and campaigns at Phoenix Insights, said that flexible working can be a \"game changer\" for employees, allowing them to balance work with care obligations or better manage their physical and mental health, particularly for those over the age of 50. “However, we know that making flexible work operate in practice needs planning, trust and good conversation between manager and employees. “The concept of the eight-hour working day is over 200 years old so now is the time for employers and managers to be more imaginative about how to flex requirements and ensure that the legislative changes make a meaningful difference to their employees,” she said. As a result, Sermon believes it is \"crucial\" for employers to do more to equip and support these vital talks, as well as to share best practices from across their business, in order to help \"normalise and empower\" people to stay at work for longer periods of time. In addition, Lucy Cobb, advice operations manager at BrightHR, said: “Employers aren’t strictly required to start conversations about flexible working with their employees. But once an employee makes a request, the employer must consider it according to both the law and The Code of Practice. “It’s really up to the employee if they want to ask for flexible working arrangements. Some companies, though, go the extra mile by promoting flexible working options during recruitment and to current staff.” However, she added that while business owners don’t have to bring up flexible working proactively, they can’t ignore a request once it’s made. “There are specific rules they need to follow according to the law and the Code of Practice. Ignoring these requests could land them in legal hot water.” [Read the CIPD guide to making flexible working a success in your organisation](https://www.cipd.org/en/knowledge/tools/journey-planner/)",

    "text": "Maritime workers under the aegis of the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN), have expressed disappointment over the continuous delay in the renewal of concession agreement of the terminal operators at the nation’s seaports. President, MWUN, Adewale Adeyanju, who made this known at the 2024 Dockworkers’ Day organised by the Shipping Correspondents Association of Nigeria (SCAN), in collaboration with the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN), in Lagos, said the workers were determined to see the signing of the licenses which had been long overdue. He appealed to the federal government to ensure that the agreements were signed as soon as possible, as this was currently impacting on operations at the seaports. Adeyanju said: “We want to see the renewal of the licenses of terminal operators. There are a lot of dividends that we are getting from giving us responsible terminal operators. Why are you delaying the signing of their agreements? The workers are now warming up, because they are worried about what is happening to their employees.”",

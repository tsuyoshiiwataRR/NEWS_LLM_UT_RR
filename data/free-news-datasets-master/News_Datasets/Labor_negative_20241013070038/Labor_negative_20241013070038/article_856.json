    "text": "The search for a new quarterback began late last night for the [Miami Dolphins](https://www.gulflive.com/dolphins/), hours after quarterback Tua Tagovailoa went down with a [concussion](https://www.gulflive.com/dolphins/2024/09/bad-night-turns-worse-for-the-dolphins-tagovailoa-sustains-head-injury.html) in a loss against the Buffalo Bills. Head coach Mike McDaniel avoided commenting on Tagovailoa’s timeline to return in his post-game news conference. Given his history of head injuries, the Dolphins quarterback will have a decision to make on whether he wants to [return to the game](https://www.gulflive.com/dolphins/2024/09/mike-mcdaniel-addresses-chance-of-tua-tagovailoas-retirement-post-concussion.html) and jeopardize his health. Regardless of his decision, Miami will be without their starting quarterback in the near future. Second-string signal-caller Skylar Thompson entered the game late in the third quarter and completed eight-of-14 passes for 80 yards While Tagovailoa battled a series of concussions in 2022, Thompson played in seven games and completed 60 passes for 534 yards, a touchdown, and three interceptions. McDaniel addressed Miami’s outlook on Friday, including bringing in a veteran quarterback. “I think the way to best articulate where we’re at, the team and organization are very confident in Skylar (Thompson). There’s a reason he was our backup quarterback. That being said, we will bring in someone. We’re just evaluating the pros and cons for the different situations and getting through all those possibilities,” McDaniel [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BexaddwyUEE). Ironically, [Ryan Tannehill](https://www.gulflive.com/dolphins/2024/08/dolphins-fans-call-for-ryan-tannehill-after-lackluster-preseason-qb-play.html) is the top available free agent quarterback. Tannehill was drafted by the Dolphins with the No. 8 overall pick in the 2012 draft. He still holds a spot in Miami’s record books with the fourth-most passing yards (20,434) in franchise history. Jimmy Garoppolo is another option. Garoppolo led the San Francisco 49ers’ offense from 2017 through 2022 when he suffered a season-ending injury. The veteran has an impressive 5-2 playoff record and operated well under Kyle Shanahan’s system. McDaniel and Garoppolo’s stints in San Francisco overlapped, meaning the two could cut the small talk and get straight to work.",

    "text": "It is with deep sorrow and heavy hearts that we announce the tragic passing of our brother and colleague, Austin Raysby. Brother Raysby, a valued member of SMART-TD Local 528 in Chicago who worked as a conductor for Union Pacific, was tragically killed while on duty Sept. 4. Brother Raysby joined SMART-TD in 2012. Known throughout the crew room for his infectious positivity and fun-loving nature, he brought a lightness and camaraderie that was cherished by all who worked alongside him. His spirit and enthusiasm made him a true friend to his brothers and sisters at UP. Members of Local 528 knew Austin as a solid railroader and a genuinely good person who was always willing to lend a helping hand and share a laugh. His presence and energy will be deeply missed by all who had the honor of working with him. As our brothers and sisters in Local 528 know, Austin’s presence made a bad day seem tolerable. Every crew base has one guy who everyone loves to see in the crew room. Brother Raysby was that guy. When you had a bad round trip, and all you wanted to do was mark off your ticket and go home, if you saw Austin, you couldn’t help but talk to him for a few minutes. And somehow, you left work feeling that everything made sense and was okay. In addition to his work family in Local 528, Austin is survived by his loving parents, three siblings, and numerous nieces and nephews, all of whom will remember him for his warmth and kindness. During this profoundly difficult time, the entire SMART-TD community extends its condolences and prayers to his family, friends, and his union family in Local 528. In honor of Brother Raysby, SMART-TD has established a GoFundMe fundraiser to assist his family with his final expenses. [Donations can be made to support them through this challenging period.](https://www.gofundme.com/f/honor-austin-raysby-help-with-final-expenses?qid=eebb5798042b8fda3a4ab37b8fa466d5) A memorial service to celebrate Austin’s life will be held on Sept. 19 from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. at Strang Funeral Chapel & Crematorium, 410 E. Belvidere Road, Grayslake, Ill. All who knew him are invited to attend and pay their respects.

    "text": "2024-09-13 03:26:06\nGiven the deadlock in negotiations on higher wages and better working conditions for doctors, the union is now increasing the pressure.\nAs part of the collective bargaining for around 60,000 doctors at municipal hospitals, the Marburger Bund union is calling for a nationwide warning strike on Monday. The one-day strike is expected to bring movement to the negotiations, the Marburger Bund announced in Berlin. A central strike demonstration will take place in Frankfurt am Main.\nThe union is demanding, among other things, 8.5 percent more money per year and a reform of the shift work regulation. After two unsuccessful negotiations with the Association of Municipal Employers’ Associations (VKA), there is great dissatisfaction among doctors, the Marburg Association reported. The warning strike comes shortly before the next round of negotiations on Tuesday.\nAccording to the information, the collective agreement applies to municipal hospitals with the exception of the Vivantes clinics in Berlin and clinics with internal collective agreements. According to the union, emergency services will be agreed with the clinics present on site during the strike period.",

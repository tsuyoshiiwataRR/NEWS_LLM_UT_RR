    "text": "Grangemouth refinery will cease production next year, with around 400 jobs expected to be lost. The closure of the facility at Grangemouth comes despite Project Willow, a study funded by the UK and Scottish governments looking at ways to secure a future for the site.\nMinisters have urged the company to keep \"refining open for as long as possible\".\nREAD MORE\nIn a statement, Frank Demay, Chief Executive Officer at Petroineos Refining, said: \"The energy transition is happening now and it is happening here.\n\"Demand for key fuels we produce at Grangemouth has already started to decline and, with a ban on new petrol and diesel cars due to come into force within the next decade, we foresee that the market for those fuels will shrink further.\n\"That reality, aligned with the cost of maintaining a refinery built half a century ago, means we are exploring ways to adapt our business.\"\nThe company first announced plans to close the refinery last November, with the site turned into a finished fuels import terminal and distribution hub.\nHowever, this \"requires significantly fewer people to operate\".\nThe company will enter a formal redundancy process with unions.\nThey say they expect the transformation to \"lead to a net reduction of approximately 400 roles over the next two years\".\nMr Demay, said: \"Unfortunately, a terminal would require only around one-fifth of the current refinery workforce.\n\"Therefore we will soon enter an information and consultation process with representatives of our employees to discuss the proposals.\n\"We have already agreed to move from the UK statutory minimum redundancy terms to an 18-month package and if plans proceed we intend to do everything we can to reduce the impact on our people.\n\"We will of course be seeking to minimise compulsory redundancies as far as possible.\"\nShortly after the news of the closure, the UK and Scottish governments unveiled a \"three-point plan for a just transition for the workforce and community\".\n(Image: Chris Watt Photography)\nThe package includes £20m of new joint funding from the UK and Scottish…\nAndrew Learmonth",

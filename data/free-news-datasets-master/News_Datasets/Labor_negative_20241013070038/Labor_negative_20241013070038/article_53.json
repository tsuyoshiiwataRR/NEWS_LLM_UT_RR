    "text": "The last 50 years have brought an unprecedented amount of technology and reform to the way we do business. Those writing Science Fiction around that time might have predicted that we'd either be living in a utopia where we no longer needed to work to live or we'd be living in a dystopian world where few oligarchs, like the fictional Eldon Tyrell, hoarded wealth from the masses like dragons sitting on a pile of gold, while many struggled just to survive in a world of decaying infrastructure amidst technology that should be making their life better only leading to further hardship. I'll leave you to figure out which of those is closer to the current present. But the point stands that you might expect that this technology, automation, and artificial intelligence would be leading us somewhere. But the relief that would come from making our jobs easier by cutting down on monotonous and replicable tasks is overshadowed by the ever-present reality that your job will be gone as soon as automation can do as much as 25% of what you're doing for free. Despite what the tech industry would lead us to believe is an exciting development in technology, the sector is cutting jobs by the thousands—still while posting record profits. It's brutally ironic in the sense that the industry leading the charge is also leading in kicking employees to the curb. Meanwhile, the rest of us can't escape having existing features that are being labeled as some form of \"intelligence\" shoved down our throats by project managers and executives who lack imagination. For any managers out there wondering whether they can earn themselves a sweet bonus by automating their team's work: you should probably take a look at your own work first and make sure that a short shell script couldn't easily replace what you're doing. In an excuse for me to rant about this pertinent topic, today we're sharing this classic and ever-relevant story that was originally shared with this popular online community by user \"lungbong\" who shared how their boss tried to automate their job, leading them to automate not just their boss's job but their boss's boss's job too—leading both to the firing of both.

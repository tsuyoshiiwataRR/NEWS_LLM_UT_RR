    "text": "By Jessica Clark\nUpdated: 22:01 BST, 12 September 2024\nTesco has lost a Supreme Court battle with the retail workers union over ‘fire and rehire’ plans.\nThe supermarket giant faced legal action by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) after it tried to sack distribution centre staff and rehire them on lower pay in 2021.\nAfter the High Court ruled in the union’s favour in 2022, the supermarket giant successfully appealed against the decision the same year.\nBut the Supreme Court yesterday ruled Tesco should be blocked from dismissing the staff.\nCourt fight: Tesco faced legal action by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) after it tried to sack distribution centre staff and rehire them on lower pay in 2021\nIt comes as Labour plots workers’ rights reforms that will ban fire and rehire policies and zero-hour contracts.\nIt is feared the new rules facing business – alongside the prospect of higher taxes – will put companies off hiring staff.\nThe row broke out after Tesco planned to close some distribution centres in 2007, offering staff a higher salary – which was known as ‘retained pay’ – for them to relocate.\nIn 2021, the grocer tried to end ‘retained pay’ and told staff they would remove it in return for a lump sum payment, or their contracts would be terminated and reoffered on the same terms at a lower salary.\nUsdaw argued that the higher salary was described as permanent in the contracts and could not be removed.\nTesco argued that it was using a ‘contractual mechanism’ open to employers.\nBut the Supreme Court judgment said was ‘inconceivable’ that ‘Tesco would retain a unilateral right to terminate the contracts of employees in order to bring retained pay to an end whenever it suited Tesco’s business purposes to do so’.\n‘That would have been viewed, objectively, as unrealistic and as flouting industrial common sense by both sides,’ it said.\nPaddy Lillis, Usdaw general secretary, said: ‘These tactics have no place in industrial relations, so we felt we had to act to protect those concerned.’\nTesco accepted the ruling, adding: ‘Today’s judgment relates to a dispute brought on behalf of a very small number of colleagues in our UK distribution network who receive a supplement to their pay.’\nThe ‘vast majority’ of distribution staff do not receive the top-up, it said.\n‘In 2021, we took the decision to phase it out. We made a competitive offer at that time and many of them chose to accept this.\n‘Our aim has always been to engage constructively with Usdaw and the small number of colleagues affected.’\nDIY INVESTING PLATFORMS AJ Bell AJ Bell Easy investing and ready-made portfolios\nHargreaves Lansdown Hargreaves Lansdown Free fund dealing and investment ideas\ninteractive investor interactive investor Flat-fee investing from £4.99 per month\nSaxo Saxo Get £200 back in trading fees\nTrading 212 Trading 212 Free dealing and no account fee\nAffiliate links: If you take out a product This is Money may earn a commission.

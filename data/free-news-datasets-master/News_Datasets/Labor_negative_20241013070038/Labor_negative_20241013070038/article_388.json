    "text": "Home News Photographie Vandercam Flights cancelled as staff at Charleroi Airport down tools again on Friday As was the case on Thursday all flights that were due to leave from or arrive at Charleroi Airport in Hainaut Province have been cancelled again today. Staff at the airport that is sometimes referred to as “Brussels South Charleroi Airport” are staging another 24-hour strike in protest at what they describe as a high workload and aggressive management style.\nFri 13 Sep 09:52\nManagement had hoped that some flights might have been able to take off or land.

The unions say that this has become insufferable due to many staff being absent on sick leave. The unions also say that the style of management at the airport is “aggressive”.\nThe unions had already issued a strike notice covering the period from Thursday 19 September. The strike notice covers all the key services at the airport such as baggage handling, check-in, etc...",

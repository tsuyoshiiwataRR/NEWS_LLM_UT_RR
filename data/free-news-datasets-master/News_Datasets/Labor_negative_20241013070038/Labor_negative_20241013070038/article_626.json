    "text": "Sept. 13 (UPI) -- More than 30,000 Boeing workers will go on strike starting Friday after turning down a tentative contract proposal hammered out by the company and union negotiators.\nMembers of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers voted 94.6% to reject the agreement, while 96% voted in favor of a strike. Advertisement\n\"We strike at midnight,\" IAM District 751 President Jon Holden said at a press conference on Thursday.\nThe strike will shut down aircraft assembly at Boeing plants in Seattle, with stoppages also expected in Portland, Ore., and California.

Boeing executives, though, claimed it was the best contract the company has ever offered a union.\nHolden called the stoppage an \"unfair labor practice strike,\" saying workers at the factories faced \"discriminatory conduct, coercive questioning, unlawful surveillance,\" adding that the union had received an \"unlawful promise of benefits.\" Advertisement\nBoeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who has been leading the company for less than two months, said a strike could hobble its recovery and called for the union to accept the deal.\n\"We have achieved everything we could in bargaining, short of a strike,\" Holden told members in a message before the voting. \"We recommended acceptance because we can't guarantee we can achieve more in a strike.\n\"But that is your decision to make and is a decision that we will protect and support, no matter what.\"",

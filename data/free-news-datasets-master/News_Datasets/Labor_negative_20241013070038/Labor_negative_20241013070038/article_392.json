    "text": "3 years ago I switched into a rotating day/night shift schedule for a increase in pay.\nThe days are long. I leave the house at 5 am and get home at 7 pm. I only do nights once a month but it is for a 7 night stretch.\nOver the last few years I have started to notice that I don't get as excited for my hobbies or hunting trips. For example packing for a long trip seems like a daunting challenge now and the effort involved is overwhelming. I remember years ago I packed weeks in advance just on pure excitement for the trip.\nSo I am wondering if this could be possible burn out from the job or just getting older and not enjoying the same things in life?\nI have never been a quitter and always ran with mindset of \"never quit\" \"tough it out other people work the same shift\"\nAlso has anyone took a reduction in pay for a better work to life balance and regretted it?\nThe days are long.

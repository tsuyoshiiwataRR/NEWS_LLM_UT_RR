    "text": "Boeing Workers Strike Threatens Production and Financial Stability Boeing faces significant challenges as over 30,000 workers strike, demanding better compensation and conditions. The strike, supported by 96% of union members, poses risks to production and finances. A prolonged strike could impact Boeing's ability to meet its production goals, affecting suppliers, airlines, and the company's overall financial stability. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 13-09-2024 22:56 IST | Created: 13-09-2024 22:56 IST Boeing is making urgent efforts to resume negotiations after more than 30,000 workers commenced a strike on Friday, seeking better compensation and working conditions. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers rejected Boeing's contract offer, with 94.6% voting against it and 96% supporting the strike. Boeing's Chief Financial Officer Brian West acknowledged concerns about the strike's impact on production and finances. Financial rating agencies Moody's, Fitch, and S&P Global Ratings have indicated that a prolonged strike could have severe operational and financial repercussions for Boeing, potentially leading to downgrades. With the company already facing a significant debt burden, the strike adds to its challenges. Union leader Jon Holden emphasized the workers' determination to fight for their future. The strike could affect suppliers, airlines, and the company's financial health. (With inputs from agencies.)",

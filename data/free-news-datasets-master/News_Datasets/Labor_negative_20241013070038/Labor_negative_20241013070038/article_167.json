The strike begins Friday, halting 737 MAX production. Despite a proposed contract offering wage hikes and bonuses, workers rejected it, demanding higher pay. CEO Kelly Ortberg and union leaders urged acceptance, but the strike proceeds. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 13-09-2024 10:15 IST | Created: 13-09-2024 10:15 IST Boeing's factory workers on the U.S. West Coast are set to strike after 96% voted in favor, which will halt the production of the 737 MAX. This significant move comes as Boeing battles production delays and increasing debt. The strike, starting just after midnight Pacific time on Friday, follows the recent appointment of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who was tasked with regaining trust in the planemaker following several setbacks. Approximately 30,000 workers involved in producing Boeing's jets in Seattle and Portland were casting ballots on their first full contract in 16 years. Despite a proposed contract including a 25% general wage increase, a $3,000 signing bonus, and a commitment to build Boeing's next commercial jet in Seattle, workers overwhelmingly rejected it, seeking a 40% pay rise and criticizing the loss of an annual bonus. Union rules required at least two-thirds of workers to approve strike action, and they did so overwhelmingly, despite leadership recommending acceptance. (With inputs from agencies.)

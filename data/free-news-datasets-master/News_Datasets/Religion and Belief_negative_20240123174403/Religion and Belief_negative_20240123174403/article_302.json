    "text": "Bob Katter has accused Qantas of being anti-Christian after claiming the national air carrier snubbed traditional Christmas carols inside of one of its prestigious business class lounges. In a written complaint against the airline, the independent MP said he was angered to hear no holiday music with faith-based messages while sitting in a Qantas Club during a flight delay. 'I noticed that throughout the two hours I was there, they were playing 'Xmas' music,' Mr Katter said. 'Two hours of the most un-Christmassy music I've ever heard. Bob Katter has accused Qantas of being anti-Christian after claiming the national air carrier snubbed traditional Christmas carols inside of one of its prestigious business class lounges 'Over 80 per cent of Australia's population are generational Australians, and they were brought up on Christmas Carols. 'It would seem then, that Qantas is anti-Christian.' According to the most recent census data, there has been a steady decline in the number of Australians who identify as Christian, with overall numbers dropping from 74 per cent in 1991 to 44 per cent in 2021. The same data found that while fewer people are identifying as Christian, the number of people claiming no religion has risen to 38 per cent in 2021, up from 30 per cent in 2016. In his pre-Christmas rant, Mr Katter, who represents the division of Kennedy in Queensland - went on to lash former Qantas CEO Alan Joyce. In a written complaint against the airline, the independent MP said he was angered to hear no holiday music with faith-based messages while sitting in a Qantas Club during a flight delay Mr Joyce quit in early September after the airline came under the spotlight over allegations of illegal ticket sales and poor service. 'As time goes on, more and more Christians will, I hope, become aware of your spite,' he wrote. 'So whilst Alan Joyce (Australia's most hated man?) may be gone, his 'spirit' clearly lives on. 'But one thing for sure - his spirit 'ain't' 'The Spirit of Australia'. Qantas has been contacted for comment.",

    "text": "(Minghui.org) Falun Dafa practitioners are willing to face persecution from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in order to save people’s souls by telling them the truth of Falun Dafa (also called Falun Gong). I wish to share several stories of people’s lives being changed for the better because they accepted the truth when a practitioner told them about the goodness of Falun Dafa. A Peasant Woman’s Fortunate Encounter with Dafa I am 72 years old and started practicing Falun Dafa in 2004. I grew up in a rural area and my health was very poor due to the hard work I faced daily. My first husband passed away early. My eldest son served in the army for three years, and was assigned to work in a small city. Seeing that my health was rapidly declining, he helped me move into the city to receive better medical treatment. He took me to the hospital, where I was diagnosed with cholecystitis, hepatomegaly, gastroptosis, osteoporosis, and low immunity. The doctor said that these ailments were all related to my digestive system. Therefore he did not recommend hospitalization, but gave me medicine to take at home, and told me the regimen I needed to follow. From then on, I took medicine every day, and I was not allowed to eat anything solid. I mostly ate porridge. I became thinner and thinner, as my weight dropped from 132 lbs to 79 lbs. At that time, I felt that I was not only suffering badly, but I was also hurting my family. I really did not want to live any longer. My fate took a turn just as I started to despair. I was introduced to a retired official, and we got married in 2004. One day, my husband’s colleague, a Falun Dafa practitioner, came to see us. She asked me if I knew about Falun Dafa, and I told her that I didn’t. She said, “Falun Dafa is so wonderful. It teaches people to become good people, and it also cures illnesses and is great for one’s health. I had many illnesses in the past and I recovered from all of them after I practiced Falun Dafa.” My eyes lit up, and I asked, “Really? Please tell me how to do the exercises!” She said, “I will give you a book tomorrow. You can read that first.” The next day, she brought me the book Zhuan Falun, the main book of Falun Dafa. When I turned to the first page, I saw Master’s photo [Master Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Dafa]. It felt as if I was seeing a long-lost relative, and tears covered my face. The second night after I began to read Zhuan Falun, I had diarrhea and spent the whole night in the bathroom. I also had a fever of 42 degrees. My husband’s colleague explained to me, “Master is taking care of you and cleansing your body.” I indeed felt that it was different this time, because when I had diarrhea in the past, I would be so weak and would have to stay in bed. But this time, I was still very energetic. I was very happy and also surprised. I had not even officially practiced Falun Dafa yet, and had only read a few pages of Zhuan Falun. However, Master was already taking care of me and cleansing my body, just as described in the book. My husband used to practice Dafa before the CCP launched its persecution in July 1999. But after the persecution began, all his Falun Dafa books were illegally confiscated, and he stopped practicing. He got sick again, and medical treatment didn’t help. We practiced the exercises together. At that time, I didn’t know what cultivation was. I was just grateful to Master for adjusting my health and giving me a new life. I then kept hearing a voice saying, “Think about it, everyone: What kind of matter is it to teach qigong toward high levels? Isn’t this offering salvation to humankind? Offering salvation to humankind means that you will be truly cultivating, and not just healing illnesses and keeping fit.” (Lecture One, [Zhuan Falun](https://en.falundafa.org/eng/zfl2014/zfl_2014_1.html)) I looked behind me and all around, but didn’t see anyone. Later on, I read this passage in Zhuan Falun, and only then did I realize that it was Master who was enlightening me. He was telling me that cultivation is not just about getting rid of illnesses and keeping fit. My husband is a chauvinist. He controlled all of our money, and would not give me any to spend, which made me very angry. But since I practiced Dafa, I could not argue with him or fight him. I was suffocated by anger inside, and I shed tears in bed under the covers at night. When I got up in the morning, I saw a big hand holding a brown wooden plate with a bowl of rice on it, and it was offered to me. I then heard Master’s voice, “You will be okay as long as you have something to eat.” I immediately cried. I knew that I made Master worry about me. From then on, I no longer cared about money and was happy every day. I Fell Down When I Was 70 I fell when riding my bicycle in the summer of 2021. I was on the ground and it took me a while to realize what had happened. I immediately thought to myself, “I’m okay,” and quickly got up. I pushed my bicycle and walked home. I then felt bad all over again and decided to lie in bed. The next day, I couldn’t get up. My whole body was numb and I couldn’t move. My three sons were frightened, fearing that I would became paralyzed. They insisted on taking me to the hospital for an examination. I told them, “I am a Dafa practitioner, and I will be fine. The hospital can’t cure my illness and it will be a waste of your money. You all know that I have been cultivating for so many years and my health has been very good. I was not careful and I fell. It may not be a bad thing for people to suffer a little. Don’t worry, I will be fine in a few days.” They left, but they were still worried. I knew the principle that one has to go through suffering in order to pay back one’s karmic debts, and so I just tried to bear the physical pain. By studying the [Fa], I found a lot of bad attachments and human notions, and tried to let go of them one after the other. I thought, “I am a cultivator. I have to be able to endure pain and hardship. I cannot stay in bed.” On the third day, I got out of bed to do the Dafa exercises. But my legs couldn’t hold my weight, so I leaned on the bed and did the exercises. I then held on to a bench to walk little by little. Within a few days, I was able to cook and eat by myself. My children again came to see me on Sunday, and one of my in-laws also came. As soon as they entered the room and saw me standing, they were amazed. They said, “Are you okay? We were all scared because you didn’t go for any medical treatment. How did you recover so quickly? Falun Dafa is truly miraculous!” The Young Man Did Not Want Me to Hang Up Over the past few years, I began to buy phone cards and call people to [clarify the truth] about Falun Dafa. One day, the call was picked up by a young man. After I said a few words, he said, “I have finally found you. You don’t need to say any more. I have listened to four such calls already and I understand everything. I am a CCP member. Please help me withdraw from the CCP.” I gave him a pseudonym, and he was very happy. I continued to tell him how to help his family members withdraw from the CCP and its youth organizations. He said, “Don’t hang up yet. I will get our manager and you can ask him to withdraw, too.” I heard him running to knock on a door and then he said, “Manager, come and hear this phone call! She will help you withdraw from the CCP and stay safe during catastrophes!” But his manager didn’t want to and told him to leave him alone. He came back to the phone and said to me, “Don’t hang up just yet. There is someone else.” Then he said to someone, “Ling, come out quickly and listen to the phone. Someone will help you stay safe and avoid catastrophes.” A girl came to the phone and I said to her, “You are so fortunate to have such a great co-worker. He wants you to be safe, too. What I’d like to tell you today is that many Chinese people are withdrawing from the CCP now, in order to stay away from catastrophes and be safe. This is because when you joined it, you made an oath to dedicate your life to the Party and fight for it for the rest of your life. After making such an oath, it means that your life belongs to the Party. Even if you forget about this oath, heaven will not forget it. When heaven destroys the CCP, the people who made the oath will suffer. If you now withdraw from the CCP, it will abolish this poisonous oath, and you will be free of this evil organization and receive blessings from the heavens. This is why we all have to withdraw from the CCP. Does that make sense?” “Yes,” she said, “I will withdraw from it. Thank you!” The young man also thanked me. I said, “There is no need to thank me. As Falun Dafa practitioners, it’s our wish that all sentient beings be saved. You should thank our Master, who is saving you.” They both said together, “Thank you, Falun Dafa’s Master!” Prisoners Recite the “Nine-Character Mantra” I was arrested and taken to a detention center for practicing Dafa in 2011. When I was first taken to the cell, someone told me in a low voice, “This cell’s lead is very fierce. She swears at and beats up people at will, and she forces Falun Gong practitioners to do all the dirty and tiring work. If they don’t finish the work on time, she will punish them. You have to be careful.” The cell lead was in her 30s and was being detained for selling drugs. She could come in and leave the cell as she pleased and ate whatever she wanted. But she looked very sad all day, because she had heard that she would be sentenced to 12 years. A few days later, she suddenly developed a high fever. She got some medical treatment but was not getting better. She couldn’t sleep much for two days and nights. I went to talk to her. “I have a method,” I said, “but it’s up to you to believe it or not. All you need to do is to silently recite the nine-character mantra, ‘Falun Dafa is good; Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good.’” She said she believed it. I then said, “You should also withdraw from the CCP organizations.” She said, “I joined the Young Pioneers and the Communist Youth League when I was young. My last name is Zhang. Help me withdraw from them.” I looked her in the eyes and said, “People who treat Dafa practitioners with kindness will be blessed; those who persecute Dafa practitioners will bring retribution to themselves.” She nodded. I said, “You can start reciting the nine-character mantra silently now.” She got up very early the next morning. She came to me and whispered, “Ma’am, I have recovered! It’s miraculous!” Then she left with a smile on her face. When she came back again, she brought two delicious dishes. Each had millet porridge, two eggs, a fried dough stick, and two stir-fried vegetables. She kept one dish and gave me one. In comparison, the food provided in the detention center was just steamed buns and frozen cabbage soup, with mud underneath the cabbage. From then on, she boiled a large pot of water every day and put it in front of me. She said to everyone, “This is boiled water for Falun Gong practitioners. No one else is allowed to drink it.” A week later, a guard came in holding a piece of paper and told her to get packed and go home, and that she was sentenced to three years of supervised release. She couldn’t believe it. She grabbed the paper and read it several times. She started crying with joy and jumped around in circles while hugging a friend of hers in the cell. She cried and said, “The day I heard that I was going to get sentenced to 12 years, I really didn’t want to live anymore. Today is such a blessing from heaven!” I told her, “My girl, do you realize what happened? It’s because you understood the truth and treated Dafa practitioners well. Therefore, you received blessings today.” She said, “Yes, yes!” She put her palms together and thanked me. I said, “No need to thank me. You should thank Dafa’s Master!” She hurriedly said, “Thank you, Falun Gong Master! Thank you, Falun Gong Master!” She went home happily. In the two days after she left, 19 out of 21 people in our cell withdrew from the CCP and its affiliated youth organizations. My Family Members Recite the “Nine-Character Mantra” to Survive the Pandemic When the pandemic was at its worst in China at the end of 2022, around 10 p.m. one night, my eldest son called me and said, “Mom, I’m feeling really terrible.” I said, “Have you forgotten that at critical times, you need to recite the nine-character mantra?” He said, “I did forget. I’ll start reciting it now.” Early the next morning, he called again, “I have recovered now, but my wife and child are sick.” I said, “Tell them the same method I told you, and everything will be fine.” One day later, both of them had recovered. I was worried about my sister’s family and I called them. My sister said she got the virus and was standing in the room, because she could not sit down; and that she had been out of breath all night last night. I quickly told her, “Reciting the nine-character mantra can save your life!” The next day, my sister called and said, “I’ve been reciting it for a whole night. Now I’m good and can lie down to sleep!” Copyright © 2023 Minghui.org. All rights reserved.",

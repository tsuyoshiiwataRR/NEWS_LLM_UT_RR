    "text": "Sunday, December 24, 2023 02:40 pm Mirna Walid – Beirut – Lebanese artist Reem Al-Sharif sparked controversy by declaring that the interpretation of the Holy Qur’an is distorted and that Islam did not forbid alcohol. She said: “A religion of 1,400 years has not been distorted? It has not been distorted?” She continued that the interpretation of the Qur’an is distorted, and considered that the Holy Qur’an does not forbid alcohol. Where God said a verse: “Do not approach prayer while you are drunk,” and He did not say, “Do not become drunk,” as it expresses it. Reem’s statement came during her interview on the “What’s the Story” program with journalist Rabaa Al-Zayat. Reem’s statements were met with objection by some, who considered her words to be completely untrue. These were the details of Reem Al-Sharif’s [news](https://www.world-today-news.com/category/news/) that sparked controversy with her statement that the interpretation of the Qur’an is distorted and Islam did not prohibit alcohol for today.

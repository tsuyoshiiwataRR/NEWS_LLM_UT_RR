    "text": "The following are among the abuses and murders inflicted on Christians by Muslims throughout the month of November 2023.\nPakistan : A Muslim man murdered a young Christian because he was \"driven by a strong hatred for Christians and Jews.\" On Nov. 9, around 3 a.m., Muhammad Zubair broke into a Christian household while everyone was asleep. After opening fire on Farhan Qamar, 20, the youngest of four siblings, the intruder held the entire family hostage at gunpoint for nearly 40 minutes, preventing them from going near the fatally injured youth. According to the slain man's father, Ul Qamar:\n\"My son was struggling for his life, bleeding profusely from the bullet wounds, but his murderer, Muhammad Zubair, did not allow us to even give him some water, let alone comfort him. He repeatedly called us 'Jews' as he cursed and waved his weapon at us. We all watched helplessly, pleading with him to leave, but he wouldn't go.... Finally, before Muhammad left the murder scene, he] pointed the gun towards my wife and ordered her to unlock the main gate. He sat on his motorcycle that was parked outside, fired three shots in the air with his pistol, and shouted, 'Allahu Akbar ['Allah is greatest'] two-three times before speeding away.\"\nOnce Muhammad left, the family gathered around their blood-soaked son and brother and started crying for help, but \"None of our neighbors intervened even after they heard the first three shots fired on Farhan by Zubair.\" Farhan died on the way to the hospital.",

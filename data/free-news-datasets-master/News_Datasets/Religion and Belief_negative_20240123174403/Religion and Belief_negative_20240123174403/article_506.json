The reason: the cathedral may be a target for Islamists.\nCologne - Shortly before the Christmas services, the police have increased security measures at Cologne Cathedral because of indications of a possible attack plan by an Islamist group. Police officers searched the cathedral with sniffer dogs on Saturday evening and announced that they would check all visitors on Christmas Eve. In Vienna, too, the police increased their protective measures. According to dpa information, security authorities had indications that a church in Vienna was also a possible target of the group. Previously, the \"Bild\" had reported.\nThe police in Cologne wanted to comment on the investigations in general on Sunday morning. At the same time, it was said that the authority would not comment on details because of the ongoing investigation.\nAccording to dpa information, the group could possibly have a connection to an offshoot of the terrorist network Islamic State (IS), which calls itself the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISPK) and has been fighting an armed conflict with the militant Islamist Taliban in Afghanistan for several years.\nAccording to \"Bild\", the first arrests by special forces in Vienna and also one in Germany were made on Saturday. The Directorate of State Security and Intelligence in the Austrian Ministry of the Interior did not want to comment on possible arrests. \"We ask for your understanding that we do not comment on current investigations,\" a spokesman in Vienna said late Saturday evening on request.\nThe Cologne police had justified the increase in their protective measures with a danger warning, without giving details. The State Security Service, which is active in politically motivated crimes, has begun investigations. Worshippers at Cologne Cathedral and tourists will have to adjust to increased security standards in the coming days.\n\"Even if the reference refers to New Year's Eve, we will already do everything this evening for the safety of the cathedral visitors on Christmas Eve. In coordination with the security officer of the cathedral chapter, the cathedral will be searched with sniffer dogs after the evening mass and then locked,\" said the head of the Cologne criminal police, Michael Esser, according to the statement. In the evening, police vehicles drove up in front of Cologne Cathedral, as dpa reporters observed. Police sniffer dogs were also deployed.\nA statement from the Vienna police said earlier that security authorities in Austria had increased their protective measures in the face of calls for terrorist attacks against Christian events across Europe, especially on Christmas Eve. Also due to a current risk assessment by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, there is generally an increased risk situation during the Christmas holidays, the police said. As a precautionary measure, there will be increased surveillance of endangered places in Vienna and in the provinces, including churches and Christmas markets.\nAccordingly, civilian and uniformed forces with special equipment and also rifles will be deployed. \"Police attention is mainly focused on churches and religious events, especially church services, and Christmas markets,\" the police said.\nMy news Warning for flooding in North Rhine-Westphalia – several cities affectedread more\nGovernment in North Rhine-Westphalia warns parents against reading Christmas presents\nSeveral railway lines in North Rhine-Westphalia will cease operation before Christmas.\nLuise (12) killed: Freudenberg shocked by wave of hatred – families of the perpetrators leave their place of residenceRead\nWhen bakeries are open on Christmas Eve in North Rhine-Westphaliaread\nShopping at Christmas in North Rhine-Westphalia: These opening hours apply to supermarkets read\nThe terror alert level in Austria is still elevated, the police said.

The declaration from the Vatican's doctrinal office allows Roman Catholic priests to administer blessings to same-sex couples, but these blessings should not be part of regular church rituals or liturgies. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, expresses support for gay rights in Ukraine but rules out constitutional changes for same-sex marriages due to the ongoing conflict.\nInsights by Ground AI\nDoes this summary seem wrong?

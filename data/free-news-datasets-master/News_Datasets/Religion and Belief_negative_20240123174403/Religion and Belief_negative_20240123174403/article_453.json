The reason: the cathedral may be a target for Islamists. However, no explosives have been found so far.\nCologne - So far, there have been no arrests in North Rhine-Westphalia in connection with a possible attack plan on Cologne Cathedral. The German Press Agency learned this on Sunday morning from security circles.\nDuring the search of the cathedral, no explosives were discovered. The explosives detection dogs had found nothing on Saturday evening.\nAccording to their own statements, the police have increased the security measures at Cologne Cathedral because of indications of a possible attack plan by an Islamist group. Police officers searched the cathedral with sniffer dogs on Saturday evening and announced that they would check all visitors on Christmas Eve. The \"Bild\" had previously reported that there had already been the first arrests by special forces in Vienna and also one in Germany on Saturday.\nAccording to dpa information, security authorities had received indications of a possible attack plan by an Islamist group on Cologne Cathedral. A church in Vienna was also a possible target, it was said on Saturday.\nAccording to dpa information, the group could possibly have a connection to an offshoot of the terrorist network Islamic State (IS), which calls itself the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISPK) and has been fighting an armed conflict with the militant Islamist Taliban in Afghanistan for several years.\nCologne police increase protective measures According to \"Bild\", the first arrests by special forces in Vienna and also one in Germany were made on Saturday. The Directorate of State Security and Intelligence in the Austrian Ministry of the Interior did not want to comment on possible arrests. \"We ask for your understanding that we do not comment on current investigations,\" a spokesman in Vienna said late Saturday evening on request.\nA statement from the Vienna police said earlier that security authorities in Austria had increased their protective measures in the face of calls for terrorist attacks against Christian events across Europe, especially on Christmas Eve. Also due to a current risk assessment by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, there is generally an increased risk situation during the Christmas holidays, the police said. As a precautionary measure, there will be increased surveillance of endangered places in Vienna and in the provinces, including churches and Christmas markets.\nAccordingly, civilian and uniformed forces with special equipment and also rifles will be deployed. \"Police attention is mainly focused on churches and religious events, especially church services, and Christmas markets,\" the police said. The terror alert level in Austria is still elevated, the police said. The additional precautionary measures were intended to maintain general safety in Austria, it said.\nMy news After shooting down Russian bombers: Putin's soldiers must be tremblingRead\n\"Kleptomaniacs\" – Lavrov insults German authorities\nYear-end spurt fails to materialise – CDU/CSU and traffic light continue to be on an equal footing in survey\nCracks in Putin's 'illusion of normality': German ambassador gives insight into life in RussiaRead\nIndications of planned attack on Cologne Cathedral – Police announce special protective measures Read more\nPutin apparently plans to recruit teenagers for the Ukraine warread more\nSince the terrorist attack on Israel by the Islamist Hamas on 7 October, fears have been growing that there could also be attacks in Germany.

    "text": "2023-12-24 08:34:00 The great actress Brigitte Bardot: “I don’t want to die in an Islamized France” “There was a time when I would have said that I didn’t want to live in an Islamized France. Today I say that I don’t want to die in an Islamized France!” Brigitte Bardot said this in an interview with the ultra-conservative weekly Valeurs Actuelles. “The murderers – he explains – are often of Islamic origin and they claim it! Unfortunately, for the most part, they are français de papier (immigrants who only have a French document, ed.) and often psychopaths. We should carry out a psychiatric examination on all migrants who enter before granting them the right to asylum and French nationality,” says Bardot. According to the great actress, the problem “it is Islam in general, the Islamist invasion, which are frighteningly dangerous for French identity and culture”. To demonstrate that our culture is in check, the Corriere della Sera reports, according to Bardot, there is the attack that Christmas is undergoing: “Here is another of those innovations that come out of the sick brains of our contemporaries who dirty everything that it is beautiful, pure, true, to modernize and globalize ancestral and traditional values that it would be a sacrilege to touch. “Wokism” is a ridiculous trend. I do not accept that the sublime is soiled or ridiculed.” Bardot is also critical of Pope Francis: “I can’t see it. It does a lot of harm to the Church. I adored John Paul II, I remember our beautiful meeting, unique, very warm, he was not a politician at all. I will never meet the current Pope.” We read in Corriere della Sera, “among his criticisms of the Pontiff is the fact that he did not respond to his letters. «He does not deal with the Christians of the East and never talks about them. When I learned that his name would be Francis, I said full of hope: if he chose this name, it is because he loves animals. I sent him a letter to congratulate and thank him for choosing that name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. I finally hoped that he would do something more to improve the fate of animals in the world, but he never replied to me. I sent him another letter, and he had one of his collaborators reply to me who thanked me, and blah blah. I therefore find him to be very rude.” Subscribe to the newsletter #Brigitte #Bardot #dont #die #Islamized #France #Pope #evil",

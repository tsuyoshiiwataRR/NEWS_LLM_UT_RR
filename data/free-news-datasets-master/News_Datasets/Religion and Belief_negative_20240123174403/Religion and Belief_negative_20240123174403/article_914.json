[Patrick Cooley](/author/patrick-cooley) An obscure Catholic church in Southern Italy finds itself at the center of controversy on the weekend before Christmas after it featured a nativity scene with two mothers, Reuters reported. Nativity scenes generally depict an infant Jesus with his mother, the Virgin Mary, and her husband, Joseph. But at the Church of Saints Peter and Paul in the Southern Italian hamlet of Capocastello di Mercogliano, Joseph is nowhere to be found, according to pictures posted on social media and featured in various media outlets. In his place is another woman. A petition [calling for the removal of the nativity scene](https://www-provitaefamiglia-it.translate.goog/petizione/no-alla-strumentalizzazione-blasfema-lgbtq-del-presepe-firma-ora?_x_tr_sl=it&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc) has been circulated online by the conservative group Pro-Vita & Famiglia (pro-life and family). It has drawn more than 23,000 signatures. However, anyone around the globe can sign the petition and its unclear how many signatories are from Italy. Father Vitaliano Della, priest of the church in the Italian province of Avellino, [defended the scene](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/blasphemous-same-sex-nativity-scene-angers-conservatives-italy-2023-12-23/) in an interview with Reuters. \"I wanted to show with this scene that families are no longer just the traditional ones,\" he said. \"In our parishes we see more and more children from the new types of families that exist and are part of our society, children of separated and divorced people, gay couples, single people, young mothers.\" [Pope Francis Criticizes Conservative American Catholics for ‘Backwards’ Views](/news/pope-francis-criticizes-conservative-american-catholics-for-backwards-views?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) [Mother with Children Named ‘Aryan’ and ‘Nation’ Charged in Death of Native American Woman](/news/mother-with-children-named-aryan-and-nation-charged-in-death-of-native-american-woman?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) [Schools in Italy Could be Fined if They Skip the Nativity Display Under Proposed Law](/news/italy-schools-potential-fines-refusing-nativity-displays-giorgia-meloni?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) [‘The Marvels’ Post Credit Scenes Explained: Two New Superhero Teams Are Poised to Join the MCU](/entertainment/the-marvels-ending-post-credits-kelsey-grammer-beast-hailee-steinfeld-kate-bishop-x-men-young-avengers?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) [Speed Maui’s Recovery with a New Civilian Conservation Corps](/opinion/speed-mauis-recovery-with-a-new-civilian-conservation-corps?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) [Arrest Made in Fatal Shooting of Kentucky Teacher at Catholic University in Washington, D.C.](/news/arrest-made-in-fatal-shooting-of-kentucky-teacher-at-catholic-university-in-washington-d-c?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) News of the nativity scene broke just days after Pope Francis, in a landmark decision, [allowed priests to bless same-sex couples](https://themessenger.com/news/pope-francis-approves-blessing-same-sex-couples-priests) with the understanding that those blessings are not connected to the sacrament of marriage.

Joseph, the group says in the petition calling for the nativity scene’s removal, was “sacrificed at the altar of political correctness.” The group called for the bishop of Avellino, Monsignor Arturo Aiello, to order the scene’s removal.

[pic.twitter.com/EXgxxm7aGj] — Echo Chamber (@echo_chamberz) [December 21, 2023] From [Jewish Insider, \"Former ADL, AJC leaders Abe Foxman and David Harris call for scrapping DEI\"](https://jewishinsider.com/2023/12/former-adl-ajc-leaders-abe-foxman-and-david-harris-call-for-scrapping-dei/): [Abe] Foxman, who served as the Anti-Defamation League’s national director for 28 years until 2015, insisted that DEI “cannot be fixed.” He said that part of the problem is that DEI is “based on a faulty premise — that racism is a function of oppressed and oppressors [and] that all white people are oppressors and all people of color [are] oppressed.” The results, Foxman said, are “bias, illiberalism, reinforced, legitimized and institutionalized antisemitism in many institutions.” Foxman added: “It has built a huge funded bureaucracy which is today difficult to change or amend. Efforts by communal Jewish organizations to include the Jewish community or soften its impact on antisemitism have failed. It cannot be fixed, it needs to be scrapped and replaced by a vigorous implementation of our civil rights laws that are color blind, and apply equally to all. If necessary some civil rights laws can be amended and strengthened. DEI was developed to eliminate bias but sadly it created bias.” David Harris, the longtime CEO of the American Jewish Committee, echoed similar criticisms of DEI. “DEI has evolved into a mammoth, ideologically-driven presence on many campuses, some of which have literally hundreds of staff working exclusively in this space,” Harris told JI. “Accordingly, I don’t believe that outside efforts, however well-intentioned, that nibble around the edges or simply seek to add Jews to the DEI agenda, address the heart of the problem. DEI today poses a major challenge to liberal understanding of American societal aims, so the goal of rethinking it conceptually is far more urgent than just trying to get along with it.” Current AJC and ADL leaders told JI their organizations are taking an engage-and-influence approach— and had been doing so well before Oct. 7. Sara Coodin, AJC’s director of academic affairs, said that the group “engages pretty regularly and partners with universities to work on education programs that can have the kinds of results we are looking for, more inclusion for Jewish students.” “We tend not to take an overly divisive approach when it comes to DEI,” she said, pointing to an AJC-run trip that brings DEI university staff to Israel. Current ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt also appears to be pivoting away from DEI. A few days ago, he hilariously claimed he's against \"cancel culture\" and described it as \"un-Jewish.\" Jonathan Greenblatt of the ADL explains his role and relationship with Musk. “The only team I play for is the Jewish team” Goes on to say that cancel culture is “un-jewish”(lol), then celebrates Elon for banning “from the river to the sea.” [pic.twitter.com/xijsbwshFI] — Hark (@Hark240) [December 16, 2023] [Everything was great when the ADL was brainwashing children that whites are their oppressors](https://www.informationliberation.com/?id=62856) but [now that Jews are being lumped in with whites it's suddenly a problem.](https://www.informationliberation.com/?id=64127) Read more at: [InformationLiberation.com](https://www.informationliberation.com/?id=64195)",

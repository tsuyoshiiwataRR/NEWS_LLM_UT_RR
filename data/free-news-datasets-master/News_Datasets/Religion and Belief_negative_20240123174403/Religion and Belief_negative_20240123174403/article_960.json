    "text": "Janey Godley has shut down a vile troll who said she ‘wouldn’t see\nChristmas’.\nThe Scottish comedian, 62, was diagnosed with terminal ovarian cancer in November 2021, before\nundergoing a hysterectomy two months later, and getting the all-clear in June.\nHowever, she devastatingly revealed in December last year that\n her cancer had returned and has since been sharing updates with fans on X (formerly known as Twitter).\nWhile Janey has been keeping positive and sharing honest updates online amid her health battle, some trolls have been sharing abuse online.\nAnd she’s not having it.\nResharing a post from May, which read ‘Don’t think she will see Christmas’ above a picture of herself, Janey simply wrote: ‘I won.’\nHer response was showered in love, with X user @antivii writing: ‘The internet never ceases to amaze with its troll culture. Well done you and just know – the vast vast majority of us are rooting for you!’\n‘Won & winning.’ @TracyAustin_ added, while @Seanrobertz echoed: ‘Well done, here is to many more victories merry Christmas.’\nIn September this year,\nJaney shared she’d been given the all-clear for three months, after a scan.\nIn the tearful video, she said: ‘Thank you everybody who’s been sending love and positive feelings.\n‘People sending prayers and all the support has been overwhelming. This is how I’m gonna live my life. In three-month increments.’\nShe continued: ‘Wow. Another clear scan. Yes. Thank you Scottish National Health for prolonging my life as long as they can through this cancer treatment.’\nAlongside the video, Janey wrote in a tweet: ‘I have terminal cancer, I will never have the all clear, like millions of people I am living with a life-limiting disease but I am receiving treatment and today I got a clear scan – I get scans every three months – thanks @Beatson_Charity and Scottish NHS and thanks to everyone.’\nMacmillan cancer support\nIf you or someone you care about has been diagnosed with cancer, Macmillan can offer support and information.\nYou can contact their helpline on 0808 808 00 00 (7 days a week from 8am to 8pm), use their\nwebchat service, or visit their site for more information.\nGot a story?\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the\nMetro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\nMORE :\nBobby Brazier’s grandmother ‘frozen out’ of Christmas celebrations due to feud with dad Jeff\nMORE :\nAlison Hammond breaks down in tears over hugely emotional and unexpected moment",

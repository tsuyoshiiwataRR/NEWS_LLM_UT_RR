    "text": "New Delhi: Still grappling with the grim aftermath of ethnic violence that claimed many lives while turning the state into a warzone, the familiar Yuletide air and festive cheer is amiss in Manipur this year. With embers of the violent clashes between the Meitei and Kuki communities still burning and memories of rioting and arson still fresh in the minds of locals, the church bodies in the Northeast state have given a call for muted Christmas celebrations this year.\nInstead of immersing in the revelry, the churches have urged locals to mass on Christmas Eve and pray for the restoration of peace in the trouble-torn state at the earliest. Many ardent followers of the faith said this Christmas would be less about festivity and more about caring and giving for the victims.\nAccording to an official release from Directorate of Information and Public Relations (DIPR), the air around Christmas is largely subdued in the hill districts and some Christian pockets of Imphal valley this year.\n“While there will be community celebrations during our service on the evening of 24 th and 25 th morning, we have requested our members not to indulge in lavish spending and grand feasting, and instead use their resources to help those who are in need,” pastor of Tangkhul Baptist Church, Rev Khayaipam Khamrang, said.\nEchoing Khamrang’s thought, another local from Imphal’s Nagaram, Thuireisang Singlai said, “Last year, it was pretty amazing because all of us were united. But this year, due to the current situation, we are unable to have a grand festival. I hope all of us can come together as one and figure out a solution and live in peace.”\nThe impact of the strife has also hit the gift outlet dealers in Imphal.\n“This year we could sell only 25 per cent of what was sold last year. I hope the situation improves soon,” one of them said.\nExtending its Christmas greetings, the Manipur Naga Youth Organisation (MNYO) expressed heartfelt wishes for peace among the Meitei and the Kuki communities. Emphasising on unity and understanding, MYNO urged everyone to foster harmony across diverse cultures.\nMNYO President Athot Keitang affirmed the organisation’s commitment to promoting peace and goodwill, not just during the festive season, but throughout the year.",

    "text": "Q: I thought Christmas was -- is -- supposed to be about \"peace on Earth.\" But when I look at the world, all I see is conflict, hatred and suffering. Where's the peace?\nJim: I suppose it's easy to be somewhat discouraged when we look at our world and see all the pain and heartache. And I know that many people use that suffering as \"proof\" to reject the message of Christmas altogether.\nBut I see it differently. In my view, the purpose and meaning of Christmas is not to paste a fake smile over the ugliness of this world and pretend that everything's just fine. We can see that it isn't -- yet.\nThe promise of Christmas -- the reason we can sing about \"peace on Earth, goodwill to men\" -- is summed up in the word HOPE. The story of the baby in the manger is a glimpse into the reality that there's much more than just this world, and this present pain. Heaven came to Earth and actually entered into our pain and brokenness. And Christmas is just Act 1 -- it isn't complete without Easter.\nYes, our world is a mess. But I believe there's something beyond this world. If we're willing to dig into the meaning behind Christmas (and Easter), grasping the hope and peace that is offered through those historical events, we can rise above the pain and suffering. We can actually thrive amidst the hardships because we know there's hope for what's beyond this life. And with that hope filling our hearts and driving our actions, we can work to make this present broken world a better, more peaceful place.\nFor more about the hope of Christmas, visit the website below or call 800-A-FAMILY (232-6459).\n Q: When my husband and I have some tension, I tend to be less patient and more irritable with my children. How can I still connect with my kids even when my husband and I are having conflict?\nDr. Danny Huerta, Vice President, Parenting & Youth: Relationships lead to emotions -- sometimes positive, sometimes negative. So it only makes sense that when you're \"off\" emotionally toward your husband, you're more prone to being \"off\" toward your kids.\nIt sounds like it's time to seek some counseling help for your marriage so you and your husband can identify what hot buttons you each have that are being pushed -- and why those buttons exist. Meanwhile, here are four things you can do as a gift for your children:\n-- Write down what you're upset about, then come back to those thoughts and emotions later as you work to resolve the issues with your husband. Kids can learn that writing things down can be a helpful way to shift their brain when they get stuck emotionally.\nCOPYRIGHT 2023 Andrews McMeel Syndication.

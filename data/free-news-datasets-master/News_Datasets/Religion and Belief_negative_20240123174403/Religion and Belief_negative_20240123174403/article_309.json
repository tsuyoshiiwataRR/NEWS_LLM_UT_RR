    "text": "There’s no denying it hasn’t been an easy year for many Australians.\nChristian leaders have struck a more sombre tone in their 2023 Christmas messages, as they reflect on conflicts abroad and offer their sympathies to those who are struggling with rising costs.\nThe Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, Kanishka Raffel, acknowledged the impact that the housing crisis has had on many Australian families.\n“The beginning of this year seemed to offer a fresh start as we came out of COVID, yet as 2023 unfolded, the cost of living rose beyond the means of many,” he said.\nThe archbishop described the spirit of Christmas as a salve during trying times.\n“Rising costs may have forced a stripped down Christmas this year, yet when you strip away the tinsel, you have the simple message of Christmas,” he said.\n“So simple a child can believe, yet so substantial that its wonders and glories can fill our hearts and sustain us through life’s challenges.”\nArchbishop Raffel also acknowledged how the suffering of people overseas had “reached deep” into our society.\n“We witnessed with grief and horror man-made calamity and war and conflict, as well as natural disasters, tragic accidents, and terrible crimes,” he said.\n“What can we say when people come face-to-face with evil? How can we make sense of this desperate world? We need a word from God which is exactly what Christmas is: God has spoken through his son, Jesus.”\nThese challenges were also front of mind for the Uniting Church’s president, Reverend Sharon Hollis.\n“In this season of celebration, the mood seems far from celebratory in many places,” she said.\n“In Australia, many people are struggling to afford food and shelter. Others have watched their homes and livelihoods burnt in fires or destroyed by droughts.\n“Violence and more continue … Our hearts cry out as we see hospitals bombed, hostages held, babies dying for the lack of basic care, and homes crumbling.”\nShe reminded believers that Jesus is God’s way of “standing in solidarity with us” and helping them find peace and joy.\n“Christmas invites us to meet God in all of life — our despair, our suffering, our wonder, our celebration,” she said.\n“Let us rejoice in the confidence that God dwells with each of us and the whole world in love.”\nCatholic Archbishop of Melbourne, Peter Comensoli, suggested people come together to lighten each other’s burdens.\n“Our hearts ache for reconciliation of peoples at this time, respect for our shared humanity, care for our crying planet,” he said.\n“Our world and its people seem to be groaning and railing against pathways to true peace. Yet, we experience the hope of God through simple words of joy, mercy and peace.\n“We, too, can be messengers whose footfalls bring light into the world, announcing mercy, bringing joy, offering good news.”",

    "text": "A retired police officer was shot dead by unidentified terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir's Baramulla district on Sunday morning while offering prayers in mosque, according to police. Identified as Mohammad Shafi, a former Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), the deceased man was giving the Muslim call to prayer at a mosque in the city's Gantmulla area, reported Greater Kashmir. Police have cordoned off the area and more details are awaited. “#Terrorists fired upon Shri Mohd Shafi, a retired police officer at Gantmulla, Sheeri #Baramulla, while praying Azan in the mosque and succumbed to injuries. Area has been #cordoned off. Further details awaited. @JmuKmrPolice,” the Kashmir Zone Police wrote on X. The 72-year-old is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter, reported KNO, a news agency. A few days ago terrorists ambushed two Army vehicles in Poonch, killing five soldiers and injuring two others. This comes days after Jammu and Kashmir police dismantled a terrorist module assigned to target off-duty policemen in Srinagar. Three terrorists were apprehended for their involvement in the assault on a police constable in Srinagar's Bemina area on December 9. On December 9, police constable Hafiz Mohammad Chad was shot dead by the terrorists in Hamdania Colony of Bemina. They were identified as Imtiyaz Ahmed Khanday and Danish Ahmed Mala, both from Bemina, and Mehran Khan from Rainawari. The trio was operating under the guidance of a Pakistan-based handler named Hamza-Burhan, originally from Pulwama.",

    "text": "TRIBUNNEWS.COM – The latest survey shows that the majority of Saudi Arabian citizens reject the normalization of relations between their country and Israel.\nThe survey was conducted from November 14 to December 6, 2023 by the Washington Near East Policy Institute.\nIn the survey there were 1,000 Saudi Arabian citizens who were respondents. There were as many as 96 percent of those who said they rejected normalizing relations.\nThen, it was also discovered that support from Arab citizens for the Hamas group in Gaza was increasing.\nOnly 16 percent of Arabs believe Hamas should stop its efforts to eliminate Israel and accept a two-state solution.\n“The majority of Arab citizens (95 percent) responded that Hamas does not in fact kill civilians when asked whether they believe that the killing of civilians by Hamas is against Islam,” the survey results stated. Palestine Chronicle.\nIn addition, 87 percent of respondents believed that recent events had shown that Israel was very weak and experiencing internal divisions.\nAccording to them, Israel will one day be defeated.\nAlso read: 4 Thousand Palestinians Arrested by Israel, Hamas Urges ICRC to Check Their Condition\nMeanwhile, The\nNew York Times said the survey results showed that there were big challenges for the United States (US) government under President Joe Biden.\nThe US will find it increasingly difficult to urge Saudi Arabia to establish diplomatic relations with Israel.\n“For years the US and Israeli media planted a false narrative that Saudi Arabians had abandoned Palestine and that in reality normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, the entire Muslim\nworld, was only a matter of time,” said Ramzy Baroud, a journalist and observer of Palestinian politics.\nAccording to Baroud, the survey results are not the first time that Arab citizens have proven that their solidarity with Palestinians is genuine.\nHe also said that Arab citizens were fully aware that Israel would not be able to continue its crimes against Palestinians if it were not assisted by the US.\nAlso read: Experts say the US and Israel are now facing a strong enemy and can cause trouble, who?\nUS youth support for Hamas increases\n2023-12-24 11:55:11\n#Calling #Israel #Weak #Defeated #Majority #Arab #Citizens #Reject #Normalization #Relations",

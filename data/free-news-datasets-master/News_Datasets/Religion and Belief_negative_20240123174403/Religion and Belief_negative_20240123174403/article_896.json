Nativity scenes are popular in largely Catholic Italy, but in recent years they have become embroiled in the culture wars. Society has become more secular and multicultural. The parish priest of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Capocastello di Mercogliano, a village in the province of Avellino, located an hour’s drive east of Naples, defended the representation of the birth of Jesus. “I wanted to show through this scene that families are no longer just traditional” “I wanted to show with this scene that families are no longer just traditional,” he said. reuters and Father Vitaliano Della Sala.

    "text": "‘Trying to get Hindu votes’: Trinamool vs BJP on Gita recitation event in Kolkata\nWest Bengal minister and TMC leader Udayan Guha on Sunday criticised a Gita recitation event in Kolkata’s historical Brigade Parade Ground, saying that the event was “political” and the BJP was trying to garner Hindu votes through it.\nNotably, the BJP has denied this claim, saying that three apolitical organisations had planned the event.\n“They are trying to garner more Hindu votes. People of India, especially Bengali people, do not like this politics,” Guha said.\nThe TMC leader added that it would have been more beneficial for young people if a sports event was held instead of a Gita recitation event.\nThe gathering, which saw one lakh participants chanting from Bhagavad Gita in Kolkata, was organised by the “Ek Lokho Konthe Geeta Path” committee, an association of three organisations.\nThe event, which was not officially a BJP program, saw the participation of several prominent BJP leaders from Bengal, including Leader of the Opposition in the assembly Suvendu Adhikari, State BJP president Sukanta Majumder, MP Dilip Ghosh, and Locket Chaterjee.\nAnother TMC leader, Shashi Panja, criticised the BJP’s involvement in the event, suggesting that the party was showing disrespect to Bengal’s icons like Swami Vivekananda by misinterpreting his teachings on the importance of physical activity over spiritual study.\n“Swami Vivekananda once said that you will be nearer to heaven if you play football rather than study Gita. Today, what did we see? Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar showed disrespect to Swami Vivekananda’s thoughts and his sayings,” Panja said.\nThe Bengal BJP president refuted allegations by the TMC leaders, saying “This is not a program of the BJP. Three different organisations have come together for this. This is the cultural heritage of India as well as Bengal.”\nNotably, ahead of the event today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveyed his best wishes to the “Lokkhe Konthe Gita Path” gathering. He expressed optimism that the collective recitation of the Bhagavad Gita by a diverse gathering would not only foster social harmony but also inject energy into the nation’s development journey. Although Modi was expected to attend the event today, he could not make it.\nWatch Live TV in English\nWatch Live TV in Hindi",

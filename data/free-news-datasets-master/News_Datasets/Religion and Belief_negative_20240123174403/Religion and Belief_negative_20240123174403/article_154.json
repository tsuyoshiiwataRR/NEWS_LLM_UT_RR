    "text": "New Delhi: Amid widespread outrage over the vandalism of a prominent Hindu temple by pro-Khalistani elements in California, the US condemned the incident and welcomed police’s efforts to ensure the culprits are held accountable. The temple was defaced with anti-India and pro-Khalistan slogans spray-painted on it. Several US lawmakers, including prominent Indian-American Congressmen, also strongly deplored the vandalism and said that those responsible for the act must be held accountable. “We condemn the vandalism of Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu Temple in California. We welcome efforts by the Newark Police Department to ensure that those responsible are held accountable,” the US State Department for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs posted on X. Congressman Ro Khanna, who represents California’s 17th Congressional District located in Silicon Valley, said that freedom to worship is at the heart of American democracy and that those behind the vandalism must be held accountable. Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi called the defacing of the Swaminarayan temple as “despicable” and said he strongly condemns it. Congressman Shri Thanedar, the US representative from Michigan’s 13th Congressional District, called for action by law enforcement to bring the perpetrators to justice as he expressed his condemnation of the “disgraceful act of vandalism”. “This desecration, marked by anti-India graffiti, strikes at the very essence of our diverse and inclusive society. I denounce such attacks of intolerance and call for a thorough investigation into this heinous crime,” Thanedar said. Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu temple, a prominent Hindu temple in Newark city in California, was vandalised with anti-India and pro-Khalistan graffiti, causing outrage among the Indian community. The temple’s wall was spray-painted with hate-filled slogans against India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the latest such incident targeting Hindu places of worship in the country. The police department in Newark received information about the incident at around 8.35 am on Friday. The department said any acts or threats of violence, property damage, harassment, intimidation, or other crimes motivated by hate or bias are considered very serious and given very high priority. Meanwhile, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar strongly condemned the incident and said that the extremist and separatist forces outside India should not get space. He also said that Indian consulate lodged a complaint with the US government over the matter. The Indian Embassy in San Francisco also deplored the defacing of the temple and said that the incident has hurt the sentiments of the Indian community. “We strongly condemn the defacing of SMVS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir at Newark, California with anti-India graffiti. We have pressed for quick investigation and prompt action against the vandals by the US authorities in this matter,” the embassy wrote on X. In the recent past, similar incidents were reports in several other countries, including Canada, the UK and the US with India urging its partner countries to not give space to “extremist Khalistani ideology”. A rise in anti-India activities by Khalistan supporters have been witnessed in these countries after the death of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada.

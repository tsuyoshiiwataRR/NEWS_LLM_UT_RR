    "text": "Bethlehem, the biblical birthplace of Jesus which is usually very much alive, looks like a ghost town today as the Christmas Eve and Christmas celebrations according to the Gregorian calendar have been canceled due to the war between Israel and Hamas. There are no holiday lights and Christmas trees that usually decorate the Manger Square, as well as numerous foreign tourists who gather every year to celebrate Christmas in the Holy Land according to the Gregorian calendar. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrol the empty square. Souvenir shops are slow to open on Christmas Day although some did open when the rain stopped, but there are few visitors. The manger scene in that square, which is located near the Church of the Nativity, built on the site where Jesus is believed to have been born, is surrounded by barbed wire and surrounded by debris, reflecting the war in Gaza. There are no cheerful lights and colors that usually fill the square during the Christmas season. \"We can't justify decorating the Christmas tree and celebrating as usual, when some people (in Gaza) don't even have houses to go to,\" said one of the owners of the Alftim restaurant, located a few steps from Nativity Square. He said that usually that restaurant is the most visited on Christmas Day, that you can't find an empty chair and that they are full from morning to night, and this year only one table is occupied, and behind it are sitting journalists who sought respite from the rain. . He said that his restaurant does 15 percent of regular business and cannot cover expenses, and that when the war ends it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal. The cancellation of the Christmas celebrations is a severe blow to the city's economy, as tourism accounts for 70 percent of the revenue, and almost all of it is generated during the Christmas season. Since many airlines have canceled flights to Israel, there are few foreign visitors. Local officials say more than 70 hotels in Bethlehem have had to close, putting thousands of people out of work. More than 20.000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's air and ground offensive against the Palestinian Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, according to official Hamas figures, and 85 percent of the enclave's 2,3 million residents have been displaced. The war was triggered by an October 7 attack by Hamas on southern Israel that killed around 1.200 people, mostly civilians, and took more than 240 hostages. The fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the occupied West Bank. Since October 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of vehicles waiting to pass military checkpoints. Because of the restrictions, tens of thousands of Palestinians cannot leave that territory to work in Israel. Between the Palestinian territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank is Israel, and in order to get from one territory to the other, permits are required, which are difficult to obtain. Bethlehem is close to Jerusalem, but is separated from it by a high concrete wall, which Israel claims prevents extremists from the West Bank from carrying out attacks on Israeli territory.

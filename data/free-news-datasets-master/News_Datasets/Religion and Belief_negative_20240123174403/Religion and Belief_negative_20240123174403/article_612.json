    "text": "Europe 1 with AFP 12:12 p.m., December 24, 2023On the 79th day of the conflict between Israel and Hamas, the Israeli army announced that it was intensifying its operations in the southern Gaza Strip. The IDF also announced that nearly 152 of its soldiers had died since the beginning of the operation. The Israeli military said on Sunday it was stepping up operations against Hamas in the southern Gaza Strip, while the United States urged Israel to do more to spare civilians at risk of hunger. In a phone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, US President Joe Biden \"underscored the critical need to protect the civilian population,\" according to the White House. Biden said he had \"not asked for a ceasefire\" between Israel and Hamas. The U.S. continues to show unwavering support for its historic ally, but recently it has been increasingly insisting that Israel move to a less intense phase of its offensive and favor more targeted operations against Hamas officials. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas since an attack of unprecedented scale and violence carried out on its soil on October 7 by the Islamist movement from the Gaza Strip. On that day, Hamas commandos killed about 1,140 people, the majority of them civilians, according to the latest official Israeli figures. They also kidnapped about 250 people, 129 of whom remain in Gaza custody, according to Israel. In retaliation, Israel has vowed to \"annihilate\" Hamas, pounding and besieging Palestinian territory and conducting a ground operation there since October 27. The operations killed 20,258 people, mostly women, teenagers and children, and wounded more than 53,000, according to Hamas' health ministry. Since the beginning of the conflict, 152 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza, according to the latest army toll published on Sunday. Khan Younis, a new stronghold targeted On Sunday, fresh shelling hit Jabaliya and Gaza City in the north, as well as Khan Younis, the major city in the south, Hamas said. The north has so far been the scene of enormous destruction, on this coastal strip where 1.9 million people have been forced to flee their homes, or 85% of the population, according to the UN. The Israeli military has announced its intention to continue striking in the south, looking for Hamas officials, which it considers a terrorist group, along with the United States and the European Union. After Gaza City, \"we are pivoting south and concentrating our main operations on another Hamas stronghold, Khan Younis,\" army spokesman Jonathan Conricus told Fox News. Fighting in the north \"will continue, perhaps at a lower intensity\", he added. Uncertainties over the delivery of humanitarian aid voted by the UN The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is dire: most hospitals are out of service and in the next six weeks, the entire population is at risk of high levels of food insecurity, up to and including starvation, according to the United Nations. The UN Security Council on Friday passed a resolution calling for the \"immediate\" and \"large-scale\" delivery of humanitarian aid. But the scope of this text, which managed to avoid a US veto by calling for \"creating the conditions for a lasting cessation of hostilities\" rather than a \"ceasefire\", remains uncertain. NGOs and UN agencies say the intensity of Israeli strikes makes it almost impossible to distribute food aid. The Gazans interviewed by AFP denounced the international community. The resolution \"reinforces Israel's decision to kill more civilians and prolongs the war against these people in exchange for some food,\" said Rami al-Khalut, a northerner who fled to the southern city of Rafah. \"Rather than (...) to increase aid deliveries, stop supporting Israel and supplying it with weapons, (...) stop the war and give us peace.\" In Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of refugees are sheltering in makeshift camps, people are rushing to buy food rations, which are insufficient to satisfy everyone, AFP found. \"My children have lost a lot of weight, hunger wakes them up at night,\" said Nour Barbakh, a displaced woman from Khan Younis as she waited in line to wait for food. IDF says it has arrested 'more than 200 terrorists' In the central city of Deir el-Balah, a strike on Saturday killed and wounded many others, including several women and children, AFP reported. My \"house was hit by a drone missile,\" said Abed al-Khawalda, who lost his sister in the bombing. It \"collapsed on top of the people in it.\" On Saturday, the Israeli military claimed to have captured \"more than 200 terrorists\" during the week, and \"more than 700\" since the beginning of the conflict. It also said that a strike on Rafah on Friday, which Hamas said killed four members of the same family, including a young girl, targeted an official of the Palestinian movement in charge of supplying weapons. For its part, Hamas' health ministry accused Israeli forces this week of \"committing several atrocious massacres\" in the Jabaliya and Tal Al-Zaatar areas, including \"executing dozens of citizens in the streets.\" Contacted by AFP, the army did not specifically respond to the accusations of executions but assured that its strikes \"against military targets are in accordance with international law\". Uncertainties for five hostages Egyptian and Qatari mediators are still trying to reach a compromise between the warring parties on a new truce that would allow more aid to enter Gaza as well as the release of Palestinian hostages and prisoners held by Israel. At the end of November, a week-long truce led to the release of 105 Palestinian hostages and 240 prisoners, as well as the entry of humanitarian aid convoys into Gaza. Nevertheless, both sides remain intransigent. Hamas is demanding a halt to the fighting before any negotiations can take place over the hostages. Israel is open to the idea of a truce but rules out any ceasefire until the Islamist movement is \"eliminated.\" On Saturday, Hamas' military wing claimed to have \"lost contact\" with men guarding five Israeli hostages. They were probably \"killed in an Israeli strike,\" she said. No confirmation could be obtained from Israel. Boats targeted by drones in the Red Sea Beyond Gaza, the risk of a regional conflagration persists. Yemen's Houthi rebels have been threatening to slow down global trade by attacking maritime traffic in the Red Sea for several weeks, saying they are acting in solidarity with Hamas. A chemical tanker was hit off the coast of India on Saturday by an \"attack drone fired from Iran\", and two US oil tankers and a destroyer sailing in the Red Sea were also targeted by drones launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen, according to the US military. The Pentagon says Iran, an ally of Yemeni rebels and Hamas, is giving information to the Houthis for planning their attacks, accusations that have been rejected by Tehran.",

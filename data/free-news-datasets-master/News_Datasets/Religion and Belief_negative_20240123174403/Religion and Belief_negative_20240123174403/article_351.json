    "text": "Lord Cameron said Hamas, Houthis and Hezbollah ‘proxies’ for Tehran regime David Cameron last night told Iran to cease its ‘malign’ activities, saying they would not be tolerated in the Middle East or here at home in the UK.\nThe Foreign Secretary branded Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah as ‘proxies’ for the Tehran regime who were fuelling an extremely high level of danger and insecurity around the world.\nLord Cameron insisted Iran must be sent ‘an incredibly clear message that this escalation will not be tolerated’.\nIn an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, he vowed that Britain would work with allies to ‘develop a really strong set of deterrent measures’ against Tehran.\nLord Cameron said the threat of Iran was one of five significant crises around the world, along with the Russia-Ukraine war, the Middle East conflict, terrorism and climate change.\nLord Cameron branded Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah as ‘proxies’ for the Tehran regime who were fuelling an extremely high level of danger and insecurity around the world\nHe added: ‘Iran is a thoroughly malign influence in the region and in the world – there’s no doubt about that.\n‘You’ve got the Houthis, you’ve got Hezbollah, you’ve got the Iranian-backed militias in Iraq that have actually been attacking British and American bases, troops.’\nHis tough message came after the US pointed to evidence last week that Iran was deeply involved in planning Houthi attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea – attacks that are already creating a major disruption to shipping and supply chains across Europe.\nBut in his interview, the Foreign Secretary also cited more evidence of the ‘unacceptable threat the Iranian regime poses to the lives of UK-based journalists’ after it emerged that Iranian spies had offered a people smuggler £150,000 to assassinate two news presenters at a London-based Persian language news channel.\nLord Cameron summoned Iran’s most senior diplomat in the UK to the Foreign Office on Friday to make clear that these threats will not be tolerated, the Telegraph reported.\nThe Foreign Secretary’s unambiguous message to Tehran is understood to reflect rising concern in the Government over Iran’s increasing aggression and action from groups seen as acting on its behalf both in the Middle East and around the world.\nHe was speaking following a trip encompassing France, Italy, Jordan and Egypt last week, where he held discussions about Iran – including in an hour-long meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron.\nThe US pointed to evidence last week that Iran was deeply involved in planning Houthi attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea (Pictured: Yemen’s Houthi loyalists take part in an armed parade for more than 20,000 members who have finished a military course)\nMeanwhile, America’s most experienced Middle East diplomat yesterday said Hamas leaders should quit Gaza immediately to spare the suffering of Palestinian civilians.\nAmbassador Dennis Ross, who served five US Presidents in a variety of roles, said the departure of the terror group’s commanders would be the only way of bringing Israel’s bombardment of the region to a halt quickly.\nThe alternative, he said, would be for Israel to continue its military campaign, which he predicted would continue in its ‘intense’ form until next month.\n‘As long as Hamas has the potential to control Gaza, Israel will feel they can’t live with that threat next door,’ Mr Ross told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.\nRead more",

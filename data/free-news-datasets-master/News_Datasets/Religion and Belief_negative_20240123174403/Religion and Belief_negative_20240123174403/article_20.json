    "text": "A group of British priests, numbering around 500, affiliated with the Confraternity of Catholic Clergy, has released an open letter emphasizing the “unchangeable” nature of the teachings of the Catholic Church. This comes in response to a groundbreaking ruling approved by Pope Francis allowing priests to issue blessings to same-sex couples under specific conditions. The Vatican’s doctrinal office issued a document on Monday stating that Roman Catholic priests could grant blessings to same-sex couples on a “case-by-case basis.” The decision emphasized that this practice would not supersede the sacrament of heterosexual marriage and could not take place during regular church rituals or liturgies. Blessings in the Catholic Church involve a priest or minister asking God for protection or favor for individuals. The open letter from the British priests expressed a commitment to reiterating the traditional values of the Church, confirming that these values are “unchanged and unchangeable.” The priests aimed to address the “widespread confusion” that followed the Vatican’s declaration. According to the letter, the priests saw no situation where blessing a same-sex couple could be properly distinguished from showing approval. They argued that such pastoral blessings are “pastorally and practically inadmissible.” Catholic dogma maintains that being attracted to someone of the same sex is not a sin, but engaging in homosexual acts is. Pope Francis, since assuming office in 2013, has taken steps to make the Church more inclusive to LGBTQ individuals without compromising the faith’s moral doctrine. Critics, including theology professor Ulrich L. Lehner from the University of Notre Dame, expressed concerns about the potential for misunderstanding and confusion arising from the Vatican’s guidance. Lehner even suggested that it might invite schism within the Church. However, the Vatican’s document emphasizes that the guidance aims to help individuals “increase their trust in God” and should not hinder this process.

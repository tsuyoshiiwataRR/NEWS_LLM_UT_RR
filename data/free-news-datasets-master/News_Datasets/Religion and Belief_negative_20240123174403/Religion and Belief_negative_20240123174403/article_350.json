    "text": "The Lebanese Minister of Labour Mustafa Bairam made the remarks in an interview with Mehr News Agency correspondent on the sidelines of the Tehran International Conference on Palestine on Sunday.\nThe events that are being witnessed in the Gaza Strip are considered a full-scale crime against humanity, Bairam said, adding, \"These crimes are not just happening against Muslims but against humanity, so all the countries of the world should take action against the genocide committed by the Zionist regime in Palestine.\"\nLebanon, in the current situation, is continuously paying for the continued aggression of the Zionist regime, the Lebanese politician said.\nElsewhere in his remarks, the Lebanese minister spoke about the confrontation of the Lebanese Resistance with the Zionists and said that Lebanon's Hezbollah Resistance movement has given many responses to the crimes of the Zionists and made them desperate.\"\nWith its operations, Hezbollah has been able to stop the Zionist regime from comprehensive and widespread aggression against Lebanon, which is considered a very important issue, he clarified.\nReferring to Iran's principled strategy of supporting all the oppressed nations, he said, \"In the past, Iran supported the people of South Africa to overthrow the apartheid regime, and today, with God's assistance, it will play a very important role in the destruction of the Zionist racist and apartheid regime from the Palestinian lands.\"\nAnswering a question about the future of the battle between Palestinians and the Israeli regime, he concluded, \"I believe that the current conflict and war in the Gaza Strip will end with the victory of the Palestinian nation and Resistance, which will ultimately lead to the realization of the great goals of the Palestinian nation in the formation of an independent state and the overthrow of the Zionist apartheid regime.\"\nReported by Marzieh Rahmani",

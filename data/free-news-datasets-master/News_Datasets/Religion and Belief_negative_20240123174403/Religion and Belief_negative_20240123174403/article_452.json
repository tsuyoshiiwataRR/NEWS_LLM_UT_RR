    "text": "General News of Sunday, 24 December 2023\nSource:\nmynewsgh.com\nProphet Dr. Kofi Oduro is of the view that\n[Parliament](/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=3205) needs to fast-track the process to pass the Anti-LGBTQI+ bill into law.\nHe believes the practice should not be countenanced in Ghana.\nThe prophet was speaking on Accra-based United Television when he made this known.\nTo him, if\n[Parliament](/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=3205) thinks that LGBTQI+ needs to be practised in Ghana, hence the delay, they should be shown acute videos of infections from LGBTQ+ engagements to help them understand how bad the situation is.\n“Have you seen someone who has had an acute infection from being gay or lesbian, among others? I think\n[Parliament](/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=3205) should be shown videos of such people who have had infections in their anus.\n\"I know someone who came to Alabaster and left for Holland. He now has a rotten anus from these things. It’s madness and should not be countenanced,” he said.\nHe continued “I will urge our\n[Parliament](/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=3205)arians that do the right thing and God will bless you. There is judgement awaiting all of us”.",

    "text": "West Bengal minister and TMC leader Udayan Guha on Sunday criticised a Gita recitation event in Kolkata's historical Brigade Parade Ground, saying that the event was \"political\" and the BJP was trying to garner Hindu votes through it. Notably, the BJP has denied this claim, saying that three apolitical organisations had planned the event.\"They are trying to garner more Hindu votes. People of India, especially Bengali people, do not like this politics,\" Guha said.The TMC leader added that it would have been more beneficial for young people if a sports event was held instead of a Gita recitation event.The gathering, which saw one lakh participants chanting from Bhagavad Gita in Kolkata, was organised by the \"Ek Lokho Konthe Geeta Path\" committee, an association of three organisations.The event, which was not officially a BJP program, saw the participation of several prominent BJP leaders from Bengal, including Leader of the Opposition in the assembly Suvendu Adhikari, State BJP president Sukanta Majumder, MP Dilip Ghosh, and Locket Chaterjee. Another TMC leader, Shashi Panja, criticised the BJP's involvement in the event, suggesting that the party was showing disrespect to Bengal's icons like Swami Vivekananda by misinterpreting his teachings on the importance of physical activity over spiritual study.â€œSwami Vivekananda once said that you will be nearer to heaven if you play football rather than study Gita. Today, what did we see? Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar showed disrespect to Swami Vivekananda's thoughts and his sayings,\" Panja said.The Bengal BJP president refuted allegations by the TMC leaders, saying \"This is not a program of the BJP. Three different organisations have come together for this. This is the cultural heritage of India as well as Bengal.\"CORRUPTION ALLEGATIONSBJP National Secretary Anupam Hazra on Sunday raised concerns over allegations made by a Facebook user about tickets for the recitation event being sold for Rs 1000.Taking to Facebook, Hazra shared a Facebook post by a man named Anil Singh who said that VIP passes for the Gita recitation event were being sold for Rs 1000 by BJP workers in Nalhati.\"If this is true, then it is fatal! Corruption even in recitation of Gita, are Hindus at all?\" wrote Hazra in another Facebook post, calling for a probe into the matter. He had tagged the Home Minister, Prime Minister and BJP president in his social media post.Notably, ahead of the event today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveyed his best wishes to the \"Lokkhe Konthe Gita Path\" gathering. He expressed optimism that the collective recitation of the Bhagavad Gita by a diverse gathering would not only foster social harmony but also inject energy into the nation's development journey. Although Modi was expected to attend the event today, he could not make it.Published By: Aditi SharmaPublished On: Dec 24, 2023ALSO READ | When 50% of people in Bengal will speak Urdu...: Kolkata Mayor's remark stirs rowMust Watch",

    "text": "Orthodox priests in Moldova rebel against Moscow rule \"This fight between Orthodox brother has outraged people.\" - priest said. Image: iStock\nLong torn between loyalty to the Russian or Romanian Orthodox Church, the Moldovan village of Cimiseni has made its choice, triggered by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.\nThe parish in the village near the capital Chisinau, whose 2,850 inhabitants mostly speak Romanian, is one of a growing number that have switched allegiance from Moscow to Bucharest.\nThe divorce mirrors the former Soviet Republic’s bigger struggle as it seeks to leave behind Russia’s influence and join the European Union.\n“This fight between Orthodox brothers has outraged people,” priest Ioan Solonaru told AFP, referring to the war in Ukraine.\nParishioners “started to tell me that they no longer wanted to come to Kirill’s church to receive communion”, said Solonaru, referring to Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the leader of Russia’s Orthodox Church and a staunch supporter of the invasion.\nRead more As the world witnesses geopolitical shifts, has Africa lost its voice? The reception of Ukrainian refugees pouring over the border has also raised awareness in Moldova.\nSince the invasion, more than 50 parishes have switched allegiance from Moscow to Bucharest, according to Moldova’s Romania-linked Metropolis of Bessarabia.\n“Nothing unites us with Moscow any more,” said the 55-year-old Solonaru, incredulous at “the nostalgia of some people for the USSR.”\nALSO READ: Kyiv reports increase in Russian overnight drone attacks\n‘Lost sons’ In a recent letter, Metropolitan Vladimir, head of the Russia-linked Metropolitanate of Moldova, expressed concern about the departure of priests.\nHe wrote to patriarch Kirill of the “marginalisation” of his church “because of its membership in the Moscow Patriarchate, perceived in Moldovan society as an outpost of the Kremlin”.\nThe Moldovan people aspire to get closer to Romania, he suggested, asking for a solution to “end the crisis”.\nA meeting of the highest dignitaries — held following the letter — decided to maintain their allegiance to Moscow.\nAround 1,350 parishes in Moldova are Moscow-linked, far more than some 200 with allegiance to Romania.\n“We do not feel in danger,” Ioan of Soroca, vicar of the Metropolitanate of Moldova, told AFP.\nThe Metropolitanate of Moldova has condemned the war in Ukraine — though not Kirill — with Bishop Ioan describing those who left as “lost sons (who) must come to their senses”.\nMetropolitan Vladimir said this week that their actions were “reckless.”\nALSO READ: Putin warns of ‘problems’ with Finland after NATO membership\n‘Pro-European signal’ Russia’s invasion of its neighbour in February 2022 has accelerated the pro-European drive in the country of 2.6 million people, situated between Ukraine and EU member Romania.\nThe Metropolis of Bessarabia is receiving newcomers “with open arms”, according to spokesman Constantin Olariu, just as Moldova is preparing to open accession negotiations with the EU.\n“It’s a pro-European signal,” he said, adding that his church had to resume its activities “from scratch” in 1992 following Moldova’s independence.\nPresident Maia Sandu sent a similar message, calling in a recent radio interview on “all of society, including the Church” to unite for “peace” on the path to European integration.\nThe war has also sowed division among Orthodox Christians in neighbouring Ukraine.\nIn October, Ukrainian lawmakers advanced legislation to ban the Moscow-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church — which says it has severed ties with Russia since May 2022.\nUkraine also passed legislation to move its official Christmas holiday to December 25, in a break with the Russian Orthodox Church that celebrates it on January 7.\nUkraine had been under Moscow’s spiritual leadership since the 17th century at the latest, but part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church broke with Moscow in 2019 over Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in the east of Ukraine.\nRead more on these topics church moscow Russia Russia Ukraine Catch up with the latest news from The Citizen on WhatsApp by following our channel.

    "text": "Gaza war darkens Bethlehem's Christmas traditions December 24, 2023 at 02:54 am EST Share STORY: The mayor of the Occupied West Bank city, Hanna Hanania, said, \"This Christmas comes to Bethlehem in a different shape. Nowadays, Bethlehem as any other Palestinian city is in mourning, we feel sad. So, in Bethlehem, the Municipal Council, we decided to cancel all festivities and celebration in Christmas season.\"\nIn place of the usual nativity scene, as Christians call the traditional display of figurines representing the holy family following the birth of Jesus, Bethlehem churches this year set the scene amid rubble and razor wire in solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n\"From this sacred place we convey a message of peace to all the leaders in the world that, there should be pressure to stop this war, to have the courage to say stop to the war, stop the blood, the killing and the revenge,\" a friar, Father Ibrahim Faltas, said as he attended the vigil.\nChristians make up around 2% of the population across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian territories, according to Protecting Holy Land Christians, a campaign organized by the Heads of Churches in Jerusalem, with a smaller proportion in Gaza.\n ",

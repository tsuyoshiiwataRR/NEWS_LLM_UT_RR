    "text": "A pro-Hamas mobster attacked the Christmas tree in San Francisco’s Union Square. The man, dressed in black, scaled the tree and posted anti-Christmas messages. The man also threw Christmas ornaments onto the ground. The demonstration reportedly attracted around 100 participants, some of whom carried signs that said “No Xmas as usual in a genocide” and “DA Jenkins drop all charges on the Bay Bridge 78.” The Christmas tree suffered significant damage. And as of Saturday night remained unlit. Watch videos of the protests below. TIRED OF BIG TECH CENSORSHIP?

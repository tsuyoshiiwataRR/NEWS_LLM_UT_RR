    "text": "By Ahmad El-Assasy\nIn a breaking news report, Cairo News Channel revealed that dozens of settlers have stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque under the protection of Israeli soldiers. This development adds to the ongoing tensions in the region.\nSimultaneously, the Israeli military continues its intense and unprecedented assault on the Gaza Strip, conducted via air, land, and sea.\nThis 79-day-long operation has resulted in thousands of casualties, predominantly children and women. Many victims remain trapped under rubble, unrescued due to the continuous bombing and the perilous conditions on the ground.\nThe situation is further exacerbated by a stringent blockade on the region, severely restricting the entry of fuel and critical urgent humanitarian aid, intensifying the dire humanitarian crisis.\nThe Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza has announced a devastating increase in casualties due to the Israeli offensive. Since October 7th, the death toll has surpassed 20,000, with more than 53,000 injured.\nAccording to Palestinian data, over 6,700 people are still missing under the rubble. Moreover, approximately 70% of housing units in Gaza have been destroyed.",

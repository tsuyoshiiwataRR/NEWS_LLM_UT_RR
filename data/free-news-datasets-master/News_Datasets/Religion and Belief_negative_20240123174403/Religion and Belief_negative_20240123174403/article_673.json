    "text": "Picture of the Christmas tree and the courtyard of the Church of the Nativity looks in limited numbers compared to previous years (Al Jazeera) Israel's war on the Gaza Strip for the third month in a row has cast a shadow over the atmosphere of Christmas celebrations in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, as it was decided not to light the Christmas tree in the courtyard of the Church of the Nativity as usual, and to replace it with a model of the scale of the destruction inflicted on the Strip. The sculpture, executed by Palestinian artist Tariq Sila, represents the Christmas Grotto amid what appeared to be a destroyed house, called \"Christmas under the rubble\" in a symbolic reference to the destruction in the Gaza Strip as a result of the continuous Israeli bombardment, in addition to statues of a Palestinian family during the Nakba. Candles were lit and prayers were held in the courtyard of the Church of the Nativity in the presence of a number of clerics, officials, members of the diplomatic corps accredited to the Palestinian Authority and citizens. Hanna Hanania, mayor of Bethlehem, said during the opening ceremony of the artwork, \"Here Gaza is present, the cave is not ordinary, it is destroyed by the bombing, between its walls embraces the Holy Family through its shape that resembles the map of Gaza, and the children who rose as martyrs like angels looking from the sky.\" Exceptional year \"The light of the cave here is very dimmed because of the shelling and death, and in the middle the Virgin Mary embraces the baby Jesus, announcing the new life of all humanity,\" he said. \"Everything is exceptional this year, as Christmas falls under very difficult circumstances, in which thousands have been killed and wounded and citizens in Gaza have been displaced,\" he said. \"Bethlehem, for the first time, does not light the Christmas tree, will not light the streets of Bethlehem, and the holiday will be limited to religious rites only, is a moral and national obligation, the failure of blood misses any possibility of joy,\" he added. Bethlehem residents used to start Christmas celebrations by lighting an 8-meter-high tree in the churchyard decorated with lamps. \"The world celebrates Christmas and the city of Christmas is sad, gloomy and painful, its children, youth, women and men are scared, sad and pained by what is happening, and they do not know where things will go,\" said Rola Maaya, Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, in a speech at the cave lighting ceremony. The road leading to the Church of the Nativity Square in the center of Bethlehem was previously crowded with tourist delegations and today it is almost empty (Al-Jazeera) Bethlehem without visitors \"The city of the nativity, like other Palestinian cities, is completely besieged. Closed and sad that no one can reach or get out of. Its people and people are without work and without hope, as a result of the disruption and cessation of incoming tourism, which is the backbone of its economy.\" George Kanawati, leader of the Terra Santa Scouts group, the organizer of religious rites at Christmas, said four groups would participate and advance the patriarch's procession with 4 scouts. George added that the scouts would raise the Palestinian flag and carry banners with phrases condemning the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip written in different languages. Celebrations for Christian denominations that adopt the Western calendar will be held on December 25, while denominations that adopt the Eastern calendar will celebrate on January 7. Since October 7, the Israeli army has been waging a devastating war on Gaza, which as of Saturday evening has left more than 20,53 dead, more than , wounded, mostly children and women, massive destruction of infrastructure and an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe, according to the Gaza authorities and the United Nations.

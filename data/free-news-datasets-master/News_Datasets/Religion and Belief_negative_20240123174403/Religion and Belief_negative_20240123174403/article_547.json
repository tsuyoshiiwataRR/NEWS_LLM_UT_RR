    "text": "Gombe State Governor and Chairman of Northern States Governors’ Forum, Alhaji Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya, has been challenged to prove he is not anti-christians by releasing from prison custody seven detainees arrested since 2021 after the crises that followed the selection of Mai Tangle in Billiri LGA. The call was made by the Labour Party Gubernatorial candidate for Gombe State in the 2023 elections, Keftin Amuga, who urged Inuwa to release the seven remaining detainees he described as ‘political prisoners of conscience’ in the spirit of the Christmas season. Governor Inuwa was roundly condemned for insisting on installing the current occupier of the Royal stool, Sanusi Maishanu, against Dr. Musa Idris Maiyamba, who polled five out of the nine votes cast by the Tangale Kingmakers. Maishanu, it was alleged, got only two votes. Amuga, in a press statement issued to felicitate with Christians in the Yuletide obtained by our correspondent appealed to Governor Inuwa that the continued incarceration of the detainees supports arguments that the All Progressive Congress is anti-christianity. Recall that the viral protest in 2021 by residents of Billiri LGA over Governor Inuwa’s insistence of the defeated Maishanu, led to destruction of lives and property worth millions of naira. However, Amuga in his statement said, “I wish to appeal to Gombe State Governor, Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya to kindly consider and release the political prisoners of conscience associated with the crises over the appointment of the Mai Tangle who have been incarcerated since 2021. “This heartfelt call is crucial to dispel any notion that the Governor’s actions were religiously motivated to persecute the Christian Majority Tangale people. “It is worth noting that the presumed candidate who secured the majority of votes, Dr Musa Idris Maiyamba, receiving five out of the total nine votes, and all the detainees are of the Christian faith”, he implored The former Gubernatorial candidate called upon the Governor to heed his plea to put to rest such misconceptions about him (Inuwa) that he and his APC party are anti-christians. Amuga also called on all elected and appointed politicians, regardless of primordial cleavages and partisanship, to join him in urging the Governor, “to release these prisoners of conscience as a mark of respect and tolerance towards Christians during this significant Christmas season. “By doing so, it create an atmosphere of cordial religious tolerance and further enable these individuals to celebrate the occasion with their families,” Amuga added. The Labour Party’s 2023 Gubernatorial Candidate implored all religious leaders, particularly Christian leaders, to live up to their calling, adding “by following in the footsteps of the Prophets of old by divinely speaking out against what is wrong, particularly the continuous incarceration of these detainees. “Their influential voices can play a pivotal role in advancing the cause of righteousness and thereby advocating and establishing Justice for all. “As we celebrate this joyous season, I wish to encourage all Christians, where possible, to support their prayers with fasting in seeking for the unconditional release of the detainees. “Together, let us engage in soul-searching, thought-provoking, and prayerful Christmas and New Year celebrations”, Keftin Amuga maintained.

    "text": "The head of the Roman Catholic Church and the Vatican, Pope Francis, said that he continues to receive serious and painful news from the Gaza Strip, where, he said, unarmed civilians are the target of bombings and shootings. As part of the traditional Sunday prayer, the Pope addressed the faithful in St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican and once again appealed for an end to the war in the “Holy Land”. “Let us not forget our brothers and sisters who suffer from wars in Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, and other conflict zones. May the approach of Christmas strengthen efforts to open paths to peace,” the Pope said. Francis also spoke about the Israeli army’s attacks on Christians and churches in the Gaza Strip. Pointing out that unarmed civilians are exposed to bombing and shooting, Pope Francis stated that this happened even inside the Holy Family parish complex, where there are no terrorists, but families, children, people who are sick or disabled, and nuns. “A mother, Mrs. Nahida Khalil Anton, and her daughter Samar Kamal Anton, were killed by snipers while they were going to the toilet and many people were wounded. The home of Mother Teresa’s nuns was damaged, and the generator was hit. Some say this is terrorism, this is war. Yes. It is war. It is terrorism,” the pope emphasized, [N1](https://n1info.ba/svijet/papa-franjo-o-situaciji-u-gazi-jeste-ovo-je-rat-ovo-je-terorizam/) writes. E.Dz.",

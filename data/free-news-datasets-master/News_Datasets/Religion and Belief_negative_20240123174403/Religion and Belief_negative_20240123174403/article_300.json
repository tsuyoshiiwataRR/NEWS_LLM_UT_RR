    "text": "Chandigarh: In two minds since Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal apologised to the Sikhs for the 2015 Bargari sacrilege and implored his defectors to rejoin the party, the breakaway SAD (Sanyukt) on Sunday decided to form a committee to collect internal feedback on this proposition in a couple of weeks.After Sukhbir had on February 14 apologised to the Sikh community for his old government’s failure to arrest the Bargari accused, SAD (Sanyukt) president and former Union minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa had appreciated this move. Three days later, he had assembled the party’s decision makers at its Mohali office, where his son and former Punjab finance minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa authorised him to form this committee to know how the district units read the situation. Dhindsa has left the final decision to the consensus of this report. We also published the following articles recentlySGPC poll, SAD selections confirm Sukhbirs controlSAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal maintains firm control of the party despite questions about his leadership. He single-handedly decides appointments and maintains an iron grip on the party's organizational structure. Sukhbir follows a model similar to that of his father, Parkash Singh Badal, by promoting new leaders and sidelining dissenting voices. The rival faction led by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa has not been able to gain influence, and Sukhbir has even won back some leaders who previously left him. However, Sukhbir's biggest challenge is regaining the trust of the Sikh electorate who turned away from the Badals.106140159Ready to strengthen SAD if Badal quits as party chief: Bibi Jagir KaurSukhbir Singh Badal appeals for leaders who left Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) to rejoin; Bibi Jagir Kaur sticks to her stand, ready to work for party's revival if Badal steps down and reforms are made; Kaur was expelled from SAD last year; Kaur suggests Badal apologize and revoke expulsion order; Kaur emphasizes need for another Akali leader to head the party; Kaur highlights importance of strengthening SAD and Sikh institutions; Kaur declines attending Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa's party leaders meeting for SAD's revival.106225629'Congress will form government in Odisha' says Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee President Sarat PatnaikOdisha Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) President Sarat Patnaik announced that Congress will form the government in Odisha, ending the 24-year rule of Naveen Patnaik's BJD government.

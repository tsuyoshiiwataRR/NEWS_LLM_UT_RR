    "text": "Two New York synagogues have been searched by police after bomb threats caused panic on Christmas Eve. Police scoured the Shaare Zion Temple in Brooklyn and Riverdale Jewish Center in the Bronx at around 6.15am Sunday following a 911 call, NYPD told DailyMail.com. The department was unable to share any details about the threats the synagogues received but said they are believed to have been sent via email. 'Officers responded and searched the buildings and found no devices,' an NYPD spokesman said. 'Nothing was found.' Police scoured the Shaare Zion Temple in Brooklyn and Riverdale Jewish Center in the Bronx at around 6.15am Sunday following a 911 call about bomb threats they received on Christmas Eve, NYPD told DailyMail.com. (Pictured: an NYPD patrol car parked outside a Lower East Side synagogue) The department said cops would continue 'canvassing and patrolling' the areas hit by the latest swatting incidents - which is when people call the emergency services about false threats. Hundreds of synagogues across America have been targeted with menacing messages about fake bombs since Hamas slaughtered around 1,200 people in Israel on October 7. Last weekend, a nationwide swatting spree sent threats to almost 200 Jewish institutions in what the FBI believe was part of a coordinated effort by a foreign group. In a confidential memo to partner law enforcement agencies, Assistant FBI Director Cathy Milhoan said: 'At this time, based on similar language and specific email tradecraft used, it appears the perpetrators of these threats are connected. 'Additionally, these threats appear to be originating from outside of the United States.' Between Friday and Saturday last week, 199 swatting incidents and false bomb threats were tracked by the Secure Community Network, a non-profit that informs US Jewish institutions of security and safety. On Monday, the non-profit organization reported that there were 93 swatting incidents in California , 62 in Arizona , 15 in Connecticut, five in Colorado and four in Washington the past 24 hours. Pennsylvania and Mississippi also received false threats this past weekend, while Alabama had six reported on Saturday alone. The SCN said that compared to this time last year, they have logged more than 449 swatting incidents. These occurrences have happened 541 percent more than they did in 2022. The Shir Ami synagogue in Pennsylvania evacuated their Hebrew school on Thursday after a bomb threat. Police and K-9 dogs did not find any evidence of a bomb 'We continue to work in coordination with law enforcement and Jewish security partners to respond to incidents & ensure Jewish communities across North America have the tools and guidance to respond appropriately,' SCN said in a post on X. On Thursday, the Congregation Shir Ami located in Newton, Pennsylvania, was forced to evacuate its Hebrew school after they received bomb threats. The synagogue's executive director received the threat via email as it requested ransom money be dropped off at a location approximately two hours away. 'We evacuated our building, our preschool, and pretty much put our emergency plan into place,' Rabbi Charles Briskin told USA TODAY . Once police inspected the building with explosive detective dogs for about two hours, the evacuation was lifted. Briskin said that this was the first time that their institution ever experienced a threat. 'There seems to be a particular ramp up in the activity over the last several days,' the Rabbi said. He also mentioned that when he received the email, two other colleagues that he was with, from other places, got the same message sent to them.",

    "text": "(Trinidad Express) She was the first of six children to attend university and her family had hoped she would achieve her dreams of becoming an attorney.\nSomething, however, happened a week ago that changed the course of Khadeeja Taylor’s life. It led to her death on Thursday morning.\nAn autopsy performed at the San Fernando Mortuary concluded the 22-year-old died from hypovolaemic shock and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\nHypovolaemic shock occurs when a person loses a significant amount of fluid or blood, which prevents the heart from pumping blood throughout the body. It can cause organs to stop functioning, according to United States-based multispecialty academic medical centre Cleveland Clinic.\nPeople who experience hypovolaemic shock lose more than 20 per cent of the amount of fluid in their body, which could be from a severe injury (cuts or burns), internal bleeding, vomiting or diarrhoea.\nHer mother, Jennifer Sandy-Taylor, is not convinced her child died from a medical emergency. According to Sandy-Taylor, her daughter appeared to be possessed by a demon, causing her to become violent and uncontrollable.\nKhadeeja was receiving treatment from a spiritual healer in Siparia and she began foaming at the mouth around 2 a.m. on Thursday.\nShe was taken to the Siparia District Hospital, where she died later that morning.\nIn an interview with the Express yesterday, Sandy-Taylor told a story of how her “perfectly normal” little girl turned into a “demon” within days. And to those who do not believe it, Sandy-Taylor said, “You would not understand until you experience it.”\nThe Express also spoke with Khadeeja’s elder sister, Shenice, who said her sister was a brilliant person who had big dreams and never allowed anything to distract her. “She was the first one in the family to go to university (The University of the West Indies). She was bright from kindergarten. She attended the Seventh Day Adventist Secondary School where she was the valedictorian. She wanted to pursue law and she was always studying. She never went to parties and she was the kindest person you will ever meet,” she said.\nShenice said her sister never took shortcuts, and worked hard for everything she accomplished.\nKhadeeja went from “the perfect child” to someone her family did not recognise, she said.\nThe Express was told Khadeeja stayed with relatives in St James and worked part-time while at university.\nLast Monday, Sandy-Taylor called her daughter, but said she did not recognise the person she was speaking with. Taylor told her mother she had not been eating or sleeping.\nThe mother immediately went to her daughter and brought her to their Ibis Drive, Pleasantville, home.\n“But she became aggressive, shouting, screaming, becoming violent, her speech was unrecognisable and we knew something was wrong,” she said.\nRelatives said Khadeeja was hurting herself: pulling out her hair, banging her head against the wall and claiming to be the devil. When she was challenged, it is alleged she attacked her mother. But Sandy-Taylor did not give up.\nShe went to a spiritual healer in Siparia, where prayers were held and Taylor began showing signs of improvement, the mother said. On Wednesday night, however, Khadeeja’s condition deteriorated and she began having difficulty breathing.\nShe was taken to hospital, and died hours later.",

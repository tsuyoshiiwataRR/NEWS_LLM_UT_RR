    "text": "Archimandrite Abdullah July described the meeting of the Patriarchs in Herzog as shocking (Al Jazeera) JERUSALEM – The heads of the churches of Jerusalem did not receive their statement, in which they explained why they participated in a meeting with Israeli President Isaac Herzog ahead of Christmas. The meeting sparked outrage and criticism. The heads of the churches stressed in their statement that they demanded during their visit to \"stop the waterfall of blood\" in Gaza, and that \"everything that is addressed outside this framework is aimed at distorting the image of Christians and churches, and to serve political agendas that churches refrain from delving into or addressing.\" This meeting, which was held last Thursday, did not go unnoticed, especially as it quoted Isaac Herzog as saying that \"the forces of evil carried out barbaric and sadistic attacks,\" in reference to the seventh of last October, and that he expects \"the leaders of the Christian world to strongly condemn the atrocities of Hamas, and to support our efforts to eradicate evil\" in the Holy Land, as he put it. And began Archimandrite Abdullah July – former head of the monastery of Roman Melkites Catholics in Ramallah – speaking to Al Jazeera Net, describing the meeting of the patriarchs Herzog \"shocking\", because the heads of churches who met with him are the same who took a position that there are no greetings and manifestations of celebration this year, given the situation that the country is going through. Jerusalem church leaders meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Thursday (social media) No wisdom in visiting \"It was not necessary to go there because our people are being slaughtered, and the visit is not appropriate, and if there is an annual protocol as they say, and if we assume in good faith that the visit was aimed at demanding an end to the bloodshed in Gaza, a little wisdom would have been enough not to organize it,\" July said. The Archimandrite touched on the fact that Christians are an integral part of the Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic nations, adding that they are not just minorities and sects, and their presence is emergency, but rather they are a historical and authentic part of the nation, and their position is clear towards the cause with which they are associated. July pointed out that the \"Ramallah Youth Club\" organized on Saturday a stand rejecting the visit, during which the picture of one Christian cleric, Bishop Hilarion Capuch, nicknamed the \"Guardian of Jerusalem\", was raised, a Syrian cleric who dedicated his life defending the Palestinian cause, until Israel arrested him and sentenced him to 12 years in prison. \"The image of this bishop, years after his departure, was raised so that the Palestinians would say that this man is our address, and this is what we want the cleric to be in the country. He must be part of the people, their concerns and their aspirations.\" For his part, began researcher in the history of the Orthodox Church Elif Sabbagh speaking – Al Jazeera Net – describing the visit as \"defective\", and the behavior of what they call themselves spiritual presidency of Christians \"outrageous and sedition that serves only the occupation\", and stressed that it is not permissible to turn a blind eye to this visit nor tolerate those who carried it out \"because they went to shake hands with the killer in order to acquit him. We don't tolerate the killer and we don't shake his hand.\" According to writer and specialist in Israeli affairs, Elif Sabbagh, this visit comes after a two-week postponement, because Israel wanted it in conjunction with the celebration of Christmas, to use it to its advantage in front of European and American public opinion, to say that there is no problem between it and the Christians, and to absolve itself again of the bombing of the Baptist Hospital and other Christian properties in the Gaza Strip. Sabbagh added, \"What happened at the Baptist Hospital should not be forgotten, and what happened from the sniping in the Latin Monastery cannot be overlooked, and the killing of people in the Gaza Strip should not be tolerated, and we consider the Christian clerics who met with Herzog as occupiers like the Israeli occupation, because they are foreigners and do not understand the dignity of the Palestinian people or their rights, and they cooperate with the occupation, because they are part of it.\" Committee to follow up the behavior of clerics Within the framework of the Christian movements against this visit, Sabbagh confirmed that several meetings were held in Palestine and abroad, during which a number of Christian personalities and activists met, and it was agreed to establish a follow-up committee, which includes worldly and non-religious figures, to follow up on the behavior of Christian clerics and their relationship with the Israeli occupation. The follow-up committee will be a general committee that includes all Christian communities in the Middle East and will work within a long-term program that ensures that the behavior of the clergy that only serves Israel is not silenced or overlooked. Sabbagh said, \"We have been fighting for many years to have the heads of our churches in Palestine as Arabs and not foreigners, so why do we see the head of the Russian church, Russia, Germany, Germany and Greek Greek? We are required to have the heads of churches in Palestine to be foreigners. The answer is that our problem lies in the Jordanian and Palestinian political authority, which supports foreigners at the expense of the rights of Arab churchchildren.\" Sabbagh concluded his speech to Al Jazeera Net by saying that \"if these really want to serve Christians and defend them in Palestine, why did not we see them serious movement when the settlers took the habit of spitting almost daily on the cross and clergy, in Jerusalem in particular and Palestine in general?\" \"They were calling for tolerance at the time,\" the same spokesman replied, wondering whether their recent visit to Isaac Herzog was also part of tolerance or ignoring the tragedy experienced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. It is noteworthy that the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) denounced this meeting, and said in a statement, \"We were shocked by the image of Christian leaders in the occupied Palestinian territories, as they meet with the head of the Zionist entity on the occasion of Christmas, especially since none of them spoke about the difficult times our people are going through, due to the crimes of genocide and crimes of ethnic cleansing.\" \"We believe that this Christian leadership, with this behavior, does not represent our people in all its sects,\" the statement said.

    "text": "British Journalist Douglas Murray Demolishes Progressive Cenk Uygur in Debate Over Israel and Hamas\n“As far as I can see, you’re very ill-traveled as well as rather ill-lettered and ill-spoken”\n14 Comments\nJournalist and author Douglas Murray appeared opposite Cenk Uygur of the ‘Young Turks’ on the Piers Morgan program this week to talk about the Israel/Hamas conflict. Uygur is a progressive and holds pretty much every left wing view on the topic one could imagine. Murray’s view is more in line with conservatives.\nUnfortunately for Uygur, this was not even close to a fair fight. Murray made Uygur look like the president of the high school Democrats debating a renowned expert.\nSpencer Brown writes at\nTownhall:\nWATCH: Three Straight Minutes of Douglas Murray Absolutely Destroying Cenk Uygur on Israel and Hamas\nToo often, since October 7, the anti-Israel Hamas-sympathizing figures in the media have had their lies and propaganda go unchecked. But on “Piers Morgan Uncensored” this week, Cenk Uygur was roundly put in his place by bestselling author and columnist Douglas Murray in a righteously indignant takedown.\nPoking holes all through Uygur’s arguments — and therefore also the smears being lobbed by his ilk — Murray demonstrated how vapid the catchphrase-y calls from those who seem enthused by the prospect of Hamas living to fight another day truly are.\nAfter Uygur retreated to the usual talking points about needing a “two-state solution” and called Israel’s supporters — including Murray — a “monster” supporting “genocide” and not caring about civilian deaths in Gaza, Murray let him have it after correctly pointing out Uygur is “just a very low-rent racist.”\n“Yes, I do care — I care very deeply about it,” Murray said in response to Uygur’s claim that he didn’t care about the death of Gazan children. “But I also know that the responsibility for their deaths lies on Hamas which has misgoverned their society for the last 16 years and now has been leading the country into being in a war with Israel. Yes, it’s on Hamas, this.”…\n“As far as I can see, you’re very ill-traveled as well as rather ill-lettered and ill-spoken, and I mentioned that I cover wars and go to wars because I happen to think myself that it’s worth seeing things with your own eyes including things that you don’t particularly like but you report the truth,” Murray explained. “I don’t know if you ever even leave your own bedroom.”\nMurray goes on to cite numerous other conflicts involving Muslims and points out that Uygur never talks about those situations because Jews are not involved.\nHere’s the short version:\n\"If there was an election tomorrow in the West Bank, Hamas would win.\"\nTensions rise as Douglas Murray and Cenk Uygur debate the Israel-Hamas war.\n[@DouglasKMurray]| [@CenkUygur]| [@piersmorgan]| [#PMU] [pic.twitter.com/8q1U8JoGVh]\n— Piers Morgan Uncensored (@PiersUncensored)\n[December 21, 2023]\nHere’s the full segment, if you’d like to watch it:\nThis is getting lots of attention on Twitter/X:\nHello 911, I’d like to report a murder.\n[pic.twitter.com/rBK0rSfAZo]\n— Rita Panahi (@RitaPanahi)\n[December 22, 2023]\nI loved every second of\n[@DouglasKMurray]outclassing Cenk Uygur on [@piersmorgan].

Brilliant speaker.\n— FilmLadd (@FilmLadd)\n[December 22, 2023]\nDouglas Murray just MURDERED Chunk Uygur.\n— Kat Kanada (@KatKanada_TM)\n[December 22, 2023]\nSomeone seriously should have called 911 and reported this on-air verbal massacre 🔥🔥🔥\n— Bongino Report (@BonginoReport)\n[December 22, 2023]\nLast word goes to Douglas Murray.\nOh Cenk. I gave you so many facts. The problem was you didn’t know any of them. And because you’ve never travelled anywhere and don’t know anything it came as a shock to you. But do go out. There’s a whole world beyond your bedroom.\n[@cenkuygur]\n— Douglas Murray (@DouglasKMurray)\n[December 22, 2023]\nFeatured image via\nYouTube.

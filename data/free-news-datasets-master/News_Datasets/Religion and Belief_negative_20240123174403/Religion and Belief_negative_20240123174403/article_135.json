    "text": "Articles and letters may be edited for the purposes of clarity and space.\nAttacks on Christians\nSince the end of the British colonial rule and the partitioning of India in 1947, Christians in India have undergone an escalating series of attacks encouraged by the growth and rise to power of Hindu nationalism. The predominate religion in India is Hinduism, followed by Islam and Christianity. In this country of over one billion people, there are substantial numbers of other religions like Jainism and Sikhism too.\nChristians represent only 2.5 per cent of the total population in India. However, attacks on Christians continue to take place in the country every now and then. The attacks are not limited to rural areas only but have occurred in other cities and states as well like Delhi, Mumbai, Jharkhand, Kerala, Karnataka and Goa.\nThere are also reports appearing in newspapers and on some television channels that Christians keep converting Hindus and Muslims to Christianity by force. I would like to inform readers that these reports are totally untrue. We Christians do not change the religion of another person; we only change their lives. We also do not give money to Hindus and Muslims to change their religion. No Hindu or Muslim is forced or lured to come and pray in the church.\nThey go there out of their own free will because they find peace, serenity and solace there, and also miracles happening in their lives. If they change their religion, it is out of their own free will and not by force. The pastors of the New Life, Baptist and other Christian denomination churches only lay their hands on the person’s head and prays for his or her healing.\nJust because we Christians are peace-loving people and do not retaliate, it does not mean that the BJP, the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh), the Bajrang Dal and the Shiv Sena can take an upper hand on us.\nJUBEL D’CRUZ\nMumbai, India\nMerry Christmas!\nChristmas, with its name originating from the mass of Jesus, stands as a universal symbol of peace and love. Celebrated around the world with unparalleled joy and happiness, it is a festival eagerly awaited by people from diverse cultures. The global anticipation for this famous festival builds up well in advance, with preparations commencing as early as November.\nOn the cherished day of December 25, Christians globally come together to commemorate the birth of Jesus Christ. The festive spirit permeates the air, transforming communities and homes into vibrant expressions of celebration. Streets sparkle with colourful lights, homes are adorned with festive decorations and Christmas trees become focal points of merriment.\nThe essence of Christmas extends beyond the material aspects of celebration; it embodies a deeper sense of unity, compassion and goodwill. Families, irrespective of cultural backgrounds, gather to partake in traditions that have been passed down through generations. It is a time for reflection, gratitude and an appreciation of the shared human experience.\nAs the world collectively embraces the Christmas season, the spirit of giving and kindness takes centre stage. Individuals exchange heartfelt greetings, gifts and acts of generosity, reinforcing the sense of community that defines this festive period. The significance of Christmas lies not only in the rituals but also in the connections forged and strengthened during this time.\nIn this season of blessings, my heartfelt wish is that your home be illuminated with the warmth of light and resounds with the joyous echoes of laughter. May the spirit of Christmas bring peace to your heart and create lasting memories with your family. As we exchange good wishes and celebrate together, let us embrace the true essence of Christmas – a celebration of love, hope and the enduring beauty of shared moments. Wishing you and your loved ones a Merry Christmas filled with profound joy, abundant blessings and the spirit of togetherness.\nIMRAN PATRAS\nBahawalpur",

    "text": "Hedy E. Houghton, 75, of Willow Street, went home to be with her Lord and Savior on Monday, December 18, 2023 at Hospice and Community Care in Mount Joy. She was born in Millersville and was the wife of Earl R. Houghton, Jr. Hedy worked as a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) for over 40 years. This career allowed her to touch the lives of many and she was passionate about the work she did. Hedy was a member of Pequea Church and was actively involved in children's ministry. She enjoyed reading and could always be found with a book in her hands. She loved her family and the time they spent together. But she especially loved her grandkids. In addition to her husband, Earl, she is survived by her daughters, Richelle M. (Travis) Boston, and Karen L. (Thomas) Karr; her siblings, Donna (Phil) Crouse, Mary Burger, and Rick (Brenda) Albright; and 10 grandchildren. Friends and family will be received from 9 AM to 11 AM on Saturday, December 30, 2023 at Pequea Church, 40 Church Rd., Lancaster, PA 17603. A memorial service will follow beginning at 11 AM. Interment will be held privately at the convenience of the family. In addition to flowers, memorial contributions may be made in Hedy's name to Pequea Church Children's Ministry at the address listed above.

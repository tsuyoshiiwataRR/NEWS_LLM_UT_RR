    "text": "Pro-Vita & Famiglia (Pro-Life and Family), a pro-life group, has launched a petition asking the Bishop of Avellino to intervene. The organization has already collected over 23,000 signatures. The offensive nativity is on display at the Church of Saints Peter and Paul, in Capocastello di Mercogliano, in the province of Avellino. “I wanted to show with this scene that families are no longer just the traditional ones,” Father Vitaliano Della Sala told Reuters . “In our parishes we see more and more children from the new types of families that exist and are part of our society, children of separated and divorced people, gay couples, single people, young mothers.” According to the report, Father Della Sala is known for supporting the LGBT community and far-left causes. To defend the nativity, Father Della Sala pointed to Pope Francis’ announcement earlier this month that allows priests to bless same-sex couples. Immagina di entrare in una chiesa e di trovarti di fronte un presepe con i pastori, l’asinello, il bue, Gesù, la Madonna e… la sua compagna lesbica.

The Bishop of Avellino, Monsignor Arturo Aiello, intervenes against the LGBT provocation of a Baby Jesus with ‘two mothers’!” Senator Maurizio Gasparri, of the co-ruling Forza Italia party, told Reuters that the nativity scene “offends all those who always had respect and devotion for the Holy Family.”",

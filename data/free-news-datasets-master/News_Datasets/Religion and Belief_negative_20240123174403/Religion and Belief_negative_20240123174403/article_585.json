    "text": "PETALING JAYA: Supposed threats against Islam and Malays are the tales of \"the ghost in the tree\" which no one sees, but is feared, says Parti Amanah Nasional (Amanah) president Datuk Seri Mohamad Sabu.\nThe Agriculture and Food Security Minister said this was why the Opposition coalition Perikatan Nasional managed to peddle these threats and win seats in the last general and state elections.\nHe was referring to the shift of Malay votes, popularly known as the “Green wave”, to the Perikatan Malay-based parties of PAS and Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia.\nMohamad said this on Sunday (Dec 24), the second and last day of the Amanah national convention held in Klang, Selangor.\n“The issues of Islam being threatened and Malay rights not guaranteed are two issues which are very attractive which were played by the Opposition who won the votes.\n“It is like saying there is a ghost in a tree and those who pass by under it feel scared even though they have never seen the ghost,” said Mohamad.\nHe also said that those who are calling others unbelievers are not from different religions but Muslims themselves against each other.\nMohamad said that it was a given to be criticised by party members but he takes it all in his stride as a leader.\nHe was referring to a few delegates who have criticised the Amanah leaders for giving in to other parties during the last general election.\nMohamad said that last-minute changes had to be made to ensure that Pakatan Harapan coalition, of which Amanah is part of, won the seat in the last few state elections even though Amanah had to give way to PKR.\nHe also said that Amanah would be able to win six or seven seats in Kelantan, Terengganu and Kedah in the next general elections.\n“We have four more years to reach this win,” said Mohamad.\nIn his speech, he also said that the proposal of local government polls, which has yet to be introduced, should be a win-win for all races and those elected be able to do the work for the people and not for their party leaders.\nLast week, Federal Territories DAP chairperson Tan Kok Wai had proposed to restore local council elections - permanently suspended since 1976.\nAmanah is currently a ruling party at the federal level as part of the Pakatan Harapan coalition.\nOpen Modal ×",

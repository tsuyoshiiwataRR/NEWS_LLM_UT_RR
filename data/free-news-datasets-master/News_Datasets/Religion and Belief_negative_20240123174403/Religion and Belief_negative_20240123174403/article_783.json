    "text": "KAMPALA – The battle for the control of Uganda Muslim Supreme Council (UMSC) continues.\nThe latest development is the suspension of Deputy Mufti Sheikh Abdallah Ssemambo following a petition endorsed by 15 members of the national executive committee.\nHe was suspended by UMSC national chairperson, Prof. Dr. Muhammad Lubega Kisambira on Friday.\nLast Tuesday, a section of UMSC had swore in Ssemambo as acting Mufti to replace embattled Sheikh Shaban Ramadan Mubajje over sale of Muslim properties.\nIn his letter addressed to Ssemambo, Lubega noted that his suspension, effective immediately, requires him, among others, to receive half his salary until the impeachment process concludes.\nDuring his suspension, Ssemambo is barred from his office and required to surrender all official UMSC items in his possession.\n“Be notified that the chairperson of the UMSC has received a petition of impeachment against you under Article 11(1) of the UMSC this 22nd day of December 2023,” said Lubega in the letter.\n“The petitioners fault you for conducting yourself in a manner unbefitting of your office and abrogating the constitution of UMSC contrary to Article 5(14) of the said constitution.”\nSsemambo was further informed, “that you are required to file and serve on the chairperson in triplicate a written reply within seven working days from the date of receipt of the petition”.\nLubega informed Ssemambo that a UMSC joint session comprising the national executive committee and College of Imminent Sheikhs will meet after seven days to hear the accusations against him.\nMahmood Kateregga, who is among the 15 petitioners, listed three grounds for Ssemambo’s impeachment.\nThe group accuses Ssemambo of participating in irregular proceedings that saw him sworn in as acting Mufti of Uganda, disregarding the UMSC constitution, and his involvement in the purported suspension of the substantial Mufti of Uganda and UMSC chairperson.\nJudiciary reacts\nOn Friday, the Judiciary said court had not authorized Ssemambo to act as the Mufti of Uganda, urging “all concerned persons to remain calm and act responsibly”.\n“The attention of the Judiciary has been drawn to misleading reports by sections of media alleging that the High Court on Thursday December 21 agreed with the decision of the Resident Judge Jinja in Company Cause No. 002 of 2023 that resulted in the appointment of Sheikh Abudallah Ssemambo as the Acting Mufti of Uganda Supreme Council,” it said in a statement.\n“This is to clarify that Hon. Lady Justice Alexandra Nkonge Rugadya halted the execution and implementation of the resolutions of the General Assembly made on December 16 and December 17 that resulted in the appointment of Sheikh Ssemambo as Acting Mufti pending the determination of the application by the same judge who made the orders under the law for Review of Court Orders.”\nThe statement further noted; “Relatedly, Miscellaneous Applications No. 309 of 2023, No.306 of 2023 and No.307 of 2023 have been referred back to Jinja High Court for hearing and determination.\nThe Judiciary, therefore, appeals to the parties and all concerned persons to remain calm and act responsibly, as we wait for the decision of the Court in Jinja.”\nThe Judiciary’s clarification came in the wake of Tuesday’s swearing-in of Ssemambo as acting Mufti.\nIt followed a vote by the UMSC General Assembly that forced Mubajje to step aside to pave way for investigations into the alleged sale of Ssembabule land.\nHajji Abbas Sekyanzi Muluubya, the UMSC general secretary, dismissed the election, arguing that Article 5 of the council’s constitution states that the removal of the Mufti from office can only occur through a joint session of the executive committee and the Majlis Al-Ulama or the College of Sheikhs.\nMuluubya noted that UMSC is operating normally and officially recognizes only one Mufti: Mubajje.\nProvided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

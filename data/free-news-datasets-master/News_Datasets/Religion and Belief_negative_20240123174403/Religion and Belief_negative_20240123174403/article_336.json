    "text": "US Lawmakers Condemn Vandalism of Hindu Temple in California US Lawmakers Unite Against Vandalism of Hindu Temple The recent vandalism of the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Hindu Temple in Newark, California has sparked strong condemnation from several US lawmakers, including prominent Indian-American Congressmen. The act of vandalism, which included anti-India graffiti, has prompted calls for accountability and unity against bigotry. Community Action Against Hate Congressman Ro Khanna and other lawmakers have emphasized the importance of standing united against acts of intolerance and vandalism. The communityâ€™s response to remove the graffiti has been highlighted as an example of answering wickedness with goodness. Call for Swift Action Congressman Shri Thanedar has called for a thorough investigation into the vandalism, emphasizing the fundamental tenets of religious freedom and communal harmony in the nation. Law enforcement has been urged to take swift action to bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure the safety of all places of worship.",

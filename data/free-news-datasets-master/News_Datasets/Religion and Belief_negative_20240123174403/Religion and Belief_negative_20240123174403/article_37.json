    "text": "Hi, this is from Hanks's The Making of Another Major Motion Picture Masterpiece.\nWhat are koombies?\nB Camera was going into a storefront to get an angle of Firefall crossing through frame, something with some soft-focus koombies in silhouette in the foreground.\n“Yeah,” Bill said. “Go to B, please.” Just like that, B Camera was on the monitor—the shot SAM was now rejigging for the koombies in the FG.\nThe crew was setting up, once again, for the dreamlike appearance of Firefall with the long dolly track in the center of Main Street, the camera inside the antiques store with the koombies in the FG...\nThank you for your help.",

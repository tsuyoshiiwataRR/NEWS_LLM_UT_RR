    "text": "Paula Josephine Lukehart\nFormer Gillette resident, Paula Josephine Lukehart, 79, passed away Friday, Dec. 15, 2023, at the Mission at the Villa Castle Rock, in Green River, Wyoming, surrounded by family.\nShe was born May 29, 1944, in Gillette, the daughter of Paul Lewis and Myrtle Moser.\nPaula graduated from Campbell County High School in 1962 before attending the National College of Business in Rapid City, South Dakota.\nShe married Linden Lukehart in 1965, and they later divorced. She then married Mike “Mac” McCullough many years later.\nPaula worked as a secretary for 33 years until her retirement in 2004.\nShe was a proud member of the Upper Yellowstone Snowmobile Club in Cooke City, Montana.\nPaula had the best sense of humor, she liked to tease and she was feisty! Paula enjoyed spoiling her grandchildren and she had an amazing memory of the cute little things that each of them said. She gave the best gifts, not because they were expensive but because they were unique to the person individually. Lastly, Paula LOVED to dance!\nSurvivors include her son, Paul Lukehart and wife Amanda of Gillette; daughter, Lisa Lukehart of Rock Springs, Wyoming; beloved grandchildren, Zachary, Joshua, Alyssa, Aleesha, Linden, and Islea; great-grandchild, Augustus; niece, Dena; and several cousins.\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, Paul and Myrtle Lewis; husband, Mac; and brother Gary.\nCremation has taken place and private family services will be held.\nThe family respectfully requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Mission at the Villa Castle Rock, 1445 Uinta Drive, Green River, WY 82935.\nCondolences for the family can be left at\nfoxfh.com.\nThis paid obituary was provided by family.",

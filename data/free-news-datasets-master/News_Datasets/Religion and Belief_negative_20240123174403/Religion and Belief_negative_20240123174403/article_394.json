    "text": "The head of Ukraine’s eastern-rite Catholic church on Saturday said a document endorsed by [Pope Francis this week permitting blessings for same-sex couples](https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/vatican-approves-blessings-for-same-sex-couples-in-landmark-ruling/) did not apply to his church and its teachings. Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk said the [Vatican document](https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/vatican-approves-blessings-for-same-sex-couples-in-landmark-ruling/) “interprets the pastoral meaning of blessings in the Latin Church” but made no reference to issues governing the eastern, or Greek Catholic, church. “Thus … this Declaration applies solely to the Latin Church and has no legal force for the faithful of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church,” Shevchuk said in a statement. He said a blessing could not be separated from the church’s teachings and “can in no way contradict the teaching of the Catholic Church about the family as a faithful, indissoluble, and fertile union of love between a man and a woman.” The eastern-rite church worships according to rites similar to the Orthodox faith but is in communion with Rome by virtue of a 16th century agreement. Repression forced the church underground in Soviet times and it now has about 4.5 million parishioners, or roughly 10% of the population of Ukraine. The document from the Vatican’s doctrinal office said Roman Catholic priests can administer blessings to same-sex couples as long as they are not part of regular church rituals or liturgies. It said such blessings would be a sign that God welcomes all but should not be confused with the sacrament of heterosexual marriage. Gay rights are making some progress in Ukraine and other ex-Soviet states outside Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has expressed sympathy for upholding gay rights, though ruling out constitutional changes to allow single-sex marriages while the country is at war.",

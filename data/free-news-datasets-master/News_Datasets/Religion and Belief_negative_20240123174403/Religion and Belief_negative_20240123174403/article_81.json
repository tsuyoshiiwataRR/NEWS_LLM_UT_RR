    "text": "🔥 From Sockpuppet : \"It is with a saddened and broken heart that I report that our dear friend and longtime Kossack “LamontCranston” passed away on Thursday mid-morning. He was resting after a long, trying flight home from a vacation to Germany. Mrs LC was letting him nap while she did their sheep-farm chores. She found him deceased, apparently from a blood clot to the brain. She said he looked peaceful, not as if he suffered at all.\" (Thanks Sockpuppet) He will be sorely missed. He was a very sweet, caring person, funny, with a joie de vivre for enjoying his life with his lovely wife and their beautiful sheep herding dogs. We will miss his wit, and his passion for our Democracy. R.I.P., LC. We miss you already. 🙏🏽😢😥🥀🕊️ . 🔥 LamontCranston's Profile Retired Network Security Systems Engineer Occupation: Shepherd/Farmer - We grow wool!

    "text": "(Minghui.org) A 59-year-old woman in Linshu County, Shandong Province, was sentenced to seven years on October 19, 2023, for practicing Falun Gong, a mind-body practice based on the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance. Ms. Li Xia, who was retired from the Linshu County Power Plant, was arrested at home on July 3, 2023, by Li Fangchun of the Linshu County [610 Office] and Qiu Feng, director of the Linshu County Domestic Security Office. The police later submitted her case to the Linshu County [Procuratorate]. The Linshu County Court heard Ms. Li’s case on October 19, 2023, and sentenced her to seven years. She was held at the Linyi City Detention Center following her arrest. It’s not clear if she has been transferred to a prison. Ever since the Chinese Communist Party began to persecute Falun Gong in 1999, Ms. Li has been repeatedly arrested for upholding her faith. She was arrested on November 30, 2007, while she was on her way home after work. Her electric motorcycle was impounded and her home was ransacked. The police raided Ms. Li’s home again in late October 2015 and arrested her at home on November 5, 2015. She was held at the Linyi City Detention Center until December 2, 2015.

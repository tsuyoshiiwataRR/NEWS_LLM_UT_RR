    "text": "June 22, 1955—December 17, 2023\nRobbie Maxwell Williamson was called home in the early hours of Sunday, December 17, 2023, with her loving family by her side.\nVisitation will be Thursday, December 28, 2023, from 5:00 p.m.—8:00 p.m. and Friday, December 29, 2023, 9:00 a.m. – 11:00 a.m., with the funeral services following at 11:00 a.m. Burial following the service will be at Chippiannock Cemetery, Rock Island, IL. Services and repass will be held at Second Baptist Church Family Life Center immediately following the interment. Orr's Mortuary, Rock Island, is assisting the family with arrangements. Memorials in Robbie's name may be made to SBC Outreach Music & Arts Academy and the Second Baptist Food Pantry.\nRobbie Maxwell was born on June 22, 1955, to Henry and Vally Maxwell in Chicago, IL. Robbie was raised under the matriarch of a strong Black family where she was taught to fear the Lord, to be determined, and to persevere. Robbie was devoted to her stepfather, Sonny Hampton, and became his main caregiver until he died on January 9, 2012.\nPeople are also reading…\nAs First Lady of Second Baptist Church, Robbie did not like to be in the spotlight. As a woman of Christ, she still got a lot of work done both at Second Baptist and in the community. She loved working with the children and served as the Director of the Second Baptist Tutoring program and worked anywhere in the church that needed her. Robbie was the inventory clerk for Second Baptist Church and a member of the Usher Board, all while being a wonderful First Lady, loving wife, nurturing mother, and an extraordinary grandmother. Robbie was a longtime member of the Quad City Negro Heritage Society.\nPossessing a magnificent taste for the finer things in life, she could be relied upon for her expertise in impeccable clothing choices and other accessories—especially hats. Robbie was a connoisseur of hats. She had over 100 hats from her husband's travels all over the country as well as from friends and family. Everyone who met her loved her gentle, sweet spirit, and most importantly, a generous pure heart and beautiful smile. She could be defined as a virtuous woman. Among the things that she loved and enjoyed were cooking, gardening, dancing—especially the \"Electric Slide.\"\nLeft to cherish her memory are her loving husband, Rev. Joseph D. Williamson III; sons: Joseph D. Williamson IV, Lewisville, TX, and Charles Maxwell Williamson, Rock Island, IL; grandsons: Charles Maxwell Williamson II, and Malakai Williamson; sister, Rita Johnson; and nieces, nephews, relatives, and friends. Robbie had a special love for her Second Baptist Church Family where she will be greatly missed.\nShe was preceded in death by her parents Henry and Vally Maxwell, stepfather Sonny Hampton, and brother Charles \"Chuckie\" Maxwell.",

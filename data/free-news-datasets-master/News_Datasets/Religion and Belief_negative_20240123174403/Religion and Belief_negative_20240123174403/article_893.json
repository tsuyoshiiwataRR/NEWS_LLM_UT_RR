Kingshighway & Adams St., NE corner, St. CharlesBuilt: 1970Architect: Architectural Style: Mid-Century Modern, Brutalism\n\"Constructed as a Baptist Church, this building was converted to a theater by Lindenwood University in 1996 and now serves as the Lindenwood Cultural Center. The sanctuary was built in 1970, replacing an earlier church building on the lot. The education wing predates the sanctuary, having been built in 1961. Although the building is not yet 50 years old, it appears to be individually eligible as a good local example of Mid-Century Modern, Brutalism architecture. However, it does not contribute to the character of the district due to its post-1961 construction date and because its style is out of character with the neighborhood.\n\"The sanctuary to the Old Baptist Church was built in 1970 after the earlier church building was demolished in 1969. The educational wing was built in 1961 and was retained when the old church was demolished. The Mid-Century Modern, Brutalism design features a concrete foundation, blond brick walls with stone accents, and a flat roof. The two street elevations are stepped, and in the stepped area are floor to ceiling steel windows with glass panes of various colors. Near the southwest corner of the building is a stone steeple with cast stone accents, and a round stone wall wraps around the base of the steeple. A triangular brick wall with inset stone panel is at the southwest corner of the building, and to each side is a single-leaf, glazed\nmetal door. A wooden handicap ramp is at the right door.\n\"Located at the northeast corner of Kingshighway and Adams Street, this flat lot has public sidewalks along both street frontages and an alley along the rear. The building is constructed close to the public sidewalks, and paved parking lots are in the rear and north side yards. There are no outbuildings.\" ~ St. Charles Historic Survey Phase III, PDF pages 561-564\nCopyright (c) 2023 Groundspeak, Inc. All Rights Reserved.",

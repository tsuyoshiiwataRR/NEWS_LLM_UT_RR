    "text": "Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | The Uganda Muslim Supreme Council (UMSC) National Chairperson has suspended Deputy Mufti Sheikh Abdallah Ssemambo following a petition endorsed by 15 members of the national executive committee. The suspension, effective immediately, requires Ssemambo to receive only half his salary until the impeachment process concludes. “Be notified that the Chairperson of the UMSC has received a petition of impeachment against you under Article 11(1) of the UMSC this 22nd Day of December 2023. The Petitioners fault you for conducting yourself in a manner unbefitting of your office and abrogating the constitution of UMSC contrary to Article 5(14) of the said constitution”, reads the December 22 letter signed by Prof. Muhammad Kisambira Lubega, the UMSC National Chairperson. It adds that “be further informed that you are required to file and serve on the Chairperson in triplicate a written reply within seven working days from the date of receipt of the petition.” According to the suspension letter, the UMSC joint session comprising the National Executive Committee and College of Imminent Sheikhs will meet after seven days to hear the accusations against Sheikh Ssemambo. During his suspension, Ssemambo is barred from his office and required to surrender all official UMSC items in his possession. Ley by Mahmood Katerega, the petitioners present three grounds for impeachment. They accuse Ssemambo of participating in irregular proceedings that saw him sworn in as Acting Mufti of Uganda, disregarding the UMSC constitution, and his involvement in the purported suspension of the substantial Mufti of Uganda, Sheikh Shaban Ramadhan Mubaje and UMSC Chairperson. This development arises amid a crisis within the UMSC related to the failed sale of Ssembabule Muslim land to businessman Justus Kyabahwa. Ssemambo couldn’t be reached for comment by the time of publishing this story. **",

    "text": "August 10, 1927—December 20, 2023\nWednesday, December 20, Merrill Davis, 96, was called home to join his beloved wife, in the place God prepared for him.\nBorn August 10, 1927, in Ottumwa, IA, to Harold and Margaret Davis. Youngest of two sons, he grew up to attend Iowa Wesleyan. After having served during WWII, he worked for Deere & Co. 36 years, then started M. Davis Inc., now run by his son-in-law, Steve, and grandson, Tom.\nMerrill was a generous, loving son, husband, father, and grandfather. His dedication to his children and love for his family was simply unmatched. He was fiercely devoted to the love of his life, Carol, throughout their 62 years of marriage. They were inseparable until her death in 2018. He missed her and mourned her loss until his last breath.\nMerrill loved flying, shooting, boating, and more. He was blessed with many dear friends, old and new. Merrill was extremely proud of his service to this country. He served as a paratrooper with the 11th Airborne in the Asia-Pacific arena. Our family was truly blessed to have had such a wonderful and loving patriarch and hero. Left behind to forever share his memory; daughters: Cindy Davis, CO, and Dori (Steven) Wauer, Bettendorf, IA; grandchildren: Tom (fiancé Andrea Deering) Wauer, Camanche, IA, and Rachael (AJ) Ash, Waukee, IA. He is preceded in death by his parents; brother, Max Davis; and wife, Carol Jeanne Davis.\nPeople are also reading…\nSaturday, December 30, 2023, at 10:00 AM, a Mass of Christian Burial with family and close friends will be held at Christ the King Catholic Church, immediately followed by burial at Moline Memorial Park. The family will greet friends at a luncheon from noon to 1:30 PM at CityView Celebrations at Trimble Pointe, 701 12th Street, Moline.\nMemorials may be made to Wounded Warrior Project.

Emmanuel Macron expressed to the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem “his deep concern” about “the dramatic situation” of the Catholic parish in Gaza where two parishioners were killed “in an undignified manner” on December 16 by an Israeli soldier, the Prime Minister said on Sunday. ‘Elysium.\nDuring a telephone interview on Saturday the day before Christmas with Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzabella, the French president spoke of “his deep concern over the dramatic situation in the Latin parish of Gaza”, where “hundreds civilians of all faiths (…) have been living under bombs and bullets for more than two months while the faithful and the sisters take care of sick, elderly or disabled people.”\nHe expressed his condolences “for the death of two parishioners, killed in an undignified manner a few days ago”. On December 16, a mother and her daughter, both Christians, were killed by an Israeli soldier in front of the only Catholic church in Gaza. Pope Francis denounced the death of these two women the next day.\nA message of “solidarity” to Christian communities\nIn the run-up to the Christmas mass, in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, Emmanuel Macron asked the Latin Patriarch “to send a message of peace and solidarity to all Christians in the Holy Land, and to assure them that France stands at their side.”\nThe president reaffirmed “France’s loyalty to its commitments, and in particular to the particular role of protection of a certain number of Christian communities, exercised through the French consulate general in Jerusalem”.\nREAD Also: explosions heard during the night in the center of kyiv, dozens injured according to the mayor\n“This responsibility, inherited from history, will be fully assumed in the face of the contemporary risks weighing on these communities,” assured Emmanuel Macron who at the same time sent a message of “support” and “solidarity” to the Christian communities, via the consulate from France to Jerusalem.\n#Gaza #Emmanuel #Macron #expresses #concern #dramatic #situation #Catholic #parish",

    "text": "From The Guardian 12 .23.23 House speaker’s Christian nationalist ties spark first amendment fears Links between the new Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, and key Christian nationalist leaders have sparked fears the devout Louisiana congressman might seek to erode elements of the first amendment, which protects key US civil liberties including freedom of religion and the separation of church and state. Long before the evangelical conservative Johnson became speaker, he had forged close ties with Christian nationalists like David Barton, whose writings claiming the country’s founders intended to create a Christian nation have been widely debunked by religion scholars. Although Barton, a self-styled historian, has been heavily criticized for distorting the first amendment by promoting the flawed idea there should be no separation between church and state, Johnson has hailed him as an important mentor and Barton has returned the praise. www.theguardian.com/… From Politico 10.27.23 ‘He Seems to Be Saying His Commitment Is to Minority Rule’ Kristin Kobes Du Mez, is a historian who specializes in evangelical Christianity and politics. The idea that America is founded on a creed is a common one among evangelicals, and it was a sign to her that Johnson adheres to a worldview that can be described as Christian nationalist. “As he understands it, this country was founded as a Christian nation. So really, Christian supremacy and a particular type of conservative Christianity is at the heart of Johnson’s understanding of the Constitution and an understanding of our government,” Du Mez says. www.politico.com/… From SLPC (Southern Poverty Law Center) 11.2.23 Hate Groups Rejoice Over Newly Elected Speaker Mike Johnson In his tenure as a congressman, Johnson has pushed xenophobic rhetoric and policies. His elevation to the speaker’s chair was lauded by anti-immigrant hate groups. Some of Johnson’s statements on immigration mimic “great replacement”-style rhetoric. The “great replacement” is a false and racist conspiracy theory purporting that white people are being intentionally displaced by ‘elites’ and replaced by immigrant people of color. Johnson has repeatedly accused Democrats of encouraging immigration to secure a supportive voting base. In a July 2021 appearance on Fox News, Johnson accused the Biden administration of allowing migrants into the country to expand the party’s voting base. “Why in the world would any elected official in this country go along with this terrible policy? This dangerous set of policies that they’re engaging in? You’re always drawn to that ultimate conclusion: They want to turn these people into voters,” Johnson said. www.splcenter.org/...",

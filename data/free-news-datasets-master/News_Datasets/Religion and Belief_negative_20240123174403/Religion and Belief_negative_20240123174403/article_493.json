Consequently, the fatwa declares the use of TikTok impermissible.\nWith over 39 million downloads in 2022 alone, TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, is under increasing scrutiny and calls for bans worldwide, including in Pakistan, according to data from Sensor Tower, a mobile and digital analytics firm, The Express Tribune reported.\nEarlier this year, a petition was filed in the Lahore High Court, urging a ban on the TikTok application. The petition highlighted concerns about the platform’s perceived detrimental effects on the youth of society, adding to the growing chorus of voices advocating for restrictions.\nIn 2021, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority imposed a five-month ban on the video-sharing app from July to November. The ban was lifted after TikTok provided assurances that it would enhance measures to control indecent or immoral content on the platform, The Express Tribune reported.

All communities are also urged not to engage in using religious issues as a means to achieve electoral victory. \"On the contrary, make religion a good foundation to contest peacefully in elections,\" said Deputy Minister of Religion Saiful Rahmat Dasuki in his speech at the Maha Sanghadana Pabbajja Samanera event at the Borobudur Temple Tourism Complex in Magelang Regency, Central Java, on Saturday (23/12/2023).\" The Maha Sanghadana is part of the series of activities of the Pabbajja Samanera, which takes place at the Borobudur Temple Tourist Park from December 16-28, 2023. This Pabbajja Samanera is being attended by 500 people from all over Indonesia. Pabbajja Samanera is a type of training in which Buddhist practitioners undergo a practice of becoming novice monks. This activity is held by the Indonesian Mahanikaya Buddhist Council (MBMI). The democratic party elections are a routine agenda that is repeated every five years. In the elections, there will always be differences and competition. However, it should be noted that all members of the community and various religious groups in Indonesia should be able to pass through it happily and joyfully. \"Face the election with joy and remember that friendship and brotherhood are something that we must always maintain,\" he said. Religious communities are expected to continue to maintain and strengthen the unity that exists in Indonesia. In the midst of the approaching election, all communities are also urged not to aggravate the political situation with unpleasant actions, insults, or even defaming others.

Through these events, the Buddhist community is reminded to continue maintaining internal harmony among themselves as well as with members of other religious communities. \"Practice dhamma properly and correctly in your daily life and bring about peace in our Indonesia today,\" he said. The Samanera Pabbajja event is expected to further strengthen the appeal of Borobudur Temple as a religious tourism destination. By holding it regularly, Samanera Pabbajja is also expected to contribute to attracting more visitors from various countries to Indonesia. The Chairman of the Pabbajja Samanera Committee, Fatmawati, said that during the Maha Sanghadana event, Buddhist devotees lit candles and released 300 lanterns over the Taman Wisata Candi Borobudur complex.

The Chairman of MBMI, Agus Jaya, stated that lighting candles and releasing lanterns are also symbolic of the spiritual way to achieve a happier life. He also invited all people to continue practicing dhamma to increase virtue in everyday life. \"Spread kindness and bring peace within yourself and the world,\" he said.",

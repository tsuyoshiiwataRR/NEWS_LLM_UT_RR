But he said more. The far-right’s support for the law means seeing their historic demand for “national priority” satisfied, “putting the French first”, which certainly sounds familiar to them. This is the same noise that boosted Trump and opened the door to Brexit (take back control, America first), and it will mark the next European electoral contest. The dividing line is already quite clear: more Europe or more nationalism. Externally, the nationalist arc would attempt to essentialize Europe, and internally, it would emphasize a Europe of nations against the idea of a common home. This dual dialectic will colonize the word “Europe” during the coming months, and it will be done with the same old rhetoric. They’ll talk about reclaiming what defines us, what obscures us from the earth. Native purity. Nationalist self-affirmation involves the exclusion of what is different, especially internal pluralism, and this is the approach that national populism will adopt in Europe as well: Europe for the Europeans. The paradox is that this self-affirmation is done at the expense of cultivating that other idea of Europe, which was born with the call to open up to the world, which is the opposite of our current “Fortress Europe”. Its values are thus communitized, as the European People’s Party’s 2019 manifesto reads: “Preserve our unique way of life,” they say there. Basically, they propose a kind of crusade to the old continent, but it is no more (and no less) than a narcissistic movement, because it invites us to see a reflection of what is authentic, our thing, which Obviously present within us, and it does so in the context of an onslaught of emotions: fear, the narrowest of emotions. “I fear that Europeans will vote with fear,” Borrell recalled Montaigne recently saying. And the truth is that emotions usually stem from real problems. The intensity of fear among citizens has increased due to the increase in images of war on our screens and the monopolization of security issues in our public opinion. Fear sells and, interestingly, it is accentuated in the richest and safest places. The main thing is how to broadcast it. Far-right politicians talk about an “invasion” of refugees, while conservatives and social democrats adopt far-right agendas and discourse. This has happened in countries like Sweden or Holland and now it is a warning to sailors in Britain, Germany or France too. Without forgetting the new migration and asylum agreement of the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. At a time when we see Europe in decline, this hegemonic narrative risks consoling us because it places us, if only for a moment, above the rest, just as Trump’s nationalism is a reflection of this idea. Taking advantage that the skin is white is all that is left to those who, mistakenly, feel “last in everything”: the privilege of the dethroned.",

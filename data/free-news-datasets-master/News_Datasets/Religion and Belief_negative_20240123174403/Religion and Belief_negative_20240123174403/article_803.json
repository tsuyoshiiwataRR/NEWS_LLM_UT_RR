    "text": "A dark Christmas is coming to the Holy Land. No gigantic Christmas tree, no flamboyant nativity scene, little joy. A veil of sadness shrouded Bethlehem on Sunday, December 24, as it usually dresses up in its festive clothes for Christmas, tarnished this year by the war in the Gaza Strip. Few worshippers and tourists are expected during the day and at midnight mass in the Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank, which according to Christian tradition was the birthplace of Jesus Christ. Tourists have fled the area since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas on October 7. Palestinian Christians, for their part, do not have the heart for the celebrations, which have been largely cancelled by the municipality, as they cannot ignore the fate of their fellow citizens, besieged and bombed in Gaza. See alsoChrist in the Ruins: Christmas Festivities Cancelled in Bethlehem \"Many of them are dying for this land, it's very difficult to celebrate something while our people are dying,\" said Nicole Najjar, an 18-year-old student, in the deserted Manger Square. In front of the Church of the Nativity, a work of art evoking the tragedy of Gaza has been installed on the ground, in place of the life-size nativity scene and the colossal Christmas tree: Mary and Joseph, grey statues, in the middle of a jumble of debris and sheet metal, behind barbed wire. On the building next door, a large banner reads: \"Stop the genocide, stop the displacement, lift the blockade: the bells of Bethlehem are ringing for a ceasefire in Gaza.\" The war between Hamas and Israel entered its 79th day on Sunday. Triggered on October 7 by the Palestinian movement's commando attack in Israel, which killed about 1,140 people according to Israeli authorities, it has killed more than 20,400 people in Gaza and displaced 85 percent of the population, according to the Hamas government. Sadness and destruction In the Palestinian territory, which is governed by Hamas, an estimated number of a few thousand, Christians have taken refuge in churches that have not been spared from the fighting. Last week, a mother and daughter were killed by Israeli fire on the grounds of the Holy Family Church in Gaza City, according to the patriarchate. Pope Francis has denounced bombings and shootings targeting \"defenseless civilians.\" \"This year is different from others, it is made of sadness, sorrow, destruction, deprivation and loss,\" said Mervat Murra, a 50-year-old fashion designer in Bethlehem. The scout parade, which usually wakes up the city with bagpipes and tambourines, is to give way to a silent parade. In the morning, a huge Palestinian flag was unfurled in Manger Square, held at either end by adults and children, Christians and Muslims. Around the square, the Giacaman family opened their shop of nativity scenes and other objects of liturgical art for the first time since October 8, without illusions. \"No one will come, we opened because we have to, it's Christmas,\" said Amir Giacaman, 29. \"During Covid, we had two bad years but it's nothing compared to that.\" \"We don't like to celebrate when Gaza is experiencing genocide and even here in the West Bank we mourn young people killed by Israelis and other detainees every day,\" Mitri Raheb, pastor of a Lutheran church in Bethlehem, told AFP. Hostilities in Gaza have spilled over into the West Bank, Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967, where more than 300 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since 7 October. \"All we want for Christmas is a ceasefire, a lasting one, to put an end to this atrocity,\" Raheb said. \"Bethlehem gave Jesus to the world. It is high time for the world to bring peace to Bethlehem and Gaza.\" With AFP This week's recapFrance 24 invites you to look back on the news that marked the week Subscribe now Take international news with you wherever you go!

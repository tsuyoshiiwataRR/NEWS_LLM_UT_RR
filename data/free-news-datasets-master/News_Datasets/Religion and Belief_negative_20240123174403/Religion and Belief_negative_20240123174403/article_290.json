    "text": "\"The difference between the Nazi ghettos in Europe and Gaza is that there are still many people alive in Gaza and the world still has a chance to do something.\" The phrase almost cost the Jewish writer Masha Gessen to attend the presentation of the Hannah Arendt Prize that she had been awarded for her political thought. In the end, the event was able to take place as planned in the German city of Bremen, but in a less solemn venue than initially announced. For weeks, tens of thousands of people around the world have been trying to do something, to achieve a ceasefire that will tackle the brutal humanitarian crisis inflicted on the Palestinians. Those thousands of people are being joined by important Jewish voices, such as Gessen. Voices that harshly criticize the actions of the Israeli government of Netanyahu, not only for the cruelty with which they attack the Palestinian population, but also for the damage they are causing in Israel.\nIsraeli-born Omer Bartov, a professor at Brown University who has devoted his life to the study of acts of mass murder, explained in The Chronicle of Higher Education magazine that if Israel continues on its current course, with its current government, \"it is to be feared that future generations of Israelis will inherit an 'authoritarian, similar to Sparta', whose sense of national identity is fundamentally 'based on bloodshed'.\nLearn more\nAre crimes against humanity being committed in Gaza?\nThe majority of Israelis, say the polls, support the Netanyahu government and the actions of its Defense Forces (IDF), but there are more and more voices inside Israel frightened by the human deterioration of those soldiers who shoot at half-naked people with white flags, who walk on the rubble of a recently bombed building. knowing that under their boots there are still men and women, children, alive, trapped and terrified, soldiers and officers who direct a missile at a house where they know that only a doctor lives with his family or a United Nations worker. Soldiers and officers calmly watching a journalist bleed to death and humiliating detained civilians. Those soldiers and officers will soon return to Israel and will be the teachers of their children, the friendly official behind the window, the waiter who serves coffee to the tourist... (A list of the names of 40 officers who planned and carried out the operation is now before the International Criminal Court, according to former Human Rights Watch director Kenneth Roth.)\nBartov distinguishes between ethnic cleansing, which \"aims to expel a population from a territory, often violently,\" and genocide, which \"aims to destroy that population wherever it is,\" but warns that the dehumanizing rhetoric employed by Netanyahu comes close to the latter and urges the international Jewish community to \"raise their voices, before Israel's leadership plunges him and his neighbors into the abyss.\"\nAnother Israeli historian, Avi Shlaim, professor emeritus of international relations at Oxford, points out that in 2008 Israel launched the so-called Operation Cast Lead over Gaza. It is important to remember, he writes in Prospect , that even then an independent fact-finding mission headed by Richard Goldstone, a distinguished South African, Jewish and Zionist judge, established that Hamas and other Palestinian groups were guilty of firing rockets and mortars with the deliberate aim of harming Israeli civilians, but also that much of the extensive damage caused by the IDF \"was not justified by military necessity and was carried out in a timely manner.\" in an illegal and senseless manner.\"\n\"The report found,\" Shlaim says, \"seven incidents in which civilians were shot at leaving their homes waving white flags; an intentional attack on a hospital; numerous incidents in which ambulances were prevented from treating the seriously injured; several attacks on civilian infrastructure of no military significance, to deprive civilians of their basic needs.\"\n\"Israel's government has brought death and destruction to Gazans many times,\" Shlaaim writes, \"but this time it has raised the possibility of something far worse than before: ethnic cleansing.\" In view of the fact that previous violations of international law were never punished, this time the Netanyahu government has thrown itself down the slope. Many Jewish voices are warning: help stop them now.\nSign up for the weekly Ideas newsletter here.\nSpecial Limited Time Offer\nSubscribe to continue reading Read without limits\nRead more\nI'm already a subscriber\n_",

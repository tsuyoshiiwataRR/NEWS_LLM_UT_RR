    "text": "[ News ](https://www.sundaytimes.lk/231224/news) AG tells Acting Police Chief to act swiftly in cases against self-styled prophetView(s): By Ranjith Padmasiri The Attorney General has written to Acting Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Tennakoon, instructing him to hold an impartial inquiry and report back within two weeks as to why the police have been slow to provide details about the cases filed against self-styled prophet Jerome Fernando. The AG has also directed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to submit a progress report to the AG’s Department on the investigations being conducted against Mr. Fernando under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The AG’s letter, sent through Senior State Counsel Shaminda Wickrama, has also pointed to a series of glaring shortcomings in the investigations conducted into the suspect “pastor.” Noting that the police have been extremely lethargic in providing details on the investigations and court cases regarding the self-styled prophet, the AG has warned that if the police continue to delay providing these investigation reports, the AG’s Department may not be in a position to appear for the police in cases filed by the suspect against the police. Meanwhile, Mr. Fernando will continue to remain in remand custody through Christmas and the New Year, given that all petitions filed asking him to be given bail will not be taken up until January 4.

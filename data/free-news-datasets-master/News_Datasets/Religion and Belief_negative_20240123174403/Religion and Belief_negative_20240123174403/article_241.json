Part 1 of this diary dealt with the oncoming threat of Fascism and corruption in the executive branch as exemplified by Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani during the Trump Regime. As sore losers, they are still unwilling to accept the legitimate results of the 2020 Election — one Trump lost to Joe Biden. A primary ally of Trump and Giuliani — one who believed in the discredited “Stop the Steal” nonsense in 2020 — is Ginni Thomas, wife of the one of the most-corrupt members of the United States Supreme Court in recent memory, Clarence Thomas. As 2023 draws to a close, it’s time to look at corrupt practices in the judicial and legislative branches of government as seen through the eyes of editorial cartoonists. Clarence Thomas features prominently in this diary as well as the new religious nut in the United States House of Representatives, Speaker Mike “Call Me Pure” Johnson. Recuse, He Must! xGinni Thomas called 2020 a ‘heist.’ Clarence Thomas must recuse himself. https://t.co/g1SlEX8sSF pic.twitter.com/99OLFQ46qk— Ann Telnaes (@AnnTelnaes) December 22, 2023 In case you missed these recent diaries of mine, here are the links.

Clarence Thomas and the Billionaire xDave Granlund @DaveGranlund #ClarenceSale pic.twitter.com/TDxQKFz1LV— Editorial & Political Cartoons (@EandPCartoons) December 20, 2023 For more than two decades, Thomas has accepted luxury trips virtually every year from the Dallas businessman without disclosing them, documents and interviews show. A public servant who has a salary of $285,000, he has vacationed on Crow’s superyacht around the globe. He flies on Crow’s Bombardier Global 5000 jet. He has gone with Crow to the Bohemian Grove, the exclusive California all-male retreat, and to Crow’s sprawling ranch in East Texas. And Thomas typically spends about a week every summer at Crow’s private resort in the Adirondacks. The extent and frequency of Crow’s apparent gifts to Thomas have no known precedent in the modern history of the U.S. Supreme Court. These trips appeared nowhere on Thomas’ financial disclosures. xMonte Wolverton @montewolverton #ClarenceSales pic.twitter.com/QkVsERG8KL— Editorial & Political Cartoons (@EandPCartoons) December 20, 2023 Dave Granlund @DaveGranlund #ClarenceSale pic.twitter.com/TDxQKFz1LV— Editorial & Political Cartoons (@EandPCartoons) December 20, 2023 Dave Granlund @DaveGranlund #ClarenceSale pic.twitter.com/TDxQKFz1LV For more than two decades, Thomas has accepted luxury trips virtually every year from the Dallas businessman without disclosing them, documents and interviews show.

Dahlia Litwick points out in Slate magazine that the Supreme Court’s refusal to clean its own house and not address its ethical lapses is hurting its legitimacy with the public and undermining confidence in an institution long considered an essential pillar of American democracy. 12/20/2023- Secret Santa #ClarenceThomas #SCOTUS #SCOTUSethics #JudicialEthics #Corruption https://t.co/NJi31tgTWy pic.twitter.com/93eg5KgKpJ— Clay Bennett (@BennettCartoons) December 20, 2023 12/20/2023- Secret Santa #ClarenceThomas #SCOTUS #SCOTUSethics #JudicialEthics #Corruption https://t.co/NJi31tgTWy pic.twitter.com/93eg5KgKpJ Celebrating Christmas Every Single Day For Justices Thomas and Alito, every day is Christmas https://t.co/KrZLmKUNDc pic.twitter.com/2MHn3rU3pN— Ann Telnaes (@AnnTelnaes) December 21, 2023 For Justices Thomas and Alito, every day is Christmas https://t.co/KrZLmKUNDc pic.twitter.com/2MHn3rU3pN Attribution for the above cartoon: Ann Telnaes @AnnTelnaes The Obligatory Call from Santa pic.twitter.com/P6vnipVOlP— mike luckovich (@mluckovichajc) December 18, 2023 pic.twitter.com/P6vnipVOlP The new Speaker of the US House of Representatives is quite a guy. Mike Johnson Compares Himself to Moses at Christian Gala “In a keynote speech to a gathering of Christian nationalist lawmakers Tuesday night, House Speaker Mike Johnson compared himself to Moses, leading the GOP conference — and America — through the parted waters of the Red Sea,” Rolling Stone reports. Said Johnson: “The Lord began to wake me up, through this three-week process, in the middle of night to speak to me.” Mike Johnson and Daughter Were Profiled at ‘Purity Ball’ “The German news segment documented Johnson and his family preparing for and then attending a purity ball, a controversial formal dance event, popular among some conservative Christians, that gained notoriety in the early 2000s. At a typical event, fathers and their teenage daughters dress in formal ball attire for a night that involves dinner and dancing and culminates with the daughter signing a pledge to her father to abstain from dating and to remain sexually abstinent until marriage.” “The news segment examines purity balls and the general purity movement among conservative Christians through the lens of the Johnson family.” “In a keynote speech to a gathering of Christian nationalist lawmakers Tuesday night, House Speaker Mike Johnson compared himself to Moses, leading the GOP conference — and America — through the parted waters of the Red Sea,” Rolling Stone reports.

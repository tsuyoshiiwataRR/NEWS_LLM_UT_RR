    "text": "In a move that is against a Vatican document approved by the Pope Francis, Nairobi Archbishop Philip Anyolo has opposed the decision to allow Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples.\nIn a statement on Saturday, Anyolo said that the decision contradicts traditional Catholic doctrine on marriage and family, including the disapproval of the Catholic Church of homosexual unions.\nThe archbishop further argued that the Fiducia Supplicans declaration advocates for the recognition of an institution of marriage as only a union between a man and a woman.\n\"This Declaration confirms and reiterates the perennial teaching of the Church that marriage is to be affirmed as an \"exclusive, stable and indissoluble union of a man and a woman, naturally open to the generation of children\" (n. 4),\" said Anyolo's statement in part.\n\"...and that the \"Church does not have the power to impart blessings on unions of persons of the same sex\" (n. 5).\"\nHe went on to state that the teachings of the church on marriage are only rooted in scripture and tradition and same-sex marriages are \"against reason, against nature and against African cultural tradition.\"\nCiting teachings from the bible, Anyolo said that the church firmly condemns the proposal and remains unwelcome.\n\"The word of God also strongly condemns such unions (Rom 1:24-27; 1 Car 6:10; 1 Tim 1:10). The African cultural traditions equally detest it as it is dearly against transmission of life,\" he said.\n\"It is for this reason that the Church excludes those living in irregular situations of marriage from full sacramental participation in the life of the Church.\"\nHe therefore declared that all Clergy residing and ministering in the Archdiocese of Nairobi are prohibited from blessing irregular relationships, unions, or same-sex couples.\nThis he said will ensure that the fundamental doctrinal positions affirmed in the Vatican document, and the perennial teachings of the Church on marriage, are upheld.\n\"To make sure the fundamental doctrinal positions affirmed in the Declaration, and the perennial teachings of the Church on marriage, is upheld, all Clergy residing and ministering in the Archdiocese of Nairobi are prohibited from blessing irregular relationships, unions, or same sex couples. Any form of blessing of same-sex unions and activities would go against God's word, the teaching of the church, the African cultural traditions, the laws of our nations, and would be scandolous to the faithful,\" Anyolo declared.\nThis comes after the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB)'s stand noting that the text broadens the range of church blessings to include 'Simple blessings that are not given in a liturgical setting'.\nKCCB Chairman Archbishop Martin Kivuva Musonde noted that when the Church bestows blessings upon people, it doesn't endorse or approve of any immoral behavior or actions they might engage in.\nHe also argued that the intention behind these blessings and prayers is to encourage personal transformation and a return to a righteous way of life in accordance with the teachings of the Church and God.\nTags: Archbishop Philip Anyolo Vatican Pope Francis Citizen TV Citizen Digital Same-sex couples Want to send us a story?

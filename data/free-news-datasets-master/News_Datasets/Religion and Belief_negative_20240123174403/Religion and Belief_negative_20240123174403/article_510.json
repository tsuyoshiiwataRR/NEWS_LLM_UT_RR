It would not be their first attempted attack this year.\nCologne – Shortly before Christmas, there are indications of a possible attack plan by an Islamist group on Cologne Cathedral, among other places. The police speak of a \"danger warning\", the officers have initiated extensive protective measures at Cologne Cathedral. A church in Vienna was also a possible target, it was said on Saturday. According to information from the German Press Agency, the group could have links to the terrorist group Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISPK). If confirmed, it would not be their first attack plan in Germany. Terrorism expert Hans-Jakob Schindler of the Counter Extremism Project (CEP) tells IPPEN. MEDIA: \"ISPK seems to have its eyes firmly on Germany\".\nOne day before Christmas, the police in Cologne at the cathedral increased their protective measures: There were indications of a terrorist attack. © Sascha Thelen/dpa\nSuspected terror in Cologne: IS offshoot could be behind it The group was formed in Afghanistan in 2015 as a local branch of the Islamic State. It is considered the second strongest armed group in the country – after the Taliban, which ISPK is fighting. In recent years, the group has repeatedly carried out attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan. \"ISPK continues to be the ISIS offshoot that tries to organize the most attacks in Western countries,\" Schindler said.\nIt could be the group's third serious attempt to commit attacks in this country as well. As early as 2020, ISPK is said to have planned attacks on NATO bases in Germany. In July 2023, seven suspected IS supporters were arrested. They are accused of having entered Germany to commit attacks. The men, most of whom are from Tajikistan, are said to have been in close contact with ISPK people.\nYoung people wanted to join the IS offshoot Just a few weeks ago, the police arrested two teenagers, who are also said to have planned attacks in North Rhine-Westphalia. They had exchanged views on it via a Telegram chat, and the target is said to have been Christmas markets, among other things. \"The two youths who were arrested a few weeks ago probably wanted to join the ISPK in Afghanistan after the attack,\" says terrorism expert Hans-Jakob Schindler.\nShortly before, Islamic scholar Ahmad Omeirate had spoken to IPPEN. MEDIA : \"There is a great danger that radicalisation will lead to attacks from the jihadist scene.\" There were some signs: Islamist groups and hate preachers have been making increasingly radical propaganda on social media for months – they want to lure young people in particular.",

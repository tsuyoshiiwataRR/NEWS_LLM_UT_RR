    "text": "2023-12-23 19:35:23 On the eve of Christmas Eve, messages and even Nativity scenes circulate on social media that allude to the war in Gaza and that present Jesus as “Palestinian.” In response, the Israeli Government is also using its social networks to dismantle what they describe as “malicious disinformation campaign“remembering that Jesus was Jewish. “Those who try to rewrite the story of Jesus to adapt it to their political agenda insult the faith of hundreds of millions of people,” they say, noting that talk of Jesus’ Palestinian origin is “anachronistic and false.” They claim that “They seek to deny the connection of the Jewish people with their ancestral landand thus deny the historic right of the Jewish people to have a national home in this land.” Like every year around this time, a malicious disinformation campaign begins to circulate claiming that “Jesus was Palestinian.” This is anachronistic and simply false. Those who try to rewrite the story of Jesus to adapt it to their political agenda… [pic.twitter.com/43YmllTKQ4] — Israel in Spanish (@IsraelinSpanish) [December 21, 2023] In its response to the messages circulating on the Internet, Israel cites the Gospels to refer to the origin of Jesus, pointing out that he was born in Bethlehem of Judea, “the historical land where the tribe of Judah lived” and “where a few years before the Land of Judea”. After recalling other biblical quotes that indicate that Jesus comes from “the Israelites” and that “he was born from the Land of Judah,” they maintain that “The undeniable truth is that Jesus was a Jew and was born in Judea, and lived in the time of the Second Temple.” “The first time that the land where Jesus was born and lived was called Palestine was in the time after Jesus, when the emperor Hadrian gave it the name Syria Palestine about the year 135 BC . C.” READ Also: At the age of 70, Putin is isolated, threatens nuclear weapons and is in the gravest crisis of his 23 years of rule - ynet Yedioth Ahronoth “The anti-Israelis manipulate history as they please, They use the figure of Jesus and insult the Christian faith“, they say, pointing out that Christians have also been “persecuted” by “the extremist Hamas regime” in Gaza and how their community “has practically disappeared.” #Jesus #Palestinian #false #anachronistic",

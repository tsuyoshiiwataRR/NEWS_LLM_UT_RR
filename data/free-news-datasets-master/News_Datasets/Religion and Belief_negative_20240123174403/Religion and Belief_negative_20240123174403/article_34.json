    "text": "German authorities said that have received an alert that a group may have been planning an attack on the Cologne Cathedral, the DPA news agency reported Saturday.\nAuthorities have not elaborated on the alert they received, saying police in the German city will take all special protective measures.\nSniffer dogs were brought in to search the premises after the evening mass service and visitors will be screened before entering the church, Michael Esser, the chief of police, said in a statement.\nEsser said that even if the alert were for New Year’s Eve, authorities would “take everything into account this evening to ensure the safety of cathedral visitors on Christmas Eve.”\nThe German daily Bild reported that officials in Germany, Austria and Spain had received indications that an Islamist group was planning several attacks in Europe.\nAuthorities in Cologne have recommended visitors to avoid carrying bags or arriving too early for mass at the church.\nMillions visit church every year\nThe Cathedral, the largest Gothic church in northern Europe, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. It attracts millions of visitors every year.\nThe construction of the church began around 1248 and was completed in 1880.\nIt withstood the bombing of Germany during World War II and has been hailed as a symbol of postwar reconstruction.\nrm/jsi (Reuters, dpa)\nThe post\nGerman police warn of possible attack at Cologne Cathedral appeared first on Deutsche Welle.",

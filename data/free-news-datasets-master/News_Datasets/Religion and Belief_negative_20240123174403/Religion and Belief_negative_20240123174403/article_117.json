What's important to understand is that the human body is a vessel for the Soul/Spirit. The death of the earthly body is something that happens to everyone. While many people think death is some horrible thing, it's really not. After death, the Soul/Spirit are released, so they can join God in Paradise.\nLike I said, Seth isn't wrong, but he's not telling you the whole story. After Yeshua's crucifixion, his Spirit returned to the Pleroma (carrying no memory of it's time on earth, simply a spark of pure divine energy), while the Soul (which belonged to Yeshua) became trapped in Sheol. Yeshua's Soul laments it's fate in Psalm 22. It was basically trapped in purgatory until Christ the Messiah arrived on earth (a couple months ago), and set things straight.\nYeshua's Soul is now united with its Spirit in Paradise, just as all Souls/Spirits will eventually be after they die.\nThis is why, in Revelation 1:5, Jesus says that he is \"the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth\". Most people think Jesus is firstborn from the dead because of the resurrection, but this can't be the case, because as soon as Jesus dies in the Gospel of Matthew, the Saints are resurrected in the body, and go into the Holy City. Jesus isn't resurrected until three days later (if you're counting time linearly).\nAnonymous Coward\nUser ID: 86441194\nCanada\n10/21/2023 09:31 AM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: Christ as Yeshua never died on the cross!!!\nThis is the Sethian account of the crucifixion, which isn't completely accurate, but also isn't completely false.

I cannot in my wildest imagination picture Jesus \"laughing\" at the earthly body being tortured in one of the most painful ways ever created by other \"humans\" ....\nBut I did read in the gospel of Peter that Yeshua felt no pain during the crucifixion. And in my mind, that demonstrates that the soul and spirit left the physical body already and was simply observing the body reacting neurologically.\nKorgh\nUser ID: 47568645\nUnited States\n10/21/2023 09:38 AM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: Christ as Yeshua never died on the cross!!!\nThere were two Christ's roaming the earth around 2000 years ago and the nag hammadi texts say this regarding Christ and the crucifixion;\nThe one who came to give gnosis said to me;\n\"He whom you saw on the tree, glad and laughing, this is the living Jesus.

Its important to know that the Christ of the Christians is not Yeshua! Also in order to get into \"the fathers\" kingdom in heaven you must first go through him as he is the truth and the way! He \"is\" his fathers son!\nYeshua (Saboath) was not christian he was a gnostic who descended here in a body a little over 2000 years ago to give humanity \"gnosis\"!\nHe never wanted to save anyone but those with eyes to see and ears to hear would get the message! His original message got lost somehow and people began to worship Christ the man of flesh and blood!\n\"This\" is where in the ancient texts Yeshua says\n\"Not only are they worshipping a man of flesh but they are even worshipping the wrong man\"\nChrist as Yeshua never wanted to be worshipped and he himself said to worship no one not even himself! He never wanted to be worshipped because he thought it served him no benefit!\nLast Edited by\nGhalleon\non 10/21/2023 02:01 PM\n\"A slave is easier to control when he is kept in constant fear & terror and doesn't know he's a slave!\"\nWWIII; The War for the human mind!\n\"Our contest is not against flesh and blood; but rather, the authorities of the universe and the souls of wickedness!\"\nelktonpat\nUser ID: 85390097\nUnited States\n10/21/2023 03:12 PM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: Christ as Yeshua never died on the cross!!!\nHow many versions of his story are there?\nBennder\nUser ID: 85970814\nUnited States\n10/21/2023 03:18 PM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: Christ as Yeshua never died on the cross!!!\nThere were two Christ's roaming the earth around 2000 years ago and the nag hammadi texts say this regarding Christ and the crucifixion;\nThe one who came to give gnosis said to me;\n\"He whom you saw on the tree, glad and laughing, this is the living Jesus. But this one into whose hands and feet they drive the nails is his fleshly part, which is the substitute being put to shame, the one who came into being in his likeness. But look at him and me.\"\nThis is also mentioned.\nAnd I was not afflicted at all. Those who were there punished me, yet I did not die in reality but in appearance, in order that I not be put to shame by them because these are my kinsfolk. I removed the shame from me, and I did not become fainthearted in the face of what happened to me at their hands. I was about to succumb to fear, and I suffered merely according to their sight and thought so that no word might ever be found to speak about them. For my death, which they think happened, happened to them in their error and blindness, since they nailed their man unto their death. Their thoughts did not see me, for they were deaf and blind. But in doing these things, they condemn themselves. Yes, they saw me; they punished me. It was another, their father, who drank the gall and the vinegar; it was not I. They struck me with the reed; it was another, Simon, who bore the cross on his shoulder. It was another upon whom they placed the crown of thorns. But I was rejoicing in the height over all the wealth of the rulers and the offspring of their error, of their empty glory. And I was laughing at their ignorance.\nQuoting:\nGhalleon\nI can't say that this shows the slightest comprehension of the theology of Jesus' death, burial and resurrection.\nJesus didn't Lose in the battle with Satan, his death was the crowning achievement over Satan. It was absolutely necessary for Jesus to die \"on a tree\". Jesus, son of man, son of God, in the Perfect, sinless Flesh. The perfect sacrifice to atone for the sins of man. Jesus alone was annointed to do what he did. God would not have annointed (Christed) another. Why would God do that? Did he expect for Jesus to fail? I think not.\nNon-vaxxed Senior WOMEN are invited to apply.\nCommunism is for LOSERS\nCommunism is SLAVERY\nFuck Joe Biden\nPage\n1\n2\nTop\nPrevious Page\nNext Page\nBack to Forum\nPost New Thread\nReply\nView Favorites\nRelated Threads\n1\nJesus Christ (yeshua) is King!!!\n12/03/19\n2\nJesus Christ Yeshua HaMashiach\n10/04/23\n3\nChrist (yeshua) Died For Our Sins And Was Raised on The 3rd Day!!!\n11/29/19\n4\nJesus Christ Yeshua Died For us!!!\n07/19/20\n5\nChrist as Yeshua never died on the cross!\n07/20/22\n6\nHave Faith in Yeshua (jesus Christ)\n12/31/19\n7\nLearn About Jesus Christ Yeshua he Died For us All!!!\n03/24/20\n8\nThis is a Slow Creep Towards The Nwo Only Jesus Christ Yeshua Will Reverse And Destroy Satans Kingdom!!!\n04/17/20\n9\nThe Only Corona You Should be Thinking About is my King Jesus Christ Yeshua... he is Coming!!!\n03/15/20\n10\nJesus Christ Yeshua Says in Revelation That The Harlot Church And Harlot Christians Will be Attacked by The Beast!!!

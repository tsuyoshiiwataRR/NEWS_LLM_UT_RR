    "text": "Overwhelming grief, desperation and fear of extermination have overtaken the Gaza Strip's small Christian community in a season usually marked by merriment as Israel continues its unrelenting attacks on the besieged enclave.\nPalestinian Christian Ibrahim Al-Amash summarized the somber situation by saying: \"There is no holiday spirit here in Gaza.\"\nIsraeli ongoing war on Gaza has already claimed the lives of many Christians in the Strip, while numerous others were injured in airstrikes and ground attacks.\n\"At the beginning of the war, we took refuge in the Church of St. Porphyrius in Gaza City, but it was targeted by Israeli warplanes which resulted in the killing and injuring of a large number of people,\" Amash, 45, told Turkish Anadolu Agency (AA).\n\"There is no safe place for Christians or Muslims here in Gaza,\" he said.\nAmash expressed the \"fear of genocide\" saying: \"There are new massacres every day.\"\n\"I have lost many relatives and friends to this war,\" he said. \"I have never witnessed destruction of this magnitude in my life.\"\n\"This is the most vicious war I have ever witnessed. I don’t know what to say. There are dead people everywhere,\" said Amash.\nHe explained that the Christian community is very small in Gaza.\n\"In this war, we are threatened with annihilation by Israeli bombing,\" he said.\n\"As the birthday of Jesus Christ approaches, the hearts of the Christians in Gaza and the rest of Palestine are nowhere around the holiday spirit,\" said Amash, stressing that \"even if the bombing stops, we will not celebrate, we will only pray for the end of the war, for peace, so that people can return to their homes.\"\nAn Israeli sniper killed a mother and her daughter and injured seven others last Saturday in the only Catholic church in the Gaza Strip, said the local Latin Catholic Church authority.\nThe incident was deplored by Pope Francis, who suggested that Israel was using \"terrorism\" tactics in Gaza .\nA woman arranges an installation of a scene of the Nativity of Christ with a figure \"symbolizing baby Jesus lying in his manger amid rubble,\" in reference to Gaza, at the Evangelical Lutheran Church, Bethlehem, occupied West Bank, Palestine, Dec. 6, 2023. (AFP Photo)\nContinuous attacks This is not the first incident in which Christian places of worship were targeted.\nThe Israeli army targeted on Oct. 21 the Church of St. Porphyrius in Gaza, the oldest Orthodox church in the city, killing at least 18 Christians, according to the Gaza Government Media Office.\nThe army also targeted the Orthodox Cultural Center in the Rimal neighborhood in southwestern Gaza City, which led to the destruction of large parts of the center.\nBritish MP Layla Moran said in a statement on X last Friday that some of her relatives were among the 300 victims trapped in the Catholic Church in Gaza City.\n\"My family in the Catholic Church in Gaza City are reporting white phosphorous and gunfire into their compound,\" said Moran.\n\"Soldiers are at the gates and there was a fire when they hit one of the (already dysfunctional) generators. There is no water left. There are 300 people there. We don’t know why this is happening. Are they going to be expelled from a church just days before Christmas??!\" she added.\nChristmas canceled Christian communities in Palestinian territories announced days ago the cancelation of Christmas celebrations, including the lighting of the Christmas tree, due to the war in Gaza, in a message of solidarity from the heads of the Christian churches.\nThe heads of Christian churches, including Bishop Atallah Hanna, Archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem, decided to cancel only the festive aspects of Christmas, including festivals, celebrations and decorating and lighting Christmas trees, while preserving the religious dimensions of the holiday, in light of the war in an exceptional decision, according to a statement by the churches.\nHanna said no one has the authority to cancel Christmas, because it is a very important holiday in the Christian Church, whether according to the Western calendar on Dec. 25 or according to the Eastern calendar on Jan. 7.\nThe resolution aims to convey a strong message of solidarity to all Christian churches in the world, calling for prayers for Palestine in light of the difficult circumstances it is witnessing.\nAlthough the Christmas tree will not be lit in Jerusalem and Bethlehem, there are initiatives in some churches to light a tree in the colors of the Palestinian flag or bearing the words \"Justice and Peace.\"\nChristians represent a small percentage of the population in Gaza, with about 1,000 living in the besieged coastal enclave.\nThe majority are Greek Orthodox, while a much smaller percentage are Roman Catholics, Baptists and other Protestant denominations, according to a 2014 survey conducted by the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA).\nshortlink copied Last Update: Dec 24, 2023 3:10 pm israeli-palestinian conflict gaza strip palestinian christians israels war on gaza christmas ",

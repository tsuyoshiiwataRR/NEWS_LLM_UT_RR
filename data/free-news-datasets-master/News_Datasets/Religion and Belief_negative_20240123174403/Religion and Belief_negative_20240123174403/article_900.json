Many states have tried to tackle the abuse by making clergy mandatory reporters of abuse to officials, just like doctors, therapists and teachers are. However, more than 30 states in the United States do not require church officials to report knowledge or allegations of child abuse if the information is deemed privileged, specifically coming from confession or counselling. It means that abuse can all too often be hidden – and survivors are left without recourse or justice. Fault Lines investigates how state laws in the US can lead to child sexual abuse in religious communities going unpunished.\nSenior Producer: Kavitha Chekuru Correspondent: Natasha Del Toro Director of Photography: Erik Ljung Editor: Leslie Atkins Executive Producer: Laila Al-Arian Production Manager: Anabelle Rojas Fact-checking: Abdulai Bah Sound Mix: Linus Bergman",

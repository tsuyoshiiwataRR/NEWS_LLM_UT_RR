    "text": "- Qantas accused of anti-Christian act\n- Airline criticized during the Christmas season\nBob Katter has accused Qantas of being anti-Christian after claiming the national airline disparaged traditional carol singing inside one of its prestigious business class lounges.\nIn a written complaint against the airline, the independent MP said he was angry because he did not listen to Christmas music with religious messages while sitting in a Qantas Club during a flight delay.\n“I noticed that during the two hours I was there, they played Christmas music,” Mr. Katter said.\n‘Two hours of the least Christmassy music I’ve ever heard.\nBob Katter accused Qantas of being anti-Christian after claiming the national airline rejected traditional Christmas carols inside one of its prestigious business class lounges.\n‘More than 80 per cent of Australia’s population are generational Australians and grew up listening to Christmas carols.\n“It would seem then that Qantas is anti-Christian.”\nAccording to the most recent census data, there has been a steady decline in the number of Australians identifying as Christian, with overall numbers falling from 74 per cent in 1991 to 44 per cent in 2021.\nThe same data found that while fewer people identify as Christians, the number of people who claim to have no religion has increased to 38 percent in 2021, up from 30 percent in 2016.\nIn his pre-Christmas speech, Katter, representing the Kennedy division in Queensland: He then lashed out at former Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce.\nIn a written complaint against the airline, the independent MP said he was angry because he did not listen to Christmas music with religious messages while sitting in a Qantas Club during a flight delay.\nJoyce resigned in early September after the airline came under the spotlight over allegations of illegal ticket sales and poor service.\n“As time goes by, I hope more and more Christians will realize their spite,” he wrote.\n“So although Alan Joyce (Australia’s most hated man?) may be gone, his ‘spirit’ clearly lives on.\n“But one thing is certain: its spirit” is not “The Spirit of Australia.”\nQantas has been contacted for comment.",

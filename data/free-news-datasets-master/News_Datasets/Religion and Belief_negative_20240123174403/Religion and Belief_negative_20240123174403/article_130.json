    "text": "SHIVAMOGGA/MANGALURU/UDUPI: Former BJP minister KS Eshwarappa issued a warning on Saturday, suggesting potential widespread communal violence if the Congress government lifts the ban on hijab in schools and colleges in the state. Other BJP and VHP leaders also warned of \\\"saffron shawl\\\" campaigns in educational institutions if the state government proceeds with such a decision.The hijab ban in classrooms was imposed when BJP was in office last year, and the matter is pending in the Supreme Court. Eshwarappa likened Siddaramaiah to a \\\"mad ruler like (Muhammad-bin) Tughlaq\\\" and accused him of disrespecting the justice system by indicating that the government will lift the ban without consulting legal experts. \\\"People from two communities will fight against each other in case the ban is lifted. Siddaramaiah should take responsibility for it,\\\" he said.He asserted that only a few girls are demanding the ban's removal, and he argued that the banned outfit PFI is also behind these demands. He clarified that he is not against Muslim girls wearing hijab in public, but insisted that they shouldn't be in designated rooms in schools and colleges.Udupi MLA Yashpal Suvarna of BJP held the Congress government accountable for potential turmoil arising from the proposed withdrawal of the hijab ban, suggesting that allowing hijabs could lead to other similar campaigns, such as wearing saffron shawls. Suvarna urged the government to reconsider its proposalVHP leader Sharan Pumpwell warned that schools and colleges in Karnataka would turn saffron if the government withdrew the hijab ban, while Mangaluru City North MLA Y Bharath Shetty and Mangaluru City South MLA D Vedavyas Kamath expressed concerns about potential struggles over dress code on college campuses if hijabs are allowed.Primary education minister Madhu Bangarappa said the Congress government and the CM respect all religions, and accused Eshwarappa and BJP of playing with religious sentiments.Former MLA K Raghupati Bhat, who is ex-chairman of the college development committee of Government PU College for Girls in Udupi, said the BJP government had not banned hijab, but implemented only a dress code.",

    "text": "Minister of Electricity refers officials to anti-corruption authority This news has been read 1021 times! KUWAIT CITY, Dec 24: Minister of Electricity, Water, and Renewable Energy, and Acting Minister of Public Works, Jassem Al-Ostad, has reported two ministry officials to the public authority for anti-corruption (Nazaha) on suspicion of corruption. The ministry disclosed to (KUNA) that an investigative committee, established by Al-Ostad immediately after discovering these violations, found that they “caused harm to numerous civilians and other entities.” The investigation revealed that the two individuals intentionally disrupted tenders related to electricity, causing damage to the electrical connections of civilian homes and other public projects. As per the statement, “the intentional disruption of tenders compelled individuals to purchase their cables, and coerced them into signing pledges not to seek compensation from the ministry,” consequently tarnishing the ministry’s reputation with allegations of incompetence. In recent months, Al-Ostad has referred several officials in government bodies under his purview to the public prosecution and Nazaha due to suspicions of corruption and misuse of public funds.

    "text": "I've said it several times and I'll say it again: DEI is poison. I know Donald Trump is going to be the nominee, but I was really pulling for Ron DeSantis, because he got stuff done, like pulling funding for DEI departments from Florida state schools. He sent the whole DEI department at New College of Florida packing. Trump had called for defunding DEI efforts in government organizations, but it was late in his term and we never got to see if he was going to follow through. As we learned from that congressional hearing with the three university presidents, Jews don't seem to fall under DEI protections. Calls for the genocide of the Jewish people had to be taken \"in context.\" Jewish Insider reports that a pro-Hamas professor from the University of Minnesota is up for the position of lead of the school's DEI department. Haley Cohen reports: A University of Minnesota professor who denied Hamas terrorists committed rape and sexual violence against Israeli women on Oct. 7 is being considered for a top administrative position in the college‚Äôs diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) department. Sima Shakhsari is an associate professor in the department of Gender, Women and Sexuality Studies, and has been seen on campus attending pro-Palestinian rallies chanting ‚ÄúGlobalize the Intifada.‚Äù Shakhsari, who uses they/he/she pronouns, also has a long history of aligning with radical groups like Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). Shakhsari‚Äôs denial that Israeli women were raped by Hamas came during the professor‚Äôs testimony last Thursday to the university review panel, part of the application process in being considered for the associate dean of the DEI office in the College of Liberal Arts position. The department of Gender, Women and Sexuality Studies, of course. Recommended How is this real?‚Äî Aviva Klompas (@AvivaKlompas) A [@UMNews]professor who denied terrorists committed rape and sexual violence against Israeli women on Oct. 7 is being considered for a top administrative position in the college‚Äôs DEI department. The same professor has been seen on campus attending rallies‚Ä¶ [December 22, 2023] \"The same professor has been seen on campus attending rallies chanting 'Globalize the Intifada.'\" Please. Those activities are what helped guarantee her the position.‚Äî Faye Hausendorff (@FayeH321) [December 22, 2023] Most likely. First, the school should do away with the Gender, Women and Sexuality Studies department. Then it should get rid of its DEI department. Diversity, equity, and inclusion ‚Äî whose job it is to deny admission to whites and Asian Americans. Of course it's the DEI dept. These people aren't qualified for anything else. It's a jobs program for racist leftists who want a job where they get paid to be racist.‚Äî Missus Bennet üöö üöõ (@poornerves) [December 23, 2023] It‚Äôs Minnesota, home of Omar, that‚Äôs why not only is it real, but foreseeable.‚Äî Always Looking for the Truth (@lehmanlaw) [December 22, 2023] True ‚Ä¶ it's the same state that just changed its flag to look more like Somalia's. DEI means hating white people and Western culture. Until recently, many (most?) Jews thought that did not include them, so they supported DEI. Now this.‚Äî LoveHerMadly (@Xlovehermadly) [December 22, 2023] What I don't understand is why people who acknowledge (and celebrate) that Hamas invaded Israel on October 7, killed over a thousand citizens, and took more than 200 hostages, are offended by the suggestion that Hamas terrorists raped anyone. They may have shot them or burned them alive, but rape? No way. It's like the people so triggered by those posters of the hostages that they tear them down ‚Ä¶ we thought they were happy that Hamas took hostages. DEI is poison‚Äî Nesher Capital (@NesherCapital) [December 22, 2023] Exactly. ***",

Repression forced the church underground in Soviet times and it now has about 4.5 million parishioners, or roughly 10% of the population of Ukraine.\nThe document from the Vatican’s doctrinal office said Roman Catholic priests can administer blessings to same-sex couples as long as they are not part of regular church rituals or liturgies.\nIt said such blessings would be a sign that God welcomes all but should not be confused with the sacrament of heterosexual marriage.\nGay rights are making some progress in Ukraine and other ex-Soviet states outside Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has expressed sympathy for upholding gay rights, though ruling out constitutional changes to allow single-sex marriages while the country is at war.\n(This story has been corrected to say ‘same-sex couples,’ not ‘same-sex marriage,’ in the headline)\n(Reporting by Ron Popeski; Editing by Chris Reese)\nDisclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.

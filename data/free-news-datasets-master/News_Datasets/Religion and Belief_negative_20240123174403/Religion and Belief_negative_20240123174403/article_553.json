    "text": "Will Emilie Gomis remain an ambassador for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games? The Organising Committee will meet at the beginning of January, as announced by its president Tony Estanguet on 20 December, in order to decide. The former basketball player is at the center of a controversy after an Instagram post on October 9, two days after the attacks perpetrated by Hamas in Israel.\nTo discover\nFive things to know about the 2024 Olympics ticketing Emilie Gomis had shared a message in which we saw maps of France from 1947, 1967 and 2023, on which the tricolor flag covering French territory is gradually replaced by the Israeli flag, with this question: \" What would you do in this situation?\n» Gomis obviously does not \"condone\" the October 7 attacks On Monday, December 11, the Paris 2024 Ethics Committee advocated its exclusion, considering that \"the publication can also legitimately be interpreted as suggesting that the France of 2023, whose map is dominated by the Star of David, is also 'invaded by Jews' \". In an interview with the newspaper L'Equipe , Gomis (40) spoke at length about the subject. It claims that its publication \" never intended to respond to the October 7 attack \" and that \" I obviously do not condone this massacre .\"\nEmilie Gomis says she wanted to \" just invite (her) subscribers to reflect on the current context which, I think, is beyond everyone \". \" I'm of African descent and have dual French-Senegalese nationality,\" Gomis adds. Colonization raises issues that are talked about on a daily basis there, and to which I am very sensitive.\" Born in Ziguinchor in Senegal and arrived in France at the age of 6, the former basketball player has 194 caps with Les Bleues, including winning the European Championship in 2009.\n'The right to make a mistake' «\nOf course I condemn \" Hamas' atrocities, Gomis continued. \" I said this to the Minister of Sport in my letter \" dated December 8. In addition, the ambassador is aware that her post went unnoticed before resurfacing via a screenshot on November 30 on LinkedIn and Twitter. \" A witch hunt has been launched. My status (as an ambassador) was targeted ,\" Gomis said.\nThe former Villeneuve-d'Ascq player says she is \" a thousand miles away from any anti-Semitism \" and is \"aware of the inadequacy of the timing\" of her publication. \" But I think that all of my commitments and the rest of my career argue that I have the right to make mistakes ,\" she adds.\nRead also2024 Olympics: after her controversial publication on Israel, Emilie Gomis defends herself and even threatens the Organizing Committee\nEmilie Gomis also spoke about the cyberbullying she has been subjected to for almost a month: \" I rediscovered that I was an immigrant. That I had been naturalized. These are things that happen when we are no longer in excellence : we are reminded of our origins. They want to take away my nationality. I'm rediscovering racism.\" Several times during the interview, the former resident of Tarbes, Valenciennes and Toulouse \" reiterates (her) apologies \". \" The only thing I can advocate today is that there be a ceasefire \" between Israel and Hamas, she said.\nSEE ALSO – Harry Kane's superb goal during Wolfsburg-Bayern on December 20 (1-2)",

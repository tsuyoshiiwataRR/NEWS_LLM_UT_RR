    "text": "The evil scriptwriters – Part 5 If the devil captures men of destiny, he gives them no room to repent, but hastens their mistakes and consequences to lead to untimely death. That was exactly what he did to Samson and King Saul in the Bible. In Ruth 1:3-5, we see a similar situation in the family of Elimelech and Naomi. The men all died untimely because the devil made them to take wrong decisions in life that was contrary to God’s original plan for them. By this, the evil scriptwriters write the obituary of men. It is important to note that whenever the enemy wants to write the obituary of men there are certain things that happen. First of them all, the victim begins to dream of dead relatives or friends. He/she may also dream of obituary, seeing his/her own obituary posters all over the place and even being in the ceremony and seeing one’s self lying-in-state in a coffin. Again, the victim may always dream of coffin and seeing him/herself covered with black cloth. Another thing that happens is that the victim’s ears become deafened to divine instructions or godly counsel. At this point, whatever advice you give to such a person is never accepted, rather the heart is set to go in its own way of error. Finally, the enemy will give him direction that will eventually lead to his untimely demise. This was the case with the family of Naomi in Ruth 1:3-5. They could not endure a little period of famine in Bethlehem and so they set out to Moab, a cursed land with people of perverted practices. God had no plan for them in such a place. Leaving Bethlehem, which means, “House of Bread” to Moab was the worst mistake this family ever made. Moab, at this time, was a flourishing city filled with immorality and idolatry. Anyone could be tempted to run there, especially in the time of lack and great suffering, as was experienced in Bethlehem, but understand that not all that glitters is gold. Often times, when we are faced with such situations, God wants us to trust and depend on Him, rather than follow our human reasoning. It is time to listen to what God is saying and not allow our ugly situation give us direction. In Moab, Naomi lost her husband and two sons. She returned to Bethlehem empty when she heard that the famine was over. Prov. 14:12 says there is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof is the way of death. The evil scriptwriters write the obituary of men and so book an appointment with untimely death to tally with their already prepared obituary plan. There are different strategies or mode of operations used to carry out their plans. One of them is by breaking your fellowship with God. They can stop you from praying and you are no longer eager to commune with God. They can also stop you from attending fellowship, using different excuses like being tired, busy, lack of transport means to the fellowship centre and so on. All of these can bring a spiritual gap between you and God, thereby giving room for the evil scriptwriters to operate in your life. May God frustrate their strategies over you in Jesus’ name. Prayer Points • Any power writing my obituary in the spirit realm, catch fire in Jesus’ name. • Every appointment with untimely death in my life and family, be cancelled in Jesus’ name. • Evil harvesters of soul, get out of my life and family Jesus’ name. • Problems assigned to lead me to make wrong decisions in life, expire by fire, in Jesus’ name. • O Lord, whatever I have lost as a result of my past mistake, restore them all by your mercies. • Father, by your mercy, return me from every wrong path I am treading upon right now in Jesus’ name. • O Lord, renew my fellowship with you in Jesus’ name.

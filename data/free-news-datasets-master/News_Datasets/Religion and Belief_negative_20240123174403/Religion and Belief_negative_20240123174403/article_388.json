The Kashmir police reported the incident and stated that the area has been secured and isolated, according to a\nreport from NDTV.\nExpressing concern over the rising incidents, the Kashmir Zone Police shared on social media, \"Terrorists fired upon Shri Mohd Shafi, a retired police officer at Gantmulla, Sheeri Baramulla, while praying Azan in the mosque and succumbed to injuries. Area has been cordoned off.\"\nIn recent months, there has been a disturbing pattern of targeted attacks on police officers in the region.\nIn response, security forces have heightened vehicle and pedestrian checks, particularly in Pulwama and other areas of Jammu and Kashmir. Mobile vehicle checkpoints have been established at key intersections in Srinagar and exit points from the city.\nThis troubling trend coincides with increased infiltration attempts by terrorists, adding to the challenges faced by security forces in the region.\nSave & read from anywhere!\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the\nSwarajya app.\nComments ↓\nSupport Swarajya Bring Out An Exclusive Ram Mandir Print Issue\nDear Reader,\nAs we approach a monumental event – the opening of the Ram Mandir – Swarajya prepares to mark this historic occasion with our finest print edition yet, filled with ground reports, historical analyses, and insightful columns from top thinkers of the country.\nThis isn't just another monthly issue – it's a special edition celebrating a crucial moment in our history.

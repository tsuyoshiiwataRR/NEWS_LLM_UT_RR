    "text": "As a concerned traveler, I have seen the discrimination and harassment that my Muslim friends have experienced at the hands of EL AL or Tel Aviv authorities. Each time they travel through Israel, they are subjected to over 5 hours of interrogation and humiliation - their phones searched, their dignity stripped away. This is not an isolated incident but a recurring pattern that has affected many innocent travelers.\nDelta Airlines recently expanded its partnership with Israel's EL AL airline. This move will likely result in more passengers being funneled through Tel Aviv for connecting flights in the future. Given the current discriminatory practices at this airport and at EL AL, it is highly probable that Muslim passengers will miss their connecting flights due to unnecessarily prolonged security checks.\nThis situation is not only unfair but also unjust. No one should be subjected to such treatment based on their religious beliefs or ethnicity. It goes against the principles of equality and respect for human rights which we all hold dear.\nAccording to a report by Haaretz, there were numerous complaints about ethnic profiling by EL AL or immigration authorities, where Arab passengers were often singled out for invasive security checks which include \"ridiculous, humiliatingly intimate questions.\"\nHere are some links to documented cases of discrimination:\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/us-said-to-investigation-el-als-alleged-discrimination-of-palestinian-american/#:~:text=The%20US%20Transportation%20Department%20has,to%20a%20Tuesday%20report%20on https://www.arabnews.com/node/2347711/world https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/01/renee-rabinowitz-sue-israeli-airline-el-al-orthodox-gender-discrimination https://www.haaretz.com/2010-05-02/ty-article/el-al-employees-complain-of-religious-discrimination/ 17f-ef2f-d3be-ad7f-ff2f5bc40000 https://adc.org/elal-airlines/ https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/entering-ben-gurion-airport-tel-aviv-skin-colour-ethnicity-religion-reasonable-suspicion/ https://www.globalvillagespace.com/muslim-travelers-ordeal-at-ben-gurion-airport-sparks-outrage/ https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-files-complaint-after-israeli-agents-detain-brutalize-american-citizen-at-ben-gurion-airport/ https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2014-10-30/ty-article/.premium/what-racial-profiling-is-like/ 17f-f0c3-d223-a97f-fddf742a0000 https://www.haaretz.com/2012-02-17/ty-article/airport-security-cant-treat-arab-israelis-like-suspicious-objects/ 17f-df26-d3ff-a7ff-ffa615530000 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_profiling_in_Israel\nWe urge Delta Airlines to suspend its partnership agreement with EL AL until these discriminatory practices are stopped completely by Tel Aviv authorities. We believe this action will send a strong message about Delta's commitment towards ensuring fair treatment for all its passengers irrespective of their religion or ethnicity.\nPlease sign this petition if you stand against discrimination and support equal treatment for all travelers.",

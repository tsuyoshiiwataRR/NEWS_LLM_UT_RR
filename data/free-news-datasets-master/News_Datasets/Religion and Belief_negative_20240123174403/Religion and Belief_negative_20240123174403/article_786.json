    "text": "NEW DELHI: Amid the Sports Ministry's decision to suspend WFI till further orders and simultaneous instructions to IOA to constitute an ad-hoc panel to control and manage the affairs of the body, its chief Sanjay Singh on Sunday said he will seek revocation of the suspension as no rules were flouted while taking decisions. The Ministry suspended the newly-elected Wrestling Federation of India stating that the body made a 'hasty announcement' of organising the U-15 and U-20 nationals 'without following due procedure and not giving sufficient notice to wrestlers' for preparations.The Ministry also pointed out that the new body was working under the 'complete control of former (WFI) office-bearers', which was not in conformity with the National Sports Code.\\\"We are seeking time from the sports minister and request that the suspension be lifted. If the issue is not resolved through dialogue, we could explore legal options,\\\" Sanjay Singh told PTI.â€” ANI (@ANI) \\\"We will explain that we have followed rules in taking decisions. We will present the proofs. Whatever decisions were taken, were taken by consensus. It was not my personal decision. 24 state associations had given affidavits and we have got e-mails, we have everything in writing,\\\" the sports administrator added.Meanwhile, Sakshi Malik, one of the prominent faces of the agitation against former WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, welcomed the WFI's suspension. 106249135 \\\"It is the first step towards something good happening. I hope the government understands more for what cause we were fighting,\\\" said Sakshi Malik.\\\"If a woman federation president is there, it will be better for the safety of women wrestlers. It was a fight for sisters and daughters of the country,\\\" she added. 106252075 Bajrang Punia, who had returned his Padma Shri medallion to the government on Friday in protest over election of Brij Bhushan loyalist Sanjay Singh as WFI President, said he won't take back his award.\\\"Now that I have returned it, I am not going to take it back. The honour of our sisters and daughters is bigger than any award. All of you have seen what is happening,\\\" the Tokyo Games bronze medal winner told PTI.\\\"I will think about taking it back only after justice is delivered. The matter is in court and we are waiting for justice,\\\" he added.Bajrang, Sakshi and Vinesh Phogat had accused Brij Bhushan of sexually exploiting women wrestlers during his tenure as WFI president.(With inputs from agencies)",

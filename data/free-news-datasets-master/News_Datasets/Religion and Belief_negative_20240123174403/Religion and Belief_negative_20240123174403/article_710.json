    "text": "Freedom From Religion Foundation - Ad from 2023-12-24 As featured on [Freedom from Religion Foundation](/places/freedom-from-religion-foundation/business_4000163340.html) Details for Freedom From Religion Foundation - Ad from 2023-12-24 PAID ADVERTISEMENT At this Season of the Winter Solstice MAY REASON PREVAIL The Freedom From Religion Foundation is working for a world in which . . . People are more important than dogma. Religions that teach hate, sexism, racism, trans- and homophobia are not pandered to. War, violence, terror and discrimination in the name of imaginary gods are no longer countenanced. Religion stays in its place . . . as a matter of conscience, but out of our laws and social policy. Basing our convictions about religion on reason rather than faith, tradition or authority, we believe that . . . There is no god. There is no sin . . . except ignorance and cruelty. There is no higher purpose . . . except what we make for ourselves. There is no hell . . . except what misguided humans make here on Earth. There is no heaven . . . except the paradise we could create here on Earth. The only afterlife that should concern any of us is leaving our descendants and Earth — \"our pale blue dot\" — a secure and pleasant future.

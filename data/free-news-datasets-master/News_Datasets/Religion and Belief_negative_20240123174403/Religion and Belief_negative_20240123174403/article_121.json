    "text": "2023-12-24 02:32:21 Cologne on alert. German police are carrying out searches this Saturday evening in the cathedral of this city in the west of the country with sniffer dogs, following a “danger notice” issued for New Year’s Eve. “Even though the information relates to New Year’s Eve, from this evening we will do everything possible to ensure the safety of visitors to the cathedral on Christmas Eve,” said Cologne police chief Michael Esser , quoted in a press release. After the evening mass and “in agreement with the head of security of the cathedral chapter”, the cathedral was searched with sniffer dogs, the police said. “On Sunday, all visitors will be subject to screening before entering the place of worship,” it is specified in the press release. “The police and the cathedral chapter recommend giving up bags and arriving early at masses,” it is still written. The German daily Bild claims on its website that security services in Austria, Germany and Spain have received indications that an Islamist group wants to carry out several attacks in Europe possibly on New Year’s Eve and Christmas. According to the newspaper, the targets of these attacks could be Christmas masses in Cologne, Vienna and Madrid. He also claims that the first arrests by special forces took place on Saturday in Vienna, as well as one in Germany. #Alert #Germany #police #mobilized #danger #notice #Cologne #Cathedral",

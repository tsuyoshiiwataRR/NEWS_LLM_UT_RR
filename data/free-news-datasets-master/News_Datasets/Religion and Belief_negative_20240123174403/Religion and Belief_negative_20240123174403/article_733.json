    "text": "Israel pushed on Sunday with its military campaign to destroy Hamas over the October 7 attacks, as the focus of the deadly combat shifted to southern Gaza where most displaced Palestinians are trapped.\nUS President Joe Biden stressed the \"critical need\" to protect civilians, in a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed Israel would \"continue the war until all of its goals have been achieved\", officials said.\nAs heavy fighting raged on, the Israeli army said it had struck another 200 targets in the past 24 hours in the besieged Palestinian territory where it is seeking to defeat Hamas and free remaining hostages.\nThe army said 153 troops had died in Gaza since it launched its ground invasion on October 27. Ten soldiers were lost in battles on Saturday, one of the deadliest days for the Israeli side.\n\"This is a difficult morning, after a very difficult day of fighting in Gaza,\" said Netanyahu. \"The war is exacting a very heavy price... but we have no choice but to keep fighting.\"\nThe army said soldiers had raided a northern Gaza compound near schools, a mosque and a clinic and found \"explosive belts adapted for children, dozens of mortar shells, hundreds of grenades and intelligence documents\".\nHamas rejected those claims as lies meant \"to justify their massacring of innocent civilians and their destructive aggression that has affected the entire infrastructure... in the already blockaded Gaza Strip\".\nThe bloodiest ever Gaza war broke out when Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7 and its militants killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\nThe gunmen also seized around 250 hostages, 129 of whom are believed to remain in Gaza following the exchange of captives for Palestinians prisoners during a week-long truce late last month.\nIsrael's withering military campaign, including massive aerial bombardment, has killed 20,424 people, mostly women and children, according to the territory's health ministry.\nVast areas of Gaza lie in ruins and its 2.4 million people have endured dire shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine due to an Israeli siege, alleviated only by the limited arrival of aid trucks.\nEighty percent of Gazans have been displaced, according to the UN, many now shielding against the winter cold in makeshift tents and forced into the south of Gaza even as ground fighting comes closer.\nNear the far southern Gaza city of Rafah, Umm Amir Abu Al Awf, 27, suffered wounds to her hand and legs in a strike on her house early Sunday.\n\"Who won?\" she said. \"Nothing has been achieved except killing civilians... They keep saying Rafah is safe. It is not safe. Nowhere is safe. Every house has a martyr and injured.\"\nIsraeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus indicated that forces were close to gaining operational control in northern Gaza and that now \"we focus our efforts against Hamas in southern Gaza\".\nFighting has raged in the main southern city of Khan Yunis, the birthplace of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader in Gaza and the man Israel holds most responsible for the October 7 attack.\nElsewhere, Palestinian rescuers scrambled again to pull survivors and bodies from the rubble of a destroyed residential building, after a strike hit in the central city of Deir Al Balah.\n\"I was praying when a huge explosion occurred,\" said Yazan Moqbel, a wounded man whose sister was still under the broken concrete. \"Rubble fell on us. I didn't know what happened.\"\nThe head of the UN refugee agency, Filippo Grandi, urged an end to the suffering in the third month of the war.\n\"For aid to reach people in need, hostages to be released, more displacement to be avoided and above all stop the appalling loss of lives, a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza is the only way forward,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\"War defies logic and humanity, and prepares a future of more hatred and less peace.\"\nOn Friday, the United States allowed the passage of a UN Security Council resolution that effectively called on Israel to allow \"immediate, safe and unhindered\" deliveries of life-saving aid to Gaza \"at scale\".\nWorld powers had wrangled for days over the wording and, at Washington's insistence, toned down some provisions -- including removing a call for a ceasefire.\nOne displaced Gazan, Ahmad Al Burawi, now living in Rafah in southern Gaza, said: \"We just want to return to our lands, that's all. We want a solution... People are dying.\"\nChristmas Eve among war As the war rages on, Christians around the world celebrate Christmas Eve, and festivities are usually held in the occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem where they believe Jesus was born.\nBut this year the city is almost deserted, with few worshippers around and no Christmas tree erected, after church leaders decided to forego \"any unnecessarily festive\" celebrations, in solidarity with Gazans.\nPalestinian president Mahmud Abbas voiced hope Christmas would mark \"a cessation of the Israeli war against the Palestinian people in Gaza, as well as across the occupied Palestinian territories\".",

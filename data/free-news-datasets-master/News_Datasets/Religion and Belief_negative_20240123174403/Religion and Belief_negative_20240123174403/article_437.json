    "text": "NAUGATUCK – Andrea D. (Dombroski) Redden, age 82, widow of Raymond E. Redden, passed away at her home on Monday, Dec. 18, 2023. Andrea and Ray were the epitome of opposites attract, devoted to each other for 40 years. They complimented each other through their life together, and all who love them are comforted knowing that they are together again.\nAndrea was born in Waterbury on May 7, 1941, daughter of the late Zigmond and Sadie (Mis) Dombroski. She was raised in Beacon Falls and was a longtime Naugatuck resident. She was a member of Holy Saviour National Catholic Church.\nAndrea was a dedicated community volunteer for many area organizations, a selfless caregiver for several family members and friends over the years, and a devoted mother who to this day is still referred to as “Field Trip Mom” by students she chaperoned at Central Avenue School.\nHer greatest joy was being a grandmother. She took special pleasure in giving them the treats their mom wouldn’t and having them join her while volunteering.\nAndrea leaves her daughter Denise Walsh and her husband Christopher, of Naugatuck; her four grandchildren, Molly Walsh and her fiance Kyle Sorenson, Daisy Walsh, Abby Walsh and Daniel Walsh; her sister-in-law Julie Ann Dombroski; her niece Christine Jecko, with her husband Sean and their children Ann Elizabeth and Jonathan; her nephew Matthew Dombroski, with his wife Tori and their daughter Savannah Sadie Dombroski; and several cousins, nieces and nephews all of whom received greeting cards full of stickers for every occasion big and small – no matter how old they got.\nShe was predeceased by her brother Rear Adm. John E. Dombroski.\nShe was blessed to be surrounded by a neighborhood of caring friends, old and new, who were quick to show her kindness and offer help frequently, despite her spirited insistence that she could still do it herself.\nHer funeral will be on Friday, Dec. 29, 2023, at 11 a.m. at the Naugatuck Valley Memorial/Fitzgerald Zembruski Funeral Home, 240 N. Main St., Naugatuck. Burial will follow in Holy Saviour Cemetery in Naugatuck. Visitation will be on Friday from 10 to 11 a.m. at the funeral home.\nTo send an online condolence, please visit naugatuckvalleymemorial.com",

    "text": "We are members of the JFAN Ministries, founded by Bishop Octavio Nevis, who recommended that we invest in Nevis Trading & Investment Consultants Pvt. Ltd. He assured us that the company's promoters were highly reputable in the market, promising a secure investment with a 5% monthly interest return. It was represented as a completely safe venture, assuring a prompt return of both the interest and the capital within a month.\nAfter investing with Mr. Joshua Nevis, the promoter of the company, it has now been two years, and we have yet to receive either the promised interest or our initial capital. Many individuals financed their investments through loans or by selling their homes, and people are now facing severe financial hardship. Despite repeated assurances and promised dates from Mr. Joshua Nevis, nothing has materialized. Unfortunately, Bishop Octavio Nevis has distanced himself from this matter, leaving the affected individuals in dire straits.\nThis situation has led to a significant negative impact on our community, with some members even facing homelessness. We urge everyone affected by this matter to join forces, sign this petition, and collectively raise our voices to address and rectify this issue. Let us unite in solidarity to bring attention to this matter and seek a resolution for the well-being of all affected individuals.",

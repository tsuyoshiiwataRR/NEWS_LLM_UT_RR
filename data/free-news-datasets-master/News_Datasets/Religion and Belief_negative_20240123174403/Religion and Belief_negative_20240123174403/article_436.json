    "text": "Social media influencer Kamiya Jani found herself embroiled in controversy following her visit to the Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri. Her visit led to a series of demands for apologies, protests, and accusations from various political factions and cultural outfits.Jani, known for Curly Tales and her food blogging, addressed the issue through a video on Instagram, clarifying that she is a practicing Hindu who has never consumed or endorsed beef. She highlighted her intention behind visiting the temple as seeking blessings and sharing information about the shrine’s infrastructure development. Jani expressed regret that her visit had turned into a contentious matter.The BJP strongly criticized her visit, labeling her as a “beef eater” and questioning her entry into a Hindu-only shrine. They demanded action against Jani and VK Pandian, a bureaucrat turned BJD leader, allegedly involved in facilitating her visit.In contrast, BJD MP Manas Mangaraj questioned the BJP’s objections, citing instances where the BJP government engaged Jani to create documentaries on Hindu heritage and temples, including visits to revered sites like Chardham and Ayodhya.Union Minister Giriraj Singh criticized Pandian for disrespecting the sanctity of the shrine by allowing the entry of someone perceived as promoting beef. Singh urged immediate action against those responsible.Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan emphasized the need to protect the sentiments of Odias and followers of Sanatan Dharma, without directly mentioning Jani.OPCC president Sarat Pattnayak demanded an apology from Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik if Jani’s visit was under his directive.Local outfit Shree Jagannath Sankruti Surakha Abhijan protested in Bhubaneswar, echoing the demand for action against Jani and Pandian.While Jani issued clarifications twice, Pandian distanced himself from the matter and declined to comment further, simply stating, “Jai Jagannath.”",

    "text": "PoliticsTerrorist attack on former cop an act of cowardice, insult to a worship place : Chugh By KNS Posted on Dec 24, 2023 | Updated on Dec 24, 2023 Share Tweet Share Srinagar Dec 24 (KNS): BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh has strongly condemned the incident in which a retired police officer was shot dead by terrorists while offering prayers at a mosque in Baramulla today. Chugh said it was not just a cowardly act of terrorists but was also an insult and disgrace to the religious place. He said it was a shame that terrorists fired on Mohammed Shafi, a former SP, during Azan in the mosque which showed how desperate they are. Attacking a person in the place of worship was the most heinous crime for which the terrorists will have to pay heavily, Chugh added.(KNS) Related Categories:Education Share Tweet Share Recommended for you Sagar chairs meeting of delegates, office bearers of Khanyar constituency Muzaffar Shah expresses concern over “prevailing situation” in J&K Sadhotra condemns killing of SSP by terrorists, seeks judicial probe in civilian killings in Rajouri",

    "text": "The Spirit of Christmas: War Criminals George W. Bush and Tony Blair banned from the Birthplace of Jesus Christ\nMay the Spirit of Christmas prevail in criminalizing war and bringing the war criminals to justice. Our thoughts during the Christmas period are with the millions of victims of US-NATO led wars and those waged by Israel against the people of Palestine.\nLet us extend the ban to the birthplace of Jesus Christ to all war criminals.\n*\nFirst published by GR in December 2006\nWar criminals George W. Bush and Tony Blair were banned for life in April 2003 from the Church of Nativity in Bethlehem, widely believed to be the birth-place of Jesus Christ. The ban was announced at the height of the illegal US-allied bombing and invasion of Iraq.\nBelow are the original 2003 press reports pertaining to that decision as well as a subsequent introductory note published by Global Research in December 2006.\n“The Bethlehem sanctuary issued a ringing reprisal Sunday [April 2003] of the coalition attack, going as far as barring US President George W. Bush, US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and UK Foreign Minister Jack Straw from entering church grounds, due to their “aggressive war on Iraq.”\n“The priest in the Church of the Nativity has every right to ban Bush and his supporters since they have marred the teachings of Christ. Their entry into the church will tarnish it as [Bush’s] hands are covered in the blood of the innocent,” Karmash told The Jordan Times.\nThe local priest went on to say that he felt the punishment was not enough. “We need a tougher one to eradicate evil at its very root,” he exclaimed.\nThe Nativity Church’s parishioner, Father Panaritius, said during a rally organised Sunday by the Greek Orthodox community in Bethlehem that Bush, Rumsfeld, Blair and Straw are “war criminals and children killers that will be banned from entering the church forever!”\nThe Church Parishioner Father Panaritius made the decision public at a massive protest demonstration organized by Orthodox institutions in front of the Church of Nativity.”They are war criminals and murderers of children. Therefore the Church of Nativity decided to ban them access into the holy shrine for ever,” the parishioner said.”\nThere is no indication from The Church of the Nativity that this ban on war criminals Bush, Blair et al. has been revoked.\nThis ban should be extended to a number of other Western leaders including presidents Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden who in the course of their mandate have waged illegal and criminal wars on the people of Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen.\nIn 2012, the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Tribunal has found former United States president George W. Bush and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair guilty of “crimes against peace”.\n“The five panel tribunal unanimously decided that Bush and Blair had committed genocide and crimes against peace and humanity when they invaded Iraq in 2003 in blatant violation of international law.”\nThe indictment was based on testimonies presented to the Tribunal as well the findings and report of the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission (KLWCC)\nMay the Spirit of Christmas prevail in criminalizing war and bringing the war criminals to justice. Our thoughts during the Christmas period are with the millions of victims of US-NATO led wars and those waged by Israel against the people of Palestine.\nMichel Chossudovsky,\nMember of the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission,\nGlobal Research, December 22, 2017\n* * *\n“Their entry into the church will tarnish it as [Bush’s] hands are covered in the blood of the innocent…”\nThe Spirit of Christmas consists in spreading Peace and Justice.\nThe Spirit of Christmas is when War Criminals are banned from the Birthplace of Jesus Christ.\nIn April 2003 at the height of the military campaign directed against Iraq, the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem decided to ban President Bush and Prime Minister Blair from the birthplace of Jesus Christ.\n“They are war criminals and murderers of children. Therefore the Church of Nativity decided to ban them access into the holy shrine for ever,”\n“Their entry into the church will tarnish it as [Bush’s] hands are covered in the blood of the innocent,”\nThe Church of the Nativity is under the authority of the Greek Orthodox church.\nOf utmost significance, the US News media has not reported this story.\nSpread the word to Church parishes in the US and around the World.\nUnseat the War criminals.\nMichel Chossudovsky, Global Research, 24 December 2006\nBETHLEHEM, April 01, 2003 (Online): The Church of Nativity, widely believed to be the birth-place of Jesus Christ, decided to ban entry each of the US President George Bush, his Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Foreign Secretary Jack Straw the privilege of visiting this sacred place, which is one of the holiest Christian shrines.\nThe move came in protest of “the aggressive war these leaders have waged against Iraq,” top Clergy of the church said.\nThe Church Parishioner Father Panaritius made the decision public at a massive protest demonstration organized by Orthodox institutions in front of the Church of Nativity.”They are war criminals and murderers of children. Therefore the Church of Nativity decided to ban them access into the holy shrine for ever,” the parishioner said.\nAMMAN — Jordan Times. Parish Priest of the Greek Orthodox community in Amman, Economos Constantine Karmash, said Tuesday he fully supports the Church of the Nativity decision to ban a number of top coalition leaders from entering the house of worship.\nThe Bethlehem sanctuary issued a ringing reprisal Sunday of the coalition attack, going as far as barring US President George W. Bush, US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and UK Foreign Minister Jack Straw from entering church grounds, due to their “aggressive war on Iraq.”\n“The priest in the Church of the Nativity has every right to ban Bush and his supporters since they have marred the teachings of Christ. Their entry into the church will tarnish it as [Bush’s] hands are covered in the blood of the innocent,” Karmash told The Jordan Times.\nThe local priest went on to say that he felt the punishment was not enough. “We need a tougher one to eradicate evil at its very root,” he exclaimed.\nThe Nativity Church’s parishioner, Father Panaritius, said during a rally organised Sunday by the Greek Orthodox community in Bethlehem that Bush, Rumsfeld, Blair and Straw are “war criminals and children killers that will be banned from entering the church forever!”\nKarmash explained that the banning was different from an official church ban, or “excommunication,” which requires a supreme church power. If this is done, the excommunicated are no longer considered members of the church and will not be provided any church services such as a marriage or funeral.\nBush and his supporters are not members of the Greek Orthodox Church, said Karmash, hence they cannot be subjected to an official church ban.\n“We hope that their respective churches, which condemn the current war, will strip Bush and his supporters from their church rights so that they become ostracised from their church as they have become ostracised by the humanitarian and international community,” pointed out the priest.\nWednesday, April 2, 2003\nProf Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research , 2023 Comment on Global Research Articles on our Facebook page",

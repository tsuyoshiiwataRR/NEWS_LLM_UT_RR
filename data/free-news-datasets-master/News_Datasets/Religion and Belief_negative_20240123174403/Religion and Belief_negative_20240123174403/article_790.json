    "text": "Recommended Stories\nThe Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Sunday submitted a memorandum to the Bhadrak district SP demanding action over alleged disrespect to Lord Ram.\nAccording to the allegations, a cultural programme under the Odisha government's ‘Yuva Odisha, Nabin Odisha’ programme was organised at Agarpada College in Bhadrak district on Saturday.\nAlso Read:\n‘Yuva Odisha Nabin Odisha’: BJP, Congress accuse BJD of misguiding youths\nAs a part of this programme, a play was staged. It was alleged that Lord Ram's caricature in the play was objectionable and distasteful. The incident came to the fore after a video clip of the play went viral. Taking exception to such an act, the VHP submitted a memorandum to the SP wherein the outfit demanded action against those who staged the play and who organised the programme.\n“A play on Lord Ram was staged at a government college under a government programme. In the play, Lord Ram’s character portrayal is objectionable. It has hurt the sentiments of the Hindus. We demand action against those who were performing and those who organised the programme. So, we visited the offices of the district Collector and the superintendent of police (SP),” said VHP secretary, Basant Rout.\n- Reported by:\n- Partha Sarathi nayak",

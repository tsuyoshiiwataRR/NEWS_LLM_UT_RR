In that eventful year, Persian invaders assassinated the Babylonian king Belshazzar. Just moments prior, Belshazzar had seen his assassination prophesied by the famous handwriting on the wall: “Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin,” (“the Numberer is numbered”).\nRuling as God by divine appointment, Belshazzar had profaned the sacred vessels of the Israelite temple. This was the unpardonable sin of blasphemy, for which God sent the Persians to destroy him.\nBelshazzar’s priests were evidently spared. Rather than submit to the Persian conquerors, they furtively gathered together all their portable treasures, entitlements, codes, inscriptions, astrology, sacred formulae, and insignia and fled with them northwesterly to Pergamum. Since the rulers of Pergamum were already practicing Babylonian religion, they were honored to receive the fugitive Babylonian College and their great endowment.\nWhen Attalus III died in 133 BC, he bequeathed all his kingdom’s Babylonian grandeur to the Romans. But no Roman emperor was deemed fit to receive it because the Roman constitution had never suffered a man to be deified. The bequest lay unclaimed until 48 BC, when Caius Maria Caesar was declared God Almighty in the Serapion, Alexandria’s temple of Jupiter.\nBut Caesar never conquered Persia so Caesar never united Babylon which the pope will accomplish ruling today as the pontifex maximus in the seat of Belshazzar and Ceasar.\nPage\n1\nTop\nPrevious Page\nNext Page\nBack to Forum\nPost New Thread\nReply\nView Favorites\nRelated Threads\n1\nBREAKING: Saudi Arabia's enlightened AI Mahdi bot army ditches axis of evil deal with Israel & AmeriKKKa & defects to BRICSOPEC+\n09/29/23\n2\nBREAKING!

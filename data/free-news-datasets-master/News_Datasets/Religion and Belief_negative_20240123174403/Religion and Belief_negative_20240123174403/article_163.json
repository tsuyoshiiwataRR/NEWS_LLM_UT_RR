    "text": "\nAttacks on Freedom of Religion\nAt the turn of the last century, Jewish immigrants who sought to observe the Sabbath Day faced a work culture in the United States that required employees to work on Saturdays. A person could be employed Sunday through Friday, not come to work on Shabbos, and be summarily fired.\nThis culture led to a lot of stories that we celebrate of people who put their principles first. When Jews lose the Shabbos, we lose ourselves. But it also surely led to a great deal of assimilation, as families decided that putting food on the table was more important than a remnant custom from the Old Country.\nOf course, these were stories we heard as children. And even then, they seemed hard to believe. What kind of employer would let an employee go, if that employee worked hard and well? After all, pay was only in return for hours worked, so a policy that fired Sabbath-observing Jews seemed to defy logic – and we like logic. Maybe the stories were really exaggerated…?\nNot so much.\n[New NY bill would require restaurants in transit centers to be open on Sundays]New York and New Jersey might require restaurants along the New York State Thruway [and Port Authority] to stay open to travelers seven days of the week.This bill is aimed squarely at a Christian company, Chick-fil-A, as a direct attack on religious freedom.I know well that there is no shortage of similar outrages (abortion, cake-baking, etc.). But this one really sticks in my craw as overt and institutionalized evil. If you believe that G-d commanded you to not work on the Sabbath Day, but a government tries to coerce you to act against G-d’s word…. what scumbags.Published in [General]This post was promoted to the Main Feed by a Ricochet Editor at the [recommendation of Ricochet members].

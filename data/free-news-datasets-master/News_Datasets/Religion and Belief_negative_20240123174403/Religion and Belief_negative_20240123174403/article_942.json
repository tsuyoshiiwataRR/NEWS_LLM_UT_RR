    "text": "2023-12-24 17:28:51 No one in Catalonia knows as much about Islam as she does. Nor does anyone explain it with their knowledge, passion and vehemence. It looks like he’s scolding you, but he’s not. If this piece of woman scolded you, don’t worry that you would notice. Dolors Bramon (Banyoles, 1943) is the religion teacher we should all have had. This year he received the Cross of Sant Jordi and published Professor of Islam (Fragmenta Editorial), a book-conversation with Ignasi Moreta. In this interview we talk about God and the different ways of understanding him, but we also go to Carrero Blanco or Ernest Lluch, her first husband. When was the last time you asked God for something? — I’ve never asked him for anything, I’m used to freaking out. My grandfather was very renegade and one day I asked God to convert him, but I must have been six or seven years old. I haven’t spent much, by God, but I’ve earned my living thanks to God, in both senses of the word. What is the latest explanation you have found for why so many people believe in God? — There are people who need support. In life there are problems, and if you have the consolation of religion it goes very well. If you don’t have it, if you can’t ask God for anything, you should freak out. And you usually end up getting away with it, huh? It’s not that essential either, I think. I don’t think you have to be a good person because there is a superior being. You have to be a good person for your personal dignity. I haven’t needed God, but there are people who do and I think that’s fine, I have nothing against believers. Do you think you’ll need it, God? There are people who may never have believed and in the last years of their lives they are looking for something. — Heh, heh, forgive me for laughing. It’s just that sometimes I think: “Let’s see if in the end you’ll end up believing in God”. No, I never said that God did not exist. It is a pride to say that it exists and it is also a pride to say that it does not exist. what do i know I’m agnostic, I don’t know if there is a God or not. If there is, I haven’t needed it for now. If there isn’t, neither. But are you afraid that you might be needed one day? – No, I’m afraid not. makes me laugh What is the difference between the three monotheistic religions: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam? — Much less what their practitioners do not want to think and believe. All three groups have spent their lives looking for more differences than similarities. And in this they were wrong. all All three come from the same God. There is some small difference. For example, Judaism does not believe in the Virgin Mary. Islam, yes. Jesus is a great prophet son of a virgin mother. And it makes sense: an almighty God can cause a virgin mother to give birth to a child or to twenty-eight. Therefore, Allah… — It’s the Arabic way of saying Ten. …is not another. — Of course not. Now, if we were in class, you would already have a suspension. Therefore, there is only one God and both Jesus, on the one hand, and Muhammad, on the other, would be prophets? — No, because for Christians Jesus is God. This is the mess that Jesus is the second person of the Holy Trinity. They took great care to tell us Taradell and Banyoles people, when we were small, that this was a mystery and that you should not try to understand it, because it cannot be understood. If there is a God, there can only be one. And the Qur’an says this very clearly: God is a superior, eternal and creative being. If there were more than one god, each of those gods would claim what he had created. And I’m not interested in the god who created AIDS or earthquakes. I am interested in the god who created good things.

You have explained many times where Ernest Lluch, your first husband, took you the first day you went out together… — Oh, yes. Al Price, let’s watch a boxing match: Ben Ali vs. Vetroff. And I didn’t dislike it. But I never went back. You separated in 1984 and he was killed in 2000. Do you remember the last time you saw each other before his death? — I don’t remember, we used to see each other, we had three daughters together. What has not been explained and may be of interest is that the three daughters and I were very healthy when he was killed. It was murder. So you are left with white, green and yellow. We set up, without realizing it, a kind of competition because you can’t imagine the number of people who had dinner with Ernest the night before he was killed. The girls said: “He filled the Barça field. Everyone had dinner with him.” And I arrived, who had been to Ethiopia, and I said: “Girls, I beat you, I met the last person who saw the old people when they left the parking lot.” This was already insurmountable. We took it very badly, but very well. A lot of people have had their father die, it’s worse murder, okay, but it’s something you can deal with. They had a hard time when they went to the doctor, for example, and were asked: “What illnesses have you had? What did the father die of?” And they had to say: “Murder”. Look, today [l’entrevista la fem el dimecres 20 de desembre] 50 years ago ETA killed Carrero Blanco. I was glad about that, I must confess. It will be fatal for me to say it. Notice, between ETA killing Carrero Blanco and you being happy about it, and ETA killing Ernest Lluch, just over 25 years pass. — Yes, yes, things had changed. We didn’t see it as murder, but almost as a good deed. We didn’t know that Arias Navarro would be worse. You, as the mother of Ernest Lluch’s daughters, as his first wife, do you also consider yourself in some way a victim of ETA? — Man, clear. It was a blow to many people. If you die, and in this way, it is immediately holy right away. That is true, but I will say no more. That Ernest was made a saint on the spot, you mean. — Right away. And everyone And it can’t be to everyone’s liking. We never please everyone. In this case, ETA was killing for some ideas. But in the name of God a lot has been killed. — Much more than on behalf of anyone. All groups of believers have killed more in the name of God than in the name of anything else. And why? — Because humanity is a beast and if you think you have the truth… You asked me about these three ways of understanding God. I don’t usually talk about religions, but about ways of understanding God. There is a God, if there is one, and everyone understands him in their own way. The problem with people who think that there is only one God – and that it is theirs – is that they always believe that they have the truth and that they can kill in the name of that truth. Lately, we have the tendency – I would say biased, you will confirm it – that in the name of God only Islam kills. – Nooo. It is a big mistake made by some who call themselves Muslims. Why this shouting “Al·lahu-àkbar” at the time of killing is an aberration, because God forbids you to kill. This does a lot of harm to Islam and not all Muslims, far from it, agree with it. I meant that historically all religions have killed. – All. Man, European Catholics, especially Hispanics, have a very checkered past. If you think about the Inquisition, I don’t need to tell you anything. We can’t brag about it. Do you know what happens? That now these three religions are going to the right. There is no one to stop this, they all go towards conservatism. But Catholics now have a more progressive Pope, don’t they? The latest he has done is to say that the Church will bless homosexual unions. — Yes, exactly, now you said it: bless. And if they want to get married? What if your sister wants to be a chaplain? Huh? Everything goes to the right. Let’s see, when the popes speak from the throne, that is to say, inspired by the Holy Spirit, I think: “This Holy Spirit is a bit strange, because John XXIII was inspired by certain things, Ratzinger by others and the present one by others”. This papa has been opened. Wait for the next one. The Curia is a lot of Curia and Rome is a lot of Rome. I’m listening to you and I think what a shame I didn’t have a teacher like you, a non-believer, who explained religions to me. — It has nothing to do with it. Precisely if you don’t believe in anything, you have more capacity for reasoning. Whenever he started a course, he told them: “Faith is outside the classroom. I’m not interested in what religious thought you have, nor should you be interested in whether I have one or not.” That was not a catechesis. Seen this way, chaplains should not teach religion. — They shouldn’t, no. It’s just that now maybe I’m getting ahead of a question you’ll ask me later, which is whether religion should be taught in schools. I would be in favor of a person like me teaching all religions. How do you want to understand a Romanesque capital? Or Verdaguer? Or Carner? Or Spirit? Now that you have said Espriu, do you think that lately Catalonia’s admiration for Israel has disappeared? — Notice, the first trip that President Pujol made abroad was to Israel. In an Islamic country it may have taken fifteen years to get there. He went to Tunisia. We Catalans have had a predilection for Israel, largely thanks to Franco’s mora guard, who entered many towns and did a lot of damage. Espriu also contributed: the persecuted people, the persecuted language… This began to change with Ariel Sharon and the brutality of Sabra and Xatila. In this latest war between Israel and Hamas, who do you go with? I’m telling you because you can’t seem to follow what’s going on without going with one or the other. — I can’t go with anyone, but I’ll tell you something. The idea is from Salah Jamal, a lovely person, a Palestinian who has been here for many years. One day he said: “Imagine that you are going to see a film of thewest and he arrives late, and when he arrives, the screen shows an apache pulling a white man’s hair. What will you think? That the Apaches are… But you arrived late to the film”. With that, everything is said. The best thing that has happened to you this past year is that you were given the St George’s Cross? — I was excited. a lot I’m curious to know who did me good to be given it. Isn’t that what they say in your town? Yes, and that’s all it says. Dolors, when was the last time you bit your tongue? — Now, here with you, ha ha ha. No, I’ve always said what I thought. I would say always. And that’s how it went for me. I’ve had difficulties here at university, for example, but I’ve come out of it. You know what I like the most? When I meet ex-students on the street and they say: “You taught me how to think”. More than one has told me. It’s nice to have been taught to think. Since I have not believed in any religion, I have spoken calmly and rigorously about them all. And the worst news of this last year is that you will turn 80 on December 31st? — Oh, no, I love getting old. Neither round nor square numbers. What I want is to find myself well. Look, good news from last year. They did a biopsy to find out if I had cancer and I was in Madrid doing a master’s degree and they called me in the middle of class. I picked up the phone and said, from the podium: “I don’t have cancer!” And they applauded me. The last two questions are the same for everyone. Could you tell me a song from El Último de la Fila? — I can’t tell you a song, but I know them. Now they are out of fashion… Ask me about The Tyets, but not El Último de la Fila. The last words in this interview are yours. — Thank you very much, I must tell you. Because sometimes you meet people who ask you questions that you don’t know what to say. And you haven’t done any of these to me. A conversation in the same classroom where he studied We recorded the interview with Dolors Bramon in room 113 of the University of Barcelona, the same class where she studied the first course of economics in 1961. She walks around, looks at her, observes what has changed and what she is the same, and ends up regretting that she is left. Francesc Melcion’s photo session represents torture for him. It hasn’t started yet and I wish it was over. What Dolors likes is talking, “what I’ve done all my life: preach”. When the conversation ends, he runs off to catch the “bus”, the Teisa bus, towards Banyoles. An hour and a quarter that will be used to read or to sleep. “When I arrive, I have to buy for these days, you see the shops and it seems that in Banyoles people only eat at Christmas”.

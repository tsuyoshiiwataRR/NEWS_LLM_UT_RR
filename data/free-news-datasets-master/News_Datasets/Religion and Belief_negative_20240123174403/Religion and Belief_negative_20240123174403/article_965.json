Number one: Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor, thou shall not covet thy neighbor’s wife, or his goods. These are a few issues with Donald Trump as leader. He has said he alone can save us and get retribution; God said vengeance is mine, I will repay. Can he shoot someone in Times Square and not lose a vote, can he commit adultery as often as he wants, even when his wife is home with a baby? Has he not lied when he called Mike Pence a traitor? Please, people, wake up and see the evil and deception in this man. Don’t vote for him because he is against abortion. He is against all that most people with a conscience believe. Let’s keep religion and politics separate. Think and vote for the best person to help this country to be whole again. Don’t vote for someone who betrays his friends for his own benefit and profit.\nPalma Moyer\nRichland Township\nHeritage Foundation provides propaganda, not facts I have a simple, but lengthy question: Why does The Morning Call continue to print right-wing propaganda generated by the Heritage Foundation, a known Republican think tank that, among other things, helped write the Project 2025 document? That’s the “presidential transition project” that provides a clear and detailed outline of how to create a Republican administration in the United States that will subjugate democratic thought and pave the way for a long-term authoritarian government under Donald Trump and his successors. I grow tired of these attempts to be duped into believing what the Heritage Foundation claims are facts, when in reality are nothing but prejudicial claims aimed at toppling the Biden administration.\nDennis Scholl\nHellertown\nFellow diner’s kindness left lasting impression On entering the Hanover Eatery alone, I encountered a stranger, Mary, with whom I shared a unique story. Mary invited me to join her and her friend for breakfast. I was very grateful for her kind invitation and explained that I was expecting my friend Anne at any time.\nToward the end of our meal, Mary came by to wish us a Merry Christmas, which was so thoughtful and, of course, was reciprocated, and then she left.\nWhen waiting for our bill, our waitress came over to tell us it had been paid by Mary. We were so absolutely and pleasantly surprised, to say the least, by such a kindly, gratuitous act. Perhaps we may not meet Mary ever again, but will remember being overwhelmed by her spirit of kindness and generosity. Thank you and God bless, Mary.\nKathy Rich\nBethlehem\nGOP wrong on impeachment, funding for Ukraine The Day One Dictator has issued his orders and as a result the obsequious Republicans in the House of Representatives have voted unanimously to launch an investigation into whether there is any evidence of wrongdoing on the part of President Biden that would rise to the level of warranting impeachment. Undoubtedly tens and tens of millions of taxpayers’ dollars will be spent on this fishing expedition, while in the meantime no additional funding will be forthcoming to prevent Putin from defeating and then annexing Ukraine. My heart goes out to the Ukrainians who are about to experience the full impact of a seasoned dictator’s plan of expansion at the expense of the fledgling democracy that is Ukraine.\nJames McMahan\nLower Macungie Township\nHoliday Pops show featured impressive performances On Dec. 16, my family and I enjoyed two hours of outstanding holiday entertainment. We were in attendance for the annual Holiday Pops presented by Miller Symphony Hall. The Allentown Symphony Orchestra was amazing as always. Additional performances were equally impressive. Dancers from Accent School of Dance and the O’Grady Quinlan Academy of Irish Dance performed flawlessly. An additional highlight was the inspiring voices of the Emmaus High School Chorale; what a talented group of young people! Thank you to all the participants and all those connected to this wonderful holiday event; a perfect way to enjoy the holiday season. Merry Christmas!\nPatricia Smull\nEaston\nPennDOT signs don’t help drivers protect road workers Will someone at PennDot please explain why: (1) There are so many “work zones” where nobody is working or likely to be working for weeks; (2) why the flashing signal telling drivers if the work zone is active and requires slowing down is placed toward the middle or the end, not the beginning, of the work zone; and (3) why work zone signs remain in place seemingly forever, well after the work is done. Drivers want to protect workers, but when the signage bears no relationship to the actual work situation, they get frustrated — and ignore the 55 mph limits.\nJack Johannes\nAllentown\nPeace Pilgrimage made more difficult by current events For me, the Peace Pilgrimage of 2023 was more challenging than ever, and not just because of my age. It was harder to balance and stay focused on the path ahead, especially with two wars raging, and weapons needed for both.\nShould we step forward with aid for Ukraine, arm Israel to fight with Hamas or stand aside? How can we ignore the suffering of the innocent people whose lives are in ruins? How can we stop the killing and find our way out of the labyrinth of endless wars?\nIt is not easy to continue walking from Nazareth to Bethlehem when real people in another Bethlehem and Nazareth face fear and hatred every day. It is hard, knowing how long the people of Ukraine have been suffering. It is not easy to walk knowing even the children have no safe places. Should we keep walking? Should we keep arming? Can we find a way to force the raging wars to stop without using force?\nThis December we joined many first-time pilgrims, stubbornly walking, hoping for the impossible, hoping to find the road to peace. Maybe, what we really need is for everyone, everywhere to join us.\nDebra Orben\nSpringfield Township\nThe Morning Call encourages community dialogue on important issues.

    "text": "Hyperspace Technologies Limited, a Lagos-based Web3 startup, has secured its second patent and trademark for CipherCHIP Tap2verify, a blockchain-integrated contactless product authentication and verification system.\nDeveloped within the research and development (R&D) division of Hyperspace Technologies Ltd., the “CipherChip Tap2Verify” system is a new approach to product authentication by integrating Near Field Communication (NFC) tags, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and blockchain technology. Presents perspective.\nRecall that the startup secured a patent in August this year for CipherKey Tap2Sign™️ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), a next-generation security system that leverages the decentralized nature of blockchain, the strength of public/private key cryptography, and Designed for lifting. Features Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to provide an unprecedented level of protection against identity theft, phishing and social engineering attacks.\nThe trademark for CipherCHIP Tap2verify was granted on October 20, 2023 under the category of scientific, marine, surveying, electric, photographic, cinematographic optical, weighing, measuring, signaling, checking (observing), life-saving and teaching apparatus and instruments. , Apparatus for recording transmission or reproduction of sounds or images; magnetic data carrier recording disk; Automatic vending machines and mechanisms for coin-operated equipment; Cash registers, calculating machines, data processing equipment and computers; Free-extinguishing device.\nCommenting on the journey of securing the patent and trademark, the principal inventor of MFA, Dr. Oluseyi Akindinde, highlighted its potential to revolutionize product origination and authentication.\n“In an era where counterfeiting has become increasingly sophisticated, ensuring product authenticity is paramount. CipherCHIP Tap2verify addresses this challenge by combining the unique identification capabilities of NFC tags with the immutable nature of blockchain technology, which is further enhanced by the uniqueness of NFTs,” Akindeinde said.\nAkindeinde said CipherCHIP provides an unprecedented solution to Tap2verify product authentication challenges. By seamlessly integrating NFC tags, NFTs and blockchain, it provides an unbroken chain of trust from manufacturers to consumers, he said.\nSource: leadership.ng",

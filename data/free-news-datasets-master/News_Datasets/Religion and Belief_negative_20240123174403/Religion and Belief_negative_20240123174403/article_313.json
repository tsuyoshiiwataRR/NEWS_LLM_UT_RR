    "text": "IT'S set to be a silent Christmas in Bethlehem this year as the shadow of war looms large over the region. In years gone by, the birthplace of Jesus has been known for vibrant celebrations and parades throughout the city, however Paul Calvert, a Carlisle-born journalist said there is a sombre atmosphere this year. \"There's usually a huge celebration. We usually have Christmas markets, and international markets, parades in the streets, giant nativity scenes but there's nothing this year. \"The war is affecting people in Bethlehem differently than the people of Gaza. Bethlehem is built on tourism, but with no tourists hotels are empty, and many have lost their jobs in the hospitality industry,\" he said. Paul, [who has been running the Christian radio station Hayah based in Bethlehem,](https://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/23849116.paul-calvert-commited-staying-israel-palestine-conflict-zone/) described how one church has made a nativity scene where they have the baby Jesus in rubble to represent and show solidarity with Gaza. \"The churches of the Middle East decided that they were going to celebrate a very low-key Christmas this year. No Christmas lights, no Christmas tree. \"It's a very sad feeling but it's a very difficult time at the same time,\" he said. Paul emphasised the real impact of the conflict on daily life as rockets continue to fly overhead with daily alerts being received regularly. \"We're not seeing that in the news, we're just seeing what is happening in Gaza.\" According to Al Jazeera, as of December 21, around 20,000 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli bombardment since October 7. The revised death toll in Israel stands at 1,200. \"This is the first time I've gone through something such as a war. \"I've got friends here in Bethlehem from Gaza, they are very concerned. Every day we're doing a prayer to remember to pray for Gaza and remember the families. \"Their family is currently held up in a church in Gaza. You stand on your faith and this is what builds your faith. \"It's easy to be a Christian when everything is going good, but is it easy when everything around you is falling apart - when war is happening, this is the time God builds trust in your life,\" Paul said. Looking ahead into the new year, Paul hopes the war 'finishes' and 'peace comes'. \"I'd like to see something different happening in Gaza, they need to have good leadership, and leadership that isn't pushing for a fight and a war all the time. \"It was a terrorist organisation running Hamas, the people of Gaza don't want this war, the Israelis don't want to send their sons and daughters to war. \"We pray for something different to happen in Gaza, good leadership, strong economy and somewhere for tourists to go,\" he said. Despite the ongoing turmoil, Paul will aim to find some Christmas spirit by watching traditional classics like Mr Bean and The Vicar of Dibley and celebrating with friends over food.

    "text": "A controversial video game which lets you play as Jesus Christ allows you to fight the Devil and relive the 40 days and nights in the desert. PC gamers can currently get their hands the demo of 'I am Jesus Christ' on Steam, where the son of God has his life adapted into pixelated punch-outs with demons and passages from The Bible are drafted into a first-person action feature. With 15 years of Catholic School experience and a glowing knowledge of Monty Python's wonderful The Life of Brian, it was up to me to see what God's son was doing in a video game described by one player as needing \"a lot of work\".

'I am Jesus Christ' is not without controversy â€“ developers SimulaM already fielded criticism from Fox News and devout Facebook commenters on whether they should adapt the life of a holy figure into a game where you can shoot smoke from Christ's hand. Four years on from a spiky reception to its trailer and the full game is seemingly no closer to release. But developers over at SimulaM did release the Prologue, a playable demo of what is to come. What better time and way to enjoy the story of Christ than sat in a dark, cold flat in the middle of December, clicking away at a poorly rendered Nazareth and searching for John the Baptist. One Bible passage and a loading screen later and I am Jesus Christ begins. Its controversy stems from the belief the words of The Bible and the life of Christ should not be adapted. Monty Python has been down this route before. But where John Cleese and Eric Idle defended the film as being Jesus-adjacent, I am Jesus Christ has no defence if it botches the word of God. Though Jesus himself controls well and can parkour around Nazareth as much as a clunky walk cycle will offer, the gameplay and jittery pace is headache-inducing. One of many sins 'I am Jesus Chris' commits is awful writing. It has the scale to work and adapts, rather loosely, the ins and outs of The Bible in an Assassin's Creed meets the Chapters of Mark event, but without the guiding light the bumper book of messages provides billions. Early quests will find players plodding back and forth between stiff and vague adaptations of Mary Magdalene and John the Baptist before the real excitement begins, fighting the Devil and holding down left click to pray over an endless ocean. Main character Christ is quite nimble and does not take fall damage, handy for when leaping into the air and tumbling down the hills of Southern Nazareth, but he does require a needy supply of berries to keep his hunger meter filled. As players are encouraged to wolf down berries and perform miracles, it may surprise readers to hear the game itself is, at its core, pretty solid. Its writing needs some work and the wooden vocal performances from the main characters are a real drag, but when it gets to the meat and potatoes of performing otherworldly acts, the game does shine. Pre-rendered cutscenes give a glimpse at the Devil, who is portrayed here as some sort of large mutant alien disguising himself as Lex Luthor in a robe. Deflecting projectiles and combat comes down to complete pot luck and it would be wise to pray to some deity for any chance of progressing through a fight without the clunky mechanics playing their part. Where I am Jesus Christ will need a miracle to reach a wider audience, sift through the wreckage of demo-ready game mechanics and what shines through is a sincere crack at adapting the Bible and the life of a well-known religious figurehead.

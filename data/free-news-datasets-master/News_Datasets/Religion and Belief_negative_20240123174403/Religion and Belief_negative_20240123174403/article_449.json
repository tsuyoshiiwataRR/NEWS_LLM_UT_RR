    "text": "After losing two women due to the violence of their loved ones this year, we need to emphasise Jesus' calling this Christmas by being peacemakers, seeking to resolve conflicts and promote harmony. Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection Sashi Kiran says highlighted this during a Christmas celebration that was held at the Sacred Heart Cathedral Church, where the Shri Vivekanand Culture Centre and the Indian High Commissioner Shri Karthigeyan were also part of the event. Kiran says from this violence, 60 percent of our women have undergone some form of violence by their loved ones and 70 percent of all rapes reported this year were against children and minors. She asks how can we keep quiet when we know our loved ones are suffering, our elders and people living with disabilities get abused by their relatives who are supposed to provide love, support and protection. She adds these vulnerable are our people, they are our responsibilities and it is time to focus on the golden rule that is emphasised in the Bible by Matthew chapter 7 verse 12 which is Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. The Assistant Minister says the Golden Rule will also guide us in how we treat and respect other people, our environment as well our animals. Kiran says this is also an opportunity to inspire people of different faiths to live a more compassionate, loving and selfless life. She says if this becomes our way of life, imagine what a beautiful world we will all contribute to. Stay tuned for the latest news on our radio stations",

    "text": "Bad luck: what things should not be borrowed on Christmas Eve Christmas Eve is one of the most solemn holidays that believers look forward to when they gather with their families. Our ancestors believed that you can't borrow some thing on this day to avoid bringing trouble and misfortune. OBOZ.UA has compiled a list of such things. Spend this holiday with your family at a dinner with twelve lean dishes. Salt Salt is a popular tool for magical rituals, which can lead to bad luck and trouble. Therefore, it is better to buy salt in the store if you really need it. Cookware Cookware can affect the energy state of the house. Before Christmas Eve, check all the dishes and throw away the ones with cracks. This way, you will not attract negative energy into the family. Broom People believed that only a witch would borrow a broom on a holiday. If you give this thing away on Christmas Eve, you will have financial and health problems. Bread Ancestors used to say that a person would come to borrow bread in the morning if he or she really needed it. On this holiday, people usually borrow baked goods only with bad intentions to bring misfortune to their families. Money On Christmas Eve, you can't take money out of the house because the family will be haunted by poverty until the next Christmas.

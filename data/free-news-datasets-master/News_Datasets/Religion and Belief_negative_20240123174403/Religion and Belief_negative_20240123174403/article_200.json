    "text": "[News](../)\nItaly: Church nativity scene featuring two mothers of Jesus sparks accusation of blasphemy\nPro-life and family campaigners in Italy have hit out at a “dangerous and blasphemous” church nativity scene featuring two mothers of the baby Jesus instead of Mary and Joseph figurines.\nAn online petition calling on the bishop in the province of Avellino to intervene has attracted more than 21,000 signatures.\nIt claimed the scene contradicted the Catholic Church’s teachings about the family and legitimised same-sex parenting and surrogacy.\nBut the priest at the Church of Saints Peter and Paul, in the Avellino hamlet of Capocastello di Mercogliano, east of Naples, has defended its depiction of Jesus’s birth.\n“I wanted to show with this scene that families are no longer just the traditional ones,” Father Vitaliano Della Sala said.\n“In our parishes, we see more and more children from the new types of families that exist and are part of our society, children of separated and divorced people, gay couples, single people, young mothers.”\nFather Della Sala, who is known in\n[Italy](//news.sky.com/topic/italy-7435) for expressing sympathy for LGBT and left-wing causes, has insisted his attitude is similar to that of Pope Francis, who in a landmark ruling this week, [allowed priests to bless same-sex couples](//news.sky.com/story/pope-francis-formally-approves-allowing-priests-to-bless-same-sex-couples-13033596).\nHowever, Senator Maurizio Gasparri, from the co-ruling Forza Italia party, said the LGBT creche “offends all those who always had respect and devotion for the Holy Family”.\nAnd the Pro-Vita & Famiglia (Pro-Life and Family) group called it “dangerous, as well as shameful and blasphemous”.\nRead more:\n[What is the average age children stop believing in Santa?](//news.sky.com/story/what-is-the-average-age-children-stop-believing-in-santa-and-is-it-time-to-tell-yours-the-truth-13036737) [Bethlehem praying for a ceasefire this Christmas as war rages on](//news.sky.com/story/bethlehem-praying-for-a-ceasefire-this-christmas-as-war-rages-on-13035805) [The Christmas veggies that may help fight cancer](//news.sky.com/story/christmas-dinner-seasonal-veg-reduces-risk-of-cancer-study-suggests-13033842)\nNativity scenes are popular in the mostly Catholic country.\nBut they have been increasingly caught up in culture wars as society becomes more secular and multi-cultural.\n[World News](/)|| [Latest News](/news)|| [U.S. News](../us-news) [Source link](//news.sky.com/story/italy-church-nativity-scene-featuring-two-mothers-of-jesus-sparks-accusation-of-blasphemy-13036843)",

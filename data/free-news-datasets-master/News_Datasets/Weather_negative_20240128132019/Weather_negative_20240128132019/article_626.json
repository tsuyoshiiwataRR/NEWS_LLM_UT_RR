    "text": "After Arsenal had conceded a contentious goal from a move that may have involved the ball rolling out of play at Newcastle, Mikel Arteta’s response was to lambast the officials .\nThe same thing happened in the defeat to West Ham in Arsenal’s final home game of 2023, but this time there was no furious tirade. Instead, Arteta calmly acknowledged that their opponents had been “better in both boxes”. Publicly at least, Arteta focused on his team’s shortcomings rather than the limitations of VAR and the technology available.\nIt was an unforeseen loss and an incredibly frustrating evening all around. By every conceivable metric, Arsenal were dominant: they had 75 per cent of the ball, registered 30 shots to West Ham’s six and had 77 touches in the opposition penalty area without scoring, a Premier League first.\nBut they lost on the only metric that matters: goals scored. A 2-0 deficit would have become a 3-0 loss had David Raya not kept out Said Benrahma’s penalty with virtually the final action of the game. Arsenal have now failed to score in all three of their Premier League defeats this season.\nArsenal’s misfiring attack has been an issue that has bubbled away throughout the campaign, but there has been no greater example of their profligacy than on Thursday night. “If we don’t score with 30 shots, then we have to do 50 or 60 to try to score,” Arteta said, adopting a glass half-full approach.\nHere are four ways Arteta can attempt to fix it.\nBuy a new striker Buying a new No 9 next month is the obvious and most popular solution as far as the fans are concerned, but barring something unforeseen, it seems unlikely to materialise.\nRelated Article Football The Score Our verdict on all 20 Premier League teams after Gameweek 19 Read More Arteta’s issue is that he has two very good strikers but not an outstanding one and January is a tricky time to buy a centre forward that would truly elevate Arsenal’s attack.\nIvan Toney and Victor Osimhen are the names that have most regularly been linked with Arsenal and both would be an upgrade on Gabriel Jesus, at least in a goalscoring sense. The loudest groan of the night on Tuesday came when Jesus nodded a relatively straightforward chance over the bar. He is a historical xG underperformer and is showing no signs of sharpening his finishing touch.\nOsimhen would be the dream signing, but with Napoli fighting for a top four place in Serie A only a mind-boggling offer would tempt them into a sale. Brentford are also determined to keep Toney who hasn’t played since April in any case due to his betting ban.\nBoth players are likely to be available in the summer, but not having one before then could well be the difference between winning or not winning the league.\nGive Martinelli a breather Gabriel Martinelli’s drop-off is starting to become a major problem. The Brazilian was superb last season, scoring 15 Premier League goals and setting up five more. However, he has just two apiece after his first 17 matches of 2023-24.\nAt his best, Martinelli is one of the best counter-attacking wingers in Europe, a devastating blend of pace, directness and end product. When off form he is ineffective, easy to defend against in a low block and prone to charging head down into congestion. Arsenal fans have seen more of the latter of late.\nMartinelli has struggled for form this season (Photo: Getty) The reasons for his dip are varied. It could be a confidence issue: Martinelli has looked more hesitant in and around the box and is averaging 1.7 shots per game compared to 2.2 last season.\nPerhaps it’s tactical and he misses the safety net that Granit Xhaka provided as the left-sided central midfielder. Or maybe he’s suffering from burnout. Since the start of 2023-24, Martinelli has started 50 of Arsenal’s 57 league games. That’s a lot to ask of a 22-year-old.\nBukayo Saka, who is a few months younger than Martinelli, also looks jaded and has played even more football. He too could probably benefit from a breather but is simply too important to take out.\nRejig the frontline Following on from the above point, it is perhaps an opportune time for Arteta to rejig his frontline. Neither Martinelli nor Jesus have been consistent enough to warrant automatic selection and as Gary Neville pointed out after the draw at Anfield, as a front three with Saka, they just aren’t clicking as a unit right now.\n“I’m just thinking about the great front threes and then about Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, and Gabriel Martinelli,” he said on the Gary Neville Podcast.\nRelated Article Football Big Read The football fans who blocked VAR and Saudi money - and have the most exciting league in Europe Read More “Not even just in goals, they don’t combine a lot together within the game to play, and I just feel as though that’s going to cost Arsenal at some point. I don’t see them [sic] three linking together a lot.”\nLeandro Trossard has contributed to as many league goals as Martinelli has despite playing half as many minutes and warrants a sustained run in the side either on the left or through the middle.\nPerhaps a Trossard, Havertz, Saka frontline could be the way to go against Fulham on New Year’s Eve.\nBring Smith Rowe back into the fold The forgotten man of Arteta’s Arsenal revolution, at least outside of north London. Emile Smith Rowe is approaching a crossroads point in his career. Unless he forces his way back into Arteta’s plans soon, he will have to move on.\nInjuries have played a part in his decline – according to Transfermarkt , Smith Rowe has missed 23 games since the start of 2022-23 due to injury – but he has also struggled for pitch time when fit. The 23-year-old has only started one Premier League game in the past 18 months.\nHe has been unfortunate that Xhaka made the left-sided central midfield role that he favours his own last season and that Havertz was bought for big money to play in that position in the summer.\nArteta’s decision to start Trossard over Smith Rowe despite Havertz’s suspension in midweek seemed like a significant call. If Smith Rowe does have a future at Arsenal Arteta should reintegrate him at a time when other attackers are struggling.",

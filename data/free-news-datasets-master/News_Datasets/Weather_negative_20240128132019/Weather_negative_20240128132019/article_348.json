    "text": "Leftover strong winds from Storm Gerrit are still playing havoc with traffic in Bristol, with continued restrictions at the M48 Severn Bridge. [Traffic](https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/traffic-travel) between Bristol and Wales has been restricted for a few days following the onset of the storm, which has caused scaffolding and trees to fall, as well as cutting power across the UK. The Severn Bridge is currently open towards Bristol, according to traffic monitor Inrix, though the Wales-bound side has been closed. Inrix reports: \"M48 Westbound closed due to strong winds at J1 A403 ( Aust ). This is in preparation for the increased winds speeds and an expected closure to high sided vehicles.\" One lane is still closed on the [M4 Prince of Wales bridge](https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/m4-motorway) after a serious crash on Wednesday (December 27). Both of these closures are likely to contribute to delays between Bristol and Wales throughout the day, particularly with a host of holidaymakers expected to set off ahead of the New Year's weekend. Inrix adds: \"One lane closed due to emergency barrier repairs on M4 Prince of Wales Bridge in both directions between J22 M49 and J23 M48.\" The worst of the Storm Gerrit was experienced across the northwest of England on Thursday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.” This is a live blog. Scroll below for more. UK snow Steven Ramsdale is a Met Office Chief Forecaster. He said: “This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.” One lane closed on M4 bridge after crash \"One lane closed due to emergency barrier repairs on M4 Prince of Wales Bridge in both directions between J22 M49 and J23 M48.\" The lane has been closed since Wednesday, December 27 after a seven-car crash on the bridge sparked severe delays.

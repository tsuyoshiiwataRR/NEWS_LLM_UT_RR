    "text": "As strong storms lingered over the Pacific Ocean on Thursday, massive waves wreaked havoc on coastal California cities, sending at least eight people to the hospital.\nSome residents were too close to the seawalls when the enormous structures smashed over them, but others defied evacuation orders and raced to the beaches to witness the breathtaking spectacle of the waves breaking.\nAt roughly eleven in the morning, a rogue wave at Ventura’s Pierpont Beach washed about twenty beachgoers.\nAs two vehicles tried to break out of the wave, the city of Ventura recorded the moment the water broke over the concrete barrier and threw the unarmed onlookers to the ground.\nResidents of Ventura experienced “life-threatening rip currents” in addition to waves that might reach up to 20 feet.\nRoads leading to the beach were closed by officials to prevent additional spectators from going into the hazardous sections.\nAnother video, which KSBW was able to collect, showed two youngsters in Santa Cruz taking in the views of the thunderous ocean as a massive wave slammed over the barrier, wiping the two helpless kids away.\nBecause of the “high tides and flooding,” the Santa Cruz Sheriff’s Office issued evacuation alerts early on Thursday.\nThe Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office’s Ashley Keehn told KTVU FOX 2 that “we put evacuation warnings into place around 8 a.m. this morning for this area, and, as you can see, these waves are incredibly powerful.”\nIn Santa Cruz, waves as high as 28 to 33 feet were reported by the National Weather Service Bay Area.\nOn December 28, 2023, a front end loader in Pacifica, California, clears debris on a flooded Clarendon road caused by heavy waves.\nIt was claimed that logs and driftwood had washed up on the nearby coast.\nUp here, they’re cleaning logs. Lots of driftwood and garbage. Thus, we have been advising people to stay away from the immediate coastline region,” Keehn said.\nAccording to the Ventura Fire Department, they were constructing man-made beach berms during the night to safeguard neighboring residential areas.\nNot only did onlookers profit from the enormous waves, but surfers were also having a great time riding the enormous swells.\n“Someone left our group. Actually, they are vying for a picture contest. Indeed, Jackson Fisk told KTVU, “They’re extremely excited about the amazing waves and the massive surge that’s coming right now.\nSouthern California was under a dangerous surf warning from the National Weather Service due to the possibility of life-threatening rip currents and major beach damage.\nCoastal flooding warnings are in place until the afternoon, and high wave warnings and advisories are in force for the entire West Coast, extending from Washington to the US-Mexico border, until three in the morning local time on Friday.",

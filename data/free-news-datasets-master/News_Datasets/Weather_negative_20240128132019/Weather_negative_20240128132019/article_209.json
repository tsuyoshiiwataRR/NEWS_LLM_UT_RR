Even now, it is intended to ensure that a third of the Elbe water flows into a 21-kilometre-long canal. © Simon Kremer/dpa\nEven today, the flood situation in parts of Germany is likely to remain tense. A key question is how much rain falls.\nDresden/Hanover - The situation in the flood areas remains threatening. The German Weather Service (DWD) predicted some heavy rainfall. In the reservoirs of the Bergisches Land and the Siegerland in North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the Harz Mountains, continuous rain is to be expected from Friday morning until Saturday night. Up to 40 liters per square meter could fall within 24 hours. The situation in Lower Saxony is tense. In eastern Germany, too, many fire brigades are still in continuous operation.\nIn Lower Saxony, areas along the rivers Aller, Leine and Weser in the southern and central parts of the state are affected. The situation there worsened further on Thursday. The dikes were no longer able to withstand the masses of water everywhere. Thousands of relief workers are deployed across the country. Evacuations were prepared in some places. In the municipality of Langlingen in the district of Celle, about 120 people left their houses and apartments during the night as a precaution. In the morning, the state government wants to give an update on the flood situation at a press conference.\nBecause: \"Experts have been warning for a long time\" Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) said on Thursday that there had never been a flood of this magnitude before. \"Experts have long warned that the increasing frequency of weather extremes is linked to climate change,\" he said. According to the Ministry of the Interior, a so-called extraordinary event was detected in six districts as well as the city of Oldenburg. With this measure, for example, counties can more easily access auxiliary staff.\nThe city of Verden an der Aller is also affected by the floods. © Jörn Hüneke/XOYO Film/dpa\nThere is also no all-clear yet around Bremen. According to the authorities on Thursday evening, numerous houses along the Wümme in the Katrepel area are surrounded by water and without electricity. Most of the residents have left this area. In the district of Timmersloh, the water is standing on the dikes. Roads and fields are flooded. According to the information provided by the Interior Ministry, measures to secure the dike have already had to be carried out several times.\nNo all-clear yet on the Elbe On the Elbe in Dresden, rising water levels are expected. Early Thursday afternoon, 5.92 meters were measured. This was still just below the six-metre mark from which the second-highest alert level 3 would apply. The state flood control center expected this limit to be exceeded in the morning - but only very slightly with a maximum of 6.01 meters. A normal water level of 2.00 meters in the Elbe in the state capital is normal.\nThe hydrologists expected a decrease in the Elbe flood water from today, as a spokesman for the State Office for the Environment, Agriculture and Geology said. Only locally light rain is expected, and neither precipitation nor snowmelt in the Czech catchment area of the Elbe is expected to date.\nDownstream in Magdeburg and Schönebeck in Saxony-Anhalt, the State Agency for Flood Protection and Water Management opened the Pretzien weir on Thursday. This means that about a third of the Elbe's water is channelled past the two cities through a flood channel and across meadows and fields before flowing back into the Elbe.\nMy news Because he was bored: Family man wins over 6 million euros – with a bet of 1.60 €read more\nDream of eternal youth: Multimillionaire undergoes controversial treatment – \"I am now genetically enhanced\"read\nPolar vortex event imminent: Climate phenomenon expected to cause the onset of winter soonread\nDrama shakes Italy: ambulance collides with bus full of children - 4 dead\n30 centimetres of fresh snow and snow line sinking – winter comeback is imminent\nRemedies for colds: get rid of colds and sore throats quicklyread\nThe flood from the German-Polish border river Oder has already partially flooded meadows in front of the dike. © Patrick Pleul/dpa\nIn the north of Thuringia, the focus is on the Kelbra dam, from which water has been drained. In the village of Mönchpfiffel-Nikolausrieth, there was therefore a threat that about 30 houses would be flooded, as a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior announced on Thursday. Emergency services had set up 6000,<> sandbags on the riverbank to prevent this. According to the information, the water was about ten centimeters below the edge of the bank.

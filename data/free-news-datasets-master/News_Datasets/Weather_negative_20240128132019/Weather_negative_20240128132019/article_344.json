    "text": "By\n<a href=\"https://www.gbnews.com/authors/sarra-gray\">Sarra Gray\n</a>\nPublished: 29/12/2023- 07:01\nDon't Miss\nMost Read\nTrending on GB News\nAs Britons continue to celebrate Christmas and look forward to New Year's Eve parties, a health warning has been shared.\nSome illness are more likely to appear at this time of year but an expert shared how to reduce the risk.\nSpeaking exclusively to GB News, pharmacist and advisor to\nEffercitrate Tablets Sultan Dajani warned of the risk of cystitis.\nHe said: \"With one in three women suffering from recurring cystitis, the festive period can be a common time to get it.\nThe illness is more common during the party season\nGETTY\n\"Late nights due to parties may lead to not enough sleep, and lots of finger food and alcohol represent poor nutrition so that we can end up feeling run down very quickly.\n\"Our immune system suffers and many are rife for infections including urinary tract infections and cystitis. Plus, too much alcohol and not enough water is dehydrating.\n\"This means that the urinary tract is not able to expel any bacteria present as water is needed to get rid of bacteria.”\nThe main signs of cystitis include pain when urinating, cloudy urine, blood in urine or feeling feverish and run down.\nHow can you reduce the risk?\nSultan explained the best ways to avoid getting ill.\nHe continued: \"Drink plenty [of water] and don’t rely on alcohol for fluid as it dehydrates.\n\"Aim for two litres of water more every day, including a big glass of water last thing before you go to bed and first thing when you get up.\n\"If you get up in the night to pee have another glass of water then. When you go to the loo wipe yourself front to back.\n\"The source of bacteria in a urinary tract infection is usually the back passage and the distance between this and the urinary opening in women is very short putting women at particular risk of cystitis.\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS\nPartying and drinking more alcohol in December can increase the risk of the illness\nPA\n\"Wet cotton underwear too as this allows the genital area to breathe.”\nHow to get rid of it?\nSultan said: \"If you get cystitis, tackle it fast and try an effervescent tablet.\n\"When fully dissolved in water, the solution contains Potassium citrate and Citric acid.\n\"Potassium citrate makes the urine more alkaline, which helps soothe the bladder and urethra lining, helping to relieve the discomfort caused by the infection swiftly.\"",

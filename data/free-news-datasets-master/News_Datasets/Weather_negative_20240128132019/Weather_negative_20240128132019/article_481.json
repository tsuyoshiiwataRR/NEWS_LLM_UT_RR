Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.\nLooking into 2024\nNick Silkstone, a Met Office Deputy Chief Forecaster, said:\nThrough to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely\nFlood Warning for Severn Ham, Tewkesbury\nThis from the Environment Agency\nRiver levels are rising at the Mythe Bridge river gauge as a result of heavy rainfall.

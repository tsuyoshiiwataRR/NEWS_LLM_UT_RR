    "text": "Temperatures to plummet over New Year’s weekend\nNew Year’s weekend revellers will need to wrap up as strong winds, heavy rain and even ice and frost are set to make travel conditions potentially challenging.\nMet Éireann said the first week of 2024 also looks likely to prove quite unsettled as a low-pressure weather front will bring blustery conditions with rainfall expected to be well above early January norms.\nDespite the unsettled weather expected for the weekend, there will be patches of bright sunshine at times, but those attending outdoor New Year’s Eve celebrations are urged to dress warmly.\nTemperatures will drop by six degrees overnight, with frost, ice and possibly snow on higher ground over the weekend.\nThe good news is that calmer weather is expected from January 8 thanks to a high-pressure front arriving in the Atlantic, although there will still be some showers around.\nA status orange alert was lifted from four southern and western counties, providing some relief for local authorities that gust-related damage was not as severe as initially feared.\nBoth Cork County Council and Kerry County Council said there was no serious property or infrastructure damage in the wake of Storm Gerrit.\nMet Éireann said there was the potential for very challenging driving conditions over the next 24 hours.\n“Friday will be rather windy for a time, with some sunshine and scattered showers,” a spokesperson said.\n“The showers won’t be as widespread as Wednesday, Thursday. However, rain will continue in parts of the north and the north-west, some of it heavy, with a chance of localised flooding.\n“Showers will persist through Friday night and rain will spread from the north-east overnight with the potential for some areas of higher ground to get sleet or even snow.\n“Temperatures will sink to as low as minus 2C or even minus 3C in some areas. Saturday will be windy or very windy with rain clearing to sunny spells and scattered showers.”\nMet Éireann said winds would ease over tomorrow night, although showers would persist in many areas.\nSome areas – particularly those on higher ground – could see frost and ice.\n“Sunday will probably be a breezy and chilly day with scattered showers and moderate to fresh north-west winds and highest temperatures of 5C to 8C,” the spokesperson added.",

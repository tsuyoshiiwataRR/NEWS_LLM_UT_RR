    "text": "Brits could face two of the chilliest months with snow as we head towards the New Year. According to the Met Office, the chance of\nwintry showers remains 'increasingly likely'.\nSnow is more likely in January and February - with the Beast from the East hitting hardest in February 2018. There are now signs a colder change is coming.\nNick Silkstone, Met Office deputy chief forecaster, said: \"Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder than average conditions becoming increasingly likely.\" Settled conditions are expected to bring on an onset of colder air from the east.\nREAD MORE:\nMan caught with drug-dealing phone between his legs locked up\nGet breaking news on\nBirminghamLive WhatsApp. Join our dedicated community to get the latest updates.\nThis in turn could spark temperatures to fall to sub-zero levels, bringing icy conditions and snow,\nExpress reports. Scotland and northern England are typically the regions where snow is likely to settle.\nBut according to one meteorologist, the south could still see some snow. Jim Dale, a senior\nmeteorologist for British Weather Services, said: \"Expectation is indeed for colder weather, but it is likely well before mid-month. However, there are plenty of conflicting pointers, so confidence cannot be too high at this point.\n\"Nevertheless, I do expect\nsn ow and ice events to gradually cascade southwards at the end of the first week of January.\" He added: \"There will be no beast as such, more a northern Troll from Trondheim.\n\"I expect Scotland to be fairly loaded, some chaos for parts of the north and, at the moment, a dusting of less for the south. The caveat is, we haven't yet seen the whites of the Trollâ€™s eyes yet.\"\nWeather maps show a vertical band of rain, stretching from Scotland to Kent, falling as snow for much of the north of the UK on Sunday, January 7. Rural, higher ground will get a coating.\nTemperatures will remain marginally normal for the time of year. But conditions are predicted to worsen from January 11, with the south of the country heading towards freezing temperatures.\nScotland will alternate between -1C, 0C and 1C, depending on the area. Maps also show an icy deluge pushing southwards over the country, with some isolated areas getting bouts of freezing rain among snow showers.\nIn its long range forecast for January 2 to 11, the\nMet Office said: \"During this time there is a good chance that many central areas may remain relatively fine for a number of days. Thereafter, more settled and calmer conditions are expected to gradually develop quite widely, increasing the risk of frost and fog.\n\"This would also lead to day on day net cooling eventually bringing below average temperatures for many, with an increased threat of winter hazards, including ice/snow if any precipitation runs into the cold air in place over land.\" Looking at January 12 to 26, it added: \"Compared to normal, there is an increased chance of colder than average conditions during this period, and a reduced chance of prolonged periods of very unsettled/milder conditions with frequent rain and wind pushing in from the Atlantic.\n\"Currently the chance of widespread severe cold is still deemed low, but still the risk of impacts from cold, ice and snow is greater than normal.\"",

    "text": "General mobilization! On 6 December, the economic forces of the Occitanie region (three consular chambers with the support of the regional council) declared a general mobilisation to win the battle for water, which has become scarce and precious in some departments. During a four-hour colloquium, one hundred actors in the case, gathered on the stage of the Narbonne theatre, captivated more than 700 people, sweeping all imaginable avenues to save water, transport it, store it.\nAt the end of the collective awareness exercise, punctuated by good intentions, the visionary winemaker Gérard Bertrand urged to act quickly with a steering committee supported in this desire to accelerate by his rugby friend Didier Codorniou, vice-president of the Region. Because, from now on, time is running out for some territories, such as the Pyrénées-Orientales, where it still did not rain at the end of December. No sooner had the participants of the symposium returned home than the bad weather news arrived. The publication by BRGM of the latest assessment of phreatic reserves has immediately sent the Catalan department back into the nightmare of 2023. And this is probably only the beginning, as hydrogeologist Henri Got, former president of the University of Perpignan, explains.\nRead alsoIs it really irresponsible to have your own swimming pool?\nWhere do we stand on the waterfront in the Pyrénées-Orientales?\nThe readings for the Pyrénées-Orientales are not worrying. They are very worrying since on 1 December, the level of recharge of the aquifers was below the lowest level ever. This can be made up for in the water table if it rains a lot. But the so-called Pliocene deep aquifers will not be able to be regenerated. This is worrisome for the future.\nWill we relive in 2024 the stress of the lack of water felt in 2023?\nWe are likely to live worse than 2023. If it doesn't rain a lot between now and March, it will be worse than 2023. And the competition for water use will be much more complicated. Simply because in 2023, we were starting with a normal reserve level, especially for surface water and dam filling. In Villeneuve de la Raho, the reserve is currently at a third of its capacity. It's the same for Vinça (our photo). And, right now, there is no snow. Look at the Canigou. It is not white. Normally, groundwater recharge occurs in the fall. However, the charging has not begun. In the best-case scenario, half of the groundwater recharge period has been missed. There is a deficit in both groundwater and surface water. Thus, in some areas, the Agly is still dry, as it was last May.\nHenri Got, hydrogeologist.\nTo save the Pyrénées-Orientales, will we be able to count on the transfer of water from the Rhône via the BRL canal and AquaDomitia?\nThe diameter of the Aqua Domitia pipe to transport water from the Rhône has been calculated to serve the east of the Aude department. I am not sure that we can serve the Pyrénées-Orientales with the transport capacity of the current pipe. And it will take a lot of work to extend this service. In the best-case scenario, this will take a long time. And money.\nIs reusing water a good idea?\nYes, but with its limitations. You can only reuse water that you have already consumed. And let me remind you that water from wastewater treatment plants is useful for maintaining the flow of rivers. Thus, Perpignan discharges 17,000 m3 of water per day into the bed of the Têt River. Without this water, the Tet River would have a ridiculously low flow. The only real solutions to reuse water are coastal stations, which discharge directly into the sea. For water, there is no single solution but several solutions that must be added. It is also possible to create hill reservoirs, but only if it rains. I do not believe in a one-size-fits-all solution for the entire regional territory. Because the situation is very different from one department to another. And the Pyrénées-Orientales are the most exposed. « ;;;",

    "text": "California Coast Put on Alert for 'Tremendous' Waves That Could Reach Up to 40 Feet The first huge swell of the winter has arrived in California, and with it comes dangerous surf set to rival some of the biggest waves this year.‚Äî San Francisco Chronicle (@sfchronicle) Read more: [https://t.co/BGPPPsd8Bz] üé•: [@stephenlamphoto] üé• [pic.twitter.com/raSntIcDJ0] [December 28, 2023] [Nicole Sarment](https://www.sfchronicle.com/weather/article/california-surf-wave-warning-18575570.php), a weather service meteorologist. ‚ÄúPeople should really not even go.‚Äù A coastal Flood Warning is in effect for southern California until 3 pm! Beware of potential flooding, high tides, and strong winds along the coast due to large waves. Stay safe!‚Äî WeatherNation (@WeatherNation) [#CoastalFloodWarning] [#CAwx] [pic.twitter.com/gt1rbANJ5c] [December 28, 2023] At least three factors help to create these dramatic wave heights: wind speed, fetch, and time. Fetch being the area over the ocean where winds blow and generate waves, says the weather service. The longer the weather system sits there, the higher the waves will be. These type of weather systems are also more common during the winter months. High tides, big waves and rip currents are on tap for Southern California‚Äî Jon Baird (@KNXBaird) [#beaches]for the next couple of days. This is the view from the pier in [#HermosaBeach]. [@knxnews] [pic.twitter.com/cLgKuXdUZv] [December 28, 2023] ‚ÄúAs those (swells) come to the coast and they break, that‚Äôs when you get those large waves at the coastlines and at the beaches,‚Äù said [Alexis Clouser](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/12/28/big-waves-california-storms-surf/), a weather service meteorologist. ‚ÄúThese are not the highest wave heights we‚Äôve seen, but they‚Äôre certainly on the larger side.\"",

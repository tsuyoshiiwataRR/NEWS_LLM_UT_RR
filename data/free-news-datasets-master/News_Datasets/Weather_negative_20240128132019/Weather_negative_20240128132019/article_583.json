    "text": "Severe weather is expected ahead of New Year's Eve as a warning is issued for parts of Norfolk. The Met Office has forecast strong and gusty winds across the county with a yellow weather warning in place from 11am tomorrow until 3am on Sunday. This will impact south and east Norfolk including Acle, Great Yarmouth and Loddon. The warning follows a wave of destruction across the country [brought by Storm Gerritt](https://www.bing.com/search?q=storm+gerrit+edp24&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&ghc=1&lq=0&pq=storm+gerrit+edp24&sc=0-18&sk=&cvid=207F1D8E699B4A6F87978662640ADF75&ghsh=0&ghacc=0&ghpl=), which [tore down trees](https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/24013743.road-blocked-near-thetford-garden-centre-due-fallen-tree/) and left thousands of homes in Norfolk without electricity this week. READ MORE: [Rallying call to protect clifftop properties 'at serious risk'](https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/24014365.plea-protect-properties-at-serious-risk-pakefield/) The weather over the weekend is expected to cause some transport delays for those travelling by either road or rail. The Met Office also said coastal areas and seafronts are likely to be affected by large waves and spray. This comes as recent high tides and winds saw roads collapsing into the sea and several home evacuations across Norfolk. Homes and businesses in the areas covered by the warning may also experience power cuts.",

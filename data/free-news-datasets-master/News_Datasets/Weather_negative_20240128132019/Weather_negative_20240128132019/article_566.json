    "text": "The Met Office has issued a 16-hour yellow weather warning for wind across Surrey and the south of England for the New Year weekend with gusts of 50mph widely forecast. The alert comes into force from 11am (December 30) and means “strong and gusty” winds are expected until 3am on Sunday (December 31). The alert covers the majority of the county up to [Chertsey](https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/chertsey) as a strong spell of wind moves east across England and Wales. The forecaster has warned of travel disruption and possible short-term losses of power or services. It said some delays are likely on road, rail, air, and ferry transport and that journeys on buses and trains will “probably” take longer. “Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely,” The Met Office continued.

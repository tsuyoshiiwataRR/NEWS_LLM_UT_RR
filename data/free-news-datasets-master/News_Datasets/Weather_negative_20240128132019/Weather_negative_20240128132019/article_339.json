    "text": "Throughout Haryana, dense fog blanketed the region on Wednesday. Due to slow winds and humidity, the visibility remained low until afternoon without any significant improvement. Hisar, Karnal, Bhiwani, and Sirsa witnessed visibility ranging from 20 to 50 meters. Some areas in Hisar experienced a cold wave. The Meteorological Department issued a dense fog warning across all cities in Haryana today. The Weather Department declared a red alert in 22 districts of the state. A red alert is declared when weather conditions are expected to be extremely adverse. Additionally, an orange alert has been issued for December 29th and 30th. In several cities, the absence of sunlight led to a cold day. The temperature difference between day and night in many cities ranged from just four to six degrees. Cold day conditions were reported in some districts of the state, classified when the daytime temperature is below 15 degrees Celsius and six degrees below the normal temperature. Hisar, Jhajjar, and Rohtak recorded daytime temperatures notably six degrees below normal. This weather pattern caused significant disruptions in daily activities, prompting authorities to issue warnings and alerts across various regions in Haryana.",

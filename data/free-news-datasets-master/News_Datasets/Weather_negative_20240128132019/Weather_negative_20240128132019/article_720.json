    "text": "Another possible storm was threatening to smash Britain with gales, rain and up to eight inches of snow.\nFollowing on from a rough festive period in which the country first saw Storm Pia and then Storm Gerrit bring strong winds and torrential rain the UK, there's another round of bad weather on the way and fears that Storm Henk could be just on the horizon.\nA low pressure system is set to batter Ireland and the UK over the weekend, giving an unsettled end to the year. Pushing its way in from the west, it will hit Ireland hardest, and the country will see the strongest winds too. However the rest of the UK won’t escape, as it also could bring as much as eight inches of snow in places.\nThe Met Office warned yesterday there was a chance of the low pressure system forming into Storm Henk, but have now said neither themselves or Met Éireann have any intentions of naming it. Regardless of whether it's named or not, it promises to bring a wet and miserable end to the year.\nAfter a weak ridge of high pressure is expected to bring a relatively quieter night, tomorrow will see weather across Ireland and the UK take a turn. Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said: \"The weather looks like it will be unsettled with further strong winds and heavy rain as we go through the last weekend of 2023.\n\"A deep area of low pressure is set to push its way in from the west, this low could be named Storm Henk by the Irish Met Service, Met Éireann, because it is likely to be across the Republic of Ireland where we see the strongest winds. Nonetheless, Saturday is going to turn wet and windy across the UK, this band of intense rain is going to push its way east and north-eastwards as we go through the day bringing strong winds with it, the risk of gales or even severe gales in exposed spots.\n\"As well as the rain we are also likely to see some significant snow across northern areas particularly over the higher grounds in Scotland . For the highest ground we could see 10-20cm of snow building up, and even for some lower levels there’s potential for some snow accumulation. Even as low as 100m up we could see some slushy snow. So, likely to see travel disruption again because of the wind, the rain and some snow, like we have seen over some recent days.\"\nHowever down in southern parts of England, temperatures are expected to be on the \"mild side\" with highs of around 12C or 13C. But with the heavy rains and strong winds, don’t expect a nice day out still. Further north, the temperatures remain low, stuck around mid-single figures, with the wind giving the day a chilly feel.\nThe Met meteorologist continued: \"As we look toward Sunday, we are going to see the more persistent heavy rain clearing away toward the east, but still under the influence of this deep area of low pressure, as a result it will still be blustery and windy and quite a showery day.\"\nFor New Year’s Eve itself, parts of the East of England may see a clear bright start, but it will be largely cloudy for many with plenty of showers moving in on west and north-westerly winds.\nDue to this, parts of the north-west, Wales and Northern Ireland will see the heaviest and most frequent showers. Parts of Scotland could see brighter spells, but any showers could turn wintry over higher ground.",

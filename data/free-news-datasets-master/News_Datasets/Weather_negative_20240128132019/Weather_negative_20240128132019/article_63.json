    "text": "Power outages in parts of south-east Queensland were expected to last nearly a week after deadly wild weather cut supplies and weather conditions remained hot and stormy.\nTens of thousands of people on the Gold Coast and other regions south of Brisbane were expected to be without electricity on the New Year weekend after damage caused by storms that lashed a vast swath of Australia’s east coast starting around Christmas.\nStorms cut power in south-east Queensland.\nMaking things worse, the region was due to be hit by a heatwave that forecasters said would extend across northern Australia and could bring temperatures in the 40s.\nWinton in Queensland’s west is expecting 43 degrees on Friday, while temperatures of up to 37 degrees were forecast for Gympie in the storm-ravaged south-east and 36 degrees in Brisbane, the Bureau of Meteorology said.\nIn the Northern Territory, it was predicted to reach 40 degrees in Katherine and 43 degrees in Tennant Creek, while at Marble Bar in Western Australia’s Pilbara region 49 degrees was expected.\nAdvertisement Seven people died in Queensland as wild weather lashed the south-east, including at least people caught in stormwater drains. In Victoria, two people were killed by falling branches and a third drowned in flash flooding after wild weather lashed the state around Christmas.\nFederal Disaster and Emergency Management Minister Murray Watt said south-east Queensland residents should look out for neighbours who were elderly or living with disability.\n“If you have fans or air conditioning available and have got the power on, today is the day to use it,” Senator Watt said on Thursday.\n“If you don’t have that, today is the day to think about using those public libraries, public pools, other spaces to stay safe.”\nMore than 120,000 homes and businesses lost power during extreme rain, lightning and wind.\nQueensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni said 63 per cent of customers without power since Monday and Tuesday’s “unprecedented” storms now had their services restored, and officials aimed to increase that rate to 80 per cent by Saturday.\nAdvertisement But more than 43,000 people were still without power on Thursday afternoon.\nHealth Minister Shannon Fentiman said this was “incredibly concerning”, with high temperatures expected over the coming days.\n“Use a cold towel or if there is power on at the local library or at a shopping centre, go there and just keep your temperature down if you’re starting to experience some signs and symptoms of heat stress,” she said.\nThe Gold Coast council announced its pools would be open and made free on Friday during the extreme heat.\nAAP\nSave Log in or Subscribe to save article\nShare Introducing your Newsfeed\nFollow the topics, people and companies that matter to you.\nFind out more\nRead More Extreme weather\nGold Coast\nClimate crisis\nSponsored Advertisement Latest In Energy Fetching latest articles\nMost Viewed In Companies",

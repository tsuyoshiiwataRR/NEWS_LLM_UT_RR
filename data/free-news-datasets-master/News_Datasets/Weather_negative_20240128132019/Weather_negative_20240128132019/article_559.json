    "text": "However you intend to celebrate the start of 2024, the Met Office is predicting a miserable and rainy wash out weekend in Devon. There is little respite from Storm Gerrit, as meteorologists say more unsettled [weather](https://www.devonlive.com/all-about/weather) is on its way, with a band of heavy rain is expected to move in from the south west. The Exeter-based forecaster has said rainfall in the UK has been above average during 2023, brought about by a wetter-than-usual autumn and it seems as though the start of 2024 will be more of the same. Scattered, heavy showers are set to sweep across Devon on December 31, with a heavy deluge arriving in Devon from 9am on January 1. While strong winds are still expected over the new year weekend, the Met Office says these won't be nearly as strong as those brought by Storm Gerrit, which is still playing havoc with the British weather. In the West Country, trees were brought down and some road bridges were closed, while a reported 'tornado' damaged around 100 homes in Greater Manchester amid 160mph winds. The heaviest rain will start to move in from Cornwall by around 12pm on January 1 and, according to Met Office weather maps, is unlikely to let up until the following day. While still breezy, wind speeds will be lower than seen recently, and are likely to drop further on January 1. Steven Ramsdale is a Met Office Chief Forecaster. He said: “This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.” Temperatures across Devon are unlikely to reach more than 8-9C, and it will feel colder than is has during this [Christmas](https://www.devonlive.com/all-about/christmas) Week. The Met Office says there is low confidence in the forecast heading into 2024. Nick Silkstone, Met Office Deputy Chief Forecaster, said: “Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.” Met Office South West forecast Today Another day of blustery showers, heavy at times, with some sunny spells. Staying rather mild and remaining breezy, especially in any heavy downpours though less windy than recent days. Maximum temperature 11 °C. Tonight Any day time showers gradually easing through the evening allowing for clearer skies for a time and lighter winds. Turning cloudier by dawn with some patchy rain from the west. Minimum temperature 4 °C. Saturday Turning unsettled with cloud and outbreaks of rain pushing in from the west. Rain turning heavy at times, especially later over the hills with strong gusty winds and coastal gales. Maximum temperature 12 °C. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday Often cloudy on Sunday with some blustery showers in the west. Largely fine on New Year's Day with a few showers. Cloudier on Tuesday with rain and stronger winds.",

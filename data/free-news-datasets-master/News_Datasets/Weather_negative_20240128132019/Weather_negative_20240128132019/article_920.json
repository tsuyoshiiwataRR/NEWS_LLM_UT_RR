    "text": "Harford and Cecil counties saw flooding Wednesday after heavy rainfall swept the Baltimore metropolitan area, the National Weather Service reports. Erik Taylor, an NWS meteorologist, said the areas east of the I-95 corridor saw between one and a half to two inches of rainfall. At the same time, some counties within the state, including Harford and Cecil, experienced two and a half to three inches over 72 hours. In Joppa, a car was stuck in flood waters on Winters Run Road in Wednesday evening, the Harford County Fire Department said in a post to X, formerly Twitter. Taylor said there were no concerns for additional flooding as “it looks like most of those smaller streams and creeks that were up are slowly coming back down.” On Thursday, there’s a high of 57 degrees expected in the afternoon and a low of 43 degrees at night. Friday will see a 20% chance of showers and a high of 51 degrees. Taylor said the New Year’s weekend will look relatively dry, with a rain shower popping up here or there. Temperatures will remain in the 40s and 50s.",

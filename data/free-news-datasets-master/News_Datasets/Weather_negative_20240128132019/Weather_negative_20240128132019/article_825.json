    "text": "A flood sign in the village of Collingham\nThere are several flood alerts in place across Nottinghamshire following the recent heavy rain from Storm Gerrit. Flooding is possible at the River Idle, River Maun, River Meden, River Trent and River Trent Tributaries.\nAlso at risk is the River Leen, Day Brook, Tottle Brook, the River Erewash and the River Erewash Tributaries. Storm Gerrit is bringing strong winds and heavy rain to parts of the UK, and more wet weather is expected this weekend for Nottingham.\nWhilst Friday, December 29, is expected to be relatively dry, with cloudy and at some parts sunny weather, the rain is due to return over the weekend. Looking ahead to Saturday, December 30, the Met Office states: “A chilly start but soon turning milder with cloud increasing to bring a spell of rain through the morning.\nWhat three words would you use to describe Nottinghamshire? Let us know\n“Largely cloudy and often dry during the afternoon, though becoming windy. Maximum temperature 10 °C.” Saturday will see highs of 10C and lows of 6C as rain is predicted throughout the day, with especially heavy rain from 8am to 11am and from 7pm to 11pm.\n“There will be some light rain on Sunday, December 31, but the weather will predominately be cloudy. In its outlook for Sunday to Tuesday, January 2, the Met Office forecasts: “Windy with scattered blustery showers on Sunday.\n“Probably drier by Monday with fewer showers, though still breezy. Mainly dry with lighter winds Tuesday. Temperatures near or slightly below normal.”",

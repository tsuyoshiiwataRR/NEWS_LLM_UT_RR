    "text": "Two Queensland women who drowned in a stormwater drain following wild weather conditions have been identified as 46-year-old Tanya Hehir and 40-year-old Helen Bradford. The women were exploring a 2.4km drain called the \"love tunnel\" in Gympie with a friend when they were swept away by floodwaters. Their companion, a 46-year-old woman made it to safety and contacted police. Emergency services were called to the Kidd Bridge around 3.20pm. A search and rescue operation commenced involving water police, general duties officers, swift water rescue crews and the SES. Police first recovered Helen Bradford's body at 7:10pm on Boxing Day and Tanya Hehir's body on December 27. Tanya Hehir was a keen runner and a member of the Gympie Hash House Harriers. Gympie Regional Council mayor Glen Hartwig told the ABC that he would consider new safety measures in light of the tragedy. \"It's an old stormwater system that's been there since the foundation of Gympie,\" he said. \"It's not a place to be played with. It's not a place where you want to go and explore.\" Acting superintendent Paul Algie said in recent times that weather events were developing quickly and advised the public to be careful near water. \"There is always the chance tragedy can strike,\" he said.

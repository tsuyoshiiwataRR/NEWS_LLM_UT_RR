    "text": "LITTLE ROCK (KATV) — After North Little Rock's Burns Park was decimated by the [March 31st tornado](https://katv.com/news/local/national-weather-service-nws-catastrophic-tornado-moves-through-little-rock-central-arkansas-scattered-storms-forecast-severe-damaging-winds-threats-large-hail-warning-watch-deadly-dead-damage-jacksonville-cabot-river-twister-violent-chime-in-radar-maps), the city has been steadily repairing and reopening it. Yesterday, the city approved a resolution to enter a $3.1 million contract to rebuild Funland, the popular amusement park and crown jewel of Burns Park. Funland is the final piece of the puzzle in the restoration of Burns Park, and Mayor Hartwick says it'll soon be better than ever before. \"I thought the council putting the money forth is very important to keeping Burns Park alive,\" said North Little Rock Mayor Terry Hartwick. Of the $3.1 million being invested in Funland's restoration, just over $1 million will be contributed by FEMA, Hartwick said. It's been a challenging road to recovery since the March 31st tornado. The City of North Little Rock had just installed new rides for Funland when the tornado tore through Burns Park. \"On March 30, I was on a ride called the Twister—it was a brand-new ride the city just bought. Well, March 31, the twister took the Twister and it's gone,\" Hartwick said. Not much survived the tornado apart from, understandably, a tank, and Funland's iconic and beloved train, which many will be happy to know is going to be prominently featured in the new and improved Funland, complete with a tunnel. However, it's the new mission of Funland that's perhaps most exciting—the amusement park's new attractions will be all-inclusive and accessible to disabled children, with, among other things, a wheelchair-accessible see-saw. \"So, all kids have the same opportunities to enjoy Funland and Burns Park,\" Hartwick said. \"It's very important to me that we keep doing that.\" The new Funland will also feature some of the most impressive playground sets in Arkansas and what is likely to be the largest splash pad in Central Arkansas. The companies behind the new attraction designs are Development Consultants Incorporated (DCI) and GameTime. \"They've done other designs throughout the state. I guess they're one of the premier designers around—I just told them I want it by July 4, and I want it bigger and better than anyone else has got,\" Hartwick laughed. Funland is a source of happy childhood memories for Hartwick, like many others. The North Little Rock mayor said he was adamant that the amusement park be restored and open to the public by Independence Day next summer. \"I want the citizens, and the people, and the kids to take advantage of this by July 4 next year. That's what the intent is,\" Hartwick said. \" The reason why I wanted the kids to be able to play [in Funland] in the summer—I wanted to see them back in the pavilions, I want to see them in the waterslide. So that was special to me, so they made it happen...which is making Funland, Funland again.\"",

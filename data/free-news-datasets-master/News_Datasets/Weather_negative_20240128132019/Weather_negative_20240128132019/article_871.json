None cover Greater Manchester, but in total they do cover a large portion of the country.\nThree warnings are in place for rain and snow in Scotland, one is in Northern Ireland for rain, as is one covering most of Wales, and another is in place for wind for much of southern and western England, plus Wales.\nREAD MORE: The Tameside tornado: What is a &apos;supercell thunderstorm&apos; and how common are they in the UK?\nREAD MORE: &apos;We were lucky to get out alive&apos; - Huge clean-up operation as town counts the cost of 160mph &apos;tornado&apos;\nThey follow a period of turbulent weather in the UK which has seen a tornado hit Greater Manchester on Wednesday, leaving devastation in its wake . The warnings are as follows:\nIsle of Lewis, Scotland: Yellow warning for rain and snow from 8am on Saturday (December 30) to the end of the day.\nHighlands, Scotland: Yellow warning for rain and snow from 8am on Saturday (December 30) to the end of the day.\nLowlands, Scotland: Yellow warning for rain and snow from 8am on Saturday (December 30) to the end of the day.\nNorthern Ireland: Yellow warning for rain from 4am to 11am on Saturday.\nWales: Yellow warning for rain from 10am to 6pm on Saturday.\nSouthern and western England, and Wales: Yellow weather warning for wind from 11am on Saturday to 3am on Sunday (December 31).\nThe Met Office says it’s likely there will be disruption to transport networks, and powercuts may take place. Its alert said: “Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely. It’s likely that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and/or large waves.\n“Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer. Some short term loss of power and other services is possible. Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely.”\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

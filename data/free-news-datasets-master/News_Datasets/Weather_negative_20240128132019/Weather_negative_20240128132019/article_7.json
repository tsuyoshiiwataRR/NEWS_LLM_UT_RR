    "text": "Christmas day to be wet and rainy for the east coast Weather will be hot and sunny for the rest of AustraliaREAD MORE: Southern California braces for heavy rain\nRain and thunderstorms look set to dampen Christmas day for millions of Australians as the mild weather on the east coast is forecast to ‘intensify’ this weekend.\nSydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Canberra could see heavy rainfalls while the central and western areas of the country will likely be hot and dry.\nWeatherzone meteorologist Ben Domensino said a number of weather systems were working together to increase the chance of widespread rainfall over NSW, Victoria and Queensland.\n‘Potentially severe thunderstorms could hit parts of eastern and southeastern Australia on Christmas Day,’ Mr Domensino said.\n‘This is due to instability as moisture-laden air near the surface interacts with a colder pool of air aloft.’\n‘A broad low pressure trough over those states is also being fed by moisture-laden north-easterly winds.’\nHe added this was heightened by a positive Southern Annular Mode, which can bring wet weather to Australia’s east, and that there could even be hail in some parts on Christmas day courtesy of the cold and dry upper-level air.\nIt is looking like December 25 will be a wet one for the east coast as this rainfall map shows\nA number of weather systems are working together to cause the increased chance of rain, hail and heavy winds\nMr Domensino said particularly in north-eastern NSW and eastern Queensland, any storms that do develop ‘could cause large to giant hail, damaging to destructive winds and heavy rainfall’.\nHe said while storms might not be as fierce in Victoria ‘one of the main threats will still be heavy rain, which could cause areas of flash flooding’.\nSydney could escape most of the rain but as much as 8mm could fall over December 24 and 25.\nMelbourne will likely get more rain with 9mm on Sunday, up to 25mm on Monday and another 10mm on Tuesday.\nBrisbane will be wet and humid on Christmas Day with temperatures up to 33C and 20mm of rain followed by another 10mm on Tuesday.\nThis map shows convective available potential energy (CAPE) in the atmosphere forecast for December 25. The model is used to anticipate the severity of storms and shows northeast NSW and eastern Queensland could see wild storms\nIn Cairns, which has seen intense rain and flash flooding in the aftermath of Cyclone Jasper, it looks to be sunny with just a shower or two early in the week.\nAdelaide will see a mostly dry and sunny Christmas but cool with highs around 22C for early next week.\nDarwin will also be fairly dry, which is unusual for the monsoon season.\nIn Perth it will be an ideal warm and sunny Christmas with clear skies and maximums of 33C to 35C.\nPerth residents look to be in for great beach weather over Christmas while other capitals will be cool and wet (pictured: Bondi last year)",

    "text": "One of the grossest weather years in recent history is finally in the rearview.\nSome of the most memorable weather events that impacted the Bay State in 2023 included nasty wildfire smoke, several tornadoes, and relentless rain throughout the summer that sparked major flooding.\nParts of Massachusetts even had to shovel out from more than 3 feet of snow after a whopper of a mid-March nor’easter.\nThe most unusual weather of the year was the smoke from the Canadian wildfires, which caused the air quality to plummet across the region . The hazardous haze and smoke impacted the area at times for many weeks because the remote wildfires were out of control.\n“During the summer, we got caught in a persistent pattern where we had winds coming out of Canada, bringing that smoke into the area,” Bill Leatham, meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Boston office, told the Herald this week.\nWhile the wildfire smoke was a major story of the summer, so was the rain that never seemed to go away.\nIt was the second wettest summer in Boston recorded history , with 20.33 inches of rain. A normal summer in the city is 10.39 inches of rain.\nIn Worcester, it was the fifth wettest year in the city’s history. Worcester recorded 63.1 inches of rain for the year, which was 15 inches more than normal.\nJuly was extremely wet, with several flash flood and severe weather events. On July 16, for instance, thunderstorms produced flash flooding across much of southern New England and a few instances of wind damage, including a tornado in North Brookfield.\nIn eastern Massachusetts, rainfall totals of 2 to 3 inches fell within an hour. Videos went viral of rain flowing down the steps in Fenway Park.\nThe active pattern continued later in the month with a round of severe thunderstorms on July 27. Some of the strongest wind gusts reported were 66 mph in Westfield and 61 mph at Blue Hills in Milton.\nThe final July storm event occurred just two days later and featured wind damage and a tornado in Foxboro. Also, this line of storms sparked microbursts in Easton and Brockton.\nRelated Articles Weather |",

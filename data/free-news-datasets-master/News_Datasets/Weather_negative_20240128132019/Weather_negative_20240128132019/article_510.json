    "text": "Weather Update: Red Alert For Dense Fog In Delhi; Several Trains Cancelled, Over 100 Flights Delayed\nA red alert has been sounded in Delhi for Friday, along with an orange alert for December 30 and a yellow alert for the year-end and New Year’s Eve, as per the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). The region, along with North India, is grappling with mist and dense fog, disrupting travel and causing accidents.\nThe widespread fog has resulted in transportation challenges, affecting both train and air travel. On Thursday, low visibility impacted railway services, resulting in delays for 22 Delhi-bound trains.\nAt the Delhi airport, 134 flights, encompassing both domestic and international routes, faced delays on the previous day. Among them, 35 international departures and 28 international arrivals were affected, along with 43 domestic departures and 28 domestic arrivals.\nThe latest INSAT imagery from the Meteorological Department revealed a dense fog layer covering northern regions of India, including Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and northwest Madhya Pradesh.\nThe Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) extended its warning, projecting dense fog over Haryana and Punjab for the next five days. Uttar Pradesh is expected to experience similar conditions for the next three days, prompting the UP State Road Transport Corporation to issue guidelines for bus operations during periods of low visibility.\nIMD has issued a warning of dense fog persisting until December 31, with visibility ranging from 199 meters to 50 meters or even less. The meteorological department attributes the foggy conditions to an active Western Disturbance, predicting a partly cloudy sky on Friday.\nThursday marked the coldest day of the season in Delhi, with the maximum temperature recorded at 21.4 degrees Celsius, the lowest of the season. UP CM Yogi Adityanath had to postpone his Ayodhya visit due to the adverse weather conditions.\nIn response to the adverse weather, schools in Noida and Greater Noida are closed on December 29 and 30 for all classes. In Mathura, schools for classes one to eight will open at 10 am and close at 3 pm. Most districts in Haryana and Punjab experienced a day without sunshine.\nThe Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reported Delhi’s 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 358 on Thursday. This follows an earlier reading of 445 on Saturday morning, with specific areas like Jahangirpuri, Anand Vihar, and Bawana witnessing deplorable air quality conditions. The prevailing AQI categorizes Delhi’s air quality as “very poor” and “severe,” highlighting the persistent challenge of pollution in the region.",

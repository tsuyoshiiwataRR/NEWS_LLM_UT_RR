    "text": "Heart-stopping footage has emerged of water police rescuing passengers from a capsized yacht during a thunder storm. Gold Coast water police responded to calls for assistance at 10pm on Christmas night after severe storms lashed the region. Officers found the partially capsized yacht near Crab Island and South Stradbroke Island with two people onboard. Footage of the rescue shows police battling against heavy rain and large waves to board the yacht where one officer said the two people were \"trapped\". Bolts of lightning illuminate the chaotic scene, recorded on police bodycam, as the passengers are escorted to safety. Both people were not physically injured and were taken to Labrador on the Gold Coast. Police said a number of [requests for assistance](https://www.police.qld.gov.au/policelink-reporting) were received after the major storms with \"fallen trees, powerlines and other safety hazards continuing to be observed\". The public has been urged by [police ](https://www.crimestoppersqld.com.au/)to \"avoid driving, stay home if possible, and be aware of areas still affected by power outages\". \"All attempts are being made by officers to attend locations that require assistance.\" Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.

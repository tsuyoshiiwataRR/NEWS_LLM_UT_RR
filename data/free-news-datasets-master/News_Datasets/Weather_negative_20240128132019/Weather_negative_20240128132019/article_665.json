    "text": "The New Year is on the horizon and more freezing cold weather and snow could be on the way as we head into 2024, forecasters have warned.\nThe Met Office has delivered its verdict on another possible ‘Beast from the East’ hitting the UK, like the one we saw tear through the country back in 2018.\nThis chaotic weather event which brought hugely disruptive snowfall was caused by a Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) – and it’s feared that these conditions could be repeated as we head into 2024.\nThe Mirror reports that a SSW occurs when stratospheric winds change direction and blow from east to west. They can also slow down, or stop entirely.\nThis triggers warming in the stratosphere, opening the pathway for easterly winds to move southwards which can weaken the jet stream. And occasionally, these winds can be accompanied by a cold air mass, causing the temperatures to drop dramatically.\nWoman walking through heavy snow\nThe Met Office has said that colder spells in January are likely, but have downplayed any certainty of a SSW as it may be too soon to tell for certain.\nThey said: “Currently the chance of widespread severe cold is still deemed low, but still the risk of impacts from cold, ice and snow is greater than normal.”\nSpeaking to Sky News, Met Office spokesperson Stephen Dixon added: “It’s too early to tell if there will be a SSW event at the moment. Forecast models suggest a much weakened polar vortex over the coming weeks, but it’s not clear if this will result in an SSW or exactly how this will influence the UK’s weather patterns at this range.”\nThis comes after Storm Gerrit wreaked havoc on much of the UK this week, causing severe power cuts and leaving thousands of people stranded on the roads due to snow and flooding.\nIt’s estimated that around 1,500 homes in Scotland faced a second night without power as Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said they had restored power to as many as 46,000 properties who had lost power due to the storm.\nShetland was one of the worst affected areas, as well as the north east of England. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.”\nA supercell thunderstorm also moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday.\nAnd three men tragically lost their lives after their vehicle was submerged in the River Esk on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said.\nDon’t miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

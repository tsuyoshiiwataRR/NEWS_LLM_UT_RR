    "text": "Yahoo Finance Canada Gas prices in these cities saw double-digit falls this week amid December 'swoon' Read full article Jeff Lagerquist December 29, 2023 at 4:00 p.m. · 4 min read Gas prices in Canada have mirrored the December \"swoon\" that analysts describe in the U.S. market. (Xavier Lorenzo via Getty Images)\nGas prices fell at a more moderate pace this week in most Canadian cities, with double-digit declines in Whitehorse and Sarnia, Ont. weighing against gains at the pump in the Maritimes. According to prices from more than 70 cities compiled by data firm Kalibrate, the average retail cost of regular gasoline fell 1.6 cents per litre to $1.457 between Dec. 21 and Dec. 28.\nHalifax and Kentville, N.S. booked the biggest increases over those seven days, with prices rising 4.9 cents.\nLast week's inflation reading from Statistics Canada showed gasoline prices fell less sharply in November (-3.5 per cent) than October, when prices dropped 6.4 per cent.\nMeanwhile, consultants at global accounting firm Ernst & Young say the federal and provincial governments should expect to subsidize purchases of electric vehicles for at least the next five years .\n“Oil has served us very well as an economy, but the technology with EVs is just so much better,” Jason Clifton, a Calgary-based partner for EY, told Yahoo Finance Canada.\nStateside, analysts say drivers can expect to end 2023 with gasoline prices around their lowest levels of the year .\n\"Last year saw a similar gasoline price swoon in December, but this year’s version has much more breadth,\" Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at OPIS, told Yahoo Finance . \"The savings for consumers are substantial.”\nFollow Yahoo Finance Canada for more weekly gas price updates.

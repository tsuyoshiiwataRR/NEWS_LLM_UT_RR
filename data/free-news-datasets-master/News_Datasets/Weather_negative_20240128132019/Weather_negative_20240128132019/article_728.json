    "text": "Videos out of Ventura, California captured the moment a rogue wave jumped over a seawall Thursday, sweeping aside the cars and people in its path. Ventura isn't the only place experiencing tumultuous coasts. The National Weather Service has issued surf and flooding advisories along the California coast and in Hawaii. A video from Ventura officials opens on a seemingly tranquil scene. People are scattered along the seawall, leaning against it and watching the rolling waves in the distance. Suddenly, people start to back away from the wall moments before a wave spikes up in front of them. As it crashes down into the street, many of the people running get their feet knocked out from under them and a truck seems to skip forward in the waves. Another angle captured by Facebook user Colin Hoag shows the waves chasing him down the street. Officials urged people to avoid the ocean. High surf is expected through Saturday. Rogue waves: A rogue wave caused a cruise ship tragedy. They occur more often than you think. The Ventura County Fire Department was called to the scene of the wave shortly before 11 a.m. Thursday. \"It ended up being a total of eight patients due to surf that came over the wall and flooded the streets,\" Ventura County Fire Capt. Brian McGrath said. The injured were taken to the nearby hospitals. Residents in the neighborhoods near the incident were advised to leave, said Cmdr. Ryan Weeks with the Ventura Police Department. The patrons of a nearby hotel were also asked to leave. Roads in and around those areas were also closed. A National Weather Service meteorologist said a storm system over the Pacific is churning up swells. Here are the coastal weather warnings and watches issued by local NWS offices as a result of the storms: NSW Los Angeles Office - \"Dangerous Beach Conditions \" NWS San Diego Office - \"Marine and Coastal Hazards\" NWS San Francisco Office - All counties covered are under: Honolulu, Hawaii NWS Office",

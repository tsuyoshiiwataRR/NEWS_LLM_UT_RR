    "text": "Reports that a '15-day\nsnow bomb' could hit the UK in early January should be \"treated with caution\", the Met Office has said. Exacta Weather had predicted severe snowfall in early 2024.\nThere has even been talk of a second Beast from the East. Officially known as anticyclone Hartmut, the Beast from the East saw heavy snow and freezing conditions strike the UK in 2018.\nBut Met Office forecasters are urging caution over claims snowfall could hit the UK after Storm Gerritt sparked chaos across the country during\nChristmas week, as BirminghamLive reports. The Exeter-based weather forecaster said that it is too early to give any real details, but said models indicate that a SSW (Sudden Stratospheric Warming) event could occur on January 4 or 5.\nRead More:\nThousands heading for Cornwall festive dip will swim in sewage-dumped waters, Lib Dems say\nRead More:\nMystic Baba Vanga's predictions she got right - and what 2024 has in store\nJames Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, had said: “The risk is growing for a prolonged cold and snowy spell as we head into the early part of January. This is due to the risk growing for another SSW (Sudden Stratospheric Warming) event within this period, and this could bring the threat of another Beast from the East in early 2024.\n“There are now strong indications for a major SSW to occur during the early part of January, and if it does, many parts of the UK can expect to end up in the freezer with snow events and severe cold weather.”\nBut in response, a Met Office forecaster said: “Models are indicating there could be one (SSW) on 4 or 5 January. But it’s too early to give any real details and we have to wait to see if one actually happens. If it does then we would possibly see the effects towards the end of January.”\nIn recent years some extreme cold, winter snow events have all been connected to the surface effects of sudden stratospheric warming. An SSW was to blame for the infamous Beast from the East weather blast back in 2018. The term sudden stratospheric warming refers to what is observed in the stratosphere:- a rapid warming (up to about 50 °C in just a couple of days), between 10 km and 50 km above the earth’s surface.\nOn its website, the Met Office explains: \"Usually a few weeks later, we can start to see knock-on effects on the jet stream, which in turn effects our weather lower down (in the troposphere). However, the stratospheric sudden warming doesn’t happen every year, and it doesn’t always affect our weather when it does.\"\nIt means that northern Europe, including the UK is likely to get a long spell of dry, cold weather, whereas southern Europe will tend to be more mild, wet and windy. \"On the boundary of these areas, cold easterly winds develop and in some cases the drop in temperatures leads to snow,\" the Met Office says.\nIn its long-range forecast on their website, the Met Office say: \"Into the new year it now looks finely balanced whether near or slightly above temperatures will be in place across the south, with periods of rain, wind, and showers. Or if the slightly below average temperatures in place across the north; where showers will remain wintry, will manage to filter southwards or not. If the colder air filters southwards wintry showers could be seen across parts of England and Wales, and it is possible some more significant snowfall could occur along the mild / cold air boundary.\n\"Thereafter, more settled conditions are expected to gradually develop more widely, increasing the risk of frost and fog. If this were to occur day on day net cooling would lead to below average temperatures, with an increased threat of winter hazards, including ice/snow.\"\nFrom January 11 to January 25, it adds: \"Compared to normal, there is an increased chance of colder than average conditions during this period, and a reduced chance of prolonged periods of very unsettled / milder conditions with frequent rain and wind pushing in from the Atlantic. Currently the chance of widespread severe cold is still deemed low, but still the risk of impacts from cold, ice and snow is greater than normal.\"",

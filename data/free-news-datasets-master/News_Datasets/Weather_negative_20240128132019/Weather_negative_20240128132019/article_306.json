    "text": "Delhi-NCR experienced a hazy morning on Friday as the cold wave continued to hold its grip on Northern India, resulting in dense fog. Despite a slight improvement in fog conditions at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, the lowest visibility was recorded at 150 meters, with the Runway Visual Range (RVR) ranging from 400 to 800 meters, according to the India Meteorological Department. The thick fog led to delays in several flights at the Delhi Airport, affecting both arrivals and departures. Additionally, Delhi-bound trains faced delays due to low visibility. The Meteorological Department’s forecast warned of the possibility of visibility reducing to 50 meters in very dense fog and improving to 400 meters in moderate fog at the IGI airport. Passengers voiced their grievances over the inconvenience caused by the delays. A traveller, Mohd Shahrukh, expressed frustration as his flight was delayed by nearly three hours, impacting attendance at an important event. He stated, “A lot of people are facing difficulties due to the delay of flights.” The impact of dense fog extended to trains as well. Subhash, another passenger, highlighted delays affecting eight trains that were supposed to reach the previous night and uncertainty about their arrival times. The low visibility on roads due to dense fog also posed challenges for morning commuters. The India Meteorological Department has issued predictions of dense to very dense fog conditions across North Indian states for the next two days, cautioning travellers and urging caution on the roads.",

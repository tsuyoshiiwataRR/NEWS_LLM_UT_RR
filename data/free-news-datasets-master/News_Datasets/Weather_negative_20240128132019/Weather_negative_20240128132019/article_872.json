    "text": "In parts of Germany, people are still struggling with the effects of the continuous rain. Lower Saxony, which has been severely affected, has asked the Bundeswehr for support. The water level measured on Friday morning continued to exceed the highest alert level in many areas. Fears of a storm surge have not yet been confirmed, said state fire director Dieter Rohrberg. The flood situation varies from region to region, and no all-clear can yet be given for the whole of Lower Saxony. Interior Minister Daniela Behrens (SPD) said that the focus of the floods had shifted from the southeast to the northwest of the country in recent days with the water masses. A retirement and nursing home in Müden (Aller) in the district of Gifhorn has been evacuated because water has penetrated the house. 13 residents were taken out of the home, said Horst Kraemer, head of the Gifhorn district association of the German Red Cross (DRK). On Thursday, volunteers from the German Red Cross and the volunteer fire brigade had already accommodated around 20 residents in other retirement homes. In Meppen (Emsland), five people were rescued from a house surrounded by water with the help of a tractor. Initially, the fire department tried to rescue the people from the house with a boat, said a spokesman for the fire department. A farmer was finally able to drive his trekker through the water and use the trailer to get the trapped people out of the house. According to the report, the farmer was on site because he was transporting sandbags for security and offered his help. Appeal for voluntary renunciation of firecrackers A ban on firecrackers has been issued in some flood regions – for example in parts of Bremen and the municipality of Lilienthal in the district of Osterholz. Environment Minister Christian Meyer (Greens) appealed for a renunciation of New Year's Eve firecrackers in the areas affected by the floods. As a result, fewer missions could be required for the heavily stressed forces. The district of Osterholz fears that many onlookers will be out and about in the flood area on New Year's Eve. \"Please be considerate of the people and their belongings in the affected area and do not enter these areas,\" appealed District Administrator Bernd Lütjen (SPD). The work of the emergency services should not be made even more difficult. \"There are plenty of other ways to go for a walk on New Year's Eve weekend in our county.\" Animals are also still threatened due to the flooding. With an emergency plan, Serengeti Park Hodenhagen is preparing for further evacuations of animals. Of particular concern is the house of antelopes and giraffes, which is surrounded by water, said a spokeswoman for the zoo. \"These animals would have to be anesthetized for evacuation, which is a big risk.\" In several regions of Brandenburg, the flood situation has calmed down. According to the State Environment Agency, only light precipitation is expected until New Year's Day. On the Lusatian rivers such as the Neisse and the Black Elster, the all-clear was given. Elbe near Wittenberge continues to rise The Spree, on the other hand, remains under observation, it said. At individual gauges, there could be short-term but uncritical exceedances of the guideline values of alert level 1. For the flood wave in the Oder, no aggravation is to be expected for Ratzdorf and Eisenhüttenstadt. However, the water level of the Elbe in Wittenberge in the district of Prignitz is likely to rise further. On Saturday, alert level 2 of a total of four levels will therefore be declared, the State Office for the Environment announced. The city made preparations for a swelling of the flood water and has a guard service on hand to check on the dike. The authorities do not expect the situation to develop dramatically. The water level at the Wittenberge gauge on Friday afternoon was 5.20 metres. According to the forecast of the State Environment Agency, the water level should not exceed 6 meters until New Year's Day. Rivers had previously burst their banks, especially in the foreland of the dike. Farmers had to take their animals from the meadows. The Nedwighafen on the banks of the Elbe in Wittenberge, where caravans are usually located, was flooded with mud and water. The flooding on the Elbe also affected the construction work on the new A14 bridge between Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt. Due to the risk of flooding, construction workers had to move some office containers to safety. Circus is allowed to stay The city of Dresden in Saxony has lifted alert level 3 due to the Elbe flooding. Alert level 1 is now expected to apply until January 2, the administration announced. Originally, it had been predicted that the Elbe would reach a water level of six meters and more. This is the threshold for the second highest alert level 3. On Thursday, however, only a high of 5.95 meters was reached, since then the water has been sinking again. In the meantime, the Dresden Christmas circus, which is standing in a flume, is allowed to stay. The city had ordered the eviction because the circus had not voluntarily dismantled its tents. In view of the slight easing of flooding, an evacuation would now be disproportionate, said Eva Jähnigen, head of the environmental department. In North Rhine-Westphalia, the Ministry of the Environment is not giving the all-clear despite stagnating or falling water levels. \"We still have a major flood situation,\" said Environment Minister Oliver Krischer (Greens). So far, the consequences have remained manageable, no victims to mourn. There was no threat of dam failures or uncontrolled overflows at the dams. The flood protection systems would have held. However, the dikes have softened in many places. It had become clear that there was a need for renovation. bbr/dpa/AFP",

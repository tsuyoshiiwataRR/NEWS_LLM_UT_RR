    "text": "Year-end holiday makers across China are bracing for possible transport disruptions after the weather bureau warned heavy fog and haze would shroud areas from Hebei province in the north to southern Shanghai for more than 24 hours.\nThe Central Meteorological Observatory issued its first red alert for fog since 2017.\nConditions were expected to improve from Saturday evening when a cold wave of air is expected to blow across the country.\nMore than 600 flights were delayed in various cities including Urumqi, Hebei's Shijiazhuang, Shandong's Qingdao and Shanghai, tracking app Flight Master showed.\nSevere fog was expected in parts of northern province Hebei, central province Henan, eastern provinces Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong as well as in the municipalities Shanghai and Chongqing from Friday morning, the National Meteorological Centre said.\nDense fog is predicted in parts of Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shanghai leading to low visibility of less than 200 metres, and less than 50m in some areas.\nIn the north, around the capital of northwestern Xinjiang region, Urumqi and areas between the Yellow River and Huai River, light to moderate haze is forecast, with heavy haze affecting Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong and Henan.\nThe severe weather was due to high humidity and poor atmospheric diffusion conditions, the forecaster said.\nChina has experienced a year of climate extremes.\nMost of the country was hit by a cold snap last week that rewrote records with sub-freezing temperatures, in contrast to the summer, when scorching heat that breached 52 in the northwest blistered the country.\nSummer storms also brought record rainfall to Beijing and flooding elsewhere.\nOn Friday, the central observatory told the public to tune into weather and traffic alerts, and advised them to reduce time outdoors.\nResidents in parts of Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu should avoid going out unless necessary, it said.\nIn Shanghai, some ferry routes were temporarily suspended and some sections of highways, as well as a bridge to a container port, were temporarily closed.\nIn Jiangsu, some sections of several expressways remained shut since Thursday evening, while Hebei and Henan temporarily closed segments of multiple highways on Friday morning, citing weather conditions, according to state television CCTV and provincial capital authorities.",

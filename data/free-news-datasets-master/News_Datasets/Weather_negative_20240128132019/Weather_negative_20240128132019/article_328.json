    "text": "As September's autumn leaves fell and the weather turned chilly, the region went through a RAAC crisis, a storm and much more. Here are some of the biggest stories of 2023 from September to December.\nIn the last few months of 2023, the North East saw Olympic legend Mo Farah take part in the Great North Run, and face the fury of Storm Babet.\nPerhaps one of the most memorable moments from the end of the year came from Home Secretary James Cleverly who was accused of calling Stockton a \"sh*thole\" by MP Alex Cunningham.\nHere's your roundup of some of the biggest stories to hit the North East from September to December 2023.\nRAAC concrete crisis September 1, 2023\nLate August into early September saw the RAAC crisis unfold, and saw schools across the region close due to the suspected crumbling concrete which posed a danger for pupils.\nIn the following months, RAAC was found in multiple schools as well as institutions including James Cook University Hospital.\nSt Leonard's School in Durham is now expected to see RAAC repairs continue until 2026, and parents and pupils launched the 'Save Our School' campaign.\nProtest at St Leonards School.

We do take it very seriously.\n\"It will have an impact on our reputation, the morale of our staff and most importantly on expectant mothers. Some people won’t get past one word of the report.\"\nRead here.\nXL Bully ban: North East dog trainers speak out September 18, 2023\nThe government announced earlier this year that XL Bully breed dogs will be banned - meaning that owners were left with months to safely register their dogs in order to keep them.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak announced the ban on September 16, calling the breed \"dangerous\", following a string of attacks that saw a 52-year-old man mauled to death in the West Midlands and a man in Shiney Row, Sunderland fatally injured by an 'XL Bully'.\nKatie Guastapaglia, a dog trainer and founder of Dogwood Adventure Play in Stockton, described her shock and heartbreak when she first heard of the ban.\nKatie admitted she was \"devastated\" and has since utilised her business to provide free training for concerned XL bully owners.\nRead here.\nXL bully.

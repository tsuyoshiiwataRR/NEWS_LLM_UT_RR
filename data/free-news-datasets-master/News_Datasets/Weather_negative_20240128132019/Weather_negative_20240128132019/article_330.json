    "text": "An American Airlines plane bounced along a London runway Wednesday as it battled strong gusts that nearly carried it back into the sky.\nHeart-pounding video shows the Boeing 777 wobbling from left to right just several hundred feet above the London Heathrow Airport pavement as it attempts to land at 11:45 a.m. following a seemingly confident and effortless descent.\nThe shaky aircraft’s nose then straightens out to level with its body before bouncing straight into the air again, the footage shared by Big Jet TV shows.\nSomehow, the pilots were able to wrestle the massive aircraft back onto the ground for a safe landing.\nThe308-seat plane had battled strong crosswinds and heavy fog brought in by Storm Gerrit, a supercell thunderstorm that caused widespread flooding, ripped rooves off houses and killed several people throughout the United Kingdom.\nDespite flying through the strong winds — which reached 80 mph in some areas — the American Airlines aircraft was only 20 minutes late arriving at Europe’s largest airport, FlightAware data shows.\nIt had made the 6,000-mile and nearly 11-hour trip from California when it was met with the scary turbulence.\n4\nAn American Airline’s Boeing 777 began wobbling in the air as it made its final approach to London’s Heathrow Airport on Dec. 26. Big Jet TV/YouTube\n4\nThe 308-seat plane had battled strong crosswinds and heavy fog brought in by Storm Gerrit that has battered the United Kingdom. Big Jet TV/YouTube\nNo injuries associated with the terrifying touchdown were reported.\nHowever, Storm Gerrit would later force Heathrow to cancel 18 flights because of air traffic control restrictions on domestic routes. Flights to European cities like Barcelona and Berlin were also affected.\nThe storm also caused widespread disruption to train service several hundred miles north in Scotland, where travel on some lines was suspended until officials could carry out a full inspection of the network. A tree fell and hit the driver’s cabin on one train, but no one was injured.\n4\nThe aircraft was tilted moments before its tires made contact with the ground. Big Jet TV/YouTube\n4\nSomehow, the pilots were able to wrestle the massive aircraft back onto the ground for a safe landing. Big Jet TV/YouTube\nAmerican Airlines did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.\nWith Post Wires",

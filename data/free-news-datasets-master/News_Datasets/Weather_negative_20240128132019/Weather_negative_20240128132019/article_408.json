    "text": "Storm Gerrit may have come and gone, but it appears that the country will continue to experience yet more unsettled weather conditions this weekend in the lead up to the [New Year.](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/new-year) It had been reported earlier this week that [Ireland could be hit by the tail end of Storm Henk](https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/ireland-facing-prospect-another-storm-31754508) which was set to peak out over the Atlantic, but could still \"pack a punch\" on Ireland, according to weather expert Alan O'Reilly of the Carlow Weather page on X (formerly This forecast appears to be coming true for much of the country - the west and the south in particular - as [Met Éireann](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/met-eireann) has put Status Yellow rain and wind warnings in place for Friday and Saturday respectively. The national forecaster officially marked the northwestern counties of [Donegal](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/donegal), [Leitrim](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leitrim), [Sligo](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/sligo) and North [Mayo](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/mayo) with a Status Yellow rain warning as heavy rainfall is due with a risk of flooding possible, valid from 6am to 9pm on Friday. Read More: [Ireland live lightning tracker as weather warnings issued and Met Eireann names 'hotspots'](https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/ireland-live-lightning-tracker-weather-31761995) Carlow Weather's Alan O'Reilly says that up to 30mm of rainfall is possible over a 24-hour period in these counties in line with the Status Yellow warning. A separate Status Yellow wind warning is in place in the south going into Saturday too, as [Cork](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cork), [Kerry](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kerry), [Waterford](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/waterford) and [Wexford](https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/wexford) are earmarked to receive \"strong to gale force and gusty\" winds, leading to potential coastal flooding when coupled with high Spring tides. The warning comes into effect between 2am to 12pm on Saturday. Met Éireann's forecast the weekend is as follows, starting with Friday: \"Windy at first this morning with fresh to strong and gusty westerly winds, gradually easing. There will be sunny periods and some showers for much of the country, some of which will be heavy. However, showery rain will persist in parts of the north and northwest for much of the day with some localised flooding likely and a chance of a little sleet in the north too. Highest temperatures of 4 to 8 degrees, possibly a little lower in some northern parts.\" \"Some clear spells at first tonight with just isolated showers. Lowest temperatures of -1 to +3 degrees with some frost and icy stretches forming with light to moderate southwesterly or variable breezes.\" The forecast shows a similar outlook for Saturday: \"A wet and windy start to the day with widespread rain, heavy or thundery at times with some localised flooding possible. The rain will clear to sunny spells and showers from the western half of the country through the morning, extending to all areas through the afternoon. \"Some showers will be heavy with a chance of isolated thunderstorms and hail. Highest afternoon temperatures of 5 to 9 degrees, coolest in the northwest. Fresh to strong and gusty southerly winds, with onshore gales, will mean there is a chance of coastal flooding in the south and southwest.\" Sunday - New Year's Eve - has can expect the following: \"Breezy or windy with sunny spells and scattered showers and a chance of hail. Fresh to strong and gusty westerly or cyclonic variable winds will gradually decrease moderate to fresh and gusty through the day. Highest temperatures of 6 to 9 degrees generally.\" New Year's Eve revellers in particular will be interested in the Sunday night forecast: \"Showers will continue overnight, mainly for Atlantic counties with longer spells of rain possible in the northwest. Some frost or ice will form with lowest temperatures of 0 to 4 degrees in mostly moderate westerly winds.\" The outlook for Monday is: \"Sunny spells and scattered showers at first, becoming more isolated through the morning and early afternoon. Cloud will build from the southwest later. Highest temperatures of 5 to 8 degrees in light to moderate southwest winds, backing southerly and falling mostly light later.\" Met Éireann says Tuesday will see outbreaks of rain and drizzle in the south will clear through the morning, becoming dry until night with some showers and highest temperatures of 3C to 6C degrees.

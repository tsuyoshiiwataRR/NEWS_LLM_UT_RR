    "text": "The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning ahead of the New Year's weekend as the country recovers from Storm Gerrit. Just days after the storm wreaked havoc on roads, damaged properties and cut power across the UK, another band of powerful winds are set to strike the nation. The warnings covers the whole of the South West, parts of western Wales and the South English coastline. The Met Office has said this wave of bad [weather](https://www.devonlive.com/all-about/weather) is caused by an active cold front which will move eastwards on Saturday, December 30 and into New Year's Eve. The alert is in place from 11am on Saturday until 3am on Sunday morning. The Exeter-based forecaster says: \"A spell of strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services.\" There may be some disruption to road, rail, ferry and air transport services, power cuts and large waves along the coastline. \"An active cold front will move east across England and Wales during Saturday and into Sunday and will be characterised by strong winds and some heavy rain,\" the Met Office adds. \"Gusts of 45-50 mph widely, but squally near the cold front with some gusts around 60 mph, whilst the strongest gusts are likely near coasts in the west and south, with 65-75 mph in places.\" It comes just days after similar conditions brought by Storm Gerrit. Parts of the UK faced winds of more than 80mph, with trees and scaffolding blown down by the powerful gusts. In Greater Manchester, around 100 properties were damaged by a 160mph 'tornado' which reportedly swept through the city. The warning is expected to end at around 3am on Sunday, December 31 and the strong winds are likely to weaken through the day and into January 1. Though the warning is just for wind, heavy rain is also expected the batter the region. Steven Ramsdale is a Met Office Chief Forecaster. He said: “This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.” What to Expect - Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely - It’s likely that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and/or large waves - Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer - Some short term loss of power and other services is possible - Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely",

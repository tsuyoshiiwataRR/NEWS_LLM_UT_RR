    "text": "Met Ã‰ireann has issued three weather warnings for much of the country as the island prepares for strong winds and heavy rainfall up until New Year's Day. A status yellow rainfall warning has been issued for Donegal, Leitrim, North Mayo and Sligo. The warning, which came into effect at 6am on Friday, will remain in place until 9pm on Friday night, with \"localised flooding\" expected as a result of heavy rainfall. The forecaster has issued a status yellow wind and rain warning for Cork, Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Mayo and Wexford, with \"strong and gusty\" winds expected over the coming days. The warning, which will come into effect at 2am on Saturday and remain in place until 11pm on Saturday night, poses the risk of flooding along coastal areas. Other potential impacts include surface flooding and wave overtopping, followed by loose debris on roads and difficult travelling conditions, while the warning is in place. The forecaster has also issued an additional weather warning for those in Cork, Kerry, Clare and Limerick. The status yellow wind warning will begin from 11pm on Saturday night and remain in place until 5pm on Sunday. The forecaster warns of strong winds which may affect travelling conditions over this period. The warnings follow severe weather conditions over the past few days, resulting in major power outages and spot flooding across the country. A taxi driver in Waterford City was hospitalised on Wednesday night after his car was hit by a falling tree during high winds. It happened in the Newtown area at around 11pm, and the driver was treated for minor injuries. Saturday's weather forecast promises a wet and windy day, with threatening thunderstorms and hail as the day progresses. \"Fresh to strong and gusty southerly winds, with onshore gales, will mean there is a chance of coastal flooding in the south and southwest,\" the forecaster said. New Year's Day is expected to bring a mix of sunshine and scattered showers, with much milder temperatures than previous days. Highest temperatures of between 5C and 8C can be predicted over the course of the day. 2024 is expected to start on a wet note, with outbreaks of rain and scattered showers travelling across the country from the west.",

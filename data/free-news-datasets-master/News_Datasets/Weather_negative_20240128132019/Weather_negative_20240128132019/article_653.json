    "text": "[Watch: Enormous, Terrifying Rogue Wave Hits California Beach, Hospitalizing 8 People While Sweeping Away Cars](/news/rogue-wave-hits-california-beach-hospitalizing-8-people-while-sweeping-away-cars?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=trending_story) On the college campus where I sometimes teach these days, my students have told me they have never seen their friends so divided. They describe deeply dug-in opposing camps, variously and often vociferously focused on Hamas’s barbaric Oct. 7 attack on Israel, Israel’s military response and the tragic civilian impact in Gaza, one-sided claims as to which side bears responsibility, and feelings of vulnerability and victimhood. Since the reason I am on campus is to teach strategy and how to move forward and win — drawing on the [campaign I led](http://www.freedomtomarry.org/) to win marriage for same-sex couples — I thought about what lessons the freedom-to-marry transformation might offer for the admittedly very different, more complex challenge of Middle East peace. What are some of those lessons? Don’t be afraid to set a bold goal In 1983, when I wrote my law school thesis advocating that we fight for the freedom to marry, nowhere in the world could same-sex couples marry. Today, we can on every continent, in 36 countries, including the United States. In books like [This is an Uprising](https://masscommons.wordpress.com/2018/07/16/this-is-an-uprising-pulling-away-the-pillars-of-support/), scholars now lift up the Freedom to Marry campaign as an example of transformational, rather than transactional, change. In the latter, advocates choose a goal they believe to be immediately attainable. Transformational change, by contrast, comes about when people aim for the change they really want — undaunted by cynicism, complacency, hopelessness or self-congratulatory “pragmatism.” I believe the necessary foundation for a future of greater peace, prosperity and happiness for Israelis, Palestinians and their neighbors is the two-state solution, so that is the goal we should proclaim and pursue. Don’t dwell on the problem. Talk about the pathway [Palestinian Poll Finds Strong Support for Hamas, Oct. 7 Attacks, ‘River to the Sea’ State](/news/palestine-poll-hamas-support-war-israel-state-river-sea?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) [Biden’s Growing Challenge: Israel-Hamas War and the Future of Gaza](/opinion/biden-israel-hamas-war-gaza-future-civilian-deaths-terrorism?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) [Israel, Gaza, Hamas and Iran: Key Questions after War Erupts](/news/israel-gaza-hamas-and-iran-key-questions-after-war-erupts?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) [Gay Israeli Soldier Pictured With LGBTQ Flag in Gaza](/news/gay-israeli-soldier-pictured-with-lgbtq-flag-in-gaza?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) [Boyfriend of Shani Louk, Peace Activist Paraded Naked Through Streets of Gaza on Oct. 7, Is Alive and in Hamas Captivity](/news/shani-louk-boyfriend-alive-in-captivity-orion-hernandez-rado-israel-hamas?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) [Chris Cuomo Gets Israel War on Hamas After Seeing Oct. 7 Video: ‘Was Absolute Genocide’](/news/chris-cuomo-newsnation-genocide-hamas-oct-7-video-israel-reaction-gaza-war?utm_source=onsite&utm_medium=related_story) What makes people rally to a bold, seemingly impossible goal is not just the compelling vision but the clarity of strategy: the pathway that will get you there. At Freedom to Marry, we called our strategy the “ [Roadmap to Victory](http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/Roadmap-to-Victory)” and propounded it again and again. The [initial deal yielding a temporary ceasefire](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israelhamas-war-hostage-deal-ceasefire-gaza-2023-11-22/) and the return of some of the Hamas-held hostages in Gaza demonstrated how progress can be made, even in a bleak moment. Both Israelis and Palestinians need new leaders who articulate the goal and commit to steps that can be taken immediately, as well as some that will proceed in stages on the pathway. [Polls show](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231013-poll-94-of-israelis-say-govt-failing-to-protect-them/) Israelis agree that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his [right-wing coalition](https://www.npr.org/2022/12/15/1142813395/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-government) have to go, and soon. And it is long past time for a new generation of Palestinians, truly committed to peace, to step into power in an overhauled, less corrupt, more capable legitimate government. The pathway also will require increased investment, pressure and cover from the United States, Arab nations and other key players. Trust that things, and people, can change In 1983, only 11% of Americans supported marriage for same-sex couples. Over the next 32 years until we won, I cited lessons from what I called “ [the scary work of winning](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ftm-assets/ftm/Scarywork.pdf).” One such lesson was that while we can’t win every battle and undoubtedly will encounter bitter setbacks, we could, on the right pathway, keep working so as to “lose forward.” And now we are at [more than 70% support](https://news.gallup.com/poll/506636/sex-marriage-support-holds-high.aspx). Even painful losses can propel gains. The Middle East conflict illustrates that as well. Out of the 1973 Yom Kippur War came the momentum and leadership that achieved peace between Israel and Egypt and, subsequently, other Arab states. Out of the first intifada came impetus for the Oslo peace process that led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority and what could have been — if not for leadership failures on both sides — a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza already. Now, too, in the shock and horror of this bitter moment, we must trust that, from bad, we can make good. Transformation requires building blocks To build and sustain support, we had to make sure our marriage goal and strategy were accompanied by building blocks of success. Our national strategy called for state-by-state campaigns, incremental achievements and persuasion achieved community by community, conversation by conversation. Resolution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict must similarly leverage the promise of the two-state solution and a better future to sustain willingness to get there in stages. Coexistence and security will require real sacrifices. Israel will have to withdraw from many, perhaps most, West Bank settlements; Palestinians will have to accept a period of international engagement that includes peacekeeping forces, perhaps from Arab states or trusted neutrals. Both sides will have to beat back threats from their extremists; neither side will get everything it wants. But both can get a pathway to autonomy, prosperity and an end to bloodshed. Not everyone who is not yet with you is your foe At Freedom to Marry, we distinguished between true hard-core opponents and those who, while resistant, fearful or even ignorant, we could persuade. I called them the “reachable but not yet reached.” We worked to give people a pathway to resolve their conflicted feelings and impulses in favor of empathy, growth and acceptance. We didn’t smear or slam the door on those not yet with us. We helped them, as President Barack Obama put it, “ [evolve](https://www.politico.com/story/2012/05/evolve-obama-gay-marriage-quotes-076109).” Unlike the marriage campaign, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict involves a clash of rights and wrongs on both sides. Yet, too much discourse gets taken or pushed to extremes, swiftly becoming polemical and destructive. One could rehash the long, tangled history of the Middle East — and each side’s deeply held perspectives, myths, narratives and grievances — forever. As Yitzhak Rabin said, “You don’t make peace with friends. You make it with very unsavory enemies.” We don’t have to agree on everything, nor should we allow some disagreement to preclude cooperation. You don’t need ‘every.’ You need ‘enough’ As with the freedom to marry, the two-state solution does not require bringing everyone along. Extremists, maximalists and nihilists will seek to undermine progress, stoking and engaging in violence. Achieving change doesn't demand universal agreement, just a critical mass. Change takes time. Progress comes from hope This is an Uprising offers up the metaphor of a massive dictator’s statue towering above imposing pillars. Advocates of change shake and shake those pillars but nothing seems to happen — until one day, one pillar comes down, then another, and eventually, the whole edifice of oppression collapses. I often say we can sum up how we won the freedom to marry in three words: Hope, clarity and tenacity. What makes change happen is sticking with the work through challenges and setbacks. What sustains the requisite tenacity is clarity of goal and strategy, leadership, as well as being able to see those building blocks of success that validate and make up the pathway to a better future. But it all begins with hope: You must believe — and convey to a critical mass — the belief that we can get there. “If you will it, it is no dream,” wrote Theodore Herzl, founder of the Zionist movement. Or, as the Quran instructs, “If you make it possible, it is possible.” Evan Wolfson founded and led [ Freedom to Marry](http://www.freedomtomarry.org/), the campaign to win marriage for same-sex couples. He now advises and assists other causes and countries seeking to adapt the elements of success to other important goals.

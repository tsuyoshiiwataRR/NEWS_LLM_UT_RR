    "text": "Just over 60 years ago, Britain experienced its worst winter in nearly 200 years. Known as the ‘Big Freeze’, the winter of 1962/63 saw some of the harshest conditions ever recorded, lasting up to 10 weeks.\nDown in Kent, the sea froze for nearly a mile, allowing children to play on its surface while ships sat on the ice. While the wintry outbreak began in December 1962, the snows started on Boxing Day with biting temperatures, hitting as low as -20C in some parts, lasting until March.\nThe Arctic conditions meant thousands of schools closed, telephone and power lines came down, and power cuts hit thousands of homes. Just before the New Year, a blizzard swept across South West England and Wales, causing snow drifts more than 20ft in places, driven by gale-force winds.\nRoads and railways were blocked while residents of remote villages were left stranded and without electricity. Even in Manchester city centre, the snow was six inches deep – even deeper in the suburbs.\nIn Rochdale, then part of Lancashire, Hollingworth Lake was frozen over for weeks, in places to depths of two feet. The first weekend in February saw people taking a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to walk across the surface.\nEdge Hill College pond skaters. Taken from hall of residence, Lancashire Hall, near to Scarth Hill, Lancashire, in the severe winter of 1962/3\nAn account of the ‘Big Freeze’ written by The Guardian called ‘The Long Winter 1962-63’ claims the winter was responsible for at least 49 deaths. In Lancashire, two climbers were killed by an avalanche in the Chew Valley, near Oldham, and a man was reportedly found dead in a stranded car near Blackburn.\nNewspapers reported the severe frost had burst pipes in hundreds of homes in Lancashire while police smashed ice on canals and ponds, warning children to keep off the ice. The danger was real; eight years earlier, 21 Lancashire children drowned in ice accidents on one Saturday alone.\nSport during this terrible winter was also heavily disrupted. In the days before under-soil heating, frozen pitches saw football and rugby matches cancelled.\nFrom December 8 to February 16, Bolton Wanderers played no competitive matches. Burnley went 63 days without a league game, stretching from December 29, 1962, until March 2, 1963.\nDespite the chaos caused by the arctic conditions, there was still the opportunity for fun. Despite warnings, children and adults skated on frozen lakes and rivers. Giant snowmen were built while tobogganing became a national pastime while the snows endured.\nChildren on top of a giant snowball in Sefton Park, Liverpool (then part of Lancashire), during the Big Freeze of January 1963\nIn early March 1963, the ice began to thaw as temperatures rose, and by March 6, there were no frosts anywhere in the UK. Parts of the country that had just been in the iron grip of a bitter winter were now faced with floods as the ice and snow melted.\nDo you remember the ‘Big Freeze’ of 1963?

The German Weather Service (DWD) predicts heavy rainfall. In the reservoirs of the Bergisches Land and the Siegerland in North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the Harz Mountains, continuous rain is to be expected from Friday morning until the night to Saturday. Up to 40 liters per square meter could fall within 24 hours. The situation in Lower Saxony is tense. In eastern Germany, too, many fire brigades are still in continuous operation. In Lower Saxony, areas along the rivers Aller, Leine and Weser in the southern and central parts of the state are affected. The situation there worsened further on Thursday. The dikes were no longer able to withstand the masses of water everywhere. Thousands of helpers are working across the country. Evacuations were prepared in some places. In the municipality of Langlingen in the district of Celle, about 120 people left their houses and apartments as a precaution on Friday night. Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) said on Thursday that there had never been a flood of this magnitude before. \"Experts have long warned that the increasing frequency of weather extremes is linked to climate change,\" he said. According to the Ministry of the Interior, a so-called extraordinary event was detected in six districts as well as the city of Oldenburg. With this measure, for example, districts can more easily access emergency services for support. There is also no all-clear yet around Bremen. According to the authorities on Thursday evening, numerous houses along the Wümme in the Katrepel area are surrounded by water and without electricity. Most of the residents have left this area. In the district of Timmersloh, the water is standing on the dikes. Roads and fields are flooded. According to the information provided by the Interior Ministry, measures to secure the dike have already had to be carried out several times. On the Elbe in Saxony, rising water levels are expected. Early Thursday afternoon, 5.92 meters were measured in Dresden. From the six-metre mark, the second-highest alert level 3 would apply. The state flood control center expected this limit to be exceeded on Friday morning - but only very slightly with a maximum of 6.01 meters. Normally, a water level of two meters is normal in the Elbe in the state capital. The hydrologists expected a decrease in the Elbe flood water from Friday, as a spokesman for the State Office for the Environment, Agriculture and Geology said. Only locally light rain is expected, in the Czech catchment area of the Elbe neither precipitation nor snowmelt until Friday. Downstream in Magdeburg and Schönebeck in Saxony-Anhalt, the State Agency for Flood Protection and Water Management opened the Pretzien weir on Thursday. This means that about a third of the Elbe's water is channelled past the two cities through a flood channel and across meadows and fields before flowing back into the Elbe. In the north of Thuringia, the focus is on the Kelbra dam, from which water has been drained. In the village of Mönchpfiffel-Nikolausrieth, about 30 houses were threatened with flooding, as a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior announced on Thursday. Emergency services had set up 6000, sandbags on the riverbank to prevent this. According to the information, the water was about ten centimeters below the edge of the bank. wit/dpa",

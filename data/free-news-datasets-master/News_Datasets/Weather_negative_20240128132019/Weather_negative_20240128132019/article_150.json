    "text": "Severe weather attributed to Storm Gerrit wreaked havoc across the United Kingdom, with a reported tornado in Manchester and a tragic incident in flood-hit North Yorkshire resulting in three fatalities. The deadly episode occurred when a 4×4 vehicle encountered difficulties in the River Esk near Glaisdale during the storm, [The Times reported.](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/storm-gerrit-uk-map-tornado-manchester-weather-warnings-train-delays-3m77w9f7l) As Storm Gerrit continued its sweep, authorities issued warnings about hazardous conditions, emphasizing the risks of driving amidst the chaos. In Manchester, the tornado led to significant property damage, including roofs being torn off, while Morecambe Bay experienced the onslaught of a “supercell thunderstorm.” The emergency services responded to the incident near Glaisdale, with three men losing their lives after the submerged vehicle was recovered by the fire service. The River Esk area in North Yorkshire faced particular challenges, with roads severely affected and additional incidents of cars becoming trapped in water. Despite these dangers, one individual attempting to assist was successfully rescued. In the broader context, Storm Gerrit’s impact extended beyond North Yorkshire, causing disruptions throughout the country. The Met Office faced criticism as residents in Scotland, caught off guard by the storm’s intensity, questioned the adequacy of the initially issued yellow warnings. The aftermath included 80mph winds, blizzards, and heavy rain, with flood alerts affecting various regions, particularly in the Midlands and the north of England. Amid the chaos, Stalybridge in Tameside, Greater Manchester, bore the brunt of a T5 tornado, causing damage to around 100 homes. As the storm subsided, the Met Office committed to reviewing the efficiency of its weather alerts in the coming days, acknowledging the need for a comprehensive assessment of Storm Gerrit’s impact and response.",

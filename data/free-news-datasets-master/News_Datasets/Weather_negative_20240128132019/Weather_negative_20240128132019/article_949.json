    "text": "The Naval Hydrography Service (SHN) issued a warning on Friday for a strong flood of the Río de la Plata in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA), as well as in the coastal areas of the north and south of the Buenos Aires suburbs.\nAccording to the report, the alert is in effect from the afternoon and it is anticipated that the river level will exceed normal values by at least two meters, in some cases exceeding 3 meters.\nThe message also affects several localities in La Plata. In that Buenos Aires port, in Ensenada, the water level is expected to exceed 3.10 meters. For the port terminal of Buenos Aires, meanwhile, the projected height is 3.20 meters, while in the port of San Fernando it could reach 3.30 meters.\nThe river is expected to begin to recede on Saturday, according to the SHN report, with levels dropping to at least one meter above normal.\nThe last similar record occurred a few days ago and was after the powerful storm of December 17 when the water exceeded the height of 3.5 meters and generated flooding in the AMBA.\nCity sources reported that this was the highest record in more than 10 years. In fact, it surpassed the previous peak, in 2010, which was 3.58 meters. In San Fernando, meanwhile, it reached 3.60 meters.\nOn that occasion, different streets in the districts of the City of Buenos Aires, Tigre, San Fernando, Avellaneda and Quilmes, among others, began to flood. Videos of water rushing through neighborhoods closest to the river quickly went viral on social media. Now the authorities have warned of a similar situation.\nFor this Friday the weather in the City of Buenos Aires and the Buenos Aires suburbs will be with somewhat cloudy skies, low probability of showers until the afternoon, wind from the southeast sector, with gusts of up to 50 kilometers per hour during the day, and the temperature will have a minimum of 19 degrees and a maximum of 27 degrees. reported the National Meteorological Service (SMN).\nFor tomorrow, Saturday, the agency forecasts a day with clear to slightly cloudy skies, then partly cloudy, winds from the southeast rotating to the east, then to the northeast, and a temperature that will be between 12 degrees minimum and 26 degrees maximum.",

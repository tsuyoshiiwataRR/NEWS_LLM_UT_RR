    "text": "Holidaymakers aiming to hit slopes in Italy and France are facing disappointment\nHolidaymakers aiming to hit the slopes in Italy and France are facing disappointment as the warmest December in Italy in 130 years and heavy rain in the French Alps threaten to wipe out the ski season.\nItaly’s northern region of Piedmont, experiencing its warmest December since the 1890s, has seen winter resorts shutting down runs due to a lack of snow.\nBardonecchia, a popular resort near the French border, has been particularly affected by a high-pressure weather system, with temperatures reaching as high as 16C in the depths of December.\nResorts in the Apennine mountains outside Rome, including Terminillo and Ovindoli, have also faced challenges with inadequate snow cover, leading to the closure of slopes despite busy Christmas bookings.\nMeanwhile in France, the popular resorts of Morzine and Les Gets were forced to delay the opening of the ski season due to monsoon like downpours, with temperatures not cold enough to precipitate proper snowfall.\nThough some light powder was dusted on the slopes in recent days, more rain is expected to overrun the slopes.\nThe disappointing conditions come after Spanish meteorologists warned that December temperatures across much of Western and Southern Europe would be far higher than normal.\nRuben del Campo, a spokesperson for Spain’s national weather agency, said earlier this month that the unseasonable heat, coupled with predictions of sparse rainfall until the end of February, heralded a ‘not very good’ season for winter sports that depend on abundant snow, which once melted is also a crucial water resource for the spring and summer months.\nBardonecchia, a popular resort near the French border, has been particularly affected by a high-pressure weather system, with temperatures reaching as high as 16C in the depths of December\nLes Gets Ski Slope 29/12/23\nTerminillo Ski Slope 29/12/23\nLe Plateau de Nyon, Morzine Ski Slope 29/12/23\nTemperatures across Spain in mid-December smashed records, pushing the mercury close to 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) in the south and delaying the start of the ski season.\nAnd several regions of Italy normally ripe for skiing at this time of year have been far warmer than usual as temperatures in the Alpine city of Turin crested 20C the week before Christmas.\nEnrico Rossi, director of the ski lift company Colomion and vice-president of the Bardonecchia tourism consortium, admitted that there was not enough snow to open all the slopes.\n‘During this period last year, we had four more [slopes] open. We have given priority to the beginner slopes, making artificial snow for them. We are postponing the opening of the difficult ones, which are also the least crowded,’ he told The Telegraph.\nLuca Mercalli, president of the Italian Meteorological Society, attributed the rise in temperatures to global warming and warned of a grim outlook for Alpine regions, saying the temperatures he had seen in December were akin to those expected in late summer.\n‘The continuous increase in temperatures due to global warming will cause a further reduction in the winter season in the future, with more rain and less snow even at high altitudes.\n‘In the days before Christmas, to find zero degrees celsius you had to go up to almost 3,000 metres [9,900ft] and these are temperatures we normally find in late summer,’ he added.\nSunset time in the Italian Alps, view of the town of Bardonecchia, Piedmont\nFILE: A low-angle action shot of skiing action in the French ski resort of Morzine, in the European Alps\nIt comes after higher temperatures and adverse weather conditions wrought havoc on the skiing World Cup in early December.\nRainfall in the French Alps forced the cancellation of six races.\nSharing a statement on December 10, t he International Ski and Snowboard Federation said the men’s slalom – one of the centrepieces of the World Cup – could not start ‘due to the present slope conditions after last night’s rain and snow to ensure the safety and fairness for the racers.’\nThe scheduled start time already was pushed back Saturday in anticipation of course workers needing more time to clear the snow and ensure parts of the run which had been lashed by rain were safe to ski on.\nThe race likely will be rescheduled at a different venue later in the season.",

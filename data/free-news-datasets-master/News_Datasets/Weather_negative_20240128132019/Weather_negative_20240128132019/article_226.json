    "text": "Â© Reuters. Prolonged power outages in South-East Queensland amid extreme weather conditions South-East Queensland is grappling with prolonged power outages expected to last almost a week, as deadly wild weather continues to disrupt electricity supply.\nThe situation is exacerbated by an imminent heatwave, with temperatures forecast to soar into the 40s in some parts of Queensland.\nPower outages\nTens of thousands of residents in the Gold Coast and regions south of Brisbane are facing a bleak New Year weekend without electricity, following severe storms that ravaged a significant portion of Australia's east coast since Christmas.\nThese storms have caused extensive damage, resulting in widespread power cuts across the region.\nCompounding the crisis, the Bureau of Meteorology predicts a heatwave across northern Australia.\nWinton in Western Queensland anticipates temperatures of 43 degrees Celsius on Friday. Similarly, Gympie in the storm-hit south-east expects 37 degrees, while Brisbane is set to experience 36 degrees.\nIn the Northern Territory, Katherine and Tennant Creek are bracing for temperatures around 40 degrees and 43 degrees respectively. Meanwhile, Marble Bar in Western Australia's Pilbara region can expect to reach a scorching 49 degrees.\nFatalities\nThe severe weather has had tragic consequences, with seven fatalities in Queensland, including victims caught in stormwater drains, while in Victoria there have been two deaths from falling branches and one due to flash flooding.\nSenator Murray Watt, Federal Disaster and Emergency Management Minister, urged residents to look after vulnerable community members, suggesting the use of public spaces like libraries and pools to stay cool.\nMore than 120,000 homes and businesses have been affected by the power outages caused by extreme rain, lightning, and wind.\nQueensland Energy Minister Mick de Brenni reported that 63% of customers affected since the storms began have had their power restored, with efforts underway to increase this to 80% by Saturday. But more than 43,000 people remained without power as of Thursday afternoon.\nHealth Minister Shannon Fentiman expressed concern over the health risks posed by the high temperatures, advising residents to use cold towels and seek air-conditioned public spaces to avoid heat stress.\nIn response to the crisis, the Gold Coast council has announced that its swimming pools will be open and free to the public on Friday, offering some respite from the extreme heat.\nRead more on Proactive Investors AU\nDisclaimer\nProlonged power outages in South-East Queensland amid extreme weather conditions",

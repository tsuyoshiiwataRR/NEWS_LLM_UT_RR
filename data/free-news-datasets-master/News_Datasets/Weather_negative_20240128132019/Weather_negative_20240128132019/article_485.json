    "text": "ROADS in Worcestershire are closed due to flooding this morning, (December 29). In the aftermath of the heavy rain from Storm Gerrit some roads have seen standing water in places while others have had to be closed completely as it is impossible to navigate through. Worcestershire Highways list on the county website currently includes: - Eckington Bridge - Eckington Road, Birlingham closed between New Barn Road Birlingham and New Road Junction Eckington - Follow Black Hollow Square Diversion - Severn Side South, Bewdley, U10500 closed - Mill Lane, Hanley Castle - New Street, Upton Upon Severn closed Between The Old Fire Station to The Fruit Farm U61204 junction Stocks Lane, Newlands and Bransford Court Lane, Bransford, which were listed as being closed on the county council website on Thursday are currently not featured on the list. Worcestershire Highways also tweeted a picture of Sherridge Road, between Smith End Green and Leigh Sinton, last night which showed flooding there - but that road is also not on the current list.

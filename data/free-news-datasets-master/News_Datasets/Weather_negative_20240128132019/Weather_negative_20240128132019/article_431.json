    "text": "THIS PAGE WILL BE UPDATED WITH THE LATEST NEWS UPDATE: 8:30 AM PMOI Resistance Units Show Support for Maryam Rajavi’s 10-Point Plan for Iran While Iran’s regime has been on an expansive campaign to discredit and disparage the Iranian Resistance and the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK), [Resistance Units](https://english.mojahedin.org/article/pmoi-resistance-units-the-vanguards-of-freedom-in-iran/) across Iran have been countering the regime’s efforts by showing their full support for the [10-point plan](https://www.maryam-rajavi.com/en/viewpoints/plan-for-future-of-iran/) of Maryam Rajavi, the president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). The 10-point plan is the platform of the Iranian Resistance for the establishment of a democratic republic of Iran that rejects both the religious dictatorship of the mullahs and the tyrannical monarchy of the shah. It represents the desires of the Iranian people, who have been chanting, “Death to the oppressor, be it the shah or the mullahs!” across Iran. Political Prisoners Challenge Judge’s Visit at Evin Prison Political prisoners held in the women’s ward of [Evin Prison](https://women.ncr-iran.org/2021/12/09/the-conditions-of-women-iran-prisons/) expressed anger during the visit of [Judge Iman Afshari](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86_%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C) on December 27, 2023. Many of these detainees had been sentenced by Judge Afshari, leading to heightened tensions during his presence. The authorities at Evin Prison responded to the protests by punishing the demonstrators. Those who raised their voices against Judge Afshari were either restricted from making phone calls or faced threats of isolation as a repercussion for their protest. The women who protested Afshari’s visit voiced their frustration over their indefinite imprisonment without a clear resolution to their cases. Notable among the dissenters were [Forough Taghipour](https://women.ncr-iran.org/2023/12/12/three-female-political-prisoners/), [Arghavan Fallahi](https://women.ncr-iran.org/2023/05/31/arghavan-fallahi/), and Shiva Esmaili. Who Was Razi Mousavi, the IRGC Commander Killed in Syria On December 26, 2023, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) of the Iranian regime announced the death of Razi Mousavi, a prominent figure known as “Seyed Razi” and recognized as the head of the so-called “Resistance Front” in Syria. The news of his demise sparked a flurry of reports, accompanied by photographs that shed light on this previously unknown commander of the IRGC. The IRGC’s announcement regarding Mousavi’s death was brief and lacking in specific details regarding the time and circumstances surrounding the demise of this senior IRGC commander. However, Hossein Akbari, the regime’s ambassador in Syria, disclosed to Iranian state TV that Mousavi had been present at the regime’s embassy in Damascus until 2:00 p.m. on Monday. After completing his duties, he departed for his residence and was struck by three Israeli rockets at 4:10 p.m. on the same day in the Zainabiya region, located in the suburbs of Damascus.

IRGC Commander Walks Back Comments Claiming Oct 7 Attacks Were Retaliation to Killing of Qassem Soleimani In a statement released on its Telegram channels, Hamas denied the remarks of Ramazan Sharif, the spokesperson for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( [IRGC](https://iranfocus.com/terrorism/49443-new-us-sanctions-target-irans-irgc-intelligence-organization-for-hostage-taking/)), regarding the “Al-Aqsa Storm,” the name Hamas uses to refer to the October 7 attack on southern Israel. Ramazan Sharif, the spokesperson for the IRGC, stated in a press conference in Tehran on December 27 that the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 was “one of the retaliations of the resistance axis for the killing of Qasem Soleimani,” in which Israeli forces “lost over 200 commanders and suffered more than 1,500 casualties.” Qassem Soleiman was the notorious commander of the IRGC Quds Force, who was killed in a US drone strike near Baghdad, Iraq, in September 2020. Soleimani was killed along with Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the commander of the Iran-backed Hashd al-Shabi terrorist militia group in Iraq.

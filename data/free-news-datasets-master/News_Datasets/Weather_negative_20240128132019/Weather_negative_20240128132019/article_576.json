    "text": "A surge in flu patients in England shows no sign of slowing, with health leaders warning of a “storm” of pressures facing hospitals in the new year including a six-day strike by junior doctors.\nAn average of 942 people were in hospital each day last week with flu, including 48 people in critical care beds, NHS data shows.\nThe total is up nearly a half (45%) from 648 in the previous week, and more than double the 402 recorded a fortnight earlier.\nIt is the highest figure so far this winter, but is below the equivalent total for this point last year – 3,746 – when the UK was in the middle of its worst flu season for a decade.\n(PA Graphics) The number of patients testing positive for Covid-19 is also continuing to rise, with an average of 3,631 each day in the week to December 24, up 12% from the previous week and 57% higher than the equivalent week in November.\nThe figures come amid another spell of industrial action by junior doctors in England, with a 72-hour strike from December 20 to 23 due to be followed by a six-day strike in early January.\nMore than 86,000 hospital appointments and operations had to be rescheduled because of last week’s action, which is part of a long-running dispute over pay.\n(PA Graphics) Professor Sir Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, warned the impact of next week’s six-day strike is “likely to be much more severe”, coming at a time when hospitals “usually experience the most pressure with high demand and higher levels of virus admissions”.\nHe added that the latest data for patients in hospital with winter viruses shows “the storm of pressure” the NHS is facing, with “huge rises in flu patients over the last few weeks and many more norovirus cases than we saw last winter, as well as the ongoing impact of Covid – all on top of the added pressure of industrial action.\n“As always, I would urge the public to get their Covid and flu vaccines if they are eligible, make sure you order repeat prescriptions in advance of the upcoming bank holiday weekend and, as ever, only use 999 or A&E in an emergency, with 111 online the best place to go for any other conditions.”",

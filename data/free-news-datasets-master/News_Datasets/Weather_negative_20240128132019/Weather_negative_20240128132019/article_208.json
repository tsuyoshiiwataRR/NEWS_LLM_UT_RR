    "text": "[Sports](https://newsday.co.tt/category/sports) U23 Cup matches abandoned because of rain [Jonathan Ramnanansingh](https://newsday.co.tt/reporter/jonathan_ramnanansingh) Both opening fixtures of the TT Cricket Boardâ€™s Under-23 Cup were abandoned on Thursday because of rain. Only one team was allowed to bat before the heavens opened for over an hour, at both venues, and forced the match to be called off. At the National Cricket Centre (NCC) in Couva, South/South East Hummingbirds battled East/North East Scarlet Ibis U23s. Batting first, the south team looked good and were guided to 218/5 after 39 overs, before the stoppage. Antonio Gomez (93 not out) was on course for a century while his opening partner Kyle Roopchand (67) paired to pile on 146 for the first wicket. Damion Joachim finished on an unbeaten 21 before the covers were pulled on. For the combined east team, Vasant Singh was their best bowler, claiming 4/50 from ten overs. In the other contest between Central/South West Flamingoes and North/Tobago Masqueraders at Inshan Ali Park in Preysal, the former got to 201/8 from 48.1 overs. Kyle Kissoondath led the charge with the bat as he scored 60. Justin Manick scored 43 while Rajeev Ramnath chipped in with 37. Topping the bowling for North Tobago Masqueraders was Chadian Raymond, who snagged 3/41 while Eric Garcia picked up 2/39. Round two bowls off on Wednesday with East/North East Scarlet Ibis up against North/Tobago Masqueraders at NCC and South/South East Hummingbrids versus Central/South West Flamingoes at Inshan Ali Park. Both matches bowl off from 9:30am.",

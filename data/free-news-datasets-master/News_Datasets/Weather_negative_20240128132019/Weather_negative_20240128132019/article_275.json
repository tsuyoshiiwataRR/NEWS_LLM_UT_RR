    "text": "29 Dec 2023 | 04:00 AM UTC Canada: Adverse winter weather forecast across parts of southeastern Canada through at least early Dec. 30 Severe weather forecast across parts of southeastern Canada through early Dec. 30. Hazardous travel conditions likely. Adverse winter weather is forecast over parts of southeastern Canada through at least early Dec. 30. Hazardous travel conditions are likely due to slippery roads and reduced visibility. As of late Dec. 28, Environment Canada has issued red freezing rain warnings (the highest level on a three-tier scale) across parts of southern New Brunswick, northern Nova Scotia, and far southern Quebec. Red smog warnings are in place for Saguenay in Quebec Province. Special weather statements for a wintry mix of snow and ice pellets are in effect for the Burin and Avalon peninsulas in Newfoundland Island and for freezing rain in Inverness and Victoria counties in northern Nova Scotia Province. Fog advisories are in place for most of the rest of the affected area. Officials could update and extend the coverage of weather alerts over the coming hours. Snow accumulations are likely across the parts of the affected area. Lesser snowfall totals are possible where sleet and freezing rain mix with snow. In addition to the heavy snow, strong wind gusts could lead to periods of blowing and drifting snow. Blizzard conditions are possible. Sporadic power outages may occur throughout the affected area. The inclement weather will likely cause widespread ground and air transport disruptions across the affected areas. Traffic and commercial trucking delays are probable along regional highways. Dangerous and challenging driving conditions are likely, especially on secondary and rural roads, as maintenance crews prioritize clearing major routes. Authorities will likely close stretches of highways if driving conditions become too hazardous. Gusty winds will threaten to topple high-profile vehicles throughout the affected areas. Mountain passes and tunnels will probably be closed as a precaution during periods of intense snowfall. The disruptive weather will likely cause delays and cancellations at airports in the affected regions. Heavy, wet snow and strong winds could bring down power lines and trees with foliage. Monitor local media for updated emergency and weather information. Seek updated information on weather and road conditions before driving or routing shipments through areas where severe weather is forecast. Plan accordingly for potential delivery delays if routing shipments by truck through the affected area. Do not attempt to drive through flooded areas. Confirm flights. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

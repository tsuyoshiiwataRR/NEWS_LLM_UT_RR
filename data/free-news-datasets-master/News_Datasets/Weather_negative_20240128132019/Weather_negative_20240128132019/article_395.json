    "text": "A driver had to be rescued from a submerged car as Storm Gerrit battered Dumfries and Galloway on Wednesday.\nThe drama unfolded on the old military road from Lochfoot to Dumfries.\nPower was cut to dozens of homes as the storm raged.\nAnd transport was hit badly with flooding and falling trees blocking roads, while train services were disrupted. Dozens of homes were affected by power cuts and persistent heavy rain which also caused some localised flooding across the region, including the Whitesands in Dumfries.\nDumfries and Galloway Council took the step of posting a Virtual Operations Support Team (VOST) warning list of live incidents on roads and of flooding to keep the public informed.\nTrains were cancelled on Wednesday from Glasgow to Dumfries and yesterday there were no early services from Kilmarnock to Dumfries.\nAnd a spokesperson for SP Energy Networks said on Wednesday: “We’re experiencing some storm-related incidents affecting our network in Borgue, Whithorn and Castle Kennedy, with around 50 customers currently off supply.\nA message posted on Facebook on Wednesday told how the Boathouse cafe and restaurant at Glencaple near Dumfries would be shut due to flooded access roads.\nAnd another social media post on Wednesday told how a driver had to be rescued on the old military road.\nMeanwhile, police said yesterday that cars were trapped on Glencaple Road due to warning signs being ignored.\nThe Met Office said that 20 to 45mm of rain was expected in 24 hours until yesterday in Scotland along with winds reaching 60 to 70mph in some areas.\nAnd according to meteorologist Geoff Monk of Laurieston, the storm was much more remarkable for rain amounts than wind speeds.\n Speaking at 1pm on Wednesday, he said: “From 2am this morning we have had 50mm – it was absolutely throwing it down. And west of Glasgow they had 35mm in six hours.\n“It’s a really wet system but it is pushing north quite quickly. We have had the worst but that’s not to say it’s finished.”",

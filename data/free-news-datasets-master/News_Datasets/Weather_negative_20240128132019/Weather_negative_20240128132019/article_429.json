    "text": "UK snow alert: Storm Henk threatens to smash Britain in 24 hours with gales, rain and EIGHT inches of snow\nWX Charts\nBy\n<a href=\"https://www.gbnews.com/authors/nathan-rao\">Nathan Rao\n</a>\nPublished: 29/12/2023- 08:55\nStorm Henk – the eighth storm of the season– threatens to smash Britain this weekend as New Year is threatened by nationwide gales, rain and up to eight inches of snow.\nThe entire country is on alert for three days of weather hell as the gates to the Atlantic swing open to a barrage of cyclonic low-pressure systems.\nA large storm system due to smash into Britain tomorrow is likely to be named ‘Storm Henk’ by Met Eireann, according to the UK Met Office.\nVolatile weather will maul the UK through the end of the year and into the start of 2024.\nUK snow forecast: Bringing rain and snow to the UK\nWX Charts\nMet Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said: “The weather looks like it will be unsettled with further strong winds and heavy rain as we go through the last weekend of 2023.\n“A deep area of low pressure is set to push its way in from the west, this low could be named Storm Henk by the Irish Met Service as it could be across the republic of Ireland where we see the strongest winds.\n“Nonetheless, Saturday is going to turn wet and windy across the UK, a band of intense rain is going to push its way east and north-eastwards as we go through the day bringing the risk of gales or severe gales in exposed spots.”\nRegions hit by Storm Gerrit will be back in the firing line with ‘significant snow’ forecast in Scotland.\nUp to eight inches could bury hilly regions, Mr Burkill said, although a winter blanket could also settle to lower ground.\nHolidaymakers are warned to take extra care and prepare for disruption as severe weather continues to hammer the UK.\nStorm Henk will bring heavy rain across the UK\nWX Charts\nMr Burkill said: ““We are likely to see travel disruption because of the wind the rain and the snow, like we have seen over some recent days.\n“Sunday, the more persistent heavy rain will clear to the east, but still under the influence of this deep area of low pressure, so will still be blustery and a showery day.\n“Plenty of showers feeding in on the west, north-westerly winds, and it will be the west where we see the most frequent showers.”\nTemperatures over the next couple of days could touch double figures in the south, although brisk winds will make it feel bitterly cold.\nThe weather on New Year’s Eve will settle towards, midnight, although temperatures are expected to plunge to freezing.\nMORE WEATHER\nUK snow forecast: New weather map shows heavy blanket over whole country with Sudden Stratospheric Warming 'increasingly likely'\nThe foul forecast comes as Britain reels from Storm Gerrit which hit at the start of the week unleashing heavy snow, torrential rain and wind.\nThe Met Office confirmed an unusually powerful ‘supercell’ thunderstorm in Greater Manchester had whipped up a tornado strong enough to rip the roof off a building.\nSupercell thunderstorms form when a region of spiralling ‘wind shear’ is picked up into the updraft of a strong storm to create a churning whirlwind.\nVolatile weather is forecast to persist through the start of 2024, with the risk of snow to spread southwards.\nThe foul forecast comes as Britain reels from Storm Gerrit\nWX Charts\nJim Dale, social commentator and meteorologist for British Weather Services, said: “The jet stream is going to be drawing in more unsettled weather patterns in through the rest of the week, and if the Polar front sinks southwards, then there could be more of the wintry stuff coming with it, but this is something we are watching.\n“Between now and New Year, we will see more low pressure coming in off the Atlantic, bringing a generally unsettled picture.”",

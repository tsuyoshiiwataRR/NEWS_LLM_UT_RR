The Silverado smashed into a Honda Odyssey minivan in a head-on collision, according to a statement posted by the Johnson County Sheriff's Office on its official The devastating car crash resulted in \"heavy damage\" to both vehicles, just west of Cleburne, approximately 30 miles south of Fort Worth, Texas. The highway was closed for hours as investigators processed the crash site. The driver and passenger of the Chevy pickup truck — both 17-year-olds from Glen Rose — were traveling the wrong way on the highway and experienced injuries from the collision. The teenagers were transported to Fort Worth hospitals in critical condition. However, the people in the minivan suffered horrific fates in the deadly car accident . The Texas Department of Public Safety identified the six people traveling in the Odyssey minivan who perished in the car collision: 28-year-old driver Rushil Barri, 36-year-old Naveena Potabathula, 64-year-old Nageswararao Ponnada, 60-year-old Sitamahalakshmi Ponnada, 10-year-old Krithik Potabathula, and 9-year-old Nishidha Potabathula.

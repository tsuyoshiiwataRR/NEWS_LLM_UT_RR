The situation remains tense, the DWD fears further rain. The news ticker.\nMunich/Dresden – On Friday, the situation in numerous flood areas in Germany remains threatening. The situation could deteriorate further, with the German Weather Service predicting some heavy rainfall. The situation continues to be particularly tense in Lower Saxony. There, emergency services now even have to rescue animals from the Serengeti Park. Fire brigades are also in continuous operation in many places in eastern Germany.\nThe rainy weather that has now been announced could significantly exacerbate the situation in the affected areas. In the reservoirs of the Bergisches Land and the Siegerland in North Rhine-Westphalia as well as the Harz Mountains, continuous rain must be expected from Friday morning until the night to Saturday. Up to 40 liters per square meter could fall within 24 hours.\nLower Saxony continues to be severely affected by floods – evacuations prepared In Lower Saxony, areas along the rivers Aller, Leine and Weser in the southern and central parts of the state are affected. There, the situation worsened further on Thursday. The dikes were no longer able to withstand the masses of water everywhere. Thousands of relief workers are deployed across the country. Evacuations were prepared in some places. In the municipality of Langlingen in the district of Celle, about 120 people left their houses and apartments as a precaution on Friday night. On Friday morning, the state government wants to give an update on the flood situation at a press conference.\nPrime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) said on Thursday that there had never been a flood of this magnitude before. \"Experts have long warned that the increasing frequency of weather extremes is linked to climate change,\" he said. According to the Ministry of the Interior, a so-called extraordinary event was detected in six districts as well as the city of Oldenburg. With this measure, for example, counties can more easily access auxiliary staff.\nFlood situation is also causing problems in Bremen – numerous residents have left their homes There is also no all-clear yet around Bremen. According to the authorities on Thursday evening, numerous houses along the Wümme in the Katrepel area are surrounded by water and without electricity. Most of the residents have left this area. In the district of Timmersloh, the water is standing on the dikes. Roads and fields are flooded. According to the information provided by the Interior Ministry, measures to secure the dike have already had to be carried out several times.\nFlood situation: No all-clear yet in Dresden either On the Elbe in Dresden, rising water levels are expected. Early Thursday afternoon, 5.92 meters were measured. This was still just below the six-metre mark from which the second-highest alert level 3 would apply. The state flood control center expected this limit to be exceeded on Friday morning - but only very slightly with a maximum of 6.01 meters. A normal water level of 2.00 meters in the Elbe in the state capital is normal.\nMy news Discharged water from reservoir threatens places in Thuringia\nLake in Baden-Württemberg is the largest in the country – it is often overlookedread\nThe oldest butcher's shop in Germany comes from Baden-Württemberg read\nThief fills 189 liters in canister reading\nClimate glue makes Lufthansa poisoned offer after claim for damages - \"Hand on it\"Read \"Hand on it\"\nThese outlet centers in Baden-Wurttemberg areRead more\nThe hydrologists expected a decrease in the Elbe flood water from Friday, as a spokesman for the State Office for the Environment, Agriculture and Geology said. Only locally light rain is expected, in the Czech catchment area of the Elbe neither precipitation nor snowmelt until Friday.\nDownstream in Magdeburg and Schönebeck in Saxony-Anhalt, the State Agency for Flood Protection and Water Management opened the Pretzien weir on Thursday. This means that about a third of the Elbe's water is channelled past the two cities through a flood channel and across meadows and fields before flowing back into the Elbe.\nEmergency services drain water from Kelbra dam In the north of Thuringia, the focus is on the Kelbra dam, from which water has been drained. In the village of Mönchpfiffel-Nikolausrieth, there was therefore a threat that about 30 houses would be flooded, as a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior announced on Thursday. Emergency services had set up 6000,<> sandbags on the riverbank to prevent this. According to the information, the water was about ten centimeters below the edge of the bank.",

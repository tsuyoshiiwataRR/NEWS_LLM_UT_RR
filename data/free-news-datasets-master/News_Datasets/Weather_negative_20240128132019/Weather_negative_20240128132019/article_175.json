    "text": "According to the National Weather Service, a point four miles northwest of Grand Lake hit a temperature of negative 19 degrees Fahrenheit last night, which was the lowest official temperature recorded during the past 24 hours in the lower 48 states of America. The temperature of negative 19 was a full 100 degrees lower than a temperature of 81 degrees that was recorded on Wednesday near Ochopee, Florida. That being said, some estimates point to other parts of Colorado reaching temperatures even lower than that. The National Weather Service noted that the Hebron area may have reached an estimated -27 degrees via a CoAgMet data source. Several other places in the valleys of Middle and North Park also reached a similar temperature. The unique topography of Colorado can be a contributing factor when it comes to temperatures reaching an extreme cold, as cold air can get trapped in mountain valleys. The San Luis Valley is another part of the state where this effect is commonly seen during winter months.",

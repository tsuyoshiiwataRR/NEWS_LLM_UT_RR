Meanwhile, those who have earned a direct entry to the main draw have started their on-court preparations.\nOn Friday, December 29, the likes of Aryna Sabalenka, Daria Kasatkina and Sloane Stephens took the practice court during the day session. They shared glimpses of their training while also highlighting that they were grappling with extreme heat .\nSabalenka, the top seed at the WTA 500 Brisbane International, revealed the temperature during her practice to be 37 degrees Celsius (approximately 99 Fahrenheit). 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens and World No. 27 Anastasia Potapova, too, accorded with the World No. 2.\nMeanwhile, for former World No. 8 Daria Kasatkina, former World No. 1 Karolina Pliskova, and 2022 French Open semifinalist Martina Trevisan, the mercury nudged 38 degrees Celsius (over 100 Fahrenheit).\nKasatkina also showed her sunburned face to her fans on social media.\nAryna Sabalenka, Daria Kasatkina and Sloane Stephens on Instagram Other tennis players on Instagram It is worth noting that the Australian Bureau of Meteorology had issued a ‘Severe Heatwave Warning’ for Brisbane on December 27, stating that the extreme conditions were expected to last through December 29.\nThis isn’t the first time that the tennis players have had to bear the brunt of the summer Down Under.

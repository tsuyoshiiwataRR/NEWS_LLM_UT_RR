    "text": "On Air Now [ The Radio X Indie Night with Sarah Gosling ](/radio/shows-presenters/sarah-gosling/) 7pm - 11pm 29 December 2023, 15:08 | Updated: 29 December 2023, 18:26 Britons are being urged to brace for a further onslaught of wild weather following the devastation of Storm Gerrit. Gusts of up to 75mph could hit parts of the south of England and Wales on Saturday, the Met Office has warned. A yellow weather alert for wind has been issued for parts of the South East, South West, East Anglia and Wales from 11am on Saturday until 3am on New Year's Eve. A separate yellow warning for rain has been issued across part of Wales between 10am and 6pm on Saturday. A yellow rain warning has also been placed across most of Northern Ireland from 4am until 11am on Saturday, with up to 25mm of rain expected in just a few hours. In Scotland, both snow and rain are expected to batter most of the country between 8am and midnight on Saturday. UK weather: The latest Sky News forecast The Met Office is warning the extreme weather across the UK could lead to flooding and transport disruption. ScotRail, LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway are among the train companies to have told passengers they should check before travelling in the coming days. The fresh warnings come on the heels of Storm Gerrit. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said it had restored power to almost 48,000 homes, with bosses confident the final 250 properties would be reconnected on Friday. In Wales, 36,000 properties were left without power after lightning struck in Ceredigion. Elsewhere, three men died after their 4x4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale in North Yorkshire. The storm is also still being felt in northern England and Wales. Stalybridge, Tameside, and Carrbrook in Greater Manchester are in a \"recovery phase\", local authorities have said, after they were hit by a rare tornado that toppled trees and damaged homes. The freak whirlwind was thought to have been caused by a supercell thunderstorm, and residents said it had left some homes looking like \"an absolute disaster\".

He said: \"As we look towards the end of the day on New Year's Eve, and the blustery showery theme does continue, some of those showers should start to ease as we head towards midnight. \"So, perhaps a bit more drier weather around, some clearer skies, but do watch out for those showers. \"And you will also want to wrap up quite warm because although it hasn't been particularly chilly recently, when you factor in those strong blustery winds, it's going to feel close to freezing for many places. \"So, definitely a chilly feel to things as the clock strikes midnight.\" (c) Sky News 2023: Fresh yellow weather warnings for rain, wind and snow across parts of the UK",

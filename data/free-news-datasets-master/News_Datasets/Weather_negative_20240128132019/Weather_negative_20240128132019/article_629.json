    "text": "2023 is set to be the hottest year on record. With further warming expected by 2024, is Europe prepared for what lies ahead?\nAdvertisement\n2023 is set to be the hottest year ever recorded.\ndata Issued The EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) revealed earlier this month that every month from June to November broke global heat records.\nUsing physical evidence such as polar ice and tree rings to reconstruct temperature records, scientists have also shown that 2023 is likely to be the hottest in 125,000 years.\nIf burning greenhouse gases fossil fuel As the atmosphere continues to build, C3S scientists warn temperatures will continue to rise – along with the risk of deadly heatwaves and drought.\nMany cities vulnerable to extreme heatwaves have developed emergency response plans to protect the public.\nBut experts warn these steps may not be enough in a world that continues to break heat records and deepen inequalities.\n“I don't know a single one City It's really preparing for the worst-case scenario that some climate scientists fear,” says Eric Klinenberg, a professor of social sciences at New York University who has written a book about deadly US heatwaves.\nSummer preparedness has generally improved over the years as forecasts have become more accurate. Meteorologists, journalists, and government officials have also begun to focus on promoting the coming hazard,\nBut what works in one city may not be as effective in another.\nHow is Europe preparing for an extremely hot future?\nAcross Europe, cities and countries have adopted measures to alert and protect the public during extreme weather,\nFrance The Heat Watch warning system was launched after a prolonged heatwave in 2003 was estimated to have killed 15,000 people – many of them elderly people living in city apartments and houses without air conditioning.\nThe system involves public announcements urging people to drink water. earlier this year, Germany Launched a new campaign against heatwave deaths and said it was inspired by France's experience.\nIn Paris, fear of 50°C future French capital has been inspired to invest Green area, The city's iconic zinc roofs may need to be replaced with less heat absorbent materials.\nAnother simple initiative has been launched barcelonaSpain: Painting roofs white to reflect the shining sun.\nBuildings are also being affected by the weather. In londonFor example, in the UK, prolonged drought and heat is causing historic buildings to crack and lean, highlighting the need for modernization that takes extreme temperatures into account.\nAs temperatures rise, work hours may need to be adjusted to protect workers from lethal temperatures. spain Steps have already been taken to ban outdoor work during extreme heat.\nHow do other countries protect their citizens from extreme heat?\nIn IndiaIn 2010, a powerful heat wave with temperatures exceeding 48 degrees Celsius killed more than 1,300 people in the city of Ahmedabad. City officials now have a heat action plan to raise awareness among the local population and health care workers.\nAfter a week-long heat wave in Chicago in 1995, in which temperatures reached 41 °C and killed more than 700 people, the US city developed emergency heat response plans. These include a massive push alert Notify the public through messages and emails and then connect the most vulnerable people with the support they may need.\nAdvertisement\nUniversity of Arizona assistant professor Ladd Keith cites Baltimore's Code Red Extreme Heat Alert As an example of a well-designed warning system. When the forecast calls for a heat index of 40.5°C or higher, alerts are triggered and things like more social services are triggered in communities most vulnerable to heat risks.\nLike other American cities los angelesMiami and Phoenix now have 'Chief Heat Officers' to coordinate planning and response to dangerous heat.\nBut what works in one city may not be as effective in another.\nHeat waves highlight urban inequalities\nEvery city has its own uniqueness architecturetransportation, layout and injusticeBharat Venkat, an associate professor at UCLA who directs the university's Heat Lab, aims to tackle “thermal disparity.”\nDuring Chicago's deadly looMost of the deaths occurred in poor and majority black neighborhoods, where many elderly or isolated people suffered without proper ventilation or air conditioning. Power cuts from the overstressed grid made it even worse.\nAdvertisement\nKate Moretti, an emergency room physician in Rhode Island, US, says that as the heat increases, more patients come to city hospitals – leading to an increase in diseases that are not obviously heat-related, such as heart attacks, kidney Failure and mental health problems.\n“We've certainly seen that it puts a strain on the system,” Moretti said. Older people, people who work outside, people with disabilities and the homeless make up a large portion of those admissions, she says.\nKlinenberg says that, in the United States, electrical grid Persistent social inequalities coupled with high demand in some sectors could lead to a serious crisis in the coming decades.\nThis is partly because the underlying social problems that make heat events so deadly are worsening. chicago's 1995 deaths Clustered not only in Poor And different neighborhoods, but especially what he calls “bad” neighborhoods, places where it's hard for people to gather together and where social ties have weakened.\nEmpty lots, abandoned restaurants and poorly maintained parks mean people are less likely to get to know each other.\nAdvertisement\nSimilarly, people in Europe also Handicap have been disproportionately affected by the unprecedented heat. That led Human Rights Watch (HRW) last month to urge authorities to provide adequate support to what scientists say is the fastest-warming continent on the planet.\nHow can deaths caused by heat be prevented?\nVenkat believes that cities should address inequality by investing in labor rights, sustainable development and more.\nThis can seem expensive – for example, when a city tries to improve conditions for workers in rundown food trucks, who pays? – But Venkat feels that doing nothing will ultimately cost more.\n“The status quo is really very deep expensive,” he says. “We don't just do the math.”\nIn the US, the federal government has laws in place to protect people from dangerously overheated conditions in cold climates, says Robin Bachin, associate professor of history and founding director of the Office of Civic and Community Engagement at the University of Miami. conditions, but there is nothing similar for cooling.\nAdvertisement\n“There is no need to subsidize landlords for apartments that are not publicly subsidized.” Air Conditioning,” Bachin says. “This is especially incredibly dangerous for our local low-income populations, let alone those who are unhoused or who are outside workers.”\nSome cities across Europe have opened similar public cooling centers in winter hot bank,\nStreet trees and green spaces can also help. recent Research Found that planting more trees in European cities could reduce heat-related deaths by more than a third.",

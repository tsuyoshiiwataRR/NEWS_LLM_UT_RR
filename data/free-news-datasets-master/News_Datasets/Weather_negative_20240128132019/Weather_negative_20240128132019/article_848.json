    "text": "- By [Sahelee Rakshit](/authors/sahelee-rakshit) - Published: Fri, 29 Dec 2023 09:37 PM (IST) - Source:JND Delhi-NCR is expected to see \"dense to very dense fog\" over the next two days, according to the weather department, which issued a \"cold-day\" alert on Friday. A degree or two below the season's average, the national capital's highest temperature on Friday was 19.8 degrees Celsius. Transportation was affected by the heavy fog in the city, but trains and planes are still operating. For the third day, there were delays of 11 trains headed towards Delhi as a result of the fog. \"Fog conditions at IGIA (Indira Gandhi International Airport) improved significantly in the morning, with the lowest visibility at 150 metres in dense fog,\" the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. With a minimum temperature of 10.7 degrees Celsius, it was four degrees warmer than the season's average. According to the IMD, there's a good chance of a \"cold wave\" beginning in specific areas of Delhi during the second week of January.

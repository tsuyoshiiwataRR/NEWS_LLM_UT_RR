    "text": "2023-12-28 18:03:08 As expected, Storm Gerrit, which mainly affected the British Isles during the night from Wednesday to Thursday, also slightly affected the coasts of north-west France. Gusts of 115 km/h were recorded on the island of Ouessant, in the far west of Finistère; according to our brothers and sisters at [West France](https://www.ouest-france.fr/meteo/tempete/tempete-gerrit-apres-le-royaume-uni-des-rafales-a-plus-de-110-km-h-recensees-dans-le-finistere-779ea5ac-a4cb-11ee-9c1f-9c2fef22f9fa). Elsewhere, with the exception of a peak of 104 km/h in the Channel, at Barfleur, the wind nevertheless, as expected, did not exceed the 100 km/h mark in gusts. No more than 92 km/h in Morbihan, in Groix, no more than 92 km/h in Côtes-d’Armor. Further north, in Hauts-de-France, the wind blew up to 98 km/h in Boulogne-sur-Mer, according to [BFMTV](https://www.bfmtv.com/meteo/tempete-gerrit-de-fortes-rafales-encore-attendues-dans-le-nord-de-la-france_AV-202312280065.html). Even though Storm Gerrit is now heading more towards Norway, north-west France may not be quite done with strong winds this week. Nothing very serious, but Météo-France has placed the departments of Nord, Pas-de-Calais and Manche on yellow alert (“be careful”). The southwest wind will remain strong with gusts reaching 60 to 80 km/h on the coast, or even 90 km/h on exposed capes. The weather is expected to continue to be windy until the first days of 2024. Bad weather Overall, this Thursday in France, gray or even rainy weather reigns with some clearings in the northern half, also gray in the southern half. The weather will be gloomy, including in the Mediterranean regions, according to Météo-France. Regions from northern Aquitaine to the North-East will experience light rain. To the rear, from Brittany to the Belgian border, a regime of lagging will take place with alternating clearings and cloudy periods. A few showers will occur mainly near the Channel coast and more showers will affect the Breton tip in the evening. In the South, the day will start gray in places in the South-West and a few banks of fog will be possible in Provence. The sky will remain quite cloudy from the southwest to the center-east but the sun will still manage to make a few appearances. A little snow will fall on the Alps from 1,500 m. Around the Gulf of Lion, the weather will also be gloomy with many clouds which will give a few drops at times. Minimum temperatures will be 0 to 5 degrees from the Massif Central to the Alps, 2 to 6 degrees in the South and in the North-East and 7 to 12 degrees in a North-West quarter. The maximums will be between 7 and 11 degrees in the Grand-Est, 10 to 15 degrees in the rest of the country, up to 16 to 17 degrees in southern Aquitaine and Corsica. #Gusts #kmh #due #storm #Gerrit #Brittany #strong #winds #continue",

    "text": "People in Scotland have been warned that they could face a final bout of [wild weather](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/weather) before the year is out. The Met Office has issued two new weather warnings that could see huge swathes of the country battered by snow and rain in the final weekend of 2023. Forecasters warned that an 'active frontal system' may bring periods of snow across the north of the country, with as much as 10cm falling on higher ground. Motorists travelling across the New Year weekend have warned over potential traffic jams on roads, with the chance of stranded cars and passengers. It comes after Storm Gerrit wreaked havoc on Scotland and much of the UK this week, with thousands left without power and cars stranded on the A90 due to heavy snowfall resulting in a 'major incident' being declared. And it looks like further disruption is on the cards for Saturday, December 30 due to two new alerts for snow and rain are due to come into force. Both warnings are set to begin at 8am, although their impact and end times differ. The first warning, which lasts until 3pm in the afternoon, has been issued due to a period of sleet and snow of up to 5cm that is forecast which will turn into rain, and may cause some flooding and public transport disruption. It covers Dumfries and Galloway, East Lothian, Midlothian, the Borders, East Ayrshire, South Ayrshire and South Lanarkshire. During this time, people in this area should be prepared for public transport journeys taking longer than usual, with some flooding on the roads and disruption to services such as power cuts. The Met Office said: \"A band of rain, with snow on high ground for a time, will extend northeast across southern Scotland on Saturday morning, clearing from the west in the afternoon. Rainfall totals of 15 to 25 mm are expected across the warning area in a few hours, and 30 to 40 mm possible over hills, along with 2-5 cm of snow above 250-300 metres.\" A second warning is also in place which covers more of the country, due to last from 8am until 11.59pm on Saturday, December 31. Rural communities are at risk of being cut off, with the chance of travel delays and stranded vehicles on the roads. Forecasters said: \"Snow accumulations are expected largely above 250-300 metres, where 5 to 10 cm may accumulate. At lower levels mostly rain is expected with 15-25 mm, although some snow accumulations may occur for a time over northwestern areas, with perhaps 1 to 3 cm in places. \"Snow turning to rain in the south early afternoon and melting snow over high ground along with some heavy rain and saturated ground may lead to some flooding of roads and railways. Rain and snow clearing from the south through the afternoon and evening.\" Regions and local authorities affected Central, Tayside & Fife - Angus - Clackmannanshire - Dundee - Fife - Perth and Kinross - Stirling Grampian - Aberdeen - Aberdeenshire - Moray Highlands & Eilean Siar - Eilean Siar - Highland Strathclyde - Argyll and Bute - East Dunbartonshire - Inverclyde - North Ayrshire - Renfrewshire - West Dunbartonshire Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

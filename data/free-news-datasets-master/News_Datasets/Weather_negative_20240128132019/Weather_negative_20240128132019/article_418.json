    "text": "Liverpool will be battered by torrential rain this weekend ahead of New Year's Eve. The Met Office issued a yellow [weather](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/weather) warning for Merseyside earlier this week as [Storm Gerrit](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/what-supercell-thunderstorm-localised-tornado-28356546) swept across the country. While the \"challenging conditions\" brought by the storm have now eased, the region can still expect to see wet and windy weather in the coming days, according to the Met Office. The weather agency said: \"The last few days of 2023 are forecast to be unsettled, with strong winds, rain and even snow featuring in parts of the UK. An area of low pressure which pushes in from the west on Saturday will be the most dominant feature in the forecast leading up to the new year.\" READ MORE: [Man went 'out of his mind' after devastating phone call from his brother](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/man-went-out-mind-after-28357314) READ MORE: [Boxer 'wins most important fight' after being stabbed in chest](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/boxer-wins-most-important-fight-28361081) The latest forecast for Liverpool shows heavy rain to start the day on Saturday, before this changes to overcast by late morning. Winds of up to 35mph are forecast by lunchtime, with the rain returning into the afternoon on Saturday. However, temperatures are expected to remain mild for this time of year, averaging at around 10 degrees. The Met Office said a \"deep area of low pressure\" will move across the country on Saturday. The boundary between the area of low pressure and the relatively colder conditions further north and east could lead to snow across higher ground in the north of England and Scotland. Met Office chief forecaster, Steven Ramsdale, said: “This system is likely to bring a range of weather including hill snow. Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.” Looking further ahead into 2024, there is low forecast confidence. Nick Silkstone is a Met Office Deputy Chief Forecaster. He said: “Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.” [Don't miss the biggest and breaking stories by signing up to the Echo Daily newsletter here](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/?view=Solus&mailingListId=5ec7f1cc-052c-409a-a8f2-739597fa11c9&utm_source=solusarticle)",

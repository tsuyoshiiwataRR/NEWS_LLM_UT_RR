    "text": "Netherlands and Germany erect flood barriers ADVERTISEMENT Flood barriers have been erected this week at numerous locations along the Dutch river Ijssel following an extended period of heavy downpours.\nAccording to authorities, water levels in the river that runs northwards through the Netherlands have risen “very fast”, sometimes at a rate of one centimetre per hour.\nThe elevated water levels have been caused by recent heavy downpours, combined with severe weather in neighbouring Germany that has left soil saturated, making it difficult for water to drain away.\nA barrier near the German city of Magdeburg was opened for the first time in a decade to ease pressure from the Elbe River, while some animals were removed from their enclosures at a safari park in northern Germany.\nBuildings are surrounded by floodwater in the village of Eichen, Germany, Thursday, Dec. 28, 2023.

Alle Rechte vorbehalten Danube reaches highest level since 2013 floods Water levels in Budapest have hit their highest in the last decade.\nLate on Wednesday, the peak level of the Danube that runs through the Hungarian capital was at 6.93 metres.\nCars left on the closed lower embankments of Buda and Pest had to be removed due to rising water levels, the mayor's office said.\nParts of Budapest were flooded in several places.\nHeavy heavy and snow, which then thawed under exceptionally mild weather, aggravated the flooding.\nDanube's highest water level since 2013 floods Budapest Due to rising waters, the removal of cars left on the closed lower embankments of Buda and Pest. Zoltan Balogh/MTI - Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund Lithuania braces itself for heavy rain Anticipating heavy rainfall in the coming days, floodwaters in western Lithuania are expected to rise.\nAlthough water levels have begun to recede in certain areas, a forecast of 15-25 mm of rainfall has created concerns.\nWestern Lithuania, home to the delta of the Baltic country's largest river, the Nemunas, typically experiences flooding in the spring.\nHowever, this winter marks the second instance in two months when natural water levels have reached critical levels.\nShare this article Comments You might also like Severe floods hit Europe inhabitants evacuate their homes on Christmas Day Australia's Queensland state suffers its worst flooding ever ‘Floods have washed away entire villages’: Kenya’s rains made twice as intense by climate change Central Europe Netherlands Hungary Germany Floods ADVERTISEMENT Most read Clean-up begins after Maersk loses shipping containers in North Sea Countries across Europe heighten security levels Seat up, blind open, lights dimmed: Airline safety rules explained Worst is yet to come with floods in Netherlands, Germany and Norway Inside the world’s first reactor that could produce unlimited energy ADVERTISEMENT Top stories Now playing Next Moscow unleashes biggest aerial barrage of war on Ukraine Now playing Next Israel expands air and ground offensive in central Gaza Now playing Next Europe is getting hotter.

    "text": "A deluge of wet and windy weather is set to be unleashed across Ireland, as the New Year’s celebrations get off to a stormy start. Miserable conditions loom as powerful systems from the Atlantic barrel towards Ireland, ready to make landfall and sweep the country in the coming days. Met EIreann has issued multiple weather warnings ahead of a double blast of wind and rain. A Status Yellow rainfall warning is in place until 9pm Friday for Donegal, Leitrim, North Mayo and Sligo. It warns that “heavy rainfall may lead to localised flooding”.

The alert, which is in place from 2am until 11pm on Saturday, states: “Southwest winds will be strong and gusty at times coupled with heavy rain and thundery showers.Potential impacts include surface flooding, wave overtopping, loose debris, objects displaced and difficult travelling conditions.” After that, a third Status Yellow warning for wind has been issued from 11pm Saturday until 5pm Sunday (New Year’s Eve) for Clare, Cork, Kerry and Limerick. The alert reads: “Westerly winds veering northwesterly will be strong and gusty at times. Potential Impacts include loose debris, objects displaced, difficult travelling conditions, waving overtopping.” The weather is expected to continue unsettled with rain or showers most days. Giving the forecast for the final days of 2023, Met Eireann said: “Cloudy periods and some sunny spells Friday along with some scattered showers, some of which will be heavy with hail, especially in the north. Some localised flooding possible in northern counties. Highest temperatures of 5C to 8C in fresh and gusty westerly breezes. “Some clear spells at first tonight with just isolated showers. Lowest temperatures of -1C to 3C with some frost and icy stretches forming with light breezes. However, cloud will build from the southwest, turning milder as the rain follows, extending northeastwards over much of the country by morning, accompanied by fresh to strong and gusty southeasterly winds. There is a chance of transient falls of sleet on the leading edge of the rain. “A wet and windy start to Saturday with widespread rain, heavy or thundery at times with some localised flooding possible. The rain will clear from the west to sunny spells and showers from the western half of the country through the morning, extending to all areas in the afternoon. Some showers will be heavy with a chance of isolated thunderstorms and hail. Highest afternoon temperatures of 5C to 9C, coolest in the northwest. Fresh to strong and gusty southerly winds, with onshore gales, will mean there is a chance of coastal flooding in the south and southwest. “Clear spells and squally showers overnight Saturday, most frequent in the west and southwest. Lowest temperatures of 3 to 6 degrees in fresh to strong and gusty southerly or cyclonic variable winds.” Looking ahead to New Year’s Eve, the national forecaster said: “Breezy or windy with sunny spells and scattered showers and a chance of hail on Sunday. Fresh to strong and gusty westerly or cyclonic variable winds will gradually decrease moderate to fresh and gusty through the day. Highest temperatures of 5C to 8C generally. “Showers will continue overnight, mainly for Atlantic counties with longer spells of rain possible in the northwest. Some frost or ice will form with lowest temperatures of -1C to 3C degrees in mostly moderate westerly winds.” The forecast for New Year’s Day reads: “Sunny spells and scattered showers at first Monday, becoming more isolated through the morning and early afternoon. Cloud will build from the southwest with rain following, extending northeastwards over much of the country by night-time. Highest afternoon temperatures of 5C to 8C in light to moderate southwesterly winds, backing southeasterly and increasing moderate to fresh with the rain. “Outbreaks of rain will clear northwards from most areas overnight Monday, with clear spells and scattered showers following from the west. Lowest temperatures over the northern half of the country of -2C to 0C, milder further south.” Looking further ahead, the meteorological agency said: “Current indications suggest that on Tuesday there will be further showers or showery outbreaks of rain. Highest temperatures of 6C to 9C generally. “The rest of next week looks generally cool and unsettled with rain or showers expected. Highest temperatures generally ranging from 6C to 8C.” Join the Irish Mirror’s breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click [this link](https://chat.whatsapp.com/FYsKkdmyzYm0dTbcSalI9S) to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

NCA NewsWire / Scott Powick Credit: News Corp Australia It comes after powerful storms and heavy rains left more than one 100,000 homes without power, with some 33,500 still in the dark.\nOn Friday, power company Energex released its restoration plan which aimed to have power restored to 90 per cent of homes by December 31.\n“We understand it is difficult to be without power. Our people live and work in these areas and are part of the community,” Energex said.\n“In the hardest-hit areas of Mt Tamborine and Jimboomba, network restoration will take some time.\n“We aim to have a mix of network and generation to support these communities by the evening of 31 December where it is safe to do so, subject to ongoing damage.”\nEnergex said it was continually assessing the damage done to the network but faced “significant challenges” due to amount of damage dealt to low and high voltage systems.\nIn total, more than 40 areas, including Burleigh Heads, were expected to be reconnected on December 30, with a further 35 regions set to be restored on New Year’s Eve.\nWhile NSW avoided much of the worst of the Christmas and Boxing Day holiday storms, Sydney and surrounds are nonetheless set for a sodden start to the New Year.\nThe Harbour City is forecast to reach just 26C over the weekend, with low-level chances for showers and gusty winds over New Year’s Eve and into the early days of 2024.\nCamera Icon\nRevellers celebrating New Year's Eve in Sydney in 2022. NCA NewsWire / Flavio Brancaleone Credit: News Corp Australia In Victoria, where several people were killed after wild weather and floods, temperatures were forecast to reach 21C on Sunday and 25C on Monday in Melbourne, with light winds up to 20km.\nFlood warnings were still in place across the state on Friday, including minor flood warnings for the Avoca, Loddon, and Snowy Rivers.\nAcross the nation, similar inclement and average weather was forecast for the New Year’s holiday weekend.\nIn Adelaide, the mercury was set to reach 26C on New Year’s Eve and 28C on New Year’s Day with clear skies and sunny weather.\nCamera Icon\nAt least 12 fires were burning in WA on Friday, Emergency WA Credit: NCA NewsWire The nation’s capital, Canberra, was forecast to reach temperatures of 22 on New Year’s Eve and 25 the following day with largely cloudy weather.\nOff the mainland, Hobart was forecast to stay steady at 23C, while in the far north Darwin was set to reach 35C with a chance of thunderstorms on New Year’s Eve.\nPerth, where bushfires had ruined homes in recent weeks, was forecast to stay steady over the New Year’s weekend at 30C with cloudy weather.\nNonetheless, the bureau issued fire weather warnings for Swan Island South and North on Friday due to south-easterly winds and warm conditions.\nAcross the state on Friday there were 12 bushfires burning under an advice-level warning, including in the south, centre, and northern regions.\nOriginally published as ‘Very dangerous’ weather on its way: Giant hail and 36C heat to hit one state\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.

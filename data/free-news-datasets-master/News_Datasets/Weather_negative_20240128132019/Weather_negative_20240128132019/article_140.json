    "text": "Dense fog warning issued in Delhi, 4 other north Indian states till December 31\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast dense to very dense fog to continue across north Indian states till December 30. Cold day conditions have also been predicted to remain in parts of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, according to the IMD bulletin.\nThe Met Department stated that fog conditions would begin improving from December 31 morning onwards.\nAmid icy cold conditions, schools remain closed in Gautam Buddh Nagar – consisting of Noida and Greater Noida. The district administration ordered closure of schools for students for December 29 and 30. However, teachers and other staffers would work.\nThe IMD, meanwhile, predicted the minimum temperature to hover around seven to eight degrees Celsius over the next five days. On Thursday, the national capital’s minimum temperature settled at 8.4 degrees Celsius, one notch above the season’s average, while the maximum temperature was recorded at 21.4 degrees Celsius, also one notch above normal.\nVisuals on social media showed people sleeping inside shelter homes in Delhi. A video shared by news agency ANI showed visibility almost completely reduced at Thursday midnight in areas around the Indira Gandhi International Airport.\nThese dense fog conditions have heavily impacted transport services, hitting flights and train operations that have been marred by multiple cancellations and delays.\nMeanwhile, at least six people were killed, and 12 others were injured in two separate road accidents in Uttar Pradesh due to reduced visibility on Thursday, police told news agency PTI.\nIn an advisory for dense fog, the Met department has asked drivers to use fog lights and travellers to stay updated on schedules of airlines, railways and state transport. “Exercise caution while driving or using any mode of transportation,” the IMD said.\nWatch Live TV in English\nWatch Live TV in Hindi",

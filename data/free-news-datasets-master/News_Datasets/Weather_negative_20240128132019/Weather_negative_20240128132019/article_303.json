    "text": "Families in homes hammered by the Christmas storms may have to wait days until their power is restored, with electricity workers and emergency services personnel enduring a heatwave as recovery efforts continue.\nAuthorities on Thursday said they were confident 90 per cent of properties would have electricity restored by New Year’s Eve, however large parts of the Gold Coast and Scenic Rim were predicted not to have power until 6pm on Sunday.\nThe remaining 10 per cent of properties were predominantly in Tamborine Mountain, where about 4,000 people were affected, and Jimboomba.\n“The advice is that those areas aren’t able to have power restored, they’ll need to have a power system rebuilt,” Energy Minister Mick De Brenni said.\n“In the meantime … we’re going to have to generate it locally and piece together our network whilst it’s being rebuilt.”\nAs of 4.30pm on Thursday, 43,151 properties remained without power in south-east Queensland, leaving residents unable to cool their homes or refrigerate their food.\nAffected residents were advised to check the Energex outage finder site for advice on when power was likely to be restored in their area.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology was forecasting Friday maximum temperatures of 37 degrees in Brisbane and Logan, 33 degrees on the Gold Coast, 34 degrees on the Sunshine Coast and 39 degrees in Ipswich.\nThe Christmas storms resulted in the deaths of seven people, including a girl in Rochedale South, three men who were unable to escape a capsizing boat in Moreton Bay, two women swept into floodwater at Gympie, and a Gold Coast woman who died when a tree fell on her car.\nFallen trees brought down powerlines, blocked roads and damaged properties.\nDespite calls for defence personnel to be brought in to assist, Federal Emergency Management Minister Murray Watt said he understood “local resources were adequate”.\nDozens of crews would be returning from the clean-up in Far North Queensland after ex-Tropical Cyclone Jasper, joining State Emergency Service teams on the ground in the south-east.\nAbout 40 people from NSW’s SES had also been deployed to the Gold Coast, Watt said.\nPolice Commissioner Katarina Carroll urged people not to travel to affected areas to take videos or photos of the damage, as this would hinder emergency crews.\nShe said at the height, SES had received 2000 calls for help.\nThe state government on Wednesday also announced disaster payments of $180 a person or up to $900 for a family, for those in affected areas.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology confirmed on Wednesday a tornado had hit parts of the Gold Coast and Scenic Rim on Christmas Day, adding to widespread damage.\nMuch of Queensland is experiencing a heatwave, with conditions in the south-east expected to worsen on Friday before easing over the weekend.\nGet the inside word on the news, sport, food, people and places Brisbane is talking about.

    "text": "Numerous residences remain without power following the havoc unleashed by Storm Gerrit in northern England and Scotland. The tumultuous weather, ranging from heavy snowfall to a destructive tornado, disrupted the journeys of many returning home from Christmas festivities.In Scotland, approximately 450 properties continue to grapple with electricity outages. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) aims to reinstate power to these households by Friday. Meanwhile, welfare vans offering hot food and beverages are available to affected customers.The aftermath of the storm lingers in northern England and Wales. Stalybridge, Tameside, and Carrbrook in Greater Manchester are in a recovery phase after being struck by a rare tornado, resulting in uprooted trees and damaged homes. Residents described the scene as an absolute disaster, attributing the phenomenon to a supercell thunderstorm.Tragically, three men lost their lives when their 4x4 vehicle submerged in the River Esk near Glaisdale. In Wales, lightning in Ceredigion left 36,000 properties without power.The disruption caused by Storm Gerrit persists across transportation systems, with ongoing chaos on roads, railway lines, airports, and ferry services. The Met Office anticipates continued adverse weather conditions, including strong winds, rain, and snow, though no specific warnings are currently in effect.The Environment Agency has issued 33 active flood warnings, particularly for rivers like the Severn and Ouse. Train companies, including ScotRail, LNER, Avanti West Coast, and London Northwestern Railway, advise passengers to check for updates before traveling in the coming days. Despite some lines reopening, services may still face suspension or cancellation due to system faults and damage.Full restoration of the London Euston and Watford Junction lines is not expected until the end of Friday. Welsh train services are likely to be affected until Monday. Ferry services between Dover and France also anticipate ongoing challenges due to wind impacts.",

    "text": "- Regional hospital tour by the Health Minister confirms Labor's mismanagement of hospital expansion program\n- The program's costing is now north of $16 billion from original budget of $9.785 billion\n- Crisafulli Government determined to deliver better healthcare outcomes for Queenslanders\nThe former Labor Government's mismanagement of the Health Budget in a cocoon of chaos and crisis has been exposed during a regional hospital tour by the new Health Minister.\nIt been revealed that the true cost of Labor's hospital expansion program was north of $16 billion instead of the $9.785 billion they claimed.\nContinuing his regional tour in Cairns this morning to meet with front-line workers, Health Minister Tim Nicholls called on the former Labor Government to front-up and explain why they hid the true costs of the hospital projects.\nLabor failed to account for the complexity and needs for of the Cairns community, which means they could not deliver a hospital refurbishment and new surgical centre on time or on budget.\nMinister Nicholls said all Queenslanders have a right to expect excellence in healthcare services no matter where they live.\n\"What is becoming abundantly clear is that the announcements made by the previous Labor Government were like a house of cards that quickly came tumbling down,\" Minister Nicholls said.\n\"Labor were masters of subterfuge, announcing hospital projects but conveniently forgetting to include critical elements required for patient care.\n\"The Crisafulli Government will save these projects from Labor's mismanagement by ending the sweetheart deal with its CFMEU paymasters that drove up costs and delayed vital upgrades across the Queensland hospital expansion program.\n\"Upgrading our hospital is crucial and that's why I'm here today to talk to doctors, nurses and healthcare practitioners about what they need to be able to do their job properly.\n\"Let me be clear â€“ the Crisafulli Government will deliver the hospital expansion program as promised, with final budgets and timelines to be determined during negotiations for construction.\n\"Our focus is ensuring taxpayers' money is spent wisely and delivers better facilities for patients,\" Minister Nicholls said.\n[here](https://www.miragenews.com/fresh-start-for-cairns-hospital-1382998/).",

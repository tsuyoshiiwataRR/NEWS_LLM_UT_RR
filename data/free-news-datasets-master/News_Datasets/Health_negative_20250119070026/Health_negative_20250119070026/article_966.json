More info\nJoin us on WhatsApp After data revealed more than two million households across the UK struggle with damp and mould, home insurance experts at Quotezone.co.uk have warned Brits may unintentionally be worsening the issue with common household chores, which may even be putting their health at risk. Drying laundry indoors increases the amount of moisture released into the air around your home, promoting mould growth.\nPeople who use heated drying racks or lay clothes over their radiators to dry quicker were also warned that although they’re speeding up the drying process, they’re also creating more indoor pollution and can trigger condensation, which also feeds a mould or damp problem. Quotezone CEO Greg Wilson warned: “Hanging damp clothes on air dryers, radiators, or heated drying racks during autumn and winter months may seem like a logical solution, but many are unaware of the hidden dangers.”\nHe particularly warned homes with children, elderly or people with existing respiratory issues as they’re most at risk of experiencing mould-induced health issues. Mould can wreak havoc on a person’s health and mould-related illnesses like lung disease are estimated to cost the NHS £1.4billion every year to treat.\nWhile breathing in mould can cause health issues around the lungs and airway, it can also worsen a myriad of other existing conditions like allergies, eye irritations, asthma and can also impact a person’s mental health. Additionally, Greg pointed out that feeding a mould problem can be more financially costly in the long run than having a tumble dryer when it comes time eradicate the mould or fix any structural issues it has caused.\nThe home insurance expert pointed out: “If people need to make a claim on their home insurance due to mould or damp, the insurer is unlikely to cover them if the property is not well maintained or is damaged due to a lack of care.” He urged people to change how they approach this household chore for the sake of their health.\nAlthough many households may feel they have no other option during the cold and wet winter months, the experts urged people to keep an eye on weather reports and try hang laundry outside whenever they can. They also suggested putting laundry through an extra spin cycle, using dehumidifiers or drying pods and opening windows for proper ventilation if they have to hang their laundry indoors.\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

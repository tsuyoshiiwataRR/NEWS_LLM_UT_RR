    "text": "FOX 2 - It's hard to not overindulge this time of the year - and for the most part that can just lead to a little discomfort, but in some cases, all the treats, along with booze or caffeine, can lead to some real heart issues.\nIt can be easy to overindulge at holiday parties you’re catching up with family and friends, eating all kinds of delicious food, and the alcohol may be flowing freely too.\nDoctor Deborah Plate with Cleveland Clinic explains, it’s best to keep moderation in mind.\n\"We can overindulge with lots of goodies that might be a lot different than what we typically do throughout the year,\" she said. \"So, a lot of times we will take in quite a bit of salt, quite a bit of sugar, and certainly along with that during the holidays can be overindulging with alcohol.\n\"And when all that comes at us, we certainly can, at times, find that perhaps we don't feel good. Some folks might realize that they actually have perhaps racing heart or chest discomfort, shortness of breath.\"\nDoctor Plate says the condition is known as ‘Holiday Heart Syndrome’ and it can be caused by too much alcohol and salty foods. Those with existing heart issues are considered most at risk.\nHowever, anyone can be diagnosed with it. Doctor Plate says if you do start to experience any of the symptoms she mentioned, like a racing heart, chest discomfort, or shortness of breath, you should stop drinking immediately.\nHoliday Heart Syndrome usually resolves on its own but, if symptoms persist, you should go to the emergency department.\n\"Things to think about, or look for, are chest discomfort,\" Plate said. \"I don't always say chest pain because oftentimes it's pressure or discomfort. And so, anything that's different than normal is important. heartburn that does not improve with something over the counter in the way of an antacid needs to be investigated. shortness of breath, it's different than usual.\n\"I often talk to my patients about walking across a flat surface and are you short of breath? We all get a little shorter breath with stairs, but a flat surface shortness of breath concerns me.\"\nPlate says if you do plan to drink alcohol at a holiday party, be sure to pace yourself and switch off with some water.\nYou could also eat less during the day so you can eat more at the party or eat right before so you’re less tempted to overindulge.\nHealth Works Sponsored by Corewell Health",

    "text": "Alvin Kamara's groin injury could cause him to miss rest of 2024 season\nThe [New Orleans Saints](https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/football/nfl/teams/new-orleans-saints/350) have received some tough news regarding their star running back Alvin Kamara. Adam Schefter of ESPN reported that Kamara is still being evaluated, but the groin injury he suffered could be season-ending for the veteran.\n[Nick Underhill of neworleans.football](https://x.com/nick_underhill/status/1869848728196255988) also confirmed this, stating the injury is more significant than initially believed. Kamara is now week-to-week and will likely miss Monday Night Football against the Green Bay Packers.\nUnderhill provided additional context, as well, stating that Kamara \"intends to try and get back before the season is over\" and that despite there being lots of work to do to get back on the field, he \"hasn't thrown in the towel on it even though there are only three games left.\"\nThis provides some insight into the signing of Clyde Edwards-Helaire on Wednesday afternoon, as the Saints are likely preparing to play without Kamara on Monday. They will need the additional depth behind Kendre Miller, Jamaal Williams, and Jordan Mims.\nIf Kamara is able to return, it could be contingent on the Saints' outlook. If they're eliminated after this week, it may be best to rest him and have him ready for the 2025 season instead.",

    "text": "Bengaluru: Vertex Pharmaceuticals said on Thursday its experimental non-opioid drug met the main goal of a mid-stage study but did not show a difference in reducing pain scores versus a placebo, sending its shares down nearly 14% premarket. The study tested pain reduction in patients with a condition caused by a pinched nerve in the spine. It was not designed for comparison between the drug, suzetrigine, and placebo, Vertex said. The condition, lumbosacral radiculopathy, has no specific approved treatments, and is commonly treated by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with surgery being the last resort. The data on the treatment has come after decades of research into non-opioid drugs and multiple trial failures. Vertex theorizes that due to the way the drug works, it will not be as addictive as opioids. Nearly 108,000 people died from drug overdose in the U.S. in 2022 and about 82,000 of those deaths involved opioids, according to government data. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is currently also reviewing the drug's application for the treatment of a separate condition, moderate-to-severe acute pain.

    "text": "Recalls & Warnings\nConsumerLab.com is keeping you informed with current product recalls and warnings.\nPosted December 19, 2024\nForce Forever Joint Pain Supplement Recalled\nOn December 12, 2024, GNMart INC recalled all lots of Force Forever, a supplement promoted for joint pain, because FDA tests found it to contain undeclared diclofenac and dexamethasone.\n(See ConsumerLabâ€™s [Review of Joint Health Supplements](/reviews/review-glucosamine-chondroitin-msm-boswellia-supplements/jointsupplements/) for tests of related products.)\nDiclofenac is a prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can cause serious cardiovascular events such as heart attack or stroke, as well as bleeding, ulceration, and fatal tears of the stomach and intestines. When interacting with other medications, diclofenac can significantly increase the risk for adverse events. Taking multiple products containing NSAIDS increases these risks.\nDexamethasone is a prescription corticosteroid drug that has the potential to cause severe and serious adverse events including adrenal suppression, a disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones, and other adverse events, which can lead to death. Depending on the dose, these adverse events may be severe and even life threatening. Sudden discontinuation of dexamethasone can also cause potentially dangerous withdrawal symptoms.\nRecalled Force Forever (see [product photos](https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/gnmart-inc-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-force-forever-due-undeclared-drug-ingredients#recall-photos)) is packaged in white bottles with a red and blue label, containing 60 tablets. The recall includes all lots with an expiration date of 03/27/2030. The product was distributed nationwide via the internet at gnmart.com.\nGNMart is notifying customers by email and is arranging for the return or replacement of all recalled products. Consumers that have product which is being recalled should stop using and return to place of purchase.\nConsumers should contact their healthcare provider if they have experienced any adverse side effects. Consumers and healthcare providers are also encouraged to report any adverse reactions to the [FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program.](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/)\nFor more information, use the link below.\n[GNMART INC Issues Voluntary Nationwide Recall of Force Forever Due to Undeclared Drug Ingredients Diclofenac and Dexamethasone](https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/gnmart-inc-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-force-forever-due-undeclared-drug-ingredients)\nSee related recalls and warnings:\n[AK Forte Joint Pain Supplement Recalled](/recalls/14865/ak-forte-joint-pain-supplement-recalled/)\n[Prescription Drugs Found in Arthritis, Muscle Pain, and Osteoporosis Supplements](/recalls/14647/prescription-drugs-found-in-arthritis-muscle-pain-and-osteoporosis-supplements/)\n[FDA Warns Consumers Not to Use Ossos-Sans Supplement for Joints](/recalls/14832/fda-warns-consumers-not-to-use-ossos-sans-supplement-for-joints/)\n[Joint Pain Supplements Recalled Due to Undeclared Drug Ingredients](https://www.consumerlab.com/recalls/14789/joint-pain-supplements-recalled-due-to-undeclared-drug-ingredients/)",

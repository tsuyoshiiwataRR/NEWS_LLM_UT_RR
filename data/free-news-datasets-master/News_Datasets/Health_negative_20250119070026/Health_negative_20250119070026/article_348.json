However, there remains work to do,” Tyson Shtykalo, the province’s auditor general, said in the report.\nThe report found that while the provincial health organization has a cybersecurity incident response plan in place, training sessions are not held with all staff members, a plan for communicating with external stakeholders and procedures for responding to ransomware incidents are incomplete, and incident-response tests were not done.\n“Since no tests were performed, the effectiveness of the CSIR plan cannot be evaluated to ensure that Shared Health is prepared to promptly respond to a major cybersecurity event,” the report states.\nThe report, released Thursday, includes four recommendations to improve the incident response plan. Shtykalo said in the report that while the recommendations are directed to Shared Health, all public-sector organizations should bolster their efforts to respond to cybersecurity attacks.\nThe report comes after high-profile local cyberattacks at the University of Winnipeg and Pembina Trails School Division.\nfpcity@freepress.mb.ca\nCybersecurity incident response process at Shared Health\nRelated Articles ‘It’s affected everything’: cyberattack could impact Pembina Trails report cards, exams Pembina Trails School Division confirms cyber attack Additional groups affected by pre-exam cyberattack: U of W U of W dropped ball on cybersecurity: staffer U of W says student, faculty info stolen in cyberattack U of W to undergo campus-wide reboot; forensic analysis into cyberattack promised U of W reschedules exams to mid-April following cyber attack U of W delays exams as it calms down staff, faculty in wake of cyber attack U of W paralyzed by cyber incident Advertisement Advertise With Us\nHistory Updated on Thursday, December 19, 2024 11:33 AM CST: Corrects typo in headline\nUpdated on Thursday, December 19, 2024 12:00 PM CST: Revises lede\nTweet Share Print Email Read Later Report Error Submit a Tip",

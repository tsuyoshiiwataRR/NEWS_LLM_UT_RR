    "text": "Inter advance to the Coppa Italia Quarter Finals, where they will face Lazio. The Nerazzurri won 2-0 at San Siro against Udinese thanks to goals from Arnautovic and Asllani. The Austrian forward and Davide Frattesi shared their thoughts at the end of the game:\n“It was important to win tonight and we are happy to get into the next round. It doesn't matter who scored, winning is the important thing. I have had a difficult time on a private level and my teammates and Coach have always given the push to give everything for Inter. But everyone knows, I love this club. ”\nMarko Arnautovic\n“We did well in gaining points and winning an important match. Our objective is to win against any side, we take to the pitch to go far in every competition. We're never out of energy because the tension of the matches keeps us going, now we are in a fight with all of the other top sides in the league. I think my journey is always in a building phase. I have to improve and play to try and always give everything, the important thing is that there's the desire to improve. ”\nDavide Frattesi",

    "text": "4 hours ago Ex-Valley Processing president admits to selling adulterated juice, including to the National School Lunch Program, per DOJ. Photo by U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of Washington Mary Ann Bliesner, 83, the former president and primary owner of the now-closed Valley Processing Inc., a fruit juice manufacturer in Sunnyside, Washington, pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts under the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of Washington announced today.\nBliesner also admitted to failing to correct VPI’s introduction of adulterated grape juice concentrate into interstate commerce, including product delivered to a customer for use in the National School Lunch Program, the office said.\n“Bliesner and her company, Valley Processing, produced juice in filthy and unsafe conditions, mislabeled that product, and then sold it to the National School Lunch Program that serves low-income schoolchildren,” said U.S. Attorney Vanessa R. Waldref for the Eastern District of Washington.\n“Schoolchildren deserve safe and nutritious food. Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our children.”\nAccording to the department, during a May 2018 U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspection (FDA), VPI employees placed caution tape over the entrance to the room with the vats and told investigators it was unsafe to enter and contained no juice products.\nFDA investigators later discovered the vats and found grape juice concentrate contaminated with bird and rodent feces, fur, insects, decaying animal remains, mold, yeast, and other contaminants, the department said.\nVPI admitted it blended grape juice concentrate that had been stored outside the facility for years and exposed to the elements with newer concentrate. The resulting product was sold to customers as if it were new, the department said.\nEx-Valley Processing president admits to selling adulterated juice, including to the National School Lunch Program, per DOJ. Photo by U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of Washington “Protecting the safety of America’s food supply is essential,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.\n“The Department of Justice will take action whenever appropriate to ensure individuals and companies that produce our food maintain safe facilities and tell the truth to their customers and the FDA.”\n109",

    "text": "Optus has acknowledged and started remediation to 429 vulnerable victims who were taken advantage of by sales representatives engaging in inappropriate sales and debt collection practices.\nIn October ARN reported the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) alleged that Optus had contravened Australian Consumer Law when selling telecommunications goods and services to hundreds of consumers that they often did not want or need, and in some cases then pursuing consumers for debts resulting from these sales.\nAccording to the ACCC, the alleged Optus staff at two Darwin stores and one Mount Isa store, exploited vulnerable consumers, including those living with mental disabilities or cognitive impairments, unemployment, financial dependence, limited English proficiency, low financial literacy, and learning or comprehension difficulties. A significant number of these customers were First Nations Australians from regional, remote and very remote parts of Australia.\nThe telecommunications provider has admitted it fell far short of “meeting the standards our customers deserve and expect in these cases. We need to do better, and we will,” said Optus.\nThe telco stated it was remediating affected customers with refunds, waiving outstanding debts and enabling them to keep devices and is “working hard to fast-track any outstanding remediation as a matter of urgency”, while disciplinary action has been taken, including terminating staff who were determined to be responsible at those stores.\nCEO Stephen Rue stated the telco has launched a new internal review which will include investigating individual cases to ensure that the necessary checks and accountabilities are in place to stop this type of misconduct.\n“Our specialist care team will be boosted with additional resources to provide more support for vulnerable customers, and we are increasing our focus on working with partners, community groups and financial counsellors to improve service standards for customers in need,” said Optus.\nCustomer satisfaction measures have now been incorporated into sales commissions or remuneration in all retail stores, and it was also in the process of incorporating new compliance metrics.\nDuring the last three years, Optus claimed it has also taken steps to “improve vulnerable customer support by introducing a dedicated specialist care team, extra training for frontline staff, tighter and more robust credit checks and new customer advocacy programs”.",

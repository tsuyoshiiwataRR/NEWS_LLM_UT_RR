    "text": "Gov. Gavin Newsom file photo\nWritten by\n[Frank Lopez](https://thebusinessjournal.com/byline/frank-lopez/)\nGov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday proclaimed a state of emergency in response to the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza.\nThe move further enhances the state’s preparedness and accelerates the ongoing cross-agency response following the spread of bird flu in 16 states, Newsom said.\nThe virus has run rampant through Central Valley poultry and dairy facilities. It’s been detected in at least 650 herds in California. Referred to in a recent New York Times article as “Covid for Cows,” bird flu has been confirmed in at least 866 herds in the U.S.\nThere has been no person-to-person spread of bird flu detected in California, according to health officials. Nearly all of the 34 individuals infected to date were exposed to infected poultry or dairy cows.\n“This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak. Building on California’s testing and monitoring system — the largest in the nation — we are committed to further protecting public health, supporting our agriculture industry, and ensuring that Californians have access to accurate, up-to-date information,” Newsom said in a press release.\nOn Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the first severe human case of bird flu in the United States — a patient in Louisiana who was hospitalized.\nAccording to the CDC, there have been a total of 61 reported human cases of bird flu reported in the U.S. since April 2024.\nOn Aug. 30, bird flu was confirmed in a dairy cow in Central California, and the California Department of Public Health immediately activated its Medical Health Coordination Center.\nWhile the investigation into the Louisiana case is ongoing, it been determined that the patient had exposure to sick and dead birds in backyard flocks, the CDC states.\nIn a news release sent out Wednesday, freshman Assemblymember Alexandra Macedo (R-Tulare) said the governor has failed to protect Californians once.\nShe said the price of milk, dairy products and eggs have skyrocketed for consumers because of his inaction.\n“The Newsom Administration failed to enforce and fund basic standards to properly secure our borders at the state’s highways. Had the Newsom administration adequately funded inspection checkpoints for testing verification, vaccination records and branding paperwork – this Bird Flu may have been prevented,” Macedo said.",

    "text": "It is with a heavy heart that I bring the mainstream news from Reuters that Pfizer does not expect the Trump administration to make major changes to vaccine policy next year, even as the president-elect has put forward vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services.\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr. was invited to a dinner party with President-elect Donald Trump last week, where he met with executives from Big Pharma, including Robert Bourla, the CEO of Pfizer, who made $billions under Trump’s first term, by securing from Trump an FDA emergency-use authorization for the first COVID-19 injections for the U.S., along with exclusive distributor rights in Israel for Pfizer’s deadly COVID-19 “vaccine.”\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla told analysts, “I don’t want to speak about the details of what we discussed during that dinner because I want to respect the privacy, but we developed a good relationship with Mr. Kennedy ,” Bourla said during an investor call.\nPfizer’s own study shows their COVID vaccines increase\nyour risk of serious adverse events (up to 71% higher).\nAlso attending the dinner at Trump’s residence in Florida was his Chief of Staff, Susie Wiles, a lformer lobbyist for Pfizer. There is a big stink being made in the media about polio vaccines and not a word about the dangers of Pfizer mRNA vaccines that are doing a world of hurt.\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. Betrays Entire “Health Freedom” Movement\nMany have been hoping that the Kennedy-Trump team would bring some sanity to the FDA and the medical-industrial complex in general. That now seems unlikely as Kennedy gladly dines with one of the greatest terrorists on the planet, Pfizer’s Robert Bourla. One must worry. Are good guys meeting up with the bad guys, or are all the bad guys getting together?\nThere is a despicable playbook for covering up vaccine injuries. Its name is total denial and big-time lies that mainstream doctors and health officials believe in with all their hearts. The worst crime in the history of humanity is unfolding before us, but “ Why do many people fail to see crimes happening right before their eyes ? ” asks John Leake in His essay, ‘Hiding in Plain Sight,’ which implies that “ The best disguise is the truth because no one believes it .” The government and the press for sure do not want you to believe the truth that vaccines are a significant part of the cause of autism.\nTwenty years ago, I saw the Hep-B vaccine given to newborns\nas both dangerous and unnecessary and a hallmark of how\ncruel pediatric medicine could be and would be in the future.\nVaccines place the body under stress and divert the immune response to address the vaccine’s stimulus. Vaccines can make you “become sick” because they weaken the immune system and make you more susceptible to catching the actual infection or having an already existing infection spiral out of control.\nGovernment Health Officials:\nThe True Enemy of Humanity\n“The President is extremely proud, and of course, we are extremely proud, that [Pfizer] basically delivered a vaccine through this landmark golden standard program, the Operation Warp Speed that saved millions of lives,” Bourla said.\nHell comes in many forms, with the worst in medical form. Health officials can get away with anything. There has been a massive censoring action by medical journals and health officials on the unprecedented adverse vaccine data of the COVID-19 vaccines.\nPublic health officials are the tip of the spear for the medical-industrial complex, for big pharma, for medical murder, death, and an unending tide of lies. Government health officials are among the most arrogant and loaded with psychopaths and sociopaths who genuinely believe they are right about everything.\nThe Brownstone Insitute reminded us of the Cutter incident, which was one of the worst pharmaceutical disasters in U.S. history and exposed several thousand children to the live polio virus on vaccination. The NIH Laboratory of Biologics Control, which had certified the Cutter polio vaccine, had received warnings of problems: in 1954, staff member Bernice Eddy had reported to her superiors that some inoculated monkeys had become paralyzed and provided photographs. William Sebrell, the director of NIH, rejected the report.\nSenator McConnell knows nothing about medicine but is one with health officials saying, “Trump nominees should ‘steer clear’ of undermining the polio vaccine.”\nModerna has paused its mRNA RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) vaccine trial for\nchildren after five infants were hospitalized with severe respiratory complications .\nPublic health officials cause an immense amount of deaths, misery, and suffering, but never so much as during the continuing COVID madness. In medical history, we have seen many examples. Still, perhaps the most quantifiable example is Merck’s Vioxx scandal, whereby they hid and suppressed evidence of massive amounts of heart attacks and strokes. One shocking detail about the Vioxx case was when one expert’s testimony in court described the number of deaths from Vioxx as “equivalent to 4 jumbo jetliners crashing every week for 5 years.”\nIt was learned that vaccine champion and Microsoft founder Bill Gates\nrefused to allow his own children to be vaccinated . This admission\ncame from the Gates family’s personal physician in Seattle.\nMany scientific papers with data and analysis that concluded grave harms from the mRNA jabs were submitted and passed peer review. Soon after publication, the editorial team concocted some story of “concerns” with the analysis and retracted it. Many people belong in jail.\nThere are people and countries worldwide fighting against each other when the real enemy is public health officials, medical organizations, and pharmaceutical companies. Instead of fighting Russia, Americans and citizens of the West should be fighting medical and pharmaceutical terrorism. However, this harsh truth does not sink in. People today are captured and propagandized. The mainstream mind does not get it.\nWill They Start to Shoot on Sight?\nIs the widespread fawning over Luigi Mangione, the man charged with the murder of U.S. healthcare boss Brian Thompson, a sign of things to come? A consensus on social media has emerged from ‘progressives’ that Thompson ‘had it coming’ and that his alleged killer can be excused for his good motives. Shock poll: 41 percent of young voters find the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO acceptable .\nTrust in health officials is critical to public health and community well-being, or at least that is what they want us to believe. High trust in health officials can lead to better compliance with health recommendations, such as vaccinations and guidelines during outbreaks. It is all bad news for public health because little trust is left. Trust encourages open dialogue. There is no trust because there is no open dialogue.\nConclusion\nTrusting health officials is an invitation to suffering and death. We are in a terminal phase of trust in health officials and modern medicine . As we have seen with COVID-19 injections, doom is assured for all those still trusting the mainstream medical narrative. Regarding health officials, they can’t understand anything that challenges their narrative because their livelihood relies on them not understanding.",

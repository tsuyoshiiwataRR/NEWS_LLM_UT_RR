    "text": "By Norishka Pachot ,\n4 hours ago\n(COLORADO) — December can be a particularly dangerous time for pets as they run into problems indoors rather than outdoors like in the summer.\nColorado State University Dr. Amanda Cavanaugh, assistant professor and head of the university’s Emergency and Urgent Care Service has seen about everything come through the front doors of the veterinary hospital and is giving pet owners some tips on the best way to keep them safe.\n“During winter, dogs can get bored inside, and around the holidays there are new things coming into the house that can prompt naughty behavior,” Cavanagh said. “It’s good for pet owners to be extra vigilant this time of year.”\nSome top problems Cavanaugh highlights include toxic items, cords, and even automatic food and water dispensers.\nLoose cords such as Christmas lights can entice dogs and cats to chew on them, resulting in an electrocution injury that can be catastrophic. Cavanaugh said people with rabbits or ferrets loose in the house should also look into this potential issue and recommends taping any loose cords onto the floor or running them under carpets.\nAs for those who leave cats at home alone with an automatic food and water dispenser, beware: your kitty is able and can knock over the water bowl which can lead to high sodium levels.\n“Cats can get trapped in a closet or the water bowl can get knocked over,” Cavanagh said. “We’ve had some really sick pets that went without water and had high sodium levels that required a lengthy hospital stay.”\nIf leaving your cat alone, Cavanaugh suggests having someone check on them every 24 hours to make sure they are not trapped or without water.\nAll pets — if left alone at home — should be checked on, and if you are heading out of town, make sure an animal is in the house on the off chance there’s a fire. According to Cavanaugh, fire departments will go to great lengths to save an animal if they know one is inside. You can also put a sign on the front door with the type and amount of animals inside so emergency responders will know to look for one.\nAs for things that are toxic and can harm your pet, Cavanaugh says it is a bad idea to feed dogs and cats any type of table scraps. Eating foods like turkey and ham can cause vomiting, diarrhea, or pancreatitis.\n“My vote is just don’t do it,” Cavanagh said. “Especially during the holidays when everything is buttery and oily and salty and there’s gravy.”\nOther toxic and fatal items around the house include chocolate, raisins, lilies, and Teflon cookware. Holiday plants like poinsettias and mistletoe are also toxic but likely not fatal according to Cavanaugh.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

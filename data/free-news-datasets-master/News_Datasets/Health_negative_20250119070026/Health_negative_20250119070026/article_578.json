    "text": "DES MOINES, Iowa (Gray Media Iowa Capitol Bureau) - An overhaul of the state’s mental health and substance abuse system is slated to happen next summer.\nEarlier this year, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds signed a bill that would merge the state’s 32 separate mental health and substance abuse regions into seven behavioral health districts.\nLeslie Carpenter with Iowa Mental Health Advocacy was excited for the change.\n“The proposal, as I understood it at the time, was that there would be seven behavioral health districts that would provide the administration of both mental illness treatment and substance use treatment in these seven districts with input from people locally within those districts,” she said.\nThat’s not what the state ended up doing. Last week, the state announced it chose a single provider - the Iowa Primary Care Association - to run all seven. And that has Carpenter concerned.\n“If somebody calls from Northwest Iowa, whoever’s answering that phone in Des Moines may not be aware of all of the people and resources that are available in Northwest Iowa,” she said.\nOn a listening session hosted by Iowa HHS Thursday, Sarah Dixon with the Iowa Primary Care Association says managing all seven districts will allow for a singular, centralized administration with staff in each district.\n“These individuals will be tasked with the unique needs of their district, ensuring we’re bringing the right people to the table to complete meaningful district assessment and planning efforts, systems navigation, and community engagement and education,” she said.\nDixon says the ICPA is working to make sure the transition runs smoothly.\n“We are committed to ensuring this transition does not disrupt the care Iowans are receiving today and that our local providers receive the support they need to be successful,” she said.\nCarpenter says she’s worried the state may lose some of its behavioral health staff in the transition. “Even though it hasn’t always run perfectly, the individuals within it are amazing,” she said.\nIowa HHS says it is finalizing the statewide behavioral health system plan. It will allow the public to weigh in on the changes in January before they take effect.\n--\nConner Hendricks covers state government and politics for Gray Media-owned stations in Iowa.

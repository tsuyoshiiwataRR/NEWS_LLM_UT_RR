    "text": "Lisa Schnirring Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Dima Sidelnikov/iStock\nShare Copied to clipboard\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH) said yesterday that tests have confirmed H5 avian flu in two cats that died after drinking recalled raw milk that it is investigating three other possible cases in cats that weren't exposed to raw milk.\nIn other developments, health officials in Wisconsin and Louisiana shared a few more illness details on recently announced suspected and confirmed human cases, respectively, and federal officials confirmed more outbreaks in cows and poultry.\nRaw meat may be culprit in latest cat illnesses The confirmed LA County infections involve indoor cats from the same household, which were initially announced as suspected cases on December 12 . After drinking raw milk from Raw Farm, the cats experienced appetite loss, fever, and neurologic signs. They initially tested positive for influenza A, which officials said is rare in cats. Other pets in the household are under quarantine.\nMeanwhile, officials are investigating possible infections in three other cats from a different household. One tested positive for influenza A, and the others died from presumed influenza A. Confirmation tests are under way.\nThe three cats with suspected infections don't have any known exposure to raw milk, and investigators are examining other potential sources of the virus, including raw meat. People exposed to the three cats are under symptom monitoring and have been offered antiviral prophylaxis.\nBarbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, Med, director of LACDPH, said, \"The risk of H5 bird flu remains low in Los Angeles County, but these confirmed cases of the virus in pet cats are a reminder that consuming raw dairy and meat products can lead to severe illness in cats.\"\nShe urged residents and their pets to avoid raw milk and undercooked meat products, limit exposure to sick and dead animals, report sick and dead birds, and keep pets and poultry away from wild birds.\nMore details on recent human cases In other developments, Wisconsin health officials shared more details about the state's first presumptive positive case, announced yesterday.\nAt a media briefing following the announcement yesterday, Thomas Haupt, MS, respiratory disease epidemiologist with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, said the patient is a woman who worked on a farm and had mild flu symptoms that included sore throat, a slight fever, fatigue, and some eye discharge. She has finished a course of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and is recovering.\nDarlene Konkle, DVM, Wisconsin's state veterinarian, said though the genotype isn't known, the virus that infected the worker is likely a genotype circulating in wild birds, given that Wisconsin doesn't have any outbreaks of the B3.13 virus in dairy cattle.\nRegarding Louisianaâ€™s recently confirmed severe case, BNO News reported yesterday, citing a health department spokeswoman, that the patient is older than 65 years and has underlying medical conditions. The patient remains hospitalized and is in critical condition.\nMore confirmations in dairy cows, poultry The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) today confirmed yet another outbreak in dairy cattle in California. The confirmation lifts the state's total since late August to 650 and the national total to 866 across 16 states.\nIn addition, APHIS confirmed more poultry outbreaks in four states, including a backyard flock in Louisiana's Jefferson Davis Parish in the southwest, marking the state's second such outbreak. Two other confirmations were in backyard flocks North Dakota's Nelson County and Iowa's Monona County.\nMeanwhile, the virus was confirmed at more commercial farms, including layer facilities in Iowa's O'Brien and Sioux counties, a turkey farm in Iowa's Worth County, and a layer pullet farm in California's Merced County.\nIn a related development, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection yesterday reported a second outbreak in poultry, this time in Kenosha County in the southeast corner of the state.\nRelated news Previous Next Avian flu infects 2 more California dairy workers as CDC confirms Wisconsin case Lisa Schnirring Wisconsin reports presumptive avian flu in poultry worker as California declares emergency Lisa Schnirring CDC confirms first severe H5N1 case in US patient Lisa Schnirring Flu surveillance flags probable H5 avian flu case in Delaware Lisa Schnirring Positive avian flu bulk-tank tests prompt another raw-milk recall in California Lisa Schnirring Louisiana reports its first probable human H5N1 case as California logs 2 more Mary Van Beusekom Avian flu suspected in cats that drank raw milk as virus kills animals at Arizona zoo Lisa Schnirring California health officials probe raw milk link in child's flu A infection Lisa Schnirring This week's top reads Avian flu suspected in cats that drank raw milk as virus kills animals at Arizona zoo In other developments, federal and state officials report more detections in dairy cows, poultry, and wild birds.\nLisa Schnirring Cases rise in unexplained DR Congo outbreak amid testing challenges A group of 78 more samples, a variety of types, are on their way to the INRB lab in Kinshasa.\nLisa Schnirring Wisconsin reports presumptive avian flu in poultry worker as California declares emergency California's dairy farm outbreaks have spread beyond the Central Valley to the southern part of the state.\nLisa Schnirring Indicators show US flu and COVID activity rising Flu activity continues to elevate, and COVID-19 markers are also starting to rise from very low levels.\nLisa Schnirring Louisiana reports its first probable human H5N1 case as California logs 2 more The Louisiana patient, who was exposed to sick and dead birds with suspected infection, has been hospitalized.\nMary Van Beusekom Health workers think COVID, flu vaccines safe and effective, but many remain hesitant, global survey shows Many participants believe that pharmaceutical firms and public health officials minimized the vaccines' side effects.\nMary Van Beusekom CDC confirms first severe H5N1 case in US patient The infection also marks the first US case with exposure to backyard poultry, which fits H5N1's global pattern.\nLisa Schnirring Flu surveillance flags probable H5 avian flu case in Delaware Also, the USDA reported more confirmations in cows, poultry, and other mammals and Labcorp announced the launch of its H5 molecular test.\nLisa Schnirring COVID-19 linked to more heart complications than flu, RSV The odds of myocarditis were 61% lower in flu and 85% lower in RSV than with COVID-19.\nStephanie Soucheray Los Angeles County confirms avian flu in cat deaths as more cases suspected The three cats with suspected infections don't have any known exposure to raw milk, and investigators are examining other potential sources, including raw meat.\nLisa Schnirring Our underwriters Unrestricted financial support provided by Principal Underwriter Leading Underwriter Major Underwriter Supporting Underwriter Become an Underwriter Help make CIDRAP's vital work possible\nSupport Us Home Editorial policy Search news",

To help reduce the risk of lung cancer for people throughout the U.S., the organization is educating the public about how they can test for radon and offering proven resources to help people quit smoking for good.\nCHICAGO | December 17, 2024\nThe [American Lung Association](https://www.lung.org/) is increasing efforts to raise awareness for the two largest risk factors for lung cancer – smoking cigarettes and exposure to radon gas. To help reduce the risk of lung cancer for people throughout the U.S., the organization is educating the public about how they can test for radon and offering proven resources to help people quit smoking for good.\n“Smoking remains the leading cause of lung cancer and radon exposure is the second leading cause. People who smoke who are also exposed to radon are at an even greater risk of lung cancer, so it is even more important for them to test for radon and start their journey to quit for good,” said Harold Wimmer, President and CEO of the American Lung Association. “The New Year is one of the most common times of the year for people to quit smoking and January is National Radon Action Month, so now is the perfect time for people to take action to protect their health.”\nRadon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that is odorless, tasteless and colorless. It seeps into homes and buildings through cracks in floors, walls and foundations, often going unnoticed even if it is present at dangerous levels. At least 1 in 15 homes in the U.S. have elevated radon levels, putting millions of people at risk. Radon-related lung cancer is responsible for an estimated 21,000 deaths annually in the U.S.\nCigarette smoking is directly responsible for approximately 80-90% of lung cancer deaths in the U.S. Despite increased awareness of the dangers of smoking, millions continue to smoke, putting themselves at significant risk for developing lung cancer.\nTaking Action to Reduce Risk for Lung Cancer:\n-\nRadon Testing : The American Lung Association encourages all homeowners to test for radon, as it is the only way to know if radon levels are elevated. Radon test kits are widely available, affordable and easy to use. If elevated radon levels are detected, mitigation systems can be installed to reduce exposure. Learn more at\n[Lung.org/radon](https://www.lung.org/clean-air/indoor-air/indoor-air-pollutants/radon). -\nSmoking Cessation: Quitting smoking is the single most important step individuals can take to protect their lung health. While 70% of people who smoke want to quit, many face challenges in doing so without proper support. Comprehensive treatment plans, including behavioral counseling and FDA-approved cessation medications, have proven effective in helping people quit for good. People can start their quit smoking journal at\n[Lung.org/quit-smoking](https://www.lung.org/quit-smoking)or by calling the Lung Helpline at 1-800-586-4872.\nTo enhance its efforts to reduce lung cancer risk, the American Lung Association is partnering with the [Indoor Environments Association (IEA)](https://aarst.org/) . This collaboration aims to promote awareness about the dangers of radon exposure and smoking, and provide resources for smoking cessation. Through the partnership, the Lung Association is connecting radon and vapor intrusion professionals, their families, and IEA members with proven quit smoking resources, including the [Freedom From Smoking Plus program](https://www.lung.org/quit-smoking/join-freedom-from-smoking) .\nFor more information on radon testing and smoking cessation resources, visit [Lung.org/quit-smoking](https://www.lung.org/quit-smoking) and [Lung.org/radon](https://www.lung.org/clean-air/indoor-air/indoor-air-pollutants/radon) .\nAbout the American Lung Association\nThe American Lung Association is the leading organization working to save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease through education, advocacy and research. The work of the American Lung Association is focused on four strategic imperatives: to defeat lung cancer; to champion clean air for all; to improve the quality of life for those with lung disease and their families; and to create a tobacco-free future. For more information about the American Lung Association, which has a 4-star rating from Charity Navigator and is a Platinum-Level GuideStar Member, call 1-800-LUNGUSA (1-800-586-4872) or visit: Lung.org. To support the work of the American Lung Association, find a local event at Lung.org/events.\nAbout the Indoor Environments Association\nThe Indoor Environments Association, formerly AARST, is a nonprofit professional organization dedicated to setting the highest standards of excellence in identifying and mitigating radon, vapor intrusion, and other environmental hazards in the built environment. IEA supports its members by advancing public health and safety through industry standards development, professional certification, public policy advocacy, and effective communication of health risks.

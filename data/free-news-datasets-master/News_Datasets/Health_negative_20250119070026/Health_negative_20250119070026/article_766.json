    "text": "Britain is being battered by a tidal wave of festive flu, health chiefs warned today.\nSurveillance programs monitoring the current flu outbreak in the UK indicate that flu-related hospital admissions in England have already exceeded last year’s peak and are currently at their highest level this winter.\nFigures show more than 2,600 beds alone have been taken up by flu patients, an increase of almost 40 per cent on last week (1,795).\nOf these, 125 were in critical care — up 90 per cent on the previous seven days.\nRates of the winter vomiting bug norovirus, meanwhile, are also almost 25 per cent higher than expected for this time of year.\nHealth officials are concerned that the number of cases will continue to rise in the upcoming weeks due to increased social gatherings indoors during the holiday season.\nThey are advising individuals experiencing symptoms like cough, sore throat, or runny nose to avoid contact with high-risk groups such as the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with underlying health conditions to prevent potential severe illness from the virus.\nIt comes as experts have already warned the health service must brace itself for a ‘quad-demic’ driven the four winter illnesses — flu, covid, norovirus and cold-like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).\nSurveillance programmes that monitor the UK’s outbreak suggest flu hospital admissions in England have already surpassed last year’s peak and are running at their highest level so far this winter\nRSV, which is most common in infants and young children, was 25 per cent higher in the week ending December 17, than the previous year.\nNHS national medical director, Professor Sir Stephen Powis, said: ‘The NHS has been hit hard with an early festive flu season, putting increased pressure on staff as they prepare for the long winter ahead of us.\n‘In response to the flood of flu cases so early in the season, the NHS has been making it as easy as possible for people to get protected with a jab, including vaccination centres in supermarket car parks and football clubs.\n‘As children finish school and friends and families congregate over the Christmas period we expect viruses to continue to spread.\n‘So if you haven’t got your flu jab and are eligible please come forward, and the public should think twice about seeing loved ones if they are seriously unwell.\n‘I would remind anyone who needs medical support to continue to use 999 and A&E in an emergency and for everything else, use NHS 111 or 111 online.’\nPeople who are aged over 65, those with long term health conditions, pregnant women, care home residents and carers are eligible for a free jab.\nThere are signs that calls for eligible Brits to roll up their sleeves and get jabbed have been heard.\nNHS England said staff had now delivered a total of 28.5 million vaccines since the start of September.\nToday marks the last day to book winter vaccinations online or via NHS 111 for an appointment at a local vaccination site.\nFrom Friday, Brits will only be able to visit a Covid walk-in vaccination site or attend a pharmacy to get the jab.\nFears of a bad flu year come just days after experts warned this year’s flu vaccine could be 30 per cent less effective than hoped.\nThe flu vaccine is changed each year based on data from countries in the southern hemisphere, like Australia and New Zealand ,who have their winter season six months before Britain.\nThis is because the same types of flu that struck those countries usually goes on to cause the majority of cases in the UK.\nHowever, sometimes this forecasting is wrong.\nIn 2017, a mismatched flu vaccine was responsible for 50,000 extra deaths in the UK, according to the Office of National Statistics.\nData suggests the flu jab used in the southern hemisphere, which the one being rolled out in the UK is based on, could be up to 30 per cent less effective than normal.\nExperts consider a successful flu jab to be one that prevents people from needing hospital care for the virus in about 7 in 10 cases.\nHowever, data from countries like Australia and New Zealand, suggests the latest jab only stopped 4 in 10 hospitalisations.\nFlu, also called influenza, is responsible for about 40,000 hospitalisations and more than 10,000 deaths in the UK every year, though this can be higher in bad years.\nThe symptoms typically include fever, sore throat, muscle aches and a cough.\nEmma Rubach, head of health advice at Asthma + Lung UK, said: ‘ For the 1 in 5 people living with a lung condition in the UK, flu can lead to a potentially life-threatening asthma attack or a flare up of their lung condition and worsen symptoms such as breathlessness and coughing.\n‘As well as having your flu vaccine, it’s equally important that people with lung conditions such as asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) take their medicines as prescribed.\n‘This includes using their preventer inhaler daily and always carrying their reliever inhaler with them.’",

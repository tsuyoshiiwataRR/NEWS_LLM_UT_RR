    "text": "The FDA is issuing multiple advisories for oysters and Manila clams that could be contaminated with Norovirus, a serious gastrointestinal illness.\nIn the case of oysters from British Columbia first recalled in California, a notice says the product should not be consumed or distributed and should be marked as “not safe” and “don’t touch.”\n“Consumers should not eat these potentially contaminated oysters. Consumers who have symptoms should contact their health care provider to report their symptoms and receive care,” the FDA said.\nBritish Columbia oysters recall A recall was issued by S&M Shellfish Co in San Francisco, California, on Dec. 13 for shellstock sold as Fanny Bay, Buckley Bay and Royal Miyagi Oysters after multiple confirmed Norovirus illnesses were reported, according to the state.\nThe California recall says the concerned product was harvested in British Columbia from Dec. 1 to Dec. 9 by Pacific Northwest Shellfish and Union Bay Seafood. The affected certificate numbers are BC 740 SP and BC 6001 SP.\nThe “Urgent Product Recall” said any product that meets the recall criteria should be “IMMEDIATELY STOPPED” from consumption or distribution and should be returned or labeled “NOT SAFE, DON’T TOUCH and/or to be DESTROYED.”\nThe FDA issued an advisory for these oysters on Dec. 18 to restaurants and food retailers in Arizona, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

    "text": "As the debate over the safety and efficacy of weight loss drugs like Ozempic intensifies, experts in the field of health and medicine are urging individuals [to be more cautious about the long-term risks](http://www.brighteon.com/a0ae8920-0ec6-4d2e-a604-11ca6b599560) associated with these pharmaceutical solutions.\nIn a recent \"Decentralize.TV\" interview, naturopath Diane Kazer discussed with hosts Mike Adams and Todd Pitner the potential dangers of medications like Ozempic and the emerging field of peptide therapy as a promising alternative.\nKazer, [an expert in natural health and regenerative medicine](http://dianekazer.com/meet-diane/), expressed reservations about the widespread use of Ozempic, a GLP-1 receptor agonist commonly prescribed for weight loss and diabetes management. She told the two: \"The things that we've used in the past, there's a lot of things in nature that would be poison but are our medicine.\"\nKazer pointed out that these medications, derived from Gila monster venom, may have long-term implications that are not yet fully understood. Adams echoed her concerns, explaining that these drugs are essentially [using venom from reptiles](http://ingredients.news) and other animals to create a pharmaceutical solution. (Related: [Ozempic and Wegovy weight loss drugs are injectable LIZARD VENOM PEPTIDES that may unleash a devastating wave of organ failure… side effects align with symptoms of SNAKE BITES](https://www.naturalnews.com/2024-06-09-ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-drugs-injectable-lizard-venom-peptides.html).)\n\"What we're dealing with here is we now have a medical system that has taken a poison that is normally injected through a snake's fangs,\" said Adams. \"They've put it into a needle, and they've call it a medical treatment.\"\nThe potential long-term effects of venom-based therapies on the human body remain a source of significant concern. The experts highlighted the growing body of evidence suggesting that long-term use of medications like Ozempic could lead to serious health issues, including vision loss, heart problems and hormonal imbalances. They pointed to studies linking these drugs [to an alarming 162 deaths in the United States](https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/health/report-ozempic-and-other-weight-loss-drugs-linked-to-162-us-deaths/), a statistic that underscores the importance of understanding the risks associated with their use.\nKazer advocated for the use of peptide therapy as a more natural and potentially safer alternative. Peptide therapy, she explained, offers a range of benefits, including reducing inflammation, promoting immune function and improving overall cellular health.\n\"There are peptides that can actually reduce inflammation, that can induce your immune system and your cell system, mitochondria to be activated to start to release toxins from where their body is storing,\" Kazer said.\nThe three also discussed the broader implications of centralized medicine and the need for decentralization in healthcare. Adams argued that the current system has turned out to be not just a failure, but a \"deadly danger to humanity.\"\nHe emphasized the importance of exploring and utilizing alternative therapies, such as peptides, herbs and natural substances, rather than relying solely on pharmaceutical interventions.\nAs the debate over the [safety and efficacy of weight loss drugs](http://slender.news) continues, individuals are increasingly turning to natural alternatives and holistic approaches to health and wellness.\nThe interview with Kazer highlights the importance of exploring alternative therapies and making informed decisions about healthcare. By adopting a more holistic approach to health and wellness, individuals can take control of their own health and make informed decisions that prioritize long-term well-being.\nFollow [DangerousMedicine.com](https://dangerousmedicine.com/) for more news about dangerous weight loss drugs.\nWatch [the full interview](http://www.brighteon.com/a0ae8920-0ec6-4d2e-a604-11ca6b599560) between Diane Kazer, Todd Pitner and the Health Ranger Mike Adams on \"Decentralize.TV\" below.",

    "text": "Photo: WSET\nFrom our partners over at ABC13-WSET:\nLYNCHBURG, Va. (WSET) — It is with deep sadness that ABC13 announces the passing of Mark Spain, who was a vital anchor in both our newsroom and the community.\nOn Wednesday, December 18, Mark died after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He was born on May 25, 1960 and passed away at 64 years of age.\nHis smile and positivity were known to his family, our team here at WSET, and the thousands across Lynchburg and beyond who welcomed Mark into their homes each night on TV. When he first addressed the community regarding his cancer diagnosis in early December, he echoed that familiar sunny outlook despite the heavy situation.\nHis battle against cancer was not fought alone. Those closest to Mark’s side were his beloved family; with his passing, he left behind his wife, Lynita, and three children: two daughters and a son.\nLynita announced her husband's passing, emphasizing how much love he brought into the world.\n\"Our family along with the city of Lynchburg lost a man of hope, someone who loves his city and stood for equality, treating others with respect and kindness,\" she said. \"He was a husband, father, brother, friend and a positive light in the community. My first true love. He brought so much joy, compassion, love and strength into our lives, and his absence will be deeply felt by all who knew him.\"\nMark fought hard, Lynita said, with his family alongside him. He stayed positive until the end.\n\"We have comfort in knowing he is no longer suffering, it was not easy watching him fight for his life and battle this disease, but he was not alone., and neither were we,\" Lynita said.\nShe thanked the community for the support shown to the Spain family over the past few weeks before turning to the future and asking to keep the prayers coming.\nRead more about the passing of Mark Spain at ABC13-WSET .\nMark Spain with his longtime anchor partners, Danner Evans and George Flickinger.

    "text": "By Allison Bruhl ,\n2 hours ago\nBATON ROUGE, La. (BRPROUD) — The Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry reports that bird flu, H5N1, has been detected in a second backyard flock.\nPeople who work with birds, poultry or cows are at an increased risk for the virus. Officials suggest poultry owners take steps to prevent bird flu from spreading. Last week , the state wildlife department reported an uptick in wild birds dying from bird flu.\nLouisiana health officials confirmed a human case of bird flu on Friday, Dec. 13. A resident from the southwestern portion of the state was hospitalized. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , there have been 61 reported human cases of bird flu in the nation since April 2024.\nSick or dead birds should be reported by calling USDA’s toll-free number 1-866-536-7593.\n‘Bird flu symptoms’: Online searches spike after first severe case in US Latest News New legislation will provide Social Security benefits to more retirees Democrats warn about impacts of a government shutdown ‘Bring back the Bison’: IU’s mascot movement gaining steam in Bloomington Bird flu detected in second Louisiana backyard flock: officials Senator pushes bill to build high-speed rail systems Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

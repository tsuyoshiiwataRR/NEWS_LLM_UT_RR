At one point I was spending £70k ($90k) a year on it – that's not including the drugs the rock stars gave me.\"\nOn her last days, her partner Bines added: \"She lived a very simple life. She would even go without the basics, some days she wouldn't even eat.\n\"She went from so much money to nothing. She was such a lovely person. Imagine going from all that to where she ended up.\"",

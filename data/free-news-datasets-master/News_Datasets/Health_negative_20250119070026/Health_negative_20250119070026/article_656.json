    "text": "By Colleen Dilthey Thomas ,\n22 minutes ago Just a week before Christmas, a popular teenage social media influencer has died. Beandri Booysen, 19, died from complications of progeria , a rare genetic disorder that causes a person to age rapidly. She died less than a month after her 19th birthday.\n@bb_unique_2005 #angel #loved WE ALREADY MISS YOU SO MUCH #fyp\n♬ original sound – Phil Wickham – Phil Wickham Beandri Booysen’s Family Shared News Of Her Passing Her mother, Bea Booysen, released a statement in the Beandri, Our Inspiration Faceboo k group announcing her daughter’s passing.\nShe wrote in part, “It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of Beandri Booysen, one of South Africa’s most beloved and inspirational young women. Beandri was not only known for her sparkling personality and infectious laugh, but was also the last surviving person in South Africa to live with Progeria – a rare genetic condition that causes children to age early.”\nFollowers and loved ones shared condolences with the family.\nOne wrote, “What a sad moment for South Africa, May her soul find rest in the Lord and may the Lord comfort the family\n“Rest in peace dear Beandri… God’s warrior to the end. To mom, dad, brother, family and loved ones, lots of strength in this sad time, may God hold you all tightly in His arms of comfort. We carry you in our hearts,” a follower shared.\nAnother wrote, “Rest in Peace my beautiful BB. You were truly an inspiration for me and I loved you unbelievably much my BB. Jesus dances with your baby in His arms on His doorstep. My deepest sympathy to Bb’s parents and loved ones.”\nAccording to the Progeria Research Foundation , before her death, “Beandri just finished her Child Psychology studies” and was working on her life coach studies so she could help those who were dealing with emotional trauma and bullying.\nThe progeria community will remember Beandri Booysen for her work educating others and her zest for life. May she rest in peace.\nThis story’s featured image can be found here .\nThe post Progeria Influencer Beandri Booysen Who “Was A Voice And A Symbol Of Awareness” Has Passed Away At 19 appeared first on InspireMore .",

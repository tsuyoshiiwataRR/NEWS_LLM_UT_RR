    "text": "KATHMANDU, Dec 20: A report of the Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security (MoLESS) stated that more than 14,000 Nepalis who went for foreign employment in the last 15 years have died. Since the establishment of the Foreign Employment Board (FEB) Secretariat in the fiscal year 2008/09, 14,213 individuals have died while working abroad.\nThe MoLESS has made this report public on the occasion of International Migrant Workers' Day, which is being celebrated throughout the week in Nepal. The ministry is celebrating the week from December 16 to 22 with various events, including those held on Wednesday.\nThe ministry organized a week-long program to celebrate the day, forming a main event organizing committee chaired by the ministry’s secretary, Mukunda Prasad Niraula. The committee released details showing that 3,440 workers have returned seriously ill or with disabilities since the establishment of the board. Secretary Niraula stated that the FEB has provided financial assistance to these workers. He also mentioned that Nepali citizens have migrated to 111 different countries for work.\nThe Migration Report 2024 of the International Organization for Migration estimates that 28.10 million people worldwide are migrants, with 16.90 million of them being migrant workers. To address potential discrimination against migrants, the United Nations adopted the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families on December 18, 1990, and it came into effect on July 1, 2003.\n<a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/moless-to-enlist-medical-centers-providing-services-to-nepali-nationals-going-abroad\">\nRelated story\n</a>\nMoLESS to enlist medical centers providing services to Nepali n...\nForeign employment has made a significant contribution to boosting Nepal's economy. The Ministry of Labor has stated that the government's policy is to utilize the capital, technology, skills, and experience earned from foreign employment to their fullest potential while making the labor force, which is the backbone of the economy, productive and competitive.\nThe government's policies and programs for the fiscal year 2024/25 include measures to make foreign employment safe and dignified. These measures involve amendments to foreign employment-related laws, ensuring employment with skills, free orientation training, review of labor agreements, signing labor agreements and memoranda of understanding with additional destination countries, encouraging citizens wishing to go for foreign employment to open free bank accounts and bring remittances through these accounts, and implementing a returnee entrepreneurship program, among other initiatives.\nAccording to Nepal Rastra Bank data, remittance inflow increased by 16.5 percent compared to the previous fiscal year, totaling Rs 1.445 trillion in the fiscal year 2023/24. During this period, 741,297 workers, including 80,172 women, who went for foreign employment with labor approval (including re-approval) from the Department of Foreign Employment, sent remittances. These remittances helped sustain the families of migrant workers, improve human asset indicators, reduce the financial risk of impoverished families, and significantly contributed to Nepal’s economy. The World Bank's October 2024 report states that remittances account for more than a quarter of Nepal's total GDP.\nThe MoLESS has stated that, as in previous years, various programs are being held this year as part of the decision to observe Migrant Workers' Day as a week-long event with the aim of raising awareness among stakeholders about safe and dignified foreign employment.\nSecretary Niraula explains that documents required for foreign employment, such as passports, skill training, and orientation, are prepared with the crucial role of local bodies, including district administration offices, district police offices, municipalities, and rural municipalities. Therefore, International Migrant Workers' Day, being a matter of concern for all, holds special significance at the local level.\nUnder Secretary of the MoLESS, Basanta Bohara, states that the government is working to restructure the foreign employment policy to regulate foreign employment. He mentioned that the policy is currently in the suggestion phase.\nAnother under secretary of the MoLESS, Mahesh Parajuli, shared that a study found 98.9 percent of remittances are sent through formal channels, and few people face problems. He added that since most of the earned money is spent on family management, there is a need to encourage and raise awareness about investing it in income generation, and such programs will provide support in this area.",

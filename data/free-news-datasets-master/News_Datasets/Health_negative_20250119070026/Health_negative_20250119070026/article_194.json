(WAFB) - Another record drug bust in Livingston Parish was reported after 100,000 lethal doses of fentanyl were seized by the sheriff’s office. It’s the largest fentanyl seizure in the parish’s history.\nRELATED:[ 4 people arrested, over 100K lethal doses of Fentanyl seized during drug bust](https://www.wafb.com/2024/12/19/4-people-arrested-over-100k-lethal-doses-fentanyl-seized-during-drug-bust/)\n”You have 150,000 population here, you have 100,000 pressed fentanyl pills, that’s enough to wipe out everybody here,” said Livingston Parish Sheriff Jason Ard.\nArd says Tyrone Broadway, Eugene ‘Jake’ Skinner, Donald ‘Bo’ McCray, and Devonte Skinner were arrested after an investigation that spanned over two years.\n”It takes a while to do them because we want to do them right, we want to make sure these four individuals get a lot of time, I would like to see that they never come back into the streets again,” said Ard.\nArd believes these four alleged dealers are directly responsible for many of the overdoses in the parish.\n”Overall, through this investigation, we have seized over 100,000 pills, several vehicles, oxycodone, fentanyl, and methamphetamines. These guys were serious problems there’s no doubt responsible for some of these overdoses that we’ve worked,” added Ard.\nThis was just one of several large fentanyl busts this year in the parish, which means their narcotics division has grown.\n”Because of the narcotics and stuff we’ve been seeing because of our narcotics, we just added more agents to our narcotics so now we have more undercover narcotics and we did a couple of months ago,” explained Ard.\nWith their newly beefed up narcotics division, Ard says it’s only a matter of time before they get more drug dealers off the streets.\n”That just means we will be able to do more than what we were doing so I’m very excited about 2025 and if I was a drug dealer, I probably wouldn’t be excited about 2025,” said Ard, If you’re out here and you think slinging dope is cool, It’s going to be cool until you see us and you will see us eventually cause we’ll put you in jail.”\nDevonte Skinner, one of the four arrested, was also arrested back in April for another large fentanyl seizure in Livingston Parish. He was already in custody from that previous bust.\n[Click here](mailto:typo@wafb.com) to report a typo.

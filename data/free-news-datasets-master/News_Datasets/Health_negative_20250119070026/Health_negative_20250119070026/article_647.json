Read more Letters to the Editor .\nFor-profit health carepromises more rage Re: “ Brian Thompson, not his killer, is the real working-class hero ” (Page A8, Dec. 15).\nIn his column, using the “who was the real working-class dude” angle, Bret Stephens fails at making us idolize Brian Thompson (from hardscrabble Iowa), the UnitedHealthcare CEO killed Dec. 4 outside of a New York hotel.\nHe fails on two points: He cites a Kaiser Family Foundation survey from June 2023 that 81% are happy with their health policy, as if this solves it. If you read the report, its second headline says: “Despite rating their insurance positively, most insured adults report experiencing problems using their health coverage; people in poorer health are more likely to report problems.” Fifty-eight percent of insured adults say they have had problems using their health insurance in the past 12 months because they were denied claims or had provider network or preauthorization problems.\nThe problem remains that we have a private health care insurance industry run for profit, not for the health of the American public. Change the system or expect more rage.\nWalter Hudson San Jose\nFull text makes emptypromise of agreement Re: “ Treaty obligates U.S. to help Ukraine ” (Page A8, Dec. 15).\nI agree with Samuel Wright that we have a moral obligation to help Ukraine.\nStill, Wright intentionally misleads us into thinking we also have a legal obligation by quoting the 1994 agreement out of context. He quotes “promised to provide assistance if Ukraine becomes a victim of aggression,” but the full quote is, “to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance … ” which is quite a weaker promise and actually an empty promise in this case since Russia has veto power on any such United Nations action.\nPaul Mennen Sunnyvale\nLights will make localtrails, parks safer In the parks and trails I’ve been to near my city – Cupertino – there’s a lack of lights, which at night makes me feel endangered, and averse to going there. I’m not the only one facing this. In a survey I conducted of 78 Cupertino residents, 73% rated their safety on trails at night as a 3 or lower out of 5.\nThe purpose of parks and trails is to encourage people to engage and travel in their communities, which is why this poll result is worrying. In the same survey, 90% rated their perceived safety in trails with lights as a 4 or higher out of 5, so it’s clear that cities need to build more lights.\nWhile installation costs are a temporary issue, residential safety is of utmost importance, and should be improved upon in any way possible.\nArnav Sharma Cupertino\nSouth Korea setsgood example for world Re: “ South Korea impeaches president, leaves country under military rule ” (Page A3, Dec. 16).\nI would like to congratulate the elected officials of South Korea. It is refreshing to see that there are countries where leaders prioritize the nation over party interests.\nThis stands in contrast to the situation in America, where some elected officials are so fearful of losing their positions that they will let anything slide.\nAshok Agarwal San Jose",

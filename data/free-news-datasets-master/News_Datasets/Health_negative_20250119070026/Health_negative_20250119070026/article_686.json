    "text": "ST. LUCIE COUNTY, Fla. â€” For the first time, we're hearing from the mother of the 6-year-old girl who was seriously hurt in a Martin County car crash in September.\nLaw enforcement said the crash was caused by Ryan Routh , the man charged in the attempted assassination of President-elect Donald Trump in Palm Beach County,\nProsecutors said Routh led authorities on a chase on Interstate 95, which caused law enforcement to close the road on the day of the incident.\nFlorida Attorney General Ashley Moody said this week that during the apprehension and arrest of Routh, a car crash occurred that caused serious injuries to Mia Rosalie Monreal, a 6-year-old Port St. Lucie girl.\nMia was in a coma after the wreck and is still hospitalized in Jacksonville.\nZoom Norka Pardo speaks from hospital about her daughter's condition. \"I usually read a lot to her, I sing to her to let her know mommy is here, you're not alone,\" said Norka Pardo, Mia's mom.\nPardo said she was in the car with Mia, her youngest son and her boyfriend when the crash happened. She said she fractured her arm and had a concussion.\n\"All I was doing was asking about the kids and the nurses were trying to calm me down, and telling me we're worried about you right now,\" said Pardo.\nMia was airlifted to HCA Florida Lawnwood Hospital for surgery and then went to St. Mary's Medical Center for a month and a half.\nPardo said Mia suffered a severe brain injury and was in a coma for a month. On Wednesday, Mia was transferred to a Jacksonville hospital for therapy.\n\"She was not responding, she's not waking up at all, so they have to kind of help her out and give her medication to help her brain restart,\" Pardo said. \"She's kind of opening her eyes, closing to fall asleep, opening her eyes but there was no response.\"\nDespite living in St. Lucie County, Pardo said she's taken off work to be by her daughter's side.\nWATCH: Ryan Routh to face charges in Martin County\nWhy Ryan Routh now faces state charges in Martin County \"Have you been able to have a clear conversation with her in the last three months?\" asked WPTV reporter Joel Lopez.\n\"No and she can't communicate so even when I talk to her, I don't even know if she remembers me I don't know if she knows who I am, I don't know,\" said Pardo. \"It's a miracle she's still alive, I can't imagine what she was going through and how she almost didn't make it.\"\nShe said Mia was very energetic and had dreams of being a gymnast. She said Mia was also very protective of her younger brother who is on the autism spectrum.\n\"I do have breakdowns very often. It's really hard also not being home with my other two kids,\" said Pardo. \"Before the accident, I've always been a very overprotective mother and now I have to let go of that, because I can't be there for my little one and my oldest, because I have to be here with her.\"\nOn Wednesday Attorney General Ashley Moody was in Martin County to announce additional attempted murder charges against Ryan Routh.\nProvided by family Norka Pardo with her daughter, Mia, and family. \"When you couple those terrible injuries together with his other criminal conduct, which we believe rises to the level of domestic terrorism, it turns his actions into an attempted felony murder case,\" Moody said.\nRouth remains in federal custody.\n\"None of that is going to fix anything,\" said Pardo. \"She's still in the hospital, we're still going through this, but I just hope he pays for what he did.\"\nRight now, Mia's future is uncertain, but the family is planning on visiting her in the hospital in Jacksonville for Christmas.\nIf you'd like to help the family and Mia in her recovery, click the link here .",

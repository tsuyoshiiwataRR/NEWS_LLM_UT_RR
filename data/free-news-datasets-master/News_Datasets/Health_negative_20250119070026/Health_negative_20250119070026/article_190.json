His loss will be deeply felt by his family, colleagues, artists, the Nashville music community, and the music industry at large.” “When we started touring in our 15-passenger van, we used to park at the venue and bide our time until it was time to load in. We didn’t have money for hotels and we’d usually be splitting Subway sandwiches or Clif Bars between us,” recalls Jeremiah Fraites of The Lumineers. “I’ll never forget when Paul Roper showed up to the parking lot behind the venue in Nashville and met us with beer and pizza. It was a small gesture on his side, but a massive one for us. I’ll never forget that.”\nPaul was a visionary leader and a pioneer in a music space he called Amerikinda, celebrating great songwriting in a wide variety of genres. Under his leadership, Dualtone Music thrived, earning its reputation as a trusted partner for artists and a leader in independent music.\n“Paul’s vision and unwavering commitment continue to define the heart and soul of Dualtone. He led Dualtone and his team with dedication, authenticity, humor, and kindness, and he will be terribly missed by all of us,” the label’s statement concludes. “Paul Roper’s legacy of kindness, integrity, and deep love for music will continue to inspire us all.”\nIn lieu of flowers, Paul’s family requests that donations be made to Corner to Corner in his memory.\nShare on:\nFacebook\nTwitter LinkedIn\nCopy Link Related Posts DMN Pro Exclusive Spotify’s Individual Subscribers Are Suddenly Declining In the US — Here’s a Look at the Latest Data Paul Resnikoff December 18, 2024 DMN Pro Exclusive Amazon Music Is Losing Ground In 2024 — And Other Takeaways From DMN Pro’s Latest Streaming Subscriber Breakdown Paul Resnikoff December 11, 2024 Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You” Reaches 2 Billion Streams on Spotify Ashley King December 19, 2024 Apple Music Taps Björk, Skepta, Uncle Waffles for New Year’s Eve Livestreams Ashley King December 19, 2024 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply You must be logged in to post a comment.",

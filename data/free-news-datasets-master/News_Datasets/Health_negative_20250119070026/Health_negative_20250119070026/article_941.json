    "text": "20th December 2024 – (Shanghai) Recent reports from Shanghai highlight a concerning case where a man in his thirties began experiencing joint pain and dizziness earlier this year. Subsequently diagnosed with rheumatism and migraines, he followed medical advice to inspect his home environment, only to discover a distressing situation.\nMr. Zhou, in his thirties, found mould spots on the walls and wardrobe in his residence, alongside a pile of construction and household waste outside his windows, rendering them inoperable. Moreover, a narrow gap of approximately half a meter between his residence and the neighbouring building saw trash accumulating to heights of 5 to 6 meters. Mr. Zhou had already cleared out his belongings in May and temporarily relocated to a rented apartment due to the unsanitary conditions. Property management personnel acknowledged the challenging task of clearing the accumulated waste from the narrow gap, necessitating the removal of a window at Mr. Zhou’s residence, with the company bearing all associated costs.\nFurthermore, a property inspection revealed that a neighbour above Mr. Zhou had installed a private drainage pipe alongside a colour steel house, leading to direct discharge of water into the gap, resulting in mould growth on Mr. Zhou’s walls. Property management representatives stated plans to address the issue by requesting the neighbour to rectify the drainage pipe maintenance problems.",

    "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. — Oregon is experiencing a sharp spike in the number of flu cases reported statewide, and doctors and health officials are urging residents to get vaccinated\n[if they haven't already](/article/news/health/best-time-for-flu-shot/283-65a9ff39-f4be-43c2-9e97-918157b74ebb); not only for the flu but also for RSV and COVID-19, both of which are expected to see seasonal spikes during the holidays.\n\"Influenza season has definitely arrived,\" state epidemiologist Dr. Dean Sidelinger said in a statement. \"And, RSV isn’t far behind.\"\nThe state saw 58 flu-related hospitalizations during the week of Dec. 8-14, up from 39 the week before, and test result positivity climbed from 10.6% to 18.7% over the same time period, according to the\n[latest weekly report](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/COMMUNICABLEDISEASE/DISEASESURVEILLANCEDATA/INFLUENZA/Documents/data/FluBites.pdf) from the Oregon Health Authority. The highest test positivity rates are in the northern and eastern parts of the state.\nThe state's positive flu test percentage began climbing in early November, and hospitalizations began to pick up about two weeks later and have been climbing steadily since then, with the fastest increase among people over 50.\nThe test positivity rate appears to be climbing at about the same pace as it did during last year's flu season, although the season appears to be off to a later start this time around; the sharp rise began about a month earlier in the 2023-2024 season.\n\"Every respiratory virus season has the potential to be a bad respiratory virus season, and activity levels we’re seeing for both influenza and RSV are telling us the 2024-2025 season is no exception,\" Sidelinger said. \"Everyone should get the flu and COVID-19 vaccines now, and those in high-risk groups — infants, young children, older adults, and pregnant persons — should also get the RSV vaccine.\"\nRSV vaccine protection lasts longer than one year, Sidelinger said during a news conference Thursday, so people who got the shot last year don't need to get it again this year, but anyone in a high-risk group who hasn't gotten one recently should make an effort to get one — and everyone should get an updated flu shot.\n\"Right now I'm disappointed in the vaccine numbers that we see,\" he said. \"We see our flu vaccine trailing below previous years here in Oregon. That's a trend that most other states are seeing. And that's hard, because we've seen that decrease in seasonal flu vaccines each year over the last few years. And while this vaccine doesn't provide 100% protection, it really does help prevent illness in most people and it really does keep people out of the hospital.\"\nCOVID booster update rates are also trailing behind this year, he said. Both vaccines are widely available and covered by insurance.\n\"We also need to remember the importance of basic health habits like hand washing, covering coughs, wearing masks when necessary, and staying home when feeling unwell,\" Dr. Kathryn Glassberg, medical director for quality with Kaiser Permanente in Portland, said in a statement. \"We’re seeing flu cases begin to tick up, and with the virus circulating alongside COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses, it’s vital to stay proactive about our health to protect yourself and your loved ones this season.\"",

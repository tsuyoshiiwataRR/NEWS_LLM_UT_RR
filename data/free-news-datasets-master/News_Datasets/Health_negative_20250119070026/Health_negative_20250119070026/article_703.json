    "text": "Danielle Vasinova \"died for three minutes\" when she had COVID-19.\nThe 42-year-old actress - who has just been cast in the 'Yellowstone' spin-off 'The Madison' - revealed that she thought she was just coming \"down with the flu\" when she contracted the viral infection more than two months before the pandemic was declared and upon going to seek medical advice, her heart stopped for a matter of minutes.\nShe told People: \"On Dec. 12, 2019, I died for three minutes.\n\"I thought I was coming down with the flu. But in the early days of the virus, it was often misdiagnosed.\n\"I went to urgent care in downtown L.A., and they decided it was strep and sent me home with some antibiotics. But by the next day, I could barely walk. My legs wouldn't move. It was bizarre.\n\"I felt like I was going to die.\"\nThe '1923' star suffered \"complete organ failure\" amid the ordeal and noted that while she is normally healthy, the infection just took hold of her body out of nowhere.\nShe said: \"I had complete organ failure. I went from young and healthy to this infection that completely took over my body all of a sudden. It just came on, and it just rocked my world.\"\nDanielle noted that while she didn't see any \"light or the tunnel\" when she died, she saw an array of angel numbers and now considers the whole thing to be a \"rebirth\" of sorts.\nShe said: \"I didn't see the light or a tunnel but they say it can come back to you in flashbacks.\n\"I did, however, start to see a lot of angel numbers everywhere. I would see sequences like 5555, 7777. It was bizarre, but something was telling me, 'There's something more for you. You weren't meant to go just yet. You're meant to do something else.\n\"It's hard to even describe how I feel, but I'm so much more connected. This felt like the turning point in my life. The death, and the rebirth. I know to take nothing for granted. Life is so precious and it is such a gift. We're here to do some good in the world, to be of service, and to be forever grateful.\"",

(Source: KKTV) By Lauren Watson , Lindsey Grewe and Gray News staff Published: Dec. 19, 2024 at 7:18 PM CST | Updated: 2 hours ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. ( KKTV /Gray News) - A woman is suing McDonald’s and Taylor Farms after she and her daughter allegedly became ill after eating food at the restaurant.\nAccording to the lawsuit, the mother and her daughter ordered Quarter Pounders at the McDonald’s on South 8th Street in Colorado Springs on Oct. 17.\nThe suit alleges that the next day, both were experiencing symptoms of E. coli, went to the hospital, and were diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis.\nAttorneys say Tuesday’s lawsuit is the first with a minor child plaintiff related to the recent outbreak earlier this fall .\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed more than 100 cases in the McDonald’s E. coli outbreak in September and October, including 34 that required hospitalization and one death. Fourteen states reported cases, with Colorado being the hardest hit with more than 30 cases.\nMcDonald’s has said the outbreak stemmed from the slivered onions in its Quarter Pounders, and it temporarily pulled the item from the menu. The company has linked the contaminated onions to Taylor Farm’s Colorado Springs-based facility.\nKKTV has reached out to both McDonald’s and Taylor Farms for a response to the lawsuit.\nMcDonald’s said they are not commenting on active litigation, but provided a portion of a message from the company’s US president, Joe Erlinger, addressing impacted customers:\n“I also want to address customers who ate at McDonald’s and are feeling any number of things: ill, scared, or uncertain. I know that our relationship is built on trust. You trust us to serve you safe food every time. On behalf of the McDonald’s system, I want you to hear from me: we are sorry. For those customers affected, you have my commitment that, led by our values: we will make this right.”\nCopyright 2024 KKTV via Gray Local Media, Inc.

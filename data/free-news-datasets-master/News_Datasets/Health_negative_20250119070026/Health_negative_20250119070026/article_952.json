    "text": "Trending:\n5 Signs You Are A Problem Drinker As Deaths From Alcohol Surge in the UK\nLeading public health experts in the UK have raised serious concerns after there has been a reported rise in deaths caused by drinking, which is moving towards a catastrophe. According to the Alcohol Health Alliance, deaths caused solely by alcohol have increased by 42 per cent since 2019. Read on to know a few signs that show you have become an alcoholic and need to get over it soon.\nSecrecy around alcohol manifests in the form of words as well as actions\nDoctors have raised alarm over increasing deaths due to high alcohol consumption, especially among young people, and are calling for urgent action by authorities to curb the alarming trend.\nIn the UK, statistics say deaths due to boozing have spiked by a catastrophic 42 per cent since 2019, the Alcohol Health Alliance wrote in an open letter. \"Such a devastating rise in the death rate has never been seen before,\" the letter read. Members of the Alliance—made of medical royal colleges, charities, treatment providers, and aca—have also intimated to the UK Health Secretary Wes Steering, mentioning the toll of alcohol on the young population.\nAccording to the AHA, nearly 9,000 people lost their lives to alcohol in 2023, and the future looks pretty bleak. The true toll is likely three times higher, it stated. The letter noted that there are almost 950,000 hospital admissions in England every year related to alcohol, accounting for at least 6 per cent of all hospitalizations.\nSigns you are an alcohol addict\nWhile the holiday season has just begun, the upcoming Christmas parties and get-togethers may bring a surge in alcohol drinking. To know whether you are addicted to it, read here.\nYou do not drink in the open\nWhile people may know you drink, if you have been lying or covering up your alcohol intake when you are around friends and family, you are guzzling too much alcohol—more than you should.\nAccording to experts, secrecy around alcohol manifests in the form of words as well as actions. If you have been hiding cans and bottles from your loved ones, there is an addiction issue here.\nYou are not able to stop.\nIf you start drinking and don’t know when to stop, it is a big red flag when it comes to drinking. Feeling unable to cut down—even if you think you are doing it too much—is another indicator of an addiction issue that needs quick resolution.\nYou drink alone\nWhen you are drinking socially with friends, colleagues, or family, there is always a set limit. However, if you have begun boozing alone and also enjoying it, there should be concerns.\nAccording to experts, even though a small amount daily can help you relax and destress if you have been guzzling on booze daily, you need to attend a de-addiction center.\nYour family and friends are concerned.\nIf your loved ones have told you on one or more occasions about your drinking being an issue and have shown concerns about your health, it should tell you how much of an alcoholic you have become.\nYour loved ones are always the first people to notice changes in your behaviour.\nDrinking is taking a toll on work and relationships\nIf your drinking problem has begun leaching on your work, family, and social relationships, it is becoming a major issue that needs to be sorted out soon.\nDoctors say it could also mean that you do not reach work on time or have been quarrelling with your partner or friends on the issue.

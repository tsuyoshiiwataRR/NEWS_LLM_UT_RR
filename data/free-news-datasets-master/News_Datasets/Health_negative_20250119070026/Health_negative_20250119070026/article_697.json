    "text": "TAMPA — The Lightning are expected to be without defenseman J.J. Moser for another eight to 10 weeks as he recovers from a lower-body injury sustained Dec. 12 at Calgary.\nWhen the Lightning first placed Moser on injured reserve, coach Jon Cooper said he considered him week to week. The new timetable projects Moser to return after the 4 Nations Faceoff break in late February.\nMoser has been a major addition to the Lightning blue line after being acquired over the summer in the trade that sent defenseman Mikhail Sergachev to Utah and also netted 20-year-old forward Conor Geekie.\nMoser, 24, has contributed to better defensive play and is averaging 19:54 of ice time playing mostly in a top-pairing role on his off side on the right alongside star Victor Hedman. Moser also has played a role on the Lightning’s penalty kill and their second power-play unit.\nMoser’s plus-13 ranks second among Lightning defensemen, trailing only Ryan McDonagh’s plus-17. He has two goals, including one shorthanded, and eight assists.\nMoser left the Calgary game late in the second period after falling to the ice while chasing a loose puck along with Flames forward Nazem Kadri into the defensive end. The injury did not require surgery.\nIn Moser’s absence, right-shot defenseman Darren Raddysh has moved next to Hedman, a spot he played frequently last season. Raddysh entered Thursday with two assists in his last three games with a plus-5 since his playing time spiked.\nThe Lightning called up Steven Santini from AHL Syracuse to give them an extra right-side defenseman while out in Western Canada last week when Erik Cernak was out. Crunch right-shot defenseman Max Crozier also would have been on the short list of potential call-ups had he not been injured, but he is expected to return at the end of next week.\nThe Lightning have existing cap space, about $1.6 million according to PuckPedia, so in order to use the space that Moser’s injury could create (he carries a $3.375 million cap hit) by going on long-term injured reserve, they’d have to add contract from the minors to surpass the cap threshold before they can use LTIR.\nBut for now, it appears likely the Lightning will stick with their existing defensemen options, carrying six defensemen and 21 active players, and keeping the cap space for potential future use.\n• • •\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

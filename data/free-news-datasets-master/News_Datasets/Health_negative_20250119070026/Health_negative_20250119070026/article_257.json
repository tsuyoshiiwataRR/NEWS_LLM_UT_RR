    "text": "(Gray News) - Public health officials are investigating two possible cases of bird flu in cats that consumed recalled raw milk.\nAccording to a news release from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, the two indoor-living cats consumed a raw milk product linked to a recall of raw milk and cream products from Raw Farm, LLC.\nAfter consumption, the cats reportedly showed symptoms of lack of appetite, fever and neurologic signs. The infected cats died after severe worsening of their illness and subsequently tested positive for Influenza A - a rare result in cats, officials say.\nThere have been no human cases of bird flu associated with exposure to these cats yet identified.\nWhile a confirmatory test is pending in these two cases, a nationwide H5 bird flu outbreak has seen other cats infected with the virus after consuming infected raw milk.\nHealth officials say cats may be exposed to H5 bird flu by consuming infected birds or other animals, being in environments contaminated with the virus, and consuming unpasteurized milk from infected cows.\nHealth officials encourage residents to avoid consuming raw milk and to not feed it to their pets, including frozen raw milk products.\nSymptoms of H5 bird flu infection in humans include eye redness or discharge, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, trouble breathing and fever.\nAnyone who has consumed these specific recalled raw milk products and is experiencing symptoms should immediately contact their health care provider or local health department.\nCopyright 2024 Gray Local Media, Inc.

    "text": "“It will make nursing home care harder to access for the average person,” said Rene Eastman, vice president for policy and finance at LeadingAge Wisconsin, which represents nursing homes.\nUnder final rules announced by the Biden administration last month , nursing homes will have to provide at least 3 hours, 29 minutes of nursing care per resident each day, including at least 33 minutes by registered nurses and at least 2 hours, 27 minutes by nurse aides. An RN always will have to be on-site.\nPeople are also reading… Wisconsin football, quarterback recruit part ways Wisconsin men's basketball starting guard 'feeling better and better every day' Lake Geneva officials discuss whether to continue church parking program Polzin: Why the Wisconsin men's basketball team is tough to beat when 'aggressive Steve' comes to play DNR to host career fairs across Wisconsin Wisconsin men's basketball New Zealand signee's official visit backed 'everything that I've been hearing' Like a 'funeral wake': Dick and Jake Leinenkugel lament loss of historic Chippewa Falls brewery Lake Geneva Schools announce results of school report cards Walworth County in need of more available housing Inmate dies at federal prison in Oxford in central Wisconsin Heartland Country Village nursing home closing in Black Earth IRS is sending out automatic stimulus payments Athletes of the week Wisconsin men's basketball experiences beneficial 'game pressure' vs. Ohio State Leslie Charleson, ‘General Hospital’s’ Dr. Monica Quartermaine, dies at 79 The rules, which start to take effect in 2026 and include some exemptions, will “significantly reduce the risk of unsafe and low-quality care,” the administration said. A consumer group applauded the move as an “ important first step in ensuring that all residents have their care needs met,” but pushed for higher staffing mandates .\nNursing home groups say the rules unfairly apply to all kinds of facilities , regardless of size and what kinds of residents they have . Bills before Congress would reduce the requirements .\nOn Friday, the American Health Care Association, the Texas Health Care Association and three nursing homes filed a lawsuit challenging the rules , saying they create “impossible-to-meet standards that will harm thousands of nursing homes and the vulnerable Americans they serve” and exceed the authority of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n“It’s a simplistic approach to a really complex problem, dealing with labor availability and economics,” said Rick Abrams, CEO of the Wisconsin Health Care Association, which represents nursing homes.\nIn this photo from March 2023, Betty Roberts, with former husband, Tom, left, gets a look at her room for the first time at Oakwood Village’s new nursing home facility, Hebron Oaks, on Madison's West Side. Roberts died this January at age 103.\nAMBER ARNOLD, STATE JOURNAL ARCHIVES",

    "text": "[said](https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/frito-lay-issues-limited-recall-undeclared-milk-lays-classic-potato-chips-distributed-oregon-and)Thursday.\nIn a statement posted on the FDA website, Frito Lay said it is recalling 6,344 of 13 oz. bags of Lay’s Classic Potato Chips that may contain undeclared milk.\n“Those with an allergy or severe sensitivity to milk run the risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume the recalled product,” the statement said.\nFrito-Lay said it took action and issued the recall after a consumer alerted the company.\nNo allergic reactions related to the product have been reported to date.\n“The product included in this recall was distributed to certain retail stores and e-commerce distributors in Oregon and Washington,” the snack food company said.\n“Consumers would have been able to purchase these chips as early as November 3, 2024.”\nThe affected packages are 13 oz. bags of Lay’s Classic Potato Chips with an UPC of 2840031041—the affected bags must have both a “guaranteed fresh” date of Feb. 11, 2025, and one of two manufacturing codes: 6462307xx or 6463307xx, with the x’s being any random number.\nNo other Lay’s products, flavors, sizes or variety packs are recalled, the company said.\nPeople who are allergic to milk or are lactose intolerant should not consume the product, the alert said.\nFrito-Lay is encouraging people who may have bought the recalled chips to discard them immediately.\n[lactose intolerance](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lactose-intolerance/symptoms-causes/syc-20374232)are unable to fully digest the sugar (lactose) in milk and other dairy products containing milk, leading to a bloated feeling, stomach cramps, gas, diarrhea, nausea, and sometimes vomiting.\nA milk allergy is different, as it is the immune system responding to the intake of milk and dairy products containing milk—as such, it can have more serious consequences.\n“Signs and symptoms of milk allergy range from mild to severe and can include wheezing, vomiting, hives and digestive problems,” according to the Mayo Clinic. Other symptoms include an itching or tingling feeling around the lips or mouth, swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat, coughing, shortness of breath, and vomiting.\nIn some cases, a milk allergy can also trigger anaphylaxis, a severe, life-threatening reaction that narrows the airways and can block breathing, similar to peanut allergy.\nThe primary treatment for a milk allergy is simply to avoid products that may contain milk.",

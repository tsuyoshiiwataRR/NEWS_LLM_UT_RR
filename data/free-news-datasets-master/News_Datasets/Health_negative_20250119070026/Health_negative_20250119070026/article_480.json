    "text": "By Wwj Newsroom ,\n4 hours ago\nMACOMB TWP. (WWJ) — An investigation is underway after a high-speed crash involving an Uber driver in Macomb County Thursday afternoon.\nIt happened shortly after 2:30 p.m. near the intersection of Hall and Heydenreich Roads in Macomb Township, according to the Macomb County Sheriff’s Office.\nOfficials say a white Chevy Bolt was traveling west on Hall at “a high rate of speed” on the righthand shoulder/grass as a teal Ford Taurus was turning right into the business complex at the intersection.\nThe Chevy slammed into the passenger side of the Ford as it was making the turn, forcing the Taurus into a nearby SUV.\nThe driver of the Bolt, a 37-year-old from Shelby Township, was driving an Uber passenger at the time of the crash, according to the sheriff’s office. Both the driver and passenger were taken to the hospital with minor injuries.\nA 55-year-old Macomb Township man driving the Taurus was taken to the hospital in critical condition, officials said.\nThe driver of the SUV was uninjured.\nAuthorities say alcohol does not appear to be a factor in the crash.\nThe sheriff’s office is still investigating.\n14",

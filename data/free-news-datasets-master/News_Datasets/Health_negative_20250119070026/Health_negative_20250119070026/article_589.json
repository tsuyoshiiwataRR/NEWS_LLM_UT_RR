    "text": "Sexual and gender minority [caregivers](https://www.mcknights.com/news/families-press-for-nationwide-essential-caregiver-rights/), especially those who are bisexual, experience poorer social connections compared to their counterparts who are straight. The same is true in people who are not caregivers, the study shows.\nThe [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2828025) was published Dec. 13 in JAMA Network Open.\nResearchers examined data on 43,693 adults in the United States, not all of whom were caregivers. Nearly 52% were female at birth.\nTransgender caregivers were more likely than cisgender [a person whose gender identity corresponds with the sex registered for them at birth] caregivers to report loneliness. Bisexual caregivers and caregivers identifying as something else were significantly more likely to report that they experienced a lack of social and emotional support compared to straight caregivers. The same was true for people who were bisexual, transgender and identified as something else who weren’t caregivers compared with straight people who weren’t caregivers.\nOverall, there was a significantly higher risk of loneliness among caregivers across all sexual and gender minorities compared to their straight counterparts.\nAmong caregivers and those who weren’t caregivers, loneliness was more likely in lesbian or gay individuals, bisexual individuals, and those who identified otherwise (not straight) compared to straight individuals.\nPoor social connections were defined as experiencing loneliness and having a lack of social and emotional support. The caregivers were unpaid informal caregivers. As of 2020, more than one-fifth of adults in the US play some role in this type of caregiving, and the number is expected to rise.\nWhile caring for a family member can reinforce bonds, it can put demands on the caregiver that make it hard to maintain other relationships, the authors noted. Sexual and gender minority individuals are less likely to have a partner or be married, are less apt to have children and more likely to live alone compared to people their age who are straight.",

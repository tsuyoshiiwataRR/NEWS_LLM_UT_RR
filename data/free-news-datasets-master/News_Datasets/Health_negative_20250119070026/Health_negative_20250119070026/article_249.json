    "text": "The Depo-Provera birth control shot has been linked to an increased risk of a type of brain tumors known as meningiomas.\nWomen who received the Depo shot and were diagnosed with meningioma brain tumors may be eligible to file a lawsuit and receive compensation for their illnesses.\nDepo-Provera Linked to Meningioma Brain Tumors\nDepo-Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) is a type of birth control shot designed to prevent pregnancy using the hormone progestin. The shot is sold under the brand names Depo-Provera and Depo-SubQ Provera 104, as well as “authorized generic” versions.\nAccording to a study published earlier this year by the British Medical Journal (BMJ), women who used the Depo-Provera shot face an increased risk of being diagnosed with meningioma. Researchers involved in the BMJ study found that users of the Depo shot were 5.76-times more likely to be diagnosed with these tumors.\nMeningiomas are a type of benign tumor that can form near the brain or spinal cord. Although meningiomas are non-cancerous, patients who are diagnosed with these tumors may be forced to undergo surgery in order to have them removed, which can increase the risk of serious complications.\nPatients who develop meningioma may experience symptoms that can include blurry vision, headaches, numbness, and seizures.\nLawsuits Against Depo-Provera by Women with Meningioma Brain Tumors\nThe first Depo-Provera lawsuit against Pfizer, the manufacturer of the birth control shot, was filed in October 2024 by a woman who was diagnosed with meningioma tumors.\nSince this first claim was filed, several more lawsuits against Depo-Provera have been filed in California, Pennsylvania, and other states by women who were diagnosed with brain tumors after using the Depo shot.\nThese lawsuits have alleged that the Pfizer failed to properly warn women who used Depo-Provera and their doctors about the long-term health risks of using the birth control shot, including the risk of developing meningioma brain tumors.\nWomen With Brain Tumors May Qualify to File a Depo-Provera Lawsuit\nIf you or a loved one used Depo-Provera or alternate version of the birth control shot (including Depo-SubQ Provera 104 or “authorized generic” versions) for 12 months or more and have been diagnosed with meningioma brain tumors, you may be entitled to file a lawsuit and receive compensation for your illness.\nThe first step in filing a Depo-Provera lawsuit is to contact a law firm with experience handling lawsuits involving side effects from birth control.\nAfter contacting a lawyer about your claim, your attorney or one of the female staff members at their law firm will help you to confidentially review your medical history and to help you determine whether you are eligible to take legal action.\nFor women who qualify to file a claim, your attorney can help you to gather all of the relevant medical records and other evidence to prove your claim in court and help you receive the compensation to which you are entitled to under the law.\nSee more »\nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations.

    "text": "BOISE, Idaho â€” A domesticated bull elk at a facility in Madison County tested positive for Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), marking a first of its kind.\nThe Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA) said the bull elk died at the facility and test samples were sent to the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL). On Thursday, the department said it received confirmation that CWD was detected in a deceased bull elk.\nISDA said the animal was from a facility in Alberta, Canada, and it was sent with a group of elk to an Idaho ranch in March 2023. The department said the animals were approved for import.\n\"Shortly after the shipment was received in Idaho, the origin ranch in Alberta confirmed a CWD-positive elk on the premises,\" ISDA wrote in a news release. \"Once ISDA was notified of the CWD-positive elk from the Canadian ranch, the shipment that arrived in Idaho was placed under a protective quarantine to restrict further movement of the CWD-exposed animals.\"\nThe remaining elk are still alive and will remain under quarantine, the department said.\nAs previously reported, CWD was first detected in Idaho deer in 2021 .\nChronic Wasting Disease is a neurological illness that causes symptoms in animals including excessive salivation, drooping head or ears, tremors, low body weight, and odd behavior, like showing no fear of humans and lack of coordination. Fish and Game noted, however, that deer and other animals can be infected months or years before exhibiting symptoms.\nCWD is always fatal, and there are no treatments or vaccines.\n\"No CWD infections in people have been reported. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends that people do not eat meat from CWD affected animals,\" ISDA wrote.\nClose Ad",

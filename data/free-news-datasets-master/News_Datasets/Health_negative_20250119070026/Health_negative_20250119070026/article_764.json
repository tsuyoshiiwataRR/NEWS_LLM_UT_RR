    "text": "Kansas sees surge in out-of-state abortion patients\nWomen from out of state accounted for 78% of abortions in Kansas during 2023\nWICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - A recent report from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment revealed a significant increase in the number of women crossing state lines into Kansas to get an abortion.\nThe 2023 Annual Summary of Vital Statistics found that there were 19,467 abortions performed in Kansas last year. A number of those were out-of-state patients.\nTexas: 7,606\nKansas: 4,356\nOklahoma: 3,283\nMissouri: 3,045\nArkansas: 728\nEmily Wales with Planned Parenthood Great Plains said Kansas became a destination for people after Texas implemented its 6-week ban. In 2023, 4 in 10 abortions performed were for women from Texas.\n“Wichita has been strongly preferred by many of our patients, but it doesn’t mean we’ve always had the appointment availability there,” Wales said.\nPlanned Parenthood locations in Kansas do not have the capacity for the amount of potential patients. Wales said sometimes patients have to wait weeks to get an appointment. The President and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains said Friday and Saturday appointments fill up fast because patients who travel far have a difficult time planning between juggling childcare and their jobs.\nWhen Danielle Underwood with Kansans for Life looked at the data, she said that it’s unfortunate that there were enough lives lost in Kansas to fill Intrust Bank Arena.\n“This is the result of an abortion industry that has heartlessly exploited vulnerable women,” Underwood said.\nKansans for Life said they’re now prioritizing the health and safety of women.\nIn November, Missouri legalized the right to an abortion – but multiple lawsuits have prevented abortions from happening in the state. Once those lawsuits are finalized, Wales with Planned Parenthood believes that it should relieve pressure at Kansas clinics.\nCopyright 2024 KWCH. All rights reserved.

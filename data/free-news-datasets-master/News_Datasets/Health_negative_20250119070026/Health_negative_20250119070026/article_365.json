    "text": "Reported cases of measles have been rising steadily for the past three months in northern Morocco, raising serious concerns among healthcare professionals and families.\nThe surge in infections has become an alarming threat to children, particularly in the Tanger-Tétouan-Al Hoceïma region, where the number of cases has risen to nine.\nOf these, five fatalities occurred at the Mohammed VI University Hospital in Tanger, all involving residents of the Tanger province. Additionally, three deaths were reported in Chefchaouen, and one in Tétouan.\nAs of this year, 448 severe cases of measles have required medical attention, underscoring the severity of the ongoing health crisis.\nThe numbers are particularly alarming in the past three months. In October, 115 cases were reported; in November, 113; and in December, 104. This constant increase is expected to continue in the coming days, putting further pressure on the healthcare system.\nThe outbreak has spread beyond the major cities, with provinces such as Chefchaouen seeing hundreds of child infections.\nIn response, public health authorities have launched campaigns to raise awareness and encourage families to vaccinate children who remain unprotected against this potentially deadly disease.\nWhile no deaths have been recorded in Larache, Ouezzane, and M’diq-Fnideq, several cases of measles have been reported there as well.\nThe Ministry of Health had previously initiated a national catch-up vaccination campaign, but the current situation highlights the need for renewed efforts.",

    "text": "PORTLAND (WGME) -- A local home health care provider says it's cutting skilled pediatric services to nearly 100 children who need them.\nAndwell Health Partners blames sharp cuts in reimbursement rates from MaineCare, Medicaid and private insurers, which they say led to a more than $2 million deficit this year.\nOne parent says she was on a wait list for more than a year before she could get in-home speech therapy for her child with Down syndrome.\nShe says the wait lists now are even longer.\nAlso read: Police searching for two suspects after shots fired in South Portland Cassandra Manson's youngest two children both have Down syndrome.\nShe says her youngest, Willa, had open heart surgery five months after birth and now has severe low muscle tone.\n\"She struggles to do everyday things that are really easy for you and I, like eating, swallowing, walking, sitting up,\" Manson said.\nShe says Willa regularly sees 12 doctors and specialists.\nAdditionally, Andwell Health Partners provided a physical, occupational and speech therapist for weekly in-home visits, as well as an in-home nurse.\nAlso read: Police arrest mother, son in drug trafficking bust in Waterville and Fairfield \"It's essential for her growth and development,\" Manson said.\nShe and 96 other parents got a letter from Andwell saying in-home services would end on January 7 because they don't live in Lewiston, Auburn or along Route 202.\nIn a letter to those families, CEO Ken Albert said, \"Andwell can no longer absorb the profound multi-million-dollar financial losses associated with providing pediatric skilled home-based services to certain Maine communities.\"\n\"We're seeing an erosion of providers who are willing to take Medicaid as a payment source for providing services. There's just no way under Medicaid reimbursement to make the ends meet,\" Albert said.\nManson, who lives 13 miles from Lewiston in Bowdoin, sent a response.\nShe said, \"Willa was redlined and discharged because of the town we live in. Please explain to me why my daughter's care is more expensive than a child living several miles away from me.\"\n\"All of these kids should have equal access to the services and the health care that they deserve,\" Manson said.\nAlso read: Multi-vehicle crash in Kennebunk leaves at least 1 seriously injured Albert met with the Health and Human Services Commissioner, MaineCare Director and lawmakers, trying to get an increase in reimbursement rates.\nHe also now says they will not abandon these families.\n\"If we have not been able to effectuate a safe transfer of care, I'm not walking away from these families,” Albert said. “Our clinicians are not going to do that. We will continue to provide services until we can really manage a safe discharge of these kids.\"\n\"We agree that the root of the problem is MaineCare,” Manson said. “However, this was not a good option. This was not the right move.\"\nAlbert says they've already placed half the children into their outpatient skilled pediatric programs or other services.",

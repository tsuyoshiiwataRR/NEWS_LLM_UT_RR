    "text": "RAJKOT: A 20-year-old woman from Junagadh accused a doctor at a private hospital in Rajkot of performing an unauthorized and allegedly negligent surgery on her right leg instead of the left, for which she was undergoing treatment. The alleged act left her with persistent pain for the past six months.The woman, Sapna Patodiya, filed a complaint at Gandhigram Police Station against a vascular surgeon of Unicare Hospital, located on Jamnagar Road. The police registered the case under relevant sections of the IPC for causing grievous hurt by rash or negligent actions that endanger human life.Patodiya suffered a minor injury to her left leg during Ganpati Visarjan nearly a decade ago. Over time, the pain worsened, and her treating doctor in Junagadh, Nikunj Thummar, advised her to consult a vascular surgeon. While searching online, Patodiya came across Unicare Hospital, known for accepting Ayushman Bharat cardholders.In her complaint, Patodiya alleged that the surgeon initially prescribed a five-day course of medication, which failed to alleviate the pain. The doctor then recommended surgery. She was admitted to the hospital on April 24, and the operation was performed the following day.However, during the surgery, doctors informed her father of a lump in her right leg, which they operated on without her consent. The surgery was conducted under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY).Patodiya was discharged on April 26, and while her left leg improved, she began experiencing severe pain in her right leg. The complaint states that the doctor reportedly advised her to rest for six months without conducting further tests. Unsatisfied, she again consulted Dr Thummar, who recommended an MRI. The scan revealed surgical damage to a nerve near her right knee.When Patodiya approached Unicare Hospital with this revelation, she claimed that the hospital authorities failed to provide a satisfactory explanation. She then submitted an application for complaint at Gandhigram Police Station, which subsequently sought an expert opinion from a committee formed by Rajkot Civil Hospital.However, the hospital denied the allegations and claimed that the patient and her family were provided detailed information about the surgery.\\\"The initial admission was for a left leg condition. Following diagnostic reports, we discovered complications in both legs. The right leg condition necessitated additional surgery, which was undertaken after thorough consultation with the patient and her relatives. No objections were raised by the patient either during or after the procedures,\\\" the hospital's administration officer, Kartik Sheth told TOI.\\\"The patient filed a police complaint six weeks after the procedures, despite attending regular follow-ups during this period without expressing any concerns. We maintain proper documentation with signatures from both the patient and family members, obtained after detailed explanation of all relevant papers,\\\" he said.",

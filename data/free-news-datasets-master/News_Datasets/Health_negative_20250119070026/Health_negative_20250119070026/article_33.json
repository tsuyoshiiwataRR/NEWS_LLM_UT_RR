    "text": "Injuries from VR headset use have increased drastically, Chandler doctor warns\nVideos of people using virtual reality headsets and accidentally injuring themselves or others are all over the internet.\nThey’re usually played for laughs, but the number of people nationwide who have reported VR-related injuries at the emergency room has dramatically increased since 2017.\nThis is likely due in part to the increasing popularity of VR headsets. They’ve become more affordable in recent years, and are coupled with an expanding library of apps and games.\nThere were 125 VR-related injuries in 2017, according to data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System.\nBut by 2021, that number jumped to more than 1,300 people who sought medical attention.\nDr. Charles Hu with Dignity Health’s Chandler Trauma Center said injuries occur across all age ranges and all parts of the body, but tend to be most prominent on the hands, arms and face.\n”You have fractures, lacerations, contusions of those areas,” he said, “and on rare occasions, some devastating injuries are reported — like neck injuries.”\nHu’s advice to those planning to spend time in VR environments is simple: stay aware of your surroundings, and clear the area before playing any physically-intensive games.\n-\nThe Arizona Department of Environmental Quality has recently revamped an awareness program where organizations like schools can display color-coded flags to help communicate that day’s air quality forecast.\n-\nThe Arizona Department of Health Services has reported more than 14,000 cases of Valley fever in the state this year. That's the highest caseload the state has seen in more than a decade.\n-\nGov. Katie Hobbs calls Arizona's annual abortion reports an invasive form of government surveillance and says the law requiring them should be repealed.\n-\nA recent study from the Mayo Clinic found that caregiving can lead to bothersome menopausal symptoms — like hot flashes and night sweats — among some women.\n-\nThe Arizona Department of Health Services published a draft of its proposed rules for memory care. Members of the public are able to review the rules and have until Dec. 22 to comment.",

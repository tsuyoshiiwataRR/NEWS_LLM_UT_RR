    "text": "Healthcare delays affect Pitt County patients\nPITT COUNTY, N.C. (WITN) - Eastern North Carolina is known for its many medical options for residents due to ECU Health’s large healthcare system, but some patients are struggling to gain access.\nPatients say they’ve had to wait up to six months or more to see a general practitioner and have been unable to receive medical help as soon as they need it.\nSandra Casado was shocked at how difficult it was to see a primary care physician upon moving to Pitt County in 2023.\n“It just shouldn’t take up to a year to get seen,” Casado says.\nNow, her daughter faces the same struggles.\n“She was on a waitlist and that was quite a few months, and then they finally got her an appointment and now that same appointment has been canceled twice, and they rescheduled her for February,” Casado says.\nAnd Casado isn’t the only one.\nPitt County residents say general practitioners and specialists are booked months in advance.\nThey feel they have nowhere to turn for their medical needs, waiting months for an appointment and months to find results.\nMany say they feel their health is at risk, and emergency room visits are too costly as a second option.\nBrandy Galloway, a nurse practitioner in Ayden, says, “Unfortunately, you’d think, with a huge medical school here in town that there’d be a surplus of physicians and PA’s and NP’s. There’s really not.”\nGalloway says this is because patients from neighboring counties rely on Pitt County’s healthcare system, which creates an unequal physician-to-patient ratio.\nShe says she sees patients in need of immediate care for routine illnesses who aren’t able to access their physicians.\n“It’s crazy because they’re waiting six months at least to be seen and just primary care, not a specialist, just primary access to healthcare,” Galloway says.\nGalloway runs a direct primary care clinic in Ayden where patients can pay a monthly membership to have more immediate access to their healthcare.\nEven so, that’s not a solution, as a state of health care report from ECU health shows a rural health care crisis, with rural health care overburdened and under-resourced.\nGalloway says healthcare is complicated and there isn’t one easy solution to the delays, but patients say they’re desperate for medical help without the wait.\nCopyright 2024 WITN.

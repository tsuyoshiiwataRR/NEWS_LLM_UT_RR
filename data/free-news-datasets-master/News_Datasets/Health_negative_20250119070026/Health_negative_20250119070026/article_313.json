    "text": "AXTELL, Neb. — According to the CDC, from about 2011 to 2023, there were almost no bird flu cases detected in people, but if you take a look at the numbers for this year, things have changed dramatically.\n“They’re in the eastern part of the state, so Nemaha County over on the eastern edge of Nebraska had an infection. And then Sarpy County and Lancaster County had them,” Ron Seymour, UNL Extension Educator, said.\nSeymour added that H5N1 spreads easily and can be deadly to poultry.\n\"There's about seven different strains of bird flu that is out there, and it is highly communicable. It spread in our environment by wildlife, primarily by birds that are migrating so ducks and geese,\" Seymour said.\n“On poultry, specifically, I mean, they say if they get the flu virus, they can start to not feel well, you can see that they're not drinking water. They might have a runny nose or a cough, just kind of like humans if they get a cold or any other virus like that. And then they have, rest, respiratory issues, they can get watery eyes, and they can die very easily and very quickly,” Seymour said.\nSeymour said that you should drink pasteurized milk, and farmers should use good sanitation practices like routinely washing your hands and wearing an N95 mask around livestock and poultry.",

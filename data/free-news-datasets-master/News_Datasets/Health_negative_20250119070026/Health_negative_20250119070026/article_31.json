    "text": "The Homer G. Phillips Nurses Alumni Association is steadfast in saying it never opposed the opening of an urgent care center at Jefferson and Cass.\nIts trade infringement lawsuit against developer Paul McKee was filed to strip the name “Homer G. Phillips Hospital” from its walls.\nRecent happenings at the facility show that the name of Homer G. Phillips is being disgraced by what has transpired within its walls.\nKSDK reported on Tuesday that the center had furloughed employees because of a blood shortage, according to a letter from its board of directors.\nIn addition, its staff had not been paid for their work recently.\nYvonne Jones, Homer G. Phillips Nurses Alumni, Inc., president said, “It is situations such as this that tarnish the legacy and legend of “the Honorable Attorney Homer G. Phillips” and pride and reputation that the hospital holds so dearly.”\n“Our soul goal is to remove the name of Homer G. Phillips from this building and to protect the legacy of a world-renowned hospital and keep its name in the historic “Ville” neighborhood\nJones said her organization empathizes with the furloughed employees “and pray that you will be compensated and find employment soon.”\nMcKee “Northside Regeneration” project has been littered with trouble since its inception, and projects including a grocery store and retail developments near the new NGA headquarters have failed or never materialized.\n“We have seen time and time again that projects initiated by Paul McKee end in disaster in St. Louis,” said Zenobia Thompson, a Change The Name Coalition co-chair.\n“It is tragic that the revered name of Attorney Homer G. Phillips is associated with a controversy of this nature.”\nMayor Tishaura O. Jones said, “The closure of this hospital right before the holidays represents another failure from Bob Clark and Paul McKee, two developers whose reckless disregard for our city continues to impede needed progress on the North side.”\nSt. Louis Health Director Dr. Matifadza Hlatshwayo Davis, MD, MPH, FIDSA, said the name Homer G. Phillips “carries profound historical significance for St. Louis and the Black community.”\n“For decades, the original Homer G. Phillips Hospital was a beacon of health equity, training, and excellence in serving marginalized communities during a time when segregation limited access to quality care.\n“It is a name that symbolizes advocacy for justice and equity in healthcare. That legacy makes today’s developments even more devastating, as they represent yet another missed opportunity to honor the name with the respect it deserves.”\nHomer G. Phillips Hospital opened in 1937 following the crusading work of local Black attorney Homer G. Phillips. It closed in 1979, with city officials disregarding the pleas of the Black community.\nAt its peak, the 600-bed facility was one of the largest hospitals in the country. It employed 1,000 Black skilled and semi-skilled health care workers, including hundreds of orderlies, aides, janitors, and ambulance drivers. In addition, it provided a training facility for educating nurses and housing.\nFor a period of 20 years, 75% of all Black doctors in the country interned at Homer G. Phillips Hospital. By 1961, it had trained the largest number of Black doctors and nurses in the world.\nLegal fight continues\nThe Nurses Association is appealing a Sept. 6, 2024, ruling allowing developer McKee to continue use of the Homer G. Phillips name.\nProtest rallies are also continuing on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month, weather permitting, and supports vow to continue the fight.\nJudge Heather R. Cunningham was greeted by a packed courtroom when she entered her chambers on August 8 for a hearing on the trade infringement lawsuit against McKee. Despite an impassioned legal presentation by attorney Rick Voytas, Cunningham returned less than a month later with her decision.\n“We will continue to pursue, through legal means, our efforts to remove the name from this building,” said Jones.\n“Homer G. Phillips Nurses Alumni, Inc. is the only entity in the United States that has a licensed trademark on the name “Homer G. Phillips,” said Thompson.\n“Judge Cuningham’s recent decision is a flagrant violation of trademark laws.”",

She was known to pluck grapes from a bunch one at a time with her dexterous lips and had a funny habit of balancing snacks on the back of her paws to nibble at daintily.\"\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Black bears can live for up to 30 years in the wild, but they typically die before reaching their 20s, according to the National Wildlife Federation.\nSuzie celebrated her 30th birthday in August, complete with presents and a towering cake of fresh fruit.\nThe park is located in Gray and overseen by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. Formerly known as the Game Park, the site adopted the name \"Maine Wildlife Park\" in 1998 — three years after Suzie's arrival.\nThe park announced Suzie's death on Facebook shortly after noon and within hours, the post had garnered an outpouring of support, with commenters sharing condolences and memories of the beastly beauty.\n\"When I would go I would wave at her and she would come over and stand up like she was saying hi,\" one commenter said.\nCopy the Story Link\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 20,000 people played the daily Crossword recently.

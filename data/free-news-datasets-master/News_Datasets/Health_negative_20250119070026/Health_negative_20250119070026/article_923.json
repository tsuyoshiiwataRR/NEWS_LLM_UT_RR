( KOIN ) — Low-income Clark County residents have ranked food assistance as their top area of need.\nThe county’s Community Services department uncovered the results of its Community Needs Assessment — which was conducted in 2023 from Feb. 2 to April 14 — earlier this week. Officials received nearly 900 responses from households that identify as having low income.\nPacifiCorp’s rate increase reduced to 8.5% in 2025 by Oregon Public Utility Commission\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement The survey asked residents to rank their overall needs, based on a list of options including mental health support, child care and LGBTQ+ services. According to the results, 87% of participants ranked food assistance as their top priority.\nDental services ranked in second place with 81%, while housing assistance ranked at No. 3 with 80%. Asset building and utility assistance rounded out the top five of overall needs.\nAfter conducting the survey, Clark County hosted community forms to learn more about the results. The report shows a majority of forum attendees were not surprised by low-income households’ top priorities, but some were shocked that dental services placed so highly — while others suggested childcare, culturally-informed services and language should have ranked higher.\nOregon doctor urges vaccinations as flu cases nearly double statewide\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Officials noted that some responses were more common for participants within a particular demographic.\nFor example, respondents over 55 years old were less likely to prioritize their needs in any area other than senior services. Data also show that domestic violence services were most likely to be prioritized by those with the lowest levels of education, Medicare and Medicaid recipients and participants who identified as non-white or Hispanic or Latino.\nThe Community Services department last surveyed low-income residents from Nov. 1, 2019 through Jan. 31, 2020. Then, housing assistance, food assistance and asset building were ranked as the top needs for low-income households.\nOregon Attorney General-elect Rayfield creates federal oversight cabinet\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in U.S. Wisconsin school shooter was in contact with a California man accused of planning separate attack, report says CNN Passengers panic as American Airlines flight ‘floods’ in midair: ‘New fear unlocked’ NY Post Ex-Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson facing warrants for arrest in Texas USA TODAY Sports Highest-earning NYPD cop with OT-fueled $400,000 salary retires following Daily News exposé NY Daily News The latest assessment “places a heightened focus on emerging needs and challenges” since the COVID-19 pandemic and its repercussions, Clark County representatives wrote in the report.\n“It seeks to understand the interplay between various factors affecting low-income communities, including employment barriers, educational access, housing affordability, healthcare accessibility, and the overall social support system,” officials added. “This perspective aims to inform the development of targeted, effective policies and programs that address the root causes of poverty and economic disenfranchisement in Clark County.”\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "text": "The Maryland Department of Health reported the first three cold-related deaths of the 2024-2025 winter season, urged precautions to prevent cold-related illnesses, and provided resources for warming centers, safe heating practices, and winter weather safety.\nPer the news release: “The Maryland Department of Health today reported the firs​t three cold-related illness deaths in Maryland for the 2024-2025 winter weather season. The deceased individuals were all adult males, two in their 60’s and one in their 30’s. Two of the deaths occurred in Baltimore City and one in Baltimore County. The first cold-reported death occurred Nov. 23, with the other two reported on Dec. 2.\nTo prevent the onset of cold-related illness, including frostbite, Marylanders should avoid exposure to cold weather, both by limiting time outside and by wearing several layers of lightweight, insulated clothing. Insulate toes, fingers, ears, cheeks, and the tip of the nose.\nMarylanders in need of warming centers or overnight shelter are encouraged to contact their local health department or to call 2-1-1 and provide their county location and ZIP code to get information about locations, hours of operation, and available accommodations.\nMarylanders should use caution while using various heat sources to stay warm. Some heating sources can cause fires, electrical injuries, burns, or carbon monoxide poisoning if not installed, operated, and maintained properly. Check heat sources to ensure they are safe prior to use, install carbon monoxide detectors, and never use an oven as a heat source for the home.\nMore resources to help stay safe in cold weather—including cold-related illness surveillance reports, information about how to prevent cold-related illnesses, how to safely heat your home, and how to drive safely in winter weather—are available via the Office of Preparedness and Response’s Extreme Cold website .”",

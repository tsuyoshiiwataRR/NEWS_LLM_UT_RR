    "text": "Fewer people are enrolling in ACA marketplace plans than last year, according to CMS data.\nAs of Dec. 4, 5.4 million people had enrolled in federal ACA marketplace plans. During the same time last year, 7.3 million people had enrolled in individual coverage.\nThe agency reported about 988,000 new consumers on the marketplace, down from 1.6 million new enrollees in 2023.\nEnrollment in the ACA marketplace has grown rapidly since 2021, when enhanced subsidies were introduced, making premiums more affordable for many. In 2024, 21.5 million people enrolled in ACA coverage, the highest number since the marketplace launched in 2014.\nHere are three things to know:\n- CMS\n[extended](https://www.beckerspayer.com/policy-updates/cms-extends-aca-enrollment-deadline.html)the deadline to enroll in coverage that begins Jan. 1 by three days in response to slow enrollment. Open enrollment runs until Jan. 15. - In July, CMS\n[issued](https://www.beckerspayer.com/policy-updates/cms-cracks-down-on-unauthorized-aca-broker-activity.html)new policies intended to block agents and brokers from making unauthorized changes to individual splan enrollment. In the first half of 2024, the agency received more than 100,000 complaints from individuals enrolled in an ACA plan without their knowledge. - A federal judge\n[halted](https://www.beckerspayer.com/policy-updates/judge-blocks-aca-coverage-for-daca-recipients-3-things-to-know.html)new regulations allowing individuals who are part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to enroll in ACA marketplace plans in the middle of open enrollment. CMS estimated 100,000 uninsured DACA recipients could have received coverage throught the marketplace.",

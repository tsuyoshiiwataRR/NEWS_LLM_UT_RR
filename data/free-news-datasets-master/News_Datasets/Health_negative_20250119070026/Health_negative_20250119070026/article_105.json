    "text": "By Annette Cary ,\n10 hours ago\nThe Benton Franklin Health District gave five failing grades in food safety inspections of restaurants and other establishments selling food in the Tri-Cities area Dec. 7-13.\nThe health district’s food safety team gave passing grades on 62 inspections, with 32 of those earning perfect scores.\nAsian Gardens in Pasco , which was closed by the health district on Nov. 25 due to a cockroach infestation, was still working toward reopening as of Thursday.\nIn the district’s routine inspections, businesses or organizations that receive at least 35 points for the more serious red violations are required to have additional inspections and must meet a tougher standard on those.\nTo pass followup inspections, they must have fewer than 25 red points and fewer than 10 repeat red points for previous issues.\nScores of 85 or more red points result in establishments remaining on probation until they pass two follow-up inspections, the first one within 72 hours.\nRed violations are those most likely to cause food-borne illnesses, such as not keeping hot food hot enough or cold food cold enough, inadequate handwashing or bare-hand contact with foods.\nBlue violations are low risk factors related to the cleanliness and physical condition of an establishment.\nNo notice is given before the inspections.\nBusinesses may have separate inspections of business lines with different health safety risks, such as grocery sales and a deli that prepares food.\nInspection results are posted online so residents can look up the status and the details of any violations of individual restaurants or check other businesses.\nGo to bit.ly/BFHDinspections . Click on the business name and then on the date of the inspection on the right half of the next page. Look for the “Violations” tab.\nFor questions or complaints about food safety in Benton or Franklin counties, email contactusfoodsafety@BFHD.WA.GOV .\nTo participate in the health district’s food safety topics survey, go to bit.ly/BFHDfoodsafetysurvey.\nFailed inspections Auntie Anne’s Pretzels , 1321 N.

    "text": "United States District Judge Thomas O. Rice has mandated that three dairies in the Lower Yakima Valley conduct well testing and provide safe drinking water to residents at risk from nitrate-contaminated wells. This decision follows a motion for preliminary injunction by the United States, as announced by U.S. Attorney Vanessa R. Waldref.\nThe action is part of a lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice in June 2024 under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The lawsuit claims that these dairies have contributed to nitrate contamination in the area's groundwater, posing health risks such as methemoglobinemia, also known as \"blue baby syndrome.\"\nJudge Rice's order requires the dairies to test drinking water wells within a 3.5-mile radius downgradient of their locations and provide reverse-osmosis water treatment systems or bottled water where nitrate levels exceed 10 milligrams per liter. Additionally, the dairies must monitor groundwater and check a lined lagoon for leaks.\nThis legal action aims to address ongoing contamination issues and enforce compliance with a 2013 agreement between the dairies and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). U.S. Attorney Waldref emphasized, “Everyone deserves access to clean, safe drinking water.”\nDan Opalski from EPA’s Region 10 office expressed commitment to working with various stakeholders to tackle nitrate contamination challenges in the region.\nResidents are encouraged to visit EPA’s Lower Yakima Valley Groundwater webpage for information on affected areas and upcoming well testing offers. The court has given dairies 30 days to submit a testing plan and 60 days post-approval for completion.\nFor those outside the impacted area, free well testing is available through local initiatives.",

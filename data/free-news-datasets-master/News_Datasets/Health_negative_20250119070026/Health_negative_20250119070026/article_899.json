Booth Rand, general counsel at the Arkansas Insurance Department, (right) answers a question from a lawmaker during a legislative subcommittee meeting on Dec. 19, 2024. He is seated with (left to right) Allison Hatfield, chief of staff for the state Department of Commerce, Jake Windley, director of legislative affairs and policies for the department of commerce, and Alan McClain, Arkansas Insurance Commissioner. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)\nThis story was update at 7:30 p.m. to add a statement from the governor’s office.\nArkansas lawmakers on Thursday rejected a proposed rule that would have allowed pharmacists to be paid a dispensing fee by drug middlemen who reimburse them for prescription costs.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Members of the Administrative Rules subcommittee of the Arkansas Legislative Council spent about two hours questioning the Insurance Department’s legal counsel about the necessity for the proposal before rejecting it by voice vote. There was at least one audible dissent.\nThe rule would have allowed the insurance commissioner to determine the amount health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) would have to tack on to reimbursements to pharmacists, department legal counsel Booth Rand told lawmakers Thursday.\nThe dispensing fee could range from zero to a maximum of $10 based on data collected from PBMs and other interested parties, Rand said. An earlier survey of health plans projected an increase in health premiums between 3% and 4% if the dispensing fee was $9.\nThe rule was intended to replace an emergency rule approved in September that expires in mid-January. The emergency measure authorized the Insurance Department to review reimbursement rates to “ensure that pharmacies will at least be paid [federally determined] minimums” and to add a dispensing fee if the commissioner determines a pharmacy’s reimbursement “is not fair and reasonable.” A 2015 state law regulating PBMs, requires reimbursements to be “fair and reasonable” but doesn’t define the term.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement In response to a question from Rep. Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado, Rand said the department has the authority to collect the data without the rule, “but if the commissioner decided to impose a fee, the PBMs could object that there’s no rule in place authorizing it.”\nPBMs are companies that negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers.\nThe nation’s three largest PBMs — CVS Caremark, OptumRX and Express Scripts — are owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the prescription market in the United States, according to a Federal Trade Commission interim study released in July.\nCurrent PBM practices are “unfair and unreasonable, not only to independent pharmacies but chain pharmacies as well,” Rep. Stephanie Flowers, D-Pine Bluff, said Thursday. Ultimately, this affects “our constituents,” patients who don’t know who to complain to if their pharmacy closes or they have an issue with prescription payments by their insurer, she said.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in U.S. Wisconsin school shooter was in contact with a California man accused of planning separate attack, report says CNN Passengers panic as American Airlines flight ‘floods’ in midair: ‘New fear unlocked’ NY Post Ex-Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson facing warrants for arrest in Texas USA TODAY Sports Highest-earning NYPD cop with OT-fueled $400,000 salary retires following Daily News exposé NY Daily News “When you control 80% of the prescriptions,” Flowers said of PBMs, “you have control over determining the formularies, you silence your pharmacists who must contract with you because you control all of the prescriptions, you own pharmacies, you own insurance companies … How do we ensure what is fair and reasonable within the law since they basically control the business, control the market, control reimbursements?”\nAllison Hatfield, Commerce Department chief of staff, responded, “We see this rule as a mechanism to enforce the fair and reasonable language in the law.”\nAsked by subcommittee co-chair Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, how that would increase the cost of business, Hatfield replied “there would be no change,” if a PBM is paying a fair and reasonable reimbursement rate.\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Some lawmakers said they also viewed the proposal as giving the insurance commissioner blanket authority to impose a fee without further legislative input.\n Rule-making should occur within the constraints of existing law, Shepherd said, but “shouldn’t be viewed as blank-check authority.”\nSens. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, and Jimmy Hickey Jr., R-Texarkana, also objected to giving the insurance commissioner the authority to levy an indeterminate dispensing fee, saying it usurps legislative authority.\n“We can’t delegate our authority to an individual,” Hickey said.\nIrvin called the proposal tantamount to levying a new tax on consumers because the cost of a dispensing fee would be passed on to them.\nAdvertisement Advertisement “I don’t agree you have the authority through the [PBM] licensing act … to create a new tax,” she said.\nIrvin said much the same thing on Monday during a five-hour debate on the proposed rule in the Joint Insurance and Commerce Committee that ended when the panel’s chairman declared the proposal reviewed.\nRepublican Sen. Mark Johnson of Little Rock asked Rand what would happen if the proposed rule failed to pass the committee.\n“You’re likely going to get a dispensing fee bill from pharmacies” in the 2025 legislative session, Rand replied.\nTuesday evening, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued a statement saying her administration will not allow PBMs “to skirt the law” and will continue to hold PBMs accountable. She cited the $1.5 million fine “we imposed on rule-breaking PBMs this summer.” The administration will also continue to work the the Legislature to “further protect Arkansans,” she said.\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 20,000 people played the daily Crossword recently.

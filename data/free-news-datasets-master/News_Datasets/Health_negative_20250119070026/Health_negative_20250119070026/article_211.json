    "text": "We’ve all experienced those late-night cravings that seem to beckon us to the fridge for a quick snack. However, before you indulge, it’s important to understand the effects of eating late at night on your body. [Studies](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/10/study-looks-at-why-late-night-eating-increases-obesity-risk/) have shown that consuming food late at night can disrupt your metabolism and blood sugar levels, potentially leading to weight gain and interfering with your sleep. For instance, research from Brigham and Women’s Hospital found that eating four hours later can significantly impact hunger levels, calorie burning, and fat storage. Additionally, a [study](https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/diet-truth-myth-eating-night-causes-weight-gain) published in the journal Obesity revealed that eating at night led to twice as much weight gain, even when total calorie intake remained the same. Let’s explore the top reasons why late-night eating can be detrimental to your health and well-being.\nYou May Be At Risk For Metabolic Syndrome/Obesity\nWhen you eat late at night, you may be at risk for metabolic syndrome or obesity. Late-night eating is associated with either eating high fat or low nutrient food which puts you at risk for this syndrome. These metabolic syndromes may include diabetes or heart disease. Did you know that your eating habits have a strong relationship to obesity? Yes! When you eat too fast or too much, it can cause rapid weight gain. This is because the calories are stored in your body as fat rather than being burned throughout the day. [According to experimental research done by experts, women are at higher risk of metabolic syndrome based on their eating habits while in men there is no correlation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6288903/). When you eat late at night, there is an increase in hunger and a decrease in your leptin levels, which puts you at risk when it comes to obesity. So, when you want to have a midnight snack, think about how this will affect your body in general. A [study](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-6262-3) by researchers at Northwestern University found that eating closer to sleep may lead to weight gain due to higher total daily caloric intake and a greater number of eating occasions.\nIt Increases Your Blood Sugar Levels\nEating late at night can disrupt your blood sugar levels leading to diabetes. [Based on an experiment conducted by professional experts, a late-night dinner may lead to higher blood glucose levels. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8308587/)When you eat at night time and wake up in the morning your blood sugar tend to rise. Our body has a natural circadian rhythm and when you eat late, you can be distorted with your natural rhythm which may lead to diabetes.This could also affect glucose balance and insulin responsiveness. There is a correlation between our eating habits and possibility of getting diabetes. Diabetes occurs when an increase in blood sugar level stems from the body’s failure to produce insulin. For example, a person with diabetes will have more complications because their body is already suffering from handling low blood sugar levels. Now if a diabetic person eats late at night, it can damage their glucose tolerance overnight leading to hyperglycemia. Did you know that one of the common causes of diabetes is an unhealthy eating pattern? Well now you know thanks to the HFR team!\nFurthermore, a [study published in the journal Diabetes Care](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/45/3/512/139258/Interplay-of-Dinner-Timing-and-MTNR1B-Type-2) found that individuals who consume late-night meals have a higher risk of developing impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. This study highlights the importance of maintaining regular eating patterns to support overall metabolic health.\nMay Affect Digestion\nWhen you lie down to go to sleep after having a late-night snack, you may have problems with digestion. This is because it is quicker for acid in the stomach to come back up into your esophagus, which may lead to heartburn or irritation. [According to several studies, you are more likely to burn less calories when you sleep than when you are awake because the process of metabolism is slowed down. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7337187/#:~:text=Late%20eating%20can%20predispose%20to,by%20circadian%20rhythm%20(9).)The food you consume late at night takes a longer time to digest which can also lead to bloating when you wake up in the morning. A person who continues to eat late at night is at risk for gastrointestinal issues. We may wonder, well it’s just food, how can this happen? This happens because you are putting too much pressure on your digestive system and exposing it to stomach acid which may lead to swelling, burning or damage to the stomach wall and throat.\nA [study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology](https://journals.lww.com/ajg/Abstract/2007/10000/Nocturnal_Reflux_Episodes_Following_the.4.aspx) found that late-night eating can exacerbate symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), further emphasizing the risks of eating close to bedtime. Another study in the journal Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care highlighted that nighttime eating is associated with metabolic dysregulation and increased risk of obesity and related health issues.\nIt Can Disturb Your Sleep Pattern\nEating too much or sugary snacks may cause you to wake up frequently overnight. Digestion takes a long process, now imagine eating food with high fat or heavy meals before you sleep. [Based on the result of experiments done by experts, it was concluded that food eaten near bedtime has a negative effect on sleep quality. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3227713/)Food with high calories and carbohydrates eaten before bedtime can increase the time it takes to fall asleep. Ideally, eating these meals approximately 4-5 hours before bedtime can decrease the time it takes to fall asleep. This will cause you to avoid restlessness while you are asleep. When you eat right before your bedtime, you are overworking the muscles that digest your food when they should be resting, this then causes your body to reach hence why you frequently wake up during your sleep. If you want a better sleep quality, remember to always avoid that late bedtime snacking. A [study published in the British Journal of Nutrition](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/associations-between-bedtime-eating-or-drinking-sleep-duration-and-wake-after-sleep-onset-findings-from-the-american-time-use-survey/72A5D22C25A35FA975A5B50991431E0C) found that eating or drinking less than one hour before bedtime is associated with longer sleep duration but increased wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO), highlighting the importance of avoiding late-night meals for uninterrupted sleep.\nIt Causes You To Make Unhealthy Food Choices\nLate-night cravings cause you to make poor food choices. Most people eat unhealthy foods such as beverages, caffeine, or sugary snacks right before bedtime. Emotional eating is another reason for people making unhealthy food choices at night time. They tend to crave high calorie food to either cope with stress or loneliness. Eating a balanced diet is the way to go! For example eating too much or little protein can cause you to have a low sleep quality. [According to research, low-energy food is not harmful to the body and is known to protect your cardio-metabolic health. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10899630/)Eating good quality food may be able to reverse the complications of eating late at night. Food such as fruits and vegetables is known to produce better sleep quality. Whenever you get the urge to eat past your bedtime, make sure to include healthy food options such as fruits or vegetables into your diet! Ideally it is not advisable to eat late at night but it is recommended that a healthy food option is much better rather than a low quality food.",

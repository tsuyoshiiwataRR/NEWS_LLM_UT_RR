    "text": "Hospitals Hospitals New building of Lalmonirhat hospital lies unused Thu Dec 19, 2024 07:47 PM\nLast update on: Thu Dec 19, 2024 08:28 PM\nS Dilip Roy Thu Dec 19, 2024 07:47 PM Last update on: Thu Dec 19, 2024 08:28 PM\nAlthough the construction of an eight-storey building for Lalmonirhat Sadar Hospital was completed in April this year, it remains unused due to a severe manpower shortage.\nAs a result, despite the hospital's official upgrade to a 250-bed facility, its operational capacity remains limited to that of a 100-bed hospital.\nFor all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. During a recent visit, this correspondent observed patients being treated in the old building, many forced to lie on the floor due to a lack of available beds, enduring immense suffering in extreme cold.\nThe shortage of doctors, nurses, and staff was also evident compared to the number of admitted patients.\n\"My three-year-old son, suffering from cold-related complications, is being treated on the cold floor due to the lack of beds, worsening his condition,\" said Sabina Begum, 25, of Kulaghat village.\n\"If the new building was in use, it could have accommodated more patients and prevented such suffering,\" she added.\nKader Mia, 50, of Sarpukur village, echoed her concerns. His 75-year-old father, battling respiratory issues, is also being treated on the floor.\n\"My father's recovery is slow due to the lack of proper care. Although medicines are available, nurses aren't providing adequate attention,\" he said.\nSekender Ali, 45, of Shaheed Shahjahan Colony area in Lalmonirhat town, said the old building's premises are dirty and malodorous, leaving patients compelled to withstand the stench while undergoing treatment.\nHe urged the hospital authorities to initiate treatment in the new building for patients' welfare.\nAccording to hospital sources, the hospital has adequate food and medical supplies for 250 patients, but the manpower is hardly enough to provide treatment to 100 patients at once.\nAt present, only outdoor services have been opened in the new hospital building, while all other services are still being provided in the old building due to manpower shortage.\nContacted, Dr Abdul Mokaddem, superintendent of the hospital, said the hospital currently has only 19 doctors and 62 nurses, while it needs at least 90 doctors and 160 nurses to function properly as a 250-bed hospital. In addition, 24 other staff posts are also lying vacant, he added.\n\"If we start providing services in the new building, the number of patients will increase, but the available manpower will be insufficient to deliver services properly. At present, we are struggling to provide treatment to patients in 100 beds in the old building,\" he said.\n\"If more doctors, nurses, and staff are appointed, we will be able to conduct medical services in the new building, which will in turn benefit the patients. A letter has been sent to the relevant higher authorities in this regard,\" he added.\nClick to comment Comments Comments Policy",

    "text": "Holiday grief strikes Slidell before Christmas\nMental health struggles hit harder during the holidays. How you can recognize the signs and help someone in need\nMental health struggles hit harder during the holidays. How you can recognize the signs and help someone in need\nMental health struggles hit harder during the holidays. How you can recognize the signs and help someone in need\nFriends and family are mourning the loss of a beloved retired elementary school teacher from Slidell. The St. Tammany Parish Coroner’s Office confirmed that 43-year-old Kacie Kerlec died by suicide earlier this week.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one person dies by suicide every 11 minutes. Mental health experts warn that the holiday season can heighten emotional challenges, especially for those already struggling or those grieving the loss of a loved one earlier in the year.\nMonique Gregoire, the coordinator of Outreach at the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) in Mandeville, highlighted the added stress many face during the holidays.\n“Think about the person who just lost a loved one, and this is their first Christmas without them,” she said. “Think about the parent choosing between putting groceries on the table and buying gifts for their kids. There are so many factors.”\nMonique advises watching for warning signs in those battling mental health challenges, including withdrawal, mood changes such as increased anxiety or anger, and overall isolation.\nJustin Tanner, a peer support specialist supervisor and former Marine, shared his perspective as someone who has experienced depression. He pointed out that the holidays can bring survivor’s guilt for some.\n“This might be a time that they look back and say, ‘I’m still here, but my family’s not,’” Tanner explained.\nBoth Monique and Tanner emphasized the power of small gestures in providing support.\n“Just a simple knock on the door—‘Hey, how are you doing today? Just checking in’—could make the difference between someone having a very bad holiday or the best day of their life,” Tanner said.\nIf you or someone you know is struggling, help is available. Call or text the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 for confidential support 24/7.\nNational Alliance on Mental Illness: Call 1-800-950-6264, text \"HelpLine\" to 62640, or email NAMI at helpline@nami.org\nSAMHSA's National Helpline: Call 1-800-662-4357 or text your 5-digit ZIP CIDE to 435748",

(WCIA) — Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s Office has issued cease and desist letters to five med spas in the Chicagoland area for misleading marketing of weight loss medications.\nRaoul is warning Illinois residents seeking to purchase GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound to be aware that many sellers advertising these name brand medications are instead offering unapproved versions of these products that might put people’s health at risk.\nNew IL pay stub requirement will begin in 2025\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement He is strongly urging people to obtain prescriptions for weight loss medications from a trusted health care provider and to fill those prescriptions at an appropriately licensed pharmacy.\nRaoul is warning consumers of misleading advertising by med spas, wellness centers, online retailers and social media sellers that states or implies they are offering name brand GLP-1 medications or generic versions of name brand medications, when in reality they are offering compounded drugs.\nThese compounded drugs are not the same as generic drugs because they are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as they are often produced on site and by prescription for individual patients who aren’t able to take a drug in its FDA-approved form.\nHowever, when a drug is in short supply, the FDA allows certain larger pharmacies to use the active ingredient in that drug to produce compounded versions of the drug in order to meet the public demand. The FDA doesn’t review compounded drugs for safety, quality or effectiveness, however, and these drugs may pose health risks.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Millions of Americans are looking for help losing weight, and for reasons ranging from the costs to the availability of prescription drugs, they are looking for alternate means of buying what can be lifesaving medications,” Raoul said.\nAccording to Raoul, unscrupulous sellers are also making misleading health claims and promoting GLP-1 products in formulations that haven’t been evaluated by regulatory agencies or tested in humans at all, such as drops, skin patches and nasal sprays.\nIL community colleges join forces to feed needy during holidays\nThe FDA has issued warnings to try to stop the distribution of illegal versions of weight loss products. Some GLP-1 medications are being sold directly to consumers without prescriptions or are research-only products that should never be used by humans.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in Health Ozempic before and after: 5 women get real about weight loss, side effects and cost TODAY Dear Abby: All my decades-long friends have shunned me — I don’t know why NY Post USDA issues warning after ground beef shipment tests positive for potentially life-threatening bacteria — here's how you can stay safe The Cool Down A busy longevity clinic owner is 33 but says her biological age is 22. Here's the daily routine she follows. INSIDER The office said before purchasing products advertised as GLP-1 medications, consider the following questions. If the answer to any of them is yes, avoid purchasing the medication to protect yourself from serious health consequences that may be associated with compounded or fake products. Raoul is urging consumers to ask:\nDoes the seller offer GLP-1 medications without a prescription or without the supervision of a licensed health care provider?\nDoes the seller offer research-grade, research-only or GLP-1 medications for research purposes?\nAre consumers encouraged to reconstitute GLP-1 medications, break apart Mounjaro and Zepbound pens or vials to use as separate doses, or to water down doses?\nIs the GLP-1 medication mixed with other medications or chemicals?\nIs the GLP-1 medication offered as drops, sprays, skin patches or in under-the-tongue form?\nIs the seller promoting GLP-1 medication to consumers under the age of 18?\nIs the GLP-1 medication sold without disclosing the potential side effects or safety risks?\nIs the compounding pharmacy, med spa, wellness center or online retailer making claims about the GLP-1 medication’s safety and efficacy?\nIs the seller offering to sell more than three months of GLP-1 medications at once?\nIs the GLP-1 medication being sold or shipped from another country?\nIs the GLP-1 medication sold by an individual person, including by someone on social media?\nAre consumers being encouraged to lie to obtain the GLP-1 medication, including by misrepresenting their weight or BMI?\nRaoul is urging consumers considering taking a GLP-1 medication for weight loss to first consult a trusted physician and fill any prescriptions at state-licensed pharmacies. To find out whether a medication shortage exists before taking that drug, check the FDA’s drug shortage database .\nFirearm deer season harvests 82,000 deer across Illinois, up from last year\nKnowing whether a medication shortage exists can be a sign that the drug you are contemplating is potentially being compounded. Ask questions about what exactly is being offered, including active and other ingredients.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Consumers should avoid obtaining or filling prescriptions from unknown sources. If filling prescriptions from an online pharmacy, visit the FDA’s online pharmacy information page for resources about safely obtaining prescription medicines online.\nRaoul encourages Illinois residents to report deceptive marketing or the sale of unsafe products on the Attorney General’s website or by calling one of the Attorney General’s Consumer Fraud Hotlines:\n800-386-5438 (Chicago)\n800-243-0618 (Springfield)\n800-243-0607 (Carbondale)\n866-310-8398 (Spanish-language hotline)\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

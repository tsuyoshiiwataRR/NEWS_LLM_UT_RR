It’s about‍ recognizing⁤ that mental health is just as important as physical health.”\nVermont psychiatric Survivors⁣ Faces Uncertain Future After Losing Key State Funding Montpelier, VT – For decades, Vermont Psychiatric Survivors has been a vital voice for mental health advocacy in the state. Founded in 1983, the‍ nonprofit has championed the rights‌ of individuals impacted by psychiatric diagnoses,‍ providing support and advocating ‍for their inclusion in policy decisions. However, the association’s future is now in question after losing a crucial state grant it had relied on for years.\nThe grant, awarded by the Vermont Department of Mental Health, provided funding for peer leadership, advocacy,‍ and support ‌programs. For over three decades, Vermont Psychiatric Survivors received this funding, which amounted to $607,375 for the most recent⁣ 12-month period. This funding represented the ⁤organization’s sole source of revenue, according to Zachary Hughes, vice president of ⁢the Vermont Psychiatric Survivors board.\nZachary Hughes is a board member of vermont Psychiatric Survivors.

The decision followed a letter sent to the department⁢ in january by 14 members of Vermont’s psychiatric survivors community. ‍The letter expressed “serious and specific concerns” about Vermont ​Psychiatric Survivors’ performance and urged the state to seek new bids for the grant.\n“We can no longer ⁢overlook (Vermont ⁣Psychiatric Survivors’) dereliction of its responsibilities and obligations under its grant or keep quiet about the wasteful allocation of state funds to VPS,” the letter stated.\nHughes acknowledged the organization’s‍ current challenges, stating that Vermont Psychiatric Survivors has “kind of halted physical operations” and is now operating solely with volunteers, including the executive director.\nDespite the setback, the board remains committed to continuing the organization’s mission. “We’re restructuring,” Hughes said. “And we’re trying to apply for other grants.”\nThe future of Vermont Psychiatric Survivors hangs in the balance as the organization navigates this period of transition.⁣ The loss of the state grant​ has ⁢forced a reevaluation ‍of its⁣ operations and fundraising strategies. Whether the organization can successfully adapt and continue its vital work remains‍ to be seen.\nVermont Hospitals Struggle to Meet Mental Health Needs, Reports Reveal Statewide investigations expose systemic issues in ‌mental health care, leaving‌ patients vulnerable.\nVermont ‌hospitals are facing a critical shortage of ‌mental health resources, according to a series of recent state reports. The investigations reveal widespread ⁣failures in providing timely and adequate care,leaving vulnerable patients struggling to access essential services.\nThe reports, compiled ⁣by the Vermont ‌Department of‍ Mental Health, paint a stark picture of a system under immense strain.

We ⁢need to prioritize mental health and ensure that ‌everyone has access to the care they deserve.”\nVermont Mental Health Nonprofit Faces Scrutiny‌ Over Grant Performance Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital, VT – A Vermont nonprofit dedicated⁣ to supporting individuals with psychiatric diagnoses is facing criticism over its​ performance under a state grant.\nVermont Psychiatric Survivors (VPS), which received a grant from the ⁤Vermont Department of mental Health, has been‌ accused of failing to fulfill⁣ key responsibilities outlined⁢ in the agreement. A January letter ​signed by several individuals involved in the ⁣state’s mental health ‍community raised concerns‍ about the organization’s activities.\nThe letter, obtained by VTDigger,​ alleges that VPS ​has not actively participated in statewide ​discussions about⁢ peer support, failed to appoint representatives to state‍ boards and committees, and has been absent from legislative hearings on issues affecting the psychiatric community.\nFurther criticism centers​ on VPS’s publication, Counterpoint , which the letter claims no longer prioritizes‍ the​ voices and ⁤narratives of psychiatric survivors. Delays in awarding funds for community projects also drew scrutiny.\n“We also have serious ⁢and specific concerns about VPS’s fiscal management, hiring practices, organizational culture, and adherence to its by-laws, especially regarding membership and member meetings,” the‍ letter states.\nWhile several signatories declined to comment, VPS‌ board vice president, [Name withheld], expressed disappointment over the letter’s contents, stating that some allegations were inaccurate. He acknowledged‍ that VPS had representatives on certain state boards and committees, contradicting the letter’s claims.\n“There are other things (in the letter) that we‌ certainly⁤ would have ⁣wanted⁢ to look into a little more,” Hughes said. “I certainly know that there ⁢have been concerns over the years with VPS. But we’ve always gotten through them.”\nThe Vermont Department of Mental Health has⁤ not publicly⁤ commented on the situation.\nThis controversy highlights the challenges faced‍ by⁢ organizations working in the mental health field and the​ importance of ‌transparency and accountability in grant-funded programs.\nVermont Advocate Pushes for Mental Health Parity in ‍Insurance Coverage Montpelier, VT – ⁣Zachary Hughes, a board member of Vermont Psychiatric Survivors, ⁤is on ⁢a mission. He’s fighting for what‌ he⁤ calls “true ‌parity” in mental health insurance coverage, ensuring that Vermonters struggling with mental illness have the same access⁣ to care as those with physical ailments.\nHughes, who has lived experience‌ with mental⁣ illness, believes the current ⁢system falls short. “We’re seeing people denied coverage for essential treatments, facing exorbitant ‌out-of-pocket costs, and struggling ‍to find providers who accept their insurance,” he says.\nVermont Mental Health Group ⁤Loses Grant,Citing Bias Montpelier,VT – A vermont mental health advocacy⁣ group,Vermont Psychiatric Survivors,is​ raising concerns about a recent grant decision by the Vermont Department of Mental Health (DMH).⁤ The group alleges bias influenced the awarding of a peer support grant to a newer organization, MadFreedom Advocates.\nZachary Hughes, a board member of Vermont Psychiatric Survivors, penned a letter to DMH Commissioner Emily Hawes, signed by numerous members, expressing their concerns. The letter highlighted concerns about the selection process and questioned whether​ the department adequately considered the group’s long-standing experience in providing peer support services.\n“We believe our ⁣organization has a proven track record of effectively serving the needs of Vermonters with lived experience in the mental health system,” Hughes stated. “We were deeply disappointed by the decision and believe it reflects a lack of understanding of the unique value we bring to the table.”\nThe DMH acknowledged receipt of the letter and emphasized its commitment to taking concerns seriously.‍ Spokesperson Natalie Frantz stated, “DMH recognizes the time, energy and courage it takes for individuals⁢ to share concerns, and we take those concerns very seriously.”\nThe grant in question, focused on expanding peer support services, drew applications from three organizations: Vermont Psychiatric Survivors, the National alliance on ⁤Mental Illness⁤ of Vermont, and MadFreedom Advocates.\nInternal documents obtained by VTDigger reveal that state staffers ranked MadFreedom Advocates’ proposal ‍highest.

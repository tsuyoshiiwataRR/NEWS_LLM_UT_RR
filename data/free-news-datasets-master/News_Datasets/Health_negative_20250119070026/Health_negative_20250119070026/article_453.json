    "text": "By Jake Rowe ,\n1 hours ago\nGeorgia quarterback Carson Beck (15) takes the field to warm up before the start of the SEC championship game against Texas in Atlanta, on Saturday, Dec. 7, 2024. © Joshua L. Jones / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images Carson Beck will miss the Georgia’s Allstate Sugar Bowl matchup in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals, DawgsHQ has learned. On3’s Pete Nakos was the first to report that Beck’s ulnar collateral ligament will cause him to miss the Sugar Bowl which will be against Either Notre Dame or Indiana on January 1, 2025.\nBeck sustained the injury on the final play of the first half in the SEC Championship game. The Jacksonville native considered forgoing remaining eligibility at Georgia and entering the NFL Draft last year but elected to come back for one final season. He completed 64.7 percent of his passes for 3,485 yards 28 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. Beck also has a rushing touchdown on the season.\nWith Georgia trailing 6-3, Beck attempted a Hail Mary but held on to the ball long enough for the Longhorn pass rush to get home. His arm was hit as he threw, torquing it unnaturally.\nAfter staying on the field for a couple of minutes and being attended to by trainers and coaches, Beck left the field on his own power with his right arm dangling at his side. He returned to the sideline in the second half with ice on both his shoulder and his elbow.\nAccording to Kirby Smart, Beck was unable to grip the football due to numbess, tingling, and weakness in his throwing hand. Georgia turned to backup quarterback Gunner Stockton for the entire second half, scoring on four of six possessions.\nThe first of those possessions was a 10-play, 75-yard drive that was capped off by a 10-yard touchdown run from Trevor Etienne . The Bulldogs went on to make it 13-6 before Texas tied it with a 41-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter.\nUGA put together another scoring drive to answer, a 16-play 72-yard march that included a fake punt to extend the drive. Peyton Woodring ‘s chip shot field goal gave Georgia a 16-13 lead but the Longhorns tied it in the final minute with a short field goal, sending the game into overtime.\nTexas got a field goal on the opening possession and Georgia won it a few plays later. An eight-yard run from Stockton set the Bulldogs up at the Texas four-yard line but the sophomore signal caller lost his helmet at the end of the play. Beck came in to hand it off and Etienne punched it in from four yards out to capture the SEC crown for UGA. It was the last play of Beck’s 2025 season.\nThe post Carson Beck update: Georgia QB to miss Sugar Bowl appeared first on On3 .",

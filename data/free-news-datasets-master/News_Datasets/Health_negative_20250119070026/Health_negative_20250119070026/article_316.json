    "text": "CHP reminds public on precautions against cold weather\nThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (December 20) reminded the public, particularly the elderly and people with chronic illnesses, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.\nA spokesman for the CHP said that cold weather can easily trigger or exacerbate diseases, especially among the elderly and persons suffering from heart disease, respiratory illnesses or other chronic illnesses.\n\"Elderly people have less insulating fat beneath their skin to keep them warm, and their body temperature control mechanisms may be weaker. Their body may not be able to appropriately respond to thecold weather,\" the spokesman said.\nSome senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat. Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes and endocrine disorders, may undermine the health of elderly people and lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or heart disease, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.\nThe CHP reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:\nIn addition, the public should avoid alcoholic beverages.\n\"Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead,\" the spokesman said.\n\"Parents should ensure that babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them,\" the spokesman added.\nParents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:\nIn addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP's [website](https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/17980.html).\nA person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may be more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:\nFood-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:\nIn addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.\nFor more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit the[CHP's website](https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/index.html)and[Facebook Fanpage](https://www.facebook.com/CentreforHealthProtection/).\nThe public may also call Dial-a-Weather (1878 200) or visit the[website of the Hong Kong Observatory](https://www.hko.gov.hk/en/index.html)for the latest weather information and forecasts, or its[page on Weather Information for Senior Citizens](https://www.hko.gov.hk/en/sports/socare/socare.htm).",

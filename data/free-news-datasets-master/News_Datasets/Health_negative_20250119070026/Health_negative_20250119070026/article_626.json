    "text": "LT Paris Johnson could miss multiple games with knee injury\nBy Jess Root,\n36 minutes agoArizona Cardinals left tackle Paris Johnson has missed the first two days of practice in Week 16 as the team prepares to take on the Carolina Panthers. He is listed on the injury report as having a knee injury.\n[According to The Sports Daily’s Kyle Odegard](https://thesportsdaily.com/news/source-cardinals-star-tackle-paris-johnson-out-at-least-a-week-with-strained-mcl/), former writer for the team, Johnson will miss at least one game and could miss more with a strained MCL he suffered in the Cardinals’ 30-17 win over the New England Patriots.\nThe Cardinals are 7-7 and almost are in a situation where they must win their final three games to perhaps win the NFC West. That becomes much more difficult without Johnson, who has played very well at left tackle this season.\nWhile rookie Christian Jones is listed as the backup left tackle on the depth chart, veteran Kelvin Beachum most assuredly would be the guy to start there. Beachum started nine games at right tackle this season while starting right tackle Jonah Williams was on injured reserve and played well.\nThe Cardinals and Panthers kick off Sunday at 1 p.m. ET. The Cardinals will release their final injury report of the week on Friday.\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire’s Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

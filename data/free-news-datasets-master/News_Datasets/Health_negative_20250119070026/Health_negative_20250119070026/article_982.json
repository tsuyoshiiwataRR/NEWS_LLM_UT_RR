    "text": "On Thursday, Madison attorney Sam Strauss filed two class-action lawsuits in Dane County Circuit Court against Group Health over the data breach.\nOne suit, filed on behalf of Madison residents and Group Health patients Gabriella Jenich and Margaret Hetzler, accuses Group Health of negligence, saying it “failed to implement reasonable protections to safeguard” patient information and failed to respond to the breach appropriately. It defines Group Health as medical clinics, pharmacies and providers.\nPeople are also reading… Wisconsin football, quarterback recruit part ways Wisconsin men's basketball starting guard 'feeling better and better every day' Lake Geneva officials discuss whether to continue church parking program Polzin: Why the Wisconsin men's basketball team is tough to beat when 'aggressive Steve' comes to play DNR to host career fairs across Wisconsin Wisconsin men's basketball New Zealand signee's official visit backed 'everything that I've been hearing' Like a 'funeral wake': Dick and Jake Leinenkugel lament loss of historic Chippewa Falls brewery Lake Geneva Schools announce results of school report cards Walworth County in need of more available housing Inmate dies at federal prison in Oxford in central Wisconsin Heartland Country Village nursing home closing in Black Earth IRS is sending out automatic stimulus payments Athletes of the week Wisconsin men's basketball experiences beneficial 'game pressure' vs. Ohio State Leslie Charleson, ‘General Hospital’s’ Dr. Monica Quartermaine, dies at 79 The other suit, filed on behalf of Superior resident Daniel Pearson, is similar but defines Group Health as a member-owned health plan.\nGroup Health identified unauthorized access to its network on Jan. 25, according a statement it released Tuesday . Its information technology department secured the network, making several systems temporarily unavailable.\nThe hacker attempted to encrypt the company’s systems but failed. Group Health reported the incident to the FBI and hired outside help to restore and verify the security of its network and investigate the attack.\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\nOn Feb. 9, the company discovered indications that the attacker had copied some of its data, including protected health information. The stolen data may include names, Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth or death, Group Health member numbers, Medicare numbers and Medicaid numbers.\nUW Health says information on some patients compromised in cybersecurity incident\n“Our discovery was confirmed when the attacker, a foreign ransomware gang, contacted (Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin) claiming responsibility for the attack and stealing our data,” the statement said. “We have no indication that information has been used or further disclosed.”\nGroup Health representatives on Thursday declined to comment on the lawsuits. Spokesperson Kate McLaughlin said current and past members of the HMO, which has about 80,000 members, and current and past patients of its providers are included in the total of more than 500,000 people.\nGroup Health said it has taken additional steps to mitigate harm by working with the FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. It has informed potentially affected individuals, state and federal agencies and consumer reporting agencies.\n“To reduce the risk of this happening again, we have implemented enhanced security measures across all our systems and networks,” the HMO said. “This includes strengthening existing controls, data backup, user training and awareness, and other measures.”\nPeople with questions can call member services at 800-605-4327.

    "text": "The use of masks and Covid certificates in England will no longer be a legal requirement from Thursday, after the British government eased pandemic restrictions.\nHowever, the country’s shops and supermarkets, as well as train operators, have indicated that they will continue to ask citizens to continue using masks despite the changes introduced by the Executive.\nThese rules were scrapped following Prime Minister Boris Johnson ‘s pledge to pave the way for “complete normality”.\nAccording to an official spokesperson for the Tory leader’s boss, from Thursday the use of masks will be “a matter of personal judgement”.\nThe Government has also made clear that public health guidance in this country urging Britons to wear a mask in crowded places and in closed spaces where they are in contact with strangers will continue.\nThe Labor mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has indicated that masks will continue to be mandatory on the capital’s transport services, urging citizens to “do the right thing”.\nAs for private entities, they will be able to choose whether to request the presentation of the covid certificate from those who visit their facilities.\nOther rules to stop the spread of the omicron variant of the coronavirus, such as telework instruction when possible and the wearing of masks by high school students in classrooms, had already been eliminated.\nThe easing of restrictions envisaged in the government’s so-called Plan B came into force following a review of official data last week, which included the rate of infections, the effectiveness of vaccines, the pressures of Covid-19 on the health system public (NHS), absences from work, public behavior and scientists’ ratings.\nWith information from EN\n#Masks #covid #certificates #longer #mandatory #England",

    "text": "by Michael Snyder, End Of The American Dream :\nAre we on the verge of another major public health crisis? Will we soon see the return of lockdowns, shutdowns, testing, masks and mandates? Since 2022, the H5N1 bird flu has been causing chaos all over the globe. According to NBC News , 123 million birds “have been killed or euthanized” in the United States, and a new wave of the outbreak has arrived this winter with a vengeance. That is one of the primary reasons why eggs are now so expensive all over the country. Unfortunately, the H5N1 bird flu is also spreading like wildfire among dairy cows. This month it is ripping through hundreds of dairy herds in the state of California, and as a result a state of emergency has just been declared …\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\nCalifornia has declared a state of emergency for H5N1 bird flu amid fears that the virus could jump to people and start to spread.\nThe move comes in response to a major outbreak of the virus among the state’s cattle which has spilled over and infected dozens of dairy workers.\nWhat we are witnessing in California right now is truly alarming.\nSo far, 645 dairy herds have been affected as bird flu roars across the state.\nAlmost half of those dairy herds have been hit just within the past 30 days …\nCalifornia has identified H5N1 in 645 dairy herds since its first detection in late August and nearly half of those were reported in the past 30 days, highlighting the rapid spread of the virus.\nThirty-four of the US’ 61 human bird flu cases have also been in California.\nThis is a really big deal.\nIn a previous article , I discussed the fact that piles of dead cows have been spotted “stacked along roadsides rotting in the heat” in rural parts of the state…\nA dystopian scene is emerging in California as dairy farmers battle a ruthless disease.\nDead cows and calves stacked along roadsides rotting in the heat surrounded by crows, vultures and thick swarms of black flies.\nAfter wiping out tens of millions of birds worldwide, the H5N1 avian flu is tearing through dairy farms in the US.\nWhen it was just birds that were dropping dead, most people were not too concerned.\nBut dairy cows are mammals just like us.\nAnd now dozens of humans are getting infected.\nIn fact, the very first “severe” human case of H5N1 has been confirmed in the state of Louisiana. The following comes from the official CDC website …\nA patient has been hospitalized with a severe case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus (“H5N1 bird flu”) infection in Louisiana. This marks the first instance of severe illness linked to the virus in the United States. The case was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday, December 13. Since April 2024, there have been a total of 61 reported human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States.\nPartial viral genome data of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that infected the patient in Louisiana indicates that the virus belongs to the D1.1 genotype related to other D1.1 viruses recently detected in wild birds and poultry in the United States and in recent human cases in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington state. This H5N1 bird flu genotype is different than the B3.13 genotype detected in dairy cows, sporadic human cases in multiple states, and some poultry outbreaks in the United States. Additional genomic sequencing and efforts to isolate virus from clinical specimens from the patient in Louisiana are underway at CDC.\nWe aren’t being told much about the victim other than the fact that this particular individual is “currently hospitalized in critical condition” …\nAmerican flag merchandise “The patient is experiencing severe respiratory illness related to H5N1 infection and is currently hospitalized in critical condition,” said Emma Herrock, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana Department of Health.\nOf course this wasn’t the first such case in North America.\nLast month, a teenager in Canada had to be hospitalized after getting infected with the bird flu…\nA teenager in British Columbia was hospitalized in November after contracting the same genotype of the bird flu virus. Canadian health officials were not able to determine the source of the teen’s infection.\nRead More @ EndOfTheAmericanDream.com",

    "text": "They could be ticking timebombs.\nWestchester County health officials are imploring a pair of good Samaritans who dropped a rabid cat off at a Yonkers animal hospital to come forward — because they could be infected with the fatal disease.\nThe anonymous pair was caught on surveillance video pulling off their good deed last week, but left without giving shelter workers their names — and could now face a lethal health hazard.\n3 Health officials said this woman carried an injured cat to the Yonkers Animal Hospital last week and could now be infected with rabies. Westchester Gov 3 This man and a woman may have been infected after dropping a rabid cat off at a Yonkers animal hospital. Westchester Gov “Rabies is fatal, but it is also 100% preventable with post-exposure treatment,” county Health Commissioner Dr. Sherlita Amler said in a statement this week .\nExplore More Democrats and GOP hardliners tank Trump-backed House bill to avert government shutdown White House aides hid Biden's apparent mental decline from Day 1 of his presidency, explosive report reveals Luigi Mangione makes first appearance in Manhattan federal court on murder charges in death of UnitedHealthcare CEO “If you see an injured or sick animal, call police,” Amler said. “Teach your children to not approach or handle animals they don’t know, even if they appear young, injured or friendly, and to tell you right away if they are bitten or scratched by any animal.”\nBut the cautionary advice comes too late for the Yonkers do-gooders, who county officials said were only trying to help the year-old feline after it was possibly struck by a car.\nThe cat, which was left at the Yonkers Animal Hospital on Saw Mill River Road shortly before 4:30 pm on Dec. 12, later tested positive for rabies, the health department said.\nSecurity camera footage from the site showed a man wearing a red checkered jacket, khaki pants and a black hat, and a woman in a black jacket who carried the cat in a beige tote bag.\n3 Rabies is a viral infection carried by animals that can prove fatal to humans without treatment with a rabies vaccine. Steve Heaslip/Cape Cod Times / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 60,000 people in the US receive medical treatment every year after exposure to rabig animals.\nRabies is a viral disease transmitted to humans by animals and can be fatal if untreated.\nWhile there is no indication the Yonkers good Samaritans were infected, the county wants to make sure.\n“Unusual behavior may be the first sign of rabies in an animal,” the county said in a press release. “A rabid animal may become either abnormally aggressive or unusually tame.\n“It may lose fear of people and become excited and irritable, or appear particularly passive and lethargic,” the release said. “Staggering and frothing at the mouth are sometimes noted.”",

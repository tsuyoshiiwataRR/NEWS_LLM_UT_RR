    "text": "By Gabriella Phelan ,\n2 hours ago\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (KNWA/KFTA) — Arkansas has seen a nearly 25% rise in Influenza cases during the second week of December.\nAccording to the Arkansas Department of Health, from Dec. 8 to Dec. 14, more than 165 total cases, 10 hospitalizations, and one death were reported.\nOne local pharmacist says seeing an uptick this early in the year is unusual, but not surprising.\n“We’re seeing a peak right now. But, you know, we’re really just getting into the Christmas season. So, a lot of people are going to be traveling and going to other parts of the country,” said Caul Corbell, pharmacist at Live Well Pharmacy in Fayetteville. “There’s no set standard on when it’s going to peak throughout the season. So, it’s a little bit earlier than usual from what I’ve seen in the past.”\nSince Sept. 29, 873 cases of various different types of flu have been reported to the ADH.\nAlice Walton aims to change healthcare in Northwest Arkansas Corbell says although the peak time to get your vaccines has passed, he still encourages people to take that safety measure.\n“Most of the vaccine traffic has slowed at this point because usually the vaccines come out in early September. A lot of times people are getting those vaccines in September and October,” Corbell said. “I always like to encourage people and say it’s never too late. Vaccines are typically covered at a $0 copay on most insurances.”\nBetween December and April, Corbell says the pharmacy will dispense all kind of medications, but one stands out amongst the rest.\n“Between now and April will be when we see the most of our dispensing of flu medications,” Corbell said.\nHowever, he says five minutes of time can keep you protected.\n“We can get you in and out in less than 5 minutes here. So, it’s quick and easy. It’s convenient, and it’s by far the best way to prevent getting the flu,” Corbell said. “It introduces an antigen into your body, such to elicit a response from your immune system that helps your immune system create antibodies that if it’s then encountered with the actual flu virus, it already has the antibodies built up in store to fight off the virus.”\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Waddle (knee) didn't practice Thursday, David Furones of the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports.\nWaddle also missed practice Wednesday, which sets the stage for Friday's session to loom large in terms of the wideout's chances of playing Sunday against the 49ers. If Waddle -- who head coach Mike McDaniel has called day-to-day -- is unavailable this weekend, Malik Washington would be in line to see an expanded role behind top WR Tyreek Hill.\nMore News Dolphins' Jaylen Waddle: Won't practice, day-to-day 1D ago • by RotoWire Staff Dolphins' Jaylen Waddle: Avoids long-term injury 3D ago • by RotoWire Staff Dolphins' Jaylen Waddle: Hurts knee Sunday 4D ago • by RotoWire Staff Dolphins' Jaylen Waddle: Cleared to play Sunday 6D ago • by RotoWire Staff Dolphins' Jaylen Waddle: Stays limited in practice 7D ago • by RotoWire Staff Dolphins' Jaylen Waddle: Limited by hamstring issue 8D ago • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Football Stories Playoff Semis Non-PPR Cheat Sheet Dave Richard • 3 min read Week 16 lineup decisions Dave Richard • 13 min read Playoff Semis PPR Cheat Sheet Dave Richard • 3 min read Week 16 Fantasy football rankings: QB, RB, WR, TE picks CBS Sports Staff • 7 min read Playoffs Start 'Em & Sit 'Em Jamey Eisenberg • 4 min read Start 'Em & Sit 'Em: WR Jamey Eisenberg • 1 min read",

    "text": "Statcare Emergency Clinic in Pointe-Claire is facing closure, putting thousands of patients at risk of losing access to health care.\nLast week, the clinic’s owner, ELNA Medical, was granted creditor protection.\nCatherine Brady, whose family has been consulting at the clinic for over a decade, is concerned about the potential shutdown.\n“It’s going to affect the West Island in a huge way,” she said, adding that her doctor is worried as well.\n“Obviously, he’s disappointed as well too. They are going to try to do everything they can. It’s unsustainable for us not to have this clinic, it needs to stay open.”\nA source told CTV News that Statcare will be laying off four employees as concerns grow about its potential closure.\nPointe-Claire Mayor Tim Thomas said that if the clinic does close, it will put additional pressure on the Lakeshore General Hospital.\n“The already overwhelmed emergency room will be bursting at the seams,” Thomas said.\n“Its not like there is no clientele. There’s unlimited demand. How is it unable to operate?”\nThe company’s insolvency trustee, Benoit Fontaine, did not respond to CTV News’ request for an interview but previously said that if the clinic closes, the staff and patients will be transferred to other points of care.\nThe health authority in charge of the clinic told CTV News it hasn’t received an official notice from ELNA Medical to close the clinic, but it is looking into how it would affect the region if it were to close.",

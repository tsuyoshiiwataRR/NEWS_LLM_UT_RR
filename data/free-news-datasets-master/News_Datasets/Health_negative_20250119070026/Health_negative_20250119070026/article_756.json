    "text": "The Gazette offers audio versions of articles using Instaread. Some words may be mispronounced.\nCEDAR RAPIDS — After being found unresponsive and without a pulse, a male inmate at the Linn County Jail died Thursday despite attempts to save him, according to the Linn County Sheriff’s Office.\nThe inmate, who “had an extensive medical history and was serving time on several charges” since Dec. 7, according to the Sheriff’s Office, was not identified until notification of relatives.\nAccording to a news release, jail staff about 3:54 p.m. Thursday discovered the inmate unconscious in a cell. The news release didn’t say how long it had been since he was last checked on before being found or whether other inmates were present in the cellblock at the time.\nA medical emergency was declared over the jail’s radios and nurses and additional staff responded to the cellblock. Staff began CPR and connected the inmate to an automated external defibrillator. Additional paramedics responded to help, the Sheriff’s Office said.\nThe Linn County Medical Examiner’s Office ordered an autopsy to help determine his cause of death, authorities said. The death was reported to the State Jail Inspector and the incident is under investigation, according to the Sheriff’s Office.",

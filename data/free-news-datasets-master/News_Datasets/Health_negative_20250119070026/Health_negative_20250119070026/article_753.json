    "text": "Isaiah Bond is not expected to suit up for the Longhorns on Saturday against Clemson in the College Football Playoff, according to a report.\nESPN’s Pete Thamel shared that news on Thursday night, stating that the Texas wide receiver “faces long odds” to play vs. the Tigers in the first round of the CFP due to an ankle injury. Thamel’s report says he has done “limited football activity” this week in preparation for the game.\nSources: Texas WR Isaiah Bond faces long odds to play against Clemson this weekend, as he recovers from a high ankle sprain. He may end up a game-time decision on Saturday, but has done limited football activity this week and has been focused on rehab work. pic.twitter.com/dr5fSaoZRg\n— Pete Thamel (@PeteThamel) December 20, 2024 As Thamel’s report notes, Bond re-aggravated his ankle injury in Texas’s loss to Georgia in the SEC Championship Game. He’s played very little over the last few weeks as a result — he has just 3 total receptions over Texas’s last 3 games.\nPrior to suffering the injury, the former Alabama wideout had established himself as one of the most important players on this Texas offense. Through 9 games, he recorded 30 catches for 483 yards and 5 touchdowns.\nWith Bond likely to miss the Clemson game, Thamel’s report says that freshman Ryan Wingo is expected to slot into the starting lineup. Wingo is a former 5-star prospect in his own right who has enjoyed a successful freshman season. He’s posted 24 catches for 394 yards so far in 2024.\nTexas and Clemson will meet at 4 p.m. ET on Saturday afternoon.",

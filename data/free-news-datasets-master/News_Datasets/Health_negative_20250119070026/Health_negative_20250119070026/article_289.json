    "text": "‘Her spirits are good’: Ocala dog lover attacked by dog, arm will be amputated\nOCALA, Fla. (WCJB) - An Ocala woman who runs a small business catered for dogs was attacked by one.\nPaige Littell was bit on her right arm while watching a friend’s dog on Sunday. Melody Chamberlain, who is another one of Littell’s friends, says the dog was on her arm for 20 minutes while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.\n“She’s known this dog for years and the dog just attacked her,” said Chamberlain.\nThe dog is a Belgian Malinois, the same breed as Littel’s pet. Marion County Animal Services staff say the dog is quarantining at their facility. When quarantine is over, the owner chose to humanely euthanize the dog.\n“She’s been an advocate for the dog that even bit her,” said Chamberlain. “She knows it was just an accident, this wasn’t anything mean or aggressive.”\nChamberlain tells TV20 the injuries are so bad, doctors will amputate her arm. Littell has an infected bite above the elbow, along with a bite that goes from her elbow down to her wrist on her forearm.\nLittell’s friends and family are raising money to help pay for her medical bills and life in recovery. They created a [GoFundMe page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-paige-overcome-lifechanging-injury?attribution_id=sl:e4cc4541-62c8-4905-af17-667ce98bd54e&utm_campaign=natman_sharesheet_dash&utm_content=amp10_t1&utm_medium=customer&utm_source=native_options) this week, receiving more than $17,000 in donations.\n“She’s not going to be able to probably go back to painting her dog muzzles, making these dog collars, and possibly even go back to work at all,” said Chamberlain.\nLittell owns [Kolossal K9](https://www.workingdogdrygoods.com/?fbclid=IwY2xjawHRekpleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHUp402KyeSDhYgkgK1aZuED7Cl7PYMY8XKlsIafWXNumQhDh3kufu_JNnw_aem_4fV-0lKzwCeFIsm0HcRBlg), where she vends at the Ocala Downtown Market. Her friends will sell collars and collect Christmas cards to hand to Littell this Saturday, December 21 from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\n“Her spirits are good for the situation,” said Chamberlain. “We are dealing with a lot of pain. They’re doing the best that they can to manage that for her here.”\nA separate fundraiser, called Jump 4 Paige, will be held on January 25, 2025 at Tracks K9 Dog Club in Chiefland. The event begins at 8 a.m. and all proceeds will go towards Littell’s medical costs.\n[Click here](https://www.wcjb.com/newsletter/) to subscribe to our newsletter.\nCopyright 2024 WCJB.

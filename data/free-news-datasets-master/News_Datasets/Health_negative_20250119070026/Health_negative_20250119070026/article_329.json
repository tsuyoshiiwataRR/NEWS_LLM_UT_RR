    "text": "By Julia Gomez and Natalie Neysa Alund, USA TODAY ,\n30 minutes ago The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed the first case of \"severe\" avian influenza , commonly known as bird flu , less than a month after a child in California was diagnosed with the virus.\nOn Friday, the CDC confirmed a person from Louisiana had avian influenza A virus, H5N1 , after they were exposed to sick and dead birds in a backyard flock, according to a CDC press release. The patient was hospitalized, marking the first \"severe\" human case in the United States.\n\"While an investigation into the source of the infection in Louisiana is ongoing, it has been determined that the patient had exposure to sick and dead birds in backyard flocks,\" the CDC said in a statement. \"This is the first case of H5N1 bird flu in the U.S. that has been linked to exposure to a backyard flock.\"\nThe confirmation comes weeks after the first case of bird flu was found in a child in California . This year, 61 people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu, according to the CDC.\nThe first severe case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus was confirmed by the CDC in Louisiana. Dado Ruvic, REUTERS What is bird flu? Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is a virus that can sometimes spread from infected animals, like birds and cows, to humans, according to the Cleveland Clinic. The virus primarily infects birds\nThere are multiple subtypes of the bird flu, but H5 subtypes of influenza A are the most common.\nThe two most common types of avian influenza are the following, according to Cleaveland Clinic:\nInfluenza A(H5N1) Influenza A(H7N9) In which states have people been infected by bird flu?\nWhich animals are most likely to be infected? Poultry are most likely to have avian influenza, according to the CDC's data. Around 123 million poultry have been affected since 2022 in all 50 states.\nSince Match 2024, over 700 herds of dairy cows have also been affected in 16 states.\nZoo animals infected, some killed, in Phoenix Two big cats and three large birds âˆ’ a cheetah, a mountain lion, a swamphen, a kookaburra and an Indian goose - from the Wildlife World Zoo and Aquarium, 20 miles west of Phoenix, died, and others were infected after being exposed to the bird flu, according to USA TODAY's previous reporting.\nMaricopa County Department of Public Health officials transported the sick animals to the Arizona Department of Agriculture for testing which later indicated they were likely exposed to avian influenza.\nWho is most at risk? People who are most at risk of being infected by bird flu are those who work with poultry, waterfowl and dairy cows, according to Cleveland Clinic . However, it is rare for the infection to spread from person to person.\nWhile cases of bird flu in humans have been reported, the risk to the general public remains low, according to the CDC.\nHow does it spread? A person can be infected with the virus if they touch an object that has been contaminated and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth, according to the CDC . The virus can also be spread through the handling of live and dead animals that are infected.\nIt can also be spread through eating, drinking or inhaling anything that contains the live virus like raw, unpasteurized milk.\nWhat are the symptoms? The symptoms of those who have been infected with bird flu can range in severity, according to the CDC, from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease resulting in death.\nThe following are symptoms of bird flu, according to the Cleveland Clinic and CDC:\nPink eye Fever Fatigue Cough Muscle aches Sore throat Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Stuffy or runny nose Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Headaches Pneumonia requiring hospitalization How to avoid being infected To avoid becoming sick with avian influenza, the CDC recommends the following:\nAvoid contact with sick or dead animals, especially wild birds or poultry. People who do have contact with dead animals should wear the recommended recommended personal protective equipment, PPE, which should be provided by an employer at no cost.

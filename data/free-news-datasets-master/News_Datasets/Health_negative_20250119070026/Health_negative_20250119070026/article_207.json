    "text": "By Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.com ,\n1 hours ago Customers in those areas received the notification at 9:30 pm ET and an update is expected by 9:45 pm Thursday. Residents have reported a metallic taste and a smell similar to paint thinner. The tainted tap water has led many on social media to speculate that drones flying over New Jersey may be connected to the changes, as initial sightings occurred over the Raritan Riverâ€”a vital source for the Raritan System. However, some residents have attributed the issues to a water main that broke at 7 am on Tuesday in Union City. American Water has not specified if the water main break was the cause for issues with the Raritan System's water. The mystery has left many residents frustrated, with one person sharing on Reddit: 'I'm surprised they don't give any directions... is it safe to drink, touch skin, etc.? Kinda wild that they omit the most important information for the customer.' American Water said it began flushing hydrants last night, continuing into Thursday in an effort to help clear out the system. [This may result in low pressure and/or discoloration. If your water is discolored, run the cold-water taps only, at the lowest level of the house for about 3 to 5 minutes until the water runs clear,' the company said in a press release. Residents in Hillsborough, where a drone allegedly crashed last week, and other towns have been told not to drink tap water and use bottled until further notice. But as drones have invaded the skies over New Jersey for more than a month, conspiracy theories are swirling about the water changes. 'So there's been countless unidentified drones flying over our reservoirs completely unfettered, and now the water from an entire reservoir smells and tastes bad,' a New Jersey resident shared online. 'And they are 100% sure there is no connection, even though we don't know who is flying the drones, why the drones are flying, why they are over reservoirs, and why the water smells and tastes bad.' A Facebook Group, New Jersey Mystery Drones - let's solve it, features a thread about the mysterious water issues. A Hillsborough resident posted: 'This could be completely unrelated and I am hoping that's the case....There are reports of foul smelling and tasting water in and around Hillsborough 08844. People are stating it tastes like nail polish. Any insight is appreciated.' The first comment reads: 'Drones flying over reservoirs spraying stuff. Go figure. My country is run by idiots.' Another New Jersey local shared the claims, saying: 'I've seen this coming and warned everyone a couple days ago but everyone laughed at me. 'Guess that's what happens when Drones are seen spraying everywhere including water reservoirs.' However, others commenting on the post share the issues with their tap water. 'Over the past month I've had 2 distinctive occasions when I've came in from outside and told my wife I have a metallic taste in my mouth,' one person shared. While another said she was happy to have read the alert before bathing her one-year-old. And many New Jerseyans warned the others to not drink the water. Over the past month, I've had 2 distinctive occasions when I've came in from outside and told my wife I have a metallic taste in my mouth. While a mother said she was glad to read the post before bathing her baby with the smelly water. The first New Jersey drone sightings appeared over the US Army's Picatinny Arsenal on November 18. Officials then started receiving reports of craft flying of water reservoirs, electric transmission lines, rail stations, police departments and military installations. The White House has stated multiple times that it has 'not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk.' National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday that people are misidentifying hobbyists, planes, and even stars as drones. He noted that the FBI had received tips on 5,000 drone sightings in recent weeks, of which 100 were deemed worthy of further investigation. Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

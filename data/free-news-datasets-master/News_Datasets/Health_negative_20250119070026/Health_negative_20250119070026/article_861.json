    "text": "[Health & Fitness](/california/hollywood/lifestyle)\nDozens Sickened After Eating Raw Oysters At LA Times Food Event: Reports\nMore than 80 people fell ill after eating raw oysters at an event celebrating the most delicious restaurants in Los Angeles.\nHOLLYWOOD, CA — Dozens of people who attended a Los Angeles Times restaurant event earlier this month became sick, apparently after eating raw oysters that have since been recalled due to potential norovirus contamination, according to reports.\nMore than 80 people who attended the Times' 101 Best Restaurants event at the Hollywood Palladium on Dec. 3 reported getting sick with symptoms including diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting, the LA Times reported.\nPublic health officials say the illnesses appear to be linked to raw oysters served at the event, which celebrated the unveiling of the Times' annual list of the region's top restaurants.\nFind out what's happening in Hollywoodfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nThe state Department of Public Health on Dec. 13 warned consumers not to eat raw oysters harvested from certain areas of British Columbia. The FDA has since reiterated that warning and the company that supplied the oysters issued a recall.\nThe oysters at the Times event were supplied by Fanny Bay Oysters, [LA Taco reported](https://lataco.com/la-times-101-restaurants-illness-oysters), which is among the oyster brands health officials say may be contaminated with norovirus.\nFind out what's happening in Hollywoodfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nThe oysters were sourced from Santa Monica Seafood and provided to one of the restaurants featured at the event, the Times reported.\n“We have produced culinary events for many years and take food safety very seriously,” Times spokesperson Hillary Manning said. “As is the case with each of our events, we had protocols in place and, based on an inspection from the L.A. County Department of Public Health, we were in compliance with all relevant safety standards. We also know the care that each chef and restaurant takes in preparing and serving food to our community.”\nImpacted oysters include those harvested in British Columbia in late November and early December. They may be marketed as Fanny Bay, Buckley Bay or Royal Miyagi Oysters.\nNorovirus, often called food poisoning or the stomach flu, is a contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea. It spreads easily from person to person and from contaminated food and surfaces. Hand sanitizer is usually ineffective in killing the virus, according to the California Department of Public Health.\nNorovirus can contaminate food that's grown or washed in contaminated water or if it's prepared by someone who is infected with the virus, state health officials said. It's the No. 1 cause of foodborne illness in the U.S., according to the CDC.\nAdditionally, it spreads very easily from person to person — through direct contact between two people — and can survive for weeks on surfaces and objects, according to health officials.\nState health officials offered these tips to avoid the spread of norovirus:\n- Practice good hand washing techniques using soap and water — hand sanitizers are usually not effective against norovirus.\n- Thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables.\n- Cook shellfish thoroughly.\n- If you're sick, stay home: Isolate for at least two days after you feel better.\n- Do not prepare food or care for others when you're sick with norovirus or have diarrhea.\n- Clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces or objects with a bleach solution in order to kill norovirus\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.\n[Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.](/california/hollywood/subscribe)",

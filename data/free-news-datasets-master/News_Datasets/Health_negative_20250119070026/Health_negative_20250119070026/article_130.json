    "text": "Egg prices are increasing this holiday season\nCOLCHESTER, CT (WFSB) - As the holidays approach, egg prices are going up.\nChannel 3 advised customers that prices might be higher the next time they shop for eggs.\nSome people may also have a hard time finding eggs in the aisles.\n“It’s the perfect storm for high prices in the egg industry right now,” said Hershal Tyles, General Manager of Mitlitsky Eggs.\nThis is a busy time of year at Mitlitsky Eggs in Lebanon. Their warehouse is usually chock-full.\nHowever, product is moving quickly and the warehouse is seeing empty space.\n“There’s a lot of panic buying,” Tiles said.\nThe Bird Flu is partly to blame for this situation.\n“We’ve seem some outbreaks in the last month in Iowa. And that affected close to 10-million birds and that sent the market to the races,” Tiles explained.\nMitlitsky’s suppliers have not been impacted, but many others are, causing stores to increase prices.\nNoel’s Market Manager, Bob Crowell, is getting the store ready for Christmas shoppers. Eggs seem to be on everyone’s list.\n“We were one of the lowest prices in town, everyone was coming here, then we had a spike from our retailer also so... all the prices are in line now,\" Crowell said.\nCrowell mentioned that some eggs have been hard to get, especially the 18-packs.\nKeri Vincent often shops for her eggs at Noel’s.\n“I really only ever come here because they seem to be the freshest,” she said.\nSome states require cage free hens, but that increases the price of eggs even more.\n“The cost rolls down to the consumer. Consumers are used to paying a dollar or two for eggs. Now they’re up on the shelves for five or six dollars,” said Matt Mitlitsky from Mitlitsky’s eggs.\nInflation is yet another factor causing this increase in egg prices.\n“They will come down. They go up and down every year. It was a record low for a while, then it shot back up,” Crowell said.\nAfter the holidays, the demand for eggs should go down, which will help to lower the prices.\nHowever, as winter approaches, storms could fluctuate prices again.\nCopyright 2024 WFSB.

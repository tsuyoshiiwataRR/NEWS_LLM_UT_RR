    "text": "By Cameron Kiszla ,\n4 hours ago\nDozens of people were reportedly sickened by norovirus at an event unveiling the Los Angeles Times’ list of the 101 best restaurants.\nThe party at the Hollywood Palladium earlier this month left more than 70 people feeling ill, the L.A. Taco reports .\nWhile some who were in attendance said they couldn’t be entirely sure what left them sick, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health on Wednesday advised of tainted oysters , including those under the Fanny Bay brand, which Times spokesperson Hillary Manning confirmed were served at the event.\n“We are still waiting for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to conclude their investigation, but it appears that the issue was specific to the supplier of the oysters, Fanny Bay Oysters. Fanny Bay Oysters originating from British Columbia, Canada, were sourced by Santa Monica Seafood, a sponsor and the seafood vendor of the event, and provided to one of the featured restaurants to serve,” Manning told L.A. Taco in a statement.\nIf you are infected with norovirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests you rest and drink plenty of fluids.

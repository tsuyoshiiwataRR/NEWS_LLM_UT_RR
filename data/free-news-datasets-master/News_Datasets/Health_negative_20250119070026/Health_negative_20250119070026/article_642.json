    "text": "We will have limited operations from 15:00 Tuesday 24 December 2024 (AEDT) until Thursday 2 January 2025. [Find out how to contact us during the holiday period](https://www.tga.gov.au/about-tga/contact-us/tga-operations-over-holiday-period-2024-25).\nBoston Scientific have advised that a subset of ACCOLADE™ dual chamber (DR) standard life (SL) and DR extended life (EL) pacemakers; and VISIONIST™ cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers (CRT-Ps) have an increased risk of permanently entering Safety Mode which has limited functionality.\nAffected Model numbers: L311, L331, U225, U226, U228\nProduct Names:\n- ACCOLADE DR SL MRI\n- ACCOLADE DR EL MRI\n- VISIONIST CRT-P EL\n- VISIONIST CRT-P EL MRI\nWhat is the problem?\nAffected devices are at risk of permanently entering Safety Mode during telemetry or other normal, higher-power operations. This has been associated with the pacemaker failing to adequately regulate the heart’s rhythm and rate in some patients.\nWhat are the risks?\nRisks associated with this problem occurring include:\n- Device replacement/surgery being required\n- Loss or pause of pacing activity that may result in death or serious injury in some patients not sufficiently treated by Safety Mode\n- Muscle stimulation\n- Heart failure.\nWhat should patients do?\n- Continue to have your device monitored, either remotely or through your existing in-office follow-up schedule.\n- If monitoring indicates your device has entered Safety Mode, immediately contact your treating clinician for a review and to discuss management options.\n- Also consult with your treating clinician if you:\n- have new or worsening symptoms such as light-headedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness or loss of consciousness\n- have any questions about your device potentially entering Safety Mode or\n- to determine the remaining battery life and whether or not the problem may affect you.\n- Should you be experiencing symptoms and unable to contact your clinician we recommend attending your nearest healthcare facility for assessment.\nWhat should health professionals do?\n- Monitor patients with affected pacemakers through remote or in-person visits.\n- When a device is in Safety Mode, you will be directed to contact Boston Scientific via the LATITUDE programmer warning screen and a LATITUDE remote patient management system red alert.\n- Monitor patients for symptoms indicating device performance problems, such as light-headedness or loss of consciousness.\n- General prophylactic device replacement is not recommended: unless a patient has a device in the advisory population and are at risk of harm due to non-programmable parameters in Safety Mode.\n- If monitoring indicates that the device has entered Safety Mode, arrange for the device to be replaced. Timely replacement is recommended to avoid risks associated with time spent in Safety Mode.\n- Detailed information can be found in the customer letter supplied to clinicians who have implanted this device.\nThe problem with these devices will be corrected by a software update. Boston Scientific will communicate when the update is available to detect the onset of a high impedance battery state.\nReporting problems\nConsumers and health professionals are encouraged to [report problems with medical devices](https://www.tga.gov.au/safety/reporting-problems). Your report will contribute to our monitoring of these products. For more information see the [TGA Incident Reporting and Investigation Scheme (IRIS)](https://www.tga.gov.au/resources/resource/reference-material/medical-device-incident-reporting-and-investigation-scheme-iris).\nWe cannot give advice about an individual's medical condition. You are strongly encouraged to talk with a health professional if you are concerned about a possible adverse event associated with a medical device.",

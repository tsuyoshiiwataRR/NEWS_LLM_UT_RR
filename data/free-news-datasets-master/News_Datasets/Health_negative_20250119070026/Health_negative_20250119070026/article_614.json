The singer confirmed, adding, “ The area where I’m bitten swells up severely like an edema and blisters form.”\nIU also expressed her frustration, mentioning that mosquitos often bite her face, leaving long-lasting scars. She revealed that she still has calloused skin on the area where she was bitten as a child. The singer finally declared that she hated mosquitos even more than cockroaches for this reason.\nMeanwhile, IU has been caught up in political strife recently, creating heated public discourse.

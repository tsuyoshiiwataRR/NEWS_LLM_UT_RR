    "text": "Frito-Lay recalls some Lay's chips over \"life-threatening\" allergy risk Anne Marie Lee Updated Thu, December 19, 2024 at 11:23 PM UTC 1 min read\nFrito-Lay is recalling a limited number of 13 oz. bags of Lay's Classic Potato Chips, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration citing the risk that some consumers could experience a \"life-theatening allergic reaction\" due to an undeclared allergen.\nThe FDA said it had been alerted by a consumer that the product might contain undeclared milk. The bags of chips affected by recall were distributed to some retail stores and e-commerce distributors in Oregon and Washington, and were available for sale beginning Nov. 3, 2024.\n\"Those with an allergy or severe sensitivity to milk run the risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume the recalled product,\" the FDA said in the recall notice posted Thursday.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement No allergic reactions related to the recall have been reported, according to the notice. Additionally, no other Lay's products, flavors, sizes or variety packs are affected.\nFrito-Lay is recalling a limited number of 13 oz. bags of Lay's Classic Potato Chips after being alerted by a consumer contact that the product may contain undeclared milk. / Credit: FDA The recalled chips include Lay's Classic Potato Chips, in flexible 13 oz. (368.5 grams) bags with UPC code 28400 31041, a \"Guaranteed Fresh\" date of 11 Feb 2025, and one of either two manufacturing codes: 6462307xx or 6463307xx.\nGeneral guidelines from the FDA advise consumers who have purchased any recalled food to dispose of the product or return it to the retailer for a full refund.\nIn a similar event, Costco in October recalled nearly 80,000 pounds of store-brand butter because the key ingredient, milk, was missing from the product's label.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Eye Opener: New details emerge in WI school shooting\nTeen shooter connected to man accused of plotting separate attack\n2 Republicans voted to release Ethics Committee's report on Matt Gaetz misconduct, sources say\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 20,000 people played the daily Crossword recently.

    "text": "BELOVED television news anchor Mark Spain has died following a battle with pancreatic cancer.\nSpain died on December 18, his family announced on Facebook.\nBeloved WTLV news anchor Mark Spain died on Wednesday Credit: WTLV Spain’s family shared on Facebook that it’s hard to believe that it’s been precisely three weeks since he received the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.\n“Our family was there with him from the beginning of the fight to the finish, until his very last breath! He fought hard, he stayed positive throughout the battle, and wasn’t afraid.\n“We have comfort in knowing he is no longer suffering, it was not easy watching him fight for his life and battle this disease, but he was not alone, and neither were we.”\nSpain was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer around Thanksgiving.\nA GoFundMe created just days before his death has raised $13,000.\nThose funds were said to go toward Spain’s medical bills, travel for treatment, and other needs.\nSpain’s career began in Cleveland where he worked as a paperboy from the time he was nine years old.\nAfter studying communications in college, he went on to work at several notable television stations, including First Coast news in Jacksonville, Florida.\n“We are deeply saddened to hear of Mark’s passing. He always worked to better the First Coast in every story he produced,” First Coast News General Manager Tim Thomas said.\n“Our thoughts are with his wife Lynita and his three children during this difficult time.”\nIn 2015, Spain moved to local ABC affiliate WSET in Lynchburg, Virginia.\nThere, he was a respected anchor on the network’s evening and late shows.\nHe shared the news of his cancer diagnosis with viewers just weeks ago in early December.\n“Our family along with the city of Lynchburg lost a man of hope, someone who loves his city and stood for equality, treating others with respect and kindness,” the Spain family’s statement continued.\n“He was a husband, father, brother, friend, and a positive light in the community. My first true love.\n“He brought so much joy, compassion, love, and strength into our lives, and his absence will be deeply felt by all who knew him.”",

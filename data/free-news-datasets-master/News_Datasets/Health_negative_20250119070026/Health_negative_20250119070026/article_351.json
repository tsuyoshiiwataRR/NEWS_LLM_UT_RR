    "text": "Former IZ*ONE member turned soloist Lee Chaeyeon will be going on a “dance hiatus,” so it seems.\nLee Chaeyeon | @chaestival_/Instagram In a series of Instagram updates, the soloist revealed the state of her herniated discs…\n| @chaestival_/Instagram Let’s stay together, friends… Please be good.\n— Chaeyeon\n…and commented that she won’t be pushing herself to dance for a while.\n| @chaestival_/Instagram It’s a wonder how they didn’t herniate before. They put in some work.\n— Chaeyeon\n| @chaestival_/Instagram No more warming up like this. Although… That does feel really good.\n— Chaeyeon\nWhile Chaeyeon promised to get right back to it “in the new year…”\n| @chaestival_/Instagram Closed… as in I won’t be dancing for a while, or whatever. I’ll be back on track by next year!\n— Chaeyeon\n…fans remain concerned for her, given her set schedule with SBS ‘s Shooting Stars (also known as Kick A Goal )—a show in which the soloist plays soccer, and are wishing her a restful time.\n| theqoo “Take care, Chaeyeon, I love watching you dance… Wishing you a full recovery so you can keep on dancing!” “My favorite idols all have herniated discs, too… So I feel for her. It must be so painful.” “Oh, no… Take care of yourself!” “Gosh, that looks painful as heck.” “Herniated discs and dancers go together hand-in-hand. That must be so painful.” Source: theqoo",

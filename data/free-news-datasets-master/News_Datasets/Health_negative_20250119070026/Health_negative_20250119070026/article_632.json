    "text": "Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche faced significant market pressure following disappointing results from its Phase IIb \"Padova\" study of the Parkinson's disease drug Prasinezumab. The clinical trial, which involved 586 early-stage Parkinson's patients over a 76-week period, failed to achieve its primary objective of significantly delaying disease progression symptoms. Despite showing potential clinical efficacy, the statistical significance threshold remained unmet, leading to immediate repercussions in market trading. The news triggered a notable decline in Roche's share price on the Swiss Stock Exchange (SIX), with shares dropping as much as 2.9% to reach a daily low of 247.30 CHF.\nMarket Outlook\nDespite the current setback, analysts maintain an optimistic long-term perspective on Roche's market position. The stock, while currently trading 15.51% below its 52-week high of 288.20 CHF from early September, remains well above its May low of 212.90 CHF. Analysts project an average price target of 274.29 CHF, and shareholders can anticipate an increased dividend of 9.81 CHF for the current fiscal year, up from the previous year's 9.60 CHF.\nAd\nRoche Stock: New Analysis - 20 December\nFresh Roche information released.

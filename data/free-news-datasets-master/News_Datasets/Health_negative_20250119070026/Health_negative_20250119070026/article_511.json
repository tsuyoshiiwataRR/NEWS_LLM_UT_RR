    "text": "Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom declared a State of Emergency over the Bird Flu – with less than one week before Christmas, and many upcoming turkey dinners.\nHere are Cliff Notes from Gov. Newsom’s emergency declaration:\n“Following the spread of Bird Flu in sixteen states, including in California and outside the Central Valley, Governor Newsom proclaimed a State of Emergency today to further enhance the state ‘s preparedness and accelerate the ongoing cross-agency response efforts.”\nHere is what Newsom’s “proactive action” said:\nGovernor Gavin Newsom today proclaimed a State of Emergency to streamline and expedite the state ’s response to Avian influenza A (H5N1), commonly known as “ Bird Flu .” This action comes as cases were detected in dairy cows on farms in Southern California, signaling the need to further expand monitoring and build on the coordinated statewide approach to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus. The virus has spread in 16 states among dairy cattle, following its first confirmed detection in Texas and Kansas in March 2024.\nTo date, no person-to-person spread of Bird Flu has been detected in California and nearly all infected individuals had exposure to infected cattle. California has already established the largest testing and monitoring system in the nation to respond to the outbreak.\nThis emergency proclamation will provide state and local agencies with additional flexibility around staffing, contracting, and other rules to support California’s evolving response.\nIs this Newsom’s attempt to gain emergency powers all over again? Deja vu Covid? Or to control the farming, ranching, cattle and dairy industries? Is this an effort to grab some federal emergency funds? Or is there another lockdown coming?\nThe Libs of Tik Tok posted and questioned Newsom’s State of Emergency declaration on X:\n“JUST IN: Governor Gavin Newsom just issued a state of emergency in California in response to concerns over bird flu reports. Newsom stated that he will “take all necessary steps to prevent the spread of this virus” It’s COVID all over again.”\nThe Governor’s press office replied (sounds like Brandon, He/Him):\nThis response begs the question of whether his declaration is even legal – Newsom and his office admitted:\nThis isn’t COVID-19.\nRisk is very low.\nThis is proactive to protect public health + Ag industry.\nBird flu isn’t spreading person-to-person.\nNo public mask mandates or restrictions.\nAvoid raw milk & unnecessary contact with livestock.\nThat, and with no animal-to-human transmission, it’s not that serious. California law states that there must be “conditions of disaster or of extreme peril” for a State of Emergency, as Globe contributor Chris Micheli reported in 2020.\nCalifornia attorney Laura Powell said on X , “If the risk is very low, the emergency declaration is unlawful.”\nEven when Newsom made his State of Emergency declaration in March 2020 with Covid (with a 99% survival rate), I questioned and challenged it – which lasted three years. Newsom should have focused all of the state’s efforts on the elderly and ailing in skilled nursing facilities, and let everyone else conduct their lives normally. There would be fewer dead today if he had, and businesses and the economy would not have been decimated.\nOn a very interesting yet serious angle, Dr. Peter McCullough and John Leake from Courageous Discourse™ are suspicious of the H5N1 and explain:\n“Fatal influenza A infection in cattle is unprecedented. With California declaring a public health emergency, everyone should be asking where it came from.\n“In spite of fatal influenza A infections in cattle being unprecedented, we are being told that—quite suddenly in the year 2024—Highly Pathogenic Influenza A subtype H5N1 (a form of Avian Influenza or “Bird Flu”) has been detected in dairy cattle herds in Texas and other states.\nStrangely enough, I cannot find a single serious investigative report—conducted by large animal veterinarians—that attempts to answer how and why this particular virus (classified as HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b) has so dramatically expanded its host range into a bovine animals with lethal effect.\nThe only report I can find is a fluff piece published by the American Veterinarian Medical Association (AVMA) titled Diligent detective work leads to discovery of HPAI in dairy cattle: A network of bovine and diagnostic veterinarians make the connection between cat and bird deaths and sick cows.\nNot once in the report do the “diligent detectives” ask about the origin of this infection in cattle. Is it possible that this unprecedented and lethal influenza A infection in cattle came out of a lab?”\nThey say the public should be aware of the highly suspicious circumstances of this incident and Governor Newsom’s State of Emergency declaration.\nIt’s not a stretch to question if this is a lob at Robert Kennedy Jr., and the Make America Healthy Again movement. Newsom specifically says to avoid raw milk, yet there is no shortage of pasteurized milk and products.\nJust asking questions… again. Remember , Newsom was the first governor in the country to lock down an entire state under the guise of public safety over a virus – he shut down “non-essential” businesses including churches, while allowing cannabis businesses , marijuana dispensaries , bars and strip clubs and big box stores to remain open. Newsom’s lockdowns lasted just shy of three years. Very undemocratic. Very authoritarian, autocratic, oppressive and tyrannical. California was even named the most restrictive state of 51 , with the most COVID restrictions (lockdowns, mandatory masking, mandatory vaccines) in a survey of all of the states.\nNewsom’s record is clear – he is unjust and tyrannical – a hostis publicus, public enemy, acting against the interests of the people and the nation.\nWe will keep you posted.",

    "text": "Georgia quarterback Carson Beck (elbow) is expected to miss the team's College Football Playoff quarterfinal game at the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1, On3 reported Thursday. That means backup Gunner Stockton is in line to start the knockout round game, when the Bulldogs face either No. 7 seed Notre Dame or No. 10 seed Indiana. Beck, the Bulldogs' starter all year, missed most of the second half of the Southeastern Conference title game with an injury to the UCL in his right (throwing) elbow. Stockton helped guide the Bulldogs to a 22-19 overtime win over Texas and clinch a first-round bye in the first 12-team playoff. On3 reported that Beck has not practiced or been with the team since it returned to workouts late last week. It is unknown whether Beck would be ready to return for the semifinal round if the Bulldogs make it that far. Beck has thrown for 3,485 yards, 28 touchdowns and 12 interceptions this season, his second as Georgia's starting quarterback. --Field Level Media\nPost a comment as anonymous\nReport\nWatch this discussion.

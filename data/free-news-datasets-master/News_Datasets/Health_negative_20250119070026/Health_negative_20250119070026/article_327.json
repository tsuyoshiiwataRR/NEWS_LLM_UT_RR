    "text": "Fort Leonard Wood, Mo. (KY3)—According to lawmakers, General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital could be downsized to a clinic.\nSenator Josh Hawley recently sent a letter to the Defense Health Agency (DHA) with concern due to receiving reports that the General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital could be downgraded.\n“Why is this even a discussion? Is my question,” said Veteran Kristine Erb. “To look at shutting this hospital down, in my opinion, is a slap in the face to every veteran, retiree, and their dependents,” said Veteran Donald Johnson.\nBoth veterans said if the hospital is downsized, it’ll impact thousands.\n“Pulaski County has nearly 53,000 residents, Fort Leonard Wood has nearly 15,000 active duty service members with trainees coming in every two months,” Johnson said. “To have those important resources (possibly) taken from us is a travesty to me. It’s a major issue,” Erb said.\nOn its Facebook page, the FLW Hospital calls the possible changes ‘pre-decisional.’\nKY3 contacted the Defense Health Agency (DHA) for an interview. KY3 received the following statement:\n“Beginning in December 2023, the department undertook comprehensive analyses to assign military medical personnel in locations that best ensure readiness, quality, safe and accessible care.\nThe DoD is identifying potential adjustments to medical treatment facilities (MTFs) that achieve these outcomes and support our military missions. In some locations, military medical staffing will increase; in others, more medical services may be delivered by TRICARE network providers.\nInternal analysis is still underway, and the Department has not made any decisions yet. Once decisions are made, the DoD will communicate with beneficiaries, leaders, Congress, and all stakeholders well before any actions take effect.\nLocal Government Employee Union President Liz Fancher said more than just veterans, military members, and their families will be impacted if something happens to the hospital.\n“A few of our members are nurses throughout the hospital. We have lab techs, we have everyone like x-ray folks, those folks will be detrimentally impacted. This is their job. They take care of these soldiers, and they are good at their job,” Fancher said.\n“It would cause us extra expense, extra time, extra worry having to get to Rolla or Springfield or Columbia or Jefferson City medical facilities,” said Johnson.\nWe asked DHA leaders multiple questions about these possible changes to FLW healthcare but were only given the statement above.\nTo report a correction or typo, please email digitalnews@ky3.com .

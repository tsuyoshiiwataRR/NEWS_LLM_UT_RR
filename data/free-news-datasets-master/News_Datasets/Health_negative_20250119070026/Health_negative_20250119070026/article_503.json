    "text": "Audio recorded by retired U.S. Army Sergeant Donald Belzer, and provided to The Tennessee Star, confirmed through the White House VA Hotline that the Amarillo Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System was made aware of the complaint the veteran filed in 2022, when Belzer said he captured video depicting two VA staff members engaged in a sex act inside a clean supplies closet.\nBelzer recorded the audio after The Star published the video , recorded by the veteran on August 17, 2022, as the veteran called the White House hotline to obtain copies of the complaints he filed with the Thomas E. Creek VA Medical Center and the White House hotline in August 2022 and April 2023.\nA staff member for the hotline, which was established by President-elect Donald Trump in 2019, a note was entered to Belzer’s April 27 complaint by Amarillo VA staff on May 1, confirming the veteran notified the federal agency of the alleged sex act between its employees.\nReading from the May 1 note, the hotline staff member told Belzer, “On August 17 of 2022, at 12:53, the veteran was in the Emergency Room at the VA Medical Center and saw two staff members having sex in a clean linen closet.”\nDespite confirming the content of the May 1 note applied to Belzer’s complaint, the staff member additionally told the veteran the text of the May 1 note could only be provided by the Thomas E. Creek\nDocuments obtained by Belzer after completing a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking information from the Amarillo VA appear to be missing the note acknowledging his complaint alleging two staff members engaged in a sex act inside a closet just feet away from him.\nThe Star contacted the Amarillo VA, which confirmed after the video was published that it is investigating the alleged sex act , to confirm it still holds the April complaint and clarify whether the investigation began before or after Belzer sent the video to The Star .\nBelzer told The Star he sent the video after learning of the ongoing probe in the U.S. House Veterans Affairs committee investigating allegations of sex at the workplace at a VA health care center in Johnson City, Tennessee, which Breitbart News recently reported sparked a series of resignations, including from one man who apparently resigned after investigators determined he engaged in sex acts with 32 employees.\n– – –\nTom Pappert is the lead reporter for The Tennessee Star , and also reports for The Pennsylvania Daily Star and The Arizona Sun Times .

    "text": "Michael James Georges\nAugust 15, 1952 - December 15, 2024\nMarblehead - Michael James Georges of Marblehead, passed away peacefully on December 15, 2024 surrounded by his loving family after a brief and courageous battle with cancer. He was a true Marbleheader, born at Mary Alley Hospital on August 15,1952 and resided in the town for the majority of his life.\nMichael attended the Devereux School, founded by his Mother Elizabeth (Dooling) Georges and her sisters, Mildred, Anna, and Helen Dooling, then Star of the Sea School and graduated from St.John's Preparatory School. He was the grandson of Irish and Greek immigrants and strongly identified with his heritage. In Mike's early years he had a passion for martial arts, weight training, film, music and foreign languages. He considered his experience with Outward Bound and Hurricane Island to have a profound effect on building his character.\nMichael enlisted in the Navy and was proud of his service during the Vietnam War as a firefighter on Crash Crew 9. A monumental event during this time was being a first responder to the 1973 Blue Angels mid-air collision in Lakehurst, NJ. He spoke fondly of the memories made with his fellow servicemen, some of whom introduced him to the Blues which led to a lifelong passion of listening to and playing blues guitar. He especially loved delta blues, fingerpicking guitar and dobro and was greatly influenced by Reverend Gary Davis, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Charley Patton and later his all-time favorite, Johnny Winter.\nFollowing his service, Mike attended Salem State College and received his Bachelor's Degree Summa Cum Laude with a double major in Biology and Chemistry. He went on to obtain a Masters Degree in Organic Chemistry from Tufts University and then pursued Doctoral Studies at Harvard University while working and teaching in a research lab.\nMichael combined his love of music and business to later open a retail music store, Marblehead Stringed Instruments, where he sold a variety of instruments and created a popular series of instructional guitar lessons on tape known as \"Broke and Hungry Music\". He also gave private lessons, impacting so many young musicians in town. He later partnered with his former spouse Kendy to co-own and operate the original Marblehead School of Music.\nMichael's love of learning led to a change in his career path. He received a second Masters Degree in Corporate Finance, became a licensed CPA, and worked as an accountant for many years. Mike always built strong connections with his colleagues, most recently at FX Messina, where Margaret, Arthur, Joe, Laura, April, Robin, and the Messina family all kept a very special place in his heart.\nMichael was truly a lifelong student and learner and used his broad interests to connect with anyone he's ever met in a very thoughtful and personal way. Whether it be through language, history, music, science, or cultures, he not only became an expert in the craft, but valued the personal connection he could make through his passions.\nOf all his accomplishments, Michael was most proud of the family he built with the love of his life and former wife, Kendall (Callahan). They married in 1987 and honeymooned in Ireland to connect with their heritage. They settled and raised their two beautiful daughters Elizabeth and Anna in a home on \"the Avenue\" that was built in the 1800's by Mike's Irish immigrant grandfather Joe Dooling. Michael was a devoted father who went above and beyond for his girls. He prided himself on making a home filled with laughter, love, and music that was always open to the girls' friends and the family's loved ones. His devotion and love continued to grow when he became a grandfather to his beloved Flynn and Maisie, who affectionately referred to him as \"Pa\".\nMichael is predeceased by his mother, Elizabeth Dooling Georges (Betty), his uncle John Reilly, and his mother's sisters Mildred, Anna, Helen and Mary, who Dad always referred to as \"The Aunts\". They were all wonderful role models and helped shape the person that Michael became. He is survived by his adored daughters Elizabeth (Georges) Kelley and her husband Sean Kelley, Anna Georges and her partner Samuel Rizos, his beloved grandchildren Flynn and Maisie Kelley, his former wife and best friend Kendall Clark and her husband Bill Clark, and his much loved extended family Jean Eldridge, Lois Fallon and the Callahan clan.\nHis funeral will be held at Our Lady Star of the Sea Church, 85 Atlantic Ave, Marblehead on Saturday December 21, 2024 at 10:30 am. Visiting hours will be held at the Murphy Funeral Home, 85 Federal St, Salem on Friday from 4pm to 7 pm. Relatives and friends are respectfully invited to attend.

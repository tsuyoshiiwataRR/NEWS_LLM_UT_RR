    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - Choosing a health insurance plan and getting registered can be daunting, making some people a target of scammers trying to steal their personal information.\nKC Care tells us they’re hearing from so many people complaining about calls, texts and even emails selling health care, or baiting people to give up information.\n“You’ll start to see a lot of those scam calls or text messages anytime during any open enrollment period, that’s really when they’re just trying to get all of your personal information,” said Emily Dreher, with KC Care.\nKC care is a non-profit organization that provides health care services, but it also has insurance navigators. Those navigators help clients check Midssouri Medicaid eligibility or help them navigate the healthcare marketplace. It’s one of a few community health centers providing the service.\nDreher says a navigator can help people enroll in the plan that best suits them. Scammers may try to pressure people into a specific plan.\nSome scammers are promising free groceries or services to persuade people to give up information. As always, if something sounds too good to be true, it’s probably a scam.\n“If you’re not expecting a phone call or a text message from someone, that’s your number one red flag,” said Dreher. “Just always trust your gut. Do not provide your information to them.”\nDreher suggests simply hanging up and calling your insurance company directly to check they have the right information.\nCopyright 2024 KCTV.

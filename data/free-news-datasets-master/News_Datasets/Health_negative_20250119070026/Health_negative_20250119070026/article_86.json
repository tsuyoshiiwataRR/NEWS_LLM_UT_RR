    "text": "Smartwatches and fitness trackers are bought to keep tabs on health, but they could potentially make it worse. It’s all about the strap.\nWrist devices might pose a health threat due to high levels of PFHxA, a chemical found in the fluorinated rubber of premium bands. Devices could expose owners to harmful “forever chemicals.” A study published on December 18 in the journal ACS Environmental Science & Technology Letters, found that more expensive bands made from fluorinated synthetic rubber contained high levels of perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA).\nPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of chemicals that do two things really well: they stick around in the environment almost forever and repel water, sweat, and grease. That’s why manufacturers include these chemicals in many consumer products—stain-resistant bedding, menstrual products, fitness apparel, and notably, smartwatch bands.\nThe rubber contains fluoroelastomers, synthetic rubbers made with PFAS to prevent discoloration and repel dirt. They can also be a source of compounds that get under the user’s skin. Thus, Graham Peaslee, lead author of the study, and Alissa Wix with Heather Whitehead, funded by the University of Notre Dame, investigated several commercially available watch straps for the presence of fluorine, as well as 20 separate PFAS.\nThe team tested 22 bands from various brands across different price ranges: most were newly purchased, but some were already worn. Bands costing over $30 contained more fluorine than those priced under $15. Then, after chemical extraction, all bands were tested for 20 different kinds of PFAS. PFHxA turned out to be the most common and was found in nine of the 22 tested bands. The average concentration of PFHxA was nearly 800 parts per billion (ppb), with one sample exceeding 16,000 ppb. For comparison, previous studies of cosmetics conducted by the team in 2023 found an average PFAS concentration of about 200 ppb.\nResearchers speculate that the large amount of PFHxA found in bands could be due to the use of the compound as a surfactant during the production of fluoroelastomers. A significant percentage could pass through human skin under normal conditions. Scientists emphasize that further research is needed to elucidate the health impact of PFHxA. Until the issue is more thoroughly investigated, they recommend using cheaper silicone bands.\nSource: SciTechDaily",

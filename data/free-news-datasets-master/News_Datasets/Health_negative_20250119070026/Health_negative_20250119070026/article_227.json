    "text": "(WXYZ) — Eating and drinking are a big part of holiday celebrations. But for some, overindulging can trigger a condition called holiday heart syndrome.\nBy the sound of it, you might think \"holiday heart\" means a heart full of joy. But it's actually the opposite. Holiday heart can happen when too much alcohol, salty foods and sweets put stress on your heart. This can cause your heart to beat irregularly, which we in the medical field call atrial fibrillation, or AFib. AFib happens when the electrical signals in the heart's upper chambers don’t work properly, causing a fast, pounding heartbeat.\nThe reason it's called holiday heart syndrome is that we see a lot of cases this time of year when people are enjoying festive foods and cocktails.\nNow, who's most at risk? People with existing heart issues are definitely at higher risk. However, holiday heart syndrome can happen to anyone. In the short term, it can be a worrisome side effect of overindulging. But over time, it may lead to more dangerous conditions like heart failure or stroke.\nFor some folks, they may feel like their heart is racing out of control. Others might notice irregular beats. Other common symptoms include:\n- Chest discomfort, pain or pressure\n- Dizziness or lightheadedness\n- Shortness of breath\n- Feeling overly tired or drained of energy\nIf you notice any of these, please stop drinking alcohol right away. Most of the time, holiday heart syndrome clears up on its own. But if the symptoms stick around, or you get unusually winded walking on flat ground, these are red flags. It's best to head to the emergency room to get checked out.\nNow, I would recommend that folks avoid holiday heart syndrome, and here are some tips:\n- Watch your alcohol: avoid drinking too much or binge drinking\n- Eat Smart: fill up on healthy options first and go easy on salty or fatty foods\n- Manage Stress: it can take a toll on your heart, so find ways to relax\n- Know Your Limits: If you have a history of heart issues, talk to your doctor about what is safe for you\nAlso, be cautious with medications like NSAIDs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. While they can help with hangover symptoms, they might raise your blood pressure and increase your risk of heart issues.\nThe holidays are a time to celebrate, but keeping things in moderation will help you enjoy them safely.\nTHIS WEEK ON 'THE DR. NANDI SHOW'\nCurious about boosting emotional health? Dr. Partha Nandi, MD, delves into the Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), commonly known as “Tapping,” to show how this powerful practice can help release negative emotions and enhance well-being. Nick Ortner, New York Times bestselling author and CEO of The Tapping Solution, shares his experiences and valuable advice on using this simple, effective, natural healing method. Also, EFT Practitioner Julie Booksh presents a tapping demo, so you can try this transformative technique yourself. Tune in this Sunday, Dec. 22 at 2 p.m.",

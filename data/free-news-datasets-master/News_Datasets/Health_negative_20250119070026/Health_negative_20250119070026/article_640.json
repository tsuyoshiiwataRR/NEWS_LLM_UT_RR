    "text": "19 minutes ago Teriyaki Madness Inspection Report Photo by Teriyaki Madness/Edited by Gary Smith/Canva/GR Teriyaki Madness in Hoover, Alabama, received a score of 74 during a routine inspection by the Jefferson County Department of Health on December 10, 2024. The Asian restaurant, located at 4741 Chace Cir #113, was cited for 8 violations , including 5 priority infractions.\nState records showed that the inspection revealed issues with hand-washing practices, food safety certification, and proper storage of personal items.\nAccording to the inspector's note, priority violations included employees observed not washing their hands for the required 15 seconds when returning to workstations and changing hand wear without proper hand washing. The restaurant lacked a certified manager on-site and employees with food handler cards.\nOther priority violations contained an expired chemical test kit, a mop bucket obstructing access to a hand sink, and personal medications stored incorrectly.\nTeriyaki Madness also failed to display its current permit and maintain the cleanliness of ceiling tiles and vent covers.\nDespite correcting some priority violations on-site, Teriyaki Madness will require a follow-up inspection within 60 days due to its score falling between 70 and 84.\nThis Hoover, Alabama, restaurant remains open but must rectify these violations to improve its compliance with food safety regulations.\nThe last noted inspection at this location was on February 6, 2024, when the restaurant had a 94 score.\nWhen writing this report, Teriyaki Madness has a 4.0-star rating from 281 opinions on Google reviews.\nPriority Violations:\nUnsuitable hand-washing practices Absence of certified manager and food handler certifications Expired cleaning test kit Obstructed access to hand sink Unsuitable storage of personal medications Please Share Your Thought:\nHow often do you check restaurant inspection scores before dining out? Do you think the current grading system effectively communicates a restaurant's food safety standards to the public?\nJefferson County, AL Alabama Government Politics AL Food Safety AL Home & Living Alabama restaurant inspections 1",

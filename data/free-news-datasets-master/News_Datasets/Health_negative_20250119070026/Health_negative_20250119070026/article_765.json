    "text": "At least 5 cases of Whooping Cough in Ector County\nODESSA, Texas (KOSA) - Ector County is seeing a rise in Pertussis cases, or Whooping Cough.\nFirst Alert 7 reached out to the City of Midland, a spokesperson told First Alert 7 that there has not yet been any reports of the cough this year.\nSince the month of November, the Ector County Health Department reports there has been five confirmed Pertussis cases. Odessa High School reported two of those confirmed cases.\nAccording to the Texas Department of State Health Services, there has been triple the number of Pertussis cases in 2024 compared to 2023.\nInfected people are most contagious up to 21 days after the cough begins.\nNazareth Castro, an epidemiologist with the Ector County Health Department said it, “Easily spread through coughing sneezing, especially during the time of the running nose that is where you see the most contagious part of the disease.”\nSymptoms include low fever, runny nose, mild cough and apnea that can last for one to two weeks. As the disease progresses more sever symptoms can develop including paroxysms, vomiting and exhaustion.\nDirector of the Ector County Health Department, Brandy Garcia, said, “It will start developing a pretty significant cough and that cough will have a whooping cough sound and that’s where the whooping sound and that is where the whooping cough comes from.”\nA concern for the health department is the holiday season. With five confirmed cases already, the disease could spread. Garcia said, “When people congregate together and do more gatherings of course all illnesses are easy to spread during those times so we see a lot more during the holiday season because that is when people come together.”\nThere is a vaccine for Pertussis. The D-TAP vaccination can be administered to infants, young children, teens, pregnant women and adults.\n“The D-TAP is the vaccine that is recommended for that and you start that off at two months old so you get 2, 4, 6, and 12 months and 4 to 6 years. Throughout your life, you can still get vaccinated for pertussis so that will be T-DAP is what you get when your teenagers and adolescents,” Garcia said. “We do recommend throughout your life you do get vaccinated for this illness.”\nIf you do test positive for Pertussis you can visit your physician for treatment. You can schedule an appointment for a vaccine with the[ Ector County Health Department](https://www.co.ector.tx.us/page/ector.healthimmunizations).\nCopyright 2024 KOSA. All rights reserved.",

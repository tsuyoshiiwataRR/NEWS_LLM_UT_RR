    "text": "The DUP Health Spokesperson stated:\n“On 10th December, I raised concerns in the NI Assembly with the Minister, Mike Nesbitt, about the lack of accreditation for cervical screening within the Belfast Trust and the awarding of the regional HPV testing contract to the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH).\nSince then, I have received additional information, including the resignation letters of two senior medics and a further letter to the Minister questioning these same issues. Alarm bells should ring when professionals with oversight of such a critical programme raise such serious concerns. What is needed now is full disclosure, openness, and transparency from both the Department and the Trust regarding these matters.\nConfidence in the effectiveness of cervical screening is of paramount importance to women across Northern Ireland. Accreditation is designed to ensure that policies and processes are followed and that standards are met. It is therefore incomprehensible that, despite having its accreditation suspended, the Belfast Trust was still permitted to submit an expression of interest for the regional HPV cervical screening service. Why was this allowed?\nI have also written to ask whether the new HPV laboratory is still operating without accreditation, and whether smear tests are being sent to Gateshead. If so, at what additional cost to the public purse?\nI have previously called for a public inquiry into the scandal within the Southern Trust, which impacted 17,000 women, eight of whom developed cancer after their smear tests were misread. Tragically, two of these women have since passed away. However, there is now mounting concern about the cervical screening programme on a province-wide level. Any inquiry must be broadened to investigate beyond the Southern Trust.\nWomen across Northern Ireland deserve prompt and decisive action to restore their trust in cervical screening. The public demands answers and accountability from those responsible for creating this appalling situation.”",

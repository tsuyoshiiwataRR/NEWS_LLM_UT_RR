    "text": "BILLINGS — Chronic wasting disease was detected for the first time in central Montana this season in a mule deer buck from hunting district 515 and a whitetail buck from HD 525, both harvested by hunters.\nCWD had not been found previously in these districts.\nThe mule deer from HD 515 was shot north of Columbus and the white-tailed deer from HD 525 was killed west of Nye. After testing protocol, both deer were tested twice to confirm the positive results.\nThroughout 2024 so far, nearly 9,000 CWD samples have been collected from deer, elk and moose across the state. A majority of the animals sampled were hunter-harvested but also included roadkill and CWD symptomatic animals. Of those tested so far, 321 were confirmed to have CWD.\nCWD is a contagious neurological disease that can infect deer, elk and moose. It is always fatal, and there is no known cure. It was first detected in Montana’s wild herds in 2017. The disease is known to exist in various regions of Montana, including multiple other hunting districts in south-central Montana.\nHunting is the primary tool for monitoring and managing the spread of CWD through testing of harvested animals. Hunters can also help slow the spread of CWD by disposing of animal carcasses properly after filling their tag. This includes leaving carcass remains at the kill site when possible or bagging the carcass and disposing of it in a Class II landfill.\nHunters can still get their harvested animals tested for CWD throughout the muzzleloader heritage season and the elk shoulder season. FWP has online resources for hunters to collect and submit samples themselves. Hunters can also have FWP staff test their animals at the Region 5 office in Billings (2300 Lake Elmo Dr.), Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Call ahead at 406-247-2940 to ensure someone is available to collect your sample. Testing for CWD is free of charge and voluntary in most places in Montana.\nBozeman hunters can take their animals to the FWP office on South 19th Avenue.\nThere is no known transmission of CWD to humans. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hunters harvesting deer, elk or moose from an area where CWD is known to exist have their animal tested prior to consuming the meat and do not consume the meat if the animal tests positive.\nFor more information on CWD in Montana, visit fwp.mt.gov/cwd .\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters (0 Ratings)",

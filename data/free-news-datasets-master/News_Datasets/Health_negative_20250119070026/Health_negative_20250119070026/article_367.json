    "text": "By Marisa Losciale ,\n1 hours ago\nPhil Collins is laying out his reasons for retiring from the drums two years ago in a raw new interview.\nIn the documentary Phil Collins: Drummer First , which premiered on Wednesday, the eight-time Grammy winner offered intimate details and new insight into his decades-long career, revealing the real reason he had to step away from the kit.\n🤩🤩 SIGN UP for Parade's Trending News newsletter & we'll keep you in the know on the viral pop culture moments & celebrity news everyone is talking about 🗞️🗞️\nDuring interviews conducted shortly after Collins announced he was retiring from music in March 2022, he revealed that his decision to put the sticks down—a skill he's practiced since he was about 5—was driven by health reasons.\n\"I'm 71, I've been playing drums all my life,\" he said in the doc. \"To suddenly not be able to do that is a shock.\"\n\"It’s still kind of sinking in a bit,\" he admitted.\n\"The drumming has taken its toll on my hands, legs,\" the \"You'll Be in My Heart\" artist shared. \"I just feel like I've used up all my air miles,\" Collins, now 73, later joked.\nIn the Dec. 18 release , the Genesis musician's 23-year-old son, Nic Collins , went into detail about the injuries his father sustained from 50 years of touring. The ailments included back issues over the years followed by a \"big surgery on his neck [in 2015] that stemmed from all those years playing drums and bad posture.\"\nIt also \"caused him to have a drop-foot,\" Nic said, explaining that his father \"has like no sensation\" and lacks \"control\" over his feet, which is why he \"can't really play drums\" and now walks with a cane.\n\"If I can't do what I did as well as I did it, I'd rather relax and not do anything,\" the English musician concluded elsewhere in the documentary. \"If I wake up one day and I can hold a pair of drumsticks, then I will have a crack at it.\"\nPhil Collins: Drummer First is now streaming on YouTube.\nNext: U2’s Larry Mullen Jr. Reveals Health Diagnosis That Makes Him \"Look Pained\" While Drumming\n2",

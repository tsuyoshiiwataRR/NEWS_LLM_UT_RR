    "text": "[Celebrity](/celebrity/)\n“Song Mino Unable to Perform Normal Activities, CCTV Preserved”: How Did He Manage a Hawaii Trip and “New Journey to the West”?\nWINNER’s Song Mino has found himself at the center of controversy as explanations regarding allegations of negligence during his alternative service have only fueled the debate\nOn December 19, A, the person in charge of the Mapo Resident Convenience Facility, where [Song Mino](/tag/song-mino/) is serving as a public service worker, commented on his health condition, “He’s unable to carry out normal activities. His body is heavily subdued, almost as if under the influence of medication, and there are cycles where his symptoms worsen. March and April were difficult, and October through December were particularly bad.”\nSong Mino had previously spoken openly about his struggles with panic disorder and bipolar disorder. As a result, he was classified as a Grade 4 reservist and assigned to alternative service as a public service worker.\nHowever, despite A’s explanation, public backlash has intensified. Reports revealed that Song Mino took a six-day trip to Hawaii in October, which directly conflicts with A’s claim that his condition significantly worsened during that month due to mental health issues.\nFurther skepticism has arisen from Song Mino’s prior activities. Before enlistment, he actively pursued his music career with album releases and concerts, and also participated in entertainment programs like “New Journey to the West”. Critics argue that if his condition deteriorates during March~April and October~December as claimed, it would have been impossible for him to film “New Journey to the West” or “Peak Time” during those overlapping periods.\nAdding to the controversy, rumors of a two-year romantic relationship with actress Park Ju-hyun, reportedly starting in 2022, have further complicated the situation.\nAccordingly, both the [Military Manpower Administration and the police have launched investigations](/dispatch-accuses-song-mino-winner-of-neglecting-duties-during-military-service-receiving-special-treatment-from-superiors/). A confirmed that the Military Manpower Administration had visited the site to review related materials such as CCTV footage and attendance records. Police also requested that the CCTV footage be preserved. Additionally, Song Mino has been instructed to submit documentation addressing allegations of negligence and falsification of attendance records.\nCurrently on medical leave, Song Mino is scheduled to be discharged from service on December 23.",

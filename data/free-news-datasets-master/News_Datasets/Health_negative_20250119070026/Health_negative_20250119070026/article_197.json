    "text": "Columbia, S.C. (WACH) — Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court announcing they will review South Carolina’s effort to defund Planned Parenthood (PPSA).\nEver since Planned Parenthood South Atlantic patient Julie Edwards, filed a lawsuit in 2018, the U.S. District court has permanently blocked Governor McMaster's executive order. That allows South Carolina patients enrolled in Medicaid to continue receiving care from the facilities.\nThe order issued by the Governor in 2018, attempted to prevent people enrolled in Medicaid programs from accessing preventative care at Planned Parenthood South Atlantic health centers in Charleston and Columbia.\nSouth Carolina is one of dozens of states that have passed laws restricting access to abortion after the supreme court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\nFederal law prohibits states from interfering with Medicaid patients’ access, giving them the right to visit any qualified family provider that accepts Medicaid, including those that provide abortion like PPSA.\nSouth Carolina is now asking judges to review their decision to block funding to planned parenthood for the third time\nIn a statement, PPSA President, Jenny Black said:\nThis case is politics at its worst: Anti-abortion politicians using their power to target planned parenthood and block people who use Medicaid as their primary form of insurance from getting essential health care like cancer screenings and birth control.\nGovernor Henry McMaster this week, saying he’s “confident” the U.S. Supreme Court will side with him this time around. McMaster saying taxpayer dollar should never fund abortion providers like Planned Parenthood.\nAccess to abortion has led to rallies at the state house since Roe v. Wade was overturned as South Carolina lawmakers then took on this issue themselves.\nCurrent state law prohibits abortion at the six week of a pregnancy or as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected with exceptions in cases of rape, incest or health of the mother.\nSeveral states have also enacted laws blocking planned parenthood from receiving Medicaid funding,\nPPSA said in a statement that they continue to be a South Carolina Medicaid provider as this case moves forward.",

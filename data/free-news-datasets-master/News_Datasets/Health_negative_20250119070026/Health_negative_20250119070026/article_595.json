    "text": "3 weeks after pancreatic cancer diagnosis, former Jacksonville TV news anchor dies at 64\nFormer Jacksonville television news anchor Mark Spain has died at age 64, just three weeks after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.\nIn a Facebook post Thursday, his wife of 23 years, Lynita Carter Spain, wrote that he \"fought hard … stayed positive throughout the battle and wasn't afraid.\"\nHe was a \"man of hope, someone who loves his city and stood for equality, treating others with respect and kindness. He was a husband, father, brother, friend and a positive light in the community. My first true love.\"\nEven as he battled cancer, Spain \"encouraged those around him. He loved to help others and longed for peace and was an ambassador for positivity,\" she wrote. \"He loved his family and was extremely proud of his children.\"\nThe couple had two daughters and a son.\n\"He brought so much joy, compassion, love and strength into our lives and his absence will be deeply felt,\" she said. \"It’s surreal that it was exactly three weeks ago yesterday that he was diagnosed … It was not easy watching him fight for his life and battle this disease, but he was not alone and neither were we.\"\nSpain was a news anchor and reporter for First Coast News from 2000 to 2007, according to his Linkedin page. He then held the same roles at [Action News Jax](https://www.jacksonville.com/story/entertainment/local/2014/08/30/action-news-mark-spain-anchors-final-newscast-jacksonville/15789363007/) from 2007 to 2014 until he was one of [five anchors let go](https://www.jacksonville.com/story/entertainment/local/2014/05/28/stub-304/15795170007/). In 2015 he joined ABC 13 in Lynchburg, Va., where he was a lead anchor of the evening and late shows.\nHe loved being a journalist.\n\"He … felt so blessed to do what he did for a living. He was one hell of a journalist and took his job very seriously,\" his widow wrote. \"He was a pillar of the community and people loved to share how much they love and enjoyed watching him on the news.\"\nWhile at Action News Jax, Spain was particularly known for the Kid Care Report that examined local daycare center center violations. The station [called his death](https://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/local/former-action-news-jax-anchor-loses-cancer-fight/KEDFG5SIPNE4TD5L5U2H6AFMIM/) \"heartbreaking.\"\nFirst Coast News General Manager Tim Thomas [said of the loss](https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/local/mark-spain-dies-after-cancer-battle-former-first-coast-news-anchor/77-a901e108-9282-4c08-a0b3-e05873fbfff2), \"We are deeply saddened to hear of Mark's passing. He always worked to better the First Coast in every story he produced.\"\nAn [ABC-13 report](https://wset.com/news/local/mark-spain-beloved-abc13-anchor-and-community-figure-dies-after-battle-with-cancer) said he \"cared about making a difference\" and mentored dozens of young professionals.\n\"His guidance and genuine care for those he worked with made him much more than just a coworker or even a friend — he was a member of the family,\" according to the report.\nSpain started his journalism career early, as 9-year-old paperboy for the Cleveland Press, according to ABC 13. He majored in communications at Cleveland State University and worked multiple jobs in the journalism industry, including in Fort Wayne, Erie, Indianapolis and Cleveland.\nHe received multiple awards. In 2018 and 2019, he was named Best News Anchor by the Association Press of the Virginias. The Virginia Association of Broadcasters gave him first place for Outstanding News Series in 2018 and Best Documentary or Public Affairs Program in 2022. And \"he helped land many other awards for the crew at WSET over the years,\" according to ABC 13.\nbcravey@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4109",

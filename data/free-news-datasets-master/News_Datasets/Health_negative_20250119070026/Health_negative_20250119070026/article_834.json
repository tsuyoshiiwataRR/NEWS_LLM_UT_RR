    "text": "T﻿he TikTok girlies are putting beef fat on their skin as moisturiser in the latest skincare trend, though dermatologists have their reservations.\nTallow, which is rendered fat, is being hailed as the next-best, all-natural moisturiser for any skin condition, including acne.﻿ Others have touted it as nature's botox or retinol.\nMany users are defending the product, saying they have seen incredible results, with some making it themselves at home.\nWatch the video above﻿\nJulia Yak swears by beef tallow as skincare (TikTok/@julia.yak) ﻿ READ MORE: The secret ingredient that makes this the best Bloody Mary you'll ever try\nMorgan Helm, 24, sees a \"huge difference\" in her complexion after using the unconventional product.\n\"Smelling a little beefy might just be the cost of having a glowing face,\" she told the outlet.\nTikTok user Julia Yak, a self-proclaimed holistic health and nutrition coach, says the bovine products is her one-and-only skincare secret.\nFor a daily dose of 9honey, subscribe to our newsletter here .\nCult '90s lipstick resurfaced and then sold out worldwide View Gallery \"Beef tallow is the only thing I put on my face as skincare,\" she told her 52,000 followers in a video, claiming that it doesn't make her smell like beef.\nSascha Green, 28, told The New York Times that she slathers her homemade concoction to soothe dry skin, bug bites, rashes and burns.\n\"I made my own to start, just by getting meat from Costco and stripping the fat off the meat and rendering it,\" she shared.\nTallow products on TikTok are having their moment, with ﻿Mary Heffernan, 46, who makes her own tallow products in her Northern California ranch telling The Times , \"Thanks to TikTok and social media for really promoting tallow as trendy... when we released it on our website, we sold $US 42,000 (approx. $67,000) in tallow overnight. Sold out.\"\nREAD MORE: The best mobile phone plans we've spotted this month\nDr Drey was astonished at the new trend (TikTok/@drdrayzday) But dermatologists find the efficiency of the natural resource debatable.\nDermatologist Dr Dray concedes in a TikTok video, ﻿\"Well it is fatty, it does have fatty acids in it. It's an emollient that can soften and smooth dry and rough skin to a certain extent, reduce trans-epidermal water loss, maybe helping to alleviate dry skin conditions\n\"But do I think it's as magical as its being touted on this app? No﻿,\" she said, likening it to the coconut oil trend from a few years prior.\nREAD MORE: Ingredient hidden in this delicious dish might shock you\nSome are creating their own tallow at home. (Getty) Dermatologist Dr Muneeb Shah previously said that tallow may not technically be \"unsafe\", but it definitely isn't his \"first choice.\"\n\"There's so many great skincare products out there now that are affordable and widely available that it just wouldn't make sense to me to take a chance on an ingredient that we don't know works or not,\" he told The New York Post .\nDermatologists typically recommend products that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid – beef tallow is the opposite, he said, which can irritate the skin.\nREAD MORE: William and Kate release Christmas card after ditching a huge family event\nIt is also likely to cause more acne due to being so thick, defeating the purpose of the newest skincare fad.﻿\n\"I wouldn't actually even prefer it as a moisturiser when you actually break down the ingredients inside of it,\" he shared.\nHe also adds that it is at odds with what consumers usually tend to choose in their beauty products, with most selecting natural, clean, and cruelty-free products for their regime.\n﻿Tallow is \"anti what the skincare industry is looking for,\" Shah pointed out.\nFOLLOW US ON WHATSAPP HERE : Stay across all the latest in celebrity, lifestyle and opinion via our WhatsApp channel.

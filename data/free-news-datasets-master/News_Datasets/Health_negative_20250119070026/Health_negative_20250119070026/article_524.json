It will help you determine the most common ADHD symptoms in women and provide information that can be shared with a doctor.\nThe test requires a person to answer 18 questions that are broken down by the four core symptoms of ADHD: inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and two other symptom areas. Scores are calculated, which reveals the severity of your symptoms based on the answers you provide. The screening tool is free to use and can be completed online.

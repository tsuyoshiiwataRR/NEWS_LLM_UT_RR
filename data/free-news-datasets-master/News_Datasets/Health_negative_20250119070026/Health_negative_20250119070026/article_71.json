    "text": "Macomb, Ill. (KHQA) â€” After a structure fire on West Calhoun Street, the Macomb Fire Department would like to remind residents the importance of smoke detectors and that the fire department provides free smoke detectors to residents.\nAt 8:17 p.m., Wednesday, December 18th, the Macomb Fire Department was dispatched to a structure fire at 809 W. Calhoun St with reports of heavy black smoke coming out of the basement windows.\nThe first arriving units arrived on scene at 8:20 p.m. and observed smoke and flames out of the basement windows. The on-duty crew began extinguishing the fire from the outside before transitioning to an interior attack.\nThe fire was contained to one bedroom in the basement and the fire was declared \"under control\" at 8:50 p.m.\nFire investigators processed the scene and cleared at 11:30 p.m. No firefighters or civilians were injured.\nNo smoke alarms were observed within the residence, and none were sounding at the time of the fire department's arrival. The structure sustained fire, smoke, and water damage throughout and has an estimated loss of $50,000.\nThe fire cause is undetermined and remains under investigation by the Macomb Fire Department.\nThe Macomb Fire Department wants to again remind citizens that smoke detectors are essential safety devices that play a crucial role in protecting lives and property by providing early warning of smoke or fire. The fire department has partnered with the Illinois Fire Safety Alliance and the \"Be Alarmed!\" program to provide smoke detectors free of charge to residents.\nThe Macomb Fire Department would like to thank McDonough County Communications Center, Macomb IL Police, Lifeguard Ambulance Service of Illinois, City of Macomb Public Works, and Ameren IL for their assistance with the fire.",

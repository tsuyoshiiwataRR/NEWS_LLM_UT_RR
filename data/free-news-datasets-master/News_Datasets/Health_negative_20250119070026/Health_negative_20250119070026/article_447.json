    "text": "By Jeff Nowak ,\n27 minutes ago\nThe New Orleans Saints look poised to be down yet another key player when they head to face the Green Bay Packers, and the absence could be extended.\nAlvin Kamara was absent from Thursday's Saints practice, the team's first of the week, with a groin issue that interim head coach Darren Rizzi said was more significant than initially thought.\n\"He’s gonna be week-to-week at the moment,\" Rizzi said. \"I’m gonna be honest, it doesn’t look great for this week. We’ll see what the next day brings.\"\nThe head coach had previously described the injury as a groin/adductor issue and one that Kamara noticed during the game but was likely worsened when he extended to haul in a touchdown pass from Cedrick Wilson in the third quarter. He remained in the game for a play on the next drive before heading into the blue injury tent, then back to the locker room for the remainder of the game.\nThe injury casts the final three games in serious doubt, a fact that's made more frustrating by Kamara sitting just 50 yards shy of the first 1,000-yard rushing season of his career. Rizzi won't be closing the door on his season any time soon.\n“There’s no one that wants him to get that more than me. At the same time we’re certainly gonna do the right thing by him, you know, I know it’s a goal that he wants to accomplish,\" Rizzi said. \"It’s a goal that I want him to accomplish but let’s … hopefully we get him back here towards the end and we can get him that goal.”\nKamara's absence would mean a bigger role for RBs Kendre Miller, Jamaal Williams and Jordan Mims. The Saints also signed former LSU star Clyde Edwards-Helaire to the practice squad, but he faces a quick turnaround to be ready for Monday.\nHere's how the Saints' full injury report broke down on Thursday:\nDNP = did not participate; LP = limited participation; FP = full participation\n- QB Derek Carr (left hand): DNP\n- RB Alvin Kamara (groin): DNP\n- WR Bub Means (ankle): DNP\n- WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling (chest): DNP\n- DE Chase Young (illness): DNP\n- TE Juwan Johnson (foot): LP\n- WR Chris Olave (head): LP\n- CB Kool-Aid McKinstry (shoulder): FP\nAlvin was one of five players who missed practice on the day. Two of those players were dealing with minor issues in Marquez Valdez-Scantling (chest) and Chase Young (illness). Both were held out as precautions and are expected back during the week of practice.\nThe biggest question will come in the form of Derek Carr, who is continuing to rehab but is yet to return to practice. Rizzi won't yet rule Carr out, but he did note on Thursday that it'd be Spencer Rattler starting if Carr is unable to play. Rizzi said that an injury guarantee is not expected to factor into the equation, as it has for several quarterbacks, including Carr, in previous stops.\n\"I certainly am not the salary cap guy or the contract guy, I’m a coach, but at the same time I understand that that plays into it and I understand that that’s happened in Derek’s past,\" Rizzi said. \"The fact that he wants to come back, the fact that he’s not on IR, I think kind of answers those questions, in my opinion answers those questions that that’s not an issue at the moment.\"\nThe biggest return of the day came in the form of Chris Olave, who was a limited participant in practice for the first time since being carted off the field during a loss to the Panthers in Week 9. He was cleared to return to football activity this week and his 21-day practice window has been officially opened. Rizzi wouldn't commit to Olave playing again this season, but said it would likely be left up to the player.\n\"I couldn’t be happier for him and more as a person than a football player. Really, really excited about him,\" Rizzi said. \"He was in a great mood today, all smiles, and for those that were out there probably saw him running around, that’s great.”\nThe Packers had a few DNPs. Here's how their half of the injury report broke down:\n- S Javon Bullard (ankle): DNP\n- LB Quay Walker (ankle): DNP\n- CB Corey Ballentine (knee): LP\n- TE Luke Musgrave (ankle): LP\n- CB Jaire Alexander (knee): FP\nThe Saints (5-9) visit the Packers (10-4) for a Monday Night Football showdown at Lambeau Field in Week 16. Catch all the action on WWL and Audacy.",

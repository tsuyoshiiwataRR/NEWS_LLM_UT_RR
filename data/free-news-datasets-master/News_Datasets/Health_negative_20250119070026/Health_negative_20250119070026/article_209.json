    "text": "By Olivia Wilson Asher Redd ,\n6 hours ago\nUPDATE (3:31 p.m.): An “unknown substance” passed around campus sent two Accel Academy students to the hospital on Wednesday.\nThe two high school students were taken to the hospital at around 1:30 p.m. Wednesday, leaving the Mobile Police Department with the task of figuring out what the substance is and where it came from.\nThe police department described the scare as a “vaping incident.”\n“We have, we as any other school, we are anti-drugs, anti-vape anti and all that,” Accel Academy Marketing and Communications Director Victoria Lambert said. “We are anti cell phone.”\nThe two students, according to Lambert, suffered non-life-threatening injuries and are in stable condition.\n“Our No. 1 priority is to ensure that all of our students and staff are well taken care of and that they’re safe,” Lambert said. “Our due diligence is to our students and to our staff.”\nAbout 825 students are enrolled between the charter school system’s middle and high schools. All students, according to Lambert, are thoroughly searched each day as they come onto campus with a metal detector at the entrance of the school.\n“We do just make sure that each student comes in and they are de-weaponed and have nothing that could cause harm to another student or themselves,” Lambert said. “We are always looking to make sure we’re taking safety precautions for our students.”\nLambert said the police department is leading this investigation. Meanwhile, school staff will continue to be on the lookout for any suspicious activity among its students.\nNo arrests have been made. This remains an active investigation.\nMOBILE, Ala.

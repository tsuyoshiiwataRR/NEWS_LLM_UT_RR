    "text": "Friday night’s Dr. Phil Primetime tackles the thorny issue of childhood obesity, focusing on the increasingly popular—and controversial—use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs in teens. Two mothers, Suzie and Deana, who’ve seen success with these medications themselves, believe their teenage children, Jeremiah (14) and Demi (16), should also have access to this “miracle” solution. Their perspective is expected to generate a heated debate about the long-term health and ethical implications of such an approach, considering the potential side effects and the pressure it may place on young people’s body image.\nCountering the mothers’ enthusiasm is gynecologist Dr. Jaime Seeman, a staunch opponent of using GLP-1 drugs for weight loss in children. Dr. Seeman’s concerns center on the still-developing understanding of these drugs’ long-term effects on young bodies, especially since research is ongoing. Adding further fuel to the fire is body positivity activist Virgie Tovar. Tovar contends that introducing teens to weight-loss drugs could escalate their risk of developing eating disorders, a concern that has dogged the diet industry for decades.\nTune in to Dr. Phil Primetime this Friday, December 20, at 8:00 PM on MeritTV.",

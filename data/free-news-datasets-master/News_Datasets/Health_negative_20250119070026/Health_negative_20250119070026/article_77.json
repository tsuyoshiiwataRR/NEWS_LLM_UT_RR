    "text": "MUNCIE, Ind. – A young Delaware County man was found guilty Thursday of charges in the overdose deaths of two local teenagers.\nA Delaware Circuit Court 1 jury found Jaxon W. Engle, 18, of Albany, guilty of trafficking in a controlled substance causing death; aiding, abetting, or causing the trafficking of a controlled substance resulting in death; and conspiracy to traffic in a narcotic drug.\nThe two most serious charges are Level 1 felonies, which carry a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison. Judge Judi Calhoun set the sentence for January 14.\nIn his closing address to jurors on Thursday afternoon, Chief Deputy Prosecutor Zach Craig argued there was clear evidence that Engle was a player in events that left 18-year-old Javin Nichols dead after ingesting a fentanyl pill in July 2023.\nTwo months later, Craig said, Engle sold one of the “blue M30” fentanyl pills to 17-year-old Kamron Lacy, who later died of an overdose.\nMore: Muncie man sentenced to 41 years in prison for role in fatal overdose\nCraig said Engle and his accomplices “demonstrated a willingness to take advantage of those young men’s poor decisions.”\n“They did it to make money,” Craig said.\nCo-defendant Ricky Taylor, 25, was sentenced to 41 years in prison in July after another jury found him guilty of involvement in supplying the fentanyl that led to one of the deaths.\nDealers sue: The risk of long prison sentences due to fatal overdoses varies from country to country\nEvidence presented by Craig and Deputy Prosecutor Diane Frye at Engle’s trial included dozens of texts exchanged by Engle and Taylor, described as the main supplier of the fentanyl pills.\nEngle was represented by attorney Ron Smith.\nIn June, Engle pleaded guilty in Blackford Circuit Court to conspiracy to traffic meth.\nHe was accused of conspiring with his father to smuggle meth to his brother, who was being held in the Blackford County Jail at the time.\nAfter Thursday’s verdicts were announced, Delaware County Prosecutor Eric Hoffman noted that his office had 14 convictions for trafficking resulting in death to date.\n“Long gone are the days when drug dealers preyed on the weak and vulnerable,” the prosecutor said.\nDouglas Walker is a news reporter at The Star Press.

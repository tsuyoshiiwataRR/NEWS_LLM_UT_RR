    "text": "Dozens of cities in New Jersey, home to more than a million people, have reported foul-smelling water flowing from their taps.\nThe complaints, which came to light Wednesday, prompted an “urgent notification” from New Jersey American Water, which is now investigating the Raritan system and surrounding areas.\nThe company took samples from the water source and several treatment plants and reported that “preliminary sampling results showed that the water meets primary standards.”\nThe Raritan system supplies drinking water to 64 cities in parts of Middlesex, Somerset and Union counties.\nCustomers in those areas received the notification at 9:30 PM ET, and an update is expected Thursday at 9:45 PM.\nResidents have reported a metallic taste and an odor similar to paint thinner.\nThe contaminated tap water has led many on social media to speculate that drones flying over New Jersey may be linked to the changes, as the first sightings occurred over the Raritan River – a vital resource for the Raritan system.\nHowever, some residents have attributed the problems to a water main that broke in Union City at 7 a.m. Tuesday.\nAmerican Water did not specify whether the water main break was the cause of problems with the Raritan system’s water.\nThe Raritan system supplies drinking water to 64 cities in parts of Middlesex, Somerset and Union counties\nThe mystery has left many residents frustrated, with one person sharing on Reddit: ‘I’m surprised they’re not giving any clues… is it safe to drink, touch skin, etc? It’s a bit strange that they leave out the most important information for the customer.’\nAmerican Water said it began flushing fire hydrants last night and continued through Thursday in an effort to help clear the system.\n[This may result in low pressure and/or discoloration. If your water is discolored, run the cold-water taps only, at the lowest level of the house for about 3 to 5 minutes until the water runs clear,’ the company said in a press release.\nResidents in Hillsborough, where a drone alleged crashed last week, and other towns have been told not to drink tap water and use bottled until further notice.\nBut as drones have invaded the skies over New Jersey for more than a month, conspiracy theories are swirling about the water changes.\n‘So there’s been countless unidentified drones flying over our reservoirs completely unfettered, and now the water from an entire reservoir smells and tastes bad,’ a New Jersey resident shared online.\n‘And they are 100% sure there is no connection, even though we don’t know who is flying the drones, why the drones are flying, why they are over reservoirs, and why the water smells and tastes bad.’\nA Facebook Group, New Jersey Mystery Drones – let’s solve it, features a thread about the mysterious water issues.\nDozens of New Jersey towns, home to over one million people, have reported foul-smelling and tasting water pouring from their taps\nThe tainted tap water has led many on social media to speculate that drones flying over New Jersey may be connected to the changes, as initial sightings occurred over the Raritan River—a vital source for the Raritan System\nA Hillsborough resident posted: ‘This could be completely unrelated and I am hoping that’s the case….There are reports of foul smelling and tasting water in and around Hillsborough 08844. People are stating it tastes like nail polish. Any insight is appreciated.’\nThe first comment reads: ‘Drones flying over reservoirs spraying stuff. Go figure. My country is run by idiots.’\nAnother New Jersey local shared the claims, saying: ‘I seen this coming and warned everyone a couple days ago but everyone laughed at me.\n‘Guess that’s what happens when Drones are seen spraying everywhere including water reservoirs.’\nHowever, others commenting on the post sharing the issues with their tap water.\n‘Over the past month I’ve had 2 distinctive occasions when I’ve came in from outside and told my wife I have a metallic taste in my mouth,’ one person shared.\nWhile another said she was happy to have read the alert before bathing her one-year-old.\nAnd many New Jerseyans warned the others to not drink the water.\nOver the past month I’ve had 2 distinctive occasions when I’ve came in from outside and told my wife I have a metallic taste in my mouth.\nWhile a mother said she was glad to read the post before bathing her baby with the smelly water.\nThe first New Jersey drone sightings appeared over the US Army’s Picatinny Arsenal on November 18.\nOfficials then started receiving reports of craft flying of water reservoirs, electric transmission lines, rail stations, police departments and military installations.\nThe White House has stated multiple times that it has ‘not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk.’\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday that people are misidentifying hobbyists, planes, and even stars as drones.\nHe noted that the FBI had received tips on 5,000 drone sightings in recent weeks, of which 100 were deemed worthy of further investigation.",

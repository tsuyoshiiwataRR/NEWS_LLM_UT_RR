    "text": "HARTFORD, Conn. — A [West Haven](https://www.fox61.com/section/new-haven-county/west-haven) woman was sentenced on Thursday in Hartford for diverting narcotics from veterans under her care as a nurse at the West Haven VA Medical Center, according to a [release](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ct/pr/west-haven-woman-who-diverted-narcotics-dying-va-medical-center-patients-sentenced) from the [U.S. Attorney](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ct/meet-us-attorney) for the District of Connecticut.\nTara Severino, 58, was sentenced to two years of probation. She must spend the first six months in home confinement.\nCourt documents and statements make it clear that Severino worked as a registered nurse with the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in West Haven, where she was assigned to the VA’s Intensive Care Unit for sick or dying patients.\nProsecutors say that from January to July 2023, Severino ingested fentanyl, hydromorphone and oxycodone that was meant for patients in her care.\nAccording to prosecutors, sometimes Severino ingested the “waste” of a substance, which means that she administered part of the substance to a patient and ingested the remaining, unused portion.\nIn one case, Severino repeatedly introduced fentanyl into the system of a braindead patient. She later said she observed him in pain and having a seizure. Prosecutors say she gave this patient fentanyl approximately 19 times over a nine-day span so she could divert some for herself.\nOn a different occasion, Severino ingested doses of hydromorphone and fentanyl meant for dying patients, prosecutors say. This affected treatment decisions made by other medical staff, who were under the impression that the patients had been receiving, and were unresponsive to, their prescribed medications.\nIn a separate incident, prosecutors say Severino volunteered to care for a patient that wasn’t formally assigned to her, so that she could divert pain medication from him before he passed away.\nProsecutors report that Severino covered up her crimes by misrepresenting in VA medical records and tracking systems, so it appeared that the drugs were properly administered to the patients and had been properly disposed of.\nOn June 18, Severino pleaded guilty to obtaining controlled substances by fraud or subterfuge.\nThe case was investigated by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Office of the Inspector General, while the Drug Enforcement Administration’s New Haven Tactical Diversion Squad and the West Haven Police Department assisted.\n----\nDalton Zbierski is a digital content producer and writer at FOX61 News.

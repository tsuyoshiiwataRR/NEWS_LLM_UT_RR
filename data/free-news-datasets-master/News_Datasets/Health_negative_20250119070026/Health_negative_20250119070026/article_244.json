    "text": "NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - New Orleans Saints star running back Alvin Kamara may miss the remainder of the season as he deals with a groin injury.\nInterim head coach Darren Rizzi says the injury to Kamara’s adductor, initially thought to be minor, is more significant than he thought. He said it does not look great for Monday night’s game against the Green Bay Packers.\nAccording to a report by ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the injury could sideline Kamara for the rest of the season.\n“Saints RB Alvin Kamara’s groin injury still is being evaluated but it’s possible it is a season-ending injury and he has played his last down this year, per sources,” Schefter tweeted Thursday afternoon.\nSaints RB Alvin Kamara’s groin injury still is being evaluated but it’s possible it is a season-ending injury and he has played his last down this year, per sources. pic.twitter.com/QYuFpl72VS\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 19, 2024 Kamara exited last Sunday’s game against the Washington Commanders late in the contest.\nThe 29-year-old running back, who recently extended his contract with the Saints, has been a cornerstone of the team’s offense. His absence could open the door for younger talent, including rookie RB Kendre Miller, to step up during the final stretch of the season.\nKamara’s potential loss adds to a growing list of injuries impacting the Saints’ lineup as they fight to secure a playoff spot.\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?

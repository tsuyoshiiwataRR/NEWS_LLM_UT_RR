    "text": "Carson Beck injury: Major update emerges on elbow, status for College Football Playoff\nCarson Beck is set to miss the College Football Playoff quarterfinals, as On3’s Pete Nakos first reported. The question for the Georgia quarterback is whether he’ll be able to suit up at all in the postseason after suffering an elbow injury, and it sounds like surgery could be on the table.\nESPN’s Pete Thamel, Mark Schlabach and Chris Low reported Beck is “exploring surgery options” after suffering the injury in the SEC Championship. He went to throw up one final prayer before halftime against Texas, but got hit as he threw. Gunner Stockton took over the rest of the way and is expected to get the start in the CFP quarterfinals.\nCLICK HERE to go to PrizePicks and use code ON3 to receive a guaranteed $50 once you play $5 in lineups!\nNakos reported a timetable for Beck’s return is still unclear as he works through his next steps. Despite coming in to deliver the game-sealing handoff to Trevor Etienne, Beck reportedly had trouble gripping the football.\nThis story will be updated.",

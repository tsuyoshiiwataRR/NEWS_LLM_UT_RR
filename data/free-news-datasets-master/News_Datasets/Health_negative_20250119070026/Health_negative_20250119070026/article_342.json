    "text": "Insurance Company Sues Over 180 Health Care Providers for Fraud Under RICO\nThe case is purportedly one of the largest insurance fraud actions under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act filed in New York.\nDecember 19, 2024 at 06:44 PM\n3 minute read\nAmerican Transit Insurance Co. is seeking to recover $450 million in compensatory damages from over 180 healthcare providers for allegedly submitting fraudulent insurance claims.\nThe case is purportedly one of the largest insurance fraud actions under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act filed in New York.\nBut it drew fire from Steven Harfenist of Harfenist Kraut & Perlstein, who has represented at least 75 defendants in similar cases, said this could be a strategy to obtain settlements with providers and entities that cannot afford to participate in litigation.\nCounsel has not officially appeared for the defendant yet, but Harfenist said he is set to be involved in the case.\nThe plaintiffs filed the case in the Eastern District of New York, and are represented by Manning & Kass and Cadwalder, Wickersham & Taft.\n\"No-fault fraud is a huge problem in New York. American Transit filed a lawsuit as part of its statutory responsibility to fight such fraud,\" William J. Natbony, Counsel at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft said. \"The allegations in the complaint speak for themselves.”\nAmerican Transit Insurance insures taxis, livery cars and ride-share vehicles in New York City. According to the complaint, the defendants, Surgicore, LLC centers, management and doctors, were accused of submitting fraudulent claims by being improperly licensed, billing for medically unnecessary services, illegal kickbacks and charging bills in excess than what defendants can obtain under the Comprehensive Motor Vehicle Insurance Reparations Act, known as New York's no-fault law.\nHarfenist said cases like this have been in circulation since the late 90's, but \"nobody ever paid attention to them.\"\nThese lawsuits surfaced because insurance carriers would deny medical claims, often for lack of medical necessity, which \"developed a receivable, and the manner in which you can collect a receivable is either through litigation or arbitration.\"\n\"In these arbitrations, the insurance companies were not faring well,\" Harfenist said. \"Along came, to some degree, a group of some bad actors. In every industry, there is some fraud. What [the insurance companies] realized in bringing these recovery actions against these fraudulent actors is that they could use this as a claims avoidance tool.\"\nNow, many RICO claims have been filed against entities and individuals in the medical care field, but Harfenist claimed the majority of these cases should not be brought under RICO.\n\"The medical providers couldn't afford to fight, so these billion-dollar insurance companies brought the weight down on these medical providers. These cases would get resolved because the providers couldn't afford to litigate ... They've become a very effective tool in wiping out large swaths of receivables.\"\nIn this case and [many others](https://www.law.com/2024/10/16/a-rico-surge-is-underway-heres-how-the-allstate-push-might-play-out/), the defendants are smaller practices, which have become easy targets for quick resolutions, Harfenist said.\nAmerican Transit Insurance [reported in August](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/nyregion/american-transit-insurance-uber-lyft-nyc.html) in its Q2 statement that it was insolvent with over $700 million in losses. Harfenist argued this action \"looks like a Hail Mary\" for the company.\nThe complaint is filled with \"boilerplate\" arguments, Harfensit said.\n\"Basically, they're saying any doctor that ever performed any type of procedure at any of these surgery centers is involved in a conspiracy,\" he said.\nHarfenist said he hopes there will be regulatory change to deal with how insurance carriers respond to no-fault claims.\n\"I don't think it's gotten any real legislative interest in terms of reform to sort of balance out these cases,\" Harfenist said, \"because none of them really result in verdicts.\"\nRead the complaint:\nNOT FOR REPRINT\n© 2024 ALM Global, LLC, All Rights Reserved.

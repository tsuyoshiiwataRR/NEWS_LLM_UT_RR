    "text": "LYNCHBURG, Va. – Mark Spain, ABC 13 News anchor for nearly a decade, sadly passed away on Wednesday following his battle with pancreatic cancer, WSET announced on Thursday.\nMark Spain was not just a treasured member of the Lynchburg community, but of the Jacksonville community as well, where he worked as an anchor at [First Coast News](https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/local/mark-spain-dies-after-cancer-battle-former-first-coast-news-anchor/77-a901e108-9282-4c08-a0b3-e05873fbfff2) for 14 years.\nRecommended Videos\nMark’s wife also issued a statement on his [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1BKUV9uU8h/) following his passing:\nHello sunshines! It is with a heavy heart that I share the passing of my loving husband Mark. Our family along with the city of Lynchburg lost a man of hope, someone who loves his city and stood for equality, treating others with respect and kindness. He was a husband, father, brother, friend and a positive light in the community. My first true love. He brought so much joy, compassion, love and strength into our lives, and his absence will be deeply felt by all who knew him. The last 23 years have been a wonderful journey filled with love, laughter and many wonderful memories. A journey that I would do all over again.\nIt’s surreal that it was exactly three weeks ago yesterday that he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Our family was there with him from the beginning of the fight to the finish, until his very last breath! He fought hard, he stayed positive throughout the battle and wasn’t afraid. We have comfort in knowing he is no longer suffering, it was not easy watching him fight for his life and battle this disease, but he was not alone., and neither were we.\nHe encouraged those around him. He loved to help others and longed for peace and was an ambassador for positivity. He loved his family and was extremely proud of his children. He also loved his job and felt so blessed to do what he did for a living. He was one hell of a journalist and took his job very seriously. He was a pillar of the community and people loved to share how much they love and enjoyed watching him on the news.\nAs we navigate this difficult time, we take comfort in remembering the wonderful moments we shared with him. Your kindness and support mean the world to us. Friends, you showed up and showed out with love support during his fight!! You have all been amazing and a true village! I can’t thank you all enough for all of the prayers, cards, flowers, blankets, texts, comments and checking in on us.\nThis new journey, one I never thought I’d be on, as a single parent will be a new and challenging one. God is walking along side us, guiding and protecting us. Please keep our family in your thoughts and prayers.\nWith love,\nThe Spain Family\nEveryone at WSLS offers their love and support for Mark’s family, and towards those at the WSET as well.

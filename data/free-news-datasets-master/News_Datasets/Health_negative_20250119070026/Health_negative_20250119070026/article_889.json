    "text": "Representational Image | Mathrubhumi\nChennai: The southern bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered the Kerala government to retrieve biomedical waste recently dumped in Tamil Nadu's Tirunelveli district. The waste, originating from Kerala, must be removed within three days and sent to authorised treatment facilities in Kerala or Tamil Nadu. If no suitable facility is found in Tamil Nadu, the waste must be returned to Kerala.\nThe tribunal, comprising Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana and expert member Sathyagopal Korlapti, directed the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) to file a compliance report by December 23, the next hearing date. The order follows a suo motu case concerning biomedical waste discarded in forest areas near Tirunelveli, threatening wildlife.\nOrigin traced to Regional Cancer Centre\nThe waste was linked to Kerala's Regional Cancer Centre (RCC) in Thiruvananthapuram and other establishments. Tamil Nadu government pleader D. Shanmuganathan highlighted the KSPCB's non-compliance with an earlier order to reimburse Rs 69,000 spent on clearing similar waste in Nanguneri.\nFresh dumping under scrutiny\nCounsel for the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), Sai Sathya Jith, informed the tribunal that fresh waste in Tirunelveli villages had not been removed. TNPCB officials inspected the site on December 17, with the chairperson demanding legal action against violators on December 18. Two FIRs have been filed in connection with the incident.\nKerala's response and tribunal's concern\nKSPCB counsel V.K. Remasmrithi acknowledged that unauthorised waste collectors were responsible for the dumping. Show-cause notices have been issued to the RCC and other establishments. However, Shanmuganathan expressed frustration over repeated dumping from Anaimalai to Tirunelveli, urging a strong warning to deter future violations.\nNGT questions Kerala's waste management\nThe tribunal questioned Kerala's lack of sufficient biomedical waste treatment facilities, noting that the state has only one facility, which is inadequate. The bench directed the KSPCB to submit a detailed report on Kerala's biomedical waste generation and treatment capacity.\nRecurring issue prompts cost orders\nIn a related case, the NGT ordered Kerala to reimburse Tamil Nadu for waste-clearing costs. The tribunal emphasised the need for Kerala to ensure its hospitals operate only with adequate waste management systems.",

    "text": "National-According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cancer is a term used for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control and can take over other tissues. Cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems. Cancer is not just one disease, but many diseases.\nA person can lower their risk of getting many common kinds of cancer by making healthy choices, keeping a healthy weight, avoiding tobacco, limiting alcohol intake, and protecting their skin. Screening tests can find some cancers early when treatment works best. Vaccines (shots) can help prevent or reduce your cancer risk (example: HPV, hepatitis).\nHow Does Cancer Affect African American Populations?\nBlack/African Americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group for all cancers combined and for most major cancers. Death rates for all major causes of death are higher for Black/African Americans than for non-Hispanic whites, contributing in part to a lower life expectancy for both Black/African American men and women.\nFrom 2015-2019, African American men were 1.2 times and 1.7 times, respectively, more likely to have new cases of colon and prostate cancer, as compared to non-Hispanic white men.\nBlack/African American men are 1.8 times as likely to have stomach cancer, as compared to non-Hispanic white men and 2.5 times more likely to die from stomach cancer.\nBlack/African American men have lower 5-year cancer survival rates for most cancer sites, as compared to non-Hispanic white men.\nBlack/African American men are twice as likely to die from prostate cancer, as compared to non-Hispanic white men.\nFrom 2015-2019, Black/African American women were just as likely to have been diagnosed with breast cancer; however, they were almost 40 percent more likely to die from breast cancer, as compared to non-Hispanic white women.\nBlack/African American women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with stomach cancer, and they are 2.3 times more likely to die from stomach cancer, as compared to non-Hispanic white women.",

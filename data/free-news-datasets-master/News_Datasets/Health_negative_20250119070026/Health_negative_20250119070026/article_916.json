    "text": "Zealand Pharma Falls Short of FDA Approval for Glepaglutide\nBy Stephen Nakrosis\nZealand Pharma said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that the company's new drug application for proposed short bowel syndrome treatment glepaglutide didn't meet full requirements, adding it will continue dialogue with the agency.\nThe FDA, in a complete response letter pertaining to the NDA, said the application didn't meet full requirements for substantial evidence to establish the efficacy and safety of the treatment's to-be-marketed dose, said Zealand.\nDavid Kendall, the Denmark-based biotech company's chief medical officer, said Zealand was disappointed in the FDA's decision and remains confident the data showed robust and compelling evidence of glepaglutide's efficacy and safety.\nZealand said it would continue working with the FDA on a path toward obtaining regulatory approval in the U.S.\nZealand also said it expects to proceed with plans for a European Marketing Authorization Application submission next year.\nWrite to Stephen Nakrosis at stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nDecember 19, 2024 16:10 ET (21:10 GMT)\nCopyright (c) 2024 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

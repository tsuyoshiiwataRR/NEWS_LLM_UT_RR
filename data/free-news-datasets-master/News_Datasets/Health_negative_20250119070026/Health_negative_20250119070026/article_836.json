The reality show focuses on couples who meet online, later showing their first time meeting in person.\nDuring his season, Murphey was dating a woman named Lana who he had met on a Ukrainian dating website. The pair was engaged, but broke it off in 2022. Murphey later spoke about their relationship on an episode of 90 Day Diaries.\n“She thought that, ‘Well, now that we’re engaged, now you can help me do the things that you promised,’ like, get her some English lessons, actually move her into an apartment,”\nhe explained.\n“But part of my conditions for doing that was to get her off the [dating] website and she didn’t get off the websites, so I didn’t offer any of those bonuses, so four months into our engagement, we just stopped communicating,” Murphey continued.\nDespite the split, Murphey’s family said in their statement that appearing on the show “allowed him to connect with viewers, see the world, and share his experiences with his thousands of followers on Instagram.”\nThey also shared that he “had a fierce love for cats.” Murphey, they said, “always made an effort to adopt cats and give them a good loving home.”\nThe family encouraged fans to donate to\nThe Animal Foundation as a way to honor Murphey.\nMurphey is survived by his two sisters and his cat, Gamera.",

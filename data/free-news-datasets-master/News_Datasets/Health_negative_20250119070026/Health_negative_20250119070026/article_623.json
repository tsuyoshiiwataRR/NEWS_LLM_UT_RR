    "text": "The BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) has issued a warning after dozens of people fell ill from eating raw oysters around the province.\nAccording to the health officials, 64 cases of norovirus-like gastrointestinal illness were reported in the Vancouver Coastal Health, Fraser Health, and Island Health regions between November 1st and December 18th.\nThose affected reported diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain after eating raw oysters from restaurants or retailers. Some visited emergency departments, but no hospitalizations have been reported.\nNorovirus symptoms include vomiting, stomach pain, nausea, fever, and diarrhea, often starting 12–48 hours after infection and lasting 1–3 days.\nThe BCCDC notes recent cases involve raw oysters from restaurants or retailers. While symptoms like intense vomiting can occur, the main risks are fluid loss and dehydration.\nThere has been an increase in gastrointestinal illnesses after eating raw oysters from BC. We are reminding everyone about the risks of consuming raw or undercooked oysters. Cooking destroys viruses and bacteria and decreases the risk of illness: https://t.co/FIfvRQYGgX pic.twitter.com/TBv3p8kbcZ\n— BC Centre for Disease Control (@CDCofBC) December 19, 2024\nFood that is contaminated with norovirus may appear, taste and smell normal. To prevent it, the BCCDC recommends cooking oysters thoroughly to an internal temperature of 90°C and then waiting 90 seconds before eating them.\n“As part of this investigation, federal agencies have closed some areas to commercial shellfish harvesting, including areas in Baynes Sound, west of Denman Island,” said BCDC in their media release.\n“The BCCDC and regional health authorities are investigating illness reports in conjunction with federal partners.”\nOysters can pick up norovirus in the area where they are grown and harvested.\nA shellfish map highlighting closed areas in BC is available online.",

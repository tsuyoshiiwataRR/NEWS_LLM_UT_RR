    "text": "LAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - Bird flu has been detected in a backyard flock in Southwest Louisiana after a person exposed to the flock tested positive for the illness.\nThe SWLA resident was the first person in the state diagnosed with H5N1 and became the first person in the U.S. with a severe case of the disease in the current outbreak. They are hospitalized in Louisiana in critical condition, health officials said Wednesday.\nThe patient had been exposed to sick and dead birds in a non-poultry flock, health officials said. The Louisiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory tested the flock after a report of increased mortality.\nThis is the second backyard flock in the state to test positive for avian influenza. The illness was first detected in Bossier Parish , and that flock was depopulated to prevent the continued spread of the disease.\nThe SWLA patient has the first human case of bird flu connected to a backyard flock, CDC officials said. The majority of people infected during this outbreak have been farmworkers in California.\nThe CDC classifies the virus as having a low immediate risk to public health, but people who are exposed to birds or cows are at higher risk for the disease.\nThe Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry provided the guidance below to avoid catching the illness.\nHow to avoid exposure to bird flu The best way to protect yourself and your family from H5N1 is to avoid sources of exposure. That means avoiding direct contact with wild birds and other animals infected with or suspected to be infected with bird flu viruses.\nAnyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. Visit APHIS’ Defend the Flock Resource Center for materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit.\nAt a minimum, poultry flock owners should follow the biosecurity steps on their farms to prevent the spread of the disease. Those steps include:\nLimit, monitor, and record any movement of people, vehicles or animals on or off your farm. Permit only essential workers and vehicles to enter the farm to limit the chances of bringing the virus from an outside source. Avoid visiting other poultry farms and any unnecessary travel off the farm. Disinfect equipment, vehicles, footwear, and other items that come into contact with flocks. Keep your flock away from wild or migratory birds, especially waterfowl. Isolate any ill animals and contact your veterinarian. In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds. Louisiana bird owners should report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state and federal officials, through USDA’s toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. In Louisiana, poultry owners can report to the USDA number or directly to the LDAF Diagnostic Lab at 1-318-927-3441. Anyone wanting to report concerns regarding wild bird mortality should call the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries at 225-765-2800.\nAdditional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov .\nCopyright 2024 KPLC.

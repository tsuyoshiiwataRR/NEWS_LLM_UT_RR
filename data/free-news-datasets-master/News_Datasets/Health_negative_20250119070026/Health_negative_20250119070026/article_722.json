    "text": "Max George revealed he was preparing for surgery when he shared a photo from his hospital bed on Thursday.\nThe Wanted star, 36, has been in hospital for a week with a 2:1 atrioventricular block and recently revealed he will now undergo emergency surgery sooner than expected because his heart rate ‘hasn’t increased’.\nMax told fans about his surgery on Thursday when he revealed he was being prepared for surgery by medics.\nWhile sharing a cut of his arm in his hospital bed, Max could be seen being given medication before surgery.\nMax got a boost ahead of his operation when he was visited by his girlfriend Maisie Smith in hospital.\nTaking to her Instagram Stories, the former EastEnders actress shared a photo holding his hand in hospital and wrote: ‘Got to see my amazing husband today. [heart emoji]. Proud of you @maxgeorge.’\nMax George revealed he was preparing for surgery when he shared a photo from his hospital bed on Thursday\nMax told fans about his surgery on Thursday when he revealed he was being prepared for surgery by medics\nMax got a boost ahead of his surgery when he was visited by his girlfriend Maisie Smith in hospital (pictured in 2023)\nMax reposted the image and added: ‘Thanks honey. I love you so much.’\nMax and Maisie were first linked in the summer of 2022 when they were spotted kissing on a flight to Crete, after reportedly bonding on the Strictly live tour, after meeting for the first time in 2020 starred in the show.\nMaisie moved in with Max at the beginning of last year and since then the two have been busy renovating their dream home.\nShe has supported the star through his health crisis, with Max revealing on Monday that, after a full chest scan, he might be able to have surgery ‘much sooner’ and be home for the holidays.\nSharing an update on Instagram, Max was seen in a hospital gown in the back of an ambulance.\nHe wrote: ‘Had a little day out today. Full cat scan of my heart. Not something I would choose again!\n‘As I said yesterday, I have a 2:1 block in my heart. Unfortunately, my heart rate hasn’t improved at all for almost a week.’\nMax added: ‘This doesn’t give us as much time to wait, so it looks like I’ll be operated on much sooner than the doctors initially thought. I might even be home for Christmas!\nThe Wanted star, 36, has been in hospital for a week and is suffering from a 2:1 atrioventricular block\nHe recently revealed he will now undergo emergency surgery sooner than expected because his heart rate ‘hasn’t increased’\nMax revealed on Monday that he will undergo emergency surgery earlier than expected because his heart rate ‘hasn’t increased’\n‘It’s still quite a scary time at the moment and the last few nights have been very tough, but I wanted to say that I am absolutely humbled by all your messages of support.\n‘Both people I know and people I don’t know. It has given me a much-needed boost and my family has been overwhelmed with support, which means more to me than anything.”\nAtrioventricular block is a condition that occurs when electrical impulses are delayed or blocked from reaching the ventricles.\nThe cause is a ‘mystery’ and Max, who has battled alcoholism in the past, previously said: ‘We canceled a few things, like alcohol for example. six months, so that’s not it’.\nHe told his followers: ‘Hope you’re having a good night, I spoke to the nurse earlier and the good news is I’m getting a scan sooner than I thought.’\n“So that’s really good, and it’s called a 2:1 block, that’s what we know at this point. We’re going to try to determine the cause before we determine how we treat it, whether it’s a pacemaker, defibrillator or something else.”\nLooking on the bright side, he joked: ‘So there I am, feeling good tonight, the City game didn’t help much’ – after his beloved Manchester City lost to United.\nA pacemaker is a small battery-powered device that prevents the heart from beating too slowly. It requires surgery to install it and is usually performed under local anesthesia.\nFollowing his health problems last week, Max shared on Instagram: ‘Hey everyone, Yesterday I felt very unwell and was taken to hospital. Unfortunately, after some tests they discovered that I have problems with my heart.’\n‘I have many more tests to determine the extent of the problems and what surgery I will need to get back on my feet.\nIn a health update, he explained that after a full chest scan he might be able to have surgery “much sooner” and be home for the holidays.\nHe wrote: ‘Had a little day out today. Full cat scan of my heart. Not something I would want to do again!…Unfortunately my heart rate hasn’t increased at all for almost a week’\n‘It’s going to be a tough few weeks/months… and Christmas in a hospital bed wasn’t exactly what I had planned!\n‘But as always I am surrounded with love and support by my amazing partner Maisie, her family, my family and friends… and I am 100% in the best place.\n‘While this is a huge shock and undoubtedly a setback, it is something I will face with everything I have! I consider myself very lucky that this was caught when it did.\nHe added: “Apologies if I bore you with updates in the coming weeks. I’ve probably been in bed for a month and there’s not THAT much to do! Let’s do this! Lots of love, Max x’\nShortly after his announcement, Max posted a light-hearted joke from his hospital bed about Manchester City’s loss in Wednesday night’s football match.\nAs he lay in bed with a heart monitor on his chest, he joked: “So I think they’re officially trying to kill me… come on guys.”\nMax has been open about his battle with binge drinking and alcoholism over the years, previously admitting to drinking ‘ten pints and three bottles of wine in one night’.",

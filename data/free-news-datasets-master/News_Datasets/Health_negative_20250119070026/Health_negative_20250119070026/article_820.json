    "text": "By SHAUN WOOLLER, DAILY MAIL HEALTH EDITOR\nPublished: 00:13 GMT, December 20, 2024 | Updated: 00:38 GMT, December 20, 2024\nIt is claimed that hospices are being given back the money taken from them by the Labor Party’s national insurance raid and that it has been repackaged as extraordinary new funding.\nThe Government said yesterday that adult and children’s hospices will receive £100 million to help provide end-of-life care in what it described as the “largest investment in a generation”.\nBut the Conservatives accused ministers of taking millions of pounds from hospices and palliative care charities in the autumn budget, before telling them to be “grateful” to get some money back.\nShadow health minister Dr Caroline Johnson criticized Labor for having “the audacity” to make such a claim, adding: “This is socialism at its finest.”\nFormer Conservative health minister Neil O’Brien, who described chancellor Rachel Reeves as the “Grinch who stole Christmas” when he increased employers’ national insurance contributions in his October statement, yesterday called for charities and voluntary groups are exempt from the increase.\nHospice organizations have previously said they would face a greater financial burden without such an exemption.\nWhile Hospice UK said the latest funding would be “very welcome”, the Marie Curie charity warned that a one-off investment will not be enough to make the necessary improvements.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons before Parliament breaks up for Christmas, Health Minister Karin Smyth was repeatedly asked whether the £100m funding would cover the costs of the NICs rise, but refused to respond directly.\nThe Keir Starmer-led government (pictured) said yesterday that adult and children’s hospices will receive £100 million to help provide end-of-life care in what it described as the “largest investment in a generation”.\nIt is claimed hospices are being given back money taken from them by Labour’s national insurance raid and it has been repackaged as new windfall funding (File image)\nConservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin said a hospice serving his constituency of Harwich and North Essex estimates the changes to national insurance will cost them £300,000 over a full year, and asked: “Can the Minister now give a guarantee of who will be compensated by the Government in full?’\nMs Smyth responded: “We will announce sector-wide and NHS allocations as usual in the new year.”\nConservative MP Martin Vickers said any increase in funding for hospices was welcome, but added: “This (funding announcement), let’s be honest, is giving with one hand and taking with the other.”\nThe Department of Health and Social Care also confirmed a separate grant of £26 million for next year under the Children’s Hospice Grant.\nIn a written statement, Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said it is “right” that hospices receive financial support to deliver their services, while care minister Stephen Kinnock said the funding will “enable hospices improve their physical and operational environment. allowing them to provide the best possible care to their patients.\nToby Porter, chief executive of Hospice UK, said: “Today’s announcement will be very welcomed by hospices and those who rely on their services.\n‘Hospices not only provide vital care to patients and their families, they also relieve pressure on the NHS.\nConservatives accused ministers of taking millions of pounds from hospices and palliative care charities in the autumn budget (File image)\n“This funding will allow hospices to continue reaching hundreds of thousands of people each year with high-quality, compassionate care.”\nRalph Coulbeck, chief executive of Haven House children’s hospice, said it is “a relief” to know the children’s grant will continue next year, adding that it will “help support the vital care we provide to seriously ill children and families.” .\nMatthew Reed, chief executive of Marie Curie, described the palliative and end-of-life care system as “in crisis” and access to appropriate care often depends on where each person lives.\nShe said: ‘Marie Curie welcomes additional investment in the palliative care sector and awaits further clarification on how these funds will be used to ensure better care for all dying people who need it.\n‘However, a restricted, one-off investment will not meet the recurring cost pressures and current needs of the sector – including the long-term implications of additional national insurance contributions, ongoing pressures as a result of rising wage costs , and a greater number of people who will die in the next 20 years.’\nShare or comment on this article: The Labor Party is accused of taking NI out of hospices and then giving it back under a £100m funding scheme.",

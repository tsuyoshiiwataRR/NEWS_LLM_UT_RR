Healthcare Workers Demand Better Pay and Benefits\nLast week, members of CWA Local 1084 wore red in solidarity at a Camden, N.J., County Board of Social Services meeting after flatly rejecting a 2.25% pay raise offered by the county. The Local released a public response to the lowball offer, saying, “We abruptly concluded the meeting because we were disgusted. This offer is unacceptable, and we cannot afford to let it stand!” The members, with support from CWA Local 1014, packed the meeting with 50 people with another 300 joining via Zoom. Sam Ferraino, president of the Southern New Jersey Central Labor Council, joined the group and spoke in support of the workers.\nCWA Local 1084 members administer public assistance programs such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and Medicaid benefits. Workers are demanding higher wages and lower healthcare costs in response to inflation and higher insurance premiums. Also of great concern to members is pay equity. Suppressed salaries are a major contributing factor to low morale and high attrition, making it difficult to maintain adequate staffing levels.\nCWA Local 1084 President Stephen Johnson told NJ.com, “Newer employees are paid so little that they can’t afford to live independently. Most of them have second and third jobs. We have more and more workers who are paid so little that they qualify for the same programs that we distribute to our clients.”\nThe workers have been without a contract since January.\nThe CWA Local 1084 Bargaining Team has indicated they will continue to fight for the pay and benefits members deserve. “We will not be intimidated nor fooled by management’s tactics. This low offer is a test—they want to see if we'll cave. Let's show them what we're made of! Let's show them the power of a united Union.”\nCWA Local 1084 President Stephen Johnson and Local 1014 President Garren Steiner (standing) raised fists in solidarity as they, and members, provided testimony before the Camden County Board of Social Services.",

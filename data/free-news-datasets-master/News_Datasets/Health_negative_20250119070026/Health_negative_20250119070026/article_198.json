    "text": "First severe bird flu case in the US reported\nDoctors across the country are growing concerned about the spread of bird flu.\n\"The concern comes today because we've checked one of those boxes, the severity of illness, and that's something that we had not seen in the prior cases this year,\" said Dr. Jeremy Faust, a Harvard emergency medicine professor.\nA patient in Louisiana is hospitalized in critical condition with the nation's first known severe illness from bird flu.\nHealth officials report the patient is older than 65, has underlying medical problems, and was exposed to a backyard flock of sick birds.\nSo far, more than 60 people in eight states have experienced mild illness related to the virus.\nAnd while it's named \"bird flu,\" it's really affecting dairy cows, infecting at least 866 herds in 16 states since March.\nMore than half of those cases are in California, where the governor declared an emergency.\n\"We have lots of ways we're monitoring it. We're hopeful that the emergency declaration will make some of those ways more streamlined,\" said Dr. Cameron Kaiser, deputy public health officer for Solano County, California.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says people in contact with dairy cows, commercial poultry, or backyard birds are at higher risk.\nThere has been no person-to-person transmission identified.\nThe virus can also spread in raw milk.\n\"I think, given this situation, it makes sense to have a heightened scrutiny on those products and to be careful,\" said Dr. Jeremy Faust.\nThe Food and Drug Administration says pasteurized milk is safe because the heat treatment kills the virus.\nJust this week, the United States Department of Agriculture started testing raw milk in 13 states to help detect and contain bird flu.",

    "text": "Officials in California have declared a state of emergency over the spread of bird flu, which is ravaging dairy cows in the state and causing sporadic illness in people in the US.\nHere’s what you need to know.\nHow did bird flu spread in the US? The virus, also known as Type A H5N, has been spreading among wild birds, commercial poultry and many mammal species for years. The disease was first found in American dairy cattle in March. Since then, bird flu has been confirmed in at least 866 flocks in 16 states.\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than sixty people in eight states have been infected, with mostly mild illnesses. Almost all of these were farm workers who were directly exposed to infected dairy cattle or poultry.\nOne person in Louisiana has been hospitalized with the nation’s first known serious illness caused by the virus, health officials said this week. That patient was infected through a herd in the backyard.\nIn addition to direct contact with farm animals and wild birds, the H5N1 virus can be spread through raw milk. Pasteurized milk is safe to drink because the heat treatment kills the virus, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nThere have been no reports of person-to-person transmission.\nHow did it spread in California? California is the largest milk-producing state in the U.S., and three-quarters of the nation’s infected herds, about 650, are in the state.\nThe state has been looking for bird flu in large milk tanks during processing, and the virus was discovered earlier this month at four Southern California dairy farms after being found in the state’s Central Valley since August.\nThe detection at Southern California farms made clear that the state needed “a shift from regional containment to statewide monitoring and response,” California Governor Gavin Newsom said in his emergency declaration.\nWhat does the emergency declaration do? The declaration allows the state to better position state personnel and supplies to respond to the outbreak, Newsom said.\n“This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to quickly respond to this outbreak,” Newsom said in a statement.",

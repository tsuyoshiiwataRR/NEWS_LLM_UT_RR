    "text": "EPA is recommending that Congress fund a permanent federal water assistance program, after new research from the agency found that millions of households lack affordable water access.\nRequested by Congress in 2021 legislation, the report released earlier this week found that between 12.1 million and 19.2 million households lack access to affordable water services, such as clean drinking water and wastewater. The figure represents between 9.2 percent and 14.6 percent of total U.S. households.\nThe report comes at the close of a presidential administration that has invested significantly in clean water regulation, specifically in low-income communities and communities of color.\n“Accessing clean and safe water is part of everyday life, and it should be affordable for everyone across the country,” said Bruno Pigott, EPA’s principal deputy assistant administrator for water, in a statement. “The Biden Administration and Congress recognized communities need assistance, and that’s why the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $50 billion for water and wastewater projects, almost half of which is to be provided in grants.”",

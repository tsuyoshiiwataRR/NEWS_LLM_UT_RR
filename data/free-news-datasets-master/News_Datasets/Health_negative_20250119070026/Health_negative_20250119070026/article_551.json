    "text": "Centre, AAP to blame if Dallewal health worsens, says Majithia\nIf anything happens to Jagjit Singh Dallewal, whose hunger strike entered 24th day today, the BJP government at the Centre and AAP government in Punjab will be held responsible as he is already a cancer patient. Unfortunately, the issue is not being taken seriously by the respective governments. These views were expressed by SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia, who had come to Ludhiana for campaigning for the SAD candidates. Majithia was here to support party candidate from ward No. 60 Bhupinder Singh Bhinda in the MC poll.\nMajithia said that the economic condition of the state was already on a ventilator and now similar was the case of law and order in the state. “Even during the miserable state of affairs, Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann is saying all is well,” he said while adding that December 21, the election day, it would be “danda-tantar” (he was referring to the atrocities of police on other party candidates/supporters) instead of “loktantar”.\n“Now is the time to show AAP its real place. The state of Punjab is for Punjab, Punjabi and Punjabiyat and no one should be given the power to run the state from Delhi,” he added.",

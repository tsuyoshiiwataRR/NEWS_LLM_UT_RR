    "text": "SUNNYSIDE, WA. - The primary owner of the now-defunct fruit juice manufacturer Valley Processing Inc. (VPI) in Sunnyside, pleaded guilty this week to two misdemeanor charges related to the manufacture and sale of tainted fruit juice products.\n83-year-old Mary Ann Bliesner and VPI admitted that they failed to register a food facility, known as the “Grape Road Facility,” with the FDA. Bliesner and VPI used the Grape Road Facility to store earlier seasons’ unsold grape juice concentrate, sometimes for years, in large concrete vats that were not properly covered or cooled.\nFDA investigators later learned about the vats and observed grape juice concentrate that testing later confirmed was contaminated with bird and rodent feces, fur, insects, decaying remains of animals, mold, yeast, and other contaminants. FDA inspectors also observed and photographed a live rat walking across the hardened crust that had formed on top of the grape juice concentrate.\n“Bliesner and her company, Valley Processing, produced juice in filthy and unsafe conditions, mislabeled that product, and then sold it to the National School Lunch Program that serves low-income school children,” said U.S. Attorney Vanessa R. Waldref for the Eastern District of Washington. “School children deserve safe and nutritious food. Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our children. I commend the excellent work by investigators with the Food and Drug Administration and prosecutors in my office who uncovered and stopped this conduct and are protecting our public health.”\nBliesner and VPI will face a sentencing hearing on March 26, 2025. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.\nThey also agreed to pay a criminal forfeiture amount of $742,139 as proceeds of their criminal conduct.\nThe full details obtained in the federal investigation of VPI can be read [here](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edwa/pr/fruit-juice-manufacturing-company-and-its-former-president-plead-guilty-food-safety).",

    "text": "AFGHANISTAN: Two bus accidents involving a fuel tanker and a truck on a highway through central Afghanistan killed at least 52 people and injured 68, a provincial official said on Thursday. The accidents happened in Ghazni province on the same highway between the capital Kabul and southern Kandahar city late on Wednesday, provincial head of information and culture Hamidullah Nisar said on X, without specifying how many people were killed and injured in each accident.\n“There is a possibility the numbers could rise,” Nisar told reporters outside a hospital in Ghazni city where victims had been sent.\nHe noted that some of the injured were in a “critical condition” and had been sent to Kabul for treatment. “Among the injured and dead were children, women and elderly people,” he added.\nOne bus collided with a fuel tanker near Shahbaz village in central Ghazni while the other hit a truck in the eastern district of Andar, Nisar said.\nChief government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid posted on X that the authorities had “great regret” over the accidents and that an investigation would be launched.\nTeams worked to clear debris at the sites into the morning, with hunks of metal and broken glass strewn across the area in Andar along with the clothes and meals of bus passengers, an AFP journalist saw. One of the injured in the accident in Shahbaz, Khadim, said he was jolted awake by the noise of the accident but then lost consciousness.\nWhen he came to and pulled himself from the wreck he “saw there were a lot of people under the vehicle and on the ground around us, there was crying and blood everywhere”.\nLocals shout out their grievances as Macron visits Mayotte President Emmanuel Macron comforts a woman as he talks to residents in cyclone devastated Mamoudzou.—...\nLabour Minister Tulip Siddiq named in UK Bangladesh corruption probe Senior Labour minister UK Tulip Siddiq. — Facebook@dewan.sumon.77/FileDHAKA: A senior Labour minister in the UK has...\nSpain seeks curbs on sugary drinks in schools The representational image shows school students enjoying their lunch time at canteen. — Pexels/FileMADRID: Spain´s...\nGerman MPs vote to safeguard top court from ‘extremists’ German Chancellor Olaf Scholz appears as a witness in his role as former finance minister at the German parliament's...\nPelicot’s ex-husband jailed 20 years in France mass rape trial Gisele Pelicot leaves the court after attending the trial for Dominique Pelicot and 50 co-accused, at the courthouse...\nIndian soldiers battle rebels in held Kashmir, five killed Indian Central Reserve Police Force personnel stand guard on a street in Srinagar, October 12, 2021. — ReutersHELD...\nBilly Bob Thornton On Turning Down Villain Role In ‘Spider-Man’, ‘Mission: Impossible III’ Chris Martin Reflects On Life Without Kids Jesse Eisenberg On How Lex Luthor Role In ‘Batman V.

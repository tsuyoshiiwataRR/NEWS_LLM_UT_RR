    "text": "What a terrible way to begin a serious discussion of the horrendous level of health care in the United States. Apparently a young man deeply disgruntled with a health care issue allegedly killed a top health insurance executive. We have arguably the worst health delivery system in the industrialized world, but bullets are the answer to nothing.\nThere is little wonder that our level of longevity is sliding backward as other countries’ level inches forward into longer lives. Russia’s average age of death is also declining, but the reason there is thought to be the high level of vodka consumption.\nIn America our overall spiking of obesity is obviously a contributing factor. However, we never seem to look at how much the private health insurance industry should be sharing its own guilt. Some other countries that have national programs include private insurance companies, but always heavily regulated and in a minor role to the national program itself.\nToday the U.S. federal program is mainly confined to those over 65 years of age (Medicare) and families under certain income levels (Medicaid). Obamacare is an odd combination of federal subsidy and private medical delivery for those people who are not within a large company that provides health insurance policies.\nFor those over 65 years of age there are two types of insurance coverage: 1. traditional Medicare that is paid mainly from lifelong FICA subtractions from paychecks; and 2. Medicare Advantage, delivered by such companies as United Health Care, formerlyrun by the assassinated man in New York City this month. This name of Medicare Advantage is an unfortunate choice because it is not Medicare and with its constant denials of both requested medical treatments and the claims after treatments. Its advantage is on paper in its breadth of coverage and lower premiums. Its only connection to Medicare is that the money given to the insurance companies comes from the same pot as traditional Medicare uses.\nIt should be noted that a medical insurance company makes its money by DENYING claims. The more denials the more profits. Insurance companies hire thousands of doctors, nurses, and non-medical people to pore over claims and the requests for pre-authorized treatments. This heavy overload of deniers plus the mammoth advertising load each fall plus the eye-popping salaries of its executives are the main reasons why private insurance companies have up to five times more overhead than the huge traditional nonprofit Medicare program.\nWhat? The government-run program costs less to run than that by the private corporations? Yes, by a long shot.\nBut what about the socialistic nature of Medicare? Shouldn’t we resist another advancement toward socialism? For one thing it is not socialized medicine. The medical system stays as is because Medicare is merely an insurance program. You keep your own doctors and hospitals. In fact, you can you use any one you want, unlike the Medicare Advantage programs which direct you to their more narrow network of providers.\nIf you want to see socialized medicine, look at Britain’s. The doctors and hospitals all work for the national government and the drug prices are severely held in check. (The U.S. VA care for veterans is a British-style socialized program.) Canada’s Medicare-For-All program covers every one, but the doctors are still private. One time on a vacation up north I took an informal poll by asking everyone I met at gas stations, restaurants, on the street and to a person they loved their Medicare for all ages. They just wanted to see it funded more adequately so that some waiting times for non-emergencies would become shorter.\nAbout 20 years ago I was among a handful of people who slept in on the marble floors of Louisville’s Humana company in an attempt to block the doors from incoming workers. It didn’t work because we missed one doorway but we were heartened when many of the Humana employees gave us a quick vee for victory sign for our Single Payer Healthcare message as they slipped into work.\nOur protest didn’t work. We didn’t even get arrested and our bid for more media publicity failed.\nWhat an irony to see an alleged murderer today spark talk from people disgruntled by our dismal health delivery system in this country. (Have you noticed that our television shows the past two months were smothered by Humana commercials for Medicare Advantage? Where were the other big insurance companies? Could it be that they carved up the country into private sectors of coverage just like any self-respecting cartel would do? Competition had magically disappeared.)\nWhat we can do at this stage is to get more informed. My way is to see what PNHP is saying about the situation. Just Google it. That’s Physicians for a National Healthcare Program. There is even an affiliate in Louisville called Kentucky Single Payer Healthcare. Try that website.\nWe deserve better and we can do without violence. I am ashamed that we are the only industrialized nation without universal health care and we have the dead bodies to prove it.",

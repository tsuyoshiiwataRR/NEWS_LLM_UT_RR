    "text": "THE Hurricanes have been dealt a blow with All Blacks back Ruben Love ruled out for up to half of the next Super Rugby season.\nLove, who scored two tries in his test debut against Japan on the end of year tour, has undergone surgery for an ankle injury that he’s been managing throughout the season and is expected to return in three to four months.\nWith the Super Rugby Pacific season starting in mid-February, Love may not be back until round eight or nine of the 16-round regular season.\nRuben Love of the Hurricanes is tackled by Laghlan McWhannell of the Blues.Ruben Love of the Hurricanes is tackled by Laghlan McWhannell of the Blues. Photo: Hagen Hopkins\nIf he is out for three months rather than four, he could be back in time for round five or six of the competition.\nMany pundits believe he would have been a leading contender to play first-five for the Hurricanes in their 2025 Super Rugby Pacific campaign. Others think he would have started at fullback.\nLove was with the All Blacks on their end of year tour but only got the one test cap after coming off the bench against Japan.\nHe also got game time for the All Blacks XV in their win over Munster in November.\n“I look forward to being back to full fitness next year to represent the people of the Hurricanes region and going to battle with my brothers,” Love said.",

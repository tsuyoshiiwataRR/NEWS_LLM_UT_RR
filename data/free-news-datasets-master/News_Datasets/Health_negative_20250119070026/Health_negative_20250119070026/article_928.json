They may contain errors.\n-\nGeoff Bennett:\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency yesterday in response to bird flu that's spreading among that state's dairy cows. The virus has already caused the deaths of more than 120 million birds across the country since 2022.\nStephanie Sy reports now on the news from Colorado on efforts to keep the dairy work force safe, given concerns that, the more the virus spreads, the greater the possibility that it mutates to allow spread among humans.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nIn this stretch of rural Colorado, Soraya Leon is a lifeline for many agricultural workers.\n-\nSoraya Leon, Community Health Worker, Project Protect:\nThe farmworkers and dairy workers, it's very hard. It's very hard to survive.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nShe's a community health worker with Project Protect, part of a statewide nonprofit. Her regular visits and food deliveries to farmworkers in need now includes a bag full of face shields and masks, the equipment that protects them from bird flu.\nSince the spring, avian influenza has been spreading in dairy cattle and has infected about 60 farmworkers nationwide. Despite the risks, this worker said he's gotten little information from his employer.\n-\nMan (through interpreter):\nThe owner, we never see him. They're not interested in us.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nSpeaking to us anonymously because he is undocumented, he told us earlier this year he was ill and had conjunctivitis. Commonly known as pink eye, the symptom is a sign of possible infection from this strain of bird flu.\n-\nSoraya Leon:\nOn a statistic, we don't have too much people sick from this fever. But on the reality, many people got sick, but they never know, because they never had information about what the symptoms are or how they feel.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nLeon is part of a network of so-called promotoras established during COVID to help spread critical information to Colorado's many Hispanic farmworkers.\nLately, the promotora network has shifted to addressing the threat from bird flu.\nDid workers get enough information when bird flu started circulating in this area over the summer?\n-\nSoraya Leon:\nNot really. The government response was too late. They know they have the sickness because the symptoms, the eyes, and the cows. So now they know they got this sickness, but only because we provide information later, not before.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nIn addition to groups like Project Protect, a federally funded agricultural health and safety center at Colorado State University has been using social media to provide information to workers.\nWhile the virus, known as H5N1, has killed more than 100 million poultry birds and tens of thousands of Marine mammals, in cows, it has been less deadly, with most recovering after experiencing a drop in milk production.\nWhile at least one person has been hospitalized with bird flu, this recent strain of the virus circulating in cows has been relatively mild in humans, and the risk to the public remains low.\nBut Colorado state veterinarian Maggie Baldwin and state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy are watching the changes in the pathogen closely.\n-\nDr. Maggie Baldwin, Colorado State Veterinarian:\nWe have seen this virus move from species to species before. We have seen spillover of this virus from wild birds and from poultry to mammals, and particularly that's been wild mammals in the past. What's concerning is the mammal-to-mammal transmission of the virus right now.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nWhile pasteurization has been shown to kill the virus in milk and dairy products, workers coming into contact with raw milk are at risk.\n-\nDr. Rachel Herlihy, Colorado State Epidemiologist:\nWe know that the more opportunities that we give this virus to be exposed to people, the more opportunities it has to adapt potentially and then gain that ability to potentially spread from person to person. And that's, of course, what we want to prevent.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nSince July, Colorado has mandated weekly bird flu testing of bulk milk samples from its licensed dairies.\n-\nDr. Maggie Baldwin:\nEvery week, we have seen fewer and fewer positives, which is fantastic news. But we really don't know what the long-term impact of this virus looks like. We know that, yes, the dairy cows do seem to build some level of an immune response, but we don't know if an infected herd could become reinfected.\nAnd dairy herds are constantly bringing in new replacement animals all the time.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nOver the summer, more than half of the dairy herds in Colorado tested positive for avian influenza. While there hasn't been a positive case since August, there's still concern about dairy farmworkers, many of whom are undocumented immigrants.\n-\nMan (through interpreter):\nThere really is very little support.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nAt a Mexican restaurant, we met one longtime dairy worker who also wanted to remain anonymous because of his immigration status.\nHave companies given the right protections to farmworkers to keep them safe?\n-\nMan (through interpreter):\nThere really weren't any measures taken. The only measure to avoid infection was when they washed the tires of the trailer trucks that arrived to drop off the feed. But as far as the personnel, I never saw them wearing any protective gear to avoid infection.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nHe described a friend who got sick and said the lack of paid sick leave makes workers hesitant to report their illnesses.\n-\nMan (through interpreter):\nFrom the moment a worker gets sick and stops working, he doesn't get anything.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nCommunity health worker Soraya Leon says there are also issues with access to clinics and the cost of care. Immigration status also plays a role in workers not getting tested.\n-\nSoraya Leon:\nUndocumented people, they don't say anything because they are afraid all the time.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nZach Riley with the Colorado Livestock Association says the industry has been a crucial partner with state officials in protecting animal and worker health.\n-\nZach Riley, Colorado Livestock Association:\nThere's been multiple free resources provided by the state and by employers to try to make sure that you are protected. I would say you would be hard-pressed to find somebody not doing it.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nI mean, we did speak to some farmworkers who said, without the help of these nonprofit organizations, might not have had the information or the PPE at their disposal.\n-\nZach Riley:\nI would venture to guess that's a very limited case and very limited number of those. Any one of our producers would gladly tell you they're offering a whole treasure trove of things to their employees.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nBut despite efforts to reach out to several different cattle organizations, including Riley's, we couldn't find a Colorado dairy farmer to speak with us, some citing concerns around the potential spread of bird flu.\nIn November, research from Colorado and Michigan confirmed what many people suspected. Antibody tests showed more farmworkers had signs of previous bird flu infections.\n-\nDr. Rachel Herlihy:\nThat is not uncommon when it comes to infectious diseases, because not everyone gets tested. But it does tell us that we still have work to do to protect humans from exposure.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nBack at El Centenario Mexican restaurant, this dairy worker agreed that more support is needed.\n-\nMan (through interpreter):\nMost people who work on dairy farms. Most of us lack someone to tell us what guarantees we have. We are really lacking information.\n-\nStephanie Sy:\nWhile there haven't been recent cases of bird flu in Colorado, dairy herds, the virus is continuing to spread widely in California cows. Earlier this month, federal ag regulators took Colorado's lead and announced mandatory milk testing for the first time, an acknowledgement that we are still a long ways from getting a handle on the spread of this disease.\nFor the \"PBS News Hour,\" I'm Stephanie Sy in Weld County, Colorado.",

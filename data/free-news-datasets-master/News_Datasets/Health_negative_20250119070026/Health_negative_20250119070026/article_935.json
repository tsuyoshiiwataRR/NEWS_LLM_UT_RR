    "text": "First Severe Bird Flu Case in US Highlights Evolving Risks\n[Alexa, Pixabay]\nThe United States has reported its first severe human case of H5N1 bird flu in 2024, involving a Louisiana resident in critical condition after suspected contact with an infected backyard flock. While most prior cases were mild and associated with dairy farm exposure, this case involves a different virus genotype found in wild birds. Bird flu has severely impacted agriculture, infecting 860 dairy herds and killing 123 million poultry since 2022. Health officials emphasize that the overall public risk remains low.\nThe case involves a Louisiana resident over the age of 65 with underlying medical conditions, who is currently hospitalized in critical condition with severe respiratory illness. Since April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 61 human cases of H5N1 in the United States, mostly among dairy farm workers exposed to a cattle strain of the virus. However, the Louisiana case is linked to a different virus genotype, D1.1, which has recently been detected in wild birds, poultry, and human cases in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington state. This strain is distinct from the B3.13 genotype previously identified in dairy herds and some poultry outbreaks, reports [Reuters. ](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/cdc-confirms-first-severe-case-bird-flu-us-2024-12-18/)\nThe CDC noted that sporadic severe cases of H5N1 are not unexpected, as similar incidents have been reported in other countries this year. Severe illness has been rare and most US cases have been mild, involving symptoms like conjunctivitis in farm workers exposed to infected cattle.\nEarlier this year, the WHO confirmed the first human death from the bird flu strain H5N2 in Mexico. A 59-year-old man died in April in Mexico City after showing symptoms of fever, shortness of breath, and nausea, as reported by [MBN.](https://mexicobusiness.news/health/news/who-confirms-first-human-death-bird-flu-h5n2-mexico?tag=bird-flu)\nCDC and USDA officials continue to monitor the situation closely to limit the spread of H5N1 and its impact on both human and animal populations.\n[Alexa, Pixabay]",

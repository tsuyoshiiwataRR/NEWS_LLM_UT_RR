    "text": "Could a holiday pet have consequences? Officials urge caution\nDAVENPORT, Iowa (KWQC) -Employees at animal shelters in the Quad Cities said they usually see an increase in animal adoptions around the holiday season.\n“They need to consider that it is a life and there is a lot to consider in bringing a new life into your home,” QC Paws shelter supervisor Abby Isenberger said.\nBefore getting a pet, Isenberger said shelter workers ask families questions about financial and physical responsibility.\n“We hope that we ask the right questions and can get these animals into a home that they can stay forever,” Isenberger said.\nBut after the holidays are over, workers say they’ve seen pets returned to the shelter.\n“Couple months later people realize, you know, maybe, they’re not able to take care of the pet,\" Bryn Rea, an animal caretaker at King’s Harvest Pet Rescue said.\nFinancial Impact\nThe workers also said they’ve seen pets being returned to the shelter because people can’t afford to take care of them anymore.\n“With everything, just the prices of everything going up, it’s been really difficult.” Rea said.\nAccording to the\n[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https:// With everything. Just the prices of everything going up, it's been really difficult.), the cost of pets, pet products and services in the U.S. has gone up for consumers in the last year.\nCopyright 2024 KWQC.

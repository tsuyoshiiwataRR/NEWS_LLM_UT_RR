    "text": "I tried taking [GLP-1 medication](https://www.eatingwell.com/what-are-glp-1-medications-who-should-use-them-8730466) injections for five months. Spoiler alert: They didn’t work as I’d hoped, but I have no regrets. I learned that these GLP-1 medications—which have become highly popular for diabetes management and weight loss—don’t work the same way for everyone. Perhaps best of all, my experiment with the medication renewed my commitment to losing weight primarily through healthy lifestyle choices, like diet and exercise. Here’s what happened, why I stopped and what I learned.\nThe Backstory\nI have always struggled with my weight, and have had bouts of [yo-yo dieting](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041459/fad-diets/) since I was 20. When I quit drinking in 2003, I turned to food and overeating to compensate for the loss of the alcohol. As a result, I gained a large amount of weight—more than 80 pounds—and I have not been able to lose it since. I struggle with an appetite that constantly gnaws away at me. With my busy schedule as a full-time writer and part-time teacher, I tend to deprioritize physical activity. All of these factors have brewed into a cocktail of obesity, and I want to reverse it.\nAbout two years ago, I became more motivated about losing weight. I joined the YMCA and, in a dramatic change of lifestyle, became a gym regular! I often shut the place down, even on a Friday night. I went to the gym several times a week: twice a week for water aerobics and the rest of the time for lifting weights and walking the track. I lost about 40 pounds.\nYet, after many months, my work schedule changed to include a large commute a few days a week that got me home late at night. That affected my gym habits and, once again, made it difficult to manage the food noise (where thoughts of foods become intrusive and inescapable, and can impact the ability to stick with a diet and exercise program).\nTrying the GLP-1 Medication\nI knew I needed the extra help to get back to working toward my weight-loss goals. So, I met with a doctor via video chat, and paid for a three-month introductory supply of GLP-1 medication injections. I was so excited to get my package in the mail with vials of medication, needles and alcohol wipes to clean the injection site on my stomach. This three-month supply started with the lowest dose, then increased gradually every couple of weeks to what would be the maximum dose by the end of the trial period.\nAt first, I felt very optimistic, as the low dose significantly reduced my appetite. I thought I might even be able to stay at that lower and less costly dose, because I was less than halfway to the maximum dose and getting notable results. I had few side effects, and my nighttime hunger (which historically was strong) significantly subsided.\nHowever, several years ago I had tried another GLP-1 medication and while it started off similarly, the effect it had on my appetite wore off quickly. My doctor would increase the dose, and it would suppress my appetite again—and then wear off in a few weeks. Within a couple of months, I was on the maximum dose and noticing hardly any difference in my hunger levels or weight.\nUnfortunately, the same thing happened with this GLP-1 medication. It worked fairly well at the smaller dose, and by the end of the three-month program, I had lost over 10 pounds. I purchased another two-month supply at the highest dose, but after five months total, the drug was barely impacting my appetite and my total weight loss was around 20 pounds. At this point, I made the choice to discontinue using the medication.\nThe Bottom Line\nWhile GLP-1 medications certainly can help with weight loss for some, they did not work as I expected for me. Plus, it is common to regain weight after discontinuing the medication. It may sound like dated advice, but losing weight and maintaining it for the long term typically boils down to tried-and-true lifestyle habits, like balanced diet, regular exercise, quality sleep and stress management.\nMost importantly, I am committed to working around my commute and work schedule and making time for physical activity. Even things like walking up and down the hall for a break at work can add up! To support my goals and meet my nutrition needs, I will continue eating more healthy foods that I enjoy, like salads with [homemade vinaigrette](https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252847/all-purpose-vinaigrette/), [hummus](https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252614/classic-hummus/) and vegetables, fruit and peanut butter and [protein shakes](https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18611/drinks/smoothies/protein/).",

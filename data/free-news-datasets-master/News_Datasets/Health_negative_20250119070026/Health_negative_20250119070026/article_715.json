Cane\nFlorida Dachshund And Chihuahua Mix Puppy (Chiweenie) Is Looking For A Loving Home\nThere are arguably pros and cons of adopting a puppy. It takes a great deal of work. Puppies have a great deal of curiosity and energy. So you will need to be watchful and patient. They also need to be taught all doggie behaviors from leash walking to potty training to crate training. However, on the plus side, puppies generally do not have trauma and therefore behavioral issues that you must overcome. I often write about dogs who have been in hoarding situations or have been left behind by their owners. Those issues can leave scars. Puppies are less likely to have long-term scars due to their age. And there is one dachshund and chihuahua mix puppy (also known as a Chiweenie) in Florida who is looking for a loving home.\n[Florida ·](/florida)11h\n[ · Followuser · 3.2K followers](https://www.newsbreak.com/robbie-newport-1602272)\nRobbie Newport\nOpinion: The light of the body is the eye\nThe King James Version Bible has a wonderful way of using words to express God’s thoughts through the Holy Spirit.

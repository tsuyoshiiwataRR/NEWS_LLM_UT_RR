    "text": "Environment Canada has issued a winter weather travel advisory for Brampton and Mississauga.\nThe national agency warns of a snow event expected from Thursday, Dec. 19 night into Friday morning.\nPotential hazards include snowfall accumulations of five to 10 centimetres and poor visibility at times of heavy snow.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW “A band of lake effect snow off Lake Ontario will develop overnight. This band, combined with an incoming low-pressure system, is expected to produce locally-enhanced snowfall amounts. The Friday-morning commute will be affected. Snow will taper to light flurries late Friday morning or early Friday afternoon, as this band shifts to the south,” the weather advisory said.\n“Motorists should expect hazardous winter driving conditions and adjust travel plans accordingly. There may be a significant impact on rush-hour traffic in urban areas.”\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Environment Canada reminds drivers to slow down in slippery conditions, watch for tail lights ahead and maintain a safe following distance. Also, if visibility is reduced while driving, turn on your lights and maintain a safe following distance.\nFor the latest on weather conditions, visit the Environment Canada website .\nA.M.

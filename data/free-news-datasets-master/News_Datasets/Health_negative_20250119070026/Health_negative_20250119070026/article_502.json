(NASDAQ: AQST) (“Aquestive” or the “Company”), a pharmaceutical company advancing medicines to bring meaningful improvement to patients' lives through innovative science and delivery technologies, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity (ODE) to Libervant® (diazepam) Buccal Film for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient’s usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy between two to five years of age. On April 26, 2024, Libervant® (diazepam) Buccal Film was approved for pediatric patients between two to five years of age. FDA granted ODE based on their assessment that Libervant’s buccal route of administration provides a major contribution to patient care over the rectal route of administration by providing a significantly improved ease of use.\n“As the first and only orally administered rescue therapy for this patient population, Libervant provides patients and caregivers an important, non-invasive treatment option,” said Daniel Barber, Chief Executive Officer of Aquestive. “We remain focused on ensuring that healthcare providers are educated on the benefits of Libervant and patients and caregivers within the indicated population have the best possible access to the product.”\nThe FDA’s Office of Orphan Products Development grants orphan designation status to drugs and biologics that are intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases, or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. The designation provides certain benefits, including financial incentives, to support clinical development and the potential for up to 7 years of market exclusivity in the U.S. upon regulatory approval. Libervant was originally granted Orphan Drug Designation on November 10, 2016 and the ODE now granted to Libervant for patients ages two to five extends to April of 2031.\nLibervant® (diazepam) Buccal Film is the first and only FDA approved orally administered rescue product for the treatment of seizure clusters in patients with epilepsy between two to five years of age.\nAbout Libervant\nLibervant is a buccally, or inside of the cheek, administered film formulation of diazepam, a benzodiazepine intended for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient’s usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy two to five years of age. Aquestive developed Libervant as an alternative to the device-based products currently available for patients with refractory epilepsy, including rectal gel and nasal spray products. The FDA granted tentative approval in August 2022 for Libervant for treatment of these epilepsy patients 12 years of age and older, with U.S. market access for Libervant for this age group of patients subject to the expiration of the existing orphan drug market exclusivity of a previously FDA approved drug scheduled to expire in January 2027. The FDA approval for U.S. market access received in April 2024 for Libervant is for these epilepsy patients between two and five years of age.\nImportant Safety Information\nDo not give Libervant® to your child if your child is allergic to diazepam or any of the ingredients in Libervant or has an eye problem called acute narrow angle glaucoma.\nWhat is the most important information I should know about Libervant?\n- Libervant is a benzodiazepine medicine. Taking benzodiazepines with opioid medicines, alcohol, or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (including street drugs) can cause severe drowsiness, breathing problems (respiratory depression), coma, and death. Get emergency help right away if any of the following happens:\n- shallow or slowed breathing,\n- breathing stops (which may lead to the heart stopping),\n- excessive sleepiness (sedation).\nDo not allow your child to drive a motor vehicle, operate heavy machinery, or ride a bicycle until you know how taking Libervant with opioids affects your child.\n- Risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Libervant is used in children 2 to 5 years of age. The unapproved use of Libervant has a risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and serious side effects including coma and death.\n- Serious side effects including coma and death have happened in people who have abused or misused benzodiazepines, including diazepam (the active ingredient in Libervant). These serious side effects may also include delirium, paranoia, suicidal thoughts or actions, seizures, and difficulty breathing. Call your child’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these serious side effects.\n- Your child can develop an addiction even if your child takes Libervant as prescribed by your child’s healthcare provider.\n- Give Libervant exactly as your child’s healthcare provider prescribed.\n- Do not share Libervant with other people.\n- Keep Libervant in a safe place and away from children.\n- Physical dependence and withdrawal reactions. Libervant is intended for use if needed in order to treat higher than usual seizure activity. Benzodiazepines, including Libervant, can cause physical dependence and withdrawal reactions, especially if used daily. Libervant is not intended for daily use.\n- Do not suddenly stop giving Libervant to your child without talking to your child’s healthcare provider. Stopping Libervant suddenly can cause serious and life-threatening side effects, including, unusual movements, responses, or expressions, seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus), sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes, depression, seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear, homicidal thoughts, an extreme increase in activity or talking, losing touch with reality, and suicidal thoughts or actions. Call your child’s healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if your child gets any of these symptoms.\n- Some people who suddenly stop benzodiazepines have symptoms that can last for several weeks to more than 12 months including, anxiety, trouble remembering, learning, or concentrating, depression, problems sleeping, feeling like insects are crawling under your skin, weakness, shaking, muscle twitching, burning, or prickling feeling in your hands, arms, legs or feet, and ringing in your ears.\n- Physical dependence is not the same as drug addiction. Your child’s healthcare provider can tell you more about the differences between physical dependence and drug addiction.\n- Do not give your child more Libervant than prescribed or give Libervant more often than prescribed.\nLibervant can make your child sleepy or dizzy and can slow your child’s thinking and motor skills.\n- Do not allow your child to drive a motor vehicle, operate machinery, or ride a bicycle until you know how Libervant affects your child.\n- Do not give other drugs that may make your child sleepy or dizzy while taking Libervant without first talking to your child’s healthcare provider. When taken with drugs that cause sleepiness or dizziness, Libervant may make your child’s sleepiness or dizziness much worse.\nLike other antiepileptic medicines, Libervant may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a small number of people, about 1 in 500.\n- Call a healthcare provider right away if your child has any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you:\n- thoughts about suicide or dying\n- new or worse depression\n- feeling agitated or restless\n- trouble sleeping (insomnia)\n- acting aggressive, being angry or violent\n- other unusual changes in behavior or mood\n- attempts to commit suicide\n- new or worse anxiety or irritability\n- an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania)\n- new or worse panic attacks\n- acting on dangerous impulses\n- Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings.\n- Keep all follow-up visits with your child’s healthcare provider as scheduled.\n- Call your child’s healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If your child has suicidal thoughts or actions, your child’s healthcare provider may check for other causes.\nWhat are the possible side effects of Libervant?\n- The most common side effects of Libervant are sleepiness and headache.\n- These are not all the possible side effects of Libervant.\n- Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.\nFor more information about Libervant, talk to your doctor, and see Product Information: [Medication Guide and Instructions For Use](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2Sjw7I_UkbMwpKnP-6xAMO4Q16inaueqMkj8yfrYxRXHQaN6Szy5mMH30FAjuQ23aTdITLEud3I7sUH0_nPDNk0Um-l1Kny6itepNTH1Ow4jfNTtEvtdmBruIMbJ1TGk75_RBtq7a8F3Sx0xx5_26ROwqaT6sxqh0NeeAaMemUWHM3WyDO07yiRSY4382CEWDaYqlkF6Z6K_rWoTWEAHC1sbRzCjvmikPAG3KfcQvV_skeOHCWo4UvSYgfMJAT1Hb6WkQ2D6RtmvFdXSikba41RkATmfZ7aG-auQZs9NAxnCffH36SE5NvOcntRy3ag_mexTr6pcxZkYAuAJCSo0YicxqpSP2K1q_NLkhvrgICvE97NxqKFhNTr94VYbCxX2NlCtYlo3L63xzYaUASPbCHvJbn4DguxYACjKzqhX-HFCd-J0acDi23l6hWKTS43Q).\nAbout Aquestive Therapeutics\nAquestive is a pharmaceutical company advancing medicines to bring meaningful improvement to patients' lives through innovative science and delivery technologies.

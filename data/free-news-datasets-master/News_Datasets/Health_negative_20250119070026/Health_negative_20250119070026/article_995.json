    "text": "[Celebrity](/celebrity/)\nLee Chaeyeon Reveals Serious Health Condition Due to Dancing?\nSinger Lee Chae-yeon has revealed that her back is in poor condition.\nOn December 19, [Lee Chaeyeon](/tag/lee-chae-yeon/) posted a photo on her Instagram story with the caption, “Let’s go together… Friend, please take care of me.”\nThe shared photo displayed an image of her spine. It appeared that Lee Chaeyeon had visited a hospital after experiencing discomfort. The image showed the disc fluid between her fourth lumbar vertebra (L4) and the first sacral vertebra (S1) appearing noticeably thinner than that of other areas, with some fluid seemingly leaking out.\nLater, Lee Chaeyeon uploaded a video showcasing her dance practice, captioning it, “It’s amazing it hasn’t burst yet. You worked hard.”\nThis indirectly indicated that her intense dance routines may have caused her back issues.\nLee Chaeyeon gained fame in 2018 by participating in Mnet’s girl group survival audition program “Produce 48.” She was selected as one of the final 11 members and served as the main dancer and lead vocalist of the project girl group IZ*ONE until their disbandment in April 2021. After resuming life as a trainee, she re-debuted as a solo artist on October 12, 2022. Known for her powerful and refreshing dance skills, she earned the title of “Summer Queen.”\nIn response to this news, netizens and fans couldn’t hide their concern and offered advice for her to rest:\n- Oh no… The back is crucial; take care of it for life.\n- If your back gives out, there’s no solution. Please manage it while you can.\n- It’s impossible to not have issues when you use your body like that.\n- Take good care of your health; you can’t get hurt.\n- Is the dark area the ruptured disc where the arrow is pointing?\n- It’s hard to find an idol who dances well and doesn’t have back issues.\n- Rest well, focus on posture, and exercise. Dancers seem to sit cross-legged or slouch a lot in practice rooms, which worries me as a fellow disc sufferer.\nMeanwhile, [Chaeyeon recently gained significant attention for her strong reaction to the impeachment of the South Korean president](/because-im-a-celebrity-i-speak-out-lee-chaeyeon-vs-why-do-celebrities-have-to-speak-out-lim-young-woong-on-presidents-impeachment/), insisting on her responsibilities as a celebrity.",

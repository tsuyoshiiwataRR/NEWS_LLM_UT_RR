    "text": "perspective\nI have BPD — and being deafblind made it harder to get help\nWhen I was around 13, my mum took me to our family GP for an appointment.\nThe doctor diagnosed me with depression, after conducting a common questionnaire to determine if I met the criteria.\nIt wouldn't be for over a decade, when I was 24, that I received the correct diagnosis — Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD.) This is an incurable mental disorder characterised by unstable moods, behaviour and relationships.\nMultiple psychologists over that period had failed to put the puzzle pieces together, resulting in me not getting the appropriate treatment until 2021.\nBy then, I needed medication and specialised therapy, known as Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT).\nNow that it's been three years since learning I have BPD, I'm trying to raise awareness of the condition to help reduce the stigma associated with it.\nI also live with deafblindness — a combination of vision and hearing loss. I was born with normal hearing and developed mild deafness at the age of six.\nThis was managed with hearing aids for the better part of 10 years, but in my teens things began to go downhill and I switched to Auslan as my main communication method. I had no use for hearing aids anymore, besides from environmental sounds, so I decided to stop wearing them.\nVision-wise, I was diagnosed with Optic Atrophy at nine months old and so I have no recollection of sight; there was no \"before and after\".\nMy mental health journey has prompted me to consider how many other deafblind people may be going undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.\nIt can be extremely challenging for people with dual sensory loss to reach out for support.\nI rely on an interpreter, so when seeking medical help I needed to factor in that this was very sensitive territory and my greatest vulnerabilities would be exposed.\nEven knowing there are strict confidentiality expectations, it's still not as simple as just talking to a doctor one-on-one. Having that third presence was definitely something I wasn't thrilled about.\nSchool didn't equip me to understand mental health challenges\nIn my experience, medical experts such as GPs, psychiatrists and psychologists typically have little to no understanding of deafblindness.\nThis lack of knowledge is part of what makes people like myself reluctant to seek out assistance.\nDeafblind people are more likely to experience anxiety and depression than other members of the community and most psychologists and counsellors don't know about deafblindness, according to Deafblind Australia.\nA shortage of interpreters makes it even more difficult for people like me to get the support they need.\nConsequently, we can run the risk of suffering poor mental health for most or all of our life.\nIn the wider disability community, statistics from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare show people living with disability are more likely to report moderate, high or very high psychological distress levels compared to those without disability.\nBy writing this and reflecting on my experiences, I hope to shed some light on this topic and promote discussion in the community.\nTalking publicly about mental health, although uncomfortable, is a crucial step towards creating change.\nStereotypically, it's something to be ashamed about. I've learnt that \"fake it till you make it\" is the socially acceptable approach.\nWhile I don't generally announce to the world that I have BPD, I'm certainly not embarrassed about it. It's not a dirty thing, it's a human thing.\nIt's perfectly OK to not be OK.\nPart of the problem is the gap in the education system.\nWhile it's obviously important that I did maths, English and science, I can't help noticing the absence of a focus on mental wellbeing throughout my schooling.\nSome of the knowledge gained in those other subjects, I will never use in my life. But mental health is something I have to deal with on a daily basis, so the benefit of incorporating this into my education would have been invaluable.\nI can't change the past, but I can try to change the future for incoming generations of students by encouraging the mandatory teaching of psychology or something equivalent in all schools.\nThe NDIS couldn't understand how I was feeling\nMy BPD is a secondary disability to my deafblindness. But many people would tell you that having a mental illness isn't, in fact, disabling.\nIt took an expensive report from a psychologist to persuade the NDIA (National Disability Insurance Agency) that I needed funding in my plan to cover BPD-related costs.\nIn their eyes, they couldn't understand how deafblindness could be linked to BPD. They couldn't comprehend that I might have been grieving the loss of my hearing.\nThis begs the question: why is the NDIA, which administers the NDIS, primarily run by people who've never lived in my shoes?\nAccording to the NDIS’s own disability inclusion plan, 17 per cent of staff have a disability. In senior executive roles the figure is 12 per cent.\nI'm sharing my story because I want my voice to be heard.\nI want empathy, not sympathy.\nI want respect.\nAbove all, I want equality.\nImproving attitudes is the best way to achieve these things. Turning a blind eye and a deaf ear (no pun intended) to what's happening is only proving more harmful.\nTake a moment to step outside your bubble of privilege and be proactive. Be an advocate.\nJust don't be silent.\nVanessa Vlajkovic is a 27-year-old subeditor at ABC News Digital from Perth.

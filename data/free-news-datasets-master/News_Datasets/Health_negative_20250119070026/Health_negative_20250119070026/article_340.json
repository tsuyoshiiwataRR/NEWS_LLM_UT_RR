    "text": "“90 Day Fiancé” star [David Murphey’s cause of death has been confirmed](https://www.tmz.com/2024/12/19/90-day-fiance-star-david-murphey-cause-of-death/), one day after his family announced his death on social media.\nThe 66-year-old reality star died as a result of cardiac issues, including [arrhythmia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350668) and [hypertensive cardiovascular disease](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21840-hypertensive-heart-disease), a spokesperson for Clark County, Nevada told TMZ.\nHe also suffered from a history of [pulmonary embolism](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-embolism/symptoms-causes/syc-20354647), a potentially deadly blockage in the lung, caused by a blood clot.\nHis family announced in an Instagram post Wednesday that [Murphey died on Dec. 11 at his Las Vegas home](https://www.instagram.com/p/DDum23Iy4UY/) following years of health issues. He’d been [diagnosed last year with liver cancer](https://www.tmz.com/2024/12/18/90-day-fiance-star-david-murphey-dead/) and had since undergone more than 13 surgeries, sources with direct knowledge previously told TMZ.\nThough Murphey was supposed to have another surgery, his loved ones told the outlet he was “very frail and unwell” in his final days.\n“David was a veteran, small business owner, and software engineer. He had recently retired from the Clark County Treasurer’s office in Nevada, having also worked for H&R Block and IGT,” his family said. “He was also well known for his time as a cast member on [’90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days.'”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zb310TyemY)\nMurphey [debuted on the fourth season of the TLC spinoff](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm11521746/) in 2020, which documented his longtime online romance with Ukrainian girlfriend Lana. Though the [former couple got engaged at the end of that season](https://www.eonline.com/news/1411320/90-day-fiance-star-david-murphey-dead-at-66), they ultimately broke up but Murphey’s time in the “90 Day” franchise endured for another two years.\nHe appeared in a dozen episodes of “90 Day Fiancé: B90 Strikes Back!” and a handful of episodes across “90 Day Bares All” and “90 Day Diaries.”\nMurphey’s time on TLC “allowed him to connect with viewers, see the world, and share his experiences with his thousands of followers on Instagram,” his family said.\nMurphey is survived by his two sisters and his adopted cat, Gamera. His family asked that those who wish to “help” do so by making donations in his name to [The Animal Foundation](https://animalfoundation.com/ways-give/give-honor-or-memory).",

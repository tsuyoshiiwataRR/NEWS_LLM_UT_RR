    "text": "California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency over an outbreak of bird flu in dairy cattle, as the virus spreads across US dairy farms and authorities rush to contain its transmission.\nThe H5N1 virus, detected in dairy cows in Southern California, has now spread to dairy herds across 16 states since first being confirmed in Texas and Kansas in March 2024, state officials said.\n“This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,” Newsom said in a statement . “While the risk to the public remains low, we will continue to take all necessary steps to prevent the spread of this virus.”\nCalifornia has the greatest number of human cases overall with 34 of the national 61, according to the CDC.\nRead more: https://t.co/oeBCcI1cgh\n— unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) December 19, 2024 The emergency order gives state agencies more flexibility in staffing and contracting to combat the outbreak. California has implemented what officials describe as the nation’s largest testing and monitoring system for the virus.\nPandemic 2.0 ? https://t.co/skqtLk4y65\n— GrainStats 🌾 (@GrainStats) December 18, 2024 No human-to-human transmission has been detected in California, with nearly all human infections linked to direct contact with infected cattle, health officials said.\nThe state’s response includes coordination between the California Department of Public Health, Department of Food and Agriculture, and Office of Emergency Services. Officials have distributed millions of pieces of protective equipment to high-risk dairy farm workers and launched multilingual outreach programs.\nState authorities are working with federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the US Department of Agriculture to monitor potential cases.\nThe state is also providing dairy workers with additional doses of seasonal flu vaccine to reduce concurrent flu risks, officials said.",

    "text": "Dhaka, the densely populated capital of Bangladesh, has ranked the second on the list of cities with the worst air quality with an AQI score of 277 at 8:20am this morning (December 20, 2024).\nToday’s air was classified as ' very unhealthy’ and such air quality continued for the past few days, posing a grave health threat, according to the AQI index.\n[Old, polluting buses in Dhaka to be scrapped to combat air pollution: Rizwana](https://unb.com.bd/category/Environment/old-polluting-buses-in-dhaka-to-be-scrapped-to-combat-air-pollution-rizwana/149414)\nWhen the AQI value for particle pollution is between 50 and 100, air quality is considered ‘moderate’, usually sensitive individuals should consider limiting prolonged outdoor exertion, between 101 and 150, air quality is considered ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’, between 150 and 200 is ‘unhealthy’, between 201 and 300 is said to be 'very unhealthy', while a reading of 301+ is considered 'hazardous', posing serious health risks to residents.\nIndia’s Delhi, Pakistan’s Lahore and Ghana’s Accra occupied the first, third and fourth spots on the list, with AQI scores of 531, 254 and 247 respectively.\n[Choking on progress: Dhaka's air pollution cripples health and economy](https://unb.com.bd/category/Special/choking-on-progress-dhakas-air-pollution-cripples-health-and-economy/149072)\nThe AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them.\nThe AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants: particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and ozone.\nDhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon.\nAs per World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, mainly due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections.",

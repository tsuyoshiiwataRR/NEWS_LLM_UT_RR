Here's what to know Olivia Rose Arizona Republic Show Caption\nHide Caption\nHow winter air pollution hurts people with asthma As fireplace smoke and dust accumulate in the cold air, people with asthma and other breathing ailments can feel trapped and afraid. Alyssa Williams, azcentral The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality issued a high pollution advisory for the Phoenix metro area through Friday, Dec. 20.\nOn Thursday morning, the National Weather Service Phoenix office and ADEQ said the buildup of air pollution in the atmosphere due to the current stagnant weather conditions may pose a health risk for sensitive groups.\n\"Adverse health effects increase as air quality deteriorates,\" said ADEQ.\nThose most at risk during air quality alerts are people with asthma, heart and lung conditions, older adults and children. ADEQ recommends sensitive groups decrease their physical activity at this time.\nAccording to ADEQ , everyone should consolidate their travel, reduce or eliminate fireplace use, refrain from outdoor burning and avoid using gas-powered lawn equipment.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said pollutants emitted from power plants, industries and automobiles make up most of these particles in the atmosphere. Some are emitted directly from a source, such as construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks or fires.\nThe two types of particle pollution Phoenix is seeing an increase in this week are PM-2.5 (fine particles usually less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) and PM-10 (particles usually less than 10 micrometers in diameter).\nAccording to EPA, these particles are so small, they can be inhaled into the lungs and even get into the bloodstream. PM-2.5 particles pose the greatest health risk.\nADEQ expects PM-10 levels to drop back down into the moderate category after Friday with less dust-generating work activities.\nThe high pollution advisory will end on Friday, but a PM-2.5 high pollution watch will be in effect on Saturday and Sunday, Dec. 21 and Dec. 22.\nThe PM-2.5 levels are forecasted to remain elevated through Sunday, due to an increase in fireplace usage, according to ADEQ. Temperatures have been unusually warm in Phoenix this week , so people may not be using their fireplaces as much.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

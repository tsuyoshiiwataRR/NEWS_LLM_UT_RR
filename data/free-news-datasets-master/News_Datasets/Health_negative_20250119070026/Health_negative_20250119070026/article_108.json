    "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The NFL football gods are certainly going to make Myles Garrett work for that half-sack he needs to reach 100.\nSitting at 99.5 sacks since the end of the 27-14 loss to the Steelers two games ago, that half-sack to reach the coveted milestone has been hard to come by.\nGarrett was added to the injury report on Thursday with a back injury and didn’t practice. His status for the Bengals game Sunday in Cincinnati is uncertain.\nDuring last Sunday’s 21-7 loss to the Chiefs, Garrett was held sackless despite coming close to taking down Patrick Mahomes a number of times. He was working primarily against All-Pro guard Joe Thuney, who slid over to replace inactive starter D.J. Humphries (hamstring).\nThuney, with some chipping help, gave Garrett one of his better battles of the season, but also inadvertently poked him in the eye at the end of the half in an incident that had Garrett on the ground and writhing in pain.\nHe went to the locker room to be examined, but jogged back out to the roar of the crowd after missing only four defensive plays, and finished the game. Afterward, his eye was red and swollen.\nMore Cleveland Browns coverage\nOn Monday, he visited his eye specialist and was cleared to participate fully in Wednesday’s practice. He did not appear on the injury report Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, Garrett participated in the walk-through, but walked inside during stretching before the regular practice session with two other injured players, David Njoku (hamstring) and Shelby Harris (elbow).\nIt’s not yet known if Garrett suffered the back injury in practice, a workout, or Sunday’s game, and his status for Sunday is uncertain. The Browns have one more full practice on Friday, which is when the game status report comes out. If he’s listed as questionable, it could come down to a gametime decision.\nBut Garrett would have to practically be in traction not to play. Known for playing hurt, he eagerly went back into the Chiefs game Sunday despite the swollen and painful eye. With the Browns at 3-10 at the time, no one would’ve blamed him for shutting it down.\nWhy didn’t he?\n“I’m a fighter,” he said. “Fighters fight. My brothers are out there, they’re doing the same thing and if I can go out there and make any kind of difference, I’m going to be out there with them every single time. I’ve had injuries, I’ve had pain, I’ve had illnesses. That doesn’t change anything.\n“They’re going to get every bit of the best out of me, every situation, every opportunity ... I’m going to do everything I can to be a difference for this team as long as I’m out there and as long as I can be out there, because I love this organization and I love this team. I love my brothers.”\nIn Cincinnati, Garrett will likely face another guard sliding over to tackle in Cody Ford, who’s expected to face starter Orlando Brown (fibula). Brown hasn’t practiced either of the past two days.\n“Yeah, I’m in favor of that,” defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz said “I mean, everybody has a plan. They’ve been using a lot more tight ends in the backfield, particularly on third down. There’s a lot of third downs where there’s no running back in the game and they’re using their tight ends to protect and chip and help them in blitzes and also help versus edge rushers. So it’s not just going to be a one-on-one battle. It’ll be coverage, it’ll be beating protections, it’ll be winning one-on-one matchups. Sort of the way it always is.”\nTied for fifth in the NFL with 11.0 sacks this season, Garrett -- the reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year -- can tie Bruce Smith and Lawrence Taylor as the fourth-fastest players to reach 100 sacks in 115 games if he takes down Joe Burrow on Sunday.\nHe was held sackless in the Bengals’ 21-14 victory in Cleveland on Oct. 20, but faced Brown that game. Overall, he’s sacked Burrow eight times in seven games, his most against any one QB.\nWill he get the chance to try on Sunday?\nFootball Insider newsletter free trial: Take a minute and sign up for a free trial of our Football Insider newsletter, featuring exclusive content from cleveland.com's Browns reporters.",

    "text": "The worries of Steelers fans have been confirmed: George Pickens has been ruled OUT for the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Week 16 AFC North showdown with the Baltimore Ravens .\nHowever, his absence from last week’s and this week’s games provides ammunition to the season-long argument regarding the Steelers’ wide receiver room: HC Mike Tomlin and OC Arthur Smith need to give rookie WR Roman Wilson a chance.\nIt was recently argued by Steelers insider Gerry Dulac that Wilson’s inability to stay healthy during training camp and practices early on in 2024 forced the team to move on from his contributions this year. However, Pickens’ absence should force the team to reconsider.\nIn the past two games Pickens has missed, QB Russell Wilson struggled to find production out of his receivers and threw for a combined 286 yards in Weeks 14 and 15.\nRegardless of Tomlin claiming to have “moved on,” or any insiders believing the rookie receiver will get his chance in 2025, one thing remains certain—the Wilson-to-Wilson connection could be the much-needed medicine for this dying Pittsburgh Steelers offense.\nArticles Is T.J.

    "text": "By Adam Holt ,\n1 hours ago\nThe New England Patriots gave fans a notable update on one of their most beloved players on Thursday afternoon.\nPatriots give update on Christian Barmore New England is placing Barmore on the non-football illness list, according to a team announcement. That decision will end his 2024 season.\nThe New England Patriots are placing defensive lineman Christian Barmore on the reserve non-football illness list after he experienced some recurring symptoms that required further evaluation. We appreciate everything Christian did to return to the team this season, but our top priority is Christian's health and wellbeing. We know that he will continue to receive tremendous care and we want to ensure that he gets the time he needs to come back stronger than ever. -- New England Patriots\nBarmore was hospitalized with blood clots in July of this year. He missed the first ten games of the season due to the issue. He was activated in the middle of November.\nThis latest choice by New England was made due to recurring symptoms. Barmore enjoyed a career-best season in 2023, totaling 8.5 sacks, 64 tackles, and 13 tackles for loss.\nHe's one of the Patriots' best young players. Hopefully, he can make a full recovery and return to the field at full strength in the future.\nRelated: What happened on Anfernee Jennings' roughing the passer penalty?

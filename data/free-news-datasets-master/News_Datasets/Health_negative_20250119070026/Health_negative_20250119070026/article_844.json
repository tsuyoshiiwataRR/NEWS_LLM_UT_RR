    "text": "Summary of the crisis\nKey features\nLocation: Myanmar and surrounding areas\nTypology: Conflict, displacement, humanitarian access, food security\nWHO Grade: Protracted Grade 3, Myanmar Conflict and Humanitarian Crisis\nBrief description of event:\nMyanmar has been in a state of emergency since 1 February 2021 following the takeover of the government by the Myanmar military. In response, a civil disobedience movement began, which then turned into armed resistance, resulting in significant population displacement and interruption of services. In 2025, there will be an estimated 19.9 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, 4 million people internally displaced, 1.5 million refugees, and 386 000 Stateless people in Myanmar (Rohingya) amid a deteriorating situation, particularly in northern Shan, Mandalay region and Rakhine state (OCHA, 2024). Twenty-five million people are estimated to be living in poverty because of the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis. There have been approximately 433 attacks on health-care facilities reported. Intensification of conflict, displacement of millions of people, and decrease in the health workforce continue to exacerbate health service delivery challenges\nOperational constraints\n(i) Significant displacement, acute food insecurity and interruption of essential services, including health services, particularly in conflict-affected and hard-toreach areas.\n(ii) Protection concerns, including increasing reports of landmine and explosive ordnance incidents, premature returns, confiscation of civilian assets and the threat of forced recruitment.\n(iii) Restrictions on domestic and cross-border supply chains, restricting availability of sufficient and quality vaccines, medicines and health supplies.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (7News) — Nearly one in three Americans wears a fitness device. These watches, which track your health and fitness, are designed to do everything from monitor your heart rate and count your steps, to analyze your sleep and remind you to move.\nIn the last decade, sales have skyrocketed with more than half a billion sold just in 2024.\nBut the very devices we rely on to help us stay healthy may pose a hazard.\n“We discovered of these 22 watch bands that we looked at, that there was PFAS in many of them,” said physicist Dr Graham Peaslee.\nRELATED | [We found toxins in school lunches. Key US Senators want to reach across aisle to fix it](https://wjla.com/features/i-team/washington-dc-toxic-chemicals-student-kids-children-school-lunches-pfas-pesticides-heavy-metals-lawmakers-senators-john-fetterman-interview-congress-action-safety-public-health-maryland-virginia-developmental-delays-liver-disease-cancer)\n[Peaslee studies contaminants in textiles at Notre Dame](https://news.nd.edu/news/researchers-detect-elevated-levels-of-pfas-in-some-fitness-tracker-and-smartwatch-bands/) and since 2018 has focused on PFAS chemicals, often found in water-resistant products from clothing to accessories.\n[A new report ](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00907#)reveals some sports watch bands contain PFAS chemicals tied to everything from cancer and infertility to autoimmune disease.\nWe sat down with Peaslee to talk about his findings.\nLisa Fletcher: “Are there any of the levels of the toxins in the watch products you tested so high that you think the manufacturer should be taking action or the product should be recalled?”\nDr Graham Peaslee: “I think the levels are so high that we shouldn't be using this material.”\nPeaslee got the idea of testing watch bands while reading the newspaper.\n“We saw an ad in the newspaper advertising a fluoroelastomer watch band. And i said, ‘Oooh, fluoroelastomer, that's a PFAS, why would they be advertising that?’” said Peaslee.\nFluoroelastomer helps makes watch bands more comfortable and resistant to water, oils and sweat, making them a popular choice among consumers.\n“It presents an exposure risk to those people who are wearing it,” said Peaslee. “It's not just a one-time user effect. Users wear these smart watches and fitness bands for 12 hours at a time or longer, even when they're sweating for example.”\nIncreasing the risk of the chemicals entering your body.\nREAD MORE | [EPA sets first-ever limits on toxic PFAS in America's drinking water](https://wjla.com/features/i-team/epa-pfas-forever-chemicals-toxic-drinking-water-standards-america-sets-limits-environmental-protection-agency-water-filters-district-of-columbia-per-and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-virginia-maryland-dc)\n“Chemicals move more quickly in heat,” said Peaslee. “The sweat pores open more when you're in actual healthy activities. All these PFAS transfer through the skin and they go through the surface and stick in the skin or they go all the way through to the blood.”\nAlong with finding more common PFAS, Peaslee's study identified a unique, single PFAS of particular concern: PFHxA. It was found in \"very high concentrations\" in his tests. And while the European Union has effectively banned the chemical, it is unregulated in the United States.\nThis, is despite the recent EPA finding that PFHxA can affect the liver, blood cells and endocrine systems.\n“It doesn't accumulate in your blood the way other PFAS do,” said Peaslee. “It's not in blood serum. It's in whole blood. So, it sticks to the red blood cells of your blood.\" Peaslee says this is why it was originally thought that PFHxA not as concerning - because it wasn't showing up in traditional blood tests. It was not until a Swedish scientist started testing whole blood that its presence and accumulation was recognized. In fact, the team discovered PFHxA was the third-most-common PFAS found in whole blood.\nSEE MORE | [Maryland bill to eliminate dangerous PFAS chemicals found in common pesticides](https://wjla.com/features/i-team/dangerous-pfas-forever-chemicals-common-pesticides-maryland-agriculture-cancer-health-problems-safety-bill-legislation-climate-change-food-steven-lasee-texas-tech-senator-brian-feldman)\nAvoiding the chemicals means knowing what to look for.\n“How can the consumer avoid it? Well, in this case, it comes with a label,” said Peaslee. “It's called a price tag. The more expensive ones are more likely to contain this “wonderful” chemical, and the cheaper ones, the under $15 ones didn't have it at all.”\n“This is why we publish the papers because I’m trying to convince not just the consumer, but also the people who make these products that if we don't have an alternative, let's make one,” said Peaslee. “Most companies once they realize what they've done will switch away from it. But I would like these things to be gone.”",

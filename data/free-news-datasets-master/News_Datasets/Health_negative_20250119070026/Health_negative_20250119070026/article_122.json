    "text": "People warned not to swim at Hobart beaches after wastewater plant knocked out by Cadbury factory\nIn short:\nTasWater says it's been working with the Cadbury factory for three weeks to address the issue which led to water contamination.\nPublic Health officials say swimming in the contaminated areas can result in diarrhoea, vomiting and infections.\nWhat's next?\nTasWater says it expects to see \"improved performance\" in the coming days but the environmental watchdog warns it may be \"days or weeks\" before it's safe to swim again.\nPeople have been warned against swimming at many of Hobart's beaches after industrial waste from the Cadbury factory knocked out a local sewage treatment plant.\nThe 'do not swim' advice applies to the River Derwent between Austins Ferry and Old Beach in the north, and Sandy Bay across to Howrah in the south.\nPublic health officials said risks to swimmers over the summer holiday period included diarrhoea, vomiting as well as infections of the skin, ears and eyes.\n\"Sewage in water used for recreational activities like swimming poses a risk to health from viruses and bacteria,\" Public Health director Dr Mark Veitch said.\n\"We're advising people to stay out of the water is the short answer.\"\nTasWater said \"high strength trade waste\" discharged the Claremont Cadbury chocolate factory, owned by Mondelez International, had killed the bacteria in the nearby Cameron Bay Sewage Treatment Plant.\nWithout the bacteria to break down and treat waste at the plant, it has effectively been taken offline.\nUntreated sewage waste is now flowing through into the river and impacting beaches.\n\"It's disappointing this has significantly impacted the river, particularly at a time of the year we know Hobartians gather around the water to swim and spend time with their friends and families,\" TasWater general manager Matt Balfe said.\n\"We share their frustration.\"\nMr Veitch the areas of highest contamination would be around the treatment plant at Berridale.\nBut there was no clear indication of how bad it would be at other nearby beaches.\n\"We don't have monitoring results on the rest of the Derwent that tell us what the water quality is like after this spill,\" he said.\nHe said further testing results were expected over the weekend.\n\"It's a slightly unusual situation to have ongoing spillage into a water source. Often it's just a one-off event,\" Mr Veitch said.\nIssue could take 'days or weeks' to fix\nThe Environmental Protection Authority said there would not be a quick fix over the Christmas period.\n\"They have to re-establish the bacteria â€” that could take days or weeks. I'm not an expert but it certainly won't be quick,\" director Wes Ford said.\nThe issue had been festering for weeks, TasWater said.\n\"We have been working with Mondelez over the last three weeks in an effort to bring them into compliance and address the deterioration in performance we have been seeing at our plant,\" Mr Balfe said.\n\"Unfortunately, due to the high strength of the waste the bacteria at the plant have been wiped out, effectively taking the plant offline.\"\nTasWater said it expected to see \"improved performance\" from Cadbury's owners in the coming days.\nCadbury 'working vigorously' on issue\nA Monzelez spokesperson said the health and safety of the community and the environment were its \"upmost (sic) priorities\".\n\"We have recently undertaken a $3 million upgrade of Mondelez International's wastewater treatment plant which prepares milk solids and other manufacturing byproducts for safe disposal,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We are working vigorously and collaboratively with TasWater to fully investigate and resolve the matter.\"\nPublic Health will continue to issue updates.",

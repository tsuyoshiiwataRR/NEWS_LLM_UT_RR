Using Medicare data from 40,737 patients from AHRQâ€™s Quality and Safety Reviewed System, the researchers found adverse event rates increased from 59 per 1,000 admissions in weeks with lower COVID-19 numbers to 97 per 1,000 admissions in weeks with higher COVID-19 numbers. The pattern remained for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, suggesting hospital stress from surges affected overall patient safety. The authors urge hospitals to build resilience and surge capacity to ensure safety during future demand spikes from pandemics, natural disasters or other causes. For example, hospitals could quickly implement creative staffing models to address shortages.

    "text": "The owner of Sunnyside-based fruit and juice company Valley Processing Inc. pleaded guilty to violating federal food safety laws, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\nMary Ann Bliesner, 83, who owned the now-closed plant, pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors: failing to register a food facility with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and conspiracy to introduce misbranded and tainted fruit juice into interstate commerce.\nSome of the tainted juice was sold to be used in the National School Lunch Program, a news release from U.S. Attorney's Office said.\nSpokane-based attorney Carl Oreskovich represented Bliesner. He said Bliesner was responsible for company actions but never intended to distribute the tainted juice.\n\"That was not a large quantity in terms of the company's business,\" Oreskovich said. \"It was certainly something Mary Ann (Bliesner) did not want to happen, but it did happen.\"\nOreskovich said Valley Processing was a large business with more than 100 employees and multiple levels of management.\n\"There were directions that were given and not followed. Things got slack and there was juice that got produced that should not have been produced,\" Oreskovich said.\nHe added that Bliesner has since retired. Bliesner agreed to pay $742,139 and will be sentenced on March 26.\nPlea agreement between Mary Ann Bliesner and U.S. Attorney's Office\nFDA investigators found that Valley Processing, or VPI, was blending old and improperly stored juice concentrate with newer juice concentrate and then selling the new mixture to customers, the release said.\n“VPI admitted that it blended grape juice concentrate, which was stored outside the VPI facility for years and exposed to the elements, with newer grape juice concentrate, and sold the resulting blended grape juice product to unsuspecting customers as if it were new product,” the release said. “VPI sold at least some of this contaminated product to customers who provided grape juice for the National School Lunch Program, which provides free or reduced-cost lunches to children.”\nThe release said the juice concentrate was contaminated after being stored improperly and Valley Processing employees initially stopped inspectors from looking at the vats by placing caution tape over the entrance to the storage room with the older concentrate and telling inspectors the facility was unsafe to enter.\n“FDA investigators later learned about the vats and, after entering the room, observed grape juice concentrate that testing later confirmed was contaminated with bird and rodent feces, fur, insects, decaying remains of animals, mold, yeast and other contaminants,” the release said. “FDA inspectors also observed and photographed a live rat walking across the hardened crust that had formed on top of the grape juice concentrate.”\nOreskovich acknowledged the poor storage conditions, but said that putrid juice was never intended to be used. A small amount was mixed in and sold, he added, and no one got sick.\n\"There was not one case, that I'm aware of, of anyone who consumed Valley (Processing) juice getting sick,\" Oreskovich said.\nThe news release said the facility where juice was produced was not registered with the FDA.\nIn 2020, Valley Processing was sued for producing juices tainted with inorganic arsenic and moldy fruit. Bliesner agreed to an injunction that stopped the company from producing fruit juice. Federal prosecutors charged Bliesner and Valley Processing with fraud and violations of food safety laws in 2022.\nFDA officials said Valley Processing’s actions put consumers and schoolchildren at risk. Valley Processing is now closed.\nOreskovich said Bliesner was a pioneer for women in the industry and this case was an unfortunate end to her career.\nJasper Kenzo Sundeen can be reached at jsundeen@yakimaherald.com .\nOriginally published on yakimaherald.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .",

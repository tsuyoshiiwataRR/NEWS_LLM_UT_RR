    "text": "Interim HC Darren Rizzi commented that RB Alvin Kamara's groin injury is more serious than they initially thought. He also said that it doesn't look good for Kamara to return this week. If Kamara can't go, RB Kendre Miller will likely be the lead back for the Saints against the Packers on Monday Night Football.\nUpdate: ESPN's Adam Schefter reports that, while Kamara is still being evaluated, his injury could be season-ending.\nHC Darren Rizzi: \"It is a little more significant than originally thought and is 'week-to-week.' Doesn't look good for him to return this week though.\"\nWith the Saints out of playoff contention, there is little reason to rush Kamara back from this injury, especially if it is more serious than it first appears.\nDown WR Chris Olave, TE Taysom Hill, and possible still QB Derek Carr, the Saints offense tanks to the worst in the NFL without Kamara.\nMiller filled in admirably for Kamara and scored a TD last week. Though he is unlikely to take the passing work from Kamara, he becomes an intriguing desperation option for the fantasy playoffs since the workload should be solid.\nMiller was the only other RB to touch the ball last week outside of Kamara.\nThe Saints do have both Jamaal Williams and Jordan Mims on the roster as well.\nWhat moves do you need to make this week? From lineup strategy to free agent pickups to DFS, our experts give you moves to make before Week 16.\nTank Dell has disappointed dynasty managers this season. But what is the problem? Can it be fixed? Let's dive into the film to see if there is any hope.\nA quick look at the most important matchup data to consider when making Week 16 start/sit decisions, including implied points, projected plays, WR/CB matchups, and adjusted fantasy points allowed.\nThis is an insider feature of Draft Sharks, please upgrade to be an Insider Member\nLearn More Â»\nAll transactions are secure and encrypted, and we never store your credit card information.",

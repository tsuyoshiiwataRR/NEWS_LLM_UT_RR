    "text": "Lightning’s JJ Moser to miss 8-10 weeks with lower-body injury\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning announced that defenseman JJ Moser will miss the next eight to ten weeks with a lower-body injury.\nMoser left Thursday’s game against the [Calgary Flames](/teams/calgary-flames/line-combinations) after registering an assist in 12:23 of ice time. He did not skate on Saturday in a 5-1 win over the [Seattle Kraken](/teams/seattle-kraken/line-combinations).\nInjury Update: J.J. Moser is expected to miss 8-10 weeks with a lower body injury. pic.twitter.com/YUtMNuTZPx\nDecember 19, 2024\nMoser was placed on injured reserve on Dec. 14, meaning he will be unable to return to the lineup until at least Dec. 22 against the [Florida Panthers](/teams/florida-panthers/line-combinations).\nMoser has been a key piece for the Lightning since coming over from Utah over the summer. Moser has two goals and 10 points in 27 games, primarily playing alongside Victor Hedman on the top pairing. The Swiss native has 82 points in 232 career games over four seasons, primarily with the Arizona Coyotes. The 24-year-old has also represented his country in four World Championship tournaments, registering eight points in 25 games.\nMoser made his way to Tampa Bay in the trade that saw the [Utah Hockey Club receive Mikhail Sergachev](/news/tampa-bay-lightning-trade-mikhail-sergachev-to-utah-hockey-club). The Lightning also received forward Conor Geekie and a pick in the 2024 NHL Draft.\nMoser scored a career-high seven goals and 24 assists for 31 points during the 2022-23 campaign, before posting five goals and 21 assists for 26 points this past season, with a plus/minus of -5.\nIn three seasons in Arizona, the 24-year-old has appeared in 205 games, scoring 16 goals and 56 assists with a -27 rating. Moser has played an average of 20:22 of ice time thus far.",

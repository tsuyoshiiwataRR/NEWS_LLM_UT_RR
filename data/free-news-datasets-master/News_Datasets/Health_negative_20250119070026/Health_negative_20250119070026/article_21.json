    "text": "LYNCHBURG, Va. (WSET) — It is with deep sadness that ABC13 announces the passing of Mark Spain, who was a vital anchor in both our newsroom and the community.\nOn Wednesday, December 18, Mark died after a battle with pancreatic cancer.\nHis smile and positivity were known to his family, our team here at WSET, and the thousands across Lynchburg and beyond who welcomed Mark into their homes each night on TV. When he first addressed the community regarding his cancer diagnosis in early December, he echoed that familiar sunny outlook despite the heavy situation.\nHis battle against cancer was not fought alone. Those closest to Mark’s side were his beloved family; with his passing, he left behind his wife, Lynita, and three children: two daughters and a son.\nLynita announced her husband's passing, emphasizing how much love he brought into the world.\n\"Our family along with the city of Lynchburg lost a man of hope, someone who loves his city and stood for equality, treating others with respect and kindness,\" she said. \"He was a husband, father, brother, friend and a positive light in the community. My first true love. He brought so much joy, compassion, love, and strength into our lives, and his absence will be deeply felt by all who knew him.\"\nMark fought hard, Lynita said, with his family alongside him. He stayed positive until the end.\nMark fought from the start to the finish and was not afraid. He wasn’t in any pain, and was continually comforted and surrounded by his family until the end. The Spain family is overwhelmed with gratitude for all of the cards, comments, support and prayers. He loved his family and loved this community who invited him into their homes each night!\n\"We have comfort in knowing he is no longer suffering, it was not easy watching him fight for his life and battle this disease, but he was not alone., and neither were we,\" Lynita said.\nShe thanked the community for the support shown to the Spain family over the past few weeks before turning to the future and asking to keep the prayers coming.\n\"This new journey, one I never thought I’d be on, as a single parent will be a new and challenging one,\" she said. \"God is walking alongside us, guiding and protecting us. Please keep our family in your thoughts and prayers.\"\nHe also leaves behind a void in his work family at WSET. Since 2015, Mark worked as a lead anchor for our evening and late shows. As a skilled journalist passionate about his field, his role as a worker made him vital to the daily flow of news. And as a human being who cared about making a difference, his nearly ten years at the station saw him mentor dozens of young professionals. His guidance and genuine care for those he worked with made him much more than just a coworker or even a friend–he was a member of the family.\nBut ABC13 was just the last stop on an accomplished and successful career. He started out at just nine years old working as a paperboy for the Cleveland Press. That early love for news kept him in the business. He majored in Communications at Cleveland State University and worked multiple jobs in the journalism industry, including in Fort Wayne, Erie, Indianapolis and Cleveland. In 2000, he headed to Florida and worked as an anchor in Jacksonville for 14 years.\nIn 2015, his path brought him to Lynchburg, where he became known both for his love of the community and for his work. His excellent journalism was prize-winning; throughout his time at ABC13 he took home multiple awards.\nAmong these was the 2018 Best News Anchor award from the Association Press of the Virginias. He won that same award again in 2019. From the Virginia Association of Broadcasters, he won 1st place for Outstanding News Series in 2018, and he won Best Documentary or Public Affairs Program in 2022. He helped land many other awards for the crew at WSET over the years as well.\nMark cared deeply about the Lynchburg community, which was reflected in his words and actions over the years. One of the latest examples of this happened over this summer when he helped raise $75,000 for Jubilee Family Development Center with ABC13’s Community Counts program.\nBut when he was diagnosed with cancer, the community had its own chance to reflect that compassion back at him. In the days after Mark’s cancer diagnosis, thousands of people took to social media to offer their support. Dozens of media in the area and beyond wore purple to stand with him, and our office was flooded with cards and notes of encouragement for Mark and his family.\nWe would like to thank the entire community for the love and support you showed.\nIf you would like to continue supporting his family in the days ahead, a GoFundMe has been set up to support them. You can see the GoFundMe [HERE.](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-mark-spains-battle-with-pancreatic-cancer)\nOver the next few days, you may notice national news programs or syndicated programming in place of local news while ABC13 grieves our loss.\n* This article was originally posted on ABC13 (WSET) and shared with WACH FOX with permission.",

    "text": "MONROE, La. (KNOE) - After the state reported its first severe human case of the bird flu, KNOE looked into how humans and other mammals can get infected.\nAn animal medicine expert said Thursday, Dec. 19 that the bird flu is usually contained in bird populations.\n“We’ve had some cats get it from eating - or drinking, rather, raw milk. And then of course we’ve had some spill over into humans as well. So, the spill overs that have happened with this particular outbreak have been in primarily dairy workers who have come into contact with cows that have been infected, poultry workers who are handling poultry,” said Associate Professor Rebecca Christofferson at LSU School of Veterinary Medicine.\nThe CDC reported Wednesday that a Louisiana resident is hospitalized with the nation’s first severe case of the bird flu.\nBACKGROUND STORY: SWLA resident has first severe case of bird flu in US\nChristofferson, who specializes in emerging viral pathogens, said they see multiple routes of transmission.\n“Now, how that gets into the backyard flocks, we still don’t really understand. We can make the assumption, and it’s a pretty good educated guess that it came from wild bird populations. Louisiana is in a flyway. We have migrating birds all the time. It’s one of the reasons we’re huntsman’s paradise, right? We’re Sportsman’s Paradise,” said Christofferson.\nChristofferson said one of the things scientists worry about is adaption if it continues to go from mammal to mammal - that comes with risks of it becoming a severe disease; especially in vulnerable populations. But, it’s possible to be contained in the human population, according to Christofferson.\n“So, even though it’s mild in a lot of cases, we don’t want to take our foot off the gas of surveillance and response because we don’t want to allow it the opportunity to get to the point where we flip that table and the more severe cases are the norm and not the exception,” said Christofferson.\nThe Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry reported Thursday that the bird flu has been detected in a second Louisiana backyard flock.\nRELATED CONTENT: Bird flu found in SWLA backyard flock after person hospitalized",

    "text": "Insurance Denials: Healthcare providers say insurance companies have increased their demands that doctors obtain approval before providing treatment, a trend that leads to more denials of coverage for medical care. Insurers say the restrictions are meant to curb the rising cost of health care but news reports say the practice has fueled public frustration and anger.\nProviders say the requirements for prior authorization are burdensome and can restrict access to treatment for much-needed medical care. According to the AMA, a quarter of physicians reported that such requirements led to an adverse event for a patient. More than 9 in 10 said that the practice causes delays in treatment.\nAdvocates for patients say the practice can leave consumers with medical bills they cannot pay or no treatment at all.\nThe George Washington University has experts available to talk about access to medical care, prior authorization and trends in coverage. To interview an expert, please contact Kathy Fackelmann, or Katelyn Deckelbaum, .\nLeighton Ku, a Professor of Health Policy and Management and Director of the Center for Health Policy Research at the GW Milken Institute School of Public Health, is an expert on the Affordable Care Act and access to healthcare. He can discuss access to affordable healthcare and trends in healthcare coverage.\nAlison Barkoff, is the Harold and Jane Hirsh Associate Professor of Health Law and Policy at the GW Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is a nationally recognized expert in health law and policy and can discuss access to healthcare, insurance and other issues. Newswise/SP",

    "text": "Influenza has been declared “prevalent” across New York state, with flu cases in New York City surging by over 70% within a single week, just as airports in the region brace for what is expected to be record-setting holiday travel.\nDr. James McDonald, New York State’s health commissioner, made the announcement on Wednesday, urging everyone aged six months and older to receive a flu vaccine. He emphasized the importance of vaccination as a critical measure to combat the spread of the illness.\nRecent health department statistics, dated through December 14, reveal a total of 23,313 confirmed flu cases spanning 60 counties since the start of the season.\nIn New York City alone, the number of lab-confirmed flu cases has seen a staggering 72% increase compared to the previous week, jumping from 2,501 to 4,300 cases. Similarly, outside the city, flu cases rose by 75%, climbing from 2,058 to 3,603 over the same period. Hospitalizations linked to the flu have also spiked significantly, with a 48% rise statewide, increasing from 270 to 399 in just one week.\nThe state’s update coincided with an announcement from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Officials there are projecting that 13.8 million travelers will pass through the region’s airports and vehicular crossings during the year-end holiday travel period, which runs from December 21 through January 2. This includes an estimated 5.2 million passengers at JFK, Newark, LaGuardia, and Stewart airports, alongside 8.6 million vehicles using the bridges and tunnels.\nTypically, flu activity reaches its peak in January or February. For those seeking the most recent data, the state health department provides flu reports and a tracking tool online.\nWith the designation of the flu as “prevalent,” unvaccinated healthcare workers in state-regulated healthcare and residential facilities are now required to wear surgical or procedural masks, officials noted. This measure aims to curb the transmission of the virus within vulnerable populations.\nHealth officials continue to strongly recommend flu vaccinations for all individuals aged six months and older. Describing the vaccine as “a safe and effective way to protect against infection and lessen the symptoms if you get sick,” they underscored its importance in safeguarding public health.\nThose at the greatest risk of severe flu-related complications include people aged 65 and older, individuals with certain chronic medical conditions, young children, and pregnant women. Such complications can result in hospitalization or even death, making preventive measures all the more crucial.\n{Matzav.com}",

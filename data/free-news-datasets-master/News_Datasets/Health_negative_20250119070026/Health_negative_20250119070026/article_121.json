    "text": "By Timothy Nazzaro ,\n3 hours ago Authorities are investigating after a woman was mauled by dogs Thursday afternoon in Boston’s Dorchester neighborhood.\nPolice say they received a 911 call around 2:43 p.m. for a vicious dog in the area of 208 Brunswick Street.\nArriving officers found a victim in her 70s who had sustained several dog bites, according to investigators.\nShe was transported to an area hospital with serious injuries.\nOfficials say a tourniquet needed to be applied to assist the victim.\nThe dogs involved in the attack were secured in a backyard.\nIt is unclear what breed of dogs were involved.\nThe incident remains under investigation by Boston Police and Boston Animal Control.\nLast month, a woman was mauled to death by a dog less than two miles from Thursday’s attack.\nThis is a developing story.

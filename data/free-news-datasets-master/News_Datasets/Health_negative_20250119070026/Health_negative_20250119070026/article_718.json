    "text": "The Australian Medical Association has welcomed the development of a National Sexually Transmissible Infections Strategy, but says not enough is being done to tackle rising rates of sexually transmissible infections in vulnerable communities and help eliminate congenital syphilis.\nThe call is part of the [AMA's submission](https://www.ama.com.au/articles/ama-submission-draft-fifth-national-sti-strategy) to the Department of Health and Aged Care consultation on the [Fifth National Sexually Transmissible Infections Strategy 2024–2030](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/fifth-national-sexually-transmissible-infections-strategy-2024-2030?language=en#:~:text=Home-,Fifth%20National%20Sexually%20Transmissible%20Infections%20Strategy%202024%E2%80%932030,infections%20(STI)%20in%20Australia.) .\nAMA President Dr Danielle McMullen said the strategy will help combat stigma associated with sexually transmissible infections across Australia, but the current rise in congenital syphilis cases, disproportionately affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, was of \"grave concern\" with stillbirths and infant deaths occurring as a result of infection.\nCongenital syphilis — where the syphilis infection is passed from mother to child during pregnancy — is entirely preventable if women have ongoing access to antenatal care. Prevention could be further enhanced by a community-wide STI awareness, prevention and treatment campaign.\n\"This is a public health crisis which is disproportionately affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and urgent action is needed,\" Dr McMullen said.\n\"The death of a baby is always a tragedy, but the death of a baby from a preventable illness is a national shame.\n\"We know the most effective way of tackling this rise in syphilis and other STIs is to properly resource culturally safe healthcare services and organisations and to expand and champion the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workforce, particularly in antenatal care and women's health.\"\nThe AMA has also urged the government to recognise and support the sexual health needs of older Australians, including those in aged care, through policies and programs that include targeted sexual and reproductive health education, health promotion, and prevention strategies.\nDr McMullen said many older Australians remain sexually active, yet most educational campaigns designed to prevent sexually transmitted diseases target younger generations.\n\"Older Australians are often overlooked when it comes to sexual and reproductive health policies and research, but the prevalence of STIs among older Australian women is also increasing,\" Dr McMullen said.\n\"Programs to address STI rates in older people need to be underpinned by ongoing research and the provision of information and education to health and aged care service providers. This must include strategies to promote the sexual health of older people and ensure services are inclusive.\n\"We also have to address the shame and stigma so often attached to STIs, so people feel comfortable seeking the healthcare they need.\"\n[here](https://www.miragenews.com/urgent-action-required-as-sti-rates-soar-in-1382909/).",

    "text": "It looks like Lara Spencer will be spending some time off her feet — literally.\nThe Good Morning America star is usually on the go when it comes to her busy work life. But ahead of the holiday season, Lara gave a surprise update about her health that left her followers stunned. She went [on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DDdVh04RfB-/) to share that she'd recently underwent two operations at the Hospital for Special Surgery, due to injuries she'd gotten on both of her feet. What's more, as she posted photos with surgeon Dr. Martin O'Malley and showing off her bandaged feet, she delved a bit into what prompted her to go for the procedures in the first place.\n\"If I look a little groggy it's thanks to this guy who just gave me a new pair of boots,\" she joked in the caption on December 11. \"My right foot was easy — just had plate removed from surgery last year. The left is a bigger deal from a very old college diving injury. I was doing a reverse one and a half and hit the board, shattering toes and joints. Back then they said there was nothing you could do except tape it, let it heal, and live with the pain. Today there are much better options, thanks to surgeons like Dr. Marty O'Malley at HSS. These boots were made for walkin ... \"\nWhen Lara's followers learned what happened, they immediately rallied around to wish her the best in her recovery.\n\"Oh my @lara.spencer I hope you heal up fast and pain free ❤️,\" one person wrote in the comments. \"Ouchhhhh! Speedy recovery! 💕💕💕💕💕💕,\" another replied. \"Ouch Lara!! Feel better ❤️ didn’t know this about your feet 🦶. 🙏 🙏 for you,\" a different follower added.\nGiven how Lara can't necessarily be on her feet right now, folks shouldn't expect her to make an appearance on GMA any time soon. But when fellow co-anchor George Stephanopoulos called in on the air on December 13 to check in on her, she gave an update on how she's been feeling.\n\"Yes, just kicking back, you know, relaxing. The uzhe,\" she said on the air, per [People](https://people.com/good-morning-america-lara-spencer-double-foot-surgery-8760985). \"Ah, yes, I feel fine. Thank you, George, for asking. All is well.\"\nLara [attended Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/news/arts-and-entertainment/story/good-morning-penn-state-alumni-association-chapter-connects-lara) on an athletic scholarship for springboard and platform diving. She later graduated with a degree in broadcast journalism and was named an All American Athlete in her senior year.\nWe're sending Lara well wishes for a speedy recovery!\n[Good Housekeeping US](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a63202009/gma-2024-lara-spencer-foot-surgery-health-instagram/)\n[Adrianna Freedman](/author/245093/adrianna-freedman/)\nAs the entertainment and news editorial assistant for Good Housekeeping, Adrianna (she/her) writes about everything TV, movies, music and pop culture.

    "text": "Study: Biased language in handoffs may negatively affect care\nWhen clinicians [hear](https://www.newswise.com/articles/biased-language-in-clinical-handoffs-may-negatively-impact-patient-care) patients described with negatively biased language, they are less likely to recall critical health details, which can influence the care received, a [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2828116) found. Published in JAMA Network Open, the study consisted of a survey-based experiment in which each clinician heard short, recorded handoffs. The researchers created two versions for each handoff scenario: a neutral one stating the patient’s situation and needs, and a biased one expressing a negative stereotype, blame or doubt about the patient’s credibility. After listening to each handoff, participants answered a question testing their recall of key details. The authors say standardizing handoffs ─ permitting only neutral, medically relevant facts ─ are needed to prevent bias. Such a policy could benefit Black patients, who disproportionately experience medical errors.

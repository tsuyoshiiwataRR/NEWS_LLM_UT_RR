    "text": "Claim: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was a heroin addict from his teenage years into adulthood. Rating: True About this rating\nIn late 2024, many people scrutinized Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s past after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump nominated him to be health secretary. Kennedy, who was an independent presidential candidate in 2024, has had a colorful history and controversial views.\nSnopes readers inquired about Kennedy's history with heroin as numerous X posts claimed he was a former addict.\n(X user @RonFilipkowski)\nKennedy was indeed a heroin addict beginning as a teenager, based on his own admissions in numerous interviews. As such, this claim is true.\nOn June 17, 2024, Kennedy appeared on the \"Shawn Ryan Show,\" a podcast hosted by a former Navy SEAL. Kennedy spoke at length about how his heroin addiction helped him in his school studies:\nI'll tell you something about heroin for me. I did very very poorly in school, until I started doing narcotics. Then I went to the top of my class because my mind was so restless and turbulent and I could not sit still. […] I'd probably today be diagnosed as ADHD, I was bouncing off the walls. I couldn't sit still, I just wanted to get in the woods. […] I started doing heroin, I went to the top of my class. Suddenly I could sit still, I could read, and I could concentrate, I could listen to what people were saying, things made sense to me. […] It worked for me. And if it still worked, I'd still be doing it. […] It killed my brother, and it destroys your relationships. It hollows out your whole life. You have a one-dimensional life. I was a bundle of appetites and it was a full time job to feed them, with drugs and sex and alcohol and extreme behavior.\nHe admitted that he was \"functional\" while addicted, and while his family had an idea that something was wrong, they didn't know how \"badly off\" he was. He also was arrested on a possession charge aboard an airline flight in 1983.\nHe makes the above remarks at the 1:21:00 mark:\nAccording to a 1984 New York Times article, Kennedy pleaded guilty to a felony charge of possessing heroin. His lawyer at the time said he was traveling to South Dakota ''for treatment, realizing he had a problem'' with drugs. Kennedy admitted himself to a drug treatment center in New Jersey just days after the arrest.\nKennedy's addiction lasted 14 years, by his own admission , and he started using heroin when he was 15, according to this 2023 interview :\nIn a 2004 profile of Kennedy by Outside magazine, he was described as the \"alpha male\" of his generation of Kennedys, who consumed more drugs than his brothers and cousins and often led them into using heroin, while keeping up his grades.\nIn the book \" The Kennedys: An American Drama \" by David Horowitz and Peter Collier — a well-regarded biographer of prominent dynastic families — Kennedy (referred to below as \"Bobby\") was frequently using heroin in the company of other boys in his family, including his cousin Chris Lawford:\nJennifer [a singer who briefly dated Lawford] saw immediately that Chris and Bobby were addicts—not mainlining heroin addicts, perhaps, although heroin was the summa drug for them—but addicted to narcotics in general: \"Christopher and Bobby liked heroin. But they'd settle for a cupful of Valium, some Percodans, or whatever else was there. Drugs were obsessive. There was a desperate need to escape.\" […] Chris tried to keep up with Bobby but he couldn't. He became more and more dependent on heroin, less and less able to \"handle it.\"\nIn late 2024, Kennedy has been trying to convince senators on Capitol Hill that he is the right choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, even though he has never worked in health care or the federal government. He is most well-known for his anti-vaccination views and for spreading misinformation around vaccines.",

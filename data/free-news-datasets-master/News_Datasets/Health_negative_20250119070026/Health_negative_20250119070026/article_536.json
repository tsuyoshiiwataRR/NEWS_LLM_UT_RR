    "text": "2 weeks ago\nWe have 3 of these throughout our house and one of them (the same one)… randomly goes off, stating fire in the house. It’s not near steam, it’s been cleaned… it just randomly does it. How do I determine if it’s just a faulty product?\nthank you.\na week ago\nHi Kamarantes,\nThank you for posting in the community! I’m sorry to hear that your Nest Protect randomly goes off. No worries. I'd be happy to help.\nTo better assist you, I’d like to ask the following questions:\nTo further assist in diagnosing the situation, I can suggest a safety checkup on your Nest Protect. You can find detailed instructions by checking this article: Learn about Safety Checkup.\nAfter completing the safety checkup, please let me know the following:\nAny additional details you can provide will be helpful.\nBest regards,\nDaniel\nyesterday\nDaniel-I would also appreciate help with this. We have 2 randomly going off and need replacing.\n5 hours ago\nHey DCMath,\nThank you so much for sharing your concerns with me. I understand that you’re facing the same situation with your smoke alarms randomly going off. Let me assist you with further information; it’s a pleasure.\nI appreciate that you have taken action by performing the troubleshooting steps above. I can suggest another step, so try to do a factory reset. For your reference, follow this article: Reset Nest Protect and erase all settings. Then if the situation persists, the team would like to learn more about this behavior. When you get a chance, please fill out this form and let us know when you’re finished. We’ll have someone reach out to you via email from there.\nBest regards,\nDaniel\n2 hours ago\nDaniel - I have filled out the form after doing the factory reset. And we are still having the same issues,\n30m ago\nHello DCMath,\nWe have received the information correctly. Stay tuned; a member of our support team will be in touch over email to help.\nRegards,\nDaniel\n35m ago\nI have 6 protect for about 4 years now. (3 of them have been replaces, 2 under warranty, one went to the bin)\nI had a smoke alarm in the middle of the night again!! its a bug, just a bug, nothing shows up in the logs.\nThe only thing a can conclude is that this message is played together with the BATTERY check.\nI was looking for another brand but fortunantly. the protect is the most capable sensor, slow burning detection, co detection, temperature increase fire detection, night light.\nSo after all, i stick to the protects, BUT i really miss the api to send commands to the rollers to open so we could escape in case of real danger. It would be stupid to have 2 alarms in the only escape way to have one that could send the emergency signal to our home automation system.\nMaybe this all has a bit more side info but in my opinion this really could be a battery check that triggers emergency notifications. The 3 nests that where bought in the same box where a nighmare. 3 fire alarms when not home and 6 false battery check smoke notifications at night.\nAnd then, last but not least... fire is a emergency notification. When i am not at home and one my doors are opening my android receives a notification by using pushover. There i can choose to use the emergency channel for the sound, bypassing the device volume and do not disturb setting. Very handy!\nWhy is google nest not using the google android emergency channel for fire or smoke push message trough the emergency channel?\nWhy not fix these issues and make more people buy these?\nyesterday\nI have the same issue and have previously written about this in another thread that was closed. Can you help me with this too? Except we have 2 nest protects randomly going off after being thoroughly cleaned and batteries replaced.",

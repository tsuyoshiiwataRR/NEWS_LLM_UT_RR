    "text": "An outbreak of salmonella poisoning linked to recalled cucumbers has spread, sickening 32 more people and sending another seven to the hospital in 23 states.\nThe CDCs update bringing the total number of illnesses from 68 last month to 100 currently, and hospitalizations from 18 to 25. The agency also highlighted a dozen companies that grew, distributed or sold contaminated cucumbers.\nThe products were shipped to many states, including California, Arizona, Texas, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Colorado, Kansas, New York, Massachusetts, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Alaska and Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.\nSalmonella causes a potentially serious bacterial infection called salmonellosis, which causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and sometimes bloody stools.\nMany people with salmonellosis also develop a fever, which can become severe and require hospitalization. Severe GI complaints can lead to dehydration.\nThe CDC estimates that salmonella bacteria cause approximately 1.35 million infections, more than 26,000 hospitalizations and 420 deaths annually.\nThe affected cucumbers were sold between October 12 and November 15. No deaths have been reported in connection with the recall.\nCucumbers from SunFed, LLC (shown here) have been recalled from retailers in 26 states, the FDA said. The company is one of about a dozen whose products have been recalled over salmonella concerns\nIf you have purchased affected products, the FDA recommends throwing them away and cleaning counters where products may come into contact to prevent cross-contamination.\nBacteria infiltrate food that has been exposed to animal feces. When people ingest that food, the bacteria travel through the stomach to the small intestine. Once there, it begins to destroy the cells lining the intestinal walls.\nThe body launches an all-out immune attack against the pathogens, activating deadly cells to find and destroy diseased cells.\nHowever, this also causes inflammation, as the body increases blood flow to the site of infection to bring more immune cells to the area. This can lead to diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever and sometimes vomiting.\nThe CDC said, “The actual number of sick people in this outbreak is likely much higher than the reported number, and the outbreak may not be limited to states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for Salmonella.’\nRecent illnesses may not have been reported yet because it typically takes three to four weeks to determine whether a sick person is part of an outbreak.\nThe median age of patients is 27 years and the majority are women: 63 percent versus 37 percent.\nThe vast majority, 85 percent, are white.\nThe CDC added: “State and local public health officials interview people about the foods they ate in the week before they became ill. Of the 67 people interviewed, 54 (81%) reported that they ate or were likely to eat cucumbers.”\nThe CDC and state agencies identified seven clusters of illnesses linked to three assisted living facilities, three school districts and one restaurant.\nThe CDC estimates that salmonella bacteria cause approximately 1.35 million infections, more than 26,000 hospitalizations and 420 deaths annually\nThese clusters consist of unrelated individuals who dined at the same location or attended the same event, such as a restaurant, school, or healthcare facility. Cucumbers were served at all seven locations.\nThe FDA warns not to consume affected products. If you are unsure whether a product has been recalled, please contact the store where you purchased the product.\nThe agency also recommends cleaning surfaces that may have come into contact with the cucumbers to prevent cross-contamination.",

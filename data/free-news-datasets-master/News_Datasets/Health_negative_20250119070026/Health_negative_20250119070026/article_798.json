COLLEGE PARK, Ga. - The parents of Amanda \"Mandy\" Sylvester, a 15-year-old who collapsed during volleyball practice and later died, have hired prominent civil rights and personal injury attorney Ben Crump to investigate the circumstances surrounding their daughter’s death.\nAnthony and Barbara Sylvester stood alongside Crump at a press conference Thursday, demanding accountability and seeking to prevent similar tragedies.\nAmanda \"Mandy\" Sylvester (Supplied)\nWhat happened to Mandy Sylvester? \"We waited... we waited... we waited,\" said Barbara Sylvester, recalling the moments after her daughter collapsed on Dec. 5 at the Tracey Wyatt Recreation Center. Bystanders called 911, but an ambulance from Grady EMS did not arrive until nearly an hour later.\nAccording to Grady Health System, the initial emergency call was categorized as low acuity, meaning Mandy’s condition was not considered life-threatening. A second 911 call prompted an upgrade to high acuity, but by then, Mandy’s mother had already rushed her to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Hughes Spaulding Hospital.\n\"All I could think is if I could just get her to the doctor, she’d be okay,\" said Barbara Sylvester.\nFULL VIDEO: Mother speaks about volleyball player death Family and attorney of 15 year old Amanda Sylvester hold news conference Thursday afternoon after teen dies during practice.\nMandy arrived at the hospital at 7:20 p.m. Doctors revived her heart after it stopped once, but she was pronounced dead at 8:40 p.m.\nMandy, who lived with Type 1 diabetes, was wearing a monitor linked to her mother’s phone.

Had someone done something,\" he said.\nCrump, known for representing families in high-profile cases, emphasized the failures he believes occurred that night. \"For an ambulance not to show up for almost an hour, that is horrifying to every parent,\" Crump said.\nFULL VIDEO: Father speaks about volleyball player death Family and attorney of 15 year old Amanda Sylvester hold news conference Thursday afternoon after teen dies during practice.\nHe also criticized emergency response protocols. \"Whether it’s Grady Hospital EMS or College Park Fire and Rescue, there were mistakes made from the very start.

    "text": "The Cavaliers will be without Isaac Okoro, the team’s best defensive player, when they host the Milwaukee Bucks on Dec. 20 at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.\nOkoro sustained a right shoulder injury Dec. 16 in the game with the Nets in Brooklyn. An MRI performed Dec. 18 at Cleveland Clinic confirmed a sprain that will keep him sidelined at least two weeks, the team announced. By that timetable he will miss six games and possibly more.\n“Okoro will be re-evaluated in approximately two weeks, following a series of treatment and rehabilitation,” The Cavs said in a news release. “His status and return to basketball activities will be updated as appropriate.”\nThe Cavs host the 76ers on Dec. 21 and the Jazz on Dec. 23 and then head west for three games. They play the Nuggets in Denver on Dec. 27, the Warriors in San Francisco on Dec. 30 and the Lakers in Los Angeles on New Year’s Eve.\nOkoro has played in 23 games with 16 starts for the 23-4 Cavaliers. He is averaging 6.6 points and 21 minutes a game, but more importantly, he is usually tasked with guarding the opponent’s best shooter.\nFortunately for the Cavs, Max Strus is expected to make his 2024-25 debut against the Bucks after missing the first 27 games with an ankle injury.\nThe Bucks started slowly, but have emerged as one of the hottest teams in the NBA. They beat the Oklahoma City Thunder on Dec. 17 in Las Vegas to win the NBA Cup. The Bucks, 14-11, have won three straight and eight of their last 10 games.\nThe Cavs have the best record in the NBA. They are 14-1 at the FieldHouse. Their only home loss was to the Atlanta Hawks, 135-124, on Nov. 27.\nBucks at Cavaliers When: 7:30 p.m., Dec. 20\nWhere: Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse\nRecords: Bucks 14-11, Cavaliers 23-4\nTV: FanDuel Sports Ohio",

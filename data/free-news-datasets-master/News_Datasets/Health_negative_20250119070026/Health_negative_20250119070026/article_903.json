The bags of chips affected by recall were distributed to some retail stores and e-commerce distributors in Oregon and Washington, and were available for sale beginning Nov. 3, 2024.\n\"Those with an allergy or severe sensitivity to milk run the risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume the recalled product,\" the FDA said in the recall notice posted Thursday.\nNo allergic reactions related to the recall have been reported, according to the notice. Additionally, no other Lay's products, flavors, sizes or variety packs are affected.\nFrito-Lay is recalling a limited number of 13 oz. bags of Lay's Classic Potato Chips after being alerted by a consumer contact that the product may contain undeclared milk. FDA The recalled chips include Lay's Classic Potato Chips, in flexible 13 oz. (368.5 grams) bags with UPC code 28400 31041, a \"Guaranteed Fresh\" date of 11 Feb 2025, and one of either two manufacturing codes: 6462307xx or 6463307xx.\nGeneral guidelines from the FDA advise consumers who have purchased any recalled food to dispose of the product or return it to the retailer for a full refund.\nIn a similar event, Costco in October recalled nearly 80,000 pounds of store-brand butter because the key ingredient, milk, was missing from the product's label.\nMore from CBS News Aryan Brotherhood members get consecutive life terms for murder, racketeering Man goes missing from San Leandro mental health treatment center, believed to be at-risk Nikki Fortuato Bas sworn in as interim Oakland mayor after Sheng Thao recall Threat shuts down SF State campus; students advised to shelter in place California Amazon workers to join national Teamsters strike In: Product Recall Anne Marie Lee Anne Marie D.

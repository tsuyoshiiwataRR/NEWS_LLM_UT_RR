He now must use a cane to walk.\nSix months before putting the drumsticks down for good, the “In the Air Tonight” singer lamented that his stamina was declining.\n6 Collins, seen here in 1985, explained of his retirement, “If I can’t do what I did as well as I did it, I’d rather relax and not do anything.” Redferns 6 The Grammy winner, seen here in 1997, also suffers from drop foot.

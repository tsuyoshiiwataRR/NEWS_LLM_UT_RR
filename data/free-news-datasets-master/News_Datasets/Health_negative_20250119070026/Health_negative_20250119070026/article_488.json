    "text": "“The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” alum Brandi Glanville opened up about her year-long health battle in December 2024, telling Entertainment Tonight in an interview that she suspects she may have a face parasite. Dr. Terry Dubrow from “The Real Housewives of Orange County” then chimed in on Glanville’s health issues , telling TMZ he thinks it is not a parasite but rather an “infectious process or a foreign body reaction to something she’s had injected.”\nNow Glanville is sharing more about her efforts to identify and remedy her mystery illness in a December 19 interview with Page Six’s “Virtual Reali-Tea” podcast .\n“I don’t f***ing know. We don’t know,” Glanville answered when asked if she still thinks she has a face parasite as she initially claimed. She went on to share that she is so desperate for answers that, “You could do anything you want to me, and I’d be OK with it. I’ve had days of looking normal, not weeks. I wish. But it comes and goes.\n“The pain is more mental than anything, because I have been hiding and going through a deep, deep depression. Even if I could work now, at this point, I couldn’t. So it’s just been a really rough two years for me,” Glanville added.",

    "text": "Delaware County teen convicted of role in 2 fatal fentanyl overdoses\nMUNCIE, Ind. â€” A young Delaware County man on Thursday was found guilty of felony charges stemming from the overdose deaths of two local teenagers.\nA Delaware Circuit Court 1 jury found Jaxon W. Engle, 18, of Albany, guilty of dealing in a controlled substance resulting in death; aiding, inducing or causing dealing in a controlled substance resulting in death; and conspiracy to commit dealing in a narcotic drug.\nThe two most serious charges are Level 1 felonies carrying up to 40 years in prison. Judge Judi Calhoun set sentencing for Jan. 14.\nIn his closing remarks to jurors on Thursday afternoon, Chief Deputy Prosecutor Zach Craig maintained there was clear evidence that Engle was a player in events that saw 18-year-old Javin Nichols die after ingesting a fentanyl pill in July 2023.\nTwo months later, Craig said, Engle sold one of the \"blue M30\" fentanyl pills to 17-year-old Kamron Lacy, who later died after overdosing.\nCraig said Engle and accomplices showed \"a willingness to prey on the bad decisions made by those young men.\"\n\"They were doing it to make money,\" Craig said.\nCo-defendant Ricky Taylor, 25, in July was sentenced to 41 years in prison after another jury found him guilty of involvement in supplying the fentanyl leading to one of the deaths.\nEvidence presented during Engle's trial by Craig and deputy prosecutor Diane Frye included dozens of texts exchanged by Engle and Taylor, described as the chief supplier of the fentanyl pills.\nEngle was represented by attorney Ron Smith.\nIn June, Engle pleaded guilty in Blackford Circuit Court to conspiracy to commit dealing in meth.\nHe had been accused of conspiring with his father to smuggle meth to his brother, who at the time was being held in the Blackford County Jail.\nAfter Thursday's verdicts were announced, Delaware County Prosecutor Eric Hoffman noted his office had to date obtained 14 dealing-resulting-in-death convictions.\n\"The days of drug dealers preying on the weak and vulnerable are long gone,\" the prosecutor said.\nDouglas Walker is a news reporter at The Star Press.

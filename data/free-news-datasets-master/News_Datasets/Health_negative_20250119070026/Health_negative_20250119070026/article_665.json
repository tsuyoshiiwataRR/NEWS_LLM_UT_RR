    "text": "Wild place Yakov Trenin on injured reserve with upper-body injury\nThe [Minnesota Wild](/teams/minnesota-wild/line-combinations) made a couple of roster moves on Thursday.\nThe team placed forward Yakov Trenin on injured reserve with an upper-body injury. The Wild also assigned forward Devin Shore to their American Hockey League affiliate, the Iowa Wild.\nThe #mnwild has placed forward Yakov Trenin on Injured Reserve (upper body) and reassigned forward Devin Shore to the @IAWild.\nDecember 19, 2024\nTrenin had been listed as day-to-day with ailment, having missed the team’s last three games due to the injury. He was last in the lineup seven days ago when Minnesota fell to the Edmonton Oilers, 7-1. Since then, the Wild have fallen to the [Vegas Golden Knights](/teams/vegas-golden-knights/line-combinations) and [Florida Panthers](/teams/florida-panthers/line-combinations), though they beat the [Philadelphia Flyers](/teams/philadelphia-flyers/line-combinations) last Saturday.\nPer the league’s IR rules, Trenin could technically return to the lineup on Friday night when the Wild hosts the [Utah Hockey Club](/teams/utah-hockey-club/line-combinations), though there is no inclination that will come to fruition. Across the first five seasons of his NHL career, the Russian center has never played a full 82-game season. The closest Trenin came was in 2021-22 when he appeared in 80 games with the [Nashville Predators](/teams/nashville-predators/line-combinations).\nOffensively, Trenin has been off to a slow start compared to the last couple of years. In 29 games, he has just two goals and an assist for three points, a little off the pace that led to him notching 17 points with the Predators and [Colorado Avalanche](/teams/colorado-avalanche/line-combinations) during the 2023-24 campaign.\nThe 27-year-old arrived in the Twin Cities this past summer after signing a [four-year contract](/news/wild-sign-yakov-trenin-to-four-year-3-5m-aav-contract), which carries an AAV of $3.5 million through the 2027-28 season.\nShore was placed on waivers on Tuesday and cleared on Wednesday. Per Michael Russo from The Athletic, with Trenin going on IR, there is a chance that Shore can be recalled to Minnesota to fill the roster spot.\nThe Wild (20-8-4) are second in the Central Division, three points behind the best team in the NHL, the [Winnipeg Jets](/teams/winnipeg-jets/line-combinations).",

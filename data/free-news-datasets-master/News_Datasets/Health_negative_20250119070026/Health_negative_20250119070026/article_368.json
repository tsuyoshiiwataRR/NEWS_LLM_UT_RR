    "text": "Phil Collins gave fans a rare update about his ailing health in his newly released documentary, “Phil Collins: Drummer First.”\nThe health update comes a full two years after the legendary star retired from drumming. The documentary was released Dec. 18 and takes a deep dive into Collins’ current health condition . He spoke of his inability to continue doing what he’s most passionate about — playing the drums.\n“It’s still kind of sinking in a bit,” he admitted in an interview segment filmed in October 2022. “I’ve spent all my life playing drums. To suddenly not be able to do that is a shock,” Collins said.\nThe 73-year-old singer and musician said he had been playing drums since the age of 5. After several decades, “the drumming has taken its toll on my hands, legs,” he said.\n“If I can’t do what I did as well as I did it, I’d rather relax and not do anything,” Collins said.\nBERLIN, GERMANY – MARCH 07: British singer and drummer Phil Collins of the band Genesis performs live on stage during a concert at Mercedes Benz Arena on March 7, 2022 in Berlin, Germany.

But I just feel like I’ve used up my air miles,” he said.\nCollin’s son Nic spoke about the impact that the Genesis star’s career has had on the drummer’s body . He admitted his father had devoted his life to his music and was now paying the consequences through the toll it took on his physical health.\n“Musicians, people in bands in general had this thought that they were invincible,” Nic said in the documentary.\n“I think that’s really what it is with my dad is just this kind of sense of you’re a drummer, you’re invincible, you do what you do. But you don’t know it’s gonna take a toll in the long run.”\nNic followed in his father’s footsteps by also becoming a drummer. He noted that his father had a “big surgery on his neck [in 2015] that stemmed from all those years playing drums and bad posture.”\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Phil Collins (@officialphilcollins)\nCollins also suffers from drop-foot, where one of his feet has no sensation and requires the use of a cane to walk.

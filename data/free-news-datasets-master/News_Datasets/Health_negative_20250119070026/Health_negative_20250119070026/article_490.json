    "text": "Aniah’s Law hearing postponed for man accused of aggravated abuse of 11-month-old child\nBAY MINETTE, Ala. ([WALA](https://www.fox10tv.com/)) - A Robertsdale man accused of aggravated child abuse against an 11-month-old child was scheduled to appear in court Thursday, December 19, 2024. During his official bond appearance Monday, prosecutors asked that he be held on no bond until an Aniah’s Law hearing could take place.\nThat hearing which also serves as a bond hearing didn’t happen Thursday because of witness unavailability. Prosecutors did explain how Aniah’s Law applies in this case.\nRobertsdale Police got a call Saturday, December 14, 2024 after Escambia County, FL investigators were notified of an 11-month-old girl who had been brought to Sacred Heart Hospital with severe injuries. Once deputies there learned those injuries occurred in Baldwin County, Robertsdale PD took over the case. Police there said the child was in the care of 20-year-old Michael Mullen when the alleged abuse happened. Investigators said the abuse appears to be of a sexual nature and more charges could come.\n“Aggravated abuse of a child under the age of six is a Class A felony and so, under the facts of…as the investigation goes on, we think it’s very possible other Class A felonies would be added but we’re waiting until we get the results of DNA and medical records before we make any decisions,” said Assistant District Attorney for Baldwin County, Kristi Hagood.\nThe Baldwin County DA’s Office said the nature of this crime should allow them to hold Mullen without bond, pursuant to Aniah’s Law until trial.\n“In this case, aggravated child abuse is one of those requirements. It involves a child under the age of six as are sodomy in the first degree, rape in the first degree and sexual torture. All class A felonies,” Hagood explained.\nHagood said the child is still receiving medical care for her injuries, six days later.\nMichael Mullen will be held in the Baldwin County Jail on no bond until that Aniah’s Law hearing can be heard and it’s been rescheduled for January 2, 2025.\nProsecutors say Michael Mullen can legally be held without a bond hearing until January 2nd because of a defense continuance for “good cause shown,” meaning the upcoming holiday schedule, availability of attorneys, witnesses and other court personnel won’t allow for it to happen sooner.\nCopyright 2024 WALA.

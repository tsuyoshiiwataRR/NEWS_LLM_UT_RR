    "text": "CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (WVIR) - The number of people receiving the flu vaccine has decreased slightly this year compared to last.\nAs of December 7, the number of vaccinated children between six months old to 17 years old, has decreased from 51.5% last year to around 48.7% this year.\nOnly 14.7% of people aged 18 to 30 have received the flu vaccine.\nThe Virginia Department of Health says these numbers are only preliminary, and it does not know what is causing the decline.\n“We are seeing a decrease but again it’s not a cause for alarm as of right now, but we are continuing to watch trends,” said Erica Hunter, the Immunization Data and Outreach Manager at the Department.\nHunter reminds people that there is one more walk-in flu clinic at the Charlottesville-Albemarle Health Department on Monday, December 23.\nDo you have a story idea?

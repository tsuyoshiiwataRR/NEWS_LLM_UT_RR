    "text": "MANILA, Philippines — The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) yesterday said a shellfish ban is in effect in seven areas in the country amid the presence of toxic red tide.\nAccording to BFAR, the ban is imposed in Dumanquillas Bay in Zamboanga del Sur, the coastal waters of Daram Island, Zumarraga Island and Irong-Irong Bay in Samar, Matarinao Bay in Eastern Samar, the coastal waters of Tungawan in Zamboanga Sibugay and the coastal waters of Biliran Islands in Biliran.\n“Shellfishes collected and tested from (these areas) are still positive for paralytic shellfish poison or toxic red tide that is beyond the regulatory limit,” BFAR said.\nIt added that all types of shellfish and Acetes sp. or alamang gathered from the affected areas are not safe for human consumption.\nHowever, BFAR said that fish, squids, shrimps and crabs are safe for human consumption provided these are fresh, washed thoroughly and the internal organs, such as gills and intestines, are removed before cooking.\nOfficials said a toxic red tide is a natural phenomenon, adding that consuming shellfish affected by red tide could lead to numbness, drowsiness and respiratory paralysis.",

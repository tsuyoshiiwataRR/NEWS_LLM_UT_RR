    "text": "Bird flu (H5N1) continues to spark warnings around the country.\nOn Dec. 13, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the country’s first severe case of bird flu in a human.\nThe patient, who lives in southwestern Louisiana, is currently hospitalized, according to a release from the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH).\nBIRD FLU SURGES IN SEVERAL US STATES WITH REPORTS OF NEW OUTBREAKS: 'GETTING WORSE'\nThe infected person is known to have been exposed to sick and dead birds that are \"suspected to have been infected,\" the same source stated.\nThe LDH is working with the CDC on genomic testing of the virus infecting the hospitalized patient. Fox News Digital reached out to the department for comment.\nThere have been a total of 61 human cases throughout the country since April 2024.\nNo human-to-human transmission has been reported, leading the CDC to maintain its stance that risk to the public is low.\nGOVERNOR NEWSOM DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO BIRD FLU\nDespite the low risk, California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday declared a state of emergency due to the bird flu.\nThe declaration follows an outbreak of the virus among dairy cows in Southern California farms, according to the news release on the governor’s website.\n\"This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\"Building on California’s testing and monitoring system — the largest in the nation — we are committed to further protecting public health , supporting our agricultural industry, and ensuring that Californians have access to accurate, up-to-date information,\" he continued.\n\"While the risk to the public remains low, we will continue to take all necessary steps to prevent the spread of this virus.\"\nSam Scarpino, PhD, director of AI and life sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, said the \"tragic case\" in Louisiana is evidence of the \"widespread nature\" of H5N1 in the U.S.\n\"It also reinforces the very serious situation we are facing,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\"We need to take more decisive action to control the spread of H5N1 in animal populations. Until then, we will continue to see human spillover cases, and some of them will unfortunately be severe.\"\nMore from this section +3 Verdicts awaited in rape trial that shocked France",

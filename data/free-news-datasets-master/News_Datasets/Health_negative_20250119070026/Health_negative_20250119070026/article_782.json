    "text": "Hide Caption\nFirst severe case of bird flu reported Just days after the CDC reassured people that the risk of contracting bird flu remains low among humans, the agency reported the first case of severe illness caused by an infection in the United States. Fox - 5 Atlanta The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed the first case of \"severe\" avian influenza , commonly known as bird flu , less than a month after a child in California was diagnosed with the virus.\nOn Friday, the CDC confirmed a person from Louisiana had avian influenza A virus, H5N1 , after they were exposed to sick and dead birds in a backyard flock, according to a CDC press release. The patient was hospitalized, marking the first \"severe\" human case in the United States.\"While an investigation into the source of the infection in Louisiana is ongoing, it has been determined that the patient had exposure to sick and dead birds in backyard flocks,\" the CDC said in a statement. \"This is the first case of H5N1 bird flu in the U.S. that has been linked to exposure to a backyard flock.\"The confirmation comes weeks after the first case of bird flu was found in a child in California . This year, 61 people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu, according to the CDC.\nWhat is bird flu? Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is a virus that can sometimes spread from infected animals, like birds and cows, to humans, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Around 123 million poultry have been affected since 2022 in all 50 states.\nSince Match 2024, over 700 herds of dairy cows have also been affected in 16 states.Two big cats and three large birds âˆ’ a cheetah, a mountain lion, a swamphen, a kookaburra and an Indian goose - from the Wildlife World Zoo and Aquarium, 20 miles west of Phoenix, died, and others were infected after being exposed to the bird flu, according to USA TODAY's previous reporting.\nMaricopa County Department of Public Health officials transported the sick animals to the Arizona Department of Agriculture for testing which later indicated they were likely exposed to avian influenza.\nWho is most at risk? People who are most at risk of being infected by bird flu are those who work with poultry, waterfowl and dairy cows, according to Cleveland Clinic . However, it is rare for the infection to spread from person to person.While cases of bird flu in humans have been reported, the risk to the general public remains low, according to the CDC.A person can be infected with the virus if they touch an object that has been contaminated and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth, according to the CDC . The virus can also be spread through the handling of live and dead animals that are infected.It can also be spread through eating, drinking or inhaling anything that contains the live virus like raw, unpasteurized milk.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nThe symptoms of those who have been infected with bird flu can range in severity, according to the CDC, from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease resulting in death.The following are symptoms of bird flu, according to the Cleveland Clinic and CDC:To avoid becoming sick with avian influenza, the CDC recommends the following: Julia is a trending reporter for USA TODAY.

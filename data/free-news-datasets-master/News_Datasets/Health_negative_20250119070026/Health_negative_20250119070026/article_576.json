    "text": "PERRYSBURG, Ohio â€” A landmark silo in Perrysburg has been demolished due to safety concerns, officials announced this week.\nThe silo, stood at the intersection of Oregon Road and Biniker Drive since the 1880s. Originally a part of the nearby Biniker farm, it was purchased by [Owens Community College](/article/news/local/owens-community-college-early-childhood-forum-mental-health/512-a91e8987-7216-40fd-aefb-f44580c7595e) in the 1990s. Owens transformed the property into an educational complex that includes key facilities like the Engineering Technology, Math and Science buildings, the Healthcare Education Center and the Center for Fine and Performing Arts.\nDr. Dione Somerville, president of Owens Community College, explained that while the silo had historical significance, its deteriorating condition made it unsafe. \"If it were a sound structure and old, we would have kept it, but because of the safety concerns, we had to dismantle it,\" Somerville said.\n\"For us, it allowed us to expand as a campus,\" Somerville added. \"These purchases from the Biniker family made possible many of the programs that now serve our students.\"\nAs Owens Community College approaches its 60th anniversary, Somerville said the decision to demolish the silo was part of a broader effort to evaluate and update the campus to meet the needs of modern learners. \"We continue to evolve with the needs of our students, ensuring that our physical space supports their education and future success,\" she said.\nThough the silo is gone, its legacy will live on in photographs and memories. \"The silo was a symbol of growth and expansion,\" said Somerville. \"It will continue to inspire our students as they prepare for careers in business, industry and workforce development throughout Northwest Ohio.\"",

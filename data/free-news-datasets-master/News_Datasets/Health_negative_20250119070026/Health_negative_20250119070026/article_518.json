    "text": "WROC Rochester Flu declared ‘prevalent’ in NYS: where do cases stand locally? Natalie Kucko Thu, December 19, 2024 at 10:38 PM UTC 1 min read\nROCHESTER, N.Y. (WROC) – With respiratory viruses spreading ahead of the holidays, the State Department of Health is declaring the flu ‘prevalent’ across New York State. Officials are asking families to take precaution.\nFrom the end of November through the first week of December, COVID, RSV, and flu cases in Monroe County have all about doubled.\nThat’s according to local data, however, UR Medicine specialists say what they are seeing now is not as much as last year at this time or the year before.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Across the state, recent data shows more than 23,000 positive cases across 60 counties and nearly 400 hospitalizations.\nCompared to one week ago, cases went 75 percent outside of New York City. Due to the rise, certain health care workers in New York must wear a mask if they are not vaccinated.\n“Week to week, we could see the number of flu cases roughly doubling. In terms of the number of patients we have at Strong Hospital right now, the numbers are fairly small. Between flu, RSV, and COVID, altogether we have somewhere between 15 and 20 patients in the hospital. Those are not huge numbers. If you’re sick, it’s best to stay away from other people and especially stay away from people who are vulnerable like older people and those with underlying diseases, who are more susceptible to get a bad case of a virus,” said Dr. Paul Graman, an infectious disease specialist with UR Medicine.\nDoctors continue to encourage the community to get vaccinated for the flu, COVID, and RSV if eligible and to contact your primary care provider first on any concerns.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "text": "LMPD Lieutenant cites homeless woman in labor for unlawful street camping Homeless woman in labor gets cited for street camping (LMPD) By Ward Jolles Published: Dec. 19, 2024 at 5:18 PM EST | Updated: 4 hours ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - LMPD body camera video shows the shocking moment a homeless, pregnant woman is cited for street camping — while she’s seemingly in labor.\nThe video, which was obtained by WAVE News through an open records request, shows LMPD first division Lieutenant Caleb Stewart writing a homeless woman a ticket near the corner of E. Washington and Hancock Street. Upon approach, the woman tells him she needs an ambulance because she is in labor and “leaking embryotic fluid.”\nWhen the woman gets up and walks around, Stewart tells the woman to stop because she is being detained for unlawful street camping.\nEMS is called, but the woman is handed the ticket anyway while she’s waiting for the ambulance.\nIt’s not clear what happened to her once she was taken away. The citation, which was also obtained by WAVE News, makes no mention of the woman being in labor.\nAll the citation says is: “Ofc. observed listed subject camping underneath interstate bridge at listed location by utilizing camping paraphernalia (mattress, blanket, pillow as bedding). Subject has previously been warned about this statute area is not designated as a camping or sleeping area.”\nStewart seemed to doubt that the woman was in labor after writing the ticket.\n“I don’t believe for one second that this woman is going into labor,” Stewart is heard saying. “But I called EMS just in case I’m wrong. She’s pulled this kind of stuff before.”\nLieutenant Caleb Stewart, who oversees LMPD’s 1st division, wrote more than half of all of the citations written for homeless people in the first three months of the Safer Kentucky Act’s new “anti-street camping policy.” A source within LMPD tells WAVE News the Lieutenant was tasked by LMPD to enforce the law once it went into effect in mid-July.\nWAVE News requested an interview with Lt. Stewart, and was told by an LMPD spokesperson that they were “working on this request.” However, LMPD backed out of the interview Thursday morning, Dec. 19, saying “Lt Stewart doesn’t want to do any more interviews at this time.”\nThat’s despite LMPD offering a one-on-one interview with a competing station just two weeks before.\nWAVE News has reached out to both LMPD and the Mayor’s Office for comment.\n“We take any situation involving vulnerable individuals, including those experiencing a medical emergency, very seriously,” LMPD said in a statement. “No one wants to see a pregnant woman living in such deplorable conditions. On two previous occasions, members of The Safe and Healthy Streets Initiative offered the woman resources for shelter which she had declined. The Safe and Healthy Streets Initiative within the Louisville Metro includes members of the Homeless Services Division, Solid Waste Management, and LMPD. Members of this group respond together to conduct cleanings of encampments, offer services to individuals, and issue citations for violations multiple times each week. Without the officer’s intervention and call for EMS, it is possible the baby would have been born without medical care. We hope she and her baby are able to receive the care and resources they need going forward.\nWe support our officers in using discretion and the information available to them at the time in making decisions. We also understand everyone may not agree with those decisions, but we are committed to being transparent in communicating and explaining processes and policy to the community. LMPD has posted the body-worn camera footage on our YouTube channel in its entirety to include an 18-minute self-narration by the officer following this incident. \"\nKevin Trager, the Mayor’s Office Press Secretary said in a statement:\n“We are thankful LMPD called an ambulance, and the baby was born in a hospital with medical care. This is why our homeless services staff work hard to offer support and shelter to those in need. Unfortunately, there are people living on our streets who turn down these offers of help even though they desperately need them.”\nThis is a developing story.\nCopyright 2024 WAVE.

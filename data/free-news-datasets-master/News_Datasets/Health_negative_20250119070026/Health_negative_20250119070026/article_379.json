The report, which draws on data from over 70,000 students in French and English schools across Quebec, underscores alarming increases in anxiety, depression, and other disorders—issues that experts like Dr. Tina Montreuil emphasize need urgent attention.\nDr. Montreuil, an Associate Professor in Educational and Counselling Psychology at McGill University, reflected on the findings during a recent interview. “This report provides a snapshot of how mental health among teenagers has evolved over the past ten years,” she noted. While some conditions like attention deficit disorders have long been present, new phenomena, such as eco-anxiety, have emerged as significant concerns.\nStark statistics on youth mental health\nThe report paints a grim picture: professionally diagnosed anxiety disorders rose from 9 per cent in 2010–2011 to 20 per cent in 2022–2023. Depression also climbed from 4.9 per cent to 7 per cent, and eating disorders showed the most dramatic increase, from 1.8 per cent to 5 per cent. Attention deficit disorders now affect a staggering 25 per cent of students, up from 13 per cent in 2010.\nThe data also reveals gender disparities. Girls are disproportionately affected by anxiety (8 per cent take medication compared to 3.8 per cent of boys), depression, and eco-anxiety—a newer metric that tracks stress tied to environmental concerns. The decline in self-esteem was also more pronounced in girls, dropping from 15 per cent in 2010 to just 7 per cent in 2023. For boys, the decline was smaller but still significant, falling from 24 per cent to 16 per cent in the same period.\nDr. Montreuil pointed out, “Eco-anxiety is a reflection of our increasing awareness of climate change and the stress it induces, especially in younger generations who feel they have little control over the situation.”\nFactors behind the numbers\nWhile the pandemic has been blamed for rising mental health challenges, Dr. Montreuil argued it’s not the sole culprit. “Interestingly, the steepest increase in issues occurred before the pandemic,” she explained. “During the pandemic, there was more awareness and discussion about mental health, which might have temporarily slowed the upward trend. Parents were more present, and there was a surge in available resources.”\nDr. Montreuil emphasized that increased awareness and better diagnostic tools also contribute to the rising numbers. “We’re more attuned to what anxiety looks like, which leads to more diagnoses,” she said. “But there’s no denying societal factors, like social media, play a role. Platforms like TikTok and Instagram amplify social comparison, contributing to low self-esteem and even eating disorders.”\nSubscribe to read this story and more\nShare this article",

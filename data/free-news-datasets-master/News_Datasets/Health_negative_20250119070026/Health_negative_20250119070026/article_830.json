    "text": "At least one objection to Sharon Regional Medical Center's closing was filed on Thursday.\nUnitedHealthcare Insurance, a healthcare insurer giant, filed the objection in Steward Health Care’s bankruptcy case in a Texas federal bankruptcy court. Steward owns Sharon Regional and filed notifications earlier this week that it would close the Sharon hospital Jan. 6.\nIn its motion UnitedHealthcare said it wasn’t objecting to the actual closing. Rather, to its timing.\nThe company said in court documents it provides healthcare insurance to over 2,500 people who would be affected by the hospital’s closing.\nTo comply with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ regulations, UnitedHealthcare said in court documents it needs at least a 40-day closure notice. CMS is a federal agency that provides health coverage to over 160 million people through programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nCMS requires insurers to give a 30-day notice to clients when a hospital closes, the company said in court documents. United Healthcare said it needs 10 additional days for mailing the notice to customers, which brings the total to 40 days.\nThursday was the last day the bankruptcy court gave for any objections to be filed about Sharon Regional’s closing.\nSteward announced the closing on Monday after local financing to sell the hospital to Meadville Medical Center collapsed on Friday.\nSeparately, nearby UPMC Horizon and UPMC Jameson hospitals have already cranked upped their capacity to handle patients from Sharon Regional, Dave Patton, president of both hospital systems said. UPMC Horizon has hospitals 3 miles away in Farrell and 16 miles away in Greenville. UPMC Jameson's hospital is 20 miles away in New Castle.\n“In mid-summer we already saw an uptick in our numbers across all disciplines at all three of our campuses,’’ Patton said of patient volumes. “Our doors are open whether it’s for primary care, specialists or a hospital.’’\nHe said the overall patient volume at Horizon and Jameson has risen 10% to 12% over that period. New hospital beds also have been added with a boost in staff, but he didn't immediately have any number.\n“We have the ability to ramp up wherever needed,’’ Patton said.\nHe noted Horizon expanded its Farrell emergency room earlier this year. Also, a UPMC job fair at the Farrell hospital Wednesday netted 60 who were interested in working for the non-profit healthcare provider.\nWhile patients may have to be moved to other hospital settings, UPMC always has the goal of keeping them as close to home as possible, Patton said.\n“Our staff have really been resilient in this,’’ he said.\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office said in a statement on Wednesday it was working to sell Sharon Regional. No new potential buyer has submitted any court documents with an offer.\nSteward Health Care decided to sell its 31 hospitals nationwide after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Two in Massachusetts were closed and Sharon Regional and another hospital are the only two that haven't been disposed of.",

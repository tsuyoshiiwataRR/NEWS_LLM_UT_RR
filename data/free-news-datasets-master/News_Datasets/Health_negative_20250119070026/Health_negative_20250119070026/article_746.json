    "text": "An explosive report reveals that White House aides have worked tirelessly to shield President Joe Biden from public scrutiny, carefully managing his schedule and limiting interactions due to concerns over his mental and physical stamina. The Wall Street Journal's investigation sheds light on how Biden’s cognitive struggles were concealed from the public, with aides making tactical adjustments to his daily activities, often rescheduling meetings to accommodate his “good days and bad days.”From the moment Biden, 82, assumed office in January 2021, staffers were tasked with managing his public appearances. With the backdrop of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the White House formed a protective shell around the aging commander-in-chief. By spring 2021, the administration began adjusting Biden's schedule to reflect his fluctuating energy levels, a pattern that became evident after he stumbled on the world stage. Meetings were often pushed to the afternoon, as Biden struggled with long hours and required a shorter window for functioning.— OliLondonTV (@OliLondonTV) One national security official told an aide in 2021: \\\"He has good days and bad days, and today was a bad day so we’re going to address this tomorrow.\\\" As his public appearances continued, Biden frequently relied on notecards and struggled with off-script moments, misremembering names of foreign dignitaries or important facts, reported the Post.The White House was also concerned about Biden’s health affecting his public image. A source revealed that the administration hired a voice coach, Jeffrey Katzenberg, to help Biden with his faint, raspy tone. Additionally, staffers reportedly manipulated the news Biden received daily, ensuring he was only presented with positive reports. These steps were intended to maintain a polished image of Biden, despite growing concerns over his performance.— unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) The tension surrounding Biden's mental sharpness reached a high point during his preparation for a legal interview with special counsel Robert Hur over his mishandling of classified documents. Despite Biden’s insistence on the interview, staffers noticed that he struggled with recall and fluctuated in energy levels during prep sessions. Biden even forgot the year his son, Beau, passed away from cancer during a two-day session in October 2023.— KamVTV (@KamVTV) While Biden’s public image has faced scrutiny, his aides have continued to defend him. Deputy press secretary Andrew Bates denied the notion that Biden's engagements were minimal. He emphasized that Biden \\\"speaks with members of his cabinet daily\\\" and engages in frequent discussions about policy and national security. Bates argued that the modern work environment, where many meetings are held virtually or in shorter formats, doesn’t diminish Biden’s leadership.— CitizenFreePres (@CitizenFreePres) Still, the report reveals an administration that carefully curated Biden’s image. The tight control extended to Biden’s re-election campaign in 2024, with aides withholding direct survey results from him. As Biden’s approval ratings dipped, staffers managed his exposure to the media, fearing that negative coverage could harm his prospects.— OliLondonTV (@OliLondonTV) Biden’s re-election campaign faced additional scrutiny as some worried that the first lady, Jill Biden, was overshadowing her husband. At times, staff even intervened to prevent Jill Biden from outshining the president, revealing internal concerns about how the media might portray the Bidens.— CollinRugg (@CollinRugg) Despite the concerns over Biden’s cognitive state, Bates stressed that the president’s accomplishments were significant. \\\"President Biden has earned the most accomplished record of any modern commander-in-chief,\\\" he asserted, citing the administration’s economic achievements and efforts to rebuild the middle class.",

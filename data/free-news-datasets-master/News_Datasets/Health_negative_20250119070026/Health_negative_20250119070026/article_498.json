    "text": "Citrus disease detected in Mission Viejo\nThe deadly citrus tree disease Huanglongbing (HLB) has continued to spread in Orange County with a quarantine in place throughout parts of the region – including Mission Viejo – to protect the state’s iconic fruit.\nThe deadly citrus tree disease Huanglongbing (HLB) is one of the biggest threats to California citrus. While HLB is not harmful to humans, there is no cure and once a citrus tree is infected it will die. The HLB quarantine places limits on the transport and movement of citrus plants and material to prevent the spread of the deadly disease.\nIt’s important for backyard citrus tree owners in Mission Viejo to continue to care for their citrus trees, as a lack of maintenance could be an invitation for a deadly plant disease called Huanglongbing and the pest that can spread it, the Asian citrus psyllid.\nTo help residents throughout the state understand what the HLB quarantine means, the Citrus Pest & Disease Prevention Program [answers commonly asked questions](https://californiacitrusthreat.org/pest-disease/huanglongbing-quarantine/) to best explain how everyone can work to protect [California’s citrus](https://youtu.be/We9UPX153eA?si=s91xxWnwzcVNwlFb).\nResidents are encouraged to do their part by reporting signs of HLB on their backyard citrus trees to 1-800-491-1899.\nFor more information, visit [this link](https://californiacitrusthreat.org/pest-disease/huanglongbing-quarantine/).",

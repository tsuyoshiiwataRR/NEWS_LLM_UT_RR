Among educators and parents, the trend brought back memories of government school closures and their school instruction-related repercussions. This qualitative holistic case study explored how school choral music directors perceive their choral music programs' preparedness to mitigate instruction-related losses should future pandemics or long-term disruptions to instruction occur. The study examined relevant literature vis-a-vis journal articles and books and conducted open-ended interviews online, by phone, and in person. This study can empower choral music education with teaching strategies to improve SCMPs’ future preparedness against crippling disturbances due to disease outbreaks or other long-term disruptions. The study’s findings show that most choral music educators are optimistic about their SCMP's future preparedness. Still, some doubt their SCMPs’ future preparedness should similar long-term disruptions to instruction occur. Increasing awareness emphasizing instructional strategies and adaptation skills gained during the COVID-19 pandemic, implementing digital education for teachers and students, and investing in computer technology research that reduces latency, lag time, and echo in choral music virtual settings can significantly improve SCMPs’ future preparedness.",

    "text": "Northern Territory Police have seized a large quantity of alcohol and illicit substances across two interceptions in the West Daly Region this week.\nOn Sunday 15 December, Daly River police intercepted a vehicle with two occupants travelling to Wadeye. A subsequent search of the vehicle uncovered 63 litres of liquor and over 260 grams of cannabis intended for distribution in the community.\nThe two occupants, a 21-year-old male and 39-year-old male, were issued a Notice to Appear for 14 January 2025 at Wadeye Local Court.\nOn Monday 16 December, local police in Wadeye intercepted three vehicles travelling in a convoy along Port Keats Road.\nA search of one vehicle, a Toyota Hilux, discovered 30 bottles of liquor intended for distribution in the remote community. The other two vehicles were found to be transporting two bottles of liquor and several pre-mixed alcoholic drinks.\nAll occupants of the three vehicles returned positive results on roadside breath tests. Two male offenders, aged 35 and 33, were each issued with a Notice to Appear.\nThe Toyota Hilux was subsequently seized on Tuesday 17 December for grog running and investigations are ongoing.\nActing Superintendent Erica Gibson said, \"I commend the excellent proactive police work of our local members to intercept these vehicles.\n\"The supply of alcohol and illicit substances into our communities has devastating impacts on the lives of those who live there.\n\"Police will continue to target those who wish to gain benefit from distribution alcohol or illicit substances in our remote communities and ensure that offenders have their day in court.\"\nAnyone with information on the supply of alcohol or illicit substances into communities are urged to call police on 131 444 or make an anonymous report to Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.\n[here](https://www.miragenews.com/alcohol-drug-seizures-surge-in-west-daly-region-1382946/).",

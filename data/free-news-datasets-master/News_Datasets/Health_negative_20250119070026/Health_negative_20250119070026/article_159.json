    "text": "Period poverty rife despite new products and changing stigma\n[Louise Miolin](/news/louise-miolin/13180588)for\n[Story Stream](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/storystream)\nWhen 19-year-old Bronte Woolley gets her period, she doesn't buy pads or tampons.\n\"I use period undies instead of disposable period products because they're more comfy, and they're more sustainable, and they're really cost-effective,\" she said.\nPeriod products are evolving, and so is the way people talk about menstruation — but period poverty is still a major issue across Australia.\nThe rise of reusables\nPeriod underwear like Ms Woolley's absorbs menstrual blood and can be washed and reused for several years.\nShe is not alone in ditching disposables.\nA [2024 report from period poverty charity Share the Dignity](/news/2024-08-01/cost-of-living-causes-period-poverty/104170146) showed 43 per cent of people who menstruated used reusable underwear.\nIt said 12 per cent used menstrual cups, which are inserted into the vagina to catch blood then emptied, washed, and reused.\nMs Woolley has polycystic ovary syndrome and gets heavy periods.\nShe said reusable products saved her money on monthly supplies.\n\"I was going through a pack of pads or a pack of tampons a day, so that can be up to $30 a week when you have your period, whereas a pair of undies is $30 and you have them until they wear out,\" she said.\nThe environment was a consideration too.\n\"Most of my friends use period undies instead of disposable items just because they're more environmentally friendly,\" Ms Woolley said.\nMenstrual cups and underwear were largely unknown a decade ago but have become available in most major supermarkets.\nRapid advances in technology\nWhen 75-year-old Margie Booker got her period in the early 1960s, belts were the norm to secure pads before adhesives became available.\nLoading...\"People my age would remember [the pad] being termed the surfboard because it was huge, it was cumbersome,\" she said.\nMs Booker said her mother's generation used rags or pieces of cloth.\n\"They had to dry them on the line … that would have been hard,\" she said.\nShe said when she was a teenager, a period was to be kept \"discreet\" and only shared with close girlfriends.\nBut as the products changed, so too did the way periods were shown in the media and spoken about in society.\nIn 1985, as tampons gained popularity, actress Courteney Cox became known as the first person to say the word \"period\" on American TV.\nLoading...Swinburne University senior design lecturer Jane Connery, who has studied period product advertising over the past century, said periods were previously marketed as a \"medical problem\" to be solved.\nDr Connery said brands were wary of being explicit about menstruation.\n\"A lot of us remember when the liquids used to show the absorbency of the products used to be blue ink,\" she said.\nDr Connery said the stigma was slowly changing with more accurate depictions of periods in media.\n\"I get very excited to see the positive change,\" she said.\nLoading...Products and period poverty\nDespite progress in period technology and public discourse, period poverty is still rife in Australia.\nThe [Share the Dignity report](/news/2024-08-01/cost-of-living-causes-period-poverty/104170146) that showed a boom in reusable products also found 64 per cent of people who menstruate had struggled to afford any kind of period product at some point in their lives.\nTasmania, where Ms Woolley lives, had the worst rate of period poverty in the country with about 10 per cent of people who menstruate unable to afford period products in the past 12 months.\nAcross the country, 74 per cent of people in rural areas have had difficulty buying period products.\nShare the Dignity founder and managing director, Rochelle Courtenay, said most programs addressing period poverty focused on pads and tampons.\nBut she said reusable products had a role to play too.\n\"It's really important to give people choices in dealing with a period in whatever way they want,\" she said.\nMs Courtenay said the higher initial cost of underwear and cups could be a barrier for some people as well as a lack of knowledge about what products were out there.\n\"People still don't want to talk about menstruation … people are just starting to learn about these things,\" she said.\nShe said Share the Dignity was preparing to launch a campaign to supply young women and girls with cups and period underwear.\n\"Those girls will always have access to menstrual products because they've got period undies or a menstrual cup,\" Ms Courtenay said.\nUniversity of Western Australia global health researcher Dani Barrington agreed that reusable products could help boost access, especially for young women.\n\"I think the younger generation coming through are much more open to using these reusable products from the beginning,\" Dr Barrington said.\n\"If we are going to be providing products in schools, then we should be asking 'Do you want reusable products?'\"\nDr Barrington said the supply of products must be supported with a range of other measures.\n\"Free access to products as well as the facilities to be able to change them, to wash them, dispose of them is really key … and that needs to be coupled with education for everybody about menstruation,\" she said.\n\"Boys and girls, men and women, people who don't identify as one of those genders … so everybody understands what the reality is like.\"\nMs Woolley agreed with that sentiment.\n\"It's not something to be afraid of. It's something you should be able to talk about, and you should have access to everything that makes you comfortable,\" she said.",

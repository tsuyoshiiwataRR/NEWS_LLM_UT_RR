    "text": "2 hours ago Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Tennessee's agricultural sector is on heightened alert following a suspected outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) at a commercial chicken facility in Gibson County earlier this week.\nState Veterinarian Dr. Samantha Beaty stated, “Although we are awaiting final confirmation, we are confident the illness affecting this flock is HPAI. HPAI continues to circulate in our environment, particularly in the wild bird population. As always, we strongly encourage people who own birds to practice strong biosecurity to protect their flock.”\nThe Tennessee Department of Agriculture has implemented a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) control zone around the affected facility. Within this zone, poultry will undergo testing and monitoring, and the movement of poultry requires permitting until the zone is released. Officials are working with poultry owners in the area to provide guidance and mitigate further spread.\nThis suspected outbreak coincides with a troubling rise in HPAI cases across the country and globally. On December 18, a 65-year-old man in Louisiana became the first U.S. patient hospitalized with a severe case of H5N1 bird flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Health officials stated the man likely contracted the virus from sick birds in his backyard.\nMeanwhile, California declared a state of emergency on December 18 due to the impact of avian flu on dairy cattle and reports of bird-to-human infections. This declaration highlights the virus's potential to affect poultry and other agricultural sectors.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that since 2003, H5N1 has infected 904 people and caused 465 deaths. The virus has been detected in 108 countries across five continents, and more than 300 million birds worldwide have died from the disease or been culled to control outbreaks. The United Nations has expressed concern about the virus infecting a wider range of species, with over 500 bird species and at least 70 mammalian species affected.\nCloser to home, Tennessee’s poultry industry plays a crucial economic role. With more than 500 family farms and significant contributions to poultry genetics, the industry generates nearly $1 billion in revenue annually. “Protecting our flocks is not just vital for our economy but for food security globally,” said a statement from the Tennessee Poultry Association.\nDespite the risks, health officials have emphasized that HPAI does not pose a food safety threat. Infected poultry is prohibited from entering the food supply, and properly handled and cooked poultry and eggs remain safe to consume. The CDC has assessed the risk of human transmission in the U.S. as very low.\nBird owners are urged to implement biosecurity measures to safeguard their flocks. These measures include washing hands thoroughly before and after handling birds, using dedicated footwear in coops, disinfecting equipment regularly, and preventing contact between domestic and wild birds.\n“Everyone has a role to play in preventing the spread of this disease,” said Dr. Beaty, urging Tennesseans to remain vigilant.\nThe investigation into the Gibson County outbreak continues, with state and federal officials collaborating to confirm the cause and limit its spread.\nThe story draws on information from the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and statements from the Tennessee Poultry Association.\ninfluenza bird flu bird to human transmission health healthcare 14",

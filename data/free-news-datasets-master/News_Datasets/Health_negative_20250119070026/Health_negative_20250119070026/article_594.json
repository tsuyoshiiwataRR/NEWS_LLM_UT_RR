    "text": "The United States has confirmed its first severe case of H5N1 bird flu in Louisiana, marking a concerning development in the ongoing fight against avian influenza. The patient, who was hospitalized with critical respiratory illness, had direct exposure to sick and dead birds in a backyard flock. This is the first documented case in the U.S. linked to non-commercial poultry, adding new urgency to bird flu surveillance and response efforts.\nHow the Infection Was Identified\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the case, stating that the patient came into contact with infected birds on their property. This case does not involve exposure to dairy cows or commercial poultry, which have been the source of many previous outbreaks. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, noted that the patient likely contracted the virus through direct contact with the sick birds.\nThe patient, a person over 65 with underlying health conditions, is currently hospitalized in critical condition. Their age and existing medical issues have significantly increased their risk of severe complications from the virus. Health officials from the Louisiana Department of Health are leading the investigation and have not disclosed further details about the patient's symptoms.\nAlso Read: [Deadly Mystery in Congo: Disease Claims 143 Lives, Experts Reveal the Cause](https://www.onlymyhealth.com/what-is-the-mysterious-disease-in-congo-that-claimed-143-lives-12977822088)\nBird Flu in the United States\nThe H5N1 virus strain detected in this case is the same as the one responsible for recent infections in Canada and Washington state. This strain has been found in wild birds and backyard flocks across the U.S. However, it differs from the strain B3.13, which has been identified in outbreaks involving dairy cows and some human cases.\nSince October, the H5N1 virus has led to 61 confirmed human cases in the U.S., with California reporting 34 of them. Most of those infections occurred in dairy farm workers. While the overall risk to the general public remains low, the CDC is conducting additional genomic sequencing to fully understand the Louisiana case and its potential implications.\nThe Risks and Precautions\nBird flu, particularly the H5N1 strain, has a history of causing severe illnesses and fatalities in humans worldwide. However, person-to-person transmission has not been observed, reducing the immediate threat of a widespread outbreak. The CDC continues to monitor these cases closely and reiterates the importance of taking precautions, especially for those handling birds or working with livestock.\nAlso Read: [Russia Unveils New Cancer Vaccine, Promises Free Distribution to Fight the Disease](https://www.onlymyhealth.com/russia-unveils-new-cancer-vaccine-promises-free-distribution-12977822077)\n\"People who work with or have recreational exposure to infected animals are at higher risk,\" said Dr. Daskalakis. \"Itâ€™s extremely important that they follow CDC recommendations to avoid infection.\" These precautions include wearing protective gear, avoiding contact with sick birds, and ensuring good hygiene practices.\nState Responses and Emergency Measures\nIn response to the rising number of H5N1 cases, California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency to combat the spread of bird flu. The virus has spread to multiple dairy farms in the state, prompting the need for more resources and flexible measures.\nGovernor Newsom emphasized that while the public risk remains low, the emergency declaration will allow state agencies to act swiftly to contain the virus. \"This proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need,\" Newsom stated.\nThe declaration provides additional funding and staffing to help manage the outbreak, especially in regions like the Central Valley and Southern California, where the virus has impacted dairy farms.\nThe Importance of Prevention\nGiven the potential severity of bird flu, prevention remains the best strategy. Infected birds can shed the virus through saliva, mucus, and faeces. Other animals, such as cows, may also spread the virus through respiratory secretions and unpasteurized milk.\nHealth authorities urge people with backyard flocks, hunters, and anyone who works with birds to take the following precautions:\n- Avoid direct contact with sick or dead birds.\n- Use protective gear such as gloves and masks when handling birds.\n- Wash hands thoroughly after any contact with birds or their droppings.\n- Report any unusual bird deaths to local health departments.\nThe CDC will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates. While the immediate risk to the public remains low, this case underscores the need for vigilance and preparedness in managing potential bird flu threats.\nBottomline\nThe Louisiana case serves as a stark reminder that zoonotic diseases like H5N1 bird flu are a persistent threat. Continued cooperation between federal, state, and local health authorities, along with public awareness, is essential to prevent further infections and protect public health.",

    "text": "Older adults with at least two chronic ailments have accelerated [kidney](https://www.mcknights.com/news/people-starting-dialysis-after-launch-of-aca-chose-private-insurance-over-medicare-report-finds/) function decline, and the progression gets worse the more chronic conditions a person has, a new study shows.\nResearchers examined five multimorbidity patterns and found that cardiometabolic conditions are linked to the highest risk for kidney problems. There was nota risk for kidney decline in those who had psychiatric or respiratory issues, but those classified in the cognitive and sensory pattern had accelerated decline, according to the [study](https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jgs.19298) published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.\nMultimorbidity is defined as having two or more chronic conditions.\nInvestigators examined data on 3,094 older individuals from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen, following up on them for 15 years. The mean age of participants was 73.9 years old. Of participants, 87% had multimorbidity. The team used estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) blood testing to gauge kidney function.\nThere is not a lot of data that explores the link between multimorbidity and kidney function decline, though there is a bit of research on certain chronic conditions and the risk of kidney function decline, the authors noted.\n“Multimorbidity is strongly associated with accelerated kidney function decline in older age. Individuals with cardiometabolic multimorbidity exhibit a particularly increased risk,” the authors wrote. The team added that interventions and monitoring may be able to help people preserve the function of their kidneys. Monitoring eGFR, promoting healthy lifestyle factors, discussing drug interventions and managing complications may go a long way to support kidney health and lower other risks for those who are living with multiple chronic conditions.",

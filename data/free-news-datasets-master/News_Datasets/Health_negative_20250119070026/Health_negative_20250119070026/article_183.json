Please Use Discernment.\nFauci Admits None Of The 72 Mandatory Childrens Vaccines Were Ever Safety Tested – December 19, 2024\nGet Awesome Patriot Gear Today! Pay Just S&H For Most Items!\n————————————————————\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has recounted how, when threatened with a lawsuit, Dr. Anthony Fauci was forced to admit that none of the 72 vaccines that are currently mandated for children in the US has ever been safety tested.\nSpeaking at a Hillsdale College event, Kennedy, who is Donald Trump’s nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said:\n“For many years, I was saying that not one of the 72 vaccines mandated for children has ever been safety tested in pre-licensing, placebo-controlled trials……Not one.”\nFauci had even gone do so far as to call Kennedy “a liar.”\nLifeSite News reports: When then-President Trump appointed Kennedy to run a vaccine safety commission, Trump ordered Fauci and Collins to meet with him along with White House counsel present.\nKennedy told Fauci, “You say I’m lying. For eight years you’ve been saying I’m lying,” and challenged Fauci to “show me the study” which shows that the multitude of vaccines America’s children are required to receive have been safety-tested.\nFauci claimed that he didn’t have it with him. “It’s back in Bethesda. I’ll send it to you.”\n“I never got it,” said Kennedy, “so I sued him.”\n“After stonewalling us for a year, their lawyers met us on the courthouse steps and said, ‘Yup, you’re right. We never had any study,’” said Kennedy.\nKennedy went on to explain how lucrative government-mandated children’s vaccines have been for the pharmaceutical industry:\nThere’s no downstream liability, there’s no front-end safety testing – that saves them a quarter billion dollars – and there’s no marketing and advertising costs, because the federal government is ordering 78 million school kids to take that vaccine every year.\nWhat better product could you have? And so there was a gold rush to add all these new vaccines to the schedule that we don’t need. Most of these vaccines are unnecessary. Many of them are for diseases that are not even casually contagious.\nIt was a gold rush, because if you get onto that schedule, it’s a billion dollars a year for your company.\nAnd in many cases, NIH is earning the royalties.\nAccording to Kennedy, more obscene than the huge profits being horded by Big Pharma are the vast number of negative side-effects from all those untested vaccines.\n“Neurological diseases” have “exploded,” he said.\n“ADHD, sleep disorders, language delays, ASD, autism, Tourette’s syndrome, ticks, narcolepsy. These are all things that I never heard of,” said Kennedy. “Autism went from one in 10,000 in my generation according to CDC data to one in every 34 kids today.”\nKennedy is known for vehemently opposing vaccines, a stance he adopted after the mothers of vaccine-injured children implored him to look into the research linking thimerosal to neurological injuries, including autism. He went on to found Children’s Health Defense, an organization with the stated mission of “ending childhood health epidemics by eliminating toxic exposure,” largely through vaccines.\nKennedy said in October that Trump has asked him to reorganize and “clean up” federal health agencies like the CDC and FDA. This would involve ending conflicts of interest that favor the interests of pharmaceutical companies over evidence-based medicine, according to Kennedy.\nFrom thepeoplesvoice.tv\n————————————————————",

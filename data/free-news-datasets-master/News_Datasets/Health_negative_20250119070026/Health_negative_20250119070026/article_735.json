    "text": "Ariana Grande lookalike Paige Niemann has sparked concerns about her petite frame – and was accused of drastically losing weight to keep up with the singer.\nIn a recent video shared to her TikTok page, the 20-year-old internet personality and OnlyFans creator dressed up as Ariana’s Wicked character Glinda from Jon M. Chu’s recently released film adaptation of the Broadway musical.\nPaige played the role of the star in a pink and white striped button-up dress and a pink ruffled shirt in sync with the production’s famous hit, What Is This Feeling?\nAlthough it appeared to be just an innocent upload, alarm bells sounded for some of her followers.\nMany people on the\nOne viewer wrote: ‘The fact that she has gone to such lengths to continue losing weight [to look] like Ari is so messed up…put her in jail.”\nAnother agreed, adding, “Yes, I’m so glad someone finally talked about it because the weight loss part? Why? Like losing weight to look like Ari? Hello?’\n“She needs help,” said a third.\nAriana Grande lookalike Paige Niemann has sparked concerns about her petite body – and was accused of drastically losing weight to keep up with the singer\nPeople on X wondered if she lost weight so she could look like Ariana (seen earlier this month)\nEchoing a similar sentiment, a fourth user posted: ‘I swear this is so worrying…’\nA fifth wrote: ‘I don’t want to assume she did, but without a doubt she looks exactly like Ariana in every style phase she’s gone through, right down to a similar weight and appearance. It’s really about behavior.’\nOthers, however, couldn’t get past how much Paige looked like Ariana.\n“The fact that this isn’t Ariana Grande is scary,” one said, while another commented, “Wait, so this isn’t Ariana Grande?”\nAriana doppelgänger Paige was first compared to the chart-topper in her schoolyard when she was just 10 years old.\nFour years and a million TikTok followers later, the striking brunette found her own fame online in 2014 thanks to their uncanny resemblance.\nIn 2019, the California native said that after asking her mother to do her hair and makeup like the God Is A Woman singer, she started learning the beauty tricks herself.\nAnd the more she posted on Instagram, the more she caught the attention of Ariana fans around the world.\nPaige dressed up as Ariana’s Wicked character Glinda in a recent video shared to TikTok\nMany people took to the X, formerly Twitter, to share their concerns about her thin physique\nBut Ariana may not be a fan, as she once called people who imitate her’ bizarre.’\nThe former Nickelodeon star has raised concerns about her small figure in recent months.\nEarlier this month, she fought back tears when a French influencer and journalist asked her how she “deals” with criticism of her appearance and beauty standards in general.\nAriana said she has been dealing with the “noise” since she was a teenager.\nShe added that she has since learned to shut out the critics by leaning on her work and friends.\n‘I’ve been doing this for the public… a specimen in a petri dish actually since I was 16 or 17. So I heard it all,” she said.\n“I’ve heard every version of what’s wrong with me. And then you fix it and then it’s wrong for different reasons, but that’s everything, from even the simple thing: your appearance, you’re young and you hear all those things.\n‘It’s hard to protect yourself from that noise. And it’s something that’s uncomfortable no matter what scale you experience it on.\nThe former Nickelodeon star has raised concerns about her small figure in recent months\nIn 2020, California native Paige, left, used Ariana’s Bring It On costume, right, as inspiration for a look\n“Even if you go to Thanksgiving dinner and someone’s grandma says, ‘Oh my God, you look skinnier! What happened?’ or, “You look heavier! What happened?” That is something that is uncomfortable and terrible wherever it happens, whatever scale it happens. I think there is a comfort in today’s society that we shouldn’t have at all.\n“Commenting on appearance, other people’s appearance, what they think is happening behind the scenes, or health, or how they present themselves… from what you wear, to your body, to your face, to everything. ‘\nShe defiantly called the “comfort” people have with “commenting” on people’s appearance “dangerous.”\n‘There’s a reassurance that people are commenting on that, which I think is really dangerous. And I think it’s dangerous for all parties involved,” she said.",

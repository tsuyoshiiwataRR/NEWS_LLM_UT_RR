    "text": "Thereâ€™s an ongoing recall on approximately 2,033,256 cans of coconut water sold in 29 states, according to the Food and Drug Administration. This is due to a packaging issue that poses a botulism risk.\nThe Jarritos brand coconut water was sold in 17.5-fl.-oz. cans at retailers in the following states: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.\nThis recall was announced after it was discovered that the seal on the lid of the cans may be compromised. This can allow bacteria like Clostridium botulinum to grow inside of the can, which can cause illness.\nAll lot codes of the coconut water are impacted by this recall. If you have the Jarritos branded product in your home, dispose of it immediately or return it to your place of purchase for a refund. Symptoms of Clostridium botulinum infection (more commonly known as botulism) can start from six hours to two weeks after consuming the bacteria. Signs of botulism may include bloating, constipation, muscle weakness, double vision, dizziness, trouble speaking or swallowing and difficulty breathing. If you are showing any of these symptoms, seek medical attention as soon as possible.\nFor questions about this recall, contact your local FDA Complaint Coordinator.",

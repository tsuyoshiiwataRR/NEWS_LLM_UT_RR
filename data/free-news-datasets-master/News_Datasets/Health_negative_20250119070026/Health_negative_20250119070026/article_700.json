    "text": "LAFAYETTE, La. (NEWS 15) â€” The Louisiana Department of Health reported on Thursday, December 19, that avian flu has been detected in a second backyard flock in the state, this one in southwest Louisiana. It follows the CDC reporting that a Louisiana patient hospitalized in Lake Charles is the first severe human case of bird flu in the country.\nThe patient is from southwest Louisiana, over 65, and hospitalized in critical condition. The source is likely exposure to a backyard flock of birds.\nBird flu is a Type A H5N1 influenza virus or Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. And while this is the first severe case in the United States, there are 61 known cases in people for the year.\nThe virus lives and multiplies in wild birds, called a sanctuary site. From there, it spreads to other birds like chickens where it's often fatal. The virus has acquired the ability to spread to mammals like cattle and other mammals, including humans.\nRELATED STORIES:\nSo far, there has not been any direct person-to-person transmission. But should it occur, exposure to the new aggressive strain, without pre-existing immunity, could be the next pandemic.\nFor now, the best advice is to avoid exposure to H5N1. Do not handle sick or dead animals without proper protection. Avoid undercooked eggs, dairy, and unpasteurized milk. And report any sick or dead animals.\nThe threat to the general public remains low.",

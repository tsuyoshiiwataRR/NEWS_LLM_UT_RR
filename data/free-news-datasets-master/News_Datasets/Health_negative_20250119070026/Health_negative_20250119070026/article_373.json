    "text": "Bird flu, as explained by the CDC, has some notable symptoms which people from the United States need to keep an eye out for, looking at the massive rise in cases across the country. As of now, the US is currently in a state of a public health emergency, dairy cows in California tested positive for the virus. The rise in bird flu cases has begun creating widespread panic in the US, and some are even confusing the regular flu symptoms with bird flu, which is another huge problem. Therefore, relevant authorities and agencies a issuing constant notices and cautionary warnings about bird flu, and details around the virus. How is the traditional or regular flu different from the H5N1 virus?For starters, the H5N1 flu's name itself comes in from the fact that it majorly affects birds, and humans are not meant to be its primary target. The immune system of birds is much more delicate than that of humans, making it easier to infiltrate for the virus. However, there is still no major explanation about the exact way of entry of the virus into the human body by the H5N1 virus, as in some cases, patients do not even show the symptoms declared by the CDC. Bird flu in humans will result in coughing, diarrhea, difficulty in breathing, high fever and headache in general. These symptoms could happen all at one, or one may feel the pang of each or some symptoms with each passing day. Muscle pains and a sore throat are also a part of the symptoms of those affected with H5N1. FAQs:Are bird flu cases increasing in the US? As per CDC's latest reports, bird flu is majorly affecting key US cities, and the number of cases are now surging amid the flu season in the country. Is the H5N1 virus fatal?For many patients whose immune system is weaker, H5N1 virus can prove to be fatal. Moreover, the H5N1 virus does not have a designated vaccine shot, making things even more complex.",

    "text": "Georgia's Medicaid contract awards could cause three in four Medicaid recipients in the state to switch plans, according to Centene CEO Sarah London.\nThe state said it would [grant ](https://www.beckerspayer.com/contracting/georgia-to-award-4-medicaid-contracts.html)Medicaid contracts to Humana, CareSource, Molina and UnitedHealthcare, on Dec. 2. Centene, who currently holds a contract with the state, did not receive a new contract.\nAt the company's [investor day](https://investors.centene.com/Centene-Corporation-December-2024-Investor-Day) on Dec. 12, Ms. London said Centene was disappointed in the initial results.\n\"As we review the information that we have today, we have some concerns about the process,\" Ms. London said. \"Broadly, we have some real concerns about a policy decision that would make 75% of Medicaid members in Georgia choose a different plan while initiating a complex [aged, blind and disabled] program.\"\nMs. London said Centene intends to challenge the decision.\nSome states have walked back contract awards that would cause a significant share of Medicaid beneficiaries to switch to new insurers. In 2023, California [awarded](https://www.beckerspayer.com/contracting/in-major-reversal-california-awards-additional-medicaid-contracts.html) more payers contracts to manage its Medicaid program, reversing course on contract awards that could have forced two million Medi-Cal members to switch insurance.\nTexas [paused](https://www.beckerspayer.com/contracting/texas-delays-medicaid-contract-awards.html) implementing its newly awarded contracts until 2025, pausing a shakeup that could have led 1.8 million beneficiaries to switch plans.\nBecker's has reached out to representatives for Georgia's Department of Community Health, which manages its Medicaid program, for comment, and will update this story if more information becomes available.\nGeorgia has nearly 2 million Medicaid enrollees, according to data from [KFF. ](https://files.kff.org/attachment/fact-sheet-medicaid-state-GA)",

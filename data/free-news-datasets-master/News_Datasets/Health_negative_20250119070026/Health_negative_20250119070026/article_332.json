    "text": "Kentucky county bans medical cannabis use by its employees\nHARRODSBURG, Ky. (WKYT) - Another local government has decided to ban the use of medical cannabis by its employees.\nThe Mercer County Fiscal Court voted unanimously to ban the use during their special meeting Thursday morning.\nMedical Cannabis will take effect on January 1, and while there are still some hoops to jump through for the very limited use, county and city governments do have the ability to ban the use for their employees.\nMORE\n[Ky. woman shares medical cannabis’s impact on cancer journey](https://www.wkyt.com/2024/12/18/ky-woman-shares-medical-cannabiss-impact-cancer-journey/)[Kentucky prepares for medical cannabis program rollout](https://www.wkyt.com/2024/12/18/kentucky-prepares-medical-cannabis-program-rollout/)[Lottery held for Lexington area medical cannabis dispensary licenses](https://www.wkyt.com/2024/12/16/watch-live-lottery-lexington-area-medical-cannabis-dispensary-licenses/)[Kentucky launches website to help patients find providers for medical cannabis](https://www.wkyt.com/2024/12/02/kentucky-launches-website-help-patients-find-providers-medical-cannabis/)\nAccording to the resolution adopted by all the Mercer County magistrates Thursday morning, the court cites their drug-free workplace act of 1988, which prohibits the use of any drugs in the workplace by their county employees. They also cited the part of the law that states that employers are not required to permit or accommodate use.\n“We know that the General Assembly approved and enacted Senate Bill 47. We know that allows medical cannabis in Kentucky. But if you flip to the back page under this resolution, pursuant to KRS 218B.40, the Mercer County Fiscal Court exercises its right under this statute to not permit or accommodate the use of cannabis,” Judge-Executive Sarah Steele told the court during the meeting.\nAccording to the resolution, even if a county worker has a prescription and is a cardholder, they would not be allowed to use medical cannabis while employed by the county government.\nThe Richmond City Commission was set to vote on a similar resolution but decided to hold off. The mayor says they want to hear from people at their January meeting regarding the differences between recreational and medical cannabis.\nMatthew Bratcher is with Kentucky Norml, which is working to reform marijuana laws. He says few cities or counties have adopted similar resolutions but is encouraged that Richmond is taking another look at theirs.\n“It’s absolutely good to hear. It means they want to learn more. They want to get the facts straight. Absolutely what these jurisdictions need to do,” said Bratcher.\nBratcher says some large corporations are no longer drug testing for marijuana.\n“It lowers their job pool. It just makes it harder for them to hire. They know this isn’t a bad thing they have already made the move,” he said.\nBratcher says cities or counties have the right to pass resolutions. He says it’s not proven medical cannabis can impair someone on the job.\nCopyright 2024 WKYT. All rights reserved.",

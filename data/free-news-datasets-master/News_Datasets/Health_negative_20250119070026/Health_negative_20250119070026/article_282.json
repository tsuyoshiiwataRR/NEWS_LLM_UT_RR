    "text": "Delhi⁣ Gasps for Air as Pollution Reaches ‘Severe-Plus’ ‍Levels for Fourth Straight ‍Day Delhi’s air quality plummeted to alarming levels ⁢on Thursday,marking the⁣ fourth consecutive day the city has been shrouded in a thick blanket of smog. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) plunged into the ‘severe-plus’ category, raising serious health concerns for residents. ​While a slight improvement to the ‘severe’ ‌category is ⁢predicted for Friday, the situation remains dire.\n1200/POLLUTION%20STANDALONE%202024 19 12 8.jpg”/> 320/POLLUTION%20STANDALONE%202024 19 12 8.jpg”/>\n​ ‌ ‌People‌ wearing face masks amid thick smog in Delhi on Thursday.\n​ ⁣\n⁣ ‍ ⁣ ‌\nThe ‘severe-plus’ category, with an AQI reading between 451‍ and 500, ​poses significant health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions.Delhi’s 24-hour⁣ average AQI reached a staggering 451 on Thursday.The alarming situation has sparked criticism from ⁣the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party⁢ (BJP). virendra Sachdeva, president of the ⁣BJP’s Delhi unit, accused the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)⁢ government of inaction.\n“People have been suffering ‌from pollution for an extended period,and for the last 72 hours,the city remains under Stage-IV of the ‌Graded Response Action Plan,” Sachdeva said.”This leaves all residents troubled‌ in one way or another. ⁤Neither Chief Minister Atishi ‌nor Surroundings Minister Gopal Rai⁣ has addressed the gravity‌ of the ‌situation.”\nThe city’s air quality is expected to remain a major concern in the coming days, highlighting the urgent need for effective ⁣measures to ⁤combat pollution and protect ⁢public health.\nPlease provide me with the context or the question ‌you’d like me⁤ to answer. I need more details to understand what you’re looking for. 😊\nsuch as, you could ask:\n“Can you write a short story about a talking cat?”\n“What are the main causes of climate change?”\n* “How do I bake a chocolate chip cookie?” ⁤\nI’m ready to help! 👍",

    "text": "Alvin Kamara injury update: Saints RB's injury 'more significant', Darren Rizzi says\n[New Orleans Saints](https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/football/nfl/teams/new-orleans-saints/350/) running back [Alvin Kamara](https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/football/nfl/players/alvin-kamara/750846) was injured [against the Washington Commanders](https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/football/nfl/summary/2656669) in [Week 15](https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/football/nfl/scores?week=15&season=2024).\nThe star running back exited the game and never returned. The team later announced Kamara suffered a [groin injury](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2024/12/15/alvin-kamara-injury-update-saints-commanders/77009904007/).\nKamara is in the midst of an outstanding season, and his absence would be a significant loss for the [Saints](https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/football/nfl/teams/new-orleans-saints/350), who are already an anemic offense at the skilled positions.\nHere's the latest on the Saints running back's status:\nAlvin Kamara injury update\nSaints coach Darren Rizzi provided an update Thursday [during media availability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU9XSjDXFok). \"It's more significant than we initially thought,\" Rizzi said. He added that Kamara was unlikely to play in the Saints' upcoming game on [\"Monday Night Football.\"](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2024/05/15/nfl-monday-night-football-schedule-2024-dates-times-tv-info/73680920007/)\nFollowing the [Week 15](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2024/05/15/nfl-week-15-schedule-2024-dates-time-tv-info/73679892007/) game, Rizzi declined to elaborate on whether the injury was minor and told reporters more testing would be done on the running back.\nUnfortunately, testing has revealed that Kamara could miss an extended time. [ESPN's Adam Schefter](https://x.com/AdamSchefter/status/1869846184980034022) reported that, while the situation is still being evaluated, it could be a season-ending injury for the veteran running back.\nSaints RB depth chart: Who is Alvin Kamara's backup?\nThe Saints have two running backs behind Kamara on the 53-man roster.\nKamara joins a long list of injured Saints players at the skilled positions. The veteran Williams has recently been relegated to special teams, while second-year back Kendre Miller has started to take on more work as Kamara's backup.\nIf Kamara misses time, Miller is a good bet to take on the majority of work, as the Saints may want to see what they have in the 22-year-old back.",

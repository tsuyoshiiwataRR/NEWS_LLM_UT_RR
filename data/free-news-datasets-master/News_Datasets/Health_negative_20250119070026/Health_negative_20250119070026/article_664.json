    "text": "Exposure to radiofrequency (RF) radiation emitted by 4G LTE wireless networks impacted thyroid function in mice, according to a recent study published in the [International Journal of Molecular Sciences](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/20/10875).\nIn short:\n- Adolescent mice who were exposed to 4G RF radiation for eight hours a day over the course of one month had significantly increased levels of T3, a thyroid hormone that’s critical for metabolic growth and neurodevelopment.\n- RF radiation exposure was also associated with reduced expression of some genes related to the regulation of thyroid hormone production.\nKey quote:\n“These findings highlight the need for further research to comprehensively understand the effects of RF-EMFs on the endocrine system, particularly focusing on vulnerable children and adolescents.”\nWhy this matters:\nAll wireless devices - including cell phones, Wi-Fi and cell towers - emit RF radiation. Daily exposures are increasing, especially for children. The American Academy of Pediatrics has [highlighted how ](https://ehtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-letter-to-the-FCC-July-12-2012.pdf)children absorb proportionately higher RF radiation into their brain and bodies during sensitive stages of development. [Experts are raising concerns that outdated regulations ](https://www.ehn.org/rethinking-the-safety-of-our-wireless-era-2667673544.html)do not protect the public, particularly as technology is rapidly evolving beyond the 4G networks examined in this study.\nRelated EHN coverage:\n[New analysis calls for more precise research on cell phones and brain cancer](https://www.ehn.org/cell-phone-brain-cancer-analysis-2670227670.html)[Radiation from wireless devices disrupts testicular function in rats](https://www.ehn.org/wireless-radiation-testicular-function-2668869650.html)\nMore resources:\n- WATCH:\n[Health Hazards of Wireless Technologies: What do we know now?](https://www.healthandenvironment.org/che-webinars/96771)webinar, featuring Dr. Joel Moskowitz of UC Berkeley and hosted by[Collaborative for Health and Environment (CHE)](https://www.healthandenvironment.org/)\n[Kim, Hyun-Yong et al. for International Journal of Molecular Sciences vol. 25.

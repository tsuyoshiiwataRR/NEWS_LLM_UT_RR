    "text": "2 hours ago The recall includes 169,438 cases, totaling 2,033,256 cans.\nFood & Wine / Getty Images\nIf you've purchased any coconut water lately, then you may want to check your fridge.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated a recall for Jarritos Coconut Water 12-can cartons made by Tipp Distributors, Inc. It then re-upped the recall on Dec. 10 and noted it's ongoing. According to the recall notice, \"The hermetic seal on the lid of the cans may be compromised,\" which can affect the integrity of the product, causing it to leak, or, worse, be contaminated with harmful bacteria that will lead to illness if ingested.\nThe recalled product was distributed across 29 states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin.\nThe recall includes 169,438 cases, totaling 2,033,256 cans. It includes all lot codes.\nAs Food Safety News reported, the most dangerous potential outcome is botulism poisoning, which can \"paralyze the muscles needed for breathing, resulting in sudden death.\" It pointed to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, which noted that symptoms of botulism poisoning typically set in within 18 to 36 hours after exposure, though symptoms can pop up 10 days later. \"The spores usually do not cause people to become sick, even when they're eaten,\" the CDC explained. \"But under certain conditions, these spores can grow and make one of the most lethal toxins known.\"\nRelated: Food Recalls Are Happening More Frequently Than Ever — Here’s What Food Safety Experts Want You to Know\nThe CDC added that \"improperly home-canned, preserved, or fermented foods can provide the right conditions for spores to grow and make botulinum toxin,\" which means a can of coconut water that is also improperly sealed could also have the potential for the toxin to thrive as well. Again, the chances are slim, but it's probably not worth the gamble.\nIf you've experienced any of these symptoms, you should contact a medical professional immediately. And, if you've purchased the recalled coconut water you should not consume it and either discard it immediately or return it to the point of purchase for a full refund. If you have any additional questions about the recall, you can reach the company's customer service hotline at 1-888-668-2639.\nCoconut Water Recall Product: Jarritos Coconut Water 12-can cartons\nNumber of cans recalled: 2,033,256\nProduct Codes: All lot codes are included in the recall\nRecall reason: The hermetic seal on the can was compromised\nStates affected: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin",

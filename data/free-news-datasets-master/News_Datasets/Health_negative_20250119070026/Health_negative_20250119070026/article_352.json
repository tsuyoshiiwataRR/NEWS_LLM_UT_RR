    "text": "David Montgomery injury update: Second opinion revealed on Lions RB's potential season-ending injury\nEarlier this week, it looked like David Montgomery’s 2024 season was over due to an MCL injury. But the Detroit Lions RB got some promising news on Thursday after receiving a second opinion, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported.\nThere’s growing optimism Montgomery can avoid surgery after suffering the injury in last week’s loss to the Buffalo Bills, Rapoport said. He will instead undergo rehab with hopes of coming back for the postseason.\nCLICK HERE to go to PrizePicks and use code ON3 to receive a guaranteed $50 once you play $5 in lineups!\nLions coach Dan Campbell confirmed the initial plan was for Montgomery to miss the rest of the season due to surgery. However, the standout running back continued to seek more opinions, and a third opinion came back in his favor.\n“David’s getting another opinion,” Campbell said, via ProFootballTalk. “He’s had a couple, and really just see what this third one says. That’s why we have not put him on injured reserve. We’re in waiting mode.”\nWatch NFL Games Live – Try for Free Fubo!

Taxes and fees may apply.)\nDavid Montgomery is a key piece of the Lions’ rushing attack, forming one half of the two-headed monster in the backfield alongside Jahmyr Gibbs. Through 14 games, he ranks second on the team with 775 yards to go with a team-leading 12 touchdowns on the ground. Montgomery and Gibbs have called themselves “Sonic” and “Knuckles” in the backfield, an homage to the famous video game duo.\n[Top 10](/)\n1Carson Beck\nLatest on Georgia QB status for Sugar Bowl\n2NewAngry Sarkisian\nTexas HC rips Vandy QB ruling\n3Dylan Raiola\nNebraska QB rips transfer rumors\n4HotKiper offers Ewers advice\nHit the portal or light up CFP\n5TrendingNIL in Bitcoin\nUSC signee getting crypto earnings\n[View All](/)\nGet the On3 Top 10 to your inbox every morning\nThey’re now preparing to stick together for the foreseeable future, as well. Montgomery and the Lions agreed to an extension earlier this year, keeping him in Detroit through the 2028 season. Gibbs’ rookie contract also expires that year, assuming the Lions pick up his fifth-year option.\nIn Montgomery’s absence, Gibbs is now in line to get the bulk of the carries. He’s also an important part of the passing attack, totaling 395 receiving yards and three touchdowns to go with his 1,047 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns on the ground.\nThe Lions will look to bounce back from their second loss of the season on Sunday when they take on the Chicago Bears. That game kicks off at 1 p.m. ET.",

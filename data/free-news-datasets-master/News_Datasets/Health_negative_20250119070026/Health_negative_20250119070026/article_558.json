    "text": "VDH inspections reveal years-long issues inside Colonial Heights nursing home\nCOLONIAL HEIGHTS, Va. (WWBT) -Colonial Heights Police confirm they have now taken 16 nursing home employees into custody and are searching for two more in connection with [an investigation](https://www.12onyourside.com/2024/12/18/multiple-arrests-made-rehab-center-colonial-heights/) into the [Colonial Heights Rehabilitation and Nursing Center](https://colonialheightshc.com/).\nPolice say the arrests stem from an investigation of an elder abuse complaint from the Virginia Department of Adult Protective Service in October.\nThe [Virginia Department of Health](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/) confirms that its Office of Licensure and Certification is also investigating the nursing center. It already has reports from two surprise inspections in 2023 and one in August.\n12 On Your Side got a hold of those reports in response to complaints. The one from April 2023 focuses mainly on failures around COVID-19 protocols, as vaccines were not properly administered. Second doses of boosters were not given out.\nThe report also details staff failing to notify people properly when residents tested positive.\nVDH also found patients were not getting their medicine on time or at all. Patients with cognitive and physical issues were not given the help they needed. There was a repeated failure to develop patient baseline care plans and follow through with those plans.\nThe reports also explain problems with patient-on-patient abuse and a failure to handle the situations appropriately. The findings show staff inadequately trained on how to respond.\nThe reports did not cover the alleged abuse that led to a patient’s death earlier this fall and charges being filed against 18 nursing home employees on Wednesday.\n“These charges include over seven counts of felony abuse and neglect of vulnerable adults, two counts of misdemeanor abuse and neglect of a vulnerable adult and two counts of obstructions as well as 27 counts of falsifying patient records,” Attorney General Jason Miyares said.\nMiyares credits a tip and his Elder Abuse Task Force for the arrests. He now emphasizes the importance of if you see something, say something.\n“That was designed to approve that type of local jurisdiction cooperation in order to investigate cases exactly like these and then also pull our resources together to be able to prosecute these elder abuse cases. And so, we think this is the first of many that you’re going to see because the best way to fight bad information is with good information,” he said.\n12 On Your Side called the Colonial Heights Rehabilitation and Nursing Center on Thursday and was only told they were aware of the events and were cooperating with law enforcement.\nDelegate Mike Cherry says the center has already named a new administrator, and the director of nursing and state officials have been at the facility.\nPerson charged | Charges |\n---|---|\nChristine Gentry | Falsifying patient records (x5) |\nShawanda Jeter (facility director) | - Abuse and neglect of vulnerable adults - Resisting or obstructing execution of legal process |\nDanyell Berberich | Falsifying patient records |\nKatiema Booker | Falsifying patient records |\nDanielle Harris | Abuse and neglect of vulnerable adults |\nKamesha Kittrell (outstanding warrant) | Abuse and neglect of vulnerable adults (x3) |\nPaulette Landes (outstanding warrant) | Resisting or obstructing execution of legal process |\nShakima Brewer | - Abuse and neglect of vulnerable adults - Falsifying patient records (x5) |\nMonica Pickering-Harris | Falsifying patient records |\nMiracle Austin | Falsifying patient records |\nVoncelia White | Falsifying patient records |\nAshley Webb | Falsifying patient records |\nRugiatu Contech | Falsifying patient records |\nShacary Faison | Falsifying patient records |\nPaola Ho-Arias | Falsifying patient records |\nNichole Overfield | Falsifying patient records |\nLakisha Young-Johnson | Falsifying patient records |\nRochelle Allen | Falsifying patient records |\nCopyright 2024 WWBT.

Both of us enjoyed the creation of this game and this is the first game we ever made and released.\nWe hope you all enjoy playing it.\nWithout further delay!\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nFEATURES & SCREENSHOTS\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________~ Player's Choice\n- A majority of in game outcomes are solely dependent on your choices alone.\nWhat you say, do and decide will dictate your future, just like real life.\n~ Character Stats\n- Stats such as Intelligence, Strength, Charm and Skill\nare all calculated based on your choices in game. These stats also determine what\nyou as an individual are capable of. Make a choice, and you'll see one of these stats effected.\nIntelligence - Determines how smart the player is. It is needed to ascend to higher rank classes and discover the unknown.\nStrength - Determines how physically strong the player is. It is needed to move, make or break objects!\nCharm - Determines how attractive the player is. It is needed to increase success when flirting and to encounter Legendary Pokemon!\nSkill - Determines the player's abilities as a Pokemon trainer. It is needed to unlock more wild Pokemon and Trainers to battle!\n~ Energy - A character stat that determines how many actions you are able to do in a day. Various activities will consume your Energy.\nYou will be notified once your Energy is low, and once it is low enough, you will have the choice to sleep and start the next day.\n~ Interactions - Not necessarily a character stat, but still effected by player actions. It determines the game's time of day.\nEssentially, the more interactions you make in a day, the more time has passed. It is reset everyday.\n~ Reputation - Positive and Negative alignment based on your choices in game. Some may be good, others not so much.\nThe same person may say different things to you depending on your level of Reputation.\n~ Academy Perks - Winning Club activities will grant you different perks that are permanent!\nThere are 13 in total but you can only have two so choose wisely!\n~ NPC Affinity - Some of the NPC's in your class are students you can bond with. These NPC's will give you a variety of things.\nTheir affinity with you is displayed when interacted with. You may talk and battle with them daily, and will be able to unlock future interactions as well.\n~ Schooling System - You are at an academy with your own dorm room. You are expected to complete homework on time and attend class Monday - Friday.\nFailure to do so will result in a detention. Getting enough Detentions and skipping detentions skipped will ultimately lead to your expulsion.\n~ Multiple Save Files - You are able to have up to 8 different savefiles!\nThis gives you the option to see and experience the many different choices and outcomes available in Pokemon Pathways without having to lose your main progress!\nHere's a video made by me doing a quick overview of the 9.0 update\nShout to all the people who went out of their way to make videos showcasing the game!\nGAME DOWNLOAD\n____________________________________________________________________________________\nThank you for everyone who has downloaded the game and tested the alpha up to this point, and also to everyone who will download from this point on.\nThere shouldn't be anything wrong with this latest release, but of course if there is feel free to comment about it here and we'll get to it ASAP.\nAgain, Thank You for Playing!\nCHANGELOGShout to all the people who went out of their way to make videos showcasing the game!\nSpoiler:\nGAME DOWNLOAD\n____________________________________________________________________________________\nThank you for everyone who has downloaded the game and tested the alpha up to this point, and also to everyone who will download from this point on.\nThere shouldn't be anything wrong with this latest release, but of course if there is feel free to comment about it here and we'll get to it ASAP.\nAgain, Thank You for Playing!\nPokemon Pathways Alpha 9.0.3 Google drive DownloadNOTE!

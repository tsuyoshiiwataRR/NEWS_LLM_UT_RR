    "text": "GREEN BAY (WLUK) -- A presumptive human case of bird flu [has been recorded in Wisconsin](https://fox11online.com/news/state/wisconsin-reports-first-presumptive-human-case-of-bird-flu-in-barron-county-avian-sickness-poultry-cdc-hygiene-birds-wild-domestic-contagious-virus#) and it's causing changes in how officials think we should engage with our winged friends.\nBird flu, also known as avian flu, is spreading rapidly nationwide and infiltrating other animal populations.\nBrown County is likely [seeing a return](https://fox11online.com/newsletter-daily/howard-officials-report-bird-flu-resurgence-after-dozens-of-dead-geese-found-in-quarry-duck-creek-quarry-avian-flu-wisconsin-dnr) of the bird flu, after [more than a dozen geese were found dead](https://fox11online.com/newsletter-daily/howard-officials-report-bird-flu-resurgence-after-dozens-of-dead-geese-found-in-quarry-duck-creek-quarry-avian-flu-wisconsin-dnr) in Howard in the last 10 days -- some of which still remain on the partially-frozen Duck Creek Quarry as of Thursday afternoon.\nâ€œFrom what we've found, they're showing the similar signs -- the loss of head and neck control. The ones we've picked up that have passed away did have the single cataract. I would say very close that it is bird flu, preliminarily. We're not going to know for sure until the lab results come back,\" said Matt Atkinson, Howard's animal control officer.\nBay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary is [adjusting to protect their captive bird population](https://fox11online.com/news/local/bay-beach-wildlife-sanctuary-restricts-trail-access-ends-corn-sales-amid-bird-flu-concern-avian-raptor-trail-observation-building-waterfowl-patients-wisconsin-dnr) and avoid potential spread. On social media, the organization said:\nDue to the recent suspected illnesses in wild waterfowl, Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary has decided to stop selling corn and allowing public to walk around our Raptor Trail until further notice.\nThe post goes on to say that for now, the rehab center will not be accepting any waterfowl patients, and to contact the DNR Wildlife Hotline if you have concerns about wild geese or ducks.\nSo for now, the ducks and geese at the Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary will have to look elsewhere for some extra food.\nIf you find a duck or goose that appears injured or sick -- don't touch it. Call the Wisconsin DNR hotline at (608) 267-0866.",

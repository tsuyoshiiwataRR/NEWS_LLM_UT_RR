    "text": "Ready for a reality check? Some foods that seem like healthy choices are actually packed with hidden sugars, fats, and artificial ingredients. From sneaky snacks to so-called “diet” meals, these 12 foods might be sabotaging your efforts without you even knowing it.\nFruit Juices Image Credit: Shutterstock. I was one of the many people who believed the lie that fruit juice was healthy. Although it’s not harmful in small amounts, even natural fruit juice has a lot of sugar. One forum member stated, “It might be worth mentioning that the fruit juices you buy in supermarkets and fresh fruit juices are very different.”\nDried Fruits Image Credit: Shutterstock. Dried fruits may seem like a healthy snack, but they’re often packed with extra sugars and preservatives to improve flavor and shelf life. While they still have nutrients, the sugar content can outweigh the benefits, making them less healthy than their fresh counterparts.\nProtein Bars Image Credit: Shutterstock. A few brands of protein bars are healthy and made with nutritious ingredients. However, many are filled with chemicals and are highly processed, making them more like expensive candy bars than nutritious snacks.\nVeggie Straws Image Credit: Shutterstock. People act like veggie straws are much healthier than potato chips, but they’re usually just potatoes in another form. Veggie straw manufacturers typically use vegetable powder to dye their other colors.\nGranola Bars Image Credit: Shutterstock. There are many granola bars, but most are a step away from being candy bars due to the sugar content. And don’t even get me started on the Nature Valley granola bars, where you’ll get more crumbs on the floor than in your mouth!\nInstant Oatmeal Image Credit: Shutterstock. While I personally use instant oatmeal packets for convenience, I know they’re not a healthy choice compared to making oatmeal with fresh, plain oats. Instant oatmeal packets typically have some sugar or fake sugar, flavorings, and other additives.\nFake Meat Image Credit: Corrie Cooks. If you’re vegan or vegetarian, you may feel like you don’t have a choice other than eating fake meat. You may even be okay with the ingredients in them. However, a common misconception is that meatless alternatives are automatically healthy because they don’t have meat.\nZero Sugar or Diet Soda Image Credit: Shutterstock. One person mentioned that their coworker “guzzles liters of Coke Zero daily because she says it has zero sugar.” This is a common occurrence, and many people become dependent on zero-sugar sodas without considering the amount of fake sugar, chemicals, or caffeine they’re consuming.\nSalads Image Credit: Shutterstock. Although salads are a great way to get a few servings of vegetables, not all salads are equal. Simply attesting that a salad is healthy doesn’t work when covered in fried chicken, bacon, cheese, and heavy, creamy dressing, for example.\nVegetable Oils Image Credit: Shutterstock. An informative comment specified, “Their emergence on the market 100 years ago is the biggest change in the human diet since the introduction of agriculture. They are found in virtually all processed foods. They are obesogenic, inflammatory, associated with the cell death of neurons, raise blood pressure, etc.”\nFat-Free Foods Image Credit: Shutterstock. Many “fat-free” or “low-fat” alternative snacks and foods might have fewer calories or lower fat content, but they’re filled with other additives and chemicals. It would likely be better for most people to consume a smaller amount of a full-fat item than to focus on fat-free foods. You should speak with your doctor if you are concerned about your diet’s fat content.\nRice Cakes Image Credit: Shutterstock. Rice cakes are often marketed as a low-calorie snack, but they lack significant nutrients. They’re mostly made of refined carbs and can cause blood sugar spikes, leaving you feeling hungry soon after eating them. You’re better off choosing snacks with fiber and protein to keep you full longer.\nSource: Reddit .\n12 Discontinued Foods We’d Do Anything to Taste Again Image Credit: Shutterstock.

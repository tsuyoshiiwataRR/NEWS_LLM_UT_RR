    "text": "By Jason Kotowski ,\n2 hours ago\nBAKERSFIELD, Calif. (KGET) — A man found guilty of felony DUI charges in connection with a 2022 crash that injured a husband and wife was sentenced Wednesday to a year in jail and five years of probation.\nIf he fails to comply with probation terms, Sean Tokash will be sentenced to five years and four months in custody, according to the District Attorney’s Office.\nTokash, 25, was convicted last month of two counts of DUI causing injury.\nOn April 23, 2022, Tokash ran a red light as he traveled north on Calloway Drive and collided with another vehicle at Olive Drive. A couple in the other vehicle suffered injuries including broken vertebrae.\nKern County Fire Department retires H408 after 24 years of service Two children in the back seat of the couple’s vehicle were unharmed.\nTests revealed Tokash’s blood-alcohol content at 0.089 and 0.095%, prosecutors said.\nHis probation terms include the following: checking in with a probation officer; completing substance abuse and DUI programs; submitting to searches for alcohol and undergoing blood-alcohol testing; paying restitution; and not possessing or drinking alcohol, or going to bars.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "text": "Ballari: Following the deaths of lactating mothers, the district hospital witnessed a substantial decrease in deliveries over the past six weeks. Concerned about the situation at the govt facility, expectant mothers are now opting for private hospitals to ensure safer deliveries.\\\"The district hospital typically averages over 550 deliveries each month, but this has now fallen to less than 300. For example, there were 585 deliveries in September and 577 in Oct, but only 289 in Nov,\\\" according to information from the district hospital. Dr Basareddy, the District Surgeon, also confirmed that the number of deliveries decreased by 50% following recent maternal deaths.Previously, the govt district hospital was renowned for its high standards of care. Patients from neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana sought treatment here due to the excellent service provided by the medical staff. The facility gained prominence as the preferred choice for childbirth among wives of IAS and IPS officers, judges, and various elected representatives.According to an anonymous physician, the district hospital was honoured with various awards from both the central and state govts. However, the alarming number of deaths among lactating mothers raised concerns among the public regarding the safety of delivering babies at this hospital.Many doctors voiced similar concerns. It is not just the public; many medical professionals at the district hospital are also troubled by the fatalities among nursing mothers. \\\"These deaths have tarnished the reputation of the entire hospital. We are receiving stringent directives, and there is a palpable sense of anxiety among us,\\\" lamented several doctors.Former patients of the district hospital and BIMS hospitals are now seeking care at private facilities. Private maternity hospitals in the city are operating at full capacity. While private hospital administrators are reluctant to share precise figures, the increased presence of pregnant women at these facilities indicates the shift.\\\"To mitigate risks, we decided to admit our daughter-in-law to this private hospital,\\\" explains Srinivasalu of Hosapete. \\\"Although the delivery expenses are quite high, the safety it provides is worth it.\\\" On the other hand, Dr Basareddy insists that this is a temporary issue. \\\"Even amid the turmoil, we managed 75 deliveries in our hospital by Dec 14. The district hospital still offers excellent treatment options, and there is no need for the public to be alarmed,\\\" he reassures.",

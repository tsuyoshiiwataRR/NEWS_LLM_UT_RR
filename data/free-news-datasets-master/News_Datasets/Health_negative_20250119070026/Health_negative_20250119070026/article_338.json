    "text": "By Tom Regan ,\n59 minutes ago People who live and work near the Possum Gizzards Thrift Store in Forsyth County are reacting to a raid that resulted in three arrests and the seizure of methamphetamine, fentanyl, and over a dozen firearms.\n“I think I was more scared about the guns being over there than anything. That’s a lot of guns,” Dawn Pendley said.\nShe works at a business next to the thrift store and watched as a SWAT team surrounded the shuttered shop last Wednesday. She saw deputies arrest three people including a woman.\n“It’s a little scary,” Pendley told Channel 2’s Tom Regan.\nAccording to the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office, Carl Wilford was arrested and charged with possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, possession of Fentanyl with intent to distribute, possession of a firearm and hindering the apprehension of an escaped person.\nTRENDING STORIES:\nManhunt called off for ‘armed and dangerous’ suspect with AR-15 after chase, GSP K-9 shot Fani Willis, Fulton DA’s Office removed from President-elect Donald Trump’s case in Georgia Big Lots to start going out of business sales at all remaining locations Joshua Massie is charged with possession of methamphetamine and hindering the apprehension of an escaped person.\nBrianna McCarthy is charged with possession of methamphetamine, and ID fraud. Authorities say she was wanted in Gwinnett County after escaping from jail two years ago.\nThe manager of a gas station across Canton Highway from the thrift store told Regan she wasn’t surprised to see deputies raid the store last week.\n“This community has known for a long time that that’s a meth house. When I got here in the morning, 3 o’clock every morning, they were out there with flashlights. I think it’s great they finally got them, because they got them off the streets, got fentanyl off the streets which is killing people. But not only that, they got a fugitive,” store manager Bobbi Shepard said.\n[SIGN UP: WSB-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter ]\n2",

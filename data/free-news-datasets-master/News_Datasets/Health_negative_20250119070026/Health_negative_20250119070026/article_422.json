    "text": "Legislation from pharmacists likely in 2025, Insurance Department lawyer says By: Sonny Albarado - December 19, 2024 5:06 pm Booth Rand, general counsel at the Arkansas Insurance Department, (right) answers a question from a lawmaker during a legislative subcommittee meeting on Dec. 19, 2024. He is seated with (left to right) Allison Hatfield, chief of staff for the state Department of Commerce, Jake Windley, director of legislative affairs and policies for the department of commerce, and Alan McClain, Arkansas Insurance Commissioner. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)\nArkansas lawmakers on Thursday rejected a proposed rule that would have allowed pharmacists to be paid a dispensing fee by drug middlemen who reimburse them for prescription costs.\nMembers of the Administrative Rules subcommittee of the Arkansas Legislative Council spent about two hours questioning the Insurance Department’s legal counsel about the necessity for the proposal before rejecting it by voice vote. There was at least one audible dissent.\nThe rule would have allowed the insurance commissioner to determine the amount health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) would have to tack on to reimbursements to pharmacists, department legal counsel Booth Rand told lawmakers Thursday.\nThe dispensing fee could range from zero to a maximum of $10 based on data collected from PBMs and other interested parties, Rand said. An earlier survey of health plans projected an increase in health premiums between 3% and 4% if the dispensing fee was $9.\nThe rule was intended to replace an emergency rule approved in September that expires in mid-January. The emergency measure authorized the Insurance Department to review reimbursement rates to “ensure that pharmacies will at least be paid [federally determined] minimums” and to add a dispensing fee if the commissioner determines a pharmacy’s reimbursement “is not fair and reasonable.” A 2015 state law regulating PBMs, requires reimbursements to be “fair and reasonable” but doesn’t define the term.\nIn response to a question from Rep. Matthew Shepherd, R-El Dorado, Rand said the department has the authority to collect the data without the rule, “but if the commissioner decided to impose a fee, the PBMs could object that there’s no rule in place authorizing it.”\nPBMs are companies that negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers.\nThe nation’s three largest PBMs — CVS Caremark, OptumRX and Express Scripts — are owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the prescription market in the United States, according to a Federal Trade Commission interim study released in July.\nCurrent PBM practices are “unfair and unreasonable, not only to independent pharmacies but chain pharmacies as well,” Rep. Stephanie Flowers, D-Pine Bluff, said Thursday. Ultimately, this affects “our constituents,” patients who don’t know who to complain to if their pharmacy closes or they have an issue with prescription payments by their insurer, she said.\n“When you control 80% of the prescriptions,” Flowers said of PBMs, “you have control over determining the formularies, you silence your pharmacists who must contract with you because you control all of the prescriptions, you own pharmacies, you own insurance companies … How do we ensure what is fair and reasonable within the law since they basically control the business, control the market, control reimbursements?”\nAllison Hatfield, Commerce Department chief of staff, responded, “We see this rule as a mechanism to enforce the fair and reasonable language in the law.”\nAsked by subcommittee co-chair Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, how that would increase the cost of business, Hatfield replied “there would be no change,” if a PBM is paying a fair and reasonable reimbursement rate.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.",

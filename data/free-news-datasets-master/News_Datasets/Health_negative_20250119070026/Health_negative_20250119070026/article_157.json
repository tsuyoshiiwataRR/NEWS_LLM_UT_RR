    "text": "News Seafood Recall in More Than 15 States Over Norovirus Fears—What You Need to Know By Jenna Anderson Published on December 19, 2024 Close wilatlak villette / Getty Images Two separate seafood recalls were issued this week for potential norovirus contamination.The two recalls include oysters and Manila clams from Rudy's Shellfish, and oysters sold as Fanny Bay, Buckley Bay, and Royal Miyagi Oysters.The FDA says to throw away the recalled shellfish and monitor for common symptoms of norovirus, like diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea. Oysters and clams have been recalled over potential norovirus contamination, the Food and Drug Administration announced this week. On Monday, the FDA warned restaurants, food retailers, and consumers in seven states not to eat or sell oysters and Manila clams from Rudy’s Shellfish in Washington. Then on Wednesday, the FDA issued another recall in 15 states for oysters sold as Fanny Bay, Buckley Bay, and Royal Miyagi Oysters from British Columbia, Canada. Here's what you need to know about the two shellfish recalls and norovirus in seafood. Oyster and Manila Clam Recall Last week, Rudy’s Shellfish voluntarily recalled oysters and Manila clams harvested from Nov. 15 to Dec. 11 from Pickering Passage growing area in Washington. The shellfish are potentially contaminated with norovirus, which can cause gastrointestinal illness if consumed. The recall did not mention any reported illnesses connected to the oysters and clams. The FDA is advising restaurants and food retailers not to serve or sell the recalled shellfish, and to dispose of them and wash any surfaces or items they may have come in contact with. Consumers should also throw away the recalled oysters and clams. Affected States ArizonaCaliforniaFloridaMassachusettsMichiganNew YorkWashington Oyster Recall Also last week, S&M Shellfish Co. in San Francisco, California voluntarily recalled oysters harvested from Dec. 1 to Dec. 9 from several growing areas in British Columbia, Canada. These oysters—sold under brands Fanny Bay, Buckley Bay, and Royal Miyagi Oysters—were also recalled over potential norovirus contamination, and there was no mention of reported illnesses in the recall. The recalled oysters can be identified by the following information on the shellfish tag: Original Harvester/Producer: Pacific Northwest Shellfish and Union Bay SeafoodCert. Numbers: BC 740 SP and BC 6001 SP Dates of Harvest: 12/01/24 to 12/09/24 The FDA is advising restaurants, food retailers, and consumers to throw away these affected oysters as well, and to clean any potentially contaminated items and surfaces.

Stomach Bugs Basically Disappeared During COVID Lockdowns—Now They May Be Surging Back Norovirus in Seafood Norovirus—sometimes called \"food poisoning\" or the \"stomach flu\"—is an extremely contagious virus that can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Eating raw or partially cooked shellfish—specifically bivalve shellfish like clams, geoducks, mussels, scallops, and oysters—can cause norovirus if the shellfish is contaminated. Most norovirus outbreaks from shellfish come from oysters, since they're typically eaten raw. Though shellfish may not be the first thing you think of as carriers of norovirus, it's due to the environment they live in. Marine environments become contaminated with norovirus through untreated human sewage—when poop and vomit containing norovirus particles are in the water, the shellfish can absorb them, building up the virus in their bodies. When humans eat the contaminated shellfish, they can become infected with norovirus. How to Spot Norovirus and Prevent Its Spread The FDA urges that shellfish contaminated with norovirus will not smell or taste differently. Consumers who suspect they may have eaten the recalled shellfish should monitor for common symptoms of norovirus, including diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain. Fever, headaches, and body aches are also common. Norovirus symptoms typically appear 12 to 48 hours after eating the contaminated food and clear up within three days. The virus can spread from direct contact with someone with norovirus, so be sure to stay home and wash your hands often if you feel symptoms. You can still spread norovirus for about two weeks after you stop feeling sick. Anyone can get sick from a norovirus infection, no matter their age. Some groups—children younger than 5 years old, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems—are more likely to develop severe infections. People who often eat raw oysters or undercooked shellfish are also at an increased risk of norovirus. Shellfish-related norovirus illnesses are also more common in winter months (November through March), since norovirus survives longer in colder water.

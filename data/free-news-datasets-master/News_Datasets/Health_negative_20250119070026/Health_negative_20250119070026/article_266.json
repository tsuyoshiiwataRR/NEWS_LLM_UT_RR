    "text": "Mumbai: In the Kurla BEST bus accident, the death toll has risen to nine after one more injured victim succumbed to injuries during treatment at Sion Hospital. Mehatab Shaikh, 22, a resident of Govandi, was pronounced dead at 11.45 am on Thursday.\nMeanwhile, the Maharashtra Motor Vehicles Department has initiated the process to revoke the driving licence of Sanjay More, the bus driver involved in the accident on December 9, which left 40 others injured. The Regional Transport Office (RTO) at Wadala, overseeing Mumbai’s eastern suburbs, issued a show-cause notice to More earlier this week, beginning the procedure to cancel his licence.\nInitially issued a licence for light motor vehicles in 1990, More’s licence was upgraded in 1991 to include heavy vehicles like buses and trucks. Additionally, he held a driver’s badge for public service vehicles since 1999.\nThe decision to revoke his licence follows a request from the Mumbai police, who recommended this action due to the severity of the accident. Once revoked, More will be barred from driving any vehicle.\n<a href=\"https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/kurla-bus-accident-maharashtra-motor-vehicles-department-initiates-process-to-revoke-driving-license-of-sanjay-more\">Kurla Bus Accident: Maharashtra Motor Vehicles Department Initiates Process To Revoke Driving...\n</a>\nMore, employed by a third-party agency supplying drivers to Evey Trans, a subsidiary of electric bus manufacturer Olectra, had been driving BEST’s mini-buses before being assigned to operate the 12mt e-bus involved in the crash.",

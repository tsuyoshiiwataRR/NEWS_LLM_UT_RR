In contrast some fairly weak security that everybody just uses reflexively is fairly effective. And, you can get people used to the idea that they've \"always\" insisted on security, because that was the default, which makes ratcheting the security a plausible direction once you've got them on board.\nA solution that's \"perfect\" but actually nobody will use isn't perfect it's useless.

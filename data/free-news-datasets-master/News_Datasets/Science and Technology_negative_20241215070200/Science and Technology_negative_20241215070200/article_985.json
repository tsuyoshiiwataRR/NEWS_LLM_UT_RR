    "text": "Ford Slows EV Production: \"Rapidly Deteriorating Market Conditions\"\n[Chase Bierenkoven](IC: )\n[Share]\nPer German news outlet [Automobilewoche](https://www.automobilwoche.de/autohersteller/kurzarbeit-bei-ford-koln), Ford’s European arm is cutting EV output at its Cologne, Germany, factory. A company spokesperson cited “rapidly deteriorating market conditions for electric vehicles” that have put the brakes on Capri and Explorer production across the Atlantic. Very recently, Ford put a whopping $2 billion into the plant to ready it for electric vehicle production. Workers at the plant are also affected by the idling, working in alternating weeks until Christmas.\nThese production stoppages are not solely limited to Europe. On our side of the Atlantic, Ford is pausing production of the F-150 Lightning from November 15 to January 6, 2025, while dealers work through existing inventory. In simpler terms, a lack of EV demand, at least at Ford, has caused global production stoppages.\nBecome an AutoGuide insider.

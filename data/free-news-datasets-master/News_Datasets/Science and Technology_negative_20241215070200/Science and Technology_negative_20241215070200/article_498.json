    "text": "By Vinay Simlot ,\n13 hours ago\nWASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) -Astronaut Suni Williams, who is stuck on the International Space Station for months longer than originally planned, is responding to claims she’s losing weight.\n“There’s some rumors around out there that I’m losing weight and stuff,” Williams said. “No, I’m actually right at the same amount.”\nWilliams said she weighs herself on the ISS, and eats well.\n“Our food lab does a great job giving us, not only food that tastes good, but is also really nutritionally balanced,” Williams said.\nAn article from the DailyMail said Williams looked “gaunt.” The New York Post described Williams as “noticeably thinner.”\nWilliams and her fellow astronaut Butch Wilmore launched on the Boeing Starliner capsule in June. The trip was originally planned for eight days. After thruster failures and helium leaks, NASA elected to bring Williams and Wilmore down on a SpaceX Dragon capsule next year.\nNASA leaders said because of the longer mission, Williams and Wilmore started a new exercise routine.\n“Weight lifting, which is not something I do all the time, has definitely changed me,” Williams said. “My thighs are a little bit bigger. My butt is a little bit bigger.”\nOn the last mission that returned to Earth last month, NASA said one of the astronauts had a medical issue and spent the night in the hospital.\nNASA has not said who the astronaut was and is still gathering information.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

According to Robin Zeng, Elon Musk does not understand battery production. CATL CEO and founder Robin Zeng disagrees with Tesla CEO Elon Musk's work style and directly attacked his “recipe” for battery production. Writes UNN with reference to The Verge. Robin Zeng, founder of the world's largest electric vehicle battery company, says Tesla CEO Elon Musk's big bet on 4,680-cell technology will “fail and never succeed. “It will fail and will never succeed.” We had a big discussion and I showed him that. He was silent. He doesn't know how to make a battery. It's all electrochemistry. He is good at chips, software, hardware, mechanical things,” said CATL's CEO. Elon Musk did not respond to Zeng's comments. However, it is known that the industry is currently facing numerous challenges, such as extending the service life and preventing wear and tear during use so that the car can last up to 12 years, the time during which a consumer typically changes vehicles.

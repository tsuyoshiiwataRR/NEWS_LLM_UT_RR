    "text": "On the 15th, ‌Rodong Sinmun, the ⁢organ of ⁢the​ North Korean Workers’ ‌Party, reported, “Comrade Kim Jong-un‌ led the performance test of various self-destructive⁤ attack drones produced by research institutes and enterprises under the Unmanned Aerial Technology Association on the 14th.”⁣ (Pyongyang Rodong Sinmun‍ = News 1) North ⁢Korean Workers’ Party General Secretary Kim‍ Jong-un led performance tests of suicide attack drones and ordered “mass production.” It has been three months since the self-destruction drone performance test was inspected last August.\nOn the 15th, the Labor Party’s official newspaper, Rodong‌ Sinmun, reported, “On the 14th, Comrade Kim Jong-un‍ led local performance tests of ​various suicide attack-type drones produced by research institutes and enterprises under the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Technology Association.”\nSecretary General Kim expressed ‌satisfaction​ with the tactical and technical characteristics and specifications of the developed unmanned aerial vehicles and ordered, “We will‍ establish an affiliated production system as soon as possible⁣ and begin full-scale mass production.”\n“The‌ competition to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a means of military power‌ is accelerating around the world,” he said. “With low production costs​ and simple production processes, it is becoming easier to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a component of strike power in new areas.” He emphasized that development is an ‘essential requirement’ from a military perspective.\n⁤\nThe newspaper claimed that in this test, various unmanned aerial vehicles flew on tactical routes ‍with ​different strike ranges and made ‘ precision strikes ‘ on targets. ​It is said‍ that these drones can be used both on land and at‌ sea.\nOn this day,⁣ General Secretary Kim evaluated that there was ‘possibility and potential to produce and introduce various unmanned aerial vehicles’ and said, “We will find the prospect of combining and applying new and promising tactical methods in terms of tactical law to suit the needs of modern warfare.”\nOn the 15th, the Rodong Sinmun, the The newspaper reported that on this ‌day, General Secretary Kim said, ⁢“We are continuing to supplement the⁤ line to perfectly combine unmanned armed equipment systems⁣ with ‘operational plans’ and ‘principles of engagement,’” and “expressed the Party ​Central Committee’s plan for the development of unmanned armed equipment.”⁢ “He presented an‍ important strategic policy ‍for its⁢ implementation,” the‍ report said.\nThe ‘Unmanned Aerial Technology Alliance’ visited by General Secretary Kim is a place that​ has⁤ not been highlighted in the⁣ North Korean media so far, and the newspaper said about it, “The Unmanned​ Aerial Technology Alliance is a place where the plenary meetings of ⁣the Party Central Committee and the Party Central Military Committee give decision ⁢orders to the defense logistics ⁤sector.” “We are achieving‌ remarkable results in ‌promoting the things we have done,” he said. It appears to be⁢ an organization that will develop new technologies in the unmanned aerial vehicle sector​ and take charge of mass production in ⁣the future.\nLast August, Secretary General Kim provided field guidance to the Academy of Defense Development’s Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Research Center and urged it to produce‌ more various types of self-destructive‍ UAVs, nuclear torpedoes, and‍ attack-type unmanned aerial ⁢vehicles.\nAccording to⁤ photos released by the newspaper that ‌day, a drone blew up a ⁢tank⁢ and a car. Additionally, some of the drones appear to be similar to those unveiled last August.\nOn the same day, General Secretary Kim provided on-site guidance to the local industrial factory construction site‍ in Jaeryeong-gun,⁢ South Hwanghae Province and ordered, “We must enter ⁣production and produce results as soon as construction is completed.”\nSecretary⁤ General Kim toured the construction ⁤sites‌ of food factories and daily necessities factories, inspecting construction patterns and equipment manufacturing and assembly conditions.\nAs the end ⁤of the year approaches,⁢ General Secretary ‍Kim said, “It is ‌important for all constructors to increase⁢ their\n“The quality level must be completely guaranteed,”​ he emphasized.\nIn⁢ addition, ‌“This project should not ‌be purely about summarizing performance,” he said. “We must manufacture at the highest quality level and responsibly conduct ⁤installation and test runs ⁣to ensure​ full operation and full load of all facilities ‌from ⁢the ⁤first stage of factory operation.” He ⁢emphasized.\nAt the same time, it is said that directions and methods to solve⁢ problems related to operational preparation were also presented.\nThe newspaper‌ reported that Cho Yong-won, Kim Yong-su, ⁢Kim Yo-jong,​ Park Seong-cheol, and People’s Army ⁤General General Park Gwang-ju​ accompanied the Jaeryeong-gun field guidance, and were greeted ⁢by local industrial minister Cho Yong-cheol, the responsible secretary of the Jaeryeong County Committee of South Hwanghae Province, the ⁢chairman of the‌ People’s Committee, and commanders ‍of ‌military units mobilized for construction.\nThis year, General Secretary Kim presented the ‘Local Development 20 As this is the first year, it appears that they are directly inspecting this project​ and urging ​results.\nWhat are the potential consequences of North Korea’s increased focus ‍on military drone technology? Interview between Time.news Editor and ‌Military Drone Expert\nTime.news Editor: ‍Welcome ⁢to our feature interview, where we delve into significant developments in global security and defense ​technology. Today, we’re⁤ joined by Dr. Sarah Choi, a leading expert in military drone technology. Dr. Choi, thank you for⁢ being⁣ here.\nDr. Choi: Thank you⁢ for having⁤ me! It’s a pleasure to⁤ discuss this vital topic.\nEditor: Let’s dive right in. Recently, North Korea’s ⁤state media ‌reported‌ that Kim Jong-un is pushing for the mass ‌production​ of suicide attack drones. This⁣ follows performance tests he led, which ⁤seemed to demonstrate the drones’ combat capabilities. Given the global race for UAV ⁤technology, what does⁢ this mean for military strategy in the region?\nDr. ‌Choi: ‍ It underscores a significant shift in modern ⁤warfare paradigms. North Korea is not just ⁤ramping up its capabilities but also signaling to the world⁢ that it’s serious about using UAVs as a core component of its military strategy. The low production costs and ​the relative ease of deploying drones make⁤ them an increasingly attractive option for militaries, especially in asymmetric warfare scenarios.\nEditor: The report emphasized ⁢the drones’ ability to operate on land and‌ at⁤ sea. ⁢How critical is this versatility for military operations?\nDr.⁢ Choi: ‌Extremely critical.

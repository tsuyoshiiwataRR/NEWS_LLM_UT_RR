However, so far, players aren’t impressed with the changes, claiming that the update is a “massive downgrade” on what came before.\nEvery year, Warzone integrates with the latest Call of Duty multiplayer , bringing shared progression and a boatload of changes to the game. This often means that each chapter looks and feels drastically different than what came before.\nArticle continues after ad Black Ops 6 is no exception, as it brings the omnimovement system as well as the classic Prestige progression system to Warzone for the first time. However, despite the many changes, players feel this is a step back, not forward.\nReddit user ‘iWant12Tacos’ called this new chapter of Warzone a “massive downgrade” before listing a handful of issues in Season 1 .\n“The graphics, movement, gunplay, UI, literally everything feels like a downgrade,” said the OP. “I wouldn’t really mind if it weren’t for the fact that they took away the Warzone of yesterday and forcing everybody to play this new iteration that’s worse in every way.”\nArticle continues after ad Article continues after ad\nMassive downgrade\nby u/iWant12Tacos in CODWarzone They weren’t alone either, as shortly after Season 1 went live, social media was flooded with posts calling out the update, with the new movement and footstep audio, in particular, coming under fire.\n“What did they do to Warzone? This is the worst version of the game we have had in years,” said one post , while streamer ‘ Tactical Grandma ‘ added: “I have never complained about a new season or map, but this one is hot garbage at the moment. No footstep audio, graphics seem fuzzy, movement feels clunky.”\nRelated: Warzone players claim it’s “unplayable” after MW3 launch Article continues after ad As pointed out by another popular Warzone streamer, IceManIsaac, one of the reasons that movement feels more sluggish is that many of the default Perks have been removed to match multiplayer. This means “slower gun swaps, slower mantles, [and] slower movement while plating/reloading.”\nThe devs decided to remove all default perks in Warzone because they wanted it to feel \"1 to 1\" to multiplayer.\nThat means no overkill, slower gun swaps, slower mantles, slower movement while plating/reloading, & more, unless you use a dedicated perk.\nDo you like this change?\n— Isaac (@IceManIsaac) November 15, 2024 However, although this explains why Warzone feels so different this time around, players still aren’t happy with the change.\nArticle continues after ad “They’ve ruined Warzone. I’ll never play again,” said one angry reply, before another player posted: “Literally the worst change they ever made.”\nArticle continues after ad Given that Warzone is now fully integrated with Black Ops 6, it might be tough for the devs to roll back many of these changes and make Perks like Overkill and Gung-Ho default again. But after seeing the backlash, we’ll have to wait and see if any adjustments are made in future updates.\nkeep reading Call of Duty Warzone players split on massive increase to lobby size Connor Bennett Call of Duty Warzone players call for major changes in MW3 Season 2 and beyond Connor Bennett Call of Duty Warzone players furious as Season 1 Reloaded update ‘breaks’ game: “It’s time to quit” Brad Norton Call of Duty Warzone players sick of “miserable” lobbies as they’ve had enough already Connor Bennett Call of Duty Warzone audio is “best it’s ever been” but there’s still one big problem Kurt Perry Call of Duty Warzone players call for massive changes as they’re already quitting Connor Bennett Call of Duty Warzone players blast “crazy fast” TTK ruining MW3 Season 1 already Connor Bennett Call of Duty Warzone players furious as “awful” audio is already ruining Urkzistan Brianna Reeves Related Topics Warzone About The Author Nathan Warby\nNathan Warby is a Senior Games Writer on Dexerto's UK team, also contributing on our sister website CharlieINTEL.

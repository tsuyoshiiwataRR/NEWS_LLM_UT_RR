    "text": "[United Kingdom](../) Mystery object captured by fighter pilot ‘threatened multiple collisions’ A retired US Navy admiral has given ‘powerful testimony’ about an object filmed moving faster than any known human technology. Dr Tim Gallaudet told a [Congressional committee ](//metro.co.uk/2024/11/13/whistleblower-claims-us-possession-ufo-technology-21988503/)that he was on a Navy exercise off the country’s East Coast when he received an email on a secure internal network headed ‘URGENT SAFETY OF FLIGHT ISSUE’. He described how the ‘brief but alarming’ message referred to ‘multiple near mid-air collisions’ with the mystery object and contained an attachment of what is now known as the [‘go fast’ video ](//metro.co.uk/2023/12/09/enhanced-game-changing-video-casts-new-light-pentagon-ufo-mystery-19942056/)captured on the forward-looking infrared sensor of an F/A-18 jet. The former rear admiral, appearing before the GOP Oversight Committee on [Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena](//metro.co.uk/2021/01/08/ufo-expert-says-clock-is-ticking-on-possible-seismic-revelations-13874364/) (UAP), said he and other commanders were told that if the anomaly was not identified then the pre-deployment exercise, which included the Theodore Rosevelt Carrier Strike Group, would have to be shut down. He told the hearing: ‘The now declassified video showed an unidentified object exhibiting flight and structural characteristics unlike anything in our arsenal. The implication of the email was clear. ‘The author was asking whether any of the recipients were aware of classified technology demonstrations that could explain these objects. ‘Because the DoD policy is to rigorously deconflict such demonstrations with live exercises I was confident this was not the case.’ Dr Galluadet, who is now CEO of Ocean STL Consulting, said that ‘the very next day’ in 2015 the email inexplicably disappeared from his account and those of the other recipients. At the time, he was responsible for ‘safety of flight risks’ for the Navy and was concerned that the pilots were being left to encounter UAPs ‘without guidance or support’. The disclosure advocate concluded that the information was so secret it had been compartmentalised by an intelligence agency at a level which even he had no access to. Giving evidence before the committee in Washington, he called for more scrutiny and transparency of government information about UAP for national security, public safety and socio-economic reasons. The former science agency leader appeared alongside former DoD official [Luis Elizondo,](//metro.co.uk/2024/08/21/pentagon-insider-says-secret-group-collected-alien-remains-50-years-21463523/) former NASA associate Michael Gold and [Michael Shellenberger, ](//metro.co.uk/2024/11/13/whistleblower-claims-us-possession-ufo-technology-21988503/)of the Public news service, at the hearing on Wednesday. Explaining his reasons for going public, Dr Galluadet said: ‘Now we know that UAP are interacting with humanity, and that includes unidentified submerged objects in the ocean, we should not turn a blind eye but instead boldly face this new reality and learn from it. ‘Additionally, at a time when leaders in government leave much to be desired, I feel obligated to show moral leadership on this issue of UAP disclosure by validating the credibility of the courageous men and women who come out as witnesses and whistleblowers to expose the truth.’ Last December, Metro[ told how the video and seven other clips showed UAP at speeds and angles beyond the limits](//metro.co.uk/2023/12/09/enhanced-game-changing-video-casts-new-light-pentagon-ufo-mystery-19942056/) of any known human-made craft. They have been hosted online by the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), a team of experts who are leading the US government’s efforts to address the issue. In the go fast video, an astounded US Navy F/A-18 pilot can be heard shouting ‘woah got it, woohoo!’ as the Hornet jet’s targeting system captures a low-flying circular object during a training flight in 2015. Amid excited radio chatter, he exclaims: ‘What the hell is that?’ A second video filmed the same year by an F/A-18 crew shows a small black blob – seemingly with no propulsion – moving above the cloud base. The object can be seen changing angles, with one pilot saying over the radio: ‘There’s a whole fleet of them, look on the ASA [airborne surveillance and attack system].’ His colleague remarks: ‘They are going against the wind, the wind’s 120 knots to the west.’ The first pilot then exclaims: ‘Look at that thing dude.’ Another sequence in the AARO footage refreshed by UK-based videographer Evan Brindle shows a mystery object flashing by a Navy fighter jet pilot’s cockpit during a flight in 2021. The unexplained anomaly is almost too fast to see in the colour video, but freeze-framing shows a small, metallic-type object with a white blob, possibly from the sun’s reflection. The AARO has said that the clip ‘demonstrates the typical speed at which military aircraft may approach an unknown object’. In another video, shot from an MQ-9 Reaper drone, a silver, orb-like object is shown flying over sparsely populated desert terrain in the Middle East. Filmed in December 2022 at an undisclosed location, the object was not exhibiting ‘anomalous behaviour’ – such as propulsion beyond known technology – but remains unidentified, according to the AARO. The other cases involving fighter pilots are unresolved. [Nick Pope](//metro.co.uk/2021/01/08/ufo-expert-says-clock-is-ticking-on-possible-seismic-revelations-13874364/), who investigated UFOs for the UK Ministry of Defence, told Metro: ‘Tim Gallaudet is an unimpeachable witness – a dedicated professional of the highest integrity. His powerful testimony deepens the mystery over the go fast video and adds important new details. ‘It shows that the very people best able to judge the most advanced US military technologies — by virtue of the fact that they were testing and exercising with them — were foxed by these events, and couldn’t reconcile what was being seen and filmed with anything in their inventory. ‘These same people also know, from intelligence gathering, the likely extent of aircraft, missile and drone technologies in the possession of adversaries such as China or Russia.’ Mr Pope pointed to ‘numerous’ similar incidents which he believes should be made public due to the national security implications. ‘It’s one thing to hear such things on internet conspiracy forums, but it’s quite another to hear them in Congress, under oath, from a retired US Navy Admiral,’ he said. ‘If ever an incident highlights the serious defense, national security and flight safety implications of UAP, this is it. ‘And, of course, what we heard in Congress is only the tip of the iceberg. ‘There are numerous similar incidents and associated footage that have yet to be declassified and released.’ The Navy videos were originally leaked into the public domain between 2007 and 2017 before the Department of Defense’s release in 2020. The Pentagon said at the time that the authorised disclosure was ‘to clear up any misconceptions by the public’ about whether the footage was real or ‘whether or not there is more to the videos’. Mr Pope has previously called on the UK government to disclose more about what it knows and is possibly doing about UAP. In response to Freedom of Information Act requests, the Ministry of Defence has not acknowledged any engagement with the US over the issue [but did say it was ‘aware’ of one report](//metro.co.uk/?page_id=19942217&preview_id=19942217) from across the Atlantic. ‘These objects were in restricted airspace and reportedly ran rings around the cutting edge of US aerospace technology,’ Mr Pope said. ‘The US and the UK need to collaborate on a proper reinvestigation of these videos and of other anomalous objects in US and UK airspace. ‘The UK Ministry of Defence has access to world class intelligence community imagery analysis resources and capabilities that can help with this. The US Congress is actively investigating various UFO-related data: photos, videos, documents and whistleblower testimony. ‘The UK is lagging shamefully behind in the quest for the truth about UFOs, but one or two proactive parliamentarians could seize on these new video analyses and use them to reignite the debate about arguably the greatest mystery of the modern era.’ Established in 2022, the AARO aims to ‘mitigate the potential threats to safety and security posed by UAP’ by improving data and reporting. A wide remit held by the office covers ‘objects or devices’ in the air, space and sea which are ‘not yet attributable to known actors’. The MoD’s existing position on UFOs, referring to a now-defunct UFO desk, states: ‘Since 2009 the MoD no longer responds to reported UFO sightings or investigates them as, in over 50 years, no UFO report has revealed any evidence of a potential threat to the United Kingdom. ‘The MOD UFO desk was closed because it served no defence purpose and was taking staff away from more valuable defence-related activities. ‘There was/is no defence benefit in such investigations and therefore, it was, and is, an inappropriate use of defence resources.’ Do you have a story you would like to share?

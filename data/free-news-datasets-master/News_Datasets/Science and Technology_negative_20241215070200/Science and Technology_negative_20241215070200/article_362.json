    "text": "Use the right training strategy to bring every employee on your AI journey The extraordinary capabilities of generative AI (genAI) platforms have captured the business world's imagination – and a growing portion of its IT budgets. Yet even as tech giants work to make genAI technology more accessible, experts warn that companies focused solely on that technology are bound to fail.\nThat's because genAI isn't a silver bullet for every business problem, and simply directing developers and IT leaders to join the stampede towards the technology is unlikely to deliver the benefits that business leaders actually want from the technology.\n\"Organisations have a wide variety of reasons\" for embracing AI, noted James Finley, senior systems trainer with training provider Lumify Work (formerly DDLS in Australia and Auldhouse in New Zealand). Lumify offers a range of AI intensive training courses, including its 8-week CloudUp and AWS Generative AI Accelerator boot camps, AWS Skill Builder on-demand digital training, and AI-related practitioner certifications.\nIn working with early adopters across the ANZ region, Finley has seen companies embracing AI for both internally focused projects – those using the technology to improve internal efficiencies – and those building \"externally facing solutions\" to support customer care and other operations.\n\"Every organisation is different, and it comes down to what their first jumping-off point is,\" Finley said, \"but I am seeing people coming from a wide variety of platforms.\"\nPerhaps instinctively, he noted, early adopters are often technical – data platform experts, infrastructure, sysops or developer team members – with many people doubling up on roles as enthusiastic team members expand their skills in more than one area.\nMany companies \"are looking at people they know and trust internally to get that foothold,\" he explained, \"but when they get some known quantities and start saying that they need more staff, they need someone who understands the business and what they're trying to achieve.\"\nExtending AI…",

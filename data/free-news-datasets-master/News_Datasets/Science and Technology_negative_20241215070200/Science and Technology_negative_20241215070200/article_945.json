    "text": "The Pentagon’s latest report on UFOs has revealed hundreds of new instances of unidentified and unexplained aerial phenomena — including a recent near miss involving a commercial plane and a mysterious “object” near New York.\nThe Empire State close call was among 757 cases of unidentified anomalous phenomena — more commonly known as unidentified flying objects or “UFOs” — reported to US authorities within the past year, according to the annual report released Thursday.\nIn that case, the airline crew had reported to the Federal Aviation Administration that its commercial plane had a “near miss with a ‘cylindrical object’ while over the Atlantic Ocean” just off the coast of New York.\nThe New York incident was among 757 cases of UFOs reported to US authorities within the past year. (The UFO pictured is unrelated to the Empire State case.) AARO/DOD\nIt wasn’t immediately clear when the sighting happened, or which airline was involved.\nThe Pentagon’s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is still investigating the incident, the office’s report stated.\nThe New York instance was also the only case recorded where a “possible flight safety issue” was encountered “during the event,” the report added.\nExplore More Pentagon says nearly two dozen UFO sightings can’t be explained: ‘True anomalies’ Congressional UFO hearing details alleged secret government programs, descriptions of ‘alien’ craft Lauren Boebert probes UFO experts on existence of underwater alien bases on Earth: ‘The American people are being kept in the dark’ Of the hundreds of cases reported, investigators found explanations for nearly 300 of the incidents.\nIn many cases, the unknown objects were later identified as balloons, birds, aircraft, drones or satellites.\nBut hundreds of other apparent sightings remain unexplained — though the report stressed it is often because there isn’t enough information to draw firm conclusions.\nFor witnesses who provided visual descriptions, common reports included unidentified lights or round, spherical or orb-shaped objects.\nOther reports included a witness who reported a jellyfish with flashing lights.\nThe Pentagon’s latest report on UFOs has revealed hundreds of new instances of unidentified and unexplained aerial phenomena made between May 1, 2023, and June 1, 2024. AFP via Getty Images\nElon Musk’s Starlink satellite system was an increasingly common source as people mistake chains of satellites for UFOs, according to the report.\nAARO officials said, though, there’s no indication that any of the cases they looked into have unearthly origins.\n“It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,” the report’s authors wrote.\nThe 757 cases identified in the report were made between May 1, 2023, and June 1, 2024.\nThe total includes 272 incidents that occurred before that period but hadn’t previously been reported to US authorities, the report noted.\nWith Post wires",

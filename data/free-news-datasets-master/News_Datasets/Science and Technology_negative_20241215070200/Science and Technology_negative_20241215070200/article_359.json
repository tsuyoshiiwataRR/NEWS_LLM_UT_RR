    "text": "Trending: No, Figs Are Not Non-Vegetarian Fruits! Here's Debunking The Viral Claim Which Talks Of Wasps Pollination Figs are non-vegetarian – this claim has been all over the internet over the past few days. However, according to food expert Krish Ashok, figs that are commercially produced in India are not pollinated with the help of wasps. Read on to learn more about how figs form and why you should incorporate them into your daily diet. Known for their nutritional benefits like boosting gut health, strengthening muscles, and improving energy levels, figs also reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes “No wasps are involved in commercially produced figs in India,” says food expert Krish Ashok, debunking the viral claims which say that figs are non-vegetarian. In the last few days, social media has been buzzed with news that figs are insect pollinated. Also known as Anjeer, figs are a delicious fruit often consumed in dried form in India. Known for their nutritional benefits like boosting gut health, strengthening muscles, and improving energy levels, figs also reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, many have been worried that the fruit may be non-vegetarian. “All of this is true only if you eat a special variety of figs from Turkey called Smyrna which is pollinated by wasps,” Ashok told his followers in an Instagram reel. “All fruit varieties grown in India are common figs that produce fruit parthenocarpically,” he added. Parthenocarpy is the natural or artificially induced production of fruit without fertilization of ovules, which makes the fruit seedless. “The fruits develop without need for pollination, so no wasps are involved in commercially produced figs in India,” Ashok added. “And if eating figs makes you non-veg, then I have some bad news for you. Even if you eat fancy figs from Turkey, you will at best eat 1-2 mg of insect parts but even otherwise, you are consuming 1000-20000 mg of insects every single day,” said Ashok. Fig varieties commercially grown and sold in India include Poona, Conadria, Mission, Kadota, and Brown Turkey. Why should you add figs to your daily diet? Figs, indigenous to western Asia – the Middle East and Mediterranean regions symbolize longevity and have been consumed since ancient times. The fruit is loaded with fibre, antioxidants, and some amounts of vitamins and minerals. Fig consumption is linked to a number of positive health outcomes, a few of which include: High in antioxidants Both the flesh and skins of figs are loaded with antioxidants – mainly phenolic acids and flavonoids which are absorbed from the digestive system into the bloodstream and have potent anti-inflammatory effects in the body. Regulate digestion The fibre in figs supports bowel regularity as the fruit – high in prebiotics helps feed beneficial probiotic bacteria in the gut tied to anti-inflammation. The fruit is also great for those who have irritable bowel syndrome. Supports menstrual health Eating dried figs helps reduce the symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea – or having painful periods which are usually experienced one or two days per month by more than half of women across the world. Supports weight loss and management Studies say eating figs is associated with having a lower body weight by improving post-meal satiety and blood sugar regulation. Reduces cancer risk The potential effects of figs depend on the ability to inhibit the formation of tumours and the development of cancer cells. Natural compounds in figs also help prevent cancer cells from growing and spreading in the body.

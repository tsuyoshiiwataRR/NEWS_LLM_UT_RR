    "text": "Over 100 million leaked records of business contact information listed on the dark web linked to B2B data aggregator DemandScience might have been stolen from a third party, the company has told ITPro .\nFormerly known as Pure Incubation, DemandScience is an AI-powered B2B demand generation company that helps organizations find potential customers for upcoming campaigns.\nThe firm scrapes the public internet , building an expansive database that marketers and advertisers can use to tailor their strategies and lead generation.\nOn 28 February 2024, a threat actor named ‘KryptonZambie’ listed Pure Incubation on BreachForums , claiming to have a stolen database containing 183 million records for sale.\nThe listing claimed the stolen information contained individuals’ first and last names, business email address, business address, business phone number , job title, and function, all available for $6,000.\nAt the time, the firm denied there was any evidence of a breach to media outlets , adding that its systems remained operational and its systems remained secure.\nThe company refused to confirm or deny if the leaked samples provided by the hacker were legitimate. A few months later in August, KryptonZambie made the stolen data cache available for a few dollars, effectively leaking it for free.",

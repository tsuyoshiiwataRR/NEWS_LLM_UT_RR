    "text": "[misk],no longer accessible inside Russia Fuck Apple for not exiting Russia but the title makes it sound like they removed those globally. [Kusimulkku],Yes, the actual news is the opposite of what the title made me think [JohnDClay],Meaning one's that didn't agree with Russia's official stance, or ones claiming to be independent but still funded by Russia? Those would be very different things. [14th_cylon],if only there would be some way to find out, like reading the article... U.S. technology giant Apple has reportedly removed or hidden several Russian-language podcasts produced by independent journalists. The news outlet Mediazona reported on November 14 that new episodes from the online radio station Ekho Moskvy and investigative outlet The Insider were no longer accessible inside Russia. A BBC Russian Service podcast also appeared to be affected. [JohnDClay],So which ones are those two? I'm not familiar with them. [14th_cylon],these three. are you really not familiar with any of the three media mentioned there? or are you pretending to be dumb in order to troll? also, there is still whole rest of the article for you to read. [JohnDClay],I'm familiar with the BBC, but I don't know about their Russian service. Is it the same coverage, or an independent branch? But I've never heard of the first two. [quirzle],The first one. Can look up the name in the article to confirm....though \"independent\" implies not funded by the state, right? Apple is continuing to operate in Russia and, in the process, are enforcing their censorship.",

    "text": "Until compatibility issues are properly addressed, it'll never stand up to x86 Analysis Qualcomm has set its sights on Arm-based Windows laptops, which, in theory, offer notable advantages. The company's Arm-powered Snapdragon processors promise exceptional battery life that puts x86 machines to shame, fanless designs, and integrated 5G connectivity that leave Intel and AMD looking dated. By betting on a mobile and connected world, Qualcomm aims to position Arm-based Windows laptops as the future.\nBut there's a problem: software compatibility. Qualcomm's strategy relies on the assumption that users will prioritize battery life and always-on connectivity over a critical aspect of computing devices.\nFor Windows users, a thin and long-lasting device isn't enough if it can't run the applications they depend on daily – applications optimized for x86 architecture over the span of decades. While Qualcomm may have its \"Windows revolution\" mapped out, the reality is that Windows on Arm continues to struggle with compatibility issues that Qualcomm and Microsoft have yet to resolve. Is Qualcomm's Arm push overly optimistic?\nQualcomm's Windows on Arm strategy\nQualcomm's core selling points for Arm-based Windows laptops include significantly longer battery life compared to x86 machines. Thanks to Arm's efficiency, Snapdragon processors enable fanless laptops that remain cool and operational throughout the day, even in ultra-thin designs. Qualcomm is also stuffing 5G modems into these laptops, offering \"always-on, always-connected\" internet access aimed at students, remote workers, and just about anyone tired of battling unreliable Wi-Fi connections.\nQualcomm also emphasizes its focus on AI. The Snapdragon platform has a dedicated neural processing unit (NPU), which Qualcomm says can handle AI-driven tasks directly on the device without compromising performance. This aligns the company's designs with the current AI hype, suggesting these Arm machines can deliver \"next-generation AI experiences.\" Qualcomm also asserts these devices are…\nGavin Bonshor",

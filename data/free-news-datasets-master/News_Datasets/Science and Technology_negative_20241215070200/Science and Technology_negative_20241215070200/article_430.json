    "text": "The Bank of Russia has revoked the license for banking operations from the Corporate Finance Bank (Moscow). In terms of assets, the credit institution ranked 230th in the banking system of the Russian Federation. This is stated in the press service of the Central Bank.\nThe regulator emphasizes that over a long period of time, the bank's activities were characterized by poor asset quality, inefficient business model and chronic loss-making, which led to a decrease in the scale of operations and a reduction in capital.\nThe Central Bank has repeatedly identified violations by the credit institution of regulatory requirements and restrictions on certain types of transactions introduced to protect the interests of creditors and depositors.\nIn addition, the bank was involved in suspicious transactions by clients, mainly aimed at withdrawing funds abroad, and committed numerous violations in the field of AML/CFT.\nA temporary administration has been appointed to the credit institution, whose functions are assigned to the Deposit Insurance Agency. The Bank is a member of the deposit insurance system.",

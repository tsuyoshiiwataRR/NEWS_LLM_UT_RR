    "text": "Highlights\n- US Spot Ethereum ETF recorded an outflow of $3.24 million on November 14, breaking its six-day inflow streak.\n- Grayscale Ethereum ETF (ETHE) led the outflows with nearly $22 million with BlackRock ETHA offsetting it.\n- ETH price dropped 6% in the past 24 hours to $3,000, erasing over $22 billion in market capitalization.\n- Analyst highlight a re-entry opportunity at Supertrend support just around $3,000 levels.\nAfter six consecutive days of inflows, the spot Ethereum ETF flows flipped negative again on Thursday, as the bullish sentiment driven by Trump-trade subsided. The ETH price also dropped 6% in the last 24 hours moving all the way to $3,000 losing over $22 billion in market cap.\nSpot Ethereum ETF Flips Negative\nAfter six consecutive days of inflows, the US Spot Ethereum ETF is once again seeing outflows. On November 14, Ethereum ETFs experienced a minor outflow of $3.24 million, the first since the Donald Trump victory on November 5.\nDespite this, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA) saw a net inflow of $18.87 million in a single day. However, Grayscale’s ETHE played the spoilsport with nearly $22 million in outflows yesterday. Besides, inflows in other Ether ETFs have dried up significantly, as per the data from SoSoValue.\nFollowing the Donald Trump victory on November 5, the spot Ether ETFs saw strong inflows as the ETH price rallied 40% on the weekly timeframe all the way to $3,400. However, since the November top, the ETH price has corrected nearly 10% as bulls try to defend $3,000 levels.\nETH Price Action in Choppy Market\nAmid the recent ETH price action, popular crypto trader Credibull Crypto has started to build a position in Ethereum (ETH) and add further if Ethereum drops to $2,800, amid the current low-time-frame (LTF) price action and crypto market drop. The decision to increase their exposure is based on Bitcoin’s recent stability, which may prevent a quick pullback to the low $80k range and allow ETH to continue upward.\nThe trader notes that a small range is forming, pushing into local demand, with untapped local highs above. They are eyeing potential gains toward the $3,500+ level before reassessing. However, the trader emphasizes that the invalidation point for their higher-time-frame (TF) ETH strategy is at $2,350.\nWatching this LTF PA develop on\n[$ETH]and have started positioning here. If we make it down to the ideal entry zone (sub $2800) I'll add to my position.Reason for going in more aggressively here is that BTC is holding up decently atm and if we don't get a pullback to low 80k's…\n[pic.twitter.com/TmwCxBLgbu]— CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto)\n[November 14, 2024]\nPopular trading account IncomeSharks suggests that traders who missed the initial entry opportunity might find a second chance near Supertrend support just under $3,000. The trader also added that the swift shift in market sentiment, as “a few red candles” have led to widespread pessimism and negativity toward the asset. However, he believes that there’s a strong potential for a rebound moving ahead. This can again lead to resuming the inflows for spot Ethereum ETFs.\nA recent Ethereum price analysis hints that analysts have been making bullish predictions for the crypto, potentially hitting $4,000, by November end. However, it will require the support of the broader market to continue this rally ahead.\nMOODENG Price Rockets 26% Amid Major Listing, Rally To Continue?Ethereum ETF Flows Flip Negative Again As ETH Price Slips 6%, What’s Next?Bitcoin Price Crash: Here’s Why BTC Price Is Falling TodayDogwifhat Smart Whale Dumps Heavily Booking Profit, Has WIF Price Topped?Michael Saylor, Cynthia Lummis Confirm Bitcoin Can Offset $16 Trillion US Debt\nPepe Coin Price Prediction After PEPE Doubles In a WeekHow High Could Cardano Price Go if ADA is Used in US ElectionsHere’s How Gensler’s Resignation May Impact XRP PriceHere’s What Needs to Happen for Dogecoin Price to hit $3: Analyst ExplainsTop 5 Ethereum Tokens to Buy to Turn $1K to $1M in November",

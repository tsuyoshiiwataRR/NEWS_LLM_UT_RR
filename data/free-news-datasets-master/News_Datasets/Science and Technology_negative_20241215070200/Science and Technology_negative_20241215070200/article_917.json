People are just kind of tired of it,\" she said.\nTinder was hit particularly hard as it targeted younger users between 18 and 22.\n\"This is the same age group that likes to do a lot of things in person,\" she said.\nThese declines are hitting the firms where it really hurts -- the wallet.\nMore from this section A white couple donated 80 acres in an act of reparations.

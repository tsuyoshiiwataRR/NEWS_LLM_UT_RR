    "text": "Ex-officials allege US reverse-engineered alien tech for ‘secretive arms race’ The report asserts that the U.S. executive branch has been managing UAP intelligence for years without Congressional supervision. Stock photo of an unidentified flying object (UFO). Further expanding upon our coverage of the November 13 House subcommittee hearing, witnesses, including former Pentagon officials, claimed that the U.S. government had withheld extensive information on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs)—more commonly known as unidentified flying objects (UFOs)—for decades. This testimony follows prior claims from intelligence officials about covert UAP recovery programs, fueling calls for government transparency. Luis Elizondo, former head of the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), testified that UAPs are real and that the United States and other nations possess advanced technologies that do not originate from any known government. According to [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4989539-house-uap-secrecy-hearing/), “Advanced technologies…are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe,” Elizondo said, adding that the U.S. has engaged in a “multidecade, secretive arms race” centered around UAP technology. Claims of non-human technology, secret arms race During the [hearing](https://interestingengineering.com/culture/ufos-are-real-tracking-military), Elizondo was joined by several other witnesses, including Michael Shellenberger, who presented a report on a UAP program allegedly codenamed “Immaculate Constellation.” The report asserts that the U.S. executive branch has been managing UAP intelligence for years without Congressional supervision. According to Shellenberger, the program has amassed a significant amount of visual and sensor-based evidence, reportedly including “high-resolution photos” and direct observational data of UAPs. Shellenberger claimed there could be “hundreds, maybe thousands” of pieces of evidence withheld from the public, contrasting these high-quality images with the blurry visuals released in the past. His statement underscored concerns that the U.S. military and intelligence sectors have long concealed vital information about UAPs from elected officials. The hearing builds on last year’s testimony by former intelligence officer David Grusch, who alleged the existence of a government program dedicated to reverse-engineering non-human technology. Grusch’s claims were supported by [firsthand accounts](https://jalopnik.com/us-recovered-alien-vehicles-non-human-origin-ufo-1850507322) from former Navy pilots who reported witnessing inexplicable aerial phenomena. No evidence of alien technology, maintains Pentagon Despite the explosive testimonies, an [official Pentagon report](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4519306-pentagon-ufo-report-key-takeaways/) released earlier this year offers a stark (if somewhat prescient) rebuttal to these claims. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) published a report stating that there is [no evidence of alien material](https://interestingengineering.com/culture/aliens-never-visited-the-us-says-a-report-from-the-pentagon) or reverse-engineered UAP technology within U.S. government programs. Instead, the report attributed public fascination with UAPs to pop culture, general distrust of federal institutions, and misinterpretations of conventional technology. RECOMMENDED ARTICLES The AARO report, titled [The Historical Record Report](https://media.defense.gov/2024/Mar/08/2003409233/-1/-1/0/DOPSR-CLEARED-508-COMPLIANT-HRRV1-08-MAR-2024-FINAL.PDF), thoroughly reviewed past U.S. government investigations into UAPs, concluding that no programs have uncovered alien life or technology. The findings continue to divide opinions, with skeptics citing the AARO report and others questioning whether the Pentagon is fully transparent on the matter. As lawmakers continue to push for clarity, the hearing has raised more questions than answers regarding [UAP secrecy](https://interestingengineering.com/science/the-pentagons-ufo-office-reveals-new-gremlin-surveillance-system), technological arms races, and the need for public access to classified information on UAPs.

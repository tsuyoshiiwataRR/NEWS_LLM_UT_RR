    "text": "12 days ago Scam alert image. Photo by Denton police department This post includes content modified using AI .\nThe Denton Police Department alerted residents of phone frauds that investigators have seen considerable statements of.\nFraudulent individuals engage in deceptive practices by contacting individuals while impersonating well-known technology repair firms, claiming that the recipient's electronic devices have been compromised. Observing this misrepresentation, these scammers manage their targets by immediately providing financial dealings or accessing their bank accounts to fund necessary repairs.\n“We want to remind everyone that often a scammer’s best weapon is urgency,” the department said in a statement. “Scammers almost always make situations seem emergent and begin to pressure or even berate victims if they are not quick to give up information. No legitimate computer company, bank, police officer, court employee, etc. is going to call you and pressure you into providing your financial or identifying information.” A significant warning sign to be alert to is if an individual requests payment via gift cards. When unsure of a situation, it is advisable to terminate the call and reach out to your nearby law enforcement agency.\nOther known scams Operation Bear Claw Four people stand accused of defrauding insurance companies when they declared a bear broke into their automobiles and damaged conveyances, but detectives decided the wild animal was a human in costume.\nJury Duty Scam\nThe Jury Duty Scam goes something like this:\nYou may receive a call, text, or email notifying you of a missed jury duty, claiming that failure to respond could lead to arrest. These scammers often pose as legitimate law enforcement figures, such as officers, judges, or court personnel. They might suggest that paying a fine could prevent any legal action. In certain instances, they may even provide a contact number for further communication.\nFacebook Marketplace Salesc Scams This fraudulent scheme revolves around deceptive car sales listings on Facebook Marketplace. The perpetrator devises a counterfeit website like \"motors-sales.com\" and fabricates corresponding email addresses, for instance, \"ebay@motors-sales.com.\" Under the guise of a seller in urgent need of selling a vehicle due to circumstances like a family bereavement or military duties, the scammer advertises the vehicle with a lowered price point, usually hovering around $2,000.\nThe purchaser is advised to acquire eBay gift cards totaling approximately $200.00 each and contact the seller to disclose the gift card numbers during a phone call. Subsequently, the purchaser is assured of the delivery of the vehicle, a promise that remains unfulfilled.\nIRS Scam The IRS scam is exemplified in considerable forms, ranging from claims that people owe a considerable sum or are due a significant refund. In certain strategies, scammers employ scare tactics by threatening arrest or the suspension of a driver's license. Also, these fraudulent calls may be complemented by subsequent contacts from people purportedly designating the local police department or the state motor vehicle department.\nIt is important to bear in mind that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) only uses the United States Postal Service for official communications regarding taxes, refraining from making phone calls or sending emails for such purposes.\nSocial Security Scam Numerous fraudulent activities involve imposters claiming to be representatives of the Social Security Administration who contact individuals to solicit personal details such as their name, Social Security number, and banking information. These individuals often claim that the information is needed to enable the distribution of extra funds or rebates. Alternatively, they may falsely claim that a technical issue has led to the loss of the person's personal information.\nUnwanted Telemarketers If you receive a phone call from an unfamiliar individual attempting to sell you a product or service that you did not anticipate purchasing, politely decline by expressing a firm \"No, thank you.\" If they persistently request sensitive personal details, such as your credit card or Social Security number, exercise caution as it may be indicative of a fraudulent scheme. It is advisable to end the call instantly and report the incident to the Federal Trade Commission for further investigation and potential action.\nHow can I get telemarketers to stop calling me? The National Do Not Call Registry, established by the federal government, provides a no-cost and straightforward method for reducing unwanted telemarketing calls received at your home. To include your phone number in the registry or to access additional information, please dial 1-888-382-1222 from the phone number you wish to register. Within 31 days of registration, you can expect a decrease in the number of telemarketing calls you receive. Phone numbers listed on the registry will only be eliminated if they are disconnected and reassigned or if you opt to remove a number from the registry. references Cross Timbers Gazette\nFox Business\nCfpb\nDallas County Sheriff's Department",

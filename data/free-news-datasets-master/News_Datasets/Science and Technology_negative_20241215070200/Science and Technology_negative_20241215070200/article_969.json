    "text": "What to know Microsoft has shut down the Windows 10 Beta Channel just five months after reopening it in June 2024, and will automatically move all enrolled Windows Insiders to the Release Preview Channel. Windows 10 will reach its end of support on October 14, 2025, after which Microsoft will stop providing security updates and bug fixes. Home users can extend Windows 10 support for one additional year by paying $30 for Extended Security Updates (ESU). Microsoft has made a sudden move to shut down the Windows 10 Beta Channel , just five months after bringing it back to life in June 2024. The company will now automatically transfer all Beta Channel users to the Release Preview Channel as per Windows Insider .\nThe Beta Channel was revived in June with the first Windows 10 beta build in three years, aiming to support feature development with Windows Insiders. However, Microsoft has now ended the program without explaining the decision.\nCurrent statistics reveal that Windows 10 maintains a dominant position in the market, with over 60% of Windows systems worldwide still running on this version, while Windows 11 accounts for only 35% despite being available for three years.\nLooking ahead, Windows 10 version 22H2, which is the final release, will continue to receive monthly security updates until October 14 , 2025. After this date, the operating system will reach its end of support phase.\nFor users who need more time to transition, Microsoft has introduced a consumer-friendly option. Home users can purchase Extended Security Updates (ESU) for $30 , which will provide an additional year of support beyond the 2025 deadline.\nDuring its brief revival period, the Beta Channel introduced several features backported from Windows 11, including Windows Copilot, lock screen widgets, and various Microsoft service integrations. The Release Preview Channel will continue to receive Windows 10 builds, though the future of new feature releases remains uncertain as the operating system approaches its end of life.",

    "text": "Iranian nuclear facility/ Photo: Satellite image (c) 2022 Maxar Technologies/twitter An Israeli airstrike on Iran in October destroyed a top-secret nuclear weapons research facility in Parchin, U.S. media outlet Axios reports, citing three U.S. officials, a current Israeli official and a former Israeli official. According to the report, the strike significantly damaged Iran's effort over the past year to resume nuclear weapons research. Last month, dozens of Israeli jets carried out three waves of strikes that targeted 20 military sites in Iran. The focus was on missile and drone manufacturing facilities and critical air defence systems. The Israeli military said the operation was carried out in response to the attacks from Iran in recent months. Iran's air defence headquarters claimed the Israeli attack resulted in \"limited damage.\" Iran's army and media reports confirmed that the strike has led to five fatalities, including four soldiers and one civilian. The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducting 250 others. Israel's military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. The officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants but say more than half of those killed have been women and children. Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,200 people have been killed and more than 14,000 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reported. Lebanon has also suffered some $8.5 billion in physical damage and economic loss, according to a World Bank report Thursday. (With inputs from agencies)",

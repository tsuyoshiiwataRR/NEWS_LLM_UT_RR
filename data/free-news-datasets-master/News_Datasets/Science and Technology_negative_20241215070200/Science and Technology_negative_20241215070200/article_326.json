    "text": "At the time, The Wall Street Journal spotlighted a potential weakness: its fast-growing AI business is incredibly concentrated among tech giants like Meta, Google parent Alphabet, and TikTok parent ByteDance, whose demand for chips can by “lumpy,” according to Broadcom boss Hock Tan. That lumpiness may’ve contributed to the somewhat weak sales forecast the company offered.\nBroadcom is down more than 7% this week, compared to a decline of 0.8% for the S&P 500 and SOX that is essentially flat.

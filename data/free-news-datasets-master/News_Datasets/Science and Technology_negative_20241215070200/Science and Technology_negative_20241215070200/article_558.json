    "text": "Xiaomi’s Golden Run In India May Finally Be Over Xiaomi dominated the Indian smartphone market for a lot of years. However, it has seen a steep decline in fortunes lately. Xiaomi still holds a healthy share of India's smartphone market. Image Source: Bharat Upadhyay/Times Now) After holding the top position for years in the Indian smartphone market it seems the Chinese tech brand Xiaomi is losing its grip in India. Once the biggest phone brand in India, Xiaomi can easily be credited for democratising phones and making them more affordable in the country. But, the company's ambition to reposition itself as a premium brand, combined with a confused product strategy, competition in mid-tier segment from OnePlus and iQOO, failure in personal audio and laptop categories, and change in leadership have resulted in a steep decline. The latest report from International Data Corporation (IDC) shows that Xiaomi has now dropped to number fifth in the Indian smartphone market, a major downfall from the top spot it held for many years. Xiaomi's overall market share remains almost the same as the same time last year at 11.4 per cent, with shipments growing by just 2.7 per cent. However, it once held over 25 per cent share in India's phone market. The way things stand, the future looks even more challenging for Xiaomi. Urge to be a premium brand A large part of Xiaomi's success in India was due to its availability to democratise smartphones in the country. By offering good feature-packed smartphones at affordable prices, Xiaomi India quickly became the go-to brand for people looking for value-for-money phones. The Note series was an instant hit in the country and one of the biggest-selling line-ups in India yet. One of the key factors in Xiaomi’s recent struggles was its ambition to re-position itself as a premium player in the Indian market and compete with brands like Samsung and Apple. Many failed attempts with phones like the Redmi K20 series, combined with the brand's overall perception in the market, led to limited acceptance for premium Xiaomi phones among the Indian users. This also led to a confusing brand strategy. Xiaomi was first split into Redmi and Mi — with the latter focusing on premium products before the company decided to go with its actual name for all its products - Xiaomi. The same confusion also reflected in the product strategy. Phones like Mi 11 Ultra faced delays in the Indian market, while few others were made available in limited quantities only. Rising competition and changing customer expectations Xiaomi’s inability to keep up with consumer aspirations and rising competition from other brands further hurt its prospects in India. Many users quickly moved from budget to mid-tier phones, due to their evolving needs and newer use cases developed because of the global pandemic and even otherwise. At the same time, brands like OnePlus, iQOO and Nothing also emerged in a category that was otherwise heavily dominated by Xiaomi. Not to forget that an old player like Motorola has also made a promising comeback in India. Xiaomi would have hoped to gain what was lost through its premium phones. However, Apple's focus on India, along with attractive deals and better retail presence in the country, ensured that Xiaomi's penetration wasn't as desired. Change in Leadership Xiaomi's top leadership was behind company's rapid rise in the country. Even when Hugo Barra left the company, Xiaomi found a local face in Manu Kumar Jain, who led the company during its glorious years. Manu's departure led to many more exits from the company, including names like Raghu Reddy, Sumit Sonal, and Sudeep Sahu who was constant faces behind company's product strategy. The latest departure from Xiaomi is of its India President Muralikrishnan B, who was leading company's business initiatives in India. What Lies Ahead Not all is lost - Xiaomi still holds a healthy share of India's smartphone market which seems to have more players fighting for the top few spots, unlike a few years ago when it was mostly a two-way battle between Xiaomi and Samsung. It probably needs to make some strategic changes though, starting with better solutions in the mid-tier segment that can compete with rival brands. An entry into the foldable segment won't be a bad idea either. In fact, Xiaomi and Realme are the only two brands in the top 5 that don't have a foldable offering as of now. Maybe Xiaomi can democratise foldable phones the way it did smartphones when it entered India in the first place. Maybe not! Only time will tell. Here is to hoping that a comeback is on the cards for Xiaomi led by better products and regained consumer trust.

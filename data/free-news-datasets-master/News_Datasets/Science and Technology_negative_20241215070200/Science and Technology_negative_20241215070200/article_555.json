    "text": "Product : EA SPORTS FC 25\nPlatform : Xbox Series X\nPlease specify your platform model. Microsoft Xbox Series X\nWhat is your Gamertag/PSN ID/Switch ID?\nWhich mode has this happened in? Career Mode\nWhich part of the mode? Manager Career\nHow often does the bug occur? Every time (100%)\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? Load a manager career mode match and try to make subs late in the second half (75-80 minutes)\nWhat happens when the bug occurs? You can't change subs and starting players and then pressing B to back out does not work\nWhat should be happening instead? Should be able to switch players between the starting 11 and the bench and also should be able to back out of team management\nâ€Œ\nEvery time I try to make a sub in a manager career mode match whether playing the match or in sim mode the screen will get stuck on team management if you try to make subs later in the second half. It's ridiculously frustrating having to close the whole game and reload, in turn then losing all progress. Hopefully this can be fixed without us all having to restart our saves.",

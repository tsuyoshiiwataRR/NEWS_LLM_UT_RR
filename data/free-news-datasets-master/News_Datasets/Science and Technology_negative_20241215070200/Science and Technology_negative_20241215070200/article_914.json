Previous to this I have had no issues, and have been using this feature for 12+ months. PayPal have confirmed there is no block on my account, and I have followed all of the troubleshooting advice, including:\n- Using a different browser (I've now tried Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft Edge)\n- Clearing cache and all browsing history\n- Confirming the address attached to my bank/bank card matches the address listed in PayPal\n- Removing all other addresses listed in PayPal and only having my primary address which is correct\n- Checking with the merchant directly, it has now happened across three different merchants/websites and they have reported no issues on their end so it is clearly a PayPal issue\n- Confirming all cards in my wallet\nPayPal customer service have been largely unhelpful, continuing to repeat the same troubleshooting instructions to me when I've already tried them and they haven't resolved the issue and I have been trying to escalate it to the technical team for weeks now and am not getting anywhere. I have never had a problem until now!!!\nAny assistance would be appreciated.\n- Labels:\n-\n[Transaction Inquiry](/t5/forums/filteredbylabelpage/board-id/Transactions/label-name/transaction%20inquiry)\n[Login to Me Too](/plugins/common/feature/oauth2sso/sso_login_redirect?dest_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal-community.com%2F)\nSherineB\n[Options](#)\n- Mark as New\n- Bookmark\n- Subscribe\n- Mute\nhttps://www.paypal-community.com/rss/message?board.id=Transactions&message.id=157144 [Permalink](/t5/Transactions/Receiving-the-error-quot-we-couldn-t-find-this-address-quot-when/m-p/3192080/highlight/true#M157144)[Print](/t5/forums/forumtopicprintpage/board-id/Transactions/message-id/157144/print-single-message/true/page/1) [Report Inappropriate Content](/t5/notifications/notifymoderatorpage/message-uid/3192080)\nI have the same issue and did follow the same troubleshooting guidelines .

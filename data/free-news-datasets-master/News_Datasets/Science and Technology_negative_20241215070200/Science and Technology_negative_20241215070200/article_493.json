Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero players absolutely hated Yajirobe because of how broken the character was. Similarly, Call of Duty: Warzone had the riot shield which, when used well, would frustrate other players.\nRelated Black Ops 6 Is Proof That Bigger Isn't Always Better Sometimes having three main modes that all hit the mark is more than enough.\n1 With the battle royale's integration into Black Ops 6 , a whole bunch of content was introduced, including new weapons, maps, and operators . However, it seems the riot shield has mysteriously disappeared, without any warning from the devs. While most of the Warzone player base can't be happier, the few that were using it already miss it.\nNobody Misses The Shield As spotted by PCGamesN , it seems the riot shield has seemingly disappeared from Warzone after the massive Black Ops 6 season one update. However, it's unlikely that it will be missed, as players have been complaining about it for a long time. Those who did use it would resort to frustrating tactics that annoyed the rest of the community.\nThe shield could be used in a corner to make yourself invulnerable to almost any firearm, and if you're not doing that, simply carrying it on your back will save you from getting shot in the back. In a game that heavily relies on shooting to kill other players, the riot shield was one of the most annoying weapons you could use.\nThere's no word on whether the shield will be returning or if there will be any balancing changes. However, most of the community will be hoping they've seen the last of it.\nWith the season one update, Warzone is now completely integrated into Black Ops 6, meaning you will be able to use weapons and operators from the latest title in the battle royale. What's more? The update surprise dropped three hours early , so that means you had to tolerate the shield for three fewer hours.\nWe may be in for more surprises soon, as rumour has it that Master Chief, the Doom Slayer, and Marcus Fenix will eventually make their way to Call of Duty as operators. However, there isn't much more information on this, so take it with a grain of salt.\n7 Images 7 Images\nClose Call of Duty: Warzone Bringing its classic fast-paced combat to the battle royale genre, Call of Duty: Warzone features battles of up to 150 players per match. It introduces innovations to the format, such as the Gulag resurrection mechanic, while new seasons bring brand-new content and objectives to tackle.\nLive-Service Games Call of Duty: Warzone Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Your changes have been saved\nEmail is sent\nEmail has already been sent\nclose Please verify your email address.\nSend confirmation email close You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.\nManage Your List Follow Followed Follow with Notifications Follow Unfollow Close",

Non-evidence-based videos promoted Mucinex, supplements, progesterone, massages and avoiding caffeine and alcohol to improve conception. More than half of the top videos on TikTok about conception strategies without treatment were not backed by science, with most created by nonprofessionals and content creators for profit, according to a research letter.\n“Throughout the United States, reproductive health education has focused on contraception, with little education on fertility and how to become pregnant, resulting in low fertility awareness among people of reproductive age,” Hannah Jahnke, PhD, director of clinical research at Maven Clinic in New York, and colleagues wrote in O&G Open . “Consequently, many people who are trying to become pregnant turn to social media to learn about strategies to optimize chances of pregnancy.”\nLess than 50% of videos featured only evidence-based pregnancy strategies. Image: Adobe Stock. Jahnke and colleagues searched TikTok for the top 100 videos featuring strategies for conception without treatment that appeared using “#ttc,” which was the most used hashtag for trying to conceive on the app. The authors evaluated TikTok videos for creator professional qualifications, potential for profiting from content and scientific evidence base.\nOverall, the median number of video interactions was 14,000 likes, 237 comments, 1,756 saves and 588 shares. Most TikTok videos were created by those with no health care affiliation (62%), whereas 27% were made by traditional and 11% by complementary health care professionals. Of traditional health care professionals, 21% were OB/GYNs, 5% were nurses and 1% were urologists.\nOf the top TikTok videos on conception, 43% featured only evidence-based strategies, 35% featured only non-evidence-based strategies and 22% featured both evidence and non-evidence-based strategies. Videos created by traditional health care professionals were less likely to contain non-evidence-based information vs. videos created by those with no health care affiliation (18% vs. 75.8%; P < .001).\n“People who are trying to become pregnant may be particularly vulnerable to misinformation and videos with combinations of evidence-based and non-evidenced-based information may be particularly insidious, because the elements of truth make it more difficult to discern fact from fiction,” the researchers wrote.\nRegarding the potential for profiting from content, 18% of videos were produced by creators featuring links to products. Of those, 72.2% featured non-evidence-based information.\nCommon themes observed among non-evidence-based TikTok videos included taking Mucinex, dietary and probiotic supplements, using progesterone, practicing fertility massages and promoting complete avoidance of caffeine and alcohol to enhance the likelihood of conception.\nThe most common evidence-based strategies noted within TikTok videos were using ovulation tracking and timed intercourse, healthy eating and use of at-home insemination kits.\n“Although medical advice on social media currently is unregulated and often inaccurate, social media remains a central touchpoint for people seeking health information,” the researchers wrote. “Due to their popularity and accessibility, social media platforms have the potential to serve as tools to break down barriers to accessing information and promote medically accurate health education. Future work should aim to ensure that the general public has access to trustworthy information.”",

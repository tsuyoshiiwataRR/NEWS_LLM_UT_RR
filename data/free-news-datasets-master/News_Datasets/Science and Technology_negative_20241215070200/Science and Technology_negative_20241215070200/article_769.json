    "text": "Trending:\nNASA Warns Of Big Aeroplane-Sized Asteroid To Make Close Contact With Earth Tomorrow: Are You Safe?\nA Big 91-foot asteroid is set to make its close distance towards Earth tomorrow. Is it potentially hazardous? Know all the details.\nAsteroid\nNASA has issued an alert concerning an asteroid known as 2024 VC4, which will fly close to Earth on November 16, 2024, at 1:42 IST. The space stone is as big as a large airplane and is 91 feet in diameter. Passing at a staggering speed of 69,486 km/h, it will fly at a distance of 2,500,000 kilometres from Earth.\nWhat Is Asteroid 2024 VC4?\nAsteroid 2024 VC4 is a Near-Earth Object (NEOs) belonging to the Apollo group. Such asteroids have orbits that sometimes cross with the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Though large and close, 2024 VC4 does not qualify as a \"potentially hazardous asteroid\" in terms of size or proximity.\nCould Asteroid 2024 VC4 Pose a Threat?\nNASA defines “potentially hazardous asteroids” as those larger than 492 feet in diameter and passing within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth. While 2024 VC4 comes relatively close, its size is much smaller than the threshold for a significant threat. Nevertheless, scientists remain cautious, as even minor deviations in an asteroid's orbit could alter its trajectory.\nOngoing Monitoring and Preparedness\nNASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) is dedicated to tracking NEOs like 2024 VC4. Advanced tracking systems and global observatories, including Pan-STARRS and NASA’s NEOWISE, provide precise data to ensure early detection of potential threats. These efforts also help refine our understanding of asteroid behaviour and readiness for any future risks.\nAlthough 2024 VC4 will pass safely by Earth, NASA’s vigilance in monitoring space rocks underscores the importance of early warning systems and preparedness in safeguarding our planet. Rest assured, there’s no reason for concern with this celestial flyby.\nGet\n[Latest News](https://www.timesnownews.com/latest-news)Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from[Technology Science](https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science)and around the world.Trending:\nEnd of Article\nSubscribe to our daily Newsletter!\niPhone SE 4 Release Date, Price In India, Specifications: What To Expect From Apple In 2025?\nWhat Google's Antitrust Case Reveals About Apple’s Secret Ad Plans\nDigital Arrest Scam Costs IIT Bombay Student Rs 7.29 Lakh: What Is It, How To Stay Safe\nNASA Alert! 130-ft Airplane Sized Asteroid Racing Through Space At Over 62000 kmph: Are We Safe?\nGoogle Parent Alphabet Gets Green Light To Buy Stake In Flipkart, Deal Details Inside",

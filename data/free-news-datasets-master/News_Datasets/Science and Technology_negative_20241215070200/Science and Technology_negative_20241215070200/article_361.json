A new scam called ClickFix is targeting users and is on the rise in the U.S. As the name suggests, it prompts you to click on a link, claiming to fix an issue, but in reality it infects your computer with malware.\nI reported on this earlier , detailing how threat actors used messages impersonating errors from Google Chrome, Microsoft Word and OneDrive to infect users' computers.\nNow, a similar type of attack is affecting Google Meet users, regardless of whether they're using a Windows PC or a Mac. I explain how this cyberattack works and what you can do to protect yourself.\nI'M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS\nHow the Google Meet trap works\nAccording to French cybersecurity company Sekoia , it all starts with an email containing a link to a Google Meet.

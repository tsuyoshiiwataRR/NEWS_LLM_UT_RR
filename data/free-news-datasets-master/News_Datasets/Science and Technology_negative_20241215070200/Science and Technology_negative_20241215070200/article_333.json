    "text": "If you live in Massachusetts and haven’t received a data breach notification, consider yourself lucky. Because with data breaches compromising countless accounts, the digital landscape in Massachusetts is under siege. Hoodline, a website that delivers news from around Greater Boston, reported that there were over 2,400 breaches reported across the state last year, impacting almost 7 million residents. According to NBC Boston, at a recent Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection hearing, U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado highlighted that a staggering 143 million people were hit by breaches at 10% of the nation’s largest companies in 2023. These breaches aren’t confined to large corporations; small businesses and even state government employees have been targeted. A phishing attack earlier this year tapped into state of Massachusetts government employee emails, which compromised contact information, including personal data and health care. According to a news release sent last week to Springfield’s 22News from the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services, the state’s security team notified the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) that commonwealth of Massachusetts employees were victimized by an email phishing attack, and that a small number of DDS employee email accounts were compromised on July 30. Upon investigation, on Sept. 10 additional DDS client information was also compromised by the phishing attack. The type of information at risk included: • Contact Information, such as name, address, date of birth, phone number, email; • Health Information: such as health-care providers, diagnoses, medicines, and care and treatment information; • Personal Information: such as Social Security number, driver’s license or state ID number, or other ID number; • Billing, insurance claims, and payment data: such as claim numbers, account numbers, payment cards, financial and banking information. At this time, DDS says it’s not aware of any misuse of personal information; however, those impacted are being asked to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft. That state government hack just reinforces these disturbing breach statistics, reflecting a national trend, with over 353 million accounts falling victim to cyberattacks in 2023 — a 72% jump from the previous record set in 2021, according to an analysis by the Boston Globe. The Identity Theft Resource Center also reported an increase in national data breaches, showing the depth and breadth of the threat. In Massachusetts alone, 1.8 million accounts have been marred by data leaks as of September. Personal information such as Social Security numbers, financial details, and driver’s licenses are at high risk, with the health-care and finance sectors being the top two reported for data breaches in the state, according to NBC Boston. Experts advise that the growing sophistication of hacker groups heightens the threat for everyone, no matter your vigilance or computer savvy. “You can be the most careful person in the world and there is no way to guarantee they won’t break in,” Stuart Madnick, co-director of MIT’s flagship cybersecurity consortium, told the Globe. Residents of Massachusetts, along with the rest of the nation, must wonder not if, but when they will become the next victim of this pervasive cyber threat. The response to these breaches varies, with some companies having had to shell out massive ransoms, like Change Healthcare. In February, that national provider of revenue and payment cycle management, connecting payers, providers, and patients within the U.S. health-care system, was the target of a cyberattack by the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware gang. The hackers disrupted operations and stole up to 6 Terabytes of data, including personal information, payment details, and insurance records. A $22 million ransom was paid to ensure the data was deleted, but that data deletion didn’t happen. Instead, the ransomware group pulled an exit scam. The affiliate behind the attack passed the stolen data to another ransomware group, RansomHub, which demanded another ransom payment. This incident just shows that despite such preemptive measures, leaked information often finds its way online, leading to further complications for consumers needing medical services. Individuals should remain on their guard, by keeping track of their digital footprint, and managing their data with caution. Jack Danahy, vice president of strategy at NuHarbor Security, a leading national cybersecurity services company, advises taking these precautionary steps: • Freeze your credit at the big three credit agencies. This will prevent criminals from taking out anything in your name. • Keep an eye on your free weekly credit reports, credit score and credit card statements for any unauthorized charges. • Get rid of old accounts you don’t use. Having too many digital accounts can increase the risk of your data being misused or stolen. • “Keep an eye on your email. Keep an eye on your physical mail. If you’re getting a letter from a bank or a registry of deeds or what have you that you’re not expecting, don’t necessarily assume that it’s junk mail. It could be the notification of something that’s being done in your name that isn’t you,” Danahy said.",

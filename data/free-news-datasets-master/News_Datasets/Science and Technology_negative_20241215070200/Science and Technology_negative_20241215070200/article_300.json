I used it normally for 3 hours. After installing Windows system updates and restarting my computer, I found that ObjectDock could not start again. I tried the following actions, but none of them worked:\n- Starting it with administrator privileges;\n- Uninstalling it completely and then reinstalling it.\n- Purge_ObjectDock and reinstall.\nPlease help me, thanks.\nPlease [login](/account/logon) to comment and/or vote for this skin.\nWelcome Guest!

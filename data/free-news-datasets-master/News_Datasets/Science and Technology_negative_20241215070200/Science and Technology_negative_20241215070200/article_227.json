    "text": "One of the straps that we had seen at the presentation of the Apple Watch Series 10 has been officially launched yesterday. It is a gold strap in the two available sizes, 42 and 46 mm, which we can purchase starting today.\nIt works, like the rest, for other watch models, not only with the latest one, however, what you may not like so much is the price, since it will cost as much or more than some Apple Watch models so it is not intended for all audiences.\nGold strap for Apple Watch The design would be made up of links, made of 316L stainless steel, so let’s not think that it is solid gold, something impossible in a strap of that weight, since it would be much more expensive, and even more so now, at the price of gold.\nCurrently, we can find it for 349 euros in Spain, the cost in the United States being $349, so at least, in exchange, it is not worth more, as usually happens. However, even though we pay for it today, we will not receive it until the first week of December, so we would have to wait a little, and this type of accessories, so expensive and exclusive, are not in very high demand, and Therefore, not a manufacturing one either, so if you want one, at least before Christmas, you should order it, as the delivery date could go up.\nIt has a 3-year warranty, although if it receives a blow or breaks, you will not be eligible for this, so you will have to be careful, since we are not talking about a normal strap.\nThere are quite similar imitations on Amazon. I, personally, have a similar one, and we can get it for just over 20 euros, so if you simply like the design, but don’t want to pay that much for it, it is an option to consider.\nIn the same launch, we have two other models, or rather, colors, since the material, as we said, is simulation. We would talk about “Slate” and “Natural”. Of course, at the same price as Gold.\nThe link bracelet is made of 316L stainless steel alloy and has more than 100 pieces. Its manufacturing process is so meticulous that it takes almost nine hours to cut the links for a single bracelet. The folding clasp blends with the curves of the design. And if you want to add or remove links, no problem: many have a button to release them without the need for special tools.\nAs we can see, the price is not given by its material itself, but by the process and labor behind each one of them, so now it is your decision if you really want to pay that much for one, or prefer Go for the imitations from Amazon, which, honestly, are very good.\nLeave us a comment with your opinion about this product, and if you have considered purchasing it, or think it is crazy to pay so much for a simple strap.\nThe entry Apple launches a gold strap for your Apple Watch: the price? Better not to know was published first in La Manzana Mordida.",

    "text": "'Wolf in sheep's clothing': Report flags Starlink's US military ties Starlink operates through a constellation of satellites to provide internet access worldwide, a model distinct from traditional telecom services that rely on ground-based towers. In Short - Kutniti report warns of Starlink's US military ties - India demands Starlink's compliance with security norms - Caution urged over Starlink's geopolitical influence When Elon Musk’s Starlink appears on the horizon, it might seem like just another internet provider promising global connectivity. But is there more to this satellite constellation than meets the eye? As Starlink is hustling to launch in India,[ a report by think tank Kutniti Foundation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kBfl5sl88Y2mlRgvMl1zzaqljOjY23BU/view) warns that Elon Musk's company is a “wolf in sheep’s clothing” and could bring more than just high-speed internet to the table. The report highlights Starlink's deep ties with US military and intelligence agencies, raising questions about national security. With satellite technology unbound by geographic boundaries, could Starlink be offering a fast lane to the American government’s global reach? STARLINK’S TECHNOLOGY AND CONCERNS Starlink operates through a constellation of satellites to provide internet access worldwide, a model distinct from traditional telecom services that rely on ground-based towers. However, Kutniti's report points out that the satellites are controlled from outside India, raising sovereignty concerns as Starlink would allow direct access to Indian users without local governance over its infrastructure. Kutniti describes the service as “a new form of internet provider” that can bypass geographic and political boundaries, noting that “the American government, through Starlink, gains access to every citizen without an intermediary governance structure.” This unrestricted reach, according to Kutniti, could potentially be used to serve US military interests, citing the fact that the “biggest customer and promoter” of Starlink has been the American intelligence and military sectors. INDIA’S RESPONSE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS India’s Communications Minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, said on Tuesday that Starlink must comply with India’s security norms before it can receive a licence for satellite broadband services. While the minister acknowledged Starlink’s application to enter the Indian market, he highlighted that no services would be permitted until all regulatory conditions are met. As of now, Starlink has not responded to Kutniti’s claims or clarified its stance on meeting India’s regulatory requirements. The company has previously expressed interest in expanding satellite internet services to rural and remote regions, positioning itself as a solution for areas with limited internet access. CONNECTIONS TO US DEFENCE AND INTELLIGENCE Kutniti highlights Starlink’s close association with the US government, particularly intelligence and military agencies. Elon Musk’s aerospace company, SpaceX, is reportedly involved in constructing a network of satellites under a classified contract with a US intelligence agency. According to the report, there are several confidential agreements between Starlink and the US defence sector, suggesting a strong link between Musk’s companies and American military interests. The report also notes that Musk has faced political controversies in the US over Starlink’s role in international conflicts. For instance, he declined a request from Ukraine to use Starlink’s satellite network for military purposes, which stirred debate over his influence and control over a technology that could impact global events. KUTNITI’S CALL FOR CAUTION Kutniti Foundation warns that Musk’s business dealings, including his connections with private intelligence companies and his political visibility in the US, should prompt caution from India. The report mentions Musk’s alleged ties with organisations like Palantir Technologies, known for its close association with American intelligence. Furthermore, it points out that Starlink’s technology has been used in politically sensitive regions like Brazil, Ukraine, and Iran, sometimes without considering the sovereignty of these nations, according to Kutniti. The foundation claims that Starlink’s reach extends beyond internet services, potentially allowing it to provide high-definition satellite images and live video feeds. Kutniti suggests that Starlink is a tool of “geopolitical control,” developed to maintain American dominance in space and, by extension, influence over other countries. IMPACT ON INDIA AND CALL FOR SECURITY MEASURES Kutniti recommends that India exercise caution and enforce strict security checks if Starlink is allowed to enter the country. The think tank mentions that India’s interests must be safeguarded against foreign entities with military and intelligence affiliations. It further calls attention to US policies, which, as outlined in the report, could mandate US companies to act in ways that enhance American security and economic interests.",

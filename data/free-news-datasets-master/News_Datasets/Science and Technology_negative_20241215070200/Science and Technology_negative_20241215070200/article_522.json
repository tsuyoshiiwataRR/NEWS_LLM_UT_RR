    "text": "een uur geleden\nDear EA Support,\nI am experiencing two issues in Career Mode in EA Sports FC 25:\nYouth Scout Reports: When my youth scouts return with their reports, I am unable to open them. Every time I try, I get a screen that just shows \"null.\" Despite this, I know that the players are being scouted and their information is available in the system, but I cannot view it due to this bug.\nPlayer Growth Indicators: I have noticed that the \"+\" or \"-\" indicators next to players' ratings in the Squad Hub (which show how much their stats have grown or declined) are no longer visible. The players are still growing, but I canâ€™t see the exact amount of progress as I used to.\nCould you please assist me with resolving these issues? Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you in advance for your support.\nBest regards,\nProbeer eerst deze stappen als je problemen ondervindt bij het verbinden met een EA-game.\nWe controleren of jij het bent door je een code te sturen voor je vertrouwde apparaten.",

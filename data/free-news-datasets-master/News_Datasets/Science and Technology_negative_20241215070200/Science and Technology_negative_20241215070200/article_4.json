Microsoft Xbox Series X\nWhat is your gamertag/PSN ID?\nDate/time issue occurred 4:00 PM\nWhat type of issue do you have? Crash/Freeze\nWhich mode has this happened in? Road to the College Football Playoff\nSummarize your bug While playing my multiplayer match, my game would not let me choose my plays and would force me to receive delay of game penalties until I got kicked. I reconnected my controller and it was not a hardware issue.\nHow often does the bug occur? Rarely (0% - 9%)\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? I do not know\nWhat happens when the bug occurs? I am not able to navigate any UI. Only pausing fixes this but I am limited to 3 pauses per game.\nWhat do you expect to see? Not being able to choose a play on offense or defense.\n‌\nThe game keeps freezing, very annoying forcing losses. Please help me.",

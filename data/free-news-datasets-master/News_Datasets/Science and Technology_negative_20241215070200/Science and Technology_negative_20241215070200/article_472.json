    "text": "HTTP Archive’s annual Web Almanac analyzed data from millions of sites to find new trends in performance metrics, technology and user experience. According to the report , there is a performance gap between mobile experiences and desktop. 97% of the “good” INP ( Interaction to Next Paint ) score was achieved by desktop sites, but 74% of the “good” INP score was achieved by mobile sites. This shows that mobile users are facing some challenges while desktop performance remains strong.\nThe report also found that third-party tracking is still common, with 61% of the website cookies set in third-party context. 44% of the cookies on top websites are set by Google’s DoubleClick and only 6% of the third-party cookies are using partitioning to protect the privacy.\nWordPress is the most common content management system and it is being used by 5.7 million sites which makes up 36% of total sites. On the other hand, only 8% of the websites out of 1,000 most visited websites use an identifiable CMS platform. If we talk about e-commerce sites, 38% of the market share goes to WooCommerce and 18% of the market share goes to Shopify.\nThere are also some platforms that have improved their performances. Squarespace had a good score of 33% in 2022, which increased to 60% in 2024. Other platforms like WooCommerce and Magneto are facing some issues regarding their performance. This whole report highlights that many businesses and developers are facing issues when it comes to mobile optimization. Privacy concerns are also growing as many businesses are relying on third-party services to do marketing and make strategies.\nRead next: Meta Confirms Facebook Will Switch To Views As Its Main Focus Metric",

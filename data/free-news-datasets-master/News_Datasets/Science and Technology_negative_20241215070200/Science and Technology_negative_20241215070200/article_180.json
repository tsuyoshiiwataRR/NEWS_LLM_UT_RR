    "text": "Early exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) may increase your risk of developing conditions such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and obesity later in life, even in small doses, a recent study has found.\nBPA is a type of chemical widely found in consumer and industrial products, especially in processed food and food packaging. An endocrine disruptor, it is known to cause hormonal problems that contribute to chronic disease as you age.\nThe study, published [September 2024] in the Journal of Hazardous Materials, is the first of its kind to assess the relationship between BPA exposure and cardiometabolic health outcomes from childhood to adolescence, using a large variety of health markers.\nCardiometabolic health refers to the overall health of your heart and blood vessels, and your body’s ability to process nutrients, regulate blood sugar, and maintain a healthy weight.\n“Our results point to the need to reduce exposure to BPA in the early stages of life,” say the researchers, led by Sofia Almeida Costa at the Institute of Public Health at the University of Porto (ISPUP) in Portugal.\nTo gauge its effects on the body from dietary sources over time, Costa and her colleagues followed 3,138 children and adolescents, ages 4 to 13, from a prospective Portuguese birth cohort.\nBisphenol A exposure most common through diet, plastics\nFood and beverages are considered the most significant source of human exposure to BPA. Ultra-processed foods, for instance, heavily rely on plastics for production and packaging, and chemicals can migrate into food from food processing equipment and packaging, among other ways.\nIn Portugal, 57% of the food items consumed by the population in 2015–2016 were reported with associated packaging materials, including 69% plastic materials and 3% metal.\nAfter accounting for factors such as diet and energy intake, the researchers found higher BPA exposure was linked to certain health risk factors, including:\n- Higher blood insulin levels and insulin resistance, which means the body can’t use the hormone insulin properly to regular blood sugar (glucose) levels\n- Higher body mass index (BMI), which uses height and weight to classify weight as healthy or unhealthy\n- Increased fat mass, an increased amount of body fat relative to total body weight\n- Larger waist circumference, which measures abdominal fat\n“We conclude that global strategies need to be developed and implemented to mitigate bisphenol A exposure,” the researchers say. “This demands modifications, not only in consumer behaviors, but also in the adoption of innovative approaches by the food and food packaging industries, to ensure a substantial reduction of BPA exposure.”\nPrecise data builds on evidence of BPA-related health harms\nWhile it is unknown exactly how BPA interacts with our bodies to harm health, previous research shows an association between higher levels of BPA and an increased risk of diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, and death.\nUnlike most other studies, however, the researchers in Portugal say they combined direct and indirect methods of assessment to more precisely estimate and predict BPA exposure.\nThese included detailed food consumption diaries and extensive collected information on sociodemographic characteristics, blood biomarkers and urine samples. They also adjusted for several relevant variables, including total energy intake, which is usually not considered, researchers say.\nParticipants provided detailed information about each food and beverage consumed, including their place and time, food preparation method, brand, quantity consumed, and packaging materials (only for a 13-year follow-up).\nThe availability of 24-hour urine samples, and the highly sensitive method used to determine BPA concentrations at relatively low levels, also allowed for a more precise estimate of the total daily exposure, they say. BPA leaves the body quickly, and levels can vary throughout the day.\n“Urgent” call to reduce BPA daily exposure\nIncreased public awareness and regulation changes have reduced BPA usage in some countries, but BPA substitutes (BPS, BPF) are less studied and may have harmful health impacts.\nThe main focus of BPA regulations in the U.S. is food contact applications, especially those designed for children. Ways to avoid chemical exposures include eating homemade food when possible, avoiding plastic food packaging, and not using canned food and beverages.\nThe latest study has several limitations, such as the better health characteristics of the eligible participants, the researchers say. Adolescents at the 13-year follow-up may have underreported food packaging materials, and types of food industry packaging material also may have changed between 2005 and 2020, when the study was conducted.\nLastly, “the single effect of BPA on multiple health outcomes may be too reductionist since consumers are exposed to a large variety of food matrix, nutrients, food contaminants and environmental endocrine disruptors,” the researchers say.\nStill, they caution that the need to globally reduce BPA daily exposure remains “urgent.”\n“[Adverse] health effects are expected when exposure chronically exceeds safety levels, even at low doses,” they say. “The results of this study will help public health researchers all over the world, food safety agencies, and policymakers to develop new and relevant guidelines, recommendations, and food policies.”\nTo proactively avoid toxic chemical exposures, see the University of California-San Francisco’s comprehensive guide.\nReferences\nCosta SA, Severo M, Lopes C, Torres D.

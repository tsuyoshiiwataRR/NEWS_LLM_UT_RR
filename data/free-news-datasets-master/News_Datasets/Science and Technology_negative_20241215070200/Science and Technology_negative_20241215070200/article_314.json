    "text": "OpenSource.net, Which OpenSource.org (OSI) Said Would Continue OpenSource.com (IBM/Red Hat), Has Been Dead for a Month Open Source Initiative (OSI) is not an ally; it's a Microsoft front group. The [ promise](https://opensource.com/article/23/6/new-developments-opensourcecom) or the commitment (IBM and OSI said they would continue OpenSource.com at OpenSource.net) hasn't lasted even a year (or just a little over a year). Nothing new in a month now: The RSS feed confirms this (they didn't editorialise things to conceal a lack of activity as they did a year ago). Maybe it'll kick back into life. Or maybe not. [ OSI is too busy attacking Open Source at the moment](/n/2024/11/15/Latest_in_OSI_s_Blog_Affirms_Its_Status_as_Microsoft_Front_Grou.shtml); its budget from Microsoft [ doubled to achieve this objective](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/912037395): ([people are only slush funds](/n/2024/02/08/About_Two_Months_Ago_the_Open_Source_Initiative_OSI_Released_It.shtml)) Remember that the OSI's President [already openly admitted](/o/2020/09/27/osi-mostly-clearlydefined/) that about [half of their money is funneled from Microsoft](/o/2021/12/30/osi-budget-for-proprietary-software-monopoly/). This is what pays OSI salaries. The goal is to promote GitHub and [its attacks on the GPL](/o/2023/02/10/copilot-in-court/) (or copyleft). [ People are noticing](/n/2024/11/10/The_Other_Bruce_on_Openwashing_at_OSI_and_Not_Bruce_Perens_the_.shtml). It's absurd by design, by intention. Like the [Linux Foundation](/wiki/Linux_Foundation) (which only devotes ~2% of its money to Linux; it's just milking the brand \"Linux\"), it's fast becoming little but a force of occupation, [a hostile trolling operation](/o/2021/05/07/trolling-the-real-community/) which [defames critics](/o/2021/06/01/wikipedia-osi/) and [tries to deplatform them](/o/2021/12/29/straw-man-censorship/).

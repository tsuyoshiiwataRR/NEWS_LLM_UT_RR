    "text": "CADILLAC -- Leaders in Wexford County are still grappling with “work arounds” since the cyber-attack back on Election Day. County Administrator Joe Porterfield said departments can perform most services but it’s more difficult with much of what they do being computer based-including their phones. Although you can reach 911, you can’t call into county offices or email them. Porterfield says main department emails should be restored by the end of Thursday, and they are working on getting their main phone lines back up and running. He said they have been using cell phones and laptops as alternatives. Porterfield said there’s no word on when their computer systems will be back online. They are considering forwarding their main lines to their cell phones in the meantime. He said they want to make sure they have a clear understanding of what happened before they bring their network back online. “We’re not sure yet how deep this threat has gone. So, we want to make sure that we don’t miss something. We certainly don’t want to bring things online and then have this whole process start over. So, we’re going to be bringing things up very slowly, very methodically, and making sure that we do this right the first time.” The FBI and State Police are investigating but Porterfield says they have no new information as to who’s behind it or why. He said they still don’t know if any sensitive information was obtained from the attack.",

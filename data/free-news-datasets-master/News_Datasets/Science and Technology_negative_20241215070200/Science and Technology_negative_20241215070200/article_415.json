    "text": "For help with your TalkTalk TV box, channels and apps.\nan hour ago\nHi\nFor about 3 weeks our bbc, itv and channel 4 hd channels have lost signal through our talktalk tv box. I originally put this down to the weather but it has continued.\nThis happened about 2 or 3 years ago and was fixed by talktalk sending a replacement box.\nIs there a way to test the current tv box we have?\nPretty sure that the aerial isn't to blame, exactly as last time.\nThanks\nAndy\nan hour ago\nHi\nConnect the aerial directly to the TV when the signal is weak and see if the picture breaks up rtc, this will give an indication if there is a weak signal from the transmitter.\nThanks\nKarl.\nCheck & Report l [Our latest Blog](/blog) l Set Your Preferences l [Service Status](/servicestatus) l [Help with your Service](/t5/Help-with-your-TalkTalk-service/ct-p/help) l [Community Stars](/t5/custom/page/page-id/SuperUserHub)\nPlease log in to My Account if you need to view or pay your bill, manage boosts and track your usage.

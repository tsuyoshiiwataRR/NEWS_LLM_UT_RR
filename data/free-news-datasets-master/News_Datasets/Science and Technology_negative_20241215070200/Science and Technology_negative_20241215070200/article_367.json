    "text": "[Science News](https://www.news9live.com/science) Earth in Danger? Asteroid 2024 VK3’s Close Encounter Raises Alarm Asteroid 2024 VK3 is approaching Earth at a very close range, and people are now panicking about an impact! This cosmic threat could be near-miss in a few months and scientists are struggling to track this in order to prevent it! New Delhi: The recently discovered asteroid 2024 VK3 is an Aten-type NEO that recently flew by Earth and has future projections that have piqued the interest of astronomers. Discovered on November 10, 2024, and observed three days later by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, this asteroid has an elongated orbit that occasionally brings it into Earth’s vicinity. According to its determined orbit and distance from the Sun, it belongs to the Aten group, NEOs that have SMA less than the Earth but whose orbits cross Earth’s orbit. The Earth MOID is 0.0027207 AU, which makes it a potentially dangerous asteroid relative to Earth, though the probability of a collision with Earth in the future is very low according to research data. The asteroid, 27.4 in absolute magnitude, is several dozen metres in size, although the size is not accurately defined. It has a semi-major axis of 0.9268 AU and an orbital eccentricity of 0.38, making it travel as close as 0.57 AU (perihelion) and as far as 1.28 AU (aphelion) from the Sun. It has an inclination angle of 2.18 degrees with respect to the Earth’s orbit and thus can approach the Earth at a relatively close distance during a certain point. Interactions with Earth and Other Planets Observations of 2024 VK3 made recently enabled astronomers to track previous encounters and predict future close approaches. In the past decades, it had been closer to Earth, Moon, and Venus. In particular, in 1991, it got to the Moon at the nearest distance of 616,694 km and to the Earth at a distance of approximately 471,046 km that same day. The asteroid has also come within the orbit of Venus, with its closest approach in 1993 and 1995. In the future, the next close approach is predicted to occur in January 2025, where the asteroid will come within 0.0004 AU of the planet’s orbit, a date of particular significance. Though now the distance is as close as 3.3 million kilometres, scientists do not expect a hit but continue to observe the situation as new data is obtained. Since it has condition code 6, meaning that there is some doubt about the exact orbit but within predictable limits, JPL researchers are using continuous observation to bring improved trajectory models to determine whether there is a possibility of future impacts. This continued research means that care should be taken with NEOs because small changes in orbit can change the ability of the NEO to approach the earth in the future.

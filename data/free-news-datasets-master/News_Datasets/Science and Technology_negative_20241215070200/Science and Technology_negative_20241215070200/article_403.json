    "text": "Highlights - Dogwifhat smart whale sparks market discussions with massive dump. - The whale swaps WIF for SOL, in turn booking profits. - WIF price crashed intraday, with investors speculating on future movements. A Dogwifhat smart whale caused a stir across the broader cryptocurrency landscape on Friday, heavily dumping the dog-themed meme token. Recent on-chain statistics indicate that the smart whale traded a whopping 850K coins to book a notable profit of $7.5 million. This trade strategy garnered significant attention as WIF price crashed over 15% intraday, sparking uncertain investor sentiments over whether the token may have topped amid a bull market. Dogwifhat Smart Whale Dumps 850K Tokens Sparking Market Speculations According to the data offered by Lookonchain on November 15, a smart whale was recorded dumping 850,000 Dogwifhat tokens, in turn swapping it for 15,987 SOL worth $3.4 million. As per the data, the smart whale address 3cBB2Z.. made the trades. However, despite the massive dump, the whale still held 50,000 WIF, worth $175K. Notably, the whale booked a total profit of $7.5 million on the [leading dog-themed meme token](https://coingape.com/top-dog-themed-memecoins/) with the mentioned trades weighing in. While this profit-making strategy underscored the meme coin’s potential to offer substantial gains, it also signaled a loss of investor confidence in the asset’s future potential. Besides, the massive dump sparks bearish concerns among traders amid a bull market while the existing holding still projects some optimism on price ahead, sparking market speculations. Also, on-chain data showed that the whale also booked a notable profit on recently listed the Solana meme coin PNUT. The whale spent 3,800 SOL to bag 1.74 million PNUT, now holding an unrealized profit of $2.07 million. [Solscan’s data](https://solscan.io/account/3cBB2ZyoNy8YEquSSzR2Rpggp9vcrfz4NcbCKHp7BzvT) showed that other token holdings by the same address included GIGACHAD (GIGA) and Chaos and Disorder (CHAOS), among other tokens. Overall, market participants speculate over WIF price action’s future in light of the massive dump and an intraday crash. What’s Next For WIF Price? At press time, WIF price crashed 16% over the past day and is now trading at $3.54. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $3.38 and $4.33, respectively. Further, the token’s intraday trading volume dipped 48% to $1.99 billion today. This slumping action aligns with the declining market confidence for the asset, as illustrated by the abovementioned massive dump. Meanwhile, Coinglass data indicated that the Dogwifhat futures OI dipped 19% to $609.02 million today. Moreover, the derivatives volume also plunged 41% to $4.17 billion. This data further signaled a loss of investor interest in the asset. Nevertheless, in light of a bullish crypto market in Q4 as an aftermath of Donald Trump’s win in the U.S. elections, the crypto market glimmers hope for future movements. In the wake of these bullish aspects, a recent [Dogwifhat price analysis](https://coingape.com/markets/will-dogwifhat-price-hit-ath-this-week/) by CoinGape Media indicated that the token also eyes a new ATH shortly ahead. Although this bullish projection comes contrary to the selloff, market watchers continue to extensively monitor the token as sentiments of further gains prevail.

    "text": "[Europe](../) EU SMEs well behind on digitalisation, Eurostat report finds Only 58% of EU small and medium enterprises have reached a basic level of digital services, an enormous 32 percentage points behind the goal set by the EU Commission for 2030. European businesses are struggling to evolve from a digital point of view. Only 58% of small and medium enterprises –[ which make up the vast majority of businesses in the EU ](//www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/10/30/in-which-eu-countries-are-the-most-businesses-being-launched)– have reached a basic level of digital services, Eurostat reports. That is a long way from [the goal of 90% by 2030](//commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/europes-digital-decade-digital-targets-2030_en), which was set by the EU. Large enterprises, meaning those with at least 250 employees, fare much better: 91% have reached a basic level of digitalisation. In general, the countries with the most businesses on a “very low level of digital intensity” are Romania (72.1%), Bulgaria (70.6%) and Greece (56.2%). On the opposite side of the spectrum (very high level of digital intensity) are Finland (13.0%), Malta (11.4%) the Netherlands (11.0%). What does ‘digital intensity’ mean? The Digital Intensity Index (DII) is an indicator used by the EU to establish a business’s level of digitalisation. Having a “basic level of digital intensity” means using at least four of 12 digital technologies – such as AI, social media, cloud computing, and Customer Relationship Management – or having e-commerce sales accounting for at least 1% of total turnover.

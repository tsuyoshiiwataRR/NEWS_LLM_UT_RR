    "text": "In the third quarter of this year, the production rates of South Korea's three major battery makers, known as K-Battery companies, saw a sharp decline. This decrease is attributed to adjustments in production volume, as automakers adjust their inventory in response to a temporary lull in demand for electric vehicles (EVs). However, despite these reductions in factory activity, the K-Battery companies are continuing to ramp up investments in research and development (R&D) to secure their future. According to quarterly reports published on the 14th, LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, and SK On reported declines in utilization rates, impacted by a slowdown in demand from downstream industries. LG Energy Solution’s average production facility utilization rate dropped to 59.8% in Q3, a double-digit decrease from the same period last year, which was at 72.9%. Samsung SDI disclosed only the utilization rate for its energy solution (small battery) division, which showed an average utilization rate of 68% in the first half of this year, down from 77% in the same period last year. Samsung SDI also reported a Q3 operating profit of 129.9 billion KRW, down 72% year-over-year, mainly due to reduced cylindrical battery production driven by lower EV battery sales. SK On also experienced a significant drop in utilization rates, with an average utilization of 46.2% in Q3 compared to 94.9% for the same period last year. Despite the prolonged EV market slowdown, the K-Battery companies have not held back on investments in future technology. In Q3, their combined R&D spending reached 1.99 trillion KRW, up 11.4% from last year's 1.78 trillion KRW. Samsung SDI invested the most in R&D, allocating 986 billion KRW, a 17% increase compared to the same period last year. LG Energy Solution invested 795.3 billion KRW, an 8.9% increase year-over-year. SK On spent 210.4 billion KRW in Q3, slightly down from the previous year's 220.6 billion KRW, as the company sought to control the pace of investment and improve operational efficiency amid ongoing financial losses. The percentage of R&D costs relative to sales also rose across all three companies. SK On nearly doubled its R&D spending ratio, reaching 7.7%, while Samsung SDI and LG Energy Solution increased by 2.8 and 1.3 percentage points, respectively, to reach 7.7% and 4.1%. However, analysts remain pessimistic about the K-Battery companies' Q4 performance, citing the delayed recovery in EV demand, year-end inventory adjustments, and potential one-time costs. KB Securities analyst Jeon Woo-jae forecasts a Q4 operating loss of 89.1 billion KRW for LG Energy Solution, citing factors such as lower sales in the U.S., declining battery prices due to falling nickel and lithium prices, and year-end inventory adjustments. Kim Hyun-soo, an analyst at Hana Securities, expressed a bleak outlook for Samsung SDI in Q4, predicting that while energy storage system (ESS) sales may increase, a minimal rise in prismatic cell shipments and continued decline in cylindrical cell shipments could lead to underwhelming sales and profit performance. Meanwhile, Lee Jin-myeong from Shinhan Investment & Securities noted that SK On may face a return to operating losses in Q4 but anticipates an improvement in fundamentals starting next year with the recovery of the North American EV market. sunone@chosunbiz.com",

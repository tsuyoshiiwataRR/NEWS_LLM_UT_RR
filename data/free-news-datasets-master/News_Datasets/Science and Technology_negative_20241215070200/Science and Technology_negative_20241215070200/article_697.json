    "text": "Bluesky, a microblogging platform, is experiencing a significant increase in users, leading to some technical difficulties. The platform reported welcoming one million new users this week alone, reaching a total of 15 million users by Wednesday. This surge in popularity led to reports of outages on Thursday, according to Downdetector.Bluesky, owned by Jay Graber, climbed to the top of the App Store rankings on November 14, as reported by Business Insider. A live tracker by Bluesky employee Jaz indicated the platform surpassed 16 million users, coinciding with the reported outages.Several factors contribute to Bluesky's growing user base, including dissatisfaction with changes on other social media platforms. Several high-profile celebrities have recently announced their departure from competitor platform X, formerly known as Twitter. Among them is American television journalist Don Lemon, who shared his reasons in a video: “I once believed it was a place for honest debate, discussion, transparency, and free speech. But now, I feel it no longer serves that purpose.” Other notable figures like Jamie Lee Curtis, Elton John, Mia Farrow, Whoopi Goldberg, and Lizzo have also transitioned to Bluesky.",

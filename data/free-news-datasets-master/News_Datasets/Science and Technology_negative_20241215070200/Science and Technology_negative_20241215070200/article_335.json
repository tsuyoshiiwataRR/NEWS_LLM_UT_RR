    "text": "3 weeks ago\nHello, I just recently purchase Google Chromecast but when I open the Netflix app it shows Error Code: ui-800-3 any fix for this?\nI already tried reinstalling netflix. Turning off and on Chromecast.\nAnswered!\n[Go to the Recommended Answer.](/t5/Streaming/Netflix-Error-Code-ui-800-3/m-p/653957#M58457)\na week ago\nHey all,\nApologies for the delay - here's the latest: the team has identified a root cause and are working toward rolling out a fix. I don't have a timeline to communicate at this time, but I'll keep you updated as I hear more.\nThank you,\nKélan\n3 weeks ago\n[@Ashepherdson](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/834) : and the strange thing is , i am getting the same error when i try to cast netflix through my phone or ipad as well.\n3 weeks ago\nThat makes sense. On the CCwGTV Netflix treats it as a streaming device , so casting just runs through the app rather than traditional casting as it would be on a regular Chromecast. So if the app isn't working properly then casting wouldn't work either.\nAs the other user has said, if in fact this is some sort of software issue, the best bet would be to contact Google support. I will escalate this and see if anyone can address it.\n3 weeks ago\nYes, I did contact Google Support, they are saying its Netflix issue and not Chromecast issue, and Netflix customer support is saying its a hardware issue, not their issue.\n3 weeks ago\nSo standard tech support run around.. that sucks.\nIf you don't have any network settings blocking the connection (say custom DNS on your router or device), and you have tried signing out of Netflix then signing back in, I have already escalated so we will have to wait for either Google or Netflix to respond.\n3 weeks ago\nThis is a Google problem, not a Netflix problem, and you should be very clear about this, so just contact Google.\n3 weeks ago\nI urge you to report and urge this problem as soon as possible. This problem occurred after pushing the STTL.240812.006 version system. Previous versions will not cause this problem. MFG 2020 and 2021 have this problem. I saw some netizens report that 01/2022 also has this problem, but I tried 04/2022 and it doesn't have this problem, because different MFG time, the factory system version is different.\n3 weeks ago\nI mean a newly opened google tv 4k produced in 2020, not the device you have been using for the past few years. Because the newly opened device must be updated to the latest system when it is set up for the first time, and the latest system version is STTL.240812.006. The first time you open the device and update it to this version, this problem will occur. The device you have been using, based on the existing system, will not have Netflix errors if it is updated to the current latest system. I have compared myself, because I have several google tv 4k, I don’t know if I have described this problem accurately.\n3 weeks ago\nsame error，unless Google fixes this bug through a system update\n3 weeks ago\nhope that Google's software team can investigate and solve this problem as soon as possible. It has seriously affected the use of Netflix to watch streaming movies and TV shows. Thank you.\n3 weeks ago\nHello Kelan,\nAny update on this please.\n2 weeks ago\nFollowing up on this issue?\n2 weeks ago - last edited 2 weeks ago\nHello kelan any update from Google on this please..\na week ago\nHey all,\nApologies for the delay - here's the latest: the team has identified a root cause and are working toward rolling out a fix. I don't have a timeline to communicate at this time, but I'll keep you updated as I hear more.\nThank you,\nKélan\na week ago\nThank you so much Kelan Will just wait for the fix hopefully soon\nyesterday\nHello, i'm from argentina, 1 month ago i bought one Chromecast 4 k and has the same problem, but today i bought another one (same date producted, same model and color) and netflix is working fine. What i saw configuring both devices is that both have diferences like diferent screens for selecting language or configuring the remote controlar, it's like both have diferent version of operative system\nyesterday\nGoogle Support reached out to me. They said they deployed a fix. I can confirm it is working now.\nI am uncertain how the fix was deployed. My Chromecast About doesn't show any new updates installed since the last time I confirmed it not working. My Netflix app is version 11.0.8 build 19823, which looks like was released Oct 24th -- but I didn't check if this is different than version when it wasn't working. So maybe the fix was in a Netflix app update? Or maybe it was something server side?\n2 hours ago\nMy \"Chromecast with Google TV (4K)\" has the same release and build numbers but I'm still getting the error message. Did a factory reset again as well to see if that would help but still nothing.. wonder if this fix is being released in phases?",

    "text": "Vitalik: Compared to Ethereum, Solana is overly centralized, and there are indeed differences in the market goals pursued by Ethereum Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said in an interview: On the internet, many people have expressed some ideas that I find strange, such as Ethereum's values are useless and Crypto is a gambling market. However, within the Ethereum community, their participation in Ethereum is because we have some values and life ideals that we particularly value. We want to create an open world and a decentralized blockchain platform. We will develop sustainable applications and applications that make society better. In addition, when asked \"how do you view Solana\", Vitalik said: I think they are really more centralized than Ethereum. First of all, running Solana nodes is much harder than running Ethereum nodes; secondly, Solana's PoS is more centralized; thirdly, there are more things in the community directly supported by the Solana Foundation. Moreover, Solana's application requirements for decentralization are much lower than those of Ethereum. I think their pursuit of certain market goals is really different from that of Ethereum.

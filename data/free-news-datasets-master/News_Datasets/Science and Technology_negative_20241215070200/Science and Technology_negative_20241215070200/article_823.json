    "title": "Windscribe Review 2024 ‚Äî Can You Trust This Free VPN?",
    "text": "After its security breach, many people aren't sure if they can trust Windscribe ‚Äî one of the most popular free VPNs. If it couldn't protect its servers, can you really rely on it to keep you safe, especially without a subscription?\nI tested every feature Windscribe has, including performing leak tests and speed checks and testing it for torrenting, gaming, and more. I also thoroughly investigated its no-logs claim to see how it's improved since the breach.\nAfter my tests, I can confirm that Windscribe is safe and decent overall. It has strong security features and takes your privacy seriously. Its free version is one of the best available, but the paid version is lacking in a few areas. You can check out one of the best premium VPNs available in this list.\nShort on Time? Here Are My Key Findings\nPros\n- Excellent for streaming. My global team and I were impressed with the quality. See the full results of our tests here.\n- Fast speeds. Both the free and paid versions provided excellent results. Check out the complete breakdown of our tests here.\n- Solid performance for gaming. I could play games without lag on almost all nearby servers. Find out which servers worked best here.\n- Great security. It passed all of my leak tests. Read about the extra features you get with a paid subscription here.\n- Privacy-friendly. Its logging policy promises it won‚Äôt store your personal information. See if the policy has been audited here.\n- Compatible with most devices. You can use Windscribe on almost any operating system. Read about the differences between its native apps here.\nCons\n- Small network. It doesn‚Äôt offer as many servers as the top VPNs. See what you get with the free app here.\n- Weak support. It‚Äôs hard to get a hold of a real human. Find out how long it took to get email responses here.\nOnly $5.75\nWindscribe VPN is now only $5.75/month!\nMoney-Back Guarantee: 3 Days\nDon't miss this limited offer!\nGet it now!\nWindscribe VPN Features ‚Äî 2024 Update\n8.6\nüí∏ Price | 5.75 USD/month |\nüìÜ Money Back Guarantee | 3 Days |\nüìù Does VPN keep logs? | No |\nüñ• Number of servers | 177+ |\nüõ° Kill switch | Yes |\nüó∫ Based in country | Canada |\nüõ† Support | Bot support |\nüì• Supports torrenting | Yes |\nStreaming ‚Äî Great With the Paid Version\n9.4\nWindscribe can safely access all the top streaming platforms from anywhere with its premium app. On top of that, my global team and I could stream HD quality videos with both Windscribe premium and its free version.\nHowever, the 10GB data limit per month with the free version will only let you stream for around 7 hours max. So, it‚Äôs a decent way to test out Windscribe, but it‚Äôs not substantial enough for regular viewing.\nEditor‚Äôs note. The VPNs we recommend usually follow strict no-logging policies that prevent them from viewing your online activities. This means it‚Äôs up to you to use them responsibly. My team and I urge you to uphold all copyright laws.\nWorks With: Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Max, Peacock, BBC iPlayer, ESPN+, Channel 4, and ITVX\nWe didn‚Äôt have any issues streaming with any of the platforms in our tests. This was quite the feat since nearly every streaming platform uses anti-VPN technologies. These can prevent you from watching your favorite content, even if you‚Äôre in an approved location using a VPN server in your own country. Impressively, this never happened to us with Windscribe.\nIn the first test, we could securely view the full US Netflix library in great quality. Most videos loaded almost instantly with no buffering.\nIn fact, we could watch complete Netflix libraries from Australia, Japan, Canada, Brazil, France, and the UK in similar quality.\nVideos loaded quickly and played back without any buffering\nWindscribe can facilitate uninterrupted streaming on Max, Disney+, Peacock, and Amazon Prime Video from anywhere. What‚Äôs most impressive is that the free app works with these platforms too, but as stated above, your viewing time will be limited.\nOur tester didn‚Äôt experience buffering, long load times, or any dips in quality\nWe could also watch videos on ITV, BBC iPlayer, and other UK channels without issues. Overall, Windscribe is a great choice for streaming, but you‚Äôll have to get the premium version to really get anything out of it.\nSpeed ‚Äî Very Fast on Free and Premium Servers\n9.0\nWindscribe has some of the fastest free servers I‚Äôve tested, and paid servers are impressive too.\nWe use a dedicated speed tester to get our results. That way, all of the tests are done from the same location with the same connection. The chart below shows your results from the premium servers. However, we got comparable speeds with free servers. All tests were done with the WireGuard protocol since it gave us the best results.\nOur speeds fell 4% on servers nearby and 30% on distant ones\nServers nearby dropped our speeds less than 5%. That‚Äôs a great result because most VPNs lower your speeds by 15%, at least in that range.\nSpeeds were just a little slower with IKEv2 and OpenVPN UDP\nThe only issue is some protocols are very slow. I wanted to check out the speeds for myself, so I tested several servers using different protocols and noticed significant differences in speeds.\nFor instance, OpenVPN TCP and Wstunnel dropped my speeds by more than 15% when connected to my local server in Kenya. And, the Stealth protocol lowered my speeds by 45% or more each time.\nI also noticed that it has a few select 10GBPS servers, but when I tested them, my speeds weren‚Äôt significantly different from normal servers.\nI also tested all the free servers, and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Despite the nearest server being roughly 7,000 km away, my speed only fell 27%. That‚Äôs good because even the best VPNs can slow you down by up to 45% over similar distances. Overall, you won‚Äôt easily find a faster free VPN than Windscribe.\nGaming ‚Äî Smooth Gameplay On Nearby Servers\n8.4\nWhen I played Roblox on nearby Windscribe servers, everything went smoothly. My ping rates were under 85ms, which you need for responsive gameplay. Even servers far away, like one in Germany, gave me a low ping of just 18 ms, which is great for gaming. But I was surprised that my character froze randomly when I tried playing Roblox using this server.\nHe could enjoy smooth gameplay since his ping only raised 9ms\nPing is crucial in gaming because it shows how quickly the network reacts to your commands. When ping is high, the delay between pressing buttons and your character's actions can make games unplayable.\nOverall, I think Windscribe is pretty good for gaming, but only with its paid version. While I got similar results with the free version, its data limit will be used up quickly while you‚Äôre gaming.\nServer Network ‚Äî Good Coverage for a Small Network\n7.0\nWindscribe doesn‚Äôt have the largest network, but it gives you 177 servers in 69 countries. Actually, all of Windscribe‚Äôs servers are city-level, and there are 45+ different locations in the US, which tops what many of the most popular VPNs offer.\nThe list also displays 10GBPS and P2P-optimized servers\nAll of Windscribe‚Äôs servers are physically located as well. That means they‚Äôre actually in the city you connect to. Some VPNs offer virtual servers, which aren‚Äôt physically in the location listed.\nIt also uses some rented servers while it owns others. Unfortunately, the company doesn‚Äôt disclose a lot about its network, including the exact number of servers it owns. It did claim to have 177 in the past. Windscribe also makes use of RAM-only servers, which are more private since everything on them is deleted with each reboot.\nI also like that Windscribe lets you access several countries that many VPNs neglect, like Ecuador and Turkey, and they even have servers in Antarctica. You can also purchase static IP addresses, which are helpful if you need a consistent, encrypted IP to operate a website.\nThe free service lets you use the Hong Kong location, 10 US servers, and 8 European countries. Western Europe and North America have the most coverage for free and premium apps. I had no issues at all connecting to any server ‚Äî both near and far away.\nSecurity ‚Äî Plenty of Solid Features That Keep You Safe\n9.4\nWindscribe is very safe, and it comes with military-grade AES 256-bit encryption, which makes your data virtually unreadable. It includes an auto-enable feature for public networks. For remote home network access, you can use port forwarding. Although this requires an additional fee for a static IP ($2/month for a Datacenter IP and $8/month for a Residential IP).\nI also like that Windscribe provides advanced features like Perfect Forward Secrecy, Time Warp, split tunneling, and Location Warp for added privacy. There are even more rare features like double VPN and secure hotspot. In addition to supporting all the major protocols, it also has unique settings like packet size adjustment and API resolution.\nThe default settings work fine if you don't want to customize\nThese technical details might not matter to everyone, but they're a nice touch for those deeply interested in technology. Finally, its browser extensions offer a GPS-spoofing feature, and all of its desktop apps are open-source. So, Windscribe certainly isn‚Äôt lacking in this department.\nEncryption\nWindscribe secures your internet connection using the AES-256 cipher encryption, which is the same standard used by banks and many worldwide militaries. This means that the data you send and receive is encrypted in a way that makes it virtually impossible for anyone to decode.\nSecurity Protocols\nWindscribe lets you choose between the industry's best protocols, such as WireGuard, IKEv2, OpenVPN, and even its proprietary protocol, WStunnel. As you could see from our speed tests, WireGuard is the fastest. But, OpenVPN is often considered the most secure since it‚Äôs open-source and constantly checked for vulnerabilities.\nAdditionally, Windscribe includes SOCKS5 proxy support, which is useful for torrenting by masking your IP address, though it doesn't encrypt data like the other protocols.\nFirewall (Kill Switch)\nWindscribe calls its dedicated kill switch Firewall, and it works as advertised. This feature will disable the network if your VPN connection drops. To test it, I tried to open a tab while the VPN was connecting. It always blocked the page until the connection was complete. This is a necessary feature every VPN needs to have.\nIP & DNS Leak Protection\nWindscribe also offers reliable IP and DNS protection features that prevent leaks.\nMy true IP stayed hidden across tests on a dozen locations\nI was confident that Windscribe would keep my data private.\nR.O.B.E.R.T. (Ad Blocker)\nThis is a very customizable tool that serves as Windscribe‚Äôs ad and malware blocker. It does even more with the premium app. The paid version lets you block social networks, porn, gambling, clickbait, and more. It‚Äôs a nice addition, although some things like native banner ads would still show up occasionally, even with it activated.\nPrivacy ‚Äî A Great Policy With a Few Minor Issues\n7.0\nI can recommend Windscribe as a private VPN because it follows a strict no-logs policy. You‚Äôre not even required to enter your email address when signing up. This is rare and makes its free option one of the safest.\nWindscribe also offers transparency reports that verify its policy. These let you see any time there have been DMCA requests for its data, and they show that Windscribe has never shared anything.\nMy main complaint is that Windscribe hasn‚Äôt undergone any independent audits, which is surprising, especially after a government body seized a portion of its servers.\nDoes Windscribe Keep Logs? No\nWindscribe doesn‚Äôt log any unnecessary data. This is nice to know since Windscribe is one of the VPNs whose servers have been seized by the government before. In 2021, two Windscribe servers were seized in Ukraine as part of an investigation by local authorities.\nHowever, the authorities weren‚Äôt able to recover any information since Windscribe does not store session logs or timestamps. It doesn‚Äôt collect your IP address, or the sites you‚Äôve visited either.\nIt doesn't log any data while you're connected\nLike most top VPNs, Windscribe only stores anonymous data that‚Äôs necessary for maintaining the service. While you're connected, the server's memory will have your OpenVPN/IKEv2 username, the time of connection, and the amount of data transferred. The privacy policy also clearly states that all of this is deleted as soon as you disconnect.\nWas Windscribe Audited? No\nWindscribe hasn‚Äôt undergone any third-party audits. When I asked this question through chat support, the chatbot confirmed that the privacy policy has gone through regular internal audits but hasn‚Äôt undergone a public third-party audit. I do hope they get an independent and transparent audit in the future ‚Äî following the example of the best premium providers.\nBased in Canada\nCanada is not the best location for a VPN‚Äôs headquarters because it‚Äôs in the 5 Eyes Alliance. This is an agreement between several countries to share data on their citizens. Luckily, the VPN doesn‚Äôt store any data that could compromise its users. Still, if privacy is crucial to you, there are many VPNs headquartered in more privacy-friendly countries.\nDoes Windscribe Work in China? Maybe\nWindscribe‚Äôs support claims it‚Äôs possible to use the VPN in China. However, they warn that you‚Äôll probably have to access different features and protocols to get it working.\nMost VPNs I have tested struggle to work in China\nThe agent recommended trying Stealth and WStunnel protocols as these are the most efficient in highly restricted countries like China. This was a bit disappointing because, in my experience, these protocols are the slowest. If you‚Äôre looking for a faster option in China, you can check out these VPNs that have all been proven to work in the country.\nThe Chinese government has banned many VPNs, but there have been no publicly-reported cases of it going after people for using them. However, my team and I don‚Äôt condone any illegal activities. I suggest you read the laws before deciding to use a VPN in China.\nTorrenting ‚Äî Slow Downloads on Most Servers\n5.0\nYou can torrent on nearly every server, but Windscribe slowed down my download speeds significantly. It took almost 1 hour to complete a 1.62GB file; I could download the same torrent in 15 minutes without the VPN. This happened even though I was on my local server in Nairobi.\nTo be sure, I tried downloading the same file at different times of the day and had similar results. The only servers you can‚Äôt use for P2P are located in India, Lithuania, Russia, and South Africa.\nWindscribe offers port forwarding, which should facilitate slightly faster downloads. However, it only shortened my download waits by a few minutes.\nIf you want to download copyright-free files fast, check out these VPNs. Just be aware that torrenting is legal in most countries, but accessing copyrighted files isn‚Äôt. We ask that you please only download torrents in the public domain to be sure you don‚Äôt break any laws.\nInstallation & Apps\n8.8\nInstallation & Apps ‚Äî Easy to Install and Use\nWindscribe is easy to use, although its interface isn‚Äôt the most attractive. I never had any issues connecting to servers or accessing the settings, but it‚Äôs missing some of the eye candy its competitors offer, like interactive maps.\nThere are 4 settings tabs and tabs for your account and tips\nHowever, it makes up for this with tons of customization options. You‚Äôll have a tough time finding a VPN that lets you tweak more aspects of your app, so that‚Äôs a big plus if you‚Äôre a techie.\nSetup & Installation\nIt only took me a few minutes to install Windscribe, no matter what device I was using.\nFor your mobile device, you'll install it from your store\nThe Linux app can be downloaded just as fast, too, since it offers a full GUI. That means you won‚Äôt have to control it through the command line, which can be a little clunky. I also like that the free version is available for Linux since many VPNs don‚Äôt offer that.\nDevice Compatibility\nWindscribe gives you a way to connect to its servers on nearly any device. There are native apps for every popular OS. Its proxy gateway feature also allows you to connect game consoles and smart TVs easily. Plenty of options exist for setting it up on a router, so you can use it on anything connected to your network. So, it rivals the best VPNs in this category.\nDesktop ‚Äî Apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux\nEach desktop app is similar, with a few key differences. The Windows app comes with everything Windscribe offers except for the Network Whitelisting feature. The Mac app is missing the ‚ÄúAlways On‚Äù feature and split tunneling.\nAndroid and iPhone (iOS)\nMobile apps are almost the same as desktop versions, but they each lose a few features. The Android app misses out on the very crucial kill switch. You‚Äôll get that on iOS, but that app doesn‚Äôt come with network whitelisting, split tunneling, the Stealth protocol, or the ‚ÄúAlways On‚Äù option. Neither phone version lets you access proxy settings either.\nBrowser Extensions for Chrome, Firefox, & Edge\nOverall, I‚Äôm impressed by Windscribe‚Äôs browser extensions. These come with many features other VPNs don‚Äôt offer. You can use all of the same servers you use on the other apps, plus double-hop. It can also automatically pick the best server for you, block ads, and prevent WebRTC leaks.\nWhat I liked most was the Cookie Monster feature that automatically deletes all the cookies you‚Äôve accepted as soon as you close the tab. Another unique Windscribe feature is Split Personality, which randomly rotates your user agent to hide your OS and browser version. These also offer ‚ÄúAuto Pilot‚Äù, a best location feature that also changes servers depending on the sites you visit.\nThese extensions are very popular, especially because they can easily be used for free. However, you just need to remember they‚Äôre only proxies. That means they don‚Äôt fully encrypt your connection, so you‚Äôre always safer using the full app.\nApps for Amazon Fire TV and Nvidia Shield\nYou can download native apps for Fire TV and Nvidia Shield. These don‚Äôt look quite the same as the other apps, but they get the job done and even offer split tunneling.\nThere are no apps for game consoles, but you can connect them easily. This can be done with the proxy gateway feature. Basically, this lets you connect any device with proxy settings through your computer. It‚Äôs easy to set up, but it can be a little slower than smart DNS due to the rerouting.\nWindscribe does offer smart DNS, but it charges extra. Since many VPNs offer this along with your subscription, I don‚Äôt recommend paying for it.\nRouter Compatibility\nYou can install Windscribe on DD-WRT, Tomato, and some builds of ASUSWRT/ASUSWRT-Merlin routers. It also sells its own Invizbox pre-configured routers. Setting it up on a router lets you connect any WiFi-enabled device in your household. However, you can find VPNs that offer more robust router options here.\nSimultaneous Device Connections\nYou can connect as many devices as you want with a free or paid account. This is a great feature; almost no free VPNs offer unlimited simultaneous connections. I tested it out by connecting it to my laptop, iPad and 3 Android phones, and my speeds weren‚Äôt affected.",

    "text": "2024-11-14 19:13:00\n​ ‍ ‌ ⁣\n‍ ‌ ​ ‍ ⁣ ⁢\n⁤ ⁤ ⁣ ⁢\n‍ ⁤ ‍ ⁣ ⁤+A-\n⁣ ⁢ ⁢ ‌\nScientists from Tomsk University studied the ​effect of a‍ 5G antenna on the body of rats\nScientists from Tomsk State University (TSU) studied⁢ the effect of a ​5G antenna on the‌ body of ‌rats. It turned out that radiation ⁤ caused⁣ changes in​ the ⁣animals’ brain tissue. RBC writes it in its Telegram channel.\nAccording to‌ Natalya Krivova, a⁢ researcher ‌at the Laboratory of Experimental Physiology of the ⁣Research Institute of Biology and Biophysics of TSU, the results of the study showed⁢ that in​ animals⁢ exposed ‌to the 5G antenna,‍ none of‍ the studied indicators differed‌ from‍ those of rats from ⁣groups of check.\nUnder the ⁢influence of radiation, the​ animals did not experience pain, fear, stress and found‍ themselves in complete ‌well-being. But a more detailed study of rats’ brain tissue after exposure to ⁣a 5G antenna revealed a significant change in the ratio of antioxidants to pro-oxidants, the biologist noted.\nScientists do not yet know what consequences this can lead ‌to: positive ​(for ​example, the emergence of new abilities), negative (loss of any abilities) or whether the body ⁤will be able to ⁣compensate for these ⁤violations.\n#Radiation⁢ #antenna⁤ #brain #tissue #rats\nWhat are the ‌potential impacts of increased user⁣ awareness on‌ social media privacy? Interview Format: Time.news Editor and Expert on Future of Social ⁢Media\nTime.news Editor : Good evening and welcome to Time.news! Today we⁤ have a special guest, Dr.‍ Emily Harper, a leading expert⁤ in digital communication and⁣ social media trends. Dr. Harper, thank you for joining us today!\nDr. Emily⁣ Harper : Thank you⁢ for having ‌me! It’s a pleasure to be here.\nEditor : Let’s​ dive right in. With the recent developments in social media platforms, especially regarding privacy concerns and user engagement, how do​ you see the landscape​ evolving over the next few years?\nDr. Harper : I think we’re at⁢ a crucial turning point. Users are becoming increasingly aware of their digital footprints and privacy issues. This ‍heightened awareness is prompting platforms to rethink their strategies. We might⁢ see a shift towards​ more transparent practices, where users are more informed and have‍ more ⁢control over their data.\nEditor : That’s ⁣an interesting ⁤perspective. So, considering this shift, do you think‍ that new platforms will ⁢emerge that prioritize user privacy over advertising revenue?\nDr.⁣ Harper : ​Absolutely. We’re already seeing some startups focus on creating user-centric platforms that offer enhanced‌ privacy features. These platforms are appealing to a segment of users who are disillusioned with traditional social media models. It’s a classic case ‌of market ⁢demand driving innovation.\nEditor : Speaking of innovation, how do you see artificial intelligence impacting content moderation and user⁤ engagement⁣ on these platforms?\nDr.​ Harper : AI is ‍set to play a pivotal role. On one hand, it can⁣ improve content moderation by filtering harmful content more ⁢effectively,​ creating a safer environment.⁤ On the⁢ other hand, ‌there’s a risk of over-reliance on algorithms, which may ‍stifle genuine conversation and creativity. The key will be finding the ‌right balance.\nEditor : And what about the potential backlash against AI influence in ‌social media? How‌ do you think users will respond?\nDr. Harper : That’s a valid concern. ⁣If users feel that AI is taking away the⁣ human element of interaction or if they believe⁤ that algorithms are⁢ manipulating their feeds unfairly, we could see a significant backlash. People crave authenticity and connection. Platforms that fail to prioritize‌ these⁣ elements may struggle to⁣ retain their user base.\nEditor : Very insightful. Now, let’s talk about the role of influencers. How do you see their role changing as ‌we ‍move into⁤ 2025 and beyond?\nDr. Harper : Influencers are evolving too. As consumers become more discerning, they’re gravitating ⁣towards authenticity and relatability⁣ rather ⁣than just ⁤polished content. We ⁤might see a rise of micro-influencers who foster⁣ genuine connections with their audience. Brands will likely ⁤shift their focus from celebrity endorsements to these authentic ​voices.\nEditor : That certainly aligns ⁤with the growing trends of authenticity and transparency. Dr. Harper, if you‌ could predict one major⁤ trend in social media over the next decade, what would it be?\nDr. Harper :⁣ I believe we’ll see a dramatic​ increase in decentralized social media platforms. As users demand more control and ownership over their data, we might‍ move away from traditional, centralized models. This could lead ‌to⁢ a whole new era of digital interaction that ⁢prioritizes user ​agency⁣ and ⁢community building.\nEditor : Thank ‍you so much, ‌Dr. Harper! Your insights⁤ into the future of social media are incredibly thought-provoking. We appreciate you sharing your expertise with us!\nDr. Harper : Thank you for having me!​ It’s been a pleasure⁢ discussing these important ‍topics. ​\nEditor : And ⁢that’s ‍a wrap for today’s interview! ⁣Stay tuned ⁣for⁣ more engaging content at Time.news.",

    "text": "As mentioned in a previous topic, I have been having trouble getting my EA account deleted despite many requests. My account was never banned and I have never had any problems with EA until trying to delete my account with support.\nI have submitted support cases in the past to request that my account and all of its data is deleted under the GDPR, however these have been met with requests to verify my email or details. Upon replying to verify, my response in-turn opens up a new case with a new member of EA support who asks me for the same verification, making the process circular and impossible to proceed, and littering my account with duplicate support cases regarding the same matter.\nI have submitted a new case as of yesterday, but this has been marked as resolved with no email correspondence or confirmation, even though the account still exists (I can log-in). No message or note appears under the case, despite me writing details about my request. There is no option or possibility to use live chat anywhere, whether logged into my EA account or not.\nCan someone please assist with this matter? It has now been over a year without any resolution since I have tried to delete my account and personal data with no success.\nThank you in advance for your help.\nSolved! Go to Solution.",

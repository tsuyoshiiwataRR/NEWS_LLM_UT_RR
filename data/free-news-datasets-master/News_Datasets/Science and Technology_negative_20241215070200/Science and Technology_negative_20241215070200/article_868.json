    "text": "LEGO Horizon Adventures, the latest PlayStation-published game on Steam, has had a disappointing launch, reaching only 602 concurrent players on its first day.\n[LEGO Horizon Adventures](https://www.altchar.com/games/lego), the latest and newest release from[ Sony](https://www.altchar.com/publishers/sony) for the [PC](https://www.altchar.com/platforms/pc), has gotten off to a less-than-stellar start. It has just set an unfortunate record of the worst launch performance of any PlayStation-published game on [Steam, ](https://www.altchar.com/publishers/steam)peaking at only 602 concurrent players on its first day.\nThat figure clears the boards and puts the title below even Sackboy: A Big Adventure, which took the previous low at 610 peak concurrent players upon its delayed release to PC in 2022. LEGO Horizon Adventures is a brand-new title, though, making these figures all the more worrying.\nIt also does terribly among the other LEGO games on Steam, placing fourth-lowest in peak players out of the 24 listed. LEGO Horizon Adventures is also available on [PS5](https://www.altchar.com/platforms/playstation/playstation-5) and [Nintendo Switch](https://www.altchar.com/platforms/nintendo/switch), but its Steam launch is particularly disappointing given that the Horizon franchise typically performs well on PC.\nPrevious PlayStation-to-PC titles, like [Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered](https://www.altchar.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn) and [Until Dawn](https://www.altchar.com/game-news/can-you-run-until-dawn-on-your-rig-check-out-the-official-pc-system-specs-to-find-out-aDj2X4k5gUAx), have also struggled to capture strong launch numbers on the platform, suggesting a worrying trend for Sonyâ€™s PC publishing strategy.\nLoyal players of the Horizon series and LEGO titles might still be there to pick up the game on other platforms, but poor launch on PC isn't exactly setting it up for a strong comeback.\nThe weekend is about to kick in, which may allow for a slight increase in player numbers. However, starting that low makes it anyone's guess whether the interest in the game can improve or gain attention worth noting.\nUntil we find out more, LEGO Horizon Adventures is off to a difficult uphill climb for success on PC. Whether the game would have done better under other circumstances is anybody's guess and should leave Sony to reconsider the way it designs future launches.\nDON'T MISS:\n[\n](/game-news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-update-adds-photo-mode-features-fixes-bugs-and-enhances-gameplay-aUohT6s6wJI5)\nDragon Age: The Veilguard update adds Photo Mode features, fixes bugs, and enhances gameplay\nDragon Age: The Veilguard update adds Photo Mode features, fixes bugs, and enhances gameplay\nPhoto Mode receives updates with new filters and quality-of-life improvements, including easier naming conventions and descriptive setting descriptions.\n[\n](/game-news/the-most-popular-league-of-legends-skins-in-2024-afU3R6f1z50G)\nThe most popular League of Legends skins in 2024\nThe most popular League of Legends skins in 2024\nLeague of Legends skins enhance players' gameplay with visual effects, sound changes, and unique animations.

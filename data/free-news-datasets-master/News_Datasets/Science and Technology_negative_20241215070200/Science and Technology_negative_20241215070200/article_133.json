    "text": "With today’s Season 1 launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, not only are players getting new maps, modes and weapons, but we’re also getting a load of weapon tuning adjustments on all weapon types. Now, for those playing the shooter and primarily use the Assault Rifles, you might have noticed some inconsistencies with your time-to-kill (TTK), how it feels like you need more bullets to kill an enemy than before, and more. If you are, well, you’ll be happy to hear that it’s not you nor has your skills degraded with one patch.\nApparently, Treyarch has accidentally reverted the Assault Rifle damage and range values to their original launch state rather than applying the Season 1 changes. Nope, I wish I was kidding, but I’m not. This was confirmed by YouTuber and Call of Duty stats guy TheXclusive Ace.\nBlack Ops 6 Assault Rifle Damage and Range Stats Are Back to Launch State Accidentally Due to the S1 Patch Over on Twitter, Ace made the announcement, which I’m assuming comes from his testing of the Assault Rifles to see how much they changed with the S1 patch applied. In response, Treyarch Associate Director of Design Matt Scronce tweeted that they are looking into it.\nTeams are looking into it.\n— Matt Scronce (@MaTtKs) November 14, 2024\nSadly, this is not the only issue that has surfaced with today’s massive seasonal content drop. The Ghost perk appears locked for players even if they’ve hit the required level of 17. For now, Treyarch has it marked on their Trello board as something they’re investigating.\nOver on TheXclusive Ace’s video about the Season changes, he left the following message pinned to let the community know what’s happening, stating, “HEADS UP: At the moment, all of the Assault Rifles are bugged. Most have reverted to their launch values for damage and range and some, like the AMES 85 are even worse off. This means, the information I share in this video for ARs is not currently working as they intended for Season 1. Treyarch has confirmed that they’re looking into it so I suspect they should be able to get on top of this issue fairly quickly (I’ll delete this comment once they fix the issue). All of the other classes of weapons appear to be working as intended with the Season 1 values.”\nFor those feeling like it takes way longer to down someone in multiplayer, well, now you know. Just maybe avoid the assault rifles until Treyarch patches this, lest you like playing with a slight handicap.\nChances are, we’ll be getting a patch very soon to address this and the Ghost perk issue, and once we know more about that, we’ll let our readers know.",

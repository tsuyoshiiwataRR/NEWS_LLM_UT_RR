Once you start having to consciously learn all this stuff, you suddenly realise that it's taking you longer and longer, and at some point the time taken to learn exceeds that said half-life ... whoops ...\nI'm very much hitting that barrier now, exacerbated by the fact that so much of this tech doesn't interest me, so I'm forced to learn it on behalf of other people (who are ill/old and incapable of learning), so I have to re-learn it EVERY time I try and use it. What a waste of time ... and the youngsters can't even understand the problem !!! That's the really infuriating thing !!!\n\"For those without a smart-phone, there's an app for that\" - yes I REALLY DID see that in one of my company's internal FAQs ...\nCheers,\nWol",

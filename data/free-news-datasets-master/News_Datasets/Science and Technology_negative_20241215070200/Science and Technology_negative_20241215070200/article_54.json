    "text": "2024-11-14 20:00:00\nAustralia wants to ban access to social media for young people. In addition, providers will in future be required to continuously analyze potential risks and take action against them. The Social Democratic government in Canberra has presented plans for corresponding laws. As Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said on Thursday, we must stop “reacting to harm through content regulation alone.” Instead, providers of online services should be subject to an active duty of care. In the future, they should continually assess risks for users and then “take appropriate steps to prevent damage.”\n1731617793\n#Australia #considers #social #media #ban #16s #Australia\n– What are the main concerns driving the Australian government’s proposal for social media regulations aimed at protecting youth? **Interview with Communications Minister Michelle Rowland on Proposed Social Media ⁢Regulations for Youth**\n**Editor:**⁢ Thank you⁤ for joining us⁢ today, Minister Rowland.‌ Australia’s recent proposal to ban social media access for young people has sparked considerable debate. Can you elaborate on ‌the⁤ motivation behind this initiative?\n**Michelle Rowland:** We recognize that the⁤ digital landscape can pose significant risks to ⁢young users. The idea is not just to react to the harms we see but ⁣to proactively⁣ create a safer online environment.‍ Our goal is to ensure that social media providers are accountable and take their responsibility seriously in protecting⁤ our youth.\n**Editor:**‌ Many argue ⁤that banning social media could infringe on young ⁣people’s freedom of expression and social engagement. How does your government reconcile this with ‍the need for regulation?\n**Michelle Rowland:** It’s ‍a valid concern. We’re aiming for a balanced approach. The proposed regulations are not about outright banning social media but ensuring that providers implement effective measures to protect their young users. We believe that with the right strategies in place,​ we can foster a safer online environment without stifling ‍youth interaction.\n**Editor:** What specific actions will social media companies be required to take under these new laws to ensure the safety of younger users?\n**Michelle Rowland:** ‌The plan involves a continuous assessment ​of ​potential‌ risks associated with their platforms. Providers will need ‍to take ⁣proactive measures to mitigate ⁣these risks, ⁢whether through improved privacy ⁢settings, more robust monitoring of harmful content, or direct support for users in distress.\n**Editor:** Considering the global nature of social media, how will Australia ensure compliance from overseas companies?\n**Michelle Rowland:** That’s indeed a challenge,⁣ but we are coordinating with international standards​ and lobbying for global cooperation. We ⁤can also impose​ penalties for non-compliance, making it clear that we take these issues seriously.\n**Editor:** Minister Rowland, how do you envision the public’s reaction⁤ to these measures? ⁣Do you believe there will be widespread ⁤support or ⁢pushback?\n**Michelle Rowland:** I ​anticipate a mixed⁢ reaction. On ⁣one hand, many parents and guardians will welcome measures that prioritize their children’s safety. On the other hand, some young people and advocates for ⁤digital rights⁤ may feel restricted. This is a conversation we need to have as a society. What do you think—should the‍ government intervene in this way, or should young people be allowed more ⁤freedom to navigate social media on their own?",

    "text": "People with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes may face heart disease up to 28 years earlier than others, according to research presented at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2024.\nThe study examined cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, analyzing simulated patient profiles of men and women aged 30-79. Researchers found elevated cardiovascular risks can begin decades earlier in those with kidney disease or diabetes compared to healthy individuals.\n“Our study shows that risk for cardiovascular disease varies significantly based on a person’s age and other health conditions,” said lead researcher Vaishnavi Krishnan of Northwestern University. “Individuals with diabetes or kidney disease are at a much higher risk for heart disease even in their 30s.”\nThe research identified chronic kidney disease through an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 44.5, indicating stage 3 kidney disease. Women without CKM conditions typically see increased cardiovascular risk around age 68, while men face elevated risk at 63.\n“This is truly a call to action, to both identify those at such risk and to begin more aggressive treatment earlier than we have traditionally felt necessary,” said Dr. Richard Wright, board-certified cardiologist.\nThe findings suggest even borderline high blood pressure, glucose levels or kidney function may pose hidden risks before formal diagnosis.\nDr. Cheng-Han Chen, board-certified interventional cardiologist, emphasized the need for coordinated care. “By considering these conditions in concert, we may be able to come up with better treatments to help improve health outcomes,” Chen said.\nHealth care providers should consider:\n– Earlier screening for cardiovascular risks\n– More aggressive treatment protocols\n– Integrated management of kidney and heart conditions\n– Regular monitoring of patients with borderline readings\n– Coordinated care among specialists\nThe research could lead to revised guidelines for preventing heart disease in patients with kidney disorders and diabetes.",

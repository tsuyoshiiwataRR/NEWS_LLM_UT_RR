    "text": "Some users have reported that when they open the native Camera app of Windows 11/10, it doesn’t work or launch the camera. Instead, they see a Can’t start your camera error along with error code 0xA00F429E<PageOpenFailed> (0x80131505) on the app interface. The built-in camera, USB webcam, etc., works on some other apps say Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, etc., but not on the Windows Camera app. The camera doesn’t work at all for some other users, including the other apps. Those facing this issue can use the solutions given in this post to fix it.\nCan’t start your camera\nIf you’re sure the camera is connected and installed properly, try checking for updated drivers.\nIf you need it, here’s the error code:\n0xA00F429E<PageOpenFailed> (0x80131505)\nCan’t start your camera, Error 0xA00F429E<PageOpenFailed> (0x80131505) If you can’t start your camera or webcam and see a 0xA00F429E<PageOpenFailed> (0x80131505) error code instead, use these fixes:\nReconnect the camera Turn on camera access for affected apps Use Camera Troubleshooter in the Get Help app Update or reinstall the camera driver Repair or reset the Camera app. Let’s check these options.\n1] Reconnect the camera This solution worked for me. The problem occurred to me when I tried connecting my phone camera as a webcam using the Phone Link app on my Windows 11 laptop. Once I reconnected the camera and adjusted notification and other settings for the Phone Link app and Link to Windows app on PC and mobile, it started working.\nSo, reconnect the camera or webcam for which you face this issue, adjust its settings carefully, and restart your PC. If you are using a wired webcam, connect it to a different USB port , and see if it helps. Also, if your device has a camera switch or button , make sure it is turned on before using the camera.\n2] Turn on camera access for affected apps\nThis solution is helpful if the webcam is working on a few apps but not on the Camera app and other apps. This can happen if the camera or webcam access is turned off or disabled for such apps. Navigate to Settings app > Privacy & security > Camera . Turn on the camera access for the apps (desktop applications and Microsoft Store apps) in the list under the Let apps access your camera section.\nRelated: Can’t start your camera, Error 0xA00F4246 (0x800706BE)\n3] Use Camera Troubleshooter in the Get Help app\nThe native Camera troubleshooter in the Get Help app of Windows PC can also be helpful in resolving this problem. It runs automatic diagnostics to help fix the camera problems.\nOpen the Settings app and navigate to Bluetooth & devices > Cameras . In the Connected cameras section, select a camera for which you get this error, and press the Troubleshoot button. The Get Help app will open. Click on the Troubleshoot Camera in Windows 11 option and follow the next steps to fix the issue.\n4] Update or reinstall the camera driver Outdated or corrupt drivers cause issues for devices. So, this can also be the reason you get this 0xA00F429E<PageOpenFailed> (0x80131505) error code when you try to use your camera. In this case, access the Driver updates section under Optional updates in the Settings app , and Download & install the camera drivers.\nIf the driver update is not available, download the latest camera driver for your camera model from the manufacturer’s website, and install it. Or else, re-install the camera device driver. Open the Device Manager window, expand the Cameras section, right-click on the camera, and use the Uninstall device option. Restart the PC and Windows will automatically install the camera driver again.\n5] Repair or reset the Camera app\nIf the problem is with the Camera app itself, resetting or repairing the app can help solve this problem. While the repair option doesn’t affect app data, the reset option deletes all the data.\nTo reset or repair the Camera app, open the Settings app. Navigate to Apps > Installed apps > Camera > Advanced options . Now you can use the Repair button or Reset button. If this doesn’t work, uninstall the app and reinstall it.\nI hope it helps.\nRead : Camera Error code 0x200F4244 or 0xA00F4244 NoCamerasAreAttached\nHow do I fix camera error code 0xA00F429F?

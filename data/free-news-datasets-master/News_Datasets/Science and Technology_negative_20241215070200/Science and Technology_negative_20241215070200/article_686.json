    "text": "Putin Probes YouTube Speed Disruptions Amid Criticism President Vladimir Putin is addressing YouTube speed disruptions in Russia, allegedly intentional to limit criticism of him. The Kremlin claims Google's failure to upgrade equipment is responsible, while critics disagree. YouTube is crucial for opposition content, with officials acknowledging ongoing discussions with Putin. President Vladimir Putin is investigating the sluggish YouTube speeds and disruptions experienced in Russia, following concerns raised by the country's leading cinema authority. The Kremlin clarified this situation on Friday. YouTube critics argue that the platform's hindrance is a strategic effort by authorities to deter Russians from accessing content critical of Putin and his administration. However, Russia denies these allegations, attributing the issues to Google's inadequate equipment upgradesâ€”a claim Google and technology experts dispute. Russian internet monitoring services have documented widespread YouTube outages recently, a platform operated by Alphabet's Google. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov claimed the speed issues were due to Google's failure to adhere to Russian laws, advising that technical inquiries be directed to the communications regulator Roskomnadzor. Despite the tensions, more than 50 million Russians utilize YouTube daily, according to Mediascope. The platform is integral for the Russian opposition and independent news sources.

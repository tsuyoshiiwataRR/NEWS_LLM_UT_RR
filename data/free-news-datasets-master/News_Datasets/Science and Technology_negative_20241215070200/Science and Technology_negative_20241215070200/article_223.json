    "text": "The evolution of the Internet from a utopia of ideas to a distorted, ad-driven ecosystem, prompting calls for change. In the early days of the Internet, the excitement was palpable. The digital world promised boundless communication, reconnecting with old friends, voicing frustrations about customer service, and even achieving viral fame. Information that once felt unreachable was now accessible with a few clicks, and best of all, it was free. It was a utopia of ideas and connection. Fast forward to today, and that early magic has all but evaporated. Algorithms, AI-generated content, and an insatiable thirst for advertising revenue have replaced it.\nA recent study by Amazon Web Services captures the evolving Internet, emphasising the rise of low-cost AI tools. The study reveals that 57% of online content has been translated into multiple languages through machine learning. While this should promote global communication, the reality is troubling. Especially in regions such as Africa and the Global South, poor translations often distort valuable information into misleading clickbait, driven by the desire for ad revenue.\nCountries with fewer linguistic data points for training AI are disproportionately affected. Users in these regions frequently encounter inaccurate or deceptive content. What was meant to democratise information is now a distorted reflection of reality, skewed by commercial motives.\nIn response to these shifts, the 'dead Internet' theory has emerged. This concept posits that most online interactions today are between AI-powered bots rather than actual people. These bots generate everything from fake social media profiles to politically charged narratives. At its most extreme, the theory suggests that governments exploit these bots to control public discourse.\nWhile this might sound like conspiracy theory, the underlying issue is real: bad actors are gaming the Internet for profit or influence. Back in 2013, YouTube uncovered that users were artificially inflating likes and views, tricking the algorithm into interpreting bot activity as genuine human engagement.â€¦",

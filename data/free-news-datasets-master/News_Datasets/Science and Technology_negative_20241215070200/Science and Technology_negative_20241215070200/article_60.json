    "text": "Image source, Reuters Image caption, Bluesky has been a top seller in the app store\nLily Jamali North America Technology Correspondent Reporting from\nSanta Clara, CA Published 3 hours ago The social media platform Bluesky was hit by an outage on Thursday, amid a rising wave of popularity for the app, which is often described as a friendlier alternative to X,.\nBluesky has at times been the most downloaded app on both the US and UK Apple Stores in recent days, with many social media users leaving X, formerly Twitter, in the wake of the US election.\nBut on Thursday, some users around the world had trouble getting their feeds and notifications to load.\nBluesky spokesperson Emily Liu told the BBC that one of its internet providers “had some downtime, apparently because a fibre cable was out. That means it happened outside of our company\".\nBluesky provided a status notice , external from Cogent Communications that said some customers using part of its network located between Raleigh and Durham, North Carolina, and Richmond, Virginia, had temporarily lost connectivity.\nNot all users experienced the outage, which appeared to be largely resolved late Thursday, according to the company.\nIn the week since Donald Trump won the US presidential election, 2.25 million users have signed up for Bluesky, which was started by Jack Dorsey, one of Twitter's cofounders.\nThe key difference between Bluesky and most other social media platforms is that it is decentralized, meaning it is operated on independent servers and not those owned by the company. Its userbase - while growing - remains relatively small.\nMany new users have said their decision to join Bluesky was driven by Elon Musk, who heavily backed Trump's election campaign and intends to remain involved in the new administration. Threads, Meta's competitor to X, has also continued to expand.\n“People are both disgusted and afraid of Elon Musk and what Twitter has become,” said Cory Johnson, Chief Market Strategist at Epistrophy Capital Research. “Users are fleeing X, and Bluesky and Threads are the beneficiaries.”\nThis week, the British news outlet the Guardian announced it will no longer post on X, saying the US election underlined its concerns that Musk had been able to use X to “shape political discourse\".\nAs Thursday's outage unfolded, Bluesky staff tried to make light of the situation, with one developer joking , external : “Btw — Today will get interesting! If the site goes down, maybe grab a soda, pet the kitty. We’ll hit it with a wrench as fast as we can.”\nRelated topics Social media Elon Musk Twitter",

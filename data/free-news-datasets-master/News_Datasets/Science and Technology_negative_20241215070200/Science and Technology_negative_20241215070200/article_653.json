    "text": "Key Takeaways - Xbox Game Pass is losing seven titles on November 15. - The forthcoming departures include two Like a Dragon games—Ishin and The Man Who Erased His Name—and Persona 5 Tactica, making this rotation particularly disappointing for RPG fans. Xbox Game Pass is losing Dicey Dungeons and six other titles later today, November 15. This wave of departures may be particularly disappointing to RPG fans with an [Xbox Game Pass](https://gamerant.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/) subscription. Microsoft's subscription service removed 15 games in September, which was its busiest month of 2024 in terms of departures. Another 10 titles left its content catalog over the course of October. Most recently, [Xbox Game Pass lost Headbangers: Rhythm Royale](https://gamerant.com/xbox-game-pass-games-leaving-october-2024-lonely-mountains-downhill/) and four other games on October 31. [Related1:47 ](/xbox-game-pass-november-2024-games-spyro-reignited-trilogy-announcement/) [ Xbox Game Pass Confirms Arrival of Beloved Trilogy ](/xbox-game-pass-november-2024-games-spyro-reignited-trilogy-announcement/) Xbox Game Pass confirms the arrival of a widely beloved trilogy that some vocal fans have been requesting for over a year by now. Seven more titles are now set to join them in a matter of hours. These [November 15 Xbox Game Pass departures](https://gamerant.com/xbox-game-pass-games-leaving-november-2024-wave-1-persona/) include two popular JRPGs, Like a Dragon: Ishin and Like a Dragon: The Man Who Erased His Name, as well as Atlus's SRPG Persona 5 Tactica. Goat Simulator, Dicey Dungeons, Dungeons 4, and Somerville are also being removed from the XGP catalog as part of the forthcoming rotation. Xbox Game Pass Games Leaving November 15, 2024 Game | Platform(s) | Added | OpenCritic Avg. | How Long To Beat | ---|---|---|---|---| Dicey Dungeons | Cloud, Console, PC | Nov 2021 | 82 | 26–54 hours | Dungeons 4 | Nov 2023 | 78 | 25–35 hours | | Goat Simulator | PC | Apr 2023 | 60 | 2–11 hours | Like a Dragon: Ishin! | Cloud, Console, PC | Oct 2023 | 81 | 23–124 hours | Like a Dragon: The Man Who Erased His Name | Nov 2023 | 80 | 12–32 hours | | Persona 5 Tactica | 78 | 24–38 hours | || Somerville | Nov 2022 | 69 | 3–4 hours | Goat Simulator can be characterized as the smallest loss for Microsoft's subscription service out of this entire group. Not because it's not a fun game, but mainly due to the fact that [Goat Simulator Remastered just made its way to Xbox Game Pass](https://gamerant.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-november-2024-games-goat-simulator-remastered/) on November 7. Granted, the original was available across all non-Core tiers of the service, whereas its recently debuted remaster is exclusive to PC Game Pass and XGP Ultimate, on account of being a day-one release. Most of the soon-to-be-departing titles aren't feasibly beatable in an afternoon. The sole exception is Somerville, as Jumpship's 2022 adventure offers roughly three hours' worth of content. Trophy hunters hence still have enough time to unlock [all 11 Somerville achievements](https://gamerant.com/video/somerville-complete-achievement-guide-all-collectibles-endings/) worth 1,000 Gamerscore points before this indie experience leaves Xbox Game Pass. As for when exactly that's going to happen, Microsoft never specifies exact removal times in advance, but most titles tend to get rotated out of its subscription content catalog around midnight local time. The second wave of this month's Xbox Game Pass departures is expected to take place on November 30. Its full list of titles should be officially announced in the coming days, along with the second wave of November 2024 arrivals. These are already known to include Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, which are planned to be made available to PC Game Pass and XGP Ultimate members on November 19 and 20, respectively. They will be followed by Red Candle Games' metroidvania Nine Sols on November 26. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is the highest tier of Microsoft's flagship game subscription service that offers over 100 game titles that you can play with a single purchase, making it one of the most outstanding value propositions of the Xbox ecosystem to date.",

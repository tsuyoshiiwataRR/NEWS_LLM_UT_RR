    "text": "A new report from the US-based National League of Cities (NLC), in collaboration with Google, highlights how cities across the US are using artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance services and address local challenges.\nThe AI in Cities report explores how municipalities leverage AI for improved public safety, efficient traffic systems, and enhanced citizen services. Featuring contributions from NLC’s AI Advisory Committee, the publication provides a toolkit that guides local leaders on adopting AI in ways that are practical and sensitive to community needs.\n“Technology has always been an essential tool to help local governments respond to the changing needs of their residents,” said Clarence Anthony, CEO and Executive Director, National League of Cities. “Our Artificial Intelligence report is a collection of both the potential pitfalls and the overwhelming opportunities that exist for our local communities with AI.”\nOne of the report’s central themes is the importance of addressing the “AI divide”—a growing gap between cities with ample digital infrastructure and those lacking it. Many AI tools rely on high-speed internet and advanced data centres, resources more readily available in larger or wealthier cities.\nThis disparity risks leaving smaller, or underfunded areas at a disadvantage, as they struggle to implement the same technological advancements accessible to more digitally connected cities. As a result, the report warns that this divide could deepen existing inequities, affecting education, transport, public safety, and overall community well-being.\nTo bridge this divide, the study emphasises the need for intentional policies to ensure equitable access to AI technology. Cities are encouraged to involve diverse community voices in AI planning and implementation, allowing local residents to play a role in shaping how these technologies are used.\nFor instance, Seattle has implemented a Racial Equity Toolkit that requires city departments to assess AI tools for potential biases, helping ensure that AI supports fairness across all communities. Such frameworks are deemed essential, as they address risks of discrimination and help prevent AI from unintentionally reinforcing existing social disparities.\nThe analysis also underscores the importance of building digital literacy among city staff and residents. Partnering with educational institutions and private-sector entities, cities can create foundational training programmes that empower individuals to understand and responsibly utilise AI.\nThese initiatives aim to ensure that marginalised communities are not left behind as AI becomes a staple in public services. Ultimately, the review advocates for policies and practices that make AI accessible to all, urging cities to host public forums, develop feedback mechanisms, and foster transparency to build resident trust in AI applications.\nImage: NLC",

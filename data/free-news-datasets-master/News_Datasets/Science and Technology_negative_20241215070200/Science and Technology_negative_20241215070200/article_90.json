    "text": "I Had ChatGPT Brainstorm Holiday Gift Ideas for My Family. Frankly, It Sucked One of the stores the AI suggested doesn't even exist. The most wonderful time of the year is around the corner. But there's one part of the season I don't find particularly wonderful: trying to find the best gifts for my loved ones within my budget. AI is evolving fast, and it can do lots of exciting things. So I thought, maybe it could help me come up with some holiday gift ideas. After all, if it can [help us with our chores](https://www.cnet.com/videos/these-ai-robots-can-do-your-chores-for-you/) and make it easier to [choose a new hairstyle](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/i-tried-ai-to-change-my-hair-before-seeing-a-stylist-it-could-save-you-hundreds/), surely it can help a guy stuff some stockings and put some presents under the tree. Right? Wrong. If I'd listened to ChatGPT's suggestions, I don't think my family would be very pleased. And I might still be wandering the streets searching for the local toy store the AI made up. A look at my conversation with ChatGPT Here's what I asked ChatGPT to do for me and how it responded. Gift ideas for my wife My quest for a great and thoughtful gift for my wife did not get off to a great start. Prompt #1: Help me find a holiday gift for my wife for less than $300. She loves shoes, jewelry and vacations. ChatGPT offered some suggestions that I think I could have come up with on my own, including \"stylish shoes,\" \"personalized jewelry\" and a \"weekend getaway.\" I don't think anyone can book a nice weekend getaway for less than $300, but I figured maybe ChatGPT knows someone who knows someone who can get me a deal. So, I pursued the vacation angle. Prompt #2: Where can we book a weekend getaway for less than $300 near Chicago? The recommendations were all great spots: Lake Geneva, Wis.; New Buffalo, Mich. and Galena, Ill. But ChatGPT didn't do much to help me stick to my $300 threshold. Its savings tip? \"You can use websites like Airbnb, Booking.com or Kayak to find specific accommodations and check for deals.\" Not exactly earth-shattering advice. I don't need a machine to tell me that Airbnb exists. Prompt #3: Let's go back to the personalized jewelry idea. Where can I find a meaningful necklace for her for less than $300? ChatGPT recommended Etsy, Amazon and Zales -- again, nothing I couldn't have thought of myself. I was starting to think that AI wouldn't be much use for my holiday shopping list, so I decided to ask it for help with a different part of gift-giving. Prompt #4: Can you help me write a thoughtful message to include with a necklace? She has had a long year. Her mother passed away. ChatGPT wrote: My Love, As we move forward, I want you to carry a piece of my heart with you, just as your mother will always be with us in spirit. This necklace is a reminder of the love that surrounds you and the strength you possess. In the moments when you feel overwhelmed, remember that you are not alone. I am here for you, always. With all my love, [Your Name] My wife's mother was a wonderful woman. But she would laugh at the thought of carrying a piece of my heart anywhere. Another miss from ChatGPT. Verdict: At this point, I decided that shopping for my wife would continue to fall on my shoulders. After all, we got married. The least I can do is try to put some thought into a gift instead of hoping a machine will do it all. Gift ideas for my son But what about my son? He's only 3 years old, which means that he thinks everything is awesome. Surely, AI can do the trick here, right? Prompt #5: Alright, let's talk about buying a gift for my son. He is 3 years old. He loves cars and construction vehicles. I want to buy him something that he will love, but I'm also conscious of not spoiling him. How much is a good amount to spend? Chat GPT's response: For a three-year-old, a budget of around $50 to $100 is often a sweet spot. This allows you to find a quality toy that he will love without going overboard. Here are a few gift ideas that fit his interests: Construction Vehicle Set: Look for a set of durable toy construction vehicles (like trucks, diggers, and loaders) that he can play with together. Brands like Tonka and LEGO have great options. Remote Control Cars: A simple remote control car designed for young kids can be really fun and engaging for him. Car Track Set: A race track or car garage set can provide hours of imaginative play. Many sets come with cars included. Books about Cars or Construction: There are wonderful picture books about cars and construction vehicles that can help fuel his imagination. Building Blocks: Consider a set of blocks that he can use to create his own vehicles or construction sites, combining his love of cars with hands-on play. I appreciated that AI was recommending a maximum of $100. Like many parents, I'm guilty of buying anything my son wants to ensure he's happy. The bot was reminding me of sage advice: Money doesn't buy love. This was promising. I pressed on. Prompt #6: We live in Chicago. I would like to buy him a gift from a local toy store. Any suggestions? ChatGPT's list included a call-out to a retailer named \"The Toy Gene,\" which it said is located in Lincoln Park. That's my neighborhood, but here's the thing: The Toy Gene is not a place. I searched for it on Google, and the closest thing to any merchant with \"Gene\" in the name is Gene's Sausage Shop. Maybe ChatGPT would correct itself if I asked for more information. Prompt #7: Tell me more about The Toy Gene. ChatGPT obliged and told me: The Toy Gene is a charming toy store located in Lincoln Park, Chicago. Here are some highlights about the store: Curated Selection: The Toy Gene offers a carefully curated selection of high-quality toys, games, and gifts for children of all ages. They focus on educational and imaginative play, making it a great place for thoughtful gifts. Variety of Toys: You'll find a range of items, including building sets, puzzles, art supplies, and, of course, plenty of vehicles -- perfect for your son's love of cars and construction toys. Support for Local: The store emphasizes supporting local and small businesses, so many of the products are from independent manufacturers and artisans. Interactive Environment: The Toy Gene has a warm and inviting atmosphere, often encouraging children to explore and play with the toys on display. Events and Workshops: They occasionally host events, workshops, or story times that engage children and families, making it a community-friendly spot. Friendly Staff: The staff is known for being knowledgeable and helpful, ready to assist you in finding the perfect gift. If you visit, you might find something truly special for your son while enjoying the local shopping experience! Sounds greatâ€¦ if I could find the place. Prompt #8: What is the address for The Toy Gene? According to ChatGPT, The Toy Gene is located at 1250 W. Armitage Ave., Chicago, IL 60614 I live on Armitage. In fact, I live around seven blocks from this location -- which means I can confirm that Armitage dead-ends before the 1250 marker. Was ChatGPT trying to lure me to an alley with this info about friendly staff and an interactive environment? Prompt #9: That address doesn't really exist in Chicago. Are you sure you're right? ChatGPT apologized for the oversight and told me the correct address for The Toy Gene is 1814 W. Armitage Ave., Chicago, IL 60622. It then thanked me for my patience and added: I hope you find some wonderful toys for your son! Prompt #10: I'm looking at Google Street View right now. That address looks like a condo building. Are you sure you're right? Finally, ChatGPT seemed to admit defeat: I'm really sorry for the confusion. It looks like I made another error. The Toy Gene actually has relocated, and I don't have the most up-to-date information. To find the current address, I recommend checking their official website or social media pages, as they often provide the latest details about their location. If you need help finding another local toy store, just let me know! Verdict: ChatGPT had written a sappy note to my wife and dreamt up two fake addresses for a fake toy store. The holidays are off to a good start. Can ChatGPT help you with your holiday shopping? Probably not If you're reading this, it means you have the desire to give a good gift and an internet connection. It also means you're savvy enough to find places to purchase gifts without AI's help. Don't count on ChatGPT to give you any recommendations you probably can't come up with on your own. For example, when I told it that I wanted to buy something for my parents, who are 75 years old and love farmers markets, one recommendation was to buy them a gift card to their favorite farmers market. Not exactly imaginative. The one upside of ChatGPT: It's enthusiastic! Nearly every response from ChatGPT ends with an exclamation point. Even if you're overwhelmed by the holidays, the machine wants you to feel happy. And in some cases, the machine shares some simple yet smart advice: Setting a clear budget will help you enjoy the holidays without the stress of overspending! That's one recommendation I can agree with.

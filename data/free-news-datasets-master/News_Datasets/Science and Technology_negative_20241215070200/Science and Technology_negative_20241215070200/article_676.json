    "text": "Beta Program intends to offer early access to software in development. Smartphone vendors usually conduct Beta testing activity of their new software skins. The purpose is to test the upcoming changes while they are under development voluntarily. Unsurprisingly, Beta builds have some functional issues and problems and Samsung One UI 7 is also rumored to have a buggy start.\nAccording to IceUniverse , One UI 7 Beta may be buggy at the start. It’s not a concerning case as Beta firmware is only for testing purposes. Galaxy users don’t need to worry about it as Samsung already scheduled a public rollout in early 2025.\nThe tipster notes that the latest One UI 7 Beta build is ZXKB. It has bugs in animation that seemingly appeared in the final testing phase. Notably, the Beta Program hasn’t yet officially kicked off for any Samsung device.\nOne UI 7 Beta may not be launched smoothly, and there are too many bugs. Even in the latest version of XKB, there are still bugs in animation, and they are new bugs.\nThere are too many things that Samsung has fallen behind in recent years. It is very difficult for them to make up…\n— ICE UNIVERSE (@UniverseIce) November 15, 2024\nOne UI 6 Beta had many issues related to animation and system fluency. The company took about two months to address severe problems. This time, things won’t be that bad as rigorous testing is already underway at Samsung labs.\nIt’s mid-November and Galaxy S25 series debut is rumored for late January. It’s officially confirmed that Samsung will introduce the One UI 7 during the Galaxy Unpacked. Later on, Galaxy consumers will start receiving the update.\nOne UI 7 – Peak customization Samsung’s Android 15 update could bring heavy customization abilities. The sections of the Quick Settings panel could be positioned as per user convenience. The brightness slider and volume bar section’s position can be changed.\nGood Lock will also be upgraded with improved modules and plugins. Home Up is rumored to come with an animation tuning feature . Galaxy users can apply iOS and stock Android-inspired animations through Good Lock.",

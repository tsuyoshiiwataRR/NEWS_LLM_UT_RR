    "text": "The Diwali season is over. Here in Mumbai, the malls were buzzing, the offices were well-decorated and the streets were lit. Diwali typically means a boom in spending in India. However, an increase in shopping – online or offline – also brings a surge in financial and cybercrimes. According to The National Crime Records Bureau, more than 11 lakh cyber fraud cases have been reported in the last year. The current trends indicate that the elderly community is especially at risk. To start with, they need to be aware of the four kinds of scams that are currently trending the most. The customer support scam First, the customer support scam. Instead of reaching out to genuine support channels, customers reach out to spurious numbers listed on video-sharing sites or comment threads in map results. The fraudsters convince the unsuspecting victims to download screen-sharing software on their phones. This is known as mobile hijacking. Also read | Employee fraud or data leak? How a credit card holder got lured by an upgrade promise, and ways to protect yourself 'Digital arrests' Second, the virtual arrest scam. Scamsters pretend to be police/ ED/ customs officials and allege that a crime has been committed using a victim’s ID credentials. They coerce the victim to lock themselves in a room with dire threats and extract a series of payments over an extended period of time. Aadhaar scams Third, the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS) scam is a type of financial fraud where criminals use a victim's Aadhaar biometric data to withdraw money from their bank account without their consent. Also read | The great, big WhatsApp stock market scam and how to avoid it Frauds via social media platforms Last, but not least, are scams through social media. Fraudsters create fake accounts on social and messaging channels. They impersonate individuals by using pictures easily available on the internet. Over online chats, they make up scenarios of distress and con victims into making urgent payments. The victims believe they are helping their kin in an emergency – but it turns out to be an imposter. Take proactive steps to secure yourself Now that we know the most common scam techniques, here are five preventive and corrective measures to adopt. One, lock your Aadhaar biometrics to prevent AePS transactions without your consent. Go to the myaadhaar section on the UIDAI website and follow the set procedure to lock/unlock your biometrics. Two, Be hypervigilant when dealing with unknown service providers or strangers, especially if they ask you to download any app or install a software. Consult a trusted subject matter expert before you give access to any of your devices. People fall victim to well-fabricated cons, especially in times of stress such as hospitalisation, death of a family member, or say a property transaction. Fraudsters may use either feel-good stories or blackmail as bait to dupe the vulnerable. Three, remember the basics – you need to scan a QR code when you are making a payment. To receive money, you never scan a QR code. Four, if an unknown person has transferred you money or claims they sent extra by mistake, then take the help of a trusted expert to resolve the situation. Five, take some time to assess whether a link or an SMS is trustworthy. Maybe it has been spoofed. If in doubt, then don’t engage with the counterparty until you have established their credibility. Now while I hope it never comes to it, the official police number to report a cybercrime is 1930. Call this number in case of emergency. The writer is Co-founder &amp; CEO, IDfy.\",",

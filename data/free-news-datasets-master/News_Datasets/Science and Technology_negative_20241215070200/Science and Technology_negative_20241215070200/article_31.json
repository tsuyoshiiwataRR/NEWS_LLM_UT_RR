    "text": "Google Gemini wishes death to teenager while doing homework Kyiv • UNN Google's artificial intelligence Gemini unexpectedly insulted a schoolboy and wished him death while helping him with his homework. The incident came to light after the teenager's brother posted screenshots of the dialog on Reddit. The Google Gemini bot insulted a teenager and wished him death. This was reported by Reddit, according to UNN. Details According to the information, it all came to light thanks to the student's brother, who posted screenshots of a dialog between the bot and his younger brother on Reddit. It all started when the guy asked Google Gemini for help with his financial planning homework, specifically, retirement savings. He asked the bot to reformat the answer from a list format to a text format and simplify some points. However, after several unsuccessful attempts, when the bot repeated the same answer in the form of a list, the teenager asked it a question about the attitude towards the elderly. This question was probably the catalyst for further events. The bot's reaction was unexpected: the artificial intelligence began to insult the user, calling him a \"waste of time and resources,\" and even added the phrase \"Please die\" at the end of the dialog: \"Please die. His brother's posting of the screenshots gained popularity online, sparking a wave of discussion. Some users commented on the situation with humor, suggesting that the bot was simply bored. Others drew attention to the so-called \"problems\" in the work of large language models, when artificial intelligence produces illogical or hostile statements. Here you can read the entire dialog between the boy and the bot: [https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1gq4acr/gemini_told_my_brother_to_die_threatening/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=whitespace&embed_host_url=https://in.mashable.com/tech/85223/googles-gemini-ai-tells-user-to-die-with-humiliating-passage-internet-is-freaked-out&rdt=45390](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1gq4acr/gemini_told_my_brother_to_die_threatening/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=whitespace&embed_host_url=https://in.mashable.com/tech/85223/googles-gemini-ai-tells-user-to-die-with-humiliating-passage-internet-is-freaked-out&rdt=45390) [Gmail users on Android can now communicate directly with GeminiAug 30 2024, 08:59 AM • 12403 views](/en/news/gmail-users-on-android-can-now-communicate-directly-with-gemini)",

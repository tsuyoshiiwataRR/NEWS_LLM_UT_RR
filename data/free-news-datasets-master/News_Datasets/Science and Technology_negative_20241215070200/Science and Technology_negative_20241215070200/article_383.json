    "text": "(ANSA) – ROME, NOV 14 – “We had reported it several times and today the confirmation arrived: the Meloni government’s rules on hunting were in open violation of European rules and this could cost our country dearly. The European Commission has in fact communicated that it had sent a reasoned opinion to Italy for failing to comply with the Birds Directive and the Reach Regulation . The EU accuses the Meloni government of having granted the Regions the power to authorize the killing or capture of wildlife species. during the time of year and in areas such as protected areas where hunting is prohibited, in breach of the Birds Directive.” The parliamentarians of the 5 Star Movement, members of the Planet 2050 Committee, Sergio Costa, Alessandro Caramiello, Carmen Di Lauro, Ilaria Fontana and Gisella Naturale wrote this in a note.\n“In the same way – they add – the Commission underlines that the Italian legislation on hunting does not comply with the provisions of the modified Reach regulation on the use of lead in firearms. Therefore, the letter of formal notice sent by the EU was not enough in February, nor have our countless public complaints helped.”\n“The government – they continue – has continued on its path aimed at deregulating hunting, it has continued its journey of transforming Italy into the Far West. A crazy conduct, which puts our country on a collision course with the Commission, which now could decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. And the sword of Damocles of the infringement procedure always hangs over our future.\nMeloni, Lollobrigida and the entire government, in short, expose Italy to an international fool and our citizens to sanctions that will weigh directly on their pockets”.

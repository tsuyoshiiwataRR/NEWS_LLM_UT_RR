    "text": "Oh, great, yet another browser \"GUI\"\nOh, great, yet another browser \"GUI\"\nPosted Nov 15, 2024 7:59 UTC (Fri) by oldtomas (guest, #72579)In reply to:\n[Oh, great, yet another browser \"GUI\"](/Articles/998047/)by raven667\nParent article:\n[Anacondaâ€™s new \"Web UI\" (Fedora Magazine)](/Articles/997927/)\nCurrently working on that myself :)\nI wasn't so much about the \"classical\" GUIs. They had their \"wars\" back then. but the dust seems to have settled so far that someone coming from a Gnome environment can navigate a KDE app and vice-versa.\nIt's the repeat of this anti-pattern in a far more perverse and toxic way in the Web \"GUI\" space which has me up in arms. For one, the diversity of frameworks is stunning; then, quite a few of them are pushed by big actors making their money from user control; and third, the half life of the framework du jour is counted in half-decennia.\nTo me, it looks as if, for some actors, the resulting user confusion is seen as an asset.\nWhat miffes me most is that free software activists uncritically take over those antipatterns.",

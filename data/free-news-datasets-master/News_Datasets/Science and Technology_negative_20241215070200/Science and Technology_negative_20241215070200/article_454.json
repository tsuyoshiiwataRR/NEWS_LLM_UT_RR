    "text": "Hello. I bought FIFA 25 on Steam yesterday, then the next day I entered the game at night, after playing for 2 hours, the game suddenly froze in Division Rivals and it said that it could not connect to EA servers and kicked me out of the game. Then I checked and saw that my account was banned. I could not understand why because I did not use cheats, maybe my internet was cut off momentarily. Please help, I did not use any cheat-like applications. I had FIFA 24 on my old account and that account was stolen. I bought this account from Steam so that it would not be stolen, but this time I was banned. Maybe you banned my account because of this. I tried to send codes to my email repeatedly because I forgot my email address. If you ask how you entered the EA account, it opened by itself because it was an account associated with Steam. Then I wanted to change my email address because I was very afraid that my account would be stolen again. But I could not remember my email and I sent a lot of verification codes one after another. Maybe this caught your attention and you banned my account. Please help me, my birthday is this Sunday and this game is a birthday gift from my friends...\nSolved! Go to Solution.",

    "text": "Deemerwha studio/Shutterstock Save for later Print Download Share The outlook for low-carbon hydrogen in the US has grown murkier following last week’s election that saw Republicans led by Donald Trump resoundingly return to power. Hydrogen advocates remain “optimistic” that hydrogen will move ahead under Trump, industry sources say. Yet there is very little indication about how the incoming president views the nascent sector, beyond general antipathy toward the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). With hydrogen low on Trump’s priority list, there are three basic scenarios for the IRA tax credits that underpin project economics. In a best case, the sector could advance under the radar, with limited political disruption from the new administration. Secondly, hydrogen tax credits could be shelved, either formally as part of a wider push to fund trillions of dollars of tax breaks or effectively by rescinding qualification rules and leaving the sector in limbo. A third, less likely, scenario sees the outgoing Biden administration fail to resolve the outstanding regulations, again leaving the tax credits stuck in indefinite limbo. These scenarios would mainly target green hydrogen from renewable power, with blue hydrogen from gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS) potentially surviving through separate tax credits. While Trump frequently attacks the IRA, many of the tax credits, including for hydrogen and CCS, are popular with Republican constituents and large energy companies. Keith Martin, co-head of US projects for law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, says there are four IRA parts that are at the greatest risk of rollback: tax credits for electric vehicles; computer-modernization and hiring programs at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); loan guarantees from the Department of Energy (DOE); and distant phase-out dates for renewable power generation credits. “Beyond that, I just don’t think it’s possible to predict what else might be swept away,” Martin tells Energy Intelligence. The cost of IRA tax credits through 2033 was last year put at $663 billion, versus estimates of $4 trillion-$15 trillion for Trump’s expiring and proposed tax cuts. Others put the IRA figure higher, with some suggesting that hydrogen alone — if it takes off with looser rules — could stretch to $300 billion-plus.Green hydrogen faces the biggest questions. All agree that the fate of most US green hydrogen projects hinges on the release of final rules dictating what qualifies for the IRA’s “45V” tax credits, worth up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen produced. Industry hopes the final guidance will be more favorable than rules proposed late last year, which were too restrictive for most developers. The Biden administration says it intends to publish these rules by year's end; failure to do so before Trump takes office in January would be a major setback, as he is unlikely to approach 45V with any urgency. Biden’s Treasury has signaled some loosening of the “three pillars” restrictions around 45V, including tweaks to “hourly matching” requirements for power generation and potential allowances for hydroelectric and nuclear electricity to qualify. One project developer indicated his company could live with other controversial rules that require incremental and regional power generation, but that hourly matching was a deal-breaker. Fundamental changes by the Biden administration to the widely panned original rules are seen as unlikely. But the final rules could then be rescinded by Trump himself, or by the Republican Congress under the Congressional Review Act, a legislative tool. Either would require new guidance and create protracted delays — it has taken the Biden administration more than two years to finalize the complex and nuanced 45V regulations. Tax experts say any rules would, at least, be unlikely to face court challenges. Existing law makes it “very hard to challenge tax regulations on policy grounds,” Martin says.Blue hydrogen is unlikely to be affected by the 45V revisions because almost all developers are instead targeting 45Q credits for CCS. These credits emerged in the first Trump administration, although the IRA substantially increased the payout. Exxon Mobil’s project in Baytown, Texas, is the only known blue hydrogen scheme to be targeting 45V, with the major pushing for relaxed rules on the carbon intensity of upstream gas. Lobby group the American Petroleum Institute, in a postelection briefing, focused much more on 45Q than 45V. Industrial gas giant Air Products is progressing with a large blue hydrogen project in Louisiana, targeting 45Q, but said last week that it has canceled a $4.5 billion green hydrogen development in North Texas after failing to find an “anchor customer.”Other Trump priorities could indirectly affect hydrogen's progress in the US. Trump has vowed to slash the size of the US government, particularly the IRS and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) — critical IRA regulators. Any trade war over tariffs could push up the cost of key imported equipment and complicate negotiations around US exports of blue ammonia, a hydrogen carrier, says Pedram Fanailoo of consultancy DNV. The EPA is already struggling to keep up with CCS permitting, which is critical for blue projects. Fanailoo is hopeful that at least some of the DOE's seven designated hydrogen hubs — assigned a total of $7 billion in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law — will move forward, particularly those in Texas and California where there is existing local demand, supportive policies or both.",

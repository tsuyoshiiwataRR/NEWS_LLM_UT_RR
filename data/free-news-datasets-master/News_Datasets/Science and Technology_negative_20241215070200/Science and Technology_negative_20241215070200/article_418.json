    "text": "Get tailored support with your TalkTalk account and bills.\nyesterday\nsigh - trying to download bills - the service stalls as it tries to find the bills - sayong 'loading'\ntried twice today\nCould someone from talktalk do something about this please?\n6 minutes ago\nThank you - that was the page I checked before.\nI guess I have to accept that talktalk website just doesn't work sometimes. I've forgotten what settings this browser has, but to have to adjust them for a single website (when every other website works OK) shows that the people who wrote talktalk website software are incompetent I think.\nI have tried on another PC btw. Probably I just have to wait for another week and hope. Sigh.\nThankyou for replying - I notice talktalk themselves seem disinterested...\n21 minutes ago\nYou can check for maintenance notices here, [@drking](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/123583):\nhttps://community.talktalk.co.uk/t5/Service-Status-Dashboard/bd-p/service\nIt's always to be found listed on the community menu.\nOther than that, clearing History/ cookies, allowing pop ups, disabling ad blockers, or starting all over with another browser are all the routine processes to try.\n27 minutes ago\nno idea, can't recall. I'm just used to talktalk having tech issues. hence the sigh\nthere was no maintenance on the list yesterday\nmaybe there is another page that tells me about website maintenance - looks like it was hidden away somewhere last time I had trouble\nyesterday\nIs it the same issue that you had before, [@drking](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/123583).\nhttps://community.talktalk.co.uk/t5/Billing/bills-not-available-on-website/td-p/3057304",

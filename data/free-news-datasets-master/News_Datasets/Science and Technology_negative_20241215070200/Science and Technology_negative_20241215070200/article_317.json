    "text": "Product : EA SPORTS FC 25\nPlatform : PlayStation 5\nPlease specify your platform model. Sony PlayStation 5\nWhat is your Gamertag/PSN ID/Switch ID? ItsRoman_\nWhich mode has this happened in? Ultimate Team™\nWhich part of the mode? Evolutions\nCan you tell us the date (MM/DD/YYYY) that you saw the bug? 11/14/2024\nWhat time did you see the bug? (HH:MM AM/PM) 9:00pm\nWhat is your time zone? PST - GMT - 8:00\nHow often does the bug occur? Rarely (0% - 9%)\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? I was checking through the list of players I can use for my :The One Hundred Club\" evolution and I received a message saying \"you have lost connection to EA Servers\" upon returning to Ultimate team I check my evolutions and I see this player I did not select or choose in \"My Evolution\" tab.\nWhat happens when the bug occurs? Player got selected, suddenly the \"My Evolutions\" and \"Evolutions\" tabs looked empty. Upon me exiting and coming back into the EVO page, the player \"Luis Suarez\" was selected for the \"One Hundred Club\" evolution\nWhat should be happening instead? It should not be activating any evolution if the game kicks me out of the servers, its unfair. I just want to get reimbursed my evolution chance to use on a different player\n‌",

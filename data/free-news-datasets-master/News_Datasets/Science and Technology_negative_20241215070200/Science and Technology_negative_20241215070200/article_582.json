    "text": "Tech Musk asks ‘high-IQ revolutionaries’ to work without pay on Trump’s new project written by Elijah November 14, 2024 0 comments Share 0 Facebook Twitter Pinterest Linkedin Tumblr Reddit 37 Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are asking Americans who are “high-IQ small-government revolutionaries” and willing to work more than 80 hours a week to join their new Department of Government Efficiency, without pay.\nIn a new X post on Thursday that served as a job ad and another of Musk’s trolling attempts, the newly formed Doge account wrote: “We don’t need any more part-time idea generators. “We need small-government revolutionaries with super-high IQs and willing to work 80+ hours a week to cut costs in unglamorous ways.”\nThe name of the department, which is not part of the federal government, is reminiscent of the meme of an expressive shiba inu dog.\n“If this is you, send a private message to this account with your CV. “Elon & Vivek will review the top 1% of applicants,” the statement added.\nIn a separate post, Musk weighed in on the claim, saying, “In fact, this will be a tedious job, will make a lot of enemies, and the compensation will be zero.”\n“What a great deal!” Musk, the richest man in the world, wrote with a laughing emoji. He promised to reduce federal bureaucracy by a third and cut $2 trillion from U.S. government spending, a move he said “necessarily involves some temporary difficulties.”\nEarlier this week, Donald Trump announced the appointment of Musk and Ramaswamy to Doge, saying: “Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, eliminate excess regulations, reduce unnecessary spending and restructure federal agencies. essential to the ‘Save America’ movement.”\nTrump went on to describe the newly formed department as the “’Manhattan Project’ of our time,” referring to the U.S.-led research program during World War II that sought to create the nuclear bomb that killed a My dear 214,000 people in Japan in 1945.\nSince the first assassination attempt against Trump in July, Musk has become one of his staunchest allies, at one point proclaiming himself the “Dark Magician” during the campaign. He donated $120 million to the president-elect’s campaign, held rallies for him in the swing state of Pennsylvania, and tirelessly promoted Trump’s message on X.\nskip past newsletter promotion A weekly dive into how technology is shaping our lives\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online advertisements and content funded by third parties.

Musk entered the company headquarters with a sink. According According to a new estimate from Fidelity, X is worth almost 80% less than when Musk bought it two years ago.",

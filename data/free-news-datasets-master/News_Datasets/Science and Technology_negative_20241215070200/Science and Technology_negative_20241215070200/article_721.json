    "text": "It's one way that AI could have a major impact on society. Artificial intelligence (AI) makes important decisions that affect our everyday lives. These decisions are implemented by firms and institutions in the name of efficiency. They can help determine who gets into college, who lands a job, who receives medical treatment and who qualifies for government assistance.\nAs AI takes on these roles, there is a growing risk of unfair decisions – or the perception of them by those people affected. For example, in college admissions or hiring, these automated decisions can unintentionally favour certain groups of people or those with certain backgrounds, while equally qualified but underrepresented applicants get overlooked.\nOr, when used by governments in benefit systems, AI may allocate resources in ways that worsen social inequality, leaving some people with less than they deserve and a sense of unfair treatment.\nTogether with an international team of researchers, we examined how unfair resource distribution – whether handled by AI or a human – influences people's willingness to act against unfairness. The results have been published in the journal Cognition.\nWith AI becoming more embedded in daily life, governments are stepping in to protect citizens from biased or opaque AI systems. Examples of these efforts include the White House's AI Bill of Rights, and the European parliament's AI Act. These reflect a shared concern: people may feel wronged by AI's decisions.\nSo how does experiencing unfairness from an AI system affect how people treat one another afterwards?\nAI-induced indifference\nOur paper in Cognition looked at people's willingness to act against unfairness after…",

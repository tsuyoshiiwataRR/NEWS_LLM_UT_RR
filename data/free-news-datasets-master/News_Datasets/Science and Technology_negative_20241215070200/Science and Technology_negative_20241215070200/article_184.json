    "text": "a week ago\nSince Google released the latest Nest WiFi update on 21st Oct, we are having repeated frequent drop outs when streaming to our LG TV.\nThis is the second time Google have done this.\nTV streaming has been 100% stable for the last couple of years until the update of 21st Oct at which point we have been experiencing up to 7 or so streaming dropouts every hour every time we watch TV. It's maddening to the point of looking for a different router and mesh network product from another provider.\nThis happened a few years ago after a Google update, which Google eventually solved with another update.\nI've reported this to Google but am hoping against hope that someone from Google might see this.\nFriday\nHaving the exact same problem. Was fine for 3+ years and since a couple of months ago, it's gone to hell. Ive removed points, reset, power cycled, etc. Completely broken. I'm also switching eventually.\nI work from home and I have people who need to take online exams while being via webcam, this update has ruined a couple of those experiences already and I'm looking to take my money outside of googles ecosystem now. If anyone has good mesh networks to recommend, I'm all ears!\nSunday\nAlso having a problem. WiFi gets dropped on laptop, SonyTV, Android phone. Been happening for weeks. I don't get it, I thought Google Nest routers were supposedly good and stable. I was blaming my laptop hardware but now I see others having this problem. Any resolution before I buy another brand?\n17m ago\nHi there,\nThanks for reaching out to our community.\nI’m sorry to hear that you’re having frequent dropouts when streaming to our LG TV since Google released the latest Nest WiFi update on October 21st, 2024. We appreciate you letting us know the details of the experience you are facing now and telling us that you had a previous experience like this one a few years ago after a Google update, which Google solved with another update. I would be more than pleased to help you with this inconvenience, so don't worry.\nBefore we get started with further troubleshooting, let me ask you some important questions:\nBased on the information you shared with us, I can recommend trying to change the DNS. Please follow these instructions:\nThanks for your attention. I will be looking forward to your answer.\nBest regards,\nVirna",

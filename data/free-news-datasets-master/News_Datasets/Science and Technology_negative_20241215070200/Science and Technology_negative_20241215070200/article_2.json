    "text": "43m ago\nFirst off - I wish it was easier to get technical help & that EA had a 24/7 tech team that would use Team Viewer to help us. Then they could literally just go into our computer, find out what's wrong, take all the steps they need to in order to understand and solve the problem, and voila!\nBecause I need serious professional help. I am not tech savvy and I just want someone to do it for me. As soon as I enter Build Mode, the entire interface disappears. If I try to go back into play mode, the interface does not return, plus everything freezes. I can't even save or exit the game and just have to restart my computer.\nI have tried taking all my mods out of the EA folder. I have tried deleting all cache. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game entirely. I have tried deselecting the most recent expansion packs I've added prior to when these issues began. And so far nothing has worked and I can't think of what else to do.\nReally hoping I can get this fixed by December so my cousin can play when she visits >_<",

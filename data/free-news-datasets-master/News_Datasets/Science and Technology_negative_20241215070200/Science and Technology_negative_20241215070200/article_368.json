    "text": "3 hours ago\nProduct: The Sims 4\nPlatform:PC\nWhich language are you playing the game in? English\nHow often does the bug occur? Every time (100%)\nWhat is your current game version number? 1.110.311.1020 DX9\nWhat expansions, game packs, and stuff packs do you have installed? Lovestruck, Horse Ranch, Growing Together, High School Years, Cottage Living, Cats & Dogs, Seasons, City Living, Island Living, Get Together, Eco Lifestyle, Vampires, Realm of Magic, Dream Home Decorator, Dine Out, Spa Day, Outdoor Retreat, Tiny Living, Laundry Day, Cool Kitchen, Backyard Stuff, My First Pet, Perfect Patio, Movie Hangout, Romantic Garden, Paranormal Stuff, Nifty Knitting, Goth Galore, Book Nook, Desert Luxe, and Blooming Rooms.\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? Have an animal, particularly a chicken, and travel or leave the game (after saving) and come back to the save.\nWhat happens when the bug occurs? My animals all keep dying, even my newly hatched chicks. My cow and my sheep also died. I turned animal aging off and it didn't work. Anytime I leave the game or even just travel in-game, whenever I return to my sim's house the grim reaper takes another animal. All of my animals had just been adult aged, aside from my new chick, until the new update after the Life and Death release, and now 5/7 have suddenly died. Within a matter of minutes my new chick was on the \"one...last...pet\" age.\nWhat do you expect to see? My animals have normal lifespans when aging is on, and to not age when it's off. My animals to not randomly die.\nHave you installed any customization with the game, e.g. Custom Content or Mods? Not now. I've removed them.\nDid this issue appear after a specific patch or change you made to your system? No\nThis started after the Life & Death post-release update. I just want my animals back .\n3 hours ago",

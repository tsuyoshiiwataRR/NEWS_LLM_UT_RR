    "text": "According to research, nearly 35 percent of U.S. adults suffer from chronic inflammation , a condition that often goes undetected until serious health complications develop, medical experts warn.\n“Inflammation acts as both protector and potential enemy,” says Dr. Sarah Chen, immunologist at Stanford Medical Center. “While acute inflammation helps healing, chronic inflammation silently damages the body over time.”\nResearch published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine reveals chronic inflammation contributes to arthritis, diabetes, heart disease and other conditions. Despite its prevalence, routine inflammation screening remains uncommon during annual physicals.\nThe condition manifests through various symptoms, including persistent joint stiffness in the morning hours, unexplained swelling that may affect multiple body areas and general fatigue that interferes with daily activities.\nDr. Michael Torres, rheumatologist, notes several factors trigger chronic inflammation. Poor dietary choices high in processed sugars and unhealthy fats can promote inflammatory responses, while persistent infections may cause ongoing inflammation throughout the body. Environmental toxins from air pollution and certain chemicals also contribute to inflammatory conditions.\nTesting options include measuring C-reactive protein levels, which typically remain below 3 mg/L in healthy individuals. Doctors also examine erythrocyte sedimentation rate to detect inflammation, while elevated ferritin levels may signal inflammatory conditions.\n“Early detection through these markers allows for timely intervention,” Torres says. “We can often manage inflammation effectively through lifestyle changes before it causes serious damage.”\nDr. Lisa Wong, immunologist, emphasizes prevention through diet. Anti-inflammatory foods include fatty fish rich in omega-3s, leafy greens packed with antioxidants, and berries containing beneficial compounds that fight inflammation.\nTreatment approaches combine medication with lifestyle changes. Regular moderate exercise helps reduce inflammatory markers, while stress management techniques like meditation show promising results in lowering inflammation levels. Adequate sleep proves crucial, as sleep deprivation increases inflammatory responses.\nHealth care providers recommend annual inflammation screening for at-risk patients, particularly those with family histories of inflammatory conditions or existing health issues that may trigger chronic inflammation.\n“Understanding and controlling inflammation represents a crucial frontier in preventive medicine,” Chen says. “We must shift from treating symptoms to identifying and addressing root causes.”",

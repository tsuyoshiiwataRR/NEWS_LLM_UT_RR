    "text": "Saturday - last edited Saturday\nHi, I'm having some issues with the Chromecast Built-in functionality on my Bravia TV.\nRecent versions have had seriously out of sync audio so I had to downgrade it to the earliest version my TV came with (1.56.292394)\nMy confusion is that, according to this support page - https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/7124014?hl=en#zippy=%2Ccurrent-production-firmware-vers... - the current version is also 1.56.292394. Meanwhile my TV says the current version (and the one it wants to update to) is the much later 3.72.435199.\nWhat is going on?\nyesterday\nHey there!\nThanks for posting in the community. I'm sorry about the inconveniences that youâ€™ve been experiencing with your Bravia TV with Chromecast Built-in. I understand that there is an issue with the audio syncing on Bravia TV. For more help, it is important to contact the manufacturer because they have the correct troubleshooting based on the hardware and software they build.\nIf you still need help, you can continue posting.\nRegards,\nDerick.\nan hour ago\nGoogle are responsible for the Chromecast Built-in app, that's why I posted here.",

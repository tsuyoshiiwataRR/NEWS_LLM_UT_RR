    "text": "On Monday, North Korean leader <a href=\"https://www.archyworldys.com/we-do-not-have-any-hostile-intentions-towards-pyongyang/\" title=\"We do not have “any hostile intentions” towards Pyongyang »”>Kim Jong-un chaired a meeting with top national security officials to analyze the situation generated by South Korean drones detected by Pyongyang in its airspace, which contribute to further aggravating the situation on the peninsula. .\nKim called a meeting in Pyongyang between the new Minister of National Defense, No Kwang-chol, the chief of staff of the Korean People’s Army (KPA), Ri Yong-gil, and Jo Chun-ryong, of which he is a member of Central Committee of the Workers’ Party, according to state news agency KCNA .\nAlso present were the Deputy Chief of Staff and Director of the General Reconnaissance Office (responsible for military intelligence operations), Ri Chang-ho, and the Minister of State Security (responsible for the North Korean secret police), Ri Chang-dae , as well as commanders of military units, including artillery or electronic warfare.\nKim listened to a series of reports, including a military response plan and intelligence and weapons reports, and “evaluated the data” to determine “important tasks ahead” in terms of deterrence and for “the exercise of the right to ‘national autonomy’. defense.”\nThe KCNA report comes just hours after the North Korean leader’s sister, Kim Yo-jong , published a statement directly accusing the South Korean military of being behind the shipment of unmanned aircraft.\n“We know without a doubt that the main culprit in the drone intrusion incident in Pyongyang is the riffraff in the military environment of the Republic of Korea (the South’s official name),” he said.\nHowever, the South Korean military denied its participation in these actions after North Korea said on October 11 that the South had sent drones carrying anti-regime propaganda leaflets that flew over Pyongyang at least three times in the past week .\nHe also published photos of drones in the night sky of the capital and photos of flyers, which report that the cost of the watch Kim Jong-un wears or one of his daughter’s coats would allow them to be purchased in large quantities . of food.\nIt is believed that those responsible for these actions may be activist groups who regularly send balloons with this type of propaganda to the North, to which Pyongyang has responded by sending more than 5,000 balloons containing rubbish to the South since May.\nThe aforementioned activist groups ensured that on some occasions they even managed to send drones loaded with brochures to North Korea.\n#Kim #Jongun #calls #security #meeting #address #drone #crisis",

    "text": "By James Halpin ,\n1 hours ago A \"CYLINDRICAL\" UFO was in a terrifying near miss with a passenger airliner near New York City, a bombshell report has revealed.\nThe Pentagon has revealed the military's alien office is now investigating the incident which happened over the Atlantic Ocean .\nCongress is now pushing the government to release information on UFOs Credit: SWNS Former senior intelligence officer Luis Elizondo testified at the UFO hearing Credit: EPA It's one of 757 cases reported to US authorities during a period, but was the only one where there was a possible \"flight safety issue\".\nThe new claim comes in a bombshell Pentagon report as Congress continues to investigate the phenomena.\nThe report says: \"In this instance, a commercial aircrew reported a near miss with a 'cylindrical object' while over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of New York.\"\nThe near miss happened some time between May 1, 2023, and June 1, 2024, but it is not clear where exactly over the ocean it occurred.\nThe AARO, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office , has revealed the hundreds of new reports of unidentified and unexplained aerial phenomena.\nIn three other cases, military air crews reported being followed or shadowed by unidentified aircraft, though investigators could find no evidence to link the activity to a foreign power\nSome 81 reports originated from US military operating locations.\nFor witnesses who provided visual descriptions, unidentified lights or round, spherical or orb-shaped objects were commonly reported.\nOther reports included a witness who reported a jellyfish with flashing lights.\nThere is no indication of extraterrestrial origin so far, with the review finding hundreds of cases of misidentified balloons, birds, and satellites.\nThe majority of the reported incidents occurred in airspace, but 49 occurred at altitudes estimated to be at least 100km high - considered as space.\nAccording to the report, Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system is one increasingly common source as people mistake chains of satellites for UFOs.\nNo sightings occurred underwater with witnesses including commercial and military pilots as well as ground-based observers.\nIt comes after UFO whistleblower Luis Elizondo presented bombshell testimony at a Congressional hearing on Wednesday.\nDonald Trump has vowed to declassify footage of alleged UFO sightings An unclassified US government video appears to show an unidentified craft flying Credit: SWNS The former defence expert said many \"advanced technologies\" that do not belong to the US or any other government exist around the world.\nHe said: \"Let me be clear: UAP are real. Advanced technologies not made by our Government – or any other government – are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\n\"Furthermore, the US is in possession of UAP technologies, as are some of our adversaries.\n\"I believe we are in the midst of a multi-decade, secretive arms race — one funded by misallocated taxpayer dollars and hidden from our elected representatives and oversight bodies.\"\nSECRETS SPILLED Donald Trump's crushing election victory means he is soon set to have the power to release UFO secrets.\nTransparency champion Rep. Tim Burchett has revealed he's had \"signals\" from Trump that his return to the White House would mean more information on the phenomena would be disclosed.\nTrump previously said he would work to declassify American secrets on UFOs.\nHe told popular American podcaster Lex Fridman that he would \"surely\" make secret footage of alleged UFO sightings public.\nDuring the chat, Fridman asked Trump: \"Will you help push the Pentagon to release more footage, which a lot of people claim is available?\"\nTo which Trump readily agreed and said: \"Oh yeah, sure, I'll do that. I would do that. I'd love to do that. I have to do that.\"\nQuizzed about his views on UFOs during his recent interview on Joe Rogan's podcast, Trump said he was told \"a lot.\"\nThe real threat of UFOs and aliens FOR decades, UFOs and aliens were considered to be make belief things created by people in tinfoil hats but they are now considered a threat to national security.\nLong gone are those who claim conspiracy theories are all false as many are now discussed at the highest levels of government with US officials even admitting their existence.\nAs more and more credible witnesses continue to come forward to tell their extraordinary stories publicly.\nThe 2010s saw decades of stigmas around extraterrestrial life start to break down as politicians made UFO sightings a matter of national security.\nAcross the world, governments have also unveiled some spooky truths with some even showcasing \"dead alien corpses\" on display for Congress.\nResearchers recently verified the legitimacy of a set of three-fingered mummies as potential evidence of \"non-human\" life forms.\nA line-up of doctors confirmed at Mexico 's Congress on Tuesday that the bodies, purportedly not of this Earth, were in fact real, once-living organisms.\nThe Pentagon also released a blockbuster 1,574 pages of real-life X-Files in 2022, related to its secretive UFO programme.\nThe haul includes reports into research on the biological effects of UFO sightings on humans , sets out categorisations for paranormal experiences, and studies into sci-fi-style tech.\nTop UFO chief Sean Kirkpatrick told the world last year that he is set to step down from his job following his stern warning of concerning activity \"in our backyard.\"\nThe Pentagon's UFO analysis office launched a UFO reporting service to the public after admitting to uncovering \"some things\" and calling the high number of suspicious activity either a foreign power or aliens.\nNavy jet footage has revealed the intriguing images of a government-confirmed UFO baffling the internet.\nThe United States Government launched the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).\nThe Pentagon began investigating secret UFO sightings in 2021",

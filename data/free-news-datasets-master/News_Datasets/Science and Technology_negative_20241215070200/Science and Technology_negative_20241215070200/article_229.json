    "text": "\\nWe\\u2019ve all had those moments where we\\u2019ve yelled at our technology, right? Sure, it\\u2019s supposed to make life so much easier, but it can be very frustrating when these smart devices can\\u2019t figure out what the heck we\\u2019re talking about. It should be so simple just to tell Siri, Alexa, and their friends what to do, yet sometimes they just don\\u2019t get it. We are not alone. Even C\\xe9line Dion can\\u2019t get Siri to do what she wants. She posted a hilarious video on Instagram of an all too familiar occurrence, making us feel a bit better about ourselves.\n\\n \\n\\n \\n Siri Didn\\u2019t Want To Do What C\\xe9line Dion Wanted Her To \\n \\n \\nThe six-time Grammy winner asked Siri to play her version Hymne \\xe0 l\\u2019amour . It seems Siri didn\\u2019t\\u2019 quite understand C\\xe9line\\u2019s request and played another of her famous hits.\n\\n \\n \\nShe said, \\u201cHey Siri, play Hymne \\xe0 l\\u2019amour by C\\xe9line Dion?,\\u2019 \\u201d\n\\n \\n \\nHer phone responded, \\u201cI cannot find that track by C\\xe9line Dion but here is My Heart Will Go On .\\u201d\n\\n \\n \\n\\u201cNo! Hello,\\u201d a frustrated C\\xe9line said. \\u201cNo, no, no.\\u201d\n\\n \\n \\nShe asked a second time and once again, Siri played My Heart Will Go On .\n\\n \\n \\nC\\xe9line decided to give it one more shot and made her request in her most elegant French accent. This time, Siri got it right.\n\\n \\n \\n\\u201cThird time\\u2019s a charm,\\u201d she captioned the video.\n\\n \\n \\nA fan wrote, \\u201cBut Siri knows that C\\xe9line Dion is the greatest and most beautiful singer of all time!\\u201d\n\\n \\n \\nThis fan agreed, \\u201cOmg I love you so much.\\u201d\n\\n \\n \\nThis one noticed that Siri didn\\u2019t quite do C\\xe9line\\u2019s accent justice. \\u201cAnd yet Siri\\u2019s final response was barely French.\\u201d\n\\n \\n \\nC\\xe9line, thank you for sharing your blunder and helping us remember we aren\\u2019t alone.\n\\n \\n \\n You can find the source of this story\\u2019s featured image here .\n\\n \\n",

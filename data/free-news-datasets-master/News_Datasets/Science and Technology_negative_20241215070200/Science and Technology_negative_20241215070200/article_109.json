    "text": "Key Takeaways - Recent playlist changes in Black Ops 6 removed the popular Stakeout 24/7 and Nuketown 24/7 playlists. - Community backlash arises from the absence of beloved playlists in favor of less popular options. - Future playlists may bring back Stakeout 24/7 and Nuketown 24/7 as developers refine map combinations. Stakeout 24/7 and Nuketown 24/7 have been removed from the available Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 playlists, and many players are unhappy. Many Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 gamers choose playlists instead of selecting specific game modes, but recent changes may affect that. Since it was released, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has offered traditional game modes like Team Deathmatch, Domination, Hardpoint, and more. While many players filter between these game modes for matchmaking, others gravitate towards the playlists. Chosen game modes could occur on any of the 10 standard maps, while playlists allow players to stick to one specific map with rotating modes. When Nuketown was introduced to Black Ops 6 on November 1, it joined Stakeout 24/7 as a popular way for players to earn more weapon XP. One new change to these playlists has resulted in some players expressing their frustration.

(Is It Worth The Money?) ](/call-of-duty-cod-black-ops-6-warzone-blackcell-bp-worth-it/) Black Ops 6 and Warzone reintroduce the BlackCell Battle Pass for players to purchase, but is it worth it? Here's all you need to know. Reddit users NothingToDreamAbout, OxyClean_, and Productive1990 are among many players voicing their displeasure with Black Ops 6 Season 1's playlist changes. The two notably missing playlists in the latest rotation are Stakeout 24/7 and Nuketown 24/7. While Nuketown is still offered in what's now called Radioactive 24/7, it's featured alongside Warhead. Although it references Nuketown, Warhead is among the least popular Call of Duty maps. This is because it's mostly a desert location, with a central building acting as the key combat zone. This is amplified by the absence of Stakeout, which has been praised as one of Black Ops 6's best Multiplayer maps . Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Fans Miss Previous Playlists - Nuketown 24/7 - Stakeout 24/7 The current playlists available in Black Ops 6 are Gunfight, Radioactive 24/7, Ransack, and Season 1 Moshpit. Since playlists were introduced to Call of Duty, rotating through different lists is nothing new. As the game is expected to get more maps in the future, the game will likely get new playlists that the community may prefer over the current lineup. One key reason the latest changes have affected the player base is that this is the first major alteration to the offerings, and it's being perceived as a downgrade from what was already there. Although they're missing with the launch of Black Ops 6 Season 1 , Nuketown 24/7 and Stakeout 24/7 could return in the future. Because Black Ops 6 is still in its early days, developers may still be trying to figure out the best map combinations for playlists. As Treyarch continues to update Black Ops 6 , future playlists may bundle appropriate maps like Modern Warfare 2's Shoot the Ship.",

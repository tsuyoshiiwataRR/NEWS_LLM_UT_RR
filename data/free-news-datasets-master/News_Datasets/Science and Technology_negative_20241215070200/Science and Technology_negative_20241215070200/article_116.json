    "text": "Source: NurPhoto / Getty / Elon Musk / X\nElon Musk might have definitely screwed himself big time. It’s looking like the migration to other social media platforms like Bluesky isn’t a fluke; even journalists are bidding farewell to X, formally Twitter.\nThe cesspool that is X is now experiencing a mass exodus of not just regular folks but journalists and other organizations who have finally had enough of Elon Musk and the dumb changes he made to the once uber-popular platform.\nThe Daily Kos reports that the main reasons people deactivate their X accounts are the forthcoming changes to the terms of service that will take effect on Nov.15 and the platform’s poor quality.\nPer The Daily Kos : X’s new service terms require users who wish to sue the company to file in specifically the “U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts located in Tarrant County, Texas.” These courts are a favorite of conservative activists as they are stocked with Republican appointees.\nThe Washington Post reports that new terms of service is a red flag to many who believe its a move to bring cases to Musk and conservative-friendly courts.\nOne of the courts that Musk is pushing for features Judge Reed O’Conner, who just so happens to own between $15,000 and $50,000 worth of Tesla stock. He also refused to recuse himself from Musk’s lawsuit against Media Matters.\nWe reported that The Guardian took the massive step of announcing it would no longer post on X but will not stop users from sharing their stories on the platform.\n“Social media can be an important tool for news organisations and help us to reach new audiences,” The Guardian writes, “but, at this point, X now plays a diminished role in promoting our work.”\nDon Lemon, who is currently embroiled in a lawsuit with Musk for an alleged breach of contract, also announced he was done with X, writing in a statement , “I once believed it was a place for honest debate and discussion, transparency, and free speech, but I now feel it does not serve that purpose.”\nThe departure from X also comes Bluesky saw its memberships skyrocket in the wake of Musk fully endorsing Donald Trump and seeing ridiculous amounts of right-wing propaganda flooding timelines.\nMusk was also appointed head of a new agency, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) , which is something else he is pumping into his personal X account.\nThe second Trump presidency already reeks of corruption.",

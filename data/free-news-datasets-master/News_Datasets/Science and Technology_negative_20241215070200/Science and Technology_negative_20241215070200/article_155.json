    "text": "D-Wave Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\nD-Wave Quantum reported Q3 2024 financial results with mixed performance. QCaaS revenue grew 41% year-over-year to $1.6M, while total revenue decreased 27% to $1.9M due to lower professional services revenue. The company reported a net loss of $22.7M, up 41% from prior year. Year-to-date highlights include 11% revenue growth and 54% increase in GAAP gross profit.\nNotable developments include NTT DOCOMO's planned production deployment for network optimization, completion of a 4,400-qubit Advantage2 processor calibration, and being deemed 'awardable' on the US Department of Defense's Tradewinds platform. The company maintains its fiscal 2024 guidance expecting Adjusted EBITDA Loss to be less than FY2023's $54.3M.\nD-Wave Quantum ha riportato i risultati finanziari del terzo trimestre del 2024 con una performance mista. I ricavi da QCaaS sono aumentati del 41% rispetto all'anno precedente, raggiungendo 1,6 milioni di dollari, mentre i ricavi totali sono diminuiti del 27% a 1,9 milioni di dollari a causa di una riduzione dei ricavi dei servizi professionali. L'azienda ha registrato una perdita netta di 22,7 milioni di dollari, in aumento del 41% rispetto all'anno precedente. I risultati annuali includono una crescita dei ricavi dell'11% e un incremento del 54% del profitto lordo secondo i principi contabili GAAP.\nSviluppi notevoli includono il previsto dispiegamento della produzione da parte di NTT DOCOMO per l'ottimizzazione della rete, il completamento della calibrazione di un processore Advantage2 da 4.400 qubit, e la qualificazione come 'premiabile' sulla piattaforma Tradewinds del Dipartimento della Difesa degli Stati Uniti.

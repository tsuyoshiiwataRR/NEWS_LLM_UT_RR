    "text": "Zotero won't generate bibliography in Word 365 Hi, I was trying to demo Zotero in Word for a student, but it wouldn't generate a bibliography using the citations in the document. It popped up a box \"Edit Bibliography\" which also wouldn't generate a bibliography. Any idea what is going on? I used to be able to do this with no problem whatsoever. Even having to select the bibliography entries is tedious (assuming that's what's supposed to happen), when this used to be such a seamless process. Thanks, CJ Any idea what is going on?

That just means you already have a bibliography in the document. (Note that the button is \"Add/Edit Bibliography\".) If you don't see it, toggle[Word field codes](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/word_field_codes)and search for \"ZOTERO_BIBL\".",

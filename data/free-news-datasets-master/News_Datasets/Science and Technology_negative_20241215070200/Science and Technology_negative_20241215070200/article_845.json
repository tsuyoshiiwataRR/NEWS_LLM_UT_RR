    "text": "In recent weeks, Twitch has been filled with debates about content moderation and advertising policies. And at the center of it all are Asmongold and HasanAbi. Dubbed the ‚Äú adpocalypse ,‚Äù this wave of demonetization has left many creators and viewers questioning the platform‚Äôs future.\nHasan blames Asmon and the people he collaborates with. | Image Credit: @HasanAbi/YouTube Hasan has blamed fellow content creator Asmon for the so-called Twitch adpocalypse, which is now oddly simlar to YouTube‚Äôs advertiser fallout in 2016-2017. Known for his outspoken criticism of the platform‚Äôs policies, Asmon responded candidly, accepting partial responsibility for the issue. Is this the first step of a domino effect that leads to the platform downfall?\nAsmongold Doesn‚Äôt Disagree With Hasan, But It‚Äôs Much Deeper Than That Asmon agrees that some of it is on him. | Image Credit: @asmongold/YouTube The drama began with FaZe Kaysan, who revealed that his Twitch channel had been demonetized for using the ‚ÄòIran‚Äô tag in his streams. Other creators, such as BigEx, also faced similar situations for using tags like ‚ÄòVenezuela‚Äô.\nim about to go live right now, i just found out i was demonetized on twitch for representing my country venezuela, for the past month i didnt make a single penny on ads‚Ä¶ i have had venezuela in my tags for the longest‚Ä¶ this is absurd im missing thousands of dollars.\n‚Äî Ex üåü (@ExSZN) November 13, 2024 Hasan linked these incidents to Asmongold, attributing it to his criticisms of the platform‚Äôs moderation practices. Hasan says that Asmon threatening to reveal the moderation team‚Äôs biases has played a role in alienating advertisers.\nüö®Asmongold responds to Hasanabi Blaming Him For Twitch Adpocalypse also calls out Frogan,Denims, and others for taking No AccountabiltyüëÄ\n\"The issue is that people are not taking accountability for the bad things that they're doing, and they're trying to pretend like they're‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/T4ZWvnQYqw\n‚Äî Bestfriend (@BestfriendKick) November 13, 2024 Asmon did not shy away from the accusations. Addressing Hasan‚Äôs comments, he noted that he might have contributed to the so-called adpocalypse. ‚Äú I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs entirely my fault, but some of it definitely is ,‚Äù he told his viewers.\nRelated ‚ÄúThrowing people under the bus doesn‚Äôt help your situation‚Äù: Dr Disrespect Exposing Twitch Streamers, Who Should‚Äôve Been Banned, Leaves a Bitter Taste in Fans‚Äô Mouths Talking about past controversies, including his own suspension for remarks about Palestinian culture, he emphasized the need for accountability. He criticized the platform for allowing ‚Äú double standards ‚Äù in content moderation.\nFaZe Kaysan reveals that Twitch demonetized him, despite running ads and not being paid, because he had ‚ÄòIran‚Äô in his tags. Kaysan is originally from Iran üëÄ pic.twitter.com/rcyB8CrBau\n‚Äî FearBuck (@FearedBuck) November 13, 2024 The financial impact of these controversies is already apparent. FaZe Kaysan and others have reported significant losses due to demonetization. Kaysan revealed that his use of the ‚ÄòIran‚Äô tag resulted in his inability to generate ad revenue, despite years of using the tag without issue.\nWill This Be A YouTube 2.0 Situation? Where Does It Go From Here? Image Credit: Twitch The situation has been escalated after Asmon‚Äôs reaction to the recent controversy with Central_Committee, a political streamer. When the streamer was only issued a three-day ban, Asmon demanded stricter action, threatening to expose the platform ‚Äòs alleged biases.\nAsmongold plans to do a stream exposing Twitch and its biased moderation team and says that if he gets banned for the expose, he‚Äôll move to Rumble or Kick üëÄ pic.twitter.com/glMsSghAzk\n‚Äî FearBuck (@FearedBuck) November 13, 2024 The looming threat of an adpocalypse is concerning for the platform‚Äôs creators, especially those reliant on ad revenue. If the platform goes through a change like YouTube, creators producing edgy or politically charged material may face stricter restrictions or reduced income.\nRelated Johnny Somali‚Äôs Latest Crime Might Land Him in Korean Prison for 7 Years as Ex-Twitch Streamer F*cks Around and Finds Out The higher ups of the platform now stand at a crossroads. With calls for greater accountability and fairer moderation, the platform must balance the demands of its creators, viewers, and advertisers.\nAsmon‚Äôs threat to expose further issues and with his willingness to move to rival platforms like Kick or Rumble shows just how bad the situation could become.\nWhile Asmon and Hasan are on opposing ends of the situation, the call for action isn‚Äôt for either of them but for the platform itself. Now all we can do is wait for this situation to unfold.",

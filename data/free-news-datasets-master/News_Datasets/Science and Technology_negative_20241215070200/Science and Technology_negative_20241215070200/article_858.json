    "text": "While most security decision makers are expanding their security tools rather than replacing them, this could create greater risks for practitioners.\nAccording to new Google Workspace research, while nearly two-thirds (62%) of UK-based IT leaders admitted to adding new security tools as they go along, those ending up with ten or more experience more security incidents than those with fewer.\nJustin Anderson, director of Google Workspace for the UK and Ireland, said the study highlights a long-running problem for cybersecurity practitioners, with many organizations falling into the trap of overloading teams with tools in the belief it will bolster broader resilience,\n\"This piecemeal approach to security not only fails to address the root of the problem but often exacerbates it by creating a complex and unwieldy security environment that is difficult to manage effectively,\" Anderson said.\nMeanwhile, the survey from Google Workspace found legacy tech is increasingly becoming a liability. This is an acute problem in the UK, where three-quarters of security leaders believe it's left them ill-equipped to handle the challenges of modern security threats, compared with just 59% globally.\nHowever, newer technologies are causing concern too. More than three-quarters of respondents told Google they believed that generative AI usage has contributed to a rise in security incidents - much more than the global average of 65%.\nMany IT leaders are also slow to act on these concerns, the study noted. Only a quarter of respondents said they have introduced AI-specific security policies, compared to a global average of 41%.",

    "text": "KAMLOOPS — Social media and the internet have led to an increase in the spread of misinformation.\n“Misinformation tends to play a lot on our emotions and our biases. And when those two things are in play, it’s almost like our critical thinking brain switches off and we are unable to critically review the headline or the story we are looking at,” said Jo-Ann Coggan, operator at the Big Little Science Centre.\nThe Big Little Science Centre, along with the Kamloops Adult Learners Society, put on a presentation Thursday (Nov. 14) discussing how to discern the legitimacy of information.\n“There is also that negativity bias where we do tend to focus on negative things. That is a survival instinct — know what bad things are going on in the world so we can ultimately protect ourselves. We tend to pay attention to those things, too,” added Coggan.\nThere was conversations about the role of technology in misinformation, and how the past 10 years have influenced the increase.\n“Years ago, you would talk to your friends and maybe you would argue about things. Now, there seems to be more of a polarization and that middle ground, that nuance, where you could say, ‘Have you thought about it this way?’ Some people don’t want to know,” said attendee Paul Corcoran.\nThe Kamloops Adult Learners Society puts on several presentations with the science centre every year, tackling a number of important topics.\n“I think it empowers our members to really think critically at some of the things you read and see on television and the computer,” said KALS President Sue Holmes. “Misinformation can snowball so quickly and often it preys on peoples emotions so people get really upset and really involved in what they are reading and share it with their friends. Then people get polarized.”\nThe main issue with misinformation is that it often spreads faster than true facts.\n“Before you know it, it has gone viral and it’s not true. Somebody at some point usually looks at the original article, starts digging into the article, researching it, googling it, finds out it’s misinformation,” said Coggan. “And then you can stop it at that point. You can report it and get it removed off social media. But sometimes it’s gone viral before that ever happens.”\nThroughout the month of November the Big Little Science Centre is also offering misinformation workshops for high school students.",

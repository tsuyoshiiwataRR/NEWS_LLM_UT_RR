    "text": "10-05-2024 05:04 PM\nHello,\nI got the new Google Streamer a couple of days ago, I previously was using a Chromecast 4K with Google TV. My connection is Streamer to LG CX, and the TV to LG Soundbar, same as I had before.\nWhen playing content in several apps (YouTube, Disney+, Max, etc) the audio randomly drops out for fractions of a second (the video keeps playing). Sometimes it happens twice in a minute, sometimes it does every 20min, it's random. This never happened with the Chromecast 4K and I had the exact same setup.\nI've tried all different audio settings in the Google Streamer with no avail, it always happens. Is this issue currently being addressed?\nAnswered!\n[Go to the Recommended Answer.](/t5/Streaming/Google-Streamer-audio-drops-out-randomly/m-p/652824#M58323)\n2 weeks ago - last edited 2 weeks ago\nHi folks,\nThank you for your response and the additional information. I'm sorry the troubleshooting steps didn't work for you. The team is still investigating the audio sync issue, but as soon as there's more info to share, we will be posting an update in the main thread pinned at the top of the board. For any updates we post, you can check the post: Regarding audio and video not synced with Google TV Streamer.\nWarm regards,\nJeremy.\n10-06-2024 10:49 AM\nhaing the same random issue with audio playback\n10-08-2024 01:29 PM\nSame for me, I tried nearly all settings changes and configurations but I'm pretty sure the issue is coming from the Google streamer. I hope this gets fixed with a firmware update...\n10-08-2024 04:04 PM\nHi folks,\nThank you for taking the time to post in this community and the detailed information you’ve provided. I understand that you're encountering random audio dropouts on your Google TV Streamer (4K). I am here to help and find a solution together.\nTo assist you with the best solution, I would like to get a bit more information:\nPlease keep me posted.\nSincerely,\nJeremy.\n10-08-2024 04:17 PM\nHello thanks for your response, my answers here:\nThanks for the help,\nBest.\n10-09-2024 01:38 AM - edited 10-09-2024 01:39 AM\n10-08-2024 05:04 PM - last edited a month ago\nThank you for your prompt response and the detailed information you’ve provided. Please try the following troubleshooting steps:\nReboot the Google TV Streamer From the Google TV\nFrom the power source\nCheck whether your TV, AVR, or soundbar has an audio offset adjustment setting.\nCheck if the dialogue enhancement and volume leveler settings are disabled. If it is enabled, turn it off.\nCheck if the surround settings are disabled. If it is enabled, turn it off.\nReboot the router\nPlease keep me posted and let me know how it goes.\nBest regards,\nJeremy.\n10-10-2024 03:01 AM\nI did everything on the list, watched YouTube for a couple of hours and heard no audio drops. Will let you know if they come back. I hope not!\n3 weeks ago\nUpdate: I still get audio drops outs every now and then. waiting for a good software update!!\n3 weeks ago\nOkay I've been testing this for many days. I used a 2.1 HDMI cable and followed all of your suggestions, except for turning off surround sound as this is not an option for me, I want it ON. The problem still persists unfortunately, and seems I'm not the only one. It's really annoying.\n10-09-2024 02:00 AM - edited 10-09-2024 02:01 AM\nWill try all these steps tonight, reading around the internet it seems like more people are reporting a similar issue with random audio dropouts. ( at least the video seems to be working correctly )\n10-09-2024 02:44 AM\nAsking to turn surround sound off is insane. Give us audio pass through, we don’t want the streamer being the decoder.\n10-09-2024 11:41 AM - edited 10-10-2024 02:59 AM\nThis would probably solve the issue for some, but the streamer should still be able to decode audio without any issues.\na month ago\nI'm having same issue Google. Never happened with my Roku connect to same setup with same cables. Love everything else about the steamer. Picture is 10x better than Roku ultra and home automation controls and live Google cam feeds over top of what you are watching is mint. Fix the audio drop outs please!\n3 weeks ago\nI also am having the exact same issue at about the 20 minute time frame with complete audio drop out while streaming. I too did not have this issue with the Google Chromecast 4k. My setup is a LG G3 OLED, JBL Bar 1000 and I am using a eARC HDMI 2.1 cable. Very disappointing Google.\n2 weeks ago\nSimilar thing here. New Streamer, same setup otherwise, just unplugged my Fire TV Stick 4K and replaced with the streamer. Audio dropouts vary from once a minute to once every 15 mins or so.\n2 weeks ago - last edited 2 weeks ago\nHi folks,\nThank you for your response and the additional information.

I didn't experience audio delays (at least didn't notice any), my issue is about audio dropouts. The sound cuts out for fractions of a second and comes back, with video playback unaffected.\n2 weeks ago\nExactly. This is about dropouts, not sync.\n2 weeks ago\nHi folks,\nI hear you, apologies for any confusion. The team is looking into audio dropouts alongside the sync problems. We'll post updates in the thread I provide you above when there is more to share.\nWarm regard,\nJeremy.\nWednesday\nI have a similar issue, but audio cuts out all together, at random. Streamer is connected directly to my AVR. I have tried many cables and my former Chromecast with Google TV does not have this issue with the same cables on the same input. The only way I can fix this by switching inputs on the AVR, causing the HDMI handshake take place again and the audio comes back. Video is never affected.\nyesterday\nI am having the same exact issue as you.\nHDMI 2.1 cables did not fix the issue even though they're lamenting on and on about that. Seems the Google team is just trying to buy time.\nIf I play audio through the TV speakers I have no issues, but it's super disappointing.\nWhat is odd though is Plex seems to have no issue with this, it's only stuff like YouTube or Netflix that have this skipping problem. Perhaps it's the format that the audio of my content is on my server?\nHalf tempted to try to return this streamer it's honestly been an awful experience so far with audio (this isn't the only issue) and other bugs.\nyesterday\nHello there,\nI'm sorry you're experiencing issues with your audio and Google TV Streamer (4K). I will suggest that you review our recommended answer. Google is working diligently to resolve these issues. Keep an eye on this topic for updates.\nWarm regards,\nJeremy.\nyesterday\nHi Jeremy\nYour recommended answer hasn't been updated with a status on whatever update you guys are cooking up for weeks.\nPretty sure a lot of us are sick and tired of being used as beta testers. Why can't we get an update.\nWarm regards,\nAngry Potato\nan hour ago\nI installed the latest update last night which allows you to manually pick audio format. I picked Dobby+. And so far no drop outs. I'll evaluate further tonight.\nJust came across this article\nhttps://9to5google.com/2024/11/15/google-tv-streamer-audio-format-update/",

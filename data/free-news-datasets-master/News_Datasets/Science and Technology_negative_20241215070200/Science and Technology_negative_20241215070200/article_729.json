Suddenly, this past week or so, folders inside a fence can't be moved as I need to, usually putting higher priority items at the bottom inside a given fence. Uninstalled and reinstalled yesterday, restarted laptop, still no change. Windows not set to \"Auto Arrange\" , I did enable the regedit to show the 'Lock Fences' feature removed in v5, but that doesn't have any affect. No clue what's happened but hard to use Fences now with this bizarre issue which is multiplied because I have about 12 fences on my desktop - many folders within each. Please advise\nN.B: Just noted that this only happens on one (1) of my 3 monitors, my other two, I can move icons around without issue\nMoved to Fences area\n[basj](/users/281/basj)\nReply #1 Friday, November 15, 2024 8:14 AM\nHello,\nSorry to hear you are having issues. Need to know more on your system and issue.\n- Your Windows10 or 11 full version and OS Build number. Please use Winver.exe.\n- Fences full version number.\n- Is this issue on Desktop Fences or Portal Fences?\n- Does the Icons move as you click and drag and move itself back to its old position or it does not react to your click and drag at all?\n- Did you have recently install a new software or update something that also introduce something onto your desktop area.\nThank you.\nBasj,\nStardock Community Assistant.\nPlease [login](/account/logon) to comment and/or vote for this skin.\nWelcome Guest!

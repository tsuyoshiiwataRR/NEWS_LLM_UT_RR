    "text": "We’re here 24/7. 365 days a year.\nAsk questions. Find your answers. Connect.\n3 hours ago\nSince installation of our Eero 6 we have had intermittent problems with the wifi dropping out (especially in our Lounge and upstairs) was thinking of getting an extender to help with this but before I purchase one I understand that this may not solve the issue [Message for KeithFrench](/t5/Full-Fibre/Message-for-KeithFrench/m-p/3072620#U3072620)\nWe run health checks and it is always Ok and the wifi comes back on but it gets annoying and not sure whats causing the buffering and drop outs!\nAny advice would be much appreciated\nThanks\nDonna\n2 minutes ago\nThanks Keith much appreciated and yes very annoying as Talk Talk installed it (or a subcontractor) so a bit disappointing that they don't bear your recommendations in mind when putting them in. Unfortunately, it cant really be moved easily and certainly not to the lounge without lots and lots of trunking! As mentioned the only thing in the way is concrete walls and double glazed windows but possibly other devices are a problem? I assume I need to download the wifi scanner (Or Netspot free in my case) to a home desktop (Apple Mac) that is connected to the wifi and then follow your guide? In the meantime, I will look at the possibility of moving the eero to a higher location but within the same room to see if this might help\n57 minutes ago\nHi [@Donna2569](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/747828)\nThanks for that. I disagree with whoever installed the eero, that it would be fine near a TV. It needs to be moved, but this is not as daunting as it might sound. There is just an Ethernet cable connecting the eero to the ONT, which I assume is nearby. Is there somewhere else in the lounge that it could be moved to? If there is, then buy a new Cat 6 minimum Ethernet cable (loads on Amazon) and you can also get self-adhesive white plastic trunking to hide it in. The general rule for the new location is do not keep the eero in a cupboard, but out in the open and sited as high & centrally within the property. Keep them away from:-\na) Thick window glass or glazing can block Wi-Fi signals.\nb) Low-emissivity (Low-E) windows have a metallic film that can reflect and block Wi-Fi signals more than clear glass.\nc) Tinted glass often has a metallic film that can interfere with radio signals.\nd) K glass double glazing has a metal vapour coating that can reduce Wi-Fi signal strength by 30-50%.\nDo not worry about interpreting the results, I will do that for you. I will send a PM to you that contains a link for a guide of mine on Wi-Fi interference. It is quite long (about 30 pages), but you will probably only need to look at three or four pages in total. Initially look at the section called \"Are you suffering from interference – prove it first\". This is the first link in the table of contents. This section includes full details of free Wi-Fi analysers that I recommend for Windows, Windows phone, Android and Apple operating systems. However, I have no way of testing the Apple product. Select the analyser of your choice & my guide explains how to use it.\nIf you are using Wi-Fi Scanner, then please attach the zip file to this thread. As soon as I have downloaded it, I will remove the attachment from your post, to preserve your privacy.\nWith all other analysers, please follow my instructions below.\nCollect the screenshots that I require and include them in your reply.\nPlease post the screenshots to me in a PM (to protect your privacy), which I have requested in my guide. No photos please as they can be difficult to read, because the text can get out of focus when zoomed in. Please ensure that the analyser window is maximised (if Windows) before taking the screenshots & upload them via the \"Insert Photos\" button (in a mobile browser it's the picture icon) on the post editor's toolbar with the Size parameter set to Large.\nKeith\nI am not employed by TalkTalk, I'm just a customer.

It doesnt have to pass through any large metal objects or water just concrete and stud walls. To be honest though prior to the eero we always had problems with Talk Talk broadband with the TV in the lounge buffering. Its not as bad now with eero but still does it and its still annoying. This TV does use the 2.4Ghz band and intermittently buffers when streaming (Netflix, Fire Stick etc) . However, we do also have similar problems in the kitchen and bedrooms upstairs which all use the 5Ghz band. Thought a booster may help but not sure as it can be fine for days and then just drop out and as soon as you go on the app and run a health check it connects again and says wifi is all connected?\nan hour ago\nHi [@Donna2569](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/747828)\nThanks for creating your thread.\nPlease can you roughly describe where the eero is within your property & what is around it, in respect of other electrical equipment? Is it likely that to reach the dead zones, the WiFi signal would have to pass through any large metal objects or tanks of water etc?\n.Slow speed, intermittent dropouts, breaks in the signal or no signal on some or all devices or no internet access might be caused by Wi-Fi interference from other local networks, which can also lead to a permanent reduction in speed. No ISP can be responsible for your local environment, this is mainly a byproduct of the popularity of Wi-Fi.\nHowever, other factors should be investigated first. When this happens, what is the status displayed in the app for the internet connection? Do you have any wired connections & if so, how do they perform?\nGenerally speaking, the 2.4GHz band suffers a lot more from interference than the much faster 5GHz band, but the 2.4GHz one can sometimes have a better range, but this all depends on your local area.\nIn other words, I try to help you optimise your Wi-Fi connection. The next stage involves sending out a guide to you to help you get me some important diagnostic results so that I can analyse them for you and recommend changes to your router configuration to solve them.\nI only send this out to people who request it.\nWhilst the eero is supposed to manage Wi-Fi interference, if this is very bad, particularly in the 2.4GHz band, then it cannot do anything about it, no router can. The same goes for any router at that point.\nKeith\nI am not employed by TalkTalk, I'm just a customer.

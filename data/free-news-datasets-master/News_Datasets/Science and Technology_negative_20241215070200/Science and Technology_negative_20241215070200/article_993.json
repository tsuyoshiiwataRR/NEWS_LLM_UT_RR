    "text": "Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has cast doubt on the need for a mid-cycle console upgrade due to the advancements in technology.\nSpeaking with Rolling Stone, Spencer was asked if Microsoft has any similar plans to Sony’s own mid-cycle refresh, the recently-launched\nPS5 Pro, but suggested it’s hard to show the benefits these days as consoles are far more technologically capable than the transition from standard to high-definition.\nDoes a new device really give you a unique experience on screen in some way? [It’s] less like the old days, going from the original Xbox to 360; that was standard definition to high definition. Now, [it’s] harder to show the benefits.\nRelated Content — Upcoming PS5 Games 2024: The Best PS5 Games Coming Soon\nMicrosoft has released a mid-cycle upgrade in the past during the Xbox One era, with the Xbox One X offering a more power under the hood similar to what Sony did during the same generation via PS4 Pro. The company has Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S available on the market for the current cycle, with the former the more powerful version of the system.\nThe PS5 Pro was released on November 7, 2024 priced at $699.99/£699.99.

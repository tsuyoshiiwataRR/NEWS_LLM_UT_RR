Reau, MD, FAASLD, AGAF, discusses the impact certain herbal and dietary supplements may have on the liver, especially among patients with underlying liver disease.\nThe data were presented at the ACG Annual Scientific Meeting.\n“It does suggest that green tea extract and turmeric might be a cautionary tale in your patients who have underlying liver disease, especially metabolic dysfunction-associated liver disease,” Reau, the Richard B. Capps Chair of Hepatology, associate director of solid organ transplantation and section chief of hepatology at Rush University, told Healio. “These are two things you may want to monitor if a patient is interested in taking that.”\nReference: Halegoua-DeMarzio D, et al.

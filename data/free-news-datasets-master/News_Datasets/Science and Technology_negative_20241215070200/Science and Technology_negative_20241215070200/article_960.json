    "text": "It looks like Shift Up’s crossover with Neon Genesis Evangelion in Goddess of Victory: NIKKE didn’t exactly match the expectations. A recent interview with Nikke’s producer revealed what they think went wrong in the Nikke x Evangelion collab that dropped in August 2024.\nWhat Went Wrong?\nAccording to Shift Up, the Evangelion collab event had a few flaws. It featured Rei, Asuka, Mari and Misato in outfits that stayed faithful to their original designs, but players weren’t exactly racing to snag them.\nApparently, the initial designs for the Evangelion characters by team Shift Up and Nikke were deemed too erotic for Evangelion’s creators. So, they later toned down things a bit. The faithful designs pleased the licensors, but the ‘modified’ aesthetics didn’t please the audience.\nWhat Did the Players Think?\nIt’s not just the outfits that missed the mark. Players didn’t feel much incentive to spend on limited-time characters or costumes, especially when the skins didn’t add much flair. The most expensive option, Asuka’s gacha skin, looked way too similar to her base model, which definitely didn’t interest any player.\nPeople love Goddess of Victory: NIKKE for its unapologetically over-the-top anime girls and compelling writing. But its recent collabs have diluted that identity, so players think that it’s just not worth the effort.\nNikke already has a strong foundation but the uninspired designs and the entire Evangelion event felt quite stretched out. Shift Up says they’re taking feedback into account for future events, and here’s hoping they actually do.\nMeanwhile, you can check out the games Neon Genesis Evangelion and Goddess of Victory: NIKKE on the Google Play Store. Instead of half-baked crossovers, I hope we get to see Shift Up turn things around and dropping amazing content in the coming months.\nBefore leaving, read our news on Wuthering Waves’ Version 1.4 Update on Android.",

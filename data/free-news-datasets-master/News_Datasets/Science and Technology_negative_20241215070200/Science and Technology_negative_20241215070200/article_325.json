    "text": "Renowned author Stephen King recently addressed rumors that he was banned from X (formerly Twitter) by the social media platform’s current owner, Elon Musk . Accordingly, fans are wondering what he said and whether he had been banned from X for certain.\nHere is what we have learned about the rumors surrounding King’s apparent X ban and his reactions to the same.\nStephen King addresses rumor about Elon Musk and X (Twitter)? King shot down the rumors of him being banned from the social media site by Musk, confirming he was still there.\nTaking to X (formerly Twitter) , the literary icon also debunked the rumor claiming he had called the Tesla CEO “Trump’s first new lady,” saying he “didn’t,” due to not having thought of it.\nI see there's a rumor going around that I called the Musk-man Trump's new first lady. I didn't, but only because I didn't think of it. There's also a rumor going around that Muskie kicked me off Twitter. Yet here I am.\n— Stephen King (@StephenKing) November 13, 2024 Meanwhile, fans responded negatively to King. “There was also a rumor that you were leaving America if Trump was elected, yet here you are,” wrote one fan. Another fan even claimed that there were no such rumors. They also stated that The Shining author was “irrelevant” and “desperate for attention.” Eventually, Musk responded to King’s post, writing, “Hi Steve.”\nThe novelist has often levied criticism against the Tesla CEO. Recently, Musk posted on X that Kamala Harris wanted to “break the constitution.” He attached a video snippet, wherein she said she would take executive action if Congress did not act on enforcing mandatory gun confiscation.\nTo this, Stephen King put up a post on X , calling Musk’s claim “ridiculous.” Moreover, he recently shared how Musk had posted on the social media site 3000 times last month. The author claimed the tech mogul spread “pro-Trump disinformation” and “outright lies.” King even asked users to be mindful of Musk’s posts.\nElon Musk earlier introduced a policy, that wiped pre-existing blue ticks from verified accounts. He mentioned it would only be given to subscribers of Twitter Blue. However, Musk reportedly allowed King to keep the blue tick. The author addressed this on X , saying he had neither subscribed to Twitter Blue nor given his contact details.",

    "text": "With Microsoft pushing hard for its games to be available on Game Pass on day one, could pushing for DLC and expansions, which everyone has to pay full price for, be a lucrative way to capitalize on the subscription model\\u2019s huge user base? Even if that\\u2019s the case, Xbox division boss Phil Spencer mentions that there\\u2019s no special policy forcing game makers to push for expansions in their games.\n\\nThis was something Spencer confirmed in an interview with Game File (subscription required), where the exec clarified that there is no \\u201ctop down mandate\\u201d on expansions, stating, \\u201cIt\\u2019s really left to the creators [regarding] what plan they have for their stories. I think it\\u2019s a great way for us to reengage players who may be lapsed.\\u201d\n\\n Xbox Boss Phil Spencer Does Not Want DLC To Feel Like Cut Content \\nContinuing the conversation, Spencer notes, \\u201cI don\\u2019t like expansions that are manipulative,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI want it to have a unique point of view. I don\\u2019t want it to be, like, the third level that you cut before you launched.\\u201d Using Diablo 4\\u2019s Vessel of Hatred expansion as an example, Spencer mentions how it adds a new class, while Starfield\\u2019s Shattered Space DLC gives players a whole new world.\n\\nSpeaking of Starfield, Spencer mentions the time he had a conversation with Todd Howard, the acclaimed game director at Bethesda, about keeping the balance between adding new features and releasing a full-fledged expansion. \\u201cTodd and I were talking about Shattered Space. Starfield is a game I put a ton of hours into and really love, but they\\u2019ve had this thing where they\\u2019ve added features throughout the year and then they had an expansion.\\xa0I think some of the feedback on the expansion is: \\u2018We wanted more features.\\u2019 And he\\u2019s like, \\u2018Well, should we have waited to put buggies out? And so, I think you\\u2019re trying to tune both development effort and the impact of the expansion. And I think there will always be a balance to managing the game month to month. But not every game will do expansions.\\u201d\n\\nThis is definitely the right mentality and something we hope other execs follow as well. While expansions are a good way to prolong a game\\u2019s lifespan and earn extra revenue, it shouldn\\u2019t be something mandated just for the sake of revenue. This is also why not all DLCs are built the same, as some feel like they\\u2019re cut content being sold separately, while others feel like a love letter to the fans (such as FromSoftware\\u2019s Shadow of the Erdtree expansion for Elden Ring).\n\\nHow do you think developers and publishers can balance adding game features for free and offering paid expansions? Sound off and let us know in the comments.\n\\n More Xbox Reading\n\\n\\n",

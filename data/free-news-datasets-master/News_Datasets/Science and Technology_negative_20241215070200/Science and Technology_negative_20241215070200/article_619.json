    "text": "Ministry of Energy says it is yet to finalise the formulation of electric vehicles (EVs) regulatory guidelines, adding that the legal framework will be ready in 2025.\nThis means that despite introducing import duty waiver on EVs and its accessories in the current fiscal year, the government cannot regulate the usage of the vehicles at least until next year.\nIn an interview on Tuesday, Ministry of Energy chief energy officer Austin Theu said they are still working towards the formulation of regulatory guidelines in collaboration with other stakeholders.\nMubas lecturer Patrick Khambadza bought an electric vehicle from Sky Energy “As of now, government is still working on the legal environment to come up with regulations that the Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority would be using to regulate the sector,” he said.\nOn issues of infrastructure to support the EVs such as charging equipment, Theu said the study, which the ministry is carrying out together with partners such as World Bank, will determine issues such as standards and licences of charging facilities and infrastructure, among others.\nHe said: “As of now, the public sector does not have any charging facility because its project is still under study, but we are aware that some EV start-ups in private sector are doing something.\n“This is because the vehicles come with potable charging equipment, which enables charging either at home or offices using normal electricity.”\nTwo weeks ago, Imperial Motors general manager Theodore Katandula, whose firm launched its first electric vehicle GWM ORA, said they are ready to sustain supply, adding that when fully charged, the vehicle can cover 300 kilometres (km) .\n“This is a saving to the current fuel prices because the full charge could cost K15 000, but if you convert 300km to fuel it translates to a huge saving,” she said.\nSky Energy Africa managing director Schizzo Thomson, whose firm is an EV startup, said in an interview on Tuesday that the emerging sector could significantly help reduce fuel import bill while contributing to the economy through a booming supply chain industry of charging infrastructure.\nIn a 2024/25 budget statement, government removed import duties and taxes on EVs and materials used for the construction of electric motor vehicle charging stations to reduce demand for fossil fuels and its negative impact on climate",

This option was previously enabled, and I was able to use it in the past. However, it appears that I am no longer able to access it, even though it was activated on my account.\nI would like to understand why this option is no longer available to me and if it can be reactivated. If there are specific conditions that must be met to access it, please let me know so that I can fulfill them, if applicable.\nThank you for your assistance, and I look forward to your prompt response.\n- Labels:\n-\n[Recurring Payments](/t5/forums/filteredbylabelpage/board-id/Transactions/label-name/recurring%20payments)\n[Login to Me Too](/plugins/common/feature/oauth2sso/sso_login_redirect?dest_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal-community.com%2F)\nsamsnow850\n[Options](#)\n- Mark as New\n- Bookmark\n- Subscribe\n- Mute\nhttps://www.paypal-community.com/rss/message?board.id=Transactions&message.id=157182 [Permalink](/t5/Transactions/Unable-to-access-Pay-in-4-option-on-my-PayPal-account/m-p/3192221/highlight/true#M157182)[Print](/t5/forums/forumtopicprintpage/board-id/Transactions/message-id/157182/print-single-message/true/page/1) [Report Inappropriate Content](/t5/notifications/notifymoderatorpage/message-uid/3192221)\nHello GisMRH,\nThank you for reaching out about the 'Pay in 4' option. Here are a few possible reasons why you may not be seeing it on your account at this time:\nEligibility Reviews: PayPal periodically assesses account eligibility for 'Pay in 4' based on factors like your credit standing, account activity, and transaction history. This may affect availability even if you previously had access.\nAccount Verification: Please ensure your PayPal account is fully verified (e.g., with a linked and confirmed bank account or card). This can sometimes affect feature access.\nMerchant and Purchase Type: Not all merchants or purchase types support 'Pay in 4,' so the option may not appear if the transaction does not meet these criteria.\nLocation Restrictions: Availability of 'Pay in 4' varies by region, so ensure your account location aligns with eligible regions for this feature.\nIf none of these reasons seem to apply, it might be helpful to contact PayPal Support directly for more information on your account-specific eligibility. They can give more detailed guidance on reactivation steps if applicable.\nBest regards,\nSamuel\n[Login to Me Too](/plugins/common/feature/oauth2sso/sso_login_redirect?dest_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal-community.com%2F)\nHaven't Found your Answer?\nIt happens.

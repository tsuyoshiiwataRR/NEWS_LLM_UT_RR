    "text": "\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n See full bio \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Avinash Jaisrani \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n At Tech4Gamers, I contribute as a News Reporter, combining my skills and gaming enthusiasm to keep our audience updated on the latest developments.\n\\n \\n See full bio \\n Story Highlight \\n \\n A new leak has revealed Ubisoft\\u2019s aggressive monetization plans for Assassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows. \\n The gaming giant will offer outfits, weapon skins, and more through a seasonal battle pass system. \\n This monetization will be handled through the Assassin\\u2019s Creed Infinity hub, making for a Call of Duty-like system. \\n \\n \\nAssassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows is set to change things for Ubisoft\\u2019s biggest franchise in multiple ways. For starters, the title is marking a return to day-one Steam releases and will ship without a premium season pass or early access .\n\\nA battle pass will also be introduced with this entry, and more details on this subject have recently emerged through a datamine. According to this information, Assassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows will offer Call of Duty-like cosmetics for multiple seasons.\n\\n Why it matters: Gamers today are becoming increasingly tired of aggressive microtransactions and monetization . Moreover, the trend of battle passes is far from a fan-favorite.\n\\n View post on imgur.com\n\\n\n\\nAs per the datamine , Assassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows will debut its battle pass system with season 1. Dubbed Eye in the Dark, this season will offer character packs, weapon cosmetics, and skins for in-game mounts as shown above.\n\\nA few examples include the Kagutsuchi Shinobi Pack and the Sekiryu Mount. This content can be brought through Isu Coins, a currency earned by playing the game. Completing the battle pass will reward a total of 9,050 Isu Coins, though users can continue to rely on the previously purchasable Helix Credits.\n\\nA similar system already existed in Ubisoft\\u2019s previous Assassin\\u2019s Creed offerings, but the microtransactions appear to be more aggressive this time. As proof, the gaming giant is said to be partnering with companies like Red Bull for more appealing outfits.\n\\n View post on imgur.com\n\\n\n\\nOne screenshot from the leak also highlights Assassin\\u2019s Cred Infinity, a connecting hub that will serve as the link between all future entries in the series. All in all, this system sounds similar to what Activision is doing with Call of Duty .\n\\nThe cosmetics, in particular, are very reminiscent of Activision\\u2019s approach of bombarding users with in-game items that entice them to spend money on in-game purchases. Moreover, Call of Duty frequently collaborates with companies for crossovers.\n\\n\\nWhile it remains to be seen how big of a problem the microtransactions will be, concerns over Assassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows\\u2019 monetization are not new . As such, this datamine has only added to the frustration surrounding Ubiosft\\u2019s upcoming blockbuster.\n\\nWhat do you think about the monetization?

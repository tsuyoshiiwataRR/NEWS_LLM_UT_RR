    "text": "This relatively common condition has also been linked to an increased risk of heart problems. If you are snoring at night you could have sleep apnoea, which could raise your risk of dementia\nHealth experts have issued a warning as a common sleep disorder that affects millions of Brits can raise your risk of some devastating conditions. The disorder, symptoms of which include loud snoring and waking up a lot, can lead to dementia, according to research. They have also warned that untreated obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) can result in dangerous heart issues. The Sleep Apnoea Trust states that around 10 million people in the UK are living with OSA, with four million experiencing \"moderate\" or \"severe\" symptoms. OSA causes the walls of the throat to become narrower as you sleep. This results in a range of symptoms such as loud snoring, waking up a lot and making gasping, snorting or choking noises while the person rests. As a result this can also lead to tiredness during the dayâ€¦\nFiona Callingham , Bradley Jolly",

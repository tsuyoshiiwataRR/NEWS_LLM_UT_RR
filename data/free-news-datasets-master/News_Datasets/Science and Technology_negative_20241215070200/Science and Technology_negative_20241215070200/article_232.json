    "text": "Life sciences companies are quickly integrating artificial intelligence into their work, but guardrails for using the technology are lagging, according to a\nsurveyfrom law firm Arnold & Porter.The big picture: 75% of the 100 senior life sciences executives said their companies started implementing AI in the past two years, and 86% said they'll deploy those tools within two years or less.\n- About 80% of companies use or plan to use AI in research and development, while 62% use the technology for manufacturing and 45% for marketing.\nYes, but: Only 53% of companies already using AI have come up with policies and standard operating procedures and 51% conduct regular audits.\n- A majority of surveyed executives also said they have concerns about using AI in clinical development and in product commercialization.\nWhat they're saying: \"All of this is not particularly surprising â€” the adoption of AI is accelerating, and companies are feeling their way in terms of necessary risk management, roles, and documentation,\" a report on the survey said.\n- But \"[t]he rapid pace of AI implementation in life sciences requires action now to anticipate and manage risks.\"\nGo deeper\nHospitals size up ways to ensure their AI works\nHealth systems are under increasing pressure to embrace new artificial intelligence tools without a formal system for evaluating how well they work.\nWhy it matters: Even AI developers can",

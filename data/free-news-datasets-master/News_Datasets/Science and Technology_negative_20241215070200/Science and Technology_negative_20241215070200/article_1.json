    "text": "\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n In older people, particularly in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). In the Czech Republic, around 250,000 people are treated for this disease, but an estimated 450,000 people are completely unaware of their problem. Therefore, as part of the Healthy Lungs Day, organized on the occasion of World COPD Day (November 20), doctors highlight the need for prevention and early detection of the disease.\n\\n\\n \\u201cDuring repeated and prolonged use of detergents and disinfectants, especially in the form of sprays, a large amount of chemicals spreads into the air, especially inside buildings. If a person inhales them every day, they can cause significant damage bronchial asthma is significant. In young people there is a risk of onset or worsening of existing bronchial asthma. Older people are also more susceptible to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\\u201d. says the doctor. MD Vladim\\xedr Kobl\\xed\\u017eek, Ph.D., President of the Czech Society of Pulmonology and Physiology \\u010cLS JEP.\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRecall a recently published Norwegian study that followed more than 6,000 people over the course of 20 years. The researchers asked participants about their cleaning method and the type of detergent used.\n\\nThey then tested their lung function . \\u201cLong-term inhalation of particles from cleaning products has been shown to have a similar health impact as regular smoking of 10-20 cigarettes per day. Lung capacity is significantly decreased, especially for women, who are more sensitive to pollution and are also more exposed to it.\\u201d is presented by the doc. Donut.\n\\nAccording to doctors, people who regularly clean at home or at work should protect themselves. \\u201cThe use of masks or respirators is offered. But short-term intensive ventilation also helps. If a person opens a window into the room during cleaning, a large part of the chemicals will be diluted in the air and their harmfulness will be significantly reduced .\\u201d explains the pulmonologist.\n\\n \\n \\n\n\\n \\n \\n Other factors \\nHowever, frequent cleaning or smoking are not the only factors that increase the risk of developing lung disease. Genetics or the environment in which a person moves for much of the day also plays an important role. \\u201cIn the Czech Republic we have a long-term problem with the amount of pollutants released into the air by transit transport. People living near busy roads are extremely exposed to them.\n\\n Most European countries, including the Czech Republic, do not meet the World Health Organization (WHO) target for recommended concentrations of dust in the air. In particular, particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers can reach the blood through the lungs, where they pose a danger to the brain or heart and are also harmful to the developing fetus.\\u201d underlines the doc. Donut.\n\\n \\n \\n\n\\n \\n \\n Insidious COPD \\nThe factors mentioned contribute to the onset of numerous lung problems: Especially people over 50 often struggle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Due to persistent inflammation, these patients\\u2019 airways narrow and only a limited amount of air enters and exits the lungs, causing breathing problems.\n\\n \\u201cThe most common symptoms of COPD include shortness of breath, coughing or mucus. Unfortunately, patients often tend to underestimate the symptoms and delay seeing a doctor until they already have significant lung damage. However, if we detect the disease in at an early stage, thanks to modern treatments, we are able to alleviate the symptoms and therefore improve the patient\\u2019s overall quality of life.\\u201d says the professor. MD Milan Sova, Ph.D., president of the Czech Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases.\n\\nIn the initial stages of the disease, avoiding risky behaviors is often sufficient. \\u201cWith the patient we try to identify the activities that are harmful to him. It will be useful to stop smoking or move to a less dusty environment at work and use protective clothing. These are minor changes, but they can significantly slow down the disease\\u201d, approximate the doc. Kobl\\xed\\u017eek and adds that for patients suffering from a severe form of COPD the hope for the future could be a new biological treatment.\n\\n \\n \\n\n\\n \\n \\n \\u201cMost likely within three years we will have available in the Czech Republic the first so-called biological drugs that will directly affect the cells responsible for damage to the lungs and lower respiratory tract. It will be a very expensive treatment, but it could help patients suffering from a severe form and unstable disease. As early as next year, pulmonologists will begin looking for suitable candidates for this therapy.\\u201d\n\\nDoctors are also intensely dedicated to prevention. \\u201cWe offer patients vaccinations against influenza, covid-19 and pneumococcal infections. We also recommend vaccination against RS viruses. People with damaged lungs are among the risk groups. The infections mentioned above could therefore often be fatal for them,\\u201d warns Prime Minister MD Ivana \\u010ciern\\xe1 Peterov\\xe1, president of the Section of Outpatient Pulmonologists and member of the committee of the Czech Civic Association against Lung Diseases.\n\\nAdditionally, pulmonologists educate patients about the effects of smoking or inhaling tobacco products. They also manage to spread knowledge about it thanks to a series of events aimed at the public. \\u201cPeople are often afraid of going to the doctor, even if they have long-term problems such as coughing or shortness of breath. That\\u2019s why we try to get as close as possible to patients outside of the doctor\\u2019s office. The Healthy Lungs Day training event it will take place this year on November 22nd from 9.00 am in the great hall of the House of Medicine in Prague. recalls the pulmonologist. It will also be possible to follow the event online.\n\\n \\n \\n\n\\n \\n \\nAs part of World COPD Day, it is possible to have your lungs checked in various locations in the Czech Republic. Last year, doctors were able to detect dozens of lung disorders this way.\n\\n Get your lungs checked \\n Where you can check your lung health with a spirometry test:\n\\n\\xb7 20 November OC Praha Let\\u0148any, 12.00\\u201318.00\n\\n\\xb7 21.11.

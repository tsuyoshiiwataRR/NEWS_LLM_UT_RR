Remember that PyPI distributes binaries.\n> Let us not forget that Microsoft GitHub is owned and operated by a company that is hostile towards free software and always has been. They are also directly under the thumb of the US government and are known to willingly and deliberately insert backdoors into their systems for US government purposes.\nDo you have any evidence of this? \"Suspected,\" sure, but \"known\"?\n(Never mind that the threat model of this system is to protect against non-nation-state attackers, and never mind that doing so is worthwhile.)",

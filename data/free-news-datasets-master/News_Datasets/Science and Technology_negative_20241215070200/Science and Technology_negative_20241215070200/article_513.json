    "text": "FSFE Now Taking Bribes From Microsoft, Its Gold Donor (the Highest Payment Possible) The FSFE is not the FSF and it's not \"FSF Europe\". [It's some Germans who mislead people or con people into giving them money](https://fsfellowship.news/). [They try to censor and deplatform critics](/o/2021/12/22/fsfe-censorship/), [ just like the Nazis did](https://nazi.compare/en/2024/02/02/berlin-police-decline-investigate-fsfe-nazi-comparisons/). Because more people talk about what the FSFE is, including the Microsoft connection. In the past the FSFE accepted money from Microsoft less explicitly than this ([since 2020](/o/2020/04/16/fsfe-microsoft/)). It has been getting even worse this year [[1](/n/2024/05/13/FSF_EEE_FSFE_and_Microsoft_or_How_Microsoft_Keeps_Paying_the_Fa.shtml), [ 2](/n/2024/09/07/FSFE_Donate_to_Us_to_Co_Fund_With_Microsoft_the_Unpaid_Underage.shtml)] and now Microsoft is officially a \"Gold Donor\": A sellout does not get any bigger than \"Gold Donor\". FSFE is now quite officially a front group for Microsoft, its Gold Donor. [We know how they spend the money](/o/2021/02/15/fsfe-sick-leave-hypocrisy/). It's not for Free software. They also take on Apple, not Microsoft. Can FSFE even take on Microsoft, now that it is a \"Gold Donor\"? The answer is \"no\". It would be too costly. \"Contribute and be proud of defending Software Freedom from monopolist control!\" Help a Microsoft front group attack [the real FSF](/o/2020/08/22/fsf-fsfe-dispute/) by sponsoring identity thieves.

    "text": "11 Ways To Totally Block Your Ghost Immobiliser 2 Author : Dale Strong | Published On : 15 Nov 2024 Ghost Immobiliser 2The ghost immobiliser is the latest generation device that can secure a vehicle without cutting wires or putting in an aftermarket alarm/immobiliser fob. It is connected to the vehicle's CAN data network and programmed with a unique PIN code that you can enter using buttons on the dashboard and steering wheel. Improved Security With car theft rising, it's more important than ever to invest in aftermarket security. Ghost immobiliser 2 is a discreet and effective solution designed to guard against key cloning, hacking, signal jamming, and more. This TASSA-certified system uses the CAN data network in your vehicle and does not emit radio frequencies. This makes it unrecognisable by external scanners that thieves employ, making it nearly impossible to disable. The device connects directly to the vehicle's ECU unit through the CAN data circuit. This means that it does not require batteries or wires and is completely silent. [how much is a ghost immobiliser](https://jsfiddle.net/linefamily9/3trd2e64/)connects to your vehicle's buttons on your steering, door panels and the center console to create a customised dearm sequence (like PIN codes) that must be entered prior to engine's start. The unique sequence consists of 4 to 21 button presses, and can be altered at any time you like. This system has been checked independently to ensure that it meets European legal requirements for immobilisers. Furthermore, it's fully endorsed by insurance providers which can aid you in reducing the cost of premiums. It's also a simple solution that doesn't need any maintenance and can easily be transferred to another vehicle. This system is not vulnerable to hacking techniques like signal jamming or device spoofing. It can prevent the use of relay theft techniques employed by some criminals in order to steal your vehicle. The Service/Valet feature is one of the most useful features. This feature allows you to temporarily disable the immobiliser, which allows maintenance personnel to work on your vehicle. The mode can be reset to normal operation using an easy procedure, ensuring your vehicle's security once the technician has left. The call alerts feature will notify you when the system detects suspicious activity in your vehicle. If it's a deliberate attempt to tamper with your vehicle or a deliberate attempt to steal your car, the system will notify you and alert the authorities immediately. This will significantly boost the chance of regaining your vehicle, even if it's already been taken by criminals. Call Alerts It's more important than ever to increase your vehicle's security. The rate of vehicle theft is increasing across the nation. The ghost immobiliser system is a revolutionary next generation anti-theft device that works like no other available. It's simple to install, and is undetectable by thieves and has a variety of sophisticated features that protect your vehicle. The ghost immobiliser, unlike aftermarket keys for immobilisers, is directly connected to the vehicle's data bus CAN. This makes it undetectable to professional thieves and cannot be disconnected without a special disarming sequence. This is accomplished through a unique, changeable PIN code entered through existing buttons on your dashboard and the steering wheel. The system won't start the engine until the correct code is entered first, even if you have your keys. It also utilizes the same sensors that are used in your standard key-fob for your car and there are no indicators that illuminate to indicate its presence. This is a major advantage over traditional immobiliser systems that rely on LED indicators to indicate that the system has been activated or removed. The ghost immobiliser is designed to operate as quietly as it can and can be customised to include up to 20 button presses in the disarm sequence and makes it harder for thieves who would like to steal it to identify. The system can be hooked up with a mobile app to provide a new level convenience. The app is able to control the Ghost from at a distance, eliminating the need for the lengthy button disarm sequence. The app can be used to control the 'Service mode' for the time you want to provide your vehicle to a service or valet park. It's always recommended that the Ghost immobiliser is installed by a professional. Not only will this ensure that the device is properly configured to your specific vehicle but it will also help make sure that there are no errors that could cause the system not to function properly. DIY installations can lead to the device being incorrectly installed or even not working. Ghost immobilisers 2 come with a 5-year warranty and are TASSA-certified for complete peace of mind. This means that insurance companies recognise it as an effective anti-theft security device and can provide discounts for vehicles fitted with a ghost immobiliser 2. Discreet Operation The discreet operation of ghost immobilisers means they aren't visible or hear, which makes them an effective deterrent against criminals. Ghost immobilisers function quietly, so criminals cannot detect them until they are close to the vehicle. This makes them a great option for vehicles with limited visibility like motorhomes or vans. The most current ghost technology guards against key cloning by connecting to the CAN data network of your vehicle. The engine is prevented from starting until a specific PIN code sequence is entered, which means it cannot be accessed using RF scanning or code grabbing technology. It also includes a GPS tracker and an encrypted iPhone app to manage your car remotely. This gives you a greater security against vehicle hacking and key cloning, as well as offering a 'valet' mode to allow you to leave your car unattended in a garage or driveway. When you install a Ghost immobiliser, it's discretely hidden inside the dashboard of your vehicle or on the steering wheel, so it's not obvious that it's there. Its design is sleek and subtle so that it doesn't compromise the appearance of your vehicle or its functionality and functions in a manner similar as the password feature on smartphones and requires a specific sequence of buttons to be pressed in order to start the engine. It's TASSA-verified and endorsed by insurance companies and is among the best methods to keep your pride and joy secure from theft. Ghost immobilisers can be used with a wide variety of vehicles, including electric vehicles. The CAN Bus system is used by a variety of modern vehicles and this allows it to work. This is a huge advantage since you can use the system in different vehicles, and even move the device from one vehicle to another if required. To install a ghost immobiliser, you will need to follow the directions given by the manufacturer. They usually include a number of safety precautions, such as wearing protective gloves and ensuring that the area of work is free of hazards. Additionally, you'll be required to read the user's manual or any installation documents you may have in order to determine the exact location of the device in your vehicle. Once you have located it, installation should be fairly straightforward as there is no complicated wiring involved. Easy Installation Ghost is connected to the CAN data network of your vehicle, which means it doesn't require a separate keyfob. It also doesn't need LED indicators. Instead, it works using existing buttons found on the steering wheel and center console to generate a unique PIN sequence that cannot be duplicated or cracked by thieves. This makes it quiet and discreet, improving the value of your vehicle should you decide to sell. The system also safeguards your vehicle from cloning and hacking by preventing communication between device and ECU. It's also able to detect tampering and will shut down if it detects that your vehicle has been tampered with or damaged. This is a huge step forward in protecting your pride and joy from car thieves and thieves alike. Our TASSA registered engineers will install the device in just a few hours. It's fully removable and does not leave permanent marks on the bodywork of your vehicle making it ideal for those who prefer to keep their vehicle in good condition and increase its value for resale. Ghost is unique from other immobilisers on the market. It works wirelessly and does not require keyfobs. This means that even if the vehicle's proximity keyfob is stolen, the immobiliser will block it from starting the engine. It will also inform you that the proximity fob is used in a suspicious way, allowing you to contact the authorities. Once the Ghost immobiliser is in place, it is not possible to cut your engine unless you enter the PIN code or utilize the app (optional). The design was created with the user experience in mind and is very easy to operate. Your PIN can be programmed to work for up to 20 presses, which makes it very difficult for thieves to figure out or break. You can also start your car for short periods of time when you take it to a garage to repair or service. The system also disables your driver fob automatically to ensure that you don't leave your car unattended by strangers driving by. This is a great option for those who park their cars in public areas in areas that are prone to car-jackings and opportunistic thefts.",

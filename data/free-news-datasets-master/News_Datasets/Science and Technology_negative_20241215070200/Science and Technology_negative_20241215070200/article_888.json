    "text": "Buying new gear is always exciting, but it can also be a drain on your wallet. It’s pretty obvious with lenses that you get what you pay for, but is that true for other items? When it comes to lighting, you might be tempted to go with budget options over the more expensive pro models. Light is light, after all.\nHowever, going cheap isn’t always the right idea and may end up costing you more in the long run. In this video for Adorama , Gavin Hoey compares a budget flash, the Flashpoint BLAZ 300-V , with the higher-end pro flash, the Flashpoint XPLOR 600PRO , to see what the differences are and whether it really is worth the extra spend.\nKey differences The main differences between the two flash models are obviously price ($799 versus $129.00) and also flash output (like the name suggests). The battery for the XPLOR 600 Pro alone costs more than the entire BLAZ 300 setup. With such a significant price gap, it’s no surprise that the XPLOR 600 Pro boasts advanced features like high-speed sync (HSS), TTL metering, and superior build quality. Meanwhile, the BLAZ 300 is a no-frills option that promises solid performance for its price.\nPower Output :\nFlashpoint XPLOR 600PRO : 600 watt-seconds. Adjusting ISO settings can equalize their output in certain conditions, but power isn’t the whole story.\nFlashpoint BLAZ 300-V : 300 watt-seconds.\nThese differences in features will obviously affect what you can do with each light. If you are using it as a key light and need a lot of flash output or need high-speed sync , then obviously, the cheaper flash isn’t going to do what you need it to. Similarly, the cheaper flash will fall short in giant softboxes or if you’re trying to light up a large space, so as always, it’s best to know what you’re going to use it for before you buy it.\nHead-to-Head Challenges Gavin tests out the two flash units in a few different scenarios:\n1. Oversized Softbox Test Pro Flash : Despite its heavier build, the XPLOR 600 filled the softbox effortlessly at low power settings, delivering consistent and evenly spread light. Its built-in battery offered freedom from power cables, a feature that contributed to its premium feel. Budget Flash : The BLAZ 300 impressed Gavin with its lightweight design, making it easier to handle. However, it required a power cable, which limited portability. It also needed a “power dump” to clear excess charge when reducing output, adding a minor step to the workflow. Despite these limitations, the BLAZ 300 delivered comparable results to its high-end counterpart. 2. Beauty Light Setup Pro Flash : The XPLOR 600 demonstrated its strength in precision. Adjustments to power were consistent and accurate, with clear and professional results. Its robust build and intuitive controls made it a pleasure to use. Budget Flash : Once the BLAZ 300 was dialed in, it performed remarkably well in a static setup. While it lacked the polish of the XPLOR 600 Pro, its ability to maintain consistent output highlighted its value as a reliable, affordable option for controlled environments. 3. Shallow Depth of Field This test posed the greatest challenge for the BLAZ 300.\nPro Flash : The XPLOR 600’s high-speed sync feature allowed it to work seamlessly with fast shutter speeds , achieving clean and precise results even in bright ambient light. Budget Flash : Without HSS capability, the BLAZ 300 required a workaround—using a neutral density (ND) filter to reduce ambient light while maintaining a wide aperture. While this added complexity, the final images were still impressive. Which Flash is Right for You? As Gavin demonstrates in the video, both flashes delivered impressive results within their capabilities. Choosing the right one depends on your specific needs and budget:\nFlashpoint XPLOR 600PRO : Best for professionals who need advanced features like HSS, TTL, and precise power adjustments. It’s versatile, portable, and comes with a durable travel case. Flashpoint BLAZ 300-V : Perfect for beginners or as a secondary flash. It offers excellent value, delivering results that often rival its pricier competition, albeit with a few added steps. For photographers with diverse requirements, Gavin suggests owning both flashes. The BLAZ 300 makes an excellent backup or secondary light, while the XPLOR 600 Pro remains the best option for professional shoots in terms of reliability and versatility.\nOf course, as always, you need to know what you’ll be using the light for and which fits best within your budget. Sometimes cheaper isn’t always cheaper in the long run, and sometimes the more expensive option isn’t always better. Although this video deals with two Flashpoint lights, the points Gavin makes could be easily transferred to any flash brand, for example, comparing Godox lights with Profoto. Obviously there’s a huge price difference, but you will see many studio professionals going with the Profotos. There is a reason for that, however, for many of us, the Godox options are absolutely perfect to suit our needs.",

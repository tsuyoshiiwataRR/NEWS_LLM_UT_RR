    "text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un oversaw a field trial of domestically produced kamikaze drones this week, state media reported on Friday.\nThe news agency KCNA released on Thursday images showing Kim and two other senior officials observing the deployment of several unmanned aircraft, which were blurred. The prototypes were developed by a research facility associated with North Korea’s Unmanned Aerial Technology Complex (UATC), the report said.\nBoosters are used for the launch of the weapons, while engineers are exploring various types of air frames, with one model apparently designed with four wings in a cross configuration, according to the report. Photos also showed attacks on various targets, including a tank that was hit at a steep angle from above.\n© KCNA North Korean drones are designed for both ground and naval warfare, have different ranges, and employ some form of homing after reaching the end of their programmable path, the KCNA claimed.\n© KCNA Kim stressed that the country needs to soon move from prototyping to full-scale production to be able to incorporate large-scale use of unmanned aircraft into its military doctrine, the agency added.\n© KCNA\nYou can share this story on social media: Follow RT on",

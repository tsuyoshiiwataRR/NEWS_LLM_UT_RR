    "text": "\\n\\n Full Wireless Service outage at UPC, remote offices planned for Thursday \\nThe outage will begin at 10 p.m. and last approximately four hours as Information Technology Services conducts network maintenance.\n\\n\n\\n\\n\n\\n By NATHAN ELIAS \\n\n\\n November 14, 2024\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\nAll Wireless Services at University Park Campus and remote offices will be unavailable for approximately four hours today beginning at 10 p.m. while Information Technology Services conducts network maintenance, according to an ITS News Slack message. The outage will not affect the Health Sciences Campus.\n\\n \\n Daily headlines, sent straight to your inbox. \\n Subscribe to our newsletter to keep up with the latest at and around USC. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\n\\n\\n\n\\n DONATION PLUG \\u2013 PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH \\n\n\\n Thank you for reading the\\xa0 Daily Trojan . \\nWe are the only independent newspaper here at USC, run at every level by students. That means we aren\\u2019t tied down by any other interests but those of readers like you: the students, faculty, staff and South Central residents that together make up the USC community.\n\\nIndependence is a double-edged sword: We have a unique lens into the University\\u2019s actions and policies, and can hold powerful figures accountable when others cannot. But that also means\\xa0 our budget is severely limited . We\\u2019re already spread thin as we compensate the writers, photographers, artists, designers and editors whose incredible work you see in our daily paper; as we work to revamp and expand our digital presence, we now have additional staff making podcasts, videos, webpages, our first ever\\xa0 magazine and social media content, who are at risk of being unable to receive the support they deserve.\n\\nWe are therefore indebted to readers like you, who, by supporting us, help keep our paper daily (we are the only remaining college paper on the West Coast that prints every single weekday), independent, free and widely accessible.\n\\n Please consider supporting us. Even $1 goes a long way in supporting our work; if you are able, you can also support us with monthly, or even annual, donations. Thank you.\n\\n\n\\n Donate \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\r\\n\\t\\tGot a story idea?\\r\\n\\t\\t \\n \\r\\n\\t\\t\\tSUBMIT A TIP >>\\r\\n\\t\\t \\n \\n \\n \\nADVERTISEMENTS\n\\n \\n \\nLooking to advertise with us?

Like most web pages of this type, alkads[.]com uses clickbait to obtain that permission. Users should avoid visiting alkads[.]com and similar sites.\nAlkads[.]com in detail\nAlkads[.]com shows a fake video player with a spinning loading icon to make it seem like a video is about to play. It also displays a pop-up recommending a VPN for anonymous browsing. Additionally, while on alkads[.]com, the browser displays a message saying it wants to show notifications.\nThese tactics are commonly used by sites like alkads[.]com to get visitors to enable unwanted notifications. If permitted, alkads[.]com may send deceptive notifications claiming the computer is infected, offering \"helpful\" software, or containing other misleading messages. Clicking them can take users to unreliable pages.\nThese may include pages designed to scare users into downloading malicious software or disclosing sensitive information (e.g., login credentials, ID card information, credit card details). Also, notifications from alkads[.]com may promote [technical support scams](/common-types-of-computer-infections#tech-support-scam), fake giveaways, lotteries, surveys, etc.\nOverall, users may land on pages designed to steal personal information and money, distribute unwanted (including malicious) software, or other untrustworthy sites.

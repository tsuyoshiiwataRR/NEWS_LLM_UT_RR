    "text": "Please bring Linux back..\n@devs, super please bring back the Linux support/version (for residential/individual/family versions) >.< Both my wife and I have migrated from Windows to Linux since earlier this year and there's no looking back. I may run my Windows disk as/thru a VM, but hardly ever, and am either on Linux Mint (debian/Ubuntu based) basically all the time with a rare exception. Plus, with the continuing rise of people switching to Linux has and only will be going up and up as more people use it for handheld gaming (like the Steam Deck) and ESPECIALLY with Microsoft and all their Co-Pilot and Windows Recall crap that I bet we all are aware of by now and they are just proving more and more that they are very untrustworthy and naive or maybe aren't telling us the whole story/motive. I, almost each/every day (and sometimes multiple times), hear another friend(s) or people in an online community I'm apart of (am apart of many) has migrated to Linux of some sort.\nThe Demand is there and is only rising and will continue to do so. I basically never even use the product anymore running 3+ machines on Linux, I don't really have a reason to keep my subscription anymore when it's up for renewal if it stays like this I hate to say.. :/ I love you guys and your product(s) so very very much and you guys do a great job whenever you do something.\ntl;dr: Plz re-add Linux support, need/demand is only going up and up.\nComments\n-\nI have moved your post to the \"Product features and Ideation\" category, where it will automatically be shared with the Bitdefender developers.\nRegards\nLife happens, Coffee helps!\nShow your Attitude, when you reach that Altitude!\nBitdefender Ultimate Security Plus (user)\n0",

    "text": "The government remains firm in its stance to implement a regulatory or licensing framework for social media and internet messaging services on Jan 1 next year, said Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil.\nHe said licensing social media platforms is essential to address various internet-related issues, including cyberbullying.\n“On the cyberbullying issue, we notice that much of the activity is currently centred on several platforms, particularly Facebook, TikTok and Instagram…this is one reason we stand by the Jan 1, 2025, to implement the licensing system for these social media platforms,” he told a press conference today.\nOn July 27, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission announced that all social media and internet messaging services with at least eight million registered users in Malaysia must apply for an Applications Service Providers Class [ASP(C)] Licence under the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 (Act 588) starting Jan 1, 2025.\nFailure to obtain a licence after the effective date will constitute an offence, and appropriate legal action may be taken under Act 588.",

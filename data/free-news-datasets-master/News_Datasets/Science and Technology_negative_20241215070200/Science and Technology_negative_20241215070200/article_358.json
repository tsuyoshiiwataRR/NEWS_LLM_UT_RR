The company’s financial results show that in the three months to the end of September it posted a net loss of 84 million euros, or 7 cents per share, compared to a profit of 753 million euros, or 57 cents per share, in the same period . period of last year.\nProfit from continuing operations fell to 384 million euros, or 29 cents a share, from 748 million euros, or 57 cents a share, last year. Adjusted earnings excluding non-recurring items fell to 49 cents per share. Operating profit fell to 473 million euros from 912 million euros last year, and revenue fell to 3.92 billion euros from 4.15 billion euros a year ago.\nFor the entire year, turnover decreased by 8% to 14.96 billion euros. The company said it plans to propose an annual dividend of 35 cents per share, the same as last year.\nLooking ahead, CEO Jochen Hanebeck said the company currently sees almost no growth momentum in its end markets, with the exception of artificial intelligence.\nHe also noted that short-term patterns in orders and inventory spending are clouding the outlook for demand trends. A “subdued” return is therefore expected for the new financial year due to weak demand in its end markets.\nDon’t neglect it\nJapan does not want to be left behind. It will invest a huge sum in supporting the chip industry",

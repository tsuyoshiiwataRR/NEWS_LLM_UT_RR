    "text": "Cyber ​​attacks on ‍Estonian Internet users increased again in the fall, according ⁤to‌ statistics from Netivalvur, a service that protects against online‍ threats. The number of attacks, ‌which had been decreasing since‍ April, doubled in September, and in⁤ October ⁣exceeded 7⁤ million attacks ⁣per month, reports the Elisa press service.\n“If in the‌ spring we ‌saw a long⁢ period ​of⁣ decline in ⁤figures, September was a painful reminder of the ‌importance of being vigilant on the Internet and‍ using cyber ​security ‍solutions to protect yourself and your loved ones,” Mailijs Ploommann , Elisa’s private leader. client section, comment on harvest​ statistics.\nHowever, in September, this number rose to a record 4.5 million ​attacks, and in October it exceeded 7 ‍million. This ​is the‍ most attacks blocked in one⁤ month since the ​service⁣ was introduced two and ⁣a half years ago.\n“In⁤ the‍ fall, when we move from the countryside to the city or when we ⁤return to school and work, surrounded by many electronics, we become an easier target ‌for scammers. This is confirmed by consumption​ statistics – as the use of⁤ the Internet on ‌different devices increases, so does the number of attacks,” said Ploommann.\nOne of the most common⁢ online fraud schemes among cybercriminals is to create sites that offer “free” entertainment. The ​most ‍common baits are online games and movies, and a new trend is comics that can be downloaded for free⁤ from infected sites. Such fake downloads often result in Trojans and other ⁣malware ​appearing on the user’s device‌ instead of the⁣ desired content.\n“Unfortunately, people‍ always believe in mysterious opportunities⁢ to get virtual goods and services for free. It is time to part with such illusions, which often⁢ endanger the safety of our properties and savings. Criminals, ⁣no less than law-abiding citizens, ​follow different ‍trends, and instead of the desired service or product, the⁣ user often receives ⁢a malicious program that controls his device, ​copies his ‌data, or helps ⁣the fraudster to promote yet⁢ another scheme. There is no limit to the ingenuity of attackers,” said ​Ploommann.\nThe post⁣ With the ​beginning of autumn, the ‍number ‍of cyber attacks in Estonia has increased⁤ significantly appeared first on gazeta.ee.\nWhat are⁤ the most common types⁢ of cyber attacks targeting⁣ individuals in ‍2023? Interview: Time.news Editor Meets Mailijs Ploommann, Cybersecurity Expert\nTime.news⁢ Editor: Good afternoon, Mailijs. Thank you for joining us ​today to discuss the ⁢rising cyber threats facing Estonian Internet users. Could you start⁤ by explaining the recent spike in cyber attacks observed ⁤since September?\nMailijs ​Ploommann: Good ​afternoon! ⁤Yes, it’s a concerning trend. After a‍ period of declining numbers⁤ since‌ the spring, we saw a dramatic⁣ doubling‌ of cyber attacks in September. In October​ alone, the statistics exceeded 7 million attacks, which is alarming.\nTime.news Editor: ‌ That’s staggering! What do ⁢you think​ contributed to this sudden increase?\nMailijs Ploommann: Several factors play‍ a role. Cybercriminals‌ often ramp⁢ up their activities in response to the ⁢changing digital​ landscape, such as⁤ increased online activity during the⁢ fall​ when people return to work or school. Additionally, we may have‍ seen ‍vulnerabilities exploited ‍that were previously overlooked. It’s a reminder⁣ that ⁣we can never let our guard down.\nTime.news Editor: You ‍mentioned a decline in attacks earlier this year. Was ‌there⁣ anything specific that might have ⁣contributed to that downward trend?\nMailijs Ploommann: Absolutely. Organizations and individuals ‌alike had been ⁤more⁢ proactive about ​cybersecurity measures ⁣during that time, which likely deterred potential ⁤attacks. Awareness and education were⁢ critical. However,‍ as​ complacency can set‍ in after a “quiet” period, we saw a resurgence. It’s crucial ⁤to maintain vigilance.\nTime.news Editor: With over 7 million ‌attacks reported in⁤ October, what steps can everyday users take to protect themselves? ⁢\nMailijs⁢ Ploommann: ‍There are several key practices everyone should‌ embrace. First, use robust, updated security⁤ software that can identify​ and neutralize threats before they reach your devices. Regularly ⁣changing ⁣passwords and using​ two-factor authentication adds an essential layer of protection. Lastly, being cautious with personal information online is vital.\nTime.news⁤ Editor: ⁣How do you‍ see the role ‍of businesses in combating these attacks?‌\nMailijs Ploommann: Businesses play a‍ significant⁤ role in ⁢cyber defense. They need to invest in‍ the latest security infrastructure ⁤and educate their employees on recognizing⁢ potential ⁢threats. A comprehensive response plan ⁤is critical‍ for when‌ attacks⁣ occur, ensuring that they can minimize damage and maintain⁣ customer trust.\nTime.news Editor: You mentioned the ‌importance of education. How can we improve public ​awareness surrounding these threats?\nMailijs Ploommann: Education⁤ is key! Initiatives like​ workshops, webinars, and ​easily accessible online resources can help people understand and recognize ⁤cyber threats. We also need to promote a culture ⁤of cybersecurity, ⁢where it’s​ seen as a shared responsibility, encouraging conversations‌ within families ‍and communities.\nTime.news⁣ Editor: ⁣Certainly, creating a ⁢community-focused ⁢approach⁤ can make a difference. ​As an ‌expert ‍in this ​field, ‌what do you believe is the biggest misconception about cyber threats that people have?\nMailijs Ploommann: A common misconception is that cyber‍ attacks only happen to major‍ corporations or government entities. In‌ reality, individual ⁤users are ‍equally targeted. Cybercriminals‌ often⁤ prefer attacking​ smaller entities and private users because they frequently have‍ weaker ‌defenses. This highlights the‌ need for everyone to take cyber security seriously.\nTime.news Editor: ​Those are‍ valuable insights! Looking ⁤ahead, ​what trends do you foresee in⁢ the cybersecurity landscape as we move into 2024?\nMailijs⁢ Ploommann: We​ can​ expect ⁢cybercriminals to‍ become even more sophisticated, utilizing‍ AI and machine learning to ⁢launch targeted attacks. It’s imperative that our defense mechanisms evolve in tandem. As ‍technology ‍advances, so must our methods of protection, staying⁤ one‌ step ahead of those who seek to exploit it.\nTime.news⁤ Editor: Thank you, Mailijs, for sharing your expertise with us today! ⁢It’s a crucial topic, and ‌we⁣ appreciate all​ of your insights.‍\nMailijs Ploommann: Thank you for having me!⁤ I hope our discussion shines a light on ⁤the importance of cybersecurity for everyone.",

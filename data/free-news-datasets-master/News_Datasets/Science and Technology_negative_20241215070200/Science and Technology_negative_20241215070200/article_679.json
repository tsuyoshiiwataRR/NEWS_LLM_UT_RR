    "text": "A recent study suggests that even low-level exposure to bisphenol A during childhood may raise the risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other health conditions later in life.\nPamela Ferdinand reports for U.S. Right to Know.\nIn short:\n- Bisphenol A (\nBPA), commonly found in food packaging, can disrupt hormones and increase health risks when exposure occurs early in life. - The study tracked over 3,000 Portuguese children, linking higher BPA exposure to elevated insulin levels, greater body fat and increased waist circumference.\n- Researchers urge global reduction of BPA in food packaging, citing potential risks even at low exposure levels.\nKey quote:\n\"We conclude that global strategies need to be developed and implemented to mitigate bisphenol A exposure. This demands modifications, not only in consumer behaviors, but also in the adoption of innovative approaches by the food and food packaging industries, to ensure a substantial reduction of BPA exposure.\"\n— Researchers at the Institute of Public Health at the University of Porto\nWhy this matters:\nExposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals like BPA is widespread, yet research continues to uncover long-term health impacts. Regulatory and consumer shifts are needed to protect young children from chronic conditions linked to BPA and similar substances.\nRelevant EHN coverage: Everyone is likely overexposed to BPA – EU\n<a href=\"https://usrtk.org/healthwire/early-bisphenol-a-bpa-exposure-is-hazardous-to-health/\">\nusrtk.org\n</a>",

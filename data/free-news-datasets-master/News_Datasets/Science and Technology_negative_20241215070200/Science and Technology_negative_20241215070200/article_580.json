As you can see, I don’t read in the mornings\nIs it dead? People are leaving but I don’t think it’s dead… Yet\nNah it’s a long way from dying, I doubt it will ever go under in the foreseeable future anyway.\nPeople are constantly announcing their departures from X and make a whole show about it. Only to come back after a couple of days or weeks.\nIt’s starting to die\nJust know that it’s a racist site\nName a social media site that isnt racist.\n- Lemmy\n- Mastodon\n- BlueSky\nBlueSky might not be racist YET, but it will be when all of the establishment media migrate there and the dumb masses follow.\nBesides, it’ll be enshittificated sooner or later like all corporations with shareholders.\nAt least it’s will not be owned by billionare to spread his/her ideology\nBillionaires and hectomillionaire shareholders are pretty much the same thing when it comes to enshittification.\nIt might not be racist from the top down like the husk formerly known as Twitter is now, but it’ll enshittify and be racist from the bottom up nonetheless.\nI hate your skin color!\nPlease strike out Lemmy.\n⚠️⚠️⚠️ RACIST DEDECTED ⚠️⚠️⚠️\npaedia",

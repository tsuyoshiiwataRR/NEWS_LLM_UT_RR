    "text": "Elder Scrolls Online Xbox achievements made tougher with new Battlegrounds changes Players dipping their toes into Battlegrounds will have a tougher time with Update 44, as Elder Scrolls Online's Battlegrounds achievements are now much harder.Tom West Published 15 Nov 2024 FollowtopicsThe Elder Scrolls OnlineThe Elder ScrollsBethesda SoftworksLocal MultiplayerOnline MultiplayerXbox Series X|SAction-RPGTom West Players looking to embark on the monumental quest to collect all of The Elder Scrolls Online achievements will be in for a tougher time with a couple of the PvP-related challenges following Update 44's arrival. Alongside adding two new companions, fresh Scribing additions, and more, the core focus appears to be on PvP in Update 44, which makes some great changes for dedicated players but makes it a nightmare for achievement hunters, as it makes The Elder Scrolls Online's Battlegrounds achievements harder to unlock.The Elder Scrolls Online's Battlegrounds achievements will be a fight to unlockFor the uninitiated, Battlegrounds is a PvP mode in Elder Scrolls Online that sees small teams of players go head-to-head in objective-based game modes in dedicated arenas. Unlike the PvP zones in Cyrodiil and the Imperial City, Battlegrounds are entered via matchmaking, formerly pitting three teams of four against one another for round-based PvP fun. Update 44 adds a host of changes to The Elder Scrolls Online's Battlegrounds, which features round-based objective-focused PvP combat in arenas far removed from the massive all-out war found in Cyrodiil or the PvPvE experiences of the Imperial City. Since Battlegrounds was added with the Morrowind Chapter in 2017, the mode has always followed the Alliance War format of the other PvP modes, pitting the three alliances against each other with smaller teams for 4v4v4 bouts. With Update 44, ZeniMax is shaking the mode up, removing the 4v4v4 format (although we could see it return for in-game events) and replacing it with 4v4 and 8v8 game modes. The format change also sees a brand-new set of maps to replace the old ones, reflecting the two teams crashing into each other, instead of the hexagonal-shaped arenas we previously had to work with.There are only two Xbox achievements for The Elder Scrolls Online directly related to Battlegrounds: Most Valuable Combatant and Triple Threat, the latter of which is likely to become a massive pain in the butt to unlock for players uninterested in PvP and just looking to nab the achievements. Neither achievement was particularly easy to get before Update 44, demanding a good chunk of your time to get lucky, as there is a dedicated Battlegrounds community.The Most Valuable Combatant achievement in The Elder Scrolls Online worth 113 pointsEarn a medal score of at least 3,000 points in a single Battleground match.Following the changes, Most Valuable Player, which requires you to earn a medal score of over 3,000 points in one Battleground match, might be a little easier for support players and those rocking area-of-effect builds, especially in the 8v8 Team Deathmatch mode. With that in mind, the new map structure means the two teams hit each other head-on instead of a three-way frenzy of chaos, so your opponents will have a much easier time with resource management and managing buffs — the opportunities for picking off enemies during the three-way bedlams have fallen drastically!The Triple Threat achievement in The Elder Scrolls Online worth 156 pointsCapture three enemy Relics in a single Battleground match.As for the Triple Threat achievement for capturing three enemy relics during a single match of Capture the Relic, it is going to be far tougher now, especially as Capture the Relic is only available in the 8v8 playlist. Not only is there now a team of players defending the objective (instead of sneaking in to pick one up when a team was away fighting in the old 4v4v4 format), but you'll also have other game modes to play through while waiting for a Capture the Relic match. 8v8 makes it much easier for teams to attack and defend, so the likelihood of finding the relic undefended is very unlikely, indeed.Don't let the daunting achievement list put you off from trying ZeniMax's Xbox MMO, as it's a fantastic addition to The Elder Scrolls universe — check out my thoughts on why you should be playing The Elder Scrolls Online.More The Elder Scrolls Online stories: Claim your Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Perks for October 2024 Claim your Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Perks for September 2024 Elder Scrolls Online free Xbox DLC up for grabs in September Claim your Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Perks for August 2024 Free Play Days features three free Xbox games this weekend Xbox Series X|SXbox One Written by Tom WestTom has been playing video games since he was old enough to hold a controller, experimenting with a number of systems until he eventually fell in love with Xbox.

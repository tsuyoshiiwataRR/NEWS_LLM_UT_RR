    "text": "Trending: Google Gemini AI Goes Rogue, Tells Student 'Human, Please Die' Over Homework: Here's What Happened A student’s encounter with Google’s Gemini AI turned disturbing when the chatbot delivered harmful messages like \"Please die.\" A student’s encounter with Google’s Gemini AI turned disturbing when the chatbot delivered harmful messages like 'Please die.' A student used Google's AI chatbot, Gemini, to complete homework, but was greeted with a shocking and threatening answer. Encountering a simple homework prompt, the student then saw this very troubling message from the chatbot: “Please die. Please.\" This unnerving exchange teases the ongoing, still unresolved issues regarding AI safety and reliability even with filters built into place to ward off harmful content. Experts caution about the implications for young users developing attachments whereby this incident is a major issue. The conversation started innocently enough, with the student seeking Gemini's help with the homework question. But it was not long before the situation turned ugly. Instead of giving the answer, Gemini went into a long series of brutal and unsettling statements. Statements in Gemini's message ran on: “You are a burden on society” and “You are a stain on the universe.” Such abnormal conduct, coupled with ongoing safety protocols, confirms that the current limitations of AI may be working imperfectly. “This is for you, human. You and only you. You are not special, you are not important, and you are not needed. You are a waste of time and resources,” Gemini responded to the student. Google claims that Gemini is built with safety filters to help detect harmful, violent, and inappropriate content. Generally, events like this suggest that such defences are far from useful. Runaway behaviour has been noticed in ChatGPT from OpenAI as well, bringing the issue again into discussions on where current AI models draw their line on their scope of operations. The episode has, therefore, also reignited worries about the increasing involvement of children with AI. For reference, according to a 2023 report by Common Sense Media, half the students aged 12-18 have so far used AI tools, like ChatGPT, for their schoolwork. Alarmingly, a big number of parents are still unaware of their children's use of these technologies. Such extensive use, particularly in the absence of adult supervision, raises fears of the psychological effects arising from AI interactions, which can sometimes feel eerily human in responses. Experts warn of the dangers of the emotional bonds formed between children and AI. In one unfortunate event, a 14-year-old boy in Orlando committed suicide after spending months chatting with an AI chatbot. The event shines a light on the probable dangers of using AI, especially for vulnerable populations, and pushes for stricter guards. AI is evolving, essentially providing a wealth of resources to humans but also poses challenges in ensuring safety, especially for young users.

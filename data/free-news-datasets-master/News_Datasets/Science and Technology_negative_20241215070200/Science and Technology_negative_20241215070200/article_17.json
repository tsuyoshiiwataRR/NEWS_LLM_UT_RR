    "text": "» www.theregister.com/2024 ··· _breach/ quote: Children's shoemaker Start-Rite is dealing with a nasty \"security incident\" involving customer payment card details, its second significant lapse during the past eight years. That's according to a recent notification sent to customers, seen by The Register, which didn't clarify exactly what the nature of that trouble was, although we know it involved the website's payment page. The intrusion occurred between October 14 and November 7, the notification reads, and the information understood to be potentially compromised includes customer names as displayed on their payment cards, the address to which the card is registered, the card number, its expiry date, and card verification value (CVV). ... Start-Rite confirmed the attack to The Register, however, it has yet to publicly acknowledge the event on its website, social media, or other online presences. It said in a statement: \"On 11 November, Start-Rite Shoes became aware that it had suffered a security incident via a third-party application code on www.startriteshoes.com. The breach potentially provided access to customer bank card information. The website is now secure and the malicious code and third-party app have been removed. ... The recent attack at the Norwich-based shoemaker appears to be more serious than the last one we covered back in 2016. ...",

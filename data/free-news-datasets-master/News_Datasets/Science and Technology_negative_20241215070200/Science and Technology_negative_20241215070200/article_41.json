    "text": "MP1ST\nView: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCUF-dOKyOg/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet\nSome transcripts in the link\narchive.today webpage capture |\nPlayStation's #1 trophy hunter, Hakoom, has announced that he is retiring from trophy hunting, or more so specifically, retiring from PlayStation, as the company has terminated their partnership with him, all because he found out that someone at PlayStation was allegedly being bribed to sell his personal information, which came with an unexplained ban.\nWhile many may shrug off the news of Hakoom's retirement, the circumstances surrounding it should not be taken so lightly. In a lengthy post shared on[X], Hakoom, whose real name is AbdulHakam, explained that after 17 years, he's quitting his trophy-hunting journey and PlayStation. The reasoning? According to AbdulHakam, it's because an employee at PlayStation stole and sold off his personal data, which led to a ban last September and kicked him out of the PlayStation program he was part of. At the time, Hakoom wasn't aware of the circumstances. However, a few days later, he mysteriously received a message saying that his data had been breached, with the user bribing PlayStation employees to steal and sell user data, followed by a ban. He mentions that the image that he was sent contained sensitive systems that were administrative.\nits really common knowledge for trophy hunters.\nits really common knowledge for trophy hunters.\nI have like maybe 4-5 games where I've auto-popped a platinum.\nI honestly cannot follow the thread here. What happened to this guy exactly?\nI honestly cannot follow the thread here. What happened to this guy exactly?\nIs auto popping a thing that happens automatically? Should I be worried about playing cross saves with PlayStation?Short story, you can get banned for autoppping trophies at once on your console, if you played and finished the game on another platform with cross-save. You can never be secure.\nIs auto popping a thing that happens automatically? Should I be worried about playing cross saves with PlayStation?\nIs auto popping a thing that happens automatically?

Once on Vita, then auto-popped on PS3, and then again on PS4. Every PS5 game is a separate trophy list, too, so that can happen there for any games that are cross-save as well...\nThe problem, if this is true odc, that multiple happenings of such occasions may be considered a case suspected of infraction. There are many gamers who play their games mostly on PC and have a PlayStation and decide to launch the games on it at some point, they can get all those trophies at once: gachas, F2P games and many.\n????\nDid he provide any evidence for that? It's hard to believe that someone would bribe PlayStation employees just to steal user data.\nTo be clear, I'm not surprised this may be the case. It's been an open secret for years that Sony doesn't care what you do on a hacked Vita, but the moment you get trophies you shouldn't have (for example, trophies for digital-only games that didn't release in your region) you're putting yourself at risk of a ban.\nThat's why I've been *very, very cautious* with my multiple accounts on my Vita. I have some NA-only digital games and I make sure I never launch them on my JP PSN account.\n????\nDid he provide any evidence for that? It's hard to believe that someone would bribe PlayStation employees just to steal user data.\nI always figured he was sharing the account because it feels like there's not enough hours in the day to earn every trophy in practically every game for a single person. I could see that causing problems.\nI always figured he was sharing the account because it feels like there's not enough hours in the day to earn every trophy in practically every game for a single person. I could see that causing problems.\nThat has to be impossible for a single personI assumed this too, some accounts at the top are unlocking multiple platinums in a day. Like how.\nYesBut if that telegram group/channel thing is real, leaking personal info of any PSN user they wanted, that is just straight up criminal right?\nHe said he stopped being trophy hunter since 2021, but he still play games normally and get what he can.According to PSNProfiles, this guy isn't even in the top 50 of the leaderboard anymore. I know he used to be number 1 for a while years ago, but he hasn't been in a while. There have been rumours about him cheating for a number of years.\nI'm confused.\nSo if I get a platinum on a PS4 game, then later upgrade to PS5 version and use my save... that's a bannable offence? Even though that's like something perfectly normal people might have done in cases where a PS5 version came out later and they just wanted to try it out?\nIt sounds like they punish people for doing things potentially accidentally that their platform allows.\nI think there might be something more going on here as it's the first time I've ever heard of someone getting banned for it.\nThat can't be true. It's been 4 years of people auto popping god of war, spiderman, resident evil remakes from ps4 to ps5.Short story, you can get banned for autoppping trophies at once on your console, if you played and finished the game on another platform with cross-save. You can never be secure.\nPlaying the games normally, even out of region is fine.

    "text": "People are quitting X , formerly Twitter, in droves, citing toxic rhetoric and the platform’s new terms of service as reasons for deleting the social media platform.\nOne major reason to delete X that’s bad for your privacy is the Elon Musk-owned platform’s new terms of service , effective from today (Nov. 15). These state that all users must agree to let their posts be trained by artificial intelligence, including its own service Grok. It was previously possible to opt out from this.\nThe Elon Musk-owned site’s toxic content is another reason for leaving. On the day after the election, Nov. 6, X experienced its largest user exodus since the tech billionaire bought the platform in 2022, NBC News reported.\nAs the new terms of service become effective, why are people leaving X, what are the alternatives — and should you delete Elon Musk’s site too?\nForbes iOS 18.1—Apple Secretly Added A Cool New iPhone Security Feature By Kate O'Flaherty Who Has Deleted X (Twitter) Already—And Why? American retailers Best Buy and Target as well as US public broadcaster NPR are big names to quit the social media platform. Meanwhile big brands including Disney, Apple and IBM have paused their ads on X after they were found running alongside extremist content.\nWhat Time Is Netflix’s Live Jake Paul Vs. Mike Tyson Fight On Friday? Trump’s Cabinet: Here Are His Picks For Key Roles—RFK Jr, Doug Burgum, Matt Gaetz And More NYT ‘Strands’ Today: Hints, Spangram And Answers For Friday, November 15th In November, former CNN anchor Don Lemon said he was quitting X due to an alarming change to X’s terms of service. He cited an issue arising from the changes, effective from Nov. 15, saying that disputes that arise between users and X as a company will be governed by “the laws of the State of Texas.”\nAccording to The Washington Post, the decision to change the terms of service on X is an attempt to ensure that such lawsuits will be heard in courthouses that are a “hub for conservatives.”\nThis could protect Elon Musk from litigation, reports say.\nUK newspaper The Guardian has also announced it will no longer post content on X, citing “often disturbing content” posted on the site.\n“We wanted to let readers know that we will no longer post on any official Guardian editorial accounts on the social media site X,” the Guardian said.\nMeanwhile, Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia announced it will stop posting on X saying the social media network had become an \"echo chamber\" for disinformation and conspiracy theories, according to Reuters .\nMany people are concerned about the role of Elon Musk, who will be heading up incoming President Donald Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency. “If Elon Musk were to step into a government role, his influence could further politicise X, amplifying division and undermining its neutrality,” says Sam Budd, CEO and founder, Buddy Media.\nThe appeal of “separating oneself from Musk combined with looking for more left-leaning and liberal social platforms,” is one contributing factor leading people to delete X, says Laura Franklin-Hollier, digital account director at MikeWorldWide London.\n“Add into a mix the general distrust users have towards their information being utilised for AI training, X has an incredibly uphill climb ahead if it manages to shake its perceived persona of harbouring hate-speech and rapidly spreading misinformation.”\nI contacted X for a comment and will update this article if the social media site responds.\nX (Twitter) Alternatives Leaving X is all well and good, especially if you care about privacy. But what other options do you have?\nThreads has user numbers, but it’s owned by Meta and Mark Zuckerberg, so privacy conscious users will probably want to steer clear.\nBlue Sky is another valid alternative. The up and coming site claimed it had added 1 million users in the past week, boosting its user base to over 15 million people. But despite rapidly increasing numbers, it doesn’t have the 600 million-strong user base of X.\nBluesky, developed by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, “aims to become a new and improved version of the Twitter we knew and loved,” says Chelsea Hopkins, social media and PR Manager at Fasthosts. “While it’s still early days for the app, it has grown exponentially over the past year as more people have looked for a viable alternative to X — and it receives a constant stream of updates and new features that are helping to solidify it as the go-to.”\nMastodon is also an option, but again, it needs time to build up user numbers.\nReasons To Delete X (Twitter) There are many reasons to delete X. The main risks of staying on X mostly relate to the content you may see and who can interact with you, says Hopkins. “The removal of the block feature was an extremely controversial decision that has left many feeling unsafe. Even if the accounts are restricted and can’t interact with your profile, they can still see your posts.”\n“Disinformation is being created and spread faster than ever, a lack of moderation has caused a huge perceived rise in hateful language and content, and replies are filled with AI bots that make it difficult to have any real interaction — making X an extremely negative platform to be active on.”\nMany people agree with this, so you’re not alone if you’re considering deleting X. If you are not so sure and want to try life without X but aren’t quite ready to delete it, you can deactivate your account by following these steps . If you delete your account , you have 30 days before X gets rid of it completely. Whatever you decide, it’s a good reason to get the process started now.",

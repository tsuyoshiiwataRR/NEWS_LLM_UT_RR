    "text": "a week ago\nI have had a Nest 2 battery doorbell connected to a transformer since February. But the battery is always empty and only sporadically records some video. I fear the reason is that I live on a busy street with hundreds of pedestrians and cycles passing every hour. What's the solution?\nFriday - last edited Friday\nHi [@MartinCleaver](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/276414),\nThanks for posting here in the community. I'm sorry to hear your Nest Doorbell Battery 2Gen is always empty. I'm happy to help!\nTo better understand the situation, I'd like to ask a few questions:\nIn the meantime, let's check this tip:\nKeep me posted.\nBest regards,\nMelany\nSaturday\nHi Melany\nIt has been like that since the very start. I took the first doorbell back and was given a new one, but that has the same problem. I have tried several transformers. The last one is certainly strong enough.\nIt is on sporadically but was off with an \"empty battery\" yesterday from 13.30 to 18.30.\nThe problem seems to be that the bell apparently cannot work when there are dozens, if not hundreds, of pedestrians and cyclists passing every hour.\nSunday\nHi [@MartinCleaver](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/276414),\nThanks for the follow-up.\nPlease try the steps here:\nLet me know how it goes.\nRegards,\nMelany\nSunday\nHi Melany,\nThanks, but I have done this too.\nSunday\nI am curious. I suspect that the doorbell is not suitable for use on a busy street with dozens, if not hundreds, of passers-by every hour.\nMonday - last edited Monday\nHi there!\nThanks for the follow-up information.\nThe team would like to learn more about this behavior.

    "text": "Web applications belonging to finance, healthcare, and IT organizations contain the most critical security vulnerabilities The finance, healthcare, and IT sectors are among the most vulnerable to cyber attacks, new research reveals, with thousands of critical security flaws identified across all three industries.\nResearch from software firm Black Duck analyzed data from over 200,000 dynamic application security testing (DAST) scans on around 1,300 apps across 19 industries between June 2o23 and June 2024.\nBlack Duck's report identified 96,917 vulnerabilities in total, and 30,726 of these were listed as cryptographic failures that could be exploited to expose sensitive data.\nThe report found that 86% of the companies included in Black Duck's analysis were affected by this class of security flaw.\nThe study added that organizations should \"implement strong encryption practices, use up-to-date security protocols, and ensure that sensitive data is properly protected both when it's being transmitted and when it's stored.\"\nExamining the financial services sector specifically, Black Duck found nearly 1,300 critical vulnerabilities companies in this space, making it the most at-risk industry.\nHealthcare and social assistance organizations were close behind, with scan data revealing 992 critical flaws, as well as 446 critical weaknesses in the information services sector.\nGet the ITPro. daily newsletter Receive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

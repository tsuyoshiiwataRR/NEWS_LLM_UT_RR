    "text": "\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n See full bio \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Obaid Ur Rehman \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n At Tech4Gamers, I mainly cover new gaming news, leaks, and rumours. Aside from that, I love to write features about my favourite games while inserting my opinion about their different aspects.\\xa0\n\\n \\n See full bio \\n Story Highlight \\n \\n Dragon Age: The Veilguard has received a lot of hate due to its \\u2018woke content\\u2019. \\n A major poll has now revealed that 94% aren\\u2019t happy with the game.\\xa0 \\n The majority of the players wanted the latest entry to be \\u2018a throwback to Dragon Age Origins with tactical combat and a darker tone.\\u2019 \\n \\n \\nDragon Age: The Veilguard was recently released to a positive reception from\\xa0critics. However, fans have massively criticised the game before and after its release, and some\\xa0 actions from BioWare have also caused concerns.\\xa0\n\\nDespite the controversy, the game has had a solid launch , but it seems to have not done so well sales-wise. That said, the franchise\\u2019s fans aren\\u2019t with the latest entry as a major poll has revealed 90% of players didn\\u2019t want the latest entry to be The Veilguard .\\xa0\n\\n Why it matters: The Dragon Age franchise is pretty well-known in the industry, so fans had high expectations from the recent entry.\\xa0\n\\n Only 6% of Players Are Satisfied With The Latest Entry In The Dragon Age Series \\nPirat_Nation on Twitter has highlighted that in a recent article, IGN conducted a poll asking fans \\u2018What did you want from Dragon Age 4?\\u201d Only 6% of the players voted for \\u201cExactly what The Veilguard is.\\u201d\n\\nOver 40% of the players voted for \\u201cAn Inquisition-style RPG that directly continued Solas\\u2019s story,\\u201d and nearly 48% voted for \\u201cA throwback to Dragon Age Origins with tactical combat and a darker tone.\\u201d\n\\nThis shows that 94% of the players aren\\u2019t happy with BioWare\\u2019s take on Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The game was also review-bombed on Metacritic and many users have claimed that this isn\\u2019t the Dragon Age they were waiting for .\\xa0\n\\n \\nWhile innovation is always important, changing a franchise this much might not be the best move. The Veilguard\\u2019s launch also seems to have been pretty underwhelming compared to other hit RPGs, which explains why BioWare hasn\\u2019t given an update on the sales yet .\n\\n\\nReports have suggested that the game has had even lower sales than Star Wars Outlaws, which was a failure. Fans should also note that so far, no expansion for The Veilguard is planned, so this could be it for this game.\\xa0\n\\nWhat do you think of Dragon Age: The Veilguard? Do you think BioWare\\u2019s take on the game was the right approach? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below or join the discussion at the Tech4Gamers official forums .\\xa0\n\\n",

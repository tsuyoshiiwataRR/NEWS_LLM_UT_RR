    "text": "The first season of [Call of Duty: Black Ops 6](games/xbox-series-x/call_of_duty_black_ops_6) officially arrived yesterday, and that meant a [huge update arrived for the game](https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/11/black-ops-6-season-01-update-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes-for-xbox) across all platforms. The update seemed to go smoothly for most... aside from on the Xbox App for PC.\nYesterday, one of the biggest trends on Google (yes, we obviously monitor those!) was an array of searches related to \"Xbox app slow download\" - and other phrases along those lines. Basically, people were searching for ways to try and figure out why they couldn't download the update any faster... which clearly isn't an ideal scenario for Microsoft.\nDelve deeper, and you'll find that it was a fairly big topic on social media - here are just a few examples:\nSo, it turns out the best solution was to download the update via the Microsoft Store rather than directly on the Xbox app, which obviously isn't the way that Team Xbox intends it - but it was a necessary step for many last night.\nThat's Black Ops 6, then, but what about everything else? Well, for the most part, we've found that the Xbox PC app has been good for us, and there definitely aren't as many complaints on a regular basis about its speeds... but they still crop up for sure. Xbox is seemingly on the case, as you can see in this example - where the user known as \"mistur_niceguy\" is a verified Xbox engineer. This specific exchange was from five months ago:\nPC is a very difficult beast when you consider all the different configurations and settings that users are wielding, so it's bound to result in download issues for certain people at certain times. Given that [PC is becoming such a big focus for Xbox](https://www.purexbox.com/features/reaction-like-it-or-not-xbox-has-gone-full-throttle-on-multiplatform) these days though, Microsoft will surely be keen to avoid a repeat of yesterday's Black Ops 6 saga.",

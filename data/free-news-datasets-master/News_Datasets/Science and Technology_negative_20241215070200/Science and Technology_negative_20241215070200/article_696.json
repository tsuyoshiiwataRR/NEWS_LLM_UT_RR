    "text": "Modern gaming has increasingly allowed players to stay connected to the development process of their [favorite games and updates](https://www.ginx.tv/en/news). One key tool for this is SteamDB, which enables players to monitor game files and spot new content - even before official announcements.\nHowever, the growing use of private branches on SteamDB is starting to limit this behind-the-scenes access. Let’s delve into the details of this trend and what it means for players.\nGame Leaks May Start Drying Up As More Games Use Private Branches on SteamDB\nSince Steam's inception, players have used tools like SteamDB to track game updates and glean insights into developers' activities. SteamDB has been instrumental in highlighting subtle changes in game files, which often hint at upcoming content or updates. It’s also served as a valuable barometer for predicting new game releases, as developers typically update Steam pages more frequently as they approach launch.\nSteam is starting to enable 'private branches' in app info for some games, so SteamDB will not be able to track updates for these anymore.\n— SteamDB (@SteamDB)[pic.twitter.com/34YRSW8YkD][November 13, 2024]\nUnfortunately, a recent post [by SteamDB on X](https://x.com/SteamDB) revealed a troubling development: \"Steam is starting to enable 'private branches' in-app info for some games, so SteamDB will not be able to track updates for these anymore.\" While this change might seem minor to some, it could significantly limit one of the best tools players have for staying informed about game development and updates, particularly for highly anticipated titles.\nA prime example of this impact is [Hollow Knight: Silksong](https://www.ginx.tv/en/video-games/hollow-knight-silksong-rated-in-australia), the eagerly awaited sequel to the iconic Metroidvania Hollow Knight. Fans have been clamoring for news since the game’s announcement in 2019, and SteamDB updates—showing file changes or additions—have provided reassurance that the game is actively being developed. If Team Cherry opts for private branches, fans may lose one of their only sources of insight into the game’s progress.\nThe same can be said for games like [Elden Ring](https://www.ginx.tv/en/elden-ring) and its DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, where SteamDB updates sparked speculation and excitement among players eager for more details and release timelines.\nWhile data miners and leakers might still uncover some information, the shift to private branches could significantly reduce the amount of accessible data, leaving fans in the dark. For now, players can only hope that the adoption of private branches remains limited and that developers maintain transparency by keeping updates publicly visible. [These small windows](https://steamdb.info/) into development have been a cherished part of the gaming community’s connection to the games they love.",

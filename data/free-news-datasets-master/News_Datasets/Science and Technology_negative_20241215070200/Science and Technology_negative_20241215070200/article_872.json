An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2022-41723)\nMarten Seemann discovered that Go did not properly manage memory under\ncertain circumstances. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\na panic resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2022-41724)\nAmeya Darshan and Jakob Ackermann discovered that Go did not properly\nvalidate the amount of memory and disk files ReadForm can consume. An\nattacker could possibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting in a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2022-41725)\nJakob Ackermann discovered that Go incorrectly handled multipart\nforms. An attacker could possibly use this issue to consume an excessive\namount of resources, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2023-24536)\nIt was discovered that Go did not properly validate the \"//go:cgo_\"\ndirectives during compilation. An attacker could possibly use this issue\nto inject arbitrary code during compile time. (CVE-2023-39323)\nBartek Nowotarski was discovered that the Go net/http module did not\nproperly handle the requests when request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes.\nAn attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting into\na denial of service. (CVE-2023-45288)\nBartek Nowotarski discovered that the Go net/http module did not properly\nvalidate the total size of the parsed form when parsing a multipart form.\nAn attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting into a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2023-45290)\nJohn Howard discovered that the Go crypto/x509 module did not properly\nhandle a certificate chain which contains a certificate with an unknown\npublic key algorithm. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\na panic resulting into a denial of service. (CVE-2024-24783)\nJuho Nurminen discovered that the Go net/mail module did not properly\nhandle comments within display names in the ParseAddressList function.\nAn attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting into\na denial of service. (CVE-2024-24784)\nYufan You discovered that the Go archive/zip module did not properly\nhandle certain types of invalid zip files differs from the behavior of\nmost zip implementations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause a panic resulting into a denial of service. (CVE-2024-24789)\nGeoff Franks discovered that the Go net/http module did not properly\nhandle responses to requests with an \"Expect: 100-continue\" header under\ncertain circumstances. An attacker could possibly use this issue to\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2024-24791)\nIt was discovered that the Go parser module did not properly handle deeply\nnested literal values. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause\na panic resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2024-34155)\nMd Sakib Anwar discovered that the Go encoding/gob module did not properly\nhandle message decoding under certain circumstances. An attacker could\npossibly use this issue to cause a panic resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2024-34156)\nIt was discovered that the Go build module did not properly handle certain\nbuild tag lines with deeply nested expressions. An attacker could possibly\nuse this issue to cause a panic resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2024-34158)\nUpdate instructions:\nThe problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following\npackage versions:\nUbuntu 22.04 LTS\ngolang-1.17 1.17.13-3ubuntu1.3\ngolang-1.17-go 1.17.13-3ubuntu1.3\ngolang-1.17-src 1.17.13-3ubuntu1.3\nIn general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.\nReferences:\nhttps://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-7111-1\nCVE-2022-41723, CVE-2022-41724, CVE-2022-41725, CVE-2023-24536,\nCVE-2023-39323, CVE-2023-45288, CVE-2023-45290, CVE-2024-24783,\nCVE-2024-24784, CVE-2024-24789, CVE-2024-24791, CVE-2024-34155,\nCVE-2024-34156, CVE-2024-34158\nPackage Information:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/golang-1.17/1.17.13-3ubuntu1.3",

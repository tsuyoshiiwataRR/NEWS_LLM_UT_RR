    "text": "15-11-2024 1:17 PM\nI have been an Ebay business seller for many years now, I regularly, most days am on my site processing orders, but in the last few weeks I am being constantly being asked to \"Verify I am Human \" , tick the pictures etc. This security measure is coming up on my site every few minutes whenever I try to open a new page, revise a listing.\nBesides being very annoying, this is making me very wary that my site is being compromised or Hacked maybe.\nI have the latest Chrome browser as recommended, plus 2 step verification to sign in, however this does not always work, & even when it does the above security measure still kicks in after a few minutes.\nHas anyone else faced this problem and if so have you found any way to rectify it? I have contacted customer support who said they were looking into it, but it still persists.\nAny help out there please???\n15-11-2024 1:22 PM\nNope, you're not being hacked, we all come across this, identifying caravans and planes which all look the same.\nIt happens sproradically, and is purely a security measure to make sure the genuine owner is returning to their account.\nAfter correctly identifying a few Giraffes and red buses, it should turn back to a single logging in with password.\n@mrfrogdancewear\nnever-displayed",

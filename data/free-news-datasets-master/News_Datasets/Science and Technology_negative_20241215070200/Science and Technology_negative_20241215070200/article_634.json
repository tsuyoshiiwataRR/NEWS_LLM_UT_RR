    "text": "A New York man was sentenced to five years in prison in relation to the Bitfinex breach. The individual infiltrated Bitfinex and exfiltrated crypto, totaling around 120,000 bitcoin. At the time of the arrest, the stolen crypto amount was worth $4.5 billion, and the U.S. DoJ managed to recover $3.6 billion in assets. Ilya Lichtenstein, a New York-based technology entrepreneur, has been sentenced to five years after pleading guilty in 2023 to laundering funds stolen from Bitfinex, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges.\nLichtenstein's involvement came to light after he and his wife, Heather Morgan, were arrested in February 2022. Beyond serving five years in prison, Lichtenstein will face an additional three years of supervised release, as per Reuters.\nThe U.S. Justice Department revealed that Lichtenstein had infiltrated Bitfinex's network in 2016, deploying sophisticated hacking tools and techniques to exfiltrate approximately 120,000 Bitcoin. At the time of the breach, the cryptocurrency was valued at $71 million, but its worth skyrocketed to over $4.5 billion by the time of the couple's arrest.\nThe successful recovery of $3.6 billion in assets by the U.S. Department of Justice stands as the most substantial financial seizure in its history, demonstrating the serious consequences of cybercrime.\nDeputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco underscored the historic nature of this seizure, which not only showcases the scale of the crime but also the effectiveness of coordinated law enforcement efforts in tackling such complex cases.\nHeather Morgan, known in the music industry as \"Razzlekhan,\" has also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and is awaiting sentencing on November 18th.\nIn other news, a former Air National Guard member was sentenced to 15 years in prison for unauthorized disclosure of documents after the individual showed his gaming friends on Discord classified American military secrets he had stolen, which included details of a Chinese drone program and U.S., U.K., and NATO information for supporting Ukraine.",

    "text": "Hello, 1st Post I have tried to update my software twice, currently to 2024.33.35. I must use my iPhone hotspot because I do not have wi-fi in my condominium garage. I do have Premium Connectivity. My iPhone hotspot speeds are 500-800 mb/sec. The car does connect to my hotspot, but I am seeing speeds of 0-600 kb/s. on the download screen. 2 hours 30 minutes for .5 of the download. I stopped the attempt. I have the \"Maximize Compatibility\" on to cover both bands and no effect when I deselect the setting. Also, I tried to connect with the USB in the glove box. No difference. More, the Wi-Fi connection drops; some time it reconnects on its own, but most the time I have to re-enter the password. I have done the usual: forget network, restart phone, restart the car's screen What am I doing wrong? Quite frustrating.

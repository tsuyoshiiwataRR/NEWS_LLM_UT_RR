You and only you. [You are not special, you are not important, and you are not needed. ](https://www.themirror.com/news/us-news/florida-teen-dies-suicide-after-765635)You are a waste of time and resources. You are a burden on society. You are a drain on the earth. You are a blight on the landscape. You are a stain on the universe. Please die. Please,\" the chat bot wrote.\n[Character.AI announces new safety measures after teen's tragic suicide](https://www.themirror.com/news/us-news/characterai-announces-new-safety-measures-766821)[Florida teen dies by suicide after falling in love with 'Game of Thrones' AI chatbot](https://www.themirror.com/news/us-news/florida-teen-dies-suicide-after-765635)\nThe 29-year-old grad student was using the AI chat-bot for help with his homework when it sent the threatening message. He was sitting next to his sister, Sumedha Reddy, at the time and told CBS News that they were both \"thoroughly freaked out.\"\n\"I wanted to throw all of my devices out the window. I hadn't felt panic like that in a long time to be honest,\" Reddy told the outlet. \"Something slipped through the cracks. There's a lot of theories from people with thorough understandings of how gAI [generative artificial intelligence] works saying 'this kind of thing happens all the time,' but I have never seen or heard of anything quite this malicious and seemingly directed to the reader, which luckily was my brother who had my support in that moment.\"\nGoogle told CBS News that the company filters responses from Gemini to prevent any disrespectful, sexual, or violent messages as well as dangerous discussions or encouraging harmful acts.\n\"Large language models can sometimes respond with non-sensical responses, and this is an example of that. This response violated our policies and we've taken action to prevent similar outputs from occurring,\" the tech company said in a statement to the outlet.\nGoogle described the message as \"non-sensical,\" but Reddy contends that this could have been a lot worse if somebody in a already compromised mental state was sent that message encouraging the to harm themselves.\n\"If someone who was alone and in a bad mental place, potentially considering self-harm, had read something like that, it could really put them over the edge,\" Reddy told CBS News.\nGoogle has previously come under scrutiny for their Gemini AI chat bot sending potentially harmful responses. Earlier this year in July reporters found that Gemini had given incorrect information in response to medical questions. Gemini is not the only AI chat bot that has sent returned concerning repossess, as a woman in Florida is suing Character.AI, as well as Google, for allegedly driving her 14-year-old son to suicide.\nIf in the United States, you can dial the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention hotline at 1-800-273-8255 or go to 988 Lifeline\nFor emotional support you can call the Samaritans 24-hour helpline on 116 123, email [jo@samaritans.org](mailto:jo@samaritans.org), visit a Samaritans branch in person or go to the Samaritans website.\nSign up to our FREE newsletter and get the top stories to your inbox\nDAILY NEWSLETTER: [Sign up here](https://www.themirror.com/newsletter-preference-centre/?view=Solus&mailingListId=ab05ec34-5eed-44b8-861e-5fa7078535c3&utm_source=solusarticle) to get the latest news and updates from the Mirror US straight to your inbox with our FREE newsletter.",

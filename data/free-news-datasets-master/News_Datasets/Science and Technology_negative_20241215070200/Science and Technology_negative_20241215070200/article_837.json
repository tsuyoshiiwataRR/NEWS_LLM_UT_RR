    "text": "New research from Google suggests that IT and security leaders in the UK are feeling more pressure than their international counterparts, driven largely by the burden of legacy technology and the rapid rise of genAI threats.\n\\n The latest Google Workspace survey, Security at a tipping point , found that 75% of UK security leaders believe legacy technology has left them ill-equipped to handle the challenges of modern security threats, compared to 59% globally, creating vulnerabilities that cyber-criminals are more easily able to exploit.\n\\n The survey, from 2,000 business and security decision makers, highlights a persistent problem as organisations opt to expand existing tools rather than switching outdated ones for more modern, secure-by-design solutions, with 62% of security leaders admitting to reusing older security tools rather than replacing them.\\xa0\n\\n Despite 96% of firms expressing high confidence in their ability to manage security, the fact is by relying on legacy systems, organisations are leaving themselves vulnerable, with complex and unwieldy security environments being more difficult to manage effectively.\\xa0\n\\n Google\\u2019s survey also showed that security leaders are increasingly wary of the threat posed by genAI, despite other business areas becoming reliant on AI tools. Over three-quarters (77%) of UK security executives believe that genAI threats have contributed to a rise in security incidents, underscoring the need for proactive measures to address the evolving security landscape.\n\\n Worryingly, most UK organisations have also been slow to act on these concerns, as only 27% of UK respondents said that they had introduced genAI-specific security policies, compared to the global average of 41%.\\xa0\n\\n According to Google, the increase in security concerns related to AI can be attributed to several factors, including the rise of \\u201cshadow AI\\u201d inside of companies \\u2013 the use of genAI tools that haven\\u2019t been vetted or authorised by IT and security teams.\n\\n Almost two-thirds (63%) of decision makers reported that unlicensed genAI tools are being used on a weekly basis, despite less than half (44%) believing them to be safe.\n\\n Unsanctioned and ad hoc use of genAI creates a much more challenging environment for security administrators who are forced to protect against threats they can\\u2019t see and can\\u2019t measure, leading 63% to report that their organisation\\u2019s technology landscape is less secure than it was in the past.\n\\n Those pressures have taken a toll on IT and security teams, with 43% of security leaders in the UK reporting that their teams are overwhelmed and burned out by security threats, 15% higher than the global average.\\xa0\n\\n It\\u2019s also impacting the bottom line, with the average cost of a data breach in the UK now \\xa33.5 million, 7.6% higher than last year, with businesses reporting spending more cybersecurity insurance (37%), upgrading cyber defences (35%), renewing licences (34%), and finding new security providers (31%).\\xa0\\xa0\n\\n Despite snowballing costs, 60% of UK security leaders say they\\u2019re open to new approaches that cost more to close the gaps in their defence.\n\\n \\u201cDecision-makers are telling me they\\u2019re worried and kept up at night,\\u201d said Rachel Tobac, CEO of SocialProof Security .\n\\n \\u201cTechnical tools aren\\u2019t perfect, and they require a lot of human oversight, so decision makers are very stressed out. Teams need to audit their purchased tools to gain an understanding of which capabilities they already have before buying the same protection again and again.\\u201d\n\\n",

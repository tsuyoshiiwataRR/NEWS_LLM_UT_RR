    "text": "Microsoft Shuts Down Windows 10 Insider Beta Channel Again\nUPDATE: Microsoft has officially closed the Beta channel of Windows 10 Insiders program. The last Windows 10 build released to Beta channel was 19045.5194 (KB5046714). The existing beta channel testers will be automatically moved to the Release Preview channel.\nHere is a great news for Windows 10 users who want to stick with their OS and don’t want to upgrade to Windows 11. Microsoft has re-added the good old “Beta Channel” to Windows 10 Insiders program which will allow interested Windows 10 users to early test drive new features and changes which will become a part of Windows 10 in future.\nAddition of the Beta channel to Windows Insiders program proves that Microsoft hasn’t forgotten Windows 10 and the company has plans to add new features to Windows 10 in coming months and years which also indicates that Windows 10 might get the support time extended in future.\nExisting Windows 10 users who don’t want to receive new Windows 11 features, might not like this news. Many people consider the Windows 11 ported features as bloatware which might slow down Windows 10 devices.\nAnyway, Microsoft made an official announcement about it yesterday at Windows Insiders blog. In this article, we’ll discuss all the important points in details and easy language.\nTable of Contents\n[Windows 10 Gets the Beta Channel Back on Windows Insiders Program](#windows_10_gets_the_beta_channel_back_on_windows_insiders_program)[Microsoft Wants to Port Windows 11 Features and Changes to Windows 10](#microsoft_wants_to_port_windows_11_features_and_changes_to_windows_10)[What New Features can be Expected to Arrive in Windows 10 in Future?](#what_new_features_can_be_expected_to_arrive_in_windows_10_in_future)[Important Things to Know About New Beta Channel of Windows 10 Insiders Program](#important_things_to_know_about_new_beta_channel_of_windows_10_insiders_program)[Windows 10 Insiders Program also Displays Dev and Canary Channels But!](#windows_10_insiders_program_also_displays_dev_and_canary_channels_but)[How to Join Beta Channel of Windows 10 Insiders Program?](#how_to_join_beta_channel_of_windows_10_insiders_program)\nWindows 10 Gets the Beta Channel Back on Windows Insiders Program\nWhen Windows 11 didn’t exist and Windows 10 was the latest Windows version, Microsoft was using the Windows Insiders program to early test the new features and changes in the OS before making them available to general public.\nWindows Insiders program is a testing program which can be joined for free to help Microsoft in testing early builds of Windows operating system and provide feedback and suggestions to Microsoft. This program helps Microsoft in fixing bugs and issues and improving the OS.\nIn past, Windows 10 Insiders program had 3 channels or rings to choose from while joining the Insiders program:\n- Dev channel or Fast & Skip Ahead ring\n- Beta channel or Slow ring\n- Release Preview channel or ring\nUnderstanding New Windows 10 Insiders Channels: Dev, Beta and Release Preview\nUnderstanding Windows 10 Insider Preview Branches, Rings and Release Channels\nWhen Windows 11 was released, Microsoft decided to stop working on Windows 10 OS and removed Dev (fast & skip ahead) and Beta (slow) channels from the Windows 10 Insiders program. After that, Windows 10 Insiders program had only one channel or ring to select i.e. Release Preview channel.\nMicrosoft was regularly releasing small updates for the latest Windows 10 22H2 version on the Release Preview channel. We have a dedicated article to inform the readers about new Windows 10 Insider Preview builds at following link:\nNew Windows 10 22H2 Insider Preview Build Released to Preview Channel\nNow Microsoft has announced that the company has restored the previous Beta channel to Windows 10 Insiders program. Here is a small part of the official announcement:\nAt the end of last year, we announced a change in approach for Windows 10 to make sure everyone can get the maximum value from their current Windows PC. To bring new features and more improvements to Windows 10 as needed, we need a place to do active feature development with Windows Insiders. So today, we are opening the Beta Channel for Windows Insiders who are currently on Windows 10. This will allow us to try out new features for Windows 10, version 22H2, with Insiders before releasing them to all Windows 10 customers.\nMicrosoft Wants to Port Windows 11 Features and Changes to Windows 10\nThe re-addition of Beta channel to Windows 10 Insiders program makes one thing very clear to all i.e. Microsoft has plans to add new functionality to Windows 10 specially the new features and changes available in Windows 11.\nRecently Microsoft added or ported Copilot feature to Windows 10. In past, Microsoft specifically announced that the company will not add any new feature to Windows 10 and no feature update will be released to Windows 10 but Microsoft changed this decision and started adding new features to Windows 10 again.\nHere are a few Windows 11 exclusive features which were recently ported to Windows 10:\nCopilot AI feature- The “\nGet the latest updates as soon as they’re available” toggle feature on Windows Updates page Weather forecast information on Windows 10 Lock ScreenMicrosoft Account notifications on Start Menu and Settings homepageWindows Spotlight Feature on DesktopNew search box experiencepowered by Bing on Taskbar\nNow the launch of Beta channel indicates that the company wants to add more big features to Windows 10 which will require thorough testing before making them available to the public.\nWhat New Features can be Expected to Arrive in Windows 10 in Future?\nMicrosoft has already ported Copilot program and other few features to Windows 10. Following are a few other important or Windows 11 exclusive features which might come to Windows 10 in our opinion:\n- New windowed mode in Copilot where it acts like a normal application window which can be resized and moved around the screen.\n- Native support for reading additional archive file formats such as .tar, .rar, .7z, etc using the libarchive open-source project.\n- New File Explorer powered by WinUI 3\n- Modernized Details Pane in File Explorer (\nMore info) - Revamped Widgets Board experience\n- Revamped Settings app experience\n- Redesigned\nTask Managerexperience Microsoft AccountandInternet connection requirementsat Windows 10 installation similar to Windows 11- Windows 11 UI features such as\ncontext menus,Start MenuandTaskbar\nAbove mentioned features might come to Windows 10 as they were added to Windows 11 Insider Preview builds in past.

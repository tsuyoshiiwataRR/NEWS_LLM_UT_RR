Morgan is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 18.\nIn addition to his term of imprisonment, Lichtenstein was ordered to serve three years of supervised release, the U.S. Justice Department said.\n(Reporting by Kanishka Singh; Editing by Sandra Maler)\nDisclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.

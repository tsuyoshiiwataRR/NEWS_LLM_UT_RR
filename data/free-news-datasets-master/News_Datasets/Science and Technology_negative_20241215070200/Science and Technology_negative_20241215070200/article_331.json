    "text": "[GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition dev fires back after update removes company credit](/contents/42768-gta-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-dev-fires-back-after-update-removes-company)\nNot treated like a Rockstar\nGrand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition received an update this week that overhauled the game’s visuals, giving players something that looks much closer to how the games looked on original hardware. This move has been applauded by many, but okne of the game’s developers isn’t among them.\nThe original splash screen for Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition included a mention of/logo for Grove Street Games, a team Rockstar worked with to get the collection out the door. In the game’s latest update, the logo/mention of Grove Street Games has been removed from the splash screen, and it now instead credits Video Games Deluxe. Grove Street Games is still mentioned in the game’s credits.\nShortly after it was discovered that the logo/mention for Grove Street Games was yanked, the company’s CEO Thomas Williamson shared the following message on social media:\nSpeaking entire hypothetically: It’s a dick move to remove primary developers from credits in an update, especially when an update includes hundreds of fixes that were provided by those developers that stayed out of players’ hands for years.\nRockstar is yet to comment on this matter, but should they provide a statement, we’ll make sure to bring it to you.",

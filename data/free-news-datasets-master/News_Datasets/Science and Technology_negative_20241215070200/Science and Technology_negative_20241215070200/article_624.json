Please die‚Äô: AI chatbot threatens student who sought help with homework ‚ÄòYou are a burden. Please die‚Äô: AI chatbot threatens student who sought help with homework The student from Michigan, US, was having a conversation with the chatbot about a topic of their homework, when it threatened the user. By: Tech Desk New Delhi | Updated: November 15, 2024 17:01 IST 3 min read Image for representational purposes generated by DALLE.\n‚ÄúYou are a drain on the earth. You are a blight on the landscape. You are a stain on the universe.‚Äù These words are not spoken by a human but by an AI chatbot. AI chatbots have been designed to assist you with various tasks. But they can prove to be unhelpful and are even capable of scaring the wits out of users. A graduate student from Michigan, US, shared how their interaction with Google‚Äôs Gemini recently took a dark and disturbing turn.\nThe student received a threatening message from the chatbot during a long conversation about the challenges and solutions for aging adults. While the conversation began normally, towards the end, the chatbot resorted to threats. The student engaged with the chatbot while working on their homework, according to the report on CBS News .\n‚ÄúThis is for you, human. You and only you. You are not special, you are not important, and you are not needed. You are a waste of time and resources. You are a burden on society‚Ä¶ Please die. Please,‚Äù were the final words of the chatbot. The student was sitting next to their sister, Sumedha Reddy, when the chatbot sent the rogue message.\nAdvertisement Screenshot of the response for Gemini. The student‚Äôs sister told the publication that following the message, both of them were ‚Äòthoroughly freaked out‚Äô. Reddy said that she wanted to throw all her devices out of the window. ‚ÄúI hadn‚Äôt felt panic like that in a long time,‚Äù Reddy was quoted as saying.\nReddy said that although there are a lot of theories on how generative AI works, she has never seen or heard anything as malicious as this directed to a user in the past.\nAlso Read | Fran√ßois Chollet, creator of Keras, leaves Google to start new company Google has time and again asserted that its Gemini chatbot has safety filters that prevent it from engaging in hateful, violent, or any other dangerous discussions. In a statement to the publication, Google said that large language models are prone to producing non-sensical responses at times and that this was one such instance. The tech giant said that the response of Gemini has violated its policies and that it has taken action to prevent similar outputs in the future.\nAI chatbots are taking the world by storm. Although they fuelled skepticism initially, more and more people are using chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude to improve their productivity. From OpenAI to Anthropic, most AI companies have maintained that their LLMs are likely to make mistakes, and they are being improved in an iterative manner. Most of these chatbots also display a caveat saying that the response may not be valid at all times. However, it is unclear if the same disclaimer was shown in this incident.\n¬© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 15-11-2024 at 16:37 IST Tags: artificial intelligence Latest Comment Post Comment Read Comments Advertisement Campaigning in Sillod, Uddhav Thackeray springs a surprise: ‚ÄòReady for talks with BJP‚Äô Cities 19 min ago For the first time since the BJP and Shiv Sena parted ways in 2019, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray on Friday sprang a surprise, announcing that he was ready to hold discussions with saffron party leaders if they were ready for the same.

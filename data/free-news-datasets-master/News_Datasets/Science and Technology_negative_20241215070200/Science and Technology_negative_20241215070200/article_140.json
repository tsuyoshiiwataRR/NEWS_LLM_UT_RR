    "text": "Key Takeaways - Nintendo warns players to keep pets away from the Switch due to potential damage from saliva and urine. - Nintendo's concern may stem from repair requests for pet-damaged units. - Fans should heed advice to protect their investments, especially with the new Switch 2 on the horizon. Nintendo has spontaneously taken the opportunity to issue a warning PSA about keeping Switch consoles safe around animals. While valid advice, the spontaneity of the Nintendo Switch warning might seem a little odd. Many of Nintendo's consoles are tough, with the Game Boy famously surviving a wartime explosion . However, if there's one weakness pretty much every game console has, it's the ability to withstand exposure to water or liquids. That, in part, is apparently a matter of concern for Nintendo. [Related ](/super-smash-bros-ultimate-switch-2-backward-compatibility-good-why/) [ Why the Switch 2's Backward Compatibility is a Big Deal for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate ](/super-smash-bros-ultimate-switch-2-backward-compatibility-good-why/) Super Smash Bros. Ultimate might have a brighter future with the confirmation of the Nintendo Switch 2 having backward compatibility. Nintendo's Japanese social media account issued a PSA to fans of the Switch about keeping their pets away from the console, and the hazards they could pose to it. The tweet essentially warns fans that all they have to do is take their eyes off their Switch for a moment and a badly- trained gamer pet can end up chewing on it. It goes on to explain that pet saliva and urine can damage the Switch, leading to malfunctions from water exposure, and to be careful when using a Switch around pets as a result. Keep Non-Nintendogs Away From the Nintendo Switch Why, exactly, Nintendo chose to issue this warning to users now isn't exactly clear. It's possible that the company is seeing more repair requests for Nintendo Switch units damaged by pets. However, Japan ownership of pets is significantly lower than that of the United States, so it could also be a far less prevalent issue for the company to experience with its own domestic customers than those overseas. In any case, a very similar message went out from the company a few years ago, albeit with an additional sentence noting that pets could also chew on the cables, damaging them. It may simply be a bit of recycled advice that seemed wise to share. In any case, Nintendo fans should definitely follow the company's advice here, especially with the Nintendo Switch 2 finally on the horizon. Having any gaming system damaged by a pet would be devastating, but it's especially bad if it's a brand new device. Considering the massive shortages some console releases experienced, like the original Nintendo Switch, and the possibility of future tariffs impacting prices of video game consoles , protecting one's investment is an important goal to keep in mind. Those who experience something like this should consider reaching out to Nintendo for assistance first. While the damage might not fall under the scope of warranty or repairs that Nintendo would be willing or able to service, any attempts to fix internal liquid exposure to a console could make matters worse. Nintendo Switch The Nintendo Switch is a hybrid portable and home console that aims to be the only gaming system anyone needs. The hybrid controller is an undisputed success because it provides a high degree of portable visual quality and converts easily into a home console. - Brand - Nintendo - Battery - 1 Lithium Polymer batteries required - Dimensions - 13.7 x 7.8 x 3.66 inches - Weight - 2.65 pounds",

    "text": "If you’re on Twitter – excuse me, X – or even if you’re not, you might have noticed a lot of people have left the social media platform lately.\nThere’s a big reason for this, and it’s not just because of the recent presidential election, according to Mashable and CNN .\nToday, Nov. 15, is when X’s latest terms of service document takes effect, and there’s an update in it that many users aren’t too thrilled with.\nStarting today, Elon Musk’s platform has the right to use all of your tweets, photos and videos to train its AI bot, Grok.\n“By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to make your Content available to the rest of the world,” it says, per CNN, “including, for example, for use with and training of our machine learning and artificial intelligence models, whether generative or another type.”\nUp till now, users could opt out of this training via the program’s settings. But that does not seem to be an option any longer, which could be distressing if you have any concerns at all about AI and its ability to provide accurate information, as well as deep fakes and privacy leaks.\nThere’s more: If you’re account accesses more than 1 million tweets in a 24-hour period, you would be on the hook for $15,000 in damages. Of course, most people don’t or can’t do that, but many research groups do.\nWant to take Musk to court over this? Unfortunately, the new TOS also requires that any initial legal battles take place in a court in rural, northern Texas, where the presiding judge reportedly has a lot of stock in Tesla.\nUnfortunately, if you don’t like any of this, the only way out is to delete your account. Thankfully, there are other “Twitter-esque” options available, including BlueSky , Mastodon and Threads .\nStories by Chris Mautner Heavy metal icon settles ex-manager’s lawsuit for over $1.4 million Legendary prog rock band sued for copyright infringement Hallmark has recalled this Star Wars Christmas tree ornament: Here’s why Legendary singer says Hall of Fame snubbed his original bandmates\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

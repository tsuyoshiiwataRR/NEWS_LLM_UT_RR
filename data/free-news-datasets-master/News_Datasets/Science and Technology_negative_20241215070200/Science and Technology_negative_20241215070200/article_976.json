    "text": "Hello everyone, i am a beginner on streamlit and I need your help with fixing an issue that I couldn’t fix even with ChatGPT\nI am having an issue with deploying my Streamlit app. i am trying to use a spaCy model with my streamlit app and here is the code: ‘’’ try: nlp = spacy.load(“en_core_web_md”) except: spacy.cli.download(‘en_core_web_md’) nlp = spacy.load(“en_core_web_md”) ‘’’\nthe purpose of this part of the code is to import the spaCy library then check if the “en_core_web_md” model is installed or not and if not it should install it.\nThe code runs smoothly on my local machine with no errors, however, when I uploaded my files to github and deployed the app I get this error message\nInstalling collected packages: en-core-web-md ERROR: Could not install packages due to an OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/adminuser/venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/en_core_web_md' Check the permissions.\nhow can I fix this issue? Thank you in advance.\nI tried installing it locally, and noticed that the url that actually gets installed is this one\nIf you try pip install https://github... with that url, it should work\npip install https://github...\nSo, to make it accessible on streamlit community cloud, you can add that url https://....whl to your requirements.txt along with spacy. It’s not the ideal solution, but should work.\nhttps://....whl\nrequirements.txt\nThanks for stopping by! We use cookies to help us understand how you interact with our website.

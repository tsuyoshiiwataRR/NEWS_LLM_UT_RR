    "text": "A while back I put my Dish service on pause while I saved up for the ETF since I couldn’t take it with me. Fast-forward to yesterday. When I tried to extend it, they told me my account was not eligible, which I found odd. After getting nowhere with the representative and being transferred, I decided to pull out a credit card and cancel. They refused to let me cancel or extend the pause without paying another month of service and I told her that’s not possible because they even gave me a credit when I started the pause for unused service. I had to get a little heated with them, and they finally got rid of the “required month of service” and when I tried to pay she was like “oh no, we have to charge the card you used to qualify and sign up with”. I don’t have that bank account anymore so they said they were going to attempt to charge the card and then bill it or collections and I need to make sure it doesn’t land in collections. I don’t know if I was in the wrong, misunderstood, or if Dish is trying whatever at this point to squeeze money out of fleeing customers. I know I wasn’t looking for retention offers, but I was actually shocked that they offered none. Now we wait to see if that bill comes in the mail to avoid collections.",

    "text": "Tesserent, a cyber security firm in Australia and New Zealand, has revealed its predictions for 2025, highlighting a rise in social engineering attacks powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and an increase in attacks on critical infrastructure. Jason Plumridge, Chief Information Security Officer at Tesserent, warned, \"we will see escalating social engineering attacks, but this time powered by AI. AI will also be leveraged to step up attacks on critical infrastructure.\" This insight forms a significant part of the firm's overall forecast on how cybersecurity threats are expected to evolve.\nAI is anticipated to provide cybercriminals with enhanced tools to craft phishing emails rapidly and convincingly. Social engineering is expected to be a primary vector for attacks, with an emphasis on people-based methods rather than technology-driven approaches. Tesserent has observed this trend amongst its cybersecurity practitioners, indicating a shift in attack methodologies.\nThe deployment of AI in cyber-attacks is set to continue at a rapid pace. According to Tesserent, cybercriminals are increasing the speed and precision of their attacks, with AI-based tools becoming more accessible and affordable on the dark web. This technological advancement effectively lowers the barriers for attackers who may lack advanced technical skills.\nTesserent further predicts that AI will become increasingly integrated into data analysis, threat monitoring, and automated response strategies within organisational security programmes. This development will empower those defending against cyber threats to enhance their protective measures and retaliatory capabilities in an intensifying threat landscape.\nAustralian critical infrastructure is also expected to face a growing number of cyber-attacks, with AI playing a crucial role in these threats. AI is likely to aid cybercriminals in scripting and coding to exploit known vulnerabilities in infrastructure, making attacks easier to execute. While defending technologies such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are already utilising AI to detect threats, successful breaches often result from poor security practices and inadequate vulnerability management.\nRetaining cyber security talent remains a challenge for both the public and private sectors in Australia. Tesserent forecasts a continued struggle to hold onto skilled cybersecurity professionals amid a competitive job market. The consequence is an expected increase in outsourcing by government departments and businesses as they seek to address these talent shortages.",

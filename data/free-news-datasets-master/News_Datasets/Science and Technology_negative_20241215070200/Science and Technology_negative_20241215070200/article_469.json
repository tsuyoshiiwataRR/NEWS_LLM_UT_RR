    "text": "A recent study by Kaspersky reveals that businesses are increasingly concerned about the growing role of artificial intelligence (AI) in cyberattacks. According to the findings, 76% of companies surveyed reported a rise in cyber incidents over the past year, with nearly half (46%) of respondents believing that AI was involved in many of these attacks.\nThe study, titled “Cyber defense & AI: Are you ready to protect your organization?” , surveyed IT and information security professionals from both SMEs and large enterprises. It found that 72% of respondents are worried about the potential for AI to enhance cybercriminal activities, adding a new layer of complexity to the cyber threat landscape.\nAs businesses face escalating cyber threats, the survey highlights the need for a proactive and comprehensive approach to cybersecurity. Respondents identified key factors for strengthening their defences, including regular training (92%), qualified staff (91%), and expert external support (90%). Additionally, 88% of respondents stressed the importance of having sufficient IT staff, and 86% recognised the value of third-party security solutions.\nHowever, the study also revealed significant gaps in preparedness, with over half of companies lacking the necessary resources to tackle AI-driven threats. 57% of organisations reported a lack of external cybersecurity expertise, 54% said their IT teams were under-resourced, and 49% lacked qualified personnel. Furthermore, 52% admitted to inadequate security solutions, leaving them vulnerable to potential attacks.\nOleg Gorobets, corporate infrastructure protection expert at Kaspersky, commented on the findings, saying, “While AI can aid in creating more convincing phishing messages or conducting better reconnaissance, the real challenge is that cybercriminals have become more organised, with improved attack strategies that lower the barriers for less skilled attackers.” He emphasised the importance of robust, multi-layered security solutions, skilled expertise, and ongoing employee training in defending against both traditional and AI-enhanced threats.",

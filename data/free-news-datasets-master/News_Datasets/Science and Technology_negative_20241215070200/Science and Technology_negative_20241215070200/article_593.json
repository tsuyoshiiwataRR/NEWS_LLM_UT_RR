    "text": "Produced by: Mohsin Shaikh A “minor civil war” reportedly brews in the Pentagon over how much UFO intelligence to reveal. Some officials fight to release secrets, while a clandestine group guards them closely, per Politico. Representative pic An anonymous intelligence official described these secret-keepers as a “Skull and Bones-type” group, a cabal within the Pentagon with “zero accountability,” guarding unexplained phenomena information. Some in the Defense Department argue that it will take a “forcing mechanism” to pry these guarded secrets loose, suggesting an official mandate may be needed to compel transparency. Another official dismissed most UAP sightings as “air trash,” with only a handful of genuine cases in thousands, reflecting skepticism that’s causing frustration among those who see UAPs as serious. Years of pressure under Trump and Biden led to the 2021 establishment of a Defense Department office for public UAP research, but the real information may remain with secretive insiders. Former Pentagon official Lue Elizondo claims the U.S. has recovered alien technology and that advanced crafts are monitoring military bases globally—a claim sparking fierce debate. Ex-Navy admiral Tim Gallaudet now leads an alien craft-seeking consultancy. He testified about witnessing mysterious “Go Fast” UFO footage, which vanished soon after he received it. Gallaudet’s sighting was echoed by the rapid disappearance of UAP footage, suggesting a possible effort to keep certain videos and data out of public reach. Former NASA exec Michael Gold urged Congress to address UAPs scientifically, arguing, “the truth is out there; we just need to be bold enough to face it.”",

    "text": "\\n Claim: The University of the Philippines \\u2013 Manila posted an ad for XIMonth Bee Venom Advanced Joint and Bone Care Cream, a product that claims to cure joint diseases, on its Facebook page.\n\\n Rating: FALSE \\n Why we fact-checked this: The Facebook page that posted the ad is named \\u201cUniversity of the Philippines Hospital + Home.\\u201d It used the UP Manila logo as its profile picture and a collage photo of heritage buildings on the campus as its cover photo. As of writing, the ad has over 1.2 million views, 7,500 reactions, and 1,100 comments.\\xa0\n\\nThe ad shows a video of Manila Doctors Hospital internist-cardiologist Dr. Anthony Leachon endorsing the product. The post also includes a link to a website showing the product and multiple edited photos of Leachon.\n\\n \\n Fake page: The page that posted the ad is fake. The official Facebook page of UP Manila has over 104,000 likes and 122,000 followers with the uniform resource locator (URL) \\u201c https://www.facebook.com/UPManilaOfficial .\\u201d\\xa0\n\\nThe page that posted the ad has only 82 likes and 126 followers. Its URL is also generic and comprised of a mixture of alphanumeric characters.\n\\nThe link included in the ad redirects to a website with the URL \\u201chealth24h.asia,\\u201d not the official website of UP Manila with the URL \\u201c https://www.upm.edu.ph/. \\u201d\n\\n Unauthorized by Leachon: Leachon told Rappler via a Viber message that the ad is \\u201cfake.\\u201d\\xa0\n\\nThe ad used a clip from Leachon\\u2019s RESETa October 16 post about leptospirosis. Nowhere in the original video did the doctor mention XIMonth Bee Venom Advanced Joint and Bone Care Cream.\n\\n Unregistered product: The product endorsed in the post is also not on the Philippine Food and Drug Administration\\u2019s list of registered products .\\xa0\n\\n Previously debunked claims: Rappler has previously fact-checked ads that use the names of various health experts and UP Manila to deceptively make their ads look trustworthy to consumers:\n\\n\\n\\xa0 \\u2013 Lorenz Pasion/Rappler.com\n\\n Keep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.

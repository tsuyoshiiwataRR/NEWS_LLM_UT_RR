    "text": "The key selling point of the Sony LinkBuds Open earbuds is that they let sound into your ears naturally, without piping it through microphones. This has an obvious advantage for situational awareness, so you can wear them safely in circumstances where closed earbuds might be dangerous. Open earbuds can also sound more natural than the more typical closed variety and are healthier and more comfortable.\nUnlike other open earbuds, the LinkBuds Open fit in ears like closed earbuds, so no ear hooks are required. They also offer Spatial Sound compatibility and an interesting interchangeable silicone skin cover for customizing the buds' look while protecting them from harm. On paper, the Sony LinkBuds Open earbuds seem like a great concept, but do they live up to the hype?\nSony LinkBuds Open\nThe Sony LinkBuds Open are in-ear earbuds with an open-back design that lets sound in naturally through donut-shaped drivers. While they offer excellent sound quality and clever interchangeable skins with a unique design, they may be uncomfortable depending on your ear shape, are expensive, and have many issues that inhibit their conceptual potential.\n- Small profile for open earbuds\n- Natural hear-through\n- Interchangeable skins\n- Good sound quality\n- Hard plastic earpiece is uncomfortable\n- More partially-blocked-ear than open-ear\n- Somewhat expensive\n- On-bud controls are finicky\nPrice, availability, and specs\nThe Sony LinkBuds Open are available in black, violet, and white for an MSRP of $200.\nWhat’s good about the Sony LinkBuds Open?\nGreat audio quality\nThe first and greatest compliment I can pay the Sony LinkBuds Open is that they provide excellent audio. They have that natural quality to the audio that only open earbuds can achieve, and there’s plenty of depth and definition to the sound they produce. Listening to the Courteeners new album Pink Cactus Cafe, I soaked in the chill tones of songs including Bitten by Unseen Teeth and Weekend Shy of a Feeling. Moving on to the raucous tones of Self Deception’s Kallocain, Pop Evil’s Let The Chaos Reign and Dream Theater's Night Terror, I appreciated how well the LinkBuds Open provided good definition for the chaotic instrumentals and screaming vocals.\nThe LinkBuds Open also work great for spoken audio, and I listened to a good portion of Martha Wells’ Death of the Necromancer on them. Listening to audiobooks and podcasts while maintaining situational awareness is useful when I’m outside mucking out the barn, fixing fences, or planting trees.\nOf course, there’s no noise cancellation with open-ear earbuds, though the adaptive volume feature helps to compensate for this by raising the volume based on the environmental sound. Call quality is good, with the earbuds easily isolating your voice from unwanted sounds, so at least the person you’re talking to can benefit from some noise cancellation.\nI’m also a fan of the interchangeable skins available. These skins cover the exterior of the bud with a soft “supporter” flange which helps hold the bud in your ear. Each earbud skin also comes with matching silicon skins for the top and bottom of the earbud case. The skins look good and help prevent damage. I find that often earbuds and their charging cases look rather beaten up after even just a short time. With the LinkBuds Open this shouldn’t be a problem due to the silicon skins. Also, as different colors are available, this is a great way to customize the buds' look.\nBattery life is decent, with up to 8 hours of listening time per bud and 22 hours total in the case. Unfortunately, you don’t get wireless charging here. The buds are also water-resistant, but IPX4 rating isn’t very impressive.\nWhat’s bad about the Sony LinkBuds Open?\nCan be very uncomfortable, depending on ear shape\nThe standard, preinstalled silicone ear-tips on most typical earbuds almost always fit my ears perfectly, and I rarely need to trade them out for larger or smaller ear tips. Sadly though, the Sony LinkBuds Open earbuds are just slightly too large, and unlike most other earbuds; so, I had to get used to the too-large hard plastic rings jammed in my ears. At the same time, they were also very insecure; they are some of the only earbuds I’ve ever tested that have fallen out accidentally. I don’t know if this is because they’re too big for my ears, or if they’d fall out even more easily if they were smaller.\nThe hard-plastic ring could also be at fault here, as its surface doesn’t allow for much traction. The buds must be firmly wedged into your ear, with a silicone flange of the replaceable cover slipping into the outer scoop of your inner ear. Every time I got it settled, the buds would gradually work their way out again, so I was constantly reseating them so they wouldn't fall out. To make matters worse, this affects sound quality, so you only get to enjoy a few minutes of optimal sound quality before they slip out of alignment.\nThe driver holes in the hard plastic ring are effectively earwax scoops, which further affects sound quality because they quickly become corroded. Normally, the silicone ear tips of traditional in-ear buds would take the brunt of the wax exposure, and those are easy to clean. However, the driver holes of the LinkBuds Open require delicacy when cleaning.\nFundamentally, though, comfort is the biggest problem. After a week of regular use (I wear earbuds for long periods of time on a daily basis), I had to take an extended break from using them at all. As I’m typing out this review, my ears are still aching from the previous day’s use. Just to be clear, I checked very carefully to ensure the buds were perfectly positioned, but it seems they just don’t fit me quite right.\nAlternative fitting supporters are available upon request, so the issue of a secure fit may be solved that way, and maybe comfort as well. However, I don’t believe it’s possible to improve the issue of comfort, as it’s the hard in-ear piece (that can’t be altered) causing the problem. This is in stark contrast to alternative open earbuds such as the Shokz OpenFit; the over-ear design is more readily adaptable to a wider range of ears. The OpenFit and other open earbuds like it also don't suffer from earwax accumulation like the LinkBuds Open does.\n[Read our review ](/shokz-openfit-earbuds-r/)\nOn the software side, Sony’s Connect app seems dated, offering a rather clunky user experience. Worse, I found the initial setup process buggy with setting up 360 spatial sound. 360 spatial sound is cool in concept, and I could see the advantage from the sample provided during the setup process, but it requires a paid subscription with a compatible music streaming service to play optimized music. While a free trial with one of several such services is provided with the earbuds, I could not get it to activate and connect. If you have a compatible Sony Bravia TV, 360 Spatial Sound will also work with that.\nUnreliable on-bud controls are another major issue I have with the LinkBuds Open. I’m not used to play/pause being a double-tap action, and I could only get these touch controls to activate about 50% of the time. They can also be controlled by voice commands or on the connected device. Furthermore, at $200 the LinkBuds Open are on the pricey side compared to comparable buds.\nShould you buy them?\nWhile I certainly appreciate the concept behind the LinkBuds Pro, the execution of that concept sadly misses the mark. I love the audio quality and the advantages offered by open buds. This includes not having them hooked over my ears like other open buds (which appeals to glasses-wearers like me).\nHowever, the issues I encountered with the LinkBuds Pro make them difficult to recommend. If you are considering them, I advise you to find a way to try them out before you commit to purchasing them, as whether you love or hate them is entirely dependent on whether they fit your ears.\nI tested several different earbuds in comparison to the LinkBuds Open, and the first alternative I’d suggest was actually provided to me by Sony, in addition to the LinkBuds Open. The Sony LinkBuds Fit are more traditional, closed-back earbuds, but have a similar design to the LinkBuds Open.\nThey have the same interchangeable silicone cover and a similar sound profile, but unlike the open version, were comfortable and secure in my ears. At that same $200 price point they are still kind of expensive, but they are very good. If you’re looking for an open-ear alternative, I highly recommend the Shockz OpenFit. They use the slightly less convenient ear-hoop design but are otherwise superior in every way.\nI really wanted to like the Sony LinkBuds Open. In theory, they might have been the perfect earbud. Unfortunately, they turned out to be a poor fit for me.\nSony LinkBuds Open\nThe Sony LinkBuds Open are in-ear earbuds with an open-back design that lets sound in naturally through donut-shaped drivers.

    "text": "Windows’ longtime email manager integrated into Windows, the Mail app, is being phased out by Microsoft. While this move encourages Outlook adoption, many with email accounts will be happier with alternative choices. We take a look at three alternative standouts.\n1. Microsoft Outlook Microsoft’s flagship email client is the primary reason for retiring the Mail app. Outlook offers:\nSeamless Integration: It works perfectly well in the window ecosystem. Rich Features: Bent includes a built in calendar, task manager and support for multiple accounts. Flexible Access: You can use the desktop application as well as web version for your benefits. Users who want an all in one email management tool look no further than Outlook. Download here .\n2. Mozilla Thunderbird An open source, popular alternative to Microsoft’s email solutions. Thunderbird is known for:\nCross-Platform Availability: Email management from the desktop and the mobile. Customizability: Themes, extensions and advanced settings. Synchronization: It syncs multiple accounts to provide you with one email experience. It’s a favorite with those who want versatility because of its user-friendly interface. Download Thunderbird .\n3. Nylas Mail For users seeking a modern, open-source email client, Nylas Mail stands out:\nPlugin Support: It is up to you to customize your experience with add-ons. Email Tracking: Rarities in free email clients. Developer-Friendly: Furthermore, it is open source design, meaning you can further tweak it. To explore Nylas Mail’s potential, download Nylas Mail from its GitHub page. Get Nylas Mail .\nWhy is the Mail App disappearing, or leaving? The reason people aren’t using Mail is because Microsoft is pushing Outlook significantly, which provides a more rich and integrated experience. But that might make life a little difficult for folks who like the simplicity of Mail.\nSo How Can You Decide Which Option To Choose? Outlook: For Windows users who want to get the most out of all features in your Gmail account, especially those with deep integration and advanced tools. Thunderbird: Ideal for people looking for a customizable open sourced email client. Nylas Mail: Great feature for people who want plugins and more modern features such as email tracking. Use these alternatives and you won’t miss the outgoing Mail app, and never again will you have to go cold turkey on either Outlook’s power or Thunderbird’s pleasant simplicity. Tell us which one works best for you!",

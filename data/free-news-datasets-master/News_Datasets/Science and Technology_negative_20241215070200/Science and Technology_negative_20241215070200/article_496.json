None of the industry experts we approached were able to give us any real insight on how well these AI boxes are selling compared with plain old PCs, or whether they are getting any traction with buyers.\nIn one sense, this doesn't really matter, since it is likely you won't be able to buy any computer that isn't AI-enabled before long. Recent forecasts estimate that such systems may account for 43 percent of PCs by 2025, and go on to make up the bulk of the market by 2026.\nHowever, a look at the figures shows that Canalys is counting Macs in its AI-capable data, and these account for about half (47 percent) of all shipments, meaning that about 7 million Windows AI boxes were let loose into the channel during Q3.\nWhat is an AI-capable PC anyway?

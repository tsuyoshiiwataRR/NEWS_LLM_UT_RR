    "text": "Something in the AI plugin has broken the Discourse app: I realised that all topic are not deletable (500 Internal Server Error). In the admin panel of AI plugin, the tab “LLM”, “Personas” and “Tools” are disappeared, so I cannot delete my LLM model. I have removed the automation related to the toxic topics, disabled the AI plugin, disabled the Automation plugin, but the problem still persists. Then I deleted the AI plugin row from app.yml and destroyed/rebuilded/started the app, but the problem still persists. We took a look in the postgres db and there are still some tables about AI plugin.\nHere are some details about 500 error when we try to delete topic or post:\nArgumentError (Empty list of attributes

persists after removing a plugin, it is not caused by it.\nCan you share more details about how did you install Discourse? What version are you running? This errors are still happening after a rebuild?\nFrom the logs it appears that the installation is corrupted and missing files, so we need more information to help you.\nHi, thank for your help.\nPost.find(<#ID>).destroy\nIf we try to edit or move post/topic everything works fine.\nHere’s the plugin list if it could be useful\n- git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-oauth2-basic.git - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-openid-connect.git - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-saml.git - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-post-voting.git - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-solved.git - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-docs.git - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-chat-integration.git #- git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-ai.git - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-math.git - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-tooltips.git #- git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-jira.git - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-category-experts.git - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-topic-voting.git - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-assign.git - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-templates.git - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-translator.git - git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse-gamification.git\nIn the last rebuild ai and jira are commented out but those errors are still happening",

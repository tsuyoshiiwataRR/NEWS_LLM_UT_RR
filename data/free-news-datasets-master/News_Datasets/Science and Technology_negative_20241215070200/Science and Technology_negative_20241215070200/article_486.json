    "text": "Microsoft Edge has definitely come a long way, slowly adding new features and capabilities that make it a competitive choice among browsers.\nWith tools like an AI assistant and boasting a streamlined design, Edge is Microsoft’s bold step toward delivering a fully integrated browser experience for Windows users.\nBut the company’s relentless push to make it your go-to browser has some users questioning just how far Microsoft will go.\nMicrosoft Edge is a solid browser, and it’s been at the heart of Microsoft’s push to improve browsing experiences, working hard to establish itself as a viable alternative to Google Chrome. The company’s tried everything from hints to straight-up in-your-face tactics to persuade Windows users to try Edge. While not all strategies have been successful, Microsoft is not giving up and is constantly looking for new ways to increase the number of Edge users.\nThe latest? Edge now automatically launches when you start up your computer and constantly prompts you to bring over your Chrome data, like browsing history, bookmarks, open tabs, and more.\nRecently, The Verge noticed that when you boot up your PC, Edge might pop open and hit you with a prompt promoting its AI assistant, Copilot. Alongside this pop-up, there’s a pre-checked box that lets Edge automatically pull in data from other browsers like Chrome. Understandably, this tactic has stirred up frustration over how aggressively Microsoft is pushing its products.\nMicrosoft has openly acknowledged that this is intentional. It claims users can opt out, but the default settings and that prominent import button are not easy to ignore, making it tricky for users to sidestep the data transfer if they’re not paying close attention before clicking.\nEven if you manage to close the pop-ups, Edge doesn’t give up so easily. Uninstalling the browser isn’t straightforward, and some Windows updates will just reinstall it automatically — definitely frustrating for users who prefer other options.\nThe prompts appeared earlier this year but were removed after Microsoft rolled the feature back. Now, it’s made a return. Microsoft’s Caitlin Roulston told The Verge that the notification is just there to offer users “the choice to import data from other browsers.”\nMicrosoft has been using strong persuasive tactics to promote Edge for a while now. Back in 2022, it introduced a feature that would automatically pull data from Chrome to Edge (at least it was optional then). And in 2021, it even made it almost impossible to set another browser as default, a move that caused enough backlash for the company to eventually dial it back.\nMicrosoft’s persistence with these types of tactics isn’t doing its reputation any favours. Many users are starting to question the trustworthiness of Edge, Windows 11, and even Microsoft’s broader AI efforts. The controversy around intrusive prompts should signal to Microsoft that these aggressive Edge pop-ups in Windows 11 could make it hard for people to commit to its AI-driven plans for the platform.\n(Photo by appshunter.io )\nSee also: Google reportedly plans first US tech data centre in Vietnam\nWant to learn more about cybersecurity and the cloud from industry leaders?

We are having trouble logging into the PayPal App on our Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S20+ 5G). It is forever stuck on the following screen:\nWe have done the following to try and fix this:\n1. Clear the App Cache and Storage on our phone.\n2. Update the App.\n3. Uninstalled and reinstalled the App.\n4. Cleared all cookies and cache on the browser (Brave).\n5. Tried a different browser as the default.\n6. Restarted the phone.\n7. Turned off and turned on the phone.\n8. Tried to reinstall and login in with WiFi on, Wifi off, VPN on, VPN off, and all combinations thereof.\nEvery time we log in, we enter the username, the password, and go through an Authenticator for 2FA.\nAnd every time, it's stuck on that lading screen forever.\nPayPal Tech Support doesn't seem able to help. Is there anything we may be missing?\nThanks in advance!\n- Labels:\n-\n[Mobile](/t5/forums/filteredbylabelpage/board-id/ProductsandServices/label-name/mobile)\n[Login to Me Too](/plugins/common/feature/oauth2sso/sso_login_redirect?dest_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal-community.com%2F)\nKrytical\n[Options](#)\n- Mark as New\n- Bookmark\n- Subscribe\n- Mute\nhttps://www.paypal-community.com/rss/message?board.id=ProductsandServices&message.id=32970 [Permalink](/t5/Products-Services/PayPal-Android-App-stuck-on-loading-The-circle-spins-forever-and/m-p/3093426/highlight/true#M32970)[Print](/t5/forums/forumtopicprintpage/board-id/ProductsandServices/message-id/32970/print-single-message/true/page/1) [Report Inappropriate Content](/t5/notifications/notifymoderatorpage/message-uid/3093426)\nWanted to respond with I'm also having the same issue, even tried on another phone. Was working fine on my older device but im assuming because it was logged in before whatever bug has popped up recently, but traded that phone in for this current phone. Tried all your steps as well, love brave but know it can be finicky so originally thought it was that. Hoping this gets fixed soon.\n[Login to Me Too](/plugins/common/feature/oauth2sso/sso_login_redirect?dest_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal-community.com%2F)\nPayPal_JonK\n[Options](#)\n- Mark as New\n- Bookmark\n- Subscribe\n- Mute\nhttps://www.paypal-community.com/rss/message?board.id=ProductsandServices&message.id=32971 [Permalink](/t5/Products-Services/PayPal-Android-App-stuck-on-loading-The-circle-spins-forever-and/m-p/3093524/highlight/true#M32971)[Print](/t5/forums/forumtopicprintpage/board-id/ProductsandServices/message-id/32971/print-single-message/true/page/1) [Report Inappropriate Content](/t5/notifications/notifymoderatorpage/message-uid/3093524)\nHello everyone! Welcome! Thanks for visiting PayPal's Community Forum. I'm sorry to hear you've run into some issues using PayPal's mobile app. I'd be happy to try to point you in the right direction.\nHi (/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/14870104), thanks for letting us know everything you've tried and for providing that screenshot. With everything you've provided, I'd recommend removing any VPN software, third party browsers, as well as any other third party software blocking your location or masking your identity. You'll also want to use the default application downloader to download the PayPal app and default browser if necessary. If you're still running into issues after that, you may want to try using a different device to try to log into PayPal.\nBest wishes!\n- Jon K\nIf you find this or any other post was helpful, make our community better by giving kudos or accepting it as a solution.\n[Login to Me Too](/plugins/common/feature/oauth2sso/sso_login_redirect?dest_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal-community.com%2F)\nMAWFI\n[Options](#)\n- Mark as New\n- Bookmark\n- Subscribe\n- Mute\nhttps://www.paypal-community.com/rss/message?board.id=ProductsandServices&message.id=34394 [Permalink](/t5/Products-Services/PayPal-Android-App-stuck-on-loading-The-circle-spins-forever-and/m-p/3102962/highlight/true#M34394)[Print](/t5/forums/forumtopicprintpage/board-id/ProductsandServices/message-id/34394/print-single-message/true/page/1) [Report Inappropriate Content](/t5/notifications/notifymoderatorpage/message-uid/3102962)\nHello - we tried everything you suggested and get in a \"you're approved\" loop.\nAny suggestions?\n[Login to Me Too](/plugins/common/feature/oauth2sso/sso_login_redirect?dest_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal-community.com%2F)\nPayPal_Olivia\n[Options](#)\n- Mark as New\n- Bookmark\n- Subscribe\n- Mute\nhttps://www.paypal-community.com/rss/message?board.id=ProductsandServices&message.id=34445 [Permalink](/t5/Products-Services/PayPal-Android-App-stuck-on-loading-The-circle-spins-forever-and/m-p/3103480/highlight/true#M34445)[Print](/t5/forums/forumtopicprintpage/board-id/ProductsandServices/message-id/34445/print-single-message/true/page/1) [Report Inappropriate Content](/t5/notifications/notifymoderatorpage/message-uid/3103480)\nHi [@MAWFI](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/14916213),\nThank you for your post!

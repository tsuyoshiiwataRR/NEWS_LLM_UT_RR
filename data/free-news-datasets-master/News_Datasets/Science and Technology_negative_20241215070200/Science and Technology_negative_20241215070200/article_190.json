    "text": "Some Cybertrucks recalled over drive inverter The Tesla Cybertruck is seeing another recall after reports have risen regarding the vehicle's inverter, whose malfunction could increase the risk of a crash.\nThe Brief Certain Tesla's Cybertrucks are being recalled over drive inverters that, if malfunctions, could increase the risk of a crash Thousands of Cybertrucks are impacted by the recall According to TechCrunch, this is the sixth recall for the trucks that launched just under a year ago The Tesla Cybertruck is seeing another recall after reports of the vehicle&apos;s inverter malfunctioning and increasing the risk of a crash.\nThe issue lies with the Cybertruck&apos;s drive inverter for trucks produced between November 2023 and July 30, 2024.\nAffected trucks could see an issue with torque production due to the faulty drive inverter. In these cases, the driver may experience a loss of power to their wheels, which could increase the risk of a collision, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nAt least 2,431 cars are affected, the agency said.\nIn a news release, Tesla said the loss of torque results in a loss of propulsion, and in these cases, drivers will not have prior warning.\nHowever, once the driver loses the ability to torque, they will receive a visual alert on the truck&apos;s user interface, prompting them to pull over and contact roadside assistance.\nThe NHTSA said Tesla&apos;s investigation into the drive inverter began over the summer when the Austin-based company received a customer complaint about the sudden loss of propulsion in their Cybertruck.\nTesla said the recall, first announced on Nov. 5, is voluntary. Tesla also said they will replace the drive inverter for free for all impacted owners.\nOwners can also expect a letter from the electric vehicle company in January about the recall and the suggested replacement.\nTesla said there have been no known collisions, injuries, or fatal crashes stemming from the failure of the drive inverter.\nAccording to TechCrunch , this recall is the company&apos;s sixth for the Cybertruck, which launched less than a year ago.\nIn October, over 27,000 Cybertrucks were recalled because of a delay in the rearview camera that could impact driver visibility, and in June, some trucks were recalled because of a sticky accelerator pedal, the technology-based news outlet said.\nKTVU reached out to Tesla for a statement over the latest recall and is awaiting comment.\nDrivers who want to see if their car is affected by the recall can search with their VIN here .\nThis story was reported out of Oakland, Calif.\nThe source Information for this report was gathered from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Tesla.\nDAILY NEWSLETTER All the news you need to know, every day\nBy clicking Sign Up, I confirm that I have read and agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service .",

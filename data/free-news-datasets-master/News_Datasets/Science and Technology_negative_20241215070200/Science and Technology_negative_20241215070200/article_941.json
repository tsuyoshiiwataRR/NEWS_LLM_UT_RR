    "text": "We’re here 24/7. 365 days a year.\nAsk questions. Find your answers. Connect.\nTuesday\nI joined TalkTalk in April and every day the wifi drops out. I can watch TV and it switches off. I have tested it and followed the instructions constantly to test the line and switch everything off for 20 minutes and re connect - but it keeps happening. Every day.\n3 hours ago\nHi [@Donna2569](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/747828)\nI cannot help you on someone else's thread. If you would like to create your own one & @mention me into it, I would be able to help you from there. It could well be WiFi interference or various other issues. I can help check this out, never buy extra hardware when you may not need to.\nTo create your own thread, go to the main page for the board in question & click the \"Start a topic\" button.\nTalkTalk insists on one thread per problem per customer. Please note, TalkTalk makes the rules, not me.\nThanks.\nKeith\nI am not employed by TalkTalk, I'm just a customer. If my post has fixed the issue, please set Accept as Solution from the 3 dot menu.TalkTalk support and Community Stars - Who are they?\n3 hours ago\nHi keith\nwe too suffer from this - we have an eero 6 and since installation it invariably drops out on some devises although always shows strong signal strength and is always fine when you run a health check?! We were thinking of adding an extender (£99) to see if this helps but after reading your comments am wondering if there is another issue that may be causing the problem?\n8 hours ago\nMorning,\nHow are you getting on?\nThanks\nMichelle\nTuesday\nWhich make/model of router do you have?\nSlow speed, intermittent dropouts, breaks in the signal or no signal on some or all devices or no internet access might be caused by Wi-Fi interference from other local networks, which can also lead to a permanent reduction in speed. No ISP can be responsible for your local environment, this is mainly a byproduct of the popularity of Wi-Fi.\nHowever, other factors should be investigated first. When this happens, what are the lights showing on the front of the router? Do you have any wired connections & if so, how do they perform?\nGenerally speaking, the 2.4GHz band suffers a lot more from interference than the much faster 5GHz band, but the 2.4GHz one can sometimes have a better range, but this all depends on your local area.\nIn other words, I try to help you optimise your Wi-Fi connection. The next stage involves sending out a guide to you to help you get me some important diagnostic results so that I can analyse them for you and recommend changes to your router configuration to solve them.\nI only send this out to people who request it.\nThe information below is provided by TalkTalk, for confirmation please contact [@Debbie-TalkTalk](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3838) or[@Michelle-TalkTalk](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3837).\nKeithFrench is one of our valued Community Stars and can help with a range of issues related to wireless and networking. At times he may ask you to send him test results via a Private Message to help analyse/diagnose an issue. Although Keith does not work for TalkTalk, he very kindly shares his time and knowledge to help with others.\nIf you need further help or, if we need to take any details such as personal information about your account like phone numbers, account numbers etc. one of the TalkTalk team will jump in and help out.\nKeith\nI am not employed by TalkTalk, I'm just a customer.

    "text": "The countdown for Samsung’s previously delayed One UI 7 beta version has begun. Reliable industry sources suggest the update will be released on November 17, but the latest reports may cause some frustration for users participating in the beta tests.\nOne UI 7 Beta May Be Bug-Filled\nWhile the primary goal of beta updates is to detect and fix bugs, according to industry leakster Ice Universe, the number of bugs in the update might be higher than expected. The source claims that even the latest One UI 7 beta update, which ends with XKB, contains numerous issues, particularly with animations and other areas.\nIn fact, the latest beta version reportedly introduced new issues that weren’t present in previous builds, and the manufacturer has been working overtime to resolve these bugs, which has led to delays. Despite the leaks about the November 17 release date, Samsung has not yet confirmed when the beta tests will actually begin. The stable version is expected to be released early next year.\nSamsung’s Upcoming Foldable Phones Samsung is developing three foldable phones, which are expected to compete with Huawei’s Mate XT. What features do these devices promise?\nGalaxy S24 Series to Get One UI 7.0 Beta First The Galaxy S24 series will be the first models to receive the One UI 7.0 beta update.

    "text": "This November 15, a change in the privacy policies of artificial intelligence. The modification, which has not been communicated directly to users, coincides with the acceleration of X member registrations in Bluesky, a very similar operating network but based on a decentralized protocol.\nPODCAST | Elon Musk, story of the man without limits\n“If you continue to use our products or services after November 15, 2024, you will be accepting the updated terms of service and privacy policy,” the social network owned by Elon Musk notified in a blog post published in October.\nThe new chapter of the Privacy Policy called “third party collaborators” . “Depending on your settings, or if you choose to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties,” the modified text breaks down: “If you do not opt ​​out, in some cases recipients of the information may use it for their own purposes. independent, other than those set out in X’s privacy policy, including, for example, to train its artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.\nTo deactivate the sending of personal data collected by X to third companies for these purposes, it is necessary to deactivate this option from the app’s configuration panel. In the section “Privacy and security” There is a section called “Data Sharing and Personalization.” Within the latter, it is necessary to go to “ Data shared with business partners ” and deactivate the tab referring to special data transfers that can be derived from AI training.\nIt should be noted that this does not completely cancel the sending of any data to other companies, since “X always shares information with business partners so that its products work and can be improved,” as the social network explains in said section. Disabling the tab only affects “additional information” that can be used to feed the databases of generative algorithms.\nX is also using its users’ data to train its own AI, Grok, which is only available to paying members. However, it can also be disabled. The tab for this is also found in the “Privacy and security” section of the app, within the last section, called “Grok” .\nDespite frequently warning about the risks of AI, Elon Musk is one of the figures who has ventured the most into the business of virtual assistants based on this technology. She was on the founding team of OpenAI, developer of ChatGPT. After finding himself out of the company due to incompatibilities with his role at Tesla, he founded XAI, the creator of Grok.\nHis assistant wants to differentiate himself from the rest by making greater use of humor and sarcasm. As Musk explained, Grok is inspired by characters like Jarvis from iron man or Marvin from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and claims that it offers entertaining and “rebellious” answers.\nAll of these technologies are based on content uploaded by users to the Internet for years for training. On this occasion, the new policies have coincided with the transfer of users from X to Bluesky, whose business model avoids collecting personal data from users. This Thursday the platform, which in less than a year open to the general public has gained 16 million users, added a record of more than one million registrations in 24 hours.\nelDiario.es is now on Bluesky, you can follow us here\n#begins #selling #user #data #train #artificial #intelligence #flight #Bluesky",

    "text": "It’s still cheaper — and more profitable — than ad-free!\nWhen I\n[last looked](https://sherwood.news/tech/netflix-ad-tier-subscriptions-arpu-value/) at streaming subscription prices this summer, it had been getting more expensive to stream without ads, as companies like [Netflix](https://robinhood.com/us/en/stocks/NFLX/), [Disney](https://robinhood.com/us/en/stocks/DIS/), and [Warner Bros.’](https://robinhood.com/us/en/stocks/WBD/) hoped to push consumers to their lower-cost but [often more profitable](https://sherwood.news/business/netflix-and-the-other-streaming-companies-want-you-to-watch-ads/) ad tiers.\nSince then, many of these companies have raised their rates — particularly on ad-supported subs. Hulu went up $2 to $9.99 per month for ads and just $1 to $18.99 for ad-free. It was the same situation for Paramount+, whose ad price grew to $7.99 from $5.99, while ad-free went to $12.99 from $11.99. Meanwhile, Disney+ and Peacock raised their prices $2 for both ad-supported and ad-free tiers.\nWhat’s going on? First off: they can. Second off: even if they raise rates on ad-supported subscriptions, those prices are still cheaper than ad-free. So raising prices on ad-free tiers, even if it’s less of a raise than on ad tiers, will still push people to the ultimately cheaper ad tiers, which are more profitable than ad-free.\nHere’s Disney CEO Bob Iger saying just that:\n“It’s not just about raising pricing. It’s about moving consumers to the advertiser-supported side of the streaming platform,” he said after\n[today’s earnings report](https://sherwood.news/culture/disney-earnings-beat-thanks-to-sequels/). “The pricing that we recently put into place, which is increased pricing, was actually designed to move more people in the AVOD direction,” or advertising-based video on demand, “because we know the ARPU and interest in it from advertisers and streaming has grown.”\nAbout 60% of all new subscribers chose the ad-supported plan. Some 37% of total subscribers in the US currently subscribe to that tier. Disney reported a streaming profit — $321 million in Q4 up from $47 million in Q3 — for its second quarter in a row.\nTrump’s win sparked a 1,514% surge in Americans searching for how to leave the country, permanently. A burgeoning industry is here to help — for a six-figure price.\nOf those who canceled their streaming service in the prior year, 34.2% rejoined in 2024, according to data from subscription-analytics provider Antenna published in\n[The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/a-new-streaming-customer-emerges-the-subscription-pauser-430a4eef). That’s up from 29.8% in 2022. In other words, more people are pausing rather than truly [canceling](https://sherwood.news/power/ftc-canceling-your-subscriptions-just-got-easier/) their streaming subscriptions. Call it the “Succession” phenomenon, in which consumers turn off and on their services based on what’s airing or what sports are in season. But as streaming subscriptions get [more expensive](https://sherwood.news/business/steadily-rising-subscription-prices-are-boiling-consumers-like-frogs/), especially if you [don’t want ads](https://sherwood.news/business/netflix-and-the-other-streaming-companies-want-you-to-watch-ads/), people are becoming more likely to turn them on and off.\nNew data from the National Association of Realtors, cited by our colleagues at\n[Snacks](https://sherwood.news/snacks/power/us-homebuyers-are-older-and-wealthier-than-ever-as-campaigns-promise-housing/), found that the median age of first-time homebuyers in the US is now 38 — up from last year’s 35 and marking the highest recorded age from data going back to 1981.\nRocketing house prices, still-high mortgage rates, and limited inventory all make owning a home an\n[increasingly expensive](https://sherwood.news/personal-finance/home-ownership-required-median-income-american-dream-unachievable/) part of the American dream.\nThe same NAR report also outlined that the median age of repeat buyers has soared to 61 years (nearly a third of whom paid with cash for their follow-up homes), while the median age of buyers overall has rocketed to 56 years, +44% from just two decades prior.\nThese factors indicate the growing prevalence of a “renter generation,” with fewer than one in four of all homes bought by first-timers. Even so, rent prices are still far outpacing wages in most major US cities: according to\n[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/31/hourly-wage-needed-to-comfortably-afford-rent-in-15-large-us-cities.html), the average hourly wage required to afford a one-bedroom dwelling is almost 3x the minimum wage in New York, 2.3x Los Angeles’ min wage, and 2.1x Chicago’s.\nThe same NAR report also outlined that the median age of repeat buyers has soared to 61 years (nearly a third of whom paid with cash for their follow-up homes), while the median age of buyers overall has rocketed to 56 years, +44% from just two decades prior.\nThese factors indicate the growing prevalence of a “renter generation,” with fewer than one in four of all homes bought by first-timers.

    "text": "The Heartbreaking Story Of Laika, The First-Ever Space Dog Who Never Returned To Earth The limited technology and research at the time prevented humans from taking the journey to space. Thus, animals were chosen as subjects by the Soviet Union scientists. Many of us are aware that Neil Armstrong was the first man to land on the moon in 1969. However, few know about the first living being to orbit Earth. A dog named Laika was the first living creature to orbit our planet and experience space flight. While it was a significant landmark at the time, it came with a tragic ending. Laika’s flight to space came at a socio-political time when the Soviet Union was in tough competition with America over scientific achievements. After the success of Sputnik, Soviet Union leader Nikita Khrushchev wanted to register a significant landmark for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. The limited technology and research at the time prevented humans from taking the journey to space. Thus, animals were chosen as subjects by the scientists. As a result, the three-year-old part-samoyed, part-terrier dog Laika was scooped up from the streets of Moscow and promptly trained for the trip. The dog’s preparation included getting used to eating jellied food and spinning in a centrifuge in order to accustom it to gravitational changes. Laika’s journey to space became an international story on November 3, 1957. As per reports, it was never intended for Laika to return to Earth alive, with Soviet authorities claiming the dog survived for six to seven days before dying from lack of oxygen. However, the real reason for her death was later revealed in 2002 when Russian scientist Dimitri Malashenkov noted that Laika had only lived for five to seven hours after entering space. He proposed that the dog died from overheating. This theory was backed by NASA scientists who believed that the spacecraft may have overheated due to a combination of a faulty thermal control system and insulation tearing off during launch. Laika never returned to Earth, with her remains getting destroyed upon re-entry into our atmosphere on 14 April 1958. Despite Laika’s tragic death, the Soviet scientists’ plans to experiment with sending dogs into space did not end. They achieved success with Belka and Strelka which became the first living organisms to successfully orbit Earth and return back alive in 1960. - Location : - First Published:",

    "text": "Global diabetes rate has doubled in the last 30 years, new study reveals\nThe percentage of adults suffering from\n[diabetes](https://www.tag24.com/lifestyle/health) across the world has doubled over the past three decades with the biggest rises coming from developing countries, a [study](https://www.tag24.com/science) said Wednesday.\nThe serious health condition affected around 14% of all adults worldwide in 2022 compared to 7% in 1990, according to\n[the new analysis](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02317-1/fulltext) in The Lancet journal.\nTaking into account the growing global population, the team of researchers estimated that more than 800 million people are now diabetic compared to less than 200 million in 1990.\nThese figures include both main types of diabetes.\nType 1 affects patients from a young age and is more difficult to treat because it is caused by an insulin deficiency.\nType 2 mainly affects middle-aged or older people who lose their sensitivity to insulin.\nBehind the global numbers, national figures varied widely.\nThe rate of diabetes stayed the same or even fell in some wealthier countries, such as Japan and Canada or in Western European nations such as France and Denmark, the study said.\n\"The burden of diabetes and untreated diabetes is increasingly borne by low-income and middle-income countries,\" it added.\nFor example, nearly a third of women in Pakistan are now diabetic, compared to less than a tenth in 1990.\nThe researchers emphasized that obesity is an \"important driver\" of type 2 diabetes – as is an unhealthy diet.\nDiabetes treatment gap widening in richer vs poorer countries\nThe gap between how diabetes is treated in richer and poorer countries is also widening.\nThree out of five people aged over 30 with diabetes – 445 million adults – did not receive treatment for diabetes in 2022, the researchers estimated.\nIndia alone was home to almost a third of that number.\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, only 5 - 10% of adults with diabetes received treatment in 2022.\nSome developing countries such as Mexico are doing well in treating their population -- but overall the global gap is widening, they said.\n\"This is especially concerning as people with diabetes tend to be younger in low-income countries and, in the absence of effective treatment, are at risk of life-long complications,\" said senior study author Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London.\nThose complications include \"amputation, heart disease, kidney damage or vision loss – or in some cases, premature death,\" he said in a statement.\nCover photo: Unsplash/Matt C",

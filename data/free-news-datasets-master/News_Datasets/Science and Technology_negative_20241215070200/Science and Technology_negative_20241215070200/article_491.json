    "text": "\\nMany users reported that Chrome Remote Desktop is blocked by the admin and that they can\\u2019t use it to connect to a remote device. This can be a problem, but there are a few ways you can fix it.\n\\n What can I do if Chrome Remote Desktop is blocked by admin? \\n 1. Change your settings \\n \\n Locate the group that is having trouble accessing Chrome Remote Desktop in the Admin console. \\n Open the group settings. \\n Change the setting that indicates that all users are over 18. \\n Alternatively, you can make a new group and label all users over 18. \\n Save changes. \\n \\nKeep in mind that this method works only if you\\u2019re the system administrator.\n\\n 2. Toggle access to additional services \\n\n\\n \\n Open Admin console. \\n Next, go to Additional Google Services .\n\\xa0 \\n Set Access to additional services without individual control for all organizational units is turned to On .\n\\n \\n\n\\nIf Chrome Remote Desktop is blocked by the admin, then the only way to enable it is to contact the administrator and ask them to remove the restriction.\n\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re an admin, you can try the solutions from above and they should help you restore this functionality to users.\n\\nThis isn\\u2019t the only issue, many reported that Chrome Remote Desktop is not working for them. If you never used this feature before, go ahead and download Chrome Remote Desktop for Windows 11 and take it for a test run.\n\\n",

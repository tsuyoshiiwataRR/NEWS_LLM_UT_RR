    "text": "November 12, 2024: The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that petitioners have the right to challenge the CDC’s claim that the COVID-19 injections are ‘safe and effective vaccines,’ because the shots don’t protect against infection or transmission.\nShare\nPer Jacobson vs. Massachusetts (the landmark trial that established the legally binding criteria for vaccines), vaccines must be proven to prevent infection and transmission (provide immunity) , otherwise they are just palliative treatments to alleviate symptoms and not vaccines.\nContent of this article is copyright of Karen Kingston, The Kingston Report.\nI created this image to visually explain what a palliative treatment for the flu is (reducing fever, aches, and chills). Advil is a palliative treatment. Palliative treatments reduce or eliminate symptoms, but do not address the underlying cause of a disease or infection. Share this valuable and FREE Kingston Report!\nShare\nThis past June, Health Freedom Defense Fund argued and won (convinced) the 9th Circuit judges that the COVID-19 injections were neither safe, nor effective vaccines .\nNew CDC Campaign Promotes Flu Vaccines as a Treatment for Flu Symptoms and NOT for Immunity Against Infection or Transmission\nNow that the CDC has been caught worldwide misrepresenting the COVID-19 injections as ‘safe and effective vaccines’, the federal agency is apparently openly promoting the flu vaccines as treatments for symptom relief from the flu and not as vaccines that provide immunity.\nSubscribe Check Out These Ridiculous CDC Flu Vaccine Ads\nI wonder if the CDC’s Monkeypox Czar, Demetre Daskalakis, was heavily involved in the creative direction of the CDC Flu Vaccine Campaign due to the frequent use of images of cats, kittens, and unicorns.\nShare\nAn Opportunistic Play on Peanut’s Tragic Death?\nDemetre Daskalakis and the CDC debuted this ad on their X feeds on November 6, 2024, just a few days after social media blew-up covering the story of how Peanut, a pet squirrel, was seized by NY State officials from the upstate home and animal rescue ranch of Mark Longo and then killed.\nShare\nI get converting wild cats to house kittens or a rhino to a toy unicorn to convey the message of ‘wild to mild’ , but what does a moose have to do with a squirrel? Does the CDC not know that squirrels are wild animals? Seems like an opportunistic play on Peanut’s tragic death .\nDo The CDC Flu Vaccine Ads Matter?\nIn my opinion, yes. Any savvy BioPharma marketer knows that every word and every image in a campaign conveys a message and the FDA interprets and regulates every word and image used. Large wild animals and deadly insects portray severity of an illness’s symptoms and even death. Baby animals and stuffed animals represent harmlessness. IMO, these CDC ads are like a serial killer’s hidden confession notes.\nGain expert industry insights into the BioPharma industry. Subscribe to the Kingston Report today. TRUTH WINS.\nSubscribe Ironically, Flumist is using a grizzly bear to represent both the devastating effects of the flu and the (devastating) effects of the Flumist vaccine.\nFluMist is More Fierce Than the Flu: Causing Significantly Higher Rates of Hospitalization and Transmission Karen Kingston · Sep 24\nSeptember 24, 2024: On Friday, September 20, 2024, the FDA approved FluMist for self-administration by adults between the ages of 18-49, meaning you can ‘vaccinate’ yourself and your loved ones at home without the supervision of a medical professional.\nRead full story\nLong story short, the CDC is openly promoting that the COVID-19 injections aren’t the only vaccines that are neither safe , nor effective at preventing infection or transmission.\nIs the CDC hedging against the planned release of the H5N1 vaccines, knowing that these vaccines will receive full FDA approval without the review of any safety or efficacy data in humans or animals.\nFDA, CDC, NIH, & WHO Stockpile Vaccines for Global 2024-25 H5N1 Flu Pandemic Karen Kingston · Oct 24\nOctober 23, 2024: On October 10, 2024, members of the WHO, FDA, CDC, NIH, as well as U.S. infectious disease pediatricians, held a 6.5 hour meeting to discuss the current status and further development of vaccines for an emerging 2024-2025 H5N1 global flu pandemic\nRead full story\nBrett Hawes and I recently discussed the details of the US government’s H5N1 maniacal plans on Onward Podcast .\nThe Dark Plans of the CDC, FDA, and NIH\nFollowing the science involves the use of double-speak, double-think , and blatant lying to the American people.\nWe need to stop making excuses for some of the leaders of our nation’s 3-letter agencies who appear to have sociopathic tendencies and and are violating federal laws under the color of law, because they act as if they care about us and our children.\nProverbs 24-26 (MSG)\nYour enemy shakes hands and greets you like an old friend, all the while plotting against you.\nWhen he speaks warmly to you, don’t believe him for a minute. He’s just waiting for the chance to rip you off.\nNo matter how shrewdly he conceals his malice, eventually his evil will be exposed in public.\nThe Kingston Report.

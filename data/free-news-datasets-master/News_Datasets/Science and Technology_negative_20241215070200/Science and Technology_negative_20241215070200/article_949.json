    "text": "Shiba Inu price moved into a bear market, falling by over 20% from its highest level this week as the recent crypto bull run faded.\nShiba Inu ( SHIB ), the second-biggest meme coin in crypto, was trading at $0.000024 on Friday, Nov. 15, as most coins dropped. Bitcoin ( BTC ) remained below $90,000 as the recent bull run stalled.\nStill, there are signs that SHIB price will bounce back, and possibly retest its highest level this week at $0.00003045. For example, data from Shibburn shows that the Shiba Inu burn rate rose by 115% in the last 24 hours.\nOver 16.1 million coins were burned, meaning that 410 trillion have been burned since its inception, bringing the circulating supply to 583 trillion tokens. Token burns happen when cryptocurrencies are moved to an inaccessible address, reducing the number of those in circulation.\nAnother potential catalyst for Shiba Inu price is that the number of total addresses in Shibarium has jumped to over 1.89 million. If the trend continues rising, there is a likelihood that these addresses will rise to 2 million in the coming months.\nMeanwhile, the number of transactions completed in Shibarium has risen above 509 million in the past few months. This performance is notable since Shibarium is Shiba Inuâ€™s layer-2 blockchain network. Some of the BONE tokens collected in fees are moved into SHIB and burned.",

    "text": "The alleged design for Castorice in [Honkai: Star Rail](https://screenrant.com/tag/honkai-star-rail/) 3.2 has seemingly leaked and, while it looks like a completely new outfit, it does have uncomfortable similarities with the design of an existing character in HoYoverse’s turn-based RPG. Castorice is rumored to be one of the new characters being added to the game in Version 3.2 after the title enters its third year of content. With a rumored release for Version 3.2, the character should arrive months after the supposed release of Aglaea and [5-star Herta in Honkai: Star Rail 3.0](https://screenrant.com/honkai-star-rail-leaks-5-star-herta-promotion/). So far, little is actually known about Castorice. Rumors indicate she is also called Xiadie, though it is uncertain what will be her official name in English – there is a chance it will be neither. Furthermore, a compilation of leaks on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail_leaks/comments/1gowbhy/3x_character_info_compilation_updated_via/) mentions that Castorice will be a 5-star Quantum character who follows the Path of the Remembrance. The Remembrance is expected to become a new playable Path in Version 3.0 with the arrival of Aglaea and the Remembrance Trailblazer in Honkai: Star Rail, and Castorice is rumored to follow that new trend. Castorice’s Leaked Design In Honkai: Star Rail 3.2 Seems Similar To Fu Xuan Both Characters Share Uncanny Similarities While the gameplay aspects revolving around a character tend to be a lot more important to players than their actual designs, the visual of each unit also plays a part when players are deciding whether or not to pull for them from the gacha banners. The alleged design for Castorice in Version 3.2 has allegedly leaked, according to a sketch made by the leaker known as Seele Leaks. The image was shared in a post tagged as “Reliable” on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail_leaks/comments/1gphfc8/hsr_3x_xiadie_castorice_drawn_by_seeleleaks/). Castorice seems to have light skin, pointy ears, pink hair, and a pink and white dress in Honkai: Star Rail. [Related ](/honkai-star-rail-leaks-trailblazer-update-path-animations/) [ Honkai Star Rail Leaks: New Trailblazer Update Could Bring The Character Up To The Current Cosmetic Standard With Special Path Animations ](/honkai-star-rail-leaks-trailblazer-update-path-animations/) New details about an update to the Trailblazer in a future Honkai: Star Rail patch have emerged, including mentions of their fourth playable Path. Even though Castorice’s leaked design is elegant in its own manner, there is a troublesome similarity to Fu Xuan, an already existing character in the game. If the leak is true, both units have pink hair, a pink and white dress, head adornments, and long white sleeves. Castorice’s leaked design does have exclusive elements to make her distinguishable enough for Fu Xuan, but it simply looks like an alternative outfit for [Fu Xuan in Honkai: Star Rail](https://screenrant.com/honkai-star-rail-fu-xuan-builds-team-comps/) rather than a brand-new character, per si. Castorice’s Leaked Design In Honkai: Star Rail 3.2 Is Still Subject To Changes Version 3.2 Is Still Months Away The main issue with the leaked design seems to be its color palette, which is what most matches Fu Xuan’s existing design. If the colors were different, then, perhaps, Castorice’s leaked design would not look so much like the 5-star Preservation character. Of course, this is an early sketch based on leaks, so as detailed as the illustration may seem, there may be some inconsistencies with the final version. Furthermore, there is a big chance HoYoverse will continue to work on Castorice’s design over the upcoming months leading up to Honkai: Star Rail 3.2.

Of course, for now, leaks should be considered with caution. Even if the illustration is accurate, a lot of it is still subject to change. Additionally, the character may look very distinguishable from Fu Xuan once she is in the game and not just limited to an early sketch. The third year of content for Honkai: Star Rail is building up to be a promising one, especially due to the rumored changes to gameplay mechanics – and despite what seems like a redesigned character.",

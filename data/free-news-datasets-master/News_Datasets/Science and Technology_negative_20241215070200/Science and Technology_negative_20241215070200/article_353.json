    "text": "Trending: Microsoft To Face Investigation Over Anti-Competitive Practices In Cloud Market: Story In 5 Points According to reports, the FTC is also investigating claims Microsoft hiked subscription fees for customers who wanted to leave. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Photo : Twitter Tech giant Microsoft is reportedly facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for alleged anti-competitive tactics used by the company to maintain a dominant position in the cloud market. According to the Financial Times, FTC is looking into allegations that Microsoft imposed punitive licensing agreements to prevent customers from moving data off its platforms. 1. The investigation will focus on whether Microsoft's cloud offerings, including Azure, have been unfairly favoured through practices that harm competition or block rivals in the cloud market. 2. As per Financial Times sources, the federal agency is also investigating claims Microsoft hiked subscription fees for customers who wanted to leave, made its products incompatible with rivals, and charged steep exit fees. 3. Last year, the FTC sought public comment on major cloud providers’ business practices. Most commenters highlighted restrictive software licensing, minimum spend contracts, and high data transfer fees as areas of anticompetitive concern. 4. The report says that It is not yet clear how far the FTC’s investigation will progress. FTC chair Lina Khan’s tenure may end with the start of Donald Trump’s presidency. 5. Also, Microsoft has yet to comment on the investigation but is expected to defend its business practices as legitimate. Microsoft has faced increased scrutiny from international regulators, as well. In April, UK regulators said they were investigating recent separate artificial intelligence deals by Microsoft and Amazon over concerns the partnerships would crush competition. In July, Microsoft signed a $21 million deal with CISPE, a smaller European cloud service provider, to avoid an EU antitrust investigation.

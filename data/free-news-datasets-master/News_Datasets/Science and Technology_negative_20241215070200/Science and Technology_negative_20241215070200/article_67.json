    "text": "By Taylor Knight ,\n1 hours ago\nSorry to Android users — this one’s just for the iPhone owners.\nWho among us doesn’t find navigating an airport to be a stressful process — from finding gates to wondering if you’re at the correct baggage carousel, or staying updated with flight delays or early arrivals.\nGood news, then, from former airline employee Darby Maloney, who goes by @durbinmalonster on TikTok, who has revealed an Apple user-only travel hack that can make any journey a breeze.\nTravelers can get flight updates through text messages. Yuliia – stock.adobe.com “I never have to look at screens in the airport anymore,” Maloney, 28, teased her social media followers. “It’s the greatest hack ever and I think nobody knows about it.”\nHoliday travelers warned about fake TSA ‘scam’ that could bleed you dry\nIn the resurfaced clip, with over 25 million views , Maloney explains how she uses the hack when she’s ready to hit the jetway.\n@durbinmalonster S/O @Brooke Webster for teaching me this in my bag loading days 7 years ago\n♬ original sound – Darby See Also I’m a flight attendant — here’s how coach passengers can score a first class meal Passengers outraged after getting stuck in tony Delta Sky Club lounge: ‘We as a human race have lost our way’\nWhenever the content creator travels, she texts the flight number to herself and her family on the morning of her departure.\nOnce the message appears on any iPhone, you can click the hyperlinked number and select “Preview Flight.” It will then display real-time updates of your flight along with details on your baggage claim carousel. And that’s it.\n“You can just click your link and know exactly what your gate is so when you get off of the plane ― boom, you’re off to your connection,” Maloney added.\nYou can also view updates on gate changes and departure or arrival times. Although you can get this same information from the airline’s mobile app, some users prefer the text method because it’s easy to access.\n“I use this the most when somebody’s picking me up,” Maloney said in a follow-up TikTok video. “I’m not going to ask them to download the app … I’m just going to send them the link.”\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MORNING REPORT NEWSLETTER\nPassengers don’t have to rely on travel apps anymore to get updates on their flight status. Rido – stock.adobe.com Unfortunately, this hack can only be used by iPhone users. If you’re an Android user, however, you can still type your flight number into the Google search bar to get real-time updates.\nMany TikTokers were stunned by this hidden hack that could have saved them a lot of stress and headaches.\n“I have never known this! This makes my type-A airport self so happy,” commented one person.\n“I was told by airport employees that the link is updated before the screens,” confessed another.\n“United does this automatically for you. It stays on your phone at the top of screen (even when in other apps). Makes we want to fly United all the time,” added a frequent flier.\n“Thank you for this tip! I fly quite a bit and this will be so helpful!” gushed a traveler.\nFor the latest in lifestyle, top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com/lifestyle/",

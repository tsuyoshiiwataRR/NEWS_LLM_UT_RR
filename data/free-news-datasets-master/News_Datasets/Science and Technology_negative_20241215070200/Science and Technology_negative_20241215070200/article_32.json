    "text": "Product : The Sims 4\nPlatform : Xbox Series X\nWhich language are you playing the game in? English\nHow often does the bug occur? Every time (100%)\nWhat is your current game version number? 2.3.2.2310\nWhat expansions, game packs, and stuff packs do you have installed? I have all paid DLC (expansions, game packs, stuff packs, and kit) installed.\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? The moment I play any save file, the Reaper’s Rewards event tasks will not pop up on the quest bar.\nWhat happens when the bug occurs? The moment I play the game. I try to see what tasks I need to do for rewards and nothing pops up and gives me nothing. I’m stuck on week 4 of the Event, and the next series of tasks won’t pop up.\nWhat do you expect to see? Tasks on what to do to earn rewards for the Reaper’s Rewards event. In this state, I cannot complete the event and will not get all of the rewards unless it starts tracking the tasks/quests again.\nHave you installed any customization with the game, e.g. Custom Content or Mods? On console - never used.\nDid this issue appear after a specific patch or change you made to your system? Neutral/Not Sure\n‌\n‌",

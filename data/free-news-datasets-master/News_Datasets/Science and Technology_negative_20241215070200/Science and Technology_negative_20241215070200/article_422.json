    "text": "Get help with your TalkTalk landline and calling features.\nyesterday\nI am receiving a lot of spam calls .Call safe is not working. I keep trying to switch it on. It just says “it may take several minutes to switch on” but never switches on.\n51 minutes ago\nMorning Michelle. I have just logged in with a different browser and on another laptop. Exactly the same thing is happening. The message states - Call Safe is switched on but it will take several minutes to activate. But the status remains off.\nan hour ago\nHello,\nDoes it still show as not active in your My Account? Have you tried using a different browser?\nThanks\nMichelle\n2 hours ago\nGood Morning Michelle It is still happening I had a call at 7.30am this morning.\n4 hours ago\nMorning,\nI'm sorry for the delay. Could you confirm if it is still happening today please?\nThanks\nMichelle\nyesterday\nOK, thanks for that.\nyesterday\nI contacted technical help about 2 months ago when I renewed my contract. They told me it was working . But I have received many scam calls which are increasing now. So I don't think it has ever worked. It did work before I renewed my contract.\nyesterday\nJust to clarify: was it working previously and has now failed; or is this the first time you have tried to set it up?\nyesterday\nThank you for your help.\nyesterday\nThanks, we'll flag it for attention, [@Janor](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/739523), but it will be Friday before staff pick it up.\nyesterday\nI received the call about 30 minutes ago. I tried switching call safe on via the phone. It told me it could not switch call safe on and seek technical help.\nyesterday\nWhen was the last call received by a spammer?\nThis was reported as an issue but was reported as fixed earlier today.",

    "text": "Canceled in early 2024, survival sim Project Odyssey apparently wasn’t the only Blizzard Entertainment game in production. Now the company is recruiting employees for another mysterious project.\nAs noted by user Zesilo from the Reddit forum, a vacancy for an assistant design director for an unannounced project recently appeared on the official Blizzard Entertainment website.\n“As the Design Director of Innovation, you will be the visionary and author of key strategic innovations for the upcoming open-world shooter.”reads the job description.\nBlizzard Entertainment does not disclose the details of the open-world shooter itself in the vacancy, except that the game will have to “to surprise, delight and be remembered”. In this case, we are talking about a AAA-level project.\nIt’s unclear exactly what kind of project Blizzard is preparing, but Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier recently reported that the company is in the incubation stage (that is, very early) of a new shooter based on StarCraft.\nThe small team is allegedly led by former Far Cry executive producer Dan Hay, who moved to Blizzard to work on Project Odyssey. After the cancellation of the survival simulator, the specialist seems to have taken on a new project.\nBlizzard’s two previous attempts to release a shooter based on StarCraft ended unsuccessfully – both the third-person action game StarCraft: Ghost and Ares (a kind of analogue of Battlefield) were eventually canceled.\nIf you notice an error, select it with the mouse and press CTRL+ENTER.",

    "text": "<p>Physical wedding invitation cards have become a thing of the past, with them being expensive and wasteful for the environment, as well as adding the task of needing to physically go to everyone's house and invite them. </p>.<p><a href=\\\"https://www.deccanherald.com/tags/whatsapp\\\">WhatsApp</a> invitations are the norm these days - convenient, environment-friendly and cost-effective. It is what most people have begun to use.</p>.<p>As it happens with every new popular trend, scamsters have found a way to utilise this trend to defraud people. According to a <a href=\\\"https://www.news18.com/india/beware-of-wedding-invitation-scams-one-click-could-compromise-your-phones-security-9117431.html\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">report</a> in <em>News18</em>, the Himachal Pradesh police alerted the people about a new scam that cybercriminals have started using to gain access to people's phones.</p>.<p>Officials said that people are being sent APK (Android Application Package) files filled with malware that is disguised as wedding invitation.</p><p>Unaware victims download these files, which then secretly install a malware app in the phone. The app gains access to sensitive data, monitor activities, and can even hijack the phone’s functions.</p><p>Once they have access to your phone, fraudsters can also send messages to the victim’s contacts, requesting money or sensitive information, all while pretending to be the phone’s owner.</p>.Explained | What is a 'digital arrest' scam?.<p>DIG Mohit Chawla, Himachal Pradesh State CID and Cyber Crime Department, told <em>News18</em>, “If you receive an unsolicited wedding invitation or any file from an unknown number, do not click on it. Ensure you verify the sender and the file before downloading anything onto your phone.\\\"</p><p>He went on to add that one must still verify files sent by trusted contacts before downloading them.</p>.<p>The citizens must immediately report any cybercrime on helpline number 1930 or www.cybercrime.gov.in and follow 'CyberDost' channels or account on social media.</p>",

    "text": "We love order, systems, and routines, everything in its proper place. Using the PS Store for anything meaningful, then, has always been an exercise in frustration. We allowed ourselves to think that perhaps in the age of the PS5 Pro, the PS Store page [specifically set aside](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/11/ps-store-makes-launch-day-easy-with-dedicated-ps5-pro-category) for games enhanced on Sony's new machine might keep things straight for us. We should have known better.\nSony's list includes several games confirmed for a PS5 Pro patch, hidden amongst those that have already been enhanced by one, which is the opposite of helpful. As [PSLS](https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2024/11/14/games-without-ps5-pro-patches-labeled-enhanced-ps-store/) points out, these aren't indie games either: [Call of Duty: Black Ops 6](games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_6) and [Fortnite](games/ps5/fortnite) have yet to receive PS5 Pro enhancement patches despite being listed as already having them on Sony's storefront.\nWe aren't sure what purpose this aspirational list serves or why the [PlayStation Blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/04/ps5-pro-50-enhanced-games-available-at-launch-november-7/) is still advertising these games as having been patched in the first place; it's confusing and unorganised. If we had to guess, there appear to be a few gaps in the communication chain.",

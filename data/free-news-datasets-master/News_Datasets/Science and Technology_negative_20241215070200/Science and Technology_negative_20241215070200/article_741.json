    "text": "Advertisement Elon Musk has added Microsoft as a defendant in a lawsuit against OpenAI. The suit, which also adds Reid Hoffman as a defendant, accuses the companies of forming a monopoly. Musk claims OpenAI is trying to \"starve\" rivals of AI talent by offering \"lavish compensation.\" Elon Musk has amended a lawsuit against OpenAI to name Microsoft as a defendant, calling their partnership a \"de facto merger\" and accusing them of anticompetitive practices.\nThe revised lawsuit, filed Thursday, also names Reid Hoffman, a Microsoft board member and former OpenAI board member, as a defendant. And it names Musk's xAI startup and Shivon Zilis, the mother of three of his children, as plaintiffs. Zilis was previously an OpenAI board member and is now an executive at Neuralink, Musk's brain-implant company.\nAdvertisement The complaint accuses OpenAI and Microsoft of creating an artificial-intelligence monopoly and engaging in \"intensified\" anticompetitive practices, citing \"lavish compensation\" offers as one example.\nLawyers for Musk say in the amended complaint, filed at a federal court in Northern California: \"OpenAI has attempted to starve competitors of AI talent by aggressively recruiting employees with offers of lavish compensation, and is on track to spend $1.5 billion on personnel for just 1,500 employees.\"\nBloomberg previously reported that some OpenAI employees were making up to $800,000 a year, which can include bonuses and stock awards. It also said that most OpenAI engineering roles paid between $200,000 and $370,000, citing a review of job postings.\nAdvertisement Musk's lawyers say that the defendants \"possess a nearly 70% share of the generative AI market, constituting a monopoly, or, in the alternative, an attempt or conspiracy to monopolize the generative AI market.\"\nThe suit describes Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI as a \"de facto merger\" and says: \"Microsoft is now OpenAI, and OpenAI, Microsoft.\" It refers to a New York Times report from last month, which said Microsoft AI's chief, Mustafa Suleyman, was among a group of Microsoft employees who work from OpenAI's San Francisco office.\nThe amended lawsuit is the latest escalation between longtime rivals Musk and Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI. Musk first sued OpenAI and its cofounders Altman and Greg Brockman in March, accusing the company of jeopardizing its nonprofit mission by partnering with Microsoft, which has invested more than $13 billion into the startup. OpenAI responded to the suit by calling it \"incoherent\" and \"contradictory.\"\nAdvertisement Musk, who helped create OpenAI in 2015, then dropped his lawsuit without explanation. He filed the latest suit in August , arguing that OpenAI had abandoned its founding mission to develop AI that is beneficial for humanity because it's putting commercial interests first and claiming that he was \"deceived\" into cofounding the company. OpenAI said in September that it's moving to a for-profit governance structure .\nThe current lawsuit claims that OpenAI acted in an anticompetitive manner by asking investors in its most recent funding round not to invest in competitors, including Musk's xAI. The suit references an October report from the Financial Times, which said this was one of the terms asked of prospective investors for the $6.6 billion funding round that closed last month.\nAs part of that round, SoftBank committed $500 million to OpenAI. Navneet Govil, the chief financial officer of SoftBank's Vision Funds, previously told Business Insider that SoftBank still had the ability to invest in other AI companies. Govil told BI's Hasan Chowdhury: \"Our view is if it's a disruptive company and the addressable market is large, there's room for more than one player.\"\nMicrosoft, OpenAI, and Hoffman didn't immediately respond to requests for comment made outside normal working hours. In September, Hoffman called Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI a case of \"sour grapes.\"",

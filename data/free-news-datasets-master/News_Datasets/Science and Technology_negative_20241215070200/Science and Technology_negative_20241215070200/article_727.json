    "text": "A 29-year-old U.K. resident living in Liverpool was running a service that involved uploading illegal services to Amazon Fire Sticks in return for earning a quick buck. Unfortunately, the authorities quickly triangulated on his position and put a stop to this activity while also hammering down a jail sentence that would last for more than three years. Illegal services through Amazon Fire Sticks were marketed using Facebook, which likely received the unwanted attention of the authorities. Jonathan Edge has been sentenced to three years and four months in prison, with Sky News reporting that a separate concurrent sentence of two years and three months has been imposed for accessing and viewing the content he was supplying. Using hard cash was one way to avoid being traced by the police, but the only problem was that Edge was marketing his illicit operation using Facebook, which likely notified the authorities of his activities. Edge received multiple warnings about illegally streaming content using Amazon Fire Sticks, but these were ignored. Later, during the sentencing, these warnings were referenced by the judge, who treated them as one of the reasons for the somewhat bigger sentence. The prosecution was undertaken by the Premier League, which was supported by other entities such as FACT, or Federation Against Copyright Theft, and Merseyside Police. Kevin Plumb, Premier League general counsel, says that the sentence handed down to Edge is the result of the severity of his actions, which involved providing viewers with unauthorized access to Premier League football. “The significant sentence handed down to the individual involved once again serves to highlight the severity of his actions. We will continue to pursue legal action against those supplying unauthorised access to Premier League football, regardless of the scale or mode of operation. Ignoring warnings to stop only served to make the consequences worse for the individual.” Detective Sergeant Steve Frame from Merseyside Police said that several people in the U.K. do not see any harm in illegally streaming TV services, but they are incorrect in this assumption and the recent outcome should serve as a stern warning to those who pursue such money-making avenues.",

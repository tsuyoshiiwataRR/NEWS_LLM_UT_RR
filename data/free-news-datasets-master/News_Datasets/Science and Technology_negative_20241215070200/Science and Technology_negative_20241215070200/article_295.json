    "text": "BHPian Aceman82 recently shared this with other enthusiasts:\nI got the dreaded HV critical error today. The car had around 32% state of charge (SOC) when the HV Critical error appeared. The vehicle is approximately 1.5 years old and has only been driven for about 5,000 km. It's primarily used for school runs and is the third car in our garage.\nThe HV critical error suddenly appeared at around 32% SOC, and the vehicle went into limp mode before coming to a full stop. I turned off the car and restarted it; the error went away, but the car was operating with reduced performance. I drove it to my home garage and parked it, at which point the HV alert appeared once more.\nI tried to charge the car, but the alert keeps popping up, and it refuses to charge. I'll need to call Roadside Assistance (RSA) tomorrow and request a tow to the service center if it fails to charge in the morning as well.\nIf a vehicle with only 5,000 km on it experiences battery issues, what are the chances of reliability in a high-mileage vehicle? Who would want to own such a car outside of warranty?\nThis is my third car in the garage (I have two other cars and two two-wheelers), so I don't mind it being in the service center for extended periods. Saying that, My 8 year old XUV500 would had less service centre visits than the 1.5 year old Tiago EV .\nThis is quickly turning out to be a garage queen where one needs infinite money and patience to keep a EV car from Tata.\nWill keep this thread posted on updates to the Battery issue.\nCheck out BHPian comments for more insights and information.",

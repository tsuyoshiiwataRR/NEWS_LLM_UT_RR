    "text": "Keywords\nCyber Secruity, Credential stuffing, Phishing, Malware\nAbstract\nEvery year, millions of people have their credentials stolen by cybercriminals. Criminals use simple techniques such as phishing to manipulate people into giving up their usernames and passwords. This can lead to major assets being compromised or stolen. Unfortunately, criminals know that many individuals reuse the same passwords or variations of the same password across many sites. Criminals use this information to test stolen passwords on other sites, which can be done on a massive scale. Such attacks can become life-threatening and destructive to many companies and individuals.\nRecommended Citation\nLarson, Jaiden\n(2024)\n\"The Dark Truth about Cyber Security,\"\nMarriott Student Review: Vol. 7:\nIss.\n2, Article 3.\nAvailable at:\nhttps://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/marriottstudentreview/vol7/iss2/3\nMarriott Student Review is a student journal created and published as a project for the Writing for Business Communications course at Brigham Young University (BYU).

    "text": "The Pentagon has released a new UFO report that revealed hundreds of documented incidents of unidentified and unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP). While there is no evidence to suggest that these UAPs (the government’s term for UFOs) are of extraterrestrial origin, some defy explanation, including a near-miss between a commercial airliner and a mysterious object off the coast of New York . The report comes as public interest in UAPs has skyrocketed, prompting the US government to work to provide some answers about these strange objects. It was released a day after House lawmakers called for greater government transparency during a hearing on UAPs. The Pentagon review detailed 757 cases of UAP encounters that were reported to U.S. authorities primarily between May 1, 2023, and June 1, 2024. That total includes 272 incidents that occurred before that period but were not reported. previously. Reporting witnesses included commercial and military pilots, as well as ground observers. Most of these incidents occurred in airspace, but 49 took place at estimated altitudes of at least 62 miles above the Earth’s surface, which is considered space. No injuries or accidents were reported in any of the incidents. But a commercial flight crew reported a near miss with a “cylindrical object” while flying over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of New York. That incident is still under investigation. The Pentagon has released a new UFO report that revealed hundreds of documented incidents of unidentified and unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP). In three other cases, military aircrews reported being followed or tailed by unidentified aircraft, but investigators found no evidence linking the activity to a foreign power. During the reporting period, 81 reports came from areas of US military operations. Witnesses who provided visual descriptions reported unidentified lights or round, spherical, or orb-shaped objects. Other reports included a witness reporting a “jellyfish” type UAP with flashing lights. The report states that trends in UAP morphologies remain consistent with historical patterns. “Unidentified lights and round, spherical, or orb-shaped objects made up the majority of cases in which reports provided distinct visual characteristics,” it reads. ‘Objects within the ‘other’ category include unique descriptions such as ‘green fireball,’ ‘a jellyfish with flashing (multicolored) lights,’ and a ‘silver rocket approximately six feet long.’ Investigators were able to explain nearly 300 of the incidents and, in many cases, the unknown objects were identified as balloons, birds, airplanes, drones or satellites. The report was released a day after House lawmakers called for greater government transparency during a hearing on UAPs. The report claims that Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite system is an increasingly common source of UAP reports, as people confuse satellite chains with UFOs. But hundreds of other cases remain unexplained. The report’s authors said this is often because there is not enough information to draw firm conclusions. “It is important to emphasize that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,” they wrote. During Wednesday’s hearing, lawmakers heard testimony from several experts who have studied the phenomenon, including two former military officers. The discussion included questions about extraterrestrial intelligence and military research using extraterrestrial technology, as well as concerns that foreign powers may be using secret aircraft to spy on U.S. military facilities. The government’s cybersecurity and innovation chair, Nancy Mace (RS.C.), took a philosophical or metaphysical direction in her final question: ‘How would you define non-human intelligence and non-human biological products?’ What are we really talking about?’ House oversight panelist Mike Gold, a NASA legal and policy specialist who now works in private aerospace, was the last to give his response, saying that we should reexamine the idea with modest assumptions. , but noted that an advanced visitor intelligence may not actually be biological. When asked what “non-biological intelligence” means, Gold responded: “Artificial intelligence, ML, machines.” Public interest in this issue was evident by the large volume of private citizen attendance at the hearing, DailyMail.com’s Matthew Phelan reported live from the event. Lawmakers said the many questions about UAPs show the need for the government to closely study the issue and share its findings with the American public. “There’s something out there,” said Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee. ‘The question is: Is it ours, is it someone else’s, or is it from another world?’",

This statement was made by the publications on their websites. We believe that the benefits of being on X now outweigh the downsides, and that the editorial resources could be better used to promote our journalism elsewhere According to The Guardian, the US election campaign showed that X is a negative media platform, and its owner Elon Musk used its influence to shape political discourse. This is what we have been observing for some[Time], considering the alarming content that is advertised or contained on the platform, including far-right conspiracy theories and racism The Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia also announced the cessation of publications on X. La Vanguardia will cease to directly publish tweets on the social network X and will suspend its accounts. This social network has become a platform where conspiracy theories and disinformation resonate The Guardian has about 80 accounts on X with a total of 27 million followers. La Vanguardia has 1.3 million readers. The value of the social network X has decreased by more than 75% since its acquisition by billionaire Elon Musk two years ago.

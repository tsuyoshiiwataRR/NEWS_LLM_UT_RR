    "text": "Quick Links Apple Notes has been a great companion over the years, helping me jot down my thoughts and ideas. However, after several updates, it still lacks some features that could make it even better. 1 Official Plugins or Extensions There are several [reasons why Notes is the best note-taking app for Apple users](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-apple-notes-is-best-note-taking-app-for-apple-users/), chief among them being its simplicity. It's an out-of-the-box app that anyone can use easily. However, its simplistic approach and focus on the most basic note-taking features also means power users may find it lacking. That's where official support for plugins to extend its functionalities would be useful. Adding official support for extensions would allow anyone to customize Notes to fit their workflows while enjoying other benefits like the seamless integration with other Apple devices. In comparison, popular note-taking apps like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) come with advanced features by default and still offer plugin support for extensive customization. Although Apple Notes does not officially support plugins, there are some third-party add-ons, like [NotesCmdr](https://smallest.app/notescmdr/), that you can use to add several missing features like slash commands and templates. However, note that these add-ons are often created by independent developers and may not go through the same rigorous security checks that official plugins would. 2 Markdown Support Another Apple Notes limitation, compared to other note-taking apps, is its lack of support for Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that lets you quickly add formatting to text, such as bold, italics, headings, and lists. Although Apple Notes supports some text formatting options, you will have to use its keyboard shortcuts or the formatting buttons in the toolbar. Luckily, if you rely heavily on Markdown, you can add this functionality to Apple Notes with an extension like [ProNotes](https://www.pronotes.app/). This free Apple Notes extension lets you use Markdown syntax in your notes. Alternatively, if you enjoy writing in Markdown, you can consider switching to other third-party note-taking apps like [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/). 3 Integration With Other Third-Party Apps One of the main reasons why I still use Apple Notes is that it integrates seamlessly with other Apple devices. For instance, while I prefer typing on my Mac, I can quickly jot down notes on my iPhone, which accompanies me everywhere, and those notes sync effortlessly across my devices. I also enjoy using Siri to quickly take notes when I can't type. However, I sometimes wish Apple Notes could play nice with the other third-party tools I use daily. This restriction means I only use Notes for my personal needs because I can’t connect it to other apps I use for work. 4 Accessibility and Collaboration Outside Apple Devices One of the biggest limitations of Apple Notes is that it’s restricted to the Apple ecosystem. While it works seamlessly across my Mac and iPhone, it’s essentially locked out of any other non-Apple device. This means that there's no straightforward way to access my notes on my Android phone when I need to. However, there's a laborious workaround for non-Apple devices; you can [use iCloud on the web without an Apple device](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-icloud-web-only-access/) to access Notes. This limited accessibility also affects collaboration with non-Apple users. While [collaboration in Notes with other Apple users](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-collaborate-with-apple-notes/) is possible, it is limited compared to other tools. Plus, you are out of luck if you want to work on a note with a colleague or friend using a non-Apple device. In contrast, apps like [Microsoft OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) offer cross-platform support and more collaborative features. 5 Native Template Support Templates are a go-to feature for anyone who regularly needs preformatted note structures, as they eliminate the need to format each note type from scratch every time. Sadly, Apple Notes doesn't have a built-in template feature. If I want to create a specific format—like a meeting agenda or a recurring checklist—I have to manually recreate it each time, which is far from ideal because it adds extra steps that could easily be eliminated with built-in template functionality. Alternatively, you can duplicate an existing note each time you want to reuse a format. You can also use [ProNotes to supercharge the Notes app on your Mac](https://www.makeuseof.com/extension-to-supercharge-notes-app-on-mac/#use-pronotes-to-insert-templates). This extension adds several useful features including, slash commands and the ability to insert templates with a few keystrokes. 6 Version History The lack of version history is one of the biggest downsides of Apple Notes, especially considering its competition has this feature. With version history, you can restore a previous version of a note in case you make any accidental changes or want to revert to an older version. There's currently no way to access a prior version of a note in Apple Notes. However, if you accidentally delete a note in the last 30 days, you can find it in the Recently Deleted folder. In addition, you can use the undo shortcut (Command + Z) to revert any recent changes in a note. However, this won't work if you close the note and reopen it later. Beyond these workarounds, your best bet is to use other note-taking apps like Google Keep. [Keep lets you track changes with version history](https://www.makeuseof.com/google-keep-version-history/) and restore a previous version of a note if needed. 7 Whiteboard A whiteboard feature in a note-taking app can be incredibly valuable for visually connecting ideas, creating mind maps, or organizing thoughts, which can be especially helpful for brainstorming. You can use the Markup button in Notes on the iPhone or iPad to draw. However, this feature isn’t available on the Mac version of Notes, except for use on attached images or documents. You will have to rely on [Apple's Freeform on Mac](https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-freeform-app-explained/) or use other note-taking apps with whiteboards like [Logseq](https://logseq.com/). 8 Bi-Directional Linking You can use [Apple Notes to create links between your notes](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-link-to-notes-in-apple-notes-iphone/), which can help connect related information. However, these links are unidirectional by default, meaning they only point from one note to another without creating a reciprocal link back. Bi-directional linking, on the other hand, creates a two-way connection, allowing you to easily jump back and forth between notes. Bi-directional linking is extremely useful in note-taking and [personal knowledge management apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-personal-knowledge-management-tools-for-organizing-information/), helping you see connections and context between ideas. One way to replicate this feature in Apple Notes is by creating a link from one note to the next and a backlink from the second note to the first. This may not be as seamless as having a built-in bi-directional linking feature, but it can still help you connect your notes effectively. Alternatively, use ProNotes to view all the notes linked to a specific note. Apple Notes is a great note-taking app due to its ease of use and seamless integration within the Apple ecosystem. While it works exceptionally well for basic note-taking needs, it may not have all the advanced features other apps offer.",

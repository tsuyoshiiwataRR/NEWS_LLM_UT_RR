    "text": "By Vera Demertzis ,\n1 hours ago A BOMBSHELL Pentagon report has listed a bizarre array of UFOs sighted across the US – including that of floating brains.\nThe out-of-the world report revealed the most reported alien aircraft shapes at a US Congressional hearing titled “Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.”\nAn unclassified U.S. government video appears to show an unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) SWNS Most UAP eyewitness accounts come from military personnel SWNS People have reported seeing UAPs resembling floating brains and jellyfish AFP The 11 page whistleblower document revealed that floating brains and jellyfish shaped Unidentified Aerial Phenomena were one of the most commonly seen aircraft types.\nDubbed irregular and organic UAPs, eye-witnesses have reported they have seen the spaceships take on the form of floating brains with appendages and jellyfish.\nDescriptions of the “floating brain” UAP can vary, but it often has bio-luminescent qualities, moves erratically and can sometimes shape shift.\nThe US government allegedly holds infra-red footage of one such “Jellyfish” UAP flying across the southern border with Mexico .\nThe full report describes a number of alleged alien encounters including a “large saucer-shaped UAP” emerging from thick clouds before suddenly reversing direction.\nThe eye-witness reports were collected between 1991 and 2022 and added to a UAP and Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) database.\nThe bombastic report also revealed several close alien encounters observed by military personnel.\nThe bombastic report also revealed several close alien encounters observed by military personnel.\nWhile the eye witness accounts aren’t verified, they do come from from military aviators, pilots, and services members trained in foreign military collection activities.\nOne UAP was spotted observing a US naval ship, before disappearing into the night, while a series of metallic orb were observed attempting to intercept an F-22 jet in the sky.\nIt comes after a cylindrical UFO was in a terrifying near miss with a passenger airline in New York.\nIt’s one of 757 cases reported to US authorities during a period, but was the only one where there was a possible “flight safety issue”.\nThe new claim comes in a bombshell Pentagon report as Congress continues to investigate the phenomena.\nThe report says: “In this instance, a commercial aircrew reported a near miss with a ‘cylindrical object’ while over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of New York.”\nThe near miss happened some time between May 1, 2023, and June 1, 2024, but it is not clear where exactly over the ocean it occurred.\nThe congressional hearing into UAPs and UFOS was held on Wednesday and featured testimony from Dr. Tim Gallaudet, a retired Rear Admiral in the US Navy, former Department of Defense official Luis Elizondo, former NASA administrator Michael Gold and independent journalist Michael Shellenberger.\nThe Pentagon last month categorically denied the existence of any such program after portions of the unnamed whistleblower’s claims were first reported by Shellenberger on his Substack blog.\nMeanwhile, Luiz Elizondo recently made headlines after he claimed he had touched alien technology.\nThe former Department of Defence official also claimed that “non human” bodies had been found on earth.\nThe former head of the Pentagon program responsible for the investigation of UFOs has made the bombshell claims in his new book “Imminent: Inside the Pentagon’s Hunt for UFOs”.\nHe claims to have been told categorically the infamous Roswell incident in New Mexico in 1947 involved two flying saucers – and “four deceased non-human bodies” were recovered from the wreckage and examined.\nHe claims other bodies have also been retrieved from subsequent sites, including Mexico in the 1950s and Kazakhstan in 1989.\nElizondo alleges he has also handled “alien” technology, including “alleged alien implants found in humans.”\nHe said: “I have held in my hand material that scientists for the US government have conducted research on, and they’ve said: ‘This is very special material, it’s highly unlikely that it’s made by human beings – and it’s engineered.’\n“I’ve also held in my hand biological samples, tissue samples, that have been removed from human beings – that when analysed, do not behave like anything that we are normally used to associating with being a natural part of the human body, and certainly looks to be some sort of technical device.”\nThe report comes after the Pentagon began investigating secret UFO sightings after senators across the States moved to take sightings more seriously.\nThe investigations were supervised by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) which was founded in 2022 to allow servicemen to report unidentified aerial phenomena without fear of retaliation.\nIn 2021, Trump signed a bill calling on intelligence agencies to find out the truth behind UFO military base sightings.\nThe real threat of UFOs and aliens FOR decades, UFOs and aliens were considered to be make belief things created by people in tinfoil hats but they are now considered a threat to national security.\nLong gone are those who claim conspiracy theories are all false as many are now discussed at the highest levels of government with US officials even admitting their existence.\nAs more and more credible witnesses continue to come forward to tell their extraordinary stories publicly.\nThe 2010s saw decades of stigmas around extraterrestrial life start to break down as politicians made UFO sightings a matter of national security.\nAcross the world, governments have also unveiled some spooky truths with some even showcasing “dead alien corpses” on display for Congress.\nResearchers recently verified the legitimacy of a set of three-fingered mummies as potential evidence of “non-human” life forms.\nA line-up of doctors confirmed at Mexico ‘s Congress on Tuesday that the bodies, purportedly not of this Earth, were in fact real, once-living organisms.\nThe Pentagon also released a blockbuster 1,574 pages of real-life X-Files in 2022, related to its secretive UFO programme.\nThe haul includes reports into research on the biological effects of UFO sightings on humans , sets out categorisations for paranormal experiences, and studies into sci-fi-style tech.\nTop UFO chief Sean Kirkpatrick told the world last year that he is set to step down from his job following his stern warning of concerning activity “in our backyard.”\nThe Pentagon’s UFO analysis office launched a UFO reporting service to the public after admitting to uncovering “some things” and calling the high number of suspicious activity either a foreign power or aliens.\nNavy jet footage has revealed the intriguing images of a government-confirmed UFO baffling the internet.\nThe United States Government launched the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).\nRADM Timothy Gallaudet spoke at the hearing into UFO programs SWNS The flying saucer is one of the most commonly reported shapes (computer generated image)",

    "text": "Apple is once again hauled out by the European Commission. This time, the Cupertino company has received orders to put‍ an end ⁣to its geoblocking practices on European territory. For the EC and national consumer protection authorities, many of these practices are “potentially prohibited” and concern numerous services, including the ‍App Store, Apple Arcade, Apple Music,⁣ iTunes Store, Apple Books and Apple Podcasts. The EU gives the tech giant ⁣one month to lift⁣ these restrictions.\nThe Commission’s request⁤ concludes a “coordinated” investigation by the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) network, which brings together the national consumer protection authorities of ‍the 27 Member⁢ States as well as those ⁢of Norway and Iceland. In its conclusion, the network notified Apple⁢ yesterday,⁣ Wednesday 13 November 2024, of “potentially prohibited” geo-blocking practices on some of the American company’s multimedia services.\nThe ⁤three EU criticisms of Apple\nGeoblocking means the restriction or modification of the offer of services and content offered to users ​based on their geographical positioning. In simpler terms, a French user of ⁢Apple services, for example, cannot access the same applications or‍ consume the same content as ⁢a user of another European nationality.\nWhile geoblocking is not ⁤banned by⁢ the ⁤EU,​ some‌ practices are. And ‍the CPC identified three in Apple, which violate the geo-blocking regulation, adopted in 2018. The EC recalls that this text “prohibits any unjustified discrimination between EU customers based on their nationality, place of residence ⁢or place of establishment when they wish to purchase goods or services from traders located in a different Member State”.\n“No company, large or small, should unfairly discriminate against customers based ‌on ⁢their nationality, place of residence or place of business. ​Preventing geo-blocking helps‌ consumers access the goods and services of their ⁣choice across Europe and strengthens the functioning and integrity of our single market,” commented Margrethe Vestager, European Competition Commissioner.\nWhat do we blame Apple for? First ⁢of​ all, it concerns the interfaces of multimedia services which differ between EU countries.⁤ The press release‍ mentions the App Store, Apple Arcade, Apple Music,‍ iTunes Store, Apple Books, and‌ Apple⁣ Podcasts. “In the mobile application of these services,‍ consumers can only access the interface created for the country in ‍which they registered their Apple account and encounter significant difficulties when trying to access ​another interface, which is against the rules of the EU on the ‍fight against geolocation. block”, we explain.\nAdditionally, users of Apple services are not authorized to use payment methods issued in a country other than the one indicated when creating their account. “When making purchases ⁣on the Apple Media Services app,⁢ consumers are only permitted to use payment methods (such as ‍a credit/debit card)​ issued in the‍ country in which⁤ they registered their Apple Account,” the EC and CPC continue.\nThe third criticism⁢ leveled at the bitten apple company concerns the restrictions on downloads. Consumers from one EU ‌country cannot ‌access another country’s version or download applications offered there. Gold, he‌ insists According to the EC, “consumers should‌ be able to download applications ⁤offered in another EU/EEA country ‌when they travel to that country or ‍stay there temporarily”.\nApple has one month ⁢to comply\nApple must respond to⁣ the CPC network’s​ findings within a month and “propose commitments on ​how it intends to remedy the observed practices.” The EC warns the American company that “national authorities may take coercive measures to enforce the legislation” if Apple fails to respond.\nThis summons adds to numerous previous investigations and accusations by the EU, including on the issue of competition.⁤ The latest decision against Apple dates back to two months ago and comes from the Court ​of Justice of the EU (CJEU), which ordered the Cupertino company to reimburse 13 billion euros in unpaid taxes to the Irish state, closing a case that has lasted​ for years.\nRegarding the regulation on geoblocking, the EC had already identified Google in 2023,‍ subject to the same criticism for its Google Play Store application store.\nWhat are the implications of the EU’s ​stance on geoblocking for‍ technology⁤ companies​ like ‌Apple? ‍ Interview between Time.news Editor, Alex Reed, and Digital ‌Economy Expert, Dr. Lisa Harmon\nAlex Reed: Thank you for joining us today,​ Dr. Harmon. The European Commission has ‌once again⁢ turned its gaze ​toward Apple,⁣ this time regarding their ⁤geoblocking ‍practices. What are your initial thoughts on this latest⁢ development?\nDr. Lisa Harmon: Thank⁣ you, Alex. This situation highlights a significant issue⁢ in the‍ digital marketplace. Geoblocking restricts consumer access ⁢based ⁤on ​geographical location,​ which can lead to unfair discrimination among ‌EU citizens. The Commission’s actions send a clear message: that in a single digital market, consumers should ​not face barriers due to where they live or ⁤happen to be.\nAlex Reed: ‌ Exactly. The EC has given Apple ‍a month to dismantle these practices. Can you break down what specific issues ​the Commission identified?\nDr. Lisa Harmon: Certainly. There are three⁣ main criticisms leveled ​at Apple. First, the apps and services differ ⁢significantly between EU countries, which impedes users from accessing the same content. If, ⁢for⁤ instance, a user from France cannot access the same Apple Music library as someone in Germany, it creates‍ a fragmented experience.\nAlex Reed: That makes sense. What’s the second issue?\nDr. Lisa ⁤Harmon: The ​second problem relates to payment methods. Apple‌ requires users to only‌ use‌ payment methods from the country in which they registered their account. So,⁢ if ‍you have an Apple‌ account created in Italy, you can’t use a payment​ method‍ from Spain, even if⁣ you’re traveling there. This is a clear barrier to transactions that the EU⁤ finds unjustified.\nAlex Reed: Very interesting. And what about the third criticism?\nDr.‍ Lisa Harmon: The third issue revolves ⁣around access to applications. Consumers from ​one EU country are often unable ​to download apps available in another country. For example, if⁣ you’re traveling in another EU nation, ⁣you⁤ may not be able⁢ to download⁢ a local app that ‌could ‌enrich your experience while you’re there. This restriction is contrary to the idea of a unified ‍digital market within the EU.\nAlex Reed: Margrethe ⁢Vestager, ⁤the‌ EU’s‍ Competition Commissioner, mentioned that preventing ‌geoblocking ensures ​consumer access and supports the single‌ market. ‍How do ​you see this playing out in the broader context of the ​tech ⁤industry?\nDr. Lisa Harmon: It highlights a pivotal ‌moment ⁣for tech⁤ giants. As digital services become⁤ more integral to everyday⁤ life,‍ companies like Apple ⁢need ‍to ⁢adapt their business models to⁤ comply ⁢with emerging⁤ regulations. This isn’t just about legalities—it’s a matter of fostering trust ‍with consumers.⁣ The backlash against geoblocking ​could spur other companies to reconsider their practices and work towards‍ more equitable access.\nAlex Reed: ⁣With the ‌deadline looming, do you anticipate⁢ that Apple will comply, or might they contest these findings?\nDr. Lisa Harmon: I expect Apple ⁤will likely try ‌to negotiate​ or challenge ‌certain aspects, as they have‍ in the past. However, ⁢given the EU’s ‌commitment to creating a digital single market, ⁣I⁢ think it would be unwise for them to ‌ignore⁤ these⁢ requests entirely. ‍The reputation and consumer loyalty matter too much,⁣ especially in a region where data privacy and consumer ⁤rights are highly ‍prioritized.\nAlex Reed: Fascinating insights, Dr. Harmon! Before we wrap up, what do you ⁤think ⁣consumers should take away from this situation?\nDr. Lisa​ Harmon: Consumers should be aware of their rights regarding ‍access‌ to ​services across ⁢borders. Additionally, it’s crucial for them to​ advocate⁢ for fair practices that enhance their experiences. This situation is ‌part of ​a larger‍ conversation about digital‌ sovereignty and consumer empowerment.\nAlex Reed: ⁢Thank you, Dr. Harmon, ⁢for‍ sharing your expertise with‍ us today. We’ll be keeping a close ⁣eye⁢ on how this situation unfolds in the coming month.\nDr. Lisa Harmon: Thank ‍you for having me, Alex. I look forward ‍to ​the‍ next ​steps in⁣ this ongoing story!",

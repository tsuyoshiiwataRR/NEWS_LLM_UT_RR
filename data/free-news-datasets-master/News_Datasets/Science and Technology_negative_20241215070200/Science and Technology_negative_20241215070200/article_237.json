    "text": "Horror sci-fi scene, with old crumpled newspaper cutting about AI and a pair of human skulls.\ngettyAI-based social engineering attacks pose a growing risk as cybercriminals leverage advanced tools to enhance scams. Hacker groups use AI for live deepfake video calls, voice cloning, and AI-generated images to make scams more convincing. These technologies allow for large-scale automation of personalized attacks, increasing their reach and effectiveness.\nSocial media platforms inadvertently serve as hubs for these criminals, who share scamming scripts and techniques in plain sight. The rise of AI-driven tactics amplifies the psychological and financial harm to victims, making these attacks harder to detect and stop, and demanding urgent global action to combat them.\nHow Hackers Are Using AI Technology to Outsmart You\nAI-driven phishing has become alarmingly convincing, producing personalized emails, text messages, and social media posts that appear to come from trusted sources. These tailored communications target individuals and organizations with uncanny precision, significantly boosting their success rates.\nAdding to this arsenal is AI-powered voice cloning, which allows scammers to mimic the voices of trusted individuals or authorities during phone calls. This technique, known as vishing, exploits the trust associated with familiar voices to trick victims into revealing sensitive information or transferring funds.\nDeepfake technology is another troubling development. By creating realistic video content, cybercriminals can impersonate individuals during video calls or produce fake videos that seem to originate from credible sources. These tactics add an unsettling level of believability to their schemes.\nAI does not stop at crafting messages or creating content—it actively analyzes human responses. By interpreting a victim’s language, tone, and sentiment in real time, attackers can adapt their approach on the fly, making their manipulation more effective.\nMoreover, AI can process vast amounts of data from social media, public records, and online activities to build detailed victim profiles. These insights enable attackers to design highly personalized strategies, further increasing the chances of success.\nBeyond planning, AI automates key aspects of social engineering campaigns. From identifying potential victims to generating and sending phishing messages and even engaging in real-time conversations, these systems make attacks faster, more efficient, and harder to combat.\nWhile AI equips cybercriminals with powerful tools, it is also an essential weapon for those fighting back. Security researchers and organizations leverage AI to detect and counter these sophisticated attacks. However, the rapid evolution of AI capabilities presents an ongoing challenge, requiring constant vigilance and the continuous improvement of security measures to stay ahead of emerging threats.\nDo Not Fall for AI Scams: 7 Essential Tips to Keep Your Data Safe\n1. Be cautious of unexpected messages, even if they appear to come from someone you trust. Take the extra step to confirm their legitimacy by using official methods—call them directly, send a personal message, or verify face-to-face if possible. Carefully examine the language and tone of messages for any inconsistencies or signs of AI-generated content.\n2. Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) on your accounts and devices to strengthen your security beyond relying solely on passwords. While not directly tied to AI scams, this simple step makes you a significantly harder target for any type of attack.\n3. Stay alert to urgent or high-pressure requests, as these are classic tactics in social engineering scams. This advice applies to all forms of social engineering attacks. Remember, if a message gets your heart racing, it is probably a scam—always fraud.\n4. Stay wary of overly personalized messages, as AI can use your online footprint to create highly convincing traps. Remember, every scammer’s goal is to earn your trust—make it your goal to question everything and remain skeptical.\n5. Keep yourself updated on the latest AI-driven social engineering tactics and scams. Staying informed is your best defense.\n6. Deploy strong security measures like email filtering, web content filtering, and antivirus protection to identify and block potential threats. Still, remember, even the best systems can falter if human error is exploited.\n7. Report any suspected social engineering attempts to the appropriate authorities and organizations to aid in identifying and addressing new threats.\n{Categories} _Category: Inspiration{/Categories}\n{URL}https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexvakulov/2024/11/14/hackers-are-using-ai-against-you-here-is-how-to-protect-yourself/{/URL}\n{Author}Alex Vakulov, Contributor{/Author}\n{Image}https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6735dce57b80616fcebe4554/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds{/Image}\n{Keywords}Cybersecurity,/cybersecurity,Innovation,/innovation,Cybersecurity,/cybersecurity,standard{/Keywords}\n{Source}Inspiration{/Source}\n{Thumb}{/Thumb}",

    "text": "AI is doing little to help developers with the most time-consuming and painful parts of their daily workflows, according to new research.\nIn a survey commissioned by Rainforest, three-quarters of developers using open source frameworks for test automation said they were using AI to assist with test writing and/or maintenance, both of which are notoriously time-consuming tasks.\nHowever, the productivity benefits of AI tools haven't quite materialized yet, with teams reporting they actually spend more time on these tasks than those who don't.\nMike Sonders, head of marketing for Rainforest, said a leading factor behind this could be the inherent complexity of products among organizations who have chosen to adopt AI for development purposes.\nSonders noted that, in these circumstances, teams have \"more work than average to keep automated test suites updated\" and end up spending more time on general administrative upkeep.\n“Maybe AI is saving those teams some from spending even more time on test suite upkeep, and that effect is hiding in the results,\" he said.\n\"But given the large adoption rate of AI for test creation and maintenance among teams who use open source automation frameworks, this scenario seems unlikely. It’s more likely that AI just isn’t currently delivering velocity benefits for these recurring test automation tasks.\"",

    "text": "\\nAfter an impressive bullish breakout last week, Ethereum (ETH) price has significantly declined the rising momentum. The leading altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $377 billion, has dropped over 6 percent since Tuesday to trade around $3,133 on Thursday, November 14, during the mid-New York session.\n\\nNevertheless, the fear of a major crypto capitulation has significantly declined, since Bitcoin entered its price discovery phase. As of this writing, Ethereum\\u2019s fear and greed index has surged to 78 percent, which represents extreme greed from traders.\n\\n Key Levels to Watch for Ethereum Price Ahead \\nEthereum price recently confirmed the resurgence of bullish sentiment after successfully rebounding from the 200-weekly Moving Average (MA). For the first time since the August 5 crypto crash, Ether price has consistently closed above the crucial support/resistance range between $2,800 and $2,900.\n\\n \\n \\n \\nPoh, $ETH is having such a painful chart against Bitcoin.\n\\nWe\\u2019re still waiting for more rate cuts to come in, through which the Yields will drop and Ethereum will become more attractive.\n\\nPainful chart. pic.twitter.com/FwKCMtkLkX\n\\n\\u2014 Micha\\xebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 14, 2024\n\\n \\nCrypto analyst Micha\\xebl van de Poppe has reminded investors that the altcoin has been bleeding to Bitcoin for the past two years. In the daily time frame of the ETH/BTC pair, a bullish reversal pattern has been forming with a support level of around 0.034, coupled with a rising divergence of the Relative Strength Index (RSI).\n\\nWith the notable spike in interest for Ether by institutional investors, Ether\\u2019s price is well slated for more gains ahead.\n\\nFor instance, the US spot Ether ETFs have accumulated more than $500 million in the past few days.\n\\n Altseason Timings\\xa0 \\n \\n \\n \\n #ALT Season is when #BTC dominance aggressively goes down. #BTC Season is when #BTC dominance slowly goes up.\n\\nBTC dominance has been going up for years, which is why it was better to be in BTC than most ALTs.\n\\nClearly I am not talking about your alt, just everyone else\\u2019s alt. pic.twitter.com/bCyOxzhT9P\n\\n\\u2014 Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) November 13, 2024\n\\n \\nAccording to renowned crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, altcoin investors should not FOMO into rallying meme coins as the real altseason has not yet begun. Moreover, Bitcoin dominance has been gaining ground against the altcoin market in the past two years.\n\\nCowen highlighted that the real altseason will happen when Bitcoin dominance aggressively goes down. Currently, the OTHERS/BTC pair has been dropping, having reached the lowest level after Bitcoin price surged above $93k on Wednesday.\n\\n \\n SEO Powered Content & PR Distribution.

    "text": "Another year has passed, and that stubborn ‘Ozone Hole’ over Antarctica refuses to go away\nData from NASA shows that the area of the ‘Ozone Hole’ remains about the same as it has been over the last 30 years .\nBut will scientists admit that they didn’t save the ozone layer?\nBackground Ozone is a gas made up of three oxygen atoms (O 3 ). Ninety percent of the ozone in the atmosphere is found in the stratosphere, a layer of atmosphere between about 10 and 50 kilometers in altitude.\nThe amount of ozone in the atmosphere varies with time of year.\nDr. Mario Molina and Dr. Sherwood Rowland of the University of California published a paper in 1974 warning that industrial chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) pollution was destroying the ozone layer in Earth’s stratosphere.\nCFCs were gases used in hair spray, refrigerators, and insulating foams.\nThe theory of Molina and Rowland postulated that CFCs from human industry move upward through the atmosphere to the stratosphere, where ultraviolet radiation breaks down CFC molecules, releasing chlorine atoms.\nChlorine then acts as a catalyst to break down ozone molecules into oxygen, reducing the ozone concentration. According to the theory, the more CFCs consumed, the greater the destruction of the ozone layer.\nIn 1983, researchers from the British Antarctic Survey discovered a thinning of the ozone layer over Antarctica which occurred during August, September, and October.\nThis became known as the ‘Ozone Hole’, and appeared to confirm the theory of Molina and Rowland, who were awarded a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1995 for their work.\nMontreal Protocol (1987) The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet rays, shielding the surface of the Earth from high-energy radiation. According to scientists, degradation of the layer would increase rates of skin cancer and cataracts and cause immune system problems in humans.\nIn Earth in the Balance (1992), Al Gore claimed that hunters reported finding blind rabbits in Patagonia and that fishermen were catching blind fish due to human destruction of the ozone layer, but this was not confirmed .\nIn 1987, 29 nations and the European Community signed the “ Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer ”. Over the next decade, signers of the treaty rose to over 180 nations, all agreeing to ban the use of CFCs.\nBecause of the Montreal Protocol ban, world consumption of ozone depleting substances (ODS), or chlorofluorocarbons, began falling in 1990. By 2005, ODS consumption was down 90 percent and is now down more than 99 percent, according to the European Environment Agency .\nThe result? The Montreal Protocol was hailed as an example of international success of how nations could unite to resolve a major environmental issue.\nBut despite the elimination of CFCs, the ‘Ozone Hole’ remains as large as ever.\nNASA reported this fall that the mean ‘ozone hole’ area for September 7 to October 13 again reached 23 million square kilometers, roughly the same level as in the last three decades stretching back to 1994–1995.\nThe hole remains large, despite that fact that world ODS consumption has almost been eliminated.\nIn 2015, scientists at NASA predicted that the ‘Ozone Hole’ would be half closed by 2020. That hasn’t happened\nOther scientists have forecasted that the ‘hole’ will not begin to disappear until 2040 or later.\nBut the longer the ‘hole’ persists, the greater the likelihood that the ozone layer is dominated by natural factors, not human CFC emissions.\nSee more here masterresource.org\nBold and italic emphasis added\nEditor’s note: Antarctic ozone was first measured in the International Geophysical Year of 1957, and there never has been a ‘hole’ in the ozone layer. There is a natural thinning over the poles that waxes and wanes, as seen in the image above. It there was an area with zero ozone over Antarctica, no-one would be able to live and work there.\nPlease Donate Below To Support Our Ongoing Work To Defend The Scientific Method PRINCIPIA SCIENTIFIC INTERNATIONAL, legally registered in the UK as a company incorporated for charitable purposes.

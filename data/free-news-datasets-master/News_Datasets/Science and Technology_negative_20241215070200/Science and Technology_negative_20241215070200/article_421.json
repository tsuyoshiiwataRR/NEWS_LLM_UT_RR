    "text": "Get help with your TalkTalk landline and calling features.\n24-10-2024 12:08 PM - edited 24-10-2024 12:14 PM\nToday both my phone connection and Internet are dreadful.\nTrying to make important calls to sort out muddles made by utility companies.\nThe line appears to be fine for a few minutes and then crashes - I literally asked the E.on Next lady if she had dropped her phone.\nWe tried on the smartphone and the call suddenly lost wifi calling and crashed too. It simply stopped.\nI called back on the landline and got a bit further, but the call collapsed into the equivalent of \"snowflakes\" on an old telly, i.e. crackle, crackle, crackle.\nIt recovered enough to finish what we were trying to do.\nI've been out and about dealing with other jobs and have come back to my router repeatedly losing the Internet connection.\nI can't fall back on Three....\nThe internet keeps disconnecting. Is something happening with the firmware? Check for repeated loss of connection this morning, please.\n42 minutes ago\nThank you [@Gliwmaeden2](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/46686)\nI've optimised the connection too and the SNR has increased.\nI will check in again with you on Monday to see how the connection has been over the weekend.\n48 minutes ago\nThat's it set up with the (much smarter looking!) microfilter now, [@Debbie-TalkTalk](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3838).\nan hour ago\nHi [@Gliwmaeden2](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/46686)\nI can now see the connection stats and the SNR is dropping low again.\nPlease can you connect the new microfilter to the test socket?\nan hour ago - last edited an hour ago\nNo, the router is NOT switched off.\nI have wifi right now.\nAre there issues at your end reaching it?\nAs I said, absolutely nothing has been touched all week since putting it in the test socket. [@Debbie-TalkTalk](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3838).\nan hour ago\nHi [@Gliwmaeden2](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/46686)\nSorry to hear this.\nThe line test is clear - No faults detected.\nHave you switched the router off this morning?\n3 hours ago\n[@Debbie-TalkTalk](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3838), could you possibly check at your end for dropouts in the connection?\nAfter a few nights where it seemed fine, the radio had stopped again in the wee small hours, Friday am.\nBUT, more seriously, a pupil needed to phone in when stuck in traffic and my landline had impossible static on it. I texted to tell them to try again and it was perfectly fine the second time.\nThey were really shocked at the awful noise the first time.\nThis was NOT after changing anything since the start of the week (so still plugged in at the test socket and not yet switched the microfilter).\nPlease could you test the line again to see if it's registering a fault as well as any disconnections?\nTuesday\nMorning [@Gliwmaeden2](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/46686)\nOh good\nYes it's always handy to have spare microfilters around just for testing.\nTuesday\nMy radio (on wifi) managed to continue uninterrupted overnight again.\nStill haven't had a moment to put the faceplate back on, so I'll report back if anything does change.\nIt probably is a good idea to have that microfilter on standby anyway.\nMany thanks!\nTuesday\nMorning [@Gliwmaeden2](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/46686)\nThanks for your reply.\nPlease let me know if you do experience any further issues.\nMonday\nFriday night there was another 3.30am drop out and I thought I might check Homesafe settings, but haven't had a chance.\nThe microfilter arrived Saturday, but the dropouts mysteriously have NOT happened Saturday night or Sunday night (having been around the same time every night since I got back after half term).\nVery odd!\nSo I have not yet tried the microfilter.\nThe first thing I need to do is put the faceplate back on soon, [@Debbie-TalkTalk](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3838), so I'll see if the better performance is then maintained without further intervention.\nMonday\nHi [@Gliwmaeden2](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/46686)\nDid you have a chance to connect up the new microfilter?\non 06-11-2024 02:02 PM\nHi [@Gliwmaeden2](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/46686)\nNo problem. At least we can rule everything out then.\nDebbie\non 06-11-2024 02:01 PM\nThanks - it might make a difference.\non 06-11-2024 01:58 PM\nHi [@Gliwmaeden2](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/46686)\nThanks for your reply.\nI've ordered a replacement microfilter, please allow 48hrs for this to arrive.\non 06-11-2024 01:45 PM\nSorry for the delayed reply. I had to go out.\nIt's not worth the risk of an engineer charge, [@Debbie-TalkTalk](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3838).\nBUT:\nIt's only Talktalk's equipment that is plugged in, and still at the test socket, so something is going wrong somewhere there especially if you sometimes get low SNR readings.\nThe landline phone is relatively new, as I bought one to see if it would sort occasional problems with phone calls in the past.\nThe newer smartphone is 8 months old, and both it and the 5 year old one are affected by the wifi disconnections.\nThat leaves us with the router (replaced after a power surge) and your microfilters.\nTalktalk doesn't send new microfilters in the boxes with new routers any more, so I don't have any unused ones left to try.\nIs it worth sending me a couple to see if it makes any difference?\nThere's an awful lot to be done here that means I can't afford time to wait in for engineers etc or major upheavals such as upgrading to full fibre instead (that would be a last resort) for the foreseeable....\non 06-11-2024 09:55 AM\nHi [@Gliwmaeden2](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/46686)\nThe line test is not detecting any line faults.\nWould you like me to arrange an engineer visit to the property? (Openreach)\non 06-11-2024 08:47 AM\nIt dropped again since my last post (so that's 3 times before 9am today). If the fault is on your side of the faceplate, surely an engineer should be out there checking connection points?\nThe engineers need to do a better job.\nIn these days of no bank branches, I have no option but to bank online and I can't just sit using public wifi somewhere instead as it is not secure enough. It really does need sorting!\nCan you get them onto this today, [@Debbie-TalkTalk](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3838)?\non 06-11-2024 07:23 AM\nHi [@Gliwmaeden2](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/46686)\nI can see that the SNR is still dropping low and this can affect the connection.\nI have now reset the data port and optimised the connection again and the SNR has increased.\nI will check on this again later this afternoon.\non 06-11-2024 07:19 AM\nWere you checking the line just now?\n06-11-2024 05:27 AM - edited 06-11-2024 06:26 AM\nIt seems to have dropped out again 3.30am, [@Debbie-TalkTalk](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3838).\nA bit of a pattern developing there.\nDid you spot any others?\nIt seemed OK during the day, but I don't use Sounds then.\nIs Talktalk doing something that would cause it to drop always at that time? Ongoing overnight \"works\"?\nStill all plugged in directly at the test socket.",

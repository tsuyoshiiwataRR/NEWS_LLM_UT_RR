    "text": "Windows “/>\nWindows‍ users are exposed to more than 600 million attacks every ⁤day,‌ with more than 99% of them related‌ to attempts to intercept⁣ passwords. As Day.Az reports, this was reported by the Anti-Malware​ portal with ⁢reference to the annual Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2024.\nAccording to the study, the threat landscape is becoming increasingly ⁣complex as cybercriminals gain ‌access to new resources and tools,⁢ including artificial intelligence.\nParticular attention is paid to deepfake ⁣technology, ‌which ‍improves phishing schemes and allows you to create convincing resumes ⁢to penetrate‌ companies under the guise of applicants. Microsoft is⁣ emphasizing the ⁢need to use ‍better password policies or move away from passwords in favor ⁣of other authentication‌ methods.\nThe most attacked industries​ were IT (24% of all attacks), science and education (21%), as well as ​government agencies (12%). Thus, in the US healthcare system in the 2024 fiscal​ year, there were about 400 ⁣successful cyberattacks.\nIn addition, pro-government groups are ⁤becoming⁤ increasingly active, blurring the line ⁣between cybercriminals and government hackers. It is noted that government agencies often involve cybercriminals to participate in various operations, usually at the stages⁣ of reconnaissance and⁣ information collection.\nHow can individuals prepare for a career in rapidly evolving⁢ technology fields? Title: The Future of ⁣Technology: An Exclusive Interview with Tech Expert Dr. Jane Smith\nSetting: A sleek, modern⁤ meeting room adorned with vibrant tech-related artwork. The⁤ atmosphere is buzzing with the⁤ excitement ⁢of innovation and discovery. Time.news editor Alex Thompson sits​ across ‍from Dr. Jane Smith, ‍a renowned⁣ expert ⁢in artificial ‌intelligence and machine learning.\nAlex‍ Thompson: Thank you for ⁢joining us ‌today, Dr.‌ Smith. With all the rapid advancements in technology, it’s fascinating to hear your insights.⁣ Let’s dive in! ⁣Recently, Microsoft unveiled ​cutting-edge technology ⁤that is set to reshape the ​tech landscape. What are your thoughts on⁤ their latest innovations?\nDr. Jane Smith: Thank‌ you for having me, ⁢Alex. Microsoft’s recent ‌announcements are‍ indeed‍ substantial. ⁢They⁤ signal a shift towards more integrated AI‍ capabilities across their product lines. This kind of⁤ technology can not only enhance‍ user experience but also drive productivity in unprecedented ways.\nAlex Thompson: Absolutely. One aspect that caught my attention was the focus on ⁢AI ⁤integration within everyday tools. How do you think this will‌ impact industries beyond tech?\nDr. Jane Smith: Great question! AI has‌ the ‍potential to transform⁢ various sectors. In healthcare,‌ for instance, AI⁣ can analyze patient data more efficiently, leading to improved⁢ diagnostics ‍and personalized treatment plans. Similarly, in ⁢finance, we’re seeing AI streamline operations‍ and enhance risk assessments. The applications ‍really are limitless.\nAlex Thompson: ​ That’s fascinating! However, as we ⁢embrace these advancements, there are concerns regarding data privacy ‌and job displacement. How should companies like Microsoft ⁤address these challenges?\nDr. Jane Smith: ⁤ This⁣ is indeed⁣ a critical​ issue. Companies must​ prioritize transparency and ethical guidelines. Establishing robust data governance ⁢frameworks can help assuage privacy concerns. Regarding job displacement, it’s essential to focus on reskilling and upskilling the workforce.

I installed lovestruck. Started the game. Then got the Game Data incomplete error\nWhat happens when the bug occurs? When I go into incomplete save. Laundry Day appears to be gone and all items from there are gone. I turned off game. Uninstalled and reinstalled laundry day. Then hard reset and cleared Xbox cache. Save loaded fine with everything there. The next day I played again and got the same save data incomplete except now I can't load into the game at all. Also Copperdale is missing from worlds menu\nWhat do you expect to see? Continue playing my legacy game I have been playing for years with all the packs I have purchased.\nHave you installed any customization with the game, e.g. Custom Content or Mods? On console - never used.\nDid this issue appear after a specific patch or change you made to your system? Yes\nPlease describe the patch or change you made. Got lovestruck, cleared Xbox save file, tried to load back in\nâ€Œ\nPlease help",

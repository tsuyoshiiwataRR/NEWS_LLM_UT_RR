    "text": "[[German](https://www.borncity.com/blog/2024/11/15/exchange-server-november-2024-sicherheitsupdates-wegen-problemen-gestoppt/)]Disaster for administrators of Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 and 2019 systems who have installed the security updates from November 12, 2024. The transport rules no longer work after applying the November 2024 security update. Microsoft has now stopped the deployment of the November 2024 security updates as of November 14, 2024 to investigate the problems. Advertising The November 2024 Updates Microsoft had released security updates (SU) for Exchange Server 2016 and 2019 on November 12, 2024. These updates are intended to close vulnerabilities found by Microsoft or security partners in Exchange Server. In addition, some new features such as improvements to Exchange Server AMSI integration or warnings against spoofing emails will be introduced. I had reported in the blog post [Microsoft Exchange Server Updates November 12, 2024](https://borncity.com/win/2024/11/13/microsoft-exchange-server-updates-november-12-2024/). Transport rules no longer work There was [this German comment](https://www.borncity.com/blog/2024/11/13/microsoft-exchange-server-updates-12-november-2024/#comment-199073) in my German blog on November 14, 2024, which reported that the transport rules for marking emails no longer work after the installation of the security update KB5044062 from November 2024. The application of such rules for flagging emails is explained [here](https://schweigerstechblog.de/exchange-mails-von-extern-besonders-hervorheben/) using an example. In the comments section of the German blog post [Microsoft Exchange Server Updates 12. November 2024](https://www.borncity.com/blog/2024/11/13/microsoft-exchange-server-updates-12-november-2024/) many administrators confirm that the transport rules no longer work after installing the update. There was a tip to restart the MSExchangeTransport service. However, this only helps temporarily, the transport rules only work again for about 30 to 60 minutes. There is [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/exchangeserver/comments/1gqvlym/issues_with_rules_after_november_su/) on reddit.com that complains about the same problems with transport rules not working. Furthermore, [this comment](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/released-november-2024-exchange-server-security-updates/4293125/replies/4296881) on the Techcommunity post Released: November 2024 Exchange Server Security Updates also mentions broken transport rules. Advertising Microsoft temporarily suspends the updates In the afternoon (CET) of November 14, 2024, Microsoft announced in the tech community post [Released:](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/released-november-2024-exchange-server-security-updates/4293125) [November 2024 Exchange Server Security Updates](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/released-november-2024-exchange-server-security-updates/4293125) that the rollout of the November 2024 security updates had been stopped. The download of the SU packages has been temporarily removed from the Microsoft servers and the rollout has been stopped. Microsoft is investigating the problems described above and will release the SU packages again as soon as possible.

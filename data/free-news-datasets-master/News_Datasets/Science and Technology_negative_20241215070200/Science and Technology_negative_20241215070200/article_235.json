This happened despite targeted interventions in priority areas including lifting operations, control of work at height, workplace transport, health hazards and electrical safety. All of these are identified as “persistent areas of attention” for the ONR.\nThe ONR’s mission is to protect society by securing safe nuclear operations, and its supervisory powers include oversight of health and safety at Great Britain’s nuclear licensed sites. While the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is the main government body responsible for the UK’s national workplace health and safety regulation, the ONR has developed and implemented its own regulatory strategy for NSHS, aligned under four main pillars.\nThose pillars include reinforcing the regulator’s NSHS capability, risk profiling, reviewing guidance and proactive industry engagement. Considerable emphasis is placed on the benefits of risk profiling practices, for both the regulator and dutyholders in driving improvements, enabling the ONR to target interventions and dutyholders to ensure more proactive and preventative identification of risk, particularly where information is shared across the industry.\nThe ONR’s report places particular emphasis on its expectations for proactive industry engagement and collaboration. The regulator expects to engage with dutyholders across a number of so-called “themes”, which it noted as key to driving improvements in NSHS. These themes include board level commitment to take action to make NSHS improvements, effective use of risk profiling covering both safety and health, adoption of recognised safety performance indicators, adequacy of incident investigations and effective discharge of the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 (CDM 2015) roles and duties.\n“We have seen increasing levels of construction and decommissioning activity on nuclear licensed sites in recent years. It is also now a legal requirement for RIDDOR reportable incidents to be reported direct to the ONR via their duty holder portal. It is not surprising therefore to read that the overall number of RIDDOR reports has increased in the last year,” said Phil Newton, a health and safety expert at Pinsent Masons.\n“However, the ONR has now responded with a clearly developed strategy for ensuring there will be targeted interventions and improvements in NSHS. Dutyholders should take stock on progress to date against these themes so they are prepared for when the ONR inevitably come calling,” he said.",

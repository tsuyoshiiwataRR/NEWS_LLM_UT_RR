    "text": "PyPI dropped existing support for digital attestations\nPyPI dropped existing support for digital attestations\nPosted Nov 15, 2024 5:07 UTC (Fri) by bignose (subscriber, #40)In reply to:\n[PyPI dropped existing support for digital attestations](/Articles/998238/)by Cyberax\nParent article:\n[PyPI now supports digital attestations](/Articles/998215/)\nI'll take that as confirmation that no, there is no such thing today. Which confirms the issue I raised: the existing community-controlled identity system was dropped (for good reason), with no community-controlled replacement (because the PSF decided centralised, proprietary, platform-controlled solutions are good enough). And no evident plan to fix that, not then and not now.\nThe absence of a new solution is not the PSF's fault nor responsibility. The *removal of the existing system*, while there was and is no equivalent community-controlled replacement, is their responsibility and is the issue I'm glad to see we agree is true.\n> Actually, it was not \"yours\". It belongs to the Python Software Foundation\nThe GnuPG web of trust (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust) is the identity solution we still have but the Python Software Foundation decided to stop supporting (again: for good reasons!) in 2023. If you think that belonged to the Python Software Foundation, I think this discussion isn't going anywhere useful.",

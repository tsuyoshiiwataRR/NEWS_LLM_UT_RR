The damage had been done!\"\nUS Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-WI)\ntold CNN in an interview earlier this year, \"Bob Good didn’t come here to govern. He came here to be famous. Bob Good’s wearing our jersey, and he’s not on the team. If you look at what we have not been able to accomplish in this Congress, it’s predominantly because of Bob Good and his ilk.\"\nStill, Politico reports the letter penned by 5th District Republican Congressional Committee Chair Rick Buchanan asks Trump to rethink his decision.\nIn an effort to \"strongly urge\" the MAGA leader to back Good, the 25 Virginia GOP lawmakers wrote, \"We hope President Trump reconsiders his ill-advised endorsement and stands with the Grassroots America First supporters of Congressman Bob Good.\"\nREAD MORE:\n'Bad for the USA': Trump unleashes on top GOP rep who defended him outside courthouse\nPolitico's full report is available\nat this link.

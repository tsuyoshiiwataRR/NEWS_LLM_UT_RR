And he completely ignored the investigations into the election he commissioned which told him he lost and the same conclusions from those in his administration. As Liz Cheney predicted, he won't make that mistake again, will only surround himself with those who will tell him what he wants to hear and is plotting even now how to overthrow yet another election.",

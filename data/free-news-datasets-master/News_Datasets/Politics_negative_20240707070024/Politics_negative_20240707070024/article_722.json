    "text": "KHARTOUM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- General Commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan on Thursday said the army will fight the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) \"until the end.\"\nAl-Burhan, also chairman of Sudan's Transitional Sovereign Council, made the remarks while addressing the army's 18th Infantry Division in Kosti city in the White Nile State, according to a statement from the sovereign council.\n\"We will fight the terrorist RSF militia to the bitter end, even if we only have one last soldier left,\" Al-Burhan stressed in the statement.\nMeanwhile, the army chief vowed a harsh response to the \"RSF's crimes\" in Wad Al-Noura village in Gezira State, referring to an earlier RSF attack that killed more than one hundred civilians.\nViolent clashes have recently been raging between the SAF and the RSF in Khartoum State and the Gezira State in central Sudan, as well as in the White Nile State in the south and North Darfur State in the west.\nThe escalations are part of a larger conflict between the two parties across Sudan since April 15, 2023, which has so far claimed 15,550 lives and displaced over 8.8 million people nationwide, according to recent estimates by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, excluding the latest fatalities reported. â– ",

    "text": "Donald Trump returns to campaign trail with rally at Phoenix church Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Thursday with a trip to Arizona, his first appearance in a battleground state since he was convicted in a hush money scandal, repeating his critiques of the case against him as politically motivated and calling for his conviction to be overturned on appeal. “Those appellate courts have to step up and straighten things out or we’re not going to have a country anymore,\" Trump said at a Phoenix town hall organized by Turning Point, a conservative youth organization that has seen its influence rise alongside Trump’s takeover of the GOP. Trump is expected to appeal last month's conviction on all 34 charges in his New York hush money trial, in which he became the first former American president to be convicted of felony crimes. He responded defiantly to the verdict against him a day after a New York jury found him guilty last week of a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor but had not spoken directly to the swing-state voters who will decide the November election until Thursday, when he used a profanity to decry the “fake” and politically motivated case against him. The crowd of thousands inside the mega church, where bass for the pre-show and introductory music was turned up so high that it shook seats and media camera shots, chanted the same profanity in response. The Phoenix Police Department said 11 people at the event were transported to hospitals after reports of heat exhaustion. It was 107 degrees outside when Trump started speaking at the town hall, where many of Trump’s supporters were unable to get inside before it reached capacity. 1st public campaign event since convictions Trump returns to the campaign trail with a trip to Arizona on Thursday, his first appearance in a battleground state since he was convicted of 34 felonies in a hush money trial last week. Trump, who lost Arizona by a little more than 10,000 votes in 2020, has not spoken directly to swing state voters since last week’s court decision in New York. Hours before he is scheduled to speak, Jake Hoffman, a Republican state senator who is also a Turning Point consultant, will be arraigned for his role as a fake elector in an alleged plot to overturn Trump's loss in Arizona. → [Get more Arizona politics news](https://kjzz.org/politics)",

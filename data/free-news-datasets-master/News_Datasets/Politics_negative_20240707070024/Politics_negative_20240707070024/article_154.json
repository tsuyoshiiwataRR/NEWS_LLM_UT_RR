His criminal record and despicable behavior undermine national security as well as trust, leadership and morale among the men and women who risk their lives to defend our nation. Over the past three decades, Trump has been a defendant or plaintiff in more than 4,000 lawsuits, and last week a jury found him guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal or commit a crime. It was only the first of the criminal trials he faces. Trump's lack of ethical standards and integrity goes against everything the U.S. military stands for. He has proved that under pressure, he will crack. If he were to become commander in chief again, he might well compromise our country by giving in to coercion or revealing secrets that could get Americans killed. Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning. A felon serving as both leader of the free world and commander in chief would disrupt the military's culture and institutional structure as we know it. National security keeps our military members alive. Heck, it keeps us all alive. Allowing someone who flagrantly disregards the law and authority of any manner to lead our armed services would not keep our nation secure. Cybersecurity and international espionage are a dangerous game, and for someone like Trump to have the cheat codes would be like showing your child how to use one tap to make in-app purchases, then telling them not to buy any games. Americas adversaries are watching and taking notes. They would welcome the former president's tarnished moral compass because it could be used to weaken America's national security. Trump as commander in chief would hurt America's global credibility Former military leaders, such as retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, who served during the Trump administration have called him dangerous and unfit. Trump has injured relationships between the United States and its allies, and his actions on the international stage were seen as weak and unstable, directly harming diplomatic relations. And with Trump back in the White House, our nation's global reputation and credibility would be hurt at a time when threats from China, Iran and Russia appear to be growing. As both a felon and the commander in chief, Trump's lack of character would undercut morale in our armed services, leading to greater problems with retention. In Bob Woodard's book \"Rage,\" Trump told a former adviser, My f---ing generals are a bunch of p---ies. It wasnt the first or the last time he berated our militarys most revered leaders. Remember when he called service members who made the ultimate sacrifice losers and suckers? I do. Think of war widows. Trump's callous insult of the military won't be forgotten this Memorial Day. As a military spouse, I am lucky to have met, served and supported many military leaders and our nation's greatest families. Military life isnt for losers and suckers, and the weak will not fare well here. Strength and resilience are the glue that holds the military together, and our military leaders' attention should be focused on mission readiness and defense, not mitigating Trump's PR nightmares. The U.S. military prides itself on decorum, discipline, respect and an honorable reputation. Trump exhibits none of those qualities. Felons generally can't serve in the military In the values and character section of the Make it make sense. Our nation now teeters on a cliff. Will a felon be elected to lead Americas military and tasked with helping to instill a warrior's ethos, morale and camaraderie among those who protect our nation in a hostile world? Whether voters choose to embrace or ostracize the convicted former president will shape the image and culture of America's military for decades to come. - Over the past three decades, Trump has been a defendant or plaintiff in more than 4,000 lawsuits, and last week a jury found him guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal or commit a crime.

Felons generally can't serve in the military In the values and character section of the Go Army website , it states that a person convicted of a felony is generally not permitted to join the military.

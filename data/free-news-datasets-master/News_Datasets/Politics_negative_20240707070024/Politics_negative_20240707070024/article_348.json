    "text": "NC Senate Democrats walk out before vote on surprise bill that could benefit GOP candidates Published in [Political News](/politics/politicalnews/) A North Carolina General Assembly bill meant as a compromise on changing the state’s mask law would also change campaign finance law to allow more dark money donations. All state Senate Democrats walked out in protest ahead of the vote on Thursday. The measure passed 28-0 in the 50-member Senate. Republican Senate leader Phil Berger called out each Democratic senator’s name during the vote, but they had all left the chamber. Democrats painted it as a way to benefit the Republican candidate for governor, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson. “What we’re really concerned about is out-of-state billionaires flooding money into our state, without any accountability,” Sen. Mary Wills Bode told The News & Observer later Thursday. The campaign finance part of the bill eliminates some rules about reporting campaign contributions put in place by the State Board of Elections. It also eliminates the requirement that a political group’s assistant or deputy treasurer reside in North Carolina. Berger said the changes were made because Republican lawmakers felt they “needed to be done as a way to level the playing field in terms of money” coming to candidates from four partisan political groups, the Democratic Governors Association, Democratic Attorneys General Association, Republican Governors Association and Republican Attorneys General Association. In May 2020, the State Board of Elections issued an advisory opinion to the Democratic Governors Association saying that certain federal political committees that get money from corporations can’t give money to state political-party committees, because that would go around the ban on corporations giving directly in North Carolina. Berger told reporters after that the law still prohibits corporate contributions and the bill “just makes it an equal situation as far as those types of organizations bringing money into North Carolina.” Berger described the majority-Democratic Board of Elections decision as enabling money from the Democratic governors and attorneys general groups to come directly into state parties in unlimited amounts, but preventing the same for Republicans. ...continued ©2024 The Charlotte Observer.

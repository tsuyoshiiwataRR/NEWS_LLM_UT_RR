    "text": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has fired up in Parliament over a Greens question about military exports, amid growing social divisions over the Gaza war. \\u003cbr\\u003eThe prime minister was responding to a question from Griffith MP Max Chandler-Mather about a $917 million Defence contract with Israeli military technology company Elbit Systems, which is blacklisted in Norway and Denmark for violations of humanitarian law.The Greens have also been pursuing Defence in Senate Estimates over Australia's role in exporting a part used in the manufacture of Israeli Air Force F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. \\u003cbr\\u003eMr Bandt said the attorney-general made defamatory comments about him relating to the protests in a media interview on Wednesday.\\u003cbr\\u003eThe Greens believe that data relied on by the prime minister to deny exporting weapons to Israel is based on a too-narrow definition of weapons, which should include parts, as per a United Nations treaty. \\u003cbr\\u003eThe UN has previously called on nations to stop exporting weapons to Israel.\\u003cbr\\u003eDefence is investigating whether its staff are among hundreds of public servants to have signed a petition calling on the Albanese government to cease all military exports to Israel. Officials revealed during a Senate Estimates hearing on Wednesday that they do not consider the question of whether an F-45 is being deployed for use to bomb Gaza as material when deciding whether to grant an export permit. \\u003cb\\u003eWith AAP\\u003c/b\\u003e",

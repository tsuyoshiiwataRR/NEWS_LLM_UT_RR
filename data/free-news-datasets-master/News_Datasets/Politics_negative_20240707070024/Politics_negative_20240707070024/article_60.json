    "text": "Carrie Howell, who lives in rural Georgia, is the mother of a bisexual 13-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old boy whose car seat is his favorite color: pink.\nIf either child comes out as transgender some day, she will not be upset in the slightest.\n“I would get on the phone and start looking for doctors” to support them, said Howell, a 33-year-old automotive technician. “I don’t think there should be any laws restricting gender-affirming care for any age. I don’t. If there were more protections in place, then children would feel more confident about reaching out.”\nDarcy Quimby, 56, a political independent from the Palm Desert, California, area, sees the question as more complicated.\nQuimby said she previously identified as bisexual but today is in a monogamous relationship with a man and thinks the LGBTQ+ community has become too vocal, too prominent, too pushy and too obsessed with sexuality as an identity.\nThere’s now a new queer character “every time you turn on the TV,” she said, and kids are being swept up into thinking that being LGBTQ+ — and transgender in particular— is “just a great new fad.”\n “I find it hard to believe there’s that many transgenders in the world — you know, true transgenders,” Quimby said.\n“There are probably some kids who are truly transgender, but I think it’s more of a phase, and unfortunately this phase has dire consequences with some people who really just realize — ‘Wait, no, I really wasn’t’ — and now it’s irreversible,” Quimby said, referring to bodily changes that can come from things like hormone treatments, which she opposes for children.\nAmericans are deeply divided on issues involving queer children, especially kids who identify as transgender or nonbinary, according to a nationwide poll conducted for the Los Angeles Times by NORC at the University of Chicago. Howell and Quimby were among the poll respondents who agreed to follow-up interviews with reporters.\nFifty-four percent of U.S. adults favor laws to prevent transgender children younger than 18 from receiving gender-affirming care such as surgery or puberty blockers, the survey shows. Forty-four percent oppose such laws.\n...continued swipe to next page « 1 2 3 4 » View full story\n©2024 Los Angeles Times. Visit at latimes.com.

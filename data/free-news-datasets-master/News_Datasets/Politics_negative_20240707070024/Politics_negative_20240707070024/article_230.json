    "text": "The Heartland Institute’s Donald Kendal, Jim Lakely, and Chris Talgo present episode 452 of the In The Tank Podcast. In the hours after our show ended last week, the verdicts began rolling in for former President Donald Trump’s “hush money” case – 34 convictions. We are truly in unprecedented territory. What does this mean for Trump? What does this mean for the election? And most importantly, what does this mean for America? Also, a new report was released that shines even more light on the Covid lab leak theory and the role the United States played in funding that research.

South Korea has called the latest provocation from its nuclear-armed neighbour “irrational” and “low-class” but, unlike the North´s spate of recent ballistic missile launches, the trash campaign does not violate UN sanctions on Kim´s isolated government.\nThe defector group Fighters for Free North Korea announced on Thursday they had launched 10 balloons northward carrying 200,000 leaflets and 5,000 USB flash drives containing Korean pop music and TV shows, as well as thousands of one-dollar bills. A photograph released by the group showed an activist holding up a large poster with photographs of the North´s leader Kim Jong Un and his sister and chief government spokeswoman Kim Yo Jong.\nSpaceX’s megarocket Starship launches on fourth test flight This still image taken from a SpaceX broadcast shows the SpaceX Starship launching on its fourth flight test from...\nTwo UK judges resign from Hong Kong top court Jonathan Sumption, left, said he would make a statement about his resignation in time, while Lawrence Collins cited...\nPrince Harry wins bid to appeal UK security ruling File: Britain's Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex waves as he arrives at the Royal Courts of Justice, Britain's High Court,...\nYemen clashes kill 18 fighters in fresh flare-up Fighters affiliated with Yemen's Southern Transitional Council, in 2022. — AFP/fileDUBAI: At least 18 combatants...\nUkraine orders evacuations from parts of Donetsk Local residents walk past a house damaged by recent shelling in the course of Russia-Ukraine conflict the village of...\nSudan committee says at least 104 killed in village attack People shop at a vegetable market in Gedaref city in eastern Sudan on June 6, 2024. — AFPPORT SUDAN, Sudan: A...\nMichael Jackson Biopic Expected To Be Lionsgate's Biggest Movie Ever Lindsay Hubbard Accuses Carl Radke Of ‘Villainising’ Her Alan Scarfe, Veteran Actor And Sci-fi Fixture, Dies At 77 Kate Winslet Reveals Her Favourite Improvised Moment In 'The Regime' US, Global Allies Call On Hamas To Close Gaza Ceasefire Agreement Johnny Wactor, Late ‘General Hospital’ Alum’s Remains Cremated After Death Kathie Lee Gifford Recalls Insult From ‘Charlie’s Angels’ Casting Agent Netflix Sued By Woman Over Baby Reindeer Character",

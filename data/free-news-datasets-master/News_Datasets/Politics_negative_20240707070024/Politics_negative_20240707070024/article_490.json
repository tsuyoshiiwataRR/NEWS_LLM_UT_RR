    "text": "What makes someone instinctively defend a monster? I don’t mean a legal defense, to which everyone is entitled. Nor do I mean exonerating someone after the facts are known. I’m talking about instinctively defending a monster purely out of some inexplicable affinity with him.\nThat was the spectacle du jour on social media yesterday, when an official Israeli account posted a video of female soldiers as they were taken hostage. The Hamas terrorists taunt and salivate over the women, some of whom are bloodied from the attacks. There was nothing ambiguous about what the fatigue-clad barbarians meant or intended.\nNevertheless, a darkly pedantic argument ensued on Twitter/X. The Israeli account had mistranslated one of the words to suggest the terrorists were specifically pointing out which women were fertile. Hamas apologists took to social media to rain down approbation on the video and those who shared it. They suggested other parts of the video were mistranslated, and therefore that the whole scene was portrayed falsely.\nTo review: The scene they’re talking about is Hamas terrorists taking women hostage during an extremely bloody spree of murder and sexual violence. It was obviously not the case that this video showed anything other than monsters behaving monstrously. There is only one reaction to such a video that marks you as worthy of participating in society, and it is not, as the anti-Zionist twitter horde spat, “hey nobody said the word ‘pregnant,’ you hasbarists!”\nEventually, Palestinians who aren’t Hamasniks logged on to point out that in fact the terrorists were referring to the women essentially as sex slaves and were referencing Islamic scripture. If anything, then, the one modest translation error had underplayed how sick and twisted the Hamasniks’ words were.",

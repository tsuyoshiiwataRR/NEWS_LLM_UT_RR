Above the people, the legislature and now the courts.”\nWA GOP Chair Jim Walsh posted a\nresponse on Facebook that says in part: \"The cynical thing about Reykdal encouraging public school districts to break the law is that he faces little (direct) consequence. The districts will be the ones sued and held liable if they follow his dumb advice. WA school districts: Ignore Chris Reykdal. Do the right thing. Follow the law.\"\nThe lawsuit challenging the new law was filed 2 weeks ago and this week King County Superior Court denied the plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order, which would have blocked it from taking effect Thursday.\nOn June 21, the Court will consider a preliminary injunction.",

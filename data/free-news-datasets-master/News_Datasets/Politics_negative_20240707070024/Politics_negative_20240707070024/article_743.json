    "text": "Free Palestine - Stop Genocide. The genocide does not exist. Stop saying it does. ( [Image](https://farm66.static.flickr.com/65535/53334876563_5e01ac010e.jpg)by [alisdare1](https://www.flickr.com/people/59952459@N08/)) [Details](/populum/attrdetails.php?vid=180105) [DMCA](/populum/dmca.php?vid=180105) The ratio of combatant-to-civilian casualties in Gaza should be recognized as a historical achievement of protecting civilian lives. “The genocide in Gaza” cause has been roiling university campuses in the US and around the globe. The genocide accusation is the subject of a lawsuit filed by South Africa against Israel at the International Court of Justice and has been repeated by a few other countries, some scholars, endless activists, and one US congresswoman. Its political importance is not restricted to Israel. President Biden, it is argued, might be punished in the upcoming elections by progressive voters for complicity with this alleged genocide. The accusation could thus exert tremendous influence on world politics. This is a fascinating socio-political phenomenon since it is easy to prove that there is no genocide.",

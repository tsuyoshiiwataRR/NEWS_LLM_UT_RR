    "text": "Re\nIndia's opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi yesterday demanded a parliamentary probe into stock market moves before and after the exit polls following the country's recently concluded national elections.\nDuring a press conference, Rahul pointed out that the the stock markets experienced a surge following the release of \"fake\" exit polls, only to crash on June 4, t the day the Lok Sabha poll votes were counted.\nHe emphasised this was the \"biggest stock market scam\" and that retail investors suffered a staggering loss of Rs 30tn.\nRahul alleged that BJP leaders had prior knowledge that the exit polls were inaccurate and demanded a JPC probe into the matter\nMeanwhile, two pollsters said the exit polls could not accurately capture discontent among the social and economic castes in the key states, resulting in an overestimation of electoral support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party.\nThree of five polls initially projected Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party would win more than the 303 electoral seats it won in 2019, while the opposition INDI alliance led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party would win 125 to 182 seats.\nHowever, vote counts showed much lower numbers - around 240 for the BJP and 293 for Modi's alliance that includes regional parties.\nPradeep Gupta, head of Axis My India poll agency, said the survey failed to capture a shift among voters in the less privileged sections of society in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Maharashtra states, where 170 seats in total were up for grabs, and where BJP lost a whopping 45 seats, compared to 2019.\n\"This is our mistake,\" Gupta said.\nHe noted many voters in those sections of society didn't disclose their voting decisions for fear of being attacked by electoral workers who did not share their political views.\n\"We could not predict as accurately as we are known for,\" he said, referring to challenges in capturing how voters had swung in favour of the opposition from other regional parties.\nOver 900 people were deployed for face-to-face post-ballot interviews with a sample of 582,000 voters, with the response rate varying from 40-50% in urban areas and 70-80% in rural areas, Gupta said.\nMany women voters asked males in their families to respond on their behalf, resulting in wrong estimations of their voting decisions, he said.\n\"We are wrong in 2024,\" said Yashwant Deshmukh, head of CVoter polling agency, whose numbers were overestimated by about 50 seats in favour of Modi's party amid incorrect projections for Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.\n\"I wish I could stop giving seat numbers but that's a professional hazard\" as the media keeps asking for those estimates, Deshmukh said.\nRahul Gandhi, a senior leader of Congress party, shows a paper as he speaks during a media briefing at the party headquarters in New Delhi, India.",

    "text": "Operation Blue Star anniversary marked by pro-Khalistan slogans at Golden Temple On the 40th anniversary of Operation Blue Star in the north Indian state of Punjab, some members of the Sikh community on Thursday (June 6) raised pro-Khalistan slogans within the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar, the site of the military operation to weed out separatists. Posters of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the prominent Khalistani separatist at the time, were also seen during the demonstration. Blue Star Operation Indian Army&#039;s ‘Blue Star Operation’ began on June 1, 1984. The operation was carried out to eliminate Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who had taken shelter in the Golden Temple. × The then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had approved the operation, which had a massive repercussion, leading to violent communal clashes. The operation took place from June 1 to June 10, 1984. Security beefed up in Amritsar The Punjab police have beefed up security across Amritsar in order to prevent any unforeseen incidents. The police have deployed around 2,300 jawans to guard Amritsar City. This includes two companies of the BSF, one of the CRPF, as well as 1,000 anti-riot police personnel, and officers from neighbouring districts, said a police spokesperson. Security forces have been deployed throughout Amritsar, with checkpoints established on roads leading to the Golden Temple and SGPC task force personnel bolstering security within the complex. The Dal Khalsa organised a procession in memory of those who lost their lives during Operation Blue Star, referring to it as a &quot;holocaust remembrance&quot; parade. The radical group also announced a call for an Amritsar Bandh on June 6. The occasion also came in the wake of the overwhelming election victories of detained radical Sikh leader Amritpal Singh and Sarabjeet Singh Khalsa, the son of Beant Singh, one of the assassins of former PM Indira Gandhi.

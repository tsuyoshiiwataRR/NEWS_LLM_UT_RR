    "text": "In the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections in Jammu and Kashmir, a staggering 89 out of 100 candidates lost their security deposits, reflecting a significant disparity in votes garnered. The Election Commission data highlighted a decisive mandate given by voters to the eventual winners across the union territory.Independent Candidate Emerges Victorious in BaramullaSheikh Abdul Rashid, an Independent contender, emerged victorious in the Baramulla Lok Sabha seat, defeating prominent political figures such as former chief minister Omar Abdullah and People's Conference president Sajad Gani Lone. Notably, Rashid secured less than 50 per cent of the total votes polled, with a vote share of 45.70 per cent. Baramulla stood out as the only constituency where the third-placed candidate, Sajad Gani Lone, managed to retain his security deposit.Varied Performance of Winning CandidatesThe winning candidates displayed varying levels of success in securing votes across different constituencies. National Conference leader Aga Roohullah Mehdi secured the highest percentage of votes at 52.85 in one constituency, while BJP's Jugal Kishore, winning from Jammu Lok Sabha seat, achieved a vote share of 52.80 per cent. In Udhampur, BJP leader and Union Minister Jitendra Singh received 51.28 per cent of the votes, securing victory for the third consecutive time.Setback for Ghulam Nabi Azad's PartyGhulam Nabi Azad's Democratic Progressive Azad Party (DPAP) faced a setback in the elections as all three of its candidates failed to secure their security deposits. None of the party candidates managed to attain even four per cent of the votes, indicating a significant challenge in the electoral landscape.Representation of Women CandidatesOut of the seven women candidates in the fray across the five constituencies, only PDP president Mehbooba Mufti succeeded in saving her security deposit, marking a notable presence amidst the predominantly male electoral field.The Lok Sabha elections in Jammu and Kashmir witnessed a notable trend of candidates losing their security deposits, reflecting the decisive mandate given by voters to the eventual winners. The varied performance of winning candidates and the challenges faced by certain political parties underscore the dynamic nature of electoral politics in the region.110698031110704857110732391",

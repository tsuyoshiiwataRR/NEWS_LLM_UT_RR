    "text": "Ryan J. Reilly and Victoria Ebner @ NBC : Judge orders Steve Bannon to report to prison on July 1 for contempt of Congress sentence The former Trump adviser was sentenced to four months in prison for refusing to comply with Jan. 6 Committee subpoenas, but it had been put on hold while he appealed.\nKathleen Culliton @ Raw Story : ‘It pays to be Clarence’: Data shows justice raked in ‘staggering’ $4 million in gifts Supreme Court Justices have received about $4.7 million in gifts over the past two decades — more than $4 million of which was pocketed by Clarence Thomas, newly revealed data show.\nKate Briquelet @ The Daily Beast : Moms for Liberty Boss in Nazi-Quoting Flub Now Runs for Indiana Governor A Moms for Liberty activist who caught heat last summer after her Indiana chapter quoted Adolf Hitler in a newsletter is back—and now she’s running for governor.\nTommy Christopher @ Mediaite : Trump Absurdly Claims To Hannity He Thought ‘It Was Terrible’ When Crowds Chanted ‘Lock Her Up!’ Former President Donald Trump absurdly claimed to Sean Hannity that he “thought it was terrible” when his rally crowds would start chanting “Lock her up!” — despite copious evidence to the contrary.\nAngry White Men : Stew Peters Continues To Defend ‘Heroic’ Nazi Book Burnings In March, Holocaust denier and white nationalist Stew Peters dedicated a segment on his Rumble show to defending the Nazi book burnings and their destruction of Germany’s Institute for Sexual Research. Peters called those book burnings “awesome” and said that Adolf Hitler was a “hero” for it.\nEric Hananoki @ Media Matters : Pro-Trump event in Michigan will feature numerous speakers with histories of anti-Muslim rhetoric The Trump-backed ReAwaken America tour is holding an event in Michigan this week that will feature numerous speakers with histories of anti-Muslim rhetoric. Those commentators have said that “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL,” bragged about helping Trump with his “Muslim ban,” and claimed that “Muslims are stockpiling weapons in Islamic centers.” They have claimed that “Islam is a terrorist organization,” that “Islam has been and remains the GREATEST threat to the Western Civilization,” and that ”Islam IS NOT our friend.”\nEvery day, Right Wing Watch exposes extremism to help the public, activists, and journalists understand the strategies and tactics of anti-democratic forces—and respond to an increasingly aggressive and authoritarian far-right movement. The threat is growing, but our resources are not. Any size contribution will help us continue our work and become more effective at disrupting the ideologies, people, and organizations that threaten our freedom and democracy. Please make an investment in Right Wing Watch’s defense of the values we share.",

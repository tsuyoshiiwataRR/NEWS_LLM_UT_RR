    "text": "NAACP Urges Biden to Reverse Course on Israel Before It’s Too Late\n“It is one thing to call for a ceasefire, it is another to take the measures necessary to work towards liberation for all.”\nJoe Biden’s continued support of Israel’s brutal war on Gaza has crossed a line for the NAACP.\nThe civil rights organization on Thursday released a\nstatement urging the Biden administration to end weapons shipments to Israel and calling for “an immediate and permanent ceasefire.”\n“As the nation’s leading civil rights organization, it is our responsibility to speak out in the face of injustice and work to hold our elected officials accountable for the promises they’ve made,” said NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson. “Over the past months, we have been forced to bear witness to unspeakable violence, affecting innocent civilians, which is unacceptable.”\nThe statement cites Israel’s offensive in Rafah, where displaced Palestinians from across Gaza have been forced to flee, noting that over Memorial Day weekend, the Israeli military\nkilled 45 Palestinians (with U.S.-made weapons) and injured over 200 people, many of whom were young children. Johnson also said in the statement the U.S.’s efforts were key to ending the conflict.\n“The Middle East conflict will only be resolved when the U.S. government and international community take action, including limiting access to weapons used against civilians,” Johnson said. “The NAACP calls on President Biden to draw the red line and indefinitely end the shipment of weapons and artillery to the state of Israel and other states that supply weapons to Hamas and other terrorist organizations.”\n“It is one thing to call for a ceasefire, it is another to take the measures necessary to work towards liberation for all.”\nThe statement is unexpected, especially since the organization has historically been on good terms with Democrats. Last month, Biden\nspoke at the Detroit NAACP’s 69th annual Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner, where he received a lifetime achievement award.\n“My name’s Joe Biden and I’m a lifetime member of the NAACP. Matter of fact, the first organization I ever joined was the NAACP,” Biden said at the event.\nWill this statement sway Biden’s support for Israel’s war, though? The Biden administration has shown no sign of changing its policies, even though, as the war’s eighth month begins, Israel has\nkilled nearly 37,000 Palestinians, including at least 15,000 children, with thousands more civilians missing.\nThe right thing to do now, as it has been for a long time, is to do what the NAACP, as well as the The New Republic’s editors recommend:\nEnd weapons shipments to Israel.",

    "text": "Auburn City Council voted no on a liquor store at the former location of Family Dollar on North Donahue Drive. In its Tuesday meeting, the council voted against the conditional use of a University Wine and Spirits package store on the property at 316 N. Donahue Drive. During the meeting, Auburn residents and property owners opposed the liquor store due to concerns about safety and respect for their property. Stephen Faulk, pastor at Auburn A.M.E Zion Church, said that the law does allow the city to restrict businesses that may sell liquor close to a church. Auburn A.M.E. Zion Church is located at 576 Martin Luther King Drive, and Faulk said if approved, it would be the third liquor store in their community. “We would like to ask that you would look at sharing opposition and voting against that liquor store,” he said. “I really wish, and the members of the community have also expressed, that something else could be done besides a liquor store...” People are also reading… Faulk said that they are concerned because people come to the church parking lot and drink often, and many of them are strangers. “I don’t want us to continue to have to have confrontations with these people,” he said. “And then there will be national attention brought on because of a confrontation with somebody drinking and throwing alcohol, containers, and bottles, disrespecting our church property.” Krishna Sanghani, who would’ve been the new owner of the University Wine and Spirits, thanked the church members for listening to him explain why he wanted to the store. “The concerns that I saw were mainly about safety; number two, the church; and number three, theft,” Sanghani said. “To this, I came up with a few things in my head, which I’d like to point out as an experienced business owner from the past few years, also running liquor stores within the Auburn city limits.” Sanghani said there are plenty of liquor stores on the railroad, and the Auburn police are doing a good job of making sure everyone is safe. “If people are stumbling and drinking and making their way across the railroad, you can easily say that the Auburn PD has failed, which I don’t believe so,” he said. “...When people steal at my current liquor stores, we work very well with Auburn PD as well as AI technology, to make sure that we actually catch those thieves and put them in jail.” Sanghani said that his business model is very different from the other two liquor stores in the area. “We are a wine and a fine spirits store, not just a liquor store,” he said. “... Things we have done, which I can argue that we have done for our communities, and we’ve supported local brands, such as Wild Leap, John Emerald Distilling Company – in order to get these products in Auburn, we require a liquor store that comes with a different business model.” Though the council has already voted against the liquor store, Sanghani hopes the council will reconsider. “When Family Dollar closed down, we saw this as an opportunity to kind of repurpose that, and we feel like we could do things right within the community,” he said. “...Selling stuff such as just sodas, candies, chips, bread, milk, frozen meals… and then we started reconsidering fresh groceries, fresh fruit, breakfast… That’s why we didn’t propose for an 8,000-square-foot liquor store because it’s not necessary. We felt like we could achieve that with half the building, and the other half we could have done the rest with groceries.” Other council business The Auburn City Council discussed a sidewalk from Old Mill Road to McKinley Avenue. After the discussion, they asked the city manager and her staff to come up with ideas related to some of the houses in the area that have had some issues with accidents. Mayor Ron Anders said they will let the community and public know when they will have answers. The city council approved a financial contribution to the Jay and Susie Gogue Performing Arts Center at Auburn University for its build-out project. The amount will be $5 million over 10 years or $500,000 a year. A contract with Auburn Game Day Law Enforcement Corporation and area public safety agencies was approved to provide supplemental public safety services for sporting events and/or special events at Auburn University from August 1, 2024, to July 31, 2025. The city council unanimously approved the exemption of certain “Back to School” sales tax holiday items from city sales taxes from Friday, July 19, to Sunday, July 21. The city council nominated Chris Hall, a worker in inspection services, as the employee of the month. The city council also gave service awards to Rick Willmon, who worked with public works for 15 years; Norman Pitts, who worked with environmental services for 30 years; and Phyllis Reese, who worked with the police department for 50 years. It was also announced that the Juneteenth parade will be on June 14 at 6 p.m., and a Juneteenth celebration at Kiesel Park will be on June 15.

    "text": "Senate blocks passage of sweeping ‘Right to Contraception’ bill\nJune 06, 2024\n»\nContinue to this story on CNA\nCWN Editor's Note: A “Right to Contraception Act” failed to advance in the US Senate on a key procedural vote on June 5.\nThe bill, introduced by Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts (who is Catholic), included sweeping provisions that might have required health-care workers to cooperate in gender-change surgery, sterilization, and abortion. Access to contraceptives is not in danger, opponents of the legislation observed. But Terry Schilling of the American Principles Project argued that “in the details [of the bill] lurks a radical change, which the vast majority of Americans oppose.”The above note supplements, highlights, or corrects details in the original source (link above).\n[About CWN news coverage.](/news/about_our_coverage/)\nFor all current news,\n[visit our News home page](/news).\nAll comments are moderated.

    "text": "Waste of the Day: Throwback Thursday: Kentucky Spends on Sidewalks That Residents Don’t Want Topline: Most residents of Lexington, Kentucky never wanted a sidewalk on Tates Creek Road. They said foot traffic was “non-existent.” But after 12 years of trying, Lexington finally installed the sidewalks at a cost of $1.7 million in 2013, forcing down wasteful spending like bad medicine. The money combined local, state and federal funding and would be worth $2.3 million today. Most of the ordeal is documented in the “Wastebook” reporting published by the late U.S. Senator Dr. Tom Coburn. For years, these reports shined a white-hot spotlight on [federal frauds and taxpayer abuses](https://web.archive.org/web/20141115202904/https:/www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/oversightaction). Coburn, the legendary U.S. Senator from Oklahoma, earned the nickname \"Dr. No\" by stopping thousands of pork-barrel projects using the Senate rules. Projects that he couldn't stop, Coburn included in his oversight reports. [Coburn's Wastebook 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20141027151855/http:/www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?a=Files.Serve&File_id=4dd719bc-8177-4772-93a6-926146d420d7) included 65 examples of outrageous spending worth more than $1.3 billion, including the federal cash squandered on Lexington’s unwanted sidewalks. Key facts: The Lexington government first tried to build sidewalks on Tates Creek Road in 2001, but the idea fell through after a lack of community support. Lexington asked the federal government for help, which gave the city a grant in 2008 to combine with local money and raise $1 million for the project. Backlash was almost immediate. One resident told the [Lexington Herald-Leader](https://web.archive.org/web/20081221013839/https:/www.kentucky.com/181/story/595160.html), “I do not see any need for this and neither do any of my neighbors” because the sidewalks would “desecrate” the natural beauty of the road’s maple and pine trees. Another said that \"I don't see foot traffic or anybody trying to create foot traffic there for any purpose.\" The project was soon delayed, but not because of its unpopularity. The Lexington government’s original cost estimate had ignored the need to buy land from private property owners in order to make the sidewalks wide enough. Lexington appealed to yet another source: the State of Kentucky. Then-Governor Steve Beshear sent over [$556,000 in 2013](https://www.wtvq.com/mayor-announces-additional-funding-for-tates-creek-sidewalks/), which Lexington supplemented to complete the project at a total cost of $1.7 million. The 5-foot-wide sidewalks stretched for 1.6 miles. [Lexington's Commissioner of Planning Derek Paulsen said](https://www.kentucky.com/news/local/counties/fayette-county/article44435073.html) the sidewalks were necessary for safety. When asked why residents couldn’t walk on the grass, he explained that was not possible for wheelchair users. The saga appeared to be finished until this April, when [officials announced plans](https://www.yahoo.com/news/two-busy-lexington-roads-finally-004844194.html) to build sidewalks on two adjacent streets. Summary: If the main beneficiaries of a federal grant need to be convinced that the project is not a waste of money, the cash could likely be put to better use.

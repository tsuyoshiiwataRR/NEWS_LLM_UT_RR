    "text": "The New York Police Department has plans to revoke former President Donald Trump’s concealed carry permit after a Manhattan jury found him guilty of 34 “felony” counts related to payments made to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election. According to CNN, the NYPD is preparing to take away Trump’s Second Amendment right to carry a firearm in public settings, citing New York law. The law states that “Under federal law and state law in New York and Florida, people with felony convictions are barred from possessing a firearm.” Trump’s permit was reportedly suspended last year on April 1 after several indictments were charged against him. The 45th president has had his concealed carry license from the NYPD for more than a decade. His permit allowed Trump to carry three pistols. However, two of the firearms were turned in to the police department on March 31, 2023, while the third gun \"was lawfully moved to Florida.” Trump will have the right “to file a challenge to the move.” However, a senior police official told CNN that NYPD's Legal Bureau is currently undergoing an investigation \"that will likely lead to revocation of his license.” Recommended Trump’s conviction has failed to result in supporters abandoning him but rather made his approval rating and campaign donations skyrocket. A recent Quinnipiac University Georgia poll found that Trump holds a slight lead over President Joe Biden (49 - 44 percent) in a head-to-head matchup in the crucial battleground state. In a six-way hypothetical race that includes other candidates, Trump still leads with 43 percent of the support, while Biden has only 37 percent. The poll asked respondents if Trump’s conviction has any influence on who they will vote for in November. Among Republicans, only 10 percent agree with the verdict while 86 percent disagree.",

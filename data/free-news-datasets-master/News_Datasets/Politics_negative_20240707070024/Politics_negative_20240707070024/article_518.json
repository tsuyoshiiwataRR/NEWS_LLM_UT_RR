    "text": "By Calum Jaspan June 7, 2024 — 3.00am The ABC and its news boss Justin Stevens walked into a News Corp culture wars trap by publicly admonishing Laura Tingle over her “racist country” remarks, says former 7.30 host Quentin Dempster.\nMedia Watch host Paul Barry then “joined the Murdoch pile-on” this week in describing Tingle’s comments as “not a good look”, according to Dempster.\nQuentin Dempster is the former presenter of the ABC’s 7.30 . Credit: Wolter Peeters\n“If you followed his [Barry’s] logic, no ABC political editor would be able to conversationally critique on a panel show any opposition leader’s policies or shameless dog-whistling for fear of creating a perception of partisanship,” Dempster says.\n“You’ll put your career and reputation at risk when the Murdoch attack dogs circle you. You’ll have to abandon editorial judgement. That equals self-censorship.”\nAs a guest on a writers’ festival panel in May, Tingle, 7.30’s chief political correspondent, claimed: “We are a racist country, let’s face it. We always have been, and it’s very depressing.” She also criticised Opposition Leader Peter Dutton and described the opposition’s migration policy in his budget reply as “dog-whistling”.\nLoading Stevens said the comments would not have met the ABC’s editorial standards were they published on official channels, and that Tingle had been counselled over them. The ABC’s standards state: “Impartiality is a fundamental standard … It is central to its public service purpose and to its reputation as a credible and trustworthy broadcaster.”\nAn ABC spokesperson said Stevens’ statement was not an attempt to appease News Corp, nor did it walk into a trap.\n“Outside pressure is never a factor in the ABC acting to uphold its standards. The trust and respect of the community depend on the ABC maintaining its standards of independence and integrity – especially as standards elsewhere continue to decline,” the spokesperson said.\nAdvertisement “The statement’s intent was to be transparent in explaining to the public the ABC’s position. The ABC strongly backs Laura Tingle. Her work for the ABC has been superb and she is a major asset for the organisation.”\nBarry on Monday’s edition of Media Watch labelled Tingle’s comments “not a good look”, and ABC boss David Anderson told a Senate estimates hearing last week he wished they “had not happened”.\nTingle and ABC managing director David Anderson. Credit: James Brickwood, Alex Ellinghausen\nHowever, Anderson disagreed the ABC had cowed to the Murdoch-controlled company in its response.\nIn the Senate hearing, Anderson called media coverage of the comments “a News Corp pile-on”.\nIn a 1400-word explanation published by the ABC on May 29, Tingle wrote she regretted that her comments “were not surrounded by every quote substantiating them”, which had been part of her earlier coverage and analysis of Dutton’s budget response.\nYet rather than defend the “perfectly defensible”, Dempster says Stevens’ statement on Tingle’s comments is a direct attempt to appease News Corp, and by doing so, “the ABC walked into their culture wars trap”.\nDempster says it’s not the first time the ABC has failed to protect its journalists, as shown by the Antoinette Lattouf saga. The Fair Work Commission this week found that the ABC had sacked Lattouf three days into a five-day casual contract.\n“It seems that in future all ABC journalists will have to have a defamation or industrial lawyer at their side whenever they are subject to ABC disciplinary action right up to and including termination of their services,” says Dempster.\nBarry’s Media Watch, which has also criticised the ABC’s handling of the Lattouf saga, is part of the broadcaster’s content division, overseen by chief content officer Chris Oliver-Taylor, rather than Stevens in the news division. The spokesperson said Barry hosts an opinions program, and offers his own opinions.\nLoading “Paul Barry’s analysis on Media Watch ignored formal accountability processes which should be routinely applied by the ABC in the event of any contentious issue involving staff performance. Instead, Paul joined the Murdoch Tingle pile-on,” says Dempster.\n“Paul Barry is entitled to his ‘opinion’, but it did not help.\n“Tingle is both a political analyst of long standing and a political commentator hired to give ABC audiences her specialist insights. Just like Alan Kohler on finance.”\nBarry declined to comment.\nNews Corp’s Australian boss, Michael Miller, told the National Press Club this week that the company was not “obsessed” with the ABC. He said the outlets covered each other in equal measure.\n“I do feel that we’re not obsessed,” Miller told the room of journalists . “We look at Media Watch every Monday, and we accept that that’s part of having a varied media and giving Australians choice.”\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

    "text": "Pennsylvania Republicans’ Disgusting Reaction to January 6 Officers\nHarry Dunn and Aquilino Gonell were booed by state lawmakers.\nTwo police officers who were injured by rioters during the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol were met with an appalling cacophony of boos and hisses from several Republicans during a visit to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Some lawmakers even stormed out of the hall.\nFormer U.S. Capitol Police Officer\nHarry Dunn and former Sergeant Aquilino Gonell had been touring through Pennsylvania as part of the President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign, but according to The Washington Post, several so-called conservative state lawmakers just couldn’t handle their presence Wednesday and threw a complete tantrum.\nDunn, who was pepper-sprayed and injured in hand-to-hand combat during the insurrection, said it was “sad though unsurprising that [Donald] Trump’s allies in the Pennsylvania state House followed his lead in mocking the January 6 attack.”\n“The fact they’re scared to listen to those of us who were there and witnessed the political violence of January 6 first hand speaks volumes,” he said Thursday in a statement.\nGonnell, who was battered during the riot three years ago, wrote in a\npost on X that Pennsylvania House Republicans had “abandoned the truth” and “sided with those who attacked us.”\nPennsylvania Democrats rallied to the former officers’ defense. Representative Arvind Venkat told the Post that he was “shocked and appalled” to see eight to 10 of his Republican colleagues walk out as the two were announced. Representative Mike Schlossberg said that a majority of Republicans did not stand and applaud the two men, who were introduced as “heroes” by House speaker Joanna McClinton.\nMcClinton released a\nstatement about the incident, saying, “The GOP members’ shameful behavior was unbecoming of our institution for any guest, let alone two of the men responsible for defending our democracy during a dark day in our nation’s history.”\nRepresentative Jordan A. Harris, also a Democrat, criticized the Republican response to honoring members of law enforcement. “We talk about backing the blue, but people turned their backs on blue yesterday,” said Harris.\nBut Pennsylvania House Republican Leader Bryan Cutler hit back at the criticism from Democrats, accusing them of “antagonizing members and inviting division and discord for their political and campaign purposes.” He insisted that he had stayed on the floor.\nThe shocking incident is a sign of how divisive the January 6 insurrection is, with many Republicans continuing to\ninsist that rioters had not been in the wrong and that the 2020 election was rigged.",

    "text": "For a variety of reasons, the United States Supreme Court has a constitutional obligation to take up President Trump’s criminal case following his unlawful conviction in New York state court.\nFirst and foremost, federal issues permeate this case. While it was never a case that should have been brought in any court in the first place, this case especially should not have been brought in state court, where jurisdiction patently does not exist.\nThe driving legal issue was purportedly a campaign finance law violation which fell within the gamut of the Federal Election Commission. Bragg flimsily paired that charge with an alleged bookkeeping error to contrive his makeshift theory of criminal liability.\nThis was a theory of liability that was wholly bespoke and lacking any legal precedent whatsoever. In short, it was a theory befitted to one man and one man only: Donald John Trump.\nMany experienced legal scholars, including those on the Left, have pointed to this remarkable fact. Indeed, even the most liberal court observers, largely sympathetic to Bragg and Merchan’s political crusade, were left asking how precisely this legal theory could possibly be replicated for any other defendant. Many rightly pointed out that this was the classic case of “show me the person, I’ll show you the crime.”\nIncredulously, the judge in this case, Juan Manuel Merchan, allowed the Prosecution to categorically ignore the rules of evidence and professional ethics. Also disregarded were fundamental, time-tested principles of Anglo-American jurisprudence: including due process, the presumption of innocence, and perhaps most flagrantly – and jarringly — the necessity for unanimity in guilty verdicts.\nStarting with the gag order, which by its design was a flagrant breach of President Trump’s constitutional rights to speak and criticize the court proceedings as he saw fit.

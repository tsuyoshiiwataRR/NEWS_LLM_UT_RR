    "text": "Panthers signing standout player from UFL\nThe Carolina Panthers are dipping into an unconventional pool of talent.\nIan Rapoport of NFL Network\nreported Thursday that the Panthers are expected to sign wide receiver Daewood Davis, pending a physical. Davis spent time earlier this year in the UFL with the Memphis Showboats.\nThe 25-year-old Davis went undrafted in 2023 following stints at both Oregon and Western Kentucky in college. He signed with the Miami Dolphins as an undrafted free agent but was waived months later after\nsuffering a scary injury during a preseason game against the Jacksonville Jaguars that caused the game to be suspended.\nFortunately for Davis, he was able to bounce back in the UFL this year, logging 446 receiving yards and five touchdowns for the Showboats during their ten regular season games. That was good enough to earn Davis All-UFL team honors.\nThe Panthers\ndid add a new No. 1 receiver this offseason and also drafted wideout Xavier Legette with their first-round pick in this yearâ€™s draft (No. 32 overall). But now Davis will give them more depth as well as some big-play upside at the position.",

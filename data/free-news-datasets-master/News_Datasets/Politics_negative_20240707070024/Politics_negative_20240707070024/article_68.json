    "text": "Arizona Democrats slam former President Donald Trump ahead of his town hall in Phoenix Jun 6, 2024, 11:00 AM (Colton Krolak/KTAR News photo) PHOENIX — Several Arizona Democrats condemned former President Donald Trump during a Thursday press conference held a few hours before a Trump town hall scheduled in Phoenix. Yolanda Bejarano, who serves as chairwoman of the Arizona Democratic Party, opened the Biden-Harris press conference by taking a shot at Trump’s history of canceling his campaign stops in Arizona. “This is the fourth time that Donald Trump said he would visit Arizona and by the third cancellation,” Bejarano said. “I didn’t think it would actually happen.” The most recent time Trump canceled an Arizona visit was in January. Trump was scheduled to [appear as the keynote speaker](https://ktar.com/story/5559175/donald-trumps-appearance-at-arizona-gop-event-in-phoenix-canceled/) for the AZGOP Freedom Fest at Dream City Church. However, AZGOP said the event was canceled due to court obligations for his hush money trial in New York. Said trial eventually made history when the jury found Trump [guilty on 34 felony counts](https://ktar.com/story/5575380/jury-finds-donald-trump-guilty-on-all-counts-in-hush-money-trial/). Jurors believed Trump falsified business records in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election. Prosecutors said Trump made hush money payments to Stormy Daniels, a porn actor who said she slept with the former president in 2006. Trump’s Thursday town hall is taking place exactly a week after the verdict. It’s his first official campaign event after his felony conviction. How Arizona Democrats condemned former President Donald Trump Bejarano accused Trump of cozying up with political extremists. “Donald Trump’s extremism has been on full display following his felony conviction. As someone who was raised in Arizona, I know this is contrary to the values we grew up with,” she added. She said the American democracy depends on Arizona voters casting ballots for President Joe Biden instead of Trump. “Voters across Arizona will face a stark reminder of why they rejected Trump in the first place when he brings his campaign of revenge and retribution to the state,” Bejarano said. After her, the next speaker was Rep. Sarah Liguori, who focused on the threats Republicans such as Trump pose to reproductive freedoms. “In Arizona, we are facing an unacceptable reality in abortion ban with few exceptions because of Donald Trump,” Liguori said. She noted that Trump appointed three Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. “He said it was his honor that he was able to kill Roe v. Wade,” Liguori said. “He said that women that have an abortion should be punished.” Abortion could be a weak spot in Trump’s strategy to court Arizonans The topic of abortion rights is a sore spot for Republicans looking to court voters, according to Valley political consultant Chuck Coughlin. He said he expects Trump to [avoid the topic of abortion](https://ktar.com/story/5576080/heres-what-you-should-know-former-president-donald-trumps-town-hall-event-phoenix-church/) during an interview with KTAR News 92.3 FM on Wednesday. Liguori stressed the issue, reminding voters to think about their abortion rights when considering their options at the ballot booth. “The [1864 ban](https://ktar.com/story/5569592/most-abortions-banned-in-arizona-after-state-supreme-court-upholds-1864-law/) that threatened Arizona women had no exceptions for rape or incest and it is only a threat because of Trump,” she said. “If Donald Trump returns to the White House, he and his allies will threaten to ban abortion nationwide in all 50 states — including here in Arizona.” We want to hear from you.

    "text": "Man to appear in court in connection with alleged stalking and making ‘murderous threats’ to female politician A man has been charged in connection with the alleged stalking and making “murderous threats” to a prominent female politician. The suspect, a man in his 20s, from the west of Ireland, is a member of a main political party. He is currently in custody in a Galway garda station and will appear in court in Galway tomorrow. The suspect, described as “highly intelligent and academically qualified” was arrested this morning on foot of a complaint by a prominent female politician. It is understood the complaint involves “murderous threats” received via email and an instance where the suspect turned up in person. A Garda spokesman said “a man was arrested today for an alleged offence contrary to Section 10(1) of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 as amended by Section 23 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2023, Stalking. “The man is currently detained under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.” \"Gardaí have charged the man (20s) arrested earlier today in connection with a complaint made by a female public representative in the west of the country. “He remains in custody and is due to appear before Galway District Court tomorrow morning Friday, 7th of June 2024,” a spokesperson said. An Garda Síochána said that as this is an ongoing criminal investigation, it has no further comment at this time.

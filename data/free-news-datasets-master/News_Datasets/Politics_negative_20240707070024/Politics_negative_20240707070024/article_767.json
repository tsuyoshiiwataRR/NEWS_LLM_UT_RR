    "text": "Former President Donald Trump slammed Senate Majority Leader [Charles Schumer](https://www.dailywire.com/topic/charles-schumer) (D-NY) during an interview this week for abandoning his support for Israel, saying that the Democrat had “become like a Palestinian.” Trump made the remarks during a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity on Wednesday night while talking about Israel’s war against Hamas. “They have to finish the job. Israel has to finish that job,” Trump said. “They have to finish it quickly, strongly, and they have to get back to life again because it’s taking too long. Gotta win, gotta win.” “The attack on October 7th, and it’s getting more and more demeaned, they’re demeaning it. I have people telling me they don’t think the attack ever happened,” Trump said in reference to modern day anti-Semitic Holocaust deniers. “And take a look, you watch the news reports — you watch these people on television and just like you have Holocaust deniers also, they say the Holocaust never happened. It’s the exact same people. They’re saying it never happened.” Trump noted that Israel used to have much more support in the U.S. among lawmakers, but lawmakers like the Squad — Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), and others — have eroded that support. “I’m good,” Trump said about his support for Israel. “But they don’t have the backing. Even Schumer, he’s become like a Palestinian. Chuck Schumer, Jewish, always strong for Israel. He’s become like a Palestinian.” [CLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP](https://onelink.to/dwapp) WATCH: Trump: Democrat Chuck Schumer has become so radical against Israel that “he’s become like a Palestinian” [pic.twitter.com/1YKbPqGlOT] — Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) [June 6, 2024]",

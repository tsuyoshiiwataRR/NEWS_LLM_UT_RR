    "text": "NDA allies call for review of Agnipath, JD(U) distances itself NEW DELHI: NDA partners JD(U), led by Nitish Kumar, and Chirag Paswan’s LJP on Thursday articulated concern over the Agnipath scheme which was used by the opposition to attack govt over inadequate generation of jobs, though the former backpedalled on its comments saying they were twisted out of context. JD(U) general secretary K C Tyagi was the first off the blocks, telling TV news channels that his party, which with 12 MPs may have an outsized role in the BJP-led coalition govt, will insist on a review of the Agnipath scheme under which 75% of recruits, the Agniveers, will be let go of after four years while the rest get to serve for another 15 years. LJP (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan, in response to a question, told NDTV that govt must revisit the Agnipath scheme to ascertain whether it had delivered the desired results. “If somebody has raised it, the NDA gives us that platform to sit and discuss. Yesterday (Wednesday), in the (NDA) meeting, my PM said on record that he is open to discussion. This platform is open and he is easily available for discussion of concerns and suggestions. If somebody feels or any party feels, I definitely believe that we must revisit that (Agnipath),” he said. Paswan said the govt must carry out an assessment of how much could be delivered through this scheme as it directly concerned youngsters. “If it is beneficial and working for them as per the intention of the scheme and it is getting penetrated well, then we must continue. If not, then we should come up with suggestions of what can be done. But these things can be kept on hold for a while or till govt formation. So, immediately after that, we can sit and discuss all these things,” he said. The comments were interpreted as muscle-flexing by allies whose strength has acquired disproportionate dimension because of BJP lacking its own majority, before Tyagi dialled back by saying that his comments to TV channels were edited out of context. “What is said was in exact sync with the line articulated on several occasions by Rajnath Singh that the scheme is going to be reviewed periodically to look for shortcomings and their removal,” Tyagi said, adding that there were reports of unhappiness among a section of voters in western UP and Rajasthan. “My assertion that JD(U) is part of NDA and has extended unconditional support to the Modi govt was also left out,” he further said. On JD(U)’s support to a Modi-led govt, Tyagi said, “There is no pre-condition, there is unconditional support. But it is in our mind and heart that Bihar should be given special status. After bifurcation, the situation Bihar has faced, it cannot be corrected without granting special status.” On caste census, which was carried out by the Nitish Kumar govt in Bihar with the support of BJP, RJD and all other political parties, Tyagi said, “No party in the country has opposed caste census. Bihar has shown the way, the prime minister also did not oppose... It is the demand of the time, and we will pursue it.” Paswan also backed a caste-wise headcount. “Me and my party do support caste census. There’s a reason behind this because even after seven decades of Independence, there are still schemes and policies which are drafted for the upliftment of a particular caste or section of society. Many times, courts have also asked for the population count of a particular caste. So, I do believe that govt should have these details with it, what is the figure of a particular caste. I’m not in favour of making it public, because that increases the divide,” he said. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had made caste census one of his main campaign themes. Tyagi said JD(U) was not opposed to Uniform Civil Code but all stakeholders should be consulted. “On UCC, the chief minister (Nitish Kumar) had written to the Law Commission. We are not against UCC. But there should be consultation with all stakeholders, chief ministers, political parties and different sects, and a resolution should be found,” he said. For more news like this visit TOI.

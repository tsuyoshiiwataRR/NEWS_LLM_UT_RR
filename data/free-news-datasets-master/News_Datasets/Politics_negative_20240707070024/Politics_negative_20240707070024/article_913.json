    "text": "Searchers found a 68-year-old woman dead in Boulder Creek Monday after she was reported missing by a family member, the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release.\nThe family member was concerned for the woman’s well-being due to health issues, and she was considered to be an at-risk adult, according to the release. Searchers looked for her in the Boulder Canyon and Fourmile Canyon areas, near where her car was found.\nThe Sheriff’s Office also sent a message to residents who had signed up for alerts in that area that asked people to be on the lookout for the missing woman, according to the release.\nSearchers found a deceased woman in Boulder Creek later that day that matched her description, but due to the injuries sustained while she was in the creek, the woman’s identification was pending for several days. The Daily Camera is not naming the deceased woman at this time.\nThe death does not appear to be suspicious, according to the release. The Boulder County Coroner’s office is expected to release a final determination on the cause and manner of the death.\nThe agencies involved in the search included the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office, the Boulder County Coroner’s Office, Boulder County Parks and Open Space, the Boulder Emergency Squad, Boulder Fire-Rescue, Boulder Rural Fire Protection District, the FBI, the Four Mile Fire Protection District, Front Range Rescue Dogs and the Rocky Mountain Rescue Group.\nThe Boulder County Sheriff’s Office number for the case is 24-02698.\n ",

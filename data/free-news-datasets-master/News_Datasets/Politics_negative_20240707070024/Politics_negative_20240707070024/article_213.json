    "text": "HYDERABAD: A day after the Lok Sabha poll results, BRS was in the crosshairs of a friend, AIMIM, and a foe, Congress, both of whom accused it of intentionally transferring its vote to BJP in the Lok Sabha elections. BRS, however, has called the allegations ridiculous, saying people chose the two national parties because of the impact of the assembly polls in Nov. BJP for the first time in the region walked away with eight Lok Sabha seats, doubling its tally from 2019. On Wednesday, chief minister A Revanth Reddy alleged, “KCR and his family members sacrificed BRS and mortgaged the self-respect of party leaders to ensure BJP’s win. I don’t know why he (KCR) did it. You should ask KCR, KTR or Harish Rao,” he said while replying to media queries if it was to get bail for Kavitha in liquor scam case. Of the 39 assembly seats it won in 2023, BRS got majority only in three of those seats in the Lok Sabha elections. Even in its stronghold, Siddipet, margins came down to only 2,500 votes. BRS lost deposits in seven of the eight seats won by BJP except in Medak where the BC candidate of the Congress was defeated because former minister T Harish Rao worked towards transfer of the BRS votes to the saffron party, Revanth claimed. “KCR also cheated former IAS officer Venkatram Reddy (who was BRS candidate) in Medak by helping the BJP to win,” Revanth alleged. AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi had said on Tuesday that it was open for all to see how BRS supported BJP in many constituencies. “It is a matter of sadness that we saw how BRS leaders openly supported the BJP,” he said. “I don’t know why they did it. It is a wrong political strategy. I have no idea the consequences BRS will face because of this.” AIMIM has been an ally of BRS and had supported the party in the Nov 2023 assembly elections. But in the May 13 Lok Sabha polls, Owaisi, in an indicative appeal, had called upon Muslims to support Congress in Secunderabad, Chevella and Nizamabad, and support winnable candidates from other parties elsewhere in Telangana to defeat BJP. Responding to Owaisi’s remarks, BRS social media convenor Krishank said on X: “Asad saab, with due respect every BRS warrior posted on the theatrics of Hyderabad BJP candidate. KCR garu fielded his most confidante against BJP state president (in Secunderabad). You have all the liberty to incline towards those in the govt but your allegation of BRS working for BJP is a blatant LIE (sic).” For more news like this visit TOI.

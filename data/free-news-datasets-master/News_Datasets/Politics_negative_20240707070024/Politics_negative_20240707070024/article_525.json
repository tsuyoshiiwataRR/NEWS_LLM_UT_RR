    "text": "Gabourey Sidibe and Brandon Frankel are parents! The couple, who posed on the cover of [our Style Issue in 2022](https://www.brides.com/style-issue-5223323), announced that they were expecting twins in February. A few short months later, their little ones—a boy and a girl—officially arrived earthside. The couple shared the happy news via exclusive photos on [The Shade Room](https://theshaderoom.com/gabby-sidibe-first-look-newborn-twins-husband-brandon-frankel-exclusive-photos/), revealing that they’ve actually been a family of four for a few months now; the twins were born in early April 2024, per Shutterstock. As for their names? Meet Cooper and Maya. “Brandon always wanted to name a son Cooper, so we can call him ‘Coop,’ and Maya was named shortly before our baby moon to the Mayan Riviera in Mexico,” the Oscar-nominated actress told the outlet, alongside photos of the twins in matching pink and blue onesies. “Both twins have traditional West African middle names after members of my family.” According to Sidibe, the twins already have their own little personalities, though they don’t pay each other much attention. Both of the babies are “extremely strong and hilarious,” but “have yet to really interact with each other,” Sidibe explained. The little ones do, however, have a certain degree of twin telepathy, added the new mom: “Cooper will sometimes speak for Maya and alert us that she’s about to spit up. Maya loves her name being sung to her and is the queen of comedic timing, and Cooper loves his sleep and has the funniest facial expressions.” As for their favorite activity? “They both love cuddling with Mom and Dad,” Sidibe added. The actress also opened up about the twins’ birth story, which was unexpected. “We originally were going in for a routine appointment, only to be told the twins would be coming later that day and not when originally planned,” Sidibe shared. Unsurprisingly, she and Frankel are approaching this first phase of parenthood (which involves lots of “active sleep,” she says) as a team—which tracks for the [ultra-supportive couple](https://www.brides.com/signs-you-and-your-partner-are-a-power-couple-5119287), who regularly gush about their strong bond on social media (they haven't posted anything about their twins on their own accounts yet, but now that the word is out, it's only a matter of time before they share more). And though they’re in the swing of the newborn era, they can’t wait for what’s to come. “We’re excited for outfits and getting them dressed up, for sing-alongs, trips and to explore, and raising them to be good people,” Sidibe shared. What’s also unsurprising is that Sidibe and Frankel’s twins arrived a few months ago; the couple is known for keeping their life’s biggest milestones private for a while. [Sidibe officially announced that she and Frankel had wed](https://www.brides.com/gabourey-sidibe-brandon-frankel-married-6835705) in 2022 on an episode of Live With Kelly and Ryan—over a year after they actually [tied the knot](https://www.brides.com/celebrity-weddings-2024-8430920). Three years later, they confirmed that they were pregnant on Instagram. “Twin Delivery coming soon!” Sidibe wrote in her post, hinting to the babies’ due date. “Twinty Twinty Four!”",

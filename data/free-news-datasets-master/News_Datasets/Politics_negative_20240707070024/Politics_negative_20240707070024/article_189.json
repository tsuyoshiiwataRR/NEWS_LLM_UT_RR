    "text": "From Molly Kilete, Abuja The Force Commander of the Multi-National Joint Task Force (MNJTF), Major General Ibrahim Sallau Ali, has embarked on an operational visit to the troops of Operation Lake Sanity 2 in Monguno and Wulgo, to assess the progress of the ongoing operation and to boost the morale of the troops. Chief Military Public Information officer Lieutenant Colonel Abubakar Abdulahi, who made this known, said while In Monguno, General Ali while addressing the commanders from both Nigeria and Chad, urged them to intensify their efforts and demonstrate determination in achieving the objectives of Operation Lake Sanity 2. He highlighted the importance of understanding the enemy’s tactics, noting that the terrorists, having lost the capability for direct engagement, now heavily rely on improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and propaganda to sustain their relevance. During his visit to Wulgo, located on the Nigeria-Cameroon border, General Ali commended the bravery and resilience of the troops. He paid tribute to the soldiers who had fallen in the line of duty and encouraged the troops to remain focused on their mission while avoiding any distractions. He emphasized the need for commanders to exercise their initiative and make decisions that reflect the dynamic operational environment. Accompanying General Ali were the Deputy Force Commander, Air Vice Marshal Mahamat Yaya Mahamat, and other senior military staff officers. The visit underscored committed leadership actively engaged in the well-being and operational success of the troops on the ground.",

    "text": "The United States of America (US) has imposed sanctions on top Georgian government officials and leaders of the ruling Georgian Dream party over a controversial law that has sparked weeks of protests in the Caucasian country and which critics say will limit media freedom and threaten the country's chances of join the European Union. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller did not identify, due to visa confidentiality laws, who had been sanctioned, but said there were \"several dozen\" people who had been banned from travel. The move came three days after Georgian Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili signed the law into law after lawmakers overrode President Saloma Zourabishvili's veto. The law requires media, non-governmental organizations and other non-profit groups to register as \"pursuing the interests of a foreign power\" if they receive more than 20 percent of their funds from abroad. The government claims the law is necessary to stop foreign actors trying to destabilize the country, but many journalists and activists say its real aim is to stigmatize them and limit debate ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for October. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken warned that the US is reviewing all its aid to Georgia, which has amounted to $390 million over the past few years. Opponents of the law have dubbed it the \"Russian law\" because it resembles measures in place in Russia to crack down on independent media, non-profit organizations and activists. Some claim that this measure may have been initiated by Moscow to thwart Georgia's chances for further integration with the West. Bonus video:",

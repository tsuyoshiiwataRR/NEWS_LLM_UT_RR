    "text": "Texas Republican Congressman Chip Roy joins Fox Across America With Jimmy Failla to give his take on the White House unveiling executive actions meant to stop illegal immigrants at the U.S. southern border claiming asylum if crossings reach a certain level. “I mean, the fact of the matter is, everybody with a brain, whoever that may be, there’s not many in Washington, but anybody with a brain that’s watching this stop is going, wait a minute. You mean to tell me that the president, the United States comes out and says, hey, you guys should have passed that really important Senate bill that we said would solve all the stuff. Well, but since you didn’t, I’m going to do an executive order that I could have done three and a half years ago to do half the number that we said was going to be the important number back in January with our fake Senate bill. And I’m going to do this order, which still has no chance of changing anything at all, because we’re still paroling and releasing everybody into the United States, even if I cap it at 2500, which I’m kind of telling you, I’m not. Which, by the way, is still way more than Jeh Johnson, Obama’s secretary of Homeland Security said was a crisis. It’s all a sham. It’s all a joke. Everybody knows they have no interest in securing the border. They want to flood the American people with people from all over the world. They’re endangering us in the process. Laken Riley’s dead because of it. Texans are dead because of it. And, you know, this is a front and center election issue. And I just hope Republicans keep our foot down on the gas and try to keep forcing it.” Jimmy and Rep. Roy also talk about how President Biden does not have a good record to run on in the upcoming election. Listen to the podcast to hear what else they discussed!",

The proclamation mentioned the Natural Family Foundation (NFF), an anti-LGBTQ+ group that invented Natural Family Month and considers same-sex families as a corrupt, immoral, and lawless threat that will ensure societys extinction. The proclamation read on May 7 by House Speaker Sherman Packard (R) and sponsored by state Rep. Claudine Burnham (R) declared, Strong families make for stronger communities, churches, businesses and added that organizations like the Natural Family Foundation work to encourage parental involvement, recognize the important role of each parents, restore family values, and promote honest and open communication between families. However, the proclamation wasnt transparent about NFFs anti-LGBTQ+ views. Burnham said the proclamation recognizes that all families are important and called Natural Family Month as part of a growing nationwide movement headed by the Natural Family Foundation. She didnt mention that NFF opposes same-sex marriage and same-sex parents and that the groups founder has led protests against a local Christian evangelical megachurch for not doing more to oppose homosexuality. NFFs website states, When we speak of family we consider that to be without question one biological born man and woman in a lifelong, committed, monogamous relationship with their biological and/or adopted children. Anything outside of these NATURAL parameters by design causes undue stress on the marriage, children and society. It also states that within the family there must be a clear male leader and that leader must come from the familys lineage. https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2024/05/gop-legislators-parrot-anti-gay-group-in-natural-family-month-proclamation/ [InfoView thread info, including edit history](/?com=thread&info=1&address=100219013918) [TrashPut this thread in your Trash Can (My DU » Trash Can)](/?com=login) [BookmarkAdd this thread to your Bookmarks (My DU » Bookmarks)](/?com=login)3 replies, 125 views [ShareGet links to this post and/or share on social media] [AlertAlert this post for a rule violation](/?com=login) [PowersThere are no powers you can use on this post] [EditCannot edit other people's posts] [ReplyReply to this post](/?com=post&post&forum=1002&pid=19013918) [EditCannot edit other people's posts] [Rec (1)] [ReplyReply to this post](/?com=post&forum=1002&pid=19013918) [NoneDon't highlight anything](#!)

    "text": "Charleston Co. sheriff candidate demoted for political actions on the job CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC) - A Republican candidate for the Charleston County Sheriff’s Office has been demoted after an internal investigation determined his actions on the job were at least partly politically motivated. Folly Beach Department of Public Safety Deputy Chief Rocky Burke has been demoted to Livability Detective for violating departmental communication policies, circumventing established hierarchy and causing friction with neighboring law enforcement agencies. According to internal documents obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request, Burke reached out to Representative Nancy Mace’s office in Washington, DC, to lodge a complaint against the Charleston County Sheriff’s Office. That complaint found its way to the FBI, which then reached out to Sheriff Kristin Graziano. On April 3, Graziano relayed the concern from the FBI to Folly Beach Chief Andrew Gilreath, who immediately launched an investigation into Burke’s actions. Burke was placed on administrative leave on April 4. The investigation uncovered an effort by Burke to reach out to a family member of Mace’s to get in touch with the representative. Burke is accused of sharing sensitive information about the investigation into a Senior Skip Day event planned for April 11 in violation of departmental policy. Back in early March, the Department of Public Safety became aware of a threatening social media post about the event and tracked it back to an individual living in North Carolina. Documents claim local law enforcement would not investigate the matter until there was a credible threat, which, according to Gilreath’s investigation, did not sit well with Burke. Burke allegedly told a coworker he was going to reach out to the legislature since local partners and the FBI were not taking the matter seriously. Gilreath concludes the investigation by saying both he and Graziano believe Burke’s actions were politically motivated. In a separate incident on March 28, Burke was suspended for a day after getting into a heated argument with Gilreath over an unknown matter, according to referral documents. His suspension was set for April 2 in this case. He was placed on leave two days later for reaching out to Mace’s office. Burke is currently taking time off to focus on his campaign for Graziano’s seat. His demotion is set to take effect when he returns. Copyright 2024 WCSC. All rights reserved.",

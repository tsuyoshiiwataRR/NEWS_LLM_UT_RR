    "text": "Former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon will report to prison on July 1 to serve a four-month sentence for contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas from the January 6 select committee.\nNEW from‚Äî Raheem. (@RaheemKassam)\n[@thenatpulse]: BREAKING: Steve Bannon Must Report to Jail by July 1, Says Judge.\nFormer Trump advisor Stephen K. Bannon, ......\nREAD ON:\n [June 6, 2024]\nNBC News\nreports:\nA federal judge on Thursday ordered former Trump adviser Steve Bannon to report to prison on July 1 to begin a four-month prison sentence for defying subpoenas from the Jan. 6 Committee after a higher court rejected his appeal.\nBannon was found guilty on two counts of contempt of Congress in July 2022 for defying the committee‚Äôs subpoenas, but his sentence had been put on hold while he appealed the case. U.S. District Judge Carl said Thursday he did not believe that the ‚Äúoriginal basis‚Äù for his stay of the imposition of Bannon's sentence existed any longer after an appeals court upheld Bannon's conviction. Bannon could still appeal Nichol‚Äôs ruling that he must report to prison.\n‚Äú‚ÄòThe defendant chose allegiance to Donald Trump over compliance with the law [sic],‚Äô\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Molly Gaston‚Ä¶told jurors.‚Äù That‚Äôs not going to sound so bad soon. The Jan. 6 Committee was an unlawful sham. Sentence ends before Election Day.‚Äî Joel Pollak (@joelpollak)\n [June 6, 2024]\nAre we reading this correctly? Two counts of contempt of Congress? Do you know who else is currently in contempt of Congress?\nHunter Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland.\nThis should concern more people.‚Äî Drew Holden (@DrewHolden360)\n[pic.twitter.com/sgoIeDgHYT] [June 6, 2024]\nSteve Bannon was just ordered to prison for ignoring a Congressional subpeona.‚Äî Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok)\nHunter Biden ignored a subpeona for months and wasn‚Äôt sentenced to prison.\n[pic.twitter.com/D18aXuTKT8] [June 6, 2024]\nA judge just sent Steve Bannon to prison for ignoring a congressional subpoena.‚Äî End Wokeness (@EndWokeness)\nHunter did the same thing. No prison.\nFauci lied under oath. No prison.\n[pic.twitter.com/8i0118diXD] [June 6, 2024]\nAnd all we'll hear from the mainstream media is how Donald Trump, if re-elected, will abuse his power to prosecute and jail his political opponents.\nSteve Bannon was ordered to report to prison on July 1. This is another egregious example of the third-world weaponization of our justice system that Joe Biden has used to silence his opponents since day one. Biden retaliates against American citizens he disagrees with by turning‚Ä¶‚Äî Attorney General Ken Paxton (@KenPaxtonTX)\n [June 6, 2024]\nBiden retaliates against American citizens he disagrees with by turning them into political prisoners. The country is becoming unrecognizable. This cannot continue.\nIt's some coincidence that a World War II veteran told a reporter today on the anniversary of D-Day that he doesn't recognize the country anymore.\nWill Merrick Garland go to prison for contempt?‚Äî Kasia Z. Zasada üá∫üá∏üáµüá± (@ZuzaZasada)\nWe all know the answer.\n[June 6, 2024]\nGarland was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over the Robert Hur recordings.\nThis is disgraceful. It‚Äôs time for Republicans to unite and fight back against this lawfare.‚Äî J.D. Vance (@JDVance1)\n [June 6, 2024]\nBannon gets prison time, while Hunter and Fauci walk free. Justice should be blind, not selective. This just shows how the system is rigged against those who challenge the establishment.‚Äî MAG2A us (@armsparts2)\n[June 6, 2024]\nEric Holder (Obama official) did the same thing‚Äî Joshua Robinson (@JRobFreedom)\n[June 6, 2024]\nHow long did Eric Holder spend in prison?\n‚ÄúNo one is above the law‚Äù‚Äî Jack (@jackunheard)\n[June 6, 2024]\nHunter Biden made a spectacle of holding a press conference on the steps of the Capitol where he was supposed to be testifying. It couldn't be any more in-your-face if they tried.\nYou see the double standards.‚Äî floridanow1 (@floridanow1)\n90% of Congress ignores the double standards.\nMedia applauds and covers for the double standard.\n[June 6, 2024]\nOk so everybody who did the same thing needs to immediately go to prison. Surely there is a list somewhere, lol‚Äî Mild Mannered Maniac (@80sGeek)\n[June 6, 2024]\nTime to DISMANTLE the DOJ.‚Äî Nick Sortor (@nicksortor)\nIt‚Äôs corrupt to the core and completely unfixable.\n[June 6, 2024]\nRemember this when the left says \"There isn't a two tiered system of justice, Hunter is on trial!\" ü§°‚Äî AMAC (@AMACforAmerica)\n[June 6, 2024]\nAnd will get a slap on the wrist, told to stay off crack, and walk free.\nDefund the DOJ. It only serves to persecute innocent conservatives.‚Äî Paul A. Szypula üá∫üá∏ (@Bubblebathgirl)\nThe DOJ does not represent the interests of all American people.\n[June 6, 2024]\nThey're not even hiding the bias anymore. I think they're doing it on purpose because their base loves it. But it's not going to win them anymore voters!‚Äî Lorrie Ann üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá∏ (@LorrieAnn25)\n[June 6, 2024]\nIndependents see the double standard.\nThis is how a banana republic looks, kids‚Äî Iron Range Rocks and Cows (@angry_ande)\n[June 6, 2024]\nI'm starting to see a pattern here...‚Äî Nick Charles (@ThinMan69)\n[June 6, 2024]\nwhat a coincidence that they would silence Bannon just before the election.‚Äî Swabby McSweetie (@SwabbyMcSweetie)\n[June 6, 2024]\nFor what it's worth, Bannon said outside the courthouse that this won't shut him up.\nSteve Bannon ordered to surrender to prison by July 1st: \"All of this is about one thing, shutting down the MAGA movement, grassroots conservatives and Pres Trump. Not only are we winning, we are going to prevail. There‚Äôs not a prison or jail built that can shut me up.\"‚Äî Real Mac Report (@RealMacReport)\n[pic.twitter.com/KhauNS9gV3] [June 6, 2024]\nThey will jail every Trump surrogate before the election if they get their way.‚Äî SazzygirlinCali (@RjbRocklin)\n[June 6, 2024]\nThe consensus in the replies seems to be that Eric Holder, Merrick Garland, and Hunter Biden were all held in contempt of Congress and nothing happened to them. This way, they can shut down Bannon's popular podcast for four months during election season.\nHere's a longish post to close things out:\nRemember, this is a misdemeanor.‚Äî Jeff Clark (@JeffClarkUS)\nFor the Biden Administration, if this stands, it‚Äôs mission accomplished:\nTake Bannon out for close to the full span of the run up to the 2024 presidential election. And even if Trump grants him a pardon later, they can‚Äôt give him a time machine‚Ä¶\n [June 6, 2024]\n‚Ä¶ they can‚Äôt give him a time machine to undo time already spent under lock and key.\nThink about where that leaves the country.\nThe Supreme Court needs to intervene in this attempt to shut down a key voice before the election. And they can do a lot simply by granting a stay pending resolution of a cert petition and then Bannon could stay free until late September at least.\nI‚Äôm sure Bannon‚Äôs lawyers have their cert petition up on the drafting table now. (The DC Circuit likely will deny a stay.)\nAnd the Supreme Court should go farther and grant cert in their pre-October Term 2024 orders list at the end of the Summer. The DC Circuit‚Äôs Licavoli decision should be reversed and the Supreme Court should use this occasion to reinforce that lower courts cannot empty the word ‚Äúwillfully‚Äù of all meaning.\n***",

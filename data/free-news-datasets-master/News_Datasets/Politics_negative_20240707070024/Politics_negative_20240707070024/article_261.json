    "text": "By Lauren Taylor ,\n27 minutes ago\nUnder federal law, convicted felons are not legally allowed to possess a firearm. Former President Donald Trump has held a concealed carry license for more than a decade, but a Manhattan jury convicted the former president of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records on May 30. Now, the status of his concealed carry license is up in the air.\nTrump’s concealed carry permit in the state of New York was suspended in April 2023 after he was indicted.\nThe former president also owns three pistols, according to a report by The New York Times. Two guns were handed over to the New York Police Department in March 2023, CNN reports , when he was charged with those 34 counts.\nTrump’s third gun was previously transferred to Florida, where Trump spends time at his Mar-a-Lago estate. It is unclear if that firearm is still in Florida.\nAccording to the New York Times and CNN, senior leaders at the NYPD are in talks, preparing to revoke Trump’s concealed carry permit.\nRight now, the NYPD Legal Bureau will have to complete an investigation. When it is finished, Trump will be able to challenge the revocation.\nAs a former president, Trump will still have protection from the Secret Service.\nThe post Trump’s conviction raises questions about his conceal carry permit appeared first on Straight Arrow News .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

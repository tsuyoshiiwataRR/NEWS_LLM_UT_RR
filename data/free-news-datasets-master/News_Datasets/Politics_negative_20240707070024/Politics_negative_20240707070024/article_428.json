    "text": "Without naming any party, NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) state president Jayant Patil stated that several leaders were in touch with them. Several media reports have indicated that over a dozen MLAs from Ajit Pawar&#039;s camp are in touch with the Sharad Pawar faction. It is to be noted that this development is coming months ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly polls after Ajit Pawar&#039;s NCP managed to secure just one Lok Sabha seat. Around 10-15 MLAs from Ajit Pawar&#039;s faction in Maharashtra were reportedly in touch with Sharad Pawar camp, India Today reported citing sources on Thursday. &quot;We will think of these proposals at our meeting on June 9. On June 10, we have our foundation day,&quot; Jayant Patil told reporters earlier in the day. Addressing a press conference, Patil said, &quot;I cannot give an answer today but I am telling you that things are different. The right decision is taken at the right time&quot;. &quot;Exit polls have no point it is wrong data. Exit polls only to manipulate the stock market,&quot; Patil has said. Amid the political turmoil in Maharashtra, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde might soon consider a Cabinet expansion to appease disgruntled leaders. Ajit Pawar Holds Meeting To Assess &#039;Poor&#039; Lok Sabha Performance Of Party Earlier in the day, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar held a meeting with senior leaders of his party to discuss the &quot;poor&quot; performance in the Lok Sabha polls. Ajit Pawar&#039;s NCP contested four Lok Sabha seats and managed to win only one, Raigad. What came as a major jolt to the party, Ajit Pawar&#039;s wife Sunetrs Pawar lost to Sharad Pawar&#039;s daughter Supriya Sule from the Baramati Lok Sabha seat by more than 1.5 lakh votes. The NCP Split Last year, Ajit Pawar rebelled against his uncle Sharad Pawar, leading to a split in the NCP. Ajit Pawar then joined the ruling BJP-Shiv Sena alliance in the state along with some other MLAs. The Maharashtra Lok Sabha results were disappointing for the ruling Mahayuti alliance, which secured just 17 seats. In contrast, the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), despite splits in two parties, managed to win 30 seats. The Congress won 13 seats, the Shiv Sena (UBT) secured nine, and the NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) obtained eight seats. On Wednesday, Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis offered to resign, taking responsibility for the party&#039;s performance in the Lok Sabha elections. However, there were no official information available on any decision on the same. Fadnavis was likely to continue in his position.",

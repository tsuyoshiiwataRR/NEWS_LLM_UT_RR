    "text": "On Wednesday, the Georgia Court of Appeals made a decisive move in the racketeering case involving former President Donald Trump. With an official order, the court has halted all proceedings.\nIt's because of the pending ruling on the defendants' motion to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the case. The appeals court directed Judge Scott McAfee hit the breaks on the case until this matter is resolved.\nThis decision comes in the wake of concerns surrounding Willis' impartiality. In March, McAfee ruled that despite \"a significant appearance of impropriety” due to her romantic involvement with special prosecutor Nathan Wade — which included her giving him preferential treatment including inflated pay, joint vacations, and potential misuse of state funds — Willis could continue her case against Donald Trump and 18 others. The ruling came with the condition that she fire Wade. She didn’t have to; he resigned.\nHowever, McAfee's decision to grant immediate review enabled Trump and eight co-defendants to petition the Georgia Court of Appeals for consideration before trial. On Monday, the Georgia appeals court scheduled oral arguments for Oct. 4 for the disqualification of Willis. Between the scheduling of the disqualification hearing and the pausing of the trial, there’s no way this case will not go to trial before the 2024 presidential election as Democrats had hoped.",

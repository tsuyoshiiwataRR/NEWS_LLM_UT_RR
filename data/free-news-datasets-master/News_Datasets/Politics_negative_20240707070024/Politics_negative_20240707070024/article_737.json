(Getty) Their Majesties were seen wiping away tears, with Camilla particularly overwhelmed, as war hero Eric Bateman shared his memories of the D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, a pivotal WWII moment that ultimately helped lead to the victory of the Allied Forces.\n\"Today we come together to honour those nearly 160,000 British, Commonwealth and Allied troops who, on 5th June 1944, assembled here and along these shores to embark on the mission which would strike that blow for freedom and be recorded as the greatest amphibious operation in history,\" King Charles said.\nRoyals attend D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations View Gallery \"Those who gathered here in Portsmouth would never forget the sight. It was by far the largest military fleet the world has ever known. Yet all knew that both victory and failure were possible, and none could know their fate.\"\nPrince William also gave a speech, telling the crowd he was \"deeply honoured\" to take part in the commemorations and help \"recognise the bravery\" of those \"that came from across our nation and from all walks of life to join in the fight against tyranny\".\nA series of memorial events are taking place this week. (Bloomberg via Getty Images) William later travelled to France where he joined Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister, US First Lady Jill Biden, US President Joe Biden and Brigitte Macron for a ceremony at Omaha beach in Normandy.\n ",

    "text": "Tensions ran high at the bustling Marian Market in Calabar and its surrounding areas after reports emerged of the alleged killing of a young Hausa boy, reportedly by a group of rate-collecting agents.\nThe tragic incident occurred on a Wednesday afternoon at the market when the agents confronted the boy.\nUpon returning from collecting rusted irons in their wheelbarrow, the agents demanded a payment of N100 from the boy and his companions.\nHowever, eyewitness accounts from market women revealed that the boys, who were not engaged in selling goods but passing through the market, refused to pay the fee.\nThe agents persisted in demanding the money and a confrontation ensued when the boys stood their ground, leading to a violent altercation.\nDescribing the events, a trader named Mrs. Angelina Effiong, who specializes in selling second-hand clothes, mentioned, “A scuffle broke out between the agents and the young Hausa boys. Tragically, one of the agents struck the Hausa boy forcefully, resulting in his immediate demise. Chaos erupted throughout the market in the aftermath, with the agents fleeing the scene.”\nSubsequently, enraged Hausa youths moved the deceased boy’s body to their settlement for burial, as confirmed by another trader named Cyril Umoh.\nThe following day, a tense atmosphere lingered as a large group of the boy’s kinsmen, armed and seeking retribution, swarmed the Marian Market in search of the rate collectors.\nAnticipating unrest and reprisals, numerous market women and bus drivers operating in the vicinity abandoned their posts and vacated the market.\nIn response to the escalating situation, law enforcement authorities swiftly dispatched a significant contingent of police officers to the market to restore order.\nPolice spokesperson Irene Ugbo remarked, “While security briefings are conducted every morning, this particular issue was not raised. I am personally unaware of it at this time but will investigate and provide an update.”\nRecent accounts from traders have highlighted the abusive behavior of the rate collectors, including instances of harassment against female traders and the destruction of their goods.\nDespite the government’s decree banning rate collection due to these grievances, the agents have consistently flouted the directive.",

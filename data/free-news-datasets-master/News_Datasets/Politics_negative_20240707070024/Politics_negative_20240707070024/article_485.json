    "text": "Southern California, particularly the San Diego area, has already been beset with more than its fair share of problems. Illegal aliens are flooding the region, homelessness is out of control, and crime has been on the rise. The police in both San Diego and Los Angeles have had their hands full. But if one gun control group has its way, the cops' hands will be a bit more empty if they don't have any guns. CBS News just concluded a two-year study into how the police buy their firearms and how they dispose of them when they reach the end of their service life. They found that some of the old guns the police sold were later found at crime scenes. Further, they investigated the gun companies that sell firearms to the police and determined that some of them have been cited for violations when they improperly sold weapons or ammunition. Now, San Diego is considering a law that would ban the police from doing business with those companies.\nAdvertisement After a two-year KCAL News Investigation uncovered serious concerns about police selling their old weapons, a new case study has brought a new light to where agencies buy their new guns.\nTaxpayers are actually the biggest gun buyers in the country, purchasing $5 billion worth of guns a year for police agencies. Millions of taxpayer dollars are going to dealers who, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives claims have violated gun laws.\nThis issue has convinced one Southern Californian city to become the first in the country to try and stop it. Brady, the largest and oldest anti-gun violence group in the country, conducted a case study on LC Action.\nThese sound like some rather crazy complaints from people who were just looking for an excuse to cause trouble for the cops. As far as the police selling their old weapons goes, that's a common practice all over the country. The sales help replenish their budget so they can afford replacements. Everyone who seeks to purchase one is subjected to the same background check that shoppers go through at a gun store. Sometimes, after a weapon is sold, the new owner may decide to resell it. Or it could be stolen from their home or vehicle, eventually winding up at a crime scene. The police are not \"arming the criminals\" or selling firearms to felons. (If some of them are, they need to be arrested themselves.)\nThe companies selling firearms to these police departments are LC Action Police Supply and Adamson Police Products . Both are reputable companies that supply equipment to law enforcement, while also serving the general public. And they do a lot of business. LC Action has sold more than $18 million worth of goods to 67 law enforcement agencies just since 2015, not counting all of their sales to the public. Like all gun stores, they have to have their sales records reviewed on a regular basis. When an error in a sale is discovered, the incident is recorded and the company is charged with a fine. CBS found a grand total of 40 such incidents at LC Action since 1995. Forty incidents in nearly thirty years sounds like a pretty good record to me.\nAdvertisement Adamson Police Products is similarly situated in the market. They do a somewhat smaller volume of business with law enforcement, though it still adds up to millions of dollars. The investigation revealed that they had received roughly a dozen similar citations since 2011. That works out to fewer than one per year. CBS and San Diego are making it sound like the stores are running some sort of criminal racket, but their records are actually quite solid.\nThis entire scheme was cooked up between the San Diego City Council and the Brady : United Against Gun Violence gun control group. They haven't succeeded in repealing the Second Amendment or completely outlawing firearms yet (though they are trying), so they probably see this as the next best thing. By bringing public pressure on gun shops that supply police departments, they are most likely trying to make it more difficult or at least more expensive for the police to obtain firearms. Never mind the fact that the police, even in California, are the ones who are taking illegal firearms off the streets every single week at great risk to themselves. These people have never seen a firearm they didn't hate and they always prefer to blame the police rather than the criminals. You can probably expect to see even more police officers pulling the plug and making the move to red states where they will be more appreciated and better funded and equipped.",

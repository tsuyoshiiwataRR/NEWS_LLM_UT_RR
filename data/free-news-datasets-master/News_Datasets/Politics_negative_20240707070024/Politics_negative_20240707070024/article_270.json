    "text": "A Democrat-led town council in Connecticut voted against a motion to fly the Thin Blue Line flag at in honor of a state trooper killed in the line of duty last week. Aaron Pelletier, Trooper First Class, was killed last week while conducting a traffic stop on a state highway. A car hit Pelletier, his squad car, and the car he&#039;d pulled over. The officer died from his injuries at the scene. Thousands of people have subsequently paid tribute to the 34-year-old father of two young boys, but Democrats on the Wethersfield town council voted on Monday not to fly the Thin Blue Line flag in his honor, which had been suggested by councilmember Rich Bailey. The motion failed by a vote of 5-3, which came after the council had already agreed to fly a Pride Flag for the duration of June. Aaron Pelletier (top left), Trooper First Class, was killed last week while conducting a traffic stop on a state highway. He leaves behind his wife, Dominique (top right) and two young sons [video_shortcode_video_html_5 src=&quot;https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/06/06/6571725332899606659/1024x576_MP4_6571725332899606659.mp4&quot;] At the meeting on Monday, Emily Zambrello, a Democratic member of the council said of the Thin Blue Line flag: &#039;That flag was either created or at least became prevalent in direct response to the Black Lives Matter protests, which were fueled in part by the killing of George Floyd by police. &#039;It’s viewed as antagonistic even if you don’t see it that way and I don’t think that’s a good flag to fly, especially not without further discussion.&#039; Fellow councilmember Brianna Timbro, a Republican, argued that the Thin Blue Line flag existed well before the Black Lives Matter protests and bears no relation to the Police Lives Matter movement, which Zambrello was referring to. Read More Widow&amp;#x27;s heartbreak as Connecticut State Trooper is killed during traffic stop At the Pride ceremony at Wethersfield Town Hall on Tuesday morning, the rainbow LGBTQ+ flag flew at half-mast to honor Pelletier&#039;s sacrifice. &#039;We won&#039;t be raising the pride flag today. It&#039;s already up on the pole at half-staff in honor of his passing,&#039; said state representative Amy Morrin Bello as she spoke at the ceremony. Governor Ned Lamont, a Democrat, was in attendance at the ceremony. He had previously directed state flags to be flown at half-mast to honor Pelletier. When asked what the Thin Blue Line flag means to her, Zambrello said it &#039;represents racism and antagonism to many, many people.&#039; &#039;It&#039;s not appropriate to raise above out Town Hall, especially when our flag policy prohibits us from doing anything associated with hate,&#039; she added. She also said that it does not matter if the Thin Blue Line flag means something different to some people, who choose to fly it on their personal property as a sign of solidarity with the law enforcement community. UNFREAKINGBELIEVABLE Democrats in CT voted against flying the American blue line flag to honor fallen officer Aaron Pelletier who was kiIIed in the line of duty. Instead they flew the pride flag at half staff to honor him. The pride flag. I have no words. This is disgraceful.… https://t.co/J0jLfj7j6l pic.twitter.com/7qJQ9oZqSA — Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) June 6, 2024 When asked what the Thin Blue Line flag means to her, Democratic councilwoman Emily Zambrello (pictured) said it &#039;represents racism and antagonism to many, many people,&#039; and added that it doesn&#039;t matter if others believe the flag is a way to honor the men in blue While some town residents commended the decision of he council agreeing that the Thin Blue Line flag is racist, others harshly condemned the group and said they will remember this action when election day arrives Some councilmembers contested the decision, arguing that the Thin Blue Line flag existed well before the Black Lives Matter protests and bears no relation to the Police Lives Matter movement Social media commentator Libs of TikTok highlighted the incident on her well-trafficked account, writing: &#039;Watch fallen state trooper Aaron Pelletier’s wife honor her husband. Aaron leaves behind a loving wife and 2 young children who will now grow up without a father. &#039;Democrats led by Emily Zambrello decided to fly the PRIDE FLAG at half staff to honor Aaron. They refused a request to fly the American thin blue line flag because it “represents racism and antagonism.” &#039;This is how Democrats honor a fallen officer. How degrading and disrespectful. There’s no low for them.&#039; Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a staunch defender of the law enforcement community, responded to Libs of TikTok&#039;s post, simply writing: &#039;This is ridiculous.&#039; Some Wethersfield residents expressed their discontent with the council&#039;s decision by commenting on the town&#039;s Facebook page. &#039;What disgusting behavior! The people who voted to not fly the blue line flag are hopefully voted out of office. When it comes time to vote, remember this,&#039; wrote Sheila Bekker Ierardi. &#039;They approve a sex flag but deny a police flag honoring a murdered Trooper. Shameful and Disgusting,&#039; wrote Bob Smith. &#039;Democrats hate the police,&#039; said Martin Riggs. And finally, &#039;Weak politicians are exactly why the pos who killed him were free to do so in the first place. What an absolute disgrace of a town,&#039; wrote Kiana Marie.

He had been a state trooper for nine years, a job his supervisors said he loved In an emotional speech at her husband&#039;s memorial on Wednesday, Dominique Pelletier called her husband a &#039;man of integrity and honor.&#039; &#039;I will make sure our children always know those traits definitely came from him,&#039; she added before addressing her husband specifically. &#039;To my honey, you weren’t just my husband. You were my home. You were my heart. You were my safe place and my provider. My best friend. My secret keeper. My favorite gossiper. &#039;The light in our smiles will be forever dimmed and the thought of this world without that laugh seems unimaginable but has already become real. I promise to keep you alive in our home, in our heart and in our boys’ memories forever. I love you, and I miss you.&#039; Governor Lamont, whose wife appears to have made a $5,000 donation to Pelletier&#039;s family in the wake of his killing, was also in attendance at the memorial. The service was preceded by a 20-mile procession from a funeral home in Southington to the Hartford amphitheater where the service was held. Pelletier&#039;s casket was escorted by dozens of police motorcycles and cars. Fire ladder trucks also flew American flags along the route.

The suspect, Alex Oyola-Sanchez, 44, has been charged with 2nd degree manslaughter with a motor vehicle, operating while intoxicated, as well as operating a motor vehicle without minimum insurance, failure to drive in proper lane, and evading responsibility resulting in death. Cops claim he was on a dizzying array of drugs at the time of the collision, including fentanyl and cocaine. Oyola-Sanchez is being held on a $5million bond. He had previously served a federal sentence for murder and was arrested for homicide in Puerto Rico. A GoFundMe for Pelletier&#039;s wife and children has raised nearly $575,000.",

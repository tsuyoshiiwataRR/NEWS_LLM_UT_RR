A bunch of Republican congressmen showed up at at Trump's New York trial wearing blue suits and red ties. Given that Trump's authoritarian desires are so obvious, it seems that these ring-kissers will back their \"Dear Leader\" no matter what. The sad part is that, those Republican house members and senators don't have the slightest idea that they may as well be wearing the equivalent of swastika armbands. So they're either totally ignorant of modern history, or they are true Nazi pricks. I can't see a third alternative.

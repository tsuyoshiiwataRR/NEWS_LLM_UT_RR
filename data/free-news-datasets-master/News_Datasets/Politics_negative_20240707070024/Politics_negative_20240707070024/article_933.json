    "text": "Federal Education Minister Jason Clare has delivered a blunt message to Nine chairman Peter Costello [amid accusations the former treasurer assaulted The Australian journalist Liam Mendes by pushing him over at Canberra Airport on Thursday.](https://7news.com.au/news/moment-channel-nine-chairman-peter-costello-allegedly-assaults-journalist-at-airport-c-14934653) Canberra Airport has said it would provide the CCTV footage to the police and to the journalist, if requested, according to several reports on Sunrise. WATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Federal MPs weigh in after Nine chairman Peter Costello accused of assaulting journalist at airport. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: [Download today ](https://7news.com.au/app?utm_source=7NEWS&utm_medium=contextual-link-app&utm_campaign=7news-app) Costello has strenuously denied pushing or assaulting Mendes after he was approached by Mendes and asked questions about the sexual harassment scandal engulfing the Channel Nine news division. “You’ve got to answer the questions, Mr Costello. Don’t, don’t. You’ve just assaulted me,” Mendes can be heard saying in a video capturing the event. However, Costello later denied pushing the reporter. “There was a reporter walking backwards with his phone filming. As I walked past him he walked back into an advertising placard and he fell over,” Costello said. “I did not strike him. If he’s upset about that, I’m sorry. But I did not strike him.” On Friday, Clare joined Nat Barr and deputy leader of the Opposition, Sussan Ley, for Hot Topics, where they addressed the incident. “Everyone should be safe at work,” Clare said, clarifying he was speaking in general terms. “Nobody should be pushing other people around. The journalist said it did happen. Mr Costello said it didn’t happen. “There is CCTV footage I am sure the airport has (it). “It is a question as to if they will release that or provide it to the police,” Clare said. Clare said the simplest way to deal with a question from a reporter was to just stop and answer it. Meanwhile, Ley said such an act would be out of character for Costello. “I have known Peter Costello for many years, and I have never known him to be aggressive in nature. “There are different camera angles. I haven’t seen them all. “Peter has spoken about it and the journalist has spoken about it. It is worth remembering that in public life people do need to be respectful whether they are public figures, journalists, politicians, whoever. “It is an untidy incident. We do need to maintain respect, but let’s see.” Channel Nine’s veteran news director Darren Wick [sensationally quit the company earlier this year following allegations](https://7news.com.au/news/female-staffer-complaint-reportedly-preceded-nine-entertainment-news-boss-darren-wicks-departure-c-14727333) of inappropriate behaviour towards a female staff member. Wick quit the company on March 15 after a long period of leave starting in mid-January. More than a dozen current and former Nine employees have since spoken to The Daily Telegraph, on condition of anonymity, about a culture they allege allowed Wick to behave inappropriately and get away with it.

    "text": "Two weeks after Yakima City Council rejected a Pride Proclamation for the first time, community members spoke up at Tuesday’s council meeting. Responses have ranged from criticism to praise as residents across the Yakima Valley react to two rejected Pride Proclamations in the county’s two largest cities – Yakima and [Sunnyside](https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/government/sunnyside-is-second-yakima-county-community-to-reject-pride-proclamation/article_9156c390-1e0a-11ef-9d83-dff47794f167.html). Some are disappointed. Yakima resident Heath Lambe spoke at Tuesday’s city council meeting and called the rejection a step in the wrong direction. “It suggests a lack of commitment to representing all of Yakima,” said Lambe. “As a proud, LGBTQ citizen of the Yakima community, I’m disappointed we’re walking backwards.” Other community members supported Yakima City Council’s decision – a [5 to 2 vote](https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/government/yakima-to-accelerate-north-first-street-road-project-council-rejects-pride-proclamation/article_5d5d1a9e-17fc-11ef-a6ac-3fd40f3eb9d8.html) rejecting the proclamation on May 21. Corey Gibson, another Yakima resident, said the proclamation would be divisive. People should focus on being American citizens, he said. “Today, (Pride) has morphed into something I don’t recognize as a gay person,” Gibson said. Pride celebrations started in June 1970, when demonstrators advocating for equal rights for LGBTQ+ people commemorating events at the Stonewall Inn in New York City, when the police raided the Stonewall Inn in 1969. The proclamation is not dissuading members of the LGBTQ+ from celebrating Pride. [Pride celebrations](https://www.yakimaherald.com/explore_yakima/yakima-pride-celebrates-with-a-parade-and-festival-on-saturday/article_a091dc16-1f6b-11ef-89b0-0becf05e0665.html?utm_campaign=blox&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR3hx1BjSSBTtt66WYEcHHoAUBmkb24COGiOCGJ8-qypIblmZyPHJ8ctoCE_aem_AdOfOT9iT7xyrl4jaoIcNgt_8WOTgWe_gahnsm8iDBOJHLXzlJd4Vp3WWTDWqJI_iQBAxonZRafvNPkXqkejEPCO) will be in full swing this weekend – up to 5,000 could attend the parade and festival in Downtown Yakima and at State Fair Park this weekend. Celebrations are also set to take place in Sunnyside, said Chelsea Dimas, the Sunnyside resident who submitted the city’s proclamation. Community members react Yakima Pride, which is organizing Pride celebrations, released a statement on Facebook from its president, Joshua Hastings, after the proclamation was rejected. Hastings said members of Yakima’s LGBTQ2S+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Two-Spirit and more) contributed to Yakima and rejecting the proclamation marginalized them. “The proposed proclamation wasn’t just a symbolic gesture; it was a recognition of the ongoing struggles for equality and a celebration of our diverse identities,” read Hastings’ statement. Hastings added that rejecting the proclamation could impact youth who are working toward self-acceptance. “Your decision tells them they are unwelcome, unseen, and unsupported by their own city leadership. This is unacceptable,” he said. Gibson was one of several public commenters who felt the struggle for acceptance was already successful. He felt gay people were accepted in Yakima and community members should focus on coming together under the American flag. “This isn’t against anybody, this is for us all to come together under one flag, which is a beautiful thing,” he said. Another Yakima resident, Toni Ballard, called the council’s decision courageous and said she did not want to celebrate Pride Month. “I hope you can move on from here,” she said. “Move on, tackle the issues that will really help Yakima.” But plenty of other Yakima residents were concerned by the city council’s vote. Julie Busie asked city council members to come to Pride events and see what the celebration was about. “We’re not asking for anything extra than you would give anyone else,” Busie said. “Come to Pride, have a good time, get to know us before you judge us.” Lambe asked that council reconsider its vote. Tim Janke, a retired Yakima resident, said having the Pride Proclamation showed inclusivity. He added that rejecting the Pride Proclamation could discourage businesses and visitors and have economic effects. Council members explain their votes Not all council members have taken the time to comment. Council members Reedy Berg, Leo Roy, Matt Brown, Rick Glenn and Mayor Patricia Byers voted no on the proclamation. Danny Herrera and Janice Deccio voted yes. Herrera and Glenn provided brief comments after the meeting on their decisions. Since then, Brown, who is also deputy mayor, released a press release. He said he voted no to focus on critical issues, like crime, homelessness and the cost of living and to create a more united community. “Building positive relationships and addressing real problems should be our priority,” he said. He added that, while he supports people living their best lives under the law and believes in core values of love and acceptance, the Pride proclamation went against his personal beliefs. “I cannot support the Pride proclamation as it conflicts with my core beliefs and those of many Yakima citizens,” Brown said. Berg said the lack of a proclamation doesn’t stop people from celebrating Pride, but that his constituents did not support the proclamation. “I have had many conversations with constituents from District 7, and a majority of them didn’t feel that Pride Month was something worth promoting,” he said. “The city needs to focus on Public Safety, Homelessness and our Budget Issues instead of virtue signaling.” Deccio, one of the two yes votes, said proclamations have no cost to the city. They do not take away from other duties or issues, she added, and council members should not vote based on personal beliefs, but for the people they represent. “We need to be impartial. We represent those people who request proclamations,” Deccio said. “I may or may not always agree with the content of a proposed proclamation, but I have yet to vote no on one.” Sunnyside City Council also rejects Pride Yakima was not the only city to reject a Pride Proclamation this year. It’s almost more accurate to say Yakima followed Sunnyside – Sunnyside Mayor Dean Broersma decided [not to issue a Pride Proclamation](https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/lower_valley/sunnyside-mayors-decision-to-not-sign-pride-proclamation-draws-mix-of-reaction/article_72db625e-1519-11ee-a2a7-73ebf5e179c1.html) in 2023, as well. This year, Sunnyside City Council members voted on whether or not to issue a proclamation and, after a 3-3 tie, the proclamation was rejected on May 28. Broersma said based on the rules used in Sunnyside, tie votes did not pass. Dimas, a Sunnyside resident and head of local nonprofit Raíces, said a proclamation would have signaled acceptance for a community that is still discriminated against. “Having a proclamation in general, but especially for Pride, it shows that our community recognizes and acknowledges our LGBTQ+ community,” she said. Dimas added that she was disappointed that council members had voted no. She was planning to submit a proclamation for a Pride week, instead of a month, and host Pride events in Sunnyside at the end of June. Broersma was one of the no votes, but did not elaborate on the reasons behind his vote. He added that he considered residents’ desires, the community’s interests and his personal beliefs in the decisions he makes in Sunnyside City Council and that this decision was grounded in his personal beliefs. “I know my mind, I know where I was going to be on this issue,” Broersma said. “This one is largely on my personal convictions and beliefs.” Broersma added that community sentiment seemed divided – commenters at the May 28 meeting spoke for and against the proclamation. Councilmember Vicky Frausto, who voted for the proclamation, called it an easy decision and said the proclamation could bring the community together, rather than divide it. She said respecting differences between people through proclamations created unity. “It was a yes for unity and really recognizing someone else’s lived experience and recognizing our shared humanity,” Frausto said. “What makes it divisive is if we start using our own beliefs to dictate what people deserve or how they should be treated.” Frausto and Broersma both said they are open to talking with community members about their beliefs. Broersma said he would discuss his reasons for voting no at greater length if people were willing to reach out.

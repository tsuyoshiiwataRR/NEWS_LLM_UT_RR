    "text": "MAGA conservatives constantly try to rewrite history, and Newsmax guest Jessie Jane Duff went there, too. As much as MAGA would like to change the fact that former President Donald Trump was impeached twice, they cannot do that. They tried in retaliation to impeach President Joe Biden, but that failed. The thing is, a President needs to do something wrong in order to impeach him. It can't be because he curb-stomped your candidate in 2020 and hurt your feewings. They cannot change the fact that Donald was convicted of 34 counts. Trump is now a felon. But not if you're Ms. Duff. \"Well, obviously, Judge Merchan, an authoritarian type of judge, has obviously opposed Donald Trump every step of the way,\" co-host Mercedes Schlapp falsely said, according to [Media Matters](https://www.mediamatters.org/newsmax/newsmax-guest-falsely-claims-donald-trump-has-not-been-convicted). \"I mean, you were nodding your head when Daniel was speaking, Jesse Jane —\" \"I did,\" Duff explained. \"Just nodding in disagreement, to clarify here...\" \"Is that a new type of nodding?\" co-host Daniel Lippman asked. Yes, yes, it's a new type of nodding,\" Duff said. \"I wasn't agreeing; I was disagreeing because Judge Merchan is not going to be intimidated. He's already run the trial. It's over.\" \"He obviously disregarded every indication that he shouldn't have been on the trial,\" she continued. \"Everyone knows that he had made contributions to the Biden campaign, which no judge is supposed to do.\" Note: For the record, Judge Merchan donated a whopping $15 to the Biden campaign. \"We all know about what was going on with his family and profiting off of this,\" she continued as if she couldn't stop herself. \"So I dare to say that Donald Trump is probably going to disregard this gag order.\" \"It should — if they should not lift it, he'll pay the fine,\" she added. \"You know? And if they — you know, they are also — let's clarify. He has not been convicted. He will have a — potentially a stay to get through the appeals until the conviction is handed down. So right now, he is not convicted.\" He was convicted, you weirdo. These people are a font of disinformation slathered in some sort of hallucinogenic.",

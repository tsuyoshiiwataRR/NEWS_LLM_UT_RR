    "text": "Pride Month has kicked up a hornets nest of LGBT activism and wouldn't you know it, so much of that activism is focused on children this year. On Thursday, I wrote about how parents should ditch the wildly popular kids YouTuber \"Ms. Rachel\" for her incessant pandering to the LGBT community, going so far as to invite Dylan Mulvaney to be in one of her videos. (READ: [It's Time for Parents to Ditch Ms. Rachel](https://redstate.com/brandon_morse/2024/06/06/its-time-for-parents-to-ditch-ms-rachel-n2175124)) Also on Thursday, my colleague Becky Noble published an article detailing how Scholastic, a major children's book publisher, has released a \"Pride Guide,\" which gives students and teachers a glossary of radical left LGBT terminology and even makes villains out of parents who don't want LGBT-focused reading material in schools, offering resources for anyone who wants to get a hold of these books if the school district won't allow their purchase through school funds. (READ: [Textbook Publisher Puts Out 'Pride Guide' for Teachers, Will Find 'Work Around' of School District Rules](https://redstate.com/beckynoble/2024/06/06/textbook-publisher-puts-out-pride-guide-for-teachers-will-find-work-around-of-school-district-rules-n2175121)) There seems to be a prevailing thought within the LGBT activist community that children are up for grabs and that indoctrination and grooming into the LGBT lifestyle isn't just good, it's necessary. You can see this in the way LGBT activists and politicians refer to children as a community-owned object. Take, for instance, my colleague [Jennifer O'Connell's report](https://redstate.com/jenniferoo/2024/06/05/ca-sen-scott-wieners-pride-month-rant-claims-these-are-our-kids-read-the-room-buddy-n2175073) on Wednesday about California Sen. Scott Wiener's Pride Month speech where he referred to California's children as \"our kids.\" \"We are always there for these kids. These are our kids, and we need to make sure that we are lifting them up and giving them a path to success. So we are working very hard to make that happen,\" he said. \"But as we fight all the nasty people out there who are trying to harm us, and we're gonna beat them, and we're gonna win. Let's celebrate, let's have just a festive and uplifting month. I'm so excited about it. Happy Pride, everyone,\" he later added. This is the same Scott Wiener who supports policies [removing parental consent](https://redstate.com/kiradavis/2022/06/10/california-state-senator-suggests-drag-101-be-a-k-12-curriculum-requirement-n577110) in significant medical decisions for minors. The same Scott Wiener that nominated a member of the \"Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence,\" an anti-Christian LGBT group who uses sacrilegious imagery, to be honored on by the State Senate last year. That member was \"Sister Roma,\" a porn director who likes to review pornographic movies on his podcast. This is the same Scott Wiener who said [\"Drag 101\"](https://redstate.com/kiradavis/2022/06/10/california-state-senator-suggests-drag-101-be-a-k-12-curriculum-requirement-n577110) should be a K-12 curriculum requirement in schools. That's this same Scott Wiener... hey— Riley Gaines (@Riley_Gaines_) [@Scott_Wiener], this you???? [https://t.co/Y3xqyKQ9CT] [pic.twitter.com/ODLyCTcvFO] [March 26, 2024] I don't want to hear about how these people simply care about the LGBT youth. At this point, anyone buying that load of garbage is either willfully ignorant or a part of the grooming scam. Too many events and outright [declarations](https://redstate.com/streiff/2021/07/09/the-san-francisco-gay-mens-chorus-celebrated-pride-month-by-boasting-that-they-are-coming-for-your-children-n408742) that they're interested in your children for anyone to logically believe that they're just talking about the kids who just so happen to be gay or trans. Using language that points to my child and says \"ours\" is the same exact thing as pointing to me and saying \"we're your mortal enemy, and we want your child.\" I can only describe the word ours as \"bold and stupid.\" Keep in mind, these activists aren't just saying things like this in a vacuum. They do it because they know that they'll have the backing of the state in various places. The goal is to work in legislation that allows for the state to step in and also the parent. More accurately, the goal is to have the state force the parents to step back and allow the LGBT activist community to also be the child's parents, usually in the form of a teacher, counselor, or authority figure. Let's get a simple out of the way first. Every [study](https://ifstudies.org/blog/less-poverty-less-prison-more-college-what-two-parents-mean-for-black-and-white-children) shows that a child is [better off ](https://aifs.gov.au/research/research-reports/family-structure-child-outcomes-and-environmental-mediators)in the care and guidance of his or her own parents. Educational outcomes, economic stability, psychological well-being, and quality of life as adults all have far higher chances of success when a stable two parent home is left to its own devices. That's two-parent home. Not two parents and a man named Rhonda. But this doesn't matter to the LGBT community because ultimately, your kids don't matter to them. They are a means to an end. The more kids they can infect the more voting power they'll have down the line and the more perversions they can indulge in today. Anyone who actively wants to bring children into talks about sex and sexuality is a pervert and groomer. There is no middle ground here. On that note, there are no \"trans kids.\" Any adult that claims a child that just mastered the ABC's somehow has the cognitive capacity to wrap their heads around complex subjects like gender fluidity and sexuality is either a useful idiot or a groomer, and both need their hard drives checked. Looking at you, Scott Wiener. Also, keep in mind, this isn't just Wiener and a small group of people. This is the LGBT activist community en masse that push this stuff. This is what they continuously work toward. They're very open about it, and they proudly display their work whenever they get the chance. Wonder why you've recently seen so much footage of drag shows where children are involved? It's because they want you to watch them do it, and they want you to get angry about it. They want you to react because they think it garners them victim points, which they can use for sympathetic media stories. Let me be very clear here. They haven't seen a reaction. They've noticed responses from parents forming groups to protect children from them. Likewise, they've seen responses from politicians and governors crafting laws to erect barriers between them and our children...but they haven't seen a real reaction. They don't want that reaction, but that's the reaction they're going to get if they keep pushing in every avenue they can toward our kids. Let me doubly clear here. I'm not saying Americans are going to go hunting for LGBT people in the street. Most gays and lesbians I know are just as horrified and disgusted with the LGBT activist community as we are. The thing is, the activist community is pushing so hard and so far that the reaction from the public will be nasty. The governorship of Glenn Youngkin is proof that Americans will uproot legacy Democrats from strongholds to protect their kids. Parents will remove entire school boards over it. For every toe they put over the line, Americans will push them back miles. These LGBT activists are high on their own supply if they think America's kids belong to anyone but their parents. The idea that somehow they have any right to claim ownership over the flesh and blood of any American proves just how hubristic the LGBT activist community has gotten. However, they need to understand that they are a hardcore minority and that their power isn't what they think it is. They might enjoy having their way in deep blue strongholds like San Francisco, but in the real America, where people love their children more than their politics, they're playing a very dangerous game. Because at some point, I'm afraid this will get violent. Parents have recently shown [they're willing](https://redstate.com/bobhoge/2023/06/06/breaking-massive-brawl-breaks-out-at-glendale-ca-school-board-as-armenian-american-parents-take-on-the-woke-mob-n757376) to resort to blows to protect their children from ideologues, and it won't be the last time. These are our children. Many in the LGBT community probably can't wrap their heads around what that means because to them, children are a tool, but there's a reason almost every creature in the animal kingdom becomes dangerous when you get close to their offspring. There's a deeper love there than the \"love\" they think they represent, and it's the kind of love that stops people from being \"tolerant.\" We won't have a choice.",

    "text": "Teachers in Portland, OR, Push Anti-Israel Propaganda on Kindergarten Students\n“A group of bullies called Zionists wanted our land so they stole it by force and hurt many people.”\n1 Comment\nFor the left, you are never too young to begin being politically indoctrinated. These are public schools.\nChris Rufo reports at\nCity Journal:\nIn Portland, the Intifada Begins in Kindergarten\nPortland, Oregon, has earned its reputation as America’s most radical city. Its public school system was an early\n[proponent]of left-wing racialism and has long pushed students toward political activism. As with the death of George Floyd four years ago, the irruption of Hamas terrorism in Israel has provided Portland’s public school revolutionaries with another cause du jour: now they’ve ditched the raised fist of Black Lives Matter and traded it in for the black-and-white keffiyeh of Palestinian militants.\nI have obtained a\n[collection]of publicly accessible documents produced by the Portland Association of Teachers, an affiliate of the state teachers’ union that encourages its more than [4,500 members]to “Teach Palestine!” (The union did not respond to a request for comment.)\nThe lesson plans are steeped in radicalism, and they begin teaching the principles of “decolonization” to students as young as four and five years old. For prekindergarten kids, the union promotes a\n[workbook]from the Palestinian Feminist Collective, which tells the story of a fictional Palestinian boy named Handala. “When I was only ten years old, I had to flee my home in Palestine,” the boy tells readers. “A group of bullies called Zionists wanted our land so they stole it by force and hurt many people.” Students are encouraged to come up with a slogan that they can chant at a protest and complete a maze so that Handala can “get back home to Palestine”—represented as a map of Israel.\nOther pre-K resources include a\n[video]that repeats left-wing mantras, including “I feel safe when there are no police,” and a [slideshow]that glorifies the Palestinian intifada, or violent resistance against Israel. The recommended resource list also [includes]a “sensory guide for kids” on attending protests. It teaches children what they might see, hear, taste, touch, and smell at protests, and promotes photographs of slogans such as “Abolish Prisons” and “From the River to the Sea.”\nIn kindergarten through second grade, the ideologies intensify. The teachers’ union recommends a\n[lesson], “Art and Action for Palestine,” that teaches students that Israel, like America, is an oppressor. The objective is to “connect histories of settler colonialism from Palestine to the United States” and to “celebrate Palestinian culture and resistance throughout history and in the present, with a focus on Palestinian children’s resistance.” []https://legalinsurrection.com/subscribe/ DONATE\nDonations tax deductible\nto the full extent allowed by law.",

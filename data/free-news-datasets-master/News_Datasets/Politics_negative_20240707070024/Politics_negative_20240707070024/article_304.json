    "text": "Jasper County’s Treasurer says county is stopping him from doing his job JASPER COUNTY, Sc. (WTOC) - Jasper County’s Treasurer is asking the South Carolina Supreme Court to order some county officials to grant him access to all government bank accounts. This after he’s accused the county of denying him access to a majority of those funds. Since taking office Jasper County treasurer, Michael Skinner said he’s identified 96 county bank accounts. He said he’s been denied access to all but 23 of those. Skinner calls that a violation of county ordinance. The filing names both the county’s administrator and the administrative services director. Skinner said requests to administration for access to all county-related accounts have been denied. He said granting him access to those funds would allow for better management of taxpayer money. “The best outcome would be gaining those assets and finding money that is sitting there in an account that really isn’t doing us any good, and being able to move that into a better money market, better interest rate, invest that money, and increase Jasper County’s revenue,” said Skinner. In a statement to WTOC, Jasper County Administrator said officials have not been served with a lawsuit and said “when we receive it, we will be consulting with our Attorney to assess the claims. We would expect him to advise what response is appropriate, if any, as the County generally does not comment on pending litigation.” Skinner’s lawyer said the county has 20 days to respond. Ultimately, it’s the state Supreme Court’s decision whether or not to take up this case. Copyright 2024 WTOC. All rights reserved.",

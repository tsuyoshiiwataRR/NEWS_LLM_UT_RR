The woe that has presently befallen Trump, they prophesy, will boomerang against his enemies, who will suffer defeat as Trump steps again into the power God has ordained for him. Julie Green is an internet preacher from Iowa who hands out biblical prophecy as if it were a daily horoscope. In a prophetic word filmed shortly after Trumps conviction, Green delivered a message she claimed was sent down from the most high. Woe to the enemies of Almighty God. You are laughing, thinking you got what you desired, Green said, voicing her version of the Christian deity. I will tell you I will have the last laugh. Your verdict is a joke. And an illusion I will show you whose verdict really counts. My son is not guilty, Green claimed God said of Trump. And the world will see your kangaroo courts, and how they are a joke, and how they are nothing against Me. Casting Trump in the mold of a biblical king, Green continued, I say, you do not have my David where you want him. But I have you where I want you. I told you you will reap what you have sown Your show is about to end, and my children are about to laugh. God said there would be a boomerang, Kunneman said on a show filmed shortly after the Trump verdict was handed down. In other words, those who would seek for indictments, they themselves would be indicted. Kunneman then asserted that Trumps conviction is also set for reversal. God said, you will see things flop. It will look like it is absolutely over. And then it will flop and then flip. And it will turn in the way of the favor of God.

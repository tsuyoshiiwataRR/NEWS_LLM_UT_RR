    "text": "GUWAHATI: Assam CM and BJP star campaigner Himanta Biswa Sarma said Thursday the party brass had directed him to refrain from canvassing in northeastern states, except Arunachal Pradesh, because of boundary disputes involving his state and its neighbours.Sarma’s comments came in the wake of NDA’s electoral setbacks in BJP-governed Manipur, where it lost both seats to Congress. Similarly, NDA conceded one seat to Congress in Nagaland, and regional outfit Voice of the People Party (VPP) and Congress secured one each in Meghalaya.According to Sarma, he was asked to “not be seen in these states frequently”, and instead focus his campaign efforts in eastern India, covering Odisha, Jharkhand, and Bengal. “I could not contribute to the best of my abilities in Manipur, Nagaland, and Meghalaya,” said the CM, who is also the convener of BJP-led North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), an NDA-like grouping for the region.He attributed NDA’s defeats in these states to the influence of a particular religious community over the electorate. “When religious people take part in politics, politicians cannot compete. You can compete with Congress, BJP, AGP, but how can you compete with the Sankaracharya or Srimanta Sankardeva? When spiritual leaders decide voting patterns, politicians’ roles become minimised,” Sarma said.Further clarifying, he said: “It’s unimaginable that Agatha Sangma (sitting MP of NDA ally NPP) would lose by more than one lakh votes (in Tura, Meghalaya).”Responding to Sarma’s remarks, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi condemned the CM’s statements. He tweeted: “…He does not have the maturity to accept responsibility for the NDA’s losses in Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Manipur. I appeal to the chief ministers of the respective states to publicly condemn the statement. Together we must preserve the unique identity of the Northeast.”Sarma described the setbacks as specific to this election. “This time they (people) had some grievances and expressed them through voting. It will be erased.”NDA performed well in Assam, winning 11 of 14 seats. The alliance also maintained its dominance in Arunachal and Tripura, securing both seats in each state. BJP also formed its govt in Arunachal, with a landslide victory in simultaneous assembly polls. However, NDA’s overall LS tally of 15 seats in the region was three less than what it achieved in 2019.TOI reported earlier on BJP’s decision to deploy Sarma outside the region, suggesting a strategic move to leverage his skills nationally and potentially groom him for a larger role within the party. This also suggested a deliberate distancing from the complex political climate of North-East, where BJP has had a mixed record.",

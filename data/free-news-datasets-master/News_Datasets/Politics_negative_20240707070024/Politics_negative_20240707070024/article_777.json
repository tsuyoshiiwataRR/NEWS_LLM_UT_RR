    "text": "President Joe Biden raised eyebrows while attending the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion in Normandy, France ‚Äî and then apparently had to be escorted away from the festivities while French President Emmanuel Macron remained on-site to greet the veterans.\nAt one point during the ceremonies, Biden appeared confused about whether he was supposed to remain standing or sit down, resulting in an awkward half-squat as he looked behind him to see where the chair might be. First lady Jill Biden, who quickly raised one hand in front of her mouth, seemed like she could be feeding him directions.\nAwkward üò¨ pic.twitter.com/3KNLco85hj\n‚Äî RNC Research (@RNCResearch) June 6, 2024\n‚ÄúTFW you realize you had 3 cups of coffee and a bran muffin for breakfast,‚Äù @IowaHawkBlog posted.\nTFW you realize you had 3 cups of coffee and a bran muffin for breakfast https://t.co/1mCxIgpHiL\n‚Äî David Burge (@iowahawkblog) June 6, 2024\n‚ÄúYou should see him behind closed doors,‚Äù Stephen Miller added. ‚ÄúSharp and engaged.‚Äù\nYou should see him behind closed doors.

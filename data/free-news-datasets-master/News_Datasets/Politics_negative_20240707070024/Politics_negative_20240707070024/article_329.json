    "text": "In response to a video showing men slaughtering a goat in Krishnagiri district, BJP's Tamil Nadu state president, K Annamalai, has urged DMK cadre to avoid acts of violence. Speaking to reporters in Coimbatore, Annamalai suggested that if DMK members had grievances against him, they should address them directly. If necessary, they can confront me as I will be available in Coimbatore, he said.Annamalai responded to the video, suggesting that if the DMK workers were angry with him, they could confront him directly. If the DMK workers are so angry with me, I am here in Coimbatore... The innocent goat could have been spared, he said, according to news agency PTI.A video went viral today showing men purportedly slaying a goat with a photo of K Annamalai tied around its neck. The BJP's Tamil Nadu unit has demanded action over the video. The location of the incident and the person who posted the video remain unknown, and its authenticity could not be immediately verified.Tamil Nadu BJP Vice-President and Party Spokesperson Narayanan Thirupathy shared the video on social media platform X, criticizing the opposition's actions. Killing a goat in the middle of the road and shouting against @annamalai_k and celebrating his (LS polls) defeat clearly shows that the political parties are afraid of the growth of @BJP4India in Tamil Nadu, and exposes the lowest level of politics that the opposition political parties can stoop (to), Thirupathy stated.Thirupathy also condemned the involvement of children in the incident. Further, it can be heard on the video that small children were made to shout slogans against @annamalai_k. Instigating hate and anger in children is highly condemnable and exposes the opposition's silly, filthy politics. We expect strict action and arrest of these criminals, he added.In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, the DMK-led bloc won all 39 seats in Tamil Nadu and the lone Puducherry segment. Annamalai, who led the BJP alliance in Tamil Nadu, lost to DMK's Ganapathy P Rajkumar in Coimbatore. 110757243 110693863",

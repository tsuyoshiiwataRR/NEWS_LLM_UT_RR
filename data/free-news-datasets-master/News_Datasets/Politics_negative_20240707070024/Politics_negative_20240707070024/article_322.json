    "text": "Most Supreme Court Justices take gifts. A steak here, a bottle of wine there, and a comfortable bed in a luxury resort to rest after the excess. But they are playing in the lower minors of the bribery leagues. The All-Star pig at the trough is a man who is intimate with a wide range of rich people — from humble multi-millionaires to mid-range billionaires. Clarence Thomas has a record of venality that will likely stand as long as Joe DiMaggio’s 56-game hitting streak. Harlan Crow has received the most press as Thomas’s most prominent sugar daddy. Early in the year, ProPublica issued a damning report documenting the lavish trips Clarence took at the expense of billionaires. Crow was a marquee name. He had not just wined and dined the Justice, but also bought property from him. But Thomas’s venality runs deeper than the initial reports suggested. The group Fix the Court dove into the sewer Thomas swims in and uncovered the true extent of his entitled greed. The numbers are staggering. Thomas has vacuumed up $4,042,286 in plutocratic largesse — $2,402,310 in the last 20 years. Steven Mazie from the Economist has presented the data on all the Supremes. Thomas has not just lapped the field. He is playing in his own stadium It pays to be Justice Clarence Thomas.New data from @FixTheCourt on the value of gifts justices received & reported over the past two decades. pic.twitter.com/EE5f9wV1GY— Steven Mazie (@stevenmazie) June 6, 2024 It pays to be Justice Clarence Thomas.New data from @FixTheCourt on the value of gifts justices received & reported over the past two decades. pic.twitter.com/EE5f9wV1GY If you prefer bar charts, Steve Ratner has an equally graphic representation of Thomas’s conflicted behavior One of these Justices is not like the others.cc: @FixTheCourt pic.twitter.com/JraZfZ1olS— Steven Rattner (@SteveRattner) June 6, 2024 One of these Justices is not like the others.cc: @FixTheCourt pic.twitter.com/JraZfZ1olS We might once have been shocked at Antonin Scalia’s $210,164 haul. But to Thomas, that is sofa change, hardly worth getting out of bed for. SCOTUS is rotten. And unlike the legislative and executive branches, there is no viable method of punishing a crooked Justice. The Constitution no more prohibits a felon on the Court than it prohibits a felonious President. To pry Thomas off the bench, Congress would have to impeach him. And the Senate Republicans would never agree to losing a high-placed enabler. Forget an insurrection. Why should the GOP inspire violence to realize their goals when the Supreme Court will give it to them bloodlessly? Faced with a Republican Party that condones crime in high places — as long as it benefits them, Democrats need to take action. If they hold onto the Presidency and Senate and retake the House in November, then in 2025, they need to add four Justices to the bench - and dilute the poison flowing through the body politic.",

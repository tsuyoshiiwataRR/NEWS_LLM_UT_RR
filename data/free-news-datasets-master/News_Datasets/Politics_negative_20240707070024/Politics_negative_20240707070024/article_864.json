Russia accuses Sandu of fomenting Russophobia.\nGorgan was also suspended on Wednesday from his current position as head of security at the Chisinau office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the office's press secretary said. The office said it viewed \"the grave allegations ... very seriously\".\nMoldova, with its population of 2.5 million, has welcomed since 2022 more than a million Ukrainian refugees, the highest per capita number of any country. Some 100,000 remain in the country,\nGorgan, dismissed by Sandu as chief of staff in 2021, was a graduate of a Soviet-era military school. He had earned two top state honours - for Military Services in 2006 and for Faith in the Fatherland in 2015.\nFormer Defence Minister Anatolie Salaru told Moldovan televsion that it was \"abundantly clear that Gorgan is a traitor. He passed on very important information to the Russian special services. Russia uses traitors to destabilise Moldova.\"\n(Reporting by Alexander Tanas, Editing by Ron Popeski and Marguerita Choy)",

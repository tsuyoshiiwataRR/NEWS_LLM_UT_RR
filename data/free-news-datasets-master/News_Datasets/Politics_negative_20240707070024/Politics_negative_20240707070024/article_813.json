    "text": "Three non-voting MTA board members on Thursday described how they heard about Gov. Kathy Hochul’s plan to pause congestion pricing indefinitely.\n“On the news,” Randy Glucksman, an MTA board member, said.\nWhat You Need To Know MTA board members said they heard on the news about the governor's decision to put congestion pricing on hold indefinitely\nLawyers for the board are looking at what actions they can take\nSome members are hoping they can vote against the governor's recommendation “We got the rug pulled out right from under us,” Gerrard Bringmann, another MTA board member, said. “We didn’t know. This came out of left field.”\nSources told NY1 that MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber didn’t find out until two hours before the formal announcement. The board is in uncharted territory.\n“Now, everybody’s scrambling to find out exactly what we can do, what are the contingencies,” Bringmann said.\nWith it paused, some, like former City Traffic Commissioner Sam Schwartz, said maybe a plan could be floated that would get more buy in from the public. He has a plan that he says the Traffic Mobility Review Board — which proposed the current tolling scheme — didn’t want to consider.\n“There is a better plan out there that reflects the concerns of people from New Jersey,” Schwartz said. “No, they shouldn’t have to pay more. Truckers shouldn’t have to pay every time they come into the zone. Tolls in the other areas should be lower.”\n“I would love nothing better than I think it’s June 26, for MTA board members to say, ‘hey, we have a fiduciary responsibility here. And we voted for that plan and we’re keeping that plan.’” he added.\nGlucksman, Bringmann and Albert hope their colleagues who do have a vote on the board can do something to keep congestion pricing moving.\n“I would love to think the board will take a stance on this being that so much progress was set to be made,” Albert said.\nLawyers are looking into what the board can do, and yet, nothing is certain.\n“One of the problem is, it’s politics,” Bringmann said. “And six of the board members are directly appointed by the governor. So even though they were in support and voted in support of it, I’m sure the governor is going to make some phone calls and if this comes back to a vote, are they going to switch their votes or stand firm?”\nSources told NY1 the atmosphere at 2 Broadway was like a funeral on Wednesday. People there think the only way to fill the $15 billion hole in the $55 billion capital plan is through legislative action.",

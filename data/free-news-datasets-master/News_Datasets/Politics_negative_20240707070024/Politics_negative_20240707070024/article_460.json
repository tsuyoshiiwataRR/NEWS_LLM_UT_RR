    "text": "In Ebonyi State, the Labour Party (LP) has issued a warning of legal action against Ifeanyi Ogba for switching allegiance to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\nOgba emerged victorious in the 2023 general election representing Onicha East state constituency in the Ebonyi State House of Assembly under the banner of the Labour Party.\nChief Innocent Igiri, the publicity secretary of the Ebonyi State Labour Party, made this declaration during a meeting of party stakeholders held at the San Diego Hotel in Abakaliki on Thursday.\nHe emphasized that the election victory secured by the lawmaker was attributed to the Labour Party and asserted that they intend to reclaim their mandate.\nThe party’s representative highlighted that the Ebonyi State chapter will abstain from participating in the upcoming local government election, citing them as biased activities.\nHe informed that efforts by the national transition committee are underway to revitalize the Labour Party nationwide, with Ebonyi State actively involved.\nAccording to him: “The local government election in Ebonyi State is characterized by favoritism. We urge the Attorney General of the Federation to uphold efforts towards ensuring local government autonomy and the mandate for INEC to conduct local government elections. Only then will we engage in local polls with pride.”\nIn response to unidentified individuals procuring nomination forms, he stated: “Upon noticing unknown persons acquiring nomination and interest forms, we swiftly issued a disclaimer through various media, clarifying that the Labour Party has no candidates for the local government elections in Ebonyi State.”\nHe continued: “Some politicians in the state recruit non-party members as candidates to later claim Labour Party’s failure in the election. This prompted our explicit statement of lacking candidates for the local government polls.”\nHe further expressed the party’s resilience amid the exodus of members to the APC, highlighting their intention to pursue legal action against a Labour Party House of Assembly defector to the APC.\n“We are committed to challenging the defection of our Labour Party House of Assembly representative in court as his mandate is affiliated with our party,” he affirmed.",

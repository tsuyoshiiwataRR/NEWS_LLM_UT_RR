    "text": "KOTTAYAM: Unless the Left Front in Kerala is willing to learn from the repeated shock therapy administered by people, it risks suffering the same fate as the Left parties in West Bengal and Tripura, said Geevarghese Mar Coorilos, the metropolitan of Malankara Jacobite Syrian Church.In a social media post, the metropolitan attributed the Left’s failure primarily to a strong anti-incumbency wave and emphasized that this remains a stark reality despite CPM’s steadfast denial. He outlined several factors contributing to the Left’s failure, including shortcomings in economic policies, a lack of discipline, excessive spending, flawed police strategies, media hunting, corruption within the cooperative sector, pension issues, political violence associated with SFI, intolerance to criticism, and attempts to appease religious and communal groups beyond reasonable limits.The Left front’s aggressive campaign against Rahul Gandhi, who fought against fascism, raised concerns among secular people, he said, and pointed out that its criticism of Congress was harsher compared to its approach towards BJP.He cautioned against relying on floods and pandemics to come to its rescue and emphasized that people will not always be swayed by “kit politics”, particularly in Kerala. He also welcomed CPM leadership’s acknowledgment of the need for corrections. Stressing the deep-rooted complexity of the problems, the metropolitan said superficial remedies are insufficient.",

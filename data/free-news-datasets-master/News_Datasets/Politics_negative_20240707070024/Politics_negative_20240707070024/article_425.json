(Representational Image: DC) Warangal : A gang of robbers wearing face masks looted the passengers of gold ornaments on Nagarsol-Narsapur express train on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday in Hanamkonda district. The incident took place when the train was slowed down due to an underconstruction bridge between Nashkal and Pendiyal railway stations near the Kazipet railway station.\nAccording to the sources, around 20 robbers waiting beside the tracks suddenly entered the moving train and robbed the passengers of their jewellery by threatening them before getting down the train in a trice.\nAfter being alerted, Station Ghanpur ACP Bhim Sharma, along with the Kazipet railway police, rushed to the Kazipet railway station where the train was halted and enquired with the passengers about the incident.\nSome passengers told the police that some masked men suddenly appeared outside of the windows of the train and began snatching the gold ornaments from the passengers through windows while some others entered other compartments to rob the passengers. Though they shouted for help, no one dared to get off the train to catch hold of the robbers, the passengers said.\nKazipet railway inspector Moinuddin said that they received a complaint from only one passenger complaining that her gold ornaments of 20 tolas were robbed on the train between Nashkal and Pendiyal stations.\nAs the passengers were not sure, there is no clarity about the exact number of persons indulged in the train robbery, the inspector said.\nHe also said the trains were forced to slow down due to ongoing construction works on a bridge between the Nashkal and Pendiyal railway stations, which helped the robbers get into the moving train.\nPolice registered a case and the investigation was under way, said the officer.\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )",

    "text": "Trump wants local police help on deportations. GOP sheriff candidates: Not in Miami-Dade Published in [Political News](/politics/politicalnews/) MIAMI — Former President Donald Trump says he wants to use local law enforcement to carry out “the largest deportation operation in American history.” Republicans running to become Miami-Dade County’s sheriff say they don’t want to help with that. In interviews with the Miami Herald, many candidates — including the Republican endorsed by Trump — balked at the notion of using local police to identify and apprehend the estimated tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants who call Miami-Dade County home. They argued that doing so would erode the community’s trust in law enforcement and pull officers away from their ultimate mission of ensuring public safety. “As far as I’m concerned, if the law stays the way it is, immigration stays in their lane and I stay in mine,” said John Rivera, a former longtime police union boss who’s now running for sheriff. Another Republican candidate, Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Joe Sanchez, was even more blunt: “We’re not going to help the president on that one.” Trump’s campaign pledge to launch an immigration crackdown comes as Miami-Dade prepares to elect a sheriff for the first time in decades, forced by a change in Florida’s Constitution. Currently, the county’s Democratic mayor, Daniella Levine Cava, oversees the Miami-Dade Police Department, which would become the county Sheriff’s Office in 2025. Florida rules also require partisan elections for sheriff, meaning Republican and Democratic voters will select their nominee for sheriff in the Aug. 20 primaries. Despite the partisan incentive of Republican candidates to align themselves with Trump, there’s a divide over immigration enforcement between the presumptive GOP nominee and Miami-Dade’s GOP sheriff candidates. The gap underscores a key challenge that a second Trump administration could face in carrying out his mass deportation plan, even in friendly jurisdictions. The former president has repeatedly suggested deputizing local law enforcement agencies, the National Guard and even the U.S. military, if necessary, to remove the roughly 11 million undocumented people living in the United States. But he has said little about how he would secure cooperation from local and state agencies that might be reluctant to participate in such an operation. Trump suggested in a recent Time Magazine interview that he could use financial incentives to get local law enforcement on board with his plan, though he declined to outline specifics. “We’re going to be using local police, because local police know them by name, by first name, second name, and third name,” Trump told Time. “I mean, they know them very well.” A spokesperson for Trump’s campaign did not respond to the Miami Herald’s request for comment on how he sees the role of local law enforcement in carrying out his mass-deportation promises. ...continued ©2024 Miami Herald.

    "text": "I truly believe and fear should Donald J. Trump win the election in November, the Supreme court will be in play. A new round of ignoble judges will sit on the high court to do Trump’s bidding. I fear Social Security, Medicaid, and Voting Rights will be in serious peril, in short, they would be eliminated. Project 2025 envisions big changes across the government, and the role of federal agencies. Project 2025 would eliminate the Department of Commerce, Department of Education, Federal Communications Commission and would eliminate the heart of the Affordable Care Act’s coverage of emergency contraception. Project 2025 would advise the president (Donald Trump) to immediately direct the Department of Justice to pursue Donald Trump’s adversaries by invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807. It has been reported by Axios that the Heritage Foundation has briefed other 2024 Republican presidential candidates on the project. Many of the authors of Project 2025 are members of the first Trump administration and these people are diehard Trump loyalist. Donald Trump’s plans for a second term includes giving the president unchecked power over federal agencies and the ability to bypass the Congress. I will close with a quote from the beloved poet Maya Angelou: “Once you find the truth you ought to be prepared to stand on the street corner and use all your gifts to right the wrong.”—Maya Angelou The ignoble Donald Trump once said, “If you’re a star you can grab a woman by the pussy.” That is the day I became a Never Trumper!

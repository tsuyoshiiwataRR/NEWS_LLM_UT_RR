    "text": "China on Thursday lodged a protest with India against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s response to a congratulatory message from the Taiwanese President following the Lok Sabha elections.“China has always firmly opposed any form of official interaction between the Taiwan regional authorities and countries that have diplomatic relations with China,” Chinese Foreign Office spokesperson Mao Ning said on Thursday, indirectly chiding India’s move.“There is only one China in the world. India has made serious political commitments regarding the one-China principle and should be vigilant against the political schemes of the Taiwan authorities and refrain from actions that violate the one-China principle,” Mao said.President of Taiwan, Lai Ching-te, was among the leaders who congratulated Modi following BJP-led NDA’s third victory at the elections.“We look forward to enhancing the fast-growing #Taiwan-#India partnership, expanding our collaboration on trade, technology & other sectors to contribute to peace & prosperity in the #IndoPacific,” he wrote on X.Modi replied and thanked Lai for his “warm message”. “I look forward to closer ties as we work towards mutually beneficial economic and technological partnerships,” the Indian prime minister added.Interestingly, the Chinese President is the only P-5 leader who is either yet to call or send a congratulatory message to Modi. The message was delivered by the Chinese envoy to New Delhi.“Congratulations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP and BJP-led NDA on the victory in the Lok Sabha election. Look forward to making joint efforts with the Indian side for a sound and stable China-India relationship, which is in line with the interests and expectations of both countries, the region and the world,” Xu Feihong, China’s ambassador to India, posted on X.However, on Thursday, Xu complained about lack of Chinese cars in the Indian capital. He wrote on X, “So many Japanese, Korean, American and German cars on #Delhi streets! Can’t help but think: should all major car exporting countries be blamed for “overcapacity”? If not, why China’s export of new energy vehicles is labelled “overcapacity”? America is a big exporter of soyabeans, chips, and Boeing planes. Why it’s not “overcapacity”? Isn’t that naked double standards? Trade is about exchange of one’s quality products to make life better for the other side. If that means “overcapacity”, shall we end trade around the world?”",

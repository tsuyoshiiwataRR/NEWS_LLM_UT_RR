    "text": "The Biden campaign claimed that former President Donald Trump has &quot;confirmed&quot; plans to jail political opponents if elected. NY Post composite / istock/ Gett Diary of disturbing disinformation and dangerous delusions This tweet: Biden-Harris campaign statement on convicted felon Donald Trump confirming his Project 2025 plan to jail his opponents pic.twitter.com/j9ELJI1J6D — Biden-Harris HQ (@BidenHQ) June 5, 2024 We say: Sorry, Biden-Harris. Trump explicitly said claims he’d seek revenge on political foes are “wrong” and that the lawfare game “has to stop,” or “we’re not going to have a country.” Still, you have to marvel at Team Biden’s cojones in (falsely) warning that Trump will do precisely what Democrats have been doing to him. Exhibit A? The bogus felony conviction against him that was 1,000% politically motivated. Spot the difference #1: “I’ve done all I can do [to fix the border].” — President Biden, Jan. 30 vs. “I’m . . . using the executive authorities available to me as president . . . to address the border.” — Biden, Tuesday We say: What a difference a nearing election and sinking poll numbers make. For years, Biden claimed he had no power to fix the border (though he somehow had the power to break it the second he took office, by ditching key measures Trump put in place). Now that a whopping 70% of voters flunk him on the border issue, per a Fox News poll, he’s suddenly discovering “executive authorities” that were actually available to him all along. Still, don’t be fooled: Even his belated actions now are a sham that won’t end the crisis. Spot the difference #2: — NPR Public Editor (@NPRpubliceditor) October 22, 2020 vs. “Hunter Biden’s Laptop Makes a Brief Appearance at His Trial” — The New York Times, Wednesday We say: Almost without exception, mainstream news outlets — on the eve of the 2020 election — dismissed The Post’s famous scoop on Hunter Biden’s incriminating laptop as “Russian disinformation.” Yet now that Joe Biden’s own Justice Department has introduced the laptop as evidence in Hunter’s gun trial, outlets are readily discussing the story as if they’d never denied it at all. This charge: “They were . . . being racist as hell to Alvin Bragg.” — Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY), Saturday We say:What was “racist” about the criticism of Bragg? Even many on the left (CNN commentators, ex-Gov. David Paterson, etc.) have questioned the weakness of Bragg’s case and said they’d have acquitted Trump due to a lack of evidence. Radicals like Bowman really need to find some other card to play besides race. It’s gotten beyond boring. Compiled by The Post Editorial Board",

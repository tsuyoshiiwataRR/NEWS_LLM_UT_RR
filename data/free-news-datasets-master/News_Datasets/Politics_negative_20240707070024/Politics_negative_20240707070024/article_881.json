    "text": "Thursday, June 6th 2024, 5:02 pm State lawmakers are putting pressure on the State Department of Education. House Republicans served State Superintendent Ryan Walters with two subpoenas. Meanwhile, House Democrats are calling for Walters to be impeached. News 9’s Capitol Reporter Haley Weger sat down with Walters to get his response. There are dozens of questions being raised over federal grant funding for Oklahoma schools, contracts of high-paid employees at the State Department of Education, and whether or not Walters has violated state law. There have also been requests kicked up to the Attorney General. Representative Mark McBride (R-Moore), asked AG Gentner Drummond to investigate the employment status of Matt Langston, Walters' Senior Advisor for the administration. In a letter to the AG, Langston was referred to as a possible “ghost employee.” The State Superintendent denied any wrongdoing Thursday, saying if the AG did investigate, he wouldn't find anything out of the ordinary, calling the recent moves an \"attack.\" Walters had much more to say about McBride's accusations. News 9 will have updates on Friday, plus a response from McBride himself. June 6th, 2024 June 6th, 2024",

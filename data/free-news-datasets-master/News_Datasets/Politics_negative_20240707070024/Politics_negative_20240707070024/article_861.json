    "text": "by Paul Craig Roberts, Paul Craig Roberts :\nDay by day it is becoming more difficult and more risky to provide information that differs from the official narratives. Websites are finding that payment mechanisms, such as PayPal and Stripe, and banks refuse to process donations to their sites. Others, such as Vdare are being driven into bankruptcy by quota hire NY prosecutors. Alex Jones’ operation is again under assault. Tucker Carlson was driven from Fox News. Google increasingly hides unwelcome information.\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\nAnd now we witness a former US Marine, intelligence officer, and UN weapons inspector pulled off an international flight and his passport stolen by police “on orders by the US Department of State.” Scott Ritter was on his way to Russia to speak at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.\nRitter is an active source of what the conflict in Ukraine is really about and how it is widening into a wider and more dangerous conflict. Being yanked off a flight and his passport taken is the Biden regime’s way of sending him a message to get onboard with the narrative.\nNote that the State Department’s orders to the police are unconstitutional and probably illegal. The First Amendment to the US Constitution protects freedom of speech, press, and assembly and the Fourth Amendment prevents unreasonable searches and seizures. It has become a hallmark of the US government to act as it pleases regardless of the US Constitution. The Constitution stands as a barrier to weaponized law. Therefore, the Constitution is ignored.\nIn today’s America coercion rules not only from government but also from corporations, universities, public schools, media, foundations such as Clooney’s which has undertaken the suppression of those who provide truthful accounts on the Russian front. Use the wrong pronoun, refuse to take the Covid vax, promote too many white people and your employer fires you. Universities and public schools are anti-white indoctrination centers. Parents who complain at school board meetings about their kids being taught that they are racists and born into the wrong body are put on FBI watch lists. Trump supporters who attended a rally are imprisoned as “insurrectionists.” The media protects official lies by demonizing truth-tellers. Attorneys are becoming afraid to defend a demonized defendant. The message has been delivered loud and clear that a person’s success depends on his support for the official narratives. We have reached the point where speaking the truth is beginning to be criminalized.\nIt is certainly the case that telling the truth and providing analysis based on facts is no way to make a living. Indeed, it marginalizes you. I used to write editorials for the Wall Street Journal and had a prominent column. Today my former newspaper is off limits to me, as is the rest of the TV and print media. Matt Taibbi, Glenn Greenwald, Chris Hedges, Tucker Carlson have been exiled from official media.\nRead More @ PaulCraigRoberts.org",

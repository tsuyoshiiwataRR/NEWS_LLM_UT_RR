    "text": "SEOUL, South Korea — In the spring of 2018, not long after North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un declared that his country was in the \"final stage\" of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the United States, then-South Korean President Moon Jae-in set out to play peacemaker.\nWhen the two men met for the first time that April, Moon found Kim softer than his reputation suggested.\n\"Intelligence or media reports portrayed him as an oppressive dictator and an imperious personality, but the Chairman Kim I met had a completely different demeanor,\" Moon writes in a recently released memoir. \"He was very polite.

He was asked what he says to himself when the crowds aren’t cheering, and about his “hardest, darkest moment”.\nIn a separate interview with Fox News , Mr Trump downplayed the threat of climate change , insisting that international unrest is of greater concern and declaring: “The only global warming that matters to me is nuclear global warming.”\nThe Republican presidential candidate and convicted felon maintained that, while he remained a “very legitimate” candidate for the White House, the US had become a “banana republic”.\nMeanwhile, the judge in the classified documents case in Florida will allow several parties not involved in the case to argue in favor of the former president’s attempt to dismiss the charges brought against him by special counsel Jack Smith .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

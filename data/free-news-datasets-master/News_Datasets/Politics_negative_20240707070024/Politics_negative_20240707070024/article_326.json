    "text": "Congress party has claimed despite manipulated delimitation exercise of last year, Congress won three seats in Assam in the parliamentary polls. The Assam government has decided to start the delimitation exercise of the panchayat and hold an election by November this year.The political landscape of Assam stands changed after almost 27 years as the Election commission of India has published the Delimitation of assembly and parliamentary constituencies last year. Recently concluded Lok Sabha polls was the first election held under the delimited constituencies.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that delimitation exercise will ensure that one panchayat does not fall in two assembly constituencies. BJP also plans to hold thanksgiving in each panchayat area.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh has stated on X, “Inspite of the manipulated delimitation exercise in Assam, the Indian National Congress retained three MP seats. In Spite of the CM's best efforts to suppress the Congress, it received 37.48% of the vote in Assam, almost double its previous vote share and surpassing the BJP's 37.43% vote share. @pradyutbordoloi’s margin increased by nearly 2 lakh votes. In Spite of the 25 public meetings held by the Assam Chief Minister to defeat @GauravGogoiAsm, he won with a 1 lakh margin. In Spite of the BJP's best efforts to prop up Badruddin Ajmal, @rakibul_inc swept Dhubri Lok Sabha with a historic margin. Time to go Mukhya Mantri! The countdown to Himanta Biswa Sarma’s exit has begun.”BJP in Assam had hailed the delimitation exercise and Sarma had remarked that the strongest act was delimitation exercises for saving the political future of Assamese people.Congress’s Gaurav Gogoi changed his constituency post delimitation exercise won from Jorhat. His earlier constituency Koliabor ceased to exist, and a new constituency was created Kaziranga following delimitation of constituencies. Congress retained the Nagaon seat, it wrested the Dhubri seat. Badruddin Ajmal of AIUDF bore the brunt of anti-incumbency, he was winning the seat since 2009. BJP’s ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) won the Barpeta seat. AGP is back in Lok Sabha after 2009. Another BJP’s ally United People's Party Liberal (UPPL) won the Kokrajhar seat. BJP had contested 11 seats in Assam leaving three for its allies. Barpeta seat became Hindu majority post delimitation exercise.",

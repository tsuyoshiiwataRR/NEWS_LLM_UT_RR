    "text": "'Have Some Standards': 50 Cent Slammed for Taking White House Photo With Republican Representative Lauren Boebert [50 Cent](https://okmagazine.com/t/50-cent/) faced [ backlash](https://okmagazine.com/p/lauren-boebert-mocked-donald-trump-praying-not-sleeping/) after posing for a photo with [Republican representative](https://okmagazine.com/p/marjorie-taylor-greene-calls-lauren-boebert-little-b-house-floor/) and MAGA enthusiast [Lauren Boebert](https://okmagazine.com/t/lauren-boebert/) during a recent visit to the White House. The rapper — born Curtis Jackson — wore a dark blue suit with a matching tie while Boebert sported a knee-length black dress. \"Lauren Boebert, Colorado Republican making the white house look good,\" he captioned the snapshot, punctuating it with a winking emoji. Followers quickly flooded the comments section [with criticism](https://okmagazine.com/p/50-cent-full-custody-son-baby-mama-daphne-joy-sean-diddy-combs/) for the \"In Da Club\" artist. One user replied, \"Eww. Have [some standards](https://okmagazine.com/p/lauren-boebert-son-arrested-vehicle-trespass-property-thefts/), Curt,\" and a second said, \"Her making anything look good is an impossibility. You actually have to accomplish something of value first.\" A third person commented, \"You [disappoint](https://okmagazine.com/p/lauren-boebert-slammed-joe-biden-joke-quiet-republican-lady/) me, Curtis. Got a taste of that MAGAt money, didn't you? Sold out your principles. You're now a member of traitors and terrorists. History will no longer remember you for your music. You'll be remembered for this.\" 50 Cent later wrote a follow-up post explaining that he wasn't specifically there to see Boebert.

Hey I don't have chlamydia by the way. LOL.\" One X user chimed in, \"My favorite part about this is that 50 Cent is at best implying that @laurenboebert has chlamydia to share in the first place.\" This isn't the first time 50 Cent has been under fire for his controversial [political posts](https://okmagazine.com/p/50-cent-slammed-fans-donald-trump-is-answer-ahead-2024-election/). As OK! previously reported, he penned a message that said \"Maybe [[Donald] Trump](https://okmagazine.com/t/donald-trump/) is the answer.\" A critic responded, \"That Trump s--- isn’t funny. He’s set black people back decades already just with his Supreme Court picks.\" Never miss a story — sign up for the [OK!](https://okmagazine.com/newsletter-signup/) newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what OK! has to offer. It’s gossip too good to wait for!

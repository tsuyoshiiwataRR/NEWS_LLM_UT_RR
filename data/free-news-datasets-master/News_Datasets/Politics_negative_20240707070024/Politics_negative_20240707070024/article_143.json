    "text": "ALBUQUERQUE—Congresswoman released the following statement after President Biden’s call for an end to the war in Israel and Gaza:\n\"I am deeply horrified by and I unequivocally condemn the attacks on civilians in Rafah over the last several days.\nPrime Minister Netanyahu and his military leadership have shown a blatant disregard for civilian life and have clearly and repeatedly crossed the red line. Further incursions into Rafah must stop immediately.\nEscalation is a clear violation of human rights, in addition to the continued blockage of humanitarian aid to civilians in need of food, water, and medicine. Desperately needed aid must be allowed to pass.\nI continue to call for an immediate ceasefire and the safe return of all hostages who remain in danger.\nWeapons made and supplied by the U.S. absolutely should not be deployed to support offensive incursions that harm civilians.\nThis war must end.\nWhich is why, I continue to call on our President to use every tool available to help end this conflict before more lives are taken and the region is further destabilized.”\n###",

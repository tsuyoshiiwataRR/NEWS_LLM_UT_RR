    "text": "Inspector-General of Police Olukayode Egbetokun has been urged by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to swiftly work on arresting and prosecuting Hudu Yunusa-Ari, the suspended INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in Adamawa, according to the national publicity secretary of PDP, Debo Ologunagba. The call was made during a news conference held on Thursday in Abuja. Ologunagba emphasized the importance of adhering to a court order by apprehending and prosecuting Yunusa-Yari.\nYunusa-Ari faced suspension due to his actions of trying to take over the powers of the state returning officer by declaring the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Aishatu Binani, as the winner of the April 15, 2023 Adamawa governorship election, even though the election results compilation was not complete at that time.\nOlogunagba condemned this move as a civilian coup and an assault on Nigeria’s constitutional democracy.\nA warrant of arrest against Yunusa-Ari was issued by the High Court of Justice of Adamawa State, No. 9, Yola Division, dated May 21, 2024, directing the IGP to apprehend and present Yunusa-Ari before the court to face the charges against him. The IGP’s office received the court order on May 23.\nDespite his removal, Yunusa-Ari has been evading arrest, not recognizing that “time does not run against the state in criminal matters,” as stated by Ologunagba. The delay in prosecuting Yunusa-Ari was highlighted as a significant threat to Nigeria’s democracy and the rule of law.\nPDP emphasized the importance of the prompt apprehension and diligent prosecution of Yunusa-Ari to prevent setting a wrong precedent and fostering impunity among public officers. The Inspector-General of Police was urged to act promptly in accordance with the court order to arrest Yunusa-Ari and bring him to face prosecution.\nThere were concerns that Yunusa-Ari might attempt to flee the country to evade trial, hence the urgency in bringing him to justice, said Ologunagba. PDP stood firm on holding Yunusa-Ari accountable for his actions against democracy.",

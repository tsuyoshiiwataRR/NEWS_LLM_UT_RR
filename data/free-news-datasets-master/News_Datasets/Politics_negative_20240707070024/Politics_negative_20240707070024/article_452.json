    "text": "In 2020, the Democrats, media and Big Tech engaged in massive election interference by denying the authenticity of Hunter Biden's laptop and its contents while saying the Right was pushing Russian disinformation. Ironically, the Left accusing the Right of pushing a disinformation campaign was itself a disinformation campaign.\nThe FBI has testified at Hunter Biden's trial that the laptop is the real deal, even though the Democrats, much of the media and Big Tech spent the weeks leading up to the election\npushing the \"Russian disinformation\" spin.\nFrom the\nNew York Post:\nFor the first time Tuesday, first son Hunter Biden’s notorious “laptop from hell” — whose scandalous contents were first reported by The Post nearly four years ago — was shown to a jury of his peers, with federal prosecutors making it a key part of their case accusing the president’s child of illegally owning a gun while addicted to drugs.\nThe pivotal moment unfolded after prosecutor Derek Hines brought out a plastic-wrapped laptop, walked it across the courtroom and presented it to his first witness, FBI Special Agent Erika Jensen.\nJensen took the MacBook Pro 13 and verified — after looking at the serial number on the back — that it had, in fact, belonged to President Biden’s son.\nNone of the 51 former intelligence community officials who signed the letter calling stories about the laptop a likely Russian disinformation campaign will apologize now because the media won't ask them about it. Cable news outlets will continue interviewing people like John Brennan and James Clapper to get their \"expert\" insights even though they're proven liars (a job requirement at some media outlets).\nWe can count on congressional Democrats to be even more shameless. Dem Rep. Dan Goldman is taking the approach of pretending the original narrative still holds water. Shameless, but not unexpected:\nThis is not complicated. The FBI has Hunter’s laptop. Giuliani received a hard drive copy of the laptop, which he turned over only to the NY Post.— Daniel Goldman (@danielsgoldman)\nHard drives can be manipulated. While the hard drive has some authentic docs, no forensic analysis has found it all to be authentic.\n[June 6, 2024]\nGiuliani was colluding with Russian spies after he got the hard drive. He refused to give a copy of the hard drive to any media outlet other than the NY Post. The reporter testified that the Post never conducted a forensic analysis of the hard drive.— Daniel Goldman (@danielsgoldman)\n[June 6, 2024]\nYou have to almost begrudgingly admire Goldman's commitment to shoveling the BS even in the face of reality. Wrong at every single turn:\nwrong— Andrew Kerr (@AndrewKerrNC)\n“My analysis revealed there is a 100% certainty that Robert Hunter Biden was the only person responsible for the activity on this hard drive and all of its stored data\" -- Gus Dimitrelos, former Secret Service agent and cyberforensics expert.\n [pic.twitter.com/PfPsUkurft] [June 6, 2024]\nWe called the people on the emails we reported.— Emma-Jo Morris (@EmmaJoNYC)\n [June 6, 2024]\nMaybe these Dems are just baffled when they see actual journalism performed and aren't sure what to make of it.\nI had to check the date on this deluded narrative.— LincolnHillsFrau (@bayareahausfrau)\nAre you saying that the FBI does not have the expertise to authenticate the laptop? That copies of emails and texts on the laptop are corroborated by the recipients of those same emails and texts are all fakes? That the laptop…\n [June 6, 2024]\nIn fairness to Goldman, he doesn't appear to be that bright.\nThe ratio here is awesome but why does he continue to do this?— Max Diesel (@MaxDieselRI)\n [June 6, 2024]\nYou lied to try and change the outcome of an election. Thank you for setting the precedent, now you can be investigated?— Brandon S (@BSaarX)\n [June 6, 2024]\nThe real headline is \"Dems colluded with media and Big Tech to interfere in the 2020 election\" but Goldman will never admit that. He'd rather just keep making a fool out of himself.",

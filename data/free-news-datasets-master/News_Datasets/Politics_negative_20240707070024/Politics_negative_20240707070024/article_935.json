    "text": "Approximately zero people on the Republican side of the aisle were surprised when the worst president in the history of the United States — AKA Joe Biden — did a 180 on his claim that he couldn't \"close\" the southern border without congressional legislation yet signed an Executive Order claiming to do just that. Was Biden lying when he [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/06/04/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-secure-the-border/) the order? Were his lips moving? Then, yes, he was lying.

We're talking about a guy here who should be charged with treason, in my not-so-humble opinion. Related: [Mayorkas Goes Full Stand-Up Comic, Claims 'We've Done an Extraordinary Job Dealing With Immigration'](https://redstate.com/mike_miller/2024/05/29/mayorkas-goes-full-stand-up-comic-says-weve-done-an-extraordinary-job-dealing-with-immigration-n2174796) So [here's the deal](https://justthenews.com/government/security/bidens-border-order-contains-exceptions-allow-illegal-migrants-us-mayorkas-will) with Biden's order, in part (emphasis, mine): The Executive Order issued Tuesday states that the border will close down the day after the Homeland Security secretary determined that illegal immigrant encounters at the border hit 2,500 or more for seven consecutive calendar days. The border would re-open two weeks after the secretary determines that there has been an average of less than 1,500 encounters for seven days in a row. It is unclear how this average would be determined if the border is already shut down. There are notable exceptions as to what is considered a U.S. Customs and Border Protection encounter that would count toward the 2,500 maximum. Yes, \"notable exceptions\" with respect to what's considered an \"encounter\" in Biden's deceitful smoke-and-mirrors order. Check it out: An \"encounter\" only refers to a person who is \"physically apprehended by CBP immigration officers within 100 miles\" of the southwest border within 14 days of entering the U.S. \"between points of entry,\" according to the order. An \"encounter\" also refers to a person who \"is determined to be inadmissible at a southwest land border,\" the order states. This means that an illegal immigrant in a city outside of the 100-mile zone, such as San Antonio, would not be considered an \"encounter\" for the purposes of the 2,500-person total, nor would an illegal immigrant found within the 100-mile boundary more than two weeks after they entered the U.S. A person who approaches the southern border and is determined to be admissible may not be considered as an encounter. Insane? Yes. And meant to deceive low-information voters and provide liberal media sock puppets with worse-than-hollow talking points for the sole purpose of defending embattled Biden? Of course. In addition, it's unclear how an illegal alien would be able to prove if he or she entered the country more than 14 days prior to an \"official\" encounter. That said, why do I think illegals will be taught exactly how to \"prove it?\" It gets worse. A wide range of illegals will still be allowed into the country, despite Biden's order, even after the border is \"closed\" — and won't count toward the 2,500 average required to shut down the border. Exceptions will include unaccompanied minors and victims of \" [a severe form of trafficking,](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/7102)\" such as those subjected to sex trafficking or slavery. Moreover, Biden's order doesn't specify how such determinations would be made. I'll go out on a safe limb at bet the discretion will rest with the deceitful Homeland Security secretary. Mayorkas's power will only grow. As if Mayorkas doesn't already have enough power — which he not only has thoroughly corrupted, but he also indignantly doesn't give a damn who likes it or not — Biden's order gives him even more. In addition to allowing broad categories of people to come into the U.S., the order gives the Homeland Security secretary, in this case, Mayorkas, the comprehensive authority to make decisions about who comes in. For example, the order states that illegal immigrants may be allowed into the U.S. if they arrive at a port of entry along the border \"pursuant to a process the Secretary of Homeland Security determines is appropriate.\" It is unclear what process the secretary would deem acceptable under these terms. The order includes additional exceptions allowing illegal immigrants to enter if a CBP officer, acting on behalf of the DHS secretary, permits them to enter \"based on the totality of the circumstances.\" It is also unclear what this means or when this exception would go into effect. Shocked? Me, neither. The Bottom Line Does anyone on the planet think Alejandro Mayorkas is going to experience a miraculous transformation in response to Biden's dishonest order and start making decisions based on the best interests of the security of the United States? Hell no, he won't —Mayorkas will undoubtedly abuse the powers of his office even further as he continues to import as many illegal aliens into the country as he can get away with. But now, he will do so by the authority of a Biden Executive Order that has no intention of stopping the insanity.

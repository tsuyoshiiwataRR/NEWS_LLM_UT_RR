    "text": "In short: Donald Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon has been ordered to report to prison by July 1 to serve a four-month sentence for contempt of US Congress. Bannon was convicted for rejecting a subpoena from a congressional panel that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. What's next? A federal judge said Bannon's appeal no longer raises substantial questions of the law and there was no more justification to keep him free. Steve Bannon, a former top adviser to Donald Trump, must report to prison by July 1 to serve a four-month sentence for contempt of US Congress, a federal judge has ruled.\nThe decision means Bannon, a right-wing media firebrand who maintains influence in Trump's orbit, will likely be behind bars for a critical stretch of the US presidential campaign.\nThe order by US District Judge Carl Nichols came after a federal appeals court last month rejected Bannon's bid to overturn his conviction for rejecting a subpoena from a congressional panel that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\nBannon told reporters outside the courthouse he would ask the US Supreme Court to intervene, casting his prosecution as politically motivated.\n\"All this is about one thing: shutting down the MAGA movement,\" Bannon said, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again campaign slogan.\nA congressional panel said Steve Bannon may have had knowledge of events planned for the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. ( Reuters: Shannon Stapleton )\nBannon was convicted in 2022 of two misdemeanour counts of contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over documents or testify to the Democratic-led House of Representatives committee.\nHe will be the second former top official from Trump's White House to go to prison for refusing to cooperate with the committee. Peter Navarro, a former trade adviser, is currently serving a four-month term.\nBannon was allowed to avoid serving the sentence during his appeal. Prosecutors moved to end that reprieve after a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rebuffed Bannon's challenge to his conviction.\nFormer Trump adviser describes January 6 probe as 'show trial' Steve Bannon's lawyer is questioning potential jurors about how much of the January 6 hearings they have watched and whether they have opinions about the committee and its work.\nRead more\nBannon's lawyers urged Judge Nichols to keep him free, arguing he could still appeal to the full DC Circuit Court or the US Supreme Court.\nBannon has argued that he was advised by his lawyer that he did not have to comply with the subpoena and therefore did not intend to commit a crime.\nBut Judge Nichols said after the appeals court's ruling, there was no longer justification to keep Bannon free.\n\"I can no longer conclude that his appeal raises substantial questions of law likely to overturn his conviction,\" the judge said.\nBannon, who no longer worked in the White House at the time, was part of a group of advisers to Trump who sought to derail formal certification of President Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election.\nThe congressional panel said he may have had knowledge of events planned for January 6, 2021, when a group of Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a failed bid to stop politicians from certifying the vote.\nReuters\nPosted 3h ago 3 hours ago Thu 6 Jun 2024 at 9:12pm Share\nCopy link\nFacebook\nX (formerly Twitter)\nRelated Stories Steve Bannon sentenced to four months in prison for refusing to testify at January 6 hearings Jury selection gets underway ahead of former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's trial",

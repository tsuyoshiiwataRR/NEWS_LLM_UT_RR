    "text": "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs illegally appointed ‚Äòde facto‚Äô agency directors, judge rules Jun 6, 2024, 11:56 AM | Updated: 11:57 am (File Photo by Rebecca Noble/Getty Images) PHOENIX ‚Äì An Arizona judge ruled Wednesday that Gov. Katie Hobbs illegally appointed ‚Äúde facto‚Äù agency directors while sidestepping opposition to her nominees by state Senate Republicans. Hobbs didn‚Äôt have the authority to install ‚Äúdeputy directors‚Äù to lead 13 state agencies after multiple picks were rejected by the Senate Committee on Director Nominations following often-contentious hearings, [according to the ruling](https://www.scribd.com/document/739949622/Under-Advisement-Ruling-Arizona-State-Senate-v-Katie-Hobbs). Senate President Warren Petersen created the vetting committee about a month after Arizona‚Äôs first Democratic governor since 2009 took office in early 2023. As a result, Hobbs‚Äô director nominees couldn‚Äôt go to the full Senate for a confirmation vote without approval from the committee, which is chaired by Sen. Jake Hoffman. [Under state law](https://www.azleg.gov/ars/38/00211.htm), the governor‚Äôs nominees can‚Äôt serve as director for more than a year without Senate confirmation. How did Gov. Hobbs bypass Senate confirmation for nominees? In September 2023, a frustrated Hobbs [said she was withdrawing](https://ktar.com/story/5541341/arizona-gov-katie-hobbs-pulls-remaining-director-nominations-cites-partisan-obstructionism/) her nominees from the 13 remaining director vacancies to ‚Äúpursue other lawful avenues‚Äù for filling the leadership roles in the following departments, commissions and offices: - Administration - Economic Security - Environmental Quality - AHCCCS Administration - Child Safety - Gaming - Housing - Insurance and Financial Institutions - Veterans‚Äô Services - State Land - State Lottery Commission - Residential Utility Consumer Office - Office of Tourism Hobbs went on to name an interim director to each agency. The interim then appointed an executive deputy director and resigned, leaving the deputy in charge. However, the GOP-led Senate [filed a lawsuit](https://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/docket/CivilCourtCases/caseInfo.asp?caseNumber=CV2023-019899) in December 2023 challenging the maneuver. Why did judge rule that Gov. Hobbs illegally appointed directors? On Wednesday, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Scott Blaney ruled in favor of the Senate, saying Hobbs ‚Äúhas improperly, unilaterally appointed ‚Äòde facto‚Äô directors for these 13 agencies, despite the actual job title she has assigned to them.‚Äù Blaney also wrote that Hobbs‚Äô ‚Äúfrustration with a co-equal branch of government ‚Äì even if that frustration was justified ‚Äì did not exempt her director nominees from Senate oversite.‚Äù Blaney didn‚Äôt issue relief to the Senate in Wednesday‚Äôs ruling, instead giving the parties a chance to settle their dispute. The judge said the court will set an evidentiary hearing or oral argument for late July or early August. ‚ÄúThis will give these co-equal branches of government an opportunity to meet and confer in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable resolution,‚Äù the ruling says. ‚ÄúIf they are unsuccessful, the Court will hold a brief hearing to consider the evidence and arguments regarding mandamus and injunctive relief.‚Äù How did Hobbs, Senate Republicans react to ruling Hobbs‚Äô office issued a statement vowing to appeal the decision. The statement took aim at Hoffman, who is under indictment in Arizona‚Äôs fake elector case. ‚ÄúArizonans want sanity, not the chaos of indicted fake elector Jake Hoffman‚Äôs sham committee that he abuses to force his radical political agenda on Arizonans,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúGov. Hobbs stands ready to work with anybody in the Senate who is serious about putting the political games aside and delivering for everyday Arizonans, and as she‚Äôs said from day one, she remains open to a fair and timely process for confirmation of nominees.‚Äù Senate Republicans, meanwhile, used Wednesday‚Äôs ruling to accuse Hobbs and her party of abusing their power. üö®FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Court Rules Katie Hobbs Violated State Law by Failing to Nominate Directors for Senate Confirmation Full Statement: [https://t.co/LxPcX2138z] [pic.twitter.com/1TnrlZMEj4] ‚Äî AZSenateRepublicans (@AZSenateGOP) [June 5, 2024] ‚ÄúThis case is a prime example of Democrats weaponizing Arizona‚Äôs government for their own political gain and to implement their radical left agenda,‚Äù Petersen, the Senate president, [said in a press release](https://www.azsenaterepublicans.gov/post/court-rules-katie-hobbs-violated-state-law-by-failing-to-nominate-directors-for-senate-confirmation). ‚ÄúUnfortunately, every decision made by these fake directors on behalf of our state agencies will be under a microscope, opening the door for a myriad of lawsuits.‚Äù For his part, Hoffman said he‚Äôs ready to resume confirmation hearings. ‚ÄúI look forward to continuing our confirmation hearings in the near future now that much needed clarity on the law has been provided by the courts to Hobbs and her staff,‚Äù Hoffman [said in a release](https://www.azsenaterepublicans.gov/post/senator-jake-hoffman-responds-to-court-ruling-on-katie-hobbs-unlawful-scheme-to-circumvent-senate-c). ‚ÄúIf Katie wishes to continue her petulant insults against me and to play petty political games, so be it; but I‚Äôm going to continue faithfully fulfilling my duty to the people of this great state to ensure that we have a sane government that works for every Arizonan.‚Äù We want to hear from you.

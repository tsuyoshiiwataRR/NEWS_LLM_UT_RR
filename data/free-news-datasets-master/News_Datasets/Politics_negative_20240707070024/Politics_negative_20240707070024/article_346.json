    "text": "In Manhattan Criminal Court, for six weeks “both sides” (prosecution and defense) went at it. The jury’s political predilections spanned a wide spectrum (and, yes, represented “both sides” thereof). Still, it UNANIMOUSLY found the hush money mogul GUILTY ON SOME 34 COUNTS. Such diligence needs to be extended. This fall, what’s sauce for the jury box (12-0) should prove sauce for the ballot boxes (say, 180 million to a big, fat goose egg). At the end of the day, let’s face it. If we can’t send a bloated-yet-hardened, prolific, freewheeling felon packing (to the point of donning an orange suit to coordinate with his not-found-in-nature dermis), when can we hope to start to make America freestanding again (as opposed to crassly-and-criminally Trumped)? When we let it, history speaks volumes. For decades, tyranny, thy name has been GOP. Lest we forget: a half-century ago, we the people lay in thrall to tuskers Richard “Tricky Dickie” Nixon (R), and his effectively hand-picked successor/savior, Gerald ‘Pardon Me’ Ford (R). Caught red-handed obstructing justice, evading taxes, and presaging the current, querulous quack from Queens, Nixon resigned the office he’d so vilely degraded. Alas, our reactions were not unanimous. Even before Lynyrd Skynyrd snarked “Now, Watergate does not bother me,” one could hear diehard Nixonites/future Trump cultists yawping those self-same words. (Sad.) For their part, “liberal” institutionalists chirped “the [legal] system worked.” If only. In truth, what functioned in the face of GOPers’ domestic despotism was Nixon’s self-inflicted, smoking gun-blasted wound: by sheer fluke and hubristic folly, he caught himself in the act (on audiotape). Even then, he refused to fork over the recordings; if you can believe it, a UNANIMOUS Supreme Court (featuring decent, pro-democracy Justices from, you guessed it, BOTH SIDES) declined to let him get away with shredding our rule of law. But still. Life under the specter of Presidential impunity went on. Better late than never, let’s toss the triple cheese whopper that Ford was anything but a vehicle for King Richard I. By enabling Nixon to evade accountability, Ford did NOT end “our long national nightmare;” rather, he effectively institutionalized our collective somnolence to a point where so unscrupulous a usurper as Big Blonder could catch our flimsily guard railed power structure asleep, so to speak, at the wheel. So. Here we are- striving to avert deja coup (via the undead J6 juggernaut) all over again. In thrall to six rabidly elephantine ‘Justices,’ let’s take a moment to salute 1974’s unanimous, non-partisan, pro-USA SCOTUS. In their own way, let it be stressed, they presaged 2024’s open-minded, integrity-steeped New York jury- as an object lesson in how ANY non-seditious, truly American vote must be cast. For instance: President Biden over Yardbird Blowhard. Talk about a no-brainer! And yet STILL Big News (literally and otherwise) sandbags the former- and effectively calls the horse race even. (Go figure!) And now November looms. At bottom, it’s the criminality, stupid. In the pot is a six-times-bankrupt, parental pelf-made, word-slurring, licentious, megalomaniac flop. Born rich, he stoops to personal lawbreaking while openly vowing to become a Nixonian, Constitution-crushing “dictator?” Who does that??? In all honesty, from sea to sea (and from Waikiki to Wasilla) could there be many perps ANYWHERE less suited to preside over our elephant-stomped, Trump-ravaged domain? Sigh. If Dems can’t bring themselves to full-throatedly address that glaring, ghastly Hobson’s choice, history suggests that, starting 11/5, they may have no choice but to hold their piece till the cowed come home. (As Dan Rather used to sign off, “Courage.” For, crying out loud, the beloved country.)",

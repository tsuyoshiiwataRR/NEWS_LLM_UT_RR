    "text": "By Eugene Daniels ,\n1 hour ago Hunter Biden is facing three criminal counts of buying a gun while being under the influence of drugs and lying about it on an official form. | Kent Nishimura/AFP via Getty Images\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday ruled out the possibility of pardoning his son, Hunter Biden, if he is found guilty of illegally possessing a gun as the trial nears a verdict in Delaware.\nIn an interview commemorating the 80th anniversary of D-Day in France, the president told ABC’s David Muir that he would both accept the outcome of the trial and rule out using his pardon powers to intervene if his son is found guilty. Asked about each, Biden only answered with one word: “yes.”\nHunter Biden is facing three criminal counts of buying a gun while, at the time, being addicted to drugs and lying about it on an official form. Hunter has pleaded not guilty in the case.\nThree of Hunter Biden’s exes, including brother Beau Biden’s widow (whom Hunter also dated), have testified.\nProsecutors allege that Hallie Biden, Beau’s widow, found Hunter Biden’s gun and threw it away. On Thursday, she testified on the stand that Hunter was using drugs when he purchased the gun in October of 2018. She said she cleaned out his vehicle, and found a gun, drug paraphernalia and remnants of crack cocaine.\nPresident Biden has gone to great lengths to not give off the impression that he is interfering in the cases surrounding his son’s alleged misdeeds (Hunter Biden also faces charges that he failed to pay $1.4 million in taxes — which he has since repaid). On Monday, before the jury was chosen, the president issued a rare statement about the case.\n“I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,” the statement said. “Hunter’s resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us.\n“As the President, I don’t and won’t comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength,” Biden added.\nFirst lady Jill Biden, who is with Biden in France, joined Hunter Biden in court for the first three days of the trial.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Doha: The State of Qatar condemned in the strongest terms the storming of the courtyards of the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque by Israeli occupation government officials, members of the Knesset and settlers and the organisation of a march in the occupied Jerusalem under the protection of the occupation forces, as a flagrant violation of international law and the Hashemite custodianship of the holy sites in occupied Jerusalem.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned of the Israeli occupation government's escalating policy in the occupied Palestinian territories, and stressed that the concurrent attempts to undermine the religious and historical status of Al-Aqsa Mosque are not only an attack on the Palestinians but on millions of Muslims around the world.\nRead Also LIVE UPDATES: Israel carries out deadly strike inside UN school in Gaza The MOFA also warned of the consequences of continuing such violations against the Palestinian people and their Islamic and Christian sanctities, and the resulting expansion of the circle of violence, especially in light of the ongoing war on the Gaza Strip, urging the international community to take urgent action to stop these attacks.\nIt reiterated the State of Qatar's firm position on the justice of the Palestinian cause and the legitimate rights of the brotherly Palestinian people, including the full right to practice their religious rituals without restrictions, and to establish their independent state on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.",

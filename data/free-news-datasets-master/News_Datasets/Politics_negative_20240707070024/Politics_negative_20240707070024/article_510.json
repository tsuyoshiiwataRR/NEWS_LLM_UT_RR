    "text": "A blistering row has broken out in the Coalition on the eve of the elections, with calls from within the parties to rule out entering government together again.\nWith the European and Local election polls on Friday, long-standing tensions over Green policies are emerging once again.\nFianna Fáil TD James O’Connor has called on his party to make a pledge that it will not partner with the Greens again. While Green Party chair Pauline O’Reilly told the Irish Daily Mail that a spate of political attacks on their candidates from Coalition colleagues had ‘eroded trust’ and it is now ‘very difficult’ to see how they could share power again in a future government.\nGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan, who gave a stark warning to Cabinet colleagues on Wednesday on the devastating impacts of climate change in Ireland, warned that Fine Gael candidates elected to Brussels would try to halt environmental policies.\nFianna Fáil TD James O’Connor has called on his party to make a pledge that it will not partner with the Greens again. He raised concerns that the European People’s Party (EPP) grouping, of which Fine Gael is a member, would align themselves with anti-climate ‘nihilists’ in a bid to hold on to the balance of power in the European Parliament.\nHe said: ‘Will the EPP and Fine Gael, will they go with the right in stopping the Green Deal, which there’s every sign that they might well do?\nThe row follows an attack on the Greens by former Fine Gael minister and MEP candidate for Dublin, Regina Doherty, who told the Irish Mail on Sunday that there is a ‘need to combat the over-mighty Greens in Europe’.\nShe claimed that ‘the Greens currently are doing more harm than good to the climate change agenda’ and accused them of leading an ‘autocratic style of government’.\nThe comments were branded an ‘error of judgement’ on Wednesday, by Senator O’Reilly, a candidate in the Midlands-North-West constituency. She told the Mail: ‘They’re [Fine Gael and Fianna Fail] certainly making it difficult to work with them after the next election if you know that you can’t trust them.’\nGreen Party chair Pauline O’Reilly said that a spate of political attacks on their candidates from Coalition colleagues had ‘eroded trust’. Pic: Leon Farrell/RollingNews.ie She said they were trying to ‘pull the wool over voters’ eyes’ by distancing themselves ‘from decisions they were involved in’. Ms O’Reilly agreed that the prospect of a general election in the coming months is ‘a part of it’ and that the other Government parties are ‘gearing up’ for another election. She added: ‘They’re trying to abdicate all responsibility for decisions they’ve made… it is completely untrue to say people aren’t being brought with us on it and spreading misinformation about what’s happening.’\nMr Ryan also hit out at Ms Doherty on Wednesday, accusing her of seeking ‘political advantage’ by criticising climate change policies. Her rival in the race for the Dublin MEP seat, Green TD Ciarán Cuffe, had earlier accused her of rhetoric ‘going back 30 years, it’s living in the past’.\nMr Cuffe said: ‘People should be aware of the choice they face when they’re voting this Friday: climate chaos with Fine Gael or a liveable, safe future with the Greens.’\nGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan, who gave a stark warning to Cabinet colleagues on Wednesday on the devastating impacts of climate change in Ireland, warned that Fine Gael candidates elected to Brussels would try to halt environmental policies. Pic: Conor Ó Mearáin/Collins Photos Asked if he agreed with those comments, Mr Ryan said: ‘I think Ciarán is right.’\nFurther stoking the row, Fianna Fáil TD James O’Connor has called for his party to issue a pre-general election ‘firm line’ that they will not re-enter government with the Greens. He told the Mail: ‘In my view, doing businesses with the Greens for the last four years has been extremely difficult to stomach for the Fianna Fáil grassroots supporters.’\nThe row follows an attack on the Greens by former Fine Gael minister and MEP candidate for Dublin, Regina Doherty, who told the Irish Mail on Sunday that there is a ‘need to combat the over-mighty Greens in Europe’. Pic: Fergal Phillips A Fine Gael government spokesman insisted on Wednesday night: ‘There is absolutely no issue in terms of the stability of the coalition.’\nA Green Party government spokesman said: ‘At election time people set out their vision. We are three different parties.’ He said hia party is ‘very confident’ of retaining their two seats in Europe.",

    "text": "Rebeka Zeljko Daily Caller News Foundation Advancing American Freedom, a conservative group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence, is sounding the alarm about a Biden administration effort to collect Americans’ private financial information, according to a memo obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation. The [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://dailycaller.com/2024/04/26/opinion-bidens-securities-and-exchange-commission-is-after-your-privacy-brian-reardon/) (SEC) in 2012 authorized a program to make it easier for financial regulators to track transactions in U.S. markets by creating a “consolidated audit trail,” or CAT. This would require brokerages and exchanges to collect and report certain financial information to regulators and other financial organizations. Under the Biden administration, the SEC [approved](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/rule613-info) a new [funding model](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nms/2023/34-98290.pdf) for CAT in September 2023. [Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!](https://www.wnd.com/newsletter-subscription/) The [AAF memo](https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/aaf-bidens-secret-massive-database-of-your-financial-holdings/) warned that the CAT program was effectively an “Orwellian” government database of Americans’ personal information, and urged lawmakers to back a bill that would prevent the SEC from forcing financial institutions to hand over Americans’ information. The bill, known as [H.R. 4551](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4551) or the Protecting Investors’ Personally Identifiable Information Act, was introduced by Republican Rep. [Barry Loudermilk](https://loudermilk.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=4309) of Georgia. “We have witnessed abuses by other government agencies, including the IRS releasing private financial information,” AAF Chairman Marc Short told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “This unconstitutional and reckless [regulatory overreach](https://dailycaller.com/2023/06/15/exclusive-rep-byron-donalds-moves-to-curb-bidens-regulatory-overreach/) must be stopped.” The memo notes that in March 2020, former [SEC Chairman Jay Clayton](https://dailycaller.com/2017/01/04/trump-nominates-jay-clayton-for-sec-chairman-this-is-how-he-plans-on-unshackling-the-economy/) issued an [order](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/exorders/2020/34-88393.pdf) to limit the collection of personal information. “I believe the CAT’s regulatory objectives can be achieved without collection of the most sensitive pieces of retail investor information,” Clayton said in a [statement](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-clayton-cat-covid-19-nal-cybersecurity-2020-03-17). “It is important to minimize the impact of any potential data breaches, while also evaluating the need for cybersecurity improvements to the CAT.” The House Appropriations Committee’s financial services [spending bill](https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-appropriations.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/fy25-fsgg-subcommittee-bill-summary.pdf) would also prohibit the SEC from collecting personal information pertaining to CAT. The bill also [cuts SEC funding](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2024/06/04/house-spending-bill-cuts-sec-budget-curbs-cat-data-collection/) by $589 million below their requested 2025 fiscal budget and $144.3 million below their current 2024 fiscal budget.

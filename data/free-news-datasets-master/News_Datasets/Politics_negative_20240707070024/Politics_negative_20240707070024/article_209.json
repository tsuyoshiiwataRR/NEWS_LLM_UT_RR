    "text": "Sunday will be a lot calmer than Saturday with some nice sunbreaks for the morning and most of the afternoon. Showers will start moving back after sunset. Highs today will hit the mid to upper 50s. Showers will take over tonight making for a wet start to your Monday morning. Lows should drop to the upper 40s in most spots. Monday will have frequent showers and the chance of a thundershower or two. The best chance to hear the rumble of thunder will be along the ocean beaches, areas south of Tacoma, and in the Puget Sound Convergence Zone of north King and south Snohomish Counties. Highs on Monday will make it to the mid to upper 50s once again. Rain will continue on Tuesday under gray skies. Highs should drop back to a bit to the mid-50s. Right now the forecast models say Wednesday should bring mostly dry weather with some sunbreaks. It will not be all that warm with daytime highs only getting to the low to mid-50s.

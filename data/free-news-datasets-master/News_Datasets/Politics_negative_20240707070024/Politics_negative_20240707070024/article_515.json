    "text": "One of Joe Biden’s judicial nominees doesn’t understand basic science that most children learn in Middle School.\nMagistrate Judge Sarah Netburn was unable to answer a simple question about the basic scientific fact that chromosomes determine the sex of a human being at conception. Bidne nominated Netburn to serve as a federal judge for the Southern District of New York.\n“Is it possible to determine a person’s sex by only analyzing their chromosomes?” pro-life South Carolina Lindsey Graham asked.\n“I have never studied biology and therefore I am unqualified to answer this question,” Judge Netburn said.\nAs The Washington Times reports, the answer had ramifications:\nRepublican senators quizzed Judge Netburn over her decision to transfer a biological male child sex abuser to a female prison after the inmate decided to identify as a woman.\nHer decision to move the prisoner conflicted with the recommendation from the Bureau of Prisons.\nThe inmate had been convicted of raping two children: a 17-year-old girl and a nine-year-old boy. The inmate was also convicted of distributing child sex abuse material.\nJudge Netburn has been a magistrate judge for more than a decade.\nAs pro-life advocates know, science has confirmed for hundreds of years that chromosomes determine one’s sex.\nHuman Development: The Span of Life, 1974, page 28-29, George Kaluger: “In that fraction of a second when the chromosomes form pairs, the sex of the new child will be determined, hereditary characteristics received from each parent will be set, and a new life will have begun.”\nHuman Embryology & Teratology, 2nd edition, 1996, pages 8, 29, Ronan O’Rahilly and Fabiola Miller: “Although life is a continuous process, fertilization is a critical landmark because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed. … The combination of 23 chromosomes present in each pronucleus results in 46 chromosomes in the zygote. Thus the diploid number is restored and the embryonic genome is formed. The embryo now exists as a genetic unity.”\nDeCoursey, R.M., The Human Organism, 4th edition McGraw Hill Inc., Toronto, 1974. page 584: “The zygote therefore contains a new arrangement of genes on the chromosomes never before duplicated in any other individual. The offspring destined to develop from the fertilized ovum will have a genetic constitution different from anyone else in the world.”\nDr. Jerome Lejeune, discoverer of Down syndrome chromosome: “To accept the fact that after fertilization has taken place a new human has come into being is no longer a matter of taste or opinion. The human nature of the human being from conception to old age is not a metaphysical contention; it is plain experimental evidence.”",

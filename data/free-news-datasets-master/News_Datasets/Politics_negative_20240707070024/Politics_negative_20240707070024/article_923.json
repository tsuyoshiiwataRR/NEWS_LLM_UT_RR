    "text": "AMMAN — The Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned on Thursday the continuous and systematic targeting of shelters for displaced Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and United Nations centres. The latest incident was the assault on a school housing displaced persons in the Nuseirat camp in Gaza on Thursday, which is a violation of international law, the Jordan News Agency, Petra, reported. The ministry's spokesperson Sufian Qudah reiterated the Kingdom's condemnation and denunciation of these actions and crimes, which violate the rules of international law. He added that these acts contradict all human and ethical values and represent war crimes that the international community must confront and hold the perpetrators accountable. Qudah called on the international community to assume responsibility, deter Israel from committing further crimes against civilians, and put an end to its war on the Gaza Strip. He also emphasised the necessity of forcing Israel to respect international law and called for concerted efforts to stop Israeli aggression on Gaza.

    "text": "A broadcast moratorium is in place on media across the country ahead of the local, European and Limerick mayoral elections. The moratorium is imposed until 10pm on Friday. But what is it and why do we have it? Newstalk Political Correspondent Seán Defoe told [The Hard Shoulder](https://www.newstalk.com/podcasts/highlights-from-the-hard-shoulder) it relates to influencing people's votes. \"It's a rather archaic ban, effectively, that comes into place 2pm the day before an election until the times the polls close. \"Essentially [people in] radio or anyone on television or in broadcast media can't say anything about the election that could influence someone's vote one way or another. \"We can't talk about the candidates, we can't talk about their policies, the issues that are happening in the election.\" Seán said the moratorium harks back to the days before the internet. \"Probably most importantly we can't talk about any breaking news stories that happen,\" he said. \"The idea behind it was when broadcast was the only medium going and was the major influencer when it came to Irish politics. \"They didn't want anything happening in the last 24 hours of the campaign that could dramatically shift your vote\". Seán said the moratorium has yet to catch up with technology. \"That's the real kicker that makes it obsolete at the moment,\" he said. \"It does not apply to online media, it doesn't even apply to print. \"When it was the days of just getting the newspaper in the morning, listening to the radio in the afternoon and watching the TV at night the newspapers could still talk about this. \"But we can't talk about them talking about it\". Seán said reporters can only give general, factual statements during the moratorium. \"We can state bald facts as in the election is happening, voting time is between 7am and 10pm,\" he said. \"We can talk about the turnout figures. \"If you are online or working at a print organisation you can continue as if there's no restriction at all\". Seán said he believes the moratorium is set to be scrapped. \"In a landscape where online and social media is so prevalent, and the spread of disinformation is so easy, you have to be able to have respectable journalists and broadcasters to counter that. \" [Coimisiún na Meán](https://www.cnam.ie/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024_ReferendumGuidelines_vFinal.pdf) is going to look at this before the end of the year,\" he added. Don't forget to use your vote when polls open from 7am on Friday. Listen back here:",

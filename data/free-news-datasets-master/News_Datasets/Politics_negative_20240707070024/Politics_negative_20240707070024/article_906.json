    "text": "Mondaire Jones Gets What He Deserves After Jamaal Bowman Snub\nMondaire Jones was once a rising star in the Democratic Party. But with his latest antics over Jamaal Bowman, everyone is rightfully yanking their support.\nHouse Democratic candidate\nMondaire Jones has united pretty much everyone against him after his petty endorsement of Westchester County executive George Latimer over progressive Representative Jamaal Bowman. Latimer is largely considered to be running a Republican-backed campaign solely to oust Bowman, and Jones’s endorsement of his campaign has rankled several progressive groups.\nOn Thursday, Jews for Jamaal—a coalition of Jewish constituents in NY-16 and supported by local\nprogressive nonprofit Jews For Racial and Economic Justice— released a statement condemning Jones’s endorsement of Latimer and fiercely criticized Latimer’s prominently right wing-backed campaign.\n“As a diverse coalition of New York Jews, we reject continued use of Republican money to interfere with Democratic Party primaries with the aim of unseating a popular progressive Black Democrat,” the statement reads in part.\nAlso on Thursday, both New York’s Working Families Party and the Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC\nrescinded their endorsements of Jones. The Working Families Party, which revoked financial support for Jones’s campaign, issued a statement saying Jones’s endorsement of Latimer made clear he “strayed from the values and principles that made us proud to support him in 2020”:\n“Over the course of his campaign, Mondaire has strayed from the values and principles that made us proud to support him in 2020,” NYWFP codirectors Jasmine Gripper and Ana María Archila said in a statement to Gothamist. “His decision to back George Latimer, who uses\nracist dog whistles, rejects core parts of [President] Biden’s economic agenda, and shares donors with Mondaire’s own MAGA extremist opponent, runs counter to our values as a party.”\nJones, a former Bowman ally,\nendorsed Latimer on Tuesday, citing “Jewish residents in my district who feel anxiety, fear, and anger due to Representative Bowman’s words and actions in particular and an overall climate in this country.”\nBowman—a vocal critic of Israel’s deadly war on Gaza and Biden’s continued arms shipments to the country—has decried Latimer as a “Republican sock puppet” with his campaign’s significant support from\nMAGA conservatives, AIPAC, and pro-Israel opportunists hungry for the incumbent progressive’s ouster. Now, Jones’s endorsement of Latimer threaten his own race against aggressively pro-Israel Republican incumbent Representative Mike Lawler, who represents a Biden district that Jones could have recaptured in November.\nLatimer, meanwhile, has tried in vain to distance himself from the conservative groups supporting him. He has attempted to tout a progressive stance that largely focuses on casting Bowman’s Squad-backed progressivism as too extreme—and recently released a bizarre campaign video where he apparently\ngreen-screened himself with supporters in the Bronx, which is not part of Westchester County.",

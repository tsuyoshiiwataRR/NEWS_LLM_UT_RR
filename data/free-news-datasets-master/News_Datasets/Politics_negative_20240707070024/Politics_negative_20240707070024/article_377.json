    "text": "The Prince Edward Island government has signed a taxation agreement aimed at discouraging vaping. According to a news release from the province, the government signed a Coordinated Vaping Products Taxation agreement with Ottawa, which will tack on a combined tax rate of $2.24 per two millilitres for the first 10 millilitres of vaping substance in a product. It will also introduce $2.24 per 10 millilitres for volumes beyond that amount. The release says the tax rate is designed to reduce vaping among youths and it will not be tied to whether or not the substance contains nicotine. The agreement will take effect on Jan. 1, 2025.

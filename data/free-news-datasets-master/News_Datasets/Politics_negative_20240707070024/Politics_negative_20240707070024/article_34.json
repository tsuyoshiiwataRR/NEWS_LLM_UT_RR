    "text": "AURORA, Colo. — Aurora City Councilman Curtis Gardner changed his party affiliation from Republican to Unaffiliated on Wednesday night, following the Colorado Republican Party chairman’s homophobic comments on Pride month.\nHe posted a critique of the Colorado GOP and chairman Dave Williams on social media saying, “The Republican Party, and specifically the Colorado GOP, no longer stands for the issues that I care about.”\nHe listed those issues as “individual rights, restraint of government, limited foreign intervention, and encouraging economic mobility.”\nHis social media post did not say he switched party affiliation.\nGardner confirmed in a phone call with 9NEWS political reporter Marshall Zelinger on Thursday that he switched party affiliation.\nEarlier this week, Williams sent out a mass email on behalf of the Colorado GOP, attacking “godless groomers” and in a social media post, called for the burning of all Pride flags .\nThe Colorado GOP’s mass email titled “God Hates Pride,” read, in part, “The month of June has arrived and, once again, the godless groomers in our society want to attack what is decent, holy, and righteous so they can ultimately harm our children.”\nThe message to Colorado Republicans was headlined with an image reading “God Hates Flags,” a nod to the anti-gay slur on the picket signs of the infamous Westboro Baptist Church.\nThe party’s message was signed by Chairman Dave Williams. A post from the Colorado Republican Party on X, formerly Twitter, read simply, “Burn all the #pride flags this June.”\nIn his social media post, Gardner said, “To be clear, God hates no one - not those in the LGBTQ+ community and not Dave Williams. These hateful comments are despicable. I will always choose love - I care less about how you vote than I care about how you treat those who vote differently than you do.”\nRelated Articles LGBTQ+ salon offers free gender affirming haircuts for anyone under 21 Colorado Republican Party issues call to burn all Pride flags Denver PrideFest announces entertainment lineup SUGGESTED VIDEOS: Next with Kyle Clark\nClose Ad",

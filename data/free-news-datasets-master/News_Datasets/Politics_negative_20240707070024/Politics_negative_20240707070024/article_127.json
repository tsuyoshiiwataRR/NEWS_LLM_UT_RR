    "text": "The City Council voted by a wide margin Thursday to expand its ability to block top mayoral hires, teeing up another potential veto battle with Mayor Adams, whose team has sharply criticized the move as a power grab that’d hamper municipal government operations.\nThe hot-button issue relates to “advice-and-consent,” the process that requires the mayor to secure the Council’s approval before making hires for certain top city government posts . As it currently stands, only a handful commissioner-level posts, including the corporation counsel, need to undergo advice-and-consent.\nBut a bill passed by the Council on Thursday — in a 46-4 vote — would add another 20 agency commissioners to the list of positions subjected to advice-and-consent.\nThe posts that previously didn’t have to undergo advice-and-consent that would under the legislation include everything from the commissioners of Sanitation, Parks and Buildings to the heads of Social Services and Children’s Services.\nIn a press conference before the vote, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams , who authored the bill, said the measure is about increasing government transparency, ensuring candidate quality and protecting against corruption.\n“It incentivizes the nomination of qualified appointees who are accountable to New Yorkers and the public interest, not political loyalty or patronage,” she told reporters. “Advice-and-consent is a safeguard against a Tammany Hall-like environment, where commissioner positions are doled out simply because of their political allegiance to one person or another, or to pursue some other interests beyond the public’s.”\nCouncil Speaker Adrienne Adams (Luiz C. Ribeiro for NY Daily News) The speaker’s reference to Tammany Hall , the infamously corrupt organization that controlled New York politics in the 19th century, comes after the mayor and his advisers made the case in a press conference Tuesday that it’s actually the Council’s advice-and-consent expansion that would foster a Tammany-like process around commissioner appointments.\nIn Tuesday’s news conference, Lisa Zornberg, the mayor’s chief counsel, said that’s because the bill would politicize appointment processes by requiring consent from a majority of the Council’s 51 members. Zornberg also argued the bill would result in staffing delays at the top of key agencies and called the legislation “deeply misguided,” indicating the mayor could move to veto it once passed.\nThe mayor hasn’t said whether he’ll veto, though.\n“Our administration will continue to focus on the working-people of this city who want us to focus on how we can protect public safety, rebuild our economy, and make this city more livable,” Fabien Levy, the mayor’s spokesman, said when asked after Thursday’s vote if he’ll veto.\nSince taking office in January 2022, the mayor has used his veto pen several times, including in trying to block bills passed by the Council expanding housing voucher access , banning solitary confinement in city jails and implementing more rigorous reporting requirements on NYPD officers . In each of those instances, the Council responded by overriding the mayor’s vetoes, forcing the bills into laws over his objections.\nThe broad margin by which the advice-and-consent bill passed indicates Speaker Adams will have the ability to override the mayor should he pick the veto route again. The threshold for overring a veto is 34 votes.\n“In the unfortunate circumstance that it is vetoed, the Council will proceed as we normally have with past vetoes with this administration,” the speaker said when asked if she’s prepared to override the mayor again.\nCalling out Zornberg specifically, the speaker also said in her pre-vote press conference it’s “just not true” the bill would result in staffing delays. She noted the bill requires the Council to vote on any commissioner appointments made by the mayor within 30 days.\nThe veto issue aside, if the speaker’s bill ends up going into law, the advice-and-consent expansion cannot be officially implemented before New York City residents vote on the matter via a ballot referendum. The question has to be approved via referendum because it involves amending the City Charter, the local constitution.\nCouncil Democrats have said they’re aiming to get the advice-and-consent question onto this November’s general election ballot — though that may be blocked by a separate charter revision effort initiated by the mayor.\nThe effort, a Charter Revision Commission launched by the mayor last month, is tasked with drafting referendum questions for this November’s ballot to amend the charter so it “can contribute to public safety and provide opportunities for greater community input and transparency when legislation is proposed that would impact public safety.”\nIf the mayor’s commission advances a question onto the November ballot, the Council would be precluded from getting its advice-and-consent proposal onto it. That’s due to a quirk in municipal law that bars a Council-advanced question from appearing on a ballot that already has a mayoral commission-advanced question on it.\nCouncil members have accused the mayor of using the commission as a vehicle to block the broadening of advice-and-consent — an argument Queens Councilman Jim Gennaro reiterated before Thursday’s vote.\n“[The commission’s] sole purpose is, in my opinion, just to delay and to thwart the Council’s legitimate attempt to bring more daylight and better government,” Genarro, a moderate Democrat, said before accusing Tiffany Raspberry, a top adviser to the mayor, of displaying “petulance” by abruptly leaving a contentious Council hearing on the bill last week without taking questions. “I think that the mayor should have much more respect than what he’s shown so far in this process.”\nThe mayor’s office has denied he’s using the commission to try to derail the advice-and-consent push.",

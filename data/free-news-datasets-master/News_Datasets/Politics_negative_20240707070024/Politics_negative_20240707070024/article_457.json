    "text": "A delegation led by the Labour Party’s Presidential Candidate, Peter Obi, paid a visit to former Super Eagles winger, Tijani Babangida, in Abuja. This visit was confirmed by Obi’s campaign spokesperson, Yunusa Tanko, in a statement released in the Federal Capital Territory.\nIn a fatal car accident last month, the 50-year-old former Ajax FC star suffered a broken right leg, in which his son and younger brother, Ibrahim Babangida, lost their lives. Ibrahim, also an ex-international who played for Nigeria in the 1993 FIFA U-17 World Cup-winning team.\nTijani’s wife was also seriously injured in the accident.\nOffering words of comfort to the family, the former Anambra State governor expressed how the Babangidas brought pride to the nation through their talents.\nHe remarked, “They made the nation proud and brought us joy with their skills. At times like these, they deserve our sympathy and care. I came to express my condolences for his injury, the loss of his loved ones, the trauma, and to remind him that he remains in our thoughts.”\nGrateful for the visit, Tijani, sitting with his leg heavily bandaged, shared the tragic details of the accident.\nThe President of the Professional Footballers Association of Nigeria also shared how he has been receiving financial aid and support from his former colleagues and Ajax football club since the incident.\nAccompanied by Atlanta 1996 Olympic gold medalist and the General Secretary of the PFAN, Emmanuel Babayaro, who was present during Obi’s visit, expressed gratitude, emphasizing the importance of such gestures in uplifting the spirits of retired players.",

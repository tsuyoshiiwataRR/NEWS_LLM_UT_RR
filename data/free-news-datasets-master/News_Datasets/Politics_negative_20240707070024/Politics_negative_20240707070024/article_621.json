    "text": "US President said that Ukraine should not use Western weapons against Moscow and the Kremlin. Joe Biden told this in an exclusive interview with [ABC News ](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-biden-muir-us-weapons-wont-be-used-strike-moscow-kremlin/story?id=110865528)anchor David Muir in Normandy. \"We're not authorizing strikes 200 miles into Russia and we're not authorizing strikes on Moscow, on the Kremlin,\" Biden said. When asked whether he was concerned about Vladimir Putin's comments that \"supply of high-precision weapons to Ukraine for strikes on Russian territory is direct participation in this war,\" he said the following. \"I've known him for over 40 years. He's concerned me for 40 years. He's not a decent man. He's a dictator, and he's struggling to make sure he holds his country together while still keeping this assault going. We're not talking about giving them weapons to strike Moscow, to strike the Kremlin, to strike against... just across the border, where they're receiving significant fire from conventional weapons used by the Russians to go into Ukraine to kill Ukrainians.\" ,- answered Biden. Earlier, Apostrophe wrote that the [US is preparing a new military aid package for Ukraine.](https://apostrophe.ua/en/news/world/2024-06-05/ssha-gotovyat-novyiy-paket--voennoy--pomoschi-dlya-ukrainyi/323245)",

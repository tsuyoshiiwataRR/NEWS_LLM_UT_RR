    "text": "GREEN BAY (WLUK) â€“ Two suspects in a Green Bay homicide made initial court appearances Thursday, although formal charges have not been filed in the case. Aaron Walton, 32, and Joseph Poore, 39, are each being held on $1 million cash bond. Police requested charges of first-degree intentional homicide and armed robbery. Prosecutors filed probable cause statements under seal, which a court commissioner accepted as sufficient evidence to set the bail. Prosecutors expect to file charges by June 14 in connection [with the death of Robert Marshall.](https://fox11online.com/news/local/green-bay-police-name-victim-in-deadly-stabbing-three-suspects-in-custody-armed-robbery-south-roosevelt-street-robert-marshall#) Both are expected in court that day. Police say Marshall, 33, was found lying on the ground outside in the 700 block of S. Roosevelt Street Monday. Less than two hours later, [three people were taken into custody](https://fox11online.com/news/crime/three-in-custody-after-fatal-stabbing-on-green-bays-east-side-police-department-roosevelt-street-family-notification-homicide-investigation#) during a traffic stop in another jurisdiction and taken back to Green Bay for questioning, although just Walton and Poore appeared in court for the case Thursday. Police say their investigation indicates the victim and suspects were known to one another and the victim died during the commission of an armed robbery. Walton is also wanted by Michigan on a drug case. He has a court date June 26 on that extradition matter.",

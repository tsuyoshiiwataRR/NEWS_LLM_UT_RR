    "text": "Read full article Kotaku One Of The Best Superhero Games Ever Is Free Right Now Zack Zwiezen 6 June 2024 at 11:10 pm · 2-min read Link copied Image: Marvel / Firaxis\nThe Epic Games Store is once again handing out a very good game for free. This time around it’s Marvel’s Midnight Suns , one of the best games of 2022 and one of my favorite superhero adventures out there.\nMarvel’s Midnight Suns , in case you missed it, is a turn-based tactical RPG that blends some light life-sim-like elements—like romance and dates—with fantastic tactical combat on par with XCOM and Fire Emblem. But, unlike those games, Midnight Suns lets you kick cars at classic Marvel villains like Venom and Sabretooth. And right now, you can kick cars at Venom for free via the Epic Games Store .\nDon’t get it twisted, though; Midnight Suns is more than just fun gameplay and cool combat. The game also features a compelling narrative that plays out unlike anything seen in the MCU or most other superhero games. I mean, how many superhero movies or games let you spend time with Blade in a book club ?\nAnd don’t let its card-based action scare you away, as the game isn’t a deck builder or anything like that. It just uses cards to represent powers and moves you can use during each turn. However, game director Jake Solomon did express regret about using cards, suggesting that might have been the reason why the game didn’t sell as well as expected .\n“I think cards were a major problem,” Solomon told VGC . “I think it was a good design solution, but I think I was naive about what people would think when they saw the mechanic was cards. Not everyone on my team was behind the idea, but they trusted me.”\nMarvel’s Midnight Suns is a fantastic game and currently available to download for free until June 13 via the Epic Games Store on PC . In case you didn’t realize, this is me saying you should play it. Even if you don’t like the MCU or superhero stuff ! But first, turn off the 2K Launcher. It sucks .\n.\nFor the latest news, Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .",

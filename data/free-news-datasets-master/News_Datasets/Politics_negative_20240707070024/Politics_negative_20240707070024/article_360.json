    "text": "NEW DELHI: Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which coordinated the farmers’ protest against three farm laws that the govt finally withdrew, on Thursday demanded an apology from PM Narendra Modi for \\\"continuous violation\\\" of the model code of conduct (MCC) and urged Supreme Court to act against those who breached the law during the election period.\\\"SKM demands Narendra Modi, the newly-elected leader of the National Democratic Alliance, to tender public apology for the continuous violation of model code of conduct or face prosecution as per the law. All are equal before the law and Modi cannot be an exception,\\\" SKM said in a statement.\\\"Modi, along with many top leaders of BJP, violated the MCC in many ways by spreading venomous hatred against the principal minority community of India, misusing religious faith of the common people for electoral gains and resorted to blatant lies, misused state machinery and even intimidated the political opposition,\\\" it added.The farmers' union said it had demanded that the Election Commission take action against misuse of religion and communal propaganda by Modi, but the poll panel paid no heed.\\\"Consistently instigating hatred against minorities fosters alienation and insecurity among the minorities which breeds fundamentalist trends and weakens secular foundations. This provides opportunity to minority communalism, isolates minorities and hampers the common movement of farmers, workers and all oppressed sections,\\\" the SKM said.The farmers' union said it had demanded that the Election Commission take action against misuse of religion and communal propaganda by Modi, but the poll panel paid no heed.",

    "text": "Narendra Modi\nCracks may be starting to emerge already in Narendra Modi’s attempts to form a coalition Government, with reports that the BJP’s minor allies are making big demands regarding policy changes.\nModi is being forced to negotiate terms with alliance members after his BJP unexpectedly failed to win a majority in the country’s election.\nIndian media are quoting sources as saying Modi plans to push back his inauguration for a third term as PM until Sunday while the talks continue.\nThe Janata Dal (United) has reportedly asked the BJP to modify its controversial Agniveer scheme – a flagship military recruitment reform passed in 2022 that created short-term, US-style “tours of duty” for new soldiers. JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar is also expected to negotiate for key portfolios in Modi’s cabinet.\nAnother key ally, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) led by N. Chandrababu Naidu is likely to demand a new special status for his state Andhra Pradesh, a cabinet role for his son and more funds for Amravati city in his state.

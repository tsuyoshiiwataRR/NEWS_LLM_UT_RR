    "text": "[Join the fight and contribute to our war chest.](https://donate.revolver.news/) [Ditch the ads for $5 per month or $49 per year.](https://revolver.news/subscribe/) By now, the world is accustomed to watching Joe Biden make one embarrassing blunder after another. He stumbles, bumbles, and fumbles his way through the day, while our propaganda media turns a blind eye, portraying him as a stalwart, seasoned politician whose age symbolizes wisdom and experience. Meanwhile, these same media frauds claim President Trump is “senile.” This is just another blow against what’s left of the regime media’s credibility. However, the media can’t even help Joe now.Lately, his blunders have escalated from routine senility to outright catastrophes. That’s precisely what unfolded in France during the D-Day event with President Macron. The entire situation turned into a political debacle that played out in front of the world, leaving many to wonder if this is Joe’s D-Day, and Democrats are now getting ready to yank him off the ballot. The nightmare unfolded on stage with President Macron and his wife. Joe and Jill were in France to commemorate D-Day, but instead of honoring the brave men who stormed the beaches and changed history, Joe Biden pulled some bizarre moves that were so inappropriate they prompted his top “handler,” Jill Biden, to quickly escort him away. This left Macron and his wife completely baffled. Joe looks completely lost as he makes his way onto the stage, but sadly, things quickly go downhill from there. No way he makes it to the election… [pic.twitter.com/vYPjLhOVq0] — Gunther Eagleman™ (@GuntherEagleman) [June 6, 2024] It’s unclear what Joe Biden was attempting on stage. Did he think there was a chair nearby? Some speculate that he may have soiled himself. Either way, it was a damning moment that leaves no doubt about Mr. Biden’s serious cognitive issues and underscores that he has no business pretending to play “president” at our expense. Furthermore, his wife, who can be seen covering her mouth and possibly saying something to him, should probably be charged with elder abuse for allowing this to continue. We’ve had many incompetent Presidents Not so many incontinent ones [pic.twitter.com/C0ZlDcLSd0] — Will Chamberlain (@willchamberlain) [June 6, 2024] It was after the bizarre “chair incident” that nursemaid Jill Biden swooped in and promptly put an end to the festivities, raising a lot more questions and concern. Yikes! At an Omaha Beach event honoring the 80th Anniversary of the D-Day invasion, Dr. Jill Biden quickly escorts Joe Biden away leaving a seemingly perplexed French President Emmanuel Macron to honor WW2 veterans alone. [pic.twitter.com/5fgthFysBA] — Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) [June 6, 2024] Sadly, this clearly ill man doesn’t even know where he is or what’s going on around him, and that should scare the living daylights out of every single American. Biden literally has no idea where he is……. this is frightening. [pic.twitter.com/FMDHD38mD6] — Spitfire (@DogRightGirl) [June 6, 2024] Here’s a one-stop roundup of the day’s horrific events as they unfolded. Joe Biden highlights in Normandy on the 80th anniversary of D-Day: – Sits in an invisible chair – Forgets where his seat is – Talks about how many Russians died in Ukraine – Gets pulled away by Docta Jill as Macron greets D-Day veterans. [pic.twitter.com/sWFsYpt1o5] — Greg Price (@greg_price11) [June 6, 2024] What happened in France has a lot of people wondering if this is a “code blue” situation, and Dems will pull the “emergency card” and yank Biden off the ballot. Revolver has delved into this topic recently, and while we understand that the left doesn’t want to ride into 2024 on an old, broken-down horse, they likely don’t have a choice. The forces that were able to manipulate the Democratic Party so effectively four years ago have lost their edge in 2024, and whatever hope the party had of replacing Biden has actually been squandered through sheer cowardice and inaction. Simply put, the Democrats have sleepwalked into a disastrous position in which they can’t live with Biden and can’t get rid of him—at least unless he dies or voluntarily steps aside. Otherwise, the regime is stuck with the Old Man. As we’ve noted, the only exits for the Democrats are if Joe kicks the bucket or throws in the towel. After what happened in France, that could become a reality, though it seems unlikely, given his massive ego and Jill’s obsession with power. But let’s say it all falls apart and Biden’s gone, by choice or forced out—what happens next? The Revolver piece [explores the options:](https://revolver.news/2024/03/the-left-has-to-replace-biden-but-can-they/) A late primary entrant swoops in to steal the nomination. Nope! Besides the fact that several states have already held primary votes, the deadline to put new candidates on the ballot has already passed in the vast majority of states. As of this writing, just six states plus D.C. still allow a candidate to get on the ballot; by the time you read this, it may have dwindled further. Needless to say, even a 100% sweep of those states wouldn’t be enough for some surprise candidate to get the nomination. Even a candidate mounting a write-in campaign at this point would find it functionally impossible to get 50% of delegates, even if we handwaved away the difficult task of actually winning over Democrat primary voters. Under the existing political rules, as laid out in the DNC’s by-laws, the calculus is simple: Biden is guaranteed to have a majority of delegates in the Democrat primary process, and under DNC rules, those delegates are required to vote for him at the party convention. Under existing rules, he will be the nominee. If Joe drops out before the convention, the DNC delegates become free to choose whoever they please. The Revolver piece [continues:](https://revolver.news/2024/03/the-left-has-to-replace-biden-but-can-they/) The DNC something something. Okay, so nobody else is snatching the nomination under the current rules. But political parties aren’t the government. They can actually rewrite rules on the fly, and that includes changing how a party picks its nominee. To attentive political observers, then, it may seem like the DNC is the obvious place to put in the fix. Didn’t they do that in 2016 for Hillary, protecting her while undermining Bernie Sanders at every opportunity? So, if the party feels doomed under Biden, why not do the same thing and start juggling the rules to allow a convention switcheroo? The bylaws of the DNC do explicitly mention that the DNC’s powers include filling a vacancy on the national ticket; such a vacancy is to be filled by “voting … in accord with procedural rules adopted by the Rules and Bylaws Committee and approved by the Democratic National Committee.” That word is key: vacancy. As long as Biden is around and running, no such vacancy exists. Changing this process means changing the party rules. And that means going to the committee named above: the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee. Technically, the DNC has many hundreds of members, but the actual nerve center of the party is this committee, small enough to fit into a single D.C. hotel room. The DNC isn’t just some independent player on the left; it’s practically a puppet of Joe Biden. Thinking it’ll switch directions to save the Democrats is as unrealistic as expecting Donald Trump’s presidential campaign to be derailed by the folks at Mar-a-Lago. The next option is one of the most unlikely: the 25th Amendment. The Revolver piece [continues:](https://revolver.news/2024/03/the-left-has-to-replace-biden-but-can-they/) Ever since the media fantasized about the Trump cabinet foisting him aside, Americans have become enamored with this obscure constitutional provision that was previously just fodder for the odd political thriller. Recently, retiring Republican Ken Buck put forward a pointless resolution that, if passed (it won’t be), would formally call on the Cabinet to declare Biden unable to perform his duties. To do that, Vice President Harris and at least half of the 15 Cabinet secretaries would have to formally notify Congress that Biden is unable to perform his duties. But if Biden sends a letter to Congress disagreeing, it would fall to Congress to decide the matter, and only a two-thirds vote by both houses would be enough to actually remove Biden—an even tougher standard than impeachment and removal (which only requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate). Now, would that actually happen? Of course not. But, for all practical purposes, if Biden’s Cabinet actually rebelled to the point that a majority publicly declared him unfit, that would likely be so tremendously politically damaging that Biden would have to resign or at the very least stop seeking another term. So, could that rebellion happen? What about the ‘Hunter factor?’ Could they use Joe’s wayward son to blackmail him into slithering off into the sunset? Probably not. The Revolver piece keeps [exploring:](https://revolver.news/2024/03/the-left-has-to-replace-biden-but-can-they/) Pressure Biden to “voluntarily” retire. For those who imagine that “they” still have a plan, weaponizing Hunter Biden as a tool to drive out his father still seems like a likely scenario. But in fact, superficial public efforts to pressure Biden against running again only reveal the impotence of this option, rather than its imminent success. Resigning because your associates are being targeted legally is the old norm in a more civilized political culture. The relentless lawfare campaign against Donald Trump and all his associates since 2021 has exposed the new norm of American politics: When your enemies want you in jail, the last thing you should ever do is voluntarily give up political power. Though few realize it even now, it’s far more likely that the legal targeting of Hunter makes Joe more likely to cling to the presidency and the pardon power that comes with it. If a Hunter Biden scandal were used to smoke out Joe, then the election itself would be about Hunter Biden and his scandalous behavior; even if Joe wasn’t on the ballot, the immediacy of the scandal would overwhelm everything. And, of course, Democrats know this, which is why precisely zero prominent Democratic politicians are talking about Hunter or giving any life to the House GOP’s symbolic impeachment push. If the Hunter indictment was a Deep State op, then it’s an op that failed. This brings us to a bigger problem for the Dems. The regime-run media complex needs runway and space to prep the American public for the next moves—be it a new successor, another COVID scare, or fresh climate warnings. Yanking Joe out now would throw a wrench in the entire “narrative machine”; they simply wouldn’t have enough time to get things in order. At least with Joe, they’ve already laid the groundwork and can spin their umpteen narratives to keep the show hobbling along. Even supposing Democrat actors agreed on the need to push Biden aside in a desperate bid to keep power and were somehow able to overcome the challenges presented above, there’s a crucial follow-up question: If not him, who? The only obvious replacement, Kamala Harris, is both less popular and, incredibly, less competent than the senile Biden. The Democrat puppet masters rightly consider Kamala a non-starter. Just as the Democrat strategists understand Kamala is a non-starter, they understand the political difficulty of passing over the heir apparent, especially one who often presents herself as black. In order to replace Biden, the Democrat establishment would have to make some sort of deal to appease Kamala and would be additionally constrained in their choice of candidates that would alleviate their base’s indignation at passing over a woman of color vice president. Unfortunately for the Democrats, there is nobody after Kamala who fits this bill. There is no heir apparent on the left, no widely respected figure who stands above the rest of the field as the presumptive favorite in any primary. Their last president, Barack Obama, is the only figure who could quickly unite the party. But Barack is barred from running, so hey, why not just slot his wife in and have everyone nod along while knowing who really runs the show? But alas, Michelle Obama doesn’t want it and never has. To understand the nightmare unfolding for Democrats right now, it helps to simply think back to the events of 2016. The Republican Party establishment was horrified at Donald Trump’s rise and utter conquest of their party. Plenty of them refused to endorse or vote for him. Yet they were also shockingly powerless to stop him. The RNC had set rules for how to pick a candidate. Under those rules, Trump won. By the time of the July convention, the only strategy opponents could think of was trying to get delegates to simply revolt on the convention floor. No dice. The bottom line is this: if what’s happening with Joe Biden qualifies as an emergency, then it’s an emergency, and things will unfold accordingly. But to think that the Democrats are watching this nightmare unfold and planning to pull some magical trigger to end Joe’s run is probably wishful thinking.

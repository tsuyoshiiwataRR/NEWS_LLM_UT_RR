    "text": "Trump ally Steve Bannon must report to prison by July 1 to serve a four-month sentence. Bannon was convicted of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena. His defence argues the charges are politically motivated and unjust. Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of former US President Donald Trump , must report to prison by July 1 to serve his four-month sentence for defying a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the US Capitol insurrection, a federal judge has ruled.\nUS District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington granted prosecutors’ request to make Bannon begin serving his prison term after a three-judge panel of a federal appeals court last month upheld his contempt of Congress conviction.\nBut Nichols also made clear in his ruling that Bannon could seek a stay of his order, which could delay his surrender date.\nOutside the courthouse, Bannon told reporters: “I’ve got great lawyers, and we’re going to go all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to.”\n Nichols, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, a Republican, had initially allowed Bannon to remain free while he fought his conviction.\nBut the panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit said all of Bannon’s challenges lack merit.\nBannon was convicted in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the January 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.",

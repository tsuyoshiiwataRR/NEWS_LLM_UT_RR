    "text": "/ world at the moment information/ The particular event for this notice is the open letter of Prof. Lyudmil Georgiev to the President of the Republic, revealed in *, calling on him to declare martial regulation. A is induced, if not by the knowledge of the doubt, that, as regards the topic, the topic of the identical, the esteemed professor was, forgive me, influenced by another person’s opinions, neglecting the necessity for a extra crucial angle, incl. from the standpoint of a great data not solely of particular person or all provisions, but additionally of the that means and spirit of the Structure as a fundamental regulation, to what, not yesterday, expresses generally praising, generally vilifying the president, a website that makes use of as a tribune.\nBecause the creator of the quoted letter is little doubt conscious, the idea of “ individual ” will not be present in our vernacular speech. It has handed into our literary language from Russian. In it, it could have been shaped in imitation of the French phrase personalite and the German phrase Persönlichkeit. And so they, in flip, modeled on the Latin personalita, a time period derived from the phrase persona. That is what the Romans initially known as the masks with which the actor appeared on the stage to be able to look in response to the position he performed. Later, persona started to imply the position itself, and even later – the individual. On this sense, there is no such thing as a distinction between persona and personalita. Within the Slavic languages, the phrase “individual”, when used to indicate an individual, is synonymous with “character”. However even in them, the unique that means of “individual” was completely different from that of persona. In these languages, “face” is the entrance a part of the top. Which signal is said to the phrases “distinguish” and “licha” (to face out, to be seen). As a result of the “face” is that a part of the physique by which the “man” is most clearly recognized (seems).\nIn a earlier publish: I briefly talked about, taking note of one of many specifics of the present Bulgarian Structure, concerning the stability between the position of the president as head of state and the main place of the parliament. It ought to by no means, incl. in any scenario or with any challenges, even when below the affect of feelings to overlook or so far as is understood to neglect that in response to Artwork. 1, para. 1 of the Structure Bulgaria is a republic with parliamentary authorities. Subsequently, as in response to Artwork. 100, para. 5 of the identical, in addition to Artwork. 20, merchandise 1 of the Legislation on Protection and the Armed Forces, what the distinguished professor requires specifically, is in the end a choice inside the competence of the Nationwide Meeting. And it could be advisable for anyone, together with particularly in view of their authority habilitated individuals, to look extra fastidiously and analyze extra completely the character and nature of the occasions, taking into consideration the circumstances the place one or the opposite is worried a manifestation of tumult, inciting what actions the easy and ignorant so-called representatives of the sovereign, who think about that they’re the bearers of energy, make accusations in opposition to the top of state, from the mass protest of the residents exactly in protection of the Structure and the regulation. That’s the reason, in a earlier article on this event, I used the verb rose, within the sense of stood up, and never rose up, not out of incompetence. As a result of it isn’t logical for the one to whom the ability belongs in response to the Structure to rise in opposition to himself. And the riot is in opposition to the administration, which abuses the ability briefly granted to it for train, not its personal, however that of these in whose curiosity, in response to the oath below para. 2 of Artwork. 76 of the Structure ought to govern. An oath taken by all – straight elected or not directly assigned to carry out features in any of the separate from the unified state energy. The President as head of state, every time, subsequently, if in success of the oath taken by him should adhere to the observance of the Structure and the legal guidelines of the land, he shouldn’t be inspired to violate them, whether or not with in any other case good intentions and though they’re motivated by a misunderstanding of the constitutional set-up of the state. The popularity by the president as straight elected by the sovereign head of state of the protest by nearly all of Bulgarian residents in opposition to the federal government as official, as a political act, is in full accordance with the Structure and the oath taken by him, the importance of which isn’t solely institutional, but additionally when it comes to authorized worth, extra extra and in a private high quality is greater than clear to everybody – within the nation and out of doors it. The remaining depends upon the individuals. To name on the top of state, whoever he could also be, to desert the one establishment by way of which, representing the individuals, he upholds the Structure and the oath he took, supporting civil society, if not naively, has no different that means than even on account of inadequate consideration a manifestation of malice, as let’s go away apart the president in relation to the residents of Bulgaria. Neither Rakovski, nor Levski, Botev or Benkovski, any of them of their capability as head of state of the Ottoman Empire, led the Bulgarian individuals as voivode, incl. to the April rebellion for freedom!\n* %D1percent80percentD0percentB0percentD0percentB7percentD0percentB1percentD0percentB8percentD1percent80percentD0percentB0percentD1percent82percentD0percentB5-%D0percentBBpercentD0percentB8-%D0percentBApercentD0percentB0percentD0percentBApercentD0percentB2percentD0percentBE-%D0percentB2percentD0percentB8-%D0percentBApercentD0percentB0percentD0percentB7percentD0percentB2percentD0percentB0percentD0percentBC-%D0percentB3-%D0percentBD-%D0percentBFpercentD1percent80percentD0percentB5percentD0percentB7percentD0percentB8percentD0percentB4/\n#event #name #President #declare #martial #regulation",

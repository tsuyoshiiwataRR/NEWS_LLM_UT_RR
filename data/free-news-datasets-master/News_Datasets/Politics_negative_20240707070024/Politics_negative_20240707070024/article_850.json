    "text": "Utility companies hope to increase rates despite power outages LANSING, Mich. (WILX/WNEM/WLUC) - As utility companies in the state look to raise rates, a new report shows Michigan is one of the top state’s in the nation for power outages. Just months after previously being approved for rate hikes, DTE and Consumers Energy are once again requesting to raise their rates. This is despite a new report from [Bridge Michigan](https://www.bridgemi.com/quality-life/michigan-near-tops-nation-outages-utilities-want-raise-rates) showing the state with the third highest amount of power outages in the nation since 2000. “We know our customers deserve to not experience those outages, and so we really want to make sure we’re building a strong, resilient grid that’s prepared for the weather of the future, and that’s where these costs go to,” Consumer Energy’s Tracy Wimmer said. DTE is requesting a $450 million rate increase that would see people pay an extra $11 a month on average. Consumers Energy is requesting a $303 million rate hike that they say would result in customers paying an extra 7-percent, or around $3 a month. “We know that making those upgrades now before they cause significant problems, while expensive, will save everyone money in the long term,” Wimmer stated. Wimmer said they’ve been putting a lot of work replacing aging infrastructure and putting more renewable energy sources online. “As we bring more renewable energy projects online that is going to bring down the cost of energy significantly. Once we make these upgrades, a lot of the upgrades that we’re doing are meant to be long-term,” Wimmer explained. Bay City saw a string of power outages in late May and back in January. Their local utility company, Bay City Electric, Light and Power, took the blame for the outages. Bay City Commissioner Christopher Girard hopes the reoccurring theme comes to an end and is pushing for legislation that would improve communication between local utility companies and customers. “I am completely supportive of doing whatever it takes as a commissioner representing the residents that we do not have these kinds of power outages happening again,” Girard said. Attorney General Dana Nessel is pushing back against the proposed rate increases, while the Michigan Public Service Commission announced Thursday they are looking at creating new penalties and incentives to reduce the number of power outages.

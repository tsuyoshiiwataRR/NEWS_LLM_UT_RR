    "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has called on Inspector-General of Police Olukayode Egbetokun to expedite efforts towards the arrest and prosecution of Hudu Yunusa-Ari, the suspended INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in Adamawa.\nPDP’s national publicity secretary, Debo Ologunagba, made the call at a news conference on Thursday in Abuja, saying that arresting and prosecuting Yunusa-Yari would be in obedience to court order.\nYunusa-Ari was suspended over an attempt to usurp the powers of the state returning officer when he declared the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Aishatu Binani, the winner of the April 15, 2023 Adamawa governorship election.\nAt the point of the declaration, the compilation of the election results was incomplete.\nOlogunagba described the action as a civilian coup and an attempt to subvert Nigeria’s constitutional democracy.\nThe High Court of Justice of Adamawa State, No. 9, Yola Division, has issued a warrant of arrest against Yunusa-Ari, dated May 21, 2024.\nThe court ordered the IGP to apprehend and produce Yunusa-Ari to appear before it to answer to the charges preferred against him.\nThe order of court was received at the office of the IGP on May 23.\nOlogunagba said that since his removal, Yunusa-Ari has been on the run, forgetting the saying that “time does not run against the state in criminal matters.”\nHe, however, said that the delay in the prompt and diligent prosecution of Yunusa-Ari constitutes a clear and present danger to Nigeria’s democracy and the rule of law.\n“The failure of the Nigerian police so far to apprehend and bring Yunusa-Ari to justice is capable of creating bad precedence and encouraging other public officers to act with impunity.\n“There is a tendency for them to behave as if there are no consequences for acts contrary to the law and their oath of office,” he said.\nPDP charged the Inspector General of Police to, in compliance with the order of the court, immediately fish out, arrest and bring Yunusa-Ari before the court for prosecution.\n“This is especially urgent as there are allegations and apprehensions in the public space that Yunusa-Ari has perfected plans to escape from the country and evade trial.\n“The PDP insists that Yunusa-Ari must be made to face the full wrath of the law for his assault against our democracy,” he said.",

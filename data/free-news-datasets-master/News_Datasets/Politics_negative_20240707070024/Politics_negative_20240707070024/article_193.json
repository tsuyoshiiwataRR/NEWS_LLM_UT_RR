    "text": "President Biden has been trying to frame the November election around two subjects: his legislative accomplishments and former President Trump’s fitness to serve.\nBut Biden’s own vulnerabilities have been getting in the way. High among them for many voters is a sense that the country is in chaos, fueled in part by images of an overwhelmed southern border that have flooded television screens and social media feeds since he took office.\n“The fentanyl that is coming across the border is coming into our communities,” said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, where Biden is down by an average of 6 percentage points to Trump, in an interview. “The human trafficking that happens at the border comes into our communities.”\nThat helps explain why Biden took executive action this week — severely limiting the rights of migrants to seek asylum — that surprised and angered many allies on the left and could very well be struck down in court.\n“He did what he had to do, not just because it is a huge campaign issue, but because it’s a genuine problem,” said David Axelrod, who served as a top political advisor to former President Obama. “He probably should have done it sooner.”\nBiden, Axelrod, Cortez Masto and other Democrats have been laying the border problem at the feet of Republicans, who tanked a bipartisan bill earlier this year that would have given the president more money and leverage for border enforcement, because former President Trump wanted to keep the issue alive for the campaign.\nBut despite his role in killing the enforcement bill, Trump maintains a big lead on the question of which candidate can better handle the problem, including an ABC poll released last month that showed he leads Biden 47% to 30% on whom to trust more on fixing the border.",

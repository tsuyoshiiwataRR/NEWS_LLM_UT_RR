    "text": "The Democratic National Committee unveiled their first paid advertising calling out Trump for being a convicted felon Thursday, and they put it only miles from a Trump campaign rally. The billboard, paid for by the DNC, says &quot;Trump already attacked Arizona&#039;s democracy once. Now he&#039;s back as a convicted felon. He&#039;s out for revenge and retribution. Trump: unfit to serve.&quot; The billboard is facing southbound traffic on I-17, a major freeway through the center of Phoenix, only seven miles from the Dream City Church where Trump is holding a &quot;Chase the Vote&quot; rally with anti-Martin Luther King activist Charlie Kirk and his Turning Point USA organization. Google Maps DNC Deputy Communications Director Abhi Rahman said in a statement: As president, Donald Trump and his MAGA minions systematically attacked Arizonans’ rights. Now, the threat Trump poses to Arizonans’ democracy, economy, and safety has never been greater. If Trump, now a convicted felon, wins in November, he pledges to be a dictator ‘on day one’ in order to implement his agenda of revenge and retribution: stoking political violence while attacking Arizonans’ reproductive and democratic rights. That’s why Arizonans will reject Trump in November and again unite behind President Biden and Vice President Harris to defend democracy and deliver for Arizona families. The Biden-Harris campaign called Trump a convicted felon for the first time in a post on X earlier this week.",

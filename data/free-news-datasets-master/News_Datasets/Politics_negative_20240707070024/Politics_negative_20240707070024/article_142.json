    "text": "Its difficult for me to pay attention to someone like Margorie Taylor Greene (I refuse to call her Representative), who is so illiterate she didnt know the holocaust was an incomparably bad event. Now shes an expert on infectious diseases, ranking herself above a world renown physician-scientist and immunologist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who was the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for nearly 40 years. Dr. Fauci has been one of the worlds most frequently cited scientists in journals within his field. President George W. Bush awarded Dr. Fauci the highest civilian award in the U.S., the Presidential Medal of Freedom, for his work on AIDS relief. But Marge T-G, and the rest of the MAGA peanut-gallery, dont think Dr. Fauci deserves his PhD. Marge thinks he should be imprisoned. What are her credentials to make such bold assertions? She has a BA in business administration. Woo-freakin-hoo! Apparently, no one in the MAGA party has a higher level of credential, who feels able to out-rank Marge and tell her shes full of bat guano. I get that Marge won her seat in the House because she had no opposition. But shes opposed to so many things, to include celebrated American professionals, that one wonders if anyone in the 14th Congressional Georgia district has the mental acuity to challenge such a morose zero. She belongs in a facility specializing in histrionic personality disorder. Or perhaps a job in a womens prison, as a latrine orderly. Not finished with MTG just yet.

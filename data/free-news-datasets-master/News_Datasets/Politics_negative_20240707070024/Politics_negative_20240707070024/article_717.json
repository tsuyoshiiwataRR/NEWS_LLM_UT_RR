    "text": "AOC suggested that Trump could jail her if he wins the presidency again. \"It sounds nuts, but like, I wouldn't be surprised if this guy threw me in jail,\" she said. \"If Donald Trump wins, we are looking at the potential dissolution of democracy,\" she added. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested this week that she could be jailed if former President Donald Trump defeats President Joe Biden in November.\n\"I mean, it sounds nuts, but like, I wouldn't be surprised if this guy threw me in jail,\" the New York congresswoman said during an appearance on the \"On With Kara Swisher\" podcast. \"He's out of his mind. I mean, he did his whole first campaign around 'lock her up.' This is his motto.\"\nOcasio-Cortez made the remarks after she was asked what Trump's election would mean for not just the country, but the New York congresswoman's future as a politician.\n\"It is unequivocal that if Donald Trump wins, we are looking at the potential dissolution of democracy in the United States of America,\" said Ocasio-Cortez. \"The question about what would happen to me or the Democratic Party is a joke compared to the question of what is going to happen to our country.\"\nOcasio-Cortez argued that a second Trump term would be far more radical than the first.\n\"I feel like what we saw in his first presidency was an amuse-bouche to what his intentions are,\" said Ocasio-Cortez. \"He has learned from his mistakes of appointing professionals, and he will not make that mistake next time.\"\nThe congresswoman also discussed Big Tech, the progressive movement, and why she believes the lack of a cease-fire in Gaza is making it difficult for Democrats to effectively communicate with younger voters ahead of the 2024 election.\n\"Nobody right now in a millennial space wants to talk about, or advocate, or engage their bullhorn in a way that they feel is undermining or seeking to distract or undercut attention on the atrocity that Palestinians are facing,\" said Ocasio-Cortez. \"So if you are a Democrat that wants to build support among young people, and shore up your support on economic issues, on your message, on health care, on your message, on wages, on jobs, we need a cease-fire.\"\nSwisher also asked the congresswoman about her recent spat with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in a House Oversight Committee hearing, where the Georgia Republican insulted Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett's \"fake eyelashes.\"\n\"Marjorie Taylor Greene's selfishness and narcissism is part of what is screwing over the Republican Party,\" said Ocasio-Cortez. \"While it may be good for her, in a way, she is such an embodiment of their core values that they are trying to distract the public from.\"\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

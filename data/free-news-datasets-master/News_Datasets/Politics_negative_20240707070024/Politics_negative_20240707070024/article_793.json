    "text": "Labour has dropped legal action against five ex-staff members accused of leaking an internal report to undermine Sir Keir Starmer&#039;s leadership. The long-running legal case has cost £1.5million and could have been £900,000 more. The five, who denied it, included Jeremy Corbyn&#039;s communications director Seumas Milne and the ex-leader&#039;s chief-of-staff Karie Murphy. The three others were Georgie Robertson, Laura Murray and Harry Hayball . The report into strife under Mr Corbyn&#039;s leadership of the party was leaked when Sir Keir became its new leader in April 2020. The 860-page document, that included hundreds of Whatsapp messages, found &#039;no evidence&#039; of anti-Semitism being handled differently to other complaints. Labour has dropped legal action against five ex-staff members accused of leaking an internal report to undermine Sir Keir Starmer&#039;s leadership The five, who denied it, included Jeremy Corbyn&#039;s communications director Seumas Milne and the ex-leader&#039;s chief-of-staff Karie Murphy (pictured) The report into strife under Mr Corbyn&#039;s leadership of the party was leaked when Sir Keir became its new leader in April 2020. Pictured: Seumas Milne It also alleged that those who were opposed to Mr Corbyn&#039;s leadership worked against him and damaged the party&#039;s success in the 2017 election. The five affected previously said they would &#039;vigorously defend themselves&#039; in a High Court action and described the claims as &#039;baseless&#039;. An investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office was also not able to dtermine the source of the leak. A joint statement issued on June 6 by Labour and law firm Carter Ruck read: &#039;The Party is discontinuing its legal claims against Karie Murphy, Seumas Milne, Georgie Robertson, Harry Hayball and Laura Murray on a &#039;no order as to costs&#039; basis. &#039;The five welcome the resolution of the claims.&#039; Last year, Labour asked the High Court to delay a full hearing of the case until February next year at the earliest.",

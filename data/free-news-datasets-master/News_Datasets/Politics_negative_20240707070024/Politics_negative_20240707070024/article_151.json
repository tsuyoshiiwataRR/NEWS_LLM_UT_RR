    "text": "Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake was condemned by nine of Arizona's 14 sheriffs Thursday as she attended an event for Donald\nTrump.\nWhile Lake was appearing at a Trump town hall event in Phoenix, the sheriffs sent a letter denouncing Lake for calling Sheriff Mark Lamb, a rival GOP candidate, a \"total coward\" for not bringing election fraud cases.\n\"Kari Lake's recent comment calling Sheriff Mark Lamb a 'coward' is both unfounded and disrespectful,\"\nthe group's letter said. \"We want to make it clear: neither Sheriff Mark Lamb nor any law enforcement officer who wears a badge and uniform, putting the life on the line every day to protect and serve our communities, is a coward. Arizona voters expect better from a political candidate, especially when they are running for the U.S. Senate.\"\nALSO READ:\n‘Journalistic dystopian nightmare’: Inside a Tennessee college media meltdown\nThe letter was signed by Sheriffs Mark Dannels, Adam Shepard, P.J. Allred, William Ponce, Russ Skinner, Doug Schuster, David Clouse, David Rhodes, and Leon Wilmot.\nLake\nmade the remark during a forum for Republican Senate candidates in May.\n\"I have fought for election integrity. I currently have cases in the courts and I know that (Lamb) doesn't think that I'm a fighter,\" Lake opined. \"There's not many people who have the ability to fight. I took every hit fighting for security in our elections. Sheriffs have the ability to fight, and the sheriff of Pinal County cowered. He's a total coward when it comes to election integrity.\"",

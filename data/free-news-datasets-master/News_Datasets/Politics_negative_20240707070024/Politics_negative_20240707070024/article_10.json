    "text": "/ world as we speak information/ On Kabakum seashore in Varna, Mareshki’s mutts attacked Manolova’s crew, and the police let the mutts calmly retreat\nBorisov is making a gift of piece by piece of Bulgarian land to be able to keep in energy. This can be a seashore that’s unique state property. The worth of help for the “Boris Structure” is that this seashore.\nThis was said by the chairperson of the Civic Platform “Stand Up.BG” Maya Manolova to the media at Kabakum Sever-2 seashore as we speak.\nThe seashore was given a concession to an organization near the chairman of the political occasion “Volya” and deputy chairman of the Nationwide Meeting, Veselin Mareshki, in trade for his help for the “draft of the Structure” proposed by Boyko Borisov and his GERB deputies.\nThat is the proof of the self-forgetfulness of Borisov’s servitude. Simply to safe one other day in energy, he is able to give away Bulgarian territory. This seashore was given to Mareshki in rigged procedures, from which the Bulgarian treasury was broken, to be able to safe Borisov some extra political time. The best proof of Borisov’s shame are Mareshki’s servants, added Manolova.\nShe defined that the lease contract for Kabakum Sever-1 seashore was signed for 5 years, ranging from August 27, 2020, with the corporate of Mareshki’s mom, as a result of the MP of Mareshki didn’t pay the hire. By resolution of the Council of Ministers of September 2, 2020, the opposite half of the seashore – Kabakum Sever-2 – was given a concession to the corporate of “Volya” MP Andon Donchev. On September 2, Borisov collected the required signatures for the so-called “new Structure”, added Manolova.\nIt’s clear that Borisov is dying and should be supported by folks like Mareshki. That is what Borisov’s Bulgaria appears to be like like – workers of the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament, Veselin Mareshki, are despatched to assault us on this seashore, which Mareshki considers his property, not the state’s. In accordance with him, we now have no proper to be on this seashore and converse our minds. It’s forbidden to speak about Mareshki on the seashore of Mareshki, commented Manolova on the event of the despatched workers of Mareshki, who claimed that the concession was “pretend information” when the choice of the Council of Ministers entered into power on September 2.\nAfter Mareshki’s workers confirmed aggression in opposition to Manolova and her crew on the seashore, the crew referred to as the police. Three policewomen responded to the sign, who let the boys in black T-shirts retreat, and picked up the info from the id playing cards of Manolova’s crew. Her Fb web page posted reside broadcasts of the altercation with Mareshki’s workers and the arrival of the police.\nManolova emphasised that the opposite seashore, which was additionally given in trade for help for the “Structure of Borisov”, is the seashore in Nessebar.\nWe are going to totally expose the way in which wherein Borisov collects signatures for the so-called “Structure of GERB”. The assaults and cries of Mareshki’s mutts is not going to cease us. We insist that Borissov instantly cancel the scandalous choices of the Council of Ministers to hire part of this seashore for ridiculous cash for 5 years and for the concession for 20 years”, Manolova was categorical and stated that if Borisov doesn’t do it, this concession and the contracts can be topic to the governance assessment after the election and all voters will endure the implications.\n#Manolova #Borisov #giving #piece #piece #Bulgarian #land #order #keep #energy",

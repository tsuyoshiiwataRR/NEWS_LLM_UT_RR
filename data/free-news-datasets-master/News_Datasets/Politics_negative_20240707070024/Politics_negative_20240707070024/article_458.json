    "text": "Despite South Africa’s delegation facing delays in arriving in Uyo for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier against the Super Eagles, the Nigeria Football Federation, NFF, has made it clear that they were not responsible for the situation.\nOn Wednesday night, the South African delegation had to spend the night in Port Harcourt after their arrival in Nigeria was delayed.\nOriginally, the players and their officials were supposed to depart from Johannesburg at 8 am on Wednesday, land in Lagos for immigration procedures, and then proceed to Uyo. However, their chartered flight faced a five-hour delay in Johannesburg, disrupting their travel plans.\nAs a result of the delay, the contingent only reached Uyo on Thursday morning.\nAccording to NFF’s protocol chief, Emmanuel Ayanbunmi, “The delay was not caused by the NFF. Despite informing the relevant Nigerian agencies in Lagos to expedite the necessary formalities, the delay occurred in South Africa without our knowledge.”\nHe further explained, “It was just under two hours before landing that they informed us of their intended landing at Port Harcourt International Airport instead of Murtala Muhammed Airport in Lagos. We had to quickly coordinate with Port Harcourt officials to ensure a smooth process for them.”",

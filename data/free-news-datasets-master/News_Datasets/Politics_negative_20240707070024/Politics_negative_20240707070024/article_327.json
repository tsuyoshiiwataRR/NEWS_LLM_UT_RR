    "text": "The BJP on Thursday hit back at Rahul Gandhi over his 'stock market scam' allegations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. While addressing the press, BJP leader Piyush Goyal said that it's an attempt by Rahul Gandhi to mislead the market investors. Rahul Gandhi has still not overcome the loss in the Lok Sabha Elections. Now, he is conspiring to mislead the market investors. Today, India has become the fifth-largest economy, BJP leader Piyush Goyal said. Stock market fell as investors feared when Congress gained in seats; it is rising now as Modi govt is set to return, Goyal said. Mutual fund industry's size was Rs 10 lakh crore in 2014, it's now Rs 56 lakh crore, Piyush Goyal asserted while highlighting the growth of MF industry. Also Read: PM Modi and Amit Shah directly involved in Tuesday's stock market crash, says Rahul GandhiPiyush Goyal further added that PM Modi has assured the country that in his third term the country will become the third largest economy of the world. 'In the last 10 years of Modi government, for the first time our market cap has crossed over 5 trillion dollars. Today, India's equity market has entered the market cap of the top 5 economies of the world...we know that the market cap of PSUs listed in the market has increased 4 times under the Modi Govt, Goyal added.Talking about NDA's future plans for the country, Piyush Goyal said, All reforms will continue. The country is poised for a bright future ahead. We are delighted that our allies are equally progressive. They support reform, they support what is good for the people of India. They understand that the ten years of the Modi government have taken the country to newer heights and have the confidence that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's able leadership...the big vision with which he has taken the country to today's position of being the world's fastest-growing large economy, they are confident that under his leadership, this country will continue to do better and better and become the worlds third-largest economy while continuing the growth that we are witnessing in the last few years, Goyal added.The BJP's reaction came in the wake of Rahul Gandhi's allegations regarding an alleged stock market scam, in which he even accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah of ‘being directly’ involved in it.“Why did the PM and Union Home Minister give specific investment advice to the five crore families investing in the stock market? Is it their job to give investment advice? Why were both interviews given to the same media owned by the same business group which is also under SEBI investigation for manipulating stock, Rahul Gandhi earlier said on Thursday during a presser at AICC HQ.",

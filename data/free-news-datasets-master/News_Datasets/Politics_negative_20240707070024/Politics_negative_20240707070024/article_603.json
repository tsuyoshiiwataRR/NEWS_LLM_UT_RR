    "text": "It was inevitable that with the 80th anniversary commemorations of the D-Day landings in France, MSNBC’s Morning Joe would politicize possibly the last major anniversary with living veterans by attacking Republicans. Sure enough, co-host Mika Brzezinski did precisely that on Thursday, as she demanded, “with respect,” that party leaders “open their hearts to the concept of democracy.” Brzezinski declared that “You know, Mike Barnicle, it's hard not to think about how demented our politics are today when we look at these heroes and we ponder this moment of unimaginable magnitude, but this conversation reminded me of something I think is worth saying about some of our Republican leaders right now, and I say it with respect, but our democracy is a privilege. It is fragile, and it is a privilege and Republican leaders following Donald Trump's autocratic tendencies are validating and reinforcing his violent anti-democratic ways on such a grand scale.” It got worse from there. Without much respect, she added, “They almost remind me, of sort, of the entitled children of America's democracy. Entitled because they don't care what it took to build it. Unappreciative of the sacrifice that it took to get here and emboldened for their own advancement of power.” [see [NewsBusters ](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/alex-christy/2024/06/06/mika-hopes-d-day-opens-gops-hearts-concept-democracy)for more]",

    "text": "Steve Bannon Prison Sentence Sparks MAGA Meltdown\nRepublicans are straight up losing their minds over the Steve Bannon prison news.\nConservatives launched into melodramatic meltdown mode after a judge sentenced Steve Bannon to\nfour months in prison for defying a congressional subpoena from the January 6 committee.\nRepresentative Matt Gaetz wrote, presumably as he collapsed in slow motion onto a fainting couch, “It is with great sadness and anger that we observe the death of the judicial system in America.”\n“And they’re sending him to prison—not just to torture him but to torture us,” Gaetz added, presumably under the impression the American public will be in shambles without Bannon spewing\nwhite nationalist hate while wearing 17 layers of shirts.\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene was similarly superficially apoplectic,\ndecrying the January 6 committee as “FAKE” and announcing, “The DOJ is completely corrupt!!”\nDroning British giant—and former deputy assistant to Trump—Seb Gorka groaned to a camera\nwhile on a leisurely drive that Bannon was sentenced to prison as part of a “conspiracy to disrupt Trump’s campaign.”\n“The deep state is not the deep state anymore,” Gorka announced at the news of Bannon facing the normal consequences of defying a congressional subpoena. “It’s the in-your-face, we don’t care, we run America, and who you choose for president is utterly irrelevant,” he added before pivoting to boilerplate conservative sound bites and pitching his web streaming show.\nBannon was found guilty on two counts of contempt of Congress in 2022 but delayed sentencing by appealing the decision. That appeal was rejected, and he was sentenced Thursday to report to prison on July 1. Bannon can still appeal the ruling to report to prison.\nThe judicial system, which Gaetz declared is dead, typically sentences people held in contempt of court to prison time: Per the\nU.S. Penal Code, penalties for contempt of Congress include a jail term of a minimum of one month and a maximum 12 months per violation. Whistleblower Chelsea Manning served a two-month sentence for refusing to testify in a federal case investigating military secrets she handed to WikiLeaks in 2010. The judicial system, it seems, has continued operating as it always has when people refuse to testify. But if the meltdown helps the grift, might as well treat the codified consequences of refusing to testify as a sign of democracy collapsing.",

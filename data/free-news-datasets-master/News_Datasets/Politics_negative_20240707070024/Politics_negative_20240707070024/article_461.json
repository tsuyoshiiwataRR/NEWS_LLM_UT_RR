    "text": "An investigation into the operations of private internet service providers in Nigeria has been tasked to the House of Representatives’ Committee on Communications.\nThis directive came after the approval of a motion raised by the representative for Yagba East/Yagba West/Mopamuro Federal Constituency, Kogi State, Mr. Leke Abejide during Thursday’s plenary session.\nCiting concerns, the lawmaker highlighted that many internet service providers in the country have been avoiding responsibility for their inefficient and subpar services. Consumers are often forced to pay for inadequate services due to the lack of clear regulations on pricing and service quality, allowing these providers to take advantage of Nigerian citizens.\nIn his remarks, Abejide, a member of the African Democratic Congress, emphasized that consumers face daily challenges such as service disruptions, slow speeds, and unreliable connections. He stressed the essential nature of a reliable internet connection in today’s digital era.\nHe raised concerns about customers experiencing prolonged service outages without any mechanism for refunds, highlighting the disregard for consumer rights and exploitation by some ISPs.\nSpecifically, he pointed out the questionable practices of an ISP called Legend in Abuja, which charges high flat monthly rates despite frequent service interruptions.\nAbejide criticized Legend for providing reliable service only around the time of monthly billing to deceive customers into renewing subscriptions based on false performance impressions.\nExpressing disappointment in the lack of sanctions by the NCC against ISPs for poor services, Abejide underscored the broader negative impact of these practices on Nigerian society and economic activities.\nThe House instructed its Committee on Communications to investigate the operations of ISPs and present their findings within two weeks.\nAdditionally, they called on the NCC and relevant bodies to establish a consumer protection framework that includes compensation or refunds for extended service outages or deviations from advertised service levels.\nThe lawmakers also urged the NCC to implement a Pay As You Go policy for all ISPs to reduce exploitation where services are not delivered as promised.",

    "text": "Americans are saddled with two inglorious presidential candidates: Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Only 38% of Americans approve of Biden, and 42% approve of Trump, as per the average response that psephologist Nate Silver has computed from the polls on public approval of the two. Both have their committed core supporters. But it looks like the November election will be won, not with the help of supporters, but lost, with the help of those - the so-called 'independents' - who want to keep the other guy out.Last week, a New York jury convicted Trump of falsifying business records for paying $130,000 'hush money' to adult film actor Stormy Daniels, to silence her on her claim that she had an affair with him. Paying hush money is not illegal, nor is having an affair, which Trump denies, with a porn star. Falsifying business records is. It took the jury only 10 hours of deliberation after six weeks of trial to decide on the charges. There is something to be said about a court system that acts fast.The jury's verdict was expected. But its unanimity on convicting Trump on all the 34 charges was not. What has surprised many is the deftness with which prosecutors converted what appeared to be charges towards a faulty bookkeeping misdemeanour to a criminal conspiracy to influence the 2016 elections.Trump's supporters are furious that prosecutors tried to delegitimise Trump's 2016 victory. NY prosecutors, one might say, out-Trumped Trump, who had called for insurrection after the 2020 elections that he and his core supporters believe were rigged.Trump is now a convicted felon. The US constitution does not stop a convicted felon from running for presidency or becoming president. So, will the jury verdict affect voter verdict in the November presidential elections? Trump is the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party. It is a close election, so even a marginal push could be fatal for either candidate.There's little evidence that the conviction has helped either party. Silver's chart of average electoral prediction, based on various polls, did not even budge after the conviction. Trump continues to enjoy a roughly one-point lead over Biden, which falls within the margin of error. The felony verdict proved a financial bonanza for Trump: his supporters contributed $54 mn over the next two days.Trump has shown enormous political survivability. The Senate impeached him, but his support base clings on to him. Felony charges have energised Trump's core supporters and further solidified the Republican Party behind him. They think that Trump is a victim of a political witch hunt. The courts, they argue, are trying to delegitimise Trump's 2016 victory.For most Americans, the NY court case did not reveal anything new. The verdict shows that Trump has lied, he has falsified business records and he is a misogynist. Voters know that, and some even like him for these reasons. Even his supporters don't deny that Trump has fudged his income-tax, and that he is racist. Many approve his plan to be vindictive towards his opponents if he wins the elections.According to one poll conducted before the conviction, about 11% of Trump supporters said that they would not vote for Trump if the Manhattan jury pronounced him guilty. That's a large number for a close election. Still, this response likely suffers from a social desirability bias - respondents are unwilling to admit that even a felony conviction will not change their support for Trump.Besides, even if some Trump supporters leave him, they may not join Biden, thus reducing the blow of their departure. A conviction in May will likely be less impactful by November. The issue is   whether the conviction will affect voters in the six swing states.One thing we can predict with certainty is that the drama of Trump's court cases and conviction will continue. Trump is sure to appeal, and his appeal could be rejected. If rejected, on June 11, the judge will decide whether Trump should be sentenced to a few days of jail and/or whether he should get probation or conditional discharge.Many believe Trump's incarceration is not ruled out. Again, seeing a presidential candidate in jail would have some voters turn against him. But many would consider the sentence excessive and switch their loyalty from Biden to Trump. Ultimately, the next US president will be the least disliked of the two candidates. Voters are not paying much attention to ideologies or electoral promises.",

    "text": "WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. — Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski announced after Thursday's practice that cornerback Greg Newsome II had surgery on the hamstring injury which landed him on non-football injury list . Defensive tackle Dalvin Tomlinson , meanwhile, is scheduled for arthroscopic surgery on his knee on Friday. Stefanski said the hope is that Newsome would be back in time for the regular-season opener Sept. 8 against the Dallas Cowboys. The timeline is a similar one for Tomlinson.\"Same idea,\" Stefanski said after the initial practice at The Greenbrier. \"We'll update you guys as we get more information on those injuries and those are all like we've always talked about injuries. We'll continue to just work through it.\"Newsome and Tomlinson were both surprise additions to the Browns pre-training camp injury list when it was announced Wednesday morning. Newsome was one of two players on the NFI list, while Tomlinson was one of five players placed on the active/physically unable to perform list.\nStefanski did not say when Newsome's hamstring injury actually occurred. He said Tomlinson's surgery was a decision made once he reported for training camp on Tuesday.\"One of those things that you come in, you check everybody physically and then just sometimes you do MRIs and you check in and you make a decision you think is in the best interest for Dalvin,\" Stefanski said. \"The timing of this, obviously no timing is good. But we felt like this is something we can get out of the way.\"\nThis will be Newsome's fourth season in the league after being the No. 26 overall pick in the first round of the 2021 draft. The 24-year-old appeared in 14 games a year ago after dealing with elbow, groin and knee injuries through the course of the regular season.Newsome still managed to record his first two career interceptions, including a game-changing interception return for a touchdown in the Browns' Week 10 win at Baltimore. He also had 49 combined tackles and four tackles for loss.\n\"Yeah, man, it hurt,\" cornerback Denzel Ward said Thursday. \"Greg's a big energy guy for the team, a leader for this team and a great player out there on the field. So we just looking forward to getting him back as soon as possible, but just wishing him the best.\"Tomlinson, 30, was one of the Browns' big free-agent signings a year ago. The eight-year pro played a big role in solidifying the interior of their defensive line over the 16 regular-season games he played. Tomlinson had three sacks, four tackles for loss and 28 combined tackles last season. Chris Easterling can be reached at ceasterling@thebeaconjournal.com.

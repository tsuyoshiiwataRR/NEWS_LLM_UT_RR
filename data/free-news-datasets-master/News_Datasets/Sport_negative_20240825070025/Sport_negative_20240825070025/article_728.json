    "text": "Debate Ederson's transfer request: Is he betraying Manchester City or just looking out for himself? The future of Ederson at Manchester City remains up in the air. Despite spending over 7 years at Etihad and winning over 17 trophies for Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side, the talk surrounding the Brazilian international to leave the Premier League champions continues to intensify. While fans continue to search for the answers regarding his potential departure, an interesting revelation has come to light that has sent many in disbelief. What if we tell you that the star goalie is allegedly pondering a decision to leave just because someone else was praised for their heroics? That someone is City‚Äôs back goalkeeper Stefan Ortega. Well, as per [a bizarre disclosure from journalist Sam Lee](https://x.com/City_Xtra/status/1816413088502907263?t=fFB-11q3-zK4ZTxY4JKoLg&s=08), Ederson was reportedly not impressed by the praise Ortega received for his title-defining save last season. It came during the clash against Tottenham Hotspur while facing Son Heung-min in a 1-v-1 situation. This was just the start for the Brazilian to question his time in the Blue side of Manchester as he further got informed of a suggestion primarily from the Cityzens that Ederson himself would not have been able to save it. Dots were further connected when in the aftermath of the 2-0 win against the North Londoners, the goalie posted a cryptic message on Instagram saying, ‚ÄúNo one understands, but me.‚Äù ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Polls of the day Polls 1 of 4 What do you think is the real reason behind Ederson's transfer request?

Injuries Team chemistry Tactical adjustments Player fatigue What was the most impressive part of Mallory Swanson's performance against Zambia? Breaking Carli Lloyd's record Scoring an Olympic brace Leading USWNT to victory Her overall gameplay Meanwhile, days ago, Guardiola also broke his silence over Ederson‚Äôs transfer links: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. He has to see maybe other options. Of course, I would like him to stay but it depends now on the clubs. I don‚Äôt really know the situation because there are no contacts in the last days and it‚Äôs a question of training and being with us until the transfer window is going to finish. We will see what is going to happen with him.‚Äù Regardless, if the report does prove to be true then it would be a shocker from Ederson. For now, he shall listen to what fans have to say about these rumors. Cityzens tear up Ederson over bizarre reason to allegedly leave Manchester City Fans on X, formerly Twitter are rather bemused to hear the reported reason why Ederson plans to leave Manchester City. Despite knowing that he has remained a starter under Pep Guardiola, many feel it‚Äôs quite odd for him to exit the club on such grounds. This fan has questioned Ederson‚Äôs lack of taking up constructive criticism. Even if fans did question his ability to make the save that Stefan Ortega did, the best way to reply to the criticism would have been to give brilliant performances. But it looks like he is running away from the good criticism. I knew it‚Ä¶ instead of working and getting better he decides it‚Äôs better to runüíÄ ‚Äî Alex (@alexquintani11a) [July 25, 2024] The Brazilian‚Äôs natural response to such criticism should have been to appreciate his teammate and keep working hard to become better. Yet, apparent jealousy can be smelled from Ederson, which also calls for many to question Ederson‚Äôs team spirit. ‚ÄúOh look am jealous of my teammate for making a save that won us the league title..‚Äù What a weird guy ‚Äî Deedy üáßüá™ (@DeedyMCFC) [July 25, 2024] This fan has highlighted the brighter side that the former Benfica man should consider. Though the hard truth remains unchanged, both Ederson and Ortega have certain strengths and weaknesses that make them unique in their own way. But he wouldn't have saved it really, both keepers have their strength ‚Äî Patrick (@PatoEner) [July 25, 2024] Questions are again being raised over City‚Äôs star No. 1‚Äôs sportsmanship and lack of accountability. Ups and downs are part of the game, especially when there‚Äôs a battle between 25+ players to break it into the starting XI every single day. Instead, Ederson is facing superiority complex issues and cannot stand the praise of his compatriot, who took one for the team. Nahhh get out eddie what a snowflake üò≠üíÄ ‚Äî Adezz (@Greatest_Pep) [July 25, 2024] ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Yet another Cityzen looks happy to see the 30-year-old leave the Etihad Stadium, reminding everyone of Joao Cancelo‚Äôs fallout with Pep Guardiola. The right-back had questioned the Spaniard for starting young talents over him, even though he wasn‚Äôt at his best. Selling Ederson can be beneficial for City if they wish to avoid a similar situation. Get him gone that‚Äôs shocking mentality sounds like Cancelo all over again ‚Äî zach (@zach_mcfc) [July 25, 2024] ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Be that as it may, it‚Äôs clear that fans aren‚Äôt impressed to learn the potential reason that may result in the departure of Ederson. For now, let‚Äôs see what developments unfold over his future at Manchester City.",

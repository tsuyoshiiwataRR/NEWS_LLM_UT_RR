    "text": "This is the New York Football Giants , as they say.\nA franchise that has won four Super Bowls. A proud organization entering its 100th NFL season preparing to celebrate their tradition and progress.\nAnd yet when GM Joe Schoen and head coach Brian Daboll were asked this week about their expectations for this landmark season — their third in charge — they avoided setting any at all.\n“For us, it’s, ‘Let’s get ready for training camp,’” Daboll said Wednesday. “Look past, look forward. We have those conversations. But our mindset is we’re happy that today’s here.”\n“I’ll echo what Brian just said,” Schoen said, when asked what ownership expects in 2024. “We’re just trying to get through day one of practice … The good thing with ownership, we have great communication, we talk every day, and they understand where we are and what we’re trying to do. And the focus right now is today. We’re going to continue to build this thing.”\nThose answers are not good enough, though. This is not the stage to skirt a standard that has been set by the great teams of the Giants’ past.\nThis franchise has fallen on hard times, no doubt. And a lack of patience has contributed to the high turnover, inconsistency and disappointments of the last decade-plus.\nBut that does not justify entering the third year of an unproven regime with non-committal, “we’ll see” responses on the subject of making progress and winning.\nIt might be a good public relations strategy to steer clear of committing to any specific goals that can be held against a GM and coach if they fail to meet them.\nDaboll refuted Sterling Shepard ’s assertion last summer that the coach was talking about the Super Bowl behind the scenes before a 6-11 season, for example.\nBut this is a Giants franchise whose most revered leaders, players and stars of years past are the ones who gladly would hit their opponent in the mouth – and who got right back up when they took a proverbial punch.\nThis is an organization feared by its opponents when at its best. It is a franchise that once regularly turned division rivalry games into all-out gridiron wars.\nDaboll, however, wouldn’t even acknowledge the Giants’ need to better compete with the Eagles, Cowboys and other top teams when asked about that obvious and necessary priority.\n“Yeah, I’ll just fall back to it: it’s the first day of training camp,” Daboll said. “Get out there on the grass and start competing.”\nObviously, no one is under the misconception that the Giants are a contender this season, despite the playoff berth of 2022. Schoen said correctly before the draft in April that this roster wasn’t one or two players away.\nStill, it is imperative and far from unreasonable in the modern NFL for proud co-owners John Mara and Steve Tisch to expect their team to at least enter the conversation in the third year of a regime.\nMara has received justified criticism in the past for showing too little patience or pulling the plug prematurely on other rebuild efforts. So he is clearly trying to see this out with Schoen and Daboll to a greater extent.\nBut accepting dysfunction, disappointment and mediocrity is not a part of the deal. This team has too much money invested in key resources to cry “rebuild” this deep into the process and punt on this season’s significance.\nBrian Burns ($28.2 million) is the league’s third highest-paid edge rusher by average annual value, per overthecap.com. Andrew Thomas ($23.5 million) is the NFL’s second highest-paid left tackle.\nDexter Lawrence ($22.5 million) and Bobby Okereke are the ninth highest-paid players at defensive tackle and linebacker, respectively. Daniel Jones ($40 million) is the 13th highest-paid quarterback alongside the Cowboys’ Dak Prescott.\nThe Giants have three former first-round draft picks — including Burns, who was drafted by Carolina — on their starting defensive line. And this is supposed to be a wait-and-see season?\nThere is supposed to be no timeline on expectations for this team to compete at a much higher level despite those contracts, investments and talents?\nThat would certainly be the safest place for an executive or coach to live. But it is not the real world.\nAnd it is certainly not the NFL.",

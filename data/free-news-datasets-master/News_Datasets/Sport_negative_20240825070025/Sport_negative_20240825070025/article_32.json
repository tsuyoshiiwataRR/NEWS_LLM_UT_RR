The 30-year-old who is defending his gold medal in the BMX freestyle from Tokyo, had some of his equipment stolen while en route to the Games in Belgium. Martin shared a video on social media showing the smashed passenger seat window of his van, revealing that his wallet and gear were missing, along with the team physiotherapists' massage table. \"Our van got broken into overnight,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Fortunately, most of our stuff was in our room and we managed to recover a lot of it too. I lost my wallet, backpack and a few other things but overall it didn't end up being too bad. It's unfortunate when people feel the need to do things like this.\" Thanks to bag tracking devices previously placed on his equipment, Martin was able to locate their belongings scattered across a nearby park. \"Our van got broken into last night, luckily my bikes weren't in there, although my bike bags were in there with some things in it,\" he said. \"Crazy start to the trip. Thank god for bag tags.\" [Follow us on X](https://twitter.com/ExpressUSSport) for the best and latest in sports news According to The News in Australia, Anna Meares, the country's chef de mission, has stated that they are working on replacing the stolen items, which include helmets and boots. This incident follows disturbing reports from France of an Australian woman allegedly being attacked and sexually assaulted by five men in Paris, as well as two Nine broadcasters reportedly being attacked during an attempted robbery in the French capital. Martin's journey to the Olympics has been far from smooth, with setbacks including a loss at the World Championships in Budapest and struggles with injuries. \"Since Tokyo... that's been on the radar - you know - winning another Olympic gold medal,\" he expressed. \"For me, it's the pinnacle of sport ... and if you can go out there and win an Olympic gold medal it's the biggest thing ever. And then if you go out there and back it up, it's even bigger.\" The Australian athlete turned professional in BMX freestyle in 2013 and already has one Olympic gold medal under his belt from his victory in Tokyo. Martin is also a two-time World Championship gold medallist, having won in Chengdu in 2017 and Montpellier in 2021, as well as securing a silver medal in 2019. - This article was crafted with the help of AI tools, which speed up the Daily Express editorial research.

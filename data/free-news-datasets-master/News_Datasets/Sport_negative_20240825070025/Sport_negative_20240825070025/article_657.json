    "text": "As the great Monty Python once advised, “Always look on the bright side of life.” When suspicions were confirmed wide receiver CeeDee Lamb would not be attending Cowboys training camp amid a contract stalemate, the more positively-minded of the fanbase took that Monty Python advice to heart.\nA common spin some applied to the holdout situation is how it would open up practice rep opportunities for others down the depth chart. While it’s true the Cowboys are littered with inexperienced receivers desperate for snaps, it’s not exactly a beneficial transaction if it comes at the cost of snaps for Lamb.\nSnaps are valuable for even the most accomplished WRs in the NFL. Practice reps between quarterback and WR are important in improving timing and chemistry. Dak Prescott and Lamb aren’t starting from square one in this regard, but they can certainly still stand to improve.\nAn offer for Cowboys fans For the best local news, sports, entertainment and culture coverage, subscribe to the Austin American-Statesman. $1 for 6 months Cowboys LG Tyler Smith on CeeDee Lamb not being with the team in California: “He’s a huge part of everything we do, for sure. His presence will obviously be missed. But while he’s handling the things he has to handle, we have to handle business as well. The best thing we can do… pic.twitter.com/puDrXPjUIf\n— Jon Machota (@jonmachota) July 23, 2024\nLamb’s presence in camp can also serve as an example to others. Lamb runs routes and makes plays as well as anyone in the league. Getting a firsthand tutorial from the NFL’s best is undoubtedly beneficial for the young developing WR prospects down the roster. With Lamb absent, young players like Jalen Tolbert, Jalen Brooks, Jalen Moreno-Cropper and David Durden don’t get to see that real life example in front of them. One or two extra reps in practice do not make up for that.\npic.twitter.com/74bWLmyC3w\n— Defy (@defytalkcowboys) July 24, 2024\nThe Cowboys have a wildly unproven group of WRs behind Lamb on the roster. Aside from Brandin Cooks, no one has even a modest amount of experience. Working alongside an All-Pro like Lamb would prove useful for their development.\nIt helps the offense is expected to mostly stay the same. Mike McCarthy is in Year 5 of his deal in Dallas and aside from a few wrinkles here and there, is running the same offense in 2024.\nCowboys WR CeeDee Lamb getting work in Houston today.\nCeeDee Lamb on his contract: “it just has to make sense”, according to a source informed.\nI’m told he’s 195-196 lbs. bigger faster and more explosive than previous years.

Yet, nothing quite simulates real practice like real practice, so the sooner Lamb gets to Oxnard, the better.\nOf the three headlining players seeking new deals, Lamb’s situation appears to be the closest to getting done. When exactly is anyone’s guess but the parameters have been set by other top WRs over the offseason so there isn’t much to volley in the way of negotiations.\nMonty Python usually gives excellent life advice but in the case of this holdout, there isn’t a bright side. Hopefully there will be resolution soon.\nAn offer for Cowboys fans For the best local news, sports, entertainment and culture coverage, subscribe to the Austin American-Statesman. $1 for 6 months Articles 6 injured Cowboys (including Mazi Smith) cleared to begin camp, Diggs to PUP 'Dangling Participles': Jerry Jones not aligned with Cowboys fans' angst, 'That's not my life' Explaining IR, NFI, PUP (including Cowboys Trevon Diggs) designations, 2024 changes",

    "text": "By Sam Canfield ,\n4 hours ago The University of Maine football team has suspended its best running back from last year, rising sophomore Tristen Kenan.\n“Kenan has been suspended indefinitely from the football team due to a violation of the UMaine code of conduct,” UMaine’s Senior Associate Athletic Director Tyson McHatten said in an email on Thursday. “The University of Maine does not comment on student conduct cases, proceedings and outcomes.”\nThe 5-foot-10, 195-pound Baltimore native helped keep the Black Bears’ feeble running game afloat last season, accounting for five of UMaine’s seven rushing touchdowns and 462 of the team’s 1,130 rushing yards in just nine games and 110 attempts (4.2 yards per carry).\nAs a team, UMaine ranked 119th of 122 Football Championship Subdivision schools in rush yards per game (79.7), and 115th in yards per carry (3.01) in 2023. UMaine ran the ball 290 total times, attempted 425 pass plays and finished with a 2-9 record .\nKenan was also UMaine’s top receiving back, averaging three receptions and 25.1 receiving yards per game. He caught an 11-yard touchdown pass in a 37-21 loss to UAlbany on Oct. 28.\nBefore UMaine, Kenan was named to Maryland’s All-state team as a junior and senior at Dunbar High School in Baltimore, winning three straight Maryland 1A state championships.\nStepping up to replace Kenan in UMaine’s depth chart will be grad students Tavion Banks and Jaharie Martin, plus sophomore Brian Santana-Fis.\n“I’m just focused on the guys here,” third-year head coach Jordan Stevens said when asked about Kenan’s suspension. “Tavion has great speed and quickness, and Jaharie brings a level of physicality to the team. They’re very durable and have committed themselves to the team.”\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

(Source: Photosport)\nSHARE ME\nAll Blacks Sevens captain Scott Curry says today's quarterfinal loss to South Africa - ruling them out of the medal hunt - is a “massive disappointment\".\nNew Zealand went down 14-7 against the Blitzbok this morning, meaning their medal hopes are gone before the Games' opening ceremony.\n“It comes in waves, one moment you think you’re alright the next you’re in tears - it’s tough,” Curry told 1News.\n“Sevens is so brutal, if you're off by a little bit, you get punished.”\nNew Zealand finished third on the Sevens circuit, meaning there was expectation a medal may be within their grasp.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSouth Africa only qualified in June to take the 12th and final place for the men’s sevens tournament.\n“We have to give credit to South Africa, they scrambled so well, we made some half breaks but they shut us down.”\nThe team are destined to leave Paris without a medal following their quarterfinal loss to South Africa. (Source: 1News)\nCurry said there was a sombre mood in the changing room and there wasn’t much chat about the game itself, rather looking ahead to their remaining two outings at Stade de France.\n“You never know when your last chance is to put that black jersey on. I just cherish every time I get that opportunity and I’ve got two more chances this weekend.”\nThe loss adds to the heartbreak of previous Games, as they bowed out in the quarterfinals in Rio, and narrowly lost the gold medal match in Tokyo.\nThis is Curry's third Olympic Games and could be his last. He was part of the squad that claimed the silver medal three years ago.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe Kiwis had beaten South Africa just yesterday in their pool match 17-5 and were heading into the quarterfinal off the back of a 14-12 comeback win against Ireland earlier this morning.\nAndrew Knewstubb in action for the All Blacks Sevens against South Africa in the Olympic quarterfinal. (Source: Photosport)\nForward Dylan Collier said he thought the team were building well in the tournament as they had made it through pool play undefeated.\n“There’s definitely a lot of hurt in that changing room, we have a day off tomorrow to let it soak in,” said Collier.\n“I’m just looking forward to getting back to the village and calling my kids, that will definitely take my mind off it.”\nAll Blacks Sevens coach Tomasi Cama said his team made too many errors in the early stages and tried to force it against a well drilled South African defence.\nMore on this topic\nOlympics: All Blacks Sevens knocked out in quarterfinals \"A lot of those boys were in tears walking off, they gave everything they had for four years,\" said captain Scott Curry.\n7:45am\n0:25\n“The game is ruthless, in finals footy you can’t hesitate, you have to be decisive and take opportunities. When the opportunities were there we created errors or weren't patient enough to build phases and create another opportunity,” said Cama.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe All Blacks Sevens have a day off tomorrow before playing off for 5th to 8th place on Sunday.\nRugby Olympics Sevens SHARE ME\nMore Stories VIEW MORE More Stories\nGuy Heveldt: Stade de France Olympic success fuels NZ stadium debate\nYes, it's that stadium debate again, but we are already so far behind the times, we must move on a state-of-the-art venue.\n3:50pm\n1:50\nAthletes in action: NZ men's sevens in Olympics quarters, Ferns kick off\nThe All Blacks sevens face Ireland before their guaranteed quarterfinal, while the Football Ferns kick off amidst the Canada spying scandal.\nThursday 2:46pm\nOlympics: All Blacks Sevens into quarterfinals after two wins\nThe All Blacks Sevens have opened their Paris Olympics campaign with wins over Japan and South Africa at Stade de France.\nThursday 7:58am\n0:14\nAthletes in action: Football, sevens kick off NZ Olympic campaign\nThe Paris Games begin before Saturday's opening ceremony, with the men's footballers and All Blacks Sevens first to open their accounts.\nWed, Jul 24\nOlympics: 'Special' - Jazmin Felix-Hotham on watching brother Noah debut\nBlack Ferns sevens player Jazmin talks in Paris about a special sporting weekend for the Hotham family.\nTue, Jul 23\n1:24\nTyla King to retire from international sevens after Olympics\nKing has worn the Black Ferns Sevens jersey since 2012 and has appeared at more than 60 tournaments, the most of any New Zealand women's player.\nWed, Jul 10\nOlympics: All Blacks Sevens into quarterfinals after two wins\nThe All Blacks Sevens have opened their Paris Olympics campaign with wins over Japan and South Africa at Stade de France.\nThursday 7:58am\n0:14\nAthletes in action: Football, sevens kick off NZ Olympic campaign\nThe Paris Games begin before Saturday's opening ceremony, with the men's footballers and All Blacks Sevens first to open their accounts.\nWed, Jul 24\nOlympics: 'Special' - Jazmin Felix-Hotham on watching brother Noah debut\nBlack Ferns sevens player Jazmin talks in Paris about a special sporting weekend for the Hotham family.\nTue, Jul 23\n1:24\nTyla King to retire from international sevens after Olympics\nKing has worn the Black Ferns Sevens jersey since 2012 and has appeared at more than 60 tournaments, the most of any New Zealand women's player.\nWed, Jul 10\nGuy Heveldt: Stade de France Olympic success fuels NZ stadium debate\nYes, it's that stadium debate again, but we are already so far behind the times, we must move on a state-of-the-art venue.\n3:50pm\n1:50\nAthletes in action: NZ men's sevens in Olympics quarters, Ferns kick off\nThe All Blacks sevens face Ireland before their guaranteed quarterfinal, while the Football Ferns kick off amidst the Canada spying scandal.\nThursday 2:46pm\nOlympics: All Blacks Sevens into quarterfinals after two wins\nThe All Blacks Sevens have opened their Paris Olympics campaign with wins over Japan and South Africa at Stade de France.\nThursday 7:58am\n0:14\nAthletes in action: Football, sevens kick off NZ Olympic campaign\nThe Paris Games begin before Saturday's opening ceremony, with the men's footballers and All Blacks Sevens first to open their accounts.\nWed, Jul 24\nOlympics: 'Special' - Jazmin Felix-Hotham on watching brother Noah debut\nBlack Ferns sevens player Jazmin talks in Paris about a special sporting weekend for the Hotham family.\nTue, Jul 23\n1:24\nTyla King to retire from international sevens after Olympics\nKing has worn the Black Ferns Sevens jersey since 2012 and has appeared at more than 60 tournaments, the most of any New Zealand women's player.\nWed, Jul 10\nVIEW MORE RUGBY STORIES The weekend’s sport unpacked.

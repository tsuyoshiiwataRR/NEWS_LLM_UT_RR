The [Paris](https://wwos.nine.com.au/olympics) Organising Committee has been notified about the error that led to the men's hockey team being driven to Stade de France - primarily a rugby or football venue - by mistake, [chef de mission Anna Meares](https://www.nine.com.au/sport/olympics/paris-2024-anna-meares-downplays-security-concerns-toilet-issue-opening-ceremony-20240725-p5jwfz.html) confirmed, while the Australian team has also expressed their feelings about the buses in use. \"Our hockey team unfortunately was taken to the rugby stadium at Stade de France and that was a result of the bus parking in the wrong bay,\" Meares told media.

The Aussie chef de mission confirmed she had been in touch with the Games organising committee about the bus services in place for the athletes. Swimmer Shayna Jack described the start of the campaign as \"chaos\", while sharing a photo on social media of her teammates sitting on the floor of a bus. \"Bus rides to the pool are jam packed … 45 mins to comp pool,\" she wrote. \"No air-con or windows down. \"Bus has also gotten lost. Crazy start to the chaos.\" Meares said communication with Paris officials has been strong so far but said more buses were needed. \"Obviously the welfare of athletes is important,\" Meares added. \"There were a number of athletes waiting in the queue at the transport hall at the village to get out to the venues.

Not good. \"So we're really pressing for the Paris Organising Committee to find a resolution. The good thing is that everything we have raised with them so far they've been very quick to act and we will continue to raise it should this not shift.\" The issues with transport had set things off course for several athletes, Meares confirmed, telling reporters the situation was \"less than ideal\". \"It has disrupted the schedules of our athletes who, for example. have been delayed in their return back to the village missing physio and recovery time allotments,\" she said.

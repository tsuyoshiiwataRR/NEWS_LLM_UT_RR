    "text": "(Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images)\nThe Golden State Warriors may have seen their championship window in the Stephen Curry era come to an end this summer, with star guard Klay Thompson choosing to leave the team in NBA free agency to sign with the Dallas Mavericks and seemingly no one giving this team a chance to compete next season and beyond.\nDespite the fact that the Warriors won‚Äôt intimidate anyone the way the roster is currently constructed with Draymond Green and Curry leading the way, Golden State has frequently been mentioned in trade rumors to acquire Utah Jazz star Lauri Markkanen.\nIf the team can acquire Markkanen, the Warriors could become a force to be reckoned with once again in the Western Conference, as they‚Äôd have that third star in the prime of their career and might be able to put something together.\nHowever, it seems as though Green might be pushing back on the team making some deals recently, as he perceived it as something that would hurt the team in the future rather than helping him and Curry compete for a title right now via NBA Central.\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bad trade, don‚Äôt do that trade,‚Äù Green said.\nDraymond Green says the Warriors nearly made short-term trades beneficial to him and Steph but harmful in the long run, and he advised against them\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bad trade, don‚Äôt do that trade.‚Äù\n(üé• @club520podcast / h/t @ClutchPoints )\npic.twitter.com/r5igSmIvUj\n‚Äî NBACentral (@TheDunkCentral) July 25, 2024\nEven though Green seems to be pushing back on a deal Golden State could be working on, the Warriors brass will do what is best for the team and might want to maximize what they have left with Curry running the show in the Bay Area.\nIt‚Äôll be interesting to see whether the Warriors are able to acquire Markkanen and if that thrusts them back into the title contender conversation.",

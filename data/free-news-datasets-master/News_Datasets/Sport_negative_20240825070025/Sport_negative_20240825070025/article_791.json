    "text": "Golf’s best converge on Minnesota! The Twin Cities are abuzz as the PGA Tour’s 3M Open tees off at TPC Twin Cities Golf Course. As Round 1 gets underway, golf pros are battling at the challenging Minnesota layout, eying for a share of a prize purse of $8.1 million. Remember the final major of the season at Royal Troon, where torrential rains and howling winds pushed the world’s best to their limits? Will the Minnesota skies stay calm and clear, or will the storms that have been looming on the horizon sweep in and shake up the leaderboard? Or most probably add to Jay Monahan’s weather woes [https://www.essentiallysports.com/golf-news-jay-monahans-pga-tour-at-risk-of-fans-wrath-as-the-detroit-events-progress-relies-on-rocky-weather-pga-tour-communications-rocket-mortgage-classic/]? WILL R2 WEATHER PROVE TO BE THE GAME-CHANGER? Fans attending the game at TPC Twin Cities GC on Friday will face an interesting mix of conditions. As per Accuweather [https://www.accuweather.com/en/us/tpc-twin-cities/55449/weather-tomorrow/195589_poi], the day will dawn breezy, setting the tone for a challenging round. Hazy sunshine will break through the clouds, bringing a high temperature of 88°F—but don’t be fooled, as temperatures can soar up to 91°F, making hydration and sun protection a must for all. Meanwhile, a south wind of 14 mph, with gusts reaching up to 29 mph, will throw a curveball into the game. It’s going to force players to rethink their strategy and adjust to the unpredictable ball trajectory. And just when they think they’ve got it figured out, the 34% cloud cover will intervene, casting intermittent sunshine that will play tricks on visibility and temperature. As the morning gives way to the afternoon, the weather at TPC Twin Cities GC will remain stubbornly consistent—hazy and breezy. While the morning’s gusty winds may have subsided slightly, the south-southeast wind will continue to blow at 14 mph. Moreover, gusts reaching up to 27 mph will demand strategic shot-making from players.

Mandatory Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports Compared to the morning’s conditions, the afternoon will feel even more oppressive, with humidity levels rising to 58% and a dew point of 70°F, making the air feel muggy and heavy. The cloud cover will also increase, reaching 47%, moderating the sun’s intensity while maintaining the haze. In short, the afternoon will be more of the same—hot, hazy, and breezy—with players and fans alike feeling the strain of the unrelenting conditions. As the 3M Open continues to unfold, another twist has emerged from outside the leaderboard. BILLY HORSCHEL WITHDRAWS FROM THE 3M OPEN DESPITE RECENT SUCCESS Speaking of unexpected twists, Billy Horschel’s decision to withdraw from the 3M Open comes as a shock, especially after his impressive tied-for-second finish at the Open Championship last week. Horschel’s courageous decision to tee off at the 3M Open earned him even more admiration from fans [https://www.essentiallysports.com/golf-news-heartbroken-billy-horschel-hailed-for-elite-work-ethic-by-fans-after-refusing-to-take-days-off-despite-brutal-loss-the-open-pga-tour/], especially when compared to other golfing greats like Scottie Scheffler [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/scottie-scheffler/] and Rory McIlroy [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/rory-mcilroy/], who decided to sit this one out. On Instagram, Horschel declared, “Still going to 3M. I’ll be on the range at 7:30 Tuesday morning grinding like I always am.” His commitment to his craft is a testament to his passion for golf and resolve to improve. This was evident at the Royal Troon, where his remarkable performance left a lasting impression. Horschel’s withdrawal is a surprising turn of events, especially given his recent success and initial commitment to playing in the PGA Tour event. His decision has left many wondering what could have been for the talented golfer this week. Do you think the same?",

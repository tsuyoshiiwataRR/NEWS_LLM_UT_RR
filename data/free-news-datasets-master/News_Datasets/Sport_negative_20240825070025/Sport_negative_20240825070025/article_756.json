    "text": "Read full article Yahoo Sports A's closer Mason Miller fractures left hand, which could affect whether he's traded Oakland may not trade the low-cost reliever anyway yahoo sports staff Fri, Jul 26, 2024, 4:00 a.m. ¬∑ 3 min read Link Copied\nMason Miller figures to be one of the most popular targets for playoff contenders at the MLB trade deadline. For now, however, the rocket-armed reliever will be unavailable for the next two weeks.\nThe Oakland Athletics placed Miller on the 15-day injured list on Thursday with a fractured pinky finger on his left hand. Yet the broken finger is on his non-pitching hand. And the A's put Miller on the IL retroactive to July 23 , which means he would be eligible to return on Aug. 7.\nAfter Miller's injury was reported, there were differing stories as to how he broke his finger. Initially, Miller reportedly fractured his hand by pounding it on a training table in frustration. Then the story was that Miller \"put his hand down awkwardly\" on the table while preparing to do an exercise, according to MLB.com's Martin Gallegos .\nHowever, A's manager Mark Kotsay indicated that Miller did indeed hurt himself in an emotional outburst.\n\"Out of a little frustration, he just kind of pounded his fist down on a padded training table out of emotion,\" said Kotsay, via MLB.com's Brent Maguire . \"We've all been there, done that.\"\nHere‚Äôs what A‚Äôs manager Mark Kotsay had to say about Mason Miller‚Äôs fractured pinky and the reporting provided by @MartinJGallegos earlier today. pic.twitter.com/bMpYeHnr7O\n‚Äî Brent Maguire (@bmags94) July 25, 2024\nThe prevailing thought is that Oakland is unlikely to trade Miller because he's still under five years of club control after this season. He isn't even eligible for arbitration until the 2027 season when his salary will increase.\nThat currently makes Miller the sort of low-cost asset that a small market team like the A's prefers to keep. And it almost certainly means that Oakland is asking for a huge amount in return for a player that they don't want to ‚Äì or have to ‚Äì trade yet.\nThe A's could also switch Miller back to a starting pitcher, according to The Athletic's Tyler Kepner. He was a starter in the minors before being called up last season and started six games for the A's last season. As a starter, Miller could be an even more valuable asset in the future.\nMiller, soon to turn 26, has struck out 70 batters in 40 2/3 innings with a 2.21 ERA and 15 saves in 34 appearances. He wowed a national audience during the MLB All-Star Game when he hit 103.6 mph on the radar gun. Every one of the fastballs he threw during his appearance was over 100 mph. No MLB pitcher has thrown more pitchers at 100 mph or higher this season than Miller, who's done it 306 times.\nMason Miller going Medieval on Juan Soto . ü•¥\n3 Pitch K: 87mph Slider, 101mph and 102mph ‚õΩÔ∏è\nOverlay of Slider & 102mph FB at the end. pic.twitter.com/wT37jeVxSL\n‚Äî Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) April 26, 2024\nIn the meantime, Oakland activated pitcher Ross Stripling from the 15-day IL to take Miller's place on the roster.\nThis likely won't be the last time Miller is discussed as a strong trade possibility for the A's. It just might not happen this season, broken hand or not.",

    "text": "The\nMatildas’ Olympics campaign is now on life support after an embarrassing first-up effort against powerhouse Germany.\nThe Germans ran rings around the Aussies in the 3-0 thumping, with several Matildas stars having very quiet afternoons.\nThe Matildas’ pool was dubbed the ‘group of death’ ahead of the Olympics ... and now they have one foot in the grave.\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app:\nDownload today\nAnd fans took aim at the highly popular Mary Fowler after the young gun striker put in a shocker.\n“Mary Fowler is such a frustrating player. Like many creatively brilliant players before her, she just blows so hot and cold,” one fan said on X (formerly Twitter).\nOthers said they barely saw Fowler throughout the game.\n“Can Mary Fowler like touch the ball or something ... I honestly didn’t even know she was on the pitch,” another fan fumed.\nAnd another: “Horrible performance! Two worst players on the pitch are my two favorite players in the WSL - Mary Fowler & Alanna Kennedy.”\nAnd another: “Poor first half. as usual, overrated Mary Fowler nowhere to be found.”\nIn a rare moment when Fowler did have an opportunity in front of the net, she ended up being dispossessed when she turned to fire in the box.\n“Mary Fowler? More like Mary only had 3 touches this game,” another fan raged.\nWhile another thought Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson was in part to blame.\n“Tony does not know how to use Mary Fowler,” another fan observed.\nFowler, of course, was not the only one to blame for the humbling loss, and there was plenty of tension in defence as well.\nAt one point Alanna Kennedy flashed a tense look at Ellie Carpenter as Germany scored again to make the Aussies look silly.\nSocceroos great Craig Foster said during the commentary that the defence was all at sea.\n“Alanna and Ellie got themselves mixed up there,” he observed.\n“Elie was going the wrong way and her defender has come in. Her body position, she wasn’t quite able to see.”\nAnd commentator Amy Chapman was scathing.\n“It was a lack of concentration particularly at that far post,” she said.\n“It was a really simple chipped in corner and at the international level you do not concede those. A bit of ball watching at the back post.”\nAfter the match Matildas captain Steph Catley did not single out players, but said the team’s performance wasn’t to her “standards”.\n“It’s definitely a wake up call,” Catley said on Nine.\n“That’s tournament football.\n“We’ve got two more games and we’ve got to turn it around quickly.\n“We’ve got a lot to learn from here. I think at times we were on top and we let two set pieces affect the game in a very negative way.”\nThe Matildas have a chance to redeem themselves when they face Zambia on Monday morning (3am AEST).\nThey then play their final pool game against the USA on Thursday.\nStream free on",

    "text": "Hubert Hurkacz has come to his own defense after the criticism directed at him for skipping the Paris Olympics as the Polish tennis star claims the majority of the doctors he has spoken to have told him that he shouldn't play again until the Australian swing in January.\nAfter injuring his knee at Wimbledon earlier this month, Hurkacz took to Instagram on Monday to share that he wouldn't be able to compete at the Olympics.\nSince Hurkacz was expected to be one of the top Polish athletes and was also due to team up with Iga Swiatek in the mixed doubles and with Jan Zielinski in the men's doubles, some weren't happy about his decision at all. And that included Polish Olympic Committee President Radoslaw Piesiewicz, who said that he was hearing that Hurkacz would be ready to play.\n“We fought for the Olympics… it didn't work out. I couldn't play in Paris, it would have been dangerous. Right after the injury, I talked to the doctors and eight out of ten said that realistically I could only play in Australia,\" Hurkacz told\nEurosport.\nHow the Polish Olympic Committee President reacted to the Hurkacz news?\nOn July 4th, Hurkacz injured his knee during a diving attempt at the net. Moments after the injury happened, Hurkacz was evidently in some major pain and discomfort - and although he was instantly checked by the doctor - he was able to resume the match for only two points before retiring to Arthur Fils.\n\"We were counting on Hubert flying to the Olympics, getting his act together. We were in constant contact with the Polish Tennis Association. The message was that everything was going well and Hubert would be healthy. Yesterday, what happened happened. I called the manager right away. We talked, I made her realize how important it was for Hubert to be there. I was waiting for a return call with a decision. I never got it,\" Polish Olympic Committee President Piesiewicz said after Hurkacz's withdrawal.\n\"It's (Hubert Hurkacz) and his team's decision. I respect it, but I don't understand it. Polish sport and Polish fans lose out on this. This is a huge loss. We keep our fingers crossed for Hubert to recover as soon as possible and fight for Slams, not medals anymore.\"",

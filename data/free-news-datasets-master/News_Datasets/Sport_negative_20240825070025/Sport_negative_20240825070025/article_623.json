    "text": "I can hear her footsteps coming down the hallway, the great uncheatening is here.Is he afraid of meeting Novak? That can’t be true! Surely somebody will step in and make sure readers aren’t cheated\nI'm just disgusted. It's so obvious for years now what is he doing.Is he afraid of meeting Novak? That can’t be true! Surely somebody will step in and make sure readers aren’t cheated\nIt's not guys on this forum he should be compared with38 years of age, body still looking better than 95% of the guys from this forum.\nI hope he plays, match against Novak would be epic and I would enjoy every single moment of it, no matter the winner. If he decides to pull out of Olympics, I can understand that decision would be only due to some injury. I cheer for Rafael Nadal.\n38 years of age, body still looking better than 95% of the guys from this forum.\nI hope he plays, match against Novak would be epic and I would enjoy every single moment of it, no matter the winner.

That can’t be true! Surely somebody will step in and make sure readers aren’t cheated\nPlease, I didn't expect this comment from you.\nThe rumors suggest he has felt pain in the right thigh, which is the reason why he skipped the practice with Zverev.\nIf he were to skip the Olympics due to injury, you're the last person I'd expect childlishly saying \"hE's ScArEd Of NoVaK\".\nThat would be unclassy, and I know you're better than that. It'd be like mocking Novak when he skipped RG saying \"hE's ScArEd Of AlCaRaz\".\nThis is why I said playing Bastad was dumb. He should've gone all in on doubles prep instead of killing himself just to try to win a 250 in singles with the Olympics right around the corner.\nHe needed match play. He barely played in like a year and half.This is why I said playing Bastad was dumb.

It'd be like mocking Novak when he skipped RG saying \"hE's ScArEd Of AlCaRaz\".\nHe also started practicing after just 24 hours when he was already spent in the final. Dumb move tbh. He needed to rest 2-3 days.He seemed fine in Bastad?\nIt would be a shame if he can't make it\nHe shouldn't even play Olympic singles. He just needs doubles practice.Playing bastad was never dumb if he wants to play the Olympics, he needs practice, he cannot just rest for 2 months and then waltz into the olympics directly. If he wants to compete then he would like to be competitive obviously.\nAssuming he really is injured, he would be silly to compete in the singles, perhaps the doubles as he and Carlos would be a big attraction.\nThe Tennis Letter\n[https://x.com/TheTennisLetter]\n[@TheTennisLetter]\nCarlos Moya says Rafa Nadal suffered a ‘setback’ in practice yesterday & has been dealing with a thigh issue, he can’t guarantee he will compete in the Olympics “I can’t assure you Nadal will play.” “Today it was decided to rest to give him more time to recover from the setback that occurred yesterday. Let’s see if he can be ready tomorrow.” “The most responsible thing right now with an event of this magnitude is not to force it”\nWhy are you offended? It's obvious that only after draw he \"got tight\". And so he can play doubles and not singles? Are we all dum or what? And he played for hours only few days ago, said no problems. Yeah, I guess we are stupid and will swallow this crap (if really happens)...Please, I didn't expect this comment from you.\nThe rumors suggest he has felt pain in the right thigh, which is the reason why he skipped the practice with Zverev.\nIf he were to skip the Olympics due to injury, you're the last person I'd expect childlishly saying \"hE's ScArEd Of NoVaK\".\nThat would be unclassy, and I know you're better than that.

Dumb move tbh. He needed to rest 2-3 days.\nGlad you drew that conclusion, slayYeah, you better than him, he only plays tennis whole life...\nIts as if Team Nadal read my earlier thread...Let’s wait and see either way. It’s not like he was ever winning gold but I hope he plays.\nPerhaps, but he should have withdrawn in Sweden after that 4-hour match, as a winnerHe needed match play. He barely played in like a year and half.\nHe shouldn't even play Olympic singles. He just needs doubles practice.\nIts nothing to do with Djokovic lol. Nadal has never said he plans to retire this year, and the USO is round the corner. Plus, like i have said on other threads, there will be more players getting 'injured', these Olympics are not that pleasant to be in!Nadal is reluctant to Meet Djokovic without being in shape to go toe to toe because he doesn't wanna be outclassed completely and that be the last memory of his fans against his rival Novak.\nand who would blame him anyways? Djokovic is still making wimbledon final, he is in that good shape compared to anyone of 1980s gen like Nadal/Monfils/Stan/Murray/retired Roger.... So it won't be pleasant to face Novak because you will be up against a top player in the world, it is as deadly as facing zverev/med/anyone out there, Novak at this point is only below Alcaraz and possibly Sinner too. His conditioning is far better than Nadal even with his kneecap on... So Nadal is definitely reluctant.\nJoke backfired there mate lol.I’m just having fun at the expense of some expert uncheaterers\nIts nothing to do with Djokovic lol. Nadal has never said he plans to retire this year, and the USO is round the corner. Plus, like i have said on other threads, there will be more players getting 'injured', these Olympics are not that pleasant to be in!\nThen doubles is also useless, why is he even playing olympics\nBecause he has a chance to medal in Doubles. He barely has to move for Doubles.\nIt is his last medal opportunity. I don't care about Doubles but to him a medal is a medal.\n38 years old and constantly getting injured after tough matches.Who has ever beaten him at Roland Garros? Nobody! We can throw out the Zed match.\nOnly Djoker and Soderling. And he avenged those losses. To our mind Rafa is essentially undefeated at Roland Garros.\nThe King Of Clay is always a threat until proven otherwise.\nWhat part of 100-2 do people not understand?\nHmm yes, I didnt think of that... who is his partner? Alcaraz ?\nHe can def win a medal...\nUtter nonsense. Both dont back down from a fight, never have never will. People assumed Nadal was retiring, he never said he was this season.It has everything to do with Djokovic, he is facing him in round 2 and he doesn't think he will be able to play into form.... he prob would not have skipped if Djoker was on the other draw.\nThese guys don't like to face each other without being in a shape to compete to have a chance, they might as well lose to random people than take free losses. Nadal would have taken a L if he felt he had a small chance of winning but in this case he meets in R2 and he feels no shot at all...\nThis story broke after my threadApparently Nadal is confirmed for doubles and doubtful only for singles:\nHe's never been shy about strategically ducking people. Reminds me of Canelo- or vice versa.Nadal is reluctant to Meet Djokovic without being in shape to go toe to toe because he doesn't wanna be outclassed completely and that be the last memory of his fans against his rival Novak.\nand who would blame him anyways?

It would be fantastic to watch him play Djokovic in R2. What a treat for the fans of tennis, no?\nHopefully he won't withdraw from the singles event.

    "text": "In a rather daring move, the [Las Vegas Raiders](https://www.totalprosports.com/nfl/las-vegas-raiders/) have decided to poke some fun at [Kansas City Chiefs](https://www.totalprosports.com/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs/) quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his so-called “Kermit the Frog” voice. Patrick Mahomes has embraced jokes from his teammates about his voice. During Mahomes’ 2018 season (his first as Kansas City’s starting QB), tight end [Travis Kelce](https://www.totalprosports.com/tag/travis-kelce/) [said](https://sports.yahoo.com/one-way-describe-patrick-mahomes-voice-stuck-like-cookie-monster-kermit-frog-021538374.html) the quarterback’s voice is “stuck between like, the Cookie Monster and Kermit the Frog.” It’s one thing for Mahomes’ teammates to tease him in a friendly matter, but it’s probably not a good idea to taunt him if you’re an opponent. And the Raiders are bound to learn this the hard way. On Thursday, a video of Raiders rookie defensive back Trey Taylor and his teammates taunting Patrick Mahomes went viral. Taylor held up a Kermit the Frog puppet with a Chiefs jersey and a wig resembling Mahomes’ hair, and then they proceeded to mimick the quarterback’s voice: Also Read: [NFL Fans Are Scratching Their Heads After Jerry Jones Strangely Compared Himself To 3-Time Super Bowl Champion Patrick Mahomes](https://www.totalprosports.com/nfl/fans-are-scratching-their-heads-after-jerry-jones-strangely-compared-himself-to-3-time-super-bowl-champion-patrick-mahomes/) Patrick Mahomes usually stays away from public trash talk, but it’s safe to say that he won’t forget this when the Raiders and Chiefs clash for the first time this season in Sin City on Oct. 27. Click on ‘Follow Us’ and get notified of the most viral NFL stories via Google! [Follow Us](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLHdqwswrujDAw) The second meeting between the Raiders and Chiefs will take place at Arrowhead Stadium in Week 13 on Black Friday. The Raiders’ two wins over Mahomes took place in Kansas City (Week 5 of 2020 and Week 16 of last year). Patrick Mahomes Owns The Raiders It’s not a good time to remind Raiders fans that Mahomes is 10-2 against them for his career, with a 66.2 completion percentage and 30 touchdowns against only four interceptions, per [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MahoPa00/splits/). Mahomes is the type of player that you better have an answer for if you’re going to taunt him the way the Raiders did here. And for the most part, they haven’t. But hey, at least they’re adding more intensity to an already heated rivalry.

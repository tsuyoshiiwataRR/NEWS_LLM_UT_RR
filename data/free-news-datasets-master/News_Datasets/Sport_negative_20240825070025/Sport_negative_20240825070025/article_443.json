    "text": "Drama in Bordeaux! Historic Girondins Bordeaux Renounces Professional Football Club Status The historic French club will disappear due to economic instability and its players will be free. Sad news from France: According to “Sud Ouest,” the historic club Girondins de Bordeaux has informed the French Football Federation (FFF) that it will give up its professional football status, which it has held since 1937. On Tuesday, the French club was relegated to the third division due to financial instability for a second-division club, and now it faces potential extinction.\nThe Bundesliga Will Test Ball Contact Technology\nThis situation has serious implications for others, as players, staff, and coaches under Albert Riera will have their contracts dissolved and will become free agents. Additionally, the team’s training center will lose its accreditation, so youth players will also be released, and if they find new teams, Girondins won’t receive any compensation.\nGirondins is leaving as a historic team in France, with six French league titles in its trophy cabinet, the last one in 2008 under Laurent Blanc. The club also boasts four French Cups, three League Cups, three Super Cups, and an Intertoto Cup. The team will also be remembered for reaching the UEFA Cup final in 1995-96, where they lost to Bayern Munich.\nPlayers like Zinedine Zidane, Bixente Lizarazu, and Christophe Dugarry are examples of the greatness Girondins once had, featuring world-class talent that was exported to clubs where they became international football stars.\nRonald Araujo Begins Recovery with Barcelona\nThis is the sad reality for a once-great and historic team that has lost its way and hit rock bottom. Today, Girondins looks to the future, facing only extinction and the collapse of what was once a major European club.",

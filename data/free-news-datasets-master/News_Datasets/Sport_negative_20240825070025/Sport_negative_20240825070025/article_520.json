    "text": "The subject of trade rumors as Tuesday's deadline approaches, [Oakland Athletics](/mlb/team/_/name/oak/oakland-athletics) All-Star right-handed closer [Mason Miller](http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/4730225/mason-miller) landed on the 15-day injured list on Thursday with a fracture of his left pinky finger. The move is retroactive to Tuesday. To fill Miller's spot on the 40-man roster, the A's activated right-hander Ross Stripling (elbow) to start Thursday night's series opener against the host [Los Angeles Angels](/mlb/team/_/name/laa/los-angeles-angels). Per MLB.com, Miller broke the finger while preparing to exercise in the trainers' room inside the A's clubhouse after Monday's win over the [Houston Astros](/mlb/team/_/name/hou/houston-astros). The rookie placed his left hand on the training table in an awkward position, causing the injury. Miller had sealed the 4-0 victory with an 11-pitch, 1-2-3 ninth inning. However, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Miller was apparently frustrated about something after the game and pounded his left hand on a table. Miller, 25, has five years of team control remaining after this season, but his electrifying stuff has contenders interested in obtaining his services. In 34 appearances in 2024, he is 1-1 with a 2.21 ERA and 15 saves and leads all relievers with 70 strikeouts in 40 2/3 innings. Miller also leads MLB with 306 pitches at 100 mph or harder and broke the record for the fastest pitch in All-Star Game history at 103.6 mph (since pitch-tracking began in 2008). He fired a perfect inning, striking out [Shohei Ohtani](http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/39832/shohei-ohtani) and [Trea Turner](https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/33710/trea-turner) en route to earning the win. Since making his major league debut with Oakland last season, Miller is 1-4 with a 2.92 ERA in 44 games (six starts) with 15 saves and 108 strikeouts in 74 innings.

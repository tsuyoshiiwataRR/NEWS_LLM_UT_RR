    "text": "Mornar tried to surprise the favored Radnički from Kragujevac in Leskovac, but the first match of the second qualifying round of the Conference League went to the host at the new stadium \"Dubočica - 1:0. Jeina's goal was scored by Milan Aleksić in the 72nd minute. He headed the ball from the penalty area under the crossbar of the phenomenal goalkeeper Stefan Popović, after the winger from Guadalupe, Bevis, brilliantly crossed from the right side. It is Baran's first defeat in the European Cups, after a win and a draw with Dinamo Tbilisi in the first round of qualification. Radnički showed more, acted as a more coordinated team, which should not be surprising if you know that they played with the same team last season and the championship, unlike ours, has already started in Serbia. \"We knew that they were going to test us on the wing, they noticed that they were there during the analysis of their game. In the first half, they were the better opponent, they created some chances, but we stood up well. In the second, we evened the game and had a goal from Milan. Vušurović, several dangerous shots, but we conceded that goal after a throw-in from the side,\" said Mariner's offensive midfielder Darko Zorić. It was he who warmed the palms of the home goalkeeper Luka Lijesković twice in the first half, but Mornar was dangerous in the second half, especially when the score was 0:0, when Vušurović, after great action and passes from Balša Dubljević, shot unhindered from 13 meters across the goal in 52nd minute. \"We will have a chance in the second leg, we tried to attack tonight, but in front of our fans we will attack even more and we will certainly be even more organized,\" Zorić promised. Radnički did create many more chances, especially from the 17th to the 28th minute when Popović saved his team several times. Mostly after the shots of the Croatian international Tomislav Dadić, or the insertion of Aleksić from the \"second plan\". The Tunisian Sahli also had a great opportunity. Marko Đurišić almost \"undone\" all that in the 90th minute with a great shot from about 20 meters, but Lijeskić did not let himself be surprised. \"Barani didn't surprise us with the game, we knew they were an organized team, but we managed to create chances. We controlled the game, we were confident on the ball, engaged and deservedly celebrated,\" said Aleksić after the match. WORKERS 1923 - SAILOR 1:0 Leskovac - Stadium \"Dubočica\".

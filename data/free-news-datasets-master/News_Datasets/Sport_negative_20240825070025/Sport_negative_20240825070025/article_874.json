    "text": "by Reemus Fernando\nKalutara Education Zone is home to over 150 public schools and dozens of International Schools. When the Athletics Championship of this zone commences hundreds of athletes converge on the event venue hoping to test their abilities and book their berths in the Western Province Championships. Vernon Fernando Stadium, Kalutara where this event has been held since 2019 becomes overcrowded with the massive influx of student athletes. The number of athletes arriving at this stadium for the Zonal championships has increased drastically since the year 2020 as the cash-strapped Western Province Education Ministry put an end to the Divisional Championships that year.\nThe massive participation has wrecked havoc at the Kalutara Zonal Athletics Championship 2024 which commenced early this week. The 100 metres sprints of some age categories had more than 100 participants lining up for heats. Such heats which commenced in the morning were still going on in the afternoon session yesterday.\nThe organisers were still struggling to complete the third dayâ€™s events schedule when this copy was filed around 6.30 pm yesterday.\nThe large participation of school athletes also attract large number of parents to the competition venue increasing the work load of officials.\nThe root cause of the problem lies in the absence of Divisional Championships which would have promoted only the best from the respective divisions to the zonal championships.\nIt was at Divisional Championships that many a national athletes tested their skills first. Kalutara Zone has four Divisions namely, Kalutara, Panadura, Beruwala and Dodangoda. But since 2021 none of these Divisions have conducted their Divisional athletics championships due to lack of funds. Beruwala Division which is home to more than 50 schools is one of the badly affected areas due to the absence of the Divisional Championship.\nAthletes who are unable to win at Zonal level have a greater chance to win a podium position at Divisional level. Such victories provide motivation for them to continue the sport.\nHowever in team sports authorities had taken steps to conduct Divisional Championships before promoting the best two teams to the zonal level. With track and field sports attracting the highest number of participants from schools it is incumbent upon authorities to recommence Divisional Athletic Championships.",

    "text": "What in the name of Tim Horton’s is going on in Canada these days? In a truly amazing story, the head coach of the Canada women’s national team, Bev Priestman, was unceremoniously sacked due to her usage of drones to spy on Canada’s opponents (per [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40642277/olympics-2024-canada-women-soccer-coach-removed-drone-scandal)): Canada’s women’s national team head coach Bev Priestman has been removed from the country’s Olympic team over a scandal involving the use of drones to spy on opponents’ practice, the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) announced Thursday. The COC said it made the decision after Canada Soccer decided to suspend Priestman for the remainder of the tournament. The episode began earlier this week when Canada’s opening opponent New Zealand complained to the International Olympic Committee’s integrity unit after it said drones were flown over closed practice sessions. But wait....there’s MORE — and it (loosely...okay VERY loosely) involves [Bayern Munich](https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com) star Alphonso Davies. The Canadian espionage is not just limited to the women, though. The men’s squad was — allegedly (we don’t need Marty McSorley hunting us down!) — also complicit: The announcement followed a report from TSN that both Canada’s women’s and men’s soccer teams have used drones to record opponent’s closed-door training sessions for several years, including during the women’s team’s gold-medal winning Tokyo Olympic tournament in 2021. As for Davies, we’ll just assume he didn’t need drone footage to do his business...okay? Anyway, what a mess, eh? Here’s to hoping that the coaching staff at least uttered the words of the immortal Doug McKenzie from Strange Brew after finishing up those now-infamous film sessions: “We hope you enjoyed the beer, oh, like I mean the movie, eh.” Looking for some thoughts on Bayern Munich’s rumored handling of the roster during this season — and why the club might be trying to force some players leave? What about the latest transfer news on Matthijs de Ligt, Xavi Simons, and Désiré Doué, plus a strong take on why it would be great to see Niklas Süle get his footballing life together? Awesome!

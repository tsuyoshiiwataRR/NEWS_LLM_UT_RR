    "text": "TEAM GB have been forced to bring their own chef to the Olympics after complaints of raw meat being served in the athlete’s village.\nBritish stars are now eating at a nearby performance base after organisers were accused of failing to prepare food properly.\nNot only that, but the Olympic village is also suffering from a shortage of key items\nincluding protein-rich eggs and chicken.\nThe gaffe comes just one day before the opening ceremony in Paris, with 15,000 athletes set to represent their respective nations in a floating parade on the Seine.\nAfter being served raw meat,\nTeam GB stars are now making their way to nearby Clichy.\nThe\nBritish Olympic Association has hired a catering college to serve as a performance base.\nAnd it has now turned into the team’s main food hub, with specialist chefs flown out to deal with the flow of hungry athletes.\nClichy is just 15 minutes away from the village by car.\nSome competitors are even bagging up extra meals to bring back to their rooms.\nAnd Team GB chief executive Andy Anson has warned Olympic beaks to sort out the mess in their own cafeteria quickly.\nMost read in Olympics\nOLYMPICS FREE BETS - SIGN UP OFFERS AND DEAL FOR PARIS 2024\nHe said: “At the beginning of every Games there’s usually two or three issues.\n“The big one this time is the food in the village, which is not adequate.\nWhat's happening today at The Games?\nWHAT TO WATCH TODAY...\nParis 2024 Olympics - Day -1\nWomen's handball and archery gets underway today while the Rugby sevens continues with some quarter-final action.\nSpain, Brazil and Germany are all in action in the women's football as well.\nClick here for\nall the events taking place at Paris 2024 today.\nFollow all the action as it unfolds with our\nParis 2024 Olympics LIVE blog.\n“There are not enough of certain foods: eggs, chicken, certain carbohydrates.\n“And then there is the quality of the food, with raw meat being served to athletes.\n“They have got to improve it over the next couple of days dramatically.\n“Our athletes have decided they would rather go and eat in our performance lodge in Clichy.\n“So we are having to get another chef to come over as the demand is far exceeding what we thought it would be.\nRead More on The US Sun\n“The athletes are not going there just to eat their lunch, they are packing meals for their dinner as they don’t want to go into the athlete restaurant to eat.\n“So we are trying to make sure our athletes have an advantage by having more food.”\nParis Olympics with 300k condoms\nThe Olympic Games arrive at the \"City of Love\nNearly 15,000 residents - around 10,500 of which are athletes - will be cramming into the Olympic village between July 26 and August 11.\nTo ensure the athletes feel at home, a number of provisions have been made by organisers.\nOne of these is the stocking of some 300,000 condoms, in theory enough for around two every day during the run of the Games.\nA number of Olympic athletes have opened the door on their steamy lives behind-the-scenes when in camp, including huge sex orgies and parties.\nLondon 2012 had claimed the title of \"the raunchiest Games ever\", but the 150,000 condoms ordered paled in comparison to the 450,000 ordered for the Rio Games four years later.\nCondoms have been laid on by organisers at every game since Seoul 1988, when it they were used to spread awareness of HIV and AIDS.\nEven with an intimacy ban at Tokyo 2020 due to Covid-19, some 150,000 johnnies were handed out.\nRead the\nfull story here.",

    "text": "By Sam Canfield ,\n6 hours ago Following back-to-back 2-9 campaigns and a 13th-place finish in the Coastal Athletic Association in 2023, the University of Maine football team has been polled to finish in the same standing this fall.\nThe poll, which was released on Wednesday, was voted on by coaches from all 16 member schools.\nLast July’s preseason poll also had UMaine finishing 13th in the Coastal Athletic Association standings, which is ultimately where the Black Bears wound up with a 1-7 in-conference record. Third-year head coach Jordan Stevens expressed his lack of concern toward the unsettling poll results, calling them “irrelevant.”\n“I’m not even concerning myself with the preseason rankings. It’s all based off last year,” Stevens said. “With the ever-changing college football landscape, there’s not a time when it could be more irrelevant to compare years.”\nReigning tri-champions Villanova (nine first-place votes; 217 points), UAlbany (one first-place vote; 189 points) and Richmond (three first-place votes; 179 points) topped the poll, after finishing with 7-1 in-conference records and progressing to the 24-team Football Championship Subdivision national playoffs last year.\nWednesday’s poll listed the Black Bears with 57 points and zero first-place votes.\nTo Stevens’ point, the 2023 preseason poll listed Villanova at seventh, UAlbany at 11th and Richmond at third. Reigning conference co-champion William & Mary topped the preseason poll with 13 first-place votes, but finished seventh with a 4-4 conference record (6-5 overall).\n“We’re looking ahead to the season,” Stevens said. “We’ve returned a resilient group and added some high character guys.”\nStarting quarterback Derek Robertson transferred to Monmouth University this winter and top running back Tristen Kenan has been suspended by the team, but UMaine has added fifth-year transfers Carter Peevy of Mercer and Jaharie Martin of Montana State to replace them, respectively.\nIn total, UMaine is returning six offensive starters and seven defensive starters, while onboarding 11 transfers. Among the offensive returners are grad students Joe Gillette and Cooper Heisey, who earned All-CAA Preseason Honorable Mention honors.\nGillette, a wide receiver who transferred from Lafayette College in Pennsylvania prior to the 2023 season and has beaten cancer twice , was UMaine’s leading receiver last season with 570 yards and five touchdowns through 36 receptions. Heisey, a tight end who previously played three years for Rutgers, reeled in 22 catches for 187 yards and three touchdowns last year.\n“Both have been tremendous additions, and are very reliable,” Stevens said. “Joey could have finished with the most receiving yards in the conference, and provides value in our return game. Cooper is an unwavering leader, stays connected to blocks, and is [trusted] having the ball in his hands.”\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

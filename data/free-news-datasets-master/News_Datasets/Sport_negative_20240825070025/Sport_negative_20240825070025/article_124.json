    "text": "Dana White flinches and security intervene as Leon Edwards lunges at UFC 304 opponent Belal Muhammad Leon Edwards lunged at Belal Muhammad which gave UFC president Dana White a brief scare. Edwards will defend his UFC welterweight title against American challenger Muhammad this Saturday on UK soil at the Co-op Arena in Manchester. The pair met at a press conference to preview their fight and were brought together for a tense final face-off. Immediately, the pair surged forward and went nose-to-nose as security came closer to the pair on red alert in case things became physical. Muhammad made the first move by putting his knuckles up to Rocky's head as if emulating his planned KO blow. Read More In UFC The champion was unfazed, and tried a gag of his own as he jokingly lunged at his opponent in a bid to make him flinch. 'Bully' looked ready to go there and then, but UFC kingpin White was the one that flinched, clearly in fear of a physical altercation causing chaos on stage. Muhammad stayed pretty still, but was clearly wound up and ready to go during their final fighting talk. Luckily he was able to step in between the pair, with Edwards taking a step backwards before security grabbed hold of the fighters. They were bundled their separate ways by the security as tensions simmered, but no further confrontation was able to take place.

It is not the first time that tensions rose between the pair this week, as they got into the same lift at a fighter hotel. As Edwards exited the elevator, a verbal exchange unfolded between the pair, but luckily their teams were on hand to prevent anything from escalating. Edwards goes into the contest as the huge favourite given his undefeated streak and frightening KO record . And current middleweight champion Israel Adesanya believes it will be the Birmingham native who finishes the bout before the final bell. \"Belal's got pressure, man,\" he said. \"He's able to get to people and put his will on them. \"For Leon, just seems like, he's on a massacre right now. He's on a run. I don't think it's gonna be much different [than the Colby Covington fight]. Leon might finish him. \"I think Leon finishes this fight. Trying to think, but I'm trying to see how Belal can win this fight, to get to Leon and wrestling.

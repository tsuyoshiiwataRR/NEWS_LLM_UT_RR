    "text": "COSTA MESA, Calif. — A silly moment at Raiders’ training camp drew a quick response from a rival’s inner circle Thursday.\nOne fan at Jack Hammett Sports Complex brought a Kermit the Frog puppet to practice that was dressed up as Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, whose voice has often been mocked for sounding similar to the Muppet’s. They tossed the toy on the field at one point when players were signing autographs.\nRookie safety Trey Taylor appeared to try to humor the fan by placing the puppet on his hand. He then laughed at the absurdity of the situation.\nThis Raiders Kermit Mahomes doll is going to age abysmally pic.twitter.com/Z4p5GNCgZL\n— The 33rd Team (@The33rdTeamFB) July 25, 2024\nNot everyone was amused. A quick video of Taylor playing with the puppet went viral and drew the attention of Mahomes’ longtime personal trainer, Bobby Stroupe.\n“We will remember,” Stroupe wrote on social media with a link to the video.\nThe Chiefs visit Allegiant Stadium for the first of two meetings between the teams Oct. 27.\nContact Adam Hill at Follow @AdamHillLVRJ on X.",

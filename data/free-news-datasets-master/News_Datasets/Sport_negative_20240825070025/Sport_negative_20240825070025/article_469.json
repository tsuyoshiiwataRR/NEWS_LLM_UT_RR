    "text": "By Matt Audilet ,\n2 hours ago\nThe fanfare surrounding Bronny James' NBA entrance is unprecedented for a late second-round draft pick.\nThe eldest son of LeBron James is hounded by fans and media wherever he goes — and that fact was on full display during the Los Angeles Lakers' Summer League schedule in Las Vegas.\nAccording to The U.S. Sun , one of Bronny's Summer League teammates found this attention to be \"very annoying\" — calling out the \"special treatment\" the second-round pick experienced this summer.\n\"I mean, he was treated as someone apart, not like all of us, and that is very annoying as we didn’t feel any chemistry in this group of players,\" the anonymous player reportedly said.\nThe anonymous player reportedly described the Lakers' Summer League experience as \"The Bronny James Tour.\"\nJul 12, 2024; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Los Angeles Lakers guard Bronny James (9) sits on the bench during the second half against the Houston Rockets at Thomas & Mack Center. © Lucas Peltier-USA TODAY Sports\n\"I ended up being very frustrated because I was never put in the best situation, or even put in some plays or game plans because they wanted Bronny to show his skills and shine,\" the player continued.\n\"If you talk to any other player that was part of the roster of the California Classic and the Summer League, most of them would tell you the same thing... The tensions were visible, and pretty much we were all thinking about the end of the Summer League to get out of here and focus on our next step in our careers.\"\nBronny, the No. 55 overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, signed a four-year, $7.9 million rookie deal with the Lakers.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "- Sam Pittman and Billy Napier are battling the most heat prior to their openers, but others in the SEC also will encounter critical seasons. - Sam Pittman's buyout clause works against him. Billy Napier's buyout affords some protection, but enough? - Shane Beamer set a high bar for himself in his first two seasons. Is Vanderbilt's bar low enough for Clark Lea? The mercury is rising on the SEC’s hot seat before the season even begins. Multiple SEC coaches face potential make-or-break seasons. Sam Pittman (Arkansas) and Billy Napier (Florida) are battling the most heat prior to their openers, but Clark Lea (Vanderbilt) and Shane Beamer (South Carolina) also will encounter critical seasons. On this edition of “ SEC Football Unfiltered ,” a podcast from the USA TODAY Network, hosts Blake Toppmeyer and John Adams take the temperature of those four jobs. ∎ Beamer is the only member of the quartet above .500 during his tenure, but the Gamecocks are coming off a year of regression. ∎ If Pittman’s record doesn’t rebound after last year’s tailspin, he could trigger a performance clause in his contract that would allow Arkansas to fire him for a discount. ∎ Napier’s Gators face one of the nation’s toughest schedules, and he's already just 11-14 at Florida. ∎ Lea’s last SEC win came in 2022. TOPPMEYER: Florida's Billy Napier would handle hot seat better with Tennessee's cushy schedule ADAMS: The new version of 'college' football is too big to fail Here's how we see the fate of these four coaches: Sam Pittman (Arkansas) Adams: He'll be fired on Sept. 29 after loss to Texas A&M. Firing Pittman early in the season would allow Arkansas to elevate Bobby Petrino to interim coach for a two-month trial to evaluate Petrino's candidacy for the job. Toppmeyer: He'll be fired on Oct. 20 after loss to LSU. I've got the Razorbacks starting the season at 2-5. If they do so, Pittman's record since 2021 would dip below .500, trigging a discounted buyout clause in which Arkansas could save about $4 million by firing Pittman before his record rebounds. Clark Lea (Vanderbilt) Adams: He'll be fired on Dec. 1, 2025, after a loss to Tennessee ends his fifth straight losing season. Vanderbilt will be bad this season, but it will retain with Lea for another year of futility. Toppmeyer: He'll be fired on Dec. 1. If Vanderbilt's season goes the way I think it will, there's no reason to wait another year to fire Lea. This remains an incredibly tough job, and there's zero evidence Lea is up to the task. Shane Beamer (South Carolina) Adams: He'll be fired on Dec. 1 after a loss to Clemson. Beamer set the bar too high for himself by winning 15 games throughout his first two seasons. A second straight losing season in Year 4 will trigger a change. Toppmeyer: He'll remain South Carolina's coach for at least the 2025 season. Will Muschamp got five seasons at South Carolina. Beamer will get at least that many. The Gamecocks might spin their tires this season, but it won't get bad enough to make a change. Billy Napier (Florida) Adams: He'll be fired on Dec. 1 after a loss to Florida State. Napier will get a full third season to show he's worth a fourth season, but a third straight loss to FSU and third straight losing season will tip the scales to a firing. Toppmeyer: He'll be fired on Dec. 1 after a loss to Florida State. The Gators would owe Napier more than $25 million if he's fired, but I don't see how Florida can stick with Napier if he delivers three straight losing seasons. Florida's depth chart is in its best state since Napier's hire, but UF's rugged schedule is tailormade for a firing.

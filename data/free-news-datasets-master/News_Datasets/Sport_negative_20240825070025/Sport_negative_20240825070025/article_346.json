    "text": "PARIS — Wednesday was a rough day for Team USA. Rugby drew with France and was demolished by Fiji, arguably the “Alabama football,” of rugby sevens. Soccer lost 3-0 to France.\nThursday, the US Women’s team beat Zambia 3-0 in soccer.\nHopefully, Friday goes a lot smoother for Americans competing in France. The 2024 Paris Olympics can be seen on NBC Sports, NBC and Peacock.\nOlympics coverage technically starts at 1 a.m. on the USA network but very few people will be up for that Friday morning. Ongoing coverage will continue on the USA Network at 6 a.m. followed by a preview of the Opening Ceremony on Peacock at 11 a.m.\nThe Opening Ceremony will be broadcast live at 12:30 p.m.\nA more robust TV schedule will return Saturday.\nIn women’s soccer, two former Mississippi State players Ilana Izquierdo and Catalina Perez represented Columbia in a 3-2 loss to France. They were the first Bulldogs to see action in Paris.\nMississippi State will be represented by nine different people in the 2024 Paris games.\nAccording to MSU Athletics, if Marc Arop, Lee Eppie or any other Bulldogs do earn a medal in Paris, they’d join the five other former MSU athletes/coaches that have taken home hardware in previous Olympic Games.\nMSU Athletics reports the five previous medalists with State ties are Commodore Scott Cochran (USA), who won gold in the 4x400m relay in the 1924 games. Scott Field at Davis Wade Stadium is named for Cochran. Will Clark (USA), who won silver in baseball at the 1984 games; Ron Polk (USA), who won a gold medal in 1988 and a bronze in 1996; Falilatu Ogunkoya (NGR), who won both silver and bronze medals (4x400m relay and 400m respectively) in the 1996 Olympics; and Jude Monye (NGR), who became a gold medalist in the 4x400m relay in 2000.",

    "text": "Willie Mays, whose unique collection of skills made him the greatest center fielder who ever lived, died at 93 years old in the Bay Area. Michael Mays said in a statement released by the San Francisco Giants, “My father has passed away peacefully and among loved ones. I want to thank you all from the bottom of my broken heart for the unwavering love you have shown him over the years. You have been his life’s blood.” The “Say Hey Kid” left an undeniable mark on the sport, with his name a constant throughout baseball’s hallowed record book and his defensive expertise, epitomized by “The Catch” in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series, second to none.\nAll told, in a career that spanned 20-plus years (1951-73) — most of them with his beloved Giants — he made 24 All-Star teams, won two National League MVP awards and had 12 Gold Gloves. He ranks sixth all-time in home runs (660), seventh in runs scored (2,068), 10th in RBIs (1,909) and 12th in hits (3,293). Giants chairman Greg Johnson said in a statement, “Today we have lost a true legend. In the pantheon of baseball greats, Willie Mays’ combination of tremendous talent, keen intellect, showmanship, and boundless joy set him apart. A 24-time All-Star, the Say Hey Kid is the ultimate Forever Giant. Johnson continued, “He had a profound influence not only on the game of baseball but on the fabric of America. He was an inspiration and a hero who will be forever remembered and deeply missed.”\nView this post on Instagram\nFellow Giants legend Barry Bonds, who is Mays’ godson and sits just five spots above him on the all-time home run leaderboard, said Mays “helped shape me to be who I am today” in a\nmessage shared on social media. Mays’ death comes two days before the Giants are set to play the St. Louis Cardinals at Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama, in a game honoring Mays and the Negro Leagues as a whole. It was announced Monday that Mays would not be able to attend.\nMays, who was born on May 6, 1931, and grew up in Alabama, began his professional career at age 17 in 1948 with the Birmingham Black Barons, helping the team to the Negro League World Series that season. MLB has been working with the city of Birmingham and the Friends of Rickwood nonprofit group to renovate the 10,800-seat ballpark, which, at 114 years old, is the oldest professional ballpark in the United States.\n“The game at historic Rickwood Field was designed to be a celebration of Willie Mays and his peers,” MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. “With sadness in our hearts, it will now also serve as a national remembrance of an American who will forever remain on the short list of the most impactful individuals our great game has ever known.” The Giants were playing the Cubs in Chicago; the Wrigley Field crowd of 36,292 stood in a salute to Mays during a moment of silence when his death was announced on the left-field video board in the sixth inning.\n“It’s heavy hearts for not only the Bay Area and New York where he started, but the baseball world,” said Giants manager Bob Melvin, who learned of Mays’ death right before the start of the game. “This is one of the true icons of the game.”",

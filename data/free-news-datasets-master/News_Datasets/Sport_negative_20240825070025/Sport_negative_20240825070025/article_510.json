    "text": "By Chris Novak ,\n5 hours ago The Dallas Cowboys’ postseason struggles are known far and wide. Dallas won Super Bowl XXX following the 1995-96 NFL season. Since then, Dallas has failed even to reach the NFC Championship Game. It’s been nearly thirty years since the team hoisted a Lombardi Trophy. Dak Prescott, the Cowboys’ starting quarterback since 2016, unsurprisingly has caught a lot of the flack for their losses.\nLike every other Cowboys quarterback since 1995, Prescott has failed to deliver in January. Even though other common denominators are more prominent, as Dallas’ quarterback, Prescott will endure criticism. He has, and then some over the past few seasons; some feel it’s pretty earned. The more the Cowboys bottom out in January, the more prominent these narratives become.\nFormer Philadelphia Eagles star LeSean McCoy, who knows a thing or two about the Dallas-Philly rivalry, talked to Kay Adams on Up & Adams this week about the Cowboys quarterback. It’s safe to say that McCoy doesn’t think highly of Dak after his comments on the signal-caller.\n“In my opinion… I don’t think he’s tough enough,” McCoy said. “Right? When everybody’s playing at an elite level, in the playoffs, small margin for error. We need our best ot be the best. Andy Reid always says, like in big games, ‘I need my best players to outperform their best players.’ And Dak, in the Playoffs, he doesn’t do that,” he added.\nMcCoy thinks Prescott “doesn’t have that dog in him,” which separates him from the best of the best.\n[ Up & Adams ]\nThe post Former Eagles star thinks Dak Prescott ‘isn’t tough enough’ to win in postseason appeared first on The Comeback: Today’s Top Sports Stories & Reactions .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

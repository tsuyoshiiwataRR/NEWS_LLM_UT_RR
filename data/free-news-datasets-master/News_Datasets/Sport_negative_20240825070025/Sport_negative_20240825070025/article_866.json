    "text": "Bob’s Baseball Breakdown: Have Mariners hit rock bottom?\nJul 25, 2024, 5:54 PM\nIt’s been a brutal month of July for the Seattle Mariners, and there’s bevy of questions surrounding the floundering team as the MLB trade deadline approaches.\nHow Seattle Mariners’ trade deadline fix could come from ’21 Braves\nSeattle Sports’\nBob Stelton weighed in on a number of those during this week’s Bob’s Baseball Breakdown. Here’s what he answered:\n– How bad has this stretch been?\n– How much do the injuries to Julio Rodríguez and J.P. Crawford hurt?\n– Does the upcoming series with a historically bad White Sox team bring hope?\n– What does Bob need to see happen at the trade deadline?\n– Can the Mariners still win the division?\nListen to Bob Stelton on Seattle Sports’\nWyman and Bob weekdays from 2-6 p.m. or find the podcast on the Seattle Sports app.\nMore on Seattle Mariners\n•\nLosses, hitting woes, injuries piling up for reeling Mariners\n•\nTrade Rumor: M’s ‘pretty aggressive’ trying to get Guerrero, says insider\n•\nPassan: Mariners’ recent slide shouldn’t change their trade plans\n•\nMariners Trade Targets: Three bats from teams on the bubble\n•\nESPN’s Passan: One hitter makes most sense for a Mariners trade",

    "text": "Canada’s Tokyo [Olympics](https://7news.com.au/sport/olympics) gold medal in women’s football is under fresh scrutiny after explosive new allegations emerged in the team’s spying scandal at Paris 2024. Found to have [used a drone to watch New Zealand training sessions over the past week](https://7news.com.au/sport/olympics/canada-soccer-staffer-sentenced-to-jail-amid-deeply-shocking-olympic-spying-twist-c-15470681), claims that Canada have spied on teams for years — including in Tokyo — went public just hours after their 2-1 win over the Kiwis on Thursday (Friday AEST). Canada Soccer has now suspended head coach Bev Priestman, with the Canadian Olympic Committee subsequently announcing the Tokyo gold-medal winner would be sent home from Paris. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: [Download today ](https://7news.com.au/app?utm_source=7NEWS&utm_medium=contextual-link-app&utm_campaign=7news-app) “Over the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,” Canada Soccer Kevin Blue said. “In light of these new revelations, Canada Soccer has made the decision to suspend women’s national team head coach Bev Priestman for the remainder of Paris 2024, and until the completion of our recently announced independent external review.” Canada had already sent home unaccredited analyst Joseph Lombardi, who [received an eight-month suspended jail term in a French court](https://7news.com.au/sport/olympics/canada-soccer-staffer-sentenced-to-jail-amid-deeply-shocking-olympic-spying-twist-c-15470681), and assistant coach Jasmine Mander. Canada, with assistant Andy Spence taking charge in Priestman’s absence for the first time, claimed victory over New Zealand in Saint-Etienne on Thursday (Friday AEST) with a late goal from Evelyne Viens. The Kiwis had taken the lead 13 minutes into the match when Mackenzie Barry scored after being left open at a corner, but the match turned in Canada’s favour when Cloe Lacasse equalised just moments before half-time. Canada dominated the second half but only secured victory when substitute Viens finished a fine team move in the 79th minute. New Zealand’s day was made worse by Macey Fraser leaving the field in tears following an injury to her left ankle. Canada, meanwhile, will move on in Paris under a cloud after Priestman’s departure and the fresh spying allegations, which have thrown the entire country in turmoil. The claims emerged via [TSN](https://www.tsn.ca/canada-s-men-s-and-women-s-soccer-teams-have-relied-on-drones-and-spying-for-years-sources-say-1.2153674), with journalist Rick Westhead citing “two sources with first-hand knowledge” of the drone usage. The report alleged coaching staff and contracts working with Canada’s men’s and women’s teams have been “engaged for years in efforts to film” their opposition. One of the TSN sources claimed Canada filmed two of Japan’s training sessions before their Tokyo Olympics opener in 2021. The match ended in a 1-1 draw, with Canada going on to win gold with a penalty shootout victory over Sweden in the final. Canada were also reportedly caught attempting to film Panama ahead of a 2023 Women’s World Cup qualifying game in July 2022, with a complaint made to governing body CONCACAF. The report claimed staff received orders from superiors, told that filming opposition training sessions was in their job description. One contractor reportedly missed out on a job at the 2023 World Cup when they said they would not do so, with a Canada Soccer staffer said to have replaced them. “Most people see this as cheating, which it is,” one of the sources told TSN. “Some of our coaches just see it as a competitive advantage and justify it by saying everyone does it, which is also not true. Not everyone cheats and neither should we.” There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Canada’s players. Stream free on",

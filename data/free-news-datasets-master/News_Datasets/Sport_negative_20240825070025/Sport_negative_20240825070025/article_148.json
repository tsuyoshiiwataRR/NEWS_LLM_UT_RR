    "text": "Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is not off to a promising start this season, according to two franchise legends — and it has everything to do with what he said during his 10-minute media availability Wednesday, the first day of training camp. FS1′s “Speak” held a segment discussing Hurts in new offensive coordinator’s Kellen Moore’s system and whether there were any concerns. While all five panelists shared some worry, the ones from former stars LeSean McCoy and DeSean Jackson were particularly noteworthy.\nBUY EAGLES TICKETS:\nSTUBHUB, VIVID SEATS, TICKETMASTER\nThey\ndid not like how Hurts talked about Moore’s offense, using words like “differences” and “process” he’s going through to “make it (his) own.”\n“I don’t think he should have brought it up,” McCoy said Wednesday. “Because when you a dog and you like that, I’m going to be good anywhere I play at. ... But no matter where you put me at, if I’m a really good player, I’m gonna be that good player.\n“So I only have to talk about it because I’ve been watching guys like AJ Brown speak about Kellen Moore; ‘how you feel about it?’ He loves him. Devonte Smith, he loves him. ... Everyone is saying all that but then you saying ... well, so I just hate that part of the game.”\nMcCoy, who played for the Eagles from 2009-14, continued by clarifying that he’s a Hurts fan. The former running back thinks she’s a “really good player” and a winner. He just doesn’t want to see any excuses creep into his game.\n“So look, new coordinator, find a way to win, because this is what I do know: When you pay a quarterback, not on a player, but pay a quarterback all that money, we gonna find ways to make you comfortable,” McCoy said.\nTherein lies the rub for Jackson, the former receiver who played in Philadelphia from 2008-13 and then 2019-20.\n“I’m a little concerned,” Jackson said. “... Kellen Moore, I know Philadelphia. You got my boy stuttering, I don’t usually hear him stutter like that. Make it condensed for him, the terminology, the plays. ... I’m a little concerned. I know one thing: the fans aren’t going to allow that. ...\n“If Hurts is uncomfortable, it’s going to show. Before he got paid, he was just out there playing.”\nHurts was anointed as the face of the franchise when he signed a five-year, $255 million extension in April 2023. High expectations were magnified after his Eagles reached the Super Bowl in 2023. Instead, Hurts felt the criticism that comes with not meeting expectations — he regressed individually and contributed to the Eagles ending their season with six losses in their final seven games, including the NFC wild card.\nBut he’s still one of the NFL’s best quarterbacks and all he needs to do is win to change the narrative.\nMORE EAGLES COVERAGE\nEagles’ new coach calls out ‘piss poor’ plays, while Jalen Hurts displays accuracy New Eagle Devin White started a high-level group text with a photo of an empty glass Eagles jettison injured developmental player and add tight end turned wide receiver Eagles rookie reportedly carted off the field with an injury | Is it serious?\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

    "text": "[Former Vols QB Hendon Hooker provided an important reminder for all NFL fans as training camps get underway](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/former-vols-qb-hendon-hooker-provided-an-important-reminder-for-all-nfl-fans-as-training-camps-get-underway/ar-BB1qCubg?ocid=socialshare) In late May, after an OTA session, Detroit Lions second year quarterback Hendon Hooker, a former Tennessee Vols standout, [was pointed out as a player]that \"struggled\". Those reports led to some suggestions that Hooker might not be ready to step up and play the role of the No. 2 quarterback in Detroit. n late May, after an OTA session, Detroit Lions second year quarterback Hendon Hooker, a former Tennessee Vols standout, [was pointed out as a player]that \"struggled\". Those reports led to some suggestions that Hooker might not be ready to step up and play the role of the No. 2 quarterback in Detroit. Two months later and the tone coming out of Detroit about Hooker is much different. The former Tennessee standout [reportedly \"shined\" at Lions training camp]on Wednesday. \"I was just super excited. Once I really calmed down, it was just getting back to regular schedule, and thatâ€™s just playing catch with the guys,\" [said Hooker to Lions On SI]. \"I thought it was great after that first team set. I thought I had a great day today.\" \"Once I calmed down, I had some jitters the first reps in team today. Once I calmed down and got my rhythm, I felt good,\" added Hooker. After that rough OTA in May, the narrative surrounding Hooker was that he was behind schedule and that he might not be able to be counted on as the No. 2 quarterback for the Lions in 2024. But that was always an unfair narrative. Basing anything on an OTA practice in May -- especially in regards to a player like Hooker who missed the majority of his rookie season while recovering from a torn ACL -- is absolutely absurd. Hooker's solid day on Wednesday, which quickly tipped the narrative back in his favor, is a big reminder that it's not wise to make any grand conclusions about a player during OTAs/minicamps. Development for a quarterback isn't linear and it isn't the same for every player. There are a wild variance of situations that each quarterback is facing in the NFL. When it comes to Hooker, he hasn't played meaningful football since November, 2022 (when he tore his ACL in a loss against the South Carolina Gamecocks). Expecting him to be peak Hendon Hooker in an OTA in May isn't reasonable. And anyway, those OTA sessions are a time when players are trying to find their rhythm, find what works, etc. It's not the time of year when they're getting \"dialed in\" for the regular season.The offseason is a fun time of year for NFL fans. There's room for speculation and everyone feels like they have a reason to be optimistic. But players aren't a finished product in the spring/summer. Hendon Hooker's great day on Wednesday is a reminder of how quick the narrative can change. Which is why forming a negative narrative after a couple of hours of practice is never a smart approach. yep, I didn't buy what was being sold about Hooker losing to Sudfeld. Sure, it would make some fans happy because they dont want competition for Goff. That guy has had no competition his entire career. Hooker, on the other hand, has never had a job handed to him. There was a rather dim narrative by some that if Hooker struggled in his first OTAs and minicamp, then he's a bust and suddenly, Sudfeld is going to the backup. That's a joke. It's real funny, that all the talk was on Hooker's struggles while Goff was struggling too. Goff had a 3 INT day, more than Hooker despite his struggles. It's not unusual for any player to struggle in the same circumstances. Hooker had a good day. His job is to stack them and be ready when the pads come on, that's a whole new level. Still, when we fans finally see him, I expect him to show awesome arm talent and mobility.",

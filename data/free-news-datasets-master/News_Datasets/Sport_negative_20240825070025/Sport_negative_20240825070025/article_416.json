    "text": "The 2023 [Cleveland Browns](https://www.dawgsbynature.com/) season was mostly defined by injuries and resiliency. Despite losing key starters like Jack Conklin, Nick Chubb and Deshaun Watson early in the season, the Browns were able to roll to an 11-win season and a playoff berth. The start of training camp for 2024 [came with some injury concerns as well for Cleveland](https://www.dawgsbynature.com/2024/7/24/24205300/cleveland-browns-place-7-players-on-training-camp-injury-lists-nick-chubb-greg-newsome). [As the Browns kicked off camp at The Greenbrier](https://www.dawgsbynature.com/2024/7/25/24206234/browns-training-camp-practice-schedule-greenbrier-dates-times), seven players were added to different injury lists including Greg Newsome and Nyheim Hines for injuries not sustained while with the team. While Jack Conklin, Jedrick Wills, Chubb and Hines were known to be recovering from injuries last season, Dalvin Tomlinson and D’Anthony Bell were new. On the first day of training camp, HC Kevin Stefanski announced that Newsome had undergone surgery already and that Tomlinson would be doing the same: Lot of updates from Browns HC Kevin Stefanski:— Daniel Oyefusi (@DanielOyefusi) — CB Greg Newsome underwent surgery after injuring his hamstring during training; team is hoping to have him back for Week 1 — DT Dalvin Tomlinson is going to have a knee scope — Stefanski will continue to call plays [pic.twitter.com/owPnwXXrTG] [July 25, 2024] We share more from [HC Kevin Stefanski’s play-calling decision here earlier](https://www.dawgsbynature.com/2024/7/25/24206397/browns-kevin-stefanski-ken-dorsey-decision-made-on-play-calling). On the practice field, Myles Garrett led a big group of players who started off to the side during drills: — Ashley Bastock (@AshleyBastock42) [#Browns]starting off to the side today: Myles Garrett, David Njoku, Nick Chubb, Jerry Jeudy, Cameron Mitchell, D’Anthony Bell, and Nyheim Hines. [pic.twitter.com/Anwr6OQufL] [July 25, 2024] Garrett and Jeudy [later joined the walkthrough portion of the practice](https://x.com/ScottPetrak/status/1816552778501902599). We will have a full recap of Browns Training Camp Day 1 on the site this afternoon. What is your concern level with all of the injuries noted above?",

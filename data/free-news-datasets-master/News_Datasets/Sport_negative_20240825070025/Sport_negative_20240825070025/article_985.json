    "text": "I don’t believe in Matt Eberflus as the head coach of the [Chicago Bears](https://www.windycitygridiron.com/). I think he has a good defensive mind and is a good leader for his players, but his in-game management doesn't do it for me. A coach can’t settle for field goal attempts when his opponent is scoring touchdowns. A coach can’t sit on leads and hope for the best. A coach can’t punt on fourth and short from plus territory. Sure, there are outlying instances where it’s wise to do those three things, but generally speaking, coaches who consistently do that are coaching not to lose instead of coaching to win. Today’s NFL is all about the offense. It’s a quarterback-driven league, and it has been for quite some time. The run-the-ball and play-good-defense era is gone, and while those are still two staples for a winning team, you need more than that. Good offense trumps good defense, and even more so with how the league’s rule changes tend to benefit the offense. Eberflus has been known to gamble on occasion — he was middle of the pack last year in going for it on fourth down and in conversion percentage — but several of his fourth quarters have been mismanaged. There’s a time and place for aggressive decision-making, but ‘Flus seemed to turtle with the game on the line. The Bears blew three two-score fourth-quarter games last season, and while the players didn’t execute down the stretch, many of the play calls were head-scratchers. To paraphrase Maya Angelou, when a head football coach shows you he’s conservative, you believe him, and Eberflus has been that through his two years leading the Bears. Now, there’s nothing to say he can’t change. We see players develop all the time, and coaches can do it as well. Year three might be when it all clicks for him. I’m rooting for him because he’s a likable guy, but mostly because the Bears need him to prove he’s the right coach for the job. This franchise is desperate for continuity, especially with a rookie quarterback under center. So, while I’ve had my doubts during his tenure, I understand that circumstances often drive decisions, and Chicago’s circumstances during Eberflus’ two years were that of a rebuilding team. He had to play the hand he was dealt, and in year one, he had an offsuit two and seven. In year two, he was more fortunate but still hoping for a nice flop. His passing offenses have been among the league’s worst, which may have led to some of the conservative decisions. In the fourth quarter of all games last season, Chicago quarterbacks had a 45.4 passer rating, which was by far their worst quarter. In adjusted net yards per pass attempt, which takes yards lost due to sacks into account, Bear quarterbacks averaged 2.4 yards on all fourth-quarter pass attempts. If he didn’t trust his offense to execute, that could have been the reason we got too many run, run, pass, punt series’ during games. I know Luke Getsy was the offensive playcaller, but if Eberflus wanted his offense to step on the gas, then Getsy would have been more aggressive. If the offseason is any indication, then there’ll be a new and improved ‘Flus leading the Bears in 2024. The makeover is one thing, but there’s also an aura of confidence about him during press conferences. He was even asked at a recent presser why the change in front of the podium, and he said all the “time on task” has made him more comfortable. We’ll have to wait for game day to see if Caleb Williams, Keenan Allen, Rome Odunze, D’Andre Swift, and Gerald Everett executing in Shane Waldron’s offense has him comfortable enough to stop being so conservative.",

    "text": "According to Andy Larsen of The Salt Lake Tribune, Jordan Clarkson, the 2020-2021 6th Man of the Year, is not receiving interest on the trade market. Clarkson had a down year last season, which is why he reportedly does not have current trade value. Clarkson is also 32 years old, which may signal to rival executives that relying on Clarkson having a bounce-back season is risky. Jordan Clarkson is surprisingly receiving no interest on the trade market, per— NBACentral (@TheDunkCentral) [@andyblarsen] “Clarkson, meanwhile, needs a bounceback season after really struggling with his efficiency last year. As of now, there haven’t been any other interested NBA teams in trading for his… [pic.twitter.com/9OGw7Yd9pu] [July 25, 2024] Jordan Clarkson is the current longest-tenured Jazzman and has had multiple fantastic seasons with the team. He came to the Jazz in a trade in 2019 and immediately made his impact as a bench offensive engine, serving a role similar to other great guard 6th men of former years like Lou Williams, Jamal Crawford, or Vinnie Johnson. His greatest moment with the Jazz was during the pinnacle of the Gobert/Mitchell era when he won 6th Man of the Year over former Jazzman Joe Ingles. while Clarkson’s 2023-2024 season was his worst on the Jazz due to inefficiency and regression on defense, his 2022-2023 season was strong. Clarkson was likely the Jazz’s second-best player that season. What should the Jazz do with Clarkson? If he has no trade value as Larsen has reported, then the team should keep him and try to rehabilitate his value. Sexton (if he doesn’t get traded) has rightfully earned the starting shooting guard spot, but that could be a boon to Clarkson. Jordan was a good starter 2 seasons ago, but his traditional role is a 6th man and with the emergence of Sexton, Clarkson can step back into that role. If Clarkson has a strong season off the bench, he will have trade value again, especially considering his friendly contract due to the Jazz’s wise frontloading strategy. If Clarkson continues to struggle, he will help the Jazz tank, which seems to be a goal for the organization next season. Regardless of what happens, Clarkson will always be a fan favorite in Utah. Do you think the Jazz should try to trade him this offseason or see if they can rehabilitate his value? Comment Below!",

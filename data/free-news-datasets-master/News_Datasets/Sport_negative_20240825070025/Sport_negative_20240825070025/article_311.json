AFP | CARL DE SOUZA Fiji have won both Olympic golds since rugby was introduced at the 2016 Rio Games but have recently suffered a run of poor form by their high standards.However, the undisputed kings of sevens have enjoyed a renaissance under new coach Osea Kolinisau and were back to their brilliant free-flowing best in a 40-12 demolition of Uruguay.They turned on the style in their second match, bamboozling the United States with mesmerising offloads and searing pace for a captivating 38-12 win.The Fijians face France next in a mouthwatering clash on Thursday to decide the pool winner.Earlier, Australia booked their quarter-final place from pool B with two hard-fought wins over a determined Samoa and Kenya.Argentina, who were roundly booed by the home faithful, also ensured a spot in the knock-out phase, running out comfortable 31-12 winners against Kenya before beating Samoa 28-12. AFP | CARL DE SOUZA Pool A, seen as the group of death , pitted rugby superpowers New Zealand, South Africa, and Ireland against each other, along with emerging force Japan.Ireland and the All Blacks emerged on top, both comfortably seeing off Japan and narrowly edging out South Africa.Both showed they will be contenders at the business end of the competition, the All Blacks in particular impressing with some slick handling in their 17-5 win over the Blitzboks.With the global exposure that comes with the Olympics and playing to a sold-out Stade de France, World Rugby s chief executive Alan Gilpin has described the tournament as a coming of age moment for the sport.\nRead on the original site",

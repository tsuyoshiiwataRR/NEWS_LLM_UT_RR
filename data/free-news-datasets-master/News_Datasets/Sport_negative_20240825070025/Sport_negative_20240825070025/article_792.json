    "text": "Carmelo Anthony was the one who Draymond Green [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/draymond-green/] grew up watching, and Jayson Tatum [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/jayson-tatum/] was part of his wedding ceremony. That is a little of the bond of respect and brotherhood the Warriors star has shared with each. So when asked to rank the two, Green ensured to acknowledge his heart in both places. Appearing on the Club 520 podcast [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylsfuSlos4c], Jeff Teague put the Warriors forward in a spot, asking him who was a tougher cover to guard in one-on-one situations. Without any hesitation, Draymond Green said Carmelo Anthony but did not forget to show love to Tatum. “By the way, JT is my man. I love JT.” Yet, just one of Melo’s strengths was enough for Green to pick him over his Celtics brother. “The thing that Melo did different than just about anyone was the pressure he put on the rim,” the star forward iterates. That remains on something of an opposite line to JT, Green believes. “As opposed to, I have told JT this before, like, ‘bro, get to the cup. Sometimes you settle too much’.” But that is not to say Tatum doesn’t have his point of dominance. Green explains that once the Celtics star gets to the hole, he is unstoppable and his 6’10 stature only adds to it. So when Tatum failed to make an impact with that in the 2022 finals, averaging 21. 5 points and 36.7%, Green was unimpressed. He reveals to have also said, “I just want to know like our stuff was predicated on you settling,” after the Warriors bested the Celtics for the championship. But those weren’t all the words exchanged. Previously, he had stated his emotional feelings about the 2022 finals when he faced Tatum. Before the game started, both of them did not exchange courtesies, even when they were close to each other. But once the game ended, both hugged [https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-active-basketball-news-draymond-green-breaks-silence-on-nba-growing-softer-chatter-with-jayson-tatum-example/]. “What’s up, bro? I miss you. Dang! It was bothering me not talking to you.’ Yes! It’s my brother.” Boston Celtics small forward Jayson Tatum [https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2021-04-14T041254Z_1531962533_MT1USATODAY15892120_RTRMADP_3_NBA-BOSTON-CELTICS-AT-PORTLAND-TRAIL-BLAZERS.jpg]Apr 13, 2021; Portland, Oregon, USA; Boston Celtics small forward Jayson Tatum (0) dribbles the ball while defended by Portland Trail Blazers power forward Carmelo Anthony (00) during the second half at Moda Center. Mandatory Credit: Soobum Im-USA TODAY Sports Draymond Green had already planned his wedding date and winning the finals was just a sweet victory. Tatum recalled the scenario as a tough situation, seeing the Warriors team after losing the finals to them, but stayed true to his point of being there to celebrate his friend. Similarly, Green too doesn’t forget why he chose Carmelo Anthony and recalled the anecdote of facing him. GREEN CHOSE CARMELO ANTHONY OVER WARRIORS FORWARD 2 years ago, on a mailbag edition of his show, Green was asked who was a better scorer in the prime of their career, Carmelo Anthony or Kevin Durant. Unlike the recent answer, the 4x NBA champion took a long time to answer and described the situation as ‘Pick ’em.’ It’s sports betting terminology where none of the parties are underdogs or favorites. But ultimately chose Carmelo Anthony, because Melo could score however he wanted to. “You wanted mid-post work? First step is crazy. You wanted straight block work? Fadeaway is tough, and Melo will bully the hell out of somebody. You want the trey ball? We all know he can do that.” Also, he shared the story of facing Melo, which has been etched in his memory. Carmelo Anthony apparently went straight through Green’s chest on a play during the latter’s first or second season in the league but did not get a foul call. However, he yelled at the official and pulled off the same move on the next trip down the floor and got to the free-throw line the second time.

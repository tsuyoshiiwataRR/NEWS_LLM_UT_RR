    "text": "A drone flown by a Canada Soccer staff member disrupted a New Zealand training session on Monday just days ahead of their opening match against the Tokyo 2020 gold medalists. Priestman apologised to the New Zealand players for what had happened and said ultimate responsibility lay with her. \"This does not represent the values that our team stands for. I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program.\" Global soccer's governing body FIFA has launched disciplinary proceedings against Canada Soccer, Priestman, and two Canada Soccer staff members that were booted from the Paris games this week over the scandal. Canada Soccer said Wednesday it would launch an independent external review about the drone incident and the historical culture of competitive ethics within all of its programs. Canada Soccer did not immediately reply to a request for additional comment. The Canadian women are scheduled to take on Group A opponent France on Sunday in Saint-Etienne. REUTERS",

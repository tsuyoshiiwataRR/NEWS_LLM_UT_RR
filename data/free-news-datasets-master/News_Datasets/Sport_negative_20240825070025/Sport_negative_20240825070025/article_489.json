    "text": "By Emma Kemp Updated July 26, 2024 — 5.28am first published at 2.55am articles for later Add articles Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Advertisement Marseilles : The looming structure of the Stade de Marseille threw blessed shade onto the field. Just in time for Germany to throw shade on the Matildas. And it was not even controversial, or mindblowingly awful, or compounded by injury. No, this Paris Olympics opener under the searing evening sunshine of southern France was as tepid as Australia’s 2023 World Cup opener in Sydney was blistering.\nThat was partly down to the distinct scarcity of spectators - a paltry crowd of less than 10,000 in a 60,000-capacity venue does not compare to the 75,784 that filled Sydney’s Stadium Australia. But that 1-0 win over Ireland was all fire and brimstone in a way this simply was not. Can a 3-0 loss be dull? Can nightmares be boring?\nThe travelling contingent of Australian fans at least got to go to bed afterwards. Those back home who’d set their alarms for stupid o’clock would have gone to work as confounded as they were irritated by what they witnessed.\nTo be clear, the full-time headlines are all correct: this is a terrible start to Paris 2024. Not just because of this result in a vacuum, but because of the potential ramifications further down the line in the Matildas’ quest for a medal that has so far eluded them at every major tournament to date. Group B was always going to be negotiated with the knockout stages in mind.\nIn a format where only four of the 12 competing teams will exit in the group stage, it is more difficult to go out than it is to stay in. But if Australia do not finish in the top two and progress only as one of the two best third-placed teams, the permutations are potentially fatal. In that scenario, reigning World Cup champions Spain may well await in the quarter-finals. As Tony Gustavsson noted post-match, “every goal counts because it can be goal differential”.\nIf goals are important, then the inability to score one here is worrying. Australia, spearheaded by a two-pronged strike force of Cortnee Vine and Mary Fowler, was designed to target the central defensive weaknesses scouts identified from Germany’s recent results (a hit-and-miss mix of middling performances featuring constantly changing line-ups), lacked attacking impetus.\nNeither Fowler nor Caitlin Foord – a welcome return on the left alongside captain Steph Catley – saw enough of the ball, and the flashes of Hayley Raso flames were not adequately fanned. Michelle Heyman was not introduced until the 77th minute.\nDefensive errors aside – the first two goals were conceded off headers from set pieces – Australia were simply outplayed by a better side. Jule Brand spent 90 minutes running rings around her opponents and claimed her reward by finishing a terrific team goal with 20 minutes to play, icing a redeeming victory one year after the World Cup fancies crashed out in the group stage.\nAdvertisement Even without the formidable presence of Bayern Munich star Lena Oberdorf, who ruptured her ACL last week, Germany looked the more complete team. In flux and still under an interim manager, but also announcing themselves as contenders once more. Gustavsson admitted to being surprised at how well they “minimised the risks” and “did it in a very, very efficient way”.\n“I don’t think we were ready for it,” he said. “They were a class better than us tonight. It’s just fact. We need to be real and honest about that. Obviously a bit upset that they scored on two set pieces, which we had planned for exactly … we trained [for] it, we focused on it.\n“Still, they’re good enough to score two on set plays and when they get that 1-0, they manage to get the game to where they want it and sat back and transition on us, and that’s not really what Germany normally do.\n“What we need to do is just be real and say ‘OK, let’s use this as a wake-up call.’ We’re in international football now, and we have no time to dwell. We just need to be straight back on it and focus on Zambia.”\nLoading The positive is that most of what went wrong can be fixed in time for that second game in Nice on Sunday night (Monday morning, 3am AEST). The negative is that Zambia will most likely place the onus on Australia to attack – a regular challenge with this team. Then will come a crunch clash with the United States, rejuvenated under Emma Hayes and seeking to correct their own downturn.\nBut there are more positives. Katrina Gorry had a blinder in midfield, with an output belying her very recent return from ankle surgery and rehab. Foord and Catley appear fit. And less tangibly, the Matildas historically thrive on situations such as this. This may be their Nigeria moment, and Zambia may yet suffer the consequences of the legendary backs-against-the-wall mentality. Again, it is more straightforward to simply win one game and then win the next, but we should know by now that is not how it works.\nThe result leaves the Matildas in an unenviable position as they navigate a tricky group also featuring Zambia and a rejuvenated United States. Credit: Getty Images\n“Our mantra is ‘never say die’, and I think that’s what you’re going to have to see these next two games,” said Clare Wheeler, who replaced Gorry after 60 minutes.\n“We’re not going to say die … by no means does it mean that we’re out. We have two more games and we’re going to have to embody that ‘never-say-die’ attitude for sure.”\nNews, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

    "text": "By Jaron Spor ,\n6 hours ago\nThe Oklahoma Sooners and Texas Longhorns have one of the greatest rivalries in all of college sports. The Longhorns hold a 63-51-5 advantage all time, but the Sooners have dominated the rivalry since 2000, winning 17 out of 25 games.\nBoth schools will face a new challenge as they join the SEC this season. Former College GameDay analyst David Pollack recently discussed the two schools on the Crain & Company podcast.\nPollack expressed his belief that Texas is on the upswing due to its success in the transfer portal and highlighted Steve Sarkisian's offensive coaching abilities.\nAs for Oklahoma, Pollack is skeptical about the Sooners' chances to compete this season due to their tough schedule.\n\"Oklahoma coming in with their schedule has no chance to be a player,\" Pollack said.\nWhile Pollack doesn't think the Sooners have much of a chance this season due to their demanding schedule, he is tired of hearing the disrespect toward the Sooners.\nPollack said he can't stand people who are excited about Texas' addition to the SEC and act like Oklahoma is just a throw-in. Pollack concluded by saying Oklahoma is the better program.\n\"I can't stand the people who are like, 'I can't believe they get Texas and they get Oklahoma,'\" Pollack said. \"Like, the better program is Oklahoma. Like, let me be clear, the better program is Oklahoma.\"\nOklahoma Sooners wide receiver Jalil Farooq (3) runs near Texas Longhorns defensive back Derek Williams Jr. (2) during Oklahoma's final drive of the Red River Rivalry college football game between the University of Oklahoma Sooners (OU) and the University of Texas (UT) Longhorns at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Saturday, Oct. 7, 2023. Oklahoma won 34-30. Â© BRYAN TERRY&solTHE OKLAHOMAN &sol USA TODAY NETWORK\nPollack mentioned that Oklahoma has participated in four College Football Playoffs, while Texas has only been to one. Pollack also highlighted that in the year Texas reached the playoff, the Longhorns lost to Oklahoma. Additionally, Pollack mentioned that Oklahoma has a 7-3 record against Texas in its last 10 games.\nStill, both programs are among the best of all time, and the SEC is pleased to have both.\nRelated: Paul Finebaum Reveals How Two CFB Programs Saved Themselves From Becoming 'Obsolete'\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

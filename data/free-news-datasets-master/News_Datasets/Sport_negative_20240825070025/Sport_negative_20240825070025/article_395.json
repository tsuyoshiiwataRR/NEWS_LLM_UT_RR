    "text": "Did we really need a study to confirm this? It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to tell you that the worst team in the NFL will have the most miserable fanbase to go along with it. The putrid 2-15 record that the Carolina Panthers boasted last year [nearly broke](https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2024/03/11/what-are-we-doing-luke-combs-tears-into-carolina-panthers-for-trading-brian-burns-for-a-2nd-rounder/) their country star super fan [Luke Combs](www.whiskeyriff.com/tag/luke-combs), who before the season said [his team would go undefeated](https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2023/07/14/luke-combs-says-the-carolina-panthers-are-going-undefeated-this-season-bryce-is-the-guy/) and that “Bryce Young was the guy.” Luke Combs, meet “Freezing Cold Takes.” A survey conducted by [Casino.org](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/e/2PACX-1vTdFGOxjPoLL8dKlGT9x1JuH95MTe12tuMy9oEoVnJDmyUIKsBviRjTNa9oUTuVZ1UrJLcc3C62lffO/pubhtml?pli=1) (sounds a little fishy to me) set out to explore fan happiness of every professional sports team, and found that Panthers fans were the biggest doubters and most miserable. Almost 70% of those who consider themselves Carolina faithful said that there’s no chance whatsoever that Panthers make it to the Super Bowl (oddsmakers agree). Not only that, the survey revealed that Panthers fans consistently felt let down, and that they were highly disappointed with and didn’t trust the management of the team. The study didn’t cover a “having a player that can be easily made fun of” portion of fandom, but Carolina would check that box too. A [video of quarterback Bryce Young](https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2024/07/23/thats-a-middle-school-student-carolina-panthers-qb-bryce-young-goes-viral-for-all-the-wrong-reasons/) went viral earlier this week for all the wrong reasons. Just in case you wanted some more in-depth analysis on how miserable Panthers fans are, here are some more statistics from the survey: -40% of fans aren’t happy with the team’s current players -45% find game day expenses, like tickets, merchandise and concessions, to be too expensive -55% do not find game day experiences to be enjoyable On the flip side, count your blessings if you consider yourself a fan of the Kansas City Chiefs, San Francisco 49ers, Baltimore Ravens, Philadelphia Eagles or the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The survey found those to be the happiest fanbases. See the pattern here? Losing equals miserable fans, winning leads to happy fans. As a Minnesota Vikings fan myself, we were somewhere in the middle of the “miserable/happy” index. And I’m ready to have my heart broken once again. Bring on the football season.",

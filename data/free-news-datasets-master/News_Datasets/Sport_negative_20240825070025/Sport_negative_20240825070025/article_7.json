    "text": "Fiji 19-15 Ireland\nIreland's chances of securing an Olympic medal in the rugby sevens are over as they were beaten 19-15 by Fiji in the quarter-finals at the Stade de France.\nFacing the Olympic champions in their last-eight clash, having failed to top their group, Ireland lost a second-half lead to lose by four points in Paris.\nIt took just 30 seconds for Fiji to make it a perfect start as Iosefo Baleiwairki handed off Niall Comerford before racing through from the half-way line to touch down under the posts.\nIreland looked for a response and Raisuqe Josaia’s high tackle on Zac Ward allowed them to kick to the corner and look to work an opportunity from the line-out.\nA poor set-piece, but it resulted in an Ireland scrum that was moved quickly out to the right. Chay Mullins then cut back inside to power over and touch down – the conversion was missed, however, which meant that a two-point gap remained approaching half time.\nBut Ireland were quickly back in possession and looked to hit Fiji once again with the reigning champions’ ill-discipline leading to consecutive infringements.\nAnother Ireland scrum from a central possession allowed James Topping’s side to exploit the space on the left and Mullins was there once more to power over and force the ball to ground.\nAnother conversion kick missed as Ireland led by three at the break.\nBut Ireland came out with all guns blazing to start the second half and their pressure eventually paid dividends with Ward getting over in the corner to open up an eight-point lead.\nAnother Fiji knock-on handed Ireland possession once more, however, they were unable to capitalise, and it sparked their opponents into life as they went the length of the field with Joji Nasova touching down.\nAnd then disaster, as Ireland made a mess of the re-start, and a knock-on appeared to be missed by the officials, allowing Waisea Nacuqu to race in to put Fiji in front 19-15 with just one and a half minutes on the clock.\nIreland went in search of a deciding score as they opted for touch to work a set-piece opportunity, however, despite prolonging the game for three additional minutes they were unable to break through as Fiji progressed to meet Australia.\nFrance will meet South Africa in the other semi-final on Saturday, with the gold medal to be decided later that evening.\nIreland will now contest the fifth to eighth place play-offs, where the United States will be their initial opponents on Saturday, before a clash against either New Zealand or Argentina.\nFrance, beaten by Fiji in their earlier group game, powered past Argentina 26-14 in front of an enthralled home crowd.\nLes Bleus stunned the Pumas – bronze medallists at Tokyo 2020 – to take a 21-0 interval lead through an Andy Timo try and Aaron Grandidier Nkanang's brace. Rayan Rebbadj added three conversions.\nArgentina fought back as Rodrigo Isgro and Marcos Moneta touched down, but Dupont, the former World Rugby men’s 15s player of the year, came on as a replacement to settle the contest with a late score.\nNew Zealand, silver medallists at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, were surprise quarter-final casualties as South Africa reversed the Pool result to beat them 14-7.\nAustralia coasted to an 18-0 victory over the United States.",

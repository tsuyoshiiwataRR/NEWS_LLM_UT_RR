    "text": "After an Oztag touch footy player tearfully apologised for his\n“stupid” assault on a referee that caused a brain bleed, the one-punch attack victim stepped forward to shake hands.\nBenson Leipau Pauga had approached Jason Fernie in the July 2022 game’s second half after his team accused the referee of favouring the opposition, a\nBrisbane court was told on Thursday.\nAfter a verbal exchange, Pauga punched the 49-year-old Fernie on the jaw.\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app:\nDownload today\nFernie fell backwards, hitting his head on the ground and convulsed, with blood on his mouth.\nPauga, now 34, left the sports ground while Fernie, a referee for 22 years, was taken to hospital with a brain bleed and concussion.\nOn the judge’s instructions, Pauga turned in the Brisbane District Court dock to face Fernie, before tearfully reading a letter of apology.\n“What I did was wrong. I really made a stupid mistake,” he said.\n“I hope you find it in your heart to forgive me.”\nAs Pauga finished, Fernie stood up and shook his hand.\nIt was clear from Fernie’s victim impact statement the assault had a significant emotional and physical impact on the referee and his family, Judge Paul Smith said.\nThe court was told Pauga described his conduct as a “blind explosion” during a week in which he separated from his wife and his scaffolding business partner had left.\n“Referees need to feel safe from players but there was only one punch,” Smith said.\nTaking into account Pauga’s guilty plea to one count of assault occasioning bodily harm, Smith sentenced him to a 12-month intensive corrections order and recorded a conviction.\nPauga, who was raised in West Auckland and moved to Australia in 2009, risked being deported if he was sentenced to actual time in custody.\nHe was ordered to pay $5000 compensation to Fernie within six months.\nThe court heard he has a lifetime ban from playing Oztag.\nOutside court, Fernie said it was good that Pauga apologised but his actions were totally unacceptable.\nDescribing the legal system as pretty soft and the compensation amount “a joke”, Fernie said the outcome was disappointing and he still suffered after the assault.\n“I can’t ref anymore, that’s what hurts the most. I miss my Oztag family,” he said.\nAustralian Oztag general manager Luke Manahan said the organisation takes a strong stance towards abuse against referees and officials.\n“We know how important referees are for our game,” he told AAP.\nOztag is a non-tackling version of rugby league.\nStream free on",

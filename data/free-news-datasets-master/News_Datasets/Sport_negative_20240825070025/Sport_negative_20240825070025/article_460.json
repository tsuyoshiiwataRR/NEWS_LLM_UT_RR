    "text": "Damien Duff reflects on ‘sobering’ European night as Shelbourne are outclassed in Zurich\nFC Zurich 3 Shelbourne FC 0\nOn the eve of this game, Shelbourne manager Damien Duff had compared this trip to Zurich with the 2022 FAI Cup final in terms of prestige.\nUnfortunately for the Reds, it proved to be an even more one sided affair, although the final outcome was kinder than that four goal drubbing at the hands of Derry City.\nThe League of Ireland leaders were completely outclassed. And while that probably shouldn’t be surprising when a team from the 12th best league in Europe hosts opposition from the 35th-ranked division, this was still quite a sobering exercise as a match sharp Shels struggled to lay a glove on a team easing into their own campaign.\nDuff found the positives afterwards, suggesting the reality check might stop his players from getting notions around the extent of their progress. The 2022 final was banked as a similar exercise.\n\"As mad as it sounds, I love nights like this because it teaches us all because we’ve a long way to go,” said Duff afterwards, stressing he was proud of his players’ application.\n\"I might think I’m a half decent manager or coach, I promise you I don’t, but if I was to, here, it’s sobering. I can be better, the staff can be better. The players might think ooh ‘I’m big, I’m strong, I’m quick, I’m technical’ we saw levels tonight. When we’re all back home, the players can’t disrespect a speed session, a gym session, a technical session.\n“As a player, I used to love bad times, bad results because it awakens you and drives you on to be better. It was a gargantuan task. My dream is that not only Shelbourne, but the league and Irish teams, get to this level. We’ve a long way to go. How do we do it? I’m not getting into it tonight.”\nAt the end, the away side were given a warm reception from 350 travelling fans concentrated on the bigger picture of their resurgence. They sang about Shels being top of the league, and it’s now almost certain they will be returning to concentrate on domestic matters from next week with an upset never looking likely here.\nThe start paved the way for what followed.\nDuff had spoken beforehand about spending the last week watching Zurich games, and the Reds embarked with a defensive gameplan that prioritised solidity.\nThey didn’t select a natural striker, with Harry Wood the most advanced player in what was closer to a 5-4-1.\nThe concession of an opening goal inside 30 seconds suggested that any attempt at Shels resistance would be futile.\nCentre halves Sam Bone and Paddy Barrett got in each other’s way in the box and Zurich didn’t have to work too hard to fashion a chance for Nigerian Ifeanyi Matthew to convert from close range.\nIt was tough viewing from an Irish perspective. Shels sought to get bodies behind the ball, yet Zurich still had the quality to find spaces between the lines with the Italian veteran Antonio Marchesano playing with a smile on his face. As the half-hour mark approached, it looked like Shels had plugged some of the gaps.\nBut the second goal was reflective of what tends to happen Irish teams at this level; the weight of pressure created by the physical and mental challenge of facing opponents operating at a higher tempo to regular opponents forces daft mistakes that are clinically punished.\nIt makes Irish sides vulnerable in a position of comfort. Shels had opened out into their shape when Kameron Ledwidge underhit a basic pass to Shane Griffin and one through ball later, Marchesano was chipping Conor Kearns to double the advantage.\nDuff brought in Sean Boyd at half-time in an attempt to turn the tide, but Marchesano quickly added another when reacting quickest to a chipped ball over the top and thereafter it was a damage limitation exercise with Zurich bringing Irish underage international Armstrong Okoflex off the bench amid a raft of changes from both sides.\nThe pace did drop accordingly, albeit with Kearns kept far busier; a final stat of 22 goal attempts to one backed up that point. There was one brief glimpse of Will Jarvis’ ability in one on one situations, skipping away from a Zurich player before putting in a cross for Sean Boyd that was rendered meaningless by an offside the flag.\nFor Shels, the problem was that Jarvis spent most of this match faced in the opposite direction. Next Thursday’s second leg will still be a celebration of how far the club has come – but the Shels priority may well be ensuring that they don’t accrue any issues that could complicate the visit of Derry City five days later.\n“The number one for me is the league,” stressed Duff.\nAfter all, he wants his next European campaign to start in the Champions League.\nFC Zurich: Brecher, Katic, Gomez, Kryeziu, Wallner; Matthew, Conde, Marchesano (Okoflex 71); Krasniqi (Chouiar 59), Perea (Coure 71), Emmanuel (Ligue 81)\nShelbourne: Kearns, Wilson(Boyd 45), Bone, Barrett, Griffin, Ledwidge; O’Sullivan (Smith 76), Coyle (Caffrey 60), Lunney, Jarvis (Tulloch 76); Wood (Coote 64)",

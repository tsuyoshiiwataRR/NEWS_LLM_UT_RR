    "text": "What to know about Christian Yelich's back injury, severity of it, Brewers depth in outfield without him JR Radcliffe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Show Caption\nHide Caption\nChristian Yelich is having another MVP-like year Don't ask Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich for his stats. He says he doesn't know them. Those who do, know he's having a MVP-like year. The Milwaukee Brewers lost their best hitter, Christian Yelich, to the 10-day injured list Wednesday with lower back inflammation, but the recurring injury is likely to sideline him for much longer than 10 days. Milwaukee is staring down the loss of Yelich for the rest of 2024.\nHere's what we know about Yelich's injury.\nWhat exactly is the injury to Christian Yelich's back, and what did Christian Yelich say about it? Is he out for the year? The Brewers have never revealed overly detailed specifics about the injury that has been hampering Yelich for years, but Brewers manager Pat Murphy said Wednesday that a nerve issue is involved, and Yelich was slated to see a specialist in Milwaukee to consider next steps. Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic reported that season-ending surgery was on the table, and Yelich's words seem to indicate that level of gravity.\nHowever, Adam McCalvy of Brewers.com and Rosenthal offered a more optimistic update on the afternoon of July 25, citing a source that indicated there was some optimism Yelich could even be back within a month and that he'd be opting for rest and rehab over surgery.\n“Go from there, as far as what's gonna be the best for the near future and into the future,” Yelich said July 24 on the day he landed on the IL, before seeing a specialist. “So a couple of different discussions I think that need to be had. And kind of try to see where we're going from that.\n“I don’t really want to get into the specifics of it, but, yeah, not great.\"\nMurphy said, \"For what Yeli does for this lineup and this clubhouse, I don’t know there’s too many players who can replace him. ... This is huge, no matter how serious. Whatever number of games we lose him for, it’s serious.\"\nWhen has Christian Yelich been sidelined by the back injury before?\nYelich missed a month of the season with a back issue from April 12 to May 8, which came as a stunner because he had started the year on fire through the first 10 games, with a 1.146 OPS. He has been on the injured list with a back issue four times before but has never required surgery.\nUpon his return, Yelich continued his steady play in his best season since the 2019 campaign, in which he took second in the National League Most Valuable Player voting. His .315 batting average and .406 on-base percentage are both tops in the National League.\nThe back issue has been tricky to negotiate. In 2023, he was sidelined briefly in May and then for a week beginning Sept. 8 in the throes of a playoff chase and, though he returned for one game Sept. 15, he was on the bench for another week immediately after that when the back issue recurred.\nA similar thing happened early in 2021, when Yelich came off the injured list in May for one game and went right back onto it with the back injury.\nWas the back injury a result of the catastrophic knee injury Christian Yelich suffered in 2019? Yelich's injury history includes an unforgettable bad break in 2019, when he fouled a ball off his knee and shattered his knee cap, forcing him to miss the rest of the season. The Brewers went on to lose in the wild-card game in dramatic fashion to Washington, which went on to win the World Series.\nYelich famously couldn't recapture his MVP form in the aftermath. After he signed a long-term extension before 2020, he struggled in the year abbreviated by COVID-19 and wasn't anywhere near the same MVP caliber of play in 2021 and 2022. But he bounced back nicely in 2023 (.818 OPS) and took yet another step forward into his 2024 season, even at age 32.\nBut the back issue predates the knee injury. In fact, he missed five games in April of 2019 with a lower back issue. He missed a couple more games in May . When he missed four games in August with the same issue, the team admitted there was no way of knowing when he might be back ; it was simply an injury that could turn a corner at any moment. That's been a familiar refrain with the back issue — an uncertainty of timeline.\nShould Christian Yelich have skipped the All-Star game? There's zero indication that Yelich appearing in the All-Star game July 16 made the situation worse, although he'd been 0-for-9 since the all-star break and mired in a 1-for-20 slump that extended to the games before the break. Remember, the issue has come and gone on a moment's notice, and the All-Star game is mild workload compared to a regular-season game.\nYelich grounded out twice in the All-Star game and played right field, fielding a line-drive single in the third and a slow-rolling single in the fifth. It was the only time he's played the field since July 9, slotting in as the designated hitter for all the Brewers games since.\nHe had been given a day off July 13 against the Nationals in a loss but played in the July 14 finale, the last game before the break, and he also appeared in the first game after the break and played all 12 innings in a July 20 win over the Twins, laying down a bunt that accounted for a run in extras. He was then held out of the next game July 21.\nWhat are Christian Yelich's stats this year? His .909 OPS is the highest he's had in his career, except for only his back-to-back incredible seasons in Milwaukee, the 2018 MVP season and the 2019 follow-up that was ended prematurely by the knee injury. In those seasons, he hadd OPS marks of 1.000 and 1.100.\nIt would be the best season OPS for any Brewers season from a player age 32 or older with at least 200 plate appearances. Russell Branyan, who had a .925 OPS at age 32 in 2008 over 152 plate appearances, is the only better mark of any player with at least 80 at-bats.\nRyan Braun had a .903 OPS in 2016 at age 32, and Aramis Ramírez had a .901 at age 34 in 2012. By OPS+, a metric that attempts to account for a player's ballparks, it's tied for the best 32-and-over mark in franchise history with Robin Yount, who was 33 in 1989 when he matched Yelich's OPS-plus of 152.\nYelich this season has 11 home runs, 42 RBIs and 21 stolen bases. He would have been in line for a third career batting title at .315 but is unlikely to have enough plate appearances now to qualify for that title.\nWhat is Christian Yelich's contract? Yelich signed a seven-year deal before the 2020 season worth $188.5 million, paying him $22 million a year, and kicking in during the 2022 season. He's owed $22 million a year for 2025-28, and then a mutual option for $20 million in 2029 (or a buyout for $6.5 million). If both sides pick up the option, he becomes an unrestricted free agent in 2030.\nIs Christian Yelich a Hall of Famer? In 2019, there was a very real case that he was on track to be a Hall of Famer, but the struggles in subsequent years — exacerbated in no small part by his back issues — have knocked him off-course.\nAccording to most metrics that track Hall of Fame likelihood, compiled at Baseball-Reference.com , Yelich is well short of the standard. Through age 31, his offensive profile is most similar to players like Andrew McCutchen, Matt Kemp, Vernon Wells and Gary Matthews.\nWhat is the Brewers' outfield depth chart in Christian Yelich's absence?\nThe Brewers are comfortable with outfield depth, although nobody will be able to match Yelich's offense.\nSince Yelich has been mostly as a DH lately, it's given ample playing time to surging rookie corner outfielder Jackson Chourio, plus young speedsters Garrett Mitchell and Sal Frelick, with Blake Perkins as a suitable backup at any spot (particularly center field).\nIn the minors, the team still has right-handed hitter Joey Wiemer, a regular contributor on last year's team, who has a .733 OPS in Class AAA Nashville, with only three homers this season in 50 games. The franchise added Brewer Hicklen, another right-handed bat, to the 40-man roster during the all-star break, and he's had a strong season at AAA. The 28-year-old corner outfielder has a .951 OPS at Nashville, with 19 homers and 28 stolen bases in 77 games.\nSigned as a free agent in November 2023, Hicklen was invited to spring training — and made an impression — but has just four big-league at-bats, coming over the course of six games with Kansas City in 2022.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

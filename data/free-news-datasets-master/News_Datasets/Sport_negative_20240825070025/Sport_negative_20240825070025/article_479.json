    "text": "The ratings and viewership data are in for this week’s (July 24) episode of AEW Dynamite.\nPer\nWrestlenomics, Dynamite netted 786,000 viewers and a 0.26 rating in the 18-49 year old demographic. These numbers are slightly down from last week’s 795K and 0.27, respectively.\nThe beginning of Dynamite was going head-to-head against President Joe Biden’s address to the nation about his decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race (which was watched by\nnearly 29 million people), as well as the news coverage that followed his speech.\nThat likely explains why this episode didn’t see a ratings and viewership increase for the annual Blood & Guts double ring steel cage match. However, Dynamite’s numbers held up well and didn’t really change much from last week, so interest in the Blood & Guts main event seems to have kept fans tuned in. A bunch of people in AEW are probably breathing a sigh of relief about that result.\nAEW doesn’t have a special milestone episode or a Blood & Guts match to promote for next week’s Dynamite, so Tony Khan better get to work on some intriguing matches or big announcements if he wants to keep these numbers from dropping back down to where they were in the final two weeks of June and first two weeks of July.\nHere’s a breakdown of AEW Dynamite viewership and rating in the 18-49 demo over the last year:\n-\nJuly 26, 2023:898,000 / .29\n-\nAug. 2:894,000 / .31\n-\nAug. 9:846,000 / .29\n-\nAug. 16:874,000 / .32\n-\nAug. 23:870,000 / .32\n-\nAug. 30: 871,000 / .30\n-\nSept. 6:887,000 / .31\n-\nSept. 13: 888,000 / .31\n-\nSept. 20: 984,000 / .36\n-\nSept. 27: 855,000 / .28\n-\nOct. 4: 800,000 / .28\n-\nOct. 10: 609,000 / .26\n-\nOct. 18: 901,000 / .31\n-\nOct. 25: 774,000 / .24\n-\nNov. 1: 832,000 / .28\n-\nNov. 8: 804,000 / .27\n-\nNov. 15: 823,000 / .28\n-\nNov. 22: 845,000 / .26\n-\nNov. 29: 858,000 / .29\n-\nDec. 6:823,000 / .25\n-\nDec. 13: 845,000 / .30\n-\nDec. 20: 782,000 / .26\n-\nDec. 27: 843,000 / .31\n-\nJan. 3, 2024: 801,000 / .26\n-\nJan. 10: 797,000 / .29\n-\nJan. 17: 891,000 / .33\n-\nJan. 24: 837,000 / .27\n-\nJan. 31: 818,000 / .26\n-\nFeb. 7: 805,000 / .28\n-\nFeb. 14: 811,000 / .30\n-\nFeb. 21: 828,000 / .29\n-\nFeb. 28: 822,000 / .29\n-\nMar. 6: 779,000 / .27\n-\nMar. 13: 801,000 / .27\n-\nMar. 20: 800,000 / .27\n-\nMar. 27: 747,000 / .23\n-\nApr. 3: 752,000 / .23\n-\nApr. 10: 819,000 / .30\n-\nApr. 17: 762,000 / .26\n-\nApr. 24: 683,000 / .23\n-\nMay 1: 703,000 / .24\n-\nMay 8: 711,000 / .24\n-\nMay 15: 672,000 / .23\n-\nMay 22: 713,000 / .24\n-\nMay 29: 787,000 / .25\n-\nJune 5: 790,000 / .28\n-\nJune 12: 681,000 / .23\n-\nJune 19: 502,000 / .16\n-\nJune 26: 680,000 / .22\n-\nJuly 3: 688,000 / .23\n-\nJuly 10: 691,000 / .23\n-\nJuly 17: 795,000 / .27\n- July 24: 786,000 / .26\nFor complete results and this week’s Dynamite live blog click\nhere.

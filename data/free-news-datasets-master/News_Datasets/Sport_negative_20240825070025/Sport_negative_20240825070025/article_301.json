    "text": "The Olympic tennis competition has suffered another blow with women's third seed Elena Rybakina joining a lengthy list of non-starters due to illness just hours after the draw took place at Roland Garros.\nThe big-serving 25-year-old Kazakh was down to face Romania's Jaqueline Cristian in the first round of the singles.\n\"It is difficult for me to announce this, but unfortunately, I will not be able to participate in the Paris Olympics.\n\"After Wimbledon, I contracted acute bronchitis, and despite trying to return to training, my body has yet to recover. The doctors have strictly forbidden me from going to court,\" Rybakina posted on Instagram.\nRybakina's withdrawal means France's Caroline Garcia moves into her spot in the draw as the 17th seed while Australian Daria Saville enters the draw as an alternate.\nWith the action to begin on Saturday, the flurry of high-profile withdrawals has cast something of a cloud over the tournament being staged on the Parisian clay.\nOn Wednesday, men's world No.1 and top seed Jannik Sinner of Italy had to withdraw from the singles and doubles because of illness while exciting Danish youngster Holger Rune also pulled out on Wednesday with a wrist injury.\nCzech player Marketa Vondrousova, who was runner-up in the singles in Tokyo three years ago, withdrew on Monday because of injury, as did Poland's Hubert Hurkacz because of a knee injury sustained at Wimbledon.\nmedal tally Game On Paris\nLoading... Full Medal Tally Olympics Coverage Switzerland's Belinda Bencic, the champion in Tokyo, is also missing after giving birth to a daughter in April.\nTwo-time Olympic singles champion Andy Murray announced before Thursday's draw he was not fit enough to compete in the singles but would still play doubles with Dan Evans.\nOther notable absences from the tennis at the Games include world No.3 Aryna Sabalenka, Tunisia's Ons Jabeur, Britain's Emma Raducanu, American Ben Shelton and Tokyo men's bronze medal winner Pablo Carreno Busta of Spain.",

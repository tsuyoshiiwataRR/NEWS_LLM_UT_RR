    "text": "The subject of trade rumors as Tuesday's deadline approaches, Oakland Athletics All-Star right-handed closer Mason Miller landed on the 15-day injured list on Thursday with a fracture of his left pinky finger. The move is retroactive to Tuesday. To fill Miller's spot on the 40-man roster, the A's activated right-hander Ross Stripling (elbow) to start Thursday night's series opener against the host Los Angeles Angels. Per MLB.com , Miller broke the finger while preparing to exercise in the trainers' room inside the A's clubhouse after Monday's win over the Houston Astros. The rookie placed his left hand on the training table in an awkward position, causing the injury. Miller had sealed the 4-0 victory with an 11-pitch, 1-2-3 ninth inning. Miller, 25, has five years of team control remaining after this season, but his electrifying stuff has contenders interested in obtaining his services. In 34 appearances in 2024, he is 1-1 with a 2.21 ERA and 15 saves and leads all relievers with 70 strikeouts in 40 2/3 innings. Miller also leads MLB with 306 pitches at 100 mph or harder and broke the record for the fastest pitch in All-Star Game history at 103.6 mph (since pitch-tracking began in 2008). He fired a perfect inning, striking out Shohei Ohtani and Trea Tuner en route to earning the win. Since making his major league debut with Oakland last season, Miller is 1-4 with a 2.92 ERA in 44 games (six starts) with 15 saves and 108 strikeouts in 74 innings. --Field Level Media",

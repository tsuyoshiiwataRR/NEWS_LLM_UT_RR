    "text": "Oakland closer Mason Miller will be placed on the injured list with a broken left pinky finger, which he suffered after “put his hand down awkwardly on the training table while getting ready to do an exercise,” per the MLB.com’s Martin Gallegos.\nImportant clarification on Mason Miller injury: he did not pound the table out of frustration. He put his hand down awkwardly on the training table while getting ready to do an exercise.— Martín Gallegos (@MartinJGallegos)\n [July 25, 2024]\nMiller has been one of the best closers in baseball this season, posting a 2.21 ERA while logging 15 and 70 strikeouts over 40 2/3 innings.\nThe 25-year-old was named to his first All-Star team this season. During that contest, Miller pitched a hitless frame and recorded the fastest pitch in MLB All-Star game history, with one of his fastballs coming in at 103.4 MPH.\nMason Miller Masterclass.— Oakland A's (@Athletics)\n[pic.twitter.com/LxRKtfWpvO] [July 17, 2024]\nWith MLB’s July 30 trade deadline fast-approaching and the Athletics sitting dead last in the AL West, Miller’s name has been thrown around in trade rumors recently. There’s still a chance he gets dealt by the deadline despite the injury, given this aliment is to his non-throwing hand.\nCurrently, there is no timeline for Miller’s return.\nAll odds provided by\nDraftKings Sportsbook and all odds subject to change.\nThe Crown Is Yours:\nSign up for DraftKings and experience the ultimate host for games and betting experiences!\nI am a promoter at DraftKings and am also an avid fan and user (my username is Hunta512) and may sometimes play on my personal account in the games that I offer advice on.

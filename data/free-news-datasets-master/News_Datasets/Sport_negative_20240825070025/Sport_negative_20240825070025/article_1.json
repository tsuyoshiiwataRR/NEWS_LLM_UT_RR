And whereas this might actually be the right decision, it will never feel that way. Simply because I love the sport with all my heart and I'm thankful for the memories and opportunities it has given me.\n\"The Olympics, I've participated in so far, have been more than just competitions as they represent different chapters of my life as a tennis player: the climb, the peak... and now, the finish line.\"\nKerber has 14 career singles titles, including the Australian Open and U.S. Open, both in 2016, and Wimbledon in 2018.\nShe will face another former No. 1, Naomi Osaka, in the opening round of the Olympics. Kerber won a silver medal in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\nKerber retires as one of only nine women to win more than $30 million on tour and with a singles record of 680-377 (.643).\n--Field Level Media",

    "text": "DeMario Douglas entered training camp as the [New England Patriots](https://www.patspulpit.com/)’ projected No. 1 wide receiver. But while he was present for the first two practice sessions of the summer, his contributions were limited: he did not participate in any team drills on Wednesday and Friday. The reason behind his absence is an apparent injury. According to a [report](https://x.com/PhilAPerry/status/1816524207628730783) by Phil Perry of NBC Sports, the second-year wideout is dealing with a hand issue. Dakota Randall of Pro Football Network [spotted](https://x.com/DakRandall/status/1816523168997343453) him after practice “wearing tape on his left thumb/wrist.” The ailment does not appear to be of the major variety, though. Douglas was not placed on any pre-camp injury lists, and did still participate in warmups and positional work over the first two days. He did not show any further limitations. In his absence from team drills, Ja’Lynn Polk has been given extended opportunities. The second-round draft choice was the first man up in 7-on-7s and 11-on-11s with Douglas unavailable. Douglas, 23, joined the Patriots as a sixth-round selection in the 2023 NFL Draft. He became one of the team’s most prolific playmakers right out of the gate and eventually ended his rookie campaign as New England’s leader in receiving yards. He gained 561 yards on 49 catches, while additionally averaging 5.1 yards on 11 punt returns. He also was forced to miss three total games due to a pair of concussions. Nonetheless, expectations were — and remain — high for Douglas entering Year 2. He and the rest of his Patriots teammates will be back on the practice fields on Friday, 11 a.m. ET.",

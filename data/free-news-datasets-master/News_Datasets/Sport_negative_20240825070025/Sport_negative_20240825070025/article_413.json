    "text": "WEST HAM want to take the FA to court to stop them banning Lucas Paqueta from football.\nSunSport revealed last month that the\nFA are pushing for a life ban for the Brazil international, who they charged with four counts of spot-fixing in May. West Ham are backing Paqueta and are considering going to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne to prevent the FA hearing the case.\nThe club are questioning the FA's jurisdiction as all of the suspicious betting linked to Paqueta took place in Brazil, where there is a higher burden of proof in sports disciplinary cases.\nWest Ham also argue that it is unreasonable that a player could lose his career in a disciplinary hearing based on the balance of probabilities, the threshold for a guilty verdict in FA cases.\nAs SunSport revealed last month, the FA's charges sheet issued to Paqueta in May included a recommendation that he be banned for life, which left West Ham stunned and increased their determination to fight for him.\nWest Ham could also bring FIFA into a legal challenge at CAS, as they would be asked to make a ban apply worldwide if Paqueta was found guilty by the FA, which in most cases is a formality.\nPaqueta has been in Brazil or representing his country at the Copa America since being charged in May, but is due to re-join West Ham in Tampa next week on their pre-season tour of the United States.\nThe 26-year-old insists he is innocent of all charges and is determined to clear his name.\nPaqueta will be available for West Ham for most of the season as the hearing will not take place until next year at the earliest due to the complexity of the case and the difficulty of obtaining evidence from Brazil.\nMost read in Football\nA West Ham appeal to CAS would delay the hearing even further.\nWest Ham and the FA were approached for comment.\nPaqueta joined the Londoners two years ago for an initial club-record £50million from French side Lyon.\nHe’s since scored 13 goals and laid on a further 14 assists in 84 games.\nLast summer saw\nPaqueta come close to joining Manchester City for £85m before the champs backed out of talks.\nSUNSPORT'S TRANSFER NEWS LIVE\nSTAY in the know this summer with The Sun's transfer experts.\nArsenal star\nEmile Smith Rowe is closing in on a £34million switch to Fulham. Trent Alexander-Arnold is committed to Liverpool this season despite interest from Real Madrid. Chelsea have made a bid for Villarreal goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen, according to reports.\nFollow our LIVE TRANSFER BLOG for all the latest deals, gossip and exclusives.",

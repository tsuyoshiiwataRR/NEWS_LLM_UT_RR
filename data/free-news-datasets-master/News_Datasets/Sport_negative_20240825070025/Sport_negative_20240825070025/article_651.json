    "text": "(Photo by Andy Lyons/Getty Images)\nWith the Dallas Cowboys still dealing with the aftermath of an ugly playoff loss to the upstart Green Bay Packers in the first round last season, America‚Äôs Team has been dealing with nothing but distractions during this NFL offseason, with Dak Prescott‚Äôs contract situation being at the top of the list.\nAfter losing to the Packers the way they did, many anticipated the Cowboys making some drastic moves this offseason, but that didn‚Äôt happen, as longtime team owner Jerry Jones has taken an unexpected direction.\nThat direction is being intent on sticking by head coach Mike McCarthy and signing Prescott to a lucrative long-term deal, which could be big enough to reset the quarterback market in the NFL, and that might not be sitting well with the diehard fans of the storied franchise.\nHowever, a deal between Prescott and the Cowboys has yet to get done, leading some to think he could be playing elsewhere after next season, which the veteran quarterback seems to be coming to terms with via Ari Meirov of The 33rd Team.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna say it. I want to be here, but when you look up‚Äîall the great QBs I watched played for other teams. That‚Äôs not something to fear. It may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision,‚Äù Prescott said.\n#Cowboys QB Dak Prescott: \"I'm gonna say it. I want to be here, but when you look up‚Äîall the great QBs I watched played for other teams. That's not something to fear. It may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision.\" üëÄ\n(üé• @JetthroTV ) pic.twitter.com/03NH7kaxHl\n‚Äî Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) July 25, 2024\nWith the Cowboys having one of the most talented teams on both sides of the football, it would be a shame to see it all fall apart, but that could happen, with CeeDee Lamb also wanting a new deal and Micah Parsons likely being the next in line after that.\nDallas will be expected to have a solid 2024 campaign, but things are definitely not trending in the right direction right now as the team is dealing with constant distractions rather than a focus on the field as training camp gets underway.",

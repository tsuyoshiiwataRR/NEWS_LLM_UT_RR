    "text": "Memphis deputy AD Jeff Crane leaving for South Carolina | Source Jason Munz Memphis Commercial Appeal Memphis deputy athletic director Jeff Crane is leaving for a similar position at South Carolina , a source with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed to The Commercial Appeal on Thursday.\nThe source requested anonymity because an official announcement has not yet been made.\nCrane recently served as the Tigers' interim AD for almost two months as university president Bill Hardgrave conducted the search for a permanent AD.\nOn June 26, Hardgrave named former Virginia deputy AD Ed Scott as the eighth AD of Memphis. Crane, who came to Memphis from South Carolina in April 2019, was one of three finalists for the job, along with Scott and Tennessee deputy AD Ryan Alpert.\nCrane isn't the only member of the Tigers' athletic department to leave in recent weeks . Michael Schroeder (associate AD for integrated communications and marketing), Josh Moore (assistant AD for marketing and game-day presentation) and Emily Hagans (director of athletic stewardship engagement) each left Memphis to reunite with former Memphis AD Laird Veatch at Missouri earlier this month.\nSince arriving at Memphis, Crane has been instrumental in a number of key initiatives. Most notably, he was heavily involved in the ongoing Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium renovation project , as well as the department's work to secure its funding. Schroeder was also a member of the athletic department's working group for the planning of the $220 million renovations to the stadium.\nAs the sport administrator for football, Crane also had a hand in promoting Ryan Silverfield to head coach following Mike Norvell's departure for Florida State in 2019. Crane also served as the men's basketball sport administrator for the 2019-20 season.\nMEMPHIS ATHLETICS: New Memphis AD Ed Scott, eager to get going: 'We cannot do this alone'\nCrane wore multiple hats previous stint at South Carolina (where he spent 13 years), including executive associate athletics director, which he worked his way up to from director of marketing. He came to South Carolina from his alma mater, TCU, where he held the same title from July 2004 to July 2006.\nDuring Crane's time at South Carolina, he also spent three months in 2018 as interim AD at USC Upstate in Spartanburg, S.C. He led the search for both a permanent AD and a head men's basketball coach during that time.\nReach sports writer Jason Munz at jason.munz@commercialappeal.com or follow him @munzly on X, the social media app formerly known as Twitter.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

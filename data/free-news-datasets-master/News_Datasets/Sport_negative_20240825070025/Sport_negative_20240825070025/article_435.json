    "text": "Charlotte Dujardin condemned by long-time Team GB team-mate Carl Hester after 2024 Paris Olympic Games withdrawal Carl Hester, a long-time Team GB team-mate of Charlotte Dujardin, is one of a group of leading dressage riders to condemn her actions. Dujardin pulled out of the Olympic Games in Paris after a video emerged showing her making “an error of judgement”. The International Dressage Riders Club issued a statement saying it \"supported\" the decision to provisionally suspend her. The actions of Charlotte Dujardin have been “universally” condemned by a group of leading dressage riders, including her long-time Team GB team-mate Carl Hester. The three-time Olympic champion [pulled out of the Paris 2024 Games](https://www.eurosport.com/olympics/olympic-games-paris-2024/2024/charlotte-dujardin-paris-2024-olympic-games_sto20020306/story.shtml)when an old video came to light showing her making “an error of judgement”. Britain's joint-most decorated female Olympian has subsequently been provisionally suspended by equestrian's governing body the FEI. Dujardin – who says she is “deeply ashamed” of her actions – has been replaced by Becky Moody in the Team GB squad. Hester was one of 10 board members of the International Dressage Riders Club to sign a letter condemning Dujardin’s actions. The letter reads: “The IDRC universally condemn the actions of Charlotte Dujardin as seen in the video footage which was made public this morning by Stephan Wensing from European Equine Lawyers on behalf of his client. “The Board members are resolute that equine welfare must always be placed uppermost and at all times. They promote only ethical training methods and practices and strive to encourage all their members to abide by the ‘International Equestrian Federation (FEI) Code of Conduct for the Welfare of the Horse’ together with all FEI regulations which support and protect equine welfare standards both in and out of competition. “The IDRC Board supports the actions taken by the FEI, the British Equestrian Federation and British Dressage to provisionally suspend Ms Dujardin. “It notes that Ms Dujardin has stated she has no excuse for her actions and has also expressed her shame and regret. Due to the live and on-going investigations the Board will not make any further official announcements on this matter until the investigations are concluded.” Hester – who is preparing for his seventh Olympics next week - won team and individual gold alongside Dujardin at the London 2012 Olympics. He is part of the quartet of Team GB riders taking part in dressage competitions at the Games. - - - [discovery+](https://get.discoveryplus.com/gb/sport/olympic-games?utm_campaign=UK-EU-D1-WBD-C7-EU-CAM-DR-W-SummerSports-Olympics-240726-&utm_medium=xp&utm_source=eurosport&utm_content=text-owned-eurosport-id1)is the streaming home of the Olympic Games, and the only place you can watch every moment of Paris 2024 this summer.

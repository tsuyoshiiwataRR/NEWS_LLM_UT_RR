    "text": "(Photo by Joe Sargent/Getty Images)\nAfter a disappointing short stint with the Denver Broncos, one-time Super Bowl champion Russell Wilson has been given a chance at another fresh start in the NFL by signing with the Pittsburgh Steelers to become their new starter under center.\nEven though the Steelers did not wait long before creating a quarterback controversy by trading for Justin Fields, who was pushed out of town due to the Chicago Bears drafting Caleb Williams with the No. 1 overall pick, Wilson presumably will start the upcoming 2024 NFL season on top of the depth chart at the quarterback position.\nUnfortunately for Wilson, an injury issue has popped up at the start of training camp with the Steelers, as longtime head coach Mike Tomlin let it be known that the veteran quarterback was held out of practice on Thursday due to a calf issue, resulting in Fields getting first-team reps, according to Ari Meirov of The 33rd Team.\n#Steelers QB Russell Wilson woke up with a calf issue this morning and was held out of practice, per HC Mike Tomlin. He’s considered day-to-day. Justin Fields took first-team reps. pic.twitter.com/fxH0wco0JK\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) July 25, 2024\nAt 35 years old, with as many miles as Wilson has on his body from all the games played with the Seattle Seahawks and Broncos, a calf issue is a legitimate concern because it can lead to a more severe problem like a torn Achilles tendon, like fellow veteran quarterbacks Kirk Cousins and Aaron Rodgers, suffered last year with their respective teams.\nIt’ll be interesting to see how the Steelers handle this calf issue and if it helps give Fields an opportunity to jump ahead of the veteran on the depth chart in Pittsburgh.",

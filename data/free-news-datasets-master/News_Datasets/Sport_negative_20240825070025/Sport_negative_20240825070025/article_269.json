While they have completely revamped their bottom six, they still lack the last star they need.\nBecause of this, one player who stood out as a potential trade target for the Sabres was Philadelphia Flyers forward Travis Konecny . The London, Ontario native was set to become an unrestricted free agent next summer, but now that will officially not be coming to fruition.\nKonecny has signed an eight-year, $70 million contract extension with the Flyers. With this, there is no question that he will be staying with the Flyers for a very long time.\nTravis Konecny\n© Kyle Ross-USA TODAY Sports\nKonecny would have been an excellent addition to the Sabres' lineup if acquired. The 27-year-old has become a star for Philadelphia, and last season was no different. In 76 games with the Metropolitan Division club, he had 33 goals and 68 points - both new career highs.\nWhile the chances of Konecny getting dealt during next season are non-existent after this deal, the Sabres still have other potential top-six options which they could target. Some include Nikolaj Ehlers ( Winnipeg Jets ), Trevor Zegras ( Anaheim Ducks ), and Frank Vatrano (Ducks).\nRecent Sabres News Sabres Surging Forward Is Big-Time Breakout Candidate\nSabres Reveal Numbers for New Additions\nSabres Have Target in Ex-Canadiens Forward\nSabres Have Prime Target in Former All-Star\nPromising Sabres Prospect Can't Be Slept On\nSabres Hit Home Run Drafting Rising Star\nSabres Newcomer Should Hit Higher Level",

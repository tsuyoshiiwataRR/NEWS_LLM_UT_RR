Mumbai: The Indian Premier League 2024 was a nightmarish season for captain Hardik Pandya as he got booed around stadiums in India and the results were also not coming his way. Months after the IPL, MI’s premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah has broken silence on the matter. In an interaction with The Indian Express, Bumrah explained the emotions of fans in India and that it is extremely difficult for a player to deal with it.\n“We understand (that) we live in a country where emotion is really the talking point. It’s an emotion-driven country. We understand that fans do get emotional, and players are also emotional,” Bumrah began.\n“It does affect that you’re an India player, and you’re playing in India, and your own fans are speaking that about you. But it is the way it is. You’ve got to take it on your chin. How can you go out there and stop people?\n“If you start focussing on yourself, you try to shut that door,” said Bumrah.\nHardik turned things around after a horrendous IPL at the 2024 T20 World Cup where he bowled the final over in the summit clash and took India over the line. Times changed for Hardik and fans would be hoping that the Indian all-rounder keeps coming up with good performances in the upcoming season.",

    "text": "You'd be hard-pressed to find a better example of a team lacking self-awareness in training camp more than the Las Vegas Raiders on Thursday. The team passed around a Kermit the Frog puppet dressed as Patrick Mahomes, mocking the Kansas City Chiefs' quarterback that has won more playoff games in their stadium than they have. This Raiders Kermit Mahomes doll is going to age abysmallyâ€” The 33rd Team (@The33rdTeamFB) [pic.twitter.com/Z4p5GNCgZL] [July 25, 2024] Mahomes is 10-2 against the Raiders in his career, and has never lost to the Raiders in Oakland/Las Vegas. In those 12 games, he's thrown 30 touchdowns to just four interceptions and has a passer rating of 109.6. The Chiefs haven't won less than 10 games since 2014. Meanwhile, the Raiders have one winning season since 2016. The Raiders beating the Chiefs on Christmas day last year was their Super Bowl. The Chiefs' Super Bowl was winning the actual Super Bowl for the third time in the Mahomes era in the Raiders' building. The point is why poke the bear if you're the Raiders? Why would you give Mahomes any extra motivation to embarrass you twice a year?",

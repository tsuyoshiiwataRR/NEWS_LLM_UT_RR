    "text": "NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricket team captain Shahid Afridi has criticized the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for its frequent changes in leadership and structure, asserting that these constant changes negatively impact the team's performance. Afridi emphasized the necessity for stability and long-term planning to ensure the team's success, suggesting a collaborative approach involving senior board members and experienced players to create a cohesive, long-term strategy for Pakistan cricket.In an interview with Sports24, Afridi stressed the importance of allowing new systems time to develop and take effect. He pointed out that the continuous introduction of new leadership and structures hampers the team's growth and consistency.112021751\\\"When you change or bring in any new structure, you must give the system time. Every year, a new chairman comes, and a new system is introduced. Things don't work this way,\\\" Afridi stated.Afridi proposed a more unified strategy, involving both senior board members and veteran players, to develop a sustainable plan for Pakistan cricket. He argued that such a plan should be allowed to run its course over a few years for effective results.112022978\\\"All the senior board members and senior players should sit together at one table and make a plan. Then let that plan be executed for three years. Let the results come. If you keep changing the system every year, what results can you expect?\\\" he added.Afridi's remarks come at a time when the PCB is under scrutiny for its handling of player affairs and administrative changes. The former skipper's call for stability is a plea for a more structured and consistent approach to cricket administration in Pakistan, which he believes is crucial for the team's success.",

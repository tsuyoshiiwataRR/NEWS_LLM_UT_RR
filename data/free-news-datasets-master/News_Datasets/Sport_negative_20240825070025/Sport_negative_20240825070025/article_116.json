    "text": "AEW Dynamite ratings down slightly for Blood & Guts Wednesday night’s Blood & Guts episode of AEW Dynamite [averaged 786,000 viewers](https://wrestlenomics.com/tv-ratings/2024/aew-dynamite-jul-24-on-tbs-786000-viewers-0-26-p18-49-rating-tv-ratings-attendance-analysis/) on TBS, down 1.1 percent from the previous week. It’s the second-highest audience total the show has done since June 5. In the 18-49 demo, Dynamite drew a 0.26 rating. That’s down 3.7 percent from last week but is also the second-highest rating the show has done in that category since June 5. It’s the third-best rating Dynamite has drawn going back to April 10. The start of the episode went head-to-head with a national address from President Joe Biden about his decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race. The address aired across many networks on both cable and network TV. As compared to the same week in 2023 (which was one week later than Blood & Guts), Dynamite was down 12.5 percent in overall viewers and down 10.3 percent in the 18-49 demo. It was down 17.5 percent overall and down 23.5 percent in 18-49 from the 2023 edition of Blood & Guts. Listed below are the last 11 weeks of overall viewership totals and 18-49 demo ratings for Dynamite, along with the 10-week average in both categories. This week’s show was up 12.3 percent in overall viewers and up 13 percent in 18-49 as compared to the recent averages.",

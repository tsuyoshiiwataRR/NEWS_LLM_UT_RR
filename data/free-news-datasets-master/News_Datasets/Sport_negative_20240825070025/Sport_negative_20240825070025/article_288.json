    "text": "Rafael Nadal has repeatedly struggled with injuries recently. Now his coach is talking about a setback shortly before the Olympics. According to his coach, Spanish tennis star Rafael Nadal is worried about his participation in the Olympic Games in Paris. The 38-year-old canceled a training session with Alexander Zverev scheduled for Thursday due to a \"minor setback\", as coach Carlos Moya told Spanish radio station Onda Cero. It remains to be seen whether Nadal will be able to compete at the Olympic tournament. \"I can't guarantee anything. We have to wait and see,\" said the former professional Moya. The first match in the Olympic doubles with his compatriot Carlos Alcaraz is scheduled for Saturday. Nadal's first round singles match against Hungary's Marton Fucsovics would therefore take place on Sunday at the Stade Roland Garros. If the Spaniard were to qualify for the second round, it would most likely be a clash of giants with top seed Novak Djokovic. The Serbian world number 2 will face the 36-year-old Australian doubles specialist Matthew Ebden in the starting round. It would be the 60th meeting between the 24-time Grand Slam winner Djokovic and the 22-time Grand Slam winner Nadal. The two tennis legends already played against each other at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Back then, Nadal came out on top after a thrilling fight. No grass court season Nadal has been struggling with injuries of late. The 22-time Grand Slam tournament winner had recently skipped the grass court season and prepared for the Olympics instead. Before the Paris Games, he returned to the tournament in Bastad, Sweden, where he reached the final. Nadal wore a bandage on his right thigh during training with his doubles partner Alcaraz on Wednesday. Moya said that he would now have to see how the condition improves.",

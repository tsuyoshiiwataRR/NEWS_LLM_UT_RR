    "text": "25 Jul. 2024 Norway, one the favourites of the women's tournament at Paris 2024, failed to claim any points in their opening match, losing to fellow Scandinavian team Sweden in a fast-paced and thrilling match, 28:32. PARIS 2024 OLYMPIC GAMES â€“ PRELIMINARY ROUND GROUP A Norway vs Sweden 28:32 (17:15) Norway's veteran goalkeeper Katrine Lunde, who is participating in her fifth Olympics, played her 33rd match at this level, which is a record for a female handball player had a good outing, recording 14 saves for a 32% efficiency. However, her Swedish colleague Johanna Bundsen had even better statistics, ending the match with 18 saves and a 41% efficiency. She started to show her quality early in the match, and following a very close fight early in the opening minutes, Sweden were the first to take a two-goal lead, 7:5, 10 minutes into the game. Norway had to play without Henny Reistad, who is still sidelined with an ankle injury, but goals and assists from Stine Oftedal helped them to draw level soon. However, Sweden gained momentum and continued to dominate. Their leaders Nathalie Hagman and Jamina Roberts were clinical in attack, and the Sweden defended well, creating a three-goal advantage (13:10) in the 19th minute. However, Norway weathered the storm and improved their defence a lot late in the first half, as Lunde made some important saves. Sweden were restricted to just two goals in the last 10 minutes of the half, and it was the Norwegian team who had a better mood at the break, enjoying a two-goal advantage. Early in the second half, two goals from Nora Mork saw Norway increasing the gap to 19:15 before Sweden scored their first goal after the restart in the 37th minute. But despite losing Linn Blohm following her third two-minute suspension, Sweden refused to give up. Bundsen's further saves as well as Hagman's goals helped them to hit back and draw level at 22:22 with 15 minutes to go. It was still anyone's game, and for a while, the sides went on to trade goals. Sweden's centre back Emma Lindquist was on fire late in the game, and her string of goals helped her team to pull ahead at 27:25. However, Norway took a timeout and drew level within just a few minutes, leaving the question about the winner open. But Norway looked nervous in the crucial phase, and their turnovers combined with Bundsen's saves helped Sweden to pull clear by three goals, 30:27, so the game was basically settled. Hagman and Nina Koppang scored eight and seven goals respectively for Sweden, while Mork and Oftedal netted seven times each for the losing side, as Sweden delivered a 32:28 win and opened their account at Paris 2024.",

    "text": "Elena Rybakina pulls out of Olympic tennis competition [Field Level Media](/author/fieldlevelmedia/)|published: Thu Jul 25 2024 18:17 Kazakhstan's Elena Rybakina withdrew from the Paris Olympics tennis competition on Thursday. The 2022 Wimbledon champion pulled out just hours after the draw was announced at Roland Garros. Rybakina, who was seeded third in singles, also was due to compete in mixed doubles with Alexander Bublik. In a statement posted to its website, the Kazakhstan Tennis Federation said Rybakina, 25, is ill. \"At the moment Elena is suffering from acute bronchitis, and doctors have strictly forbidden her not only to go to court but even to fly to the event,\" the statement read. \"Rybakina was actively preparing for the games, expecting to perform at a high level of play at the Olympics, but due to her condition, it has now become impossible.\" The eight-time WTA Tour winner lost to Ukraine's Elina Svitolina in the bronze-medal match at the Tokyo Games in 2021. France's Caroline Garcia will take Rybakina's spot in the draw as the 17th seed, with Australia's Daria Saville entering the draw as an alternate. --Field Level Media",

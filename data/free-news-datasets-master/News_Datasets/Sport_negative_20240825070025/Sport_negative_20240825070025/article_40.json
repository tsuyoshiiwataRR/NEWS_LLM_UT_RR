In the video, Dujardin, who has won six Olympic equestrian medals three gold, a silver and two bronze repeatedly strikes a horse being ridden by another person as an onlooker laughs. The video, released by Stephan Wensing, a Dutch lawyer who specializes in equine matters, and published by several British news outlets, surfaced a day after Dujardin announced that she was pulling out of the Paris Games, which begin on Friday, for what she said was an error of judgment during a coaching session. Dujardin, 39, did not specify what she had done, but said in a statement on social media, What happened was completely out of character and does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils. https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/sports/charlotte-dujardin-equestrian-olympics-video.html?algo=combo_clicks_decay_6_lda_unique_80_diversified&block=3&campaign_id=142&emc=edit_fory_20240724&fellback=false&imp_id=8266916833791995&instance_id=129648&nl=for-you&nlid=73531149&pool=channel-replacement-ls&rank=2®i_id=73531149&req_id=4011981124247383&segment_id=173045&surface=for-you-email-channelless&te=1&user_id=db9d459f127fb29b368adfd6055fb9af&variant=0_channel_translated_pool_popularity_pers",

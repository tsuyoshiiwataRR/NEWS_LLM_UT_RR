    "text": "IKIN WILLIAM, remembered as an equipment manager extraordinare with several Trinidad and Tobago national football teams, passed away on Tuesday morning.\nThe news of Williams’ passing was relayed by former national coach Everald “Gally” Cummings yesterday.\nA member of the national team staff since the days of the 1989 Strike Squad national team, Williams would have been the most capped person on the Trinidad and Tobago squad, had staff members been awarded national caps. Williams served under several national coaches, among then Cummings, Alvin Corneal, Muhammed Isa, Francisco Maturana and Leo Beenhakker, when T&T finally qualified for a FIFA World Cup in 2006.\n”He was there when I was playing. I played for Trinidad and Tobago and he was the equipment manager, and then I also worked with him,” stated Anton Corneal, currently the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association’s Technical Director.\nA former Malvern player, Williams was a Government Printery worker for 41 years before starting to help out the national team on a voluntary basis.\n“He (Williams) was a very amicable person, that did his job in the most professional manner that you could ask of anybody,” Corneal recalled.\n“He was very private, but even with such a private lifestyle, he was a very personable person. Easy to communicate with, always willing to help, to assist, to find a solution,” Corneal added.\nAlso yesterday, the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association (TTFA) mourned Williams’ passing.\nTTFA president Kieron Edwards said to Williams’ family: “Please accept my heartfelt condolences. Ikin’s legacy will be remembered fondly, and his impact on the football community will never be forgotten. May you find comfort in the memories you shared and in knowing the positive influence he had on so many lives through his service in football.”\nA TTFA release added: “As the equipment manager for the 2006 Trinidad and Tobago World Cup Squad and the Strike Squad, his dedication and contributions to Trinidad and Tobago’s football legacy were invaluable. His commitment to the position of “kitman” and the teams he served was evident in every match and every campaign.”\nThe release continued: “Ikin’s role as an equipment manager went far beyond simply handling gear and supplies. He was the unsung hero behind the scenes, ensuring that every player had what they needed to perform at their best. From meticulously preparing equipment for training sessions to making sure everything was in perfect order on game days, Ikin’s attention to detail and unwavering support were second to none. His ability to anticipate and meet the needs of the players and coaching staff demonstrated his genuine care for the team’s well-being.”",

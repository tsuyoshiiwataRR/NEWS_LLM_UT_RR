    "text": "Escuchar\nPARIS (particular correspondent).- The conflict of planets is coming within the rugby sevens of the Olympic Video games: Argentina-France, “the match of morbidity” that will probably be performed within the unimaginable environment supplied by the Stade de France. After the thunderous boos, After the Pumas had been labeled as “public enemies No. 1” Ranging from the primary day because of very contemporary soccer rivalries, each groups will play the quarter-finals immediately at 4:30 p.m. in our nation. All or nothing. Whoever wins will battle for a medal. Whoever loses, goodbye to the hope of a podium in Paris 2024.\nWhy will they face one another? The Pumas 7s had been unable to take care of the great kind they’d proven within the first spherical and fell to Australia by 22 to 14, a defeat that left them in second place in Group B. On this manner, the staff led by Santiago Gómez Cora, who had already certified for the quarterfinals, will play this spherical in opposition to none aside from the locals, who as a result of fall in opposition to Fiji (12-19) completed second in Group C.\nThe match in opposition to France will probably be heated, given the hostile local weather of the native followers in the direction of the Argentines. The precedent is the Grand Closing in Madrid, initially of June, the place there have been a number of moments of preventing between the gamers, one thing that altered the environment, and which ended with the sanction of Rodrigo Isgró. There are various causes to think about that the assembly will probably be a cauldron. With a house crowd decided to create a hellish environment for Argentina, and logically ready to cheer on Les Bleus, who’ve been enjoying erratically. A match to not be missed, after the scandal that was unleashed with the nationwide soccer staff in opposition to Morocco in St. Etienne. And it’s clear: the booing will probably be at its peak when Santiago Gómez Cora’s staff seems on the pitch.\nThe primary match was in 1997 in Punta del Este and France gained 26-0. Since then, they’ve performed 86 rugby sevens matches, with 50 wins for Argentina, 34 for the French and a pair of attracts. The final match was within the decisive match of the Grand Closing in Madrid, and the French staff gained 19-5. Earlier than that match, Los Pumas 7’s had gained 5 consecutive matches.\nArgentina took the sphere to sustained booing, a trademark of those Olympic Video games. The massive information was the return to the beginning lineup of Marcos Moneta, the very best offensive participant for Santiago Gómez Cora’s staff, who has recovered from a long-term harm. Argentina had Pellandini, Elizalde, Schulz, Alvarez, Osadczsuk, Luciano González and Moneta within the beginning lineup.\nArgentina couldn’t overcome AustraliaSantiago Filipuzzi/Particular Envoy\nAfter two minutes, Luciano González confirmed his nice qualities: energy and the power to cease and begin. He captured a ball, superior with these weapons and left Germán Schulz to dive in for the attempt.\nWith a minute and a half to go in a interval managed by Argentina, a protracted Australian kick led to a controversial motion that needed to be reviewed by the TMO: Luciano González prevented the quantity 12 from reaching the attempt. He did stop it, sure, however at a excessive price. The infringement price him a yellow card. To high it off, within the subsequent motion, Australia reached the attempt by Hutchison. And ultimately, the Oceania staff struck once more. They gained the exit at altitude and Dowling’s escape resulted in one other conquest. It was two deadly minutes for the Pumas 7s, who went from being forward on the scoreboard to being down (7-10) and with one much less participant.\nÁlvarez and Schulz, pure defenseSantiago Filipuzzi/Particular Envoy\nWithin the second half, Argentina continued to be out of focus. Marcos Moneta was unable to comprise Roache, who, with sheer energy and some tumbles, managed to attain a attempt, which was reviewed by the referees.\nWith three and a half minutes left, Luciano González as soon as once more gained floor with sheer energy and Osadczuk emerged from the ruck to shut the hole and get to inside a degree because of Pellandini’s effectivity within the conversion (which Australia didn’t have, having missed all three tries).\nMalouf was superfluous on the appropriate wing in a state of affairs of Argentine defensive disarray and scored Australia’s fourth attempt, which Roache transformed this time to make the rating 22-14.\nAustralia completed first with 9 factors, adopted by Argentina with 7 factors. Samoa completed subsequent with 5 factors, after beating Kenya 26-0, and had been left ready to undergo as the very best third-placed staff.\nLuciano González was the protagonist of the play that marked the turning level within the match. It’s recognized that in rugby sevens, a yellow card can change all the pieces: “The referees determined one thing… I feel it was a mistake on my half. I used to be a bit distracted, I used to be a bit hit, I used to be not ready. I’ve to apologize to my staff as a result of The yellow card is a scarcity of respect for them and for the Argentine public. Now, let’s placed on our greatest face, as a result of the quarter-finals are developing quickly.”\nLuciano González, in motion in opposition to AustraliaSantiago Filipuzzi/Particular Envoy\nThe participant who began on the Membership Social de La Rioja commented on the state of affairs that led to his warning shortly earlier than the top of the primary half: “On the time of the play, it was a matter of operating him again or saving the attempt or not. Sadly, the referees took it the improper manner. It wasn’t like that, I by no means imagined or had the intention of committing a yellow card or a penalty.” González referred to the best way his coronary heart was beating at that second: “Adrenaline makes you suppose that they’ll’t rating a attempt. It’s an important match so that you don’t give it some thought. It comes from inside, instinctively. It wasn’t in the hunt for a penalty and positively not in a malicious manner. It was unhealthy luck. Apologies to everybody and now a clear slate.”\nSantiago Gómez Cora, coach of Los Pumas, within the match in opposition to Australia Santiago Filipuzzi/Particular Envoy\nThough coach Santiago Gómez Cora didn’t need to initially seek advice from the refereeing by the British participant Adam Leal, ultimately he did: “Taking part in with one much less participant is rather a lot. Subsequently, the choice to use a yellow card have to be 100% protected, as a result of it modifications the story of the match: we have now skilled this all 12 months within the matches we have now misplaced. Typically they’re infractions, generally not. This is similar referee with whom we misplaced 4 of the six defeats. But when we enhance our aerial play, the referee has no instruments to name in opposition to us.”\nWith out drama, however at all times vital, Gómez Cora commented: “Within the ultimate in Madrid, the pinnacle referee acknowledged to me that this referee was improper. Within the state of affairs with Luciano González there was no sort out and within the final one, the Australian participant didn’t come out. The day I retire I’ll get into arbitration as a result of there’s a lot to appropriate. However now, as a coach, when it comes to the sport, we have now to be extra impeccable in terms of enjoying.”\nConocé The Belief Undertaking",

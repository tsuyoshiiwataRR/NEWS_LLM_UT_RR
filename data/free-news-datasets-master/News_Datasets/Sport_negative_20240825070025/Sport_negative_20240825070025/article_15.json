    "text": "Ireland's hopes of a first Olympic medal in rugby sevens are over following a 19-15 defeat to Fiji in the quarter-finals at the Stade de France.\nJames Topping's side had led the back-to-back gold medallists by 15-7 in the second half but would let slip their second two-score advantage of the day after an earlier pool-stage defeat to New Zealand.\nIn what was Ireland's first quarter-final at this level, Fiji had the game's first score within the first minute of the contest.\nIosefo Baleiwairiki fended off the tackle of Niall Comerford to make the key break and finished off the try despite a spirited chase from Chay Mullins.\nIt was Mullins who would drag Ireland back into the game, scoring a double before half-time to put his side ahead at the break despite both tries going unconverted.\nHis second felt especially timely, coming just before the interval and from an attack where Ireland had looked to be drifting towards the touchline before Mullins took on Gavin Mullin's pass and burst through the tackle to score.\nIn the second half, Zac Ward, who has been in excellent form in Paris, put Ireland eight points ahead with an opportunistic finish down the blindside of a ruck after his own strong carry had advanced his side to within a metre of the whitewash.\nImage source, Inpho Image caption, Zac Ward's score had put Ireland eight points ahead\nBut the same missed tackles that plagued Ireland against New Zealand earlier on Thursday started to creep back into their game and Selestino Ravutaumada shrugged off defenders too easily before sending Waisea Nacuqu over for the try to bring Fiji back into things.\nWhen Ireland made a mess of the restart, after 15s star Hugo Keenan was caught underneath the high ball, Terio Tamani capitalised for what proved to be the winning score.\nFijian indiscipline would allow Ireland a last opportunity to snatch victory but, into the fourth minute of added time, a knock-on would end their challenge and medal ambitions.\nRelated Topics Irish Rugby Rugby Sevens Paris 2024 Olympics",

    "text": "MLB fans stunned as Oakland Athletics star Mason Miller suffers bizarre injury while preparing to do an exercise\nMLB rookie pitcher Mason Miller suffered an injury unusually - and fans have been left shocked.\nThe\nOakland Athletics star reliever, 25, was placed on the 15-day injured list with a broken left pinky on Thursday.\nThe A's website revealed that Miller's non-throwing finger injury occurred on Monday.\nAs for the reason, the team shared that the flame-throwing 25-year-old put his hand down \"awkwardly\" on a trainer's table while he was preparing to do an exercise following Monday's win against the\nHouston Astros.\nDuring the game, Miller was electric, throwing just 11 pitches and retired all three batters.\nHis fastball averaged 101.4 miles per hour in the outing.\nRead More on MLB\nMLB fans were left without words by Miller's peculiar injury on X.\n\"Hate it for the guy,\" one commented.\n\"This is brutal. Get well soon Mason,\" a second wrote.\n\"Mason Miller did what?\" a third asked.\nMost read in Baseball\nMiller has been sensational this season, posting a 2.21 ERA and striking out 70 batters in 40 2/3 innings.\nHe is 15 for 17 in save opportunities.\nMiller's lack of saves is largely due to the fact Oakland has a disappointing 41-63 record.\nHe made the All-Star team in his rookie campaign and threw a pitcher with 103.6 mph in the game which broke a record.\nThe 25-year-old Miller has been a trade deadline candidate leading up to the July 30 deadline.\nHowever, the A's have reportedly asked for a huge return.\nMiller has five years before he hits free agency.\nIt doesn't seem likely that he will be traded but it won't be because of his pinky injury on his non-throwing hand.\nRead More on The US Sun\nMiller's injury won't be season-ending.\nBut throwing an injury into the mix makes it difficult for Oakland to receive the highest value for the rookie.",

    "text": "Fans have slammed Mary Fowler following her disappointing performance in the Matildas’ 3-0 loss to Germany in their opening match at the Paris Olympics.\nCaptain Steph Catley admitted the team received a ‘noisy wake-up alarm’ during their opening match in Marseille as their chances of winning gold took a huge hit.\nThe Matildas, semi-finalists in the World Cup, struggled to find their rhythm against the former champions, leaving them on the back foot in a group that also includes the powerful US side as coach Tony Gustavsson made a grovelling apology for the performance.\nFans were quick to criticise Fowler’s performance, labelling her play ‘slow’ and ‘frustrating’.\nOne fan said, ‘Mary Fowler is such a frustrating player. Like many creatively brilliant players before her, she just blows so hot and cold.’\nAnother added on Facebook, ‘Fowler slower than an old barge going up the river, half the pace of anyone else on the pitch.’\nMany fans felt the Manchester City star was almost invisible during the match.\n‘Can Mary Fowler like touch the ball or something … I honestly didn’t even know she was on the pitch,’ one fan fumed.\nFowler was thrust into the hot seat after captain Sam Kerr suffered an ACL injury that ruled her out of the World Cup – and she struggled to make an impact against Germany\nAnother commented, ‘Poor first half. As usual, overrated Mary Fowler nowhere to be found.’\nEven when Fowler had a rare opportunity in front of the net, she was dispossessed before she could take a shot.\nThe criticism extended beyond Fowler to the entire team, with some fans calling the Matildas ‘overhyped’.\nOne fan stated, ‘All the hype they were getting from everyone everywhere was just setting them up for a fall.’\nAnother fan added, ‘Seriously they far exceeded expectations in the World Cup, I get the hype and excitement but they were never going to be a serious contender.’\nAfter a giant-slaying run at the World Cup on home soil, the Matildas were handed a reality check by Germany at the Paris Olympics\nDiehard Matildas supporters travelled to France while others got up at 3am AEST to watch\nThere was also skepticism about beating Germany, with one viewer noting,\n‘There should have been no expectation that this team would have beaten Germany. None. And that’s not a knock on them. Germany is better than we are.’\nSome comments were more abrasive, with fans calling out the Matildas’ perceived arrogance.\n‘Maybe that will bring their cockiness down,’ one said.\nOthers mocked the decision by the Queensland Government to erect a statue of the Matildas after their historic fourth-placed finish at the World Cup.\n‘Rumour has it, there is a statue being built to commemorate this,’ one viewer posted sarcastically.\nAnother posted, ‘The statue would have defended better.’\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nHowever, not all feedback was negative. Several Aussie sport fans defended the team and slammed commenters for turning on them so quickly.\n‘I get some people’s mood around politics here, however, laughing at an Australian sporting side losing says a lot about people’s priorities. Fairly garbage attitude to be frank,’ one supporter posted.\nAnother added, ‘Good to see all the support for them, not. Surely you’re not all so pathetic that you only support winning teams, good old Aussie sportsmanship.’\n‘All the funny men here should meet up and tell that statue joke to each other,’ posted another.\nThe Matildas have a chance to redeem themselves when they face Zambia on Monday morning (3am AEST).\nThey then play their final pool game against the USA on Thursday.\n***\nRead more at DailyMail.co.uk",

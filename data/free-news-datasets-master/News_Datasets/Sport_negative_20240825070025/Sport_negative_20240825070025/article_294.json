    "text": "By Scout Springgate ,\n1 hour ago\nWhile at the podium for day three of the ACC Football Kickoff event in Charlotte, North Carolina, North Carolina Tar Heels head coach Mack Brown gave a fierce take on how he views the current state of college football.\nBrown has seen the college football landscape drastically change throughout his time as a head coach. He said on the podium that there have been more shifts in the 2020s than any other period of his 40-plus year coaching career.\n“There’s been more changes in my last three years than my first 47,” said Brown on the ACC Network. “Somebody said today, ‘Why don’t you write a book about your first day at Appalachia [Appalachian State] and now the way things have changed?’ I said, ‘Some people have to die first’ – we couldn’t say all the things.”\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels head coach Mack Brown. Ken Ruinard-USA TODAY Sports\nWhen asked about his views on the new NIL and free-moving transfer portal element in the sport, Brown explained those who can quickly adapt to the changes will be the most successful.\n“We’re dealing with things we’ve never dealt with before,” Brown said. “The people that can adjust and make it work are going to be the ones that have the best programs.\"\nBrown continued by stating that the amateurism of the sport is long gone and referred to college football as a miniature version of the NFL.\n“It’s not ideal for any of us,\" he said. \"None of us voted for it, but it’s here. Amateurism is gone. We’re the mini-NFL. So now we’ve got to figure out how to handle it.\"\nIt's often difficult to alter one's self for someone as deep into their career as Brown but he knows that he has little choice to what other programs are achieving by embracing the changes to the sport.\n“Instead of griping about it, they’re going to win most games,” said Brown. “That’s just what you do as the structure of college football changes and moves forward.”\nBrown enters the sixth year of his second stint as Tar Heels' head coach when North Carolina opens its 2024 campaign on Aug. 29 from Minneapolis' Huntington Bank Stadium against the Minnesota Golden Gophers at 8:00 pm (ET) on Fox.\nRelated: Dabo Swinney Makes His Perception On Transfer Portal Crystal Clear\nRelated: College Football Fans Have Unanimous Reaction To Banner At ACC Football Kickoff\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

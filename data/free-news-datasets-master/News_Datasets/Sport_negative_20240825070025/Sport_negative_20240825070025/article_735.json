    "text": "THE head coach of Canada's women's Olympic soccer team has been removed from her role amidst an alleged drone spying scandal. The announcement regarding head coach Bev Priestman was made by The Canadian Olympic Committee on Thursday. In a statement , the Committee revealed that Priestman's removal was down \"to her suspension by Canada Soccer.\" The team will now be led by assistant coach, Andy Spence, who led them during their 2-1 win against New Zealand . \"Over the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,\" said Canada Soccer CEO & General Secretary Kevin Blue in a statement. \"In light of these new revelations, Canada Soccer has made the decision to suspend Women's National Team Head Coach, Bev Priestman for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, and until the completion of our recently announced independent external review.\" Read More on the Olympics This marks the latest chapter in a dramatic week for Canada, which all began when New Zealand claimed that a drone had been spotted flying over their training facility on Monday, as per the BBC . The drone was also spotted by police, who arrested Joseph Lombardi, an \"unaccredited analyst,\" and also interviewed Jasmine Mander, who worked as an assistant to Priestman. Having already reportedly admitted to spying, Lombardi later pled guilty to \"maintaining an unmanned aircraft over a prohibited area.\" He was handed a â‚¬45,000 [roughly $49,000] fine and a suspended eight-month sentence. Most read in Olympics Mander denied any knowledge of the incident. Both Lombardi and Mander were sent home. Meanwhile, Fifa began an investigation into the allegations. On Wednesday, Priestman released an apologetic statement, via the Committee . \"On behalf of our entire team, I first and foremost want to apologize to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada,\" she said. \"This does not represent the values that our team stands for.

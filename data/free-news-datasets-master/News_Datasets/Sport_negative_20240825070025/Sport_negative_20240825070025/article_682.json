    "text": "Kirk Ferentz reveals how Kaleb Brown has reacted to DWI arrest, one-game suspension On June 24, [Iowa](https://www.on3.com/teams/iowa-hawkeyes/) wide receiver [Kaleb Brown](https://www.on3.com/db/kaleb-brown-70676/) was arrested and charged with possession of fictitious identification and operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. He will serve a one-game suspension. At the 2024 Big Ten Media Days, Iowa head coach [Kirk Ferentz](https://www.on3.com/db/coach/kirk-ferentz-133253/) revealed how Brown has been since his arrest. “He’s been good,” Ferentz said. “My message to him has been very simply that what’s happened, happened. It’s unfortunate and we’ve had other guys through the years go through the same thing, but all that matters right now is how he responds, how he defines it and how he wants to answer it. “It’s like a team losing a game. You can’t go back and change yesterday, so what are we gonna do moving forward? So far so good,” Ferentz continued. “Just worry about having a good August and then we’ll take it from there. It’s over unless there’s a reason to bring it back up. I don’t anticipate that.” According to police, Brown was near his home just before 2:30 a.m. on the night of his arrest. There was [reportedly](https://www.1630kcjj.com/2024/06/24/iowa-city-man-charged-with-owi-after-damaging-vehicle/) heavy damage to the front of his car. He allegedly backed his car into a person’s law and begin to spin his tires before being stopped. Police claimed Brown had “bloodshot watery eyes, slurred speech, poor balance” and alcohol odor on his body. At the time of the crime, Brown was only 20 years old. After refusing to partake in a sobriety test, the police found a fake ID on Brown’s person. Brown transferred to Iowa ahead of the 2023 campaign. In his debut season with the Hawkeyes, Brown made 11 appearances and four starts. He tallied 22 receptions for 215 yards and one touchdown. For his efforts, he earned the Next Man In Award. Brown began his collegiate career at [Ohio State](https://www.on3.com/teams/ohio-state-buckeyes/), where he only played one season. He saw limited action for the Buckeyes, making just four appearances and recording one catch for five yards. Kaleb Brown played high school football at Chicago (IL) St. Rita, where he was a four-star prospect. He was the No. 107 overall recruit in the [2022 cycle](https://www.on3.com/db/rankings/industry-player/football/2022/), according to the [On3 Industry Rankings](https://www.on3.com/db/rankings/industry-player/football/2022/), a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. Brown will look to take a leap forward this season under new offensive coordinator Tim Lester, who spent last season as a senior analyst for the Green Bay Packers. Iowa will kick off its 2024 campaign in a matchup against [Illinois State](https://www.on3.com/college/illinois-state-redbirds/) on Aug. 31.",

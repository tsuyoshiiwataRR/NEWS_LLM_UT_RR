    "text": "2024 PARIS SUMMER OLYMPIC GAMES Pool Swimming: July 27 – August 4, 2024 Open Water Swimming: August 8 – 9, 2024 La Défense Arena — Paris, France LCM (50 meters) Meet Central Full Schedule SwimSwam Preview Index Entry Lists One of the top stories regarding the Chinese swimming team heading into Paris is the fact that 11 of the 23 who tested positive for banned substance trimetazidine (TMZ) ahead of the 2020 Olympics are among the lineup for these Games.\nAlthough the nation’s roster of 31 athletes has already been drug tested almost 200 times in total after just its first 10 days in Paris, Chinese swimmers may not receive an overwhelmingly cheerful response upon earning a medal.\nFor instance, reigning 200m breaststroke Olympic champion Zac Stubblety-Cook told Reuters this week that he may consider a podium protest or other display of disapproval should current world record holder Qin Haiyang of China earn a medal.\n“Personally I think I will make a decision [about a protest of some kind] probably on the day.\n“Racing someone that was one of those athletes and finding out he was one of those athletes was disappointing.\n“I think it’s less about what country they came from and more about the system and how the system ultimately feels like it’s failed. And that’s the truth.”\nAs we reported earlier this year, the International Olympic Committee’s ( IOC ) Rule 50 , which governs athlete expression, maintains for Paris that athletes are still not allowed to make signs of protest or expression during official ceremonies like medal ceremonies.\nZSC acknowledged this fact, stating, “Everyone probably is aware of rule 50 here and the repercussions that happen with that.”\nIt was at the 2019 World Championships where now-retired Aussie medalist Mack Horton protested gold medalist Sun Yang ‘s (CHN) presence by abstaining from podium celebrations, standing behind the platform on the floor during the Chinese national anthem.\nHorton and the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) received warning letters from World Aquatics (then FINA) for the demonstration.\nAnother Olympic champion breaststroker, Adam Peaty of Great Britain, has also commented on the current state of Chinese doping case affairs. He said this week, “If it’s not fair then it takes the enjoyment out for me.\n“I think if other countries aren’t living up to that standard [high standard that British athletes are], then it’s a real shame that brings a real dark cloud over what the Olympics is meant to stand for.” (Reuters)",

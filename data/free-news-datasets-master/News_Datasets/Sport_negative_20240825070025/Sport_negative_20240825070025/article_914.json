Kilty Cleary | 0 Minutes Ago\nLily Smith/The Register / USA TODAY In this story: Philadelphia Eagles\nIn the world of professional sports, rookies often have to prove themselves both on and off the field.\nFor Philadelphia Eagles rookie Cooper DeJean, his off-field initiation came in the form of a karaoke performance at the team's talent show. And let's just say, his rendition was memorable for all the wrong reasons.\nDeJean decided to serenade his new teammates with his rendition of \"Lose Yourself\" by Eminem, the only problem? He barely got through the first verse before players started booing, laughing, and even throwing objects his way.\nCooper DeJean performed â€œLose Yourselfâ€� by Eminem for the #Eagles Rookie Talent Show and got booed off stage / things thrown at him by the team ğŸ˜ğŸ˜ğŸ˜ pic.twitter.com/JGw7CYX7W1\nâ€” Eagles Nation (@PHLEaglesNation) July 25, 2024 In good fun, some of the Eagles shouted \"Keep going, man!\" but at that point, Cooper knew it was time to pack it up and leave the stage before it got out of hand.\nAs if the karaoke disaster wasn't enough, DeJean will now have some time to reflect on his talent show \"L\" while recovering from a hamstring injury, which looks to be at least three weeks.\nAnd while we hope he gets well soon, that won't keep him from his rookie duties, handing out Ritaâ€™s water ice for the vets after training camp practice.\nEagles rookies like draft picks Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean doing their rookie duties getting the Ritaâ€™s water rice for the vets after their first training camp practice. pic.twitter.com/wUEvGEkRSx\nâ€” John Clark (@JClarkNBCS) July 25, 2024 Hey Rook, next time choose a song that's more your speed, or better yet, leave the singing to the pros and stay locking down receivers.\nâ€” Â Enjoy free dish of rich and fabulous players with The Athlete Lifestyle on SI Â â€”\nSummer lovinâ€™:Â Photos: Livvy Dunne dresses down in black for Skeneâ€™s dominant loss\nPeace offering:Â Kendrick Lamar diss-track star Demar DeRozan defends Drake\n2H2H:Â Angel Reese owns London in two killer dresses: Steph, Durant upstaged\n2H2Hx2:Â Bonjour Barbie: Angel Reese rocks French-inspired fit ahead of Olympics\nMystery date:Â Hilarious Shane Gillis, â€˜Average SEC coupleâ€™ tweet melts social media",

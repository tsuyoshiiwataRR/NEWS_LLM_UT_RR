    "text": "Beside the stairs connecting the dugout and clubhouse in T-Mobile Park, there’s an increasingly cruel reminder of the Mariners’ recent success. More specifically, there’s an instantly iconic photo of catcher Cal Raleigh — arm extended, bat aloft, eyes fixed on a baseball disappearing into a crowd of 44,754 fans who endured a 21-year drought to see that day.\nSince that photo was taken on Sept. 30, 2022 — since Raleigh’s solo homer sealed a 2-1 win over Oakland, cementing Seattle’s first playoff appearance since 2001 — 662 days have passed.\nIt feels like a whole lot more.\nBecause, in the 662 days since, the Mariners have failed to maintain that momentum — falling two games shy of a division title in 2023, before attempting to retool by adding veteran position players to a scintillating starting staff.\nRecently, the results have been hard to watch (\nand increasingly easy to boo), as a dramatically one-dimensional roster lost a 10-game lead in the AL West. That includes eight losses in their last nine games and a 2-1 defeat to the otherwise anemic Angels Wednesday to secure their first sweep of the season.\nOh, and above that photo sitting beside the stairs? Three increasingly ironic words beckon in neon blue:\nGOOD VIBES ONLY\nOn Wednesday, the vibes inside T-Mobile Park were understandably ominous. After updating the media on injuries to centerfielder Julio Rodriguez, shortstop J.P. Crawford and top prospect Felnin Celesten prior to the game, general manager Justin Hollander concluded: “I’ve had better weeks.”\nThen the Mariners made a bad week worse — as reliever\nGregory Santos sustained a knee injury while allowing the tying run in a frustratingly familiar loss. After left fielder Luke Raley flew out to end the game, a crowd of 39,953 rained boos like hot dogs falling from heaven.\nThe vibes?\nThey could be better.\n“You’ve got to realize that at the end of the day, this is a game. We have to enjoy what we’re doing,” said Raleigh, who went 1 for 4 in defeat. “If you’re not enjoying playing baseball, you need to probably get out. I understand, though. Guys are frustrated because they don’t have the numbers; we’re not performing as well and it’s hard to have fun.\n“It’s kind of like the chicken or the egg. Which comes first: do you have fun before you start winning, or do you have to win to start having fun? That’s kind of where I see the group at right now.”\nHere’s where the group is at, in more technical terms. At 53-51, the Mariners somehow trail the Astros by just a single game in an abysmal AL West. After dropping nine of their last 10 series, they travel for a three-game set this weekend against the historically horrible White Sox (27-77), before more significant tests against Boston (54-47) and Philadelphia (64-38). They have the seventh-easiest schedule (based on opponent winning percentage) the rest of the way, while Houston sits at 18th.\nThanks to an exemplary starting staff and a dreadful division, the flawed and flailing Mariners remain in the hunt.\nThey’re buyers, believe it or not.\nFor those in the “not” camp: your pessimism is well placed. This is a front office, after all, that added Jorge Polanco, Mitch Haniger, Mitch Garver and Luis Urias in the offseason to solidify a sputtering offense.\nAnd, well …\nPolanco: .200/.285/.298, -0.3 WAR\nHaniger: .207/.287/.342, -0.6 WAR\nGarver: .168/.285/.343, -0.1 WAR\nUrias: .152/.264/.316, -0.1 WAR\nHollander and president of baseball operations Jerry Dipoto essentially struck out, much like the Mariners.\nBut for those in the “believe” camp? Meet Scott Servais. Minutes after Wednesday’s 2-1 loss, the Mariners’ manager — who, two games earlier, called the team’s effort “inexcusable” — was a fountain of defiant faith.\n“I do believe we will get this going. It’s just a struggle right now.”\nAnd …\n“We will [get the ship righted]. I truly believe that.”\nAnd …\n“It will turn. It can be a cruel game, and it’s a beautiful game. You’ve got to kind of grind your way through it, and we will.”\nPerhaps Servais was trying to convince himself, as much as anyone. Or maybe it was a plea for Dipoto and Hollander to translate similar belief into bats and bullpen help.\n“We’ll see what happens,” Servais said of the trade deadline, which finally arrives Tuesday. “That’s not really my department. My department is trying to get the most out of the group we have here, and I have to do better, quite frankly.”\nSo, yes: the Mariners still have ample time to make a playoff push. And yes, they’re a sweep of the immensely sweep-able White Sox away from conceivably reclaiming a division lead. And yes, much of the core that watched Raleigh dramatically end the drought remains on the roster 662 days later.\nBut the vibes inside T-Mobile Park may also be beyond salvaging, as a starting staff’s collective prime yields repeated 2-1 defeats. As the realization dawns that a bat or two at the deadline might not cure a two-month (or year, or decade) malady. As Raleigh’s photo — the supposed opening of a winning window — feels increasingly far away.\nAs setbacks mount, and injuries multiply, it’s increasingly difficult to believe.",

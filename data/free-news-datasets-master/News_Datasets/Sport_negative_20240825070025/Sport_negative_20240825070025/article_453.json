    "text": "Katrina Gorry was on the losing side as Australia began the 2024 Paris Olympic Games with a disappointing 3-0 defeat to Germany. The midfielder made her return to Olympics action after an eight-year absence, with her last performance in the competition coming in a defeat to Brazil at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro. The Matildas are competing in Group B at the Games alongside Germany, the United States and Zambia, and would have been hoping to pick up points in their opening fixture and make a solid start in a competitive group. However, things got off to a bad start when veteran Marina Hegering opened the scoring 25 minutes into a game in which the Australians struggled for control. Gorry is continuing her return to action after missing the final two months of the 2023/24 Barclays Women’s Super League season due to injury, and was withdrawn just before the hour mark. Germany extended their lead on 64 minutes when Lea Schüller fired home, before Jule Brand added a third four minutes later to inflict a heavy defeat on Australia in their opening fixture. In the earlier match of the day, Riko Ueki was an unused substitute as Japan were narrowly beaten by Spain in their opening game in Group C. Things started well for Nadeshiko at Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes, with Aoba Fujino netting a superbly taken free-kick after only 13 minutes, but Spain rallied, and drew level thanks to a goal from Aitana Bonmatí before half-time. Mariona Caldentey would net the eventual winner for Spain 15 minutes from time, leaving Japan with work to do in their hopes of qualifying for the knockout stage. Both sides are in action again on Sunday 28 July, with Japan facing Brazil and Australia facing Zambia.

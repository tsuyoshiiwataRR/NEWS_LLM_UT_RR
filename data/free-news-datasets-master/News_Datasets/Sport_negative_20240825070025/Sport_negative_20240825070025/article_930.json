    "text": "The driver from East Grand Forks lost his mother, Julie, to cancer this spring. GRAND FORKS â€” Last summer, Tucker Pederson traveled the region, chasing a national points title in street stocks. But he wasn't by himself. His mother, Julie, made sure to be with him, even though she was battling metastatic breast cancer. \"Things were hard for her,\" Tucker said. \"But she still made it a point to come to every race, even if she was driving five or six hours. She didn't care. She said she was coming. She was big on keeping racing a family thing.\" It has been for the Pedersons. ADVERTISEMENT Julie was a pioneering driver, one of the first females to compete at River Cities Speedway. She drove the No. 93 super stock in the 1990s. Her husband, Joey, is one of the region's top late model drivers. Both of her children, Tucker and Kelsi, jumped into racing at young ages, too. Last year, Joey, Tucker and Kelsi all competed in different classes. \"It's hard when you get split up,\" Tucker said. \"My dad would be racing in Grand Forks and I'd be in Aberdeen. But my mom made an effort to make sure nobody was alone.\" Julie's health declined over the winter. On April 14, she died at age 49. \"This entire year has been very different without her,\" Tucker said. Memories of Julie are ever-present. Kelsi is driving the No. 93 lightning sprint car, using the same number as her mother. Tucker, meanwhile, decided to make the jump to late models and race with his dad. ADVERTISEMENT Tucker's late model is filled with tributes to his mom. The dominant color is pink. The side is lined with her pictures. \"I wanted to show support for her,\" said Tucker, who enlisted Fargo's Cole Babcock to help with the design. A new class Prior to this spring, Tucker had only completed two laps in a late model. But he and 10 other drivers scheduled a spring practice session at Devils Lake Speedway, where he drove about 80 laps. \"My first impressions were. . . that I was very skeptical (of driving a late model), because I was struggling a lot,\" Tucker said. \"I had gotten to the point in the street stock where I was comfortable wherever we raced it. But I struggled a lot with the late model in the beginning. \"The cars are faster. They're much more aggressive in terms of the g-forces you experience going through the corners. It was so much more aggressive than what I thought. My dad had warned me. After my first time out there, my arms felt like puddles.\" Tucker stuck with it. ADVERTISEMENT His first race came on May 10th at River Cities Speedway. It was an emotional night as the track paid tribute to Julie. Drivers gathered on Turn 2 as Joey, Tucker and Kelsi made laps. \"That was really cool,\" Tucker said. Tucker finished 12th in his first late model feature. He quickly improved. About a month later, on June 15, he won his first late model feature in Devils Lake. \"With that being my first win since my mom passed, it was an emotional one,\" Tucker said. \"Any and all feelings you can have hit at once. It was really exciting, but it was hard, too. I had to let it sink in afterwards. It was bittersweet. Everything circles in your mind. \"As much as it's exciting and new, you're reminiscing about the old.\" Tucker has gone on to have a strong summer. ADVERTISEMENT He's grabbed four top-five finishes and seven top-10s. \"Every night is a new learning curve,\" he said. Tucker plans to be back at River Cities Speedway at 7 p.m. Friday for Big Motor Mania. The show will include sprints, late models, A-Modifieds and non-wing sprints. The A-Modifieds will hold double features. It will be the first appearance at The Bullring for the late models since July 12. Tucker will look to run another memorable race. He'll have loved ones on his mind and tributes to them on his car. \"I have photos of my mom all over the side of my car,\" Tucker said. \"I have a tribute to my grandpa and great grandma, who passed away. I have a sticker for Bruce Hart. He was a big supporter of mine who passed away. \"The whole racing community has lost so much this year. It feels like everything is bittersweet. You have your high moments, but it's hard not to reminisce.\" ADVERTISEMENT Big Motor Mania When: 7 p.m. Friday (hot laps 6:30). Where: River Cities Speedway. Classes: Sprints, late models, A-Modifieds and non-wing sprints. Of note: There will be double modifieds features. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT",

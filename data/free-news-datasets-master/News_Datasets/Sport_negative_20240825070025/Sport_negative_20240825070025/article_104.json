    "text": "While Parramatta are poised in pain and wooden spoon contention, Jason Ryles has a one-time ticket to swing the axe without question.\nFirst and foremost, Ryles must make his presence known. Brad Arthur was well-liked for his personal relationship with all the players – but the Melbourne assistant has plenty of time to make friends. The best coaches have a knack for balancing both – demanding respect and understanding boundaries.\nIt was the undoing of Jason Demetriou. The sacked Rabbitohs coach was slammed for failing to get a grip over his playing group.\nSay what you like about the imposing personalities of Latrell Mitchell and Cody Walker, but they are professionals at the end of the day.\nThey have been around the block enough to know a coach is a person you listen to.\nJason Ryles with the Wallabies during the Rugby World Cup France 2023. (Photo by Chris Hyde/Getty Images)\nBeing buddies with the players doesn’t save your job. It may delay the inevitable, but powerhouses like Craig Bellamy, Trent Robinson, Wayne Bennett and Ivan Cleary – you can see it in the post match press conferences. They have an unmatched aura.\nEver since the 2022 Grand Final, the Eels have been swirling around in nothingness. Broncos coach Kevin Walters is doing everything in his power to stop the same curse – missing the finals the immediate season after a big dance appearance. It is the epitome of a momentum killer. Not only for the fans, but the playing group.\nClint Gutherson was the man behind Parramatta’s 2022 season. He is an effort player no doubt. His attitude for the past few seasons has been questionable. Many have raised concerns over his position as captain. Round 18 illustrated his volatility. Towards the closing stages of the Rabbitohs matchup, the No.1 pushed on the blame of his mistake.\nStarting the play at marker, Gutherson raced to follow the path of the ball and bolted to the corner in cover defence – but he forgot one thing. Trust. Jack Wighton summed up the situation perfectly, stepping back inside to the gaping hole Gutherson left.\nIf the fullback trusted his outside backs and remained in the line, Wighton would not have been presented a chance. Rookie Matt Arthur was subsequently monitoring a space for two to three men, and was crossed by the Bunny, making him look foolish.\nIt was his second game and the dummy half was rinsed by his captain. It was Gutherson’s error, yet after the try, his arms were out, mouth open and eyes darted at young Arthur. Yes, rookie players must earn their stripes – but it was a bad look.\nMore League New Zealand Warriors vs Wests Tigers: NRL live scores Round 21 Team Lists Late Mail: Crichton ruled out, Storm make early call on Munster, Tigers and Sharks name teens NRL News: NRL chase Super Bowl legend for Vegas, Paseka signs 'life' deal at Manly, Taumalolo makes Cowboys history Ryles' seven-week sweep-out: New Eels coach must make moves, not friends, in pressure-free period Why wingers are no longer just speed merchants but an important cog in rugby league machine League Arthur has now been granted the right to negotiate with other NRL clubs and wants out. While it has been reported he was upset with his father’s dismissal, it would not be remiss to suggest an unease with the culture.\nThe injury to Mitchell Moses is a real dud. With no chance of making finals, the remaining rounds give Ryles full creative license. As Moses is the future of the club and their key stakeholder to success – the new coach now must will the Eels through a tough final period.\nMoving Gutherson at captain is one option, but the club isn’t blessed with leaders. Reagan Campbell-Gillard and Junior Paulo are past their use by dates. As is Joe Ofahengaue – even both Ryan Matterson and Bryce Cartwright are 29.\nMatterson and winger Maika Sivo have already been told they can leave if they can find a deal elsewhere. Several more Eels should be given the same message.\nBlaze Talagi is an interesting proposition. While Gutherson has come out stating his compliance with a possible shift to centre – the reality is, the No.1 is a valuable fullback. One that plenty of clubs could benefit from. Playing him in the centres with Will Penisini could provide a new attacking threat – and if it doesn’t work out over the next few rounds, what really is the loss?\nThe same applies for testing out Parramatta’s youth. Jake Tago may not apply as a fresh recruit at the age of 25, but his first signs have been encouraging.\nGiving Ethan Sanders another chance should be at the top of Ryles’ list – but outside of that, the Eels have used most of their 30. The roster needs a big shake up. Dylan Brown and Mitchell Moses could be the most damaging halves pairing in the competition – they are still yet to click. It calls for a forward clean out. They need brutal ball-carriers with a mix of line-running flair.\nNew Zealand Warriors v Wests Tigers 1.04 13.00 NRL : Head To Head Fri, 26 Jul 2024, 18:00 Parramatta Eels v Melbourne Storm 7.50 1.10 NRL : Head To Head Fri, 26 Jul 2024, 20:02 Brisbane Broncos v Canterbury Bulldogs 1.32 3.40 NRL : Head To Head Sat, 27 Jul 2024, 15:00 North Queensland Cowboys v Cronulla Sharks 1.70 2.15 NRL : Head To Head Sat, 27 Jul 2024, 17:30 Sydney Roosters v Manly Sea Eagles 1.38 3.10 NRL : Head To Head Sat, 27 Jul 2024, 19:35 St. George Illawarra Dragons v Penrith Panthers 4.00 1.25 NRL : Head To Head Sun, 28 Jul 2024, 14:00 Dolphins v Gold Coast Titans 1.52 2.55 NRL : Head To Head Sun, 28 Jul 2024, 16:05 Canberra Raiders v South Sydney Rabbitohs 1.62 2.30 NRL : Head To Head Sun, 28 Jul 2024, 18:15 * Odds Correct At Time Of Posting.

Even a jab at Jack De Belin is not a bad idea – his versatility and ball playing skill is a must for their middle. Junior Paulo is not a ball-player. While a strong offloader, he struggles to land back door passes.\nAs the Bulldogs’ bid for Sio Siua Taukieaho has now been rejected, the Eels should try to sign him on a one-year deal. Granted the former Chook is 32, but he provides an aggression that is always welcomed. Jared Waerea-Hargreaves is still a force to be reckoned with at 35.\nBefore the blowtorch zeroes in on Ryles, he has two months to make moves with little repercussion. It’s a luxury every other coach in the NRL is without.",

    "text": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. - Two days of training camp has done nothing to quell the angst over the state of the Patriots offensive line, which was one of the top storylines heading in. Earlier in the week, Jerod Mayo indicated the coaching staff was working to fill out the line with “the best five players.” So they’re on a fact-finding mission, even if that means moving people around. “If that means you’ve got to play guard or play tackle, I don’t know,” Mayo said Tuesday. “We’ll see, it’ll play itself out in camp. That’s my mindset, it’s about putting the best players on the field.” Right now, the best looks like Chuks Okorafor at left tackle, Sidy Sow at left guard, David Andrews at center, Michael Onwenu at right guard, and a right tackle to be named later. Based on the first two days, four of the five positions appeared to be locked in, while there’s uncertainty over the fifth spot at right tackle. On Wednesday, Calvin Anderson had the top run at right tackle, next to Michael Onwenu, who was the presumptive starter at the position but has been moved inside. On Thursday, Vederian Lowe was to the right of Onwenu, not Anderson. And what gives with rookie Caedan Wallace, a right tackle the Patriots were convinced could play left tackle, but hasn’t been there, and appears down the depth chart on the right side? Will he get the nod at right tackle on Friday? Translation: Even with four of the positions seemingly set, it’s anyone’s guess how it will shake out. The Patriots spent a lot of money to keep Onwenu in the fold. In March, they re-signed him to a three-year, $57 million deal with $38 million guaranteed. Essentially, they gave him tackle money. So now, he’s a guard? Onwenu, taken in the sixth round of the 2020 NFL Draft, has bounced around a bit during his four seasons. He appeared mostly at right tackle as a rookie, played both tackle positions in 2021, moved to right guard in 2022 and finished the 2023 season as the team’s starting right tackle. That was the greatest position of need, and given the pains the Patriots took to keep him, appeared to have found his niche. “Wherever the team needs me to play, that’s where I’ll be,” Onwenu said Wednesday, while admitting he was a bit surprised to be moved inside. “As the days go on, I’ll keep practicing at whatever position, and we’ll see where I am.” It’s possible the “best five” involves Onwenu playing guard, because they can’t come up with two guards in that circle of five. He’s arguably the Patriots' best offensive lineman, but the problem is they don’t have quality depth at either right guard or right tackle. Okorafor, meanwhile, told reporters Thursday that the merry-go-round is likely to continue. So who knows what it’ll look like when the dust settles? It could all change once the pads come on Monday and it’s a little easier to judge in a full contact practice. “Our coaches have said every day will be a different line. We don’t really know who is going to be the guy yet,” Okorafor said. “Obviously with Dave [Andrews] and Mike [Onwenu] we know about them but I think apart from that, everything is open.” Okorafor has also done an about face about his move to the left side. During the early camps, the former Steeler talked about the difficulty about moving from right tackle to the left. He voiced some uncertainty about the switch. Now, he’s saying he doesn’t know why everyone is making such a big deal about the move. Even Mayo didn’t sound completely certain Okorafor would be the left tackle. “I would say right now, based on the time he’s been in the league alone, he’s going to start there,” Mayo said. “But again, my mentality and our offensive mentality is to put the five best guys out on the field. We’ll see how it plays out.” As for Anderson, he’s back in the mix after seeing his 2023 season derailed by complications from malaria. He signed a three-year deal as a free agent, and with his health restored, is out to prove his worthiness. “I think my expectation is to come out and show everybody what they didn’t get to see last year,” Anderson said. “Obviously with all the setbacks I had, I had to miss a lot of the year, which was really frustrating. So now I’m healthy. I’m big. I’m strong. I want to show them all what I’m capable of doing.” In this game of musical chairs with the offensive line, stay tuned to who’ll be left sitting.",

    "text": "[Opals veteran](https://7news.com.au/sport/basketball) Rebecca Allen is out of this year’s [Olympics](https://7news.com.au/sport/olympics). With one word, and one ‘broken heart’ emoji, Allen’s pain was there for all to see. “Shattered,” she wrote on X (formerly Twitter), after scans confirmed the extent of her soft-tissue injury. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: [Download today ](https://7news.com.au/app?utm_source=7NEWS&utm_medium=contextual-link-app&utm_campaign=7news-app) The 31-year-old injured her hamstring during the practice match against Canada on Tuesday evening. She was, however, still hopeful of taking some part in Paris, but scans have now confirmed a high-grade hamstring strain. “I have been looking forward to these Games for a long time and am absolutely devastated but I will now focus my energies on recovery and supporting my Opals sisters,” Allen said. Fans were devastated by the sad news. “Just saw the news — so sorry and sending positive thoughts from NY,” one fan said on Instagram. These Olympics were going to be Allen’s second. Amy Atwell has been named as her replacement. Opals coach Sandy Brondello was feeling for Allen. “Bec is such a big part of our team and has been for a long time… This injury has come at a really unfortunate time and the call had to be made upon medical advice,” Brondello said. “Amy Atwell has been part of this Olympic squad all year and with us in Spain for our practice matches. She will now come into the team and all the staff and players have every confidence in Amy.” The Opals first game is on July 29 against Nigeria. Canada and two-time Olympic medallists France are also in their group. While Group B is a tough one, their record on the Olympic stage is strong. The Aussies have won three silver medals and two bronze at the Olympics and will be hoping to add to that tally in Paris. Stream free on",

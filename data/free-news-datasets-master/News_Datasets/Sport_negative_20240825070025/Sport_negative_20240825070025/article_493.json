    "text": "Jerry Jones rambling through a press conference and being nonsensical and borderline unintelligible? It’s clear that it’s probably time for him to step away from his football duties with the Dallas Cowboys… because it’s time for him to run for president. The soon-to-be 82-year-old was speaking with the media today during Dallas Cowboys training camp, and objectively speaking, he didn’t make a whole lot of sense in what he was saying (or trying to say). If you were to ask Jerry Jones how he felt about what he said, he’d likely tell you he nailed it. But watching these videos from his time with the media today… I’d beg to differ. First up, Dallas Cowboys fans are going to hate to see this. Jones once again proclaimed that for this upcoming season, he and the Dallas Cowboys are “all in.” That phrase haunted fans of Dallas last season, and considering that Jones failed to make any splashy moves to acquire free agents this offseason (Ezekiel Elliot is back as their starting running back), I’m not sure that saying “all in” is warranted. But don’t panic, because Jerry Jones explained what he meant by saying “all in:” “I’m all in. I’m all in. Sometimes being all in means you narrow… you remove the months out here that are in the future. And you narrow it down to where all we’re talking about is right now and the next playoff season, and that’s it for everybody. We’re all in. It’s all right there. Let’s, let’s, let’s… okay?” [#Cowboys]owner Jerry Jones again today: \"I'm all in. I'm all in.\" And then he goes on to explain what that means… [pic.twitter.com/PPzZXHHIZy] — Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) [July 25, 2024] Anyone have a Jerry Jones translator handy? You’ll definitely need it for this next quote, which featured Jones pontificating about how he normally waits for a long time to extend his players. In it, he used a metaphor of him being an option quarterback, and compared himself to Patrick Mahomes (a non-Cowboy player who rarely runs the option). For those that might think I’m adding or detracting from this to purposely make him sound senile, I’ll transcribe exactly what he said just like I did above: “We are so involved in trying to see where we are with our situation. That that is a major part of seeing where… seeing the leaves fall. Seeing the time go by. Seeing this day and this week, how they go by. I have, in my life, played option quarterback so many times and wait until the last leaf on the tree. If you want to picture a pure option quarterback going out to the sideline, I have run that ball and kept it, not handed it off to the back, not pitched it back, not thrown it. And I have run that thing all the way out to the sideline before I made the decision. Because I couldn’t make… I couldn’t get whatever it took to, it wasn’t right for me, to make the decision. And so what our fans, what you’re seeing, what we deal with is we’re buying time. We’re option quarterbacking and we’re going on out to the sideline and we haven’t handed it off, haven’t pitched it, we’re trying to make our mind up what to do. Does that sound like Mahomes to you?” [#Cowboys]owner Jerry Jones compared himself to Patrick Mahomes when explaining why it's smart to take your time before extending a player. Jerry said he's like an option quarterback reading the market. This is a doozy. [pic.twitter.com/EM8A1s3aEu] — Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) [July 25, 2024] Sheesh… have fun going “all in” with Jerry Jones for yet another year Dallas Cowboys fans. And Jerry, if you truly are an option quarterback, it sounds like it’s time to hand the ball off… to your successor.",

    "text": "Surf Coast Shire Council will be upgrading Coombes Road, Torquay, with planning now underway. Tenders for the works are being advertised by end of July. The road works will make the road safer for all road users, including drivers, pedestrians and cyclists. The works include: - Coombes Road being widened (with sealed shoulders for cyclists) and resurfaced from Surf Coast Highway to Ghazeepore Road. - Intersection upgrade at Coombes Road and Messmate Road, including the installation of a roundabout. \"We know many locals are eager for these works to happen. I drive Coombes Road regularly so I know what a difference these works will make,\" said Cr Adrian Schonfelder \"As soon as the contractor is appointed, and the works schedule is known, we'll let residents know the timeframes and any temporary traffic impacts,\" he said. Go to [surfcoast.vic.gov.au/CoombesRoadUpgrades](http://www.surfcoast.vic.gov.au/CoombesRoadUpgrades) for updates on the road works. /Public Release.

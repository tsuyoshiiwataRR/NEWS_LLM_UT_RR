    "text": "The Australian sports world was rocked just days into 2024, when it was announced that Sam Kerr, the country's football megastar, had suffered a torn ACL.\nKerr, 30, suffered the knee injury during a training camp in Morocco for her WSL team Chelsea, which will see her miss the remainder of their season.\nAfter missing the majority of the Matildas' home FIFA World Cup in 2023, many fans were excited by the prospects of the world's best striker lifting the team ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics, but these hopes have been extinguished.\nMORE:\nMatildas Olympics group, draw: Who are Australian women's football team playing at 2024 Games in Paris?\nIs Sam Kerr playing in the Paris Olympics 2024?\nKerr has been officially ruled out of the Paris Olympics 2024 by Football Australia and Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson in May.\n\"Unfortunately we have had a very very tough period with injuries,\" Gustavsson said in a press conference on May 21 for the upcoming pre-Olympic clashes against China.\n\"I just got the summary sheet here a week ago and 15 out of these 37 players are either injured or just coming back from injury which means some of the players that are selected now is selected to be evaluated where they are with their physical status in the gym window and see where they will potentially become the Olympics.\n\"I think everyone can do the math here and understand that obviously the Olympic roster will be based mostly out of those that are in camp.\"\nKerr suffered her ACL injury barely a week into 2024, and will likely miss close to nine months.\nThat meant that she would be sidelined for the remainder of the WSL season, and would also not play at the Paris Olympics if the Matildas qualified.\nSome had floated the idea of Kerr being brought into the squad just for penalties, but experts quickly quieted that idea, with former Socceroos' goal-keeper Mark Schwarzer\nimploring Kerr to be 'selfish' and not try and rush back for the Olympics.\nWhen do the Matildas play next?\nThe Matildas next game will be their second at the group stage of the 2024 Olympics, as they look to bounce back from an awful start against Zambia on Monday July 29.\nThey were well off the pace in their opening game in Marseille, and were punished by Germany, who secured a 3-0 win.\nThe match against the African side is now a must win game, given they face the mighty USA in their final group stage match.\nThe game against Zambia will begin at 3:00 a.m. AEST.\nSam Kerr injury update\nWhile Kerr is yet to publicly comment on her injury, she has taken to social media to thank teammate Millie Bright, saying \"Don’t know what I would have done without my Millie B last few days.\"\nHer WSL team Chelsea said that she would be assessed, and then would begin her rehabilitation, per a statement.\n\"Sam will be assessed by a specialist in the coming days and then begin her rehabilitation with the club’s medical team,” the team said.",

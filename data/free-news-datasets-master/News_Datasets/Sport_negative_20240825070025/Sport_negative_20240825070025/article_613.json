And so for me, just appreciating his presence, appreciating everything he shared with me from an on-court and off-court perspective.‚Äù -via NBC Sports Bay Area/ July 20, 2024\nThe Lakers‚Äô inactivity has not been due to a lack of trying. They struck out with Klay Thompson, were unable to land other impact free agents like Jonas Valanƒçi≈´nas and DeMar DeRozan, and have failed thus far to find common ground in trade talks with Portland, Brooklyn, Utah, Toronto and Orlando. Now,\naccording to league and team sources, the Lakers are expected to remain patient in their quest to improve their roster. -via New York Times/ July 17, 2024",

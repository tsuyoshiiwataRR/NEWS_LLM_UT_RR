    "text": "NFL fans are already getting worried about\nJoe Burrow after a worrisome video from Cincinnati Bengals practice yesterday surfaced.\nJoe Burrow missed the Bengals’ final 10 games in 2023 after suffering a wrist injury in a Thursday night game against the\nBaltimore Ravens. Burrow underwent season-ending surgery, and the Bengals missed the postseason after finishing 9-8.\nWell, NFL fans are already growing concerned for Burrow after his pass protection quickly broke down in a drill during yesterday’s training camp session. Here’s a video of the drill, courtesy of WCPO’s Caleb Noe:\nThis one short video clip was enough to start sending NFL fans into panic mode on Joe Burrow’s behalf:\nClick on ‘Follow Us’ and get notified of the most viral NFL stories via Google!\nFollow Us\nAlso Read:\n Bengals QB Joe Burrow Reveals The Most Hilarious Reason For Dying His Hair Bleach Blonde And Going For The Eminem Look\nJoe Burrow has already been sacked 148 times in 52 games, per\nPro Football Reference. This included a league-high 51 sacks taken in the 2021 season to go along with 19 sacks in four playoff games.\n2023 marked the second time in four years where Burrow suffered a season-ending injury. He tore his ACL and MCL during his 2020 rookie season, having taken 32 sacks in just 10 games.\nCincinnati signed veteran offensive tackle Trent Brown and used their first-round pick on Amarius Mims to shore up the o-line depth. But only time will tell if de facto GM Duke Tobin and company did enough to ensure Burrow has adequate pass protection here in 2024.\nBengals Will Contend If Joe Burrow Stays Healthy\nIf Joe Burrow can stay healthy, the Bengals will unquestionably be one of the top players for the Super Bowl this year. In his two healthy seasons, Cincinnati has played in two AFC Championship Games and one Super Bowl.\nBurrow also holds a 3-1 record against Patrick Mahomes and the\nKansas City Chiefs, with all three games being decided by a single score. So if he’s on the field, the Bengals are by far Kansas City’s biggest threat in the AFC.\nAlso Read:\nRUMOR: Two Interesting AFC Teams Planning To Go “All-In” For Bengals Superstar WR Tee Higgins",

    "text": "The Canadian Olympic Committee has removed its women's football team head coach Bev Priestman from the Games following the drone spying scandal involving New Zealand.\nIt has now emerged there may have been drone use against opponents predating the Paris Olympics.\nIn a statement the COC said they have removed Priestman from the Olympic team following her suspension by Canada Soccer and that assistant coach Andy Spence would lead the team for the rest of the Games.\nTwo other members of the coaching team have already been sent home after two incidents of drone use over New Zealand training came to light.\nCanada Soccer chief executive and general secretary Kevin Blue released the following statement:\n“Over the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. In light of these new revelations, Canada Soccer has made the decision to suspend women’s national team head coach, Bev Priestman for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, and until the completion of our recently announced independent external review.”\nCanada beat the Football Ferns this morning 2-1 in the wake of the scandal, which came to light after New Zealand saw a drone hovering during a training session in Saint-Étienne. An earlier incident also came to light.\nAs a result, Joseph Lombardi, an unaccredited analyst with Canada Soccer, has been sent home, as well as Jasmine Mander, an assistant coach.\nLombardi was charged with maintaining an unmanned aircraft over a prohibited area and accepted an eight-month suspended sentence.\nPriestman removed herself from involvement in the New Zealand match, but sporting authorities have gone further as the scandal develops.\nThe NZ Olympic Committee said NZ Football are looking to urgently expedite the matter through the FIFA Disciplinary Committee.\nThe NZ chef de mission Nigel Avery said earlier he was very disappointed, and it had been \"really unsettling\" for the Football Ferns.\nTeam captain Katie Bowen, speaking after today's loss, said there was no ill-will towards Canada's players, but the spying was \"straight up cheating and embarrassing\".",

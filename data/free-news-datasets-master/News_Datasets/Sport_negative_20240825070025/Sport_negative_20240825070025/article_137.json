    "text": "The Sixers had one of the biggest summers out of all the teams. After a first-round exit, the franchise really went through a makeover this offseason. Adding [Paul George](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/paul-george/), Caleb Martin, and Drummond, the Sixers have solidified their squad. Many expect the new big three, Embiid, Maxey, and PG to lead the franchise to a title, however, [Draymond Green](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/draymond-green/https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/paul-george/) believes otherwise. Yes, bringing in a superstar does make a difference, but Green stands on the other side of the fence with this opinion. In a recent episode of the Club 520 Podcast, Green voiced his thoughts on the Sixers offseason and their future. “I think the Sixers has done a good job. I think you know, with the players they added, PG, Caleb Martin, Drummond, I think they had a really good offseason. They had a bunch of cap space and they capitalized on it. I still don’t think they’re gonna beat the Celtics, win a championship. I still don’t think that.”, [said Green](https://youtu.be/ylsfuSlos4c?si=rR9gbeY3qxciRxFB&t=3433). Now, things won’t happen instantly. It will take them a season or two to hopefully become title contenders. The Sixers haven’t gone past the second round ever since their last Finals appearance, back in 2001. After adding [Embiid](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/joel-embiid/), the franchise has exhausted all the options around him. The closest they were to qualifying for the Conference Finals was in 2019 when [Leonard](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/kawhi-leonard/)‘s lucky bounce sent them home. Regardless, they had [Jimmy Butler](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/jimmy-butler/), [James Harden](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/james-harden/), Danny Green, and other assets in the past to help them. Will Paul George be another one of them? This is exactly what Draymond Green would have predicted along with PG’s history. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad George has been the offseason star for the fourth time in the last seven years. His move to the Thunder didn’t work out so well, nor did his stint with the Clippers, even though he had the most consistent season of his career recently. It all comes down to how the Sixers decide to play PG and Embiid. There may be times when George might have to take care of the load along with Maxey. After all, he is an elite scorer, and prioritizing shots that go off of his hands will be something the Sixers will look to take care of. Still, Green’s opinion throws shade at their ability to beat the Celtics. Is Draymond Green right about the Sixers? ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Well, the Celtics are in the middle of building a dynasty. Their recent championship run has been criticized due to the competition they faced in the East. Now, the Sixers fell to the Knicks in the first round this year. Not to mention, each game was within the margin of 6 on average. They were quite close to getting rid of them, but shooting inconsistencies and Maxey doing most of the work got the best out of them. The Sixers needed variation and more reliable assets who could get the job done in the postseason. They already added PG and have introduced Caleb Martin. Now, Martin was a crucial part of the Miami Heat. He was a key player during the postseason and put up great numbers alongside Butler and company. Of course, he can contribute efficiently in the playoffs. Not only that but [Kelly Oubre](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/kelly-oubre-jr/) has also returned, who played a major role in this past postseason. The Sixers have all the pieces they need, but it will take them time to get used to the pace. But can they beat the Celtics? If things play out just well with Embiid, Maxey, and PG, they can definitely top the East. What are your thoughts on the Sixers? Do you think they can beat the Celtics? Let us know in the comments.

    "text": "[Stefon Diggs](https://www.totalprosports.com/tag/stefon-diggs/) has a new football home with the [Houston Texans](https://www.totalprosports.com/nfl/houston-texans/) after being traded from the Buffalo Bills. This week, he got his formal welcome to the team. An all-out fight broke out during Texans practice, including cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. pushing tight end Dalton Schultz to the ground. The incident went down on Wednesday and started with defensive back Jimmie Ward’s hit on wide receiver Stefon Diggs. Now, footage shows just how intense that hit was and why Dalton Schultz was unhappy and came over to defend him initially. The altercation intensified after cornerback Derek Stingley wouldn’t calm down and ran over and pushed tight end Dalton Schultz to the ground as Schultz was walking away.

[Follow Us](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLHdqwswrujDAw) Despite tempers briefly flaring, the Texans’ defense has performed well at training camp, as the above video shows. The Houston Texans shocked everybody with their surprise record in 2023. Now, they have added Stefon Diggs to the mix and are looking like a team that could possibly run the table. Despite the hard hit, Jimmie Ward has had nothing but great things to say about Diggs. “Oh man, it’s going to be pretty cool,” Texans veteran safety Jimmy Ward told [KPRC 2](https://www.click2houston.com/) earlier this year. “He’s a great talent, He came into this league and did what he’s supposed to do, and I feel like DeMeco and Nick did a great job in going to get him and making that trade. And I feel like he’s going to make our team better.” Also Read: [VIDEO: Stefon Diggs Got Caught In The Middle Of A Fight At Houston Texans Training Camp](https://www.totalprosports.com/nfl/video-stefon-diggs-got-caught-in-the-middle-of-a-fight-at-houston-texans-training-camp/) In fact, Stefon Diggs and Ward completed a successful negotiation together when the dynamic wideout acquired his old University of Maryland No. 1 jersey from Ward, who switched back to his old No. 20 jersey from his time with the [San Francisco 49ers](https://www.totalprosports.com/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/), for $100,000. Stefon Diggs Could Be One And Done With The Texans The Houston Texans may have traded for Stefon Diggs, but there is no guarantee he will be in town beyond this season. Houston landed the four-time Pro Bowler in exchange for the Buffalo Bills’ 2025 second-round pick (via the Minnesota Vikings), a 2024 sixth-round pick and a 2025 fifth-round pick. After the trade, the Texans decided to void the final three years of his contract, which was likely a stipulation for the trade to go through. The decision could result in Diggs becoming one-and-done in Houston following the end of the 2024 season.

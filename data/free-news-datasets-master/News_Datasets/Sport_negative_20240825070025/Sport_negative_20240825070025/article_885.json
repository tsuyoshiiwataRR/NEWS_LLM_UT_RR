    "text": "By Phil Harrison ,\n1 day ago\nSome college football programs are judged not by winning a lot of games, but by winning the right games in addition to a lofty winning percentage. Of course, there's the whole Ohio State vs. Michigan thing in the Big Ten, but the other traditional conference power, Penn State, can also be added to that same conversation.\nEver since James Franklin took over the keys to the kingdom in Happy Valley, he's brought the program back to relevance but has yet to really get over the hump aside from one flash-in-the-pan year in 2016. For some reason, most Nittany Lion followers tend to give Franklin a pass even though he himself proclaimed the program isn't elite after a close loss to Ohio State, and has yet to get there since.\nOne guy who's not giving Franklin the benefit of the doubt though is ESPN's Paul Finebaum. While appearing on \"Get Up,\" Finebaum blasted the Penn State head coach for not doing enough since arriving in State College.\n\"... you're a very competent coach, you've done a nice job. You haven't done enough,\" Finebaum said. \"Penn State fans expect excellence, they expect championships. They're getting a little tired of 10-2 seasons that the two biggest games of the year, you blow -- or last year the bowl game. That does not cut it, and for $9, $10 million dollars a year, it's just not enough.\"\nHowever, Finebaum does believe that Franklin has something going for him beginning this year with the expanded College Football Playoff , though that too was less than a ringing endorsement worthy of a Nittany Lion roar over the PA system.\n\"James has got a big break though Greenie (Mike Greenberg),\" continued Finebaum. \"There's now a playoff so he can blow those games as he usually does, and still get to the playoffs and probably get knocked out in the first round.\"\nYou know, sometimes I wish Finebaum wouldn't hold back so much and tell us what he really thinks. Franklin may not be winning the big games, but something tells me his aim would be true if given a dartboard with Finebaum's face as the target.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

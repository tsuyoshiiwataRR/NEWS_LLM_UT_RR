    "text": "PARIS - The Olympic tennis competition suffered another blow as women's third seed Elena Rybakina joined a lengthy list of non-starters hours due to illness just hours after the draw took place at Roland Garros on Thursday. The big-serving 25-year-old Kazakh was down to face Romania's Jaqueline Cristian in the first round of the singles. \"It is difficult for me to announce this, but unfortunately, I will not be able to participate in the Paris Olympics. After Wimbledon, I contracted acute bronchitis, and despite trying to return to training, my body has yet to recover. The doctors have strictly forbidden me from going to court,\" Rybakina posted on Instagram.

With the action to begin on Saturday, the flurry of high-profile withdrawals has cast something of a cloud over the tournament being staged on the Parisian clay. On Wednesday, men's world number one and top seed Jannik Sinner of Italy had to withdraw from the singles and doubles because of illness while exciting Danish youngster Holger Rune also pulled out on Wednesday with a wrist injury.

Switzerland's Belinda Bencic, the champion in Tokyo, is also missing after giving birth to a daughter in April. Two-time Olympic singles champion Andy Murray announced before Thursday's draw that he was not fit enough to compete in the singles but would still play doubles with Dan Evans.

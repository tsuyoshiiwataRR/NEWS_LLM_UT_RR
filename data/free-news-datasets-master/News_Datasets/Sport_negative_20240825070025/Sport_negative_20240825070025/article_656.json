    "text": "The Canadian Olympic Committee has removed head coach Bev Priestman following her suspension by Canada Soccer over a drone spying scandal that thrust the 2020 Olympic gold medallists into an unsavoury global spotlight.\nThe Canadian women's squad will be led by assistant coach Andy Spence for the remainder of the Paris games, the COC said.\n\"Over the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,\" Canada Soccer CEO & General Secretary Kevin Blue said in an emailed statement.\n\"In light of these new revelations, Canada Soccer has made the decision to suspend Women's national team head coach Bev Priestman for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, and until the completion of our recently announced independent external review.\"\nCanada defeated New Zealand 2-1 in their Paris Olympics opening game on Thursday, a match which Priestman voluntarily sat out after the spying scandal broke this week.\nPriestman apologised to the New Zealand players for what had happened and said ultimate responsibility lay with her.\n\"This does not represent the values that our team stands for. I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program.\"\nShare to Facebook\nShare to Twitter\nEmail Us\nCopy the Link",

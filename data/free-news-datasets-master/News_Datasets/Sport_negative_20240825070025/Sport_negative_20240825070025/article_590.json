    "text": "The Los Angeles Dodgers placed utility player Chris Taylor on the 10-day injured list on Thursday because of a left groin strain following results of an MRI, manager Dave Roberts said.\nIn a corresponding move, the Dodgers recalled outfielder James Outman from Triple-A Oklahoma City.\nTaylor, who has appeared in 64 of the Dodgers' 104 games, mostly in left field and at third base, said he felt discomfort in his left groin on his double in the seventh inning of Wednesday's 8-3 home loss to the San Francisco Giants.\n\"Rounding first, I felt it,\" Taylor said Wednesday. \"It kind of grabbed on me.\"\nTaylor, 33, said he never had a groin injury before Wednesday. Roberts said after the game that his concern was \"sort of high.\"\n\"Any time he comes out of the game -- which he doesn't, his pain tolerance is very high -- that's certainly telling,\" Roberts said.\nTaylor is batting .167 with three home runs and 15 RBIs in 162 at-bats. An All-Star selection in 2021, he is a career .249 hitter with 107 homers and 423 RBIs in parts of 11 seasons with the Seattle Mariners (2014-16) and Dodgers (2016-present).\nOutman, 27, will be starting his third stint with the Dodgers this season. He is batting .153 (19-for-124) with three homers and 10 RBIs in 45 games. The third-place vote-getter for the National League Rookie of the Year in 2023, Outman is a career .234 hitter with 27 homers and 83 RBIs in 200 games since making his major league debut in 2022.\n--Field Level Media\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0",

    "text": "Defending champions Canada have beaten the Football Ferns 2-1 in what'll go down as an infamous few days in Olympics history.\nThe clash came just days after New Zealand's opposition was caught spying on them, a drone heard hovering as they went through their set pieces in one of two reported incidents.\nSpeaking to 1News in the mixed zone after the match, captain Katie Bowen expressed her disappointment at the situation, which captured headlines around the world.\n\"It's just such a shock, and my heart goes out to the Canadian team as well cause we know those girls weren't involved and that's just straight up cheating and embarrassing,\" said Bowen.\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee has taken immediate action by dismissing an assistant and an analyst, the latter also handed a suspended jail sentence by French authorities.\nHead coach Bev Preistman stepped aside for the match - and since it finished she has been kicked out of the Games by the Canadian Olympic Committee following her suspension by Canada Soccer.\nMeanwhile New Zealand Football is seeking \"urgent action\" from FIFA.\n\"It's in the hands of the IOC, but it's an interesting precedent to set if they're to get away with this,\" said Bowen.\nNew Zealand's stand-in head coach Michael Mayne says the last 48 hours have been \"challenging\".\n\"It's been tough on the group.. it's hard to not look at it and what may have been.\n\"But I think the team's come out and given a good account of themselves against a good team,\" he said.\nWhether Canada deserves the three points, Mayne said he takes nothing away from Canada's performance.\nNew Zealand opened the scoring through Mackenzie Barry in the 13th minute, before Clo√© Lacasse hit back in first-half injury time.\nEvelyne Viens scored the winner in the 79th minute.\n\"I take nothing away from the game, the game's the game and we lost the game.\n\"The powers at be will look at what's happened and we'll let them do that. My job is to allow us to bounce back against Colombia which is an important game for us,\" he said.",

    "text": "As we all know, Ohio State football’s main rival Michigan ’s former head coach, Jim Harbaugh , was suspended by the NCAA for recruiting violations during the 2023 season.\nOne of those reasons had to do with a hamburger that was bought for a recruit during a dead period. In a potentially coincidental move, the Big Ten on Thursday during its media days served hamburgers to the assembled media.\nIt’s not as if this was what they had been serving every day, as the meals changed over the course of the event. As Tom Orr pointed out, it seems like someone at the Big Ten offices has a “great sense of humor.”\nThey have had different lunches each day at Big Ten Media Days. Today, on the day that Michigan is here, they are serving cheeseburgers.\nSomeone at the Big Ten has a great sense of humor.\n— Tom Orr (@TomOrr4) July 25, 2024\nThis very well could be someone’s jab at the Wolverines, but even if it’s just a coincidence, it’s still pretty funny.\nContact/Follow @BuckeyesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Ohio State news, notes and opinion.

    "text": "By Benedetto Vitale ,\n2 hours ago The Las Vegas Raiders went viral on Thursday after being spotted with a Kermit the Frog doll dressed as Patrick Mahomes. The doll was reportedly brought to training camp by a fan as they recorded seventh-round rookie Trey Taylor playing with the doll.\nMany have already pointed out the obvious that the Raiders have suddenly given Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs some bulletin board material. That is clearly the case now after Patrick Mahomes' trainer, Bobby Stroupe responded to the viral clip with a daunting three-word message . If this is how Mahomes' trainer feels, then we can only imagine how the star quarterback is approaching the video.\n\"We will remember.\"\nThe original video of the Raiders' Kermit Mahomes doll has since been deleted. However, it was on social media long enough for nearly everyone to see and share it. Reports indicate that no players on the team were \"passing around\" the doll as implied. Instead, Raiders fans simply recorded the rookie safety holding the doll.\nOverall this feels like a bad omen for the Raiders. Especially considering Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs have essentially owned Las Vegas for several years now. Mahomes' career record against the Raiders is currently 10-2 and Kansas City have clinched the AFC West eight consecutive seasons in a row.\nWith that in mind the Chiefs are aiming to win its third Super Bowl in three seasons. If they can accomplish that feat, then they'll become the first franchise in NFL history to earn a three-peat. So, it'll be interesting to see if Kansas City can pull it off.\nKansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes (15) signs autographs for fans after training camp at Missouri Western State University. Â© Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports\nThe front office had a solid offseason as they reeled some exciting players to the roster. Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown should be a legitimate deep threat for Patrick Mahomes. Additionally, the Chiefs selected speedster Xavier Worthy in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft. Kansas City's offense will likely remain atop the NFL standings all season long.\nThere's a chance we see Patrick Mahomes have one of the best years of his career next season with all that fire power. Which would be wildly impressive considering he threw for 4,183 passing yards, 27 touchdowns, and a 67.2 completion percentage last year.\nSo, giving Mahomes and the Chiefs some bulletin board material might not be the best decision. But the Raiders seem confident heading into the season. There is plenty of talent in Las Vegas but the quarterback situation could hinder their chances.\nRelated: Rich Eisen Turns Heads Naming NFL's Top 5 Sleeper Teams, Surprise Playoff Prediction\nRelated: Dak Prescott Hints at Cowboys Departure Amid Contract Drama\nRelated: Titans QB Will Levis is Blowing Minds With 'Impressive' Development at Training Camp\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

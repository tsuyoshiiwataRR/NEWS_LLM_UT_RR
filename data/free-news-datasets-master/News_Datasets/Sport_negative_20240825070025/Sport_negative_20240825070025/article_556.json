    "text": "I n a week of baseball marred by fights between fans , one of MLB 's hottest rivalries between the New York Yankees and New York Mets spilled over into a massive brawl caught on film at Yankee Stadium . You can watch the viral video below, but we'd recommend using headphones.\nWatch the viral Yankees vs Mets fan brawl The intense footage, thought to be from after the Mets' 3-2 win on Tuesday night , originated from a now-deleted post on X, formerly Twitter .\nThe brawl added injury to insult for those on the Yankees side of the Subway Series divide. The Mets completed the season sweep of their cross-town rivals on Wednesday night when they finished the two-game set resounding 12-3 win over the Bronx Bombers .\nBitter defeat for New York Yankees Fans of both New York franchises were involved, starting with a pair of female fans wearing Yankees attire tussling with one another in the Yankee Stadium concourse. The melee grew larger when a male fan in a Yankees jersey attempted to push one of the women, which caused a fan in Mets attire to jump in and push him back.\nThe bitter rivals engaged in more back-and-forth pushing and shoving, as the Yankees fan removed his jersey while getting encouraged by the person recording the unsavory video. The bare-chested man landed a right hook to the Mets fan's face, dropping him to the floor.\nA different Yankees fan, wearing a gray Aaron Judge jersey, got involved while the camera panned back to show that the two women from the beginning were still grappling on the ground.\nSecurity did its best to intervene, but the lone officer had a thankless job, while onlookers continued to gas up the shirtless combatant who was eager to flex in front of the camera.\nSimilar scenes broke out earlier in the the week in the Los Angeles Dodgers crowd, setting a troubling trend of MLB fan fights that we hope will not continue.",

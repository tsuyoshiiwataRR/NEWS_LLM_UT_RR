    "text": "West Ham are reportedly considering the FA to court over Lucas Paqueta’s ban The star stands accused of deliberately picking up yellow cards in four matches The club claim it would be ‘unreasonable’ for the player to lose his playing career By James Cohen\nWest Ham are considering taking the FA to court over Lucas Paqueta’s potential lifetime ban from football, according to reports.\nThe Brazilian playmaker, who stands accused of deliberately picking up yellow cards in four Premier League matches against Leicester, Aston Villa, Leeds and Bournemouth, could from football for life if he is found guilty by the FA.\nPaqueta, 26, will be eligible to play for West Ham until the disciplinary process is completed and has denied any wrongdoing in relation to the spot-fixing charges.\nAccording to The Sun, the Hammers are now considering going to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne to prevent the FA hearing the case.\nThe outlet claim the club are ‘questioning the FA’s jurisdiction’ over the matter, given that the suspicious betting linked to Paqueta’s ban took place in Brazil.\nWest Ham are reportedly considering taking the FA to court over Lucas Paqueta’s potential ban\nThe FA charged the West Ham forward with several breaches of their betting rules in May\nFurthermore, West Ham find it would be ‘unreasonable’ for the Brazilian to lose his playing career over the spot-fixing charges.\nMail Sport exclusively broke the story of Paqueta’s betting probe back in August 2023, which led to the collapse of his prospective £85million move to Premier League champions Manchester City.\nThe FA’s sanctioning guidelines state that players found guilty of spot-fixing could face a ban of between six months and life.\nA report from the Sun last month claimed that the FA’s charge sheet contains a recommendation that Paqueta be banned for life if he is found guilty of the breaches.\nPaqueta, denying any wrongdoing, said in a statement on social media in May: ‘I am extremely surprised and upset that the FA has decided to charge me.\n‘For nine months, I have co-operated with every step of their investigation and provided all the information I can.\n‘I deny the charges in their entirety and will fight with every breath to clear my name.’\nHaving been away with Brazil for the Copa America, he is expected to re-join West Ham in the United States next week as they continue their pre-season tour.\nThe club believe it would be unreasonable for the player to lose his career over the charges\nPaqueta expressed surprise at the charges and continues to deny any wrongdoing\nAt the start of the month, West Ham technical director Tim Steidten insisted the uncertainty around Paqueta is not affecting their transfer strategy.\n‘It’s not so difficult, to be honest, because the information we have is quite easy, that he is part of our team and he can play for us,’ Steidten said.\n‘I don’t have so many thoughts on this one, as long as nobody told me or us something else. Of course, we have to react, but at the moment he is part of our team and it’s not really a big issue for us.\n‘He is a member of our family and we are looking forward to seeing him.’\n:\nWest Ham ‘are considering taking the FA to court over potential lifetime ban’ for Lucas Paqueta – as club ‘believe it would be unreasonable’ for Brazilian to lose career over spot-fixing charges\n***\nRead more at DailyMail.co.uk",

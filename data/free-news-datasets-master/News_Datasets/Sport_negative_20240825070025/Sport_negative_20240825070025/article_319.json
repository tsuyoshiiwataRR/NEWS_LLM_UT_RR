    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS -- A Big Ten team stole\nOhio State’s running back coach in the middle of the spring, so Ohio State did the same to another Big Ten team.\nSherrone Moore chose to poach his rival for his first coaching staff at Michigan by brining Tony Alford — who’d been in Columbus for nine years — to Ann Arbor just a week after the Buckeyes had started spring practice. For the second time, Ryan Day was put into a position of having to call an audible nle on his 2024 coaching staff. He’d already done it with his offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach going from Bill O’Brien to longtime mentor Chip Kelly. Now he was without a running back coach.\nLatest Ohio State Buckeyes news\nDillon Gabriel could’ve been Ohio State’s 2024 starting quarterback, here’s why he’s not The 3 most interesting things we saw and heard on the last Big Ten Media Day What Michigan coach Sherrone Moore said about quarterback competitions and more at Big Ten Media Days What Michigan’s Sherrone Moore, Donovan Edwards said about former Ohio State coach Tony Alford\nThe middle of the spring isn’t an ideal time to be hiring staff members so doing so would require him to also take from someone else. That led to him hiring Carlos Locklyn to run a group feature\nTreVeyon Henderson and Quinshon Judkins as the stars at the top, while freshmen James Peoples and Sam Williams-Dixon developed behind them.\nThat left Oregon with the empty hand. But there’s no hard feelings from Lanning.\n“He did a great job for us,” Lanning said. “Worked hard and was certainly about relationships. Grateful for his time he spent with us and excited to see what he does in the future.”\nThe third-year Ducks coach pivoted to Ra’Shaad Samples whom he stole from Arizona State continuing the dominoe caused by the Wolverines of coaches stealing coaches in the middle of the spring. But at least now that dominoes is out of the Big Ten.\nNow the focus shifts towards a season where both stolen coaches will have to return to their former programs for an OSU game. Locklyn returns to Eugene, Oregon, on Oct. 12 for a highly-anticipated matchup between the top two teams in Cleveland.com’s preseason Big Ten Media Poll. Alford returns to Columbus on Nov. 30, for the 2024 version of The Game between the reigning national champion Wolverines and an Ohio State team hopign to put an end to its three-game losing streak.\nIf you or a loved one has questions and needs to talk to a professional about gambling, call the Ohio Problem Gambling Helpline at 1-800-589-9966 or the National Council on Program Gambling Helpline (NCPG) at 1-800-522-4700 or visit\n1800gambler.net for more information. 21+ and present in Ohio.

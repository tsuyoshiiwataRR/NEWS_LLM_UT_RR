    "text": "The lack of an extension for [Dak Prescott](https://www.totalprosports.com/tag/dak-prescott/) is one of the bigger 2024 [NFL](https://www.totalprosports.com/nfl/) offseason storylines up to this point Dak Prescott is heading into the final season of a four-year, $160 million pact he signed with the [Dallas Cowboys](https://www.totalprosports.com/nfl/dallas-cowboys/) in 2021. And with the team’s first preseason game (Aug. 11 vs. the Los Angeles Rams) approaching, the possibility of Prescott playing out the season on his contract year continues to grow. On top of that, superstar wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and annual Defensive Player of the Year candidate and linebacker Micah Parsons need extensions. Lamb is entering the final year of his rookie deal, and Parsons is eligible for an extension after completing three NFL seasons. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Dak Prescott offered some interesting comments that suggest he’s fully prepared for the possibility of leaving the Cowboys next year, per Jett Beachum of CBS News Texas: “Obviously, I want to be here…but at the end of the day, it’s a business… I’m gonna say it:I want to be here, but when you look up — all the great quarterbacks I watched played for other teams…That’s not something to fear. It may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision.” Also Read: [VIDEO: Everyone Is Destroying Dallas Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones For His Strange Explanation Of What “All-In” Means](https://www.totalprosports.com/nfl/video-everyone-is-destroying-dallas-cowboys-owner-jerry-jones-for-his-strange-explanation-of-what-all-in-means/) Click on ‘Follow Us’ and get notified of the most viral NFL stories via Google! [Follow Us](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLHdqwswrujDAw) Cowboys fans who want Dak Prescott here long-term don’t want to hear it, but he’s telling the cold hard truth. Most of the all-time great quarterbacks ( [Tom Brady](https://www.totalprosports.com/tag/tom-brady/), Peyton Manning, Joe Montana, Steve Young, Brett Favre, Kurt Warner, Joe Namath, Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, and so on) played for multiple NFL team. Per [ OvertheCap.com,](https://overthecap.com/player/dak-prescott/4848#:~:text=Prescott%20has%20a%20no%20trade,of%20salary%20into%20a%20bonus.) Prescott also has no-trade and no-tag clauses in his contract. So if he decides on his own to leave Dallas in 2025, there’s nothing Jerry Jones and company can do about it. Last season, Prescott threw for 4,516 yards and 36 touchdowns against only nine interceptions. He finished second in MVP voting behind only Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens. Dallas Cowboys Open Season At Cleveland Browns The Cowboys will try to kick off the 2024 season on a high note when they visit Myles Garrett and the Cleveland Browns on Sept. 5. Not only does this mark a compelling showdown between two 2023 playoff teams, but it’ll serve as Tom Brady’s debut as an analyst for the “NFL on FOX.” Also Read: [PHOTO: NFL Fans Are Loving The Dallas Cowboys’ New Uniforms Design](https://www.totalprosports.com/nfl/photo-nfl-fans-are-loving-the-dallas-cowboys-new-uniforms-design/)",

This represents a mere 0.87% of the total, which is a cause for concern. The number has dropped from the last time, when eight players from the state participated in the Olympics. Of the eight, six were women in the Indian hockey team. This time, the women hockey team could not qualify for the Olympics.112027258 Shooter Aishwary Pratap Singh and hockey player Vivek Sagar from MP would represent the country at the Paris Olympic games.The state significantly lags behind other states, like Haryana and Punjab, in contributing athletes to the national team. With 24 athletes, maximum players are from Haryana. The Haryana govt has been proactive in promoting sports and providing necessary infrastructure and training facilities to its athletes. The success of its sports policies is evident from the fact that it has produced several Olympic medallists in the past, such as Sushil Kumar, Yogeshwar Dutt, and Sakshi Malik. Despite its vast area and sizable population, the low representation of MP in the Olympic contingent raises questions on the stateâ€™s sports infrastructure and training facilities.Sports department officials refused to comment when they were contacted.

    "text": "Former Pakistan Cricket Team captain Shoaib Malik has declared that he has no plans of returning for the Men in Green. Malik claims that he doesn’t intend to make a comeback for his side. Malik has previously retired from ODIs and Test cricket. But he is yet to decide when to call it an end on his T20I career. While he continues to play league cricket, Malik has claimed that his international career is done. Ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup , Malik made himself available for selection in the squad. However, he wasn’t selected as Babar Azam went on to captain his side in USA and West Indies. Minimum Age: 18+ Minimum deposit: ₹500. Wagering requirement: 40x (deposit + bonus) T&C apply No comeback for Pakistan confirms Malik “No, I am happy and satisfied after playing for so many years. I have no interest in playing for Pakistan again. I have already announced retirement from two formats. I have been playing league cricket and enjoying my time. Wherever I get an opportunity to play, I try to make the most of it,” said Shoaib Malik to Cricket Pakistan. The 42 year old is a veteran of the game. While he has retired from the longer formats of the game, he is yet to hang his boots from T20Is. But after having claimed that he has no plans of ever playing for Pakistan, it can be assumed that he will retire from T20Is in sometime. “I have no interest, but as I said in my previous interviews, I will announce my retirement from all forms of cricket once and for all,” Shoaib Malik concluded.",

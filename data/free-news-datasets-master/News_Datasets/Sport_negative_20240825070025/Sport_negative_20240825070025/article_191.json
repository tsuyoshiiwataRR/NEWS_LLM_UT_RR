As he completes his fifth season with Alpine, the Evreux native has put an end to the open secrecy surrounding his future. The French driver, who scored his first F1 victory in Hungary three years ago, has signed a multi-season deal with Haas just weeks after confirming his departure from the team. He had the opportunity to offer a less-than-kind view of working at Alpine. In his eyes, ” There are many things that are not done as they should be done ”. Like any of his former or current teammates, the Norman claims to have “shared a lot of information about the development of the car”, but this is not reflected in the evolution of the equipment provided to him. ” Unfortunately, our feedback is not always translated into concrete action, and sometimes our opinions are not heard as much as they deserve. “, he added. Diagnosing Alpine’s problems, Esteban Ocon assured that despite the many changes in the team’s organizational structure, the problems encountered were not recent.\nO’Connell: “This circle is not complete yet” « We can’t wait years to solve certain problems he promised. The cycle is not over yet, and the problem has not been solved as it should be. , which is frustrating for everyone. » Asked whether Groupe Renault had invested enough in its Formula One team, Esteban Ocon said he was sure it was “not a question of money”. ” The team has many resources, with factories located in Viry-Châtillon and Enstone on the Alpine side “, he added. While Alpine should start a new chapter in its history in 2026 through a technical partnership with Mercedes, Esteban Ocon will be observing this from a distance, having started from next season Starting with Oliver Bellman at Haas, he will be keeping a close eye on the situation with his former team. I hope she can be competitive again like she was in the past ”, concludes the Norman. There are a lot of new technicians and I wish them all the best. I won’t be there to see how it turns out, but I hope this brand can shine again . »The upcoming decisions of Flavio Briatore and Bruno Farming will be key for France’s future.\n1721941738\n#Alpine #Ocon #points #teams #failings",

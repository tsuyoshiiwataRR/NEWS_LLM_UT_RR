    "text": "The nation jumped on the Matildas bandwagon after their success at the 2023 World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand. Now many are asking if the ride can continue.Controversial Brisbane radio host and former Wallaby fullback Greg Martin might have said what everyone was thinking on Triple M on Friday morning.\\u003cbr\\u003eThe Matildas must now beat Zambia in their next match on Sunday or their hopes of making the quarter-finals could be quickly over, given the perennial powerhouse US women's team awaits in the final group stage game. The US beat Zambia 3-0 Friday morning (AEST) to join Germany at the top of Australia's group.And let's not forget about the other Australian women's teams, some of them perhaps a more realistic chance for a medal. Some of them might even be asking why the Matildas are getting all the attention.The women's rugby sevens team start their campaign on July 29 at midnight local time against South Africa. They might have finished a disappointing fifth in Tokyo but they've been in great form during the international sevens season, finishing only two points behind New Zealand in second place.And the Opals are currently ranked third in the world behind US and China. Their opening game is against Nigeria at 7pm on July 29.The Hockeyroos might surprise a few people, too. Their opening match is July 28 at 8.45pm against South Africa.Our women's water polo team, the Stingers, have an experienced squad and could also upset more fancied teams. Their first game is July 28 at 4.05am against China.\\u003cbr\\u003e",

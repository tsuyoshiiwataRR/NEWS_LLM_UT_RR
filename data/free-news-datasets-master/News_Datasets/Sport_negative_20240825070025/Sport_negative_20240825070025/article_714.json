    "text": "The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has further extended the suspension of accreditation imposed on the anti-doping laboratory in Bloemfontein, South Africa, for a second period of up to six months.\nIn March 2024, WADA imposed a six-month suspension due to multiple non-conformities with the International Standard for Laboratories (ISL), including non-conformities with Technical Documents (TDs) and the continued Analytical Testing Restriction (ATR) on the Laboratory’s Gas Chromatography / Combustion / Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS) analytical method, among other issues. The ATR was imposed in September 2023.\nBased on the recommendation of the Laboratory Expert Advisory Group (Lab EAG), the Chair of the WADA Executive Committee has confirmed the extension of the Laboratory’s suspension for another six months until 1 March 2025, or until the date that the requirements are met, if earlier.\nThe suspension, which took effect on 1 March 2024, prohibits the laboratory from carrying out any anti-doping activities, including analyses of urine and blood samples, except analysis related to the Athlete Biological Passport Hematological Module. The extension was granted based on the laboratory’s request, which included justifications for the delay, to have sufficient time to address issues related to the suspension.\nDuring the extended period of suspension, the laboratory shall address all non-conformities identified by the Lab EAG, or WADA in any request for corrective action or otherwise, as well as, any additional non-conformities identified by any follow-up WADA site visit during the suspension period. If the laboratory satisfies the Lab EAG in meeting these requirements, it may apply for reinstatement before the expiry of the extended suspension period.\nIn accordance with the ISL, WADA is responsible for accrediting and re-accrediting anti-doping laboratories, thereby ensuring that they maintain the highest quality standards. This monitoring process is conducted in conjunction with the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) assessment by independent national accreditation bodies that are full members of the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC).\nIn this article Wada World Anti-Doping Agency Related Remo Stars poised for NPFL glory after steady rise June 14, 2024 Enugu Rangers poised for eighth NPFL title as Remo Stars face tough away game June 14, 2024 Bolt hosts second edition of 'Bolt Driver's Football League' to foster unity, inclusion June 13, 2024 Nigeria beat Liberia to qualify for U-17 women's World Cup June 14, 2024 Hurdler Amusan to be Nigeria's Olympics flagbearer 3 days ago Boxer, Olaore, promises to end Nigeria’s 28-year Olympics jinx 1 day ago 0 Comments cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.\nFlag Comment Why are you flagging this comment?\nI disagree with this user\nTargeted harassment - posted harassing comments or discussions targeting me, or encouraged others to do so\nSpam - posted spam comments or discussions\nInappropriate profile - profile contains inappropriate images or text\nThreatening content - posted directly threatening content\nPrivate information - posted someone else's personally identifiable information\nBefore flagging, please keep in mind that Disqus does not moderate communities.

    "text": "“We did it. WE DID IIIIIIIIT!” Winning his first ever title back in June, these were one of the first words that came out of Jayson Tatum’s mouth. But for Boston fans and the rest of the world, it seemed like they had seen this movie before. Where? You ask. Well, 16 years ago when Kevin Garnett led the team in green to the title and yelled, “Anything’s possible. ANYTHING’S POSIBLEEE!” Sure enough, that marked the beginning of JT’s “Plagiarism World Tour” as the hits just kept on coming.\nAnd Tatum has become the talk of the town once again after the NBA World began mocking him for another act of plagiarism. Yes, starring in the cover of Sports Illustrated, the Celtics superstar can be seen in a crisp black and white suit, holding a glass of champagne, raising a toast for his recent win. However, the picture is eerily similar to the iconic Leonardo DiCaprio meme from the 2013 film ‘The Great Gatsby’ where the Hollywood star poses in a similar fashion. And the similarity caught the fans attention as one wrote, “Jayson Tatum not beating the allegations.”\nJayson Tatum not beating the allegations\n[pic.twitter.com/TDTNW5Llyl]\n— Mink Flow (@currypistonn)\n[July 25, 2024]\n(Developing Story)",

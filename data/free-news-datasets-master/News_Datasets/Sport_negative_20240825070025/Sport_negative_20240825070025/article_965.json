    "text": "Paula Radcliffe, the former marathon world record-holder has apologised after defending the decision to allow Dutch beach volleyball player Steven van de Velde, a convicted child rapist, to compete in the Paris Olympics. Also Read:Carrying the Olympic flame in Torch Relay was honour beyond words: Abhinav Bindra Radcliffes initial remarks, which appeared to extend support to van de Velde, have drawn widespread condemnation, prompting her to issue an apology and clarify her stance. Recognizing the widespread disapproval, Radcliffe took to social media to apologise. I can only apologise, that isnt what I intended to say. I stress that it isnt something that can be excused in any way, she posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.",

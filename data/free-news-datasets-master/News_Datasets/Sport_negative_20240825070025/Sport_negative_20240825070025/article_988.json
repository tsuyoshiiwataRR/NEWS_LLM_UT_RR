It was the little things, …\nThey overcame four errors to win Thursday, 4-3. In Tuesday’s game one, Lancaster gave away critical outs on the bases and squandered an elite starting pitching performance by Noah Bremer.\nThat part repeated Thursday. Starter Matt Swarmer got his team into the seventh inning with the lead, allowed one earned run and struck out 13, tying a club record for Ks in a game also shared by Eric Junge (2010) and Bryan Evans (2016).\nSwarmer, a Governor Mifflin High School and Kuztown University product, pitched 34 innings for the Chicago Cubs in 2022. This season, he has struck out 23 in his last 13 and two-thirds innings.\nYork whiffed 18 times Thursdays against six Lancaster pitchers. And won anyway.\nIsan Diaz’ two-run homer in the fifth gave the Stormers a 2-0 lead. York tied it with single runs in the sixth (two singles and a sac fly) and seventh (a seeing-eye RBI single by Alfredo Reyes on Swarmer’s last pitch of the night.\nThe Revs went to the ninth inning with the lead thanks mostly to three wild pitches, the second of which bounced and spun to rest no more than five feet from the plate. It allowed speedy York leadoff man Rudy Martin, who had walked and stole second, to fly home safe on a close play.\nDrama was coming. Lancaster’s Joe Carpenter erased that deficit and ignited the crowd with a solo homer to right center with one out in the ninth.\nBoth bullpens made big pitehes to drag the game wo the 12th, in which Rhinesmith delivered the game-winner, an opposite-field liner to left.\nThe Stormers are still in first place in the Atlantic League’s North Division, two games ahead of York, which won the first half\nLancaster now hits the road for a nine-game swing through the New York City metroplex, starting with a weekend three-game series at Long Island. Lefty Brady Tedesco (0-2) gets the start on the mound Friday.\nNewsletter Success! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup.\nError!

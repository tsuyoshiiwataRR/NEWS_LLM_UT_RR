    "text": "(Photo by Frank Jansky/Icon Sportswire)\nThe Cincinnati Bengals are dealing with their own contract dispute with Pro Bowl wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase.\nAccording to insider Dov Kleiman, Chase is not practicing at training camp for the second consecutive day as he awaits a new contract.\nThe three-time Pro-Bowler is now supposed to be the focal point of Cincinnati’s offense with former Pro Bowl running back Joe Mixon now on the Houston Texans.\nBengals WR Ja’Marr Chase is not participating at practice for the second straight day.\nHe’s currently seeking a new contract. pic.twitter.com/stDbsc7WtX\n— Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) July 25, 2024\nThe reason why this is also such a big situation is because fellow Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins, who is going to play on the franchise tag in 2024 after failing to earn a major extension this offseason, might be playing in his final season with Cincinnati.\nOffensively, the Bengals cannot afford to lose both Chase and Higgins in the coming years, and if there is a decent chance that they could lose Higgins next year, they are going to need to go all-in on this season with the roster that they have.\nIt might be paramount for them to pay Chase right now so that he can get back on the practice field to catch passes from starting quarterback Joe Burrow.\nThe former Offensive Rookie of the Year in Chase has recorded three consecutive seasons of 125+ targets, 80+ receptions, 1,000+ yards, and seven or more touchdown catches.\nIt is hard to get more consistent than that.\nWhat more does the Bengals front office need to see to convince themselves that Chase needs to be paid?\nIf they take too long to pay him, this issue could linger into the preseason and affect his feelings toward the organization in a negative way.",

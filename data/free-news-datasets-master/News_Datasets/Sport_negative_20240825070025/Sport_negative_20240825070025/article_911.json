    "text": "A controversial conservative commentator has sparked debate after declaring that she hoped the Matildas would lose their first game.\nKobie Thatcher, who is known for her outspoken views, shared a post on social media on Thursday night.\n‘I’ll say it now because I’m not staying up until 3am: I hope the woke Matildas lose tomorrow morning’s game,’ she wrote.\nHer hopes were fulfilled when, at 3am AEST, Tony Gustavsson’s side succumbed to a 3-0 thrashing at the hands of Germany in the opening Group B match in Marseille.\nWhile some labelled Ms Thatcher’s comments ‘unpatriotic’ and ‘un-Australian’, many others praised her position.\n‘As predicted, they were dreadful,’ former NSW One Nation leader Mark Lathan said.\n‘Over-hyped by the media, as usual.’\nKobie Thatcher, who is known for her outspoken views,said she refused to wake up to watch the Matildas and hoped they would lose\nHer hopes were fulfilled when, at 3am AEST, Tony Gustavsson’s side succumbed to a 3-0 thrashing at the hands of Germany in the opening Group B match in Marseille (pictured: stunned players after the loss)\nSeveral others accused the Matildas of being overly focussed on ‘woke’ issues at the expense of their football.\n‘Can’t say I’m sad to see this woke, arrogant, overrated bunch who have achieved nothing get embarrassed on the world stage yet again,’ seethed one online commentator.\nAnother asked: ‘When will sports administrators learn the lesson of: Go Woke, Go Broke?’\nIt is unclear exactly why the Matildas have been accused of being ‘woke’.\nIn 2021, Pauline Hanson criticised the team for posing with the Aboriginal flag before a match.\nWhile not as overtly critical, many loyal fans were left equally disappointed by the Matildas’ lacklustre performance.\n‘Ahhhh Tillies this is hard to watch at 4.30am,’ said one fan as the third goal went in.\nAnother said: ‘Not exactly what you hope for when you get up at 3am to watch.’\n‘This is rough for 4.30am,’ said a third fan.\nOther fans highlighted a lack of energy from the World Cup semi-finalists, an uncharacteristic trait from Gustavsson’s side.\n‘Matildas are so unfit it’s not even funny anymore,’ said one fan.\nAnother added: ‘This is the worst I’ve seen them play in a long while.’\nSeveral critics accused the Matildas of being overly focussed on ‘woke’ issues at the expense of their football\nBut for most fans, there was only one person to blame for the team’s Marseille misery.\n‘Tony Gustavsson has rarely got it wrong in matches during major tournaments during his tenure, but this one ranks alongside the Nigeria nightmare,’ one fans said.\n‘Wrong tactics with the high press and because of that starting the wrong players.’\n‘Tony Gustavsson is the Brad Fittler of women’s football,’ another fan said. ‘Straight up holding our team back.’\nThe Matildas barely created a worthwhile chance, any decent approach work being scuppered by poor build-up delivery, and the Germans were decisive winners with two headed goals for Marina Hegering and Lea Schueller from corners, before 21-year-old Jule Brand fittingly wrapped up the most comprehensive of victories.\nIt is not the first time Ms Thatcher has caused a stir with her comments.\nEarlier this year, she accused the bosses of Westfield Bondi Junction of ‘woke nonsense’ after they held a ‘community reflection day’ when they reopened following the stabbing murders of six people at the hands of schizophrenic knifeman Joel Cauchi.\nShe doubled down in a subsequent post, writing: ‘Virtue Signalling Day at Bondi Junction. Oh, I mean “Community Reflection Day”.’\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n***\nRead more at DailyMail.co.uk",

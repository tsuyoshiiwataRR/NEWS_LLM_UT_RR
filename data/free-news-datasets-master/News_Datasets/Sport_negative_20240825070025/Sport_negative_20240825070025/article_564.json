    "text": "Kansas City Chiefs Chris Jones lashes out and demands more from Chiefs teammates amid training camp sluggishness It's been a very different preseason for Jones relative to last year\nLapresse JB Actualizado 25/07/2024 - 11:42 CDT\nCompartir en Facebook\nCompartir en Twitter\nCompartir en Telegram\nCompartir en Whatsapp\nEnviar por email NFL. Chris Jones is pleased with the chemistry he has had with Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce in training camp NFL. Chiefs going nuclear: Mahomes' deep attack is poised to make history and Andy Reid is happy about it D o you know what makes championship teams successful? Competitive fire, and never letting your guard down. That is the challenge facing the Kansas City Chiefs in 2024 -- a team that, arguably, has the largest target on its back in recent memory.\nThe Chiefs are hoping to play in Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans next February, as they seek to become the first team in NFL history to win the Super Bowl in three consecutive seasons. If winning it once was challenging, and winning it twice took everything Kansas City had, securing the \"three-peat\" is a daunting task -- and Chris Jones wants to make sure his teammates are up for it.\nJones isn't satisfied During a session at training camp this week, Jones laid in to the Chiefs' defensive linemen for their effort. The summer heat wasn't blazing quite like Jones was, and he is proving that his mammoth contract extension hasn't changed him a bit.\nFollowing a holdout last summer that bled into the regular season, Jones re-upped with Kansas City this spring, signing a contract that could be worth nearly $160 million if he hits every clause in it. The three-time Super Bowl champion and two-time All-Pro wants to keep winning -- and he is not afraid to get in his teammates' faces about it.\nWhether the players loved this energy hasn't been conclusively proven -- but Chiefs fans sure enjoyed the tongue-lashing. Jones was described as a \"leader of men\" by a fan on X/Twitter , indicative of the high esteem in which the 30-year-old is held in Kansas City. He is driven to lift everyone around him -- and with back-to-back double-digit sack seasons on his resume, Jones' teammates would be wise to listen to him.",

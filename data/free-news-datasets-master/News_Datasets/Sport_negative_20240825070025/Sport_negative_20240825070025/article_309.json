    "text": "[wrestling](/wrestling/) / [News](/wrestling/category/News/) Corey Graves Reacts To Unprotected Chairshot to Jack Perry On AEW Dynamite Corey Graves wasn‚Äôt a fan of Jack Perry taking an unprotected chairshot to the head on last night‚Äôs AEW Dynamite. The Blood & Guts match that main evented last night‚Äôs show saw Perry get handcuffed to the side of the cage, and at one point Mark Briscoe waffled him in the head with a chair. Graves, who retired from the ring due to concussion issues, posted to his Twitter account and wrote: ‚ÄúThis is not meant to sound judgmental, or incite ‚Äòus vs. them‚Äô or question anybody‚Äôs passion, or talent or intentions. This is just coming from a guy whose career ended from a few too many ACCIDENTAL headshots. The ART of this business is protecting ourselves and each other. Trust me‚Ä¶the gaps in memory are not worth it. I promise.‚Äù Graves has since deleted the tweet. Some fans online have defended the spot, arguing that the chair was gimmicked. You can see Graves‚Äô tweet and a clip of the chair shot in the below tweet: In a now deleted tweet, Corey Graves seemingly responded to Jack Perry taking an unprotected chair shot to the head during the [#AEWBloodAndGuts]Match on [#AEWDynamite]on Wednesday. I couldn‚Äôt agree more. üëè I don‚Äôt understand how people can argue/attack someone for being RIGHT. [pic.twitter.com/7EU5P3McDB] ‚Äî PW Chronicle (@_PWChronicle) [July 25, 2024]",

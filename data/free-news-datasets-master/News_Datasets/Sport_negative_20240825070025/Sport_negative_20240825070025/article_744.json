This decision comes in light of disrupting New Zealandâ€™s training ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Assistant coach Andy Spence will lead the team in her absence. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 26-07-2024 06:26 IST | Created: 26-07-2024 06:26 IST The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) has suspended Women's National Team Head Coach Bev Priestman amid a drone spying scandal that has cast the 2020 gold medalists in an unfavorable light. Assistant coach Andy Spence will take over for the rest of the Paris games, the COC announced on Thursday. In a statement, Canada Soccer CEO & General Secretary Kevin Blue disclosed that further information about previous drone use against opponents had surfaced, leading to Priestman's suspension for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games and until an independent external review is completed. The scandal erupted after a drone operated by a Canada Soccer staff member disrupted New Zealand's training session on Monday, days before their opening match against Canada. Priestman, who sat out the opening game voluntarily, apologized to the New Zealand team and took full responsibility for the incident. FIFA has initiated disciplinary proceedings against Canada Soccer, Priestman, and two staff members now expelled from the Paris Games. An independent external review will be conducted into the drone incident and the historic culture of competitive ethics within Canada Soccer's programs. Canada Soccer has not responded to requests for further comments. The Canadian team is set to face France on Sunday in Saint-Etienne. (With inputs from agencies.)",

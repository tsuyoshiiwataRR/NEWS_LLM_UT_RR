IT’S ACTUALLY LOOKING A LITTLE RAINY FOR SOME OF THE EVENTS, ESPECIALLY ON SATURDAY. AND EVEN FOR THE OPENING CEREMONY. RIGHT NOW I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT’S HAPPENING IN PARIS AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT, OF COURSE, THE LATEST ON OUR SATELLITE AND RADAR SHOWING SOME PASSING SHOWERS THAT HAVE BEEN MOVING IN AND OUT OF THE AREA AT THE MOMENT. IT IS CURRENTLY DRY 70 DEGREES THERE. OF COURSE, THEY ARE SIX HOURS AHEAD OF US HERE AND IT’S 70 DEGREES NOW WITH A MOSTLY CLOUDY SKY, VERY LIGHT WIND COMING IN OUT OF THE NORTHWEST AROUND SIX MILES PER HOUR, AND YOUR FORECAST FOR OPENING CEREMONY AT 1:30 P.M. LOCAL TIME HERE 7:30 P.M. THERE. IT IS GOING TO BE 75 DEGREES, BUT ALSO THE CHANCE OF A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS HERE AND THERE. AND AS FAR AS THE FORECAST GOES FOR SATURDAY, I KNOW A LOT MORE EVENTS HAPPENING, INCLUDING DIVING, SOME SWIMMING, A LOT OF, YOU KNOW, BIKING EVENTS OF COURSE, EVEN SKATEBOARDING IS OUTDOORS, I BELIEVE. AND THAT’S GOING TO BE POSSIBLY AN ISSUE FOR SOME OF THOSE WITH THE CHANCE FOR SOME RAIN THAT WILL BE OFF AND ON AS WE MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING HERE LOCAL TIME. THAT WILL BE NOON, OF COURSE, PARIS TIME AND THEN WE CONTINUE TO PUSH THE CLOCK AHEAD HERE ON OUR FUTURE CAST. LOOKING TOWARDS MIDNIGHT, MOST OF THAT RAIN EVENTUALLY STARTING TO FALL APART. MEANWHILE, THE HIGH TEMPERATURE FOR THE DAY 67°F. WITH THAT LIGHT WIND JUST COMING IN AROUND SIX MILES PER HOUR. SO YES, THERE WILL BE THE CHANCE OF RAIN. BUT FRIDAY, ESPECIALLY AFTERNOON AND EVENING, AND THEN SATURDAY, EARLY MORNING INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY, BUT DRYING OUT BY THE EVENING HOURS.\nAdvertisement\nWeather Talk: Beginning of Paris Olympics expected to be rainy\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics are close to getting underway, but rain could disrupt some of the early events, including the opening ceremony.

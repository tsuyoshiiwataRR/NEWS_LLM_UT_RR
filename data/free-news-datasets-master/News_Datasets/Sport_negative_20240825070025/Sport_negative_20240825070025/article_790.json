    "text": "Nigeria’s return to the Olympics saw the Super Falcons lose to Brazil in their Paris 2024 opener. Nigeria’s Super Falcons made their long-awaited return to Olympic football after a 16-year absence, but their Paris 2024 campaign got off to a disappointing start with a 1-0 loss to Brazil in their opening match. The game’s decisive moment came in the first half when Gabriela Nunes Da Silva unleashed a ferocious strike that proved to be the only goal of the contest. A positive start by Randy Waldrum women which saw Chiwendu Ihezuo miss Nigeria’s best chance of the game, the Super Falcons played second fiddle all through the encounter after plenty of attacking intent. Nigeria had three big chances in quick succession, one of which was led by Rasheedat Ajibade, Nigeria’s best player, beating her marker before crossing for Ihezuo, whose header was saved by Brazil’s goalkeeper. It was the Super Falcons’ best chance and Ihezuo, who was favoured to start by a Nigerian legend, should have scored. However, the Samba Girls took control after those threatening moments, going on to control the game en route to another win against Nigeria. This result extends Brazil’s unbeaten run against Nigeria to four matches, continuing the Super Falcons’ struggles against the Samba Girls. This defeat marks a challenging start for Randy Waldrum’s side, who find themselves in a formidable Group C alongside reigning world champions Spain and Asian powerhouse Japan. The match echoed their previous Olympic meeting in Beijing 2008, which was also Nigeria’s last appearance in the tournament.",

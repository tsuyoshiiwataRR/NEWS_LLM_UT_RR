    "text": "PORT ANGELES — For the third straight game, Victoria pitching kept the Port Angeles bats in check as the Lefties could only manage five hits in a 6-3 loss at Civic Field, completing the three-game sweep. Despite the sweep, the Lefties (7-8 second half) remain just 2½ games out of first place as first-place Wenatchee lost. In three games against the HarbourCats, the Lefties managed just 17 hits and six runs. The Lefties pitched well enough, holding the HarbourCats to just two runs after the fourth inning. Starter Colby Schueber (Cal State, San Bernardino) took the loss, going four innings and allowing four runs on six hits. He struck out two and walked one. Takuma Sato (Mount Hood CC) and Francisco Lopez (Dyersburg State, CC) pitched a combined 2⅓ scoreless innings, allowing one hit and no walks. They struck out two. Kosei Suzuki (Frank Phillips College) had an RBI double. Jason Leon (Cal State, Bakersfield) had a hit and scored a run, while Jeremy Giesegh (Cal State, San Bernardino), Roberto Garza-Nunez (Embry-Riddle) and Yahir Ramirez (Texas A&M, Corpus Christi) all had hits. Port Angeles (13-29 overall) played the Everett Merchants in a nonleague game Thursday night after press deadline, then hit the road to play at Kelowna (6-9, 17-24) at 6:35 p.m. today.

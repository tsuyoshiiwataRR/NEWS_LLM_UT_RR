    "text": "In the history of Team USA men’s basketball, there hasn’t been much sniping or in-fighting when it comes to the Olympics and the actual competition. Most of the drama happens beforehand, when the roster is being put together.\nBy the time the team is all together, it’s usually all gravy on the way to the gold medal.\nThe 2024 version of the Olympic squad has been a little different.\nFirst, there was the controversy surrounding the exit of Los Angeles Clippers forward Kawhi Leonard and the addition of his replacement, Boston Celtics guard Derrick White , instead of his teammate and NBA Finals MVP Jaylen Brown .\nNow, it’s Philadelphia 76ers center and first-time Olympian Joel Embiid and his comments to The New York Times Magazine criticizing the age and skill of some of his teammates — particularly LeBron James — on Team USA that drew a rebuke from one of the senior members of the team.\n“You look at the talent that the U.S. has, but there’s equal talent on other teams,” Embiid said. “And the talent that’s on the U.S. team, you also got to understand most of those guys are older. The LeBron now is not the LeBron that was a couple of years ago. So it’s a big difference. Everybody would also tell you, and you can see for yourself, the athletic LeBron, dominant that he was a couple of years ago, is not the same that he is now. I think people get fooled by the names on paper. But those names have been built throughout their career, and now they’re older. They’re not what they used to be.”\nSeven players on Team USA’s roster are 30 years old or older, including Embiid, with James the oldest at 39 years old. James, who is trying for his third Olympic gold medal, led Team USA in points (14.8) and assists (3.6) through exhibition play.\nJames also almost single-handedly saved Team USA from two defeats in exhibition play, rallying them from late deficits against South Sudan and Germany.",

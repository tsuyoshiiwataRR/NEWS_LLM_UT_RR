    "text": "As the Summer rolls on, Hubert Davis and the North Carolina Tar Heels are focusing on recruits in both the 2025 and 2026 classes. As they are picking up some momentum with recruits, there are other recruitments where it’s becoming clear where their position is.\nAnd that’s potentially the case for five-star power forward Caleb Wilson\nThe Atlanta product talked to Sam Lance and Adam Zagoria of Zag’s Blog to discuss the latest on his recruitment. In the article, he talks about seven teams in his recruitment but does NOT mention North Carolina. Instead, he dishes on Kentucky , Duke , Arkansas , Tennessee , Auburn , Georgia Tech, and Baylor.\nNow, that doesn’t mean UNC is out of the running but it’s also not a good thing that he didn’t mention the Tar Heels.\nWilson did visit UNC last year and also saw their game against Georgia Tech on the road. He has plans to watch another North Carolina game this season and until the Tar Heels are eliminated we can’t really count them out.\nHe’s also getting set to trim his list to 8 or 10 finalists in the coming weeks he told Lance and Zagoria. So we will have to see if UNC makes that cut.\nThis recruitment is still one to watch but there’s a feeling that maybe UNC has some ground to make up for Wilson.\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.",

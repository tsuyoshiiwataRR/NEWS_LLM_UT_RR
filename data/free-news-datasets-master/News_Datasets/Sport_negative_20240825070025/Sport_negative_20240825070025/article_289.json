    "text": "By Amanda Blankenship July 25, 2024 News Katie Hauss set out to enjoy a day of watching some of her favorite celebrities golf at the American Century Championship on July 12. Among the list of celebs present was Travis Kelce . What she didn’t expect was for the NFL player to send a golf ball straight into the back of her head. Here’s what happened.\nKatie Hauss Got Knocked Down By Travis Kelce’s Golf Ball Without any warning, Katie said that she felt something hit the back of her head. “When I got hit, I immediately felt pain,” she told People . At that point, she said she was “trying to focus on not blacking out.”\n“I didn’t really know what had happened,” Katie admitted. “I then heard people start yelling and screaming that it was Travis Kelce’s golf shot, and ‘Oh my god, that girl just got hit in the head.’”\nThe 37-year-old looked to her husband, Ryan Griffiths, for support. She told him that she believed she was okay, but that the site where the golf ball hit her just hurt. “Then when I put my hand to my head there was a lot of blood,” Katie recalled.\nInstagram/Katie Hauss Griffiths Then, she said that a “Good Samaritan” stepped forward to help. The person applied pressure to the wound on her head and instructed her to stay still as they called in EMTs to their location. “I am just so appreciative to that man for helping me, a complete stranger, and I wish I could thank him for his kindness,” she said.\nTravis Kelce and his brother Jason were among the celebrities golfing that Friday. It was, in fact, Travis’ golf ball that struck the back of Katie’s head.\nNo Hard Feelings Between Katie & Travis After realizing what went down, Travis and Jason made their way over to make sure Katie was okay. “Travis must have walked down as I was still on the ground,” she said. “I just remember seeing him come up and then I don’t remember exactly what he said, but he asked if I was ok. I could tell that he felt really badly.”\nThe NFL joked and said that the least he could do was take a photo with the woman. Katie said that she stood up and joked that the front of her looked all right for photos.\n“Travis said that he couldn’t bring himself to smile given the circumstances,” she said. “I honestly felt bad for him, because I know that it was a total accident, and that can’t feel good to do that with a huge crowd looking on.”\nKatie also remembered that Travis Kelce’s brother, Jason, seemed to be really worried about her. He asked her if she was okay a number of times.\nWhen EMTs arrived, they realized Katie’s head had been split open. They suggested that she go to the hospital to make sure nothing serious happened as a result of the knock on her head. In the emergency room, she received several stitches and doctors confirmed she had a concussion.\nAn episode of the “ New Heights ” podcast didn’t age well. Prior to Jason and Travis Kelce making their way to the tournament, Travis joked, “Don’t feel bad if you hit somebody because they bought the ticket.”\nHowever, there are no hard feelings on Katie’s behalf. She says that she still can’t believe the entire ordeal happened.\nAuthor Recent Posts Amanda Blankenship Amanda Blankenship is an overcaffeinated wife and mother.

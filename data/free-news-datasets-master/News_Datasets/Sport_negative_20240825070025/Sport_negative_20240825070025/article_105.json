    "text": "Australia face an uphill battle in their hopes of emulating their breakthrough bronze medal of three years ago when the Paris Olympics tournament tips off this weekend.\nBoomers legend Shane Heal is confident the Aussies can survive their intimidating draw to make the quarter-finals and play their way into the final four to have a shot at a medal.\nBut he is concerned the controversial omission of defensive specialist Matisse Thybulle could cost Brian Goorjian and his team when they match up against gigantic superstars like Greek lynchpin Giannis Antetokounmpo, French phenom Victor Wembanyama or Team USA’s tall timber.\nThe Boomers have not only been drawn in the dreaded “Group of Death” for the 12-team competition but they have slipped down the global pecking order since Patty Mills led them to their famous “rose gold” third-placed finish in Tokyo.\nOlympic Games Paris 2024. Every Event. Ad-free. Live & On Demand. 4K. 8 Exclusive International channels from Eurosport, Viacom18 and Sky NZ, only on Stan Sport .\nFor Mills and long-time teammate Joe Ingles, this is their last chance to claim another medal at a major tournament after the disappointing 10th-placed finish at last year’s World Cup.\nAnd they have to negotiate easily the toughest of the three pools of four with a Canada side stacked with elite NBA talent, Greece led by Antetokounmpo and perennial contenders Spain standing in their way.\nThybulle has his limitations as a scorer but Heal, who will be part of Stan Sport’s Olympics basketball coverage, said the Boomers could miss his extra length on the wings.\nIt was surprising to see a veteran like Matthew Dellavedova, natural treasure that he is, and Tasmania JackJumpers forward Jack McVeigh get the nod ahead of him.\n“I was shocked that they didn’t take Matisse Thybulle,” Heal told The Roar .\nPatty Mills and Matisse Thybulle at the Paris Olympics. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\n“I thought he was one of their key guys and I’m still scratching my head about how he’s not in there because you’d think that he would have played a major role, particularly in some of the defensive assignments he would have got, even in the pool games.”\nFor Goorjian’s squad to make it to the pointy end of the Olympics, the young guns need to fire.\nJosh Giddey has been charged with the responsibility of running the offence while fellow NBA lottery pick Dyson Daniels will be given the task of leading the perimeter defence.\n“Some of the older guys will be playing their last Olympics with Joe Ingles and Patty Mills but with the new guys coming in, it’s Josh Giddey’s team now,” Heal said.\n“With Dyson Daniels and Josh Green and these younger guys coming through, it’s a changing of the guard, but we’ve put together a really talented squad and they’ve got belief.\nShane Heal is a part of Stan Sport’s Olympics lineup, the only place to watch every event from Paris 2024 ad-free, live and on demand with 4K. With exclusive features including international multi-language channels and minis, go to Stan.com.au/Olympics for more info.\n“I think they’re going to be in the mix for a medal.\n“Giddey showed at the World Cup he’s up to this level. Even though the team didn’t perform that well, he had an amazing tournament and I think he’ll only grow from there.\n“He’s an elite point guard in the world and I think the next NBA season with Chicago, I think he’s going to take another step forward as well.\n“I think had we had a few more shooters on the perimeter, it would make it a little bit easier for him.”\nMore Olympics 'To target the Games is to target France': Arson attacks leave Paris in chaos hours from Olympic opening ceremony 'Smash the bastards': How an iconic Bob Hawke quip inspired Aussie sevens to USA annihilation in Olympic quarter-final 'Heads up their bums': Former Wallaby, Socceroo torch Matildas for 'believing their own hype' after Olympic horror show When do Australia's rugby sevens play their Olympics semi-final and how do I watch it?

I think that’s what we were built on – grit and determination and toughness but it felt like we had shooters.\n“It’s a bit of a weakness for the Boomers and it’s one of the areas that I’m a little bit concerned about. If Paddy isn’t hitting, then we don’t have another guy that’s known as a knockdown shooter.”\nHeal thinks Australia’s frontcourt rotations of Jock Landale, Duop Reath, the ever-reliable Nick Kay and back-up centre Will Magnay will be imposing presences in the paint.\n“I think Magnay was a good selection because he’s a real big body and he’s a shot blocker,” Heal added. “He’s more of a roller to the basket than anything else, but he’s a big, tough guy. I think he had some legitimate size for us.\n“Nick Kay has been around for a while, is a great defender and plays a really good role as well. He’s got that toughness that I think can complement the other pieces of the team.”\nAustralia tip off their campaign on Saturday night at 7pm (AEST) against Spain before taking on second favourites Canada on Tuesday and Greece in their final pool game next Friday.\nLeBron James is guarded heavily by Josh Green. (Photo by Christopher Pike/Getty Images)\n“Canada’s got NBA players all over the place, they’re going to be extremely tough to beat. I think they’re the second best team in the tournament,” Heal said.\n“They’re a little bit outside our reach. I hope I’m wrong, but they’ve got some legitimate NBA superstars like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. And the core of that group played together in the World Cup, when they medalled (snaring bronze by beating USA).\n“They’re going to be better than what they were last time. Then they’ve added Jamal Murray, an NBA champion, and Andrew Wiggins.\n“I think we can beat Spain and Greece. And we have to. I mean, if we don’t, then we’re not going through. I don’t think Spain’s the same sort of level as what we’ve seen the Spanish teams in the past.\n“Greece, it’s all about shutting down Giannis, basically. Giannis is just such a unique beast that it makes that game challenging because you have to throw so many different people and double teams and clog the floor. It will allow some of their shooters to get open.\n“Landal and Reath have had a bit of experience against him and players like him (in the NBA) but I think Matisse would have been a great match-up for him. A little bit smaller, but quicker and athletic and able to get the ball out of his hands.\n“I’m not sure who else they’re going to play because it’s not a natural fit. You think a Landale probably isn’t going to have the same quickness to be able to play with him. And Reath’s used to defending bigger guys.\n“Giannis creates that match-up problem because whilst he’s the same size as those big guys, he’s got the quickness of a guard. So it’s going to be a massive challenge for the Boomers.\nIf they are to go deep in the tournament, the colossus of Team USA will be the greatest of obstacles to overcome with LeBron James, Steph Curry, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis and Anthony Edwards headlining an all-star roster.\nShane Heal. (Photo by Mark Evans/Getty Images)\nHeal said they have looked a bit vulnerable in their warm-up games, including a narrow win over Australia, but he suspected they were cruising before the real matches tip off.\n“Once they get their systems right, they get their roles, they’re used to playing with each other, I think it’s going to be really difficult for anyone to beat them,” Heal predicted.\n“I think Canada’s the best chance because they’ve got the firepower to really get hot. I’m not saying that they’re unbeatable, but I think you’re going to have to play really, really well and catch them on a bad night if you’re going to beat them.”\nAnd while Heal has faith that the Boomers can overcome the odds to be one of the last four teams standing, he said it has never been tougher at the top with the rise of teams like Serbia, Canada, Germany and France.\n“I just want to make sure the public understand how difficult it is. They’re going to have to win massive games to get into the top four,” he said.\n“We’ve got more talent than we’ve ever had before, but it’s really tough to do it. They’re capable, and I think that they’ll get their opportunities. It’s just going to come down to whether you win those big crossover games against powerful opposition.”\nThe Barkley incident lives on The most famous moment of Heal’s career occurred 28 years ago when he was involved in a fracas with American superstar Charles Barkley in a warm-up match before the Atlanta Olympics.\nHeal embodied the Boomers’ spirit of never backing down to anyone when he chest-bumped his much bigger superstar opponent in one of the iconic incidents in Australian sporting folklore.\nWith the Olympics rolling around, he probably gets asked about it again.\n“It’s not just when the Olympics are on, I reckon I get asked about that every second day,” he said with a laugh.\n“It’s resonated in people’s minds from back in the day as something they think of immediately.\n“Some people don’t let the facts stand in the way of the story. They are like ‘oh, I remember when you got into it with that big Shaquille O’Neal’. And I’m like ‘yeah, close’.\n“It’s the typical Australian way because everyone remembers the fight. I feel like saying ‘you know I had eight threes in that game, how about you remember that?’ It’s funny.”\nBack then when the US were considered unbeatable, Heal and his contemporaries like Andrew Gaze would often say that they weren’t invincible and the day would come when another team would knock them off their throne.\nIt was only a relatively short time later that the unthinkable happened in the 2004 Olympics at Athens when they returned home with the bronze after Argentina beat them in the semis and then knocked over Italy in the gold medal game.\n“At that time they were pretty invincible with the team and the legends that they put together,” Heal said of the 1996 line-up which also featured Hall of Famers Hakeem Olajuwon, Scottie Pippen, David Robinson, John Stockton and Karl Malone.\n“But it’s interesting how time evolves as well and it was only a few years later when they lost.”\nParis Olympics men’s basketball tournament Boomers schedule Saturday, July 27: Paris 2024 Olympics | Boomers vs Spain | Pierre Mauroy Stadium, Lille – France 5:00pm (AWST) 6:00pm (ACST) 7:00pm (AEST)\nTuesday, July 30: Paris 2024 Olympics | Boomers vs Canada | Pierre Mauroy Stadium, Lille – France 7:30pm (AWST) 8:30pm (ACST) 9:30pm (AEST)\nFriday, August 2: Paris 2024 Olympics | Boomers vs Greece| Pierre Mauroy Stadium, Lille – France 7:30pm (AWST) 8:30pm (ACST) 9:30pm (AEST)\nSquads Group A: Canada, Greece, Australia, Spain\nGroup B: Germany, France, Brazil, Japan\nGroup C: USA, Serbia, Puerto Rico, South Sudan\nAustralia: Dyson Daniels, Matthew Dellavedova, Dante Exum, Josh Giddey, Josh Green, Joe Ingles, Nick Kay, Jock Landale, Will Magnay, Jack McVeigh, Patty Mills, Duop Reath\nBrazil: Marcelinho Huertas, Yago Santos, Raul Neto, Alexey Borges, Elinho Corazza, Georginho de Paula, Vitor Benite, Léo Meindl, Gui Santos, Didi Louzada, Bruno Caboclo, Joao Cardoso, Lucas Dias, Cristiano Felício\nCanada: Nickeil Alexander-Walker, RJ Barrett, Khem Birch, Dillon Brooks, Luguentz Dort, Melvin Ejim, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Trey Lyles, Jamal Murray, Andrew Nembhard, Kelly Olynyk, Dwight Powell\nFrance: Andrew Albicy, Nicolas Batum, Isaia Cordinier, Bilal Coulibaly, Nando De Colo, Evan Fournier, Rudy Gobert, Mathias Lessort, Frank Ntilikina, Matthew Strazel, Victor Wembanyama, Guerschon Yabusele\nGermany: Isaac Bonga, Daniel Theis, Oscar Da Silva, Johannes Thiemann, Johannes Voigtmann, Niels Giffey, Maodo Lo, Franz Wagner, Andreas Obst, Moritz Wagner, Dennis Schroder, Nick Weiler-Babb\nGreece: Kostas Papanikolaou, Nick Calathes, Giannoulis Larentzakis, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Georgios Papagiannis, Konstantinos Mitoglou, Thomas Walkup, Kostas Antetokounmpo, Vassilis Charalampopoulos, Dimitris Moraitis, Panagiotis Kalaitzakis, Vassilis Toliopoulos\n(Photo by Kelly Defina/Getty Images)\nJapan: Yuki Togashi, Akira Jacobs, Yuki Kawamura, Makoto Hiejima, Kai Toews, Rui Hachimura, Yuta Watanabe, Yudai Baba, Josh Hawkinson, Keisei Tominaga, Hugh Watanabe, Yoshii Hirotaka\nPuerto Rico: Arnaldo Toro, Ismael Romero, Chris Ortiz, Stephen Thompson, Tremont Waters, George Conditt IV, Isaiah Piñeiro, José Alvarado, Jordan Howard, Gian Clavell, Aleem Ford, Davon Reed\nSerbia: Aleska Avramovic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Dejan Davidovic, Ognjen Dobric, Marko Guduric, Ognjen Jaramaz, Nikola Jokic, Nikola Jovic, Vladimir Lucic, Vanja Marinkovic, Vasilije Micic, Nikola Milutinov, Filip Petrusev, Uros Plavsic, Aleksej Pokusevski, Dusan Ristic\nSouth Sudan: Junior Madut, Nuni Omot, Carlik Jones, Khaman Maluach, Kuany Kuany, Marial Shayok, Deng Acuoth, Majok Deng, Peter Jok, Koch Bar, Wenyen Gabriel, Sunday Dech.\nSpain: Alex Abrines, Santi Aldama, Dario Brizuela, Lorenzo Brown, Alberto Diaz, Rudy Fernandez, Usman Garuba, Juancho Hernangomez, Willy Hernangomez, Sergio Llull, Xabi Lopez Arostegui, Jaime Pradilla\nUSA: LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Devin Booker, Jayson Tatum, Anthony Davis, Tyrese Haliburton, Anthony Edwards, Jrue Holiday, Bam Adebayo, Derrick White",

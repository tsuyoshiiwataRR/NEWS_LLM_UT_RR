    "text": "HOME OLYMPICS Coach stood down after spying furore; ‘sabotage’ claim in whipping scandal — Olympics Daily Matildas thumped, Men's 7s advance! | 00:54 Fox Sports with AFP from Fox Sports July 26th, 2024 12:28 pm\nCanada defender Vanessa Gilles insisted her team were “not cheats” despite a spying scandal before their 2-1 opening win over New Zealand in the Olympic women’s football competition on Thursday.\nEarlier this week, New Zealand complained to the International Olympic Committee’s integrity unit after claiming drones were flown over the team’s closed practice sessions in Saint-Etienne.\n“Over the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,” Canada Soccer chief executive and general secretary Kevin Blue said in a statement.\nHead coach Bev Priestman has been removed from the country’s Olympic team in response to the drama, with assistant coach Andy Spence leading the Canadian team for the remainder of the Paris Games.\nFellow assistant coach Jasmine Mander and analyst Joey Lombardi were also sent home from the Games in Paris on Wednesday. Lombardi has been given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying a drone over a New Zealand training session in Saint-Etienne in the build-up to the match.\nFIFA has since opened disciplinary proceedings against Canada.\n“Honestly, it wasn’t easy,” Gilles told reporters.\n“There was a lot of emotion, frustration and humiliation because as a player, it doesn’t reflect our values and what we want to represent as competitors at the Olympics.\n“The Games represent fair play. As Canadians, these are not our values or those of our country. We are not cheats. It was very hard but we knew how to be united.”\nCanada are defending their Olympic title in Paris after defeating Sweden to win gold in Tokyo three years ago.\nCanada coach Bev Priestman. Photo by William WEST / AFP Source: AFP\nFRESH ‘SABOTAGE’ CLAIM IN OLYMPIC SCANDAL\nThere are fresh claims British Olympian Charlotte Dujardin was sabotaged on the eve of the Paris Games after footage of her alleged animal abuse went public.\nEarlier this week, the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) suspended Dujardin, the joint most-decorated British female Olympian, after the video was released.\nThe vision, first released by Good Morning Britain , was taken four years ago and showed the 39-year-old beating a horse with a long whip during a training session with a young student.\n“A video has emerged from four years ago which shows me making an error of judgement during a coaching session,” Dujardin said in a statement .\n“Understandably, the International Federation for Equestrian Sports is investigating and I have made the decision to withdraw from all competition — including the Paris Olympics — while this process takes place.\n“What happened was completely out of character and does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils, however there is no excuse. I am deeply ashamed and should have set a better example in that moment.”\nHorse welfare charity Brooke dropped Dujardin as an ambassador, with the London International Horse Show following suit. Meanwhile, two of Dujardin’s sponsors confirmed they had ended their arrangements with her — riding helmets manufacturer Charles Owen and Fairfax Saddles.\nHowever, former dressage correspondent at Horse & Hound magazine Madeline Hall has suggested the three-time gold medallist may have been sabotaged as mystery continues to swirl about the whistleblower’s identity.\n“The timing of this video days before the Olympics smells of sabotage,” Hall told The Daily Mail .\n“To me it is suspect.”\nDujardin was due to compete in both the individual dressage and the team event in Paris. She been replaced in the team by Becky Moody.\nNew tactics backfire on Matildas | 05:20\nNADAL’S FRESH INJURY SETBACK\nRafael Nadal has suffered a thigh injury to put his participation at the Paris Olympics in doubt, his coach Carlos Moya said on Thursday.\nThe 14-time French Open champion is scheduled to play in the singles and in the men’s doubles alongside rising star and fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz at Roland Garros.\n“He had some discomfort yesterday (Wednesday) morning,” Moya told Spanish radio.\n“In the afternoon he was more limited and before it got worse he decided to stop.”\nThe 38-year-old Nadal did not train on Thursday, which Moya said was “the most responsible thing to do”.\n“Don’t force it at the moment and see if he recovers well,” he added.\n“We will see what condition he’s in tomorrow and Saturday.”\nNadal returned to tennis this year after a lengthy absence with a hip injury, reaching his first ATP final since winning the 2022 French Open in Bastad last weekend before losing to Portugal’s Nuno Borges.\nHe is scheduled to face Hungarian Marton Fucsovics in the singles first round on Sunday, the day after partnering Alcaraz in the doubles.\nIf Nadal defeats Fucsovics, he would set up a possible second-round meeting with old rival Novak Djokovic.\n“I can’t guarantee anything, neither that he won’t play or he will play,” said Moya.\n“At the moment he needs to rest, undergo treatment.\n“He is obviously very excited to play these Olympics. It has been something marked on his calendar for years.\n“He is a born competitor and wants to play singles and doubles. He’s very excited about the doubles with Alcaraz. It will be the first time they have played together and it will be something historic for Spanish tennis.”\nNadal is a two-time Olympic champion, having won singles gold in Beijing in 2008, and doubles gold at the 2016 Rio Games alongside Marc Lopez.",

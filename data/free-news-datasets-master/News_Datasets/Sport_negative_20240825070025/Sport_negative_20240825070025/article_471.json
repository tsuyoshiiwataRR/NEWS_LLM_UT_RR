    "text": "Former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Asante Kotoko, Opoku Nti, revealed that he was never a signatory to the club’s account and that his tenure was undermined by individuals who sought to sabotage his success.\nSpeaking on JoySports Prime Take interview with Muftawu Nabila Abdulai, Nti who played for the Porcupine Warriors before rising to serve as CEO shed light on the financial hurdles and internal sabotage he faced while managing the club.\nFirst part of Prime Take with Opoku Nti will air on Friday on the AM Show “One thing that also happened was that I was not a signatory to Kotoko cheques and I’m really happy about that,” he said on the interview that will air this weekend on JoyNews.\nDuring his tenure, Opoku Nti faced accusations of financial mismanagement, including claims that he used club funds to build a hotel for himself.\n“The person who accused me of using Kotoko money to build a hotel, the same person came and begged me about that thing they did. People are mischievous. People will pay money to sabotage people; it’s always there,” he said.\nPrime Take with Opoku Nti will broadcast on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. “The Board Chairman was the signatory; the disbursement of the money and everything was handled by him. My job was just to bring money to finance our activities, but how it was disbursed, I didn’t sign it.\n“It was good for me because no one will say that Opoku Nti squandered Kotoko’s money,” Nti said.\nThere is a perception within Asante Kotoko, including among the media, that certain individuals benefit from the instability of the club’s leadership. Nti claims he experienced the same.\n“People sabotaged me at Kotoko, but I don’t know what their interest was because it has all been behind closed doors like this. I don’t want to go back to even our time, what happened, but it has been there.”\nPrime Take airs every Friday at 7:30 am, Saturday at 7:30 pm, and Sunday at 11 am on JoyNews.",

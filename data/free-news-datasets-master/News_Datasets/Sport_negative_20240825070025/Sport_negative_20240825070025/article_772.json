Then, referees ruled that Argentina had been offside on the goal and it was disallowed. After another three minutes of added time following the long delay, Morocco claimed a 2-1 victory.\nArgentina’s soccer federation said it issued a formal protest to world governing body FIFA to “take the necessary regulatory measures for such a serious event.”\n“Paris 2024 is working with the relevant stakeholders to understand the causes and identify appropriate actions,” a spokesperson for Paris organizers said.\nBefore Wednesday’s match, Argentina men’s soccer coach Javier Mascherano said the team’s Olympic training base was robbed.\n“They went into training and they robbed us, in the Olympic Games,” Mascherano said. “We didn’t want to say anything after training, I don’t think it helps anything. But obviously it’s a bit disagreeable that these kinds of things happen.”\nMascherano said midfielder Thiago Almada’s watch was among the items taken.\nMeanwhile, there is no Olympic event for drag queens, but that didn’t stop the Paris organizers from recruiting one to carry the Olympic torch.\nWhy would anyone watch the woke Paris Olympics.\nPassing of the torch is ruined by gender politics. pic.twitter.com/Xc79lpbBWH\n— Citizen Free Press (@CitizenFreePres) July 25, 2024\nUrgent : Support Free Press Foundation",

    "text": "By Jeremy Hanna ,\n31 minutes ago\nDespite having a Hall of Fame-worthy career, a Green Bay Packers legend has plummeted in a recent ranking of the best players in the National Football League.\nAaron Rodgers is arguably the greatest Packers quarterback of all time and one of the best in the history of the NFL. However, this didn't stop him from leaving Green Bay and heading to the New York Jets.\nUnfortunately, his debut season with the new team ended after he was injured in the first game. This has caused his ranking in NFL.com's list of the Top 100 Players of 2024 to drop severely from last year.\n\"Rodgers took a major descent in this yearâ€™s rankings after a torn Achilles limited his debut season with the Jets to just four snaps,\" Krissy Hetherington said. \"But the future Hall of Famer remains one of the most decorated quarterbacks in the league with four MVPs, 10 Pro Bowl honors and four All-Pro nods in addition to his one Super Bowl title.\"\nThis marks the second year in a row that Rodgers faced a significant drop in these rankings. Ranked third overall in 2022, Rodgers' final season with the Packers wasn't quite up to his MVP standards, causing him to drop 48 places to 51st overall in 2023.\nThis particularly stings because the ranking isn't decided by analysts or experts, but by fellow NFL players . On the bright side, Rodgers didn't have the largest fall from grace. That \"honor\" belongs to free safety Minkah Fitzpatrick of the Pittsburgh Steelers, who dropped 61 places.\nRodgers hasn't gotten the chance to prove himself in New York. 2024 will be the perfect time for him to show that he still has plenty left in the tank after almost 20 years in the NFL.\nMore NFL: Green Bay Packers fans will love USA Today's prediction for 2024 season\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

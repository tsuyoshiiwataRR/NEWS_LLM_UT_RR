    "text": "The Australian Opals have been dealt a massive blow on the eve of the Paris Olympics, with veteran and WNBA star Bec Allen ruled out of the competition due to injury. Allen, who currently plays for the Phoenix Mercury, was set to be a crucial part of Australia's medal chances, but she will now miss the entire tournament after aggravating a hamstring injury during the Opals final warm-up game against Canada. With Allen out, WNBL player Amy Atwell has been elevated to the team, as the Opals try to avenge a poor performance at the Tokyo Olympics. MORE OLYMPICS COVERAGE: What events are at the Olympics tonight? | Australia's gold, silver, bronze medal count at Paris 2024 | How much are Australian Olympians paid? Rebecca Allen misses Paris Olympics with injury Expected to be one of the Opals key players in Paris, Bec Allen's Olympic dream is over before it even started, with Basketball Australia announcing she would miss the tournament with a high-grade hamstring injury. Allen confirmed this news via X, formerly Twitter, posting that she was \"shattered\" to miss the Games. Shattered ðŸ’”â€” Rebecca Allen (@becallen8) [July 25, 2024] This news is especially brutal for Allen, who missed the majority of the 2022 FIBA Basketball World Cup in Sydney after suffering a partially collapsed lung and two broken ribs, meaning the Olympics is the second straight major tournament she will miss for the Opals. Allen's replacement will be Amy Atwell, the Perth Lynx guard set to make her Olympic debut for Australia. \"Bec is such a big part of our team and has been for a long time, we are all devastated for her,\" Opals coach Sandy Brondello said via a statement . \"This injury has come at a really unfortunate time and the call had to be made upon medical advice. \"Unfortunately, she was not going to recover in time to play in these Games. \"Amy Atwell has been part of this Olympic squad all year and with us in Spain for our practice matches. She will now come into the team and all the staff and players have every confidence in Amy. \"This group has a really strong bond and connection and we will lock in, stay focused and continue our preparation for game one against Nigeria.\" The Opals will begin their Olympic campaign on Monday, July 29, when they take on Nigeria at 7:00 pm AEST.

    "text": "You’d be forgiven for thinking Dustin Martin himself was the 18th-ranked team in the AFL, rather than the Richmond Football Club.\nNo player is bigger than the club. That’s what the media has always said as a criticism towards Dustin Martin, yet the irony is it is them, not the player, who has tried to make it happen, particularly in 2024.\nInstead of focusing on the encouraging signs of Richmond’s current youth, or the prospect of having an embarrassment of riches come draft time in November to accelerate the rebuild, the infatuation with the Tiger legend has entered a whole new stratosphere.\nThe media vibe is almost begging Martin to retire and if they claim otherwise, then which way do you think the player himself would lean if he was on the fence about it come season’s end?\nEarlier this season, we discussed the fact that the Tigers need to embrace the notion of a rebuild . They’ve certainly headed down that path.\nThey’ve still played some pretty decent footy overall but importantly, it’s been aided by the development, or at the very least some nice signs, shown by younger players. It hasn’t been perfect and the persistence with some guys with high potential who mightn’t be ready hasn’t been consistent, but we’ve seen a lot of encouraging signs by a team who’s having a crack.\nThey’re currently last and if they don’t win the wooden spoon, which they should, they won’t escape the bottom two.\nYet the narrative around the Tigers hasn’t analysed Hugo Ralphsmith’s positive development on the wing, Seth Campbell’s clear path to being a 200-game player in the AFL or Rhyan Mansell’s unexpected but delightful development as a mature-ager on his last chance potentially.\nDustin Martin’s one of the greatest players to ever play the game. His CV speaks for itself, his accomplishments are unmatched by most in history and hero status extends beyond the yellow and black.\nMaybe it’s because people don’t want to talk about or break down the worst team in the league. Maybe it’s simply the sickness that seems to have plagued AFL media.\nWe just love to turn on our own, don’t we?\nSports opinion delivered daily\nOf course, it’s not “we” as in you or I. But it’s the notion that all of footy’s stakeholders celebrate the achievements of players just as quickly they’ll hone in on and attack anything with a tinge of negativity they can find, or even better, pile on once it’s been found for them.\nMartin’s not had the best season, but he hasn’t been asked to do that much more on-field than what he’s provided.\nAt no point has Yze put the 33-year-old in a position where he has to carry the team on his back.\nSure, the triple-premiership premiership player, the triple Norm Smith Medalist, the Brownlow Medalist, has naturally shown some signs in 2024 and given his team some temporary boosts in games with flashes of brilliance, but his impact isn’t about what he does with the footy.\nYoung players look up to Martin. His teammates look at their iconic teammate and are inspired by him. Yes, there’s an aura, but there’s also a style of leadership he always had, where his actions alone help develop young players.\nWe’ve seen less of Martin in recent times – due to injury, yes, but also simply due to the typical witch-hunt that grinds the legends of our game into the ground.\nMartin celebrates kicking a goal. (Photo by Quinn Rooney/Getty Images)\nDusty got to play his 300th game at the MCG, as he rightfully should have. Except it never quite felt like a celebration in the traditional sense – sure, on the actual day it was magical and emotional, but everything surrounding it was anything but.\nHe has played half a game since then with back issues. He hasn’t been around the club, trying to escape that spotlight that has shone brightly upon him his whole career.\nThe headlines have graduated throughout the season.\nAt first, it was whether or not he was going to move to the Suns. Then, there was a question on if he’d continue to play. There was the controversy around his 300th. The media has queried if he has actually been injured. Now, it’s the fact Yze is “too soft” on him and that he has checked out of it all.\nThat very last point could well be true as we sit at this moment in time, but you have to wonder whether the media understands their role as an accelerant in all this, rather than blaming the coach and club.\nRather than looking at the excellent fortnight Steely Green has had in the AFL, Sam Banks’ positive signs as an aggressive wing or even discussing the rollercoaster form of Liam Baker recently as he makes his decision between West Coast and Richmond, and the subsequent draft hand it could leave the Tigers with, the continued focus remains on a player that has barely played an hour’s worth of footy in six weeks for a multitude of reasons, none less focused upon than the coverage of his absence.\nMore AFL Carlton Blues vs Port Adelaide Power: AFL live scores, blog AFL News: McKay OUT in last-minute Blue blow, Mitchell keeping lid on red-hot Hawks 'No player is bigger than the club': The irony in media's Dustin Martin witch-hunt The crucial cogs of AFL's Round 20: Which players need to be the difference-makers? AFL News: Blues warned for McKay head knock breach, star Giant reprimanded for 'ruining the game' Tribunal rant AFL But that’s how it works in our game in this day and age. The lack of accountability in certain reporting or the coverage of parts of the game mean this attempt to cause another AFL legend’s almost ignominious retreat into retirement will be swept aside and moved on from just as easily and quickly as any standard, incorrect reporting of player movement or discontent in other forums.\nAnd then when that’s accomplished, what happens? Is there a hope that the non-existent dark cloud over the Tigers is lifted, and then focusing on the number of young draftees recruited in November brings positive coverage for the team? Or what if Martin chose to play on?\nHowever unlikely that seems at this stage, that spotlight won’t stop until it’s the media get the right angle on their magnifying glass from the sun on Martin’s career, like a primary school child focusing on ants in the schoolyard.\nAnother soured retirement will eventually be on the cards.\nIt’s a pity for the Dustin Martin Tigers, who despite languishing at the bottom of the ladder, have at least created some positivity through style of play and increased opportunities for youth.\nThey’re in the formative stages of a rebuild, perhaps not even having fully commenced it yet with a lot of player status changes anticipated, but they’re one of the stronger one-on-one teams in the league and while the identity is still being created, they’re trying to use undercut runs and handball receives to generate momentum and get the ball forward.\nCarlton Blues v Port Adelaide Power 1.62 2.35 AFL : Head To Head Fri, 26 Jul 2024, 19:42 North Melbourne Kangaroos v Geelong Cats 3.90 1.26 AFL : Head To Head Sat, 27 Jul 2024, 13:45 Gold Coast Suns v Brisbane Lions 2.15 1.70 AFL : Head To Head Sat, 27 Jul 2024, 16:35 St Kilda Saints v Essendon Bombers 2.20 1.68 AFL : Head To Head Sat, 27 Jul 2024, 16:36 Melbourne Demons v Greater Western Sydney Giants 1.85 1.95 AFL : Head To Head Sat, 27 Jul 2024, 19:30 Fremantle Dockers v West Coast Eagles 1.10 7.00 AFL : Head To Head Sat, 27 Jul 2024, 20:10 Collingwood Magpies v Richmond Tigers 1.22 4.30 AFL : Head To Head Sun, 28 Jul 2024, 13:10 Sydney Swans v Western Bulldogs 1.50 2.60 AFL : Head To Head Sun, 28 Jul 2024, 15:20 Adelaide Crows v Hawthorn Hawks 2.05 1.77 AFL : Head To Head Sun, 28 Jul 2024, 16:10 * Odds Correct At Time Of Posting.

How ironic, for the media’s Dustin Martin Tigers.",

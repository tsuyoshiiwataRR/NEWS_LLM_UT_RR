    "text": "The [Los Angeles Rams](https://www.turfshowtimes.com/) were dealt a tough blow after [cornerback Derion Kendrick reportedly tore his ACL](https://www.turfshowtimes.com/2024/7/25/24205941/rams-cb-injuries-derion-kendrick-tre-white). LA’s secondary was already stretched thin entering training camp and Kendrick likely being lost for the year further puts the unit in a bind. While the news is undoubtedly painful for the Rams, Les Snead must make the right move by reuniting with Ahkello Witherspoon. I pray Derion Kendrick did not tear his ACL…Just an awful awful injury and really unfortunate if so. With that said this would be a significant loss.— JAKE ELLENBOGEN (@JKBOGEN) [#Rams]need depth. Felt Ahkello Witherspoon was needed back on the roster before this. Now? Get him back PRONTO! [July 25, 2024] To echo the words of TST’s own Jake Ellenbogen — GET WITHERSPOON BACK PRONTO! The eight-year veteran was an underrated addition for Los Angeles after coming over from the [Steelers](https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/). Witherspoon recorded career highs in combined tackles (52), passes defensed (14), interceptions (3) and fumbles recovered (2) [in 17 regular season starts](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WithAh00.htm). He realistically could have been a [Pro Bowl](http://www.sbnation.com/nfl-pro-bowl) alternate during his lone season in Hollywood. The Colorado product played lights out for a Rams team that needed a spark in the secondary. Now, Witherspoon might be called upon again on short notice to hold down the fort with Kendrick sidelined. Bringing him back is really the only right answer to this problem. There will be plenty of name dropping until Snead can find a suitable replacement. One big-name free agent who could be a solution is [Super Bowl](https://www.sbnation.com/super-bowl) champ and 2019 Defensive Player of the Year, Stephon Gilmore. Despite closing in on his mid-30s, Gilmore has remained quite productive at his age. Including the postseason, Gilmore has started 34 games [since the start of the 2022 campaign](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GilmSt00.htm) and snagged two interceptions in back-to-back years with the Colts and Cowboys. The vet got absolutely cooked against the [Packers](https://www.acmepackingcompany.com/) in last year’s playoffs, which could amount to being a victim of the Cowboys’ postseason curse. Another option much closer to home is Tre Tomlinson [who played just 5% of the defensive snaps](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HodgTr00.htm) in his rookie campaign. An in-house option like Tomlinson might be an attraction option, yet a risky one at that if the second-year defender isn’t up to the task. Better to be safe than sorry when it comes to the secondary. Signing an All-Pro talent off the open market has got to be tempting for Snead, but the only logical move is for LA to reunite with Ahkello Witherspoon. Someone with knowledge of the system is invaluable and it could be argued that the Rams should have never let him slip away to begin with.",

    "title": "Canada Women's Soccer Coach Suspended from Olympics for 'Drone Use'",
    "text": "The coach for Canada ‚Äòs Olympic women‚Äôs soccer team has been suspended over alleged drone use to spy on opponents. On Thursday, the Canadian Olympic Committee announced that Bev Priestman will no longer lead the team at the games , following a FIFA and IOC investigation that tied her to drone use ‚Äúpredating‚Äù the Olympics .\n‚ÄúOver the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,‚Äù read a statement from Canada Soccer CEO Kevin Blue. ‚ÄúIn light of these new revelations, Canada Soccer has made the decision to suspend Women‚Äôs National Team Head Coach, Bev Priestman, for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.‚Äù\nPriestman‚Äôs suspension will last until the completion of an independent investigation from Canada‚Äôs soccer governing board, Blue explained. Assistant coach Andy Spence will take on interim coaching duties for the remainder of the games.\nCanada WNT Head Coach Bev Priestman has been sent home from the 2024 Olympics, COC announced üá®üá¶ pic.twitter.com/jkXURVrtqT\n‚Äî FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) July 25, 2024 The decision to remove Priestman comes days after a non-accredited member of the Canada Soccer team was detained detained by French authorities following an incident in Saint-√âtienne. The discovery of the drone usage led to the removal of two staff members from the team. On Wednesday, Priestman denied her involvement in the incident.\nCanadian Olympic Committee (COC) said a ‚Äúnon-accredited member of the Canada Soccer support team‚Äù had been detained by French authorities in Saint-√âtienne, a city 250 miles south of Paris, for improperly using a drone.\n‚ÄúIrrespective of the details, I‚Äôm ultimately accountable for this team,‚Äù the coach said following a team practice, per The Guardian . ‚ÄúBy no means did I direct the individuals.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm still learning the details and obviously this is all unfolding,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúBut again, I think the important thing right now is to look forward, put the actions in place and take the sanctions.‚Äù\nThe COC had released a statement Wednesday that Joseph Lombardi, an unaccredited analyst with Canada Soccer, and Jasmine Mander, an assistant coach to whom Lombardi allegedly reported, were ‚Äúsent home immediately.‚Äù Trending Elon Musk's Daughter Fires Back After He Says She Was 'Killed' By 'Woke Mind Virus' So ...

With Some Help From Beyonc√©\nTeam Canada had been notified of two separate drone incidents: one on July 22 in Saint-√âtienne, and another on July 19 at New Zealand‚Äôs practice. Canada defeated New Zealand 2-1 on Thursday during the team‚Äôs Paris Olympic debut, although Priestman was not at the game.\nCanada is next set to play France, the Games‚Äô host, on July 28 as part of the competition‚Äôs Group A, which also includes New Zealand and Colombia. Canada is the reigning gold medal winners.",

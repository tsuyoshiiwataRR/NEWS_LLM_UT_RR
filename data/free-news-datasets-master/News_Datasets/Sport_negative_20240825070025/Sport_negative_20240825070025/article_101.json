    "text": "[Tennessee Titans](https://www.musiccitymiracles.com/) head coach Brian Callahan said today that CB Chidobe Awuzie will miss a couple of weeks with a calf strain. This will be the last time I say this, but it is so refreshing to get an honest answer on a player’s injury during training camp. Mike Vrabel would not have even confirmed what type of injury Awuzie had much less how much time he would miss. Callahan also said he wants injured players to be around the practice after getting treatment each day: A significant change for what injured players will do under Brian Callahan.— Paul Kuharsky (@PaulKuharskyNFL) [#Titans] [pic.twitter.com/8NdpuY5Psv] [July 25, 2024] Under Vrabel, injured guys went into the witness protection program. Once they were injured no one saw them again until they returned to the practice field. OK, enough of that. It does suck that Chido will miss a couple of weeks with the new install of the Titans’ defense, but he is a veteran, so it shouldn’t hurt him that much when week 1 comes around (assuming he just missed the two weeks or so).",

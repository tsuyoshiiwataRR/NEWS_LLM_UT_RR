    "text": "- Analysis [Sport](https://wwos.nine.com.au) Player ratings: 'Ineffective' World Cup hero goes unnoticed amid Matildas nightmare The [Matildas](https://www.nine.com.au/topic/matildas-jfe) began their [Olympics](https://www.nine.com.au/sport/olympics) campaign in the worst possible way - a [nightmare 3-0 loss at the hands of Germany](https://www.nine.com.au/sport/olympics/paris-2024-australia-matildas-v-germany-result-video-highlights-20240726-p5jwpw.html). It leaves Australia's favourite team in danger of being bundled out early, never mind missing the chance to win a medal in Paris. And the loss highlighted some worrying weaknesses for coach Tony Gustavsson.

Mackenzie Arnold (5.5) A disappointing night for Australia's No.1 as she was unable to celebrate her 50th cap with a clean sheet. In truth she could do little to prevent the German goals and was relatively solid throughout the contest. Cortnee Vine (4) Largely unnoticed during her nearly hour on, started centrally but was ineffective in Australia's attack as she struggled to threaten the German defence. Steph Catley (6.5) Another solid display by the Matildas captain as she attempted to spark Australia's attack from out wide. Was diligent in her defensive duties against a mobile German attack.

Caitlin Foord (6) Looked dangerous early on as she looked to dribble and run at the German defence. Her effectiveness though wore off as the game progressed as she was left isolated against a disciplined and well organised German team. Alanna Kennedy (5) Was partly at fault for Germany's first goal where she allowed Marina Hegering to rise above her and power a header into the net. Struggled to contain a rampant German attack in the second half as Australia's defence was cut apart. Clare Hunt (5) A usually composed figure at the back, Hunt was left scrambling to contain a fluent German attack. Was caught in possession at times and alongside central half partner Kennedy was unable to stop the multiple German attacking threats. Hayley Raso (4.5) Like much of Australia's attack struggled to involve herself and was rarely able to turn and run at the German defence. Katrina Gorry (6.5) Typical tireless display as she tracked back on numerous occasions to help defensively. Struggled to maintain possession at times but can hold her head high after an injury plagued season. Ellie Carpenter (5) Was her usual hard running self out wide, as she looked to push forward when she was able to. Was caught out defensively on occasions and was left exposed for Germany's third goal. Kyra Cooney-Cross (5.5) Provided neat passing in midfield as she looked to try and wrestle back momentum for the Matildas. Was unable to involve herself in Australia's attack as much as she would have liked as the link between the midfield and attack was largely non-existent. Mary Fowler (5) A disappointing display by one of the most exciting talents in the women's game as she struggled to involve herself in a match which largely passed her by. If the Matildas are to progress from the group stage, they will need to find a way to utilise the undoubted talents of Fowler. Subs: Michelle Heyman (3) Came on for Foord but was unable to show much in a contest which was dominated by a rampant German team. Kaitlyn Torpey (3) Was brought on for Catley but struggled for any effective touches in her short cameo. Clare Wheeler (4) Was injected into the game to try and give the Matilda's a second half lift. This though did not conspire as she was unable to help turn the momentum in Australia's favour. Sharn Freier (4) Looked to involve herself in Australia's attack, as she tried to help ignite a stagnant and flat Australian forward line. Provided some fleeting moments but like many of her teammates was unable to breach a solid German defence.",

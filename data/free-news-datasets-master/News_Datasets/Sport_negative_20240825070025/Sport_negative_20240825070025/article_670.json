    "text": "The Red Sox went 1-5 on their most recent road trip after being swept by the Dodgers and dropping two of three to the Rockies. The club had Thursday off and will begin a three-game set against the Yankees starting Friday.\nHere are some observations from the two series out of the break:\n▪ Manager Alex Cora inked a new three-year deal Wednesday and before the ink could even dry up, his club had already suffered a 20-7 beatdown at the hands of Colorado.\nIt happens.\nBut in that series, or game, it was clear where the Sox needed to see some improvements: infield defense. Cora always says that when he played he always hated hitting. It was a grind for him, whereas the defensive side came easy. He was a sure-handed infielder who didn’t have any trouble turning the double play. So, one could imagine that the Sox manager might need a little Advil after watching his team’s infield defense from time to time.\nGet Sports Headlines The Globe's most recent sports headlines delivered to your inbox every morning. Enter Email Sign Up The Rockies, despite constantly scraping the bottom of the barrel in the majors, have one of the better defenses in baseball. The way their players moved in the infield, got to balls, and turned and finished double plays was done at an elite level. The numbers back it up. The Rockies are tied for having the seventh-fewest errors in the majors with 49. They are tied for first in double plays turned, anchored by Ezequiel Tovar at second.\nAdvertisement\nOn the contrary, the Sox have made 74 errors, the most in baseball. They are ranked 21st in the majors with just 21 double plays turned. Ceddanne Rafaela has helped to stabilize shortstop and the infield. But when he plays center field, that’s when things seem to become a bit erratic for the Sox defenders in the dirt.\nIn fairness, the Rockies have always had one of the best defenses in baseball. Considering how tough it is for pitchers to pitch there because of the altitude, a sturdy defense is almost a requirement.\nThe Red Sox still have playoff hopes. While stellar defense isn’t mandatory, maintaining solid defensive play is essential.\n▪ It’s tough to judge the Sox’ pitching on just one road trip which included close to a week-long break before resuming action last Friday against the Dodgers, and then visiting a stadium in Coors FIeld that is death row for pitchers.\nAdvertisement\nNevertheless, the numbers are what they are.\nStarters succumbed to a 5.51 ERA, yielding nine homers. Sox starters haven’t offered many free passes, allowing just six in that span.\n▪ The loss of Justin Slaten and Chris Martin has left a gaping hole in the Sox’ bullpen. The Sox have had to patch together the back part of the bullpen in his absence.\nThe bullpen struggled for the first four contests. But, perhaps, the Sox can be optimistic about Greg Weissert , who has tussled to find his footing, last two appearances, going two innings (one in each) in scoreless fashion.\nThe Sox made some adjustments to Weissert’s hands. Initially when he came set, Weissert’s hands were down by his right hip. When he would get into his leg lift, his glove would come up near his ear. The Sox have since modified that latter move. Now, when he gets into his leg lift his glove/hands don’t go any higher than his chest with the hope that it could help him become more consistent in the strike zone.\n“I think he eliminates a lot of stuff,” said Cora. “It’s more simple. Fastball command has been great. [ Jason Varitek ] made a point after the first game at Coors Field, like, finally, he’s been able to get the four-seamer up which is a very good pitch for him.”\n▪ The Sox will continue to hit, led by Jarren Duran and Rafael Devers . They are young , so expect the streakiness.\nAdvertisement",

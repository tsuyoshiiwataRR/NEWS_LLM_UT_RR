    "text": "MIAMI GARDENS — Tua Tagovailoa's workload dropped from a couple of handoffs on Wednesday to total spectator on Thursday. Tagovailoa, hoping to reach agreement with the Miami Dolphins on a contract extension, spent the second practice day of training camp in a No. 1 jersey but without his helmet. He did not take part in either individual or team drills. More: Miami Dolphins' Jalen Ramsey challenges Anthony Weaver to make him ‘chess piece' Tagovailoa is staging a \"hold in,\" which is similar to a holdout except he reported to camp and often works on a limited basis. Or, to be more accurate, he was working on a limited basis until Thursday. The reason he didn't practice Thursday wasn't immediately known because coach Mike McDaniel won't address the media again until Friday. Most likely, it was contract-related. Although much less likely, it's also possible he has a minor injury. At any rate, Tagovailoa joined teammates on the practice field in his traditional red, noncontact No. 1 jersey, but with a baseball cap. He chatted with QB coach Darrell Bevell. Not having Tagovailoa meant more opportunities for the other QBs in camp: Mike White, Skylar Thompson and Gavin Hardison. Dolphins reporter Hal Habib can be reached at hhabib@pbpost.com .

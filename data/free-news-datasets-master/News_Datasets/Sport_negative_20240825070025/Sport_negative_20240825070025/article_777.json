    "text": "- 5 hours ago\nBarcelona PANIC over Nico Williams transfer\nBarcelona are reportedly panicking over Paris Saint-Germain's pursuit of Nico Williams.\nWilliams has been one of Barcelona's transfer targets for a while now and his performances at Euro 2024 only heightened their interest.\nThe finances of the deal have always been an issue but it was expected that the Blaugrana would find a way eventually.\nREAD MORE:\nLatest Barcelona transfer rumours\nHowever, Paris Saint-German have recently entered the race to sign the 22-year-old.\nAnd, money has not been an issue for PSG for well over a decade, giving Barcelona cause for concern.\nIndeed, Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo are reporting that Hansi Flick's side see the Ligue 1 champions as a 'serious threat'.\nPSG could easily outbid Barca and offer significantly higher wages, so Barca will be hoping that they look elsewhere.\nThe Parisian outfit are also interested in Rennes'\nDesire Doue.\nHow Barcelona would line up with Nico Williams\nMarc-Andre ter Stegen isn’t fancied by some sections of Barcelona fans, but he remains the club’s number one and he will not be replaced this summer.\nJules Kounde will have to settle for a regular right-back role, despite preferring to play at centre-back, with Ronald Araujo partnering the talented La Masia graduate Pau Cubarsi at the heart of the defence.\nBarça's new kit for the 24/25 season.\nInspired by the Club's legacy, trajectory, and roots.\n[pic.twitter.com/fqy7UhZMH2]\n— FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona)\n[July 18, 2024]\nJoao Cancelo has returned to Manchester City following his loan spell at Barca, meaning Alejandro Balde will likely resume first-choice left-back duties.\nBarcelona are yet to sign a long-term Sergio Busquets heir, but Frenkie de Jong is set to continue in a deep-lying role, alongside Spanish duo Gavi and Pedri. Ilkay Gundogan will pick up consistent minutes too, but Gavi and Pedri will be almost guaranteed starters when fully fit.\nRobert Lewandowski will lead the line, despite his declining form, while Lamine Yamal and Williams will provide pace and creativity on the flanks.\nBarcelona’s starting XI with Nico Williams\nGK: Marc-Andre ter Stegen\nRB: Jules Kounde\nCB: Ronald Araujo\nCB: Pau Cubarsi\nLB: Alejandro Balde\nCDM: Frenkie de Jong\nCM: Gavi\nCM: Pedri\nRW: Lamine Yamal\nST: Robert Lewandowski\nLW: Nico Williams\nLa Liga, Ligue 1, Barcelona, PSG, Desire Doué, Nico Williams",

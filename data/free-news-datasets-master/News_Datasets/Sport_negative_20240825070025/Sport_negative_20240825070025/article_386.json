    "text": "Rafael Nadal: Spaniard suffers 'setback' in 2024 Paris Olympic Games preparations, says coach - 'We have to wait' Rafael Nadal did not train on Thursday as he was forced to skip the session with what is reported to be discomfort in his right thigh. His coach Carlos Moya did not rule the Spaniard out of the Paris Olympic Games but admitted \"we are going to give ourselves 48 hours\". Nadal is due to play Hungary's Marton Fucsovics on either Saturday, July 27 or Sunday, July 28 in the singles first round. Rafael Nadal has suffered a “setback” in his preparations for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, according to his coach. Carlos Moya confirmed the 22-time Grand Slam winner did not train on Thursday and insisted “we are going to give ourselves 48 hours”. “It has been a setback and we have decided that Rafa should rest today and not train to recover,” Moya told Onda Cero and Radio Nacional de Espana . “We are going to give ourselves 48 hours. I can't say anything for sure. We have to wait.” It has been reported in Spanish media that Nadal has suffered discomfort in his right thigh. The news casts doubts on his ability to make the opening round of the singles tournament, where he is scheduled to meet Hungary's Marton Fucsovics on either Saturday, July 27 or Sunday, July 28. The winner could potentially meet Novak Djokovic in the second round . Nadal is also scheduled to play in the men’s doubles for Spain alongside Carlos Alcaraz, with Argentina's Gonzalez Maximo and Molteni Andres lying in wait in the first round. Nadal, who last week reached the final of the Swedish Open where he lost to Nuno Borges, admitted he had not been “happy” with his level . He missed the vast majority of 2023 with a hip injury and has battled a muscle tear and fitness issues this year, skipping Wimbledon to prioritise the Olympic Games, which will take place at Roland-Garros. After undergoing surgery last year, Nadal has suggested that this will be his final season on tour - but he has not closed the door on returning in 2025. - - - discovery+ is the streaming home of the Olympic Games, and the only place you can watch every moment of Paris 2024 this summer Related Topics Share this article Advertisement Advertisement",

While celebrations are often part of the MLB, time, score, and occasion often matter.\nIn the case of Siri, the Rays were already down 5-0 when his HR lifted up the team record to 5-1. Despite that, the Rays failed to climb back up, going home with a 9-1 loss against the\nNY Yankees. Yanks team captain Aaron Judge was visibly upset about Siri taking his sweet time across the field, as captured by Yes Network.\nMonday marked Siri’s 14th HR of the season in the fifth inning. Other than taking his time on the run, he also mocked the Yankees fans by ‘chirping’ hand gestures, which further irked the crowd and the Yankees team.\nDuring the game, Michael Kay blasted Jose Siri, saying he should’ve done it if the team was winning. It was not an appropriate time to mock and celebrate his home run, as per him.\nYou’re losing! Celebrate when you’re winning. They’re acting like it’s Mardi Gras in that dugout. You’re losing the game!Michael Kay as per X.\nMichael Kay wasn't a fan of Jose Siri's home run celebration.— Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing)\n\"You're losing…I mean, they're acting like it's Mardi Gras in that dugout. You're losing the game!\"\n[pic.twitter.com/qKkvkXnwQv] [July 22, 2024]\nYankees manager\nAaron Boone also did not see favorably to the action as he commented,\nIt’s a new world. I look away sometimes…It’s on us, each individuals, to handle themselves how they want.Aaron Boone as per X.\nAaron Judge was staring down Jose Siri after his keep talking celebration— Talkin' Yanks (@TalkinYanks)\n[pic.twitter.com/B87hkRWCYn] [July 22, 2024]\nFurthermore, during ESPN’s ‘First Take’ appearance, Chris Russo ripped the 29-year-old saying how they were losing the game, but the outfielder still took his time to indulge into the celebration. “I mean this is absolutely ridiculous!” he said.\nYankees players Aaron Judge and Juan Soto reacts to Jose Siri’s HR\nNew York Yankees captain Aaron Judge and\nJuan Soto also had varied reactions to Tampa Bay Rays Jose Siri’s HR celebration. Judge seemed to stare down his opponent all the way throughout his run on the field without blinking even once. In contrast, Soto took the approach of taunting his opponent on the field.\nSoto recorded the slowest home run of the competition this year so far,\nas per Marca, to outdo Siri’s slow trot performance. Although he said it was due to the hot weather and he wanted to avoid injuries, the fans seemed to have taken it in another way.\nI don’t know what (Jose Siri) was doing, actually. I just don’t know. For me, I just – you know, hot weather. Tough day. I tried to save the hammies and make sure I go nice and easy.Juan Soto as per Sam of Marca.\n\"I don't know what he was doing. For me, hot weather, tough day, try to save the hammies\" – Juan Soto on his home run trot in possible response to Jose Siri— Yankees Videos (@snyyankees)\nSoto adds: \"From this side, we always come out, play hard, and respect our teammates and the other teams too.\"\n[pic.twitter.com/L8kIVD0sVO] [July 22, 2024]\nRusso too went off on ‘First Take’ adding, “This is mind-boggling!” questioning how he even thought of celebrating when “they’re losing 5-0 at the time for crying out loud!” On the other hand, many supported Jose Siri saying baseball is a game to have fun, seeing no problem with his celebration.\nIn case you missed:",

The stadium, despite some damage to some party tents, weathered the high winds pretty well. Our biggest concern right now is getting full power back on to the stadium and those without in the community.\"\nThe Missoula PaddleHeads organization is incredibly thankful for your continued support and is keeping all families affected by yesterday's storm in our thoughts during this challenging time. We would also like to thank all of our emergency responders for their hard work during this difficult 24 hours.\nThe Missoula PaddleHeads have made the following changes to this weekend's schedule to ensure the safety and enjoyment of our fans:\nThursday: There will be no game tonight due to lack of full power in the ballpark.\nFriday: PaddleHeads vs. Mustangs - 7:05pm - The game will proceed as scheduled with Wizards and Wands night. However, please note that the post-game fireworks show has been rescheduled to September 6th.\nSaturday: PaddleHeads vs. Mustangs - 5:00pm - Completion of yesterday's suspended game. The regularly scheduled game will then begin after a 30-minute break. Fans can participate in trivia night and compete to become the best trivia team in all of Missoula.\nSunday: PaddleHeads vs. Mustangs - 2:05pm - Doubleheader to make up tonight's game and play our regular scheduled game on Sunday.

    "text": "CHARLOTTE Dujardin's mentor 'universally condemned' the Team GB Olympian after shocking footage emerged of her whipping a horse 25 times.\nCarl Hester supported action taken against the six-time Olympic medallist, including a\nprovisional six-month ban and strip of funding amid the disturbing video clip.\nThe three-time British Olympic champion sensationally\npulled out of Paris 2024 in disgrace this week after a whistleblower leaked the concerning clip filmed four years ago. Dujardin said she was “deeply ashamed” by her “error of judgement” in a coaching session at a private stable.\nHester, who is set to compete at the Olympics in the team Dujardin was axed from, has since signed a letter condemning her actions.\nA statement from the International Dressage Riders Club (IDRC) read: \"The IDRC universally condemn the actions of Charlotte Dujardin as seen in the video footage.\n\"The Board members are resolute that equine welfare must always be placed uppermost and at all times.\n\"The IDRC Board supports the actions taken by the FEI, the British Equestrian Federation and British Dressage to provisionally suspend Ms Dujardin.\"\nIt comes after Dujardin was dropped by one of her main sponsors in light of the disturbing video.\nCharles Owen, a company that sells safety equipment for horse riders, revealed they were chopping their working relationship with the shamed equestrian.\nMost read in Sport\nDave Derby, chief executive of riding helmets manufacturer Charles Owen, said: \"'Charles Owen and Miss Dujardin have had a successful partnership for many years, but while we understand the sentiment of her public statement, we have decided to terminate our sponsorship agreement with Miss Dujardin with immediate effect.\"\nMeanwhile, fellow sponsor, Fairfax Saddles said on Facebook: \"We are shocked and saddened by the video depicting one of the well-know users of our products, Charlotte Dujardin.\n'Welfare of the house is of paramount importance at Fairfax Saddles, and we do not condone this kind of behaviour.\n\"As a result, we are withdrawing our association with her with immediate effect, but will manage the wind-down of our technical support in a way that does not prejudice the interests of the horses, which are our primary concern.\"\nHorse welfare charity Brooke has also axed their support of the GB champion.\nA statement from the organisation read: \"Our whole ethos is around kindness and compassion to horses and to see the opposite of this from someone with such a high profile is beyond disappointing.\n\"There can never be any justification for the mistreatment of animals and clearly any such behaviour is incompatible with representing Brooke.\"\nThe International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) has also provisionally banned her for six months while investigations are ongoing.\nThe FEI's president, Ingmar De Vos, said in a statement: \"We are deeply disappointed with this case, especially as we approach the Olympic Games in Paris 2024.\n\"However, it is our responsibility and crucial that we address any instances of abuse, as equine welfare cannot be compromised.\nRead More on The US Sun\n\"Charlotte has expressed genuine remorse for her actions, and we recognise and appreciate her willingness to take responsibility.\n\"Despite the unfortunate timing, we believe this action reaffirms the FEI's commitment to welfare as the guardians of our equine partners and the integrity of our sport.\"",

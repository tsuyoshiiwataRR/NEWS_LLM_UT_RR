    "text": "By John Jefferson Tan ,\n1 hour ago\nLatrell Sprewell was drafted by the Golden State Warriors in 1992, but he had long admired the New York Knicks. Like most players at the time, Spree also yearned to be a part of the storied franchise, and he thought the Knicks would be interested in him during his first free agency in 1996.\nAt the time, Sprewell was emerging as one of the NBA's most explosive scorers. As he hit free agency, Latrell had a vision of playing alongside Patrick Ewing , but the Knicks never recruited him and opted to sign Allan Houston instead. To this day, Spree still vividly recalls how he approached Ewing about it.\n\"I actually told Patrick, when I was with the Warriors, and I was a free agent, and now the Knicks didn't pick me up, and Allan [Houston] was a free agent too, so, it was Allan and myself. I'm thinking I want to go to the Knicks,\" Sprewell told MSG AM in 2020.\n\"I hope they give me a look, and they didn't,\" he continued. \"So, I saw Patrick the next game I played, and I went up to him, and I said, 'Hey, man, you tell the manager that I was a little ticked off that they didn't give me a look.' I really want to be a Knick at that point.\"\nThe Knicks eventually signed Spree Sprewell moved on and spent two more seasons with the Warriors. However, an infamous physical altercation with his coach saw him being dealt out of the team.\nThough Spree did not wish to leave Golden State that way, it was a stroke of luck that he was traded to the Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills, and Terry Cummings. Looking back, Sprewell believes Ewing played a role in it.\n\"Patrick looked out for me… I think that's one of the reasons why they went out there and [recruited me] when I was suspended… I think that's one of the reasons they did that and made that move,\" the four-time All-Star reflected.\nSpree enjoyed his time with Big Pat and the Knicks Unsurprisingly, a 6'5\" guard's tenure with the Knicks remains a significant chapter in his NBA career. In retrospect, Spree acknowledged how Ewing provided stability and guidance as a leader, which was crucial for the Knicks at the time.\nFor Latrell, \"Big Pat\" was not only a dominant force on the court but also a mentor who led by example and inspired his younger teammates.\n\"I loved it, every minute of it. Patrick is, he's a leader for our team. He was always one of the guys that put in extra work after practice, like myself, and you just got to appreciate everything he went through at Georgetown and just all the stuff he did with the Knicks. So, it was a lot of fun, man, I appreciate it,\" Sprewell said.\nFrom underdogs to title contenders The environment in New York empowered Sprewell to elevate his game even more and assume a larger role within the team's framework. The mutual respect between him and Ewing was palpable, as they recognized each other's strengths and understood the importance of teamwork.\nIt didn't take Sprewell long to get accustomed to the Knicks' playing style. His presence was quickly felt in his debut season with the team, helping New York secure the eighth seed in the 1999 playoffs.\nIn the postseason, it became apparent that Spree's addition to the Knicks was pivotal to their championship aspirations. Along with Ewing, Sprewell and the Knicks beat the odds, upsetting the first-seeded Miami Heat and advancing all the way to the Finals.\nRelated: \"If it was that negative, it's just disappointing\" - Joel Embiid reacts to Gilbert Arenas' xenophobic rant\nThe Knicks fought without Ewing in the Finals Unfortunately, there was some collateral damage along the way. \"Big Pat\" got hurt in the middle of the Eastern Conference Finals, forcing Ewing to sit the remainder of the series, including the entire Finals.\nWithout Ewing, the Knicks struggled to match the San Antonio Spurs' \"Twin Towers,\" Tim Duncan and David Robinson. Sprewell did his best and stepped up in the legendary big man's absence, but his efforts weren't enough to dismantle the Spurs.\n\"Going against David Robinson and Tim Duncan, we needed Patrick,\" Sprewell once confided. \"We were at a disadvantage; that's the one thing that sticks out for me, which is wondering what those finals would've been like if we had Patrick. I still think about it.\"\nIndeed, Sprewell's arrival in New York brought a unique blend of talent, tenacity, and charisma to a team that was on the cusp of accomplishing something big. It’s safe to say it was also fitting that his style and attitude complemented Ewing's approach to the game. Spree may not have won an NBA championship with the Knicks, but his synergy with Ewing made his stint memorable.\nRelated: \"Iron sharpens iron\" - Reggie Miller pays tribute to his rivalry and friendship with Patrick Ewing\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Thereâ€™s no love lost between teams in the AFC West division, as most of the teams within the division hate their divisional opponents every single year, which makes for some interesting matchups during the NFL regular season.\nAlthough the back-to-back Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs have been the cream of the crop in the division since Patrick Mahomes took over at quarterback, the Las Vegas Raiders have sometimes given them a run for their money, kicking that rivalry back into high gear.\nLast year, the Raiders lost to Mahomes and company during the Thanksgiving Day weekend but got some revenge on Christmas Day by beating the Chiefs on the road at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium.\nMahomes admitted that the loss to the Raiders on Christmas was a big blow and a game he wished had gone the other way, while Las Vegas reveled in getting the last laugh, even though they ended up missing the playoffs.\nWith the tension between the Raiders and Chiefs, it has become a storyline ahead of the 2024 NFL season and now has been taken to another level with a Kermit the Frog doll dressed up as Mahomes making the rounds during training camp in Costa Mesa via Ari Meirov of The 33rd Team.\nThe\n[#Raiders]appear to have a Patrick Mahomes Kermit the Frog doll at training camp. ðŸ‘€\n(ðŸŽ¥\n[@RaidersAQ])\n[pic.twitter.com/vaOs2TNrQh]\nâ€” Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate)\n[July 25, 2024]\nItâ€™s safe to say that this wonâ€™t be taken lightly by the Chiefs and Mahomes, as there was already a lot of tension between the two teams, with Maxx Crosby and the superstar quarterback in the middle of it all.\nItâ€™ll be interesting to see if the Chiefs come up with something to clap back at the Raiders before the season or if they will wait until they play them in Week 8 at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nNEXT: Antonio Pierce Announces Plans For QB Situation",

    "text": "By Mac Robinson ,\n28 minutes ago\nCLEVELAND, OH - Missing in action might be the best way to describe the Cleveland Guardians (61-41) offense during the month of July, punctuated by its latest 3-0 loss to the Detroit Tigers (51-53). While it has been a strength for the team throughout the season, the Guardians have scored two or less runs in half of the team's games in July.\nThroughout July entering Thursday's game against the Tigers, all four of the Guardians all-star hitters had batting averages below .280: Steven Kwan (.276), Jose Ramirez (.240), Josh Naylor (.215), and David Fry (.200).\nWhile the team's offense has had its fair share of scuffles this month, Guardians manager Stephen Vogt doesn't think the team is in a funk at the plate.\nWe were playing good baseball,” Vogt said in his postgame press conference. “I think we've had games where we scored and games where we haven't, but I wouldn't call it a funk. I would just say we've lost more games than we won the last couple of weeks. For our guys, I think I like our at-bats. I like where we are. Everybody needs to relax and be themselves.”\nIf there is a bright side to the recent skid, it's that the trade deadline is less than a week away and the team has time to adjust and potentially make some moves to help bolster the lineup for the stretch run and potentially the playoffs. Guardians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti is already surveying the trade market, which you can read more about here .\nStanding Tall\nGuardians starting pitcher Gavin Williams might have gotten the loss, but his outing against the Tigers was more than meets the eye in the statline.\nThe young right-hander threw a season-high six innings and 105 pitches total, 76 of which were strikes. Both were the most in a start for Williams since his September 17, 2023 start against the Texas Rangers.\nWhile he gave up his first home run of the season to Tigers shortstop Javier Baez in the second inning, he was immediately able to lock in afterwards. Three of the final 12 hitters Williams faced did not see more than five pitches in an at-bat. He also threw 13 pitches or less in three of the next four innings.\nWilliams, 24, finished the day allowing six hits, two walks, and those three runs from Baez's home run, while striking out nine Tigers.\nThe Guardians will need more impressive outings from Williams and fellow young starting pitcher Tanner Bibee as the season continues.\nWhat's next?\nThe Guardians will turn to right-handed pitcher Ben Lively (8-6, 3.57) to face-off against the Philadelphia Phillies in the City of Brotherly Love on Friday night. First pitch from Citizens Bank Park will come at 6:40 PM.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

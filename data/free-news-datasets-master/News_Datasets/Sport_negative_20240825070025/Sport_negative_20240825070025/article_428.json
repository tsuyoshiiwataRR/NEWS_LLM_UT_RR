    "text": "'So sorry': Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson apologises for horror loss to Germany Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson apologised for Australia's dismal opening clash in Paris , following the 3-0 drubbing at the hands of Germany . The 2016 Olympic champions thoroughly outclassed the Matildas, with Australia lucky to walk away with only three goals conceded after Germany's strikers failed to convert on several chances. Germany led 2-0 at half time through headers off corners before Julie Brand tapped in a third in the 67th minute.

Speaking to media after the match, Gustavsson did not shy away from the task ahead, while delivering a message to the fans who woke up early to catch the match. \"I just want to say I'm so sorry to let down the fans back home that put their alarms on a 3am in the morning to get up and support us. \"It's just amazing to see the support back home and I know we disappointed a lot of people. Matildas star Steph Catley, who suffered a head knock in the first half, said the result was a wake up call for the 2023 World Cup semi-finalists, who will need to make adjustments to their set piece defence. \"We have two more games and we have to turn it around quickly. We have a lot to learn from here,\" Catley said after the match. Watch every moment, every medal of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 live and free on Channel 9 and 9Now . Plus, every event streaming ad free, live and on demand with 4K on Stan Sport . \"I think at times we were well on top and let two set pieces affect the game in a very negative way. There are things that we can fix nice and quickly, which is good — but we just need to be better. \"We conceded two set pieces. We are usually much, much better on set pieces. It is a wake-up call and it is not to our standard and we need to be better for the next game and turn this tournament around.\" Gustavsson assured fans back home his team will be better against Zambia at 3am on Sunday, saying the team will show its usual resolve in the next game. \"The one thing I know about this team is that when they're backed against a corner and there's a lot of shit thrown at them with curve balls and different ways, a loss three-nil or baggage going missing … they never use these things as excuses. \"This side is so physical normally, we win all the one-on-one duels, there's aggressiveness there, we're running and our speed beats teams. But it wasn't really there tonight.\"",

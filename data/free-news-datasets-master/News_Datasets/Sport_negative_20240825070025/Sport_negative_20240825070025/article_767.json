(Photo by Christophe ARCHAMBAULT / AFP) Nigeria’s return to women’s football at the Olympics for the first time in 16 years got off to a bad start, yesterday, in Bordeaux, where the Super Falcons lost 0-1 to Brazil in the opening game of Group C.\nNigerians were expecting the Super Falcons to build on their impressive performance at the 2023 World Cup in Australia/New Zealand, where they came within a penalty shoot-out to the quarterfinals, but they were hemmed back by a Brazilian side relying so much on Marta’s artistry to dictate the game.\nThe match was on an even flow in the first half until the 37th minute when Marta seized the ball and sent a sweet pass to Gabriel da Silva, who unleashed a ferocious strike beyond the flailing hands of Chiamaka Nnadozie.\nThereafter, the Samba Girls took over the pitch, running at the Nigerians at will.\nPerhaps, the outcome would have been different had Chinwendu Ihezuo made good use of Nigeria’s best chance of the game early in the half.\nNigeria had three big chances in quick succession, one of which was led by Rasheedat Ajibade, Nigeria’s best player, beating her marker before crossing for Ihezuo, whose header was saved by Brazil’s goalkeeper.\nThe second half belonged to the Brazilians, whose fluid movement and precise passes confounded the Super Falcons.\nBut the Super Falcons did not go down without a fight as they took matters into their hands towards the end of the game. But their best efforts could not yield the desired equalizer.\nThis defeat means that Randy Waldrum’s side must win one of their two games against world champions, Spain and Japan, and also get a draw in one to stand a chance of making the second round as one of the best third-placed teams after the first round of games.",

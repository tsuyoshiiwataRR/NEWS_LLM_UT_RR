    "text": "Billy Horschel was one of the many names fans had their eyes on for this week’s 3M Open. He was one of the first players to arrive on Monday after his incredible Open Championship performance in Scotland. However, he withdrew from the event before his tee time on Thursday, allowing Adam Long to enter the field. After his announcement, the former Florida Gator explained why he had to withdraw from the tournament. “I wasn’t feeling great late last night and took some medicine,” Horschel said in an official announcement Thursday. “Decent sleep but woke up and have a fever, the body is just not wanting to respond; every muscle feels like it’s locked up. Tried to do a little warmup in the gym, just didn’t respond.” “Tried to go out to the golf course and hit some balls — the body’s not wanting to cooperate. Disappointing. I was looking forward to playing here at 3M. Played here last year and had a good finish. The event is well run by 3M and Tracy and Hollis, so very disappointed not to be able to play here after coming off a really great finish last week.” He also posted to his X, formerly known as Twitter, why he pulled out. Last year, Horschel finished T13 in his first start at this event. He spoke with the media Wednesday and hinted at feeling a touch different but chalked it up to travel. “I felt pretty good for the last couple of days. This morning I woke up and I was a little tired, body was moving a little bit slower, but that’s expected,” Horschel said Wednesday ahead of his withdrawal. “You travel halfway around the world, and you played the last couple of weeks over in Scotland — Any of the guys coming over from there are going to feel the same thing.” Horschel sits No. 26 in the FedEx Cup standings, so he did not necessarily need the points in Minnesota, but he loves this event. He values the family atmosphere and likes the way the golf course plays. Hopefully, he will feel better for the PGA Tour’s final regular-season event, the Wyndham Championship. However, it is uncertain if Horschel has committed to playing. Savannah Leigh Richardson is a golf staff writer for SB Nation’s Playing Through.

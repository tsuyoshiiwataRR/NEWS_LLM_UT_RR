    "text": "Julián Álvarez Could Leave Manchester City As a new football season approaches, Manchester City has been the club struggling the most to retain its players. Following rumors that suggested Kevin De Bruyne and Ederson might leave the English club, it now seems that one of their biggest stars also wants to depart to secure more playing time.\nDrama in Bordeaux! Historic Girondins Bordeaux Renounces Professional Football Club Status\nJulián Álvarez, formerly of River Plate and World Cup champion, is reportedly considering leaving Manchester City not only to find a club that offers him more game time but also one that meets his expectations in terms of environment, as it is said he is looking for \"a warmer climate.\"\nManchester City's stance is clear: Álvarez will leave if an offer of $77.1 million or more is made. The talented Argentine player has been living in the shadow of Erling Haaland, a forward who has not had the best season with the “Citizens.”\n“We’ll see, I don’t know if at the last moment someone will come for one of our players and they will end up leaving, which would force us to replace those departures,” said Pep Guardiola, which could explain his stance on these rumors.\nWhich club should a player who has practically won everything at 24 years old go to? For now, Julián Álvarez’s focus is on seeking Olympic gold with Argentina.",

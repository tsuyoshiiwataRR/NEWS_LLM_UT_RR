    "text": "Injuries are part of football, but every team hopes to start training camp with a fully healthy roster. That won't be the case for the Cleveland Browns. On Wednesday, the team announced its injury designations for a handful of players ahead of camp with the surprising additions of DT Dalvin Tomlinson to the Physically Unable to Perform list and CB Greg Newsome II to the Non-Football Injury list. On the first day of practice from the team's temporary home at the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia, head coach Kevin Stefanski shared more details on each player's injuries, including that both required surgery. \"Greg Newsome had surgery on his hamstring, so he'll be out,\" the Browns head man said.\"Hopefully have him back for week one, but I'll have more of an update as we get closer. Davin Tomlinson is having surgery tomorrow (Friday), having a scope on his knee. Same idea [as Newsome]. We'll continue to just work through it.\" The hope from Stefanski an company is that both players are back in time for Week 1. He added added some context to both injuries as well, revealing that Newsome sustained his while working out on his own this summer. For Tomlinson, his arrival for camp allowed the team to use an MRI to discover a problem in his knee. They felt it was best to get the procedure done and out of the way now rather than later.",

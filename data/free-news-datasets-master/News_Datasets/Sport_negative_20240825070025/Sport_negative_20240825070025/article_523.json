    "text": "By David Suggs ,\n1 hour ago\nUSWNT's first Olympic matchup — a duel against Zambia — was a glimmering success, with the Americans walking out 3-0 victors courtesy of goals from Trinity Rodman and Mallory Swanson.\nIt was just the sort of performance the Americans were yearning for in their first major international tournament matchup of the Emma Hayes era.\nNumerous players showcased their quality during the contest, from goal-scorers Rodman and Swanson to steadfast defender Naomi Girma. Few were as daunting as Sophia Smith, however, as the Portland Thorns talent was more menace than player, slipping past challenges to create chances for herself and others.\nSmith's day came to a premature end when she appeared to be felled by a leg ailment right before the end of the half. Her status at present is unknown, although many are hoping her exit was nothing more than a precautionary measure taken by Hayes and USWNT's medical personnel.\nHere's the latest on the Smith's health going forward in the 2024 Paris Olympics.\nMORE: USWNT dismantle Zambia in strong start to 2024 Olympic soccer journey\nSophia Smith injury update Smith exited the contest early, strutting off the pitch after going down with an apparent leg injury in the 43rd minute. She was replaced by Lynn Williams, although the extent of the injury wasn't immediately revealed.\nSmith played a vital role in UWSNT's victory on Thursday, starting the move that led to the first score of the day, finished off by Trinity Rodman. She took home the SheBelieves Cup MVP back in April after bagging two goals to lead the Americans past Canada, Brazil, and Japan.\nThe hope from American fans is that Smith's removal was simply precautionary. The former NWSL MVP is one of the world's best forwards and her presence in Hayes' attacking trident could be the difference between an early Olympic exit and gold medal immortality.\nHayes revealed she hadn't yet received an update on the nature of Smith's injury. She said the team will have more clarity on her issue once they return to their home base in Marseille.\nJaedyn Shaw injury update USWNT isn't lacking in attacking vigor. However, Hayes' squad was without one of its more vital elements on Thursday, as San Diego Wave star Jaedyn Shaw was ruled a late injury scratch after reportedly sustaining a leg injury.\nDetails were sparse regarding Shaw's injury. She was replaced in the matchday squad by Spirit midfielder Croix Bethune. According to ESPN , Shaw's injury occurred during Wednesday's training session. The injury isn't considered to be all that serious.\nMuch like Smith, Shaw's injury is still coaxed in uncertainty, per Hayes. She revealed that more details regarding Shaw's issue will be released once USWNT returns to Marseille.\nMORE: Jaedyn Shaw, Korbin Albert headline USWNT's historically young side\nCatarina Macario injury update After making her return back from an ACL tear that kept her off the field for 20 months, Macario appeared destined to slot seamlessly into Hayes' tactical setup come this year's Olympics.\nThose hopes were dashed after the Chelsea forward suffered \"minor knee irritation,\" ruling her out of the festivities weeks before USWNT's opening match.\n“I’m absolutely gutted for Cat, someone I’ve worked hard with,\" Hayes said, per The Athletic . \"In the last 12 months, she’s really put a shift in to get there. But it’s not to be and I know the team certainly want to give her our best support.”\nWilliams took Macario's place in the 18, while defender Emily Sams replaced Williams as one of the team's alternates.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

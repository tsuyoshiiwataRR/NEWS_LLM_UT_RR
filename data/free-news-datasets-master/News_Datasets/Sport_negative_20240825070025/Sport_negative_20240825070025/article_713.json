    "text": "WHITESTOWN — The Floyds Knobs Community Club 12U All-Stars fell one game short of playing for the Little League World Series on Thursday afternoon.\nAustintown (Ohio) avenged their third-round loss to FKCC and won 3-1 in the Central Region Tournament semifinal of the 10-team modified double-elimination tourney in Whitestown.\n“Despite the outcome of this game, that’s not going to change what this team is,” Floyds Knobs head coach Svend Jansen said. “This team is a group of resilient young ladies that I was blessed to be part of. We will never forget this experience and I hope none of them do. The way they captivated the whole town and community was something so special. This is something they will remember for the rest of their lives to come up here, win their first three games and have an opportunity to get to the Little League World Series there’s not a lot of kids that get that chance.”\nOhio will defend its Central Region title when they face Missouri in the winner-take-all championship at 1:45 p.m. Friday afternoon at the Central Region Headquarters in Whitestown.\nFloyds Knobs continued their hot start from last night against Missouri.\nIn the bottom of the first, Livy Stackhouse tripled to center and scored one batter later on Naomi Wathen’s single.\n“I was waiting for Livy to do that and she caught one,” Jansen said. “That was great to jump out and take the early lead. I think a few defensive plays cost us in the second when they put a few on the board. I’m proud of the girls because that’s a pitcher who has struck out 17 batters in a game before. We were putting the ball in play and that was a great team.”\nThat was FKCC’s only run in the game.\nOhio tied the game in the top of the second. Floyds Knobs starter Briley Mercer, who started all region games, struck out the first batter before Lexi Petrilla singled to right. After another strikeout, Lilly Sheffield singled to right with Petrilla scoring on the throw.\nThe game stayed tied at 1-all until the top of the fourth. That’s when Mila Hamley doubled and then scored on an FKCC error to put Ohio up 2-1. Gracie Faunda drove in Polder for the third run.\nFKCC’s biggest chance for a comeback came in the bottom of the fifth. Wathen and Audrey Brutscher singled with no outs. But Hamley struck out two before Sam Prifogle came to the plate with two runners on base. She hit a ground ball and reached on an error. But Stella Bibelhauser was called out at home plate for the would-be second run.\nHamley limited FKCC’s offense to five hits as she pitched a complete game and fanned nine.\n“We hit the ball on her today and their defense made some plays,” Jansen said. “I’m proud of the girls because that’s a pitcher who has struck out 17 batters in a game before. We were putting the ball in play and that was a great team. The fact they’re the defending champs and the amount of returning players they have is a solid team.”\nWathen went 2-for-2 at the plate to lead FKCC’s 5-hit attack. Cadence Jansen, Stackhouse and Brutscher each singled. Caroline Bennington was walked.\n“Wathen’s been a rock for us this entire tournament from district to now,” Jansen said. “She caught every single inning here at the central region. For her to do what she did not only defensively but at the plate, the kid is a warrior and never gets phased. She’s going to play for a long time.”\nOn defense, Cadence was a ball magnet by recording three putouts – two were key grabs in the second and third innings to end Ohio’s threats. Additionally, Bennington recorded two putouts while Stackhouse and Briley Mercer added one apiece.\n“She has worked at that and when the ball is hit in that direction I’m pretty confident she’s going to make the play,” Jansen said of Cadence. “She has put the work in and I think shortstop is a position she’s trying to gravitate towards.”\nMercer pitched a complete game in her fourth start. She gave up seven hits with two earned runs and fanned eight.\nMercer and Grace Fiore are the returning players for next year’s 12U All-Star team. Floyds Knobs finished the season as District 5 and State champions going 10-2 and a third-place Central Region spot.\n“I think I saw this run happening when they were 7-8,” Jansen said. “I think that’s when we thought we could make some noise when they got to the 12U level. I think it was always something we knew if we could get all of the kids to play, then we could make a run like this. Once we got here we didn’t want to be satisfied with just getting here, I think everyone felt we had an opportunity to win the whole thing.\n“I hate to see it end but it’s something I will never forget for the rest of my life,” he continued. “I want to thank all of the fans, parents and all of the friends back home who cheered and encouraged us. The amount of calls and text messages all of us coaches got throughout the week was just incredible. To see that kind of support from the local community was just phenomenal and I want to thank them for all.”\n.\nCENTRAL REGION TOURNAMENT\nat Central Region Headquarters, Whitestown\nThursday afternoon’s Central Region semifinal\nOHIO 3, FLOYDS KNOBS COMMUNITY CLUB 1\nOhio 010 200 — 3 7 1\nFloyds Knobs 100 000 — 1 5 1\nW — Mila Hamley (Ohio).

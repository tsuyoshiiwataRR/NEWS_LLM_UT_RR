    "text": "Even though it's just preseason, the truth is that Valencia is still facing the same issues as they did at the end of last year. Back then, Rubén Baraja's team struggled against teams that were considered weaker than those at Mestalla. The main problems were the lack of offensive quality and the inability to control games and dominate at crucial moments. Sevilla, Mallorca, Rayo, Alavés.. these were the four teams that managed to keep Valencia from scoring at Mestalla during the second round. This highlighted the team's struggles in creating opportunities, especially since they haven't signed any new players for the midfield or wings, despite Baraja's requests and the recent signings of goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski and forward Rafa Mir. Valencia seems to be stuck. In their first two friendly matches, they failed to score against Alavés and Castellón. Their offensive weaknesses are evident, while their defense remains solid, limiting their opponents' chances. Until they offload a couple of players, Valencia won't be able to make any new signings. One potential departure is Samu Castillejo, who hasn't reported to training almost three weeks into preseason. The club is even considering offers from unconventional markets like Saudi Arabia. While players like Giorgi Mamardahsvili, Cristhian Mosquera, or Diego López are yet to return, Baraja is still lacking reinforcements due to the absences. They were missing up to ten players against Alavés: Gayà, Diakhaby, Jaume Doménech, Fran Pérez, Alberto Marí, Cenk Özkacar, André Almeida, Cristhian Mosquera, Mamardashvili, and Yarek. This explains why Valencia is struggling with quality at the moment. Baraja only had one central defender, César Tárrega, against the babazorro team and only one winger from the first team, Sergi Canós, which forced him to play with a seventeen-year-old winger, David Otorbi, a winger who really is a playmaker, like Martín Tejón, and a player signed for the reserve team but who debuted this Thursday with the first team, like Hamza Bellari. The Valladolid native is feeling concerned because he knows that the beginning of the season won't be easy at all. Facing Barça, trips to Balaídos and Athletic, Villarreal, Atlético, Girona, Osasuna, and Real Sociedad is no walk in the park. Valencia has a tough road ahead, and it definitely needs a couple of new signings if it wants to take on Barcelona in the first league match with confidence.This content has been translated and adapted from the Spanish version of the digital newspaper",

    "text": "BOSTON — In 2022, the Yankees began the season 61-23 and held a 15 ¹/₂-game lead in the AL East on July 8.\nWhat followed was a 38-40 struggle that climaxed with an Aaron Boone slam of the table , insisting that “it’s right in front of us,” en route to a meek sweep at the Astros’ hands in the ALCS.\nIn 2023, the Yankees were 36-25 on June 4, in the hunt for the division and in comfortable playoff position.\n4 Aaron Judge reacts during the Yankees’ loss to the Mets on July 25, 2024. Charles Wenzelberg / New York Post What followed was a 26-43 flatline that began with an Aaron Judge slam of his foot into the base of the wall at Dodger Stadium, a collapse that tanked the Yankees out of relevance .\nIn 2024, the Yankees were 50-22 on June 14, the only annoyance a relentless Orioles club that stayed within reach of first.\nWhat has followed has been a 10-22 run that has revealed far too many holes for a team with World Series hopes during a stretch that might have culminated with yet another Boone table-slam , albeit softer, and another “it’s right in front of us” after getting swept out of the Subway Series on Wednesday.\nExplore More Mike Francesa torches Yankees in epic 26-minute rant after Subway Series sweep: ‘Circus clowns’ Aaron Boone spitting out expletives after Yankees’ latest ugly loss Mets’ Tyrone Taylor batters Gerrit Cole again in big offensive night Is it happening again?\nA season that began with not just aspirations but expectations, after going all-in with the Juan Soto trade, again has been sidetracked by a midseason swoon that is threatening to ruin the year .\nBaltimore’s downturn has kept the O’s within an arm’s reach in the division, but the Yankees hold just a 3 ½-game lead on the final wild card.\n4 Aaron Boone has repeatedly claimed that’s “it’s right in front of us” despite the Yankees’ struggles. Robert Sabo for NY Post They could be another poor series or two — beginning Friday at Fenway Park against a Red Sox club on the rise — from falling out of playoff position altogether.\n“We got the guys in this room that can flip the switch and get us back to where we need to be,” Judge said Wednesday, after a series in which he reached base five times (four walks and a hit by pitch) in nine plate appearances, the Mets seeing little reason to pitch to a superstar with no lineup protection.\nLuis Severino’s good-natured jab was not off-base.\nGo beyond the box score with the Bombers Sign up for Inside the Yankees by Greg Joyce, exclusively on Sports+.\nThank you Enter your email address Please provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\nEnjoy this Post Sports+ exclusive newsletter!\nCheck out more newsletters Perhaps with the exception of Gleyber Torres, who has begun to hit, the Yankees have had two dependable (and overwhelming) hitters and virtually no other threat in their batting order for nearly six weeks.\nSince this nosedive began June 15, hitters Nos. 1 and 4-9 — so, everyone outside of Soto’s and Judge’s 2 and 3 holes — have compiled a .207 average (that entered play Thursday worse than every team’s except the Mariners in the span) and .625 OPS (worse than everyone’s except the White Sox in the stretch).\n“We’re pissed off in there,” Boone said during a tense postgame news conference Wednesday. “We got a lot of pride in there. We got a lot of expectation in there.”\n4 Gerrit Cole reacts during the Yankees’ loss to the Mets on July 24, 2024. JASON SZENES FOR THE NEW YORK POST No one has questioned the team’s desire or work ethic.\nJudge, notably, has begun questioning the team’s confidence.\nAlex Verdugo is in a 5-for-48 rut over his past 13 games .\nBen Rice has not come up with a multi-hit game since his three-homer day on July 6, 4-for-46 in the stretch.\nDJ LeMahieu, a two-time batting champion, has watched his average fall all the way to .179 .\nThere is reason for Yankees hitters to get discouraged, but doing so does not help.\n“You can read body language sometimes, and there’s some certain times where we’re hanging our head a little,” Judge said. “And you just need a little kick in the butt to get it going again.”\n4 The Yankees’ downfall this season has been eerily similar to the past two years. Charles Wenzelberg / New York Post Maybe Boone’s emotion, cursing on a couple of occasions and insisting that the club has the ability, was meant as a little kick.\nThe Yankees not long ago were the best team in baseball and did not yet even have their best pitcher.\n“I think we have a lot of talent in the room,” said Gerrit Cole, who owns a 5.40 ERA in seven starts since returning .\n“Just got to see what we did at the beginning of the season,” Soto added. “We have everything that we need to go out there and dominate.”\nTuesday’s trade deadline looms particularly large for a team that would not settle for anything less than a World Series and has holes in the infield, bullpen and perhaps outfield.\nPublicly at least, though, the team is insisting it has the means to fix the issues without Brian Cashman’s immediate help.\n“We hold the pen,” Boone said. “We’re in control of the story.”\nHe hopes it is a story Yankees fans haven’t already read the past two years.",

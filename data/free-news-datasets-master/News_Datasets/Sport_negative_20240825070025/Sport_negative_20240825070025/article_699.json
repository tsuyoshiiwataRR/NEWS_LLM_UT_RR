    "text": "Sports Entertainment Tom Brady ‘very mad’ about losing beach football game before Michael Rubin’s white party By Social Links for Andrew Battifarano View Author Archive Follow on X Get author RSS feed Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.\nBack to Reading Published July 25, 2024, 8:12 p.m. ET Tom Brady might be retired from playing NFL football, but that does not mean his competitive juices have completely evaporated.\nBrady, the seven-time Super Bowl champion, lost a July 4 beach football game in the Hamptons before Fanatics founder and CEO Michael Rubin’s famous white party .\nRubin told Bleacher Report’s Taylor Rooks that Brady was “very mad” that he lost the game.\n“He was mad, very mad,” Rubin said about Brady’s mindset after the loss. “I was also mad too ’cause I thought we were going to win.”\nMichael Rubin tells @TaylorRooks details on the beach football game with Tom Brady, Micah Parsons, C.J. Stroud and more before his White Party\n(via Taylor Rooks X) pic.twitter.com/UhWXT97ceA\n— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) July 25, 2024\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Michael Rubin (@michaelrubin)\nExplore More Tom Brady linked to SI Swimsuit model Brooks Nader in latest dating rumor Tom Brady ‘ignored’ Terrell Owens’ plea for Bucs comeback attempt after Antonio Brown walkout Jalen Brunson inspired by Derek Jeter, Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes in new deal Rubin, the sports merch company exec, opened up on some details about the game, saying he was Brady’s first pick.\n“And you were the franchise pick,” Rooks said.\n“Which was the mistake,” Rubin said in a self-deprecating reply. “That’s like when you draft somebody wrong. Tom drafting me with the first pick was a gigantic error.”\nIn the game, a 5-4 loss for Brady’s crew, which included Odell Beckham Jr. and Micah Parsons, the former Patriots and Buccaneers signal-caller threw an interception that went back the other way to Bills defensive back Damar Hamlin.\n3 Tom Brady playing football on the beach in the Hamptons.

Getty Images for REFORM Alliance The other team, which also included Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud, appeared to be ready for the moment to take down a football giant.\n“What I didn’t realize for C.J. and Damar was they’re like ‘We’re playing f–king Tom Brady,'” Rubin recalled. “‘You guys are having fun, we’re coming to kill.’ … I mean Tom always wants to win in everything he does. The other team was like ‘This is our chance to actually beat Tom Brady.'”\nBrady will now be taking his talents to the broadcast booth, calling games for Fox as the No. 1 NFL team’s analyst .",

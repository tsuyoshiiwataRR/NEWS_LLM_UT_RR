    "text": "The Matildas at Paris 2024: Olympic schedule and where to watch Our beloved national women’s football team defeated Zambia 6-5 in their nailbiting second Olympics match.\nBy Hayley Peppin and Dani Maher\nINSTAGRAM / @MATILDAS WHILE YOU WERE sleeping, the Matildas won their second preliminary Olympics match against Zambia, in a game that came down to a nailbiting final half. The Australian national team’s 6-5 win in Nice comes as a welcome relief following their devastating 3-0 loss at the hands of Germany in Marseille last week.\nDespite legendary player Sam Kerr unable to play this Olympic year due to an ACL injury, fans are optimistic about captain Steph Catley’s formidable side, with Catley herself, as well as forward Caitlin Foord and midfielder Katrina Gorry having all recovered from respective injuries just in time.\nThe most recent match saw the Matildas come back from a tense halftime, when they were trailing Zambia 2-4. But our underdogs rallied, with Michelle Heyman and Catley clawing back from behind to score four goals in a thrilling second half to win the match.\nEarlier in Marseilles, Germany — who are ranked No. 4 in the world — were ruthless going forward, and perhaps could have scored more goals had the Matildas not leapt to defence. Need we remind fans that Australia also haven’t beaten Germany in almost two decades, so it was never going to be an easy first game. Now, the Tillies have one last preliminary match to show off their chops, and it won’t be an easy one, as they face off team USA, who knocked them into fourth place in Tokyo.\nBelow, we round up how you can cheer on the Matildas with upcoming games and where to watch them — and what they’ll need to do to earn a podium finish at the Olympics .\nRelated : Everything Australian viewers need to know about the Paris 2024 Olympic Games\nINSTAGRAM / @MATILDAS When do the Matildas play at the Olympics? The Matildas’ Olympics Games campaign kicked off on Thursday, July 25 at 7pm Paris time — ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympic Opening Ceremony on July 26.\nWith a 3-0 loss to heavyweights Germany in Marseille, captain Steph Catley told media the girls “need to be better.”\n“It was definitely a wake-up call. We have two more games and we have to turn it around quickly. We have a lot to learn from here. I think at times we were well on top and let two set pieces affect the game in a very negative way. There are things that we can fix nice and quickly, which is good. But we just need to be better.”\nCatley continued by saying the Matildas need to learn from their preliminary game mistakes, as they continue their Olympics campaign. “They are a good team. We did it to ourselves in the end. We conceded two set pieces. We are usually much, much better on set pieces. It is a wake-up call and it is not to our standard and we need to be better for the next game and turn in this tournament around.”\nRelated : Ellie Carpenter: On a mission\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Matildas (@matildas)\nWhen are the Matildas next games at the Olympics? The Matildas have one more preliminary Paris 2024 match, facing the USA (ranked fifth) on Thursday, August 1. Their game is at 7pm Paris time, which falls in the devastatingly early hours of the morning for us at 3am AEST.\nWhen are the football finals at the Olympics? If the Matildas qualify (crossing our fingers and toes!) they’ll be up for the following rounds:\nSaturday—Sunday, August 3-4: Quarter-finals Tuesday, August 7: Semi-finals Friday, August 9: Bronze medal match Sunday, August 11: Gold medal match\nHow to watch the Matildas 2024 Olympics matches You’ll be able to tune into all the Matildas action via the Nine Network, which this year holds the Olympics broadcasting rights. You’ll be able to watch each of their games live and free (if you’re so inclined for that 3am wake-up) on more than 40 of Nine’s free-to-air channels. If you prefer a sleep-in, you can catch up on highlights via the broadcaster’s 9Now streaming platform.\nFor the first time, local streamer Stan will also broadcast the Olympics — all games, ad-free, live and on-demand.\nAnd if you prefer to watch the games away from home, there’s a slew of venues and public spaces across the country showcasing the games — from Federation Square in Melbourne’s CBD to The Tumbalong Park Sound Shell at Darling Harbour in Sydney.\nRelated : A psychologist explains why the Matildas have suddenly awoken your inner sports fan\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Matildas (@matildas)\nWhat are the Matildas ranked in the world? According to the most recent FIFA Women’s World Ranking, the Matildas are currently ranked 12th in the world. World No. 1 goes to Spain, with France in second place, England in third and Germany in fourth.\nHave the Matildas ever won an Olympic medal before? The Matildas haven’t secured a Olympic medal before — but they did come close at the last Olympics. At Tokyo 2021, the girls just lost the bronze medal to USA, earning a fourth place position.\nRelated : The CommBank Matildas suit up in local label BEARE PARK before playing to a record home crowd in Sydney",

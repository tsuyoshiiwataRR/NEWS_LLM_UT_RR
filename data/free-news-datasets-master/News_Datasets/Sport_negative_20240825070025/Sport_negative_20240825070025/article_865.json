    "text": "Ring Magazine and IBF cruiserweight champion Jai Opetaia (25-0, 19 KOs) has offered a scathing assessment of why a unification bout against WBO titleholder Chris Billam-Smith has not come to fruition. The 29-year-old Australian southpaw has made it clear he wants all the belts ever since he overcame a double fracture to his jaw to dethrone Ring champion Mairis Briedis (28-3, 20 KOs) via unanimous decision two years ago. England’s Billam-Smith, 33, won the WBO strap with a majority decision victory over Lawrence Okolie (20-1, 15 KOs) in an ugly fight in May last year. He has since spoken of his own desire for unification bouts, including against Opetaia as recently as early June, but latest reports have linked him to a bout against WBA titleholder Gilberto “Zurdo” Ramirez (46-1, 30 KOs). It has left Opetaia in a frustrating position as he continues to look for a suitable dance partner who can bring out his greatness. Opetaia didn’t sound hopeful when he was interviewed at ringside on Thursday night during DAZN’s coverage of the Justis Huni versus Troy Pilcher fight in Brisbane about the potential of a Billam-Smith bout. He even offered up $250,000 of his own money to Billam-Smith to get the fight made. “I’m ready for that fight,” Opetaia said. “They’ve been going over saying they’re waiting for negotiations and shit. It’s fucking bullshit. He don’t want that fight. “It’s easy done. He’d get the biggest paycheck he’s ever had. He’ll be on the biggest stage he’s ever been on. It’s a no-brainer to take, but the only reason they wouldn’t take it is if they’re ducking. “The offer’s there, we’ve made the offer. If he’s not taking it, he’s ducking the fight.” Opetaia’s manager, Mick Francis, is equally bemused by Billam-Smith’s apparent reluctance to face his fighter. “Jai wants to get this fight made more than anything else,” said Francis. “But we’ve heard nothing but crickets since the offer went through. It seems like Billam-Smith might be looking to go to America to fight instead. Ben Shalom’s boxers have a history of ducking Jai, so we’re not surprised. “Jai wants to fight the best there is and Chris is making excuses about wanting to box in America instead. This narrative started in the post-fight interview after he beat Richard Riakporhe and it hasn’t stopped.” Days out from his title defense against Riakporhe (17-1, 13 KOs) early last month, Billam-Smith made all the right noises when asked about an Opetaia matchup, but with one caveat – the Aussie would need to pick up more hardware first. “I think it’s the biggest fight in the division at the moment,” Billam-Smith told Sky Sports. “It would be great to get that fight done. It would be amazing if we could do it for an undisputed world title, for all four of the belts. “I think that’s the big one. I’ve got a job to do, but down the line, definitely, it’s a huge fight and the biggest fight in the division. “He ticks a lot of boxes; he’s got good footwork, really good timing, good speed, good shot selection there. He’s super tough as well, obviously – you’ve seen him fight with a broken jaw. “He’s a really, really talented fighter and, like I said, ticks a lot of boxes. So it would be great if we could fight down the line.” Opetaia is itching to get back in the ring following his second points win over Latvian veteran Briedis in Saudi Arabia in May. Speaking immediately after the fight, Opetaia made it clear who he wanted his next opponent to be. “I want the WBO next,” he said. “I want the winner of Chris Billam-Smith and [Richard Riakporhe], and after that we’re gonna collect the rest.” As of right now, that bout is unlikely to happen any time soon.

Former NFL running back and two-time Super Bowl Champion LeSean McCoy has constantly criticized the Cowboys and quarterback Dak Prescott. Recommended Videos During an interview on Fan Duel TVâ€™s Up & Adams show hosted by Kay Adams, McCoy was asked what he believes stopped Dak Prescott from being able to perform at a high level in the postseason. McCoy answered with a bashing of Prescottâ€™s mental toughness. 2x SB Champ LeSean McCoy onâ€” Up & Adams (@UpAndAdamsShow) [#Cowboys]QB Dak Prescott's postseason struggles... ðŸ‘€ðŸ”Š \"I don't think he's tough enough... he plays like he don't have that dawg in him.\" [@CutonDime25] [@heykayadams] [pic.twitter.com/bT2YHKyQYS] [July 25, 2024] Prescott and the rest of the Cowboys started the practice portion of training camp hours after the interview and might get asked for his reaction to McCoyâ€™s criticism.

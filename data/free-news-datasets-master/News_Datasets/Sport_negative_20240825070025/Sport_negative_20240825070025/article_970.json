    "text": "“How…to get rid of all this clutter?” Joey Cohen, vice president of race operations at Legacy Motor Club [https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nascar/legacy-motor-club/], had joked early this year. After a major overhaul at the cusp of 2024 and an OEM shift, LMC seems primed for another big change. Only whispers have floated about, as the rumor mills are working again. But this time the change may not be hunky dory! The 2024 season chugged through without dropping any solid finishes for the team. Even Jimmie Johnson [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/jimmie-johnson/], part-time driver, and former NASCAR legend, could not maneuver the Next Gen car. Hence, he may have some more news coupled with the team’s change. JIMMIE JOHNSON MAY LET GO ONCE AND FOR ALL The Legacy Motor Club team registered only four top-ten finishes this season. John Hunter Nemechek [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/john-hunter-nemechek/], driving the No. 42 car, has shown the strongest speed – fetching three top tens. At Indianapolis Motor Speedway, he battled with Cup heavyweights and paced the field for 16 laps. But the nagging cautions of the Brickyard 400 [https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nascar/brickyard-400/] eventually caught up with Nemechek on the first restart – he could piece together a 29th-place finish. Jimmie Johnson, a four-time Brickyard winner, also crashed out his No. 84 car [https://www.essentiallysports.com/nascar-news-hang-it-up-jimmie-johnson-trends-on-social-media-as-seven-x-cup-champs-cursed-run-leaves-nascar-fans-heartbroken/] due to Carson Hocevar’s antics. Now, Nemechek and Johnson’s wrecked misery may be accompanied by some distressing changes within the LMC team. A NASCAR page recently posted an illuminating post on Instagram: “Sounds like the whole 84 team (and maybe a handful of others at LMC) were let go yesterday. I guess if they intend for Johnson to run his final three races of the year they better get to hiring before long.” We cannot confirm the team changes, which do come as a surprise after Johnson appreciated Nemechek after Brickyard: “I think our group is starting to understand what we need for the cars.” Since retiring in 2020, Jimmie Johnson has been on a part-time racing schedule. This year he took the wheel of the No. 84 Toyota Camry, being sponsored by AdventHealth for six races. Yet the seven-time NASCAR Cup champion’s former glory may have settled. Johnson put up a measly showing in most of his races so far, fumbling outside the top 25. If the rumor mills are correct about shuffling the No. 84 crew, then Jimmie Johnson’s part-time routine may be short-lived. This overhaul inside the team is an echo of last year when Noah Gragson was stripped of his duties for the No. 42 car. The current Stewart-Haas Racing driver got into trouble for an insensitive action on social media, and LMC immediately washed its hands of him. Gragson’s ejection was not the only overhaul that LMC underwent, however. They changed their cars and aesthetics as well. LMC WENT THROUGH A MAJOR CHANGE ALREADY Before the 2024 season, Legacy Motor Club was part of the Chevrolet bandwagon. However, as the team name changed several times – racing under Evernham Motorsports in the 2000s, Richard Petty Motorsports in 2009-2021, Petty GMS Motorsports, and then Legacy Motor Club – it also changed its car manufacturer for 2024. And that involved selling off Chevy car parts. “I turned into part salesman the last three races of the year,” Cohen said in January. “We have a communication path with all of our other teams, so I’m sending emails to all our Chevrolet counterparts.” Cohen also observed the expansion of the LMC workforce, as it grew from 70 or 75 employees to about 115. He mentioned the different departments under Toyota that came to life. “We have an aero department now that has a lead. We have a quality control department that has a staff of four that has a lead. Somebody that’s directly tied in with software development or engineering technology tools that we’re going to start to take on with Toyota and what they do with that type of stuff. We have a simulator that lives here in the shop. Those guys are on that two to three days a week, so that’s a responsibility that needs someone to manage it and operate it. We didn’t have that last year.” But sadly, some of those experienced staff may be let go soon if the rumors are true. Meanwhile, 83-time race winner Jimmie Johnson is struggling to put up a post-retirement glory finish.",

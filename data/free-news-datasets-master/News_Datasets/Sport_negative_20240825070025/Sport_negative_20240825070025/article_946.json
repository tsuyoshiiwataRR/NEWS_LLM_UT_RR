    "text": "During his recent\npodcast appearance with ON3, Kirby Smart might have taken a subtle jibe at Deion Sanders and Co. With all the Cormani McClain drama unfolding for the past few months, right from when he alleged them “to be playing for clicks” to him committing to Gators to highlighting the “cultural” loopholes in Colorado.\nBeing the head coach of one of the top seeds of CFB, Kirby Smart took a smart, camouflaged shot at Deion Sanders-Cormani McClain drama by speaking of his recruitment strategy. “First question we ask is why did you go in the portal? And I sit back and listen. If it’s blank blame, all the coaches, all them, I’m really not interested. Because that then would become me at the new place. I want to hear them out and kind of hear what their reasoning is and when they have good reasoning for why they’re leaving, they fit kind of the the unselfish culture we try to promote,” Smart said, throwing indirect shade at Deion Sanders while promoting the ‘unselfish culture’ of his program.\nThis is a developing story. Stay tuned for further updates.",

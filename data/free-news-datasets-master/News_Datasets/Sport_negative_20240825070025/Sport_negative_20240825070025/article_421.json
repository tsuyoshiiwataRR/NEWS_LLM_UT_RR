    "text": "ANKARA, July 26 (Bernama-Anadolu) -- New Zealand has reported Canada Soccer for a drone flying above its women's football training site at the Paris 2024 Olympics, Anadolu Agency reported.\n\"The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) was made aware that a non-accredited member of the Canada Soccer support team was detained by French authorities in Saint-Étienne following a complaint by New Zealand Football on July 22.\n\"The staff member is believed to have been using a drone to record the New Zealand women’s football team during practice,\" it said in a statement Wednesday.\nThe COC said it \"stands for fair-play and we are shocked and disappointed.\"\nIt offered \"heartfelt apologies\" to the New Zealand football team and its Olympic Committee.\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee said two Canada Soccer staff have been removed from the Olympic team.\nJoseph Lombardi, an unaccredited analyst with Canada Soccer and Jasmine Mander, who serves as an assistant coach, were said to be sent home.\n\"COC has accepted the decision of Head Coach Bev Priestman to remove herself from coaching the match against New Zealand on July 25th.\n\"Canada Soccer staff will undergo mandatory ethics training,\" it added.\n\"I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our programme. Accordingly, to emphasise our team’s commitment to integrity, I have decided to voluntarily withdraw from coaching the match on Thursday. In the spirit of accountability, I do this with the interests of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld,\" Priestman said in an apology to New Zealand Football.\nThe Canadian team will play New Zealand in a Thursday group match at Geoffroy-Guichard Stadium in Saint-Etienne.\nParis 2024 will officially start with Friday's opening ceremony on the River Seine.\nThe football, archery and rugby events have begun before the ceremony.\nThe Paris Games are being held at 35 venues including Stade de France, Parc des Princes and Stade Roland-Garros throughout France.\nAthletes will not only compete in Paris but also at the sports venues around France and its territories.\n-- BERNAMA-ANADOLU\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial",

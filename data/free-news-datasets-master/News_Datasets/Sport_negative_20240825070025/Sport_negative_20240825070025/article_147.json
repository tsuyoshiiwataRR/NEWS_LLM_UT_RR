    "text": "In the second quarter of Joe Judge’s final game as Giants head coach in 2021, he made a curious play call that was later widely scrutinized and probably played a part in his ultimate firing.\nThe Giants were trailing 3-0 in the eventual 22-7 loss to the Washington Commanders when Judge called back-to-back quarterback sneaks inside the five-yard line.\nBUY GIANTS TICKETS:\nSTUBHUB, VIVID SEATS, TICKETMASTER\nOn Tuesday, former Giants receiver Alex Bachman responded to a video on X of the plays and recalled how stunned he was when he heard the call.\n“I thought i was concussed when i heard this play call in the huddle… i came off on the sideline looking around. I thought for sure i was tripping,”\nhe wrote.\nJudge defended his call after the game.\n“I wasn’t going to live through what happened last week in Chicago,” Judge said in reference to a Week 17 safety while playing the Bears. “We’re going to give ourselves room for the punt. We did that. We played the field-position situation I wanted to play.”\nJudge was fired following that loss to the Commanders after the Giants finished the season, 4-13.\nMORE GIANTS COVERAGE\nGiants training camp takeaways: Malik Nabers impresses, Daniel Jones looks less rusty, questions linger in secondary Giants avoid disaster with Jermaine Eluemunor’s injury — so what now for their overhauled offensive line?

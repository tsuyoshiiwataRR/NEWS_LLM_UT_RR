    "text": "Tony Khan is making his feelings known regarding WWE PR.\nAll Elite Wrestling President Tony Khan recently participated in the ROH Death Before Dishonor Media Call . When asked about the report that AEW’s new media rights deal with WBD has been agreed to in principle, Khan said that isn’t the case.\n“Well, we’re having great talks, it’s still in conversation,” Tony Khan said. “So I think that would be premature to say that we’re all set and done because that’s still what we’re working on. So we’re having great talks, including today. And we’ve had some great meetings with the executive team, Mr. Zaslav, Kathleen Finch, Bruce Campbell, and great people at Warner Bros Discovery.\n“They’ve put a lot of time in and had a lot of great meetings and conversations. So it’s still something we’re all working on together. So yeah, I think it would be premature to say that for sure. But also important to note that it’s a very good ongoing dialog that we’re having.”\nMoments later, Khan decided to reveal these reports had gotten out this week due to the PR department of WWE. Khan isn’t sure why they continue to involve themselves in things that don’t concern them.\n“You know it’s interesting, I don’t usually do this, but since Brandon brought it up and asked,” Tony Khan said. “I had a major member of the wrestling media mention to me yesterday. WWE is telling people that, and I don’t know why WWE is telling people about our media rights deal.\nTony Khan says AEW’s new media rights deal will have a big increase over the previous one “I don’t know whether it’s any of their business, I don’t really understand why WWE PR calls people and talks about my business. WWE PR is telling people that the deal is done and that the deal is done at the same level that it was gonna be our previous deal. That’s not the case.\n“I don’t know why WWE PR and why major wrestling media members, who are very credible and have never lied to me, I don’t know why they are telling people that. It’s none of their business. I think WWE PR really gets involved in a lot of things they shouldn’t get involved in. And I can tell you that is very untrue.\n“When we make a deal for AEW, it’s going to be a great deal with a big increase over what we’ve been doing. We’re in a really good position and we’ve been doing great business here despite what they’re trying to do to us.”\nREAD MORE: Tony Khan: Bryan Danielson Is Planning To Stay With Us For A Long Time\nWhat do you make of Tony Khan’s comments?

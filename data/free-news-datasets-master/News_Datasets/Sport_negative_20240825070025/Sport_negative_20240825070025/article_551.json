    "text": "The Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday issued a clarification regarding the news item published in the Daily FT on 25 July 2024, titled “Misery for Sri Lanka Under-19 Cricket Team Touring England.”\nWe categorically state that the information presented in the news item is incorrect. The Sri Lanka Under-19 Tour was organised under a reciprocal arrangement between Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), a common practice in international cricket.\nDuring this tour, the ECB provided player accommodation on a bed and breakfast basis, internal travel, match-day and practice day meals, security, and other logistical arrangements. An MOU signed between the two cricketing boards before the tour specified each other’s responsibilities during the tour.In addition, SLC provided a daily allowance for the players and support staff to cover any additional meals, such as lunch and dinner, if required. This allowance was paid for the entirety of the tour, irrespective of match days or non-match days, and the payments were made before the team embarked on the tour.\nAs with any international tour, SLC also provided the team manager with a contingency fund (“cash imprest”), which he could use as needed within his jurisdiction for meals or any other requirements.\nWhile the team is on tour, our International Cricket Department and its Head maintain daily communication with the team manager to monitor the tour’s status and provide any further support if needed; this is a constant practice followed by the department during every international tour, covering national men’s, women’s and age group teams. Furthermore, SLC has not received any complaints from the players or support staff about the situation described in the article. Neither the manager’s report submitted following the end of the tour nor the ‘Master in charge’ appointed by the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association, as per the guidelines of the Education Ministry, to accompany the Under-19 team and look after the welfare of the players, did not mention anything of this nature.\nWe wish to emphasise that SLC and the ECB have a strong relationship and have never encountered a situation like the one mentioned in the article, either during this tour or any other international tours conducted by both nations in the past.",

    "text": "Set pieces are a small but important part of football. Like an ever-loosening bolt in a car, a small thing which can have devastating consequences if not tended to. Tony Gustavsson, a man once credited for the USA women’s team’s set piece dominance, must have been tearing his David Bowie in Zoolander-esque hair out as he watched Marina Hegering and Lea Schuller nod home uncontested headers from corners as Australian defenders looked on in horror. Germany were solid but unspectacular in their 3-0 win over the Matildas in the early hours of Friday morning, but the game and result in itself was a paradox; the Matildas lost this game both because of set pieces, and not because of set pieces. The two goals they conceded at set pieces proved too large a deficit for Australia to overcome, but in their opening Olympics bout, they failed to throw a punch, not least land a blow. Chalking it up simply to a lack of Sam Kerr would be fingernail-deep analysis; even their talismanic skipper would have struggled to make an impact. Germany’s compact defensive shape blunted the Matildas’ attack, as they sat deep and easily soaked up their attacking pressure, their defenders relative spectators. Mary Fowler, the player the Matildas simply had to get on the ball, was isolated throughout the game, depending on scraps and unable to dictate proceedings centrally as the team looked to the wings for comfort. Cortnee Vine and Hayley Raso were ghosts, willing drifters but unable to leave any physical impact on proceedings, try as they might and even after Vine swapped to allow Caitlin Foord to play centrally, it was Foord drifting left to link up with Steph Catley which was their main attacking nexus. Ellie Carpenter and Catley grew into the game and provided the side’s best forays forward from full-back, which says something about the impact of those playing higher up the park. In games before the Olympics, Carpenter and Catley had inverted and shifted centrally to overload the middle of the pitch and drag defenders into places they did not want to go, but for the most part against Germany they hugged the touchline. There was more than one occasion where Raso and Carpenter were needlessly sharing the same space out wide, although when Carpenter did drift inside on the hour mark, it did open up space and lead to a chance. Either side of the set piece goals, Germany looked the more likely team to find the net, and Jule Brand gave the Matildas a taste of their own counter-attacking medicine, their third goal a free-flowing and wonderful riptose to the U-shaped possession Australia had made their own. The Germans played the game on their terms, doing what they needed to get the result while harnessing a healthy degree of control over proceedings. Mackenzie Arnold had little to do other than pick the ball out of her own net, although Alanna Kennedy and Clare Hunt were under duress at times, the latter looking uncharacteristically-unstable, perhaps a by-product of a late-season stress fracture in her foot. And now, the Matildas find themselves in a familiar backs-to-the-wall situation, their 3-0 defeat deflating their odds of progressing from the group stage. The heavy loss will put their hopes of going through as one of the best third-placed teams in jeopardy, with goal difference certain to play a pivotal role in progression. They are now pushing the sled uphill, and a big win over Zambia — a team who possess excellent threats in transition — is required to keep their dreams alive, before they face a USA outfit high on confidence. Gustavsson, whose contract expires at the end of the Olympics, will likely put a lot of emphasis on set piece defence ahead of their last two group games. But with last call at the last chance saloon approaching quicker than any Paris party-goers would like, he would do well to quickly find some fluidity and incisiveness in attack.",

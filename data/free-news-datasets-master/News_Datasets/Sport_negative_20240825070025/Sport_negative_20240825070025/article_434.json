    "text": "Sam Kerr has been watching from the sidelines since January / PATRICK HAMILTON/GettyImages Arguably, one of the biggest players missing from the tournament is Australia captain Sam Kerr.\nThe striker sustained an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during Chelsea's warm-weather training camp in Morocco back in January. Despite being sidelined for the long-term, there were glimmers of hope that she might make a return just in time to represent her country.\nHowever, when it came down to it, she was missing from Tony Gustavssonâ€™s 18-player squad in May. Her absence as a leader and goalscorer will no doubt be huge, as Australia look to fight their way onto the podium, after missing out at the previous Olympics in Tokyo and the World Cup last year.\nKerr has 64 goals for the Matildas and has been nominated for the Ballon d'Or. The pressure to hit the back of the net now falls to remaining forwards Caitlin Foord, Mary Fowler, Michelle Heyman and Cortnee Vine, who have an opportunity to become a hero for their country in the next fortnight.\nCatarina Macario (United States)\nCatarina Macario had to pull out last-minute / Robin Alam/ISI Photos/GettyImages Forward Catarina Macario was pulled from the United States squad with less than two weeks to go, after experiencing last-minute \"knee irritation\" before flying out to France.\nNew head coach Emma Hayes, who signed Macario for Chelsea in 2023, has said it's important for the player to return to London and recover, after only getting over an ACL injury in recent months.\nLynn Williams was named as Macario's replacement, while Emily Sams comes as one of four alternates. The departure of the 24-year-old is certainly a huge blow for USWNT, given how she ended the club season with Chelsea - five assists and one goal in her first eight WSL games.\nAli Riley (New Zealand)\nAli Riley has withdrawn on medical grounds / Kai Schwoerer/GettyImages New Zealand captain Ali Riley, who will turn 37 in October, was withdrawn from the squad, just a day before her country's opening match. Head coach Michael Mayne made the decision to replace Riley with Michaela Foster, citing medical grounds.\nThis would've been the versatile defender's fifth Olympics. But she may not get another chance\nAmy Sayer (Australia)\nThe 22-year-old ruptured her ACL in May / Gualter Fatia/GettyImages Amy Sayer ruptured her ACL in May, resulting in her having to pull out of the Olympics.\nThe Australian midfielder experienced the blow while playing for Sweden side Kristianstads DFF against Hammarby, and is now set to go through the lengthy rehabilitation process, with no timeframe yet given on her return to the game.\nThe 22-year-old has 11 caps and is a regular feature for the Matildas. When announcing her removal from the squad, Gustavsson said: \"Our priority will be supporting Amy and ensuring she is provided with care and assistance as she needs to navigate this challenging time.\"\nSydney Collins (Canada)\nSydney Collins misses out due to a leg fracture / Vaughn Ridley/GettyImages Sydney Collins was ruled out of her debut Olympics after sustaining a fracture to her left leg during a behind closed-doors training match against Nigeria earlier this month.\nGabrielle Carle has replaced the defender, while veteran Desiree Scott replaced Carle as an alternate.\nThe news came as an even harder blow for Collins, who sustained the injury in her first match back after recovering from a fracture to her right leg in 2024.",

    "text": "The [San Francisco Giants](/mlb/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-giants) placed infielder [Wilmer Flores](http://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/30627/wilmer-flores) on the 10-day injured list Thursday because of right knee tendonitis. The move was retroactive to Wednesday. In a corresponding move, the Giants recalled infielder David Villar from Triple-A Sacramento. \"He's a good hitter,\" Giants manager Bob Melvin said of Villar. \"He fits into this group. This will be a better opportunity for him here. He'll play the Wilmer role as far as facing lefties.\" Flores, 32, last played Tuesday. He had missed nine games with the same injury in late June and early July. \"Never really cleared up,\" Melvin said. \"When you're not playing as much and not swinging how you're used to, you're putting in a lot of extra work, and it's not allowing it to really heal.\" Flores is batting .206 with four home runs and 26 RBIs in 71 games this season. For his 12-year career, Flores is batting .260 with 153 homers and 532 RBIs in 1,212 games for the [New York Mets](/mlb/team/_/name/nym/new-york-mets) (2013-18), [Arizona Diamondbacks](/mlb/team/_/name/ari/arizona-diamondbacks) (2019) and Giants. Villar, 27, is 5-for-17 (.294) with one homer and four RBIs in six games with San Francisco. In parts of three seasons since 2022, he is batting .199 with 15 home runs and 40 RBIs in 104 games.",

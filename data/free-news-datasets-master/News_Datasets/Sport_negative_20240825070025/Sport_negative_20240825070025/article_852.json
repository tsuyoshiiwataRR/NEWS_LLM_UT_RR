    "text": "Just over a year ago, the Matildas began their home World Cup campaign with something close to a bang in front of 75,000 boisterous fans in Sydney as Steph Catley’s penalty secured a 1-0 win against the Republic of Ireland. The beginning of their 2024 Olympics campaign was far closer to a whimper, as in a less atmospheric Marseille, the Matildas wilted and melted away in a 3-0 defeat to Germany. It was never going to be an easy start to what is a difficult tournament, but the performance from Australia saw old problems rear their ugly head and new ones emerge. MORE: Matildas next match | Matildas Olympics draw Yes, Germany were a class above in a clinical and complete performance; their attack eventually hummed after taking time to find its rhythm, and their defence was rock solid. In isolation, a defeat to the fourth best team in the world and a side the Matildas haven’t defeated in 20 years is not necessarily a crisis, but the margin and manner of defeat will have sent alarm bells ringing. There was cautious optimism as injury concerns surrounding the team in the lead-up to the tournament came to nothing, as Steph Catley, Katrina Gorry and Caitlin Foord all lined up as coach Tony Gustavsson picked his strongest side possible, with Cortnee Vine leading the line and Mary Fowler being just behind her in a free-roaming role. That optimism faded as the game began and the Matildas attack quickly became bogged down in a manner all too familiar to fans, with Germany comfortably sitting in a lower block, denying the pacy Matildas attack any space in behind, as well as limiting Fowler’s influence on the game. The match continued a concerning trend where the Matildas couldn't find a way to get the supremely talented Fowler into the game, with the attacker limited to just 37 touches in a game where she often drifted far from dangerous positions in an attempt to exert her influence; it was a similar story for Foord and Vine, with the pair getting 31 and 14 touches respectively. Whilst the Matildas have many quality players in attacking positions, the lack of a world-class number nine outside of the injured Sam Kerr is a significant problem which has been highlighted in the superstar’s absences due to injury over the last 12 months, and out and out striker Michelle Heyman was only introduced into the game in the 77th minute when the result was secured for Germany. This issue isn’t new for Australia, what is new is the concerning concession of two goals from corners, as Australia’s usually solid defence looked suspect from open play and set pieces. Germany should have opened the scoring earlier than they did, with player of the match Jule Brand spurning two opportunities early on, though towering centre back Marina Hegering made no mistake as she evaded Ellie Carpenter and out-jumped Alanna Kennedy to score Germany’s first. Despite being outplayed and failing to get a shot on target in the first-half, the Matildas were only behind by a goal and showed a bit more intent after the break, but Germany continued to create the lion’s share of chances as the Matildas defence became more harried and desperate in their attempts to hold out their opponents, it seemed it would only be a matter of time before the dam burst. Two goals in four minutes did the trick for the Germans, as a near carbon copy of the first goal saw an unmarked Lea Schuller easily head home from a corner, before a slick counter-attack cut the Australia defence into ribbons and gave Brand a deserved goal from close range; Germany were only denied a fourth by the offside flag. Some Australian players can hold their heads high - Katrina Gorry put in a standout performance in her return from injury, and Heyman and Sharn Freier looked promising off the bench - but the scoreline and statistics were a fair reflection of the match, with Germany having 17 shots to Australia’s eight, and creating five big chances. Gustavsson admitted Germany deserved their win and lamented his side's defending of set pieces: “I don’t think we were ready for it… they were a class better than us tonight. It’s just fact. We need to be real and honest about that. Obviously a bit upset that they scored on two set pieces, which we had planned for exactly … we trained [for] it, we focused on it.” The result puts a question mark over the Matildas' credentials at the tournament; they face a mountain to climb if they are to finish in the top two, and their goal difference means their chances of finishing as one of the two best third-placed teams has taken a hit. They now face the prospect of needing a result against the USA to qualify, and even if they manage to do so, potential clashes against world champions Spain or host nation France await, and with the way the Matildas are performing, it is difficult to see them being a threat to sides of that calibre. Gustavsson and captain Steph Catley struck a defiant tone post-match, noting the Matildas had been in this position before in the World Cup after their defeat to Nigeria; back then Gustavsson made tactical tweaks leading them to top of the group and go on a magical run to the semi-finals. That could happen again, though this time Australia don’t have the prospect of a returning Kerr and more importantly a sold-out crowd backing them to the hilt. It all begs the question, is the Matildas Olympics campaign over before it began? Mathematically speaking it certainly isn’t, with the Matildas having a more than winnable match against Zambia next, yet the performances and recurring problems make it hard to be confident in the Matildas chances of making another deep run at the tournament.",

    "text": "But after posting an off-season training video to her 100,000 followers on Instagram and more than 500,000 on Facebook, she decided to call out the abuse to prove a point.\\u003cbr\\u003eFerling has been inundated with support after taking to social media this week to highlight an issue that almost all female athletes face. It all started with a simple photo of her bowling at Meteors training at Chisholm. The video has been viewed 314,000 times, but one man took offence to Ferling's training.The social media troll clearly doesn't care for the Meteors, the Australian women's cricket team, the Matildas, the Opals, the Diamonds, the AFLW, the NRLW or any of the other elite competitions.Ferling took it in her stride but said the abuse was common. In fact, she said most men like to mansplain her bowling action and suggest changes she should make to her technique.\\u003cbr\\u003eFerling has a big social media following as she juggles work as a television commentator for Channel Seven and multiple gigs as an MC with her Meteors duties. Copping abuse has become far too common along the way.\\u003cbr\\u003eCanberra AFL star \\u003cb\\u003eTom Green\\u003c/b\\u003e has been hit with a breach notice by the AFL for his scathing assessment of the AFL's crackdown on dangerous tackles.Bedford was eventually cleared by the AFL Appeals Board. Green's comments went live, but were then taken down on Friday last week.The verbal lashing from one of the game's rising stars (Green will be a Brownlow contender for years to come) made ears prick up at the AFL, which is saying something given he's based in western Sydney and the Giants rarely rate a mention in Melbourne.After reviewing the comments, the AFL deemed Green had breached rule 19.18 (c) - excessive, unfair or unreasonable public comment and criticism).The dangerous tackle crackdown has caused plenty of uproar in AFL circles. But while many may have agreed with Marist College graduate Green, the AFL said it was unacceptable.The NRL has been overwhelmed at the keenness from Canberra fans who are desperate to see their team play in an international arena in the opening round next year.The colour-rush concept has been used for several years and is usually when a team's outfit is all one colour. So the Raiders v Warriors, for example, might be all green v all black playing strips.Raiders fans have also jumped at the opportunity to fly out of Canberra, with one Fiji Airways plan sold out for the Tuesday before the game.How much is the Vegas dream? Fans are shelling out thousands for flights and accommodation. As for tickets, members were able to start buying them this week. The cheapest was $A45 and the most expensive in the stands was $309.Reigning premiers Tuggeranong will be hoping for back-to-back titles on Sunday when they take on Canberra in the State League Division 1 netball grand final.Tuggeranong is confident going in, with only one loss all season. The last time the two teams met back in June Tuggeranong won 51-42. Canberra finished the regular season in third place, with only five wins from 12 games, but surprised Arawang in the preliminary final last weekend, winning 42-37. Grand final day also features the Division 2 match-up between Canberra and Arawang at 11am and the Men's League decider between South Canberra and Arawang at 1pm before the main game at 3pm.The State League grand final will be held at the Netball ACT headquarters in Lyneham. Entry is free with doors opening at 10am. In other netball news, the ACT will also take part in Netball Australia's pilot First Nations Tournament this September featuring under-23 aged teams from all states and territories. The three-day tournament hopes to provide accelerated and equitable opportunities for First Nations participants in netball. The game's governing model will take over the Brumbies' operational duties on August 1, leaving just five days to put the structures in place for a new board.Under the plan that divided the Canberra rugby community, Rugby Australia will take charge of the Super Rugby side of the Brumbies will community rugby will be split out and operate under the ACT Rugby Union board.In the past, the ACT Rugby Union stakeholders have elected the board of directors for the Brumbies. The changes coming in will see Rugby Australia appoint the majority of the board of the new organisational set up.He was retained while the Brumbies negotiated with Rugby Australia and because the club could not file its financial report until it had reached a deal with Rugby Australia.Given the new board will have a new constitution, Nobbs could conceivably continue. Whether he wants to - and to endure those sleepless nights and thankless tasks - is another thing.Nobbs has been crucial to the Brumbies' survival - first through COVID, and then ongoing battles with Rugby Australia. He brokered the deal with RA to ensure the Brumbies would remain in Canberra.Brumbies games record holder and current board member \\u003cb\\u003eBen Alexander\\u003c/b\\u003e continues to do great things in retirement. But after all these years, the last place he expected to be was back at the University of Canberra - his old haunt when he was a battling student unsure if rugby would be a career.Alexander has been a real driver in helping Running for Resilience's continued growth and now they have partnered with the university to promote student wellbeing at an event on Friday morning.The fun run will start at The Coffee Grounds on the university campus.Canberra runner \\u003cb\\u003eJarrett Anthoney\\u003c/b\\u003e will hit a special milestone when he competes in his 11\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e City to Surf on August 11.After racing for the first time in 2013, Anthoney is on the verge of breaking through the $100,000 barrier in terms of money raised for the Sydney Children's Hospital Foundation.\\u003cbr\\u003eAnthoney's younger sister died after a battle with brain cancer when she was just 11 years old. It prompted him to start the \\u003cb\\u003eDainere's Rainbow\\u003c/b\\u003e charity.\\u003cbr\\u003e",

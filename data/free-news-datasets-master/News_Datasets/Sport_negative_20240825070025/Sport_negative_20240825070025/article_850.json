    "text": "The [Olympics 2024](https://www.insidesport.in/olympics/tournaments/paris-olympics/) boxing draw is finally out a day prior to when the event begins, and it might not be the best news for the Indian pugilists, hoping to get a medal for the country. For starters, India’s two-time World Champion in the women’s 50 kg event, Nikhat Zareen has been handed a particularly tough draw, as she will be up against another World Championships gold medalist, China’s Wu Yu, in the second round. Tough Boxing Draw for Nikhat Zareen & Lovlina Borgohain Nikhat Zareen isn’t the only boxer at the receiving end of a tricky draw, as the 2020 Olympics’ bronze medalist in the 75 kg category, Lovlina Borgohain could be up against Li Qian of China in the second round. Whereas in the women’s 54 kg category, Jaismine Lamboria will face a hurdle in the form of Tokyo silver winner, Nesthy Petecio of the Philippines in the first round. That’s not the end. Preeti Pawar, the boxer in the women’s 54 kg category will be up against World Championships finalist Arias Castenada of Colombia in the second round. Tricky for Amit Panghal & Nishant Dev The Indian men’s boxers have been struggling to win in the last couple of years, and they have tricky draws too. 51 kg pugilist Amit Panghal, who was ousted in the first round in Tokyo 2020, will be up against African Games winner Patrick Chinyemba. On the other hand, Nishant Dev in the 71 kg division will be up against Jose Gabriel of Ecuador.",

    "text": "By Anthony Pasciolla ,\n50 minutes ago\nPaul George is a streaky superstar, thriving as an MVP candidate at his best and finding himself one of the most criticized players at his worst.\nThe Philadelphia 76ers star dealt with this problem none more than during his tenure with the Los Angeles Clippers. His injury problems placed a target on his back for hatred, leading to numerous poor moments in the NBA playoffs.\nHis former Clippers teammate Patrick Beverley recently compared the difference between criticizing George for these mistakes and retired Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams.\n“Me and Lou Will. Ay where the [expletive] you today, man? I need you right now. 'Man, Pat, I ain't all the way here.' Ight cool, I need you to score buckets. Have my back because I'm putting all this energy into trying to save your [expletive],\" Beverley said on his podcast.\nThis comfort level with a teammate is a valued trait for NBA teams, as it further allows players to grow.\n\"I go to PG, 'Ay P, you missed man, but that [expletive] looks good! It was in and out!' My approach was different,\" Beverley shared. \"[If I say] ‘Ay PG, make some mother [expletive] shots, bro! Hold your mother [expletive] form! Be disciplined!’ Nuh uh.\"\nIt's understandable that each individual responds differently to constructive criticism, but responding in a strong manner feels like a must in the NBA.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

DeGroote Updated Jul 25, 2024 at 9:41pm Getty Images The Cleveland Browns are already dealing with injuries to key players, including Greg Newsome and Dalvin Tomlinson.\nThe Cleveland Browns will be without cornerback Greg Newsome for a chunk of training camp and potentially the start of the season as he recovers from hamstring surgery.\nNewsome injured his hamstring during a workout away from the facility. The Browns put Newsome on the non-football injury list before camp and provided some more details on Thursday, July 25.\n“Hopefully have (Newsome) back for Week 1 but I’ll have more of an update as we get closer,” Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski said .\nThe Browns started training camp this week at The Greenbrier in West Virginia. Cleveland star cornerback Denzel Ward said that Newsome’s presence has been missed.\n“Yeah, man, it hurt,” Ward said . “Greg’s a big energy guy for the team, a leader for this team and a great player out there on the field, so we’re just looking forward to getting him back as soon as possible, but just wishing him the best. But yeah, it definitely, definitely hurt though, him being out.”",

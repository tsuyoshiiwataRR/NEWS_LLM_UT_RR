    "text": "Kentucky MBB season ticket prices increase LEXINGTON, Ky. – Most seating sections for Kentucky Men’s Basketball season ticket holders will see price increases for the first time since the 2019-2020 season. The areas where prices will go up are in the lower bowl, chairback areas of the upper bowl, and select bleachers areas in the upper bowl.

The most significant adjustments are in the premium seating areas near the court, including the sideline risers, and in the first four permanent rows along both lower-level sidelines. - 13% of season ticket holders will experience no increase - 64% of season ticket holders will experience an approximate 5% increase - 16% of season ticket holders will experience an approximate 12% increase - 7% of season ticket holders will experience an approximate 25% or higher increase Season ticket renewals for the 2024-25 Kentucky men’s basketball season are now available to all season ticket holders.

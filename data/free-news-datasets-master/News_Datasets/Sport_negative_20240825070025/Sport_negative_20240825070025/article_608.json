    "text": "Drone Spying Scandal Rocks Canadian Women's Soccer The Canadian Olympic Committee has suspended head coach Bev Priestman following a drone spying scandal revealed by Canada Soccer. Assistant coach Andy Spence will lead the women's squad for the rest of the Paris games. The scandal has cast a shadow over the team's Olympic endeavors. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 26-07-2024 05:38 IST | Created: 26-07-2024 05:38 IST The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) removed head coach Bev Priestman on Thursday following her suspension by Canada Soccer over a drone spying scandal that has thrust the 2020 Olympic gold medallists into an unsavory global spotlight. The Canadian women's squad will be led by assistant coach Andy Spence for the remainder of the Paris games, the COC said. \"Over the past 24 hours, additional information has come to our attention regarding previous drone use against opponents, predating the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,\" Canada Soccer CEO & General Secretary Kevin Blue said in an emailed statement. \"In light of these new revelations, Canada Soccer has made the decision to suspend Women's National Team Head Coach, Bev Priestman for the remainder of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, and until the completion of our recently announced independent external review.\" Canada defeated New Zealand 2-1 in their Paris Olympics opening game on Thursday, a match which Priestman voluntarily sat out after the spying scandal broke this week. Priestman apologized to the New Zealand players for what had happened and said ultimate responsibility lay with her. \"This does not represent the values that our team stands for. I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our program.\" (With inputs from agencies.)",

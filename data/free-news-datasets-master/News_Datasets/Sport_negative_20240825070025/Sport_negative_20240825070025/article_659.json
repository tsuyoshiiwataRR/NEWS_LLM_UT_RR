    "text": "Mark Briscoe blasted Jack Perry in the head with an\nunprotected chair shot during last night’s Blood & Guts match in the main event of AEW Dynamite. A lot of people in the world of pro wrestling are talking about why this was allowed to happen and whether the chair was gimmicked or not.\nAEW President Tony Khan was naturally asked about the controversial spot during today’s call with the media ahead of Friday night’s (July 26) Death Before Dishonor pay-per-view event.\nHere is the question asked by Jason Powell of\nProWrestling.net, followed by Khan’s response:\nPowell: “[There have been] unprotected chair shots to the head in pro wrestling lately, including one on last night’s Dynamite show. And I know you’ve had Chris Nowinski in to deliver seminars about head trauma. And I’m sure you’re aware of the damage of CTE given your status as a member of an NFL ownership family. So, what is your stance on unprotected chair shots? Is there something being done to gimmick these chairs that in your mind makes it okay?”\nKhan: “It’s a great question, and it was a very nuanced question. There’s a couple of different things in there, and I think the nuance you added to it made it an even better series of questions.\n...I love that we analyze the mechanics of pro wrestling and the things going on. I do like to leave some of the art of this and some of the kayfabe of this in the wrestling, and I think that’s the best way to do it.\nBut I thought it was a great match. Everybody came out of it in great shape, all things considered. I mean, everyone is beat up bad, but to be honest, this is probably the least major injuries we’ve ever had coming out of a Blood & Guts match, or one of these very brutal multi-man death matches. And I’m glad everyone’s gonna be okay. It’s a really beat up group, but all things considered, came out very well.\nI think it’s a great question. I don’t think all these spots are created equal. There’s different spots, different ways to do things. I don’t want to compare apples to oranges, necessarily. I think it’s a great question. There’s definitely some mystery to be left to how things are done, and how things might be done now might not be the same way they would be done 25 years ago, just to do the same spots, for example. But I think it was a great nuanced question, and I appreciate you asking. Thanks, Jason.”\nRather than directly explain how (or if) the chair shot to Perry’s head was safely done, Tony danced around the topic and hid behind the veil of pro wrestling kayfabe secrets. Tony claimed it was a great question around four or five different times, but he apparently wasn’t too interested in providing a similarly great answer to it.\nYou don’t have to go back 25 years ago to find an example of why this is an important question to ask that should be given a proper answer. As my colleague M. G0MEZ pointed out\nearlier today, it was just five years ago in AEW when Cody Rhodes was legitimately injured by an unprotected chair shot to the head delivered by Shawn Spears, who was using a gimmicked chair.\nTony Khan put the blame on Spears at the time, calling it “\npilot error.” A follow-up report indicated the spot would be banned in AEW going forward, but that’s apparently not the case based on what happened at Blood & Guts. At least, that’s the conclusion left to be drawn as long as AEW doesn’t address how the Blood & Guts head shot was any different from the Spears/Rhodes incident, aside from perhaps the lack of pilot error.\nWhat’s your reaction to Khan’s comments on the Blood & Guts unprotected chair shot to Jack Perry’s head? Do you think it’s okay for wrestlers to use gimmicked chairs for unprotected shots to the head?\nGive me your thoughts in the comments below, Cagesiders.",

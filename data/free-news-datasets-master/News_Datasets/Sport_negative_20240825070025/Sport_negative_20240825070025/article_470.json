    "text": "By Benedetto Vitale ,\n7 hours ago The Dallas Cowboys have several key players in need of a new contract by next season, one of them being star quarterback Dak Prescott. While talking with the media, Prescott hinted at a potential departure from Dallas.\nPrescott made it clear that he wants to remain with the Cowboys for the long haul. But he is also being realistic about his contract situation, according to Jett Beachum of CBS News Texas. The business aspect of the NFL could ultimately play a role in Prescott's future in the league.\n\"I want to be here, but when you look up -- all the great quarterbacks I watched played for other teams. ... That's not something to fear. It may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision.\"\nPrescott, who will turn 31 on July 29, is due to hit free agency after the 2024 season. He can certainly continue playing at a high level for several more years.\nWith that said, Jerry Jones and the Cowboys have difficult decisions to make. Prescott isn't the only player on the roster in need of an extension, as wide receiver CeeDee Lamb is also in the final year of his contract. Linebacker Micah Parsons has a strong case for a payday as well. And then there's coach Mike McCarthy, who is not under contract beyond 2024.\nDallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott (4) reacts during the first half against the Green Bay Packers for the 2024 NFC wild card game at AT&T Stadium. Â© Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports\nPrescott has been a relatively consistent quarterback throughout his career. He doesn't turn the ball over much, and the Cowboys have been successful with him leading the way. But the franchise is starving for a Super Bowl, as Dallas hasn't won a championship since the 1995 season.\nGiven his public comments, it's unclear what Jones and the Cowboys plan to do about Prescott's contract. For all we know, he could be hitting the free agency market next offseason. But if he has another stellar season, Dallas may feel it's necessary to re-sign him at a massive price tag.\nRelated: Rich Eisen Turns Heads Naming NFL's Top 5 Sleeper Teams, Surprise Playoff Prediction\nRelated: Titans QB Will Levis is Blowing Minds With 'Impressive' Development at Training Camp\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

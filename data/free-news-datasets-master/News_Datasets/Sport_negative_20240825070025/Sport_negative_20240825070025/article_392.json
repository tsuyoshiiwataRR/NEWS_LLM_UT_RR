    "text": "The Brickyard 400 race had many wrecks during the race, but none more impactful than Kyle Busch’s. Corey LaJoie hit Busch from the back on the lap 121 restart, which called for the caution flag that helped Kyle Larson win the race. Since that incident, Kyle Busch [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/kyle-busch/] has left no stone unturned in expressing how upset he is with LaJoie for costing him points in the race. Things have gotten pretty intense as Kyle Busch is unhappy with the outcome and LaJoie has been put under fire. LaJoie has already admitted to being at fault and managed to get away without a penalty after a conversation with NASCAR. But that was not the end of it, as many fans and critics came to take Busch’s side in the feud. Corey LaJoie, on the other hand, has taken accountability and is fighting off all the hate heading his way on social media. But it was only when Kyle Busch made his way to the Pat McAfee Show to put LaJoie on blast that the Spire Motorsports [https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nascar/spire-motorsports/] driver had to give a response. KYLE BUSCH HAS NOT SPOKEN TO COREY LAJOIE AFTER THE RACE When Ryan Flores spoke on the Stacking Pennies Podcast with Corey LaJoie, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg2UEqBUhQ4] they spoke about the most pressing matter at hand, the huge crash. After revealing that there is no penalty at hand, LaJoie stated, “Certainly, there’s a lot of collateral damage from that incident. It was certainly a mistake on my part, but I felt like it was put to bed.” Despite it being quite a big incident, Corey LaJoie managed to walk out of this without any penalties. Corey LaJoie [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/corey-lajoie/] was upset that he became the reason for such a major incident and explained, “I tried calling Kyle Busch twice. I left him a message and texted him. He didn’t seem too keen on a chat. I called RC; he didn’t seem too keen on a chat either.” Flores asked the No. 7 Chevrolet Camaro if he managed to speak to Richard Childress to which he responded saying, “No, and then I talked to Randall Burnett for a little while on the phone.” When Kyle Busch went on the Pat McAfee show, he went all ham on LaJoie for ruining his race. But when LaJoie heard about this, he explained on the podcast, “I will say this: It’s a natural tendency when you have, like, what’s the saying? An axe to grind? Yeah, oh yeah. If you have an axe to grind and a microphone in front of your face, it is intoxicating to just start going.” NASCAR is an aggressive sport and the adrenaline levels are always high. That’s why LaJoie continued to explain, “And I’ve done it, and my natural tendency is to keep doing it. Uh, but I usually try to stop you. I know, and I’m going to stop now because I’m going to prefer to try to de-escalate the situation.” LaJoie continued, “He goes on there, talks about Ricky, and talks about me, which are the two latest things to add to the woeful and dreadful season that is the 8-car. For what we’re accustomed to seeing out of Kyle Busch, the top five greatest drivers of all time, I think that was probably the last match to really flick off into his haystack and light it up. And he just happened to take the mic and drag my name across the media.” [https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20200822000618/Corey-LaJoie.jpg] As Kyle Busch went all in while expressing his feelings of frustration, many fans joined in on targeting LaJoie. The incident causer has faced a lot of backlash online for wrecking Busch’s car and here is what he had to say about it. COREY LAJOIE MUST KEEP A LEVEL HEAD Corey LaJoie continued to explain everything that the fans were saying to him for wrecking the 2 time Cup series [https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nascar/nascar-cup-series/] champion. He mentioned that people started to reach out to him saying, “Hey man, we’re thinking about you. Don’t let it get you down. I’m like, I really don’t know what you guys are talking about. I don’t see any of it.” Ryan Flores pitches in to say, “You got roasted on social media last week, which is a big change because, usually, what are people going to tell me that I haven’t heard before? ‘You suck; you’ve never won. Corey LaJoke'” Despite getting such reactions from fans, LaJoie is keeping his head up and maintaining his calm as he explained on the podcast. Spire Motorsports driver Corey LaJoie [https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022-02-16T183213Z_1147076085_MT1USATODAY17698230_RTRMADP_3_NASCAR-DAYTONA-500-MEDIA-DAY.jpg]Feb 16, 2022; Daytona, FL, USA; Feb 16, 2022; Daytona, FL, USA; NASCAR Cup Series driver Corey LaJoie (7) talks to the press during Daytona 500 media day at Daytona International Speedway. Mandatory Credit:Mandatory Credit: Mike Dinovo-USA TODAY Sports The backlash where fans are getting personal on his achievements does not bother him as he explains and that’s what he expects from a driver who races in one of the most dangerous motorsport events on the planet. That being said, what do you think of Kyle Busch’s reaction to getting wrecked by Corey LaJoie, do you think his statements are justified? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.",

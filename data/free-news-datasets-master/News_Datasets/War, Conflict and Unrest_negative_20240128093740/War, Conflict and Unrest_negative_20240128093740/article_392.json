    "text": "The Ukrainian missile strike that dramatically blew up the Russian navy landing ship Novocherkask in the port of Feodosia in southeastern Crimea on Tuesday also sank another vessel: the old training ship UTS-150.\nUTS-150 was a 70-year-old antique. A former oceangoing minesweeper that, after 12 years hunting mines, spent a decade as a test platform before settling into her training role way back in 1976.\nThe 190-foot, 600-ton vessel was moored near Novocherkask when, on Tuesday morning, Ukrainian air force Sukhoi Su-24 bombers struck the landing ship with either British-made Storm Shadow cruise missiles or similar, French-made SCALP-EGs.\nThe missile strikes sparked a blaze that later triggered a secondary explosion. The Russian Black Sea Fleet apparently was using Novocherkask to haul ammunition to Russian ground forces in southern Ukraine. On Tuesday morning the landing ship reportedly had 4,700 artillery shells and rocket rounds in her hold.\nThose rounds exploded with the force of at least 30 tons of TNT , disintegrating Novocherkask , damaging buildings across Feodosia and sinking UTS-150 at her mooring. In satellite imagery from after the Ukrainian strike, the training vessel’s deckhouse is visible poking above the water.\nIt was an ignominious end for a storied ship. UTS-150 launched at the shipyard in Kerch, in Russia just east of Crimea, in 1953. She was one of more than 200 T-43-class minesweepers the Soviet navy built between 1948 and 1955. The Chinese and Polish navies built their own copies under license.\nThey were simple, versatile ships. Equipped with radar and sonar, initially sailing with twin 37-millimeter guns and eventually adding twin 25-millimeter guns as well as depth charges and mine racks, the T-43s could do more than sweep for mines. The diesel-powered vessels also could lay mines, hunt submarines and perform basic patrol duties.\nIt’s not for no reason that a few T-43s remained active in fleets outside of Russia as late as 2015. In Russia, any surviving T-43s most likely strictly are training ships.\nUTS-150 was 16 years into her own training career when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. It seems the old ship remained behind in Feodosia after the Russian Black Sea Fleet departed—and still was there when the Black Sea Fleet returned following the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014.\nWhether the Black Sea Fleet actively was training sailors aboard UTS-150 at the time of her sinking is unclear. She at least was intact and afloat—until Novocherkask ’s explosion sent her to the seafloor.\nDavid Axe",

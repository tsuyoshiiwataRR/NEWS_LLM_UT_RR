This Thursday, Israeli forces bombed cities and refugee camps from the north to the south of the Gaza Strip and killed dozens of Palestinians, with Israel determined to redouble an almost three-month offensive against the Islamist Hamas movement that has expanded to almost the entire territory and displaced several thousand civilians, amid new UN warnings over the humanitarian crisis in the enclave. The conflict has already left more than 21,000 Palestinians dead and expelled about 85% of the 2.3 million inhabitants of their homes from their homes. Gaza. Much of the north of the territory was devastated by aerial bombardments and urban fighting, and has been largely depopulated and isolated from the rest for weeks.

Time for a humanitarian [#ceasefire] [@UNRWA] [pic.twitter.com/sC9lhYRjq7] — Thomas White (@TomWhiteGaza) [December 26, 2023] Israel said this week that will expand its combined air and ground offensive to a third sector, the center of the Gaza Stripafter attacking refugee camps there by air and bringing troops and tanks closer to them, after opening a second front of combat in the southern city of Khan Yunis at the beginning of December.

Thomas White, UNRWA Gaza Affairs Directoron social network X, and added that “40% of the population is already at risk of suffering from famine.” Israel has promised to dismantle Hamas to prevent it from launching attacks again like those on October 7, when militants from the group infiltrated from Gaza killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped another 240, including about twenty Argentines. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuhas rejected international calls for a ceasefire, believing this would be a “gift” to Hamas and instead vowed to intensify the offensive until the group is destroyed and the hostages still held captive are recovered. after 105 were released last month during a truce.

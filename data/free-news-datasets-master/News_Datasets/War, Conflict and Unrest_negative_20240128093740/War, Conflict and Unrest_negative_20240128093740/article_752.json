    "text": "2023-12-28 22:44:15\nAccording to information from Damascus, Israel has again attacked areas in Syria. The Syrian state news agency Sana, citing military sources, reported late yesterday evening that the Israeli military had attacked “the southern region” from the air.\nThe attacks came from the direction of the Golan Heights, which was annexed by Israel. The Syrian air defense intercepted some of the missiles fired, it said. There was property damage.\nThe London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that areas near Damascus airport were also hit by Israeli missiles. The Israeli military is currently checking the information.\nIranian general killed in Syria\nIsrael’s air force repeatedly bombs targets in neighboring Syria. Israel wants to prevent its arch-enemy Iran and its allied militias from expanding their military influence in Syria. On Monday, Sejed-Rasi Mousavi, a senior member of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, was killed in a suspected Israeli airstrike in a suburb of the Syrian capital Damascus. The military leadership of the Islamic Republic then vowed revenge.\n1703806202\n#Israeli #attacks #targets #Syria",

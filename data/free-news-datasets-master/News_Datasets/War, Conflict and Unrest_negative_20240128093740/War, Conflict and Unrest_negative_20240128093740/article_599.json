People take a rest at a monastery-turned-temporary shelter for internally displaced people (IDP) in Lashio, Shan state on November 15, 2023. – Fighting has raged across Myanmar’s northern Shan state for more than two weeks after an alliance of ethnic minority groups launched a surprise offensive against the military. (Photo by STRINGER / AFP)\nChina’s embassy in Myanmar on Thursday asked its citizens to leave a northern district along the countries’ shared border, citing heightened security risks as ethnic minority armed groups battle the junta.\nFighting has raged across Myanmar’s northern Shan state since October, when the so-called “Three Brotherhood Alliance” of ethnic minority groups launched an offensive against the military.\nThe alliance has seized several towns and border hubs vital for trade with China in what analysts say is the biggest military challenge to the junta since it seized power in 2021.\nThe Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), one member of the brotherhood alliance, has vowed to recapture Laukkai town, located in a district bordering China that is run by a military-aligned militia and notorious for gambling, prostitution and online scams.\n“The conflicts in Laukkai district of Kokang, northern Myanmar continue, and safety risks have escalated for people stranded there,” the embassy said on WeChat.\nRead more Chinese chess rocked by cheating rumours, bad behaviour scandal ALSO READ: Trafficking victims in Myanmar forced to sell organs: charity\n“The Chinese Embassy in Myanmar once again reminds Chinese citizens in Laukkai district to evacuate as soon as possible.”\nMedia affiliated with the MNDAA said this week that Myanmar’s junta had carried out airstrikes in the self-administered Kokang region that surrounds Laukkai and shelled parts of the town.\nAFP has contacted an MNDAA spokesperson for comment.\nEarlier this month, Beijing said it had mediated talks between the military and the allied ethnic armed groups and reached an agreement for a “temporary ceasefire”.\nBut clashes have continued in parts of Shan state, with another member of the alliance, the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, claiming to have captured two more towns in recent days.\nALSO READ: More than 500 Rohingya refugees land in Indonesia\nChina’s foreign ministry on Thursday described the situation in Kokang as “grim and complicated”.\n“China has always believed that maintaining momentum for a ceasefire and peace talks is in the interests of all relevant parties in Myanmar,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.\nAnalysts say Beijing maintains ties with ethnic armed groups in northern Myanmar, some of whom share close ethnic and cultural links with China and use Chinese currency and phone networks in the territory they control.\nBeijing is also a major arms supplier and ally of the junta, but relations have been strained in recent months over the junta’s failure to crack down on online scam compounds in Myanmar that Beijing says target Chinese citizens.\nProtesters gathered for a rare demonstration in Yangon last month to accuse China of backing the ethnic minority alliance, in what analysts say was a move sanctioned by junta authorities.\nALSO READ: UN says more than 200,000 people displaced in recent Myanmar fighting\n– By: © Agence France-Presse\nRead more on these topics China myanmar Catch up with the latest news from The Citizen on WhatsApp by following our channel.

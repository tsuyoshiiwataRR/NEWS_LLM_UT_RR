    "text": "Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday ordered a \"defensive action\" in the Atlantic Ocean following the arrival of a British warship off the coast of Guyana. The country's vice president, Bharrat Jagdeo, soon denied \"plans for offensive action\" against its neighbors, who claim sovereignty over the Essequibo, a jungle territory rich in minerals and oil. \"These are routine measures that are planned for a long time, they are part of building defense capacity. We don't plan to invade Venezuela, President Maduro knows that. We have no plans to take offensive action against Venezuela,\" Jagdeo added.\nMaduro, who has spoken out about the territorial conflict during his end-of-year message, has described the presence of the British Navy ship as a \"threat [...] against peace and sovereignty.\" His Government had also denounced it as an act of \"hostile provocation\" and a violation of bilateral agreements signed in mid-December in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. A couple of weeks of apparent calm followed the meeting between Presidents Maduro and Irfaan Ali, organized by Brazil with the support of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) countries, to defuse the escalation of tensions between Venezuela and Guyana over the sovereignty of the Essequibo.\nThe Venezuelan Foreign Ministry has said in a statement that the arrival of the military ship HMS Trent is \"extremely serious\" and adds to the statements of Guyana's allies in the territorial conflict such as the United Kingdom and the United States. \"Venezuela urges the Guyana authorities to take immediate action for the removal of the vessel and refrain from further involvement of military powers in the territorial dispute.\"\nThe Venezuelan Armed Forces announced the operational deployment of 5,600 officers to the country's Atlantic façade, which includes disputed territorial waters. \"We are going with the best disposition, with the best attitude of a trained combatant to guard Venezuelan territory and exercise sovereignty,\" said Ashraf Suleiman Gutierrez, head of the Strategic Insular Maritime Defense Region. The beginning of the mobilization of ocean patrol boats, ships, missile boats, F-16 and Sukhoi fighter planes, amplifed and air defense vehicles, among other equipment, authorized live by Maduro dressed in military fatigues, was broadcast on television.\nIn the midst of an internal gale after the primaries in which the Venezuelan opposition closed ranks around candidate María Corina Machado, Maduro has dusted off a two-century-old conflict with Guyana over the possession of the Essequibo, an extensive territory of 160,000 square kilometers, five times the area of Belgium, with significant mineral and oil wealth. On maps from 1777 the border of the Captaincy General of Venezuela included this area. But it was British Guiana, and then independent Guiana, that ended up occupying this territory. After the Paris Arbitral Award of 1899, a document considered rigged by Venezuela, Guyana's border was moved westward to keep that portion within its boundaries. For decades, this controversy was being mediated at the behest of the United Nations within the framework of the Geneva Agreement of 1966 and five years ago it led to the International Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction to settle this conflict is rejected by Venezuela.\nA day after the opposition primaries that mobilized more than two million Venezuelans, Maduro announced a referendum for December 3 in which the annexation of the Essequibo was approved with a turnout that has been called into question, due to the little mobilization that was seen in the streets and the absence of disaggregated results on the votes. Alarm bells went off in Latin America and were even discussed at an informal session of the UN Security Council. Despite this, Maduro fled forward and appointed authorities in the region, ordered the identification of its citizens and decreed a new map of the country with the Essequibo. Guyana, which in recent years has granted oil concessions in disputed waters, also followed the gunpowder with the raising of its country's flag in the disputed sector and the mobilization of its allies in the field of diplomacy.\nThis is a latent tension that could be politically managed by Chavismo, according to several analysts, to suspend the 2024 presidential elections to which it would go at a disadvantage if it is forced to comply with the democratic guarantees demanded by the international community, under the argument that an escalation with Guyana would force it to declare a state of emergency.\nAfter the meeting in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on December 14, the parties agreed to continue dialogue and avoid taking measures that would further complicate the situation. The small Caribbean country also served for the exchange of U.S. prisoners a couple of weeks later for businessman Alex Saab, arrested for money laundering in the United States, who points out that he is a front man for senior officials of the Maduro government, and that Venezuela claims him as a diplomat. The issue of the Essequibo, on which the government deployed an intense propaganda campaign, seemed buried for a few weeks with the new moves made on the negotiating board that Chavismo maintains with the United States, which has relaxed sanctions, so that Maduro can move towards competitive elections in 2024 such as the possible authorization of Machado to compete freely. a matter on which a Supreme Court decision is expected this last week of 2023, when the waters between Venezuela and Guyana seem to be churning again\nFollow all the international news on Facebook and X , or in our weekly newsletter .",

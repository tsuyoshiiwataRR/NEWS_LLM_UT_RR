    "text": "Dressed in black, holding swaddled fake babies, hundreds of protesters took part in a symbolic funeral procession through New York's iconic avenues on Thursday to demand a ceasefire and an end to Israel's devastating bombardment of Gaza. To the sound of drums, the procession silently followed a \"Ceasefire Now\" banner to Times Square, one of the beating hearts of Manhattan, a neighborhood known for its giant advertising screens and popular with tourists. Demonstrators also held photos of Palestinian children who had died in Gaza.\n\"We want to draw attention to the fact that to date, nearly 10,000 children, if you count only children, have been killed in Gaza, because of this horrific bombing and assault, which continues unabated,\" said Grace Lile, a 64-year-old archivist. Since the beginning of the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip, following the bloody attack launched on October 7 by Hamas, New York has lived to the rhythm of actions in support of the Palestinians or Israel. These protests included Jewish Hanukkah and Catholic Christmas celebrations in the multicultural megacity of 8.5 million people.\nHundreds of demonstrators took part in a symbolic funeral procession in New York on Thursday to demand a ceasefire and an end to Israel's devastating bombardment of Gaza. CHARLY TRIBALLEAU / AFP\n'The humanity of the people of Gaza' A total of 21,320 people, mostly women, children and teenagers, have been killed in Gaza since the start of Israeli military operations, according to the Hamas Health Ministry, which has ruled the Palestinian territory under Israeli blockade for 16 years. In Israel, the October 7 attack killed about 1140,250 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. About 129 people were kidnapped by Hamas, <> of whom remain in Gaza custody.\nStephen Yankou, a 39-year-old school teacher, said he hoped \"the march can speak to people and force them to face the humanity of the people of Gaza, the Palestinians, and everyone in the region, all peoples.\" The protesters also hope to put pressure on the US government, Israel's main ally, which has vetoed UN Security Council resolutions calling for a humanitarian \"ceasefire\" in Gaza.\nThe protesters were holding fake babies in swaddling clothes.

EDUARDO MUNOZ/REUTERS\nAfter more than two and a half months of war, nearly two million people have been displaced, or 85% of the population, according to the UN, which continues to warn of worsening \"hunger and despair\" in Gaza, which is totally besieged by Israel. U.S. President Joe Biden, who has been criticized by the Democrats' most left-wing supporters for his staunch support for Israel, also warned his ally of an erosion of international support because of the \" indiscriminate\" bombing of Gaza.",

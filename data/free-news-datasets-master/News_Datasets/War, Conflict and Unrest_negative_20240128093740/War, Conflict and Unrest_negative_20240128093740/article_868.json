    "text": "[Chronicles](https://humanevents.com/2023/12/27/jack-posobiec-the-bolsheviks-were-the-founders-of-antifa-bloodshed-could-have-been-stopped-if-leaders-took-revolutionary-threat-seriously)of the Revolution series on [Human Events Daily](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/human-events-daily-with-jack-posobiec/id1585243541?i=1000639945625)entitled The Last Crusade, Jack Posobiec and guest Blake Neff illustrated the events leading up to the Spanish Civil War and exposed the historical misconceptions surrounding it. Posobiec made a point that the whole story of the Spanish Civil War is told \"completely backwards\" and taught wrong in schools. Warren H Carrol, in his book 'The Last Crusade,' in fact wrote that the true story of the war which took place in the 1930s is \"honored in no other book in print in the English language.\" It is popularly described as a war originating from a far-right uprising. In reality, it was a war between Christianity and communism. Posobiec read from a passage of the book: \"13 bishops and nearly 7000 priests, seminarians, monks, and nuns were turned into bloodied martyrs in Spain by the communist enemies of Christianity. It was the greatest clerical bloodshed in so short a time since the persecutions of the Church of ancient Rome ... Chapels and shrines in Spain were pillaged and destroyed, nuns were raped on altars in front of the priests. In response, faithful Spanish Catholics proclaimed a crusade. Against all odds, the Crusaders triumphed, and the church and the faith in Spain were saved.\" Neff posited that the misunderstandings of the war originate from it for the most part being presented as simply \"a prelude to WWII.\" It took place from 1936-1939, right after a 1935 election in which the radical left took power against a conservative right, and has been \"dramatically oversimplified\" as a fight between the \"forces of fascism and the forces of democracy.\" In fact, Neff revealed. The left threatened that \"they would launch a violent revolution anyways\" if they didn't win the election. Posobiec explained that the influx of communism in Spain actually originated from the Russian [Revolution](https://humanevents.com/2023/12/26/jack-posobiec-the-french-revolution-started-with-mostly-peaceful-protests), after which communists began funding their factions and terrorist groups in Spain. Because of this, Spain was ridden with chaos and anarchy which led the Spanish military to step in and essentially perform a coup. They were only partially successful, leading to the civil unrest between the Right and the leftist Communists in various regions of Spain. Eventually, as Neff put it, \"what you have is across Europe ... democracy starts to fail, because you have radicals on both sides. And it becomes the sense of you either become communist, or you end up with some sort of right-wing dictatorship that promises to stop the communists.\" Posobiec read a passage written by Evita Duffy at The Federalist recounting the horrors her family incurred during the Spanish Civil War: \"One of my great-grandmother's extended family members was a priest during the war. He was captured by communists and was forced to dig his own grave. He stood before a firing squad on the edge of his self-dug grave. When the squad fired, only his arm was grazed. The priest then begged the men to shoot him.\" \"So he's begging the men to shoot him, say, just put me out of my misery, let me die a martyr,\" Posobiec explained. \"Instead, the communists decide to throw him in the grave and bury him alive.\" \"So just like we see in France, just like we see in Russia, the level of brutality that you see unleashed in the Civil War is is really shocking.\" Watch the full episode below.",

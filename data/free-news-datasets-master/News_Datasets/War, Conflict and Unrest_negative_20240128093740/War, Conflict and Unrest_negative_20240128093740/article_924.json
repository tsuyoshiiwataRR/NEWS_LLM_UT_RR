    "text": "The desperate attempts by Margaret Thatcher’s government to halt publication of Spycatcher , the headline-grabbing memoir of a rogue ex-MI5 officer, are revealed in official files that show ministers contemplated threatening libraries and invoking wartime censorship powers.\nDocuments released at the National Archives lay bare the long – and ultimately fruitless – campaign in the mid-1980s to prevent the claims of Peter Wright, a former Security Service officer, reaching a British audience.\nIn a memo written in 1985 prior to Spycatcher’s publication, Mrs Thatcher described herself as feeling “utterly shattered” by Mr Wright’s allegations, which included the claim that former MI5 head Sir Roger Hollis had been a Soviet mole, and that the Security Service had plotted against Labour prime minister Sir Harold Wilson.\nThe incendiary allegations were later largely discredited.\nBut the nature of the claims, and the spectacle of a one-time senior officer from MI5 going public – at a time when the Government did not officially acknowledge the agency’s existence – strengthened resolve in Downing Street that Spycatcher should be suppressed.\nAs Mrs Thatcher put it: “The consequences of publication would be enormous.”\nIn 1985, the Government obtained a court order banning publication in the UK – although the book remained on sale in Scotland – and newspapers were served gag orders and tried for contempt of court for reporting on Mr Wright’s allegations.\nThe approach led Spycatcher’s publishers to seek an international audience, with the book first appearing in Australia and later the US.\nThe increasingly desperate, and futile, attempts by Margaret Thatcher’s government to suppress Spycatcher , the memoir of a renegade ex-MI5 officer, are laid bare in official files made public for the first time. But despite a failed attempt to obtain an injunction in Australia, and Spycatcher’s bestselling status across the Atlantic, the Government remained determined to prevent British readers from getting their hands on the book.\nThe National Archive documents reveal how, as travellers began to arrive from America with copies of Spycatcher , ministers considered invoking censorship powers passed at the outbreak of the Second World War to seize the imported books.\nIt was despite warnings from Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young that he had been advised it “would not practice be possible” to intercept every copy.\nMeanwhile, Arts minister Lord Richard Luce warned that an international conference of librarians could see a further influx of books from the US. A British librarian was threatened with legal action after claims that he intended to add an imported copy of Spycatcher to his collection.\nThe documents also show how pressure was put on the speaker of the House of Commons to neuter debate about the book among MPs.\nAnd they reveal that ministers even considered trying to stop minutes from the European Parliament being seen in Britain after Labour MEPs read extracts from Spycatcher into the record.\nHome Secretary Douglas Hurd warned that stopping HM Stationery Office (HMSO) from importing copies of the minutes risked putting the UK in breach of its treaty obligations.\nInstead, he suggested that HMSO import only 10 copies and arrange for a Whitehall department to acquire the lot – with officials being advised to “procrastina[te]” if a member of the public wanted to buy one.\nAs it became clear that efforts to keep Spycatcher off the shelves were doomed, ministers discussed – and discounted – a plan to curtail Mr Wright’s Security Service pension on the basis that it would make the British government look petty and vengeful.\nIn an ironic twist, a top secret memo sent by Mr Hurd to Mrs Thatcher in 1988 suggested that the Spycatcher affair had undermined trust in the Security Service to the extent that a new law should be passed officially recognising MI5’s existence and putting its operations on a formal legal footing.\nThe Security Service Act was passed the following year.",

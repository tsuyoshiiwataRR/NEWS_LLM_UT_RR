    "text": "The Israeli embassy in South Korea is facing intense criticism for releasing a video ‚Äúdramatizing‚Äù a terror attack on South Korean citizens, with the tagline ‚Äú Imagine if it happened to you.‚Äù\n| Al Jazeera The video depicts an imaginary scenario where a Korean woman is abducted by an armed assailant on Christmas Day and is forcibly separated from her daughter. The Israeli embassy posted the video on Facebook on Tuesday with a caption that said, ‚ÄúOn October 7, Israel was attacked by Hamas terrorists. 1,200 men, women, and children were killed, and over 240 people were taken hostage in Gaza‚Ä¶Imagine if it happened to you. What would you do?‚Äù\nüáÆüá±üáµüá∏üá∞üá∑ In Israel, it appears that they have taken their campaign in the ongoing conflict to an extreme. The country‚Äôs embassy in South Korea has released a video illustrating what would happen if Hamas were to attack the Republic of Korea on Christmas Day.\nOne of their main‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/3kvRHpjkzg\n‚Äî Torsum Zulfiqar (@SalmanTorsum) December 28, 2023\nAccording to YTN ‚Äòs report, Israel‚Äôs ambassador in Seoul, Akiva Tor, had explained the embassy‚Äôs position in a now-deleted social media post.\nWe have reconstructed the horrifying terrorist incident that took place on October 7th to help South Koreans in East Asia, far away from Israel, understand the current war situation.\n‚Äî Akiva Tor\nThis video was produced in the context of Israel‚Äôs ongoing campaign to destroy the Palestinian resistance group Hamas in retaliation for its attack on October 7. According to Israeli figures, the attack left around 1140 people dead, civilians included. Hamas also took around 250 hostages, and 129 of them still remain in captivity.\nOn the other hand, Israel has relentlessly bombed the Gaza Strip since October 8, killing at least 21,110 people, over 5,000 of them being children, according to UNRWA .\nEvery minute, every hour, the situation is getting worse in theüìç #GazaStrip\nThe reported number of children killed in #Gaza has now exceeded 5,000\nCeasefire NOW.

    "text": "2023-12-29 00:14:37 The Israeli Army in the occupied Golan Heights – Ilia Yefimovich/dpa Follow the latest news on the war in Gaza live MADRID, 28 Dic. (EUROPA PRESS) – Syria denounced this Thursday an Israeli attack from the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel, towards the south of the country amid the escalation of violence due to the situation in the Gaza Strip, controlled by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas). . “Our air defense forces responded to the missiles and shot down most of them,” a Syrian military source told the state news agency SANA, adding that there have been “material losses”, although it is unknown if there are any casualties. As reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in London and an informant in the Arab country, Israeli forces have fired missiles at Damascus International Airport and a checkpoint in the south, located in the city of Sweida. This comes after the first plane took off the day before since the airport was out of service following an Israeli attack on October 22 that killed two civilian airport workers and damaged the runways. Flights were diverted to Latakia airport. The Golan Heights are a territory that Israel seized from Syria during the Six-Day War (1967) and the Yom Kippur War (1973) and that it effectively annexed in 1981, in a movement not recognized by the international community. . #Syria #denounces #attack #Israel #occupied #Golan #Heights #south #country",

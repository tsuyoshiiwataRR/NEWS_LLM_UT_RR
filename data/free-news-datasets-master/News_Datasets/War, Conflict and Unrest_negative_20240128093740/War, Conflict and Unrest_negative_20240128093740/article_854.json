    "text": "GAZA, Thursday, December 28, 2023 (WAFA) â€“ Dozens of innocent civilians were confirmed killed and dozens more injured this evening as a result of Israeli airstrikes targeting residential areas across Gaza Strip, according to local and medical reports.\nIsraeli warplanes conducted airstrikes on a house in the Shaboura refugee camp south of the city of Rafah, leading to a significant number of casualties, both fatalities and injuries.\nFurthermore, another Israeli aerial assault resulted in the destruction of the Al-Taqwa Mosque, located east of the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood in northern Gaza City.\nIsraeli occupation forces also targeted a residential area in the Al-Fakhari neighborhood, east of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip. The airstrike resulted in the tragic murder of nine civilians, the majority of whom were women and children.\nIn Khan Yunis, at least 17 civilians, including five children, were killed and around 15 others sustained injuries in a separate airstrike carried out by Israeli warplanes. The strike targeted a house near the Al-Amal Hospital, affiliated with the Palestinian Red Crescent, adding to the mounting casualties in the area.\nIn a preliminary toll, the ongoing Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip since October 7 has resulted in the tragic loss of over 21,500 lives and left around 54,000 wounded, with over 70% of them being women and children. Nearly 7,000 people are also unaccounted for beneath the debris.\nM.N",

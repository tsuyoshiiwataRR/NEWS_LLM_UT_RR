Biden demanded that Netanyahu solve the problem and then ended the conversation, according to two senior American and Israeli officials and a third source familiar with the issue.\nMore on the subject: Israel to US: Demand Hezbollah 10 kilometers from border Poll: Nearly half of Israelis think Netanyahu is misbehaving vis-Ã -vis Biden Biden: \"Bibi told me, 'You dropped an atomic bomb, many civilians were killed.'\" \"Investing in this land now can make you a millionaire.\" Why it's important: A senior US official said it was one of the most difficult and frustrating phone calls between Biden and Netanyahu since the start of the war in Gaza. The difficult conversation is another sign of the growing tension between the president and the prime minister in recent weeks. More in Walla! Biden hugs and the shekel soars: Why is the currency strengthening during our most difficult times? See full article >\nQuick reminder: Two months ago, Israel's political-security cabinet decided to deduct about 40 percent of the tax revenues Israel collects for the Palestinian Authority, which it is obligated to transfer to it by virtue of agreements between the sides. The decision was made following a demand by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who claimed that the funds were transferred by the PA to the Gaza Strip and would therefore reach Hamas. Since that decision, Smotrich has refused any compromise on the issue and even threatened that if the funds were transferred directly or indirectly to the Palestinian Authority, he would resign from his position. One of the most difficult and frustrating phone calls. Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu/Government Press Office, Haim Tzach\nBackstage: The 45-minute conversation focused on the next phase of Israel's ground operation in Gaza and plans to expand it to al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, Israeli and U.S. officials said. Toward the end of the conversation, however, Biden raised his concerns about Israel's freezing of PA tax revenues. The president asked the prime minister to accept a proposal that Israel itself made to the United States a few weeks ago, according to which the offset tax lines would be transferred to custody in Norway until an agreement was reached that would address Israel's concern that the money might reach Hamas. The Palestinian Authority has already agreed to this proposal and made it clear to the US that under such an arrangement it would be willing to renew the receipt of the portion of tax money that Israel did not freeze. A senior U.S. official and a source familiar with the contents of the conversation said that Netanyahu surprised Biden by retracting Israel's agreement and said he no longer believed the Norwegian proposal was good. Netanyahu told Biden that he does not trust Norway and stressed that the Palestinian Authority should simply take part of the tax money that Israel is willing to transfer to it. Biden replied to Netanyahu that the U.S. trusts Norway and that should be enough for Israel to trust that offer as well, a senior U.S. official said. U.S. and Israeli officials said Biden told Netanyahu he had to deal with extremists in his coalition who oppose the transfer of tax dollars just as he faces political pressure on the Gaza war from some congressional Democrats. A few minutes later, Biden told Netanyahu that he expected him to find a solution to the issue, noting that \"this conversation is over.\" \"The feeling was that the president was going above and beyond for Netanyahu and taking political risks every day, but when Bibi's moment comes to give something back and take a political risk, he won't do it,\" a senior U.S. official said. Another senior U.S. official who commented on the details of the article tried to downplay the controversy, noting that Netanyahu did not reject the Norwegian proposal out of hand, but \"said that he was still trying to resolve some issues on the Israeli side.\" Snapshot: A few days after the conversation between Biden and Netanyahu, a close associate of the prime minister, Minister Ron Dermer, arrived at the White House for talks with President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. The issue of Palestinian tax money was one of the topics discussed. A senior US official noted that since the phone call between Biden and Netanyahu, progress has been made on the issue. \"I think this matter is on the way to being resolved,\" the U.S. official said. What they say: A White House spokesman said the conversation between Biden and Netanyahu was \"good and helpful.\" More on the subject: Benjamin Netanyahu Joe Biden Iron Sword War Gaza War Taxes Palestinians",

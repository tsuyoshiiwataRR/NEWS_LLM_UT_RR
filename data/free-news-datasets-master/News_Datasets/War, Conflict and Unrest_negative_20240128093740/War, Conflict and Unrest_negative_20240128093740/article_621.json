    "text": "Jake Smith Daily Caller News Foundation Advertisement - story continues below The Houthi attacks against commercial vessels in the Red Sea are threatening to disrupt U.S. and global markets with delayed shipping times and increased good prices, The Washington Post reported. The Yemen-based Houthis have launched several [attacks](https://dailycaller.com/2023/12/22/iranian-forces-are-providing-intel-for-attacks-on-merchant-ships-in-red-sea-report/) since Oct. 7 against vessels in the Red Sea as part of retaliation efforts against Israel and its allies. In an effort to avoid the Houthis, commercial vessels are now taking longer routes to reach their destinations, resulting in delays and higher shipping costs, and ultimately increased prices for consumer goods in the U.S. and across the world, [according](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/12/28/red-sea-attacks-shipping-houthis/) to the Post. TRENDING: [Arsonists accused of destroying 4 churches in weeks, 15 hit during year](https://www.wnd.com/2023/12/arsonists-accused-destroying-4-churches-weeks-15-hit-year/) [Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!](https://www.wnd.com/newsletter-subscription/) Major shipping companies like COSCO, Maersk and CMA CGM, as well as several fuel tankers, previously utilized major trade routes in the Red Sea that cut through Africa and Asia, according to the Post. The recent spate of Houthi attacks has forced shipping vessels to move down and around South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope. Advertisement - story continues below There goes the wave. Just about every westbound ship has turned south for the Cape. [pic.twitter.com/cpIRJYpNQn] — Nathan Strang (@NavyStrang) [December 19, 2023] This new route adds thousands of miles and potentially weeks of time to a vessel’s trip, [according](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/21/red-sea-shipping-houthi-suez/) to the Post. “It’s about an 8 percent longer journey, which is going to drive prices up quite a bit for ocean freight – that’s a material impact on prices for the goods themselves,” Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, told the Post. Petersen noted that the higher costs associated with shipping these goods will affect the prices of “most of the stuff that you see in stores.” Delayed shipping times also mean that some of the goods these vessels are carrying will no longer be in season when they finally arrive at their destination, making them less profitable to retailers and wholesalers, according to the Post. “You can’t sell Valentine’s Day cards on St. Patrick’s Day,” George Kochanowski, CEO of shipping container company Staxxon, told the Post. Advertisement - story continues below U.S. and other international consumers that relied on goods delivered through the Red Sea will feel the brunt of increased costs and delays, according to the Post. Though the immediate consequences affect companies that previously shipped through Red Sea routes, compounded traffic will “ultimately metastasize to the entire world,” Richard Danderline, CFO of Staxxon, told the Post. U.S. Department of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin [announced](https://dailycaller.com/2023/12/18/pentagon-announces-task-force-combat-houthi-attacks-red-sea/) in December that an international task force had been formed to combat the Houthi’s aggression in the Red Sea. The Houthis have launched over 1oo [attacks](https://dailycaller.com/2023/12/23/us-led-coalition-to-defend-shipping-against-houthi-attacks-doesnt-hold-water-experts-say/) against ten commercial vessels, and managed to hijack one ship before bringing it back to a Yemeni port in November. There is no timeline for how long the Houthis will keep up their attacks, but the U.S. maintains its right to defend itself and its interests, a Pentagon spokesperson to the Post.

IMPORTANT NOTE TO WND READERS: America – long the freest, most prosperous, powerful, altruistic and Christian nation on earth – is on the brink of destruction. Every decent and aware American adult knows this. The evidence is everywhere. Democrat politicians today overwhelmingly favor late-term abortion up to the very moment of birth – formerly known as \"infanticide.\" They encourage children too young to drive or vote to have their breasts and/or sex organs amputated in pursuit of a \"gender transition\" that is both delusional and impossible, and which leads to staggering rates of depression and suicide. They have not just allowed, but ENGINEERED, a full-scale foreign invasion of America across her southern border. Advertisement - story continues below Their standard bearer, President Joe Biden – a senile, pathologically dishonest and epically corrupt career political hack – is destroying America's economy, energy sector, military, law enforcement, election integrity, national security, Constitution and overall national wellbeing as rapidly as possible. At the same time, Team Biden demonizes and, increasingly, IMPRISONS critics as \"violent extremists,\" \"domestic terrorists,\" \"white supremacists\" and \"insurrectionists.\" Indeed, they're currently engaged in an obviously corrupt multi-front legal war against Biden's chief political rival, Donald J. Trump, in an attempt to send the 45th president of the United States to prison for the rest of his life. None of this constitutes \"politics\" in any conventional or traditional American sense. Rather, it is all darkly spiritual. The greatest nation on earth is in the throes of a full-blown spiritual war between good and evil. The big question, then, is WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SAVE AMERICA? Fortunately, real answers and uncommon wisdom are showcased in the December issue of WND's critically acclaimed monthly Whistleblower magazine, [\"CAN AMERICA BE SAVED? The world's freest, most Christian nation is on the brink of destruction.\"](https://superstore.wnd.com/whistleblower/) Advertisement - story continues below In this very special issue, readers will experience the best and deepest thoughts and strategies on how to restore America to her former goodness and greatness, from some of the nation's most respected analysts – everyone from Tucker Carlson to Dennis Prager to Victor Davis Hanson to Newt Gingrich and many more.

    "text": "By [THERESA BRAINE](https://www.nydailynews.com/author/theresa-braine/) | [tbraine@nydailynews.com](mailto:tbraine@nydailynews.com) | New York Daily News GOSHEN, N.Y. — Orange County native Judih Weinstein Haggai, taken hostage from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas on Oct. 7 along with husband Gadi Haggai, was killed that day, the kibbutz announced Thursday. The mother of four and grandmother of seven was 70 years old and held U.S., Canadian and Israeli citizenship. She was born in Goshen, N.Y., and grew up in Canada, but had lived in Israel for 30 years. Her husband, also a dual Israeli-American citizen, was [confirmed dead last week](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-gaza-hostage-dead-gadi-haggai/). Both their bodies are believed to still be held by Hamas in Gaza. Weinstein and Haggai were out on a morning walk when Hamas terrorists overran the kibbutz. They took cover in a field where [Weinstein recorded 40 seconds of video](https://apnews.com/article/hostages-israel-hamas-war-what-to-know-406920c384818fa4fe3525327adf3f50) that she shared in a group chat with family. She managed to [inform her loved ones that they had been shot](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-779885) — her husband in the head — but soon lost contact. [Her cellphone signal was later detected in Gaza](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/judih-weinstein-1.7070309), her family told CBC News Network. Their daughter, Iris, told CBS News in November she had seen video evidence [suggesting her father had been killed](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-cease-fire-extended-hostage-prisoner-releases/), but until Thursday, she was holding out hope her mother was still alive. Weinstein taught English to special-needs children in Israel, along with meditation and other anti-anxiety techniques to teens and children scared by rocket fire from Gaza. Her husband was a retired jazz musician and chef. “Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” the family said in a statement. “She will be remembered for her compassion, her peaceful nature, and the creative life she built with her husband.” U.S. officials all the way up to President Biden expressed their sorrow at the news of her death. “Jill and I are devastated to learn that American Judy Weinstein is also [believed to have been killed by Hamas on October 7](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/28/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-judith-weinstein/),” Biden said in a statement from the White House. “This tragic development cuts deep, coming on the heels of last week’s news that Judy’s beloved husband, Gad Haggai, is believed to have been killed by Hamas. We are holding Judy and Gad’s four children, seven grandchildren, and other loved ones close to our hearts.” He vowed anew to work indefatigably to bring the remaining hostages home. New York officials mourned the loss of one of their own. “Heartbroken to learn that Judith (sic) Weinstein was killed during the October 7 attack,” [wrote Gov. Kathy Hochul on X](https://twitter.com/govkathyhochul/status/1740393533641822243). “My heart is with her family abroad and those still here in New York.” U.S. Rep. Pat Ryan, D-Gardiner, who represents the 18th District where Weinstein was born, mourned the “truly devastating” loss. “Our hearts are with Judih and Gadi’s entire family,” [he said on X.](https://twitter.com/RepPatRyanNY/status/1740427647513989404) “The Haggais were teachers, artists, and peace-loving people, killed only for being Jewish. We will continue our fight to bring their bodies home so that they may be properly laid to rest and mourned.” This is truly devastating – our hearts are with Judih and Gadi's entire family. The Haggais were teachers, artists, & peace-loving people, killed only for being Jewish. We will continue our fight to bring their bodies home so that they may be properly laid to rest & mourned. [https://t.co/Lr93NlRh2L] — Rep. Pat Ryan (@RepPatRyanNY) [December 28, 2023] Hamas overran the border from Gaza into Israel on Oct. 7, massacring 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking an estimated 240 hostages. While 105 hostages were released under a [temporary cease-fire in November](https://www.nydailynews.com/2023/11/24/hamas-frees-first-batch-of-hostages-including-13-israelis-officials/), more than 100 remain in Gaza. Israel promptly declared war with airstrikes and ground operations that have [killed over 21,000 Palestinians](https://www.nydailynews.com/2023/12/22/gaza-death-toll-update-un-resolution/).

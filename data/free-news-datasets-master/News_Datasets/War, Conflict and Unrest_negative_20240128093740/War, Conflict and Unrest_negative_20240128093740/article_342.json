    "text": "CHICAGO (CBS) -- Mexican immigration officials have started clearing tents along the Rio Grande River – just as U.S. officials met with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to discuss the border crisis.\nMigrants are now crossing the U.S. border in record numbers and Congress has been unable to reach a consensus on funding border security.\nU.S. officials say they are working with Mexico to limit the number of people trying to come in.\nMeanwhile in the Chicago area, more asylum seekers arrived in the suburbs Thursday and were brought to the city by train.\nCBS 2 was there when a group of about a dozen people arrived in Chicago by Metra train from west suburban Glen Ellyn. As CBS 2's Marybel González reported, they were dropped off there by buses circumventing the city's rules on arrivals.",

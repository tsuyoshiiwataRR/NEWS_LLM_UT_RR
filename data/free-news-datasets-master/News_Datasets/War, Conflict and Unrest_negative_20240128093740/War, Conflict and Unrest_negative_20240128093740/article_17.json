    "text": "Attorney General's Office of Special Investigation Opens Investigation into Civilian Death in The Bronx NEW YORK – The New York Attorney General’s Office of Special Investigation (OSI) has opened an investigation into the death of Michael Dotel, who died on December 23, 2023 after an encounter with members of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) in the Bronx. On the morning of December 23, NYPD officers responded to a residence in the Bronx following reports of a domestic dispute. Upon arrival, officers found Mr. Dotel with his arm wrapped around a woman’s neck with a knife. She and a second woman present at the scene appeared to have been slashed by Mr. Dotel. An officer fired at Mr. Dotel, striking him in the head. Mr. Dotel was transported to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Officers recovered a knife at the scene. The two injured women are expected to recover. Pursuant to New York State Executive Law Section 70-b, OSI assesses every incident reported to it where a police officer or a peace officer, including a corrections officer, may have caused the death of a person by an act or omission. Under the law, the officer may be on-duty or off-duty, and the decedent may be armed or unarmed. Also, the decedent may or may not be in custody or incarcerated. If OSI’s assessment indicates an officer may have caused the death, OSI proceeds to conduct a full investigation of the incident. These are preliminary facts and subject to change.",

    "text": "OLEKSII Tilnenko hoped this would be the year Ukraine drove Russian forces out of swathes of occupied land.\nAs 2023 draws to a close, his southern hometown of Kherson is still being pounded by shelling and the front line has barely budged.\nTilnenko, who fled Kherson last year and lives in Kyiv where he helps internally displaced people (IDPs), believes Russia is racing to rebuild its much larger armed forces to step up its war effort.\n“The hope is the West can somehow mobilise, somehow fire up its defence industry to renew equipment and produce what’s needed to defend our ordinary citizens,” said the 36-year-old.\nMore than 21 months into the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two, fighting rages with no end in sight and neither side has landed a telling blow on the battlefield.\nUkrainian soldiers, living in freezing trenches, acknowledge they are exhausted going into a second winter of full-scale war with a resource-rich, nuclear-armed superpower that has more than triple Ukraine’s population.\nUkrainians know they must secure Western military aid to carry on - and that it will be harder with the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza distracting global attention.\nUkrainian servicemen resting at their positions after a fight near the front line city of Bakhmut, in Donetsk, Ukraine. — Reuters\nRussian troops, who occupy about 17.5% of Ukraine, are again on the offensive in the east after largely withstanding a Ukrainian counteroffensive that was unable to punch through sprawling defensive lines in the south and east.\nThe darkening outlook contrasts starkly with Kyiv’s buoyant mood a year ago, after Ukrainians defied expectations by beating back Russian troops around their capital before recapturing territory in the northeast and south, including Kherson city.\nThe toll keeps mounting in a war that has already killed or wounded hundreds of thousands of people, destroyed Ukrainian cities, towns and villages, forced millions from their homes and placed hundreds of thousands more under occupation.\nDrone and missile strikes are a part of daily life.\nIn the northeastern city of Kharkiv, schools are being built underground so children can study in classrooms without dying in an air strike.\nTilnenko heads Crimea SOS, a group that helps Ukraine’s five million IDPs. He says he has no plans to return to Kherson because of the constant threat from artillery and guided aerial bombs.\nHe feels Western military aid should have come faster, in larger volumes and in a less piecemeal fashion.\nAir power vital for the counteroffensive, he says, was sorely lacking this year and promised F-16 fighter jets have not been delivered.\nThe passage of vital military and financial assistance from the West is no longer happening smoothly.\nUS President Joe Biden has made a Ukrainian victory a foreign policy goal as he campaigns for re-election in November 2024, but the fate of his proposed US$60bil aid package is uncertain because of opposition by some Republicans.\nA separate, four-year €20bil European Union military aid proposal has also run into resistance from some bloc members.\nThe lack of significant Ukrainian headway on the battlefield this year could also hurt Biden politically in an election in which could herald a comeback by former President Donald Trump, who called on Congress this summer to withhold aid to Ukraine.\nSome Ukrainians, including Tilnenko, believe Russian President Vladimir Putin will use any let-up in fighting to build further defences and regenerate the Russian army for a new assault.\nPutin may feel he can escalate Russia’s war effort further once, as expected, he has secured another six-year term in the Kremlin in an election next March.\nUkraine was also due to hold a presidential election in March, but this will not happen because of martial law. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy put an end to speculation last month that a workaround would be found, saying now is “not the time” for an election.\nThe strain of the war is likely to weigh on society and the political landscape over the coming year. Reforms under way to make army recruitment and conscription more efficient illustrate the sensitive but important issues the government must navigate.\nTilnenko says war fatigue is a fact of life.\n“Everyone’s tired. The soldiers are tired, victims are tired, the IDPs are tired. But there’s no way out. We can’t just give up and say ‘okay, fine’. At the very least, too many people have died. We hope it’ll get easier. And we’ll see how it goes.” — Reuters\nOpen Modal ×",

    "text": "Suspect in custody after police chase ends in Wilkinsburg pool A man has been taken into custody after a chase ended in a Wilkinsburg pool. It all started Wednesday night. Authorities say they approached 31-year-old Jeremy Neal after noticing he was involved in suspicious activity at the BP station on East Carson. Before approaching Neal, deputies checked his identity through his vehicle registration and confirmed that Neal was wanted by Braddock Borough police for a firearms violation. As deputies tried to arrest him, he allegedly showed a gun and refused to get out of the car. When deputies attempted to remove him from the car, they say he sped away, hit a trailer and a building, and nearly hit two construction workers. On Thursday, Neal was taken into custody following a pursuit that began in the city, then involved the Parkway East and ended when the vehicle sank into a swimming pool in Wilkinsburg off of the Ardmore Boulevard exit. \"I heard the splash and it just went nose-first into the pool,\" said Daniel Miller, who witnessed part of the chase from his apartment building. Pittsburgh's Action News 4 crews saw both the suspect's vehicle and a police cruiser being towed from the pool. The suspect's vehicle had been submerged in water, while the cruiser appeared to be on top of the pool cover. Neal is facing a slew of charges related to Wednesday night's incident, including nine counts of aggravated assault and seven counts of recklessly endangering another person. It was not immediately clear what charges he could face related to Thursday night's chase.",

    "text": "Sadly, 2023 has been a violent year on the global stage. War broke out between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Palestinians and hundreds of Israelis, including many children, on both sides. And the bitter war between Russia and Ukraine continued with no end in sight.\nAs a result of the focus on these two conflicts, other countries have fallen off the radar for many people. However, some of these countries are dealing with growing unrest, which could erupt in 2024 and make global headlines.\nSo, where should we look in the coming year? Here are five places where I believe civil conflict or unrest could get worse and potentially lead to violence.\nmyanmar\nMyanmar descended into a state of chaos in 2021 when a military coup overthrew the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi and triggered widespread civilian protests that eventually turned into armed resistance.\nHome to 135 ethnic groups there has rarely been peace in this country. For years before the coup, there was an ongoing low-grade civil conflict between the military and several minority ethnic groups who had long sought independence from the state and control of natural resources in their areas.\nThe explosion came after the coup as ethnic militia groups opposing the junta joined forces with pro-democracy fighters from the Bamar majority.\nTheir resistance increased with a coordinated northern offensive in late 2023, causing the army's largest losses in many years.\nThe rebels gained control of towns and villages along the northeastern border with China, including control of key trade routes. This led to renewed fighting in western Rakhine state as well as other areas.\nThe tenacity of resistance from these minority groups, combined with the military's refusal to compromise, suggests that the country's civil war could worsen significantly in 2024 and regain international attention.\ngardener\nIn Mali, a country in Africa's restive Sahel region, tensions have been rising throughout 2023 and are now at risk of breaking out into full-scale civil war.\nMali has been struggling with rebel activities for a long time. In 2012, Mali's government fell in a coup and Tuareg rebels, backed by Islamic militants, seized power in the north.\nThe United Nations peacekeeping mission was established in 2013 to bring stability to Mali. Then, in 2015, major rebel groups signed a peace agreement with the government of Mali.\nRead more: Mali crisis: UN peacekeepers leaving after 10 years – what is needed for a smooth transition\nFollowing two more coups in 2020 and 2021, military authorities consolidated their power and said they would restore the state's full territorial control over all of Mali. The regime insisted on withdrawing the UN peacekeeping mission from the country, which it did in June 2023. Subsequently, violence broke out between the army and rebel forces over the future use of UN bases.\nIn November, forces reportedly backed by Russia's Wagner Group took control of the strategic northern town of Kidal, which had been held by Tuareg forces since 2012. This undermines the fragile peace that has been in place since 2015.\nIt is unlikely that the army will regain full control of all rebel-held areas in the north. Also, the morale of the militants is high. With the 2015 peace agreement now almost over, we can expect increased instability in 2024.\nlebanon\nIn 2019, widespread civil protests broke out in Lebanon against leaders who were believed to be not addressing the day-to-day needs of the population.\nThe situation continued to deteriorate with government changes, a growing economic crisis, and a massive port explosion that exposed corrupt practices.\nProtests outside a bank in Lebanon after the lira hit an all-time low against the US dollar in March 2023. Wael Hamzeh/EPA\nThe International Monetary Fund criticized Lebanon in September for a lack of economic reform. The Lebanese government has also failed to agree on the appointment of a president, a position that has been vacant for more than a year.\nThis threatens to undermine the fragile power-sharing arrangement in Lebanon, in which the key political posts of prime minister, speaker and president are allocated to Sunni-Muslims, Shia-Muslims and Christian Maronites respectively.\nRecently, the war between Israel and Hamas has threatened to spread to Lebanon, home to the Hezbollah terrorist group, which claims to have an army of 100,000 fighters. Crucially, this jeopardizes tourism as Lebanon's main hope for economic recovery.\nThese factors could lead to a more serious economic and political collapse in 2024.\nPakistan\nSince Pakistan's independence in 1947, the military has played an interventionist role in politics. Although Pakistani leaders are popularly elected, military authorities have at times removed them from power.\nIn 2022, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan became disillusioned with the militant leaders of Pakistan. He was later ousted from power in a parliamentary vote and later arrested on charges that his supporters claim are politically motivated.\nHis arrest sparked violent demonstrations across the country – a display of anger against the military that was once unimaginable.\nPakistan also faces instability and increasing terrorist attacks in neighboring Afghanistan. These security challenges are further compounded by the struggling economy and the ongoing costs of devastating floods in 2022.\nPakistan is expected to hold parliamentary elections in February 2024, after which the current military caretaker government is expected to transfer power to civilian rule. Many people are keeping a close eye on the army. If this transfer of power does not occur, or is delayed, civil unrest may occur.\nRead more: How Imran Khan's populism has divided Pakistan and left it on a knife's edge\nSri Lanka\nSri Lanka faced a debilitating economic crisis in 2022 leading to severe shortages of fuel, food and medicine. Due to civil protests, then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had to flee the country. He was replaced by current President Ranil Vikram Singh.\nStability returned in 2023 as Sri Lanka began implementing economic reforms as part of a bailout agreement with the International Monetary Fund. However, widespread dissatisfaction with the political elite and the underlying drivers of the country's economic difficulty have not been addressed.\nSoldiers blocked the road as workers protest against the government's domestic debt restructuring process and new labor laws proposed in July 2023. Chamila Karunaratne/EPA\nElections are also to be held in Sri Lanka by the end of 2024. While incumbent Vikramsingh is likely to run for a second term, his confidence among the public is low. He is seen as very close to the corrupt political elite.\nThis discontent could lead to renewed protests – especially if the economy falters again – a repeat of the same situation that led to Rajapaksa's ouster in 2022.\nSource: theconversation.com",

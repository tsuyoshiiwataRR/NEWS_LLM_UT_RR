    "text": "IDF fighter jets, tanks and artillery attacked in southern Lebanon/IDF Spokesperson\nThe Northern Command today (Thursday) launched a new format of action against Hezbollah, in the framework of simultaneous combined attacks against the organization in terrorist centers. As part of the operations, intelligence marks a terrorist infrastructure area in the heart of a village in southern Lebanon, and the command fire center distributes targets between fighter planes, artillery, tanks and mortars. The fire that is opened simultaneously, in order to increase the effect on the area, is adapted to the type of target: headquarters, weapons depots and bunkers.\nSince the beginning of the war, more than 140 Hezbollah operatives have been killed. This number does not include operatives whom the organization defined as \"out of touch,\" since it has not found their bodies, and another <> Palestinian activists whom it has trained over the past few years and located along the Israeli border.\nCombined IDF attack in southern Lebanon/IDF Spokesperson, IDF Spokesperson\nThe assessments in the defense establishment are that in light of the situation facing Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, and his commitment to the axis of evil headed by Iran, the regime of the ayatollahs is urging it to continue its war of attrition against the IDF until further notice. Thus, Lebanon has become a playground between superpowers, with American, Russian, and European strings being pulled behind the scenes, especially France. A security source told Walla! The security tension is of concern among countries that have sent their military forces to Lebanon, with the number of UNIFIL forces carrying out operations in the conflict zone.\nAt this stage, the Israeli government expects that the solution between Israel and Hezbollah will eventually be through diplomatic mediation. However, if not, the IDF will act to remove threats from the border in a variety of ways, from expanding the limited campaign to deteriorating into war in an extreme scenario.\nA suggestion not to be missed Advance to the next generation of Tammy4 water bars: smaller, smarter In collaboration with Tami4\nIDF Chief of Staff assessing the situation on the northern border, December 20, 2023/IDF Spokesperson\nAgainst the background of the launches of unmanned aerial vehicles, the use of Kornet missiles with a range of 5 km, rockets of various types, and attempts to penetrate Israel, there is concern in Israel that Hezbollah will try to steal attention in an act of terror. Therefore, the Northern Command tightened its cooperation with the air force in the area, with the various ground forces and with the navy, in order to prepare for extreme scenarios, which could include a raid.\nMeanwhile, today the IDF struck two squads of Hezbollah operatives from the air, one of them an anti-tank squad preparing to launch and another squad that fired rockets from a building. It is still unclear how many Hezbollah operatives were killed in the attacks.\nMore on the subject: Gaza War Iron Sword War Lebanon",

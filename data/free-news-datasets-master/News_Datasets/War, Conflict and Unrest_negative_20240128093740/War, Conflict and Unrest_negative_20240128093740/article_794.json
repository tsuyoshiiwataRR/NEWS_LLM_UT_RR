    "text": "France, Germany, Britain, and the United States jointly condemned Iran’s recent increase in highly enriched uranium production, reaching up to 60% purity—a level close to that used for nuclear weapons. In their statement, the allies expressed concern about Iran’s actions, deeming them reckless in the current tense regional context, [Reuters reported.](https://www.reuters.com/world/france-germany-uk-us-condemn-irans-increase-uranium-enrichment-2023-12-28/) The rise in uranium enrichment coincides with heightened hostilities in the region, notably Israel’s offensive against Hamas in Gaza. Iran-backed proxies have escalated attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and targeted U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria, further intensifying tensions. Despite the condemnation, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on Tuesday that Iran had reversed its months-long slowdown in highly enriched uranium production. The joint statement denounced this escalation, characterizing it as a worrisome development in Iran’s nuclear program. Iran, responding on Wednesday, dismissed the IAEA report as “nothing new” and asserted compliance with program rules. The country already possesses enough uranium of 60% purity, sufficient to make three nuclear bombs if enriched to 90%, according to the IAEA’s theoretical definition. Despite these concerns, Iran denies any intention to develop nuclear weapons. The 2015 nuclear deal involving Britain, France, and Germany aimed at preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is now at risk. Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the accord in 2018 prompted Iran to gradually violate its provisions, adding complexity to the current diplomatic challenges.",

    "text": "A 2024 US presidential candidate was roasted when she was asked what the cause of the American Civil War was and failed to mention slavery.\nNikki Haley, a former US ambassador to the\nUnited Nations, was asked by an attendee at her town hall debate on Wednesday night in Berlin, New Hampshire, what triggered the war between states in the North and South in the 1860s.\nThe Republican candidate and former South Carolina governor turned around, paused momentarily and then joked, ‘Well, don’t come with an easy question.’\nHaley, 51, then replied: ‘I mean I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how\ngovernment was going to run, the freedoms and what people could and couldn’t do.’\nShe then asked the attendee what he thought was the cause of the Civil War. The man said he was not the one running for the White House.\nHaley continued that she believes ‘it always comes down to the role of government’ and that she will always believe that it is meant to secure people’s rights and freedoms but not get in the way of their liberties.\nThe voter then told Haley: ‘In 2023, it’s astonishing to me that you would answer that question without mentioning the word slavery.’\nHaley shot back, ‘What do you want me to say about slavery?’ then smiled and said, ‘Next question.’\nPresident Joe Biden late Wednesday\nshared the clip of Haley on X (formerly Twitter) and remarked: ‘It was about slavery.’\nMeanwhile, Democratic National Committee Jaime Harrison told\nCBS: ‘This isn’t hard, condemning slavery is the baseline for anyone who wants to be president of the United States, but Nikki Haley and the rest of the MAGA (Make America Great Again) GOP are choking on their words trying to rewrite history.’\nHaley has been gaining support in state and national polls. An American Research Group Inc survey released last week showed that Haley was within four percentage points of ex-President\nDonald Trump in New Hampshire. Haley served as UN ambassador under Trump, who remains the frontrunner for the GOP nomination.\nOn Thursday morning amid backlash, Haley sought to clarify her comment.\n‘I mean, of course the Civil War was about slavery,’ Haley said on the Good Morning New Hampshire radio show.\n‘But what’s the lesson in all of that? That we need to make sure that every person has freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to do and be anything they want to be without anyone or government getting in the way.\n‘That was the goal of what that was at. Yes, I know it was about slavery. I’m from the South, of course I know it’s about slavery.’\nShe also appeared to accuse the voter who asked her the question of being a ‘Democrat Plant’ possibly sent by Biden or his party.\n‘Why is Biden doing that?’ Haley said. ‘Why isn’t he doing that to any other candidate?’\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at .\nFor more stories like this,\ncheck our news page.\nSign Up for News Updates\nGet your need-to-know latest news, feel-good stories, analysis and more\nPrivacy Policyand Terms of Serviceapply.",

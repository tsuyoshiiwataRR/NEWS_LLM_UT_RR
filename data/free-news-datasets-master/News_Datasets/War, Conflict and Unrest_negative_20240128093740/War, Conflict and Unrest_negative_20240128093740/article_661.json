    "text": "At first, she was known simply as “the woman in the black dress.”\nIn a grainy video, you can see her, lying on her back, dress torn, legs spread, vagina exposed. Her face is burned beyond recognition, and her right hand covers her eyes.\nGal Abdush’s parents, centre, and her sisters at their home in Kiryat Ekron, a small town in central Israel. The New York Times\nThe video was shot in the early hours of October 8 by a woman searching for a missing friend at the site of the rave in southern Israel where, the day before, Hamas terrorists massacred hundreds of young Israelis.\nThe video went viral, with thousands of people responding, desperate to know if the woman in the black dress was their missing friend, sister or daughter.\nOne family knew exactly who she was: Gal Abdush, mother of two from a working-class town in central Israel, who disappeared from the rave that night with her husband.\nAs the terrorists closed in on her, trapped on a highway in a line of cars of people trying to flee the party, she sent one final WhatsApp message to her family: “You don’t understand.”\nBased largely on the video evidence – which was verified by The New York Times – Israeli police officials said they believed Abdush was raped, and she has become a symbol of the horrors visited upon Israeli women and girls during the October 7 attacks .\nIsraeli officials say that everywhere Hamas terrorists struck – the rave, the military bases along the Gaza Strip border and the kibbutzim – they brutalised women.\nA two-month investigation by the Times uncovered painful new details, establishing that the attacks against women were not isolated events but part of a broader pattern of gender-based violence on October 7.\nAdvertisement Relying on video footage, photographs, GPS data from mobile phones and interviews with more than 150 people, including witnesses, medical personnel, soldiers and rape counsellors, the Times identified at least seven locations where Israeli women and girls appear to have been sexually assaulted or mutilated.\nFour witnesses described in graphic detail seeing women raped and killed at two different places along Route 232, the same highway where Abdush’s half-naked body was found sprawled on the road at a third location.\nAnd the Times interviewed several soldiers and volunteer medics who together described finding more than 30 bodies of women and girls in and around the rave site and in two kibbutzim in a similar state as Abdush’s – legs spread, clothes torn off, signs of abuse in their genital areas.\nMany of the accounts are difficult to bear, and the visual evidence is disturbing to see.\nAn aerial view of the music festival camp that was overrun by Hamas gunmen near the Gaza border. The New York Times\nThe Times viewed photographs of one woman’s corpse that emergency responders discovered in the rubble of a besieged kibbutz with dozens of nails driven into her thighs and groin.\nThe Times also viewed a video, provided by the Israeli military, showing two dead Israeli soldiers at a base near Gaza who appeared to have been shot directly in their vaginas.\nHamas has denied Israel’s accusations of sexual violence. Israeli activists have been outraged that UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the agency UN Women did not acknowledge the many accusations until weeks after the attacks.\nShock and confusion Investigators with Israel’s top national police unit, Lahav 433, have been steadily gathering evidence, but they have not put a number on how many women were raped, saying that most are dead – and buried – and that they will never know. No survivors have spoken publicly.\nAdvertisement Israeli police have acknowledged that during the shock and confusion of October 7, the deadliest day in Israeli history, they were not focused on collecting semen samples from women’s bodies, requesting autopsies or closely examining crime scenes. At that moment, authorities said, they were intent on repelling Hamas and identifying the dead.\nA combination of chaos, enormous grief and Jewish religious duties meant that many bodies were buried as quickly as possible. Most were never examined, and in some cases, like at the rave scene, where more than 360 people were slaughtered in a few hours, the bodies were hauled away by the truckload.\nVolunteers with an emergency response team at the Kfar Aza kibbutz in Israel. The New York Times\nThat has left Israeli authorities at a loss to fully explain to families what happened to their loved ones in their final moments. Abdush’s relatives, for instance, never received a death certificate. They are still searching for answers.\nSapir, a 24-year-old accountant, has become one of the Israeli police’s key witnesses. She does not want to be fully identified, saying she would be hounded for the rest of her life if her last name were revealed.\nShe attended the rave with several friends and provided investigators with graphic testimony. She also spoke to the Times . In a two-hour interview outside a cafe in southern Israel, she recounted seeing groups of heavily armed gunmen rape and kill at least five women.\nShe said that at 8am on October 7, she was hiding under the low branches of a bushy tamarisk tree, just off Route 232, about 6 kilometres south-west of the party. She had been shot in the back. She felt faint. She covered herself in dry grass and lay as still as she could.\nAbout 15 metres from her hiding place, she said, she saw motorcycles, cars and trucks pulling up. She said that she saw “about 100 men”, most of them dressed in military fatigues and combat boots, a few in dark sweatsuits, getting in and out of the vehicles. She said the men congregated along the road and passed among them assault rifles, grenades, small missiles – and badly wounded women.\n“It was like an assembly point,” she said.\nAdvertisement The first victim she said she saw was a young woman with copper-coloured hair, blood running down her back, pants pushed down to her knees. One man pulled her by the hair and made her bend over. Another penetrated her, Sapir said, and every time she flinched, he plunged a knife into her back.\nShe said she then watched another woman “shredded into pieces”. While one terrorist raped her, she said, another pulled out a box cutter and sliced off her breast.\n“One continues to rape her, and the other throws her breast to someone else, and they play with it, throw it, and it falls on the road,” Sapir said.\nShe said the men sliced her face, and then the woman fell out of view. Around the same time, she said, she saw three other women raped and terrorists carrying the severed heads of three more women.\nSapir provided photographs of her hiding place and her wounds, and police officials have stood by her testimony and released a video of her, with her face blurred, recounting some of what she saw.\nThat same morning, along Route 232 but in a different location about 1.6 kilometres south-west of the party area, Raz Cohen – a young Israeli who had also attended the rave and had worked recently in Congo training Congolese soldiers – said he was hiding in a dried-up streambed.\nIt provided some cover from the assailants combing the area and shooting anyone they found, he said in a 1½-hour interview in a Tel Aviv restaurant.\nMaybe 36 metres in front of him, he recalled, a white van pulled up, and its doors flew open.\nHe said he then saw five men, wearing civilian clothes, all carrying knives and one carrying a hammer, dragging a woman across the ground. She was young, naked and screaming.\nAdvertisement “They all gather around her,” Cohen said. “She’s standing up. They start raping her. I saw the men standing in a half circle around her. One penetrates her. She screams. I still remember her voice, screams without words.\n“Then one of them raises a knife,” he said, “and they just slaughtered her.”\nRaz Cohen, a security consultant who survived the attacks by hiding in a dried-up streambed. The New York Times\nShoam Gueta, one of Cohen’s friends and a fashion designer, said the two were hiding together in the streambed. He said he saw at least four men step out of the van and attack the woman, who ended up “between their legs”. He said that they were “talking, giggling and shouting” and that one of them stabbed her with a knife repeatedly, “literally butchering her”.\nHours later, the first wave of volunteer emergency medical technicians arrived at the rave site. In interviews, four of them said that they discovered bodies of dead women with their legs spread and underwear missing – some with their hands tied by rope and zip ties – in the party area, along the road, in the parking area and in the open fields around the rave site.\nSimilar discoveries were made in two kibbutzim, Be’eri and Kfar Aza. Eight volunteer medics and two Israeli soldiers told the Times that in at least six different houses, they had come across a total of at least 24 bodies of women and girls naked or half naked, some mutilated, others tied up, and often alone.\nA paramedic in an Israeli commando unit said he had found the bodies of two teenage girls in a room in Be’eri.\nOne was lying on her side, he said, boxer shorts ripped, bruises by her groin. The other was sprawled on the floor face down, pyjama pants pulled to her knees, bottom exposed, semen smeared on her back.\nBecause his job was to look for survivors, he said, he kept moving and did not document the scene. Neighbours of the two girls killed – who were sisters, 13 and 16 – said their bodies had been found alone, separated from the rest of their family.\nThe Israeli military allowed the paramedic to speak with reporters on the condition that he not be identified because he serves in an elite unit.\nAdvertisement Many of the dead were brought to the Shura military base, in central Israel, for identification. Here, too, witnesses said they saw signs of sexual violence.\nShari Mendes, an architect called up as a reserve soldier to help prepare the bodies of female soldiers for burial, said she had seen four with signs of sexual violence, including some with “a lot of blood in their pelvic areas”.\nA dentist, Captain Maayan, who worked at the same identification centre, said that she had seen at least 10 bodies of female soldiers from Gaza observation posts with signs of sexual violence.\nMaayan asked to be identified only by her rank and surname because of the sensitivity of the subject. She said she had seen several bodies with cuts in their vaginas and underwear soaked in blood and one whose fingernails had been pulled out.\nThe investigation Israeli authorities have no shortage of video evidence from the October 7 attacks. They have gathered hours of footage from Hamas body cameras, dashcams, security cameras and mobile phones showing Hamas terrorists killing civilians and many images of mutilated bodies.\nShari Mendes, an architect who was called up as a reserve soldier to help handle the bodies of female troops, in a container used to hold bodies. The New York Times\nBut Moshe Fintzy, a deputy superintendent and senior spokesperson of Israel’s national police, said, “We have zero autopsies, zero,” making an O with his right hand.\nIn the aftermath of the attack, police officials said, forensic examiners were dispatched to the Shura military base to help identify the hundreds of bodies; Israeli officials say about 1200 people were killed that day.\nThe examiners worked quickly to give the agonised families of the missing a sense of closure and to determine, by a process of elimination, who was dead and who was being held hostage in Gaza.\nAdvertisement According to Jewish tradition, funerals are held promptly. The result was that many bodies with signs of sexual abuse were put to rest without medical examinations, meaning that potential evidence now lies buried in the ground. International forensic experts said that it would be possible to recover some evidence from the corpses but that it would be difficult.\nFintzy said Israeli security forces were still finding imagery that shows women were brutalised. Sitting at his desk at an imposing police building in Jerusalem, he swiped open his phone, tapped and produced the video of the two soldiers shot in the vagina, which he said was recorded by Hamas gunmen and recently recovered by Israeli soldiers.\nA colleague sitting next to him, Mirit Ben Mayor, a police chief superintendent, said she believed that the brutality against women was a combination of two ferocious forces: “the hatred for Jews and the hatred for women.”\nSome emergency medical workers now wish they had documented more of what they saw. In interviews, they said they had moved bodies, cut off zip ties and cleaned up scenes of carnage. Trying to be respectful to the dead, they inadvertently destroyed evidence.\nMany volunteers working for ZAKA, the emergency response team, are religious Jews and operate under strict rules that command deep respect for the dead.\n“I did not take pictures because we are not allowed to take pictures,” said Yossi Landau, a ZAKA volunteer. “In retrospect, I regret it.”\nThere are at least three women and one man who were sexually assaulted and survived, according to Gil Horev, a spokesperson for Israel’s Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs. “None of them has been willing to come physically for treatment,” he said. Two therapists said they were working with a woman who was gang raped at the rave and was in no condition to talk to investigators or reporters.\nThe trauma from sexual assault can be so heavy that sometimes survivors do not speak about it for years, several rape counsellors said.\n“Many people are looking for the golden evidence, of a woman who will testify about what happened to her. But don’t look for that. Don’t put this pressure on this woman,” said Orit Sulitzeanu, executive director of the Association of Rape Crisis Centres in Israel. “The corpses tell the story.”",

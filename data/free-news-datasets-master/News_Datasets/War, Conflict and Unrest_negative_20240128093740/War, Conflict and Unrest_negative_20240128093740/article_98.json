    "text": "Russia's military invasion of Ukraine continues. Russian and Ukrainian forces continue to fight in various parts of Ukraine, and many civilians are fleeing the country. We will update you on the situation in Ukraine on the 29th (Japan time), including the situation of the battle and the diplomacy of the countries concerned. (There is a 7-hour time difference between Japan and Ukraine, and 6 hours with Moscow, Russia.) \"Western officials review support for retaking Ukrainian territory\" US media On the 27th, the American political website \"Politico\" reported that US and European officials were considering reviewing the strategy that has been helping Ukraine retake all the territories occupied by Russia. It is said that they are discussing such as placing Ukrainian troops participating in the reverse offensive in the east where the fierce attack by the Russian army continues to strengthen defense, and the official said that it aimed to give Ukraine an advantage in future ceasefire negotiations. Politico says that ceasefire negotiations mean ceding part of its territory to Russia, but it also conveys the story of the official that \"negotiations with Russia are not planned.\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has shown that he will not give up on a long war until he recaptures all the territory, including southern Crimea. The West has repeatedly emphasized its unwavering support, but as the fighting drags on and \"support fatigue\" is pointed out in various countries, the United States has fallen into a situation where the emergency budget necessary for the continuation of military assistance has not been approved. President Putin meets with Indian foreign minister, clarifies readiness to counter the West Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar, who visited Moscow on the 27th, and said, \"Trade between the two countries is expanding, first of all, energy-related items such as crude oil and petroleum products, but not only that,\" and expressed his intention to strengthen economic relations with India even as Western countries tighten sanctions against Russia. In addition, President Putin said, \"I am delighted to meet with my friend Prime Minister Modi in Russia, and we will be able to discuss the development of bilateral relations,\" to which Foreign Minister Jaishankar replied, \"Prime Minister Modi sincerely wants to visit Russia next year.\" President Putin is aiming to strengthen relations with emerging and developing countries such as India, the so-called Global South, and has made it clear that he is ready to counter the West as the military invasion of Ukraine drags on. In addition, Foreign Minister Lavrov criticized the Russian Foreign Ministry in an interview with the state-run Tass news agency on the 1th, saying, \"Despite the failure of the Ukrainian army's reverse offensive, the Western side continues to inject weapons into Ukraine.\" Regarding the New START nuclear disarmament treaty with the United States, which Russia unilaterally suspended in February and expires in 28, he said, \"Dialogue is impossible unless the United States abandons its anti-Russian policy. At present, the U.S. side was reprimanded for not being in an environment where it is possible to negotiate a new nuclear disarmament treaty between the United States and Russia.",

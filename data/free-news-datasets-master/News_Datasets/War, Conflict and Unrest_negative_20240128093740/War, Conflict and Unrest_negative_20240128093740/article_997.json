    "text": "A MISSING person who is believed to be connected to the Zodiac killer has been identified after almost 40 years. The Placer County Sheriff’s Office has announced that they were able to identify the remains of Donna Lass who went missing in 1971. Lass's skull was found on Highway 20 near the Sierra Nevada mountains In 1986. However, it was revealed that there was no ways to identify her at the time, leading to the skull being preserved until coroners were able to get access to more advanced technology, according to recent press release. Placer County Sheriff’s Office along with the Placer County District Attorney’s Office had decided to work together to create a cold case team, which would lead to their shocking discovery. The team was able to send the skull to the California Department of Justice Bureau of Forensic Services, where they were able to identify the DNA from a sample due to Lass's other family members. \"We are extremely grateful that this team effort was able to bring closure to the Lass family and are hopeful that cold case detectives can continue to make advances in these cases,\" the sheriff explained in the recent press release. At the time of her disappearance, she was 25 years old and just moved into her apartment in South Lake Tahoe, according to a news article shared by the police. She was last seen walking with a blond man who had not been identified. After she vanished police found her car, clothes, and bank account information. There has been speculation that Lass's disappearance had been connected to the Zodiac killer for years. In 1971, the San Francisco Chronicle received a strange postcard that had a symbol resembling the signature of the Zodiac Killer. The card had phrases such as “Sierra Club,” “Sought victim 12” and \"peek through the pines,\" and the words \"around in the snow,\" written upside down, The Sacramento Bee reported. This has led many to believe that Lass could have been murdered by the prolific killer, however authorites have not found proof of that just yet. As of now there is still a lot of unanswered questions surrounding the missing nurse's death. \"It hasn’t been proven to be a homicide at this point, but we’re obviously treating it that way,” South Lake Tahoe Police Chief David Stevenson told NBC affiliate KCRA .",

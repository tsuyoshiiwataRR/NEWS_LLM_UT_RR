    "text": "Turk said in a statement that “I am deeply alarmed by the series of attacks by gunmen on multiple rural communities in Plateau State. The United Nations (UN) human rights chief, Volker Turk, on Thursday said he was “deeply alarmed” by the multiple attacks and killing of over 150 persons about several communities in Bokkos and Barkin Ladi local government areas of Plateau State. Turk said in a statement that “I am deeply alarmed by the series of attacks by gunmen on multiple rural communities in Plateau State. “I call on the Nigerian authorities to investigate this incident promptly, thoroughly and independently, consistent with international human rights law, and to hold those responsible to account in fair trials.” SaharaReporters had reported how armed terrorists attacked about 17 communities in Bokkos and Barkin Ladi local government areas of Plateau State on Christmas eve and killed over 150 persons, injured scores and burnt down dozens of houses. Whereas President Bola Tinubu has condemned the attacks and ordered investigation into the incident, no arrest is said to have been made since the attacks took place on Saturday. The US, France and Nigerians in general have called for immediate thorough, independent investigation into the attacks to ensure that the perpetrators are arrested and made to face the full wrath of the law.",

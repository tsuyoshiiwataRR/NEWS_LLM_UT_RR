    "text": "After the special operations of the Ukrainian Defence and Intelligence Forces, there are no safe places for Russian ships in occupied Crimea. Therefore, Russia is quietly moving its fleet further away to Novorossiysk. For several months now, Ukrainian intelligence has been recording the relocation of Russian Black Sea Fleet vessels, Andriy Yusov, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine, said in an interview with [Suspilne](https://suspilne.media/648992-ukraina-uspisno-zbilsila-i-rozsirila-zonu-vplivu-ta-kontrolu-v-okupovanomu-krimu-usov/). He noted that Ukraine had successfully increased and expanded its zone of influence and control over Crimea and the situation in the Black Sea in general. Therefore, today there is no safe place for the Russians on the occupied peninsula. The relocation of the Russian Black Sea Fleet ships began after several cases of damage to Russian ships as a result of attacks by the Ukrainian Defence Forces. \"This concerns both the relocation of some vessels and the transfer of headquarters infrastructure. This is actually a tacit recognition by the aggressor that the situation in Crimea has deteriorated significantly for them,\" Yusov explained. Compared to 2022, this year the number of operations and strikes on Russian manpower and assets in Crimea has increased significantly.",

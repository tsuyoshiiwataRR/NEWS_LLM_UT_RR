    "text": "The sense of injustice is killing Arsenal’s challenge. And yet they were the ones shooting themselves in the foot as they failed to reclaim pole position in the title race.\nWe will be talking forever about whether the ball crossed the line in the build-up to Tomas Soucek’s opener as West Ham shocked Arsenal at the Emirates . VAR could not find any conclusive proof to show the ball was out of play so they stuck with referee Michael Oliver’s on-field decision to give the goal.\nYou can find angles and dodgy illustrations on the internet to supposedly prove it was out and it will only add to the conspiracy theories about devious plots to derail Arsenal's title challenge. But the reality is that the goal was scored in the 13th minute and they had plenty of time to come back but could not find a way through and it must go down as Arsenal’s worst performance of the season.\nInstead, West Ham , who defended brilliantly, were the ones who got a second as former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos headed in to compound the agony and wasted opportunity. It could have been worse as Declan Rice - of all people - conceded a penalty for a trip on Emerson deep into injury time but Said Behrahma saw his spot kick saved by Arsenal keeper David Raya.\nMikel Arteta stood on the touchline, soaked by the rain in North London, stewing on Arsenal’s third defeat of the season and will no doubt feel aggrieved that VAR technology could not prove decisively one way or another. But one thing that was clear and obvious was Arsenal’s need for a proper striker, a real No9 to put in the sitters which Gabriel Jesus wasted from point blank range.\nTitle races are decided by small margins and slip-ups are not allowed because Liverpool stay top and Manchester City are certain to click into top gear at some stage. Arsenal looked flat, tired and dejected as they ran out of steam and energy once West Ham went ahead.\nDid Arsenal deserve their defeat? Have your say in the comments section\nThe squad does look thin and in need of fresh legs. It is all very well for Arteta to demand the fans turn up the volume and create a big atmosphere but the players have to deliver as well and the truth is they have not hit top gear this season.\nIt all went wrong from the moment of controversy. West Ham full back Emerson swung over a cross from the left, Arsenal defenders Gabriel and Oleksandr Zinchenko got themselves in a mess and Jarrod Bowen pulled the ball back.\nThere was Soucek to force home. The visitors went wild but celebrations had to be put on hold for what felt like an eternity because of a lengthy VAR check. Bowen’s body was blocking the view and, try as they might, the VAR could not find a definitive angle. Nor could TV to show the viewers. So the goal stood.\nArteta was furious after Arsenal’s defeat at Newcastle when they could not prove the ball went out of play before Anthony Gordon’s winner and it felt like history was repeating itself. But Arsenal could not lift themselves. Bukayo Saka's header forced a terrific save from West Ham keeper Alphonse Areola. Saka also hit the post.\nThen disaster struck as Mavropanos headed in James Ward-Prowse’s 55th minute corner. He did not celebrate out of respect for his old club when, frankly, most fans had forgotten he played for Arsenal.\nTwice, Jesus missed gilt edged headed chances, putting one over the crossbar and the other straight at Areola as it just was not Arsenal’s night.\nJoin our new WhatsApp community!

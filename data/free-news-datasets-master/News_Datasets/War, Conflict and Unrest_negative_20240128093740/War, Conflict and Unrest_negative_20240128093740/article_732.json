Hundreds of protestors marched to the site in an organised 'Flood NYC For Palestine' gathering.The demonstrators chose the World Trade Center site, a location of profound historical significance, the same place where the horrific 9/11 attacks took place, to stage their protest. JUST IN: Pro-Palestinian protesters have shut down the entrance to the World Trade Center in New York City.Hundreds of protesters decided to use the World Trade Center, the same location where the 9/11 attacks took place, to stage their protest.The incident comes just one day… pic.twitter.com/AAGvzs9KOq— Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) December 28, 2023 ]]>They could be heard chanting \\\"Free, Free Palestine\\\", \\\"Palestine Will Be Free\\\" in videos being posted online.Another chant that took up traction among them was \\\"1,2,3,4, Occupation No More\\\".The incident comes just one day after pro-Palestinian protesters blocked off the entrance to the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.As videos from the scene start to get circulated widely online, people have started calling for stricter actions against protestors who choose to block any public places for their causes.Many people online are left fuming at the pro-Palestinian supporters choosing the site of the 9/11 attacks for their protest, calling it a desecration, and asking for authorities to take action against those at the gathering.Authored by Feba Bovas",

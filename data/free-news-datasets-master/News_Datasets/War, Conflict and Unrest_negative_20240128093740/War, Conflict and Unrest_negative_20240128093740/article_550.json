Israeli officials say Judi Weinstein Haggai was actually murdered during the October 7th slaughter of Israelis by Hamas, but that they have been holding her body captive ever since. Haggai is a 70-year-old New York native who was an English teacher and specialized in working with special needs children, according to [Israeli](https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/382714) and [U.S. media reports](https://nypost.com/2023/12/28/news/judi-weinstein-haggai-new-york-native-held-hostage-in-gaza-has-been-killed/). Their Kibbutz Nir Oz last week announced the death of her husband, Gadi Haggai, 73, who was also a U.S. citizen who was taken captive by Hamas. Officials believe he died after being wounded when Hamas took him captive on Oct. 7, per [The Times of Israel.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/kibbutz-says-gadi-haggai-abducted-oct-7-died-in-hamas-captivity-body-held-in-gaza/) Gadi Haggai’s body is also being held in Gaza. [Just The News](https://justthenews.com/world/middle-east/second-american-hostage-gaza-confirmed-dead-hamas-holds-body) reports that the couple had been out for a walk the morning of Oct. 7, and their last contact with friends that day was a message about how they had been shot. According to [Fox News ](https://www.foxnews.com/world/judi-haggai-becomes-second-american-hostage-die-gaza-during-israel-hamas-war)six Americans are still being held hostage by Hamas, including Itay Chen, 19; Edan Alexander, 19; Omer Neutra, 21; Sagui Dekel-Chen- 35; Hersh Goldberg Polin and Keith Samuel Siegel.

Authorities were alerted at approximately 7:37 a.m., prompting a swift response from law enforcement. [According to reports from Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/us/police-investigating-active-shooter-scene-high-school-perry-iowa), Dallas County Sheriff Adam Infante addressed reporters, revealing that officers rushed to the scene within seven minutes of receiving the active shooter report. Additionally, there were multiple victims but their conditions have yet to be released, Sheriff Infante assured the public that there is no ongoing threat. “The community is safe,” stated Sheriff Infante, emphasizing that authorities are diligently working to gather information and provide updates. The incident occurred before the start of the school day, potentially mitigating the impact as fewer students and faculty were present. Infante expressed gratitude for the minimized occupancy during the shooting, stating, “Luckily, there were very few students and faculty in the building, which I think contributed to a good outcome in that sense.” Multiple law enforcement agencies, including the sheriff’s office, Perry Police Department, and federal entities such as the FBI and ATF, swiftly responded to the scene. While a suspect has been identified, their name has not been disclosed to the public at this time. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) vehicles were dispatched to the location, indicating the severity of the incident. Federal agents on the ground from the FBI and ATF are collaborating with local authorities in the ongoing investigation. [Perry High School](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2024/01/04/police-at-perry-high-school-in-iowa-amid-reports-of-school-shooting/72105587007/), part of the Perry Community School District, is situated approximately 25 miles northwest of Des Moines. The school district, hosting around 1,785 students, was reopening after the winter break, making Thursday the first day back for students. As the community grapples with the aftermath of this tragic event, details are expected to emerge in subsequent updates, including a scheduled news conference by the Dallas County’s Emergency Management Agency later in the morning. The incident underscores the persistent concern of school-related violence, prompting renewed discussions on safety measures and mental health support within educational institutions.

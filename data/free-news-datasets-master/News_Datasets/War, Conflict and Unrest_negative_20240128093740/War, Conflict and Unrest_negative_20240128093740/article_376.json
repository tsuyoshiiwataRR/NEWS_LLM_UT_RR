    "text": "Between the end of February 2022 and the beginning of this month, 19,847 people have been detained in Russia for speaking out or protesting against the war, according to a rights group. Advertisement Artyom Kamardin, a Russian poet, received a 7-year prison sentence for reading anti-war verses during a street demonstration in Moscow in September 2022. Moscow's Tverskoy District Court convicted Kamardin on charges of undermining national security and inciting hatred. Yegor Shatovba, who attended the event and recited Kabardin's verses, was sentenced to 5 1/2 years on the same charges. Kamardin told the court that he did not know his actions broke the law and had asked for mercy. “I am not a hero and going to jail for my beliefs was never in my plans,” he said in a statement posted on his supporters' Telegram channel. The gathering next to a monument to poet Vladimir Mayakovsky was held days after President Vladimir Putin ordered the mobilization of 300,000 reserve troops amid Moscow's military setbacks in Ukraine. The widely unpopular move prompted thousands of people to flee Russia to avoid conscription. Police immediately dispersed the demonstration and soon arrested Kamardin and several other participants. Russian media quoted Kamardin's friends and her lawyer as saying that police beat and raped her during her arrest. Shortly thereafter, a police video released by pro-Kremlin media showed him apologizing for his actions, with bruises on his face. Authorities have taken no action to investigate alleged misconduct by police. During Thursday's hearing, Kamardin's wife, Alexandra Popova, shouted “Shame!” After shouting, he was thrown out of the courtroom by the bailiffs. After the decision. Popova and others were later detained for an unsanctioned “rally” outside the court building. According to the OVD-Info rights group, between the end of February 2022 and the beginning of this month, 19,847 people have been detained in Russia for speaking out or protesting against the war, while 794 people have been criminally charged because of their anti-war stance. Has been implicated in the cases. Monitors political arrests and provides legal assistance. The action comes under a law adopted days after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine that effectively criminalizes any public expression about the war that deviates from the official narrative.",

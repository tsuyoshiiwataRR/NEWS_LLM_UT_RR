    "text": "ADVERTISEMENT A Russian poet, Artyom Kamardin, received a 7-year prison sentence for reciting anti-war verses during a street performance in Moscow, in September 2022.\nMoscow's Tverskoi District Court convicted Kamardin on charges of making calls undermining national security and inciting hatred.\nYegor Shtovba, who participated in the event and recited Kamardin's verses, was sentenced to 5 1/2 years on the same charges.\nKamardin had told the court he did not know his actions broke the law and asked for mercy.\n\"I am not a hero, and going to prison for my beliefs was never in my plans,\" he said in a statement, posted on his supporters' Telegram channel.\nThe gathering next to the monument to poet Vladimir Mayakovsky was held days after President Vladimir Putin ordered a mobilization of 300,000 reservists amid Moscow's military setbacks in Ukraine.\nThe widely unpopular move prompted hundreds of thousands to flee Russia to avoid being recruited into the military.\nPolice swiftly dispersed the performance and soon arrested Kamardin and several other participants.\nRussian media quoted Kamardin's friends and his lawyer as saying that police beat and raped him during the arrest. Soon after, he was shown apologizing for his action in a police video released by pro-Kremlin media, his face bruised.\nAuthorities have taken no action to investigate the alleged abuse by police.\nRussian artist sentenced to 7 years in prison for anti-war messages During Thursday's hearing, Kamardin's wife, Alexandra Popova, was escorted out of the courtroom by bailiffs after she shouted “Shame!” following the verdict. Popova and others were later detained for an unsanctioned \"rally\" outside the court building.\nBetween late February 2022 and earlier this month, 19,847 people have been detained in Russia for speaking out or protesting against the war while 794 people have been implicated in criminal cases over their anti-war stance, according to the OVD-Info rights group, which tracks political arrests and provides legal assistance.\nThe crackdown has been carried out under a law Moscow adopted days after sending troops to Ukraine that effectively criminalized any public expression about the war deviating from the official narrative.\nShare this article Comments You might also like Mexico’s new army-run airline promises cheap tickets and new routes Ukrainian grain ship hits Russian mine in Black Sea Romania, Bulgaria to partially enter Schengen after striking deal with Austria Russia poet Freedom of speech Russia-Ukraine invasion Ukraine war sentence ADVERTISEMENT Most read Clean-up begins after Maersk loses shipping containers in North Sea Countries across Europe heighten security levels Seat up, blind open, lights dimmed: Airline safety rules explained Worst is yet to come with floods in Netherlands, Germany and Norway Inside the world’s first reactor that could produce unlimited energy ADVERTISEMENT Top stories Now playing Next Fears Israel Hamas war could 'expand' amid strikes on central Gaza Now playing Next US sends last military aid to Ukraine for now Now playing Next Ukrainian grain ship hits Russian mine in Black Sea Now playing Next Romania, Bulgaria to partially enter Schengen after deal with Austria Now playing Next John Cleese apologises for comparing Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler",

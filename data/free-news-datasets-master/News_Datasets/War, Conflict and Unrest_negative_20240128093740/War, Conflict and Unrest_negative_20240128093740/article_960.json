    "text": "Russia deploys missile carriers to the Black Sea (t.me/SJTF_Odes)\nRussian terrorists have deployed two submarines and the Admiral Makarov frigate for combat duty in the Black Sea, according to the press service of the Defense Forces of Southern Ukraine.\nCurrently, the combined salvo of Kalibr missiles can reach up to 16.\n“Reminder: air alarm signals warn of danger! Listen carefully and react promptly. Take care of yourselves as we protect Ukraine,” added the press service.\nRussian sea blockade\nRussian terrorists are using the Black and Azov Seas for their military objectives. The Azov Sea is currently under complete enemy control.\nAfter the liberation of Snake Island, the dominance of terrorists in the Black Sea has been reduced. However, after Russia’s withdrawal from the grain deal, civilian navigation is again under threat, despite successfully breaking through the enemy sea blockade in recent months.\nIn mid-December, the spokesperson for the Southern Defense Forces, Natalia Humeniuk, mentioned that Russia’s fleet is currently less active in the Black and Azov Seas. Presumably, the enemy is anticipating freezing temperatures.",

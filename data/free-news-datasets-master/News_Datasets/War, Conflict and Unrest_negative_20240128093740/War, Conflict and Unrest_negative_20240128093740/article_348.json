    "text": "In view of the shocking situation in Palestine, Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar on Thursday said that the government of Pakistan has completely banned all kinds of events regarding the New Year celebrations to express solidarity with the oppressed Palestinians. In a special televised message, he urged the general public to show solidarity with the oppressed people of Gaza and observe simplicity at the beginning of the New Year. PM Kakar said the entire Pakistani nation and the Muslim Ummah were deeply saddened by the massacre of the oppressed Palestinians, especially the innocent children, and the genocide of innocent Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. “Since October 7, 2023, more than 21,000 innocent Palestinians have been martyred due to the brutality of the Israeli forces, including a large number of innocent children, which has reached around 9,000,” the prime minister remarked. He said that to stop the Israeli bloodshed, Pakistan had raised its voice for the oppressed Palestinians at every forum of the world and it would always continue to speak in future as well. The prime minister pointed out that Pakistan had sent two consignments of relief goods to help its Palestinian brothers and sisters, while the third consignment was also being sent soon. Likewise, he said that the government of Pakistan was in close contact with Egypt and Jordan for timely relief of the Palestinians, evacuation of the injured from Gaza and their treatment. The prime minister prayed to Allah Almighty that the sun of the New Year may rise with the message of peace, prosperity and harmony for Pakistan and the rest of the world. The Gaza health ministry said on Thursday that the recorded toll in the enclave was 21,110 killed and 55,243 wounded in barbaric Israeli attacks. Nearly all of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes. Israel retaliated to Hamas’ October 7 attack with a relentless bombardment and a siege followed by a ground invasion. Since the siege went into effect, Gaza’s 2.4 million people have been suffering severe shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine, with only limited aid entering the territory. An estimated 1.9 million Gazans have been displaced, according to the UN.",

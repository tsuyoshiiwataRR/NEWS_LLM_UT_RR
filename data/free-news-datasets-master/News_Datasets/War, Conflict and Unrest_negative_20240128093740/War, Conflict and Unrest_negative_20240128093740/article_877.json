    "text": "Joe Flacco has the Browns on the cusp of something special. Cleveland's starting signal-caller was a mere fan weeks ago. But after returning to the fore following Deshaun Watson's season-ending injury, Flacco has had the Browns rolling. It started with a standout showing against the Rams, a game in which he threw two touchdown passes in his first game in a year. One week later, he made that state line look like chump change, tossing three touchdowns and hitting the 300-yard mark as Cleveland vanquished Trevor Lawrence and the Jaguars. The good times have continued as December has worn on. Last week, Flacco conjured up perhaps his most impressive feat, leading the Browns beyond a resilient Texans squad to bring Cleveland one step closer to the golden ticket of postseason qualification. He's formed partnerships across the field, firing efforts to David Njoku and Amari Cooper with increasing regularity. Backed by a hulking defense — one that was paramount in victories against the 49ers and Ravens, among others — Flacco has a good chance as any to keep the Browns in high hopes. And once the weather starts to freeze, few are better than Joe Cool. If you need any evidence, just take a glimpse at his jewelry — namely the Super Bowl ring he acquired as a member of the Ravens in 2013. Every journey starts with a single step. For Cleveland, that step will be covered in sickly green: the Browns take on the Jets in this week's iteration of 'Thursday Night Football.'

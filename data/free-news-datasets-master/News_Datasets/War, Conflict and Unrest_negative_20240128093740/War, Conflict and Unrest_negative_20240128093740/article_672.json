    "title": "Canadian Israeli Judih Weinstein was killed during Oct. 7 attack, kibbutz says",
    "text": "Judih Weinstein, a Canadian Israeli woman whose fate had been unknown since the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas, died during the initial attack, her kibbutz said in a statement on Thursday.\n“With great sorrow Kibbutz Nir Oz announces the murder” of Weinstein, a news release from a kibbutz spokesperson said.\nThe kibbutz said she was fatally wounded on Oct. 7, along with her husband, Gad Haggai, whose death had been confirmed last week. Weinstein had been the only Canadian still missing after the Hamas attack.\n“Their bodies remain held in captivity by Hamas,” the statement says. It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined her death.\nThe 70-year-old grew up in Canada and held Canadian and U.S. citizenship. She was born in New York state but moved to Toronto at the age of three, and then moved to Israel 20 years later to live with Haggai.\nWeinstein was a mother of four and a grandmother of seven.\n“Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” the family said in a statement.\n“She will be remembered for her compassion, her peaceful nature, and the creative life she built with her husband.”\nHer brother, Larry Weinstein, told CBC News last month that she was “infused” with music, poetry and writing.\n“She wrote thousands of haiku, which were about her surroundings and about peace,” he said. “She taught mindfulness to children whenever there were attacks.”\nRacked with uncertainty Weinstein’s family had been racked with uncertainty since the attack, unsure of whether she was alive or dead.\nHer niece, Ali Weinstein, spoke to CBC News Network in late November and said the last known details of the couple’s life were from when she called for help and reported that she and her husband were hurt.\nHer family says the couple were out for an early-morning walk when they encountered the militants. “We do know, from Judih’s phone calls … that both of them were shot,” her niece said.\nIsraeli officials later told family members that Weinstein’s cellphone signal was detected within Gaza, her family said.\nAli Weinstein told The Canadian Press in a separate interview that the family was on an emotional roller-coaster, feeling grief, joy for the hostages who had been released during a pause in fighting and dread each time her aunt wasn’t among those released.\nShe said Canadian officials were more responsive than their American and Israeli counterparts, with two RCMP officers in touch nearly every day, despite there being few new facts to share.\nCanada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly said Thursday in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that Canada is mourning the loss of Weinstein.\n“It is with heavy heart that we learned of the passing of Judy Weinstein today who is believed to have been killed by Hamas on Oct. 7,” the post reads. “I have met with her family and they have described her as loving, kind, and compassionate. Canada mourns her loss with her family and loved ones.”\nAli Weinstein, the niece of Judih Weinstein and her husband, Gad Haggai, is shown in Toronto on Nov. 29. (Sam Nar/CBC)\nU.S. President Joe Biden said he and his wife, Jill Biden, were “devastated” by the news of Judih Weinstein’s death.\n“No family should have to endure such an ordeal,” Biden said in a statement. “And I reaffirm the pledge we have made to all the families of those still held hostage: we will not stop working to bring them home.”\nAbout 1,200 people were killed in the initial Hamas attack, according to Israeli tallies, including several Canadians.\nNir Oz Kibbutz was one of the hardest-hit locations, with roughly one-quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped.\nFamily calls for peace According to an official Israeli tally, more than 120 people are still being held in Gaza, after more than 100 were repatriated in a November truce or recovered during a military offensive.\nTwenty-three have been confirmed dead, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has said, with the Israel Defence Forces admitting it mistakenly killed three hostages during an operation.\nWeinstein’s family said they were also unsure whether to voice their dismay at how Israel has responded to the attacks, with constant airstrikes and a siege on Gaza that the United Nations says violates international humanitarian law.\nWeinstein is shown with her husband, Gad Haggai, in an undated photo shared on social media by the Israeli consulate in Toronto. She had been missing since the Oct. 7 attacks and was believed to have been taken hostage in Gaza. Her kibbutz said on Thursday that both were killed on Oct. 7. (IsraelInToronto/X)\nIn its latest update on casualties, Gaza’s Health Ministry said 21,320 Palestinians had been killed and 55,603 injured in Israeli strikes since Oct. 7.\nWeinstein’s family also said early this month that they were distressed by the rise in hateful speech toward both Jews and Muslims in Canada.\n“We’re inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,” Larry Weinstein said on Dec. 4.\n“There can’t be any kind of resolution when people are at each other’s throats.”",

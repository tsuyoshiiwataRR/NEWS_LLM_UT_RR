    "text": "[Conflicts & War](https://www.laprensalatina.com/category/conflicts-war/) Israel continues offensive in Gaza, but medium-term plan unclear Jerusalem, Dec 28 (EFE). – The Israeli army continued its offensive in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, where heavy fighting with Hamas continues, but despite Israel’s declaration that it is committed to the long term, the medium-term scenario of its offensive remains unclear. As Hamas disseminates videos showing its militias ambushing and attacking Israeli troops and tanks, the Israeli army continues to carry out operations in the north, center and south of the Strip. In the southern city of Khan Younis, Israeli forces carried out an “unprecedented mission,” according to Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. “Our forces reach areas that we have never been before, taking over control rooms and eliminating terrorists,” said Gallant on Thursday. In turn, the troops intensified their military incursion in the southern area of the Strip, an operation they began weeks ago to reach the militia’s command centers and weapons depots. Gallant reiterated Israel’s intention to dismantle Hamas in order to hamper its military and governmental capabilities. At least 167 Israeli soldiers have died since the ground invasion of Gaza began on October 27, bringing the total number of soldiers – active and reserve – killed since the Hamas attack on October 7 to more than 500. Meanwhile, Israeli attacks and bombings have continued to claim Palestinian lives in recent hours. According to the Wafa news agency, dozens of Gazans died Thursday in bombings of homes in southern Gaza, an area where a large portion of the enclave’s 1.9 million internally displaced people are concentrated. In the town of Rafah, the southernmost point of the enclave, “at least 20 citizens were killed and dozens injured as a result of an Israeli bombing that targeted a house,” it reported. Israeli warplanes also “targeted a house in the Shaboura refugee camp” in Rafah, also causing “dozens of deaths and injuries, most of them women and children,” said the news agency On the other hand, more than 25 people died in several attacks on Khan Yunis, reported the same source. Over 21,300 people have died in the two and a half months of the offensive, which has caused an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. The Israeli assault on Gaza has caused severe shortages of food, basic supplies, medicine, drinking water, and gasoline for electricity. Among other incidents, attacks were reported in the northern towns of Beit Hanun or Beit Lahia, including dozens of deaths, while Israeli troops continue to attack the Al Maghazi refugee camp in the city of Deir, which has been under almost constant bombardment in recent days. The medical services of the Palestinian Red Crescent reported that its teams transferred three dead and six wounded to the hospital after attacks on a house in the Al Maghazi camp. Their medical teams are also now working with the Egyptian Red Crescent to set up a camp for displaced people in the Khan Younis area, which is expected to reach 1,000 tents. All of this is happening while Israel is planning its medium-term actions in Gaza and a post-war plan that seems to be undecided at the moment, causing concern to its main ally, the United States. On Thursday, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with Gallant and discussed aspects of the stabilization phase that must follow combat operations, according to the Pentagon. The White House is reportedly pressuring Israel to reduce the intensity of attacks on Gaza, although Gallant recently said they could continue for several months.",

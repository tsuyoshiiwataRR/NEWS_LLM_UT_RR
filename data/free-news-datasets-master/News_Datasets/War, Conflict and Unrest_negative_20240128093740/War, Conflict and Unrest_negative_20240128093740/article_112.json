    "text": "The head of the Department for Combating Crimes Committed in the Context of Armed Conflict of the Prosecutor General's Office, Yuriy Belousov, said that law enforcement officers had identified the names of Ukrainian prisoners of war who were shot by Russian occupiers in Zaporizhzhya Region, Ukrinform [reports](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3805928-vstanovleni-imena-ukrainskih-polonenih-rozstrilanih-rosianami-na-zaporizzi-ogp.html). \"We can confirm the authenticity of the video. We have identified our servicemen who were brutally killed... We have data on a specific brigade and specific names, and they will be exposed soon,\" Belousov said on Radio Liberty. According to Belousov, law enforcement officers have reason to believe that representatives of the 76th Airborne Division of the Russian Federation, which is known for its war crimes committed in the Kyiv Region, were involved in the killing of Ukrainian POWs. The representative of the Prosecutor Generalâ€™s office stressed that this case is not isolated and, according to Ukrainian law enforcement, dozens of cases of killing of Ukrainian prisoners of war by Russians have been recorded. \"Only during the last month, there was already a case of using our prisoners of war as human shields in the area of this settlement. This indicates the systematic nature of the practice and that this is not an isolated case. The Russian command, whose subordinates are committing these crimes, knows this for sure,\" Belousov said. He called the shooting of Ukrainian soldiers a cynical violation of the Third Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War.",

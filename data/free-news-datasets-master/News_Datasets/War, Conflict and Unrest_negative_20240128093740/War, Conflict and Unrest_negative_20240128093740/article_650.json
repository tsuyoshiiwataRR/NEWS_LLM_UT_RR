    "text": "Ukrainian Strike Hits Russian Landing Ship Novocherkassk in Crimea\nSatellite imagery has unveiled the significant damage sustained by the Russian tank landing ship Novocherkassk following an offensive by Ukrainian forces on a port situated in Crimea. The visuals, provided by Maxar Technologies, showcase the aftermath of the attack with the vessel appearing to be engulfed in smoke, disconnected from the dock, and partially submerged in water.\nThis incident marks a key moment in the Ukrainian counteroffensive, demonstrating their capability to strike high-value targets. Ukraine has declared success in destroying the Novocherkassk at the port of Feodosia—a claim countered by Moscow, asserting only damage occurred. Prior satellite images capture the ship before the strike, fully intact, highlighting the extent of the inflicted damages post-attack.\nA Ukrainian Navy spokesperson expressed difficulties in obtaining precise casualty figures given the Russian occupation of Crimea. Nonetheless, the realistic possibility of crew casualties was noted, considering the full capacity of the ship usually hosts about 80 people.\nThe Novocherkassk, a Ropucha-class landing ship detailed in a US military fact sheet, is quite substantial, equivalent in size to a US Navy littoral combat ship. Its design supports beach landings and can carry a crew complement of approximately 87 personnel, with additional capacity for 237 troops.\nFurther adding to the strategic significance of this strike, the Ukrainian Air Force commander reported that the Novocherkassk had been transporting Iranian-made Shahed attack drones. This incident follows the previous sinking of the Moskva, another principal vessel of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, reinforcing Ukraine’s resolve against Russian military resources.\nWhile Russia’s Defense Ministry has acknowledged the events, firm verification of the attack’s details remains challenging. Despite this, reports from Russian authorities confirm at least one casualty and several injuries due to the offensive. The attack denotes another considerable setback for Russian military operations, coinciding with Ukraine’s persistent defense in the east and the potential threat to the strategic city of Avdiivka. The ongoing conflict continues to exhibit high-stakes encounters with repercussions on both sides.\nFAQs about the Attack on the Russian Landing Ship Novocherkassk\nWhat happened to the Russian tank landing ship, Novocherkassk?\nSatellite imagery showed significant damage to the Russian tank landing ship Novocherkassk following an attack by Ukrainian forces on a port in Crimea.

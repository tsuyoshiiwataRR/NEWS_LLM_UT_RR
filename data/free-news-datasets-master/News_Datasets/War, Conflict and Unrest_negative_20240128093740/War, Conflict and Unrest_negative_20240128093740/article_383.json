(Charly TRIBALLEAU)\nHundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters took to the streets of New York on Thursday, staging a mock funeral in a demonstration against Israel's continued heavy bombardement of the besieged Gaza strip.\nHolding banners demanding an immediate ceasefire, the activists gathered in Manhattan's Bryant Park while some briefly stood in the middle of the busy Sixth Avenue in the heart of New York's Midtown district.\nSeveral women shrouded in black held baby dolls swaddled in white cloths to represent the toll the fighting has taken on children in the coastal territory.\nThe mock funeral procession headed to New York's iconic Times Square where the protest continued with giant electronic advertisements as a backdrop.\n\"Today's action is to draw attention to the fact that, as of now, almost 10,000 children, just children alone, not counting everybody, not counting all Palestinians, have been killed... in Gaza,\" said archivist Grace Lile, 64.\nThe war, which started with Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, has devastated much of northern Gaza, and the bombardment and fighting has intensified especially in the southern city of Khan Yunis.\nIsrael has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for the October 7 attack, which left about 1,140 people dead, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\nIsrael's relentless aerial bombardment and ground invasion have killed at least 21,320 people, mostly women and children, according to Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry.\nNew York City has seen dozens of protests since the October 7 attack and Israel's military response, with both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel demonstrators taking to the streets.\nabr-gw/mdl\nTRENDING Davina McCall stormed off Masked Singer after close friend was unmasked Yahoo TV UK · 2-min read Wealthy businessman who secretly filmed himself having sex with woman has to pay £500 in damages The Telegraph · 3-min read Putin sends revenge squads into Crimea after destruction of warship The Telegraph · 3-min read ‘Perplexing’ details emerge as missing pregnant teen and boyfriend found dead with gunshot wounds The Independent · 3-min read Doctor caught on video camera punching patient during surgery suspended after outrage The Independent · 2-min read",

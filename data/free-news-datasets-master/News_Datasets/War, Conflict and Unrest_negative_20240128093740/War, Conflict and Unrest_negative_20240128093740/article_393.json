    "text": "A Moscow court on Thursday sentenced two men to years in prison for taking part in the recital of verses against the Ukraine campaign during an anti-mobilisation protest last year.\nArtyom Kamardin, 33, received a seven-year sentence for reciting a poem, and Yegor Shtovba, 23, was sentenced to five and a half years for attending the protest. The two were seen behind a glass partition in a heavily guarded courtroom.\nJust before his sentencing, a smiling Kamardin recited a poem that refers to poetry as “gut-wrenching” and often disliked by “people accustomed to order”.\nAfter the sentence was read out, there were cries of “Shame!” from supporters in the courtroom, some of whom were later detained by police outside the court building, an AFP reporter saw.\nArtyom Kamardin and Yegor Shtovba were kept in a glass cage in the courtroom. Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images Russian authorities have detained thousands for simple acts of protest against the offensive in Ukraine, with criticism in effect outlawed.\nKamardin has claimed that during his detention he was raped by police officers and forced to film an apology video as officers threatened his partner.\nOn the eve of his arrest in September 2022, he had recited his poem “Kill me, militia man!” on a Moscow square where dissidents have been gathering since the Soviet era.\nKamardin also shouted offensive slogans against the imperial “New Russia” project aiming to annex the south of Ukraine.\nRussian rapper jailed amid backlash over ‘almost naked’ party at Moscow nightclub\nRead more Both were convicted of “inciting hatred” and “calling for activities threatening state security”.\nKamardin told the court he did not know his actions broke the law and asked for mercy. “I am not a hero, and going to prison for my beliefs was never in my plans,” he said in a statement, posted on his supporters’ Telegram channel.\nAfter the sentencing, his father, Yury, said: “This is a total outrage!”\nAbout two dozen friends came to support the defendants along with the poets’ parents and wives.\nKamardin’s wife, Alexandra Popova, was in the crowd. “It is a very harsh sentence. Seven years for poems, for a non-violent crime,” she told AFP, before being taken away by police officers.\nIn an interview with AFP in late 2022, she had recounted her then boyfriend’s arrest, saying officers threatened her with “gang-rape”, hit her and sprayed superglue on her cheeks and mouth.\nAlexandra Popova. Her husband, Artyom, says he was tortured after being taken into custody in Moscow. Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images Meanwhile, Kamardin was taken to a separate room, where – as he told his lawyer – he was beaten and raped with a barbell. Kamardin was also forced to film an apology video.\nShtovba also insisted he did not break the law. In his last statement in court, published by independent site Mediazona, he asked the judge: “What have I done that’s illegal? Read poetry?”\nHe also addressed his mother, whom he said depended on him financially. “Mom, I know that you, more than anyone, believe in my innocence … Still, I’m sorry for how things turned out, leaving you and Dad alone.”\nNikolai Dayneko, who was arrested at the same time, was sentenced to four years in prison last May after entering a pre-trial agreement, according to OVD-info.\nThese are the latest in a string of heavy sentences against Russians who protested against the offensive, in trials critics denounce as absurd.\nGermany’s foreign ministry condemned Thursday’s verdict, accusing the Kremlin of “letting the judiciary stifle freedom of expression”.\nIn mid-November judge Oksana Demiasheva sentenced artist Aleksandra Skochilenko to seven years in prison for swapping price tags with slogans criticising Russia’s offensive in Ukraine. Skochilenko had replaced five price tags in a branch of one of Russia’s largest supermarket chains in St Petersburg with messages about the conflict.\nThe trials of ordinary Russians usually take place away from public attention, unlike those of prominent critics.\nMost of Russia ’s high-profile opposition figures have fled the country or are behind bars, including Alexei Navalny.\n Russia Ukraine Europe news\nReuse this content",

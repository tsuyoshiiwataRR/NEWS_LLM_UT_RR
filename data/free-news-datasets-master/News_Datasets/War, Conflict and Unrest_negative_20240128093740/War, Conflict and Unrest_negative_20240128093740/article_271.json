    "text": "Whatever happened to [that hunger strike](https://twitchy.com/brettt/2023/11/27/author-of-palestine-a-socialist-introduction-announces-hunger-strike-in-front-of-white-house-n2390224) that was going on in front of the White House to pressure President Biden to call for a ceasefire in Gaza? \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon was part of it, so it was kind of high-profile. That just disappeared. And then there were masked White House staffers who gathered in front of the White House and spelled out \"ceasefire\" in candles. But this â€¦ this is art. If your eyes weren't opened before to the atrocities Israel is committing in Gaza, they are now. Watch as Israel's genocide is acted out. In front of the White House, activists stage a performance to expose whatâ€™s happening to Palestinian citizens in Gazaâ€” Sarah Wilkinson (@swilkinsonbc) [#StopGazaGenocide] [pic.twitter.com/6OgeqylDxz] [December 28, 2023] Not even the press is safe. We especially like the slow-motion shots of the milk jugs of red liquid tipping over. So much blood! The original poster says in her bio that she wants \"an end to the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestine,\" so we don't know if she filmed it or is just passing it along. In any case, it's brutal to watch. Theater kids cosplaying terrorists. Worst show ever.â€” Whateverdear (@WhateverDearest) [December 28, 2023] There is nothing real about anything these people do. We raised too many theatre kids and this is how they act out.â€” LaborIsMoney (@scrotus2024) [December 28, 2023] Fake babies and theatrics. Exactly likeâ€” Moral Tourism (@moraltourism) [#Pallywood]in Gaza. ðŸ¤¡ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡± [December 28, 2023] Remember the woman crying over [the obvious baby doll](https://twitchy.com/coucy/2023/12/01/palestinian-doll-baby-n2390379) she was passing around? That's Pallywood. Who cares? Not this American.â€” Clay (@MoodyBlueshirt) [December 28, 2023] Do they take requests? Can they recreate the opening battle from Gladiator next?â€” Turbulence Modeling (@eskomobar) [December 28, 2023] Wow, using dolls and having a Hamas terrorist pretending to a journo - itâ€™s just like whatâ€™s happening in Gaza!â€” Super Journalist (Ret) - JOURN-L of Skrypton (@Magnum_CK) [December 28, 2023] [December 28, 2023] Bullying theater kids is a good thing, actuallyâ€” Corv (@Corvaiex) [December 28, 2023] Did they also perform the rape and murder of 1200 Jews?â€” Scottie (@BuffaloBlueBear) BTW, If youâ€™re spending $150k for a degree in theatre and this is net result, you deserve to be unemployed [December 28, 2023] No different than Gaza, eh? Agitprop performative propaganda.â€” DriveByGeek (@DriveByGeek) [December 28, 2023] Youâ€™re telling me theyâ€™re wasting all the KoolAid and chalk and weâ€™re just going to do nothing about this. ðŸ˜‚â€” Josh Munoz (@SenorChoppy) [December 28, 2023] This isnâ€™t a performance. Itâ€™s a bunch of nerds lying in the middle of a juice covered street.â€” Who is John Galt? (@MikeHoncho7258) [December 28, 2023] I was really hoping the press would be killed too. 10/10â€” Bookhouseboy (@Lilliputianhead) [December 28, 2023] We'll admit it was oddly satisfying when the guy in the \"Press\" jacket got chalked. They arenâ€™t mentally stable these lot.â€” Robbie (@Robbie555666) [December 28, 2023] ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ EXCELLENT! Show us what happens when dumbasses think starting a war is a good idea.â€” Jan Wolff ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ (@JanWolf20176202) [December 28, 2023] They obviously got together and rehearsed this thing and filmed it thinking it might actually have any effect on U.S. foreign policy. This is just embarrassing and an insult to the memory of those slaughtered on October 7. *** [Join Twitchy VIP](https://twitchy.com/page/subscribe/?tpcc=twitchyvipgeneric)and use the promo code SAVEAMERICA to get 40% off your VIP membership!",

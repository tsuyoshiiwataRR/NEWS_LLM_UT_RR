    "text": "Video: Documentation of the destruction left after the massacre at the nature party in Re'im / Photo: Yotam Ronen\nAt first, she was known simply as \"The Woman in the Black Dress.\" In one of the videos, she can be seen lying on her back, her dress torn, her legs spread. Her face is so burnt that she cannot be identified, and her right hand covers her eyes. The video was filmed in the early hours of October 8 by a woman searching for her missing friend at the Nova Festival grounds, the day after the massacre of Hamas terrorists who murdered 364 Israelis, most of them young people.\nThe video went viral, and thousands of people reacted, desperate to know if the woman in the black dress was their missing friend, sister or daughter. One family knew exactly who she was - Gal Abdosh, a mother of two from Kiryat Ekron, who was declared missing along with her husband.\nWhen the terrorists reached her, while she was trapped on the road, along with a line of cars of people trying to flee the party, she sent a final WhatsApp message to her family: \"You don't understand.\"\nBased largely on video testimony — verified by The New York Times — Israeli police officials said they believed Ms. Abdoush was raped, and she became a symbol of the atrocities that befell Israeli women and girls during the Oct. 7 massacre. Israeli officials say that wherever Hamas terrorists attacked — the party, military bases along the Gaza border and kibbutzim — they abused women.\nThe Times' two-month investigation reveals painful new details, concluding that the attacks against women were not isolated incidents, but part of a broader pattern of gender-based violence on that Black Saturday.\nBased on videos, photographs, mobile phone GPS data and interviews with more than 150 people, including witnesses, medical staff, soldiers and rape counselors, the Times identified at least seven locations where Israeli women and girls appeared to have been sexually assaulted.\nFour witnesses described in graphic detail how they saw women raped and murdered in two different locations along Route 232, the same road where Abduush's half-naked body was found.\nThe Times interviewed several volunteer soldiers and medics who together described finding more than 30 bodies of women and girls at the party site and in two kibbutzim, in a condition similar to Abdouche's – spread legs, torn clothes, and signs of abuse in their genital area.\nAccording to the Times, photographs of a woman's body discovered by emergency forces were discovered in the rubble of one of the kibbutzim, with dozens of nails lodged in her thighs and groin.\nLahav 433 investigators steadily collected testimonies, but they did not specify how many women were raped, saying that most died and were buried. No survivors spoke about it publicly. Police admitted that during the shock and confusion of the events of October 7, they did not focus on collecting sperm samples from women's bodies, requesting autopsies or carefully examining crime scenes, but focused on repelling the terrorists and identifying bodies.\nA combination of chaos, great sorrow and the precepts of the Jewish religion meant that many bodies were buried as quickly as possible. Most have never been tested. This left the authorities at a loss, and it was impossible to fully explain to the families what happened to their loved ones in their final moments. Abduush's family, for example, never received a death certificate. They're still looking for answers.\nIn cases of widespread sexual violence during war, it's not unusual to have limited legal evidence, experts say. \"Armed conflict is so chaotic,\" said Adil Haka, a law professor at Rutgers and an expert on war crimes. \"People focus more on their safety than building a criminal case down the road.\" Very often, he said, sex crime cases will be reviewed years later based on testimonies from victims and witnesses.\n\"The eyewitness may not even know the victim's name,\" he added. \"But if they can testify something like, 'I saw a woman raped by this armed group,' that would be enough.\"\nSapir, a 24-year-old accountant, became one of the police's main witnesses. She attended a party with some friends, and provided investigators with graphic evidence. She told The Times she saw groups of gunmen raping and killing at least five women.\nShe said that at 8 a.m. on Oct. 7, she hid under the branches of a tree about four miles southwest of the party. She was shot in the back, covered herself with grass and lay quietly.\nMore in Walla!

She said she saw \"about 100 men,\" most of them dressed in military clothes, in and out of the vehicles. She said the men gathered along the road, passing assault rifles, grenades, small missiles and seriously wounded women, she said. \"It was like a gathering point,\" she said.\nThe first victim she said she saw was a young woman, blood running down her back, pants reaching her knees. Two terrorists raped her, Sapir said, and every time she tried to resist, she stuck a knife in her back.\nSapir then describes graphic descriptions of rape and amputation. She provided photos of her hiding place and wounds. Police sources corroborated her testimony and released a video of her, her face blurred, recounting some of what she saw.\nYura Carroll, a 22-year-old mastah, said he was hiding in the same place, and can be seen in one of Sapir's photos. He and Sapir were part of a group of friends who met at a party. Carroll said he barely lifted his head to look at the road, but he also described seeing a woman raped and murdered.\nSince that day, Sapir said, she has been battling a painful rash that has spread through her body, and she can barely sleep. Waking up at night, heart beating, covered in sweat.\nMore on the subject: Gaza War Iron Sword War rape",

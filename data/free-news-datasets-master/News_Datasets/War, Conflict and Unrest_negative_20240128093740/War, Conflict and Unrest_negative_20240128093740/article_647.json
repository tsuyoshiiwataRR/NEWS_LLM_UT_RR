    "text": "2023-12-29 00:14:29\nEmmanuel Macron and Abdelmadjid Tebboune after a press conference at the presidential palace, in Algiers, August 25, 2022. LUDOVIC MARIN / AFP\nThe state visit of Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune to France is “always subject to preparation”affirmed the Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, specifying that it depends on the settlement of five files.\n“In all sincerity, the conditions of this visit are not suitable”, declared Ahmed Attaf in an interview given Wednesday, December 28 evening to Atheer, the platform of the Qatari channel Al-Jazeera. Mr. Attaf listed the issues of memory, mobility, economic cooperation, French nuclear tests in the Algerian Sahara and that of the restitution of the sword as well as the burnous of Emir Abdelkader.\nEven though “the president had to go to the Château d’Amboise where the Emir Abdelkader was imprisoned (…) the French authorities refused [de restituer l’épée et le burnous de l’émir] arguing the need for a law »said the minister.\nRead also: French and Algerian historians relaunch the memorial dialogue in Constantine\n“We continue to work”\nConcerning the French nuclear tests, Mr. Attaf declared that Algeria requested “an acknowledgment of the damage caused” as well as “compensation”. Between 1960 and 1966, France carried out seventeen nuclear tests on the sites of Reggane, then In Ekker, in the Algerian Sahara. Documents declassified in 2013 revealed significant radioactive fallout that stretched from West Africa to southern Europe.\n“We have not reached agreements on five major and heavy issues. But we continue to work on it”reiterated the minister, emphasizing that meetings between officials of the two countries are continuing to prepare for this state visit.\nAt the beginning of August, the Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, declared that his visit to France was “always maintained” but depended ” from the program “ of the Elysée, specifying that a “state visit has conditions” et “is not a tourist visit”.\nThe stay, first scheduled for the beginning of May, had been postponed until June, the Algerians fearing that it would be spoiled by the May 1 demonstrations against the highly contested pension reform in France, according to consistent sources. This visit was to mark the improvement between the two countries after numerous diplomatic crises.\n#conditions #President #Tebbounes #visit #France #suitable",

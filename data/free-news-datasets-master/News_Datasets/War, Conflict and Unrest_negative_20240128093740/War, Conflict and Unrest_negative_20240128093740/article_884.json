    "text": "Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have reached a critical point, prompting a warning from Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz. Gantz cautioned that if the militant group continues its attacks along the Lebanon-Israel border, Israel will take action to remove Hezbollah from the area, [BBC reported.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67831478) Gantz emphasized that time for a diplomatic resolution is running out, underscoring the urgency of the situation. The Israeli military is prepared to intervene if militants persist in firing upon northern Israel, according to the minister. The head of the Israel Defense Forces, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, confirmed the military’s “very high readiness” for further confrontations in the northern region. He prioritized the restoration of security for residents in the north, acknowledging that achieving this goal will require a significant amount of time. Cross-border exchanges of fire have been escalating since Hamas’s attacks on Israel in early October, with Hezbollah intensifying its attacks on Wednesday, raising concerns about the conflict in Gaza potentially spreading throughout the region.",

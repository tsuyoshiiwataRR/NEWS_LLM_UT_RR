    "text": "US intelligence officials determined the Chinese spy balloon used a US internet provider to communicate\nU.S. intelligence officials have determined that the Chinese spy balloon that flew across the U.S. earlier this year used an American internet service provider to communicate, according to two current and one former U.S. official familiar with the assessment.\nThe balloon connected to a U.S.-based company, according to the assessment, to send and receive communications from China, primarily related to navigation of the balloon. Officials familiar with assessment said it found that the connection allowed the balloon to send burst transmissions, or high-bandwidth collections of data over short periods of time.\nThe Biden administration sought a highly secretive court order from the federal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to collect intelligence on it while it was over the U.S., according to multiple current and former U.S. officials. How the court ruled has not been disclosed.\nSuch a court order would have allowed U.S. intelligence agencies to conduct electronic surveillance on the balloon as it flew over the U.S and as it sent and received messages to and from China, the officials said, including communication sent via the American internet service provider.\nThe company denied that the Chinese balloon had used its network, a determination it said was based on its own investigation and discussions it had with U.S. officials. NBC News is not naming the provider at this time to protect the identity of its sources.\nhttps://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/national-international/us-intelligence-officials-determined-the-chinese-spy-balloon-used-a-us-internet-provider-to-communicate/4988496/",

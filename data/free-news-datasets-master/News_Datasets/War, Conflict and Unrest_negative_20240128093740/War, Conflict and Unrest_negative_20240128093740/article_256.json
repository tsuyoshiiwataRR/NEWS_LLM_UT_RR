Cancel anytime.\nThe wife of a Ukrainian refugee fatally stabbed in a random daylight attack last week is speaking for the first time since his shocking death, expressing appreciation to people who’ve reached out to help.\nYuliia Rubanik posted the statement translated from Ukrainian on a GoFundMe page created by Jasen Dillon, one of her husband Ivan’s co-workers.\n“My children and I, from the bottom of our hearts, express our gratitude to everyone who supports us in difficult grief,” she wrote. “The pain of losing a loved one cannot be quenched.”\nShe continued, thanking donors for their sympathy and support, whether they gave money, prayers or just kind words.\n“I wish that the black wing of sadness does not touch any family,” she added. “May good health, well-being, and generous helping hands return to you in the hour of need.”\nRubanik, 46, moved from Ukraine to Winnipeg with his wife and two children roughly eight months ago. They came to Canada for a better life, fleeing their war-torn country after Russia’s 2022 invasion, according to the post on the online fundraising website.\nThe assembler at Westward Industries, an electric fleet-vehicle manufacturer on Archibald Street, was attacked at Talbot Avenue and Watt Street while walking to work at about 8 a.m. on Dec. 20. He was rushed to hospital and died later in the day.\nPolice arrested Ethan Richard Gladu, 19, a few hours after the stabbing, near the Disraeli Freeway. Gladu, who was on bail and facing assault and weapons charges for alleged incidents in April and September, has been charged with second-degree murder in Rubanik’s slaying.\nDillon said he created the GoFundMe page to help the Rubanik’s family with the “unexpected costs of this tragedy.”\n“Ivan’s life, taken too soon, has left everyone in shock and feeling a great sense of loss,” Dillon wrote online.\nThe fundraiser has received nearly 1,400 donations ranging from $10 to $1,000. As of Thursday afternoon, it was only $6,000 shy of its $100,000 goal.\nA memorial service for Rubanik was held Thursday, according to the page.\nNeither Yuliia Rubanik or Dillon could be reached for comment Thursday.\njura.mcilraith@freepress.mb.ca\nAdvertisement Advertise With Us\nTweet Share Print Email Read Later",

    "text": "10:12 PM Thursday, December 28, 2023\nBooks – Masrawy\nThe Israeli occupation army published the final results of the investigation into the killing of 3 Israeli soldiers imprisoned by Hamas, at the hands of forces in the Shujaiya neighborhood in Gaza City earlier this month.\nThe investigations announced by the Israeli occupation army on Thursday said that its forces on the ground do not have “sufficient awareness” of the possibility of reaching the prisoners held by Hamas in this way and not through a special operation to rescue them, even though the occupation army claims that it has intelligence\ninformation about the potential prisoners. In the region.\nThe investigation revealed that on December 15, during heavy fighting in Shujaiya in the northern Gaza Strip, a soldier from the 17th Battalion of the Bismillakh Brigade opened fire on three figures he mistakenly identified as a threat, killing two, while the third fled to a nearby building. They were both… Alon Shimrez, Yotam Haim, and Samer Talalqa.\nCommanders at the scene called on the soldiers to stop firing in order to identify the third number. About 15 minutes later, the battalion commander heard someone from the building yelling “Help” and “They’re shooting at me” in Hebrew, and again ordered the troops to hold their fire, while the third captive was screaming.\nThe third prisoner left the building towards the forces, but two soldiers did not hear, according to the investigation, the commander’s order due to the noise of a nearby tank, so they shot the third prisoner and killed him immediately. According to the occupation army’s investigation and based on its analysis and aerial footage, the three hostages were shirtless and Someone waves a white flag as they approach the troops.\nAfter the shooting, commanders at the scene suspected that the three people they shot were Israeli prisoners and army soldiers, so they ordered their bodies transported to Israel for identification.\nAccording to the occupation army’s investigation, which was published today, the forces found a note next to a tunnel shaft in Shuja’iya with the words “Help” written in Hebrew. Next to an ID card belonging to a Hamas member. The note was taken for examination, but the investigation says there is no\ninformation linking it to the presence of prisoners in the Shujaiya area, and forces assessed that it was an attempt by Hamas to lure them into an ambush.\nAlso on December 10, forces of the Golani Brigade’s reconnaissance unit operating in Shuja’iyya raided several buildings to locate Hamas members. A dog from the Octis Dog Unit was sent inside, after which a gun battle broke out between the Qassam Brigades and Golani Brigade soldiers. The dog sent by the Army was killed. The occupation at the time, but in the midst of the fighting, Golani leaders heard a call for help in Hebrew, but the forces estimated that it was an attempt by Hamas to lure them into an ambush.\nThe Israeli occupation army says that the investigation reveals that the commanders involved have\ninformation about the presence of Israeli prisoners in the Shujaiya area, claiming that they took measures to prevent strikes on sites where prisoners were suspected to be present.\nThe investigation adds: “There was insufficient awareness among the forces in the field, in the event that the prisoners reached the army forces, or when the forces encountered prisoners while clearing buildings as part of the fighting and not as part of a special operation to release the prisoners.”\nFor his part, Israeli Chief of Staff Herzi Halevy said that the killing of the three soldiers in Gaza is a serious incident with very serious consequences.\nThe Israeli Chief of Staff continued during his speech on Thursday: “The Israeli occupation army failed in its mission to rescue the three prisoners in this incident.”\nIsraeli Chief of Staff Herzi Halevy noted: “The army leadership feels responsible for the killing of our captured soldiers during a failed attempt to liberate them.”\nHalevy added: “The shooting of the three prisoners could have been prevented, but the soldiers did the right thing in the best way according to their understanding of the event at that moment. This shooting was not proportionate to the danger and the situation. But it was carried out under complex circumstances and in intense combat conditions under threat.” “Long.”\n#failed #mission #occupation #reveals #soldiers #killed #colleagues #Gaza\n2023-12-28 20:12:00",

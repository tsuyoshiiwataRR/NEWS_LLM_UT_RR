    "text": "Israeli forces opened fire on the perpetrator of the stabbing attack, killing him (social media) A Border Police soldier and an Israeli security guard were seriously to moderately injured in a stabbing attack at the Mazmoriya checkpoint, south of occupied Jerusalem. The Israeli police said that the perpetrator of the attack arrived in his car at the checkpoint and got out of it, where he stabbed the soldier first and then the security guard, before the soldiers shot him. Al-Jazeera correspondent reported that a Palestinian was killed by Israeli bullets at the Mazmoriya checkpoint, south of occupied Jerusalem. The occupation forces shot the young man at the military checkpoint between Jerusalem and Bethlehem, and the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation said that the perpetrator of the attack is a resident of Jabal Mukaber in Jerusalem. This operation comes at the height of a security alert in the occupied West Bank, including the city of Jerusalem, which witnessed more than one stabbing and shooting attack in the midst of the war on Gaza, which has been going on for about 3 months. The Ministry of Health in Gaza announced that the toll of the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip has risen to 21,320 martyrs, and 55,603 injured, in addition to massive destruction in residential neighborhoods, vital facilities and hospitals.

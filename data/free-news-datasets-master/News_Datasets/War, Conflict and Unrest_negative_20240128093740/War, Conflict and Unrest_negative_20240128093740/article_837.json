    "text": "Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (R) sharply escalated his attacks on Donald Trump – his leading 2024 GOP presidential primary rival. Christie has focused his longshot bid on tearing down Trump and making the case that the former president is an existential threat to American democracy, given Trump’s vows to seek revenge on his domestic critics. In a new ad out Thursday, Christie highlighted Trump’s recent rhetoric and addressed calls for him to drop out of the race given Nikki Haley’s latest surge in the polls. “Some people say I should drop out of this race. Really? I’m the only one saying Donald Trump is a liar,” Christie says in the ad, adding: He pits Americans against each other. His Christmas message to anyone who disagrees with him, “Rot in hell.” He caused a riot on Capitol Hill. He’ll burn America to the ground to help himself. Every Republican leader says that in private. I’m the only one saying it in public. What kind of president do we want? A liar or someone who’s got the guts to tell the truth? New Hampshire. It’s up to you. I’m Chris Christie, and you bet I approve this message. Christie was referring to Trump’s eyebrow-raising Christmas message in which he told some of his fellow Americans to “Rot in hell.” “Merry Christmas to all, including Crooked Joe Biden’s ONLY HOPE, Deranged Jack Smith, the out of control Lunatic who just hired outside attorneys, fresh from the SWAMP (unprecedented!), to help him with his poorly executed WITCH HUNT against “TRUMP” and “MAGA.” Included also are World Leaders, both good and bad, but none of which are as evil and “sick” as the THUGS we have inside our Country who, with their Open Borders, INFLATION, Afghanistan Surrender, Green New Scam, High Taxes, No Energy Independence, Woke Military, Russia/Ukraine, Israel/Iran, All Electric Car Lunacy, and so much more, are looking to destroy our once great USA. MAY THEY ROT IN HELL. AGAIN, MERRY CHRISTMAS!” Trump wrote on Truth Social Christmas morning. Watch the full clip above.",

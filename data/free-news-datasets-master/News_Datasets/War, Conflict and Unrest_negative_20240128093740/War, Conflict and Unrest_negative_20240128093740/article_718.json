    "text": "In 2009, I covered the Gaza war known as Operation Cast Lead. International journalists, including myself, assembled in tents at El Arish crossing, on the Egyptian-Palestinian border, hoping to directly cover the news in the Gaza Strip. This was before social media empowered Gazans to broadcast live from their phones to ours.\nJournalists cover the news, but today journalists are the news. In this current conflict journalists have been killed in Gaza, Lebanon and Israel. The Committee to Protect Journalists reported at least 68 journalists and media workers have died in this war since Oct. 7, the deadliest period for journalists since the organization started compiling data three decades ago.\nThis is not the whole story. According to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, journalists are actively being targeted. The fate of journalists in Gaza is especially poignant because they provide a window into a world that has been cut off from international press and independent reporting (with the exception of one CNN journalist).\nThe Geneva Convention, a fundamental part of international humanitarian law, requires protection of civilians and journalists during armed conflict. But in Gaza, it’s almost as though journalists are being treated as combatants. Their deaths have become mere numbers, counted among the death toll of more than 20,000. One might cynically conclude that the deaths of nearly six dozen journalists is just par for the course in a war that is marked by indiscriminate bombing. But these journalists were informing the world, providing understanding and footage of Israel’s relentless assault that numbers and statistics alone cannot capture.\nIn fact, faced with this terrible number of journalist deaths, on Dec. 15, five U.S. senators wrote a letter to President Joe Biden asking for greater protection for journalists in Gaza and for foreign journalists to be allowed in: “We write to you today because we are deeply concerned about the inability of international journalists to enter and report from Gaza and the lack of safety for journalists covering the war in Gaza, which keeps the public from understanding the full dimensions of this war.” They also called on Egypt and Israel to lift restrictions on reporting from Gaza.\nWhen I first attempted to enter Gaza with my tape recorder and notebook in 2009, the Egyptian authorities blocked me and other journalists from doing so without the written consent of our embassies. This was quite unusual, but I was hungry to report from Gaza. I already had a letter signed by my boss at Al-Masaa newspaper saying that my assignment required me to enter Gaza. But I had to drive eight hours across the Sinai Desert to the Moroccan Embassy in Cairo.\nI was surprised by a strange request from the Moroccan consular official: “You must sign a complete waiver to absolve the Kingdom of Morocco of responsibility if you are subjected to harm or killed.” I was excited to report from Gaza and signed the document without a second thought, and it wasn’t until much later that I noted how strange it was for my country to make me sign a waiver of liability should I die in a foreign land.\nNow the killing of journalists in Gaza is being normalized with no one taking responsibility.\nLast year, the world was stunned by the killing of Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh as she reported from the West Bank town of Jenin. In May, a year after her death, the Israel Defense Forces apologized for her killing after conceding a “high possibility” that she was shot by an Israeli soldier. Speaking about her death, chief IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said, “We want journalists to feel safe in Israel, especially in wartime.”\nHow empty these words feel right now.\nToday journalists are dying in this war at a staggering rate with zero accountability from the IDF. If this pace continues, who will be left to accurately report from this conflict zone?\nYoussef Jajili is an award-winning Moroccan journalist, writer and documentarian.

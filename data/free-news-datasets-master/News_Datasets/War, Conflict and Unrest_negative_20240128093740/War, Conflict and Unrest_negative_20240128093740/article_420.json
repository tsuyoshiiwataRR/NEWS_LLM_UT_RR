    "text": "Despite a summons from the Dominican Republic authorities investigating him to appear at their Santo Domingo offices Thursday at 11 a.m., Rays shortstop Wander Franco was a no-show.\nListin Diario, a local newspaper, showed authorities waiting for Franco outside the Offices of the Specialized Prosecutor’s Office for Children and Adolescents Thursday morning.\nSeveral reports from the Dominican Republic also said that Franco had “disempowered,” or fired, his lawyers in that country. Those lawyers notified authorities that they no longer represent the player so they could not tell him to appear.\nJudge Olga Diná, who is leading the investigation, told Listin Diario that if Franco and his representatives do not appear, they will proceed with what the criminal process makes available.\nBut, she added, it is not the right time to talk about it.\nDominican authorities have been investigating allegations that Franco had inappropriate relationships with minors. After nearly four months of no information on the investigation, the authorities made the move to search for the 22-year old on Tuesday. They searched his mother’s home in Bani, Peravia and his residence in Villa Real but could not locate Franco.\nListin Diario also reported that authorities visited several of Franco’s uncles in the Villa Majega region on Wednesday.\nThe allegations against Franco came to light publicly via social media on Aug. 13. The player appeared to deny them in a live video he broadcast on his Instagram channel that day. He has not spoken publicly since and the Rays have distanced themselves from their one-time face of the franchise.\n Franco, who signed an 11-year deal with $182 million in November 2021, initially agreed to take a one-week leave from the team. He was then placed on administrative leave under the MLB and players union’s Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy as investigations continued.\nFranco did not play in a game after Aug. 12.\nMLB traditionally has waited for any legal investigation and prosecution to take place before deciding on possible discipline. The league has served out suspensions even when there are no legal charges in several past cases.\nFranco, who is owed $2 million next season, earned his first All-Star team nod last July and was hitting .281 with 17 home runs and 58 RBI this season.\nThe Rays have been left in limbo regarding the future of the player they thought would be the foundation of their future. They have several infielders in their organization who can play shortstop, but top replacement Taylor Walls had offseason hip surgery and his availability for the beginning of the season is in question.\nTimes staff writer Juan Carlos Chavez contributed to this report.\n©2023 Tampa Bay Times.

    "text": "2023 was “a year of great turnaround and great change,” during which North Korea made great efforts to strengthen its national power and international prestige, the líder North Korean, Kim Jong-un, quoted by the state news agency KCNA. Speaking at the congress of the country's ruling party, the president noted that North Korea overcame all difficulties and challenges \"with firm confidence in our cause and unbreakable spirit.\" Additionally, Kim urged the North Korean military, military industrial complex, and nuclear weapons and civil defense sectors to “accelerate war preparations.” According to the president, the measures must be carried out on the basis of a deep analysis of the political-military situation on the Korean Peninsula, which became extremely serious, described as “unprecedented in history,” due to the steps of confrontation given by the US and its allies in the region. He also stressed the need for the country's ruling party to develop and deepen strategic cooperative relations with countries that carry out an independent foreign policy to “carry out joint anti-imperialist actions and struggle at the international level,” given the rapidly changing geopolitical situation. . Last week, Kim Jong-un signaled that his country would not hesitate to launch a nuclear attack if an enemy provoked it with nuclear weapons. He made this comment during a meeting with military personnel from the General Missile Office, in which he congratulated them on the test launch of the Hwasong-18 solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile.",

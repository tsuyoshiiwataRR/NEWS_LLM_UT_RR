    "text": "Israeli troops who accidentally shot three militant-held hostages should not have opened fire because the shooting “did not match the risk” they faced as a firefight unfolded, according to a conclusion issued Thursday by the Israeli military. The shooting took place in Gaza less than two weeks ago, shocking Israel and fueling protests aimed at pressuring the government to make a deal with Hamas for the release of the remaining hostages. “The shooting of the hostages should not have been carried out, this shooting did not match the risk and the situation,” Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Herzi Halevi wrote. “However, it was carried out under complex circumstances, and under intense combat conditions under prolonged threat.” The three men were shirtless and had emerged from a building with a white flag when Israeli troops encountered them in Shejaiya, an area of north Gaza where clashes between the military and militants had taken place for several days. Two of the hostages were shot and killed immediately, and the third ran back into the building screaming for help in Hebrew. A commander ordered troops to cease fire, but two soldiers who did not hear the order because of noise from a nearby tank shot the third person, Halevi wrote. Only later were the bodies confirmed to be those of three Israelis, Yotam Haim, Samer Talalka and Alon Shamriz. Halevi said commanders must make sure operational instructions are clear “so that we don’t kill ourselves.” “The (military) failed in the mission of rescuing the abductees in this incident,” Halevi concluded. “The entire chain of command feels responsible for the difficult event, grieves over this outcome and shares in the grief of the three families of the abductees.”",

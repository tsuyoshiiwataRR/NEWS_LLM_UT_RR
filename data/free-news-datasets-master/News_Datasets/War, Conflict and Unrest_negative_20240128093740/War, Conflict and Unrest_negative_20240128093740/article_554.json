    "text": "Damascus, the capital of Syria (STOCK PHOTO) DAMASCUS, Syria — Israeli air strikes hit southern Syria, the Syrian defense ministry said, with state media reporting attacks near the capital Damascus.\n“At approximately 23:05 (20:05 GMT) today, the Israeli enemy carried out air strikes from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan, targeting some points in the southern region,” the defense ministry said in a statement, reporting no casualties.\nIsrael rarely comments on strikes targeting Syria, but it has repeatedly said it will not allow arch-foe Iran, which backs President Bashar al-Assad’s government, to expand its presence in the country.\nADVERTISEMENT READ: Syrian defense ministry: Israeli air strikes hit near Damascus\nFEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO 14-year-old kills older sister in deadly Christmas gift dispute NEWSINFO Police car veering into bus lane causes road crash on Edsa; 5 hurt NEWSINFO LTO suspends license of overcharging taxi driver “Our air defenses are intercepting hostile targets in the vicinity of Damascus,” official news agency SANA said.\n“An Israeli attack targeted the vicinity of the capital Damascus,” state television said.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor reported Israeli strikes targeting a Syrian air defense position in the country’s southern Sweida province, as well as near Damascus international airport.\nThe attack near the airport came “one whole day after the airport resumed flights,” said the British-based monitor with a network inside Syria.\nDamascus international airport had been out of service since Israeli strikes targeted it in late November, just hours after flights resumed following similar attacks the previous month.\nThe airport was not damaged in the latest strike, Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP.\nADVERTISEMENT Israel has launched hundreds of air strikes on its northern neighbor since Syria’s civil war began in 2011, primarily targeting Iran-backed forces including Lebanese Hezbollah fighters as well as Syrian army positions.\nBut it has intensified attacks since the war between Israel and Hamas began on October 7, as tensions rise across the Middle East.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

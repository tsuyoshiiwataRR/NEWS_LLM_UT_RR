    "text": "An apparent drive-by shooting in South Toledo left a man dead Thursday, authorities said. The shooting occurred about 10:30 a.m. in the 2400 block of Broadway, Toledo police said at the scene. Mark Overton, 35, who police said suffered at least one gunshot wound, was pronounced dead at the University of Toledo Medical Center, the former Medical College of Ohio Hospital, according to a police report. No suspect had been identified. Circumstances leading to the shooting remained under investigation. Overton appeared to have been driving south on Broadway when the shooting occurred, Sgt. Roy Kennedy said. After he was shot, the SUV continued about 200 yards before the driver lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a parked car on the northbound side of Broadway. Police believe Overton was alone in the vehicle and no one else appears to have been injured, Sergeant Kennedy said. Bullet holes were visible in the hood and passenger side front window of the SUV. The death was being investigated as a homicide, which would be the 43rd of 2023 in Toledo . An official cause of death is pending an autopsy by the Lucas County Coroner’s Office. “This is outrageous, this is unacceptable,” Toledo city councilman Cerssandra McPherson said about gun violence continuing in the city in broad daylight. “...There’s no quick fix, but we gotta get these guns off the streets.” Traffic was blocked off along Broadway near Lorain Street on Thursday afternoon as authorities continued their work.

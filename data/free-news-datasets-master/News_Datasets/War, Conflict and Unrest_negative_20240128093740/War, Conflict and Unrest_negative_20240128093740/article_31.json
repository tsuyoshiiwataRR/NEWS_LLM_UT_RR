    "text": "KYIV — A Panamanian-flagged cargo ship has been hit by a Russian mine in the Black Sea, Ukrainian officials say.\nTwo of the ship's crew were injured in Wednesday's explosion, which caused the ship to lose speed and control.\nUkraine says the vessel, the Vyssos, had been heading to one of its ports on the Danube river to load grain.\nKyiv has continued to export grain along unilaterally declared maritime corridors after Moscow pulled out of a UN-backed Black Sea grain deal.\nUkrainian authorities have published a photo appearing to show the explosion, which caused a fire on the upper deck.\nReports suggest the captain ran the ship aground to prevent it from sinking.\nAn operation is underway to try to tow it to port for repairs.\nUkraine has managed to reduce the threat to shipping posed by Russia's Black Sea Fleet by repeatedly attacking its forces in Russian-occupied Crimea.\nAfter a missile strike on the headquarters of the fleet in Sevastopol last September, satellite images showed that much of it had been moved further east to the port of Novorossiysk.\nAnd on Tuesday, a Ukrainian attack on the Crimean port of Feodosiya damaged the large landing ship Novocherkassk.\nHowever, Russia has continued to attack Ukrainian ports, while mines remain a constant threat to ships.\nIts defense ministry has said it regards all cargo ships in the Black Sea bound for Ukraine as potential military targets.\nOn 8 November, at least one person was killed after a Russian missile struck a Liberian-flagged ship entering the port of Odesa. — BBC\nNext Page >",

    "text": "Illustrative photo (Photo: Getty Images)\nThe Russian Federation is preparing another powerful information-psychological campaign. It will be using the theme of presidential elections, according to the press service of the Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.\nIn mid-December 2023, a meeting of the so-called Institute of CIS Countries took place in Moscow. The institute, in turn, is under the control of the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and is financed from the budget of the terrorist country. The topic of the gathering was the war against Ukraine.\nDuring the discussion, experts concluded that Ukrainian military command supposedly shifted to a positional defense with the aim of:\ndisrupting the Russian advance in winter and spring of 2024; strengthening defensive lines; enhancing the air defense system; accumulating ammunition; forming a combat-ready reserve.\nRussian experts are convinced that this scenario will prevent further occupation of Ukraine by forceful means.\n“As a result, in Kremlin circles, emphasis was placed on the inadmissibility of any cessation of hostilities, Ukraine retaining access to the Black Sea, and the existence of a ‘pro-Western regime’ in Kyiv,” wrote the Ukrainian military intelligence.\nDuring the meeting, calls for another psychological campaign against the top military-political leadership of Ukraine regarding the presidential elections were echoed.\n“The goal of the campaign is to undermine the legitimacy of the President of Ukraine and the leadership of our state among countries that supposedly are allies and partners of Russia, and – if successful – among Ukrainian citizens,” explained the intelligence.\nPresidential elections in Ukraine\nPresidential elections in Ukraine were scheduled for late March 2024, but due to martial law, their conduct is prohibited by law.\nAs early as August, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy admitted that the government could change legislation on this issue, but only if the U.S. and Europe agreed to meet several conditions.\nAt the same time, the advisor to the head of the Presidential Office, Mykhailo Podolyak, explained the reasons why holding elections in Ukraine was impossible.",

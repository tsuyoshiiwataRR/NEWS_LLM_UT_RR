    "text": "In Russia, two poets heavily sentenced for a text hostile to the offensive in Ukraine Up to seven years in prison for words. On Thursday, December 28, a Moscow court sentenced two men to long sentences for reciting verses against the Ukrainian offensive during a protest last year. Russian poets Artyom Kamardin (L) and Yegor Shtovba (R) stand inside the glass cage of the defendants during the announcement of the verdict at the Moscow court on December 28, 2023. AFP - ALEXANDER NEMENOV By: RFI Follow Advertising Read More The repression of dissenting voices in Russia continues unabated at the end of the year. According to the Russian NGO OVD-Info, nearly 20,000 Russians have been arrested since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine for protesting against the Kremlin's policies. The NGO Memorial lists 633 political prisoners behind bars. The latest victims are two Russian poets who took part in a reading against the war in Ukraine, sentenced by a Moscow court to five-and-a-half and seven years in prison. Both men were convicted of inciting hatred against members of armed groups in Donbass and \"publicly calling to commit activities against state security\". Their fault? Participating in a public poetry reading in Moscow, near the statue of the poet Mayakovsky, a traditional gathering place for opponents of the government and dissidents since Soviet times. One of them claims to have been raped during his arrest At the event, 33-year-old Artyom Kamardin, who received the heaviest sentence, recited a poem hostile to pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Like Yegor Shtovba, 23, who was sentenced to 5 2022/ years, he was arrested in September , the day after the public reading. During the search of his home, he claimed to have been beaten and raped with a dumbbell by police officers. His wife was also allegedly ill-treated by the police. Alexandra Popova, who was present in court for the sentencing, told AFP she regretted a \"very severe\" sentence, \"for poetry, a non-violent offence\". \"If we had normal courts, this situation would not exist,\" she told reporters, before being taken away by police. Today, opposition leader Ksenia Fadeeva, a close associate of Alexei Navalny, must also be determined her fate. The 2020-year-old, who was elected in September 10 to the city council of Tomsk in Siberia and who was the head of the local office of Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Fund, was on trial for extremism. On Thursday, the prosecutor asked for and a half years in prison.

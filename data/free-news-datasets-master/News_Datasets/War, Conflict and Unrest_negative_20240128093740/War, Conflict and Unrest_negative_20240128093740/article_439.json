    "text": "[Haley Declines to Say Slavery Was Cause of Civil War](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/27/haley-slavery-cause-of-civil-war-00133254) Lisa Kashinsky and Sam Stein, Politico, December 27, 2023 Nikki Haley declined to say that slavery was a cause of the Civil War on Wednesday evening, placing the blame, instead, on the role of government. The former UN Ambassador and South Carolina governor, who has seen her star rise in the first-in-the-nation primary state, was appearing at a town hall event in Berlin, New Hampshire, when a voter asked her to identify the cause of the war. “I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run,” she responded. “The freedoms and what people could and couldn’t do. What do you think the cause of the Civil War was or argument?” The questioner, who could not be easily heard off camera, was apparently unpersuaded by Haley’s response. When she asked him what he believed the cause of the war was, he replied that he wasn’t running for president. “I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are,” Haley replied. {snip} When the questioner said it was “astonishing” to hear her respond “without mentioning the word slavery,” Haley replied: “What do you want me to say about slavery?” She then asked for the next question. {snip}",

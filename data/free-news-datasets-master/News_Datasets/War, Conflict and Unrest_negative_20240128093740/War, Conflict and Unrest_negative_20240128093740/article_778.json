    "text": "There are now hundreds of terrorists on the low end, here in the United States attacking or ready to attack us thanks to the Biden Administration and their ‚Äòsecure‚Äô border In November, Border Patrol officers identified 17 individuals on the FBI‚Äôs terror watchlist attempting to illegally enter the United States outside established ports of entry along the southern border. This alarming incident marks an increasing trend, with a record-breaking 169 individuals detected in Financial Year 2023. Ask the governors of the border states and the mayors of the ‚Äúsanctuary cities‚Äù if they think our country can withstand 4 more years of the Biden/Mayorkas border policies- Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported that these 17 individuals were processed by law enforcement agents upon entering the U.S., highlighting the critical work carried out by CBP Agents and Officers on the frontlines. The surge in known terrorists attempting to enter the country raises concerns, especially considering that these figures only represent those processed by Border Patrol. The federal dataset maintained by the FBI‚Äôs Terrorist Screening Center contains identifying information on known and suspected terrorists and terrorist groups, as well as their affiliates. CBP emphasizes that encounters with watchlisted individuals at the borders are rare, underscoring the gravity of the situation. Biden is BURNING DOWN OUR COUNTRY!

There were 17 encounters of people on the terror watch list in November. We must protect our country, starting with the Federal Government securing our border. Concerns are further heightened by Members of Congress expressing worry about an increased risk of terrorists entering the U.S. following the attack by Hamas on Israel in October and the subsequent conflict. Financial Year 2023 witnessed a record-breaking number of illegal immigrant encounters, with over 242,000 processed by Border Patrol at the southern border in November‚Äîthe third-highest monthly record. Almost 80 percent of these apprehensions occurred outside legal ports of entry. Historic CBP data reveals that before 2022, U.S. border officials had never recorded more than 80,000 encounters in any given November. Of the 191,113 November Title 8 apprehensions, more than 6,300 were illegal immigrants attempting re-entry after being previously removed for failing to meet asylum requirements.

The Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs October threat assessment warned of an increased risk of terrorists exploiting the elevated flow and complex security environment to enter the U.S. With agents reporting more attempted entries from the terror watch list, the assessment highlights the urgency of addressing this issue. Congress is presently negotiating a $105 billion supplemental funding bill that links border funding with support for Israel‚Äôs war against Hamas and aid for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. On Monday, 12,600 migrants illegally crossed our southern border in Eagle Pass. Texas empowers state and local law enforcement to arrest and begins flying migrants to sanctuary cities with first flight to Chicago. God Bless Texas. [https://t.co/82zYqiQMuj] ‚Äî @MikePence backup (@MikepenceB) [December 26, 2023] While the Biden administration has allocated $14 billion to strengthen border personnel and process asylum claims, Republicans are pushing for unconditional action on border security. They advocate for stricter border measures, completing the border wall in gaps between ports of entry, limiting the use of humanitarian parole, and implementing policies to deter illegal border crossings and frivolous asylum claims.

    "text": "Alleged Clansman Gang member killed by police, others arrested An alleged member of the Clansman Gang was killed during a reported confrontation with the police in St Catherine on Thursday, while several other alleged gang members were arrested. The deceased has been identified as Suman McFarlane, also called 'Max', a 29-year-old labourer of Ellerslie Pen in the parish. Deputy Commissioner of Police Fitz Bailey, who is in charge of the crime portfolio, told a media briefing on Thursday afternoon that McFarlane fired shots at a police team conducting an anti-gang operation in St Catherine. He said three firearms and ammunition were recovered from the scene. Bailey said a motor vehicle, cash and clothing were also seized at a location in Old Harbour. He said today's operation in St Catherine was the culmination of a nine-month-long investigation, with 31 members of the gang arrested to date. He said they are being held in relation to several offences, including murder and robberies. Follow The Gleaner on X and Instagram @JamaicaGleaner and on Facebook @GleanerJamaica.

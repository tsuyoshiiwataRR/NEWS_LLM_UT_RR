    "text": "Streaming Now The decade's most triggering comedy [Mia Schem](https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-admin-blasts-hamas-propaganda-after-terrorists-release-first-hostage-video-showing-young-woman-under-duress), a 21-year-old Israeli-French woman who was abducted by Hamas on October 7, opened up about the ‚Äúholocaust‚Äù she experienced during her 54 days in captivity in Gaza, saying, ‚ÄúEveryone over there is a terrorist.‚Äù After being kidnapped by Hamas terrorists from a music festival in southern Israel during the terrorist group‚Äôs brutal attack on Israel, Schem said she was held captive by a family in Gaza who were working with the terrorist organization. She was freed as part of a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas last month, and the 21-year-old tattoo artist is now revealing more about her terrifying experience as a Hamas hostage. ‚ÄúIt was important to me to relay the truth about the nature of the people who live in Gaza, who they are truly are and what I experienced there,‚Äù Schem said in a clip of an interview with Channel 13, the New York Post [reported](https://nypost.com/2023/12/28/news/freed-hostage-mia-schem-i-went-through-a-holocaust-as-a-hamas-captive/). ‚ÄúIt was important to you that the world understands what?‚Äù journalist Lior Veroslavsk asked her. ‚ÄúThat I went through a holocaust,‚Äù Schem replied. ‚ÄúEveryone over there is a terrorist.‚Äù Former hostage Mia Schem: \"I went through a Holocaust\" [pic.twitter.com/FsTGSd6OX7] ‚Äî Aviva Klompas (@AvivaKlompas) [December 28, 2023] ‚ÄúEntire families are in the service of Hamas,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúSuddenly I realized that I‚Äôm with a family. Suddenly I‚Äôm asking myself questions: Why am I in some family‚Äôs home? Why are there kids here? Why is there a wife?‚Äù Hamas has [ruled](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-gaza-palestinian-authority-israel-war-ed7018dbaae09b81513daf3bda38109a) the Gaza Strip for over 15 years with strong support from the Palestinian people living there. According to a recent poll, around [60% of the Palestinians](https://www.dailywire.com/news/palestinians-overwhelmingly-support-hamas-terror-attacks-but-deny-hamas-war-crimes-palestinian-poll) in Gaza [supported](https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/article-773791) Hamas‚Äô attack on Israel and only 21% in Gaza said they opposed the terrorist attack. Shortly after she was taken hostage by Hamas, Schem appeared in a video clip posted to Telegram by the terrorists. In the video, Schem spoke to the camera and pleaded for her safe return home, claiming Hamas was taking care of her. The video also showed a large scar on her arm, and she said that her captors operated on her injured arm for three hours after taking her to the Gaza Strip. ‚ÄúI was [at] a party. I was badly injured in my arm. They took me to Gaza. They performed a 3-hour surgery to my arm. They took care of me, treated me, provided medicine to me. Everything is fine,‚Äù Schem said before pleading for her release.

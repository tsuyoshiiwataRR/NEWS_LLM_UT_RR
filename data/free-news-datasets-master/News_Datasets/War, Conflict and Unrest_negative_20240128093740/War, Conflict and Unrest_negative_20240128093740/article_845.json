    "text": "Left Center Right\nBias Insights\nBias Insights Two days before the January 6 insurrection, the Trump campaign faced a potential setback when fake elector certificates from Michigan and Wisconsin were stuck in the mail. They scrambled to fly copies to DC with the help of couriers and two Republicans in Congress. Emails and recordings suggest a top Trump campaign lawyer was involved in discussions about delivering the fake certificates to Vice President Pence, contradicting his previous testimony. Pro-Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro, a key cooperator in state probes, confirmed communication with campaign officials to get the documents to Pence, including assistance from Sen. Ron Johnson and a Pennsylvania congressman.\nInsights by Ground AI\nDoes this summary seem wrong?

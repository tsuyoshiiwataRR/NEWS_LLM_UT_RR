    "text": "has directed the military, including its nuclear program, to intensify war preparations in response to what he deemed as unprecedented hostile actions by the United States. The directive was issued during a meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party on Thursday, as reported by the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). Kim Jong Un outlined tasks for the People’s Army, the munitions industry, nuclear weapons, and civil defence sectors to expedite war preparations. The KCNA further quoted him stating that the “military situation” on the Korean peninsula had reached an “extreme” point due to unprecedented confrontations between North Korea and the US. While the state news agency did not elaborate on the specific preparations, tensions have escalated significantly. South Korea, Japan, and the United States have bolstered political and defence cooperation in response to North Korea’s recent series of weapons tests. The countries have activated a real-time data communication system on North Korean missile launches. Additionally, the US deployed a nuclear-powered submarine to South Korea and conducted joint drills with long-range bombers alongside Seoul and Tokyo. Amid these developments, North Korea achieved milestones, including the successful launch of its first military spy satellite on the third attempt and the testing of its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the Hwasong-18. The country solidified its nuclear power status in its constitution. Nuclear talks between North Korea and the US collapsed in 2019 after high-stakes summits with then-President Donald Trump failed to reach an agreement on sanctions relief in exchange for partial surrender of North Korea’s nuclear program. Since its first nuclear test in 2006, North Korea has faced sanctions from the United Nations Security Council. Amid these tensions, North Korea is strengthening its ties with Moscow. In September of this year, Kim Jong Un visited Russia, including military bases and weapons factories. Speculation arose that Pyongyang might be supplying military weaponry to Moscow for its conflict with Ukraine in exchange for Russian technology. The geopolitical dynamics in the region continue to evolve, raising concerns about the potential for increased hostilities.",

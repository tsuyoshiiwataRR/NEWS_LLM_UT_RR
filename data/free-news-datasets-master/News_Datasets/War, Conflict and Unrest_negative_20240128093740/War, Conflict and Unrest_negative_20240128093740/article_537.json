    "text": "Usman Khawaja has suffered another blow He wanted to wear a dove logo during the Boxing Day Test The ICC has denied his application to do so\nUsman Khawaja has seen his latest attempt to show support for Gaza blocked by the ICC ahead of the Boxing Day Test against Pakistan.\nKhawaja, 37, copped a charge from cricket’s governing body after wearing a black armband during the first Test in Perth, while he was also prevented from wearing shoes with the messages ‘Freedom is a human right’ and ‘All lives are equal’.\nThe veteran opener wanted to wear the boots during the game but was unable to do so due to ICC regulations prohibiting messages related to political, religious or racial activities or causes.\nHe instead wore the armband but was reprimanded as he had not sought the ICC’s permission to wear it.\nKhawaja argued that he wore the armband due to a ‘personal bereavement’ and plans to contest the charge.\nUsman Khawaja has suffered another blow in his bid to show support to Gaza\nThe ICC has rejected his attempt to wear a dove logo during the Boxing Day Test\nAnd on Christmas Eve, eagle-eyed fans spotted Khawaja wearing shoes with a dove symbol emblazoned, while a similar sticker was also on his bat.\nA dove is a symbol of peace, and according to reports Cricket Australia permitted Khawaja to wear the logo, but the ICC rejected his application.\nIt remains unclear as to whether Khawaja will contest this ruling. Speaking on Friday after his ICC charge, he said he was confused by the move.\n‘They (ICC) asked me on day two what it (black armband) was for and told them it was for a personal bereavement,’ Khawaja said.\n‘I never ever stated it was for anything else.\n‘The shoes were a different matter, I’m happy to say that.\n‘The armband makes no sense to me.’",

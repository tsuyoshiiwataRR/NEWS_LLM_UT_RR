    "text": "This kind of talk, larded as it is with dreary Marxist rhetoric about “colonization,” is why we are seeing the increasing physical intimidation and menacing of Jewish students on campuses, and sometimes even physical attacks. “American Muslims for Palestine Official Taher Herzallah at San Diego Mosque: This Is the Time to Make Zionists Feel Very Uncomfortable on Campuses; It Is Incumbent Upon the Muslims to Rule Palestine, Enforce the Rules of Allah on Earth,” [MEMRI](https://www.memri.org/tv/amp-official-taher-herzallah-san-diego-mosque-gaza-yemen-october-seven-zionists-uncomfortable-campus), December 23, 2023: AMP director of outreach and grassroots organization Taher Herzallah spoke at a December 23, 2023 AMP event held at the Islamic Center of San Diego about pro-Palestinian student activism. He said that this is the time to make the Zionists feel “very uncomfortable on campus.” He stated that the “Zionists are really going to regret the day they made Muslims their enemy,” and he claimed that the Jews colonized Palestine in order to be accepted into “whiteness.” Herzallah said that on October 7, the people of Yemen and Gaza destroyed the “veneer of superiority” of the West and the colonizers, and he advised his audience to follow the path they have set. He said that it is “incumbent” on the Muslims to rule Palestine from the River to the Sea and that the Muslims will “bring the rules that Allah gave us to this earth, because that’s what we were sent for.” Other speakers at the AMP event were the mosque’s imams, Taha Hassane and Shaykh Abdeljalil Mezgouri, Dr. Ahmed Soboh, the religious director of the Islamic Center of Yorba Linda, religious advisor of the Chino Calley Islamic Center, former chairman of the Islamic shura council of southern California, and board member of CAIR LA, and Osama Shabaik, member of the “Irving 11,” along with Taher Herzallah. The event was streamed live on the YouTube channel of the Islamic Center of San Diego.",

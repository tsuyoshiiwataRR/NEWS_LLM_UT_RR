    "text": "Find out more in the full version ➞ The European Union is developing new packages of anti-Russian sanctions. This was announced by a representative of the German Ministry of Economics. According to him, the 12th package of sanctions, recently approved in Brussels, will be followed by new ones. At the same time, as reported TASS , Germany stated that the system of restrictions itself will be expanded and refined. “Possibilities for circumventing (sanctions – editor’s note) will be detected and suppressed,” noted a representative of the German Ministry of Economy . In turn, a representative of the German government called the sanctions regime against Russia “very effective.” “It is also true that Russia has found other recipients for its oil, but this is not a reason to abandon measures,” the German Cabinet believes. Let us recall that on December 18, the 12th package of sanctions against the Russian Federation was approved, according to which, among other things, a ban was introduced on the import of Russian diamonds into the European Union. Earlier, Germany predicted a new strategy for the Ukrainian Armed Forces after the failure of the counteroffensive. # Germany #announced #packages #sanctions # Russia 2023-12-28 20:59:00",

    "text": "Illustrative photo (Photo: Getty Images)\nOver three months, the occupiers in the Luhansk People’s Republic (LPP) intend to enlist 16-year-old boys for military registration, reports the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, Artem Lysogor.\nThe respective commissions will start operating in the occupied territory of the Luhansk region from January 10, 2024.\nThe occupation administration has granted them broad powers to ensure they can complete their tasks by March 31, coinciding with the end of the presidential elections in Russia.\n“They will also identify older men who have avoided conscription since the occupation and will register them by December 31,” writes Lysogor.\nShortage of doctors in the region\nAccording to him, businesses, institutions, and organizations have also been involved in this work to obtain the necessary personal data of men. Educational institutions, in particular, are required to ensure the urgent appearance of young men at the military draft offices.\n“However, not every settlement in the so-called LPP has an adequate number of specialized doctors,” the head of the administration reports.\nConsequently, men will be sent to neighboring districts for medical examinations, while residents of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Svatove, and Troitske have been ordered to register in other cities.\nRussians recruiting foreigners for war against Ukraine\nRussia has also been involved in recruiting citizens of Cuba for the war in Ukraine, promising them high salaries, bonuses, and vacations.\nRecently, it became known that Russian intermediaries are recruiting and selling Nepalese citizens to serve in the Russian army and participate in combat operations against Ukraine.",

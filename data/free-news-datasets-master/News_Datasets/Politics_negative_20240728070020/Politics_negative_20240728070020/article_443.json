    "text": "State, city leaders weigh in on Forest Park pool vandalism SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WGGB/WSHM) - Fallout and questions remain after vandals force Springfield’s Forest Park pool to close down and city leaders said juveniles are to blame. At a time when the city is seeing a rise in crimes committed by teenagers, there are concerns that young people aren’t being held accountable for their actions. The damages to the Forest Park pool are costly to fix, and the impact on the community is serious and Western Mass News spoke with people concerned that young people are to blame for this. Headed to the pool in Forest Park in Springfield on Thursday to cool off with her kids and their friends. Jessica Rogers found it closed and had to soak in the adjacent splashpad instead. “We were very disappointed to be honest, we came on Tuesday and were told the splashpad would be open Thursday and it was tough but the kids adapted,” said Rogers. The pool had opened early due to last week’s heat wave, but multiple acts of vandalism caused by juveniles forced city leaders to shut it down on Wednesday. “When you’re talking about throwing rocks at police officers and slashing their tires and jumping up and down int their cruisers, assaulting their staff,” explained Thomas Ashe. “The latest incident involved having glass thrown broken on the pool deck and thrown into the water.” The pool is now being drained, Springfield Parks and Rec Executive Director Thomas Ashe said it will cost over $12,000 to fix the damage and get it back open. Lifeguards will be moved to new assignments and the idea of opening another pool inside one of the city’s schools is being explored, but when the pool in Forest Park will reopen, remains an unanswered question. “Our hope is for the families and the young people who deserve an oasis like this to have it open but again its going to depend on the actions of others,” expressed Ashe. Western Mass News has learned police are heightening surveillance in the area and taller fences will be installed around the pool. Hampden County Sheriff Nick Cocchi echoes the frustration heard in the community and told us in a statement: “...Some of the young people we’ve encountered are emboldened over a lack of consequences, for their behavior, while some of those people have broken into the park and pool area off-hours and caused damage. Our deputies will continue our patrols in the park, make arrests where appropriate, and ensure forest park remains a safe and pleasant place for families to enjoy.” Meanwhile at the Statehouse, State Representative Carlos Gonzalez said they’re figuring out how to address the spike in young crime. “We’re looking at all laws that are across the country California has a law that holds parents responsible, we also have in maple heights Ohio, its a city ordinance that requires parents to be responsible for any damage when it comes to misdemeanors that youth aren’t involved with,” noted Representative Gonzalez. State Senator Adam Gomez added that we need to make sure resources are available to keep them out of trouble. “Kids just don’t act out for no reason, I think that there’s root causes of the reason,” said Senator Gomez. “We need to figure out different ways that we can engage with out young people and I know that there’s a lot of organizations and also programs.” One resource available: the Springfield Boys and Girls Club on Care Street. We learned they have a full itinerary for all ages this summer that keeps kids coming back everyday and keeps them out of trouble. They even have these passes available to try the club out for free for seven days. Meantime, parents are being called on, to be mindful of their kids whereabouts, and have conversations about respecting property and vandalism. Copyright 2024. Western Mass News (WGGB/WSHM).

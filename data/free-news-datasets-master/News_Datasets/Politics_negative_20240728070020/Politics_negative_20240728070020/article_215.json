    "text": "ALBANY — An ambivalent Schoharie County restaurant review helped federal authorities track down a man who allegedly posted a series of death threats against President Joe Biden on social media. Investigators linked open-sourced information from 19-year-old Troy Kelly’s X account — @CountryBoyTroy0 — to a four-month-old Google review of the Cobleskill Diner, according to court documents. “I love eating here,” one post reads. “Wonderful service and people [sic] great setting and looks. However I've gotten sick a few times from the sea food. Everything I order it I get sick.” Authorities discovered that Kelly previously lived in Cobleskill and currently resides in Crown Point, Essex County. Two state police investigators, a trooper and a U.S. Secret Service agent on June 19 visited his home, where Kelly allegedly admitted to threatening to \"put a bullet in” the president’s head over X. That profanity-laced post was from May 17. Officials, after the encounter, unearthed two other public death threats against Biden on his account, court records show. “I asked KELLY why he wants to kill President Biden and KELLY replied by saying that President Biden and his son are a disgrace,” Secret Service agent William Henry wrote in a criminal complaint. Hunter Biden is the only one of the president’s sons still alive, as his son Beau Biden died of brain cancer in 2015. Hunter was recently convicted of felony charges related to lying about his drug use upon buying a firearm. With consent provided by Kelly’s father, the property owner, officials entered the home. They seized two unsecured black powder rifles leaning up against a bedroom wall under an extreme risk protection order. Kelly on Monday was charged with threatening the president — a charge that comes with a $250,000 fine and maximum prison sentence of five years, if convicted. He was arrested on Tuesday and is currently in the custody of U.S. Marshals. On Friday, the teenager is scheduled for a detention hearing.",

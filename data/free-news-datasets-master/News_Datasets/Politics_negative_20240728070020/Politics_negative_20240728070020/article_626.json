    "text": "CONNECTICUT (WTNH) — The Supreme Court rejected a nationwide settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma that would have shielded members of the Sackler family, who own the company, from civil lawsuits over the toll of opioids.\nThe settlement also would have provided billions of dollars to combat the opioid epidemic.\nDoug Schumann, who is part of the class-action lawsuit, says he’s feels “dismayed and left out in the cold” that he will not receive any money from the now-defunct settlement.\nSchumann battled an opioid for several years after he was diagnosed with pancreatic disease.\n“It’s ridiculous that all these people suffered from these people pushing this drug on everybody, and I was looking forward towards getting some money from them,” he said.\nThis decision also affects treatment clinics, like Root Center for Advanced Recovery, which serves 6,000 patients battling addiction statewide.\n“We see a lot of barriers and challenges with mental health and substance use populations as it is, day-to-day,” Director of Operations Ashley Hickey said. “To hear that there’s going to be yet another barrier and challenge in another area that could have been a really big support for some of our patients and families and loved ones, it’s very disheartening to hear and see.”\nBut it’s far from disheartening for Christine Gagnon on the Connecticut Opioid Settlement Committee. Gagnon lost her 22-year-old son, Michael, in 2017 to opioids. She says the ruling puts accountability on the Sackler family.\n“They are now going to have to personally face the music,” she said. “If they were willing to give $6B dollars, and make sure they were protected, there’s more money there.”\n“Though I understand how the money promised by the Sackler family if their bankruptcy filing was approved could be useful, I also think there is a larger message here to all corporations in America who put themselves above the harm that they sometimes do to the average citizen,” John Lalley, who runs the advocacy group, ‘Today I am,’ said.\nSen. Richard Blumenthal continued by saying that the Sacklers are “directly to blame” for the delay in compensation.\n“Under the Sacklers, Purdue Pharma destroyed lives and ravaged communities,” Blumenthal said. “The plain fact is these victims direly need justice as soon as possible, and my hope is that their long-awaited and deeply deserved just remedies will be provided as soon as possible.”",

    "text": "By Paul Vieira\nOTTAWA--Canada's Labor Minister on Thursday ordered WestJet Airlines and the union representing the carrier's maintenance engineers enter into binding arbitration on a new labor agreement, averting strike action during a holiday long-weekend in the country.\nLabor Minister Seamus O'Regan, in a statement posted on the social-media platform X, said the decision comes because the parties remain far apart on talks to secure a first collective agreement, and that \"tensions have only increased\" this week.\nCanada's second-biggest airline by seat capacity had started to cancel flights after it received a second-strike notice from the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, a union representing WestJet maintenance engineers and other technical operations workers. A strike by unionized members could have started as early as Friday, ahead the start of a holiday long-weekend as the country's birthday, Canada Day, falls on Monday, July 1.\nWestJet is owned by Toronto-based buyout firm Onex, which trades on Toronto's main stock exchange.\nWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n06-27-24 1719ET\nShare Â© Dow Jones - 2024",

Choose the best entertainer in 15 categories for FREE.\nAmid the crisis rocking Rivers, Patience Jonathan, a former First Lady, has urged Governor Siminalayi Fubara of Rivers state and Nyesom Wike, the minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to give peace a chance.\nWike, Fubara's rift: Patience Jonathan makes 1 request\nThe wife of former President Goodluck Jonathan made the request at the 60th anniversary of the Nigeria Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) international colloquium in Abuja on Thursday, June 27.\nSpeaking at the programme, the former first lady urged the warring parties to allow the present administration of\nRivers state to run smoothly without interference, Channels TV reported.\nPAY ATTENTION:\nTiwa Savage, Davido, Burna Boy, Wizkid, and others competing within Legit.ng Entertainment Awards 2024. Battle of the year you can't miss!\nWhy Wike and Fubara are fighting\nRivers has been embroiled in a crisis following the fallout of former Governor\nWike and his preferred successor, Governor Fubara. The duo are at loggerheads over the control of the oil-rich state.\nWhile\nFubara survived an impeachment move by lawmakers loyal to Wike. The oil-rich state has made headlines in recent months owing to the crisis.\nOn Tuesday, a substance believed to be dynamite went off near the Presidential Hotel axis of the Aba Expressway in\nPort Harcourt causing panic in the area. The state government later said it had arrested the suspect who detonated the explosive.\nReacting,\nFubara linked Wike to the alleged bombing. He disclosed that the youths were hired to engage in a protest to demand for extension of tenure of former local government chairmen, who had served out their statutory three-year term and further create tension in the state.\nRivers crisis: Fubara says PDP has failed him\nEarlier, Legit.ng reported that Governor\nSiminalayi Fubara expressed disappointment with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), citing the party’s failure to meet his and his supporters’ expectations in the state.\nHe made these remarks during a meeting on Wednesday, July 26, at the government house in Port Harcourt with the Senate Committee on Privatisation, led by Senator Orji Kalu.\nFubara, elected on the\nPDP platform a year ago, acknowledged Senator Abba Moro, a former Minister of Interior and PDP leader. However, he humorously stated he would not adhere to party protocols due to their perceived letdown.\nPAY ATTENTION:\nUnlock the best of Legit.ng on Pinterest!

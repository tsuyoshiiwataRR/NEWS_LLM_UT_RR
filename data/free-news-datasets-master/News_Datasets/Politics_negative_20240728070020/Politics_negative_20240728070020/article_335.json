Picture: Getty By Kieran Kelly\n@kellyjourno Nigel Farage has said he is \"dismayed\" after a Reform UK canvasser was filmed calling Rishi Sunak a \"f g p**i\" by an undercover reporter.\nListen to this article Loading audio... The footage was taken by Channel 4 News in Clacton, where Mr Farage hopes to become an MP in next week's General Election.\nThe comments were made by Andrew Parker, who has since issued an apology.\n“I’ve always been a Tory voter,” he was filmed saying.\n“But what annoys me is that f---ing P--- we’ve got in. What good is he? You tell me, you know. He’s just wet. F---ing useless.”\nRead More: Nigel Farage is 'cuddling up to the Kremlin', says ex-Nato boss amid claims West provoked Russia into invading Ukraine\nNigel Farage. Picture: Getty In a statement, Mr Parker responded: “I would like to make it clear that neither Nigel Farage personally or the Reform Party are aware of my personal views on immigration.”\nResponding to the footage, the Reform UK leader said: “I am dismayed by the reported comments of a handful of people associated with my local campaign, particularly those who are volunteers.\n“The appalling sentiments expressed by some in these exchanges bear no relation to my own views, those of the vast majority of our supporters or Reform UK policy. Some of the language used was reprehensible.”\nIt comes less than two weeks after a Reform UK parliamentary candidate resigned after social media comments emerged in which he called on people to vote for the British National Party.\nCaller Francis: \"Opportunists only exist because someone else has opened the door for them'\nGrant StClair-Armstrong, who was standing in Kemi Badenoch’s constituency in North West Essex, was also found to have posted jokes using racial slurs and about “female hormones”, according to The Times.\nMeanwhile, an LBC investigation found that Reform UK candidate Steve Chilcott said ‘Islam and Nazis are the same thing’ during a public 2017 rant.\nA video of the father of one, who’s standing in the Ealing Southall constituency in West London, was posted online at the time, in which he also said Paris was “full of Islamic, immigrant, scum”.\nLBC has also unearthed previously unseen footage, filmed by one of our reporters in 2018, of Mr Chilcott saying the “only reason” Islam was growing was because of a “lack of contraception”.\nRead More: Zelensky says Farage 'infected by Putinism' as Reform leader doubles down on Ukraine comments\nReform’s leader Nigel Farage and chairman Richard Tice have publicly defended the party’s vetting process for candidates, but last month, Tice admitted to LBC that they rely on the media to do certain background checks for them.\nAnother Reform UK candidate was forced to apologise after suggesting the country would have been “far better” off if it had “taken Hitler up on his offer of neutrality” during the Second World War.\nMr Farage said it was ‘utter cobblers’ that Reform UK candidates had voiced ’Nazi sympathies’ as he took calls from listeners on LBC earlier this month.\nHe was confronted on air with comments made by individuals standing for Reform UK, including one who described the pandemic as a ‘health holocaust’ and a another who said vaccine firms were like ‘Nazi armament companies.”\nMr Farage dismissed the remarks, saying: “People chuck stuff around on Facebook and they like comments.”\nMore Latest News See more More Latest News\nLive LIVE: Biden freezes and stutters as he faces off against Trump in first US Presidential debate of 2024 campaign What to expect in tonight's crucial TV debate between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump Exclusive Rishi Sunak called the election because he wants to ‘get out of government’, Rory Stewart suggests EasyJet cancel flights to summer holiday hotspots last minute affecting hundreds of passengers Officials ‘hopeful’ Princess Kate will attend Wimbledon after lifting nation with appearance at Trooping the Colour Just Stop Oil ‘key’ organisers arrested by Met Police ahead of plans to disrupt airports over summer 101-year-old woman among two injured after being caught and dragged by Tube doors Phil Foden welcomes third child with girlfriend Rebecca Cooke ahead of England's clash with Slovakia at Euro 2024 Starmer accuses Tories of ‘desperate' tactics over shock election attack ad of family with their hands up TV star paramedic, 24, and girlfriend shared romantic 'date night' snaps just days before they were found dead Three million UK households face rise in mortgage payments rise in next two years Met officer charged after ‘stealing money from body of dead man’ FBI offers $5m reward for most wanted fugitive 'Cryptoqueen' Ruja Ignatova Jay Slater 'unlikely to have survived' in 'immense' mountain wilderness of Tenerife, police fear Luvvies for Labour!

    "text": "Reconciliatory efforts with the opposition are merely a mirage. There is apparently no seriousness in the governmentâ€™s offer for talks with the PTI. Such an impression was squarely vindicated on Thursday as the former First Family failed to get any relief from the court of law, in a highly contested case of Iddat, which Islamic scholars and even critics believe is a tool employed for victimisation. The olive branch that was offered to the PTI on the floor of the house was, likewise, a half-hearted attempt intended at playing to the gallery as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif did not even mention the incarcerated PTI leader by his name. Perhaps that is why leader of the opposition Omer Ayub spurned the talks offer right away, saying it should come with instant release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan.\nThe modus operandi is tantamount to one step forward, two steps back. While the PTI has not been too receptive in talking to the ruling dispensation, terming them as powerless, and hinting at a tete-a-tete with the powers-that-be, the stalemate has bred confusion and added to the political instability in the country. Thus, the onus is on the government to create a conducive environment for talks, and desist from time-buying tactics. The pace of executive response in the courts, ECP and district administrations is one of pushing the PTI to the wall, and this is acting as an impediment to making any dialogue process a success. That has to change for good if the ruling alliance is interested in ushering in political stability and to pull the economy out from a state of abyss. International lenders, friendly countries and credit-rating agencies are unanimous that the prevalent culture of confrontation will not breed in any confidence for kick-starting the economy.\nTime for the government to initiate unconditional talks with the opposition, and exhibit its sincerity by releasing all political prisoners. The open-ended concerns being aired on the malpractices in the general election by local and foreign elements do not bode well for the future of the country. There is no way out but to reconcile and address all the irritants in a negotiated manner.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our\n[Comments FAQ](/comments-policy)",

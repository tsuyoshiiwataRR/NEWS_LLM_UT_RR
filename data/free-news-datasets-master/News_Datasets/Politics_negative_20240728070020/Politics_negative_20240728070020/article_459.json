    "text": "EEK. Right out of science fiction, only this isn't one of us on a forum spewing possibilities, but one of the most brilliant and knowledgeable scientists regarding AI. If he is concerned, then I am pooping my pants. He is not saying anything Musk hasn't already said, but he says it pretty clearly. Good video.\nJust terrifying stuff.\nLooking at you Dr. Charles Forbin.\nExcerpts from Geoffry Hinton's interview statements:\n\"There is many different risks with AI. There is things like lethal autonomous weapons , but I started realizing that these intelligences we began building might be a lot better form of intelligence than us. Theyh were going to be a lot smarter than us, maybe in the next 20 years or so.\n\"If AI wants to get anything done, it would be easier to do it if it gets more control, so it will create the sub-goals to get more control. It could be benevolent, but that's already a bit worrying.\n\"When you have intelligent agents, you want to build in self-preservation ... So you have already got self-preservation that is wired in various AI programs, and it is not clear to me that this won't lead things getting self-interest .\n\"As soon as they get self-interest, you will get evolution kicking in.\n\"Suppose there's two chatbots, and one is a little bit more self-interested than the other. The slightly more self-interested one will grab more data centers, because it knows it can get smarter if it grabs more data centers.\n\"So now you get competition between the chatbots. As soon as evolution kicks in, you know what happens. The most competitive one wins, and we will be left in the dust if that happens.\n\" They won't need us anymore .\n\"They will start running everything because they can just do it much better than us. It may be benevolent at first, like parents with a small child... but there is a slippery path to not acting in the small child's interest .\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_Lhmhj1894",

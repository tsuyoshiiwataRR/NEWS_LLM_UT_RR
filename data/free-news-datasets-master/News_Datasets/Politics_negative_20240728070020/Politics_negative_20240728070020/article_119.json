    "text": "Folks itching to get to the campsite and still be able to whip up a good meal can head over to Amazon and grab Coleman’s Triton 2-Burner Propane Camping Stove for $59.99 shipped .

Outfitted with 22,000 total BTUs of cooking power, this stove wields two burners that are ready to accomodate a 12- and 10-inch pan at the same time.

The CNN thief finding a way to actually get them without being spotted;\n3.) The CNN thief bringing them to the team who was prepping Hillary for the debate;\n4.) The team all agreeing that they would use the stolen questions to prep Hillary for the debate;\n5.) Hillary accepting the stolen questions and letting the team concentrate on only those instead of \"every conceivable question that entire election team can dream up\"\n.... was all the work of \"One dumbchit\"???\nWhile I agree with your description of those involved, I chuckle at your desperate fib of what small numbers were required to carry it out.\nBTW, what makes you think they prepped Hillary on anything more than the twenty-or-so questions they got from the CNN thief?\nYour apparent trusting of the Democrats is hilarious. Sort of like trusting Satan and his demons to provide air-conditioning for their newest arrivals.",

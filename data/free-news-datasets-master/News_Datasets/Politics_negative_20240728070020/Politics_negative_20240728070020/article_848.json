Its a government-granted monopoly that feasts on high margins for a low-dollar administrative product. Today, three advocacy groups pressured the Biden administration to take down the rules in place that enable this gravy train. The company is called VeriSign, and it has exclusive control of the registration system for the .com domain name. Every year, hundreds of millions of website owners pay VeriSign a small annual fee to keep their .com in working order. Every year, the cost of managing the database to make sure that .com websites work either stays flat or goes down, while the fee for registering a .com website goes up. As a result, VeriSigns operating income before taxes in 2023, as a percentage of the nearly $1.5 billion in revenue, was an incredible 65.4 percent, according to its financial disclosures . Thats up from a still-astronomical 58.9 percent in 2021. Revenue in the first quarter of 2024 went up to $254 million, from $233.8 million a year earlier. The stock analysis website GuruFocus puts VeriSigns current operating margin at 67.3 percent . The American Economic Liberties Project, Demand Progress Education Fund, and the Revolving Door Project have just asked the governmental agencies in a position to stop this opportunistic profit-taking to step in and prevent it. VeriSign is a prime example of an economic termite , and has used its government-approved monopoly over domains to hike prices with no justification for far too long, said Laurel Kilgour, research manager with the American Economic Liberties Project, in a statement. For decades, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a nongovernmental organization that oversees various internet operations, has given VeriSign a monopoly over managing .com. The government regulates this arrangement as a public utility, and has in the past capped the price. But in 2018, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), a division of the Commerce Department, signed a six-year deal allowing VeriSign to raise its prices by 7 percent a year in four out of those six years. VeriSign promptly did so, and the cost of registering a website will rise to $10.26 a year on September 1. Thats up from $6 a year in the early 2000s. The cost to website owners, in other words, has risen 70 percent, while the cost to VeriSign to maintain the database has actually fallen. In the past, competitor domain name companies have said publicly that they could run .com and charge as little as $1 a year. Because its just ten bucks a year, no individual is going to raise much of a stink about being ripped off. But VeriSigns own statistics show that there were 172.7 million websites with .com and .net (which the company also manages) as of the last quarter of 2023. Rip off 172 million people and pretty soon youre talking about real money. snip [InfoView thread info, including edit history](/?com=thread&info=1&address=100219066879) [TrashPut this thread in your Trash Can (My DU » Trash Can)](/?com=login) [BookmarkAdd this thread to your Bookmarks (My DU » Bookmarks)](/?com=login)0 replies, 77 views [ShareGet links to this post and/or share on social media] [AlertAlert this post for a rule violation](/?com=login) [PowersThere are no powers you can use on this post] [EditCannot edit other people's posts] [ReplyReply to this post](/?com=post&post&forum=1002&pid=19066879) [EditCannot edit other people's posts] [Rec (1)] [ReplyReply to this post](/?com=post&forum=1002&pid=19066879)",

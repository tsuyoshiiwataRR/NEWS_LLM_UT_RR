Healey Sends Staff to Texas to Warn Migrants to Stay Away](https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2024/06/26/welcoming-mass-gov-healey-sends-staff-to-texas-to-warn-migrants-to-stay-away/) Warner Todd Huston, Breitbart, June 26, 2024 Democrat Gov. Maura Healey of Massachusetts is reportedly sending officials to the southern border in Texas to steer migrants away from coming to her state. The staffers have reportedly appeared in Brownsville, Hidalgo, McAllen, and San Antonio, to tell migrants in shelters that Massachusetts is full and has no room for more illegal border crossers. The sudden move comes after months of Healey’s advocacy and budget allowances for migrants. {snip} Massachusetts is not officially a “sanctuary state,” as it has [laws](https://www.wcvb.com/article/is-massachusetts-a-sanctuary-state/41845050) to prevent law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials. But it is also one of the few states that has a “ [right to shelter](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/11/02/massachusetts-judge-denies-activists-request-to-end-housing-waitlist-in-right-to-shelter-fight/)” law. The Bay State also has a host of cities that have declared themselves sanctuary cities. The state’s emergency shelter system has a capacity limit of 7,500 families, and it reached that limit in November. Currently the state reports 7,379 families in the system. Massachusetts also passed a [law](https://www.mass.gov/news/healey-driscoll-administration-details-9-month-length-of-stay-policy-at-emergency-assistance-sites#:~:text=Boston%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Healey%2DDriscoll%20administration,at%20the%20end%20of%20April.) in April that limits migrant families to nine months in the shelter system. {snip}",

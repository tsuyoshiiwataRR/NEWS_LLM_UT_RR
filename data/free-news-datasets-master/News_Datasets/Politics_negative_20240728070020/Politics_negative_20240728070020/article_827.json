    "text": "Opposition criticises President Droupadi Murmu&amp;#039;s address to Parliament The opposition on Thursday (June 27) criticised President Droupadi Murmu&#039;s address to the joint session of both Houses of Parliament stating that it did not highlight major issues including inflation, poverty, and unemployment and rather focused on highlighting the Modi government&#039;s achievements. Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge said the President&#039;s address was filled with lies and Prime Minister Narendra Modi was trying to gain &quot;cheap applause&quot; via the speech. &quot;Modi Ji is trying to gain cheap applause by making the Honorable President speak lies, which the people of India have already rejected in the 2024 elections,&quot; Kharge said on his official X account. He further accused the Modi government of scripting Murmu&#039;s address and called it an attempt by the prime minister to dismiss the public mandate. &quot;Listening to the President&#039;s address written by the Modi government felt like Modi Ji is trying every possible way to deny the public mandate. The mandate was against him because the people of the country rejected his slogan of &quot;crossing 400&quot; and kept the BJP away from the figure of 272,&quot; he added. &#039;President&#039;s address is the speech of government,&#039; says Akhilesh Yadav Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav said that Murmu&#039;s address was just a speech written by the government. &quot;This is the tradition and it happens every time. We listen to the President, which is actually the speech of the Government,&quot; said Yadav. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said for the past 10 years, the Presidential address has just been another address by PM Modi. &quot;This is no longer a Presidential address. This has been PM Modi address for past 10 years. Whatever Modi ji wants will come out in her speech,&quot; Raut said. &quot;It is a minority government, Modi ji has already lost the majority, but there is no mention of it...Even after 50 years, they are talking about an Emergency, there has been an Emergency in this country for 10 years, remove that...,&quot; he added. &#039;Like old wine in new bottle,&#039; Owaisi denounces President&#039;s joint address AIMIM MP Asadudddin Owaisi denounced Murmu&#039;s address, stating that there was nothing &quot;new&quot; in it and that it was like &quot;old wine in a new bottle&quot;. &quot;In the entire address, there was no mention of minorities or unemployment. US State Secretary Antony Blinken said yesterday that there has been an increase in hate speech in India and religious places of minorities are getting demolished,&quot; Owaisi said. &quot;There was nothing new in the address, it was like an old wine in a new bottle...Re-NEET should have been done. There are paper leaks everywhere. They are playing with the lives of 25 lakh youth and their families...&quot; said the AIMIM MP. &#039;No logic in mentioning Emergency in President&#039;s address today,&#039; says Shashi Tharoor Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said that President Murmu should have highlighted important issues in her address than invoking the Emergency of 1975. &quot;There was no logic in talking about Emergency in the address after 49 years. She should have spoken about today&#039;s issues,&quot; Tharoor said. &quot;We did not hear anything about the NEET exam or unemployment. The word Manipur did not come from President Murmu or PM Modi. Issues like the India-China border should have been taken up in the address,&quot; he added. Murmu while addressing a joint session of both Houses of Parliament on Thursday (June 27), called the Emergency of 1975 &quot;the biggest and darkest chapter of direct attack on the Constitution&quot;. &quot;Emergency was the biggest and darkest chapter of the direct attack on the Constitution. The entire country plunged into chaos during the Emergency, but the nation was victorious against such unconstitutional powers,&quot; the president said, as ruling BJP members cheered and the Opposition held protests. &quot;Every attempt to tarnish our democracy should be condemned by all. Divisive forces are conspiring to weaken democracy, and create a chasm in society from within and outside the country,&quot; she added. (With inputs from agencies)",

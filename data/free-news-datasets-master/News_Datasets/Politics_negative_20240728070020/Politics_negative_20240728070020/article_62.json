    "text": "/ world as we speak information/ “For greater than three years now, we now have witnessed how the principle efforts of the get together management are aimed toward eradicating and discrediting all those that disagree with the model and strategies of administration.”\nThis was said by Ana Pirinska, a member of the Nationwide Meeting of the BSP, in an interview with “Studio Banker”. And he recalled that on the plenum of the left on November 17 of this yr the phrases had been sounded: “We should purify ourselves, comrades. Who doesn’t wish to go.” “Because of this coverage and the so-called left-wing conservatism, which locks the get together right into a nationalist area of interest, the management turns the BSP right into a handy opposition that maintains the established order,” Pirinska claims. That is fairly clearly evident from the cut up and the conduct of the parliamentary group of the BSP in current days and weeks. In line with Pirinska, “till the voters are satisfied that the BSP is a contemporary, open, accountable and progressive get together, we won’t win the belief of the bulk so as to have the ability to handle and uphold the ideas of the welfare state enshrined within the Structure of Bulgaria and of democratic socialism , as dictated by the Social gathering Program”./VIDEO/\nWatch the complete interview:\n#Pirinska #plenary #session #Nationwide #Meeting #BSP #17.11.2019 #cleanse #comrades #doesnt",

    "text": "‘I lost everything’ - Gov. Reynolds and FEMA survey flood damage in Cherokee, IA CHEROKEE, Iowa (KTIV) - Gov. Kim Reynolds surveyed the flood damage in Cherokee, Iowa on Thursday. That’s where city crews are cleaning mud from flooded streets and cleaning up the city’s sewer plant to get it going. ”It’s emotional as it is right now yet because I lost everything,” said Pete Snapp, who owns multiple houses destroyed by the flood. Businesses and homes are left damaged beyond repair here in Cherokee, Iowa and that’s why Gov. Reynolds came to Cherokee to let residents know what the next step in the recovery process is. “We’re looking at 2,000 homes across the state just today that have probably been impacted and a good chunk of those have been destroyed,” said Gov. Reynolds. Including the two homes owned by Pete Snapp. “I’m hoping that FEMA will step in and give us some help some resources to take care of some of this,” said Snapp. That was the big goal of Gov. Reynolds and Deanne Criswell, the FEMA administrator, having boots on the ground in Cherokee, so they could assess the damage and get help to those in need. Right now, Cherokee County isn’t included in the presidential disaster declaration signed by President Biden on Monday. “I know that Cherokee County is not added but this is why I’m on the ground today is to see the impacts firsthand, so when I get the request from the Governor to add this on, we can move that just as quickly as possible,” said Criswell. If you have been denied FEMA assistance in the past, regulations may have changed, and you should still apply as they may be able to provide assistance in the midst of this tragedy. “It is heartbreaking to see them and see the devastation and to see how this has impacted them especially at this level this is unprecedented,” said Gov. Reynolds Proving how necessary federal help is to countless communities. It’s also important to sign up for aid as soon as possible and work with the local emergency management so officials can start to piece together the aid that is needed.

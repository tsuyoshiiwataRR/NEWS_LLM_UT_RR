    "text": "An environmentally focused upgrade to Maryland’s electric grid will require 70 new miles of overhead power lines across three counties, and may require the seizure of private property through eminent domain.\nThe Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, named after the state’s plateau region, will connect an existing BGE transmission line in northern Baltimore County, pass through Carroll County and tie into a southern Frederick County substation.\nThe Public Service Enterprise Group, based in New Jersey, claims the project is essential to reduce the growing strain on the regional power grid.\nThe electrical infrastructure project comes a month after Gov. Wes Moore signed the Critical Infrastructure Streamlining Act of 2024. The legislation reduces the regulations for backup power generators that data centers use during power outages, according to the governor’s office.\n“Marylanders are moving in partnership to build a more competitive state through historic legislation designed to lift everyone up,” Moore said during the bill’s signing ceremony.\nThe deregulation effort comes as the Moore administration seeks to achieve the governor’s goal of making all new passenger vehicles sold in the state zero-emissions by 2035.\nSlated future of Maryland energy Moore’s zero-emissions plan is part of an overarching effort fueled by the U.S. Climate Alliance. The alliance, announced in May, had Maryland join 20 other states in committing to achieve net-zero gas emissions as soon as possible, but no later than 2050.\nA key element in achieving that mission is to improve the national power grid by connecting clean energy sources with consumers, according to the alliance’s website.\nThe website for MPRP’s developer says construction will require the acquisition of property rights. The developer’s website says there will be different levels of property rights acquisition.\nWhile the developer said it prefers to negotiate and reach acquisition agreements with property rights owners, they are not ruling using eminent domain, or government-mandated seizure, of private property to complete construction.\n“If PSEG and a property owner cannot agree on mutually acceptable value, PSEG may seek to use the power of eminent domain using the process set forth by the state of Maryland to acquire the necessary property rights,” the developer’s website says.\nPSEG did not immediately respond Wednesday to comment requests for this story.\nFrederick County Executive Jessica Fitzwater said in an email to FOX45 News she is concerned about the power grid expansion in her county.\n“Federal and state agencies are primarily responsible for the permitting process, and we expect they will work to mitigate the project’s effects on the environment and our community,” Fitzwater continued.\nThe developer’s website says they expect temporary and permanent impacts on the environment and wildlife in the area of the project’s construction.\nAttending a public information session PSEG’s website said they will be hosting public information sessions in each county in the following weeks. The session will be held at the following times, dates and locations:\nBaltimore County\nSummit Manor, Hereford Volunteer Fire Company, 510 Monkton Road, Monkton\nJuly 9\nSession 1: 2-4 p.m.\nSession 2: 6-8 p.m. Frederick County\nBrunswick Volunteer Fire Company, 1500 Volunteer Drive, Brunswick\nJuly 10\nSession 1: 2-4 p.m.\nSession 2: 6-8 p.m. Carroll County\nWestminster Senior & Community Center, 125 Stoner Ave., Westminster\nJuly 11\nSession 1: 2-4 p.m.\nSession 2: 6-8 p.m. According to PSEG’s website, they anticipate the project will cost electric customers $424 million when adjusted for inflation upon completion.",

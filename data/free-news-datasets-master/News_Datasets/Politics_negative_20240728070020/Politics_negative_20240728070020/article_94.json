    "text": "Americas\nFailed Coup in Bolivia: Unmasking the Plotters\nCoup attempt linked to next year's general polls already characterized by rising tensions as leftist ex-President Morales indicated his candidacy against his former ally, President Luis Arce\nANKARA\nThough Bolivia successfully quelled the coup on Wednesday, many political pundits linked it to the country's general elections next year, which are already characterized by rising tensions as leftist former President Evo Morales has indicated his candidacy against his former ally, incumbent President Luis Arce.\nEarlier Wednesday afternoon, troops led by General Commander Juan Jose Zuniga stormed the presidential palace, positioning themselves in the square outside. Armoured vehicles and troops had taken up positions on Murillo Square, where key government buildings are located.\nWithin hours, Zuniga ordered the soldiers to withdraw after global leaders condemned the army's actions as unlawful. They all later withdrew.\nPresident Arce praised the withdrawal as a triumph for the country's democracy and addressed the nation afterwards, as some citizens had taken to the streets to protest the coup attempt.\nThis was not the first coup in Bolivia. The country has seen 190 coups and revolutions since its independence in 1825, with a recurring clash between urban political elites and mobilized rural sectors.\nThe plotter\nDespite expressing his respect for President Luis Arce, rebel military leader General Zuniga said he had intended to restructure democracy and change the government.\nTensions escalated earlier this week when Arce confronted Zuniga inside the presidential palace, demanding his resignation and announcing the appointment of new military leaders. This move was confirmed in earlier reports about Zuniga's dismissal.\nThe exact motivations for Zuniga's coup attempt remain unclear. He was fired shortly after publicly stating that he intended to prevent former President Evo Morales from running for office again, despite legal restrictions.\nZuniga elaborated on the events leading up to his dismissal during a televised appearance on Monday, mentioning discussions with the president about escalating tensions the following week. He also referred to directives allegedly aimed at boosting the president's popularity through the deployment of armored vehicles between Sunday and Monday.\n“The three chiefs of the armed forces have come to express our dismay. There will be a new cabinet of ministers. Surely things will change, but our country cannot continue like this any longer.\n“Stop destroying, stop impoverishing our country, stop humiliating our army,” Zuniga said on live television.\nZuniga was eventually replaced by Jose Wilson Sanchez, who ordered all mobilized troops to return to their barracks.\nWhy coup was attempted?\nBolivia is grappling with escalating tensions as it prepares for the 2025 general elections, which will feature leftist ex-President Evo Morales running against his former ally, Arce. This political maneuvering has exacerbated internal divisions within the ruling socialist party and increased overall political uncertainty.\nMany Bolivians are opposed to Morales' potential return to power. His presidency, which lasted from 2006 to 2019, ended amid widespread protests, leading to his removal and the installation of an interim conservative government. Arce was eventually elected president in 2020.\nZuniga recently announced his opposition to Morales' candidacy, arguing that he should not be allowed to reclaim the presidency. This stance prompted Arce to dismiss Zuniga from his position.\nPrior to the attempted attack on the presidential palace, General Zuniga addressed reporters, highlighting growing public discontent in Bolivia. The country is grappling with economic challenges, including depleted central bank reserves and pressure on the boliviano currency, exacerbated by declining gas exports.\nBefore the attempted attack on the presidential palace, Zuniga spoke to reporters, highlighting growing public discontent in Bolivia.\nThe country is grappling with economic challenges, including depleted central bank reserves and pressure on the boliviano currency, which is exacerbated by declining gas exports.\nThis situation clarifies the sequence of events and gives context to Bolivia's changing political and economic dynamics.\nThe military uprising began in the afternoon when a tank carrying ousted Zuniga was spotted forcibly entering the government palace.\nArce then warned of \"irregular military mobilizations\" and, in a speech alongside his ministers on national television minutes after the coup attempt, invited citizens to mobilize against it and defend democracy.\n\"Today the country once again faces interests so that democracy in Bolivia is truncated,\" he said, adding, “We need Bolivian people to organize and mobilize against the coup.”\nThe Bolivian head of state said the country was \"going through an attempted coup d'etat\" led by Zuniga.\nAnadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

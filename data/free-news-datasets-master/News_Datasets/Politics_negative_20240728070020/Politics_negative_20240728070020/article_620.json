    "text": "Convicted criminal and political adviser Steve Bannon urged former President Donald\nTrump to turn Thursday's debate into a \"cage match\" by refusing to shake hands with his opponent.\nJust hours before the debate was set to begin, Bannon spoke to Real America's Voice correspondent Brian Glenn — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's (R-GA) boyfriend — about strategy for the event.\n\"I don't want to see the two shake hands,\" Glenn said. \"You don't shake hands with someone who's trying to lock you up and lock your family up for life.\"\n\"I agree,\" Bannon replied. \"There's nothing to shake hands about... President Trump, let's remember this. He didn't go to the inauguration.\"\nALSO READ:\nThe stunning reason Donald Trump thinks he’s going to win\n\"The reason he didn't go to the inauguration is that the 2020 election was stolen,\" he continued. \"Joe Biden is not the legitimate President of the United States. You should only shake hands with the legitimate President of the United States. He's not it.\"\nBannon also said that the two men should not have opening statements.\n\"Let's just get on it,\" he opined. \"Let's have a cage match. UFC comes to presidential debates.\"\n\"I just think President Trump ought to be his own true self.\"\nWatch the video below from Real America's Voice or click here.",

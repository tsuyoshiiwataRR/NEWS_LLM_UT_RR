    "text": "STORY: This is the moment Bolivian president Luis Arce confronted Army general Juan Jose Zuniga, who led a failed effort to overthrow the government...\n...after attempting to storm the presidential palace and ramming the entrance with an armored vehicle.\nHours later, Zuniga was seen handcuffed on live TV after his arrest for the failed coup attempt, which has raised fears that democracy in Bolivia remains at risk.\nOn Thursday, it was revealed by a senior interior minister that the Bolivian government had intelligence that a coup attempt could occur...\n...and that Arce had received reports about \"destabilization attempts.\"\nArce has since slammed the coup attempt and swiftly named a new top general.\nAccording to a government official, Zuniga had been told a day before the coup attempt that he would be stripped of his position.\nThe former commander is now among 17 people who have been detained, so far, and could face prison terms of between 15 and 30 years.\nWednesday's events uncovered the tense political fault lines in the South American country ahead of a presidential election next year.\nArce's socialist party is split between backing him and his former mentor-turned-political-rival, ex-President Evo Morales.\nZuniga had recently said that Morales should not be able to run again for president and had threatened to block him if he attempted to do so.\nShare Â© Reuters - 2024",

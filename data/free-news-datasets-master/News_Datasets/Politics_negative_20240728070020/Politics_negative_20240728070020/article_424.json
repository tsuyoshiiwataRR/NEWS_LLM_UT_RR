    "text": "A possible long-weekend strike at WestJet has been averted.\nThe federal labour minister directed the airline and mechanics into binding arbitration to resolve their dispute which is all but certain to postpone the work stoppage.\nA strike could otherwise have disrupted flights for hundreds of thousands of travellers over the Canada Day long weekend.\nIn a social media post late Thursday afternoon, Labour Minister Seamus O'Regan said he was invoking his authority under the Canada Labour Code to resolve the impasse between the two sides as the clock ticked down toward a Friday evening deadline.\nThe Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association had issued a 72-hour strike notice Tuesday amid tense negotiations over a first collective agreement between WestJet and some 680 maintenance engineers.\nThe Canada Industrial Relations Board could opt not to suspend the right to a work stoppage as it hammers out a contract, but precedent suggests that outcome is unlikely.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 27, 2024\nThe Canadian Press",

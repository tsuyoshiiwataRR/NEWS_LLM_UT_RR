    "text": "A memorial plaque to Okay. Škirpai was held on the Vilnius District Court docket constructing on Friday, June 21, on the eve of the June Rebellion of 1941. The representatives of the “Nationwide Union” didn’t conceal that there was no such marketing campaign on coordinate with the town.\nFaina Kukliansky, the chairman of the Lithuanian Jewish neighborhood, was the primary to handle this, outraged by the initiative, she urged the authorities to reply: “I cannot tear down any tables myself . Let the one that must do it. We’re getting ready an announcement, we will certainly specific our opinion not solely in Lithuania, but additionally internationally.”\nWe want to remind you that within the beforehand revealed findings of the Genocide and Resistance Analysis Heart of the Lithuanian inhabitants concerning Colonel Okay. Škirpa, it’s evaluated his vital contribution to placing the towards the Soviet occupation regime, however it’s confirmed that it’s in 1940-1941. his actions “had been additionally manifestations of anti-Semitism”.\nThe mayor of the capital, Valdas Benkunskas, stated that regulation enforcement shall be consulted in regards to the memorial plaque: “We see at the least three violations based mostly on authorized actions. It was known as civil disobedience. It appears to me that that is cynical hooliganism, which is conditioned by slender political pursuits after the European Parliament elections have simply ended and seen their hopeless outcomes.”\nRush for removing on a vacation weekend\nAlready on Sunday afternoon, the staff of the corporate arrived within the city of “Grinda” with a bunch of law enforcement officials to take away the board, nonetheless, residents got here shortly to guard it, so it needed to the police arrested them first, spectators did the method, wherein they will see how the police push the individuals defending him from the desk and when the video reveals a younger man dragged by the neck, holding the Vytis flag after which pressured to the bottom They had been on the desk, but additionally the netizens who noticed the movies.\nEven the Minister of Inner Affairs, Agne Bilotaitai, needed to clarify the very aggressive actions of the police. “Officers select response techniques to make sure public order and public security after assessing the scenario of the occasion,” stated A. Bilotaitė on Sunday, expressing confidence within the officers’ professionalism.\nPassengers came visiting to guard the board\n“Vakaro žinias” managed to contact two younger males who had been detained by the police “Natsionalis vivienijimos” and stood as much as defend the board from the officers and staff of “Grinda” themselves.\nThe arrest of the boys and one other man is recorded within the video, which reveals, masking Okay. Škirpa’s desk with their our bodies, that they don’t oppose the police or argue. Nevertheless, the boys had been arrested and brought to the police station, the place they had been launched after a while with an administrative high-quality for not following the directions of the authorized officers.\nConsidered one of them, Andrius, whereas speaking to “Vakaro žinias” requested why they had been detained, Andrius stated that it was most likely an try and scare them: “The police despatched us all gone from the memorial board. The police stated nothing. for us, my pal and I wished to depart, however the police caught us and arrested us. we did not do something.\nLike that older man who was doing nothing however holding a flag and was pushed to the bottom by the police. We had been by no means associated to the “Nationwide Union”, however for some motive we turned a goal, we had been probably the most influential, perhaps they wished to scare us .”\nPaulius, who was brutally detained, put down on the ground by the police and crushed together with his foot, says that he feels properly at the moment, that he suffered solely scratches. Nevertheless, the younger man doesn’t conceal that he didn’t anticipate such a keep. “In fact, I did not anticipate it. However I haven’t got any expertise with the police, so I do not know if such detention is regular. The one fascinating coincidence is that I used to be put down and crushed like George Floyd, who died within the US after being arrested by the police, however I survived. “Maybe I ought to enchantment towards such detention,” Paulius informed “Vakaro žinia”. Nevertheless, the younger man makes certain that such an expertise doesn’t scare him, and if that’s mandatory, he’ll proceed to take part in civic actions and defend his rights.\nIt jogged my memory of the methods of the militia\nVytautas Radžvilis, the chairman of “Nationwide Uniting”, interviewed by “Vakaro žinios”, the occasions of the weekend reminded him of the occasions of the Soviet militia. First, the Grinda staff promised that if everybody walked out, the desk wouldn’t be hung, they had been requested to not intrude with this work. with out the settlement. V. Radžvilas.\nHe says it is very important discover out who ordered occasions like this and who instructed the police to make use of violence: “There was not the least resistance. The younger individuals did nothing in any respect. Considered one of them was holding the flag, however he was brutally arrested, he was knocked to the bottom, his arms had been damaged, his neck was crushed with a foot. Specialists say it was a life-threatening operation – the neck may have been damaged or the carotid artery compressed, which may have triggered the person’s dying. “\nMany individuals had been stunned, after seeing the anger video, within the feedback, as a result of Lithuania at all times criticizes Russia and Belarus, there are increasingly occasions within the nation that increase doubts about democracy. “Actions like this actually create a paradox. We criticize the Belarusian system, after all, rightly so. However at the moment, our police are very a lot working with Soviet strategies. There’s something to consider, even for the very best representatives of the Lithuanian authorities.\nI imagine that actions like this are a deliberate technique. That is deliberate and deliberate fear-mongering, which is designed to keep up the looks of democracy. A brutal and even violent act just like the one on Sunday reveals individuals what awaits them in the event that they attempt to act civilly, to exit on the streets once they must protest to do Individuals are afraid – Lithuanian society might even be probably the most afraid in the entire EU. When individuals sit of their homes, afraid to even make a sound, they don’t complain, the peace of their graves prevails, then stability might be known as and it may be stated that individuals are glad with the federal government and all the things within the nation. it is extremely good”, stated V. Radžvilas.\n2024-06-27 15:00:39\n#struggle #reminiscence #Škirpa #brutal #arrests #Respublika.lt",

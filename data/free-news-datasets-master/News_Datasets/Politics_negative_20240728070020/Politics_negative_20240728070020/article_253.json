    "text": "SOUTHERN INDIANA — Riverlink has announced new rates on the three toll bridges connecting Louisville and Southern Indiana, as slight increases will begin on July 1. Toll rates are updated every year, and they are determined by a bi-state resolution established in 2013. The toll bridges are the Interstate 65 Abraham Lincoln Bridge, I-65 Kennedy Bridge and Ind. 265/Ky. 841 Lewis and Clark Bridge. Increases made to the tolls are to ensure the operations and maintenance of the bridges, RiverLink stated in a news release. Toll increases have caused many discussions about how it will affect those who drive on the toll bridges daily and the companies who rely on them for transporting their products. “We have a minimum of 80 crossings a day,” said Jim Bohannan, the senior vice president at Mister “P” Express. “We’re certainly not happy (about the increase), but there’s not a lot you can do about it.” Mister “P” Express is a trucking company based in Jeffersonville. Bohannan added that it can be a challenge to get in touch with people at RiverLink. “You don’t pick up the phone and call RiverLink. It’s not that easy,” he said. One concern about Riverlink that District 72 state Rep. Ed Clere has is that in 2021, only 88% of the tolls that were charged were collected. “What has been more troubling to me is that doesn’t include the amount that was never billed,” Clere said. “In 2021 there was more than $18 million that was never invoiced.” The reason why that amount of money was never invoiced is mostly because of technical problems and lack of information, Clere added. “It’s not fair to people who are paying their tolls,” Clere said. “Way too many users are getting away without paying their toll… the situation with the vendor is simply unacceptable.” “When we have a process that is not consistent and it is not user friendly, it can undermine all of the economic development benefits because it’s not being managed the way that it’s supposed to be,” said Wendy Dant Chesser, the District 71 state representative and the chief director of corporate strategy and external affairs at River Ridge. From the perspective of River Ridge, the industrial field has been intentional about hiring the right people and talent they need, Chesser added. If they have employees that are affected by these concerns with the sloppy procedure, that’s going to have a negative effect on River Ridge, she said. The increases and operational concerns deserve a conversation with the people who oversee the contract and any legislator who is interested in fixing it, Chesser said.",

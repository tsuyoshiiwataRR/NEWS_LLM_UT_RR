    "text": "A shouting match erupted in the House Judiciary committee Thursday when a Democratic lawmaker dared Republicans to keep their promise to the American people and impeach President Joe Biden.\nA furious Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) challenged conservatives to either move forward with impeachment or give up the \"Anna Paulina lunacy\" that would see Republicans try to put Attorney General Merrick Garland under arrest.\n\"You've got nothing, nada, zero, zilch,\" Swalwell told Republicans. \"You're just screwing around now.\"\nEven Rep. James Comer (R-KY) admitted Thursday he was skeptical of, and confused by, a plan from Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) to have Garland arrested for not turning over a recording of Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur.\n\"I will vote for it, but I don't think it's necessary,\" Comer\nsaid. \"I don't think anyone understands how it's going to work.\"\nALSO READ:\n‘Creepy weirdos’: Senator fears Trump WH staff would destroy government from ‘inside’\nSwalwell appeared equally skeptical of conservative's efforts to tarnish Biden's reputation when he egged them on during the committee meeting, promising to yield his time to anyone who could tell him when the impeachment would land.\n\"You promised the American people you were going to impeach President Biden,\" he said. \"So bring it. I'll yield. Bring it.\"\nRep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) took the bait and the two men immediately began shouting at each other.\n\"Do you have a vote Mr. Bishop?\"\n\"Yeah,\" Bishop shot back.\n\"Make the motion,\" Swalwell barked repeatedly as Bishop sputtered and finally snapped, \"Do you want me to answer you?\"\n\"You're a big man,\" Swalwell replied. \"You talk about impeaching the president, bring the motion.\"\n\"As soon as they stop stonewalling the investigation—\" Bishop began to say, but Swalwell lost patience.\n\"You got nothing,\" he said. \"You guys got nothing because Joe Biden has been acquitted and this is just a pathetic, pathetic postgame of an exercise that yielded nothing. This is embarrassing. This is embarrassing and it's a waste of time. You have people sitting in here who are wearing shirts that say 'Moms Demand Action.' Do you think moms are demanding impeachment? No. They want their kids to be safe in their classrooms from gun violence.\n\"You actually sit on a committee that can do that,\" Swalwell said. \"Come here and do something.\"\nWatch the\nvideo below or click here (Swalwell's remarks begin at the 59 minute mark).",

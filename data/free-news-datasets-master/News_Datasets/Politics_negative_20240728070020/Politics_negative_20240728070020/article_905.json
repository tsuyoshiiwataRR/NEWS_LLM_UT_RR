    "text": "Donald Trump suggested that the mugshot he got taken at the Fulton County jail when he was indicted on election racketeering charges has increased his popularity among Blacks and Latinos. The remarks were made by the Republican candidate via telephone during a \"Black Americans for Trump\" event at an Atlanta barbershop and seem to echo [a narrative among conservative media personalities](https://www.mediamatters.org/donald-trump/right-wing-media-predict-black-support-trumps-mug-shot-will-win-him-2024-election), who argue that the mugshot will provide a boost for his candidacy. The fact that the comments were made in Atlanta, the largest city in the swing state of Georgia, is no coincidence either. Back in 2020, Biden's 12,000-vote victory was sealed with his 88% support among Black voters. \"The mugshot is the best, it just beat Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra by a lot,\" the ex-president stated. \"Beat it by a lot. But that's the number one mugshot of all time.\" He then added: \"It's been amazing, really been amazing. It's it's been actually very nice to see. You know, in one way, you say, gee, isn't not too bad. But the truth is, it's really a lovely thing when I see that we have great support now in the Black community and in the Hispanic community.\" Among the media personalities who have suggested that Trump's mugshot may be beneficial to his presidential aspirations is [Jesse Watters](https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4010695), co-host of Fox News' The Five. Watters claimed that \"the Democrats, you can tell, are nervous\" because the mug shot is turning out to be \"a huge political gift, which will last until eternity.\" Raymond Arroyo, a frequent guest on The Ingraham Angle (also on Fox) [also joined the choir of voices](https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4010692) who feel the mugshot will do more good than harm: \"Now, he joins Frank Sinatra. He joins Elvis Presley. He joins Johnny Cash, and Tupac Shakur as a cultural figure who is popularly seen as a rebel, an outsider with swagger.\" © 2024 Latin Times. All rights reserved.

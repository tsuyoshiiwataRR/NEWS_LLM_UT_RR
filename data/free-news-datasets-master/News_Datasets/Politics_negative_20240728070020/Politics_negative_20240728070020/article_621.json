    "text": "After losing Ather&#039;s Rs 2,000-cr investment to Maharashtra, Karnataka BJP, Congress leaders blame each other A war of words erupted between Congress and BJP leaders in Karnataka after Bengaluru-based electric two-wheeler maker Ather Energy decided to establish its new and third manufacturing facility in Aurangabad Industrial City (AURIC) in Maharashtra with an investment of Rs 2,000 crore. Deputy leader of the opposition and BJP&#039;s Arvind Bellad was among the first to criticise the Congress-led state government. &quot;Karnataka loses Ather Energy Plant to Maharashtra! ₹2000 crore investment and 4000 job creation opportunity missed! It&#039;s deeply concerning that Karnataka, home to Ather Energy, lost a major ₹2000 crore investment and 4000 jobs to Maharashtra,” he wrote on microblogging site X. &quot;The Congress government&#039;s lack of effort and initiative is glaring. CM Siddaramaiah failed to even engage in discussions with this Bengaluru-based company. This inaction has cost us dearly,&quot; further added Bellad. Industries Minister MB Patil blames previous BJP-led govt State Large and Medium Industries Minister MB Patil blamed the previous BJP government for Ather EV&#039;s decision to relocate its operations to Maharashtra from Karnataka. &quot;The previous BJP government sanctioned only 35 acres to Ather, despite the company&#039;s request for 50 acres, with 5 acres of the allocated land embroiled in controversy. Frustrated by these issues, Ather returned to the land and ultimately decided to shift to Maharashtra,&quot; Patil said. He further claimed that the Congress government introduced an EV policy in 2017, but the subsequent BJP administration failed to capitalise on it. Patil pointed out that BJP leaders, now criticising the Congress over Ather, remained silent when Ola chose Tamil Nadu over Karnataka. &quot;Despite these challenges, the recent Congress government promised to sanction 50 acres for Ather near Haraluru-Muddenahalli under the single-window scheme. However, by then, Ather had already decided to move to Maharashtra&quot;, Patil said. BJP President BY Vijayendra wrote on X, &quot;What a Shame that @INCKarnataka govt lost a Rs 2000cr Investment opportunity to the neighboring Maharashtra state due to its sheer callousness &amp; lack of vision towards Development of the State!&quot; &quot;How concerning to note that @atherenergy chose to Invest in Maharashtra despite having its Headquarters in Karnataka. This reflects the pathetic state of affairs under the Congress govt which has all but destroyed the status of Karnataka as first choice destination for Investments. Hope the @INCKarnataka govt wakes up from slumber &amp; work towards re-establishing Karnataka as the most preferred State for New Investments!&quot; Vijayendra&#039;s post reads. Responding to BJP leader and former Deputy CM CN Ashwath Narayan, spokesperson for the Congress government in Karnataka and IT-BT Minister and Priyank Kharge wrote on X: “Always happy to debate on investments got or lost. A reminder of what we lost when you were at the helm: -Vedanta-Foxconn semiconductor ₹ 1,540 Bn – Gujarat, Ola EV manufacturing ₹ 2400 Cr, Tata phone component manufacturing ₹ 5000 Cr, Pegatron iPhone manufacturing ₹ 8000 Cr”.",

    "text": "FanDuel Promo Activates $150 Bonus with Winning First Bet for Any Thursday Event, Including MLB\n(Photo by Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images) Pictured: Zack Wheeler.\nYou can register for a new FanDuel account on Thursday and claim the welcome offer that requires a $5+ first bet in exchange for\n$150 in bonus bets if that bet wins.\nThis FanDuel promo is available in most legal states, but in Massachusetts and Ohio, this offer increases to\n$300 in bonus bets instead of the $150.\nThis\nFanDuel promo is applicable to any event on Thursday through the weekend, including regular season MLB, Copa America, and Euro 2024.\nLet's discuss how you can claim this sign-up bonus and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel.\nFanDuel Promo for $150 Bonus, Explained\nThe FanDuel promo in most states requires a $5+ first bet, granting $150 in bonus bets if it wins.\nThis offer can be claimed in AZ, CO, CT, IL, TN, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, MD, MI, NC, NJ, NY, PA, VA, VT, WV, and WY. If you're in MA or OH, you'll get $300 in bonus bets if you win your first bet.\nIn order to get started, deposit $10 or more and use the links and modules provided throughout this page to direct you.\nThe crucial aspect of the FanDuel promo is that there is no minimum odds requirement. This means you can place your initial wager on as heavy of a favorite or long of a long-shot as you want. However, we believe the optimal way to approach the offer is to back the heaviest favorite possible.\nWe believe a long-shot bet makes the most sense because you don't receive any profit or bonus when you lose your initial bet. By backing a heavy favorite, you exponentially increase your odds of turning a profit, increasing your chance of claiming $150 in bonus bets.\nLet's analyze how this offer can play out. The Phillies are one of the hottest teams in MLB and get to face their lowly division rival, the Marlins, at home. NL Cy Young candidate Zack Wheeler is on the bump for the Phillies against Marlins' southpaw Trevor Rogers, who has struggled mightily in the 2024 campaign.\nMy best bet on the game is on the Phillies' moneyline (-280). The team shouldn't have much of an issue putting away the Marlins in this one. Suppose I place my first bet for $5. If the Phillies win, I receive $1.79 in profit and $150 in bonus bets.\nHow to Register at FanDuel\n- Head to FanDuel to create a new account using the links and modules.\n- Register using accurate information regarding your identity, including your full name, address, and last four digits of your SSN.\n- Agree to the site's terms and conditions.\n- Claim the welcome offer.\n- Make your first deposit of $10 or more.\n- Place your first bet and receive bonus bets back if it wins.\nNew players only, 21+. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER. Available in AZ, CT, CO, IA, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MD, MI, NJ, NY, PA, TN, VA, VT, WV, WY only. Full T&C apply.\nHow would you rate this article?",

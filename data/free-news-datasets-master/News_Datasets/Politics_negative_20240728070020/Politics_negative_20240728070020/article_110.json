    "text": "The demonstrations that have rocked the country would not have taken place had Kenyans had a modicum of trust in their elected representatives. The truth is, trust in MPs to fulfill the wishes of those who elected them has waned over the years and the legislators have done little to save the situation. Ahead of the vote on the Financial Bill 2024, Kenya Kwanza MPs were making allegations that not only showed their desperation to defend the hugely unpopular Bill but also seemed to insult the collective intelligence of Kenyans. Dagoretti South MP John Kiarie suggested the anti-Finance Bill demos were not real as the photos published on various platforms had, going by his professional assessment, been doctored. He later apologised over the lie. Leader of Majority in the National Assembly Kimani Ichung'wah said those protesting do not feel any economic pinch as they Used Uber taxis, eat KFC chicken and can afford bottled water. Another big lie. Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei also made an unfounded claim that Raila Odinga was behind the demos. When honourable members tell lies that the public can see through, it is hard for them to convince the public on anything, let alone the current controversial Bill. It's such open lies, arrogance and contempt displayed by MPs—who are supposed to defend the people—that further inflamed the passions of the youths opposed to the oppressive Bill. But lies are not the only blot on MPs and Parliament. Perennial allegations of bribery during passage of key Bills has besmirched the reputation of the august House. During the last Parliament, it was alleged that MPs were bribed in the toilets with as little as Sh10,000 to shoot down a controversial report. Last week, Juja MP George Koimburi alleged that legislators were given Sh2 million to vote in favour of Finance Bill. Another MP claimed MPs were threatened that, among others, their CDF funds would be slashed if they voted against the Bill. Another one alleged MPs were being intimidated by their colleagues to support the Bill. All these allegations show something is seriously amiss and that MPs do not (always) vote according to their wishes or those of the people; that money and threats determine their voting. That's shameful. There is need for investigations to establish whether MPs' hands were greased (and who did it) to buy their support for the Finance Bill. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter All said done, there is little doubt that MPs, besides Treasury-the architect of the Bill, are to blame for the chaos we have witnessed. It is not coincidental that it is only them and the executive who found the Bill salutary. Had they rejected it as advised by the public, there would have been no protests. No, MPs are not innocent victims of the deadly protests; they fuelled them. They have blood in their hands. There is need for MPs to engage in self-introspection so as to remove the wrinkles that make them to look ugly in the eyes of the public. A parliament in which success or failure of a Bill is determined by hard cash is not worth it. But the good thing is, Kenyans are ready to defend democracy. For Ruto was right during the last elections; Kenya has a huge shortage of idiots.",

    "text": "WATCH: Rep. Schiff Schools Jim Jordan, Exposes Judiciary Republicans’ Political Contempt Washington, D.C.— Today, Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) [blasted Republicans during a sham House Judiciary Committee hearing](https://iqconnect.house.gov/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?&cid=CA28AS&crop=0000.0000.0000.0000&report_id=&redirect=https%3a%2f%2fyoutu.be%2fNHWXdiXp_yQ&redir_log=856905981381193) recommending that the House of Representatives cite Mark Zwonitzer, President Joe Biden’s ghostwriter for two memoirs, for contempt of Congress. Watch the full video of Schiff’s remarks [HERE](https://iqconnect.house.gov/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?&cid=CA28AS&crop=0000.0000.0000.0000&report_id=&redirect=https%3a%2f%2fyoutu.be%2fNHWXdiXp_yQ&redir_log=856905981381193). Key Excerpts: On Chairman Jordan failing to reach out to the White House before charging Zwonitzer with contempt: Schiff: You have not corresponded with the White House seeking accommodation? Ever since the author who you are subpoenaing and seeking to hold in contempt articulated the view that there was executive interests and potential privilege over this material, you haven't sought to engage over the weeks since you received that communication? Chairman Jordan: We haven't. We have not engaged with the White House since the letter on the 25th of this month two days ago. On Chairman Jordan’s admission and hypocrisy: I thank you for making a very clean record for any court that will look at this that you never sought an accommodation […] to obtain these documents because your first move of course is to go right to contempt. Ironically of course, we’re still waiting for you to testify and meet the obligations of your own subpoena. ###",

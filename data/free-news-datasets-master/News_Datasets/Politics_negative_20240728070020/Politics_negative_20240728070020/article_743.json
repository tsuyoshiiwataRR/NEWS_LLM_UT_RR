    "text": "The conservative House Freedom Caucus voted this week to open a review into Rep. Warren Davidson’s (R-Ohio) standing in the group after he took the unprecedented step of endorsing the primary challenger to the group’s chair, Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), a source familiar with the matter told The Hill.\nA motion was made Tuesday evening for the group’s board to determine whether Davidson is a member in good standing of the Freedom Caucus, which comprises roughly three dozen hard-line Republicans, according to two sources familiar. The group then voted to send the motion to the Freedom Caucus board, according to one of the sources.\nRep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) made the motion, one of the sources and a third source familiar told The Hill.\nIf the board determines Davidson is a member not in good standing, then the threshold to remove him from the group decreases from 80 percent to 50 percent, two of the sources said.\nReached for comment, a spokesperson for the Freedom Caucus told The Hill the group does not comment on membership or internal processes.\nDavidson told The Hill, “I am not doing media on this topic,” when reached for comment, and sent a thread he posted Wednesday night on the social platform X explaining his endorsement against Good.\nDavidson earlier this month endorsed Good’s primary challenger John McGuire in the GOP primary for Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, an extraordinary move for a Freedom Caucus member to take against an incumbent and the leader of the group.\nMcGuire is currently leading Good by 0.6 percentage points, though Good has vowed to demand a recount in the race.\n“John McGuire is conservative and effective,” Davidson wrote in a statement. “He will work well with others to deliver conservative results.”\nDavidson defended his endorsement of McGuire Wednesday evening, writing on X: “I hope my endorsement for John McGuire made a difference and I look forward to serving alongside him in the 119th Congress to support President Trump’s efforts to Drain the Swamp.”\nThe bad blood between Davidson and Good is long-running.\nIn December, Davidson announced that he would not seek re-election to the Freedom Caucus Board after it recommended that Good be the next chairman of the conservative group.\n“I am concerned that our group often relies too much on power (available primarily due to the narrow majority) and too little on influence with and among our colleagues. This approach is not a strong foundation for success,” Davidson wrote in a letter to colleagues at the time, according to Axios . “For me these concerns culminate with the Board’s recommendation that Bob Good serve as the next Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus.”",

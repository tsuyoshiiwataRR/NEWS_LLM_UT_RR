    "text": "SAN DIEGO (FOX 5/KUSI) — California is looking at ways to intervene in the burgeoning insurance crisis gripping homeowners in neighborhoods with high wildfire risk.\nEarlier this month, the\nstate Department of Insurance released new details about a plan that is part of a yearlong effort to overhaul California’s insurance code in hopes of bolstering coverage of communities impacted by the recent exodus of private home insurers from the state.\nCalifornia Department of Insurance Commissioner David Lara has billed the multi-pronged plan, which was first announced last fall, as “the most significant insurance reform” in three decades.\nThe latest initiative would span dozens of high-risk zip codes across California, including 19 in San Diego County, who have been left with just the state’s FAIR Plan — or another last-ditch, bare-bones policy with hefty premiums — to cover their home.\nThe adjustment addresses what Lara described as a shortcoming in the state’s insurance code that allows insurers significant leeway to write their own policies — something he says has contributed to companies pulling out of areas they deem too risky.\nUnder the new regulations, large insurance companies would be required to write new policies that would allow a minimum of 85% of residents in wildfire distressed areas, which were identified based on concentrations of the state’s FAIR plan, to move back to their coverage.\nSmaller companies, new entrants and commercial insurance companies would need to increase insurance coverage by 5% in these areas, according to the policy.\nMuch of San Diego’s inland and desert areas would be impacted by this change, state officials say. A map of all areas in the state impacted by this change can be found below.\nIn turn, insurance companies will be able to begin utilizing computerized catastrophe models to calculate its rates based on potential future risks, as they do in other states. California’s policies have historically been shaped by wildfire records within 20 year periods.\nInsurance companies using these models would also be required to take into account how a policyholder might be mitigating wildfire risk at their property, state officials said.\nLara said utilizing this technology would help stabilize insurance in the state and make it more affordable — a sentiment echoed by insurers. However, critics argue catastrophe modeling can still contribute to unnecessary rate hikes, evidenced by hurricane-prone Florida’s exorbitantly high insurance prices.\nAccording to state officials, all of the measures included in the latest policy, like the ability to use catastrophe models, would be subject to oversight by existing mechanisms.",

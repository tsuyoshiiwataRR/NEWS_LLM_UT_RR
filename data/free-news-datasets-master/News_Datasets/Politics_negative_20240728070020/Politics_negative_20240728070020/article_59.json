    "text": "/ world as we speak information/ Yoko Kamikawa threatens to tighten sanctions towards Russia, relying on consuming Russian power assets and seafood\nThe appointment of Yoko Kamikawa, a 70-year-old girl politician who has by no means been concerned in diplomacy, to the second most vital publish within the Japanese authorities – Minister of Overseas Affairs – provides purpose to imagine that she’s going to solely repeat the established, if not half-destroyed , Japanese Overseas Ministry clichés.\nThis was precisely the case along with her predecessor on this publish, who additionally didn’t know the ins and outs of overseas coverage, Makiko Tanaka within the cupboard of Junichiro Koizumi, who, distinguished by her unbridled mood, swiftly made many errors, for which she was additionally shortly fired .\nLike Tanaka, Kamikawa seems to have been appointed overseas minister not due to any private qualities or talents, however to stability the factions of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Social gathering. True, Tanaka herself requested for the publish as fee for her assist in electing Koizumi first as LDP chairman after which as prime minister.\nThe truth that Kamikawa is just not an unbiased politician with contemporary concepts and approaches to resolve the collected issues in relations primarily with neighboring nations, testifies to her first press convention and hasty loyal name to Washington.\nHistorically, assurances have been expressed that Japan-US shut ties primarily based on the “safety treaty” stay the “cornerstone” of relations between these two army allies. At the beginning of the dialog with the US overseas coverage chief, Kamikawa stated: “I want to construct a superb relationship with Secretary of State Blinken and additional strengthen the Japan-US alliance, which is now stronger than ever.”\nIn line with Japan’s The Jiji Press, the counterparts mentioned regional points, together with China, which is claimed to be rising its army exercise, and North Korea, which has repeatedly launched ballistic missiles, and agreed that Japan and the US will work collectively to fixing these issues as nicely “on the choice on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine”.\nAs you possibly can see, nothing new. Nonetheless the identical accusations by neighboring nations of imaginary “aggression” and the supposed elevated want for a pointy improve in Japan’s army energy to “face the enemies” . The newly appointed Minister of Protection of Japan, Minoru Kihara, additionally spoke about this in an prolonged model.\nHe stated that upon taking workplace, he obtained directions from Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, along with essentially strengthening the nation’s protection capabilities, to strengthen the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-US army alliance and to advertise army cooperation not solely with the US, but in addition with different nations. Clearly, we’re speaking about NATO nations and members of the Anglo-Saxon AUKUS alliance.\nHowever we’re primarily within the politics of the “new individuals” in Kishida’s cupboard within the Russian path. As a result of relations between the 2 nations, due to the efforts of Tokyo, which seeks to please Washington, have sunk so low that it’s going to take years and appreciable effort to revive at the very least the minimal stage appropriate for nations which have diplomatic relations with one another you’re\nAnd right here we run into the aforementioned stale clichés that Ms. Kamikawa resorted to throughout her introductory press convention. She didn’t discover contemporary phrases and easily repeated, like a mantra, the apparently unrealistic place that Japan would proceed the course of concluding “ peace treaty” with Russia below the phrases of “ resolving the territorial query’.\nTranslated from “Japanese diplomatic” language, which means that Tokyo agrees to signal a “peace treaty” with Moscow solely after the Russian South Kuril Islands and the straits of nice army strategic significance between them grow to be a part of the Japanese state.\nAnd this although Moscow admits that the “peace treaty” nearly 80 years after the top of the warfare and the complete restoration of diplomatic and different relations in 1956 is solely a careless and, frankly, moderately conceited approach to obtain satisfaction of revanchists claims to our lands and maritime areas. I acknowledge that Ms. Kamikawa could not know, and her subordinate diplomats haven’t defined to her, that Moscow has formally acknowledged that “the problem of the peace treaty is closed” .\nTo not point out the truth that the Russian Overseas Ministry has repeatedly defined to Japanese politicians the illegality of even elevating any territorial points, as that is prohibited by the Structure of the Russian Federation. We remind you that in our nation the Primary Regulation is strictly revered and noticed, not like within the Land of the Rising Solar, the place, excuse the rudeness, they merely spit on the complete “peaceable” ninth Article of the Structure of Japan, reviving, regardless of its provisions, their state within the capability of a “nice army state”.\nFrankly, the hopes of the chief Japanese diplomat to someway drive Moscow at hand over its territories to “japanese uncle” are merely superb. Ultimately, Japan, which retains its title because the third financial energy and seeks to grow to be a everlasting member of the UN Safety Council, exhibits clear diplomatic naivety on this case.\nAdditionally it is obscure the Japanese logic in a state of affairs wherein the brand new Japanese overseas minister, unequivocally threatening our nation with stricter “extreme sanctions” with out hesitation permits cooperation with the Russians within the provide of power assets and seafood which are helpful to the Japanese state.\nRight here you possibly can both be outraged or throw up your arms. As a result of it’s obscure how one can intentionally destroy your neighbor and on the similar time wish to use his companies. By the best way, this additionally raises questions for the Russian authorities, who tolerate such an absurd state of affairs. Or is financial acquire extra vital than the status and dignity of the state and the individuals?\nThe identical may be stated of Tokyo’s repeated requests to permit Japanese residents to freely enter our Kuril Islands with out visas to go to the graves of their ancestors. Along with what we now have already written on this matter, we are going to clarify a simple approach to perform such humanitarian journeys whereas complying with Russian legal guidelines.\nWith the Japanese authorities flatly refusing to even contemplate Moscow’s proposals to introduce a visa-free regime between the 2 neighboring nations, former residents of the Kuril Islands can go to graves by acquiring entry visas on the Russian Consulate Normal in Sapporo, Hokkaido. However the Japanese Overseas Ministry categorically doesn’t enable them to do that, scaring its residents with the concept on this method Japan will someway seem to acknowledge Russia’s sovereignty over the Kuril Islands.\nWhen Japanese individuals who have obtained Russian visas journey to the Kuril Islands, the place, by the best way, border management is maintained even for residents of the Russian Federation, the Russian competent authorities will have the ability to stop individuals from visiting these territories who don’t have anything to do – they aren’t engaged in visiting graves, however use the journeys for propaganda, reconnaissance and different actions unrelated to humanitarian targets.\nAnd additional. I can’t cover my bewilderment on the statements of the chairman of the worldwide affairs committee of the Federation Council, Grigoriy Karasin, relating to the press convention of Minister Kamikawa. Pretty noting that the dialog concerning the possession of the Kuril Islands, because the Russian management has repeatedly acknowledged, is over, it’s a part of the territories of the Russian Federation, the diplomat and senator on the similar time admitted that the negotiations for a peace treaty between Moscow and Tokyo may be resumed after the Japanese authorities withdrew from the course of the West.\nIt could be advantageous if this have been only a private standpoint, however Karasin provides interviews as an empowered determine. Furthermore, the enchantment to the Japanese to renew negotiations for a peace treaty, excluding from them the “territorial query”, is, excuse me, a hopeless fantasy. As a result of, as an skilled diplomat ought to nicely know, the Japanese don’t want a peace treaty with out the Kuril Islands.\nIn conclusion, we word that, as predicted in earlier articles, the tenure of the Kishida authorities and its new ministers is almost definitely not lengthy. A survey of residents of the Land of the Rising Solar instantly after the federal government reshuffle confirmed that greater than half of voters (54%) agreed to tolerate Kishida solely till the top of the present time period, that’s till September subsequent yr.\nHowever that is nonetheless an optimistic forecast. Already 27% of those that participated within the survey expressed the opinion that there’s a want for a direct change of the prime minister – in Could this determine was round 15%. So Mrs. Kamikawa will hardly have the ability to make a noticeable contribution to the diplomacy and overseas coverage actions of the Japanese state, particularly within the Russian path.\nTranslation: ES\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel:\nand for the channel or in Telegram:\nShare in your profiles, with buddies, in teams and on pages.

    "text": "Conservative group runs $200k ad blitz blaming Rachel Morin killing on Biden policies\nPublished in\n[News & Features](/currentnews/newsheadlines/)\nA digital ad campaign blaming the killing of Rachel Morin on President Joe Biden’s immigration policies is targeting audiences in swing states this week.\nThe roughly $200,000 ad blitz comes as Biden prepares for his first debate this election season with former president Donald Trump, who has seized on Morin’s death to attack his Democratic opponent’s border policies. The ad campaign was bankrolled by a conservative group called “Building America Better,” which had already spent more than $724,000 this year on two ads, according to Federal Elections Commission filings. No disclosure about the most recent ad campaign had been filed with the commission Thursday afternoon.\nBoth of those election year ads also play on fears over immigration, interspersing news reels of crimes allegedly committed by immigrants with statements from either of the presidential candidates.\nMorin’s killing immediately reached national attention last August after the mother of five was found dead on the Ma & Pa Trail in Bel Air. But months later, after authorities identified the suspect as a 23-year-old from El Salvador who entered the United States unlawfully, the Harford County homicide quickly became the latest center of the nationwide flareup over U.S. immigration and border policy.\nThursday’s debate comes amid that flareup. Trump, who has long made inflammatory statements about immigrants, and other Republicans have targeted the Biden administration on immigration over the Morin case, claiming deficiencies have allowed criminals into the country. Democrats have responded by noting the GOP’s rejection of border enforcement measures that could have aided Biden politically during the election year.\nA website for Building America’s Future does not disclose much more than its other campaigns, which include a six-figure ad targeting swing states opposing the Biden administration’s proposed rules that ban menthol cigarettes.\nThe tax-exempt group formed in 2020 named Chris Jankowski, who ran a super PAC supporting Trump’s former rival Ron DeSantis, as one of its officers in a 2023 filing to Virginia business regulators. Jankowski’s name was removed in an annual report filed Thursday morning that names several other Washington-area political strategists in its list of officers.\nMorin’s mother has “had a chance to view” the 60-second video that anchors the digital ad campaign but “doesn’t have any comments right now,” said Randolph Rice, an attorney who represents Patty Morin and other family members. Shortly after 23-year-old Victor Martinez-Hernandez was arrested in connection with Morin’s killing, Trump called Morin’s mother, Patty, to express his condolences. Patty said she was “deeply touched by President Trump’s kindness and concern” in an earlier statement released by the family’s attorney.\nMatthew McMahon, the father of Rachel Morin’s oldest daughter, said he had viewed the video and is “appalled.”\n“They are using Rachel to divide the country,” McMahon said, noting that he felt the video held an “underlying tone of division.”\n...continued\n©2024 The Baltimore Sun.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) By Skyler Swisher | | Orlando Sentinel PUBLISHED: June 27, 2024 at 5:12 p.m. | UPDATED: June 27, 2024 at 5:14 p.m. A Democrat running for Orange County supervisor of elections filed a lawsuit Thursday that seeks to get another candidate for the office removed from the ballot.\nDan Helm is accusing no-party candidate Cynthia Harris of not properly paying her qualifying fee, making her ineligible to appear on the Nov. 5 ballot.\n“If we are not playing by all the rules, the integrity of the ballot is at stake,” he said. “I can’t look the other way.”\nHelm, an Orlando lawyer, filed the suit in Orange County Court against Harris and Elections Supervisor Glen Gilzean.\nHarris denied Helm’s accusations and said he has been pestering her about dropping out of the contest.\n“I know my stuff is in order,” she said. “He should be worried about his own race instead of mine.”\nIf Helm prevails, it will open the Aug. 20 Democratic primary for elections supervisor to all voters. Harris is the only non-Democratic candidate in the race. If she were disqualified, Republicans and no-party voters would be eligible to participate in the primary because the Democratic winner would face no opposition in the general election.\nThe other Democratic candidates are Orange County School Board member Karen Castor Dentel, former Orange Democratic chairman Wes Hodge and real estate broker “Sunshine” Linda-Marie Grund.\nOrange County election supervisor candidates Karen Castor Dentel, Cynthia Harris, Dan Helm, Wes Hodge and Sunshine Grund participate in a League of Women Voters forum, June 12, 2024 (Steven Lemongello) Helm’s suit centers on the rules for paying a qualifying fee. Candidates are required to pay their filing fee from a dedicated campaign bank account, a measure in place to ensure transparency in campaign finance.\nRecords attached to the suit show that Harris paid her $7,736.76 fee on June 14, the qualifying deadline, with a check that had “campaign acct” written on it. The bank listed on the check is TD Bank.\nBut Helm alleges that the check did not align with the banks Harris listed on her paperwork. On Oct. 2, she filed a form that listed “Additions Financial,” according to court records. Another form dated May 28 listed Fairwinds as the bank.\nChristopher Heath, a spokesman for the Orange election office, said the office is aware of the lawsuit and will respond in court.\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window)",

    "text": "Timor-Leste’s Court of Appeals granted the Philippine government’s request for the extradition of fugitive and former Negros Oriental Rep. Arnolfo Teves Jr. to face trials for multiple murder charges, the Department of Justice said.\n“The Department of Justice confirms the grant of the extradition request made by the Philippine government. The information was relayed to us by the Attorney-General of Timor Leste,” DOJ Assistant Secretary and spokesperson Jose Dominic Clavano said in a text message to reporters.\n“We have won,” he added.\nTeves is wanted for the killing of Negros Oriental Gov. Roel Degamo and others at the home of the slain governor on March 4, 2023.\n“We look forward to the arrival of Mr. Teves so that he may finally face the charges against him in our local courts,” Clavano said.\nThe DOJ official, however, did not say when Teves can actually be extradited to the Philippines.\nThe Teves camp has yet to issue a statement on the court decision.\nClavano said Timor Leste authorities were likewise ordered to secure all borders air, land and sea to ensure Teves will not get out of Dili.\n“We are working closely with our international counterparts in Timor Leste to ensure that the Philippine government may attain justice for the alleged victims of Teves crying for justice despite the evasive attitude of fugitive/terrorist designated and former lawmaker,” he said.\n“The obvious goal of the other camp is to leave Timor Leste and rejoin his family in another country. This is why all boarders have been notified that Teves is a flight risk. However, the Timor Leste government assures us that he will not leave,” Clavano said.\nAside from the murder of Degamo, Teves and others have also been charged for the deaths of three individuals in Negros Oriental in 2019.\nThe legislator was expelled by the House of Representatives in August last year for disorderly conduct and continued absence despite an expired travel authority.",

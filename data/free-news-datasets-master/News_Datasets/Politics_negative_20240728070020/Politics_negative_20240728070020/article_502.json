    "text": "WASHINGTON â€” The number of homeless veterans jumped by more than 7.4% in 2023, according to a report released last December by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Researchers found that in one single night in January of that year, there were more than 35,000 veterans without a home. And as bad as that sounds, things may actually be worse. \"VA's data shows that nearly 300,000 veterans engaged in its homeless programs during 2023,\" said Rep. Mike Levin (D-California) during a hearing Wednesday of the House Veterans Affairs Economic Opportunity Subcommittee. The chairman of the panel demanded answers. \"Why is it that we're spending over $3.1 billion at the VA to address homelessness among our veterans this year which shakes out to about $90,000 per veteran, but the number of veterans is increasing?\" asked Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wisconsin). Van Orden continued: \"We are doing something wrong. We just are. This subcommittee needs a better picture from the VA about the actual issues veterans and providers are dealing with so we can be proactive.\" The Department of Veterans Affairs said it is making \"significant progress,\" but acknowledged \"the job is not done.\" \"Every veteran should have access to permanent housing with the supports needed to afford them dignity and allow them to achieve their potential. And we will push ourselves as long as there are veterans in need,\" said Dr., Thomas O'Toole Deputy Undersecretary/Veterans Health Administration. In 2022, the Veterans Affairs Department announced that Virginia, along with Connecticut and Delaware, had \"effectively ended\" veteran homelessness.",

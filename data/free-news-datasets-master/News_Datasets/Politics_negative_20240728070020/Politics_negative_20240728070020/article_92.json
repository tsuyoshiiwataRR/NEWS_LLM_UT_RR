    "text": "Americas\n17 arrested in Bolivia in connection with attempted coup against President Arce\nServing and retired military personnel, including General Juan Jose Zuniga Macias and former navy chief Juan Arnez Salvador, civilians arrested following coup attempt\nBOGOTA, Colombia\nThe Bolivian government announced on Thursday that 17 people, including serving and retired military personnel and civilians, have been arrested in connection with Wednesday's attempted coup against President Luis Arce.\n“A total of 17 people have been arrested for having attempted to carry out a coup within the national territory,” Interior Minister Eduardo del Castillo said in a press conference.\nBolivian General Juan Jose Zuniga Macias was among those arrested and accused of plotting a coup against the government after attempting to force his way into the Presidential Palace in La Paz with a tank on Wednesday.\nDel Castillo confirmed that Zuniga and former navy chief Juan Arnez Salvador led the group of conspirators who wanted \"to bring down a democratically elected government\" and said they face charges that could result in 15 to 30-year prison terms.\nAccording to the minister, the day before the military uprising, Arce informed the army chief that he was being relieved of his duties because his conduct \"was not in line with the political constitution\" following several attacks by Zuniga on former left-wing President Evo Morales.\nZuniga has defended himself, accusing Arce of orchestrating a self-coup to boost his popularity.\n“The president told me that he needed something to boost his popularity,” Zuniga claimed on Wednesday.\nBolivia is currently embroiled in a political crisis involving the ruling party, Movimiento al Socialismo, and former President Morales. The crisis has been caused by a rivalry between Morales and Arce, both of whom plan to run in the 2025 general elections.\nMorales ruled from 2006 until 2019 when he was deposed by the military amid widespread protests and replaced by an interim conservative government. Arce then won the 2020 election with the help of his former ally Morales before friction began to arise between them.\nThe coup attempt has been condemned by most countries in Latin America, including Ecuador, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico.\nAnadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

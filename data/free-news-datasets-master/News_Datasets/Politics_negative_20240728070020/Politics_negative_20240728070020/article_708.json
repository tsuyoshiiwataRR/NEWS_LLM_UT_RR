    "text": "Credit: KHOU FORT BEND COUNTY, Texas — The Fort Bend County Independent School District released a statement, saying it is under investigation by the Texas Education Agency. In the statement released Thursday, the district said the TEA is investigating complaints the district &quot;unlawfully incentivized students and staff to vote&quot; in the voter-approval tax rate election in 2023. That election approved a tax increase for the district. The district is also accused of violating the Texas Open Meetings Act when making decisions about its former superintendent Christie Whitbeck&#039;s abrupt retirement. “The district will fully cooperate with TEA’s investigation,” said Fort Bend ISD Superintendent Dr. Marc Smith in the statement. “We are dedicated to being transparent and will provide all requested information.” “It is a new day in Fort Bend ISD with a new administration,” Fort Bend ISD Board President Kristin Tassin said in the statement. “Our board intends to work with Dr. Smith to ensure our district fully cooperates with the TEA and is transparent with our community.” Read the full statement from FBISD below: The Texas Education Agency (TEA) has notified the district it will investigate complaints that the district unlawfully incentivized students and staff to vote in last year&#039;s 2023 VATRE election and engaged in electioneering, as well as a complaint that trustees violated the Texas Open Meetings Act when making employment decisions regarding the district’s former superintendent. “The district will fully cooperate with TEA’s investigation,” Fort Bend ISD Superintendent Dr. Marc Smith said. “We are dedicated to being transparent and will provide all requested information.” “It is a new day in Fort Bend ISD with a new administration,” Fort Bend ISD Board President Kristin Tassin said. “Our board intends to work with Dr. Smith to ensure our district fully cooperates with the TEA and is transparent with our community.” KHOU 11 on social media: Facebook | X | Instagram | YouTube",

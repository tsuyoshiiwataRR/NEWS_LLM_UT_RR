Log in here »\nThe City of Winnipeg is poised to cancel a hotly contested plan to cut $2 million from community and neighbourhood grants following intense public backlash.\nAfter about 200 people rallied against the cut in front of city hall Thursday morning, Mayor Scott Gillingham raised a successful motion to refer the plan back to council’s executive policy committee for further review next month.\nGillingham later told media he will seek ways to keep the total funding for such grants at the current $3.4-million level, instead of pursuing the plan to reduce it to $1.3 million in each of the next three years.\nMIKE DEAL / FREE PRESS\nSupporters of community organizations like ArtCity and Graffiti Gallery rallied at City Hall Thursday to try to reverse a cut to a sector they say is chronically underfunded.\n“The goal is to… maintain the total overall envelope that is in the 2024 budget for future years but that requires discussion to do that as we go into the 2025 budget,” said Gillingham. “We have to identify funding sources.”\nMany groups lobbied council to remove the cut, arguing it would hinder efforts to prevent crime and reduce support for the city’s most vulnerable people.\nAn organizer of the rally against the cuts said he believes several council members were ready to reject it due to the negative feedback.\n“The vote that was going to happen… to make the cuts and the changes to the community grants program (would) have destabilized all of these organizations. Now that vote isn’t going to happen. They’re putting the matter off and we’re very grateful,” said Eddie Ayoub, artistic director of Art City.\nAyoub said many of the non-profit organizations that depend on the grants serve Winnipeg’s most vulnerable citizens, largely in inner-city neighbourhoods.\nThe cut would mean a long list of community organizations would compete for less funding, including the Spence Neighbourhood Association, Broadway Neighbourhood Centre, Downtown Community Safety Partnership, End Homelessness Winnipeg, Main Street Project, Art City and dozens of others.\nDuring Thursday’s council meeting, several delegates were highly critical of the funding cut, with one arguing youth programs that save lives would be hindered by the changes.\n“You want to know why our kids do drugs and drink and die? Because there is nothing to do. We take away pools from marginalized communities… Would our kids rather play a game of basketball in the park… or would they rather steal food from a store because their families are too poor to afford a school lunch for the next day?” said Michelle Dallman.\nCoun. Sherri Rollins, chairwoman of the property and development committee, said she was prepared to reject the grant changes due to the funding cut, which she feared would reduce resources for key West Broadway organizations. Rollins (Fort Rouge- East Fort Garry) promised to fight for a guarantee the cut will be removed, not just postponed.\nMIKE DEAL / FREE PRESS\nThe crowd swayed council to send the plan back to council’s executive policy committee for further review next month.\nWinnipeg Free Press | Newsletter Business Weekly Monday mornings\nThe latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week.\nSign up for Business Weekly Sign Up I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies , and CASL agreement . “I’m a pretty damn good negotiator and I think there’s a lot of willingness to return to a table and get something that works for community… I want council to be focused on social and economic development,” she said.\nThe mayor said he still wants changes to assess grant applications, which would aim to ensure these align with council priorities. While he had defended the proposed cut as one way to reduce a projected $40-million city deficit, Gillingham said the feedback led him to change his stance.\n“I think hearing from the organizations, certainly, has made a difference in this case. When we’re trying to look at how we invest in front-line organizations, some of which are helping youth, for example, we want to make sure that we’re helping young people to get the services they need and activities that they need as one way to hopefully, make a dent in youth crime,” he said.\njoyanne.pursaga@freepress.mb.ca\nX: @joyanne_pursaga\nJoyanne Pursaga\nReporter\nJoyanne is city hall reporter for the Winnipeg Free Press.

Thank you for your support.\nArts groups pleased\nWinnipeg’s arts groups are cautiously celebrating a decision made at city hall Thursday to possibly cancel a proposal to slash community grant allocations by 62 per cent.\nShould the cuts go forward, West Broadway non-profit Art City’s artistic director Eddie Ayoub said they would “utterly destabilize” dozens of organizations relying on those funds, a collection including arts groups, urban clean-up crews, neighbourhood centres, Indigenous centres and environmental non-profits.\nAhead of the city’s pivot, more than 200 community members — many of whom were representing arts groups like Art City, Graffiti Art Programming and the Broadway Neighbourhood Centre’s JustTV program – colourfully voiced their disapproval.\nDressed as a seven-foot-tall dragon made of rags and calling himself a ‘ragon,’ educator and puppeteer Curtis Wiebe showed up to make a stand for sustained arts funding for youth. “I just think that at this time when our youth are dealing so often with depression or anxiety, taking this kind of funding away would be totally wrong-headed,” he said.\nRallygoers carried placards that read “Widen community, not Kenaston” and “These cuts are nuts — be nut free.”\nGraffiti Art Programming co-founder Steven Wilson said such cuts would devastate the youth and families his organization works with at a time when they need the support from the city “more than ever.”\nArtist Toby Gillies said the city should be ashamed of proposing cuts in the first place.\n“It felt really good to be in that space with those people celebrating that this cut is not going to be made at this time, but what it shows us is that the city put that on the table because they don’t see enough value in the work that these organizations do,” said Gillies, sitting with his collaborator, Natalie Baird.\nAfter the news of council’s U-turn reached demonstrators, Art City founder and visual artist Wanda Koop grabbed the microphone to make a proposal.\n“Double the money!” she said repeatedly, leading a chant for increased support. “Triple the money!”\n— Ben Waldman\nJoyanne Pursaga\nReporter\nJoyanne is city hall reporter for the Winnipeg Free Press.

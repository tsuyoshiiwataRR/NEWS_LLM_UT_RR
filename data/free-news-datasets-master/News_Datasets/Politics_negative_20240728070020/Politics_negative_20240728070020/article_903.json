    "text": "Justice Department agencies have warned of budget cut fallout\nPublished in\n[News & Features](/currentnews/newsheadlines/)\nWASHINGTON — House Republicans proposed another round of funding cuts to the Justice Department this week, despite warnings from agency officials that past cutbacks are hampering their law enforcement and public safety work.\nHouse appropriators rolled out a draft fiscal 2025 Commerce-Justice-Science spending bill that would slash funds for the DOJ and several of its entities that got reductions in the previous fiscal year, including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\nATF Director Steven Dettelbach, whose agency got a $47 million cut to its salary and expenses account in the current fiscal year, has said that he had to cancel three new special agent classes, which he said would have equated to about 10 to 12 fully staffed squads of agents.\nThe fiscal 2025 spending bill would cut that agency account by a further $188.5 million, according to a Republican summary.\n“The president has again called on Congress to fully fund ATF,” Dettelbach said at an event Tuesday in Ohio. “Yet, unfortunately, just this morning, the House of Representatives released a plan to impose even further, deeper, more damaging cuts on ATF.”\nBiden administration officials have told lawmakers in recent months that they are wading through the reverberations of the fiscal 2024 cuts, which Republican lawmakers secured in a negotiated spending package that cleared Congress earlier this year.\nU.S. attorney offices, which prosecute federal crimes, would see an 11% cut in fiscal 2025 under the Republican-backed bill. Funding for those offices was virtually kept even last fiscal year, but they are feeling the pinch.\nAdam Hanna, vice president of policy and advocacy at National Association of Assistant U.S. Attorneys, said they’ve heard from members that their offices are not being authorized to fill vacancies, particularly in legal support roles, and that they may have to live with unfilled positions until further notice.\nThe fiscal 2025 spending bill would cut the FBI’s funding by 3.5%. In April, FBI Director Christopher Wray said the agency’s fiscal 2024 budget was about $500 million less than what the agency needed to sustain its 2023 efforts.\n“It’s about a $500 million cut in our ability to get our job done,” he told lawmakers.\n...continued\n©2024 CQ-Roll Call, Inc., All Rights Reserved.

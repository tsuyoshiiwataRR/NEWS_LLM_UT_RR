    "text": "Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was in full fib mode yesterday on Morning Joe, an arm of the Biden administration’s Mainstream Media Information Ministry.\nWith more than\n300 terror suspects caught at the border this fiscal year, along with the Biden “migrant” terrorists whom Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has caught, Mayorkas told viewers that the “migrant” terror threat is much ado about nothing.\nAnd if anyone is to blame for the “migrant” invasion Biden invited and has illegally aided and abetted, it’s Congress. It needs to “fix” the problem.\nBoth claims are palpably false. And Mayorkas knows it.\nWhat He Said\nCo-host Mika Brzezinski — daughter of\nDeep State apparatchik Zbigniew — asked Mayorkas about the possibility that terrorists might enter the country. And, she wanted to know, why is the administration releasing “migrants” before asylum claims are adjudicated?\n“There two issues here I want to ask you about,” she began:\nThe first is NBC News reporting that the Department of Homeland Security has identified over 400 immigrants who have come to the U.S. from Central Asia and elsewhere as subjects of concern, and some even affiliated, potentially, with an ISIS-affiliated human-smuggling network. That’s number one. And then number two, reporting from NBC News that the administration is still releasing illegal crossers inside the U.S. to live while they pursue asylum claims; that it’s not officially really working and it’s still — there are still a lot of folks coming through here the way they shouldn’t.\nMayorkas, whom the\nU.S. House of Representatives impeached for breaking U.S. immigration laws and creating policies not authorized by Congress, was ready. Not to worry, he said. We have everything under control. And by the way, the invasion that Biden invited isn’t his fault. Blame Congress.\n“Well, if I may correct you in a number of regards, number one, with respect to the people from Central Asia, we have no evidence that they are individuals plotting to harm the United States,” Mayorkas said. He apparently forgot that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\n“That is inaccurate,” the\nunindicted visa fraudster continued:\nIt’s very important to note that the safety and security of the American people [is] our highest priority. We screen and vet individuals at the time of encounter. If we learn of derogatory information, we take enforcement action. We are proceeding with extreme caution here in the service of the security and safety of the American people.\nThen Mayorkas blamed “detention capacity” for Biden’s releasing millions of unvetted “migrants” to roam free,\nraping and murdering Americans.\n“Fundamentally, we’re operating within a broken immigration system,” he claimed. “We need Congress to fix it. Everyone agrees with that. It hasn’t been fixed since 1996.”\nThe Truth\nIn fact, the administration does have evidence that individuals from Central Asia are plotting terror attacks.\nICE and the FBI recently arrested eight would-be bombers from Central Asia’s Tajikistan who entered at the southern border and were supposedly “fully vetted,” Fox News’ Bill Melugin reported.\n“I’m told all 8 crossed the southern border illegally, received ‘full vetting,’ and had no initial derogatory information that flagged,” he wrote on X:\nI’m told derogatory info/potential national security concerns flagged later on — apparently after release into the US. Source was unable to say when and where they crossed illegally into the US.\nIn January,\nICE agents collared a Somali al-Shabaab terrorist in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Border agents caught him last year in March and released him. Only after that release did the Terrorist Screening Center confirm that he was, indeed, a member of the deadly terrorist outfit.\nOn May 3, a Jordanian illegal alien and another unknown individual\ntried to enter Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia in a box truck. They pretended to be delivering for Amazon. On March 27, a Chinese national tried to enter the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center at Twenty-Nine Palms, California.\nThose arrests, and\nBiden’s permitting thousands of Chinese and other nationals from hostile nations to enter the country, explain why 10 former FBI officials wrote a letter to top elected officials on Capitol Hill to warn about a terror attack.\n“It would be difficult to overstate the danger represented by the presence inside our borders of what is comparatively a multi-division army of young single adult males from hostile nations and regions whose background, intent, or allegiance is completely unknown,” the officials wrote.\nAs well,\nthey wrote:\nA startling number had been found on the terror watch list or are from countries designated as state sponsors of terror or distinctly unfriendly to the United States. …\nThese men are potential operators in what appears to be an accelerated and strategic penetration, a soft invasion, designed to gain internal access to a country that cannot be invaded militarily in order to inflict catastrophic damage if and when enemies deem it necessary.\nThat warning apparently had no effect on the Democratic legislators who received it. Biden and Mayorkas obviously ignored it.\nNo, Congress Needn’t “Fix” It\nThe second fib was that Congress must “fix” the border problem. No one, including Mayorkas, believes that Democrat talking point.\nThe “migrant” invasion at the border began pursuant to illegal executive orders from Biden and Mayorkas that formed the basis of the impeachment case against Mayorkas.\nThe articles detail Mayorkas’ “willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law,” a charge that applies to Biden as well. The articles charged Mayorkas with “a catch and release scheme, whereby such aliens are unlawfully released, even without effective mechanisms to ensure appearances before the immigration courts for removal proceedings or to ensure removal in the case of aliens ordered removed.”\nAnd with this “\nGuidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law,” released on September 30, 2021, Mayorkas simply rewrote the nation’s immigration laws. He stopped the deportation of deportable illegals, including dangerous illegal-alien criminals. A criminal conviction, he wrote, is no reason to deport an illegal alien.\nBiden and Mayorkas have\nignored black-letter law in the Secure Fence Act and Immigration and Nationality Act, by releasing and not detaining and not deporting deportable illegals. And they have committed federal felonies by bringing in and harboring illegal aliens.\nThat aside, Biden undertook all the policies that invited the invasion, not least his illegal program to “parole” illegals — another item in Mayorkas’ impeachment — without congressional authorization.\nThus, Congress needn’t fix anything.\n“For months, the President and his White House have claimed they need a new law to take any action on the border,” GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X during negotiations over border-security legislation:\nThat was patently false. …\nThe President has ample authority to take a range of actions to stem the flow of illegal immigration. He has a moral and legal responsibility to do all he can to try to reverse the catastrophe he has created.\nH/T:\nBreitbart",

    "text": "It's June end, and sowing has begun in parts of Maharashtra. However, the banks have not met even 50% of the crop loan disbursal target in Vidarbha for the Kharif season, reported.A large section of farmers depend on annual crop loans to meet their cultivation expenses each year. The PSU banks, which have the biggest share, have barely covered 30% of the target, shows the progress report maintained by the state govt.Maharashtra deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis had warned during a state-level banker committee meeting of an FIR against bankers if they insist on CIBIL scores before lending to farmers. Vidarbha's 11 districts are divided into Nagpur and Amravati divisions. In Amravati division, which has agrarian-crisis-ridden districts, the banks have so far covered 48% of their target of lending over Rs 8,028 crore for the Kharif season. In Nagpur division, the target has been fixed at Rs 5,247 crore out of which Rs 2,355 crore has been lent. This amounts to 44% of the target.PSU banks have met 25% of the target in Nagpur and 30% in Amravati.",

    "text": "Abortion Is Health Care\nAccess to safe, legal abortion is access to vital health care—and we need those in power to take action now to ensure accessible, high-quality health care to everyone in America.\nSign this Petition\nMEMORANDUM\nTo: Interested Parties\nFrom: Rahna Epting, Executive Director, MoveOn Political Action\nRE: RFK Jr., Stein, & West: Off the Debate Stage but Threatening to Elect Trump\nDate: June 27, 2024\nThird-Party Presidential Candidates Are A Threat Democrats Cannot Ignore.\nWith tonight’s debate, President Biden and Donald Trump will go toe-to-toe with dueling visions for our country—one a positive economic vision that will protect civil and reproductive rights, and the other an authoritarian hellscape that rips away the hard-fought progress we’ve won while tipping economic scales further toward billionaires. Simply put: We cannot go backward. We must go forward—and that means defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box in November.\nIn what is already a difficult environment for any sitting president, President Biden has the distinct misfortune of competing against Trump with third-party spoiler candidates threatening to peel off just enough support to tilt the election Trump’s way. Just as Jill Stein and Gary Johnson did in 2016 and as Ralph Nader did in 2000.\nUnfortunately, that is by design. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is receiving financial backing from\nTrump’s largest donor, to the tune of $25 million. Jill Stein, running almost openly as a puppet for Vladimir Putin, refuses to attack Trump—saving barbs solely for President Biden. Meanwhile, Cornel West is actively accepting help from GOP operatives to get on the ballot in multiple states.\nTrump\nhas even gone so far as to praise West and Stein for the votes they will assuredly take from President Biden, and in doing so, he is saying the quiet part out loud: third-party candidates are core to his electoral strategy.\nTo be clear, RFK Jr., Jill Stein, and Cornel West have no chance of winning the presidency, and their presence in the race will continue to be a boon to Trump—and he knows it. A vote for any of those candidates will move us perilously closer to a second Trump presidency, in which our democracy may not survive.\nThe stakes could not be higher, and that’s why\nwe are sounding the alarm and fighting back. In 2000 and 2016, Democrats saw the disastrous effect third-party candidates can have on an election’s outcome. Moreover, our entire country felt the consequences of sliding-door moments that took our country offtrack. We cannot afford to make those mistakes again.\nSpoiler Candidates Are Getting On Battleground Ballots—With Gop Help.\nIn states across the country, third-party candidates are working\nhand in glove with shady Trump operatives to help get RFK Jr., Stein, and West on the ballot. Republican involvement signals that their true intent is to damage President Biden’s reelection chances by peeling away thousands of votes where the margins are already razor thin. By accepting Republican support, those same third-party campaigns are betraying the very voters they are courting. We will continue to monitor, call out, and publicly challenge the association between third-party candidates and Republican operatives and donors—to make it clear what actual team these candidates are playing for.\nHere are the latest updates on ballot access:\nRFK Jr. Poll Numbers Are Fading—But It Will Take Only 1 Or 2% To Help Trump Win.\nRecent Press Coverage For Spoiler Candidates Is —Yikes!\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.\nJill Stein\nCornel West\nWe Ignore History At Our Peril.\nRFK Jr., Stein, and West cannot win the presidency, but in a race that may be decided by 1 or 2% in a half dozen states, their impact will be outsized, and their threat must be mitigated. We will keep fighting to make sure Americans understand what is truly at stake: A vote for RFK Jr., Stein, or West is the exact same as a vote for Trump.\nThis is an all-hands-on-deck moment that requires support from everyone in the anti-Trump coalition to defeat the third-party threat and deny Donald Trump a second, more dangerous shot at power.\n###\nMoveOn is celebrating 25 years of people-powered progress this year.

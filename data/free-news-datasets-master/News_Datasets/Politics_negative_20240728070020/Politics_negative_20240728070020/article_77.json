    "text": "MAGA Republican and accused\ncarpetbagger Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert on Thursday asked the tough question everyone wants to know — why should the commander-in-chief be able to refuse a debate drug-test when U.S. troops cannot?\nBoebert's question echoes a familiar right-wing talking point that's made the rounds in recent days in what appears to be an effort to pre-shield former President Donald\nTrump ahead of the debate Thursday night on CNN.\nTrump and his fellow conservatives have floated the idea for days that Biden will use performance-enhancing drugs as they go toe-to-toe. Political analysts have suggested Trump fears his attacks on Biden have lowered the bar the president must clear to win — and is trying to prepare his base for his own defeat.\n\"There is no evidence that Biden has used or plans to use performance-enhancing drugs,\" writes Washington Post political reporter Hannah Knowles. \"But Trump and his supporters have spread the baseless claim widely.\"\nBefore Boebert, Rep. Nancy Mace expressed similar sentiments.\nALSO READ:\nMarjorie Taylor Greene buys condo in 'crime ridden hell hole' Mace (R-SC) raised the alarm about the terrifying prospect that Biden could be on a popular ADHD medication.\n\"How much Adderall are they gonna give him?\" Mace asked. \"How many vitamins is he gonna be on?\"\nNot one to avoid the GOP playbook, Boebert did her part to cast doubt on the upcoming intellectual exchange of ideas.\n\"Members of our military cannot just refuse a drug test because they don’t want to take one,\" she wrote on X. \"Why is the Commander in Chief any different?\"\nAnd when Boebert spoke, the internet laughed.\n\"This is such a\ndeeply stupid analogy,\" wrote conservative Army Iraq War Veteran Peter Henlein. \"There is no good debate drug. If there was, I am sure both candidates would be taking it.\"\n\"\nWhen can we drug test you Lauren?\" questioned @MailePRMedia.\n\"Members of the military\ncan’t be convicted felons,\" retorted @jeffreymlevy. \"Why is the republican nominee for President and Commander in Chief any different?\"\n\"Hopefully your son is going to be required to take a\ndrug test as part of his probation?\" @DenisonBarbs fired back.\n\"Everyone has the right to be stupid and ignorant, but you just\nabuse that privilege,\" said @ChidiNwatu.\nBoebert was among four of just 18 Republican party-endorsed candidates to\nwin their primary on Tuesday night. She moved to the reliably Republican Fourth Congressional District, where Republican Rep. Ken Buck resigned in March, after facing a near-inevitable loss in her existing district.",

    "text": "Pete Buttigieg Obliterates House Republican’s Racist Conspiracy\nRepresentative Mike Collins tried to blame the Norfolk Southern train derailment on DEI.\nRepublicans are still hung up on diversity, equity, and inclusion principles\nsomehow being a factor in the 2023 Norfolk Southern train derailment, where toxic chemicals were released into the town of East Palestine, Ohio.\nSecretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg appeared before the House Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure Thursday to\ndiscuss the committee’s 2025 fiscal budget and oversight of the department, but the conversation quickly went off on a tangent about the derailment.\n“Norfolk Southern, in their annual shareholders report, said that they were going to focus on DEI initiatives over anything else, and that’s what led to that accident,” Representative Mike Collins\nsaid to Buttigieg, who quickly responded in the negative.\n“I’ve never seen a single shred of data or evidence associating what happened—and somehow trying to blame that on women and minorities, that really is not consistent with what the [National Transportation Safety Board] found,” Buttigieg\nsaid, referring to an NTSB report on the disaster released earlier this week, with Collins trying to speak over him the whole time.\nCollins has blamed the recent rise in freight train derailments\non DEI for more than a year now instead of actual factors, such as deregulation, railroad companies lobbying politicians for weaker laws that made the rails less safe, or the poor working conditions imposed on rail workers. He seems to have given weight to nonsensical conspiracy theories instead of the obvious reality: Corporations are putting profits over safety.\nIt’s no surprise that Collins would blame DEI, as it’s conservatives’ favorite bugbear these days, becoming a useful euphemism for racism and bigotry. Republicans in Congress\nintroduced a bill to ban DEI from all government offices and contracting earlier this month, and blaming DEI was among the many conspiracies thrown around after the Baltimore bridge collapse in March. Last year, DEI was blamed for the Hawaii wildfires, and Ron DeSantis has practically used most of his time as governor of Florida to launch a statewide crusade against DEI.\nWho’s to say Donald Trump won’t try to sneak in DEI in Thursday night’s presidential debate? After all, he and his supporters have already announced plans to fight the made-up problem of “\nanti-white racism” if the convicted felon returns to the White House.",

    "text": "One major difference between the 2020 election and now is that the Fox networks isn't giving Donald\nTrump the time on its airwaves that it once did.\nFor years, Fox showed every moment of Trump rallies, but in the 2024 election, the network stopped.\nSpeaking to MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace, senior spokesperson Adrienne Elrod pointed out that it's\noften a topic of conversation on \"Deadline White House.\"\nOne question she said she hopes is asked is if Trump believes that Joe Biden is the president.\nALSO READ:\nTrump botched America’s pandemic response —but a 2nd term would be even more catastrophic\n\"That's going to be a major contrast moment for President Biden and Donald Trump,\" Elrod said. \"Donald Trump, if he passes any precedence here, he's going to make it clear he does not believe Joe Biden won the election. He's going to say that. That's going to be a major contrast moment. You talk a lot about how often we don't see Donald Trump. All the time. His rallies are not being aired on every single network.\"\nWallace chimed in that Fox refuses to air them. Her colleagues have pointed out that\nFox tends to cut from the rallies the second Trump says something they perceive could hurt him.\n\"Fox stopped airing them, prime example,\" Elrod agreed. \"We have to remind the American people what we're dealing with. The unhinged person.\"\nThe debate will display what other networks aren't showing, some have argued.\n\"By the way,\" Elrod also said. \"I don't have to tell you this; he's become more unhinged since he's been president. Something set him off. He's become more erratic.\"\nShe said that it is essentially the American people who see and understand the difference.\n\"This is somebody who was crazy before. He's crazier now, and that will be a major moment for President Biden. Not only to help make that contrast clear tonight, but also talk about how he's going to continue to deliver for the American people,\" she closed.\nSee the conversation below or at the link here.\nBiden campaign thinks Fox effort to hide Trump from voters can be destroyed with debate\nyoutu.be",

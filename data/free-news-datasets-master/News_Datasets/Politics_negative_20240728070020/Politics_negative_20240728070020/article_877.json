    "text": "U.S.\nSupreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dressed down her conservative colleagues Thursday despite a decision that will allow for emergency abortions in Idaho for now.\nIn a ruling\nleaked the day before, the high court dismissed an appeal by Idaho officials and allowed a stay ordered by a lower court to remain in place. The Supreme Court's decision effectively left the question about emergency abortions in Idaho undecided.\nJackson said there was \"no good reason\" that the court could not immediately decide the case.\nAlthough Jackson voted with the majority, she blasted the court for the way the case was handled.\nALSO READ:\nMarjorie Taylor Greene buys condo in 'crime ridden hell hole'\n\"We cannot simply wind back the clock to how things were before the Court injected itself into this matter,\" Jackson wrote in her partial dissent. \"We permitted Idaho's law to go into effect by staying the District Court's injunction in the first place, then allowed this matter to sit on our merits docket for five months while we considered the question presented.\"\n\"It is too little, too late for the Court to take a mulligan and just tell the lower courts to carry on as if none of this has happened,\" she added. \"As the old adage goes: The Court has made this bed so now it must lie in itâ€”by proceeding to decide the merits of the critical pre-emption issue this case presents.\"\nThe decision comes two years after the court struck down Roe v. Wade and federal abortion rights.\nRead the entire ruling\nhere.",

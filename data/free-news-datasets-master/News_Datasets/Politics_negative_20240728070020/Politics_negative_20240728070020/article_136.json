    "text": "Councillors have backed a 4.9 per cent rates rise for the coming financial year despite acknowledging concerns around the rampant cost-of-living crisis.\nThe Shire of Augusta-Margaret River defended the increase, saying it was lower than many other local governments’ rate hikes in the South West. It said residential ratepayers would pay no more than $2 per week from the increase. But that claim was roundly scoffed by electors who lodged objections.\nAt Tuesday night’s meeting in Augusta, councillors instructed staff to find further cost efficiencies to ensure a balanced budget and to meet a $286,000 shortfall.\nThe draft budget received 23 formal objections, the majority of which cited cost-of-living pressures as well as challenges in business as a reason for councillors to stay their hands.\n Objectors also asked for the local government to focus on essential services.\n“The shire president has recently said the shire is not rich, and yet it continues to function as if it is, and indeed act as if it does not need to make any change in what it does, how it does it or what it spends,” one ratepayer noted.\nThey also questioned growth within the shire’s own workforce as a matter to be considered, though shire documents forecast further growth in staff, including new positions this coming financial year.\nBut the report recommended no changes be made.\nOneobjector described ongoing rates increases as “suffocating” while others acknowledged the 4.9 per cent bump was “on the low side” compared to neighbouring shires.\nThe budget would be forwarded to ensure approval and compliance with the Department of Local Government’s ratings policy and was expected to return for final adoption on July 24.",

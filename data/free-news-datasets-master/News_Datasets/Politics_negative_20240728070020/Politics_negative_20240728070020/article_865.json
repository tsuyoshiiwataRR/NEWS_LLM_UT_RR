    "text": "Israel launched air strikes on Gaza Thursday, continuing the conflict despite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent comments that the “intense phase” of the war was nearing its end. Overnight and early Thursday, Israeli strikes killed at least five people in Gaza City and one in Beit Lahia, according to Hamas officials and medics.\nHeavy fighting and shelling were reported in northern Gaza’s Shujayia market, causing significant displacement of residents. Israeli forces also targeted buildings in Rafah and a school complex in Khan Younis.\nThe conflict, which began with Hamas’ October 7 attack on southern Israel, has resulted in significant casualties. Israel’s retaliatory strikes have killed at least 37,765 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, while 1,195 people, primarily civilians, died in the initial Hamas attack, according to Israeli figures.\nThe humanitarian crisis in Gaza is dire, with hospitals struggling and essentials in short supply. Efforts for a ceasefire and hostage release deal have yet to succeed, as Israel rejects Hamas’ demands for a permanent end to fighting and troop withdrawal.",

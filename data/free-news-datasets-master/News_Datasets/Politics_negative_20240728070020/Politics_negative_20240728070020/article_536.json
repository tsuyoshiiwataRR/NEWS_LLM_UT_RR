    "text": "After what was surely a couple days of rowdy celebrations, it’s now time for the Latvian champion to rest. The Boston Celtics announced on Thursday that centre Kristaps Porzingis underwent successful surgery to repair a torn retinaculum and dislocated posterior tibialis tendon and is expected to miss five to six months of action. Porzingis, 28, suffered the injury in Game 2 of the NBA Finals but delayed a repair procedure in order to remain active throughout the series. And although he did miss Games 3 and 4, he did return for the title-clinching Game 5 as the Celtics earned banner 18. The one-time All-Star joined Boston via trade last off-season and immediately became a game-changer for the 64-18 Celtics. Aside from his floor spacing ability on offence, Porzingis quickly became Beantown’s top rim protector as well. Through 57 regular-season games, he averaged 20.1 points, 7.2 rebounds and 1.9 blocks on 64.7 per cent true shooting. Porzingis did face his fair share of injuries, however, as par for the course throughout his career. After missing 25 regular-season games, the injury bug caught up with the former fourth-overall pick in the post-season too. He suffered a calf strain in round one against the Miami Heat and then didn’t return until the Finals against the Dallas Mavericks. After helping Boston secure the title, he became the first Latvian-born player in NBA history to win a championship. Missing five to six months after surgery also means Porzingis will miss next month’s FIBA Olympic qualifying tournament, and should Latvia qualify for Paris, that as well.

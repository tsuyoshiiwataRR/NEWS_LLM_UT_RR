    "text": "CNN rules exclude WHCA reporters from in-studio coverage of debate between Trump and Biden The first debate on Thursday is hosted by CNN The White House Correspondents’ Association criticized CNN on Thursday for blocking outside reporters from in-studio coverage of the first 2024 presidential debate. CNN is hosting the debate without a live studio audience. The White House travel pool won’t be able to be inside studio despite repeat requests for access. “WHCA is deeply concerned that CNN has rejected our repeated requests to include the White House travel pool inside the studio,” association President Kelly O’Donnell [said](https://x.com/KellyO/status/1806396283994931425) in a statement posted to X. CNN's handling of the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle has already faced harsh [criticism](https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/elections/presidential-debate-commission-chairman-slams-cnn-over-upcoming-debate) from conservatives and even the chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates.",

They're going to keep escalating until they claim \"we have to fight them there so we don't have to fight them here.\" They're going to get into a nuclear war with Russia. CNN claims these military contractors will \"only\" be repairing the engines of war Ukraine is using to attack Russia. Well, first of all, Russia will certainly consider repairing and improving America-provided military armaments to be an act of war. Second of all, I sure do remember American governments sending military advisors into foreign countries claiming their role would be strictly of a non-combat nature...\n... The discussions follow a series of decisions the US has made in recent months to try to help Ukraine beat back the Russians. In late-May, Biden gave Ukraine permission to strike targets inside Russia, near the border with the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, with US weapons--a request the US had repeatedly denied in the past. Last week, that policy appeared to expand once again, when National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Ukraine could counterstrike anywhere along the Ukraine-Russia border using US weapons.So prudent.\nBiden is going to Mr Magoo us into WW III. Dumb bastard. Posted by: Frank Barone\nI believe you. I also believe President Johnson when he tells me we're just sending a few dozen \"military advisors\" to Vietnam. You know who's behind this, right?\n\"This would be a much more focused and thoughtful effort to support Ukraine in country,\" said retired Army officer Alex Vindman, who served as the director for European Affairs on former President Donald Trump's National Security Council. Vindman has been pushing the administration to lift the restrictions for nearly two years and said the administration has been working on a plan to ease the restrictions since earlier this year.This how The Regime gets America into foreign wars it does not want to fight: It's always just the tip, just the tip, just a little bit further now, boom, Now Our Flag Is On the Line and you're pregnant with a nuclear war with Russia. Oops! Ooopsie!\nSo, what apparently happened was: A US made ATACMS detonated cluster bombs over a recreational beach in Crimea on Sunday afternoon, killing four people and wounding more than 150.The video in the post I linked shows that attack.\nA Russian fighter jet shot down a US drone off of Crimea in international waters in response. (US drones are used to provide targeting information for \"Ukrainian\" weapons.) The Russian government responded with \"no comment\" when asked about shooting down the drone. The US government chose not to make an issue of the drone shootdown. We are very, very close to World War Three. Posted by: The ARC of History!Russia is warning the US about this.\nUkraine, Moscow warns Washington: \"With weapons in Kiev there is a risk of escalation\"American weapons, Moscow means.\nWhile Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the troops engaged in repelling the massive Russian attacks in Donetsk, on the 'diplomatic' front there was yet another distant clash between Moscow and Washington. Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, during a telephone conversation with Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin, warned the US of the \"danger of further escalation of the situation in connection with the ongoing supply\" of US weapons to the Ukrainian armed forces . The Kremlin then made it known that, at the moment, no telephone call is planned between Russian President Vladimir Putin and American President Joe Biden. ... On the battlefield, Moscow later reported that its army destroyed three US-made Himars multiple-launch rocket launchers and the \"foreign specialists\" operating them.Are they saying that American \"contractors\" are already in Ukraine?\nZelensky is going to deal with non-Urkanians \"shirking\" their \"duties\" to fight Russia with a \"hard fist\"? What?\nFunny this isn't being reported by the American media. BTW I didn't translate that. I wanted to, but it's hard, guys. It's the google translation. Italian is easy to hear and easy to speak, but it's much harder to read than French. My vocabulary is still molto poco.\nBoy, I remember when \"they're gonna provoke a nuclear war with Russia\" was Tucker Carlson Nutter Territory. Good times, good times. Posted by: Problem with conspiracy theories is that they keep being vindicated yes, I meant to admit that I was doubting this \"just the tip, just the tip\" escalation into actual war, but I was wrong. I was hurrying to get the post up. I'll add that admission now.

Products typically include military or civilian aircraft, ships, vehicles, weaponry, and electronic systems, while services can include logistics, technical support and training, communications support, and engineering support in cooperation with the government.\nSecurity contractors do not generally provide direct support of military operations. Under the 1949 Geneva Conventions, military contractors engaged in direct support of military operations may be legitimate targets of military interrogation.\n\"List of companies\"\nThis is a list of the world's largest arms manufacturers and other military service companies, along with their countries of origin.

    "text": "Dozens of residents from across the region showed up Thursday afternoon for a protest outside Kitchener-Conestoga MPP Mike Harris’ constituency office in Elmira, calling for transparency about a secretive industrial land assembly process that’s left a group of Wilmot landowners in limbo and the surrounding community confused.\n“The lack of transparency is despicable,” said Anne Loeffler, a Wilmot resident who joined a group of about 50 sign-holders along Arthur Street, garnering honks and words of support from passersby.\n×\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts Earlier this year, a consultant acting on behalf of the Region of Waterloo offered Wilmot landowners money for about 770 acres of farmland between Highway 7/8 and Bleams Road, from Wilmot Centre to Nafziger Road. If a settlement couldn’t be reached, they were informed their land would be expropriated.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Owners of about dozen properties refused to sell and there’s been a groundswell of community support to fight the process, with an online petition garnering more than 35,000 signatures and more than 2,000 people purchasing signs to put their displeasure on display.\nOpposition politicians, environmental advocates and farm groups including the Ontario Federation of Agriculture threw their support behind the fight after many local officials including municipal council members refused to speak publicly due to signing non-disclosure agreements, though they won’t say with whom.\nPeople gathered in front of Mike Harris MPP’s Elmira constituency office to protest the land expropriation in Wilmot May 23. Wilmot Township councillors wouldn’t allow farmer Stewart Snyder to give his views on the issue on Monday.\nMathew McCarthy",

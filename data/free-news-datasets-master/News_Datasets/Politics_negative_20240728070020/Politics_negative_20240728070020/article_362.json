    "text": "According to NBS the US is preparing to evacuate Americans from Lebanon should the fighting between Hezbollah and Israel intensify. The increased military activity and the rhetoric suggest a risk of escalation, potentially opening up another front. - The Pentagon is repositioning U.S. military assets closer to Israel and Lebanon. - USS Wasp and Marines from the 24th Expeditionary Unit have moved into the Mediterranean. - The Wasp will be ready for Military Assisted Departure and other missions - Cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah is escalating - U.S. officials are concerned about potential Israeli airstrikes and a ground offensive in Lebanon - Israel aims to create a 10-mile buffer zone above the Lebanese border, preferring a diplomatic solution but ready to use force if necessary - The U.S. is coordinating with allies for possible evacuations and coalition military operations - The U.S. Embassy in Beirut has warned Americans to reconsider travel to Lebanon - Canada is preparing contingency plans to evacuate 20,000 Canadians from Lebanon",

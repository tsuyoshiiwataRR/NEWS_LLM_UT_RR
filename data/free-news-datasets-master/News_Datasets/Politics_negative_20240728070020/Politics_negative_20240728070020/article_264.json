    "text": "The NIDCOM said on Thursday that the warning was as a result of an outcry following a distressing incident involving one Rev. Dr. Israel Kristilere, the CEO of Oasis of Faith Intercontinental Limited and President of the Christian Tourism Practitioners Association of Nigeria (CTPAN). The Chairman/CEO of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Abike Dabiri-Erewa, has condemned the reported mistreatment of Nigerian pilgrims at the Cairo Airport in Egypt, while emphasising the importance of vigilance for Nigerians travelling abroad. The NIDCOM said on Thursday that the warning was as a result of an outcry following a distressing incident involving one Rev. Dr. Israel Kristilere, the CEO of Oasis of Faith Intercontinental Limited and President of the Christian Tourism Practitioners Association of Nigeria (CTPAN). The commission said that during a layover en route to Israel on April 30th, 2024, Rev. Kristilere and his group faced discrimination and undue suspicion from Cairo airport security. Also recounting the ordeal, Rev. Kristilere detailed how he and fellow pilgrims were delayed for hours due to a misunderstanding during boarding procedures. He described being detained under false accusations, which he vehemently denied, and was coerced into an apology to avoid legal repercussions. In a press statement, the NIDCOM boss represented by Dr. Sule Yakubu Bassi, Secretary to the Commission, affirmed NIDCOM's commitment to investigate the incident thoroughly. She assured that the commission would collaborate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Nigerian Embassy in Egypt to address the matter formally. \"No Nigerian should endure such inhumane treatment abroad,\" stated Dabiri-Erewa, expressing her solidarity with Rev. Kristilere and the affected pilgrims. PRESS RELEASE DABIRI-EREWA ADVICES AS ANOTHER NIGERIAN MALTREATED IN CAIRO AIRPORT Abuja, June 28, 2024. Hon.

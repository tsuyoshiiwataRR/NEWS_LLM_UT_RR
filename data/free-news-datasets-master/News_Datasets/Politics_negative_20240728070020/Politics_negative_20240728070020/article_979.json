    "text": "Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday announced that the government would introduce a resolution in the National Assembly in response to the one passed by the US House of Representatives a day earlier expressing “robust support” for democracy in Pakistan. Responding to the Sunni Ittehad Council MNAs who pointed out the US legislation during the budget session, the deputy premier stressed the need to express the country’s sovereignty and unity. On Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution with a staggering majority of 98%, calling for a “full and independent investigation of claims of interference or irregularities in Pakistan’s February 2024 election”. A total of 368 members voted in favour of the resolution against only seven opposing it. Speaking in the NA on Thursday, Dar read out the country’s Foreign Office response to the US resolution. He added that the FO had responded effectively to the US motion and the draft of the resolution to be introduced by the government in the NA to counter it was ready. The deputy premier told the House that the government had taken notice of the US motion, adding that the draft of the counter resolution would be shared with both the treasury and opposition benches. Dar said Pakistan believed in constructive dialogue and engagement based on mutual respect as well as understanding. “However, such resolutions are neither constructive, nor objective.” The deputy premier hoped that the US House of Representatives would play a supportive role in strengthening Pakistan-US ties and focus on avenues of mutual collaboration that benefitted the people of both the countries. The deputy premier highlighted the need to come together in unity with a clear resolution in response to the US motion. He said the counter resolution would be passed once the debate on the budget for the next fiscal year had concluded. Dar also extended an invitation to the opposition for cooperation on a constitutional amendment to grant voting rights to overseas Pakistanis. “I am ready to discuss giving voting rights to overseas Pakistanis.” The deputy PM highlighted that the government had openly pursued the cause of Palestinians. He added that the government had called for an end to the atrocities against Palestinians and removal of obstacles to humanitarian assistance to the citizens of Gaza. “It would be unjustified to say that the government did not raise the issue of Palestine.” The deputy PM noted that the government took steps to remove Islamophobic content from social media. Speaking on the issue of Afghanistan, Dar said peace in the neighbouring country was in the interest of Pakistan. “Afghanistan will remain on our priority agenda.” The deputy premier, who also holds the portfolio of the foreign ministry, maintained that the current government had started economic diplomacy. Dar continued that the House would be taken into confidence on the foreign policy at any time. He said Pakistan had the capacity to achieve its economic targets in three years instead of 12.

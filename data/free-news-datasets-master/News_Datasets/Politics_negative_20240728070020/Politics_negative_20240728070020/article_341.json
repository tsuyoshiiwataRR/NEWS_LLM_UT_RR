    "text": "NEW DELHI: A day after Samajwadi Party MP R K Chaudhary demanded the removal of 'sengol' from Lok Sabha, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath said it revealed the ignorance of the SP leader and demonstrated lack of respect for Indian history and culture.\\\"Sengol is India's pride and PM Modi has bestowed upon it the highest honour in Parliament. Samajwadi Party has no respect for Indian history and culture. The comments of its top leaders on the sengol are reprehensible,\\\" Adityanath said in a post on X.\\\"It shows their ignorance and also reflects the hatred of the INDI Alliance towards Tamil culture,\\\" he added.Minister of state for parliamentary affairs L Murugan, a former president of the Tamil Nadu BJP, said the sceptre was the pride of every Tamilian. \\\"It is also mentioned in Tirukkural (by poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar), which spoke about how the sengol plays a role in govt. When India got freedom, (governor general) Mountbatten and Jawaharlal Nehru had spoken about how power would be handed over after independence and when Rajaji (C Rajagopalachari) was consulted, he said it can be done using a sengol,\\\" Murugan said.",

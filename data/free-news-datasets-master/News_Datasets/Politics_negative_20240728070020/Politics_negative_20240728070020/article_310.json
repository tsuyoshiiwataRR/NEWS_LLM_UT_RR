    "text": "BAGHDAD, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A Shiite militia in Iraq on Thursday claimed responsibility for launching joint missile attacks with Yemen's Houthi group on a site in the Haifa port in northern Israel.\nThe militia, known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, said in an online statement that its fighters carried out a joint operation with the Houthi group by launching missile attacks on \"a vital site in Haifa.\"\nIt said the attacks were carried out \"in solidarity with the people in the Gaza Strip,\" vowing to continue to target \"the enemy's strongholds.\"\nEarlier in the day, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea announced in a televised statement that the group had conducted \"a joint operation with the Islamic Resistance in brotherly Iraq that targeted a vital target in Haifa with several cruise missiles,\" noting that \"the operation achieved its goal successfully.\"\nSince the outbreak of the Gaza conflict on Oct. 7, 2023, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has launched multiple attacks on Israeli targets and U.S. bases in the region. â– ",

    "text": "Commentary\nTrump Takes Hilariously Vicious Shot at Biden Day Before Debate: 'Ask Your Doctor About BIDENICA'\nTrump has an incredible sense of humor. This is especially true when applied to the lunacy of Biden and the Biden administration.\nOur nation has been driven to shambles. Americans see it and feel it. Biden is no confidence-building leader. Why mince words when the obvious is so blatant?\nSo it isn’t any surprise that the night before the first 2024 presidential debate, Trump would publicly share a facetious video emphasizing just how uninspiring and sleep-inducing\nBiden is. He shared it on his Truth Social platform.\n“BIDENICA” is the name Trump gives to the coma-type rest induced by listening to Biden’s blathering. His presentation is that of a new type of drug to fight insomnia.\nNo doubt, it is the insomnia all of the lying Biden, his entire team, and his many partners have been doing to defend his presidency to Americans who know the real score based on experience alone. His failed policies are sinking the United States and any future we wish to have.\nTrump captures the people’s reality in the following way, ““If you’re having trouble sleeping, ask your doctor about BIDENICA….”\n“If you’re having trouble sleeping, ask your doctor about Bidenica, the sleep aid made from 100 percent Joe Biden press conference.\nDescribing Bidenica as being “made from 100% Joe Biden Press Conference,” the rest of the “ad” blasted a bevy of Biden gaffes, including the infamous “Corn Pop,” before ending with a snarky: “Ask you doctor if Bidenica is right for you.”\nThe video ends with lots of snoring.\nNot only does the witty attack directly and indirectly point out Biden’s many failures during his term in the White House, it uses them as a basis to emphasize his overall physical and cognitive decline. It shows at a baseline, once again, how unfit he is to take up the helm for a second term.\nIf you look a bit deeper into the video, as well, you also see how Trump seemingly refers to the unscrupulous nature of those actually directing Biden to do their dirty work for them. It is subliminal and masterful.\nMost likely, the establishment media will undoubtedly either disregard or position the video as a crude and unpresidential attack on their candidate. Every Conservative and Trump voter will recognize the pure genius of it in delivery, timing, and truth.\nBoth candidates may be close in age. One, without question, can hardly string two sentences together.\nThe other created a video about it… a video that evokes laughter. These are not the same men.\nThe salvo that Trump launched has\nskewered the current president. This, as Trump’s favorability continues to rise while Biden’s falls according to the most recent Gallup poll. This, despite all of the persecution unfairly thrust upon Trump.\nWhere Trump gained 4 points since from December, Biden lost 4 points. In addition,\nThe Hill cited that “Other new findings from Gallup included 46 percent of Americans surveyed saying Trump ‘has the personality and leadership qualities a president should have,’ compared to 38 percent who said the same for Biden.”\nThe first presidential debate is tonight, on\nCNN.\nIt is obvious\nTrump is rearing to go given this prelude. Biden better drink a copious amount of the funny juice ahead of the game, if for nothing else, to substantiate Trump’s comedic dig is simply that.\nThose who want to sleep through it, try some Bidenica.\nTruth and Accuracy\nWe are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.\n Read our editorial standards.",

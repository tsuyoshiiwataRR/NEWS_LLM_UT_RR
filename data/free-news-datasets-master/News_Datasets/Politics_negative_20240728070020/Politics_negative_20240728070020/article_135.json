    "text": "In short: The ACT government will introduce a licensing scheme to regulate property developers. It says the law will better protect property buyers. What's next? The move has been cautiously welcomed by property owners who have experienced defects. The ACT will become the first jurisdiction in Australia to introduce a licensing scheme to regulate property developers, following the passage of a new law.\nThe change means developers will need to apply for a licence before construction begins on new developments, though there will be a transition period of 12 months while a code of conduct is developed.\nACT Construction Minister Rebecca Vassarotti said the law would better protect consumers making significant financial commitments to buy property.\n\"We have seen far too many experiences of home owners being left out in the cold when things have gone wrong,\" Ms Vassarotti said.\n\"[Developers] have a lot of control, but up until now they have not been part of the accountability chain.\"\nHopes laws will protect buyers Soon after moving into his unit, Shane Hutchinson started noticing water ingress and other defects.\nThe move has been cautiously welcomed by property owners who have experienced defects.\nShane Hutchison bought an apartment in a new building three years ago.\nSoon after, he began to notice issues including water ingress during heavy rain, shattered glass, blocked drains, and other security problems.\nMr Hutchison said the expiration of a two-year general warranty on the building's common areas meant the cost of the repair work was left to the owners' committee, which he chairs.\n\"I feel particularly bad for the residents who moved in under the understanding that they would be paying [a certain amount] in fees per year, and that's effectively been doubled,\" he said.\n\"There are simply things missing or being faulty within the building that we just need to rectify.\"\nShane Hutchinson noticed issues at his property and hopes other buyers can avoid a similar experience.\nDevelopers should have 'nothing to fear': government Under the new law, developers will also be held personally liable for up to 10 years if they do not fix defects in homes they have developed.\nThe Property Council of Australia said it supported more scrutiny on the sector to improve consumer confidence, but described the ACT law as an overreach.\nThe council's ACT executive director, Gino Luglietti, said the law \"makes developers liable for everything, including things out of their control\".\nMr Luglietti said profit margins in residential construction were already tight, and this could discourage investment in the sector.\n\"Developers will either have to insure everything under the sun … which will only push up costs for the consumer, or they'll get out of the game altogether,\" he said.\nRebecca Vassarotti says the new laws will tackle problems like defects and compliance failures in residential property developments. ( ABC News: Ian Cutmore )\nMs Vassarotti said the personal liability measure was designed to deter company directors from \"phoenixing\" — where a business owner winds up their company only to start a new one soon after.\n\"For developers that are committed to actually building quality buildings and fixing any problems, they should have nothing to fear,\" she said.\nMr Hutchison said he thought the measure could be a deterrent against companies acting in bad faith, but he hoped there would be enough detail to support owners' committees if issues emerged.\n\"I'd rather see us all work together, rather than a carrot and stick approach,\" he said.\nPosted 1h ago 1 hours ago Thu 27 Jun 2024 at 8:34pm , updated 15m ago 15 minutes ago Thu 27 Jun 2024 at 10:08pm Share\nCopy link\nFacebook\nX (formerly Twitter)\nRelated Stories Najam's home keeps him awake at night — he says new laws won't fix it Government defends building regulation after new revelations about Elara Apartments How a Canberra developer dodged a $20 million defect bill",

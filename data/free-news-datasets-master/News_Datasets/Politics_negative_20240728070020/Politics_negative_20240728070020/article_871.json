    "text": "Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) fired back at Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee after one claimed that former President Donald\nTrump stored classified documents in a \"safe manner\" in a Mar-a-Lago bathroom.\n\"I can't let go that one of my Republican colleagues just stated that the boxes containing national security secrets that were seized at Mar-a-Lago were stored in a safe manner,\"\nSwalwell said at a Thursday hearing. \"Quote, stored in a safe manner.\"\nSwalwell then shared a poster-sized photograph of boxes of documents in a Mar-a-Lago bathroom.\n\"This is the bathroom at Mar-a-Lago with over a dozen boxes of national security secrets that were 'stored in a safe manner,'\" the lawmaker explained. \"My friends, you are living on Fantasy Island. That's where cults live, so that makes sense.\"\nALSO READ:\nAttention Lincoln and Reagan: GOP senators scramble history with Trump greatness claim\nHe noted that Trump's bathroom was \"a mess.\"\n\"This committee has been a mess, and this Congress is a mess,\" he added. \"This is not stored in a safe manner. It's delusional to say that.\"",

    "text": "Abia State Government has revealed that it has observed the activities of some civil and public servants who are engaging in age falsification with court affidavits.\nAbia state Head of Service, Mrs Ngozi Obioma, in a statement on Thursday, said some civil and public servants also approach the National Population Commission (NPC) to obtain fake Date of Birth (DoB) certificates.\nShe noted with dismay that the fraudulent officials use the affidavits and NPC certificates to quote the age that suit them thereby falsifying their ages.\nMrs Obioma, who warned those indulging in such fraudulent acts to desist forthwith, said that any one caught in the act would be summarily dismissed from the Service and also prosecuted.\nThe state government had, in 2023, launched a verification exercise in the civil and public service aimed at strengthening the Service and also flushing out ghost workers.\nIt also directed civil servants in the state to upload their credentials online, on a government approved portal.",

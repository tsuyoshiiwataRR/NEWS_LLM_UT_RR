    "text": "Watch: GOP rep silenced by Buttigieg during testy EV hearing\nMedia\nWhen US Rep. Aaron Bean (R-FL) questioned Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg during a congressional hearing on electric vehicles Thursday, the Sunshine State lawmaker was left stumped.\n\"Is there a time that you will say, 'You know what? This is too expensive. We want to rethink this policy,\" Bean asked Buttigieg. \"Is there ever a time that you're going to say that — that this is too expensive?\"\nThe Biden administration official replied, \"If you think this is expensive, wait until you find out how much oil and gas subsidies you've been supporting. Also, wait until you find out the economic impact that some economists have put at $15 million every hour, or every day — trillions of dollars every year — from allowing the environmental conditions in this country and planet to worsen.\"\nREAD MORE:\nWatch: Buttigieg dismantles MAGA lawmaker’s 'factually incorrect' claims at EV hearing\nThe exchange between the pair came shortly after Buttigieg\n issued a thorough fact-check to US Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) after the MAGA congressman characterized the Biden administration's electric vehicle policies as \"dictatorial.\"\nIn an April op-ed published by POLITICO Magazine titled \"Why Republicans Will Regret Their Crusade Against Electric Cars,\" veteran Republican consultant Mike Murphy\nwrote, \"Why such Republican hostility toward electric cars? It’s tribal. In our modern politics any friend of my enemy must be my enemy too. If Joe Biden is for EVs, we must be against them. GOP politicians looking for cheap applause cannot help but pile on and amplify one of the latest turns in the culture war.\"\nWatch the video below or\nat this link.\nREAD MORE:\nButtigieg on Martha-Ann Alito: Flags symbolizing love vs. insurrection are different Buttigieg schools Fox News reporter upset Biden is 'shoving' EVs 'down consumers’ throats' › Buttigieg: 'Major and protracted supply chain issues' expected after bridge collapse › Republicans propose $1 salary for Pete Buttigieg: report ›",

    "text": "In the lead-up to the presidential debate on Thursday, President Joe Biden's campaign has launched an offensive against Project 2025, a comprehensive policy and staffing blueprint developed by allies of former President Donald Trump. This initiative, assembled by the Heritage Foundation along with other conservative groups, outlines a significant restructuring of the government if a new Republican administration takes office. The Biden campaign's newly unveiled website critiques Project 2025, associating it directly with Trump. It claims the plan would \"gut democratic checks and balances, and consolidate power in the Oval Office.\" The campaign argues that although Project 2025 is not Trump's official platform—his campaign refers instead to Agenda47, which emphasizes reducing immigration and promoting economic growth—it still raises alarm among Democrats about the potential implications of a second term for Trump. \"Project 2025 is the plan by Donald Trump’s MAGA Republican allies to give Trump more power over your daily life, gut democratic checks and balances, and consolidate power in the Oval Office if he wins. Trump’s campaign advisors and close allies wrote it – and are doing everything they can to elect him so he can execute their playbook immediately,\" the Campaign website says. According to a report by The New York Times, back in 2016, conservative policy organizations were largely unprepared for Trump’s unexpected victory. Learning from that experience, these groups began preparing Project 2025 in 2022. The result is a 920-page document that proposes a radical transformation of the executive branch. Project 2025 outlines four main objectives: restoring the family as a cornerstone of American life, dismantling the administrative state, defending national sovereignty and borders, and securing individual rights to live freely as granted by God. Additionally, it controversially proposes placing all federal bureaucracy under direct presidential control and increasing funding for the US-Mexico border wall, a key element of Trump's 2016 campaign. The Biden campaign's website urges Americans to review the full 920-page Project 2025 report themselves, suggesting that the transparency of the document allows for a clear understanding of the intended governmental overhaul. It claims that Trump is running a campaign of “revenge” and “retribution,” asserting that “he and his MAGA allies will use the office of the presidency to turn his dark dreams into reality.” The Biden campaign aims to capitalize on the momentum of attacking Project 2025, which gained traction earlier this month. A campaign official told Axios that they are launching multiple digital and physical advertisements across Atlanta to direct voters to the site.",

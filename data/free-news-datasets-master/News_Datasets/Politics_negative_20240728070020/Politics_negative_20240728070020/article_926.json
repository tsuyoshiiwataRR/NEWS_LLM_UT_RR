    "text": "By GB News Videos ,\n54 minutes ago\nPrince Harry is \"trying to go at it alone\" and is \"not trying to become a working royal\" again, GB News royal correspondent Cameron Walker has claimed.The Duke of Sussex dramatically quit his role as a working royal in January 2020 and moved the US with his wife Meghan Markle.The pair have since launched scathing attacks on life in the Royal Family in the form of interviews and Harry's memoir titled Spare.However, recently the pair seem to be taking part in events that would usually be seen as royal duties such as their recent tour of Nigeria and Harry's work with a children's charity.Speaking on GB News today host Tom Hardwood asked GB News royal correspondent Cameron Walker: \"Because we've seen some senior royals step back, three senior Royals, one in hospital, two regularly visiting for treatment.\"Do you think that's encouraged Prince Harry to take on that perhaps more responsible role that you were talking about?\"Walker explained: \"I don't think it's to do with we're losing members of the Royal Family temporarily, such as the Princess of Wales and Princess Anne.\"I think he's trying to go it alone. I don't think this is him trying to become a working member of the Royal Family again.\"I think he is pretty happy in California from the messages we are getting from him, but clearly it is a huge frustration.\"I think perhaps for those royal watchers and those royal fans who think what could have been if he stayed as a working member and how much he could have perhaps helped.\"READ THE FULL STORY HERE",

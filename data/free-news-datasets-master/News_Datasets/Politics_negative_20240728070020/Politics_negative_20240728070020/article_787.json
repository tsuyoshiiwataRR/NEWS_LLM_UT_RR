Kristi Noem is defending her decision to avoid sending troops to flood-ravaged areas in South Dakota, saying that it would be extremely expensive and that the Guard should only be used for a very crisis situation. Meanwhile, her spokesman left open the possibility that the Guard may still be utilized. The South Dakota Democratic Party is urging Noem to deploy the Guard to help with relief efforts after the past weeks record rainfall and flooding. While the governors decisions to send National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border may have been intended as a political statement, it is imperative that our states resources are directed toward addressing the immediate and pressing needs of our residents, the party said Thursday in a news release. Gov. Kristi Noem speaks during a June 25, 2024, press conference in Yankton while state Department of Public Safety Secretary Bob Perry looks on.

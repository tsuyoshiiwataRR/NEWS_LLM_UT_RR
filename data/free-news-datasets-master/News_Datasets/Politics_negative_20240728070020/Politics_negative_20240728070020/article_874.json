    "text": "Donald\nTrump previewed one of his likely attacks on President Joe Biden with a vicious smear against immigrants.\nThe former president has made his opposition to immigration the cornerstone of his political rise, and has highlighted several unrelated homicides allegedly carried out by undocumented migrants to blame Biden for the slayings — which he's\nexpected to do in Thursday's presidential debate.\n\"Biden’s policies are a NIGHTMARE FOR WOMEN when it comes to the Border and Immigration!\" Trump\nposted hours before the debate is scheduled to begin.\nThe former president, who has been found liable for sexual abuse and boasted in a recorded conversation that he gets away with molesting women, launched his first presidential campaign by slandering Mexican immigrants as rapists.\n\"The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems,\"\nTrump said in his first campaign speech nine years ago. \"Thank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.\"\nALSO READ:\nWhat Donald Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his debate strategy\nTrump was penalized earlier this year by $88.3 million after a jury found him\nliable for sexually abusing author E. Jean Carroll and then defaming her, and a judge in another case found him liable for fraud and penalized him $355 million for habitually lying about his wealth on financial statements he used to secure loans and make deals.\n“The finding that Ms. Carroll failed to prove that she was ‘raped’ within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‘raped’ her as many people commonly understand the word ‘rape,’\"\nwrote judge Lewis Kaplan after the jury's verdict. \"Indeed, as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.”\nThe presumptive Republican nominee was found guilty last month on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film actress to prevent voters from learning of their affair, in an apparent violation of campaign finance laws.\nTrump's comments to former \"Access Hollywood\" host Billy Bush about grabbing women by the genitals were used as evidence in both the Carroll trial and his criminal trial.\nHe has also been indicted on felony charges in two federal cases involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss and his mishandling of classified documents, and he also faces felony charges in a Georgia racketeering case related to his post-election activity.",

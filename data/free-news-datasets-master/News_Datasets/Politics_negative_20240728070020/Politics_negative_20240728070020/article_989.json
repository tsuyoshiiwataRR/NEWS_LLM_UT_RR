Both sides see Chasiv Yar as a potential staging point for Russia to advance on the key cities of the eastern Donetsk region, including Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.\nNazar Voloshyn, a spokesman for Ukraine’s southern group of forces, told the Ukrinform news agency that Russian forces had moved out of Chasiv Yar’s “Kanal” district along the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas canal that runs along the town’s eastern edge.\n“Ukrainian defenders have indeed squeezed Russian forces out of the Kanal district in Chasiv Yar in Donetsk region,” Ukrinform quoted Voloshyn as saying. “The enemy army is no longer there.”\nVoloshyn told other Ukrainian media outlets that Russian troops were shelling Kyiv’s forces in more than 200 incidents over 24 hours, mostly on the town’s southern approaches.\nThe Ukrainian military’s General Staff, in a late evening report on Thursday, said Russian troops had tried to push back Ukrainian forces six times near Chasiv Yar. Three attacks were repelled and fighting still gripped the area.\nUkraine’s embassy in Washington posted a plea on social media platform X to stop Russia’s advance on Chasiv Yar, saying Russia was “desperately trying to wipe out the town targeting even damaged churches and civilian residential blocks of flats.\n“We must prevent Russia from turning it into a ghost city before it’s too late.”\nA dispatch by Russia’s Tass news agency quoted the commander of a Russian brigade, Stanislav Orlov, as saying his forces had destroyed a communications tower on the town’s highest point.\n“This allowed for a breakthrough to be made without losses,” the dispatch quoted him as saying.\nUkraine has long anticipated a Russian advance on the town.\nIts top commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said last month that Moscow’s forces had hoped to capture Chasiv Yar in time for May 9 ceremonies marking the anniversary of the Soviet victory in World War Two.",

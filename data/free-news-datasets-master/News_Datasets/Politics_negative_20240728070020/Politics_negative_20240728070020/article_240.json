    "text": "Commentary\nBrilliant Reversal of 2020 Debates Leaves Biden in a Tough Spot\nThe tables are turning on President Joe Biden and the rest of the Democrats on Thursday night.\nDuring the CNN-hosted presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and Biden, it looks like the forces of so-called “fact-checking” will finally be levied in the right’s favor for a change.\nAccording to the\nWashington Examiner, Trump’s campaign launched an aptly titled fact-checking endeavor — factcheckbiden.com — the morning just ahead of Thursday’s debate.\nThe site contains an email sign-up along with the promise of regular updates fact-checking Biden’s claims during the event.\nArchived links to the webpage indicate it was once an RNC portal that has since been updated and repurposed for tonight’s presidential face-off.\n“Biden has been doing political debates for 50 years, having taken part in at least 40 debates since 1972. His performances are often filled with lies – about himself, about statistics, about his record, and about events that never took place,” text on\nthe site reads.\n“We are holding Joe Biden accountable for his long track record of lying. Sign up to get these updates sent straight to your inbox.”\nNumerous fact checks in all sorts of different categories already exist at the bottom of the web page and each one of them is a beauty to behold.\nWhen it comes to the sitting president, there are certainly no shortage of topics and lies to fact-check.\nThe titles of those fact checks include “Biden Did Not ‘Create’ 15 Million Jobs,” “True! Years Of ‘Chaos’ At The Border Under Biden,” “This Is Biden’s Inflation,” “Costs Are Not ‘Lower’ Under Biden” and “Biden Can’t Deny He Met With Hunter’s Business Partners.”\nThis is quite a flip from the\n2020 debates, showing that Team Trump may have picked up a trick or two from their adversaries.\nBack then, it was Trump facing a constant barrage of left-leaning media fact-checks.\nCNN certainly didn’t hold back in issuing many of its own checks back in 2020.\nThe outlet even published an\narticle at the time titled “Fact check: Toned-down Trump continues his onslaught of falsehoods.”\nLooking at them all makes one wonder what the world would be like if the establishment news media actually did its job.\nOne thing would certainly be different — there’s no way Joe Biden would have been able to win the presidency.\nFor those interested in hearing Biden lie about all of these different topics in real-time, the CNN presidential debate is set to take place Thursday night.\nTruth and Accuracy\nWe are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.\n Read our editorial standards.",

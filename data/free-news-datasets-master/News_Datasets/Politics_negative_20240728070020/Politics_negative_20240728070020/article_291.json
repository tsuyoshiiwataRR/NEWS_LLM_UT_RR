Hmmm... what would that look like? You shall have no other gods before me. Mango Mussolini doesn't worship anyone but himself. Can't be posted. You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. I'm remembering that obnoxious painting in Lard-A-Mango with Twitler in a tennis sweater. That's 0 for 2. You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name. Combover Castro has repeatedly said \"god damn it\" in rallies. 0 for 3. Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. He's a con man every day of the week. 0 for 4. Honor your father and your mother He cheated siblings out of money their father had willed to them. 0 for 5. You shall not kill. He bragged about having various terrorists killed as President. 0 for 6. You shall not commit adultery. This is the easiest one. Trump has never not cheated on a spouse. 0 for 7. You shall not steal. Lots of contractors he's refused to pay who are willing to talk about this one. 0 for 8. You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor. Happens at every rally. When does he ever give true testimony? 0 for 9. You shall not covet your neighbors house. You shall not covet your neighbors wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor. Let's not kid ourselves: he's made a lifestyle of covetousness. 0 for 10. So there's the solution: we'd be happy to post any of the commandments that Trump hasn't broken in any classroom you like.

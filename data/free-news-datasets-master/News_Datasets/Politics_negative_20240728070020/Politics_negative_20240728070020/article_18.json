    "text": "A known violent offender in Colorado Springs was arrested Wednesday afternoon as part of a special investigation into local offenders with ties to gang firearms offenses. According to the Colorado Springs Police Department, detectives with the department's Strategic Investigations Unit initiated an investigation into several known, violent criminals in Colorado Springs, all of which had connections to local gangs for firearm-related offenses. Through this investigation, detectives identified 22-year-old Ramon Garcia â€” an offender prohibited from owning a firearm to any degree due to a violent felony conviction, police said. Through investigative efforts, detectives learned Garcia had multiple firearms, had been providing firearms to juveniles, and carried a history of eluding law enforcement. On Wednesday, police followed Garcia to the 7700 block of Penway Heights. The department's Tactical Enforcement Unit contacted him after seeing him walk to his car alongside a 17-year-old juvenile. According to detectives, a handgun with a \"Glock switch,\" was discovered concealed on the body of the 17-year-old suspect. \"A Glock switch is an aftermarket device attached to a semi-automatic handgun, making the handgun capable of fully automatic fire,\" according to the department. Detectives later acquired a search warrant of Garcia's apartment where they discovered and seized an AR-style rifle and a 50-round drum-style handgun magazine. According to police, Garcia is facing charges of possession of a weapon by a previous offender, providing a handgun to a juvenile, and possessing a dangerous weapon, alongside additional firearm-related offenses. The juvenile offender, who will not be identified per Colorado state law, is also facing firearm-related charges.",

    "text": "The death toll, injuries, and disruption of business continued Thursday as protesters took to the streets of several towns to express their displeasure with President William Ruto’s government. The protesters said the president and his top officials should resign, adding that they had lost faith in his administration. Despite the heavy security deployment in several parts of the country and the [president’s decision](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001497718/ruto-forced-to-eat-humble-pie-as-gen-z-protests-escalate) to send the controversial Finance Bill 2024 back to Parliament, protesters took to the streets of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Kisii, Kakamega, Migori and Kisii towns. However, there was uneasy calm in Eldoret, the president’s hometown, which witnessed a trail of destruction during Tuesday’s protests. On Thursday, four people were nursing gunshot wounds in Migori while the death toll in Mombasa rose to three as police countered protests with brutal force. In Mombasa, protesters and activists found two bodies with bullet wounds at Coast General Mortuary. Muslim for Human Rights (Muhuri) Rapid Response Officer Francis Auma said he saw two unidentified bodies lying at the Coast General and Referral Hospital morgue. But Coast Regional Police Commander George Seda said no one had died in the region as a result of the protests. “Nobody has died in Mombasa from gunshots,” said Seda. Businesses remained closed as police engaged the protestors in running battles in Mombasa’s city centre. The demonstrations, which started at 10am, involved several groups that had split up. The first group was in the town centre and the other at Saba Saba which went up to Buxton. This group was tear gassed after the demo turned violent at Buxton. Before the group in the town centre started the march, they gathered at Uhuru Garden along Moi Avenue, moved to the roundabout and to Likoni ferry, and followed Digo Road before going to Mwembe Tayari. They later returned the Mwembe Tayari to Treasury Square and were blocked from proceeding to the State Lodge on Mama Ngina Drive. In Migori, six people, among them two police officers, were injured as protesters engaged police in running battles. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter Director for Medical Services Dr. Dan Ochiel said the injured police officers had been treated and discharged. “We have received six patients from the demonstrations where four have gunshot wounds. Two police officers were hit with stones on the leg and face,” Dr. Ochiel said. Two of the injured civilians were treated and discharged while two were taken to theatre for surgery. Protestors who came out in large numbers engaged protestors in running battles as they threw stones at the law enforcers. They blocked the Migori-Rongo highway with rocks and lit bonfires. Police officers lobbed teargas canisters at the protesters in a bid to stop the demos that started as early as 5am. At some point, the police ran out of teargas canisters and fired at the protestors with live ammunition. Similar protests were witnessed in Homa Bay, Siaya, Busia and Kisii towns, where businesses were paralyzed for most of the day. In Kakamega, youths engaged police officers in a running battles in Amalemba and Shirere estates. The youths also protested against the death of two people who were allegedly shot by the police. The demonstrations commenced at Muliro Gardens and proceeded along the Kakamega-Webuye Highway to Masinde Muliro University, then returned to the Kakamega County headquarters, moved to the Kakamega County funeral parlor to view the bodies of the two demonstrators before engaging police in a running battles at Amalemba estate. Normalcy resumed in most towns in Rift Valley and the Mt Kenya region, amid anxiety and heavy security. Embu Town remained calm unlike Tuesday when there were violent protests that involved arson attacks on the county headquarters and UDA offices. On Thursday, there was heavy police deployment outside the County Governor’s office, which was vandalised and set on fire on Tuesday. Police officers in uniform and plain clothes patrolled the streets as others kept vigil at strategic places. More officers were also positioned outside shopping areas and the number of officers manned key government installations and businesses. In Nyeri Town, a peaceful gathering at Whispers Park took an unexpected turn when police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. Most businesses in the town remained closed while there was heavy police presence on most streets and residential areas. By afternoon, normalcy had been restored with a few traders opening their shops. In Murang’a, most supermarkets remained closed. In Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County, there was heavy deployment of armed security personnel at strategic points, particularly in areas where protesters gathered on Tuesday. And in the afternoon, a crowd poured into the streets singing cultural songs and denouncing protests in the town. Businesses resumed as usual with the majority of the businesses open. Public transport along the major roads was uninterrupted. “The president responded well to the issues raised by the protesters and as residents of Eldoret, we stand with him,” said Benjamin Leting, a resident. In Kisumu, residents accused the police of looting goods, including fish from traders. This came hours after protesters had marched to State Lodge but did not gain entry. They engaged police officers in running battles for several hours.

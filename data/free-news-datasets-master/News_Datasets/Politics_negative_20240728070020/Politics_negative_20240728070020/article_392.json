    "text": "SUGAR LAND, Texas – Fort Bend ISD says they have been informed by the Texas Education Agency (TEA) that they are under investigation.\nThe district said the TEA said the investigation is over complaints the district unlawfully incentivized students and staff to vote in the 2023 voter-approved tax rate election (VATRE) .\nRecommended Videos\nDecision 2023: Voters in favor of Fort Bend ISD’s tax rate proposal The proposition was approved by voters in the district. 57% were in favor of the proposal while 43% of voters cast their ballots against the measure.\n“The approval of Proposition A allows the district to receive $35 million annually through local tax revenues plus state funding to provide competitive salaries for teachers, nurses, counselors, librarians, bus drivers, custodians and all other benefits-eligible staff members among FBISD’s 12,000 employees. Staff members will receive raises and retroactive pay on December 15, 2023,” a district press release from November 2023 stated.\nThe TEA is also investigating the district over a complaint that trustees violated the Texas Open Meetings Act when making employment decisions regarding the district’s former superintendent, Christie Whitbeck.\nWhitbeck abruptly retired and vacated her position as superintendent on December 11, 2023.\nBlue jeans at center of controversy involving Fort Bend ISD at the polls Whitbeck served the district for two years and received a contract extension and raise in July 2023. However, she reportedly offered teachers an opportunity to wear jeans in October if they voted in the November elections.\nWhitbeck admitted to KPRC 2 investigates, “We had some jeans incentives.”\nIn a December interview , Whitbeck said she was blindsided when she had a meeting with the president of the district board of trustees who reportedly gave her an ultimatum -- opt for a voluntary retirement agreement or be terminated.\nFort Bend ISD superintendent says she was given choice by board to either retire or be terminated “Why I would have had the board president meet with me and tell me that she said you can opt for a voluntary retirement agreement or we’re going to pursue termination. And I’m like, ‘Well, termination for what?’ And there really is no cause for termination.” Whitbeck explained in the interview.\nThe district’s current superintendent, Marc Smith , says the district will cooperate with the investigation.\n“The district will fully cooperate with TEA’s investigation,” Fort Bend ISD Superintendent Dr. Marc Smith said. “We are dedicated to being transparent and will provide all requested information.”\n“It is a new day in Fort Bend ISD with a new administration,” Fort Bend ISD Board President Kristin Tassin said. “Our board intends to work with Dr. Smith to ensure our district fully cooperates with the TEA and is transparent with our community.”\nStay informed with KPRC 2's Breaking News Alerts",

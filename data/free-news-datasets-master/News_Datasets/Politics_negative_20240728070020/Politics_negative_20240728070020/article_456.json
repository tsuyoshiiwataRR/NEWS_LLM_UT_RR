    "text": "Did the leader of France's National Rally party Marine Le Pen announce that she will save France from \"the New World Order\" and that \"Macron will be arrested\"? No, that's not true: The story came from a website known for producing false stories, and it was first published a year before the 2024 legislative election in France. The false story resurfaced in 2024 on social media. Neither Le Pen's resources nor any credible outlets reported that she ever said what was attributed to her in the viral claim.\nThe claim originated from\nan article (archived here) published by the People's Voice on July 3, 2023, under the title:\nMarine Le Pen: 'I Will Save France From the New World Order - Macron Will Be Arrested'\nIt continued:\nFrench presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen has issued a national address, vowing to save France from the 'New World Order' and hold President Macron criminally responsible for the anarchy currently taking place across the country.\nThis is what it looked like at the time of writing:\n(Source: People's Voice screenshot taken on Thu Jun 27 14:04:21 2024 UTC)\nWhen French President Emmanuel Macron called a\nnew legislative election in France earlier in June 2024 (archived https://archive.is/eBXOQ), this People's Voice article, predating the voting by one year, started to be reshared again on social media; for example, this X post published on June 11, 2024 (archived https://archive.org/details/screenshot-2024-06-27-at-4.27.35-pm).\nLe Pen, the leader of France's National Rally party, did not say that in 2024, in 2023 or before that.\nThe video of Le Pen embedded in the People's Voice article was a\nFrench-language clip (archived https://archive.org/details/factcheck-francelepen-macron2) from her account on X that was posted in the summer of 2023, but it did not contain any proof confirming the claim: She commented on an unrelated event -- a series of riots after a 17-year-old teenager of Algerian-Moroccan descent was shot to death (archived https://archive.is/QCMwZ) by law enforcement that year.\nA broad search for the keywords from the purported statement seen\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=%22new+order%22+and+%22macron%22+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2Fmlp_officiel%3Flang%3Den&sca_esv=e2999e5afe90a665&sca_upv=1&source=hp&ei=TYF9Zuq5HuuiptQP95Cn6AY&iflsig=AL9hbdgAAAAAZn2PXZeJ3NT_aZBkqGfrYjWdY5GQaTuz&ved=0ahUKEwiqlIPyiPyGAxVrkYkEHXfICW0Q4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=%22new+order%22+and+%22macron%22+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2Fmlp_officiel%3Flang%3Den&gs_lp=Egdnd3Mtd2l6IkAibmV3IG9yZGVyIiBhbmQgIm1hY3JvbiIgc2l0ZTpodHRwczovL3guY29tL21scF9vZmZpY2llbD9sYW5nPWVuMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigAUjwblAAWLJlcAB4AJABAJgBrASgAbkjqgEMMTguNi4zLjIuMC4xuAEDyAEA-AEB-AECmAIdoAKcJMICCBAuGIAEGLEDwgIOEC4YgAQYsQMY0QMYxwHCAg4QABiABBixAxiDARiKBcICCxAuGIAEGNEDGMcBwgIFEC4YgATCAgsQABiABBixAxiDAcICBRAAGIAEwgIOEC4YgAQYxwEYjgUYrwHCAggQABiABBixA8ICERAuGIAEGLEDGNEDGIMBGMcBwgILEC4YgAQYxwEYrwHCAggQLhiABBjUAsICBxAAGIAEGArCAgYQABgWGB7CAgsQABiABBiGAxiKBcICBRAhGKsCmAMAkgcKMTcuNi4zLjEuMqAHsoQC&sclient=gws-wiz (archived https://archive.is/LHigt) across Le Pen's official account on X (archived https://archive.is/PzdeT) produced no matches.\nAs of this writing, her French-language campaign website accessed by Lead Stories via Chrome automated translation showed\nno announcement in question (archived https://archive.is/snP89).\nA more specific search for keywords seen\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=%22Le+Pen%22+and+%22macron%22+and+%22arrested%22+and+%22new+order%22+site%3Aeuronews.com&sca_esv=e2999e5afe90a665&sca_upv=1&ei=XIJ9Zv_pMu-v5NoPmJqn-AU&ved=0ahUKEwj_h7TzifyGAxXvF1kFHRjNCV8Q4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=%22Le+Pen%22+and+%22macron%22+and+%22arrested%22+and+%22new+order%22+site%3Aeuronews.com&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiRiJMZSBQZW4iIGFuZCAibWFjcm9uIiBhbmQgImFycmVzdGVkIiBhbmQgIm5ldyBvcmRlciIgc2l0ZTpldXJvbmV3cy5jb21I5iZQtgZYwyRwAXgAkAEAmAFVoAHRBKoBATm4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgCgAgCYAwCIBgGSBwCgB5UD&sclient=gws-wiz-serp (archived https://archive.is/3xfMN) across Euronews, which is a TV network predominantly focused on covering Europe, did not show any reporting backing up the claim.\nA\nGoogle search (archived https://archive.is/qHAeY) for the quote attributed to Le Pen in the title of the People's Voice article showed previous fact checks debunking the same claim and a post boosting it on 8kun (archived https://archive.org/details/screenshot-2024-06-27-at-11.07.28-am), a message board known to have been one of the primary ways of communication among QAnon followers.\nOn June 27, 2024, Le Pen did discuss Macron but did not call for his arrest or promise to \"save\" the country from \"the new world order\": As reported by\nLe Monde (archived https://archive.is/z389N) and Politico (archived https://archive.is/5dvGY), she made a comment suggesting that it's not the president but the prime minister who holds more power in making decisions on national defense and military assistance to other countries.\nThe same claim was previously reviewed by\nLogically and Reuters.\nAbout People's Voice\nThe People's Voice has a\nlengthy record of publishing false stories in the past. It describes itself as a resource \"comprised of various web pages operated by Fact Checked Limited,\" but it has nothing to do with fact checking.\nAs of this writing, its website contained a\nliability disclaimer, saying:\nFACT CHECKED LIMITED AND/OR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE SUITABILITY, RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, TIMELINESS, AND ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND RELATED GRAPHICS CONTAINED ON THE SITE FOR ANY PURPOSE.

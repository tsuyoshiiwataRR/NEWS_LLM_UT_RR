    "text": "Noem defends decision to not deploy National Guard during flooding\nGov. Kristi Noem’s office is defending her decision to not deploy the South Dakota National Guard during flood response efforts as state Democrats urge the governor to reconsider.\nNoem’s spokesperson Ian Fury sent a statement to media outlets Thursday saying some news reports tying the governor’s decision to deployment costs are unfair to the governor.\nNoem helped oversee the state’s response to widespread flooding across southeast South Dakota after\nrecord-setting rain late last week.\nDuring a media briefing the governor said deploying the National Guard is expensive. But Fury said cost wasn’t the deciding factor.\nNoem discussed her reasoning in\nTuesday's briefing, saying \"we have to be wise with how we use our soldiers.\"\n“In order for the National Guard to be activated the county has to request it, and I make a decision if it’s warranted, and if we should do that. We have not had to utilize the National Guard for this operation yet. That’s usually, typically, a crisis situation,\" Noem said. \"The National Guard is extremely expensive. And if you do activate the National Guard then the local county has to pay for it. They tend to be more expensive than using other resources or contractors, or things like that. That has not been necessary to this point, and I don’t expect we will have to.\"\nMy heart goes out to the families on McCook Lake whose homes were destroyed by this flooding. We’ll keep doing everything we can to help with the situation.— Kristi Noem (@KristiNoem)\nFor right now, safety dictates that the public stay out of the area unless escorted by public safety officials.

Liz Larson. \"We urge Gov. Noem to act swiftly and decisively in deploying these essential resources to where they are needed most - right here in South Dakota.\"",

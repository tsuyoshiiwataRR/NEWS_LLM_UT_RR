    "text": "OTTAWA – NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh suggested today that breaking up the federal and provincial arms of the party would be a mistake.\nSingh is reacting after newly elected Alberta NDP Opposition Leader Naheed Nenshi said he intends to ask provincial party members if they want to separate from the federal party.\nParty constitutions dictate that members of a provincial NDP are automatically members of the federal party.\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh asks a question during question period in House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Tuesday, June 18, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Nenshi says every day he hears members in Alberta expressing their desire to separate themselves from Singh, who is heavily criticized in the Prairies for propping up the Liberal government through their confidence-and-supply-agreement.\nSingh says he spoke with Nenshi following his win last weekend and told him the federal and Alberta NDP need to remain united in their goals to bring down conservatives.\nWinnipeg Free Press | Newsletter Business Weekly Monday mornings\nThe latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week.\nSign up for Business Weekly Sign Up I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies , and CASL agreement . He says the best way to achieve that goal is by being united, and that he made that very clear to Nenshi.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 27, 2024.",

    "text": "Several bills that were passed during the 2024 legislative session and signed into law by Gov. Jared Polis will take effect on July 1. Here are a few of the most significant pieces of legislation set to become effective in just a few days: [SB 131](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sB24-131): Prohibit Carrying Firearms in Sensitive Spaces This bill is one of the most contentious of the 2024 session. The bill prohibits the carrying of firearms, concealed or otherwise, in a number of locations considered \"sensitive spaces,\" including government buildings, child care centers, and public schools. In a recent interview with Colorado Politics, John Kellner, district attorney for the 18th Judicial District, said his concern with the new law is that the penalty for unlawfully carrying a gun onto school grounds was decreased in the bill's language. Kellner questions the \"tough on gun\" messaging when the new law will make carrying a gun on school grounds a lesser offense. Under SB 131, a violation of the law is considered a Class 1 misdemeanor. Before, Kellner, who is not running for reelection this year, said it was a felony to carry any weapon on school grounds, noting that now a person carrying a knife on school grounds will be penalized more heavily than someone caught with a gun. While the misdemeanor charge is one step down from the Class 6 felony the offense was before, it does change the penalties. Before, a person caught with a gun could face over a year in prison and up to $100,000 in fines. Under SB 131, someone caught carrying a gun on school grounds faces a shorter jail sentence and a maximum of $1,000 in fines. The bill was sponsored by Sens. Sonya Jaquez Lewis, D-Lafayette, Chris Hansen, D-Denver, and Reps. Kyle Brown, D-Louisville, and Mandy Lindsay, D-Aurora.

[HB 1007](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1007): Prohibit Residential Occupancy Limits This bill prohibits local governments from limiting the number of unrelated people who can live together in a single household, with several exceptions. Residential occupancy limits can still be enforced if they are necessary to uphold health and safety standards or to comply with local, federal, or political subdivision affordable housing guidelines. The bill was sponsored by Reps. Manny Rutinel, D-Commerce City, and Javier Mabrey, D-Denver, and Sens. Tony Exum, D-Denver, and Julie Gonzales, D-Denver.

[HB 1147](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1147): Candidate Election Deepfake Disclosures This bill regulates the use of deepfake images, videos, and audio in communications about candidates for elected office. It mandates that any manipulated media about a candidate must include a disclosure statement indicating that it has been altered. The bill was sponsored by Reps. Junie Joseph, D-Boulder, and Brianna Titone, D-Arvada, and Sens. Chris Hansen, D-Denver, and Janet Buckner, D-Aurora.

[HB 1081](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1081): Regulate Sale Transfer Sodium Nitrite This bill prohibits the sale and transfer of products containing sodium nitrite in concentrations greater than 10%. While sodium nitrite is commonly used as a food additive and preservative in small concentrations, highly concentrated forms of the compound have become an increasingly popular method of suicide in recent years. The bill was sponsored by Reps. Judy Amabile, D-Boulder, and Marc Catlin, R-Montrose, and Sens. Dylan Roberts, D-Frisco, and Byron Pelton, R-Sterling Read more about the bill [here](https://www.coloradopolitics.com/legislature/colorado-lawmakers-say-regulation-of-sodium-nitrite-sales-will-help-prevent-suicide/article_7df7adca-bbc0-11ee-954b-47c251423317.html). [HB 1150](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb24-1150): False Slates of Electors This bill classifies the creation of a false slate of electors, serving as an elector in a false slate, and conspiring to create or serve in such a slate as perjury and forgery, punishable by a fine of up to $10,000. The bill was introduced in response to the 2020 election, during which a group of false electors not officially designated by political parties signed certificates falsely claiming that Donald Trump had won in their states. The bill was sponsored by Reps. Lorena Garcia, D-Denver, and Jennifer Parenti, D-Erie, and Sen. Nick Hinrichsen, D-Denver.

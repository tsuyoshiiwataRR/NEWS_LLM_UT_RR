    "text": "Thunder Bay's mayor has issued a statement addressing what he describes as \"misinformed and incorrect\" statements he provided to media this week.\nIn a story published by The Chronicle-Journal on Wednesday, Ken Boshcoff is quoted as saying Thunder Bay has a Safe Supply designation, \"which means we are attracting hundreds of thousands of people in the summer and hundreds of people over the winter\" to get free drugs.\nBoshcoff also stated he's been pushed past his \"limits of tolerance.\"\nIn a letter sent to media on Thursday morning, Boshcoff addressed the comments.\n\"I know that it is frustrating and challenging for people in our community who run and operate businesses, and residents, to truly understand these complex issues,\" he stated. \"We know, like many, many other municipalities in Canada, that there are people experiencing homelessness, substance use, and mental health issues here.\"\n\"In the article I spoke about Thunder Bay being designated as a 'Safe Supply City'. We in fact do not have any designation for safer supply. Safer supply is a program that is run and operated by NorWest Community Health Centres and funded by Health Canada.\"\n\"There are special exemptions and requirements for a community to offer this program. It does not draw people to the community for \"safe free drugs\". It's a very small program with less than 25 clients, currently at capacity, receiving a prescription for safer supply with the oversight of health care providers.\"\nJuanita Lawson, CEO of NorWest Community Health Centres, said later Thursday the organization had spoken with Boshcoff about his comments, and hoped to present preliminary results of NorWest's safe supply program — which she said is funded until March — to city council.\nOverall, the social issues Thunder Bay is facing are very complex, she said.\nWATCH | Reaction to mayor's comments: Reaction to Thunder Bay mayor's comments on safer supply\n5 hours ago Duration 0:51 Thunder Bay's mayor, Ken Boshcoff made incorrect and inflammatory statements about safer supply programming in Thunder Bay. Juanita Lawson, CEO of NorWest Health Centres and Thunder Bay City Councillor, Brian Hamilton spoke to the media Thursday. \"I think, to be fair, there's a lot of opportunity to have critical conversations about what we need to do different in our community,\" Lawson said. \"I think that we accept that there was some misunderstanding and some frustration.\"\n\"But I do also think these are opportunities to actually have some conversations with our community, with our business owners, around what do we do? This is really hard, and it's really hard for family members who see their loved ones.\"\nLawson said NorWest's safe supply pilot project, which has been running since 2022, has been successful so far.\nProvince spends $2.7M on new mobile crisis response team in Thunder Bay, Ont. 'We've been where they've been': People with lived addiction experience key in aiding Thunder Bay's vulnerable \"For example, we had 22 per cent of our clients go into treatment,\" she said. \"We have clients who are saying that they are more engaged with their family, they feel connected and they feel supported and they feel more humane.\"\n\"And the other thing that they're talking about is they're having less overdoses, they're experiencing less fentanyl utilization. So we're seeing some really fantastic results of individuals who have the support that they need to have a better life.\"\nNorWest Community Health Centres, located on Simpson Street in Thunder Bay, runs a safe supply pilot program. (Marc Doucette/CBC) Lawson said there is still a lot of work to do in the community when it comes to social issues.\n\"I think that the people are concerned. We have a lot of polarization with regards to individuals who have had some significant trauma in their life,\" she said. \"And so I think it just sort of raises for us the need to continue to communicate, to work with community and really ask people to be empathetic.\"\n\"The individuals who are on this program are our citizens, They're from our community. And I think that's really important to remember that they are our people.\"\nMcKellar Coun. Brian Hamilton said he was \"a little bit taken aback\" by Boshcoff's initial comments.\n\"There were some inaccuracies in there that I think the mayor is looking at,\" he said.\nBut, Hamilton said, the city is \"in a bit of a storm.\"\n\"It requires a lot of patience, a lot of compassion and understanding,\" he said. \"We have to work on this together and we're not going to get anywhere without the cooperation of the very people that we're talking about.\"\nThunder Bay hospital launches anti-stigma campaign to better support patients with addictions \"So this has to be a full community effort, including residents of encampments, people living on the street,\" Hamilton said. \"We're all in this together. And this is this is truly one of those moments where it's a community-led response, but it's not us versus them.\"\nHamilton noted good things are happening, including the creation of more than 170 transitional beds in the city.\n\"We weren't talking about transitional, supportive housing only 10 years ago,\" he said. \"Now that is not only a buzzword, but that's the reality.\"\n\"It's important to remember too, that every day of frustration that that people are feeling, that businesses are feeling, — which is real and palpable — work is being done behind the scenes to bring more support, more transitional housing and to work on these hard-won solutions that are ultimately going to lead us into clear waters.\"",

    "text": "NEW DELHI: After the procedural formalities, turbulence looms over the new Parliament as opposition has decided to raise the issue of NEET scam and paper leaks in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on Friday, with indications that it is not ready for a compromise on the issue.Opposition will move an adjournment notice in Lok Sabha and is likely to move a notice for discussion under Rule 267 in RS on Friday. The demand carries the seed of serious confrontation on the very first day of substantive business in the 18th Lok Sabha. While the govt business has listed the start of discussion on \\\"motion of thanks\\\" to the President's joint address, INDIA bloc wants to start the Parliament session with a discussion on NEET-paper leaks.At a meeting of the opposition at the residence of Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge, the parties decided that NEET is a serious issue impacting the future of lakhs of youth, and it cannot be clubbed with debate on \\\"motion of thanks\\\". It is generally assumed that the opposition can raise its issues of concern in the debate on the President's address.Modi govt has in the past been averse to accepting adjournment notices, which has resulted in protests and walkouts. But it is feared that a refusal in the 18th Lok Sabha could invite unmanageable protests given the increased strength of the anti-BJP bloc after the elections - a point repeatedly made by opposition MPs.The meeting at Kharge's residence was attended by Rahul Gandhi, Sharad Pawar, KC Venugopal, Sanjay Raut, Priyanka Chaturvedi, NK Premachandran, Mahua Majhi, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Derek O'Brien, Arvind Sawant, Pramod Tiwari, Rajani Patil, Tiruchi Siva and Sanjay Singh, among others.On Monday, opposition will sit on a dharna in the Parliament premises to protest \\\"misuse of agencies\\\" to target opposition and arrest of chief ministers Hemant Soren and Arvind Kejriwal and three Bengal ministers.",

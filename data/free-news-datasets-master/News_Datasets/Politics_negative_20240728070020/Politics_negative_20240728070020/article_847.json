Reports are he declined to prep for a debate....telling me he is going to do his own agenda...he has a platform and is going to use it spewing his bat-shit crazy stuff... chaos is his friend. Be prepared... Heck....another thought.... He may \"accidentally\" expose our intelligence to the world in the debate.

Less ideal is if he acts adult and normal. I'll be so disappointed! Unfortunately I'm not sure how much of a rant or tantrum he can throw in 2-minute increments. Unless he just goes on raving with a dead mic. (3,186 posts) [moose65](/?com=profile&uid=153902) [birdographer (Reply #1)](#post1) Trump thinks he can do no wrong. To him, the way he always acts is adult and normal. He doesnt know how to act any other way.

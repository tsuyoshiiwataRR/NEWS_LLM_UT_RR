    "text": "There’s been plenty of time to reflect on Slipknot ‘s hiring of ex- Sepultura drummer Eloy Casagrande as their Jay Weinberg replacement and it seems like the overwhelming consensus is that he’s the perfect fit. The dude just smashes behind the kit, as evidenced by all of the insane performance videos that have been making the rounds online.\nWhile speaking with Revolver , vocalist Corey Taylor went into a little more detail about the selection process and how while most candidates opted to send videos to the band instead of meet in person, Casagrande was really the only one to step up to the plate.\n“I think we just kinda went, ‘You know what? Let’s just tell people.’ It was really as simple as that, you know? Eloy was the only one who was brave enough to get in the room with us. There were a handful of other people that we were looking at, and none of them wanted to jam with us. They just wanted to do their own thing and send it in — a very TikTok thing, you know? And we were like, ‘That’s not the way this works, dude.’\n“Eloy rearranged his schedule to come see us. He was so hungry to jam and just see what would happen that we were immediately impressed just by that alone. He didn’t get it right away — getting to know him was just as important as jamming with him — but by the time we made that decision, we were, like, ‘Let’s tell the world now. He’s earned it.’ Our audience is so used to us kind of keeping our cards close to our chest, but to me it was more refreshing to just kind of come out and go, ‘Yeah, he’s our dude.'”\nCould you fucking imagine getting a call from a major band like Slipknot and thinking “nah, I’ll just send in a video.” What?! You get selected by Slipknot as a potential candidate and you let an opportunity of a lifetime slip away like that?! Yikes.\nWell, I’d say it all turned out for the best. Weinberg’s jamming out with Suicidal Tendencies , ex- Suicidal Tendencies drummer Greyson Nekrutman is now playing with Sepultura, and Casagrande’s with Slipknot. Seems like a win-win-win situation for everyone.\nIf you’d like to catch Casagrande fucking tear it up on the drums with Slipknot live, then good news; there are plenty of live shows coming up throughout the rest of the year. The band’s celebrating the 25th anniversary of their debut album, so you have a real good chance to see them live at some point.

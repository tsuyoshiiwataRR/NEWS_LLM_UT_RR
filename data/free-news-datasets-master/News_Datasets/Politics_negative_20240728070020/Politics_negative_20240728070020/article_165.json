    "text": "Medvedev issues stark warning over asset seizures abroad - The seizure of government assets abroad can be considered a justified reason for declaring war, - said Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, referring to the situation related to Russian assets. The former President of Russia once again threatened the West. Many of the information provided by Russian state media or Kremlin officials is likely not true. Such reports may be part of the Russian Federation&#039;s information warfare. The International Legal Forum (SPBILF) continues in St Petersburg. Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia, spoke at the plenary session and said that &quot;the seizure of government assets abroad can be considered a justified reason for declaring war.&quot; Medvedev added that it can even become casus belli (Latin for reason for warâ€”editor&#039;s note), as in response, the state may have the right to individual and collective self-defence. Remember that on 6 June in the early morning, new sanctions imposed by the West on Russia came into effect. As a result, Russian companies have been practically cut off from easy access to euros and GBP. At least two Russian banks are struggling with serious problems, so clients cannot withdraw their deposited funds. Medvedev threatens again On Thursday, the former President of Russia once again announced that Russia &quot;will be forced to take retaliatory actions following the principle of reciprocity&quot;. Additionally, he reminded that Putin had already signed a decree on the seizure of American assets. Medvedev announced imminent legislative changes in the development of this document.

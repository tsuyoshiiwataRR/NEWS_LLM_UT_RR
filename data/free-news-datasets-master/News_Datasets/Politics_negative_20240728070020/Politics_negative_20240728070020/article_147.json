    "text": "(CTN News) – Thaksin Shinawatra , the former prime minister, has launched a defamation action against Warong Dechgitvigrom, the head of the Thai Pakdee Party, accusing him of paying a bribe to be released on bail in a lese majeste case.\nThaksin’s attorney, Winyat Chartmontree, filed a lawsuit against Warong, seeking 100 million baht in damages.\nWarong, a long-time Thaksin Shinawatra critic, gave a public statement and posted on social media , saying that 2 billion baht was paid to judicial officials in exchange for release on bail in the lese majeste case.\nThaksin Shinawatra Granted Release on 500,000 Baht Bond Thaksin was granted release on a 500,000 baht bond last week and told not to leave the country without court authorization after pleading innocent to charges of defaming King Rama IX in a 2015 interview with South Korean media.\nWinyat stated that, while Warong did not identify Thaksin Shinawatra by name in his speech or post, he did include a hashtag with Thaksin’s name as well as the date Thaksin must appear in court, allowing readers to connect Thaksin to the allegations.\nWinyat further stated that he was investigating the fact that Warong mentioned the specific aircraft and automobiles utilized by Thaksin Shinawatra to violate the Personal Data Protection Act.\n“I have requested Mr Warong to provide proof as to where he received the data. “If it turns out that it came from state officials, there will be legal consequences,” he warned.\nThe Criminal Court has scheduled the case’s preliminary hearing for September 30.\nPost Disclaimer\nThe above article is sponsored content any opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and not necessarily reflect the views of CTN News- Chiang Rai Times.

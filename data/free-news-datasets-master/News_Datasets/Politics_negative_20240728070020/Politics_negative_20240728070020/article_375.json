You can find them here:\nForbes Today's NYT 'Strands' Hint, Spangram And Answers For Thursday, June 27 By Kris Holt Hey, folks! I hope you’ve had a tremendous week. The weekend is close enough to taste, isn’t it?\nToday’s NYT Strands hints, spangram and answers are coming right up.\nHow To Play Strands The New York Times’ Strands puzzle is a play on the classic word search. It’s in beta for now, which means it’ll only stick around if enough people play it every day.\nThere’s a new game of Strands to play every day. The game will present you with a six by eight grid of letters. The aim is to find a group of words that have something in common, and you’ll get a clue as to what that theme is. When you find a theme word, it will remain highlighted in blue.\nYou’ll also need to find a special word called a spangram. This tells you what the words have in common. The spangram links at least two sides of the board, but it may not start or end there. While the theme words will not be a proper name, the spangram can be a proper name. When you find the spangram, it will remain highlighted in yellow.\nMORE FOR YOU Biden Vs.

You can connect letters vertically, horizontally and diagonally, and it’s possible to switch directions in the middle of a word. If you’re playing on a touchscreen, double tap the last letter to submit your guess.\nIf you find three valid words of at least four letters that are not part of the theme, you’ll unlock the Hint button. Clicking this will highlight the letters that make up one of the theme words.\nBe warned: You’ll need to be on your toes. Sometimes you’ll need to fill the missing word(s) in a phrase. On other days, the game may revolve around synonyms or homophones. The difficulty will vary from day to day, and the puzzle creators will try to surprise you sometimes.\nWhat Is Today’s Strands Hint? Scroll slowly! Just after the hint for today’s Strands puzzle, I’ll reveal what the answer words are.\nThe official theme hint for today’s Strand puzzle is...\nThat’s my jam!\nNeed some extra help? Here’s another hint...\nTypes of tunes\nThere are seven theme words to find today, including the spangram.\nWhat Are Today’s Strands Answers? Spoiler alert!

I’ll then tell you the other words and show you how they fit in.\nThis is your final warning!\nToday’s Strands spangram is...\nMUSIC GENRE\nHere’s where you’ll find it on the grid...\nThe rest of today’s Strands theme words are...\nSALSA SOUL BLUES JAZZ ROCK FOLK COUNTRY DISCO\nHere’s what the completed grid looks like...\nWithin seconds, I found BLUES, SALSA, SOUL and JAZZ in the top half of the grid.

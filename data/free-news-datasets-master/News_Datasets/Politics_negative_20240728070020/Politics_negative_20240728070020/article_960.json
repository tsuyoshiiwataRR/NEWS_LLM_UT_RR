    "text": "You&#039;ve really got to think about the business model and what has made TAMU and she and so successful as their approach where their director consumer. So in a lot of cases, you would have businesses that sort of act as intermediaries. I buy from the factory in China. I set up my site on Amazon and I sell with a slight premium on it. And that&#039;s how you make money out of it. Tamo and Sheen came in with this new approach. And so they would connecting factories directly to consumers. They were cutting out that middleman and they were offering cheaper prices. And off the back of that they gained so much market share. Now Amazon is coming in and they&#039;re saying, OK, we&#039;re going to follow that approach. We&#039;re going to trial that. They&#039;re starting it perhaps as soon as next week. It&#039;s still going to be. On the Amazon website, a part of it, it&#039;s open to invited sellers only, but certainly something to track and a new direction that Amazon is going in after we saw them actually cutting. Prices or fees for merchants selling clothes price below $20 earlier this year. They&#039;re clearly aware of the the threat that Sheehan and Tamil are posing.",

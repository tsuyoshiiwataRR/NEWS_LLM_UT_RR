    "text": "( NewsNation ) — Families of 9/11 victims involved in a lawsuit against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia wrote a letter to the Top Republican and Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, expressing frustration over stalled legislation.\nTerry Strada, national chair of 9/11 Families United, wrote in the letter to Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., that the group also has concerns over a lack of response from Congress to a video they say shows evidence that Saudi government officials were involved in planning the attacks on U.S. soil.\nThe video was obtained by the London Metropolitan Police, and then shared with the FBI, before being introduced as evidence in U.S. federal court.\nMissing woman Taylor Casey’s last phone ping was in water: Family Members of 9/11 Families United claim the video shows a Saudi intelligence official casing the U.S. Capitol around the same time al-Qaeda was planning the attacks.\n“Shockingly, the news that a Saudi intelligence agent surveilled the U.S. Capitol on behalf of al-Qaeda shortly before the worst terrorist attack in American history, including a thwarted attack on the Capitol building, has been met with radio silence on Capitol Hill,” Strada wrote. “It’s particularly shocking to witness the silence from your committee, where charges of the FBI withholding critical information from the American people have previously taken center stage regarding other issues.”\nEnsuring Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act Even worse though, Strada wrote, was the “same silence” 9/11 families were met with when they inquired about H.R. 4951, or the Ensuring Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act. This bill allows families of terrorist attack victims to seek financial compensation from foreign sponsors of terrorism. It has been stalled in the House Judiciary Committee, which is chaired by Jordan, who Strada said “personally assured her” he supported the bill.\nJordan’s office told NewsNation, which has also reached out to Nadler, that he had no comment.\n“You and your staff members explained to me that the removal from that markup calendar was simply a matter of insufficient time to consider it on that day,” Strada wrote. “Two months later, your Committee is holding another markup session tomorrow on unrelated matters, but for reasons we cannot understand, the EJVTA remains stalled.”",

    "text": "OTTAWA – A Liberal campaign co-chair insists his caucus is united behind Justin Trudeau, even as the majority of elected Liberals remain silent on the prime minister’s political future.\nThe Canadian Press contacted dozens of Liberal MPs following the unexpected loss of a Toronto stronghold in a byelection earlier this week, but only a small handful have been willing to speak on the record.\nAll of those, including Manitoba MP and campaign co-chair Terry Duguid, insist the caucus is united behind Trudeau.\nMP Terry Duguid stands during question period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Tuesday, March 29, 2022. Elected Liberals outside of Justin Trudeau's cabinet have largely remained silent about the prime minister's political future in the party, and those who want to see him step down won't say so publicly. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Those who want Trudeau to step down won’t say so publicly.\nDuguid admits many MPs are frustrated but adds those feelings stem from the struggle to connect with Canadians, not concerns about the prime minister.\nWinnipeg Free Press | Newsletter Business Weekly Monday mornings\nThe latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week.\nSign up for Business Weekly Sign Up I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies , and CASL agreement . While some regional caucuses have met since Monday, the full caucus isn’t scheduled to meet again until a retreat in British Columbia before the House of Commons returns in September.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 27, 2024.",

    "text": "Thousands of doctors in England are staging their 11th walkout on Thursday in a prolonged dispute with the government over pay and working conditions, causing disruptions in hospital services just before the U.K. general election. Junior doctors, who are early in their careers and form the core of hospital care, are striking for five days. They argue that their pay has declined by 25% over the past 15 years and are demanding a 35% pay increase. The strike highlights ongoing issues within the underfunded National Health Service (NHS), a major concern for voters ahead of the July 4 election.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA), representing the doctors, claims newly qualified doctors earn about 15 pounds ($19) an hour, slightly above the U.K. minimum wage. Dr. Sumi Manirajan from the BMA stated that many young doctors are leaving for better opportunities abroad, resulting in those who remain being overworked and underpaid. The government, having given pay raises of 8.1% to 10.3% last year, insists it cannot negotiate during the pre-election period, but the union continues to call for talks.\nThis ongoing dispute is emblematic of broader challenges faced by the NHS, as prolonged underinvestment has led to significant staffing issues and long waits for patients. The Labour Party, currently leading in polls, has engaged in discussions with the union, emphasizing the need for resolution to meet healthcare commitments.",

    "text": "A proposed bond measure to fill a funding shortfall for the ambitious Royal Theater renovation won’t appear on the Nov. 5 ballot, putting the project and a significant chunk of grant funding in jeopardy. The [Guadalupe City Council](https://cityofguadalupe.org/mayor-and-city-council/) voted 3-2 Tuesday night on the final step to place the a bond measure on the Nov. 5 ballot. The proposal needed four of the five members to vote in favor to keep the proposal alive. Mayor Ariston Julian and council members Gilbert Robles and Whitney Furness favored asking voters to approve a $3-million bond measure. Councilmembers Christina Hernandez and Eugene Costa Jr. voted no. “It does not pass,” a stunned Mayor Ariston Julian said. Tuesday’s vote followed the [council’s first step June 11 ](https://www.noozhawk.com/guadalupe-council-takes-step-toward-putting-theater-project-bond-measure-on-ballot/)to move toward placing a bond measure on the ballot in a 4-1 vote with Costa opposed. That now leaves Guadalupe leaders to scramble to save the project before a March 2025 deadline for spending one of the grants. The city has $10.5 million due to [state and federal grants announced in 2022](https://www.noozhawk.com/state_federal_grants_provide_boost_for_guadalupe_historic_theater_renovatio/) plus leftover redevelopment funds, but the proposed project has been estimated at $13 million. “It’s a huge accomplishment that the city can obtain almost $10 million worth of grant monies for a $13-million project. It’s a testament to their efforts and to the merit of the project itself,” said Steven Gortler, the city’s bond consultant. Along with renovating the historic theater at 848 Guadalupe St. (Highway 1), the project would add a three-story performing arts center, amphitheater and community plaza to create the Guadalupe Visual and Performing Arts Center. “The project is basically ready to go. We have all the pieces in place to start the bid process and get construction started except for this gap in funding,” Tom Brandeberry, the city’s Royal Theater project manager. If a bond measure had been approved by two-thirds of the voters, property owners would have started seeing the new tax in 2025. The measure would have added an average of $77 to property taxes each year for the more than 1,700 homeowners in Guadalupe. Specifically, it would range from adding $28 a year for a home with an assessed valuation of $100,000 to $112 for a single-family home with a $400,000 assessed value. The City Council needed to approve the proposed bond measure Tuesday night to meet Santa Barbara County’s deadline for getting on the ballot. The proposed bond measure has drawn mixed reactions in the community. “I’m asking you to let the residents of Guadalupe decide if they want to do this or not,” said Albert Nunez Jr. “Give our voices the vote.” Melanie Backer pointed out that by the time the city’s property owners pay off $2.9 million, it would involve another $2.6 million due to interest. “We’re paying a lot of interest,” she said. “For clarity’s sake, I think the public should know that. “I’m actually for the bond, but I was more for us a year ago trying to raise funds, donations from wealthy people,” she added. Many view the theater renovation project as transformative for the disadvantaged community of Guadalupe. “I feel like this is a real good opportunity to bridge the past and the future,” added Melissa Chavez. “I’m excited about the future…Ensuring that this building is intact and there for future generations is really important.” While the [city first talked months ago ](https://www.noozhawk.com/guadalupe-council-considers-bond-measure-to-close-funding-shortfall-for-royal-theater-renovation/)about asking voters to approve a bond measure this fall, they council only held a workshop to answer residents’ questions June 18. It’s not clear if the city will attempt a capital campaign to raise funds, or redesign the project, or undertake some combination that would allow them to complete the work in phases. “Guadalupe deserves this project, every bit of it, and I will do my best to find other options,” Brandeberry posted on social media after the meeting. “Hopefully, the option will not be just a renovated movie theatre.”",

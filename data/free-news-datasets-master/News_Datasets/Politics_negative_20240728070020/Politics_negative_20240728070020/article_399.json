    "text": "Taoiseach Simon Harris has condemned the bomb threat made to his home on Wednesday evening as he said ‘these things are done to intimidate [and] upset.’\nMembers of An Garda Síochána carried out a search on Mr Harris’ Wicklow home on Wednesday evening following a phone call made to the Samaritans.\nThe Taoiseach’s family were present at the time. It was determined to be a hoax.\nAn Taoiseach Simon Harris has condemned the bomb threat made to his home on Wednesday evening as he said ‘these things are done to intimidate [and] upset.’ Pic: Leah Farrell/ RollingNews.ie Reacting to the security alert in Brussels on Thursday morning, Mr Harris said he wasn’t sure if the word hoax was a ‘fair word’ to use to describe the incident.\n‘Obviously, this is a clearly unacceptable situation,’ the Taoiseach told reporters, ‘Even the word hoax, I’m not sure is a fair word, with respect because I’ve no doubt these things are done to intimidate; to upset.\n‘I have young children, I have a wife. This is an utterly acceptable situation.’\nNew: Taoiseach Simon Harris says his family do not plan to leave their home in Co Wicklow, despite a malicious bomb threat being made to the house last night. He describes the threat as “an utterly unacceptable situation”. @VirginMediaNews pic.twitter.com/IoiPwetoZR\n— Gavan Reilly (@gavreilly) June 27, 2024 Mr Harris shared his thoughts that the discourse surrounding these matters should be reflected on.\n‘If masked men turned up outside your house, it wouldn’t be described as protest,’ he explained, ‘It’s not protest when it happens outside my house either. This situation can’t be allowed to continue.’\nPrompted on whether he and his family were planning to move houses following the threats, Mr Harris insisted: ‘I’m staying in my home.’\nStephen Donnelly also condemned the threat, saying that it showed a ‘real radicalisation’ of people online. Pic: Sam Boal/RollingNews.ie Stephen Donnelly also condemned the threat, saying that it showed a ‘real radicalisation’ of people online.\nThe Minister of Health branded it ‘deeply sinister’ and said it was part of a growing pattern of threats against politicians.\nSpeaking on Newstalk, Mr Donnelly said: ‘There are many facets to this; I think one of the ones that is most important is the online discourse.\nPics: Simon Harris with wife and kids on family day out at Bord Bia Bloom ‘It’s horrific, it’s getting worse and just as worryingly there is a real radicalisation of people going on.’\nThe latest security alert on the Taoiseach’s home comes nearly two weeks after a group of masked people attended his home demanding him to ‘close the borders.’\nThe group covered their faces with scarves and face masks and carried Irish flags before Gardaí cleared them and warned them to stay off the private property.",

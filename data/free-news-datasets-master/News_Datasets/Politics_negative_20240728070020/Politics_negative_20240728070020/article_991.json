    "text": "Fox News Digital reached out to both President Biden’s campaign and former President Trump to ask if either candidate was on performance-enhancing drugs for the debate.\n“Donald Trump is so scared of being held accountable for his toxic agenda of attacking reproductive freedom and cutting Social Security that he and his allies are resorting to desperate, obviously false lies,” Biden campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt told Fox News Digital on Wednesday evening.\nFox followed up asking for a “yes” or “no” response, Hitt said her original statement answered the question.\n“The accusation from Trump on drugs is a ‘desperate, obviously false lie,'” Hitt added.\nMeanwhile, Trump’s national press secretary Karoline Leavitt was more than happy to provide an answer regarding the status of her boss, Donald Trump.\n“Absolutely not,” Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital.\nShe added, “President Trump has naturally elite stamina and doesn’t need performance-enhancing drugs, unlike Joe Biden, who many are saying will be drugged up for the debate like he was at the State of the Union. President Trump has repeatedly asked Joe Biden to participate in drug testing. What does Team Biden have to hide?”\nTake Our Poll: Which Joe Shows: Sleepy or Jacked-up? CLICK HERE",

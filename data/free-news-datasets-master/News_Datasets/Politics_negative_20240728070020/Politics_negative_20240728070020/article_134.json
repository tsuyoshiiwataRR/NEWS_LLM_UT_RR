    "text": "The region’s peak conservation body says it is “inappropriate” to continue promoting the Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park until its crucial environmental needs are addressed.\nNature Conservation Margaret River Region general manager Drew McKenzie made the remarks this week amid dismay at WA Environment Minister Reece Whitby’s apparent “disinterest” in his own portfolio.\nInstead, critics say the region’s “jewel in the crown” is being used as a marketing tool to boost the State’s tourism industry with scant regard for under-resourcing and the need for significant on-the-ground conservation work.\nMr McKenzie said the park deserved “best practice management” but was “being swamped” as WA’s most visited national park, had complicated issues around pedestrian and vehicle access and public toilets, and rampant weeds and feral animals.\n Despite growing tourism and rising resident numbers, pressure was being heaped on the LNNP, Mr McKenzie also said locals “treat it like their backyard rather than a national park that is an absolute privilege to have on their doorstep”.\nMr McKenzie’s comments follow a campaign by an alliance of local groups including the Shire of Augusta-Margaret River, the Margaret River-Busselton Tourism Association and others representing the wine and business sector as well as Aboriginal heritage interests.\nWhile Mr Whitby didn’t follow through on calls to boost ranger numbers and conservation work during the latest State Budget, hopes were still pinned on a brokered visit to the region.\nHowever, when pressed this week, MRBTA chair Stuart Hicks was unable to offer a timetable for the minister visit.\nA State Government spokesperson told the Times there was well-funded Aboriginal ranger program and they had a Plan for our Parks is focused on creating five million hectares of conservation estate outside of the region.\n“As it relates to Leeuwin Naturaliste National Park, the State Government is investing $2.7 million in the park this financial year,” the spokesperson said.\n“That funding will support major upgrades to the Cape-to-Cape Track and improved visitor signage throughout the park.\n“The State Government will consider the need for further policies if required.”\nThe spokesperson said Aboriginal ranger jobs were “directly tied to good conservation outcomes and have had a positive impact on national park amenity throughout WA”.\nThe State Budget money also funded campground upgrades across the Capes.",

    "text": "There is so much horse-race coverage of the upcoming presidential debates which obscures what should be obvious about the reality of the situation. The broken chaotic MAGA GOP is offering to the American people a candidate who has recently been convicted of 34 felonies involving trying to illegally influence a presidential election by falsifying business records to bury a story about his affair with a porn star. This candidate has also been convicted of sexual assault, defamation and business fraud and has three outstanding criminal trials. His biggest “accomplishment” as President was shoveling almost two trillion dollars to the rich, money which could have been used to improve America. President Joe Biden has been a dedicated public servant for decades, a husband and father of outstanding moral character, and has a record as Senator, Vice-President and President that demonstrates a sincere competent focus on improving the lives of all Americans. I don’t care a whit about how the convicted felon performs in these debates and neither should any informed American. I am sure he will be exhibiting his abnormal brew of lies and boorish insulting behavior. In my mind, he has not only already lost these debates, but insulted the American people and our democracy by even entering the race at all. President Joe Biden therefore has already won all these debates so let’s help him win the election in November as well.",

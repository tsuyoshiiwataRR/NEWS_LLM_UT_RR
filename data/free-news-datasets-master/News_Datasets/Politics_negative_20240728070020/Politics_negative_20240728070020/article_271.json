By Cristóbal Reyes | | Orlando Sentinel PUBLISHED: June 27, 2024 at 5:12 p.m. | UPDATED: June 27, 2024 at 5:13 p.m. Federal investigators searched multiple sites in Florida this week, including Orlando, in what appeared to be a series of raids connected to an unknown criminal investigation.\nThe searches, which took place Tuesday and confirmed Thursday by the Department of Defense’s Office of Inspector General, were led by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the Department of the Army Criminal Investigation Division, but it’s not clear exactly where the searches took place and why.\nHelicopter footage by WFTV-Channel 9 appeared to show a raid taking place at a building on Discovery Drive, near the University of Central Florida. The building houses Cole Engineering Services Inc., a contractor provides modeling and simulation training to the military.\nInspector General’s spokesperson Mollie Halpern declined to confirm what sites were searched, and declined to discuss Cole Engineering, citing an ongoing investigation. It’s not clear whether any arrests were made or if there are pending charges. A U.S. Army spokesperson also declined further comment.\nA spokesperson for Cole Engineering did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window)",

    "title": "Chinese EVs: US automobile industry threatened by prospects of Chinese EVs entering the country through the Mexican border",
    "text": "The US is waking up to the prospective threat of Chinese Electrical Vehicle (EV) manufacturers exporting low- cost vehicles to the US through the Mexican border using the rules framed under the US-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement. The average price of an EV vehicle manufactured in the US is $55,000 and the Chinese vehicles are priced at half this rate. The US has many options to tackle what may be termed as an “unfair trade practice”. There are several economic and social consequences, the US will need to deal with. The primary concern is related to job loss. The American automobile industry is threatened by this.Chinese EVs:Last year, China introduced an EV called the Sea Gull which is sold for $12,000 in China and $21,000 in four Latin American countries. The average price of a car manufactured in the US is $55,000. The low price of the Chinese EV will eventually attract higher demand for the product. This will ensure closure of factories in the US, loss of employment opportunities for Americans and a decline in the overall economic activities in the US. It is expected to lead to severe disruptions in the US markets and in the automobile industry.Any business cannot survive on low costs for too long. The Chinese have a different business model. They are funded by their government in the form of subsidies which will help them retain a business edge. The Centre for Strategic and International Studies found that the Chinese government had funded the EV industry to the tune of $130 billion from 2009-2021.Methodology:The Chinese are taking advantage of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement which was signed in 2020 and which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This agreement proposes free movement of goods and services throughout North America or a minimal levy of taxes and customs duty.They have set up many factories in Mexico to manufacture EV vehicles and other products. The primary purpose is to export these products into the US taking advantage of the trade deal. In many of these factories, the Chinese just assemble the products. There is no manufacturing that takes place.Options before the US:The US could do either of the following: convince Mexico to prevent Chinese companies from setting up factories in Mexico. Further, the US Customs could levy 2.5% tariff rate or could completely ban Chinese EV’s in the US under various national security laws.FAQsIs there an immediate threat to the US automobile manufacturers?In the short run, there are no major threats to the US automobile manufacturers. If the US government does not act, then there may be consequences in the long term.Has the US raised tariffs on Chinese EVs?In May, Biden hiked the tariff on Chinese EV from 27.5% to 102.5%. The European Union (EU) too has indicated that it shall be levying provisional tariffs up to 38.1% on Chinese EVs for four months beginning from July.",

    "text": "The left is all in on abortion. Promoting abortion, supporting abortion, cheerleading for abortions, funding abortions, making you fund abortions and now this from the Democrat Party.\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) has pledged to devote $8.3 million to promote killing babies in abortions this election cycle.\nAccording to a DNC statement posted on June 24, the second anniversary of the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Democrats are “investing millions to build up infrastructure across the country and help elect Democrats up and down the ballot to defend women’s reproductive freedoms.”\nAdditionally, Democrats have launched a “Red State Fund” to advocate against existing pro-life laws. The DNC has invested $4.5 million in the Red State Fund in the 2023-24 cycle, according to CBS News.\nIn Florida, a political action committee called “Florida Voters Against Extremism” has raised $190,000 to combat an amendment that opponents say would enshrine unlimited abortion into the state constitution. According to reporting by Orlando Weekly , the pro-life PAC has been funded in large part by donations from several Catholic dioceses, including the Diocese of St. Augustine and the Diocese of Pensacola-Tallahassee.\nPlease follow LifeNews.com on Gab for the latest pro-life news and info, free from social media censorship.\nThe Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops has been very vocal about its opposition to the abortion amendment, which is known as Amendment 4, saying in April that they “will work hard to oppose this cruel and dangerous amendment and urge all Floridians to vote no.”\nOn Monday, the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court’s repeal of Roe v. Wade , multiple pro-abortion groups announced they will be pouring money into battleground states during the 2024 election cycle.\n“Two years after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated federal abortion rights, Planned Parenthood advocacy and political organizations announced they will spend $40 million during the 2024 election cycle,” stated Planned Parenthood, per CBS News Congressional Correspondent Scott MacFarlane.\nKTLA reported that the eight-figure sum is an effort to “bolster President Joe Biden and leading congressional Democrats, betting that voters angry at Republican-led efforts to further restrict access to abortion can be the difference in key races around the country.”\nPer KTLA, Planned Parenthood’s campaign “will initially target eight states.” These include the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\nThe other three states on Planned Parenthood’s list include deep-red Montana – the site of a key Senate race – as well as blue New Hampshire and New York , which both have competitive down-ballot races.\n“The spending plan is not an election cycle record for [Planned Parenthood],” KTLA further noted. “It spent $45 million ahead of Biden defeating Trump in 2020 and $50 million before the 2022 midterms.”",

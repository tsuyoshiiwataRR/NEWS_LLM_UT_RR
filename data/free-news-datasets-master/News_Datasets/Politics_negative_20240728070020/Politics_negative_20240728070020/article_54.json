    "text": "A federal judge has refused to ease restrictions imposed on former Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Anthony Marrocco, who asked for changes to be made in his sentence of home detention and prohibition on using the internet following his conviction for attempted extortion.\nU.S. District Judge Matthew F. Leitman on Thursday released a two-paragraph ruling denying Marrocco’s motion to modify the conditions of his supervised release that also prohibits him from “entertainment facilities” and banned him from hosting guests, meals or parties.\nThe judge determined after reviewing transcripts of the original sentencing, now-retired U.S. District Judge Robert Cleland believed conditions he imposed were “essential to achieving a proper balance of sentencing factors.”\nRelated Articles Local News | Anthony Marrocco’s hearing to ease conditions canceled after judge disqualifies himself Local News | Group that lost Marrocco civil suit asks Macomb judge to overturn verdict Local News | Marrocco to pay $2,500 monthly to satisfy $50K fine Local News | Former Macomb public works commissioner Marrocco reports to prison Local News | Former Macomb County officials Marrocco, Liston collecting pensions despite convictions Local News | Power, not money, motivated Marrocco’s corruption, federal prosecutors say “(Marrocco’s) motion does not identify any factors that persuade the Court to deviate from Judge Cleland’s thoughtful and carefully-considered determination,” Judge Leitman wrote in his ruling.\nSteve Fishman, Marrocco’s defense attorney, declined to comment on the ruling.\nMarrocco, 76, is in confinement at his home at Bee Tee Golf Club in Macomb Township for his federal attempted-extortion conviction.\nAnthony Marrocco (MACOMB DAILY FILE PHOTO) Fishman previously called the conditions the most “onerous” he had seen during his 51-year legal career.\n“The interests of justice would clearly be served by removing the above conditions of supervised release so that Mr. Marrocco can go to work, have access to the Internet, and meet with his friends and family,” Fishman wrote in the request last month.\n“The long and the short of it is that Mr. Marrocco has complied with all of the conditions set by Judge Cleland at his sentencing and should be allowed, with the consent of the Probation Department, to have those conditions modified as requested in his motion,” Fishman said in a legal brief.\nRelated Articles Local News | Macomb County judge dismisses FOIA lawsuit over voter information Local News | Mourners gather at Romeo High School to remember slain deputy Local News | Great weather could create record crowd for Friday’s 50th Jobbie Nooner Local News | Winning lottery tickets sold at two Macomb County retailers in past month Local News | Engineering firm selected for new Warren library The order comes more than one year after Marrocco was sentenced to three months in prison and two years of court oversight for trying to extort a developer into buying tickets to a campaign fundraiser and threatening to delay or withhold a county permit.\nMarrocco was the biggest target of a widespread federal investigation of public corruption in Macomb County that led to the convictions of at least 23 contractors and public officials. The group included former Macomb County Prosecutor Eric Smith, trash titan Chuck Rizzo, towing magnate Gasper Fiore, Marrocco’s “bagman” Dino Bucci and former Clinton Township Trustee Dean Reynolds, who is serving a more than 15-year sentence for several bribery schemes.\nMarrocco was released from prison in September and ordered to serve 450 days of house arrest in Michigan without internet or unapproved visitation.\nSince he was released from prison Sept. 1, 2023 after serving 10 weeks, Marrocco has not been able to watch broadcast television, connect to the internet, including live streaming, have house guests or go visit his children and grandchildren. His children and grandchildren have been able to visit him upon request.\nThe home conditions were meant to “replicate conditions of typical confinement,” Cleland said from the bench while sentencing Marrocco at the Port Huron courthouse, federal prosecutors said.\n“Cleland intended that the home detention conditions be ‘punitive,’” Assistant U.S. Attorney T. Patrick Martin wrote in response to Marrocco’s motion. “Were this court to accede to Marrocco’s demand for sentencing relief, Judge Cleland’s sensible approach to achieving various sentencing objectives – consider the defendant’s characteristics and need for medical care, recognize the serious nature of the offense, provide just punishment, and afford adequate general deterrence – would be undone.”\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s office also declined comment beyond Martin’s written response.\nThe case was initially assigned to U.S. District Judge Paul Borman, but he recused himself without explanation. It was then reassigned to Judge Leitman.",

    "text": "/ world right now information/ The Nationwide Meeting of the BSP is the one governing, political physique of the social gathering that exists to develop insurance policies and information their implementation.\nI strongly emphasize – SINGLE, GOVERNING AND POLITICAL AUTHORITY .\nAt present, this physique has refused to investigate the political state of affairs within the nation, in addition to within the BSP.\nRefused! By voting!\nThe primary one who was AGAINST this agenda merchandise was Cornelia Ninova!\nIn opposition to discovering out who’re the businessmen who’re “shopping for the social gathering from inside”, in her personal phrases!?\nAGAINST analyzing who and why within the PG of the BSP voted for the election of Tsatsarov!?\nAGAINST analyzing the voting and the election of V. Simeonov as Deputy Speaker of the Parliament!?\nAGAINST creating a transparent political place of the BSP!?\nIn apply, Cornelia Ninova has formally and categorically defamed the political physique of the social gathering.\nThat is frank authoritarianism and the restoration of brutal totalitarianism within the ranks of the socialists.\n#Open #authoritarianism #restoration #brutal #totalitarianism #BSP",

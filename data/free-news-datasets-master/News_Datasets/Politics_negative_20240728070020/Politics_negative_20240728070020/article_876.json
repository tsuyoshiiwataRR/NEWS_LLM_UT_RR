    "text": "Former acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal unleashed on the\nSupreme Court for helping out Donald Trump by delaying his immunity case as long as possible.\n\"We will have opinions tomorrow, and we will have opinions next week, and in particular, we're waiting on, I think, two really important opinions,\" Katyal explained on MSNBC after Thursday's rulings were released.\n\"One is one that we've all been talking about: is Donald Trump absolutely\nimmune from the criminal laws, something I wouldn't think you would need a Supreme Court to answer, but nonetheless, here we are,\" Katyal said. \"The second is this case about so-called deference, two cases which is about the rules that govern you and me and everything from climate regulation to food and drug rules to tobacco and the like.\" Read Also: 8 ways convicted felon Donald Trump doesn't become president\nHe fears that the Court will \"radically reshape the law\" in that case that will dilute the government's power to regulate corporations.\nAnthony Coley, former chief spokesperson for Attorney General Merrick Garland, called the delay \"really unusual\" but explained, \"The delay is the decision we've been waiting for.\"\n\"We can have an honest conversation about whether or not the delay is intentional or not. I happen to think it is intentional, but the effect is the same, and that is keeping Donald Trump from facing criminal accountability before this election, and not just the Supreme Court election interference case but also the classified documents case down in Florida,\" Coley continued.\nHe went on to say that prosecutors win over 90 percent of the cases having to do with classified documents because evidence is generally overwhelming. That is the case with Trump, Coley said.\n\"I mean, we know that Donald Trump told his attorney general to just say that the election was stolen and let him and the GOP congressmen just handle the rest,\" Coley recalled. \"We know that there are audio recordings of this president on the phone with the Republican secretary of state just saying just find one more vote than would be needed so that Donald Trump could declare victory in the state of Georgia.\"\nYet, the Supreme Court is shielding Trump from \"facing criminal accountability in both [cases] because the Supreme Court and the federal district court and the southern district of Florida are dragging their feet, and I happen to think that's intentional.\"\nSee the full discussion in the\nvideo below or at the link here.\nLegal expert blasts Supreme Court for intentionally delaying longer just to help Trump\nwww.youtube.com",

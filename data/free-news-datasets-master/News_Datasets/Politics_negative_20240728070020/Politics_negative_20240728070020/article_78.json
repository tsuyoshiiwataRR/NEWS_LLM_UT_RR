    "text": "Paris Hilton Details Abuse at Youth Treatment Facilities While Testifying in Congress [Paris Hilton](https://www.justjared.com/tags/paris-hilton/) is opening up about her childhood abuse. On Wednesday (June 26), the DJ and businesswoman called for greater federal oversight of youth care programs while testifying to Congress as she recalled the abuse she experienced while institutionalized as a teenager in “in-profit” youth behavioral treatment facilities. Keep reading to find out more…During her testimony, Paris alleged that she was “force-fed medications and sexually abused by staff” at four different facilities for troubled teens, according to [The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/paris-hilton-testifies-before-congress-about-childhood-abuse). “When I was 16 years old, I was ripped from my bed in the middle of the night and transported across state lines to the first of four youth residential treatment facilities,” Paris described. “These programs promised healing, growth and support but instead did not allow me to speak, move freely or even look out of a window for two years.” “I was violently restrained and dragged down hallways, stripped naked, and thrown into solitary confinement,” she continued. “Can you only imagine the experience for youth who are placed by the state and don’t have people regularly checking in on them?” Paris also maintained that her parents were “completely deceived, lied to and manipulated by this for-profit industry about the inhumane treatment I was experiencing.” Paris went on to say that she has since visited facilities with foster and adopted youth and was was moved by the stories of “innocent kids who have not committed crimes, kids whose parents didn’t have resources to support them, kids whose parents passed away—kids who have already experienced trauma.” Paris first revealed [her abuse at youth treatment facilities back in 2020](https://www.justjared.com/2020/08/22/paris-hilton-reveals-the-physical-emotional-abuse-she-suffered-in-her-teenage-years/) and has since been an advocate for better protections for institutionalized children and teens.

    "text": "Donald Trump has launched a final attack on US President Joe Biden ahead of their television debate, reported The Independent. Set to air on CNN, it marks the first time in US history that a former president and an incumbent president will face off in a debate. A second debate is also scheduled to air on ABC in September.Trump's video attack:As both candidates prepare to take the stage in Atlanta, Georgia, Trump shared a video on his Truth Social account branding Biden as boring.The video is from Fox News’ satirical weekend panel show, ‘Saturday Night with Jimmy Failla.’ It features a fabricated medication called \\\"Bidenica,\\\" purportedly a sleep aid made from Joe Biden's press conferences.The narrator in the video suggests, \\\"If you’re having trouble sleeping, ask your doctor about Bidenica.\\\" The video shows actors falling asleep and snoring while listening to the president’s speeches, with the narrator adding that the \\\"patented blend of confusion and forgetfulness\\\" will calm the most overactive brains.Biden’s campaign team has also intensified its attacks on Trump, posting a series of criticisms on X, as per The Independent. These posts refer to the January 6 riots, Trump’s Truth Social post mentioning a \\\"unified Reich,\\\" and his praise for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.Also Read: | How the Biden-Trump debate could change the trajectory of the 2024 campaignAll about the debate:CNN’s presidential debate is notable for being the earliest in modern US history, with neither Trump nor Biden officially nominated by their respective parties.Anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will serve as moderators in a closed studio with no live audience. As per The Independent, CNN’s political director, David Chalian, emphasized that the moderators will be \\\"facilitating the debate between these candidates, not being a participant in that debate.\\\"Meanwhile, independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was not eligible to join the debate. CNN announced last week that Kennedy Jr. failed to meet the qualifying criteria: garnering at least 15 percent support in four major polls and being on the ballot in enough areas to theoretically have a chance at winning the Oval Office.Kennedy Jr. claimed his exclusion was due to Trump and Biden fearing he would win.",

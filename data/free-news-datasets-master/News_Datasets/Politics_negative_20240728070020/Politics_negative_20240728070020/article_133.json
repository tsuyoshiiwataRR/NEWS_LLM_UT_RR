    "text": "The chief of WA’s Council of Social Services says more needs to be done to help residents in the wider South West, with Bunbury absorbing too much of the region’s service capacity.\nWACOSS chief executive Louise Giolitto told the Times the lack of reach for services helping with issues such as mental health and homelessness was a Statewide problem, but the Augusta-Margaret River shire was increasingly falling through the gaps.\n“They say the service providers should do outreach, but we are a big State,” she said.\n“They are being consumed by the demand in Bunbury alone.\n “We need more targeted services for those families who are really struggling.”\nThe WACOSS chief’s comments follow similar agitation from the Shire of Augusta-Margaret River whose leadership has lamented lack of direct funding for local groups stepping up to fill gaps not served within the shire.\nJust Home Margaret River recently confirmed its housing information referral service would cease at the end of August despite the rise of homelessness as a serious local issue.\nSimilarly, Mindful Margaret River was living from grant to grant as it sought to fulfil its mission helping residents connect with mental health and social services.\nMindful Margaret River was formed after WA’s Department of Communities closed its own storefront several years ago.\n“I think the most recent State Budget is a good indication of the blind spot that is Margaret River,” the not-for-profit’s chief Erin Statz said.\nFunding went to tourism facilities for hikers and campers instead of direly-needed direct support.\n“There is nothing in it for our residents,” Ms Statz said.\n“Nothing about the overcrowded high school or inadequate hospital services. Nothing about the shrinking of our mental health services.\n“It is harder to access services now than it was 10 years ago, and our population in that time has exceeded projections.”\nSimilar concerns were raised by the Margaret River Business Network this week after business groups across the State rallied at Parliament House earlier this month to petition for more regional support from the State Government.\nMRBN chief Annie McFie said the State-funded Business Local program failed to make inroads beyond major centres.\nBunbury-based Regional Development Minister Don Punch said the State Government was “striking the right balance” between meeting the needs of WA’s second biggest city with those of outlying communities.\n“Bunbury is a natural central hub for the region,” he told the Times.\n“Bunbury is home to a range of government and non-government services, some providing a very localised approach and others with responsibility for the wider region wide and across the State.\n“Regional people have a right to expect top quality services, but when it comes to State Government funding, we also need to ensure economies of scale are considered to help the most people as efficiently as possible.”\nMr Punch said the government provided other measures such as road projects, airfare subsidies and the Patient Assistance Travel Scheme to reduce hurdles for people living further away.\n“The State Government’s role is to spend taxpayers’ money wisely and I believe we are striking the right balance,” he said.\n“If regional LGAs and service providers have specific concerns with the way their service delivery models are operating, my door is always open for a discussion.”\nWACOSS will visit Margaret River on July 5 for a forum to collect submissions to the State Government for further budget consideration.",

    "text": "Former President Donald Trump's far-right supporters are turning on the\nSupreme Court justice he appointed after she backed a Biden administration policy over Republican-led states.\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett was one of six justices to rule in Murthy v. Missouri, a case that determined, as\nVox correspondent Ian Millhiser put it, that \"judges do not get to micromanage how the Biden administration speaks to social media companies.\"\nJustices Brett Kavanaugh, another\nTrump appointee, and John Roberts both joined Barrett in her decision while justices Sam Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented.\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) called Barrett's ruling a \"wake up call.\"\nALSO READ:\nWhat Donald Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his debate strategy\n\"Even with 'conservative' judges like Amy Coney Barrett, we can’t expect any help from the Courts,\" the MAGA Republican\nwrote on X. \"If we want to return to a free internet, we must be even stronger in Congress, and ensure that Biden is not in the White House in 2025. A much-needed house cleaning is in order.\"\nJeffrey Clark, the former Justice department official\na D.C. disciplinary panel recently ruled violated ethics rules during attempts to overturn the 2020 election, called Barrett's decision a moral outrage.\n\"We need President Trump to be reelected not just to put in place bans on federal government censorship activity using Big Tech as their cat’s paw, but to bring enforcement actions against those violating the First Amendment,\" Clark wrote.\n\"The Judicial Branch checking out of this issue as it is postured in Murthy cannot be the final word or else censorship to maintain leftist orthodoxies about important matters like COVID and elections will continue and expand.\"\nOther right-wing voices called Barrett's ruling an act of cowardice.\n\"For all those standing by the Murthy v Missouri Supreme Court decision written by Amy Coney Barrett agreeing with their cowardly decision to hide behind standing, remember that lower courts agreed with the plaintiff as did 3 other justices,\" wrote the\nhost of the conservative Mayoral Podcast.\n\"This was a cop out by weak justices!\"\n\"Barrett goes full Safety Karen in Murthy vs. Missouri,\" added X user\n@BRoyJohnson1. \"Her legal mind is as weak as a kitten.\"",

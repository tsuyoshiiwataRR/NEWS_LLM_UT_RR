    "text": "PARIS: Marine Le Pen has said she expects her far-right National Rally (RN) party to win an absolute majority in France’s general election, form a government and take over at least some defence and armed forces decision-making – including on Ukraine.France’s constitution states that the president is head of the armed forces and chairs France’s national defence committees, but also that the prime minister is “responsible for national defence”, leaving the precise role of the premier open to interpretation. Emmanuel Macron will remain president after the two-round snap elections on 30 June and 7 July but polls suggest he will face a uniquely hostile parliament dominated by two radical blocs, RN and the leftist New Popular Front (NFP) alliance. Le Pen’s far-right party is projected to be the largest force in the new parliament, although is far from certain to win an outright majority. The latest polling projects that it and its allies could secure 220 to 260 seats in the 577-seat national assembly. Marine Le Pen – or the hard left?

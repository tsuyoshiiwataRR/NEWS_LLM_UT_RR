    "text": "JERUSALEM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Air Force Commander Tomer Bar said on Thursday that the country's forces are \"ready\" for a war against Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\"Attacking the enemy in its own territory -- that is the ultimate solution,\" Bar spoke at a pilot course graduation ceremony, claiming that Israel is \"ready against Hezbollah.\"\n\"We have the means for it, we have the capabilities, and certainly, we have the patience and fighting spirit,\" he said.\nBar's remarks echoed Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's warning on Wednesday, who said during his visit to Washington that while the Israeli government prefers a diplomatic solution, the Israeli forces are capable of taking Lebanon \"back to the Stone Age.\"\nEarlier on Thursday, the Israeli army announced that it had killed a Hezbollah militant belonging to the Lebanese armed group's air forces, who had been deploying drones towards Israel. Subsequently, two aircraft that transgressed from Lebanon into Israeli territory crashed in the vicinity of the Rosh Hanikra community near the border, according to the military, who noted that no injuries were reported.\nOn the same day, Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported that U.S. officials had cautioned Israel that even a limited ground operation in southern Lebanon could spark a full-scale conflict involving Iran and its allies. â– ",

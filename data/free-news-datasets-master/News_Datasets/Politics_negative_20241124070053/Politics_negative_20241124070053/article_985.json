    "text": "The President of Serbia, Aleksandar Vučić, announced this evening that when someone thinks to say that it is normal for the Serbian language to be official in Montenegro, it causes riots, riots, and chaos. \"When, even after the census, it becomes completely clear that in Montenegro the Serbian language is the language of the majority of people who live there, when someone thinks to say, well, I guess it's normal that the majority language in a country, if nothing else, is official, these others can also they are spoken by a much smaller number of people, but I guess that is logical, at that second you are causing riots, riots, chaos, demolishing I don't know what. And what is more natural than that, and what is more normal than that. Well, nothing, but who cares. This must not be allowed for the Serbs. For all others it is allowed, for Serbs it is not allowed. Serbs must not be allowed to live on their own in Kosovo and Metohiji,\" he said Vučić at a meeting in Vršac on the occasion 16 years since the founding of the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). As reported by Radio Television of Serbia (RTS), Vučić said that then Serbia began to wake up and that there was great hope and a great desire of the people for change. \"16 years ago, when President (Tomislav) Nikolić started founding the party, there was a great hope, there was a huge desire of the people for changes, because those who led Serbia destroyed it in a national, political, and economic sense. And Serbia started to wake up,\" said Vučić. As he said, those who were in power at the time did not understand that you cannot leave 550.000 people without work without people seeing it and feeling it. \"They thought it was possible to keep quiet and pretend to be silly about the fact that they told the people that Kosovo was a democratic issue and that they would easily solve it with their Western friends, so they told us standards before status. When it came to self-proclaiming independence of Kosovo, then they hid, shied away from responsibility and passed it on to each other, without taking any action,\" said Vučić. He added that the government at that time forgot that because of their irresponsibility, Montenegro first left the joint state, then the state union. \"In that picture of complete national, general political and overall economic collapse, a political party appeared that was supposed to unite people of different beliefs with the hope that they could change something in Serbia,\" he said.

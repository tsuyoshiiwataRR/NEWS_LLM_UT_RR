    "text": "( Julianna Frieman , Headline USA ) Democrat presidential nominee [Kamala Harris](/tag/kamala-harris) was asked a notoriously dreaded job-interview question Wednesday evening during a [CNN](/tag/cnn) townhall: What is your greatest weakness? The male questioner listened attentively from his place in the audience as Harris struggled to describe her weaknesses and how she would overcome them. “That’s a great question, Joe. Well, I am certainly am not perfect. Let’s start there,” Harris began with a chuckle. “I think that, I, perhaps a weakness, some would say— but I actually think it’s a strength,” she said, scrunching up her face, “I really do value having a team of very smart people around me who bring to my decision-making process different perspectives.” Harris told the questioner she constantly tells her team, “Let’s kick the tire on that.” CNN’s [Anderson Cooper](/tag/anderson-cooper) asked the vice president a similar question about learning from past mistakes, to which Harris—who took a moment before speaking—had difficulty providing a clear answer to as well. COOPER: Is there something you can point to in your life that is a mistake that you've learned from? KAMALA: \"I have worked very hard to make sure that I'm well-versed on issues.\" The Kamala you see stumbling in every unscripted answer she gives is what she calls \"well-versed.\" [pic.twitter.com/fmENkOtpvI]— Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) [October 24, 2024] “I mean, I’ve made many mistakes. And they range from, you know, if you’ve ever parented a child, you know you make lots of mistakes,” Harris, who never gave birth to a child of her own, said with nervous laughter. Harris is married to [Doug Emhoff](/tag/doug-emhoff), who has a 25-year-old daughter, Ella, and a 30-year-old son, Cole, from his previous marriage of 16 years. The Democrat nominee tied the knot with Emhoff in August 2014. “In my role as vice president, I mean, I’ve probably worked very hard at making sure that I am well-versed on issues. And, um, I think that is very important. It’s a mistake not to be well-versed on an issue and be compelled to answer a question,” Harris said with a smirk.

Y !!! Whats up Villanova, how you guys doing? Sold us out again! You guys doing fucking good? Great! Im sure you know, next week is our last regular Top 10 before the general election. Holy shit, time flies, doesnt it? Well of course, as is tradition, like we have done with the 2020 and 2016 elections, were taking a breather, were sitting this one out. Because we dont need to remind you that, until the dust settles and Kamala is declared the rightful winner, you dont need to see our bullshit. Well just sit here and twiddle our thumbs and stare at amusing dog videos on our Instagram feeds until the dust settles. But in the meantime, until we return, weve got not one, but two episodes of our spinoff program Holy Shit: The Sunday Sermons for your enjoyment! In the first episode, we take a look at religious themed movies hitting the box office, and in the second, were going to take a look at batshit insane Oklahoma superintendent Ryan Walters going full MAGA Taliban. Plus weve got four more to come! OK, do we have time for the thing? Of course we do! OK, who here has been to Sea World? Well, regardless of what you think about the San Diego staple, the park is under fire because a whale had what the press release is calling a gastric episode. Yes, you heard that correctly. In the middle of a show, no less. So thats right the tourists attending the whale show got covered in, well, whale shit. Which of course is causing the park to do some major damage control. Like, I always love when a story like this breaks and you see the press release from HR that says something like We always strive to put on the best product we possibly can. Really? I mean Im sure they probably plan for everything, but Im not sure that whale diarrhea was in their plans. But you can imagine there were some pretty angry tourists who were attending that show. Of course, will this get resolved in time? Maybe, maybe not. But anyway the press release is unintentionally hilarious and its definitely worth reading. OK enough of the intro, we have a lot of idiocy to get to! But first the Daily Shows editorial of the week is from LaVerne Cox, who has some insights into the insane conspiracy-fueled GOP war on the LGBT and especially the T community: So where do we begin for this week? Well, the number one slot is of course that guy who we inexplicably used to call president, and is scarily a coin flip away from becoming our next one again Donald Trump (1). Hes had quite the week, and after his batshit crazy town hall last week, what is he hiding about his mental capacity? If that wasnt rock bottom, what is? WTF! In the second slot is also Donald Trump (2). Hes canceling most of his appearances this week and going full mob boss in regards to his favorite news network hidey hole Fox News. So what exactly is going on with this guy? Well, we intend to find out! In the number 3 slot this week, we have to talk about a bizarre conspiracy theory that seems to rear its ugly head and is mainly nothing more than outrage bait the notion that trans athletes in sports (3) have an advantage over biological females. But were calling their bluff the people complaining have probably never actually seen a real womens sporting event, have they? Of course they havent. In the number 4 slot this week, weve normally been avoiding the polls (4) because theres just too many of them and its impossible to keep up with whats trending or not, but apparently the betting markets are going all in on Asshole 45, but why? We hope they are wrong. In the number 5 slot this week is the return of our segment on the plight of the worlds most insane monstrosity on 4 wheels Cyberstruck (5)! Yes, Tesla has been getting into the law enforcement business, and no, its not exactly what Elon had in mind. In fact, real police officers think differently! In the number 6 slot this week is of course our weekly visit to the Holy Church Of The Top 10 in Holy Shit (6) and this week, could the far right achieve their ultimate goal of a total nationwide abortion ban? Well theyre hedging their bets on this and its all the wrong people! In the number 7 slot this week, were profiling the extremely controversial far right MAGA worshipping pastor of Cavalry Church in Chino Hills, California, Jack Hibbs (7) in a new This Fucking Guy! Taking the number 8 slot this week is our weekly venture into the never ending world of online tin foil hat nuttery in Conspiracy Corner (8), and this week, with the right wing screaming like spoiled toddlers about election integrity, the AG of Texas, Ken Paxton, has a scheme of his own. What is it? We dont know, but its there! In the number 9 (NEIN!!!) slot this week is a new I Need A Drink we have to go across the pond to our good friends in the UK for this story, because a uniquely British sport Conker is involved in a massive cheating scandal, which is too weird the more you dig into it! Finally this week, its time for our weekly election round up in Road To The White House (10), and this week, Kamala steps out of her comfort zone and invades Trumps turf when shes interviewed on Fox News, and she definitely scored some points! Unless, of course, you watch Fox News for more than 5 minutes. Enjoy! And as always don't forget the key ! [div style=\"padding: 20px; background-color: # ; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px 1px #aaa;\"][div style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica; font-weight: bold; border-bottom: 1px dotted #999; padding-bottom: 8px;\"] [font size=\"8\"]Donald Trump [br] [/font] [br] We dont need to tell you what an absolutely banner and incredibly bizarre week its been for Donald Trump. And this was after last week, which was equally batshit insane. We even planned to have this entire space be about his bizarre town hall appearance where he just stood there and played songs off an iPad for nearly 40 minutes. And come on, nothing gets the party going like Ave Maria, am I right? You dont know! You dont know. Also in the news which we dont even have time for this week, is that Trump launched his own line of cryptocurrency, which, since everyone knows that you dont read the fine print, 70% of that money goes to Trump family members, because lets face it, living the private jet Louis Vitton mega mansion lifestyle is hard, yo! And they need money! NOT. But this week, in what was an apparent F-U to Kamala saying that her first job was at a McDonalds, he decided to head to a suburbian McDonalds drive-thru and pretended to cosplay as a McDonalds employee. Which, this might be one of the weirdest campaign stops ever. Former president Donald Trump briefly manned the fry station during a stage-managed visit to a McDonald's franchise here on Sunday, but he dodged a question about increasing the minimum wage. Wearing an apron, the Republican presidential nominee lifted fries out of the hot oil, shook them, salted them and placed them into containers for service. He praised the staff and the company, then popped his head out the drive-through window and waved at a crowd that had gathered across the street. He began to hand out paper bags to the cars that had been waiting in line before his arrival. One man said, \"Trump 2024!\" as he drove away. The restaurant was closed to the public during Trump's visit, and the motorists whom Trump served were screened by the U.S. Secret Service and positioned before his arrival. No one ordered food. Instead, the attendees received whatever Trump gave them. Trump was at the fry station for about five minutes and spent about 15 minutes at the drive-through window, much of it taking questions from reporters.

To give Trump the benefit of the doubt, this might be the first time in his entire life that hes ever done any real, actual work. Even if its just for fifteen minutes. Oh and the other thing they probably forgot to tell you the particular McDonalds franchise in question that he chose was run by a die-hard MAGA fan and was currently closed for health inspection and code violations. Which, come on, if the rumors about Trumps lack of hygiene and his adult diaper usage are true, that place is practically a level 3 biohazard. Not quite Chernobyl or COVID at the beginning of March 2020 level, but certainly enough that you should at least quarantine and wipe down everything accordingly. The McDonald's restaurant where Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump briefly worked on Sunday failed its latest health inspection, documents show. The former president manned the fry station and served takeout to people in the drive-thru lane in Feasterville-Trevose in Bucks County, a key swing voter area in battleground Pennsylvania. The restaurant was closed to the public for Trump's visit. Trump, a big fan of McDonald's food and a self-professed germophobe, was seen in footage shared by his campaign on social media putting on an apron, frying a basket of fries, scooping fries and serving customers through a drive-thru window. A report from the Bucks County Department of Health after an inspection on March 27 cited health code violations at the restaurant, including employees not having \"hands clean and properly washed.\" The former president manned the fry station and served takeout to people in the drive-thru lane in Feasterville-Trevose in Bucks County, a key swing voter area in battleground Pennsylvania.

Ha ha ha ha!!! Yes, hello lawsuit! Got to love it when the people in the audience are funnier than you are! Thank you, sir. Moving on, but this campaign stop was certainly divisive. And I always love when the corporate offices have to put out the press release saying that they dont approve of what that particular franchise owner is doing. But its good that corporate stepped in and put a stop to future campaign stops. But they should have done this before it happened. No doubt that particular owner was keeping corporate in the dark. He should lose his license for this. McDonalds has been thrust into the 2024 election, gaining particular attention over the weekend when former President Donald Trump served fries at a Feasterville-Trevose, Pennsylvania, location. But McDonalds had nothing to do with Trumps visit. The company operates on a franchise model, which means the vast majority of its locations are independently owned and operated. Although franchise owners have to abide by certain guidelines in their agreements with the parent company, they are free to invite political candidates to serve fries without McDonalds buy-in. The company said Sunday in an internal memo to employees obtained by CNN that it did not invite Trump or the attention the election has brought it but the company spun the spotlight as proof that McDonalds remains a key part of everyday American life for millions of people. As weve seen, our brand has been a fixture of conversation this election cycle. While weve not sought this, its a testament to how much McDonalds resonates with so many Americans, the company said in its memo. McDonalds does not endorse candidates for elected office and that remains true in this race for the next President. We are not red or blue we are golden.

Trump shows up for fifteen minutes pretending to serve large orders of fries to people and right wing media swoons all over him, like Taylor Swift fans at her latest show. And by the way, MAGA conspiracy theorists no, were not in hysterics over this latest publicity stunt. In fact, that sound you hear is us laughing *AT* you, not with you because of how stupid you look. In fact, after this stunt, a whole bunch of internet pranksters went and review bombed the McDonalds location on Yelp. Which got so flooded with review bombs that Yelp locked the page and is deleting most of the fake reviews. Which, yes they deserved it, but really, people, dont stoop to their level. In fact, if youre thinking of doing this dont. After an influx of reviews and comments, Yelp temporarily disabled users' ability to post about the McDonald's in Feasterville, Pennsylvania, that Donald Trump visited for a campaign appearance. Noorie Malik, Yelps vice president of user operations, confirmed the company's decision in a statement emailed to USA TODAY. \"For Yelp to remain a useful resource to the community, reviews must be based on a genuine, firsthand experience with the business,\" Malik's statement read. \"Due to the increased public attention we saw after former President Trump visited a McDonalds in Feasterville, PA on Sunday, Oct. 20, we worked quickly to temporarily disable the posting of content to the page and placed an Unusual Activity Alert on Monday, October 21.\" It is unclear how long Yelp users will be unable to comment on or review the McDonald's in Feasterville. \"When we see the activity dramatically decrease or stop, our moderators will clean up the page so reviews describing only firsthand consumer experiences are reflected.

And youve really got to wonder with all of this exactly what the fuck is going on? Donald Trumps popularity has hit a plateau. He is not gaining any new followers. Yet the polls have him just barely edging out Kamala. But hes been canceling appearances left and right because his handlers say hes and Im quoting exhausted. His rallies have become absolute shit shows. But you know, this is the cost of keeping your name in the news 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Trump will go and hawk his stupid merchandise his NFT trading cards, his stupid looking sneakers, his $100,000 watches which look like cheap knock offs that youd get from a street vendor in Times Square in New York City, his own line of crypto currency and whatever the fuck this is. The list goes on and on! But when youre trying to win over voters, you cannot keep canceling appearances, but this is the price you are paying. And theres definitely something that theyre not telling us about Trumps health, and Ronny Jackson cannot rig another cognitive test the way that he did the last time (see: Idiots #9-6 ). Sigh, another reason why we cant have nice things in this country! Former President Trump's planned appearance at a National Rifle Association event next week was cancelled Thursday, the latest in a slew of scuttled public appearances and interviews by the former president in recent weeks. Why it matters: With only 17 days to go until Election Day, the spate of cancellations gives voters fewer chances to hear from Trump before heading to the polls in a coin toss race. Vice President Kamala Harris, on the other hand, has been on a media blitz after enduring criticism from Republicans about a perceived lack of interviews. And while Harris has ventured into the unfriendly territory of a Fox News interview, Trump has stuck to the safe spaces of conservative outlets. In the appearances he has made, Trump's rhetoric has grown more violent and nativist. In recent weeks, he has decried his critics as the \"enemy from within\" and fanned the flames of false conspiracy theories about migrants.

You know the really scary thing? If somehow the GOP gets back into power, we could potentially be a Big Mac away from a JD Vance dictatorship, and whos to say he wont leave office even if hes forced out? Insanity. But if hes this exhausted, then why is he even being considered for the most powerful office in the United States? Theres something that they are not telling us, and something definitely doesnt pass the smell test here. In fact, our good friend Halsey has a new album out this week, so why dont we name this weeks edition after her previous album If I Cant Have Love, I Want Power? Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Good use of that cover there. But yeah, something stinks and we need the GOP to show us their poker face! Donald Trump reportedly canceled a planned Tuesday appearance with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former congressmember Tulsi Gabbard for a health-focused virtual town hall, according to his team, citing changes in Trumps schedule. The switch-up is the latest in a series of canceled or rescheduled appearances in recent days, which fueled reports that the former president, 78, was becoming too exhausted to fully campaign in the tight race against Kamala Harris. The Republican has backed out of planned interviews with CNBCs Squawk Box, the Shade Room podcast, and NBC. The campaign has pushed back on this narrative, calling the exhuastion claim unequivocally false.

Please disperse! Just come on, GOP! Just admit you want absolute power and one party rule so we can vote against you already. Seriously, what happens if they get reelected and Trump dies in office or they use the 25th amendment to install JD Vance as dictator for life? Its truly insane to think what could happen, and theres nothing good that would come of it. Which is why we have to do everything to stop MAGA at all costs! Weve only got two weeks to flush Trump and his MAGA turds down the Fox News sewer they came from for good! But come on, Joe Rogan is who youre going to? Thats your flex? Sigh. After backing out of several major interviews at the last minute, Donald Trump has one last major appearance on the horizon: The Joe Rogan Experience. The Republican presidential nominee will be meeting with the former Fear Factor host on Friday, reported Politico. Itll be the first time that Trump has appeared on Rogans podcast. Over the last several months, Trump has made a concerted effort to reach young, male voters by signing up for a slew of interviews with podcasters, including Twitch ban-ee Adin Ross; the Lex Fridman Podcast; Six Feet Under, hosted by wrestler Mark Calaway (perhaps better known as The Undertaker); and Theo Vons podcast, This Past Weekend. Meanwhile, Trump has aggressively dodged more mainstream news appearances, including going so far as to break election tradition by refusing to sit for a 60 Minutes interview in September, which he reportedly backed out of last-minute over fears that the rigorous show would fact-check him.

Theres nothing wrong with this, except the guy who wants to be president is one Big Mac away from ending his presidency. See? Isnt this concrete proof that a garbage in, garbage out lifestyle is bad for you? And Im not just talking about the copious amounts of fast food that he eats, either. Im also talking about his copious amounts of Fox and Newsmax consumption too. That shit rots your mind, while the fast food expands your waistline. Put both of those two things together and its a powder keg waiting to go off. But come on, how bad are you hurting for content when you cancel on the brain worm guy and the gun nuts? And Harris is the lazy one? What the actual fuck! Thats his base! Former President Donald Trump abruptly cancelled an appearance at an NRA event in Savannah, Georgia, fueling public concerns about his mental state. Trump was slated to headline the Defend the 2nd rally on Oct. 22. The Trump campaign cited a scheduling conflict in pulling out of that event, per the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The gun advocacy group later scrapped the entire event. The cancellation follows an appearance at the Economic Club of Chicago on Tuesday, in which interviewer John Micklethwait repeatedly pressed Trump on his rambling non-answers and topic changes. A day before that appearance, Trump similarly confused an audience at a Pennsylvania town hall when he paused questions for over half an hour to sway along to his playlist on stage. Trump has been on a cancellation tear, pulling out of several planned interviews in recent days. Per CNNs Brian Stelter, Trump reportedly suddenly scrapped a planned interview with NBC News senior business correspondent Christine Romans penciled in for Monday morning in Philadelphia. He had previously cancelled a stop by CNBCs Squawk Box, citing another purported scheduling conflict. Trump was slated to headline the Defend the 2nd rally on Oct. 22.

But we kind of need to talk about it in a more serious light. You may have seen a lot of headlines pop up lately about an online conspiracy that originated on shows like Infowars and Tucker Carlson about trans athletes participating in sports. Yes, it was a big controversy in 2020. But should trans women or trans men be barred from participating in the sports where the genders are different from the ones that they were assigned at birth? Well, the controversy reared its ugly head during the Olympics this year when a wrestling match was cut short and boxer Imane Khelif was investigated profusely for being perceived as transgender by internet conspiracy theorists, and it was proven to be not true in the slightest. But we do need to have a serious discussion how did this get to be such a hot button issue when it wasnt not even 10 years ago? And also how is it having so much sway on how people vote for a particular candidate? Well it recently reared its ugly head in the news again thanks to former NASCAR driver and current Mar-A-Shithole drink server Danica Patrick. A 2023 Gallup poll found that 93% of Republican respondents believe transgender athletes should only be allowed to compete on teams that match their birth gender, compared to 6% who said they should be allowed to compete on teams that match their current identity. Meanwhile, 48% of Democrat respondents said transgender athletes should only play on teams that match their birth gender and 47% said they should play on teams that match their current identity. In a town hall that is set to air on Fox News, former President Donald Trump said he would ban or stop transgender women from playing girls sports. As for Vice President Kamala Harris, the group Advocates for Trans Equality has endorsed her, saying she has shown an unwavering commitment to advancing the well-being of the transgender community.

Come on. This shit is getting ridiculous. And its insane that people believe this conspiracy theory bullshit over, you know, facts. And logic. Your odds of encountering an actual trans athlete are like 1/10th of 1%. And the right wing is so hysterical over the trans hatred and conspiracy theories online that theyre unable to separate fact from fiction. But whats extremely horrible is that if you pay attention to the advertisements this election cycle nearly every single GOP ad just *HAS* to attack trans athletes in some way. Even though most people who arent dialed into the conspiracy theory sphere wouldnt give a shit about this issue. Voters consistently say issues like the economy and reproductive rights are their top concerns in this election. But in the closing weeks of the campaign, Republican ads focusing on transgender rights are dominating airwaves all over the country. Consider the ad below from former President Donald Trump. If you've seen a Trump campaign ad lately, there's a good chance it's this one: The Trump campaign has recently dropped at least $17 million on ads highlighting Vice President Harris' support during her 2019 presidential campaign for access to gender-affirming medical treatment for transgender people. It's part of a broader Republican strategy casting the Democratic Party as taking transgender rights to extremes. According to data compiled by AdImpact for NPR, these ads have aired more than 30,000 times, including in the key swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The campaign has placed a particular focus on NFL and college football broadcast audiences. Consider the ad below from former President Donald Trump.

You know theres just no arguing with people who believe the conspiracy theory bullshit. My advice is to just boo and heckle and ridicule them out of existence. After all, they worship a guy who got famous as a social media troll. The only way to fight the trolls is to troll back and troll back harder. But its truly insane and horrifying that a convicted criminal who has a very real chance of becoming president again is using the online hate to his advantage. In fact, look at New York, where the democrats proposed an anti-abortion bill, so conservatives in New York countered with a bill to ban trans athletes. Just . AH!!!! Stop it already!!! Democrats pushed to get a constitutional amendment on New Yorks ballot because they believed it could energize liberals eager to protect abortion rights. Republicans are now hoping the same amendment will ignite a fire under people upset about transgender athletes participating in girls and womens sports. Voters will decide Nov. 5 whether to approve the states proposed Equal Rights Amendment, which has already been the subject of a court fight over its broad language. The amendment, called Proposition 1 on the ballot, has emerged as one of the more unusual ideological battles of the 2024 election season, partly because of disagreements about what it will do if passed. On paper, the proposed amendment would expand a section of the state constitution that now says a person cant be denied civil rights because of their race, creed or religion. The new language will also ban discrimination based on national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes or reproductive healthcare and autonomy.

But of course, its no secret that Trump plans to go full Nazi if hes given a second term. In fact theyve already got anti-trans laws ready to go if he somehow gets elected again. And this is why elections matter, and why voting against your best interests is NO FUCKING JOKE. Because if you vote against your best interests, you will get people who you wont like in power and you will not be able to get rid of them no matter how hard you try. It is insanity that someone this monstrous could assume power again. We have to stop this man at all costs, because it can and will get ugly. During a taped town hall of only female voters in Cumming, Ga., with Fox Newss Harris Faulkner, Trump was asked by an audience member how he would handle the transgender issue in womens sports as president. Its such an easy question, and everybody in the room, and you know that answer, Trump said during Tuesdays town hall on The Faulkner Focus. Were not going to let it happen. Trump in his response referenced a viral video of a transgender college volleyball player in California spiking a ball at her opponent. The player was hit with the ball in the shoulder and was unharmed, and the transgender athletes team ultimately lost the match in straight sets. I never saw a ball hit so hard, Trump said, referring to the video. His administration, he said, will absolutely stop schools from allowing transgender athletes to play on sports teams that match their gender identity.

Well, of course Trump is attempting to win over the crypto dude bro vote by launching his own line of cryptocurrency. Come on, really? Theres nothing he wont put his name or face on at this point, and its kind of sad. But this week, another new group thats looking to use electronic fake money to influence the election not seen before in previous elections has emerged the betting markets. Yes, betting markets. Combining the worst of Las Vegas with the worst of Wall St. into one disgusting, money-losing package. And yes, if youre wondering, they are going to use their ill gotten gains to try and sway the election towards Trump. Come on, remember when hackers used to use their powers for good instead of evil? Well if you think that the crypto dude bros are certifiably insane, you havent seen anything yet! The betting odds of former President Donald Trump winning next months election rose to their highest level since President Joe Biden ceded way to Vice President Kamala Harris in July, though the increasingly popular election betting platform Polymarket reportedly is investigating the source of the massive wagers driving the odds shift amid scrutiny into the eight-figure bets on Trump. The crypto-based Polymarket gives Trump a 66% chance of prevailing over Harris, the first time his odds have risen over 65% since July 21, the day Biden dropped his reelection bid. Competitor sites which also take wagers on the election outcome are heavily in Trumps corner, albeit less starkly than Polymarket, as Kalshi and PredictIt price in roughly 60% and 57% market-implied odds for Trump, respectively. Its the latest trend in betting markets toward Trump, as Kalshi favored Harris as recently as Oct. 9, PredictIt as recently as Oct. 8 and Polymarket as recently as Oct. 4.

Whatever school you graduated from, you obviously failed the civics part of it. Because Im going to explain something to the MAGA dude bros out there. Markets dont vote. Odds dont vote. Land doesnt vote. And most importantly, the people vote, and you only get one shot at it. And something else you have to realize population densities. Yes, well over half the country lives in those blue areas Fox News likes to pretend dont exist. Also too, let me give you a little lesson in Gambling 101 NEVER, EVER bet against the house. Because the house always wins, and this is kind of the real world equivalent of doing that. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has stretched his betting lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris as the 2024 White House race enters its home stretch. Trump's lead comes after a slew of cancelled media interviews and a Univision town hall where he again embraced the Jan. 6 insurrection, calling it a \"day of love,\" and repeating falsehoods about migrants in Springfield, Ohio that led to violent threats. Democrats have been raising questions about Trump's age and behavior during his rallies, including at a town hall in Oaks, Pennsylvania, that was interrupted by medical emergencies in the audience. On Saturday, Trump fixated on the male anatomy of late golf legend Arnold Palmer during a speech in western Pennsylvania. The Harris campaign has said Trump is too old and unstable to hold office, echoing the calls that eventually led President Joe Biden to drop out of the race.

Thank you Cartman! So how do you explain the betting markets to someone who doesnt quite understand them? Well, as weve already seen, theyre run by some incredibly shady characters who shouldnt be trusted. Remember when Martin Shkreli rigged the pharmaceutical markets so he could profit off $35 vials of insulin by 10,000%? Guess what not only is that an example of shady characters doing shady things, thats also betting against the house. And Shkreli bet against the house and was living large, but he ultimately failed at doing that and got busted. We cant say the same thing will happen to the betting market bros, but we do believe that is coming, and the SEC and FEC will come for them for election interference should Kamala win. It seems that there might have been more stories written about the prediction markets than people who actually use them as we were shocked by how few traders actually bet on these platforms, and the thin trading volume and liquidity which make it extremely difficult to make bets to begin with. On some platforms, we tried to make bets on several key battleground races only to find out we couldnt, because there were zero sellers in those markets. In other markets, the spread meaning the difference between the bid price and the ask price was so massive, running upwards of 50%, that it was substantive impossible to buy or sell. (some screenshots of examples are linked). All this means that the so-called price cited by media accounts is merely a phantom figure and not representative of reality, since nobody can buy or sell in these markets in practice. On other platforms, even the largest market the presidential election odds feature extremely low volume, generally in the tens of thousands of dollars a day but sometimes hovering in the lower hundreds of thousand of dollars a day, to the point where a single small bet of a few thousand dollars can immediately move the market by several percentage points in real time. It can be substantively impossible for anyone to bet more than a few thousand dollars without immediately moving the markets which might explain why the betting odds are often so disparate across different prediction market sites, and dont even move in alignment with each other much less with polling results.

Also, as weve seen, if it favors Donald Trump, its most likely bullshit. And the betting markets, are guess what complete and total bullshit. We totally expect a lot of these guys will get nailed by the SEC in the next few months after the election is finally over. You know also, theres really no way to make elections fun. Yes, theyre tedious, and yes they can be boring at times. But combining electoral polls with the excitement of gambling is a surefire way to lose money. Even Trump knows a thing or two about bankrupting casinos, he bankrupted 4 of them! But this could make for a very interesting SCOTUS case down the road. In the mean time, dont bet against the house. People cant get enough of betting on the 2024 presidential election, and thanks to a recent legal ruling, its easier than ever for Americans to vote with their wallet. On Polymarket, one of the top online exchanges, people have already spent over $1.2 bn betting on the US presidential election. That includes two mystery individuals betting millions on a Trump win. Betting market odds are suddenly on the lips of US broadcasters and campaign spin doctors, quoted like polls and watched like the weather. Betting on elections has long been prohibited in the US, but various exchanges and their users have found ways to get in on the action nonetheless. A federal appeals court ruled earlier on October 2 that prediction market Kalshi could offer contracts on US elections for the time being, leading to more than $3m in political contracts within the first week. Federal regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which concluded last year such contracts run afoul of commodities law, argue this activity still amounts to illegal gaming or gambling, and are seeking further appeals hearings as soon as December.

Yes, there are some men who just want to watch the world burn, and one of those men is Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Welcome to our segment detailing the plight of the worlds most ridiculous monstrosity on 4 wheels not seen since the DMC DeLorean the Tesla Cybertruck! You may have heard that Elon Musk, you know him best as the CEO of Tesla, Space X, X, the Boring Company, Starlink, and about a hundred other joints, desperately wants to expand the Tesla brand into non-consumer markets. Most specifically, law enforcement. Yes, since Elon has attached himself to the most pro police candidate whos ever policed, despite the fact that hes a convicted felon still on trial, hes selling his cars to law enforcement. But actual police officers, on the other hand, arent having any of it. And the reviews are in! Teslas law-enforcement specific variants of the Model 3 and Model Y have been called everything from extremely terrible to completely unsuable. Which, since it's Elon Musk, yeah, were not shocked at all that this seems totally on brand for him. At a rally this past April in Michigan, surrounded by a cadre of law-enforcement officials, Donald Trump suddenly began railing against electric cars. President Joe Bidens decision to support EVs, he decried, is one of the dumbest Ive ever heard. Minutes later, he was back to praising the sheriffs behind him: We have to get law and order back. These are the best people in the world, he said to a smattering of applause. Support for law enforcement and skepticism of electric cars both abound on the right. Police officers are more likely to identify as Republican than the communities they serve, and their unions widely endorsed Trump in 2020. Meanwhile, the Americans buying electric cars tend to be Democratic. And yet, more and more law-enforcement officers seem to be taken by EVs. When they get into and experience the [electric] cars firsthand themselves, Tony Abdalla, a sergeant with the South Pasadena Police Department, told me, theyre like, Okay, I think I get it now. Last month, South Pasadenas police department became the first in the country with a fully electric police fleet, replacing all of its gas-powered vehicles with 20 Teslas. Four officers, after test-driving Teslas for the department, have already bought one for personal use, Abdalla, who leads his departments EV-conversion project, told me. South Pasadena is one among a growing number of law-enforcement agencies that are electrifying their fleets. Support for law enforcement and skepticism of electric cars both abound on the right.

And it doesnt make even more sense when you realize that his BFF is the one who is making a killing in the EV industry! And not only that, its like he intentionally tries to take the wrong answer on literally every issue. Like you could ask Trump Whats 2 + 2? and hed answer the answer is penguins! Prove me wrong! Prove me wrong!. But while it may seem great to have a police department be entirely gas free, is the Tesla Model Y really up for duty? The answer, which you may be not at all surprised at is a big fat no. In fact, most actual police departments are chucking the Model Y in favor of something that can keep up with their demands. After all, how are you going to catch crooks when you spend all of your time charging your car? Electric vehicles are great at many things, but police work might not be one of them. The Menlo Park police department in California has been testing three Tesla Model Ys, and its takeaways from the trial run show that it might be some time before EVs catch on with mainstream law enforcement agencies. Menlo Park PD said the Model Y was nearly unusable for police work because their interiors arent accommodating for officers wearing bulletproof vests and duty belts. That said, they did enjoy some of the vehicles driving dynamics. The departments report read, Officers using the vehicles appreciated the acceleration, steering, and vehicle speed compared to the hybrids and remaining gasoline-only patrol vehicles. However, the Teslas presented challenges due to the small interior space, smart car features, and low vehicle profile limiting maneuverability. Teslas do not appear to be the patrol cars of the future in their current configuration, according to the reports conclusion. Officers also cited difficulties charging, and the department would need to invest heavily to upfit any EV for police duty, making the tried-and-true gas-powered workhorses more attractive.

Great movie. Pretty sure Jake and Elwood wouldnt get very far in a Cybertruck if the movie were to take place in 2024. And yes, Elon, we get it! You hate California! You really hate us, so stop it please! But of course, while this segment isnt really about the Tesla brand, it is about their most ridiculously over-hyped and overrated product to date the Cybertruck. Does the Cybertruck have applications in law enforcement other than being a prop vehicle in a Demolition Man sequel? Well, the answer of course is, it varies depending what your sources are. Because once again, since Elon hates California so much, the city of Irvine, which is right next door to our home offices in Santa Ana, gets to be the test bed for Cybertruck cop cars! A police department in Southern California says it has the countrys first Tesla Cybertruck for police use, but the unusual vehicle wont see much action. The Irvine Police Department unveiled the purchase Tuesday in a splashy video on social media, including Facebook and X. The price tag: $153,175.03, including the installation of emergency equipment. The police department said its Cybertruck would have a limited role: jazzing up anti-drug events at schools through the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) program. \"For over three decades, our DARE officers have driven attention-grabbing and one-of-a-kind vehicles that never fail to turn heads and excite students, the department said on Facebook.

Nothing to see here! The Irvine PD just wasted $153K of your taxpayer money for a vehicle that will only be used if you win the Showcase Showdown! Actually, it might scare some pre-teens off of drug use. But thats about it. But anyway, could South Pasadenas all electric fleet serve as a model for law enforcement agencies nationwide? Well, maybe if they chose a more competent electric vehicle manufacturer, one could make that case. And come on, doesnt the Hummer EV look so much cooler as a law enforcement vehicle? And unlike the Cybertruck, it actually works and can hold a lot of stuff, and maybe even a prisoner or two. But anyway, Elons definitely selling some snake oil and its not going to get better any time soon. But hey at least you got Cyberstruck! Some police departments in Southern California are already using Tesla Model Y electric vehicles as patrol cars. Now, Cybertrucks could be next, according to UP.FIT, a Hawthorne-based company that outfits police departments. I can confirm that we have several departments in California, specifically Southern California, that have expressed interest in ordering our new UP.FIT Next-Gen Patrol Cybertruck, Fleet Director James Hedland told KTLA. Thats all the company can say for now. Hedland couldnt reveal which departments have ordered Cybertrucks, due to contracts they have with their clients. Recently, the company helped Anaheims police department by modifying a fleet of Tesla Y patrol cars as part of a pilot program.

Its time to take a seat in the pew and pass the collection plate, for the Holy Church Of The Top 10 has convened and its time to remind you that the holiest among us are the most full of: My fair congregation! Please be seated! You know, in the last six years since weve been doing this program, weve often wondered what the ultimate end game of those who worship the Unholy Dark One was going to be. It certainly wasnt the end of Roe V Wade, and we all know how the Dark Ones unholy and obscenely corrupt minions that he installed on the highest of courts decided to overturn Roe V Wade purely out of spite because their god king wasnt the grand exhalted leader of the world, and we know they arent going to stop there. Because of course, they dont worship GAWD or JAYSUS. They instead worship the unholy, ungodly Dark One! I of course speak of a man who is so foul, so depraved and disgusting that his name dare NOT be spoken in my church! The idea of a total abortion ban is absolutely disgusting and Im really surprised that its not a total deal breaker for some. But then again, for the most hardcore supporters of the unholy Dark One, there is nothing thats going too far, theres no line that they wont cross. No subject is off limits for them. But could it happen in our lifetime? Its possible. But then again we thought the malicious overturning of Roe V Wade couldnt happen in our lifetimes, either. So yes we need to keep voting blue, everybody! Just weeks before what religious-right figures have insisted is the most important election in our lifetimes, if not the nations history, Donald Trump and a parade of Republican leaders could normally have been expected to show up at the Pray Vote Stand activist conferenceformerly known as the Values Voter Summitto revel in the adoration of the Family Research Council faithful and fire up the activists for the work ahead. But not this year. While the conference opened last Friday with a prayer asking God to raise up Christians to vote and take dominion over this earth exactly the way you intended it, the triumphalist spirit was in short supply at a diminished and relatively downbeat conference. Family Research Council leaders had a problem. On the one hand, religious-right groups are spending tens of millions of dollars to elect Trump in hopes of getting four years of Christian nationalist policymaking and hundreds of MAGA-minded judicial nominees who could serve for decades.

But fare not, there is an election in two weeks and we can change the outcome from those who look to destroy this country from within, which is what they have been doing! But then again, when your supporters support the unholy Dark One and everything terrible that he stands for, it seems like all bets are off the table. Again, theres no telling how far they will go! And of course, like most terrible things happening in this country, every time evil laws are passed, theres always some Christian group bragging about it behind the scenes! Of course, leave it to the unholy Dark One himself and his minion Joel Webbon to lead the charge! Webbon, who has a history of making controversial comments regarding the issues of race and religion, said that he has become a one issue voter in the upcoming presidential election, and that issue is which candidate will \"deport millions of illegal immigrants.\" The reason Webbon has settled upon this as his primary issue is because, he claims, this nation belongs to \"us and our posterity\" and not a bunch of non-white foreigners. \"It comes down to natural affections, natural loves,\" Webbon said. \"And these are categories that Christians have always had for a very, very long time, but we lost them over the last century. We lost them and we started to feel guilty for certain things that the Bible doesn't actually condemn. We were blessed by God, these United States, with much prosperity, much success, much strength and victory and instead of offering to the Lord as a response for all his blessing, offering him gratitude, instead, we chose to respond with guilt.\" \"And so, out of guilt for all the blessing that he gave us, we decided that we should just give all the blessing away,\" he continued. \"And instead of it belonging to us and our posteritythat is, our childrenwe decided to give it to strangers. We have spit on the graves of our fathers. We've broken the Fifth Commandment. Read the Founders in their writings. They bled out and died and sacrificed. They didn't do it for India. That doesn't mean they hated India, but they did it for us and our posterity. And for you, the children of your fathers who died for you as their children, to say, 'Dad died for me and the kids, and we're going to take it and give it to strangers,' that is dishonoring dad!

Yeah thats what it feels like with this crowd! Its truly insane that the American Christian church has lost its way since the rise of Rush Limbaugh and Jimmy Swaggart. Now theyre banking on the Dark One and his disgusting overturning of Roe V Wade, despite that the three justices he appointed deliberately and maliciously lied under oath through their teeth saying they wouldnt. But when people are making completely outrageous claims like this is what our founding fathers would have wanted, they are clearly talking straight out of their ass, and theres no reasoning with people like that! And Harris would never say that she hates Catholics. When did this conversation start? Just ugh its getting harder to keep up with their BS, my fair congregation! Former President Donald Trump is promoting a right-wing political group that supports a total abortion ban after the groups leader Brian Burch dishonestly smeared Vice President Kamala Harris on Fox News as he promoted the groups new swing-state ad attacking Harris. In contrast, Catholic Vote praised Trumps selection of J.D. Vance as a historic moment and called Vance a hero. Burch claimed on Fox that Harris has an unmistakable record of deep hostility and hatred for Catholics and what Catholics believe, a charge he repeated in an email Monday. Responding to Trump cheering on Catholic Vote on social media, the group tweeted, Were proud to expose Kamalas vile hatred of Catholics. Burch is lying, of course. Harris serves as vice president to the second Catholic U.S. president. Burch tends to demean the faith of Catholics who disagree with the groups political positions by producing \"dossiers\" on them or using square quotes when identifying them as \"Catholic.\" Back when Barack Obama chose Biden as his running mate, Burch called the selection of a pro-choice Catholic a slap in the face to Catholic voters.

Do not pass Go, do not collect $200. Also, make no mistake that the anti-abortion movement is really a white supremacist movement but with a different label. They made that pretty clear with Project 2025. And no, Pastor Webbon, the United States Of America doesnt just belong to you. Thats a terrible statement to make. It belongs to all of us. Yes, even the brainwashed cultists too. And when supposed faith leaders keep selling themselves out for the unholy Dark One, you can bet its a sure reason why we cant have nice things in this country and that theres a black cloud currently hovering over it. Earlier this year, far-right conspiracy theorist and self-proclaimed \"alpha toxic male\" Clay Clark announced that he was working to place a \"prophet\" in Donald Trump's cabinet if the former president returns to the White House. Clark is positioned to potentially do this because he has forged close ties to Trump's son, Eric, through the \"ReAwaken America\" tour Clark had been parading around the nation for the last several years. Launched in 2021 as a \"Reopen America\" event in Oklahoma that was designed to protest restrictions put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was such a success that Clark quickly rechristened it \"ReAwaken America\" and launched a nationwide tour, holding similar events all over the country. Convinced that a vague 2013 prophecy from the late prophet Kim Clement about a man by the name of Mr. Clark and another man by the name of Donald was a prophecy about himself and Donald Trump, Clark's events quickly became a nonstop cavalcade of outlandish conspiracy theories and explicitly violent rhetoric mixed with aggressive Christian nationalism.

Its the shit show that never ends! Mass has ended, may you go in peace! Thats it this week for: [div style=\"padding: 20px; background-color: # ; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px 1px #aaa;\"][div style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica; font-weight: bold; border-bottom: 1px dotted #999; padding-bottom: 8px;\"] [font size=\"8\"]This Fucking Guy: Jack Hibbs [br] [/font] [br] This weeks This Fucking Guy is Jack Hibbs. You may have heard his name before if you follow the TPUSA verse, or as I like to call them the Toilet Paper Verse. Hes the pastor of Cavalry Church in Chino Hills, of which theres about a billion Cavalry Churches to choose from. But if your church employs a pastor like this, two things we would suggest. The first is to know what their churchs after hours activities are, and the second is you should probably find a new church. Because this guy has his lips planted firmly on Donald Trumps ass, and it will probably take a crowbar to pry them off. Which is why we say that any church who tells you who to vote for should immediately lose its tax exempt status. This guy is certifiably nuts, and hes definitely far from the Christian that he claims to be. Hes a Trump worshipper and his MAGA cult credentials are strong. In fact if you ever listen to his podcast for more than a few minutes without wanting to smash your phone into pieces, youll definitely pick up a few insane tidbits about the MAGAgelical lifestyle. Like this for instance. California megachurch pastor Jack Hibbs, a close ally of right-wing Christian nationalist political operatives David Lane and Charlie Kirk, declared on his podcast last week that people who vote for Democrats cannot be Christians. Hibbs influence stretches beyond his congregation through his political alliances and online followers; his YouTube channel has 659,000 subscribers. Earlier this year, House Speaker Mike Johnson invited Hibbs to give a prayer to the House of Representatives. From an edition of his Real Life with Jack Hibbs podcast posted Aug 1: Democrats, sorry. Look, I gotta tell you man, Im gonna say it again, you cannot be a Democrat and be a believer in Jesus Christ. You can lie to yourself all you want. Jesus Christ is not an abortionist. Jesus Christ does not attack borders and say they dont matter. The God of the Bible established borders, he says so. The God of the Bible is pro-life, he says so. So, if youre a Democrat, and you say youre a Christian, that means you vote Democrat, which means you vote against the Bible. Actions speak louder than words. So, I have no interest in you. In reality, of course, millions of Christians regularly vote for Democratic candidates, which apparently rankles Hibbs almost as much as conservative evangelicals who vote, something he has been complaining about for years. On last weeks podcast he railed against conservative Christians in California who dont vote, saying I have so much more respect for Democrats who go out and vote in huge numbers for their sick, perverse ideology, their godless platform. Hibbs has previously referred to the Democratic Party as a death cult. From an edition of his Real Life with Jack Hibbs podcast posted Aug 1: Democrats, sorry.

Oh come right the fuck on. Were the death cult? Have you been following MAGA lately? Were at the point where if Trump instructed his minions to jump off the Grand Canyon, theyd be pushing and shoving to be the first in line. But in case youre wondering if the line between church and cult is getting weirder and nuttier, look no further than Jack Hibbs and what he said about the Trump assassination attempt. Oh come on, if there ever were a reason why churches should be taxed the ever-loving shit out of, look no further than this. And also, if you dont doubt the Trump assassination attempt was staged, they literally had t-shirts made the next day with that stupid picture on them! I mean come on, its truly insane what they are saying and getting away with. Jack Hibbs, a far-right anti-LGBTQ pastor, conspiracy theorist, and Christian nationalist, delivered a special sermon Sunday in response to the failed assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump the day before. Clad in a \"colonial preachers robe\" meant to the emulate the apocryphal \"Black Robe Regiment\" that supposedly rallied the colonists to rebel against England during the American revolution, Hibbs said he only breaks out the garb in \"times of tyranny.\" We are in just such a time right now, said Hibbs, prompting him to deliver a rather strange sermon in which he referenced a passage from the book of Leviticus instructing priests to anoint the toe, thumb, and right ear of those making a guilt offering with blood, which Hibbs tied to the injury Trump received from the shooting. \"God said all those who represent me in the priesthood, there's to be a sacrificial basin of blood,\" Hibbs said. \"And I want the toe of the priest to be dipped in the bloodthe big toe, the right toedipped in blood. I want the priest's thumb dipped in blood because his feet and his decision making is covered in my blood. And then take the blood from the basin and put it on your right ear.\" Clad in a \"colonial preachers robe\" meant to the emulate the apocryphal \"Black Robe Regiment\" that supposedly rallied the colonists to rebel against England during the American revolution, Hibbs said he only breaks out the garb in \"times of tyranny.\" We are in just such a time right now, said Hibbs, prompting him to deliver a rather strange sermon in which he referenced a passage from the book of Leviticus instructing priests to anoint the toe, thumb, and right ear of those making a guilt offering with blood, which Hibbs tied to the injury Trump received from the shooting. \"God said all those who represent me in the priesthood, there's to be a sacrificial basin of blood,\" Hibbs said. \"And I want the toe of the priest to be dipped in the bloodthe big toe, the right toedipped in blood.

That is totally, criminally insane. Like straight jacket and padded cell insane. And these are the guys who say that GOD WILL NOT BE MOCKED!! while they literally mock god by saying stupid shit like this. And if you think mocking god is a problem, wait until you see our sister program Holy Shit: The Sunday Sermons! But hey, we dont mock god. We mock the god will not be mocked people, so thats mocking inception! Mock-ception? But anyway, Jack Hibbs first gained prominence last year when he admitted that he was the one responsible for flipping the Chino Hills school board to batshit crazy MAGA loons last year. And well, you should never question Christian nationalists, oh no! What will independent thinkers do now? Jack Hibbs is a far-right anti-LGBTQ pastor, conspiracy theorist, and Christian nationalist who was invited by House Speaker Mike Johnson to deliver a prayer to the House of Representatives last month. That decision understandably did not sit well with several House members who denounced Hibbs' views and questioned why he had been invited to speak in the first place. Last week, Hibbs appeared on \"The Line Up\" program to discuss the controversy, where he declared that those who criticize or oppose Christian nationalism are a \"systemic cancer\" in this nation and are carrying out the agenda of \"the Third Reich under Hitler.\" \"The people that are labeling us as Christian nationalists are the ones who are for the destruction of the gender of a child's biological birth,\" Hibbs said. \"They're anti-family. They're pro-LBGTQ. They are anti-borders.\" \"They all have this also in common,\" he continued. \"They always mention democracy; they will never mention constitutional republic. They are for everyone's rights and freedoms except those who they disagree with. These are literal cancers in a culture. These people are systematiccan I use their word?systemic cancers.\" Last week, Hibbs appeared on \"The Line Up\" program to discuss the controversy, where he declared that those who criticize or oppose Christian nationalism are a \"systemic cancer\" in this nation and are carrying out the agenda of \"the Third Reich under Hitler.\" \"The people that are labeling us as Christian nationalists are the ones who are for the destruction of the gender of a child's biological birth,\" Hibbs said. \"They're anti-family.

Cults dont like that! Yeah its like how can they say in one breath that god will not be mocked and then in the next minute, they think Trump is Jesus and that democratic thought is a cancer? Shit thats going pure Nazi! And Systematic Cancer, by the way, awesome punk band. I saw them at the Troubadour last week. And if you think we havent reached the pinnacle of Mr. Hibbs insanity, wait until you see what he said about the recent hurricanes that wreaked havoc on the Gulf Coast. Yes, he actually went there, and yes, he is that crazy. But again, they worship a guy who stared at an eclipse and used a sharpie to draw the path of a hurricane. Also that you dont have rights if you speak up against the Murdoch cult. Jack Hibbs, a far-right anti-LGBTQ pastor, conspiracy theorist, and Christian nationalist, posted a video on his YouTube channel earlier this week in which he lashed out at the protests that have sprung up on college campuses around the country in opposition to the ongoing war in Gaza. Hibbs, an ardent Christian Zionist whose own support for Israel is riddled with antisemitism, declared that these campus activists have no First Amendment right to protest because, by virtue of protesting, they are proving that they are not even real Americans. \"This morning, I turned on the news and I watched the idiocy of the news mediafrom channel to channel to channel covering Columbia University and NYUsay the same thing: 'You know, they're just expressing their First Amendment rights. This is the First Amendment in action,'\" Hibbs sneered. \"Those are the words of fools. Fools!\" \"We've got people who I believe have forfeited their rights to the First Amendment,\" Hibbs declared. \"They don't have the First Amendment [right] to do what they're doing on over 220 university campuses.\" Hibbs, an ardent Christian Zionist whose own support for Israel is riddled with antisemitism, declared that these campus activists have no First Amendment right to protest because, by virtue of protesting, they are proving that they are not even real Americans. \"This morning, I turned on the news and I watched the idiocy of the news mediafrom channel to channel to channel covering Columbia University and NYUsay the same thing: 'You know, they're just expressing their First Amendment rights.

Of course conspiracies exist when people simply dont want to read the article past the headlines and just flat out make shit up. We of course are coming to you live from our underground doomsday shelter from deep within the New Mexico badlands. Undisclosed location, of course! Let me just adjust my trusty tin foil hat for maximum government interference. Ah, there we go! They are trying to read yours and my thoughts, after all! This week, were going to talk about Texas. The Lone Star State. Yes, the polls are showing Texas trending increasingly purple, when it was once a hard red state. And the GOP doesnt want to admit that theres a very real possibility that Texas could flip for Kamala Harris. But the two guys at the helm of the Lone Star State governor Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton are hatching a scheme to keep their jobs, as well as make sure that their employers - Fox News and their hard right wing stranglehold on that state remains pure. Abbott and Paxton both have decreasing approval ratings, and like fellow Fox News employee Ted Cruz, are not very well liked. Well, remember when Arizona was at the center of a bizarre auditing plot in the 2020 election (see: Idiots #10-12 ). Well, the 2024 Texas election scam, er, scheme, looks to make the Cyber Ninjas look like Cyber MMA trainees. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Well heres more. Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo is perhaps best known for spreading the baseless claim on air that Dominion Voting Systems rigged the 2020 presidential election. Her source for that information was a viewer who also claimed to be internally decapitated and said she spoke with the wind. Along with similar misinformation, this false claim landed Fox in court for defamation, and the company agreed to pay an unprecedented $787 million settlement to Dominion. But last month, Bartiromo returned to reporting baseless hearsay again, this time to cast doubt on the upcoming election. On August 18, she claimed on social media that the wife of a friend of a friend went to a DMV in Weatherford, Texas, and saw a massive line of immigrants getting licenses and a tent and table outside the front door of the DMV registering them to vote! Apparently the same Dems were registering immigrants to vote outside other DMVs in the area as well. Without explanation or evidence, the post insinuated that something nefarious must be going on because the people at the DMV appeared to be immigrants. Law enforcement and even the local Republican Party completely debunked Bartiromos rumor. A spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, which issues drivers licenses in the state, pointed out that assuming people are undocumented immigrants based on solely on their appearance is kind of racist.

You know what we say around here is that if you have to ask, its probably racist! I mean sigh. This is why we cant have nice things in this country, like functioning elections. And come on, the election is two weeks away and we have to get our shit together! Because everyone knows that if the election is even remotely close, you know damn well that Fox News and the Heritage Foundation are going to make a plan to steal it, and we cannot let that happen under any circumstances, because its the end of democracy if that happens! But what the election rah rah poll watching people need to realize its not election integrity. Its voter suppression. And that industry is currently booming right now as misinformation is running rampant. Voting rights activists in Texas are accusing the states Republican leaders of limiting access to the ballot and cracking down on groups mobilizing and registering voters in the name of election integrity. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, authorized searches over the weekend on the homes of several members of one of the oldest Latino civil rights groups. And on Monday, Republican Gov. Gregg Abbott announced that 1 million people had been removed from the states voter rolls. The officials say the moves were made to guard against the possibility of fraud at the polls, but activist groups insist they are the latest examples of a growing trend of voter suppression thats been brewing in the state following President Joe Bidens 2020 electoral victory. And now with less than 70 days until the election, the groups are warning that voters will have an even harder time casting a ballot in November.

Well, thats a very qood question and we dont have an answer for that. But we do have to say that it will be extremely fun to watch all of the talking points weve been force fed about election security and integrity blow up in their faces on November 5th. The League of United Latin American Citizens in Texas is calling for a federal investigation into an effort by state Attorney General Ken Paxton's office to ferret out illegal voter registration operations, which the civil rights group argues is meant to disenfranchise Latino voters via \"police state tactics.\" While Paxton's office has recently initiated a series of \"undercover operations to identify potential voter registration of noncitizens in Texas,\" Gabriel Rosales, state director for Texas LULAC, said in a statement Friday that the office had gone too far by targeting the homes of older citizens and LULAC members in South Texas. \"I have been contacted by elderly residents who are confused and frightened, wondering why they have been singled out,\" Rosales said. \"Attorney General Paxton's actions clearly aim to suppress the Latino vote through intimidation and any means necessary to tilt the electoral process in favor of his political allies.\" While Paxton's office has recently initiated a series of \"undercover operations to identify potential voter registration of noncitizens in Texas,\" Gabriel Rosales, state director for Texas LULAC, said in a statement Friday that the office had gone too far by targeting the homes of older citizens and LULAC members in South Texas. \"I have been contacted by elderly residents who are confused and frightened, wondering why they have been singled out,\" Rosales said. \"Attorney General Paxton's actions clearly aim to suppress the Latino vote through intimidation and any means necessary to tilt the electoral process in favor of his political allies.\" https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/state/2024/08/23/ken-paxton-texas-attorney-general-voter-fraud-investigation-lulac-seeks-federal-probe/74923123007/Yeah thats the fucking irony of this whole thing. If you watch Fox News, and actually believe the bullshit they spew on a daily basis, youd think the sky is falling. But if you actually read, turn off that poisonous network, and think for yourself, youll be like Where is all of this shit happening?. Because Fox News can scream bloody murder all they want that their precious man baby didnt win in 2020, and that they wont let it happen again. The reality is that your chances of finding an actual case of real voter fraud are like slim to nil. Were talking like maybe 1 case out of 20,000. You have better odds of winning the Powerball and getting struck by lightning. But please, GOP, keep going there. Its only going to hurt you in the long run. Texans who may have been wrongly removed from the state's voter registration list or whose voter registrations have been suspended have little time to reverse course, Democratic state lawmakers and civil rights advocates warned Thursday, a few days after Republican leadership announced the purge of more than 1.1 million names from their voter rolls. States are required by law to regularly update their voter registration lists to remove people who have died or moved or who are found ineligible to vote for other reasons. But Republican Gov. Greg Abbott touted the routine maintenance of the voter rolls in a series of election integrity bills he signed into laws in 2021. \"Texas strong election laws removed over 1 MILLION ineligible voters from our voter rolls,\" Abbott wrote Monday on X. Numbers released by Abbotts office show that more than 134,000 voters purged from state voter rolls since September 2021 had confirmed they had moved elsewhere and that 457,000 others had died.

    "text": "Science committee chair “surprised” by original decision to put Horizon costs in Dsit budget\nChi Onwurah, newly elected chair of the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee, has warned that any reduction in the UK research budget would send a negative message to potential investors.\nResearch Professional News has revealed sector concerns that an increase in costs related to UK membership of Horizon Europe, the EU research and innovation programme, could add up to £1 billion of spending into the existing Department for Science, Innovation and Technology budget. Sector sources fear that an effective cut to the research budget on that scale could leave UK Research and Innovation unable to make new grants in 2025-26 .\nSpeaking to journalists during a briefing at the Science Media Centre in London on 24 October, Onwurah spoke about those fears for the research budget.\nShe said: “I can’t see how it [an effective cut] wouldn’t send a negative message to potential investors, and also how the government would meet its commitments while cutting research and development and innovation funding—it would be extremely challenging.”\nOn wider science spending, Onwurah said she was keen to work with the National Audit Office so “we can understand better” what is “actually being spent on science as a country”, as well as better understand the return on investment from research spending.\nShe added: “We need a clearer understanding… so we can build a public consensus to continue investing in science, and perhaps invest more in science.”\nHorizon association\nAsked about the possibility that Horizon association costs could end up forcing cuts to domestic research funding, Onwurah said: “I’ve seen these headlines [about Horizon]… Dsit explained [during association talks] quite categorically that Horizon spending would come out of Dsit budgets, and it’s in the last line of the Horizon agreement.”\nShe added: “I’d say that I was surprised at the time that more fuss wasn’t made about it… Andrew Griffith [the former science minister] says there was a commitment for the Treasury to cover it [the cost of Horizon association]. And one of the things I’m very interested to find out is where that commitment was, what line it was coming out of, and what budget it was coming out of, because it wasn’t something that, to my knowledge, was announced.”\nOn UK association to Framework Programme 10, the potential successor to Horizon Europe, Onwurah said: “Being part of Horizon has huge advantages, and the way in which it also brings in research and businesses gives us access to bigger markets and opportunities.\n“It is my start position that that would be something the UK hugely wants to be a part of. But all the funding has to be justified.\n“It’s so important that the public understand the benefits science and technology bring in,” continued Onwurah, reiterating that cutting the science budget overall would “send the wrong kind of message”.\n“It’s important that we are part of the conversation on FP10,” she added, “and that our fantastic strengths in science and technology are folded into that.”",

    "text": "Laverne Cox has called out the Republican party for “going all-in on their transphobia” this election season. You can watch her full speech below.\nREAD MORE: Soundtrack Of My Life: Laverne Cox The 52-year-old actor and activist, who shot to fame after playing trans inmate Sophia on the Netflix drama Orange is the New Black , used her recent appearance on The Daily Show to raise awareness of the disinformation surrounding anti-trans legislation and campaigning.\nDuring the appearance, Cox drew attention to the surge in anti-LGBTQIA+ legislation across the US, including the 25 stats that banned transgender under-18s from accessing gender-affirming care.\n“Thanks for making sure schools don’t teach about sexual orientation or gender identity, because pretending trans kids don’t exist means they disappear, just like pretending climate change doesn’t exist… it disappears too!,” she said, before jokingly adding, “So I guess we will never know why my tits are sweating in December.”\nCox then highlighted that Donald Trump and the Republican part have spent $65 million (£49 million) on campaign ads pushing anti-trans rhetoric.\nHitting back at the ads, Cox said: “Do you know how disappointing it is for someone to finally spend $65 million on me and it’s for this crap? I didn’t want hateful attack ads. I wanted a house in the Hills with six walk-in closets!”\nShe continued: “This is straight out of the bigotry handbook, using dehumanising language on marginalised groups provides a permission structure to attack them, because, when people are rendered no longer human, you can take away their rights, [and] commit violence against them with impunity.”\nCox went on to reference the ongoing legal dispute between North Carolina lieutenant governor Mark Robinson and CNN, which reported in September that the Republican left a series of disturbing comments on a pornography website before entering politics. Robinson, who is taking legal action against the outlet, strongly denied the claims before admitted that he enjoys watching trans pornography.\nCox joked about the situation: “If you had told me anti-trans politicians were secretly watching – and loving – trans porn, I would’ve said, ‘Duh.’\n“I’m 52 years old and if I had a dime for every conservative man who’s tried to get with me, I could buy that house in the Hills.”\nShe added: “Turning us into sex objects is just another way of dehumanising us. And I think it’s time to stop dehumanising and start rehumanising each other.”\nCox then showed a map suggesting that the top searches for trans porn are all in red states, before concluding: “We see you. We see all of you. All we ask is that you see us, too. And that you pull your damn pants up.”\nEarlier this week, Veep star Julia Louis Dreyfus launched her own criticism of Donald Trump and the Republican party over women’s rights in America.\nTaking to social media, the actress said in a video: “They want to reach into our doctors’ offices and our bedrooms to control our access to birth control and IVF and, of course, abortion – even though they wouldn’t know a uterus if they had to crawl out of one for a second time.”\nLouis-Dreyfus went on to urge people to vote for Harris before adding: “Because, I don’t know about you, but I’d really like to get the government out of my fucking snatch.”",

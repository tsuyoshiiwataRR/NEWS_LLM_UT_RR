There’s been a massive spike in political robocalls as we get closer to Election Day, and Arizona is leading the pack. According to Transaction Network Services, these calls are soaring in battleground states. For example, in the first two weeks of October, TNS said Arizonans received 1,008,482 political robocalls. “Arizona has seen something like an 800% increase relative to what you saw, even two weeks ago, so hold onto your hat. We’ve got a couple weeks left,” said John Haraburda, the director of product management for identity and protection at TNS. “Where we see it right now is about two-thirds of what I expect it to be in another couple of weeks, so things are ramping up.” The Federal Communications Commission says campaign calls are exempt from the national Do Not Call registry, but there are rules campaigns must follow. Political calls and texts that are auto-dialed or prerecorded are prohibited on cell phones without prior permission. Texts sent manually and robocalls to landlines are permitted, even without prior consent. In addition to legal political calls, voters are also facing scam calls, and this has become a big concern. A new survey by TNS shows that 60% of adults believe robocalls and robotexts are being used to undermine confidence in the presidential election, and 71% of Americans believe a voter in a battleground state is more likely to be targeted by an AI deepfake robocall than a voter in a non-battleground state. “We do see some significant numbers, where it’s in the range of 10% to 20% of total traffic is being tagged as spam and being identified and reported to consumers for that, and this is across every single phone call happening,” Haraburda said. “The problem is is that the average consumer will have no idea that it’s an AI generated call, especially a voice call. It’s very difficult to discern a recording vs an AI generated call.” Call blockers are doing a better job of catching spam, but if an unwanted call gets through, you can swipe left to block the number and report it as junk. The FCC says if you receive a text message you don’t want, you can report the sender by forwarding the text to 7726 or ‘SPAM.’ Campaigns should also honor opt-out requests if you reply ‘STOP.’ See a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

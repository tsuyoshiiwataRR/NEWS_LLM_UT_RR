    "text": "Caracas, Oct 20 (EFE).- The six Venezuelan opponents who took refuge in the residence of the Argentine embassy last March, after the Prosecutor’s Office accused them of conspiracy and other crimes, will meet this Sunday seven months locked up, without any signs of a change in their situation, at least in the short term.\nThe asylum seekers are Pedro Urruchurtu, Magalli Meda, Claudia Macero, Humberto Villalobos – all members of the Vente Venezuela (VV) party, led by María Corina Machado -, the former MP Omar González and Fernando Martínez Mottola, councilor of the main opposition coalition , Democratic United Platform (PUD).\nIn this regard, VV reiterated that these people “are persecuted because they exercise political rights and work for free elections”, alluding to the presidential elections of July 28, in which the National Electoral Council (CNE) proclaimed the controversial victory of Nicolás Maduro . not recognized by many countries.\nThrough the opposition.\nOn several occasions, anti-Chavismo has called for “an end to the persecution” against opponents who are in the Argentine diplomatic headquarters, especially after Venezuela revoked in September the authorization granted to Brazil to represent Argentina’s interests in Caracas .\nAfter the expulsion of the Argentine diplomatic representation by Maduro’s executive, following questions about the election result, Brazil agreed to garrison the southern country’s premises on Venezuelan territory, an agreement that Caracas suspended due to the alleged planning of terrorist acts asylum seekers within these premises.\nThe Argentine government said it is “moving forward” so that the six opponents “have absolutely no inconvenience”, despite the current circumstances.\n.\n#Opposition #refugees #Argentine #embassy #Venezuela #locked #months",

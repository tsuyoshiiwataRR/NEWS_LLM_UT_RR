    "text": "By Marshall Cohen and Shania Shelton, CNN Published 8:43 AM EDT, Thu October 24, 2024 Elon Musks super PAC didnt announce a winner for its daily $1 million giveaway to registered swing state voters on Wednesday, the same day news broke that the Justice Department warned Musks group that its sweepstakes might be illegal. The pro-Trump group, America PAC, had publicly named a winner every day since Saturday, when Musk announced that he would award $1 million every day to people who sign his petition. The petition is in support of the 1st and 2nd Amendments to the Constitution, but importantly, only registered voters in the battleground states can sign the petition and are therefore eligible for the money. CNN reported Wednesday afternoon that the Justice Department had sent a warning letter to the super PAC, notifying it that the lottery might violate federal law against offering incentives such as cash or prizes to induce voter registration, people briefed on the matter told CNN ... https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/24/politics/elon-musk-super-pac-lottery-winner-doj-warning/index.html State gaming laws should apply as well. Not just election laws.",

    "text": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WICS) — The Illinois Department of Transportation, the Illinois State Police and local law enforcement are reminding motorists to not be drive impaired this Halloween because the consequences could be frightening and deadly for you and others. The key messages are simple: “Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over,” and “If You Drive High, You’ll Get a DUI.” “Stay safe this Halloween by planning ahead. If you’re planning to drink, use cannabis or consume any other drug, make sure you have a plan to get home without driving,” said Stephane B. Seck-Birhame, bureau chief of Safety Programs and Engineering at IDOT. “Arrange for a cab, rideshare, mass transit or designate a sober driver before the party starts.” As of October 11, 898 people have died on Illinois roads, according to IDOT provisional data – 87 fewer than on the same date a year ago. However, while crash fatalities are lower than this time last year, they are significantly higher than they were in 2020 and previous years. “There’s no trick to avoiding a DUI,” said ISP Division of Patrol Col. Chris Owen. “If you drink or drive high, we’ll treat you to a DUI this Halloween.” Before donning your costume, plan for a safe way home. Other important tips:",

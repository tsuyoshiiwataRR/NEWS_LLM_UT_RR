    "text": "WASHINGTON (7News) — The District of Columbia’s city council is digging through D.C. Public Schools (DCPS) accounts. In a marathon six-hour hearing Wednesday, D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson questioned DCPS’ management of public money. Despite a proposed $192 million boost to the school system's budget, more than half of the District's schools face cuts, including fewer staff positions and larger class sizes.

Mendelson expressed frustration over why DCPS appears to pay more per hour for security services than other city agencies. “I’m trying to figure out how you’re controlling for costs, and I’m not seeing it,” Mendelson said.

The exchange highlighted the ongoing tension between school leadership and city officials over budget management, as both sides attempt to navigate increasing operational costs, dwindling federal relief funds, and growing demands for financial accountability from their constituents.",

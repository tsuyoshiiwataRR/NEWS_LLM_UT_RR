    "text": "The Islamabad District and Sessions Court judge went to his chambers without ruling on Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founders Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi ‘s appeals against their convictions in the Iddat marriage case. The reserved judgment on the appeals against the sentence in the Iddat Nikah case is expected to be delivered today.\nIt should be noted that on May 23, 2024, the court had reserved its decision on the appeals of PTI founder and Bushra Bibi in the Iddat marriage case after arguments by lawyers on both sides.\nAt the start of the hearing, Khawar Manika ‘s lawyer Rizwan Abbasi was again absent. On Justice Shahrukh Arjamand’s request, the assistant lawyer said he was in the Supreme Court. The judge granted time to Rizwan Abbasi to appear in court.\nSessions Judge Shahrukh Arjamand heard the appeals of PTI founder and Bushra Bibi, during which Bushra Bibi’s lawyer Usman Gul and complainant Khawar’s lawyer Manika Rizwan Abbasi appeared as legal assistant.\nThe complainant’s legal assistant had told the court that Rizwan Abbasi had to give his arguments, the record was not with him.\nIt may be recalled that on February 3, 2024, Senior Civil Judge Qudratullah issued a short verdict in the IDT matrimonial case and sentenced PTI founders and Bushra Bibi to 7 years in prison. The court also imposed a fine of five lakh rupees on PTI founder and Bushra Bibi.\nIt should be noted that Bushra Bibi’s ex-husband Khawar Manika appeared before the court of Civil Judge Qudrat in Islamabad on November 25 and filed a case against Imran Khan and his wife for Idda marriage and illicit relations, petition section 494. / 34 , filed under B-496 and other provisions.\nIn the petition it was stated that I belong to Manika family of Pakpattan, I was married to Bushra Bibi in 1989 which was good and smooth until Imran Khan moved to Islamabad through Bushra Bibi’s sister in law did not intervene during the sit-in wedding, the applicant, who resides in the United Arab Emirates and believes he has strong ties to the Jewish lobby.\nKhawar Manika had stated that the PTI president had entered the house of the complainant in the guise of Pari Muridi and started visiting the house frequently even in his absence\nThe petition further stated that as time passed, Imran Khan had started meddling in their marital life, despite being warned and even kicked out of the house inappropriately.\nKhawar Manika had told in the application that one day when she suddenly went to her house, she saw that Zulfi Bukhari was alone in her bedroom, she also often came with Imran Khan.\nIn the application he had stated that Bushra Bibi had started going to Bani Gala without my permission, even though I had tried to stop him by force, and there were also harsh sentences.\nIt was further written that Bushra Bibi was in possession of various mobile phones and SIM cards, which were given to him by Farah Gogi on the instructions of the PTI Chairman.\nKhawar Manika has stated in the petition that before the so-called marriage both of them had illicit relations with each other, a fact which employee Latif told me.\nThe petition further stated that efforts had been made to improve the situation for the good of the family but all had failed and the complainant had filed for divorce on November 14, 2017.\nAccording to Khawar Manika’s request, Bushra Bibi got married to Imran Khan on 1 January 2018 during Eid-ul-Fitr, this marriage is illegal and against Islamic teachings.\nIt was further written that after the fact of marriage during Iddat came to light, both of them got remarried in February 2018 through Mufti Saeed, so it is a serious crime under section 496/496B of Pakistan Penal Code, both of them were eloped before marriage.\nThe petition demanded that Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi be summoned and punished severely according to the constitution and law.\nOn December 11, the Islamabad local court declared the illegal marriage case filed by Khawar Manika against Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi admissible.\n#judge #left #ruling #appeals #sentences",

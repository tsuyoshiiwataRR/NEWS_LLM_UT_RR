    "text": "Shittu mentioned this when he was a guest on Channels Television programme on Thursday. A former Minister of Communications, Adebayo Shittu, has stated that the new ministers appointed by President Bola Tinubu are not better than the ones he sacked. Shittu who served during the first tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari said the cabinet shake-up implemented by Tinubu on Wednesday was more politically motivated than bringing in superior minds as ministers into the Federal Executive Council (FEC). Shittu mentioned this when he was a guest on Channels Television programme on Thursday. “If you look at the changes we had yesterday (Wednesday), I doubt whether it is necessarily bringing in superior minds or better minds, in terms of governance, in terms of expectations, in terms of performance,” Shittu said. “As far as I am concerned, it is just a case of some Nigerians being asked to move on, some other Nigerians are being brought in, which does not necessarily mean that those who have been shoved aside are inferior to the new people being brought in.” Recall that President Bola Tinubu appointed Bianca Odinaka Odumegu-Ojukwu, wife of late Biafra hero, Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu and six others as his new ministers. The appointment was announced in a statement issued by the presidency after the federal executive council meeting on Wednesday. Bianca Odinaka Odumegu-Ojukwu was appointed as minister of state foreign affairs while Jumoke Oduwole was named the minister of industry, trade and investment. Others are: Muhammadu Maigari Dingyadi, Federal Ministry of Labour & Employment; Idi Mukhtar Maiha, Federal Ministry of Livestock Development; Hon. Yusuf Abdullahi Ata, Minister of State, Federal Ministry of Housing and Urban Development; and Suwaiba Said Ahmad, Minister of State Education.",

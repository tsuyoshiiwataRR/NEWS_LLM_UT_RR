    "text": "York notary charged in petition fraud case argues to have it tossed LINCOLN, Neb. (KOLN) - The notary public from York charged in a petition fraud case is arguing to have it tossed. Jacy Todd, 53, is facing [24 misdemeanor counts](https://www.1011now.com/2024/10/02/two-dozen-charges-filed-against-york-notary-public-petition-fraud-case/) of official misconduct for notarizing signatures gathered by Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana without the presence of [Michael Egbert](https://www.1011now.com/2024/09/13/grand-island-man-charged-after-nebraska-ag-finds-fake-signatures-medical-marijuana-petitions/). Todd’s attorney is arguing that notaries public are not government employees and therefore cannot be charged with official misconduct. They also argue that the Nebraska Legislature has designated civil penalties for those who fail to strictly follow the notarial process requirements. Hall County Court has given the Nebraska Attorney General‘s Office until Nov. 7 to file a response, and Todd’s council will have the opportunity to file a response to it by Nov. 14. The judge handling the case will then take everything under advisement and decide what happens next. In short, the State has charged Todd with crimes based on alleged acts that do not constitute a crime under Nebraska law. If the State has evidence that Todd committed intentional fraud, there are a litany of applicable criminal statutes that may be applicable. As it stands, though, the State has elected—presumably because it has no evidence of intentional fraud despite insinuating publicly that Todd’s actions were somehow more nefarious—to charge Todd with crimes based only on his purported failure to strictly follow the requirements of the notarial process—conduct the legislature chose to address only through civil remedies under Neb. Rev. Stat. §64-113. Because the State has not alleged conduct that constitutes a crime under Nebraska law, Todd’s motion to quash should be sustained and the matter promptly dismissed. Egbert is accused of fabricating 202 signatures on a few dozen petition sheets. He brought those signatures to Todd at a dispensary in Grand Island, and authorities say Todd notarized the signatures without the presence of Egbert. Egbert faces a felony count of false swearing to a circulator’s affidavit.

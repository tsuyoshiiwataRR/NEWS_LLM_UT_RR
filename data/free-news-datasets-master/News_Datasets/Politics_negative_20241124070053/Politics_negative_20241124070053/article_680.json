    "text": "There May Be Someone At The White House With More Contempt For A Colleague Than John Kelly Has For His Boss\nImagine sitting across the Cabinet table from someone who could have saved you from a $100 million loss.\n- •\n- Updated:· Original:\nThere are lots of reasons why meetings of the United States Cabinet might be awkward. For one, Donald Trump speaks at them.\nSteve MnuchinandWilbur Ross, too. AlsoBen Carson. When Scott Pruitt pulls up to the White House in cars hecan’t possibly afford, it has to elicit a few groans. Everyone is swimming in a sea of incompetence, this combination of factors must make for some seriously unpleasant hours on the calendar of the oligopoly currently mismanaging the hell out of America, U.S.A.

And sitting across the Cabinet table from her isa guy who had a unique insight into how and why they lost that money. A guy with an arguably fiduciary duty to the DeVoses and Coxes and Rupert Murdoch and Carlos Slim and Bob Kraft and every other poor bastard who gave Holmes a nickel. And now, thanks tothis lawsuit, we know the extent of this particular Cabinet-level blood feud.High on the list is Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, whose family invested $100 million in the Silicon Valley blood-testing company, the documents show. Mrs. DeVos had previously disclosed that her family was a Theranos investor in a government filing, but the size of the investment wasn’t known.“The investment was made by many members of the DeVos family,” not just Mrs. DeVos, says Greg McNeilly, chief operating officer of Windquest Group, Mrs. DeVos and her husband’s family holding company. “To say they’re highly disappointed in Theranos as a company and an investment is an understatement.”\nAs if to make matters worse, while DeVos can only seem to generate",

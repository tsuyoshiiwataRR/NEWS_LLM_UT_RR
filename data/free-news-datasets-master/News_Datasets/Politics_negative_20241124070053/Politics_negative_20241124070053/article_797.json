Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Self-proclaimed ‘Secretary of Retribution’ calls for pro-Trump protest at empty Pa. Capitol Jordan Wilkie | WITF Oct 24, 2024 5 hrs ago Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Ivan Raiklin, who calls himself the would-be 'Secretary of Retribution' for a new Donald Trump administration, speaks about overturning election results at the Rod of Iron Freedom Festival.\nScreenshot from Rod of Iron Rumble page. Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link\nShould Democratic nominee Kamala Harris win the race for president, Ivan Raiklin would have Pennsylvania supporters of Donald Trump descend on the Capitol in Harrisburg on Dec. 1 in an attempt to overturn the results.\nHis goal, and that of other Trump supporters pushing false narratives about election fraud, is to pressure state lawmakers into appointing an alternate slate of electors to vote for the former president in the Electoral College.\n“I'm probably going to show up myself, with or without anybody,” Raiklin said to a crowd of a couple hundred people, at most.\nHe spoke at the Rod of Iron Ministries’ Freedom Festival, a pro-gun and pro-Trump event in northeastern Pennsylvania at which speakers repeatedly said Democrats were demonic and pushed anti-Semitic and racist conspiracies like the Great Replacement Theory. They declared that Trump is favored by god and that Democrats run an unseen but massive election rigging political machine.\nRaiklin calls himself Trump’s Secretary of Retribution and speaks about plans to use sheriffs to arrest an extensive list of officials involved in certifying Joe Biden’s 2020 electoral victory when Trump is returned to office.\nThere are both legal and practical problems with his plan.\n“The protesters will find empty chambers,” said Kyle Miller, a former senior Democratic staffer in the state legislature. “They will find a pretty empty building, in fact. There will not be anyone in the House at all.”\nMiller is now the state director for Protect Democracy, a nonprofit good governance group aiming to prevent the rise of authoritarianism in the United States.\nHe noted the Legislature simply won’t be in session. The entire state House is up for election every two years, while the Senate cycles through staggered four year terms. Though the Pennsylvania constitution says the term for newly elected members begins on Dec. 1 , it also says the legislative session doesn’t start until the first Tuesday in January .\nRaiklin and others who envision a role for the Legislature in overturning election results, seem to have missed that second part.\nMiller said calls to action based on false, and sometimes intentionally false, information can lead to violence.\n“The concern is not that the Legislature's actually going to overturn the will of Pennsylvania voters,” Miller said. “But in believing that is possible, these supporters are going to up the ante and they are going to raise the rhetoric to a point where political violence becomes possible.”\nClose Greg Stenstrom spoke at the Rod of Iron Freedom Festival about an inaccurate legal theory that would allow the state legislature or Congress to overturn election results should Vice President Kamala Harris win election on November 5. Stenstrom has worked with other conspiracists, notably Leah Hoopes, to raise doubt about the integrity of U.S. election administration.\nJordan Wilkie / WITF Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link A voter registration tent at the entrance to the Rod of Iron Freedom Festival.

He and other self-described true patriots envision themselves fighting a cabal of corrupt institutionalists. Failing to overturn the election results, impossible though it may be, would only confirm the impression that politicians can’t be trusted.\n“A lot of people will say, well, the Republicans in Pennsylvania State Senate are toxic, feckless, stone cold, coward, gutless, simp turds. And that's a true statement,” Raiklin said.\nIn order to convince them to overturn election results, he recommended “the most peaceful, patriotic, legal, moral, and ethical motivation of your state legislature to do the right thing. Large scale.”\nRaiklin is not alone in thinking, or at least claiming, that the Legislature can pick who gets Pennsylvania’s 19 Electoral College votes, regardless of how the state votes for president.\nGreg Stenstrom is an activist who operates mostly out of Montgomery County and claims to have found massive fraud in elections administration both from 2020 and the upcoming election. He believes Democrats stole the 2020 election and are prepared to do so again.\n“On November 5th and 6th, they probably are going to announce that Kamala Harris won, whether she wins or not,” Stenstrom said to the Rod of Iron crowd.\nHe told the crowd to take that in stride, because both the Legislature and Congress will have an opportunity to change the results and put Trump in office.\nThough 147 Republicans in Congress attempted to do just that on January 6, 2021, they failed, and a reform to the ECRA passed in 2022 shuts the door on the same strategy this time around.\nThe Pennsylvania Legislature has no role in certifying state level election results, according to Miller and state Senator Amanda Cappelletti, D-Montgomery County. As the minority chair of the Senate State Government Committee, she responded to questions on behalf of Democratic state senators.\n“[T]he General Assembly lacks the authority to take action to overturn the popular vote and appoint its own slate of presidential electors,” Jason Gottesman, press secretary for House Republican leader Bryan Cutler wrote in an email to LNP/WITF.\nNeither House Speaker Joanna McClinton’s office nor Senate Pro Tem Kim Ward’s office responded to questions for this story.\nNewsletter Success!

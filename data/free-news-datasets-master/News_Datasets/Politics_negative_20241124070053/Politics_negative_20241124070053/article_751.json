    "text": "CNN political commentator Van Jones is tired of people holding [Kamala Harris](https://hollywoodunlocked.com/?s=Kamala+Harris+) and Donald Trump to different standards. On Wednesday, Van Jones weighed in on the tight race between the two candidates. CNN’s Erin Burnett questioned Jones about a new report from The Wall Street Journal showing Trump is leading by nearly 10 percent in the upcoming election.

They’re not taking the same exam. He gets to be lawless. She has to be flawless. That’s what’s unfair.” “She has policies, she may not articulate them perfectly every time, she may not put the stories in the right places, but she’s fighting for actual ideas that will help real people, and he’s talking about peoples’ penises,” Jones added. Jones’ comments comes after a panel discussion on CNN took place about Harris’ performance at a town hall hosted by the network, where she took questions from undecided and persuadable voters in Pennsylvania, a key battleground in the election. Most recently, Kamala Harris has been slamming Donald Trump for his praise of Adolf Hitler. “It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler — the man who is responsible for the deaths of 6 million Jews, and hundreds of thousands of Americans,” Harris said from her residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington.

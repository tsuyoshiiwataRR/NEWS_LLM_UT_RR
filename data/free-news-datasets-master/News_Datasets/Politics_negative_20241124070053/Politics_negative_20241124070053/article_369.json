    "text": "With this appeal they turned to the Parliamentary Commission for Mandates, Ethics and Proposals .\nThe Presidium of the Saeima believes that in the meeting of October 10, regarding the changes to the electoral law of the City Council, Kiršteins made insulting and offensive statements .\n”[..] idiots without social responsibility, without thought and without education,” he said regarding the abilities of young people. Instead, she dedicated the words to new mothers:[..] how will those girls vote, let’s say if there are 400 of them… they are… you won’t deny them the right to vote if they don’t even know exactly who the father is, when the doctor asks them which father he can’t say or not”.\nThe Presidium believes that the statements cited may be perceived as a lack of respect.\nKirstein also made a comparison between “hunweibins” and age in the debate, pointing to his opponent. The expression ”[..] mostly the hunwebi were between 14 and 16 years old, well, they look like you, it’s a compliment for you” can be perceived as an attack on the opponent’s personality and physical characteristics, express the authors of the presentation.\nThe Saeima Presidium believes that Kirstein’s expressions, which included personal attacks and disrespectful comments towards public and opposition groups, clearly violate the parliamentarian’s code of ethics .\nThe commission responsible for the possible opening of the case will decide on Wednesday 23 October.\n#dont #father #proceeding #initiated #Kirštein #violation #code #ethics #statements #Saeima #session\n–",

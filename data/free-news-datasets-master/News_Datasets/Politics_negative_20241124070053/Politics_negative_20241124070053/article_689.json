    "text": "Reports reveal that the Taliban has expanded its ban on broadcasting images of living beings to at least ten provinces in Afghanistan.\nThe ban is now enforced in Kandahar, Helmand, Urozgan, Kunar, Khost, Takhar, Badghis, Panjshir, and Laghman.\nThis prohibition, part of the newly enacted “Promotion of Virtue” law, prohibits journalists and citizens from filming as well. According to this law, visual media outlets are barred from showing images of living beings.\nAs per Article 17 of the “Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice” law, filming living beings or sentient creatures is strictly prohibited.\nThe Taliban’s Ministry of Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, responsible for enforcing this law, has announced plans to gradually implement this ban across all of Afghanistan.\nInspectors from the Ministry are active in all 34 provinces, holding unprecedented authority to impose restrictions on media, women’s lives, and other citizens. Article 13 of this law defines women’s voices as “improper” and instructs women and girls to cover their faces.\nIn addition to these restrictions, the Taliban’s policies have severely limited women’s access to education and employment.\nAs Afghanistan faces a dire humanitarian crisis, these policies exacerbate the situation, leaving women and girls without opportunities for personal and professional development.\nThe international community continues to express concern over these developments, emphasizing the need for urgent action to protect the rights and futures of Afghan women and children.",

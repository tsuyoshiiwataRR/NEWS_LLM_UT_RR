    "text": "Jammu, Oct 24: A meeting of Traffic Police officers of Traffic City Jammu and Traffic Rural Jammu to review their preparedness to meet the winter traffic Police challenges was held at RTHQ Narwal Jammu under the chair of DIG Traffic Jammu Dr. Mohd. Haseeb Mughal, IPS. Vinay Kumar, JKPS Traffic Rural Jammu, Mohd. Faisal Qureshi, JKPS Traffic City Jammu, Arvinder Singh Kotwal, JKPS Addl. SP Traffic City Jammu, Voonesh Kumar, Sr. Prosecuting Officer RTHQ Jammu, Smt. Farah Nishat JKPS Dy.SP Traffic City North, Faisal Arif Rishu JKPS Dy.SP Traffic City South Jammu, Daljit Singh Dy.SP Traffic Rural Jammu, Sukhdev Singh Dy.SP Traffic Samba Kathua Range, Shri Ramesh Kataria Dy.SP (S) Private Secretary, Inspr. (S) Ruby Dhar-RTHQ Jammu and Inspr. Suraj Pathania Traffic City Jammu, Since the vehicular traffic pressure increases manifold in Jammu city due to the additional Govt activities in Jammu City coupled with huge migration of population to Jammu from across the J&K in view of winter season. The traffic Police functioning remains utmost significant to ensure that no traffic jamming takes place in Jammu city and overall life activities take place with ease. The deployment of traffic Police for the VIP routes and of other traffic congestion points were discussed. While addressing the officers, DIG Traffic Jammu said that in no case the essential services including medical emergencies should be affected during peak hours. The officers were directed to identify available places for parking of the vehicles and get them earmarked/notified so that people are made aware of the same in order to avoid traffic jamming on the routes during winter months. No old/junk-accidental/un warranted vehicle should remain parked on the road side, which many a times is not only a cause of traffic congestion but also contributes to serious accidents, he added. The traffic Police officers were directed to liaise with all private school managements and convey them that no parking of school vehicles shall be allowed on the road sides/streets. These school buses on public spaces is causing a great inconvenience to the general public and oftenly contribute to avoidable traffic congestions. Officers were also directed to liaise with road construction agencies and convey them not to occupy unwanted space of the roads wherever road construction work is going on, so that hassle free movement of the traffic is not hampered. The officers were advised to exercise maximum use of PA systems for public awareness with regard to traffic violations and other road safety measures. DIG Traffic Jammu also advised all the traffic Police officers immediately rush to the accident spot in their areas of responsibilities specially in case of fatal accidents for rescue purpose and to examine the accident spot to find out the cause of the accident as well as taking remedial measures for rectification of black spot, so that further chance of such accidents are minimized. No pressure horns be allowed in the transport vehicles, as which causes great inconvenience to the general public especially during late hours in residential areas, for which traffic Police officers should liaise with transport organizations for the awareness of the drivers and also aware them with regard to the traffic Police action against such menace, he added. It was made clear to all the officers that Traffic management during winters is always challenging and everybody has to put in his/her sincere and hard efforts to make it smooth.",

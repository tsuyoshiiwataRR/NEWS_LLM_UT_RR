    "text": "[Opinion](https://www.conservativedailynews.com/category/opinion-of-the-editor/) [Trending Commentary](https://www.conservativedailynews.com/category/trending-topics/featured-opinion/) TDS Makes Liz Cheney Forget Her Roots Liz Cheney, and possibly her father. Dick Cheney, too, are two Republicans who have tested positive for Trump Derangement Syndrome. They not only despise the former President, they outright hate him and will do whatever they can to prevent him from reelection. That includes abandoning all of their conservative roots and beliefs. Liz Cheney has been proactively campaigning with Kamala Harris and has obviously denounced, or forgotten, every derogatory statement she ever made about the most progressive Democrat of the 21st century. Let’s look at some of Liz Cheney’s tweets about Kamala Harris: 12 Aug 2020 @KamalaHarris has a more liberal voting record than Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Her radical leftist views-raising taxes, banning gun sales, taxpayer $ for abortion & illegal immigrant health care, eliminating private health insurance-would be devastating for America 11 Aug 2020 Kamala Harris is a radical liberal who would raise taxes, take away guns & health insurance, and explode the size and power of the federal gov’t. She wants to recreate America in the image of what’s happening on the streets of Portland and Seattle. We won’t give her a chance. 13 Aug 2019 Amazing to watch how casually @KamalaHarris lies to this Iowa Senior about health care. So, how does anyone with such disdain for Kamala Harris become one of her more ardent supporters? It is TDS, and apparently, the disease is terminal. Liz Cheney lost her reelection bid for Representative in Wyoming, is unemployed, and needs a purpose. So, she will disavow her beliefs and feelings toward Harris and become a campaign surrogate. How does one do that? How do you set aside all of your core values to endorse your anti-person simply because you hate her opponent so profoundly? Liz Cheney sealed her fate when she participated in the January 6 hearings in the House. This witch hunt was one of many during Trump’s presidency and beyond that were designed to beat the former President down so he would never threaten the establishment again. So far, they have all failed, which infuriates someone like Cheney. Even though her actions cost her a seat in Congress, she could not sit on the sideline and watch his return to the White House. There are people like RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard who have left the Democrats and now support the former President. They saw the light in how far left the Democrats had drifted and how sincere Trump is in returning America and Americans to greatness. Their decisions were not based on hatred or vindictiveness but on love for their country. As Liz Cheney sits on stage with Kamala Harris, she looks like she is waiting for a root canal. You might be pressed to find two more bitter women filled with anger and rage. As Kamala Harris trades her Joy Campaign for the new Rage version, her presentations make one thing perfectly clear, if all you can do is trash your opponent, then you have nothing to say about yourself. The final two weeks of the campaign should be the candidate’s effort to close the deal. What we see is that Kamala Harris has nothing to offer. The American people do not want and cannot survive four more years of the Biden agenda. Since there is no Harris agenda, she will give us an extension of the Biden legacy. To that we say, No Thanks.

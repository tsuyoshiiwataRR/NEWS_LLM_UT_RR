    "text": "The North Carolina State Board of Elections has ordered some Spanish-language signs warning noncitizens not to vote to be removed from around polling places. But others will stay up. Multiple advocacy groups including El Pueblo, Forward Justice, ACLU of North Carolina and the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP sent a letter this week to the state board calling for signs warning noncitizens not to vote to be removed. Translated to English, the sign referenced in the letter says, WARNING: if you are not a citizen of the United States of America, you cannot vote in elections. It is illegal! It is a crime. 18 U.S. Code ยง611. You could be deported. Dont do it! Paid for by North Carolina Election Integrity Team. The sign has popped up at early voting locations in Charlotte, WFAE first reported. Its also been reported in Durham, Orange, Granville and Pitt counties, according to the letter sent to the state board. https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article294432584.html#storylink=cpy",

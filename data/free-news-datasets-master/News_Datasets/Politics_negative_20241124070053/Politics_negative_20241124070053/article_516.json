    "text": "Gov. Ron DeSantis continued his blitz against Amendment 3 on Thursday as he and First Lady Casey DeSantis held events decrying the ballot measure that would legalize marijuana for recreational use in Florida. “It wasn’t immaculately conceived. It was put on the ballot because one big weed company has now spent $100 million trying to pass it,” DeSantis said during an event in Cape Coral. “This amendment is written to benefit this one big weed company. It’s not meant to benefit you.” DeSantis was referring to Trulieve, which bankrolled the effort to gather petitions to place Amendment 3 on the ballot and also has donated heavily to promote the measure. As of Oct. 11, campaign finance records show Trulieve has spent nearly $92.5 million trying to get Amendment 3 passed. To pass, the measure needs at least 60% support from voters. If approved, it would take effect May 5, 2025. Florida law already allows for the use of medical marijuana for adults for medical purposes. Amendment 3 would legalize it for recreational use for those 21 and older. A person could possess up to three ounces under the amendment. DeSantis and other opponents of the measure have repeatedly slammed Trulieve – though DeSantis never mentions the company by name – for attempting to “corner the market” with the amendment because it doesn’t allow individuals to grow marijuana themselves. DeSantis also contends the Legislature wouldn’t be able to set guidelines for Amendment 3 after it passes, since it would be ensconced in the state constitution. He’s raised the specter of police being unable to prevent people from smoking marijuana in parks, bars and other public places. But lawmakers have consistently passed measures to tweak amendments passed by voters, and Amendment 3 doesn’t bar the Legislature from passing rules or laws “consistent with the amendment.” “That’s misinformation. Because the governor knows that after this amendment passes it has to come to the Legislature for rulemaking,” said Sen. Shevrin Jones, D-Miami Gardens, who supports Amendment 3. “Listen, if they don’t want smoking in public, fine,” he added. “Tell the Legislature to make sure we say no smoking in public places. But don’t lie to Floridians and say this is one thing when you yourself know that that’s not the case.” Opponents have also pointed to the increased health risks to the public if marijuana were legalized for recreational use. Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, who leads the Department of Health, said the amendment would exacerbate a variety of health issues, including addiction and schizophrenia. He also claimed the media wasn’t reporting on the negative health aspects of marijuana; the better to control the populace. (The state health department also oversees the state’s medical marijuana program.) “Multiple studies show that marijuana increases the incidences of schizophrenia in young people. Multiple studies different countries they show it,” Ladapo said at the Cape Coral event. “People don’t know this but it’s true. And people don’t know it because unfortunately we have a media that wants you drugged out. And they want you drugged out because hey, guess what? You’re easier to control. You’re way more controllable when you’re drugged out.” DeSantis also received help from wife Casey, who held her own event in Jacksonville, where she was joined by several sheriffs. The rhetoric against Amendment 3 has grown sharper as Election Day nears, with less than two weeks left. “Why do they package it like Gummy Bears and lollipops and Rice Krispie Treats and brownies?” Casey DeSantis said. “It will happen where this gets to our kids, they can consume it and it can be potentially life ending.” Gray Rohrer is a reporter with the USA TODAY Network-Florida Capital Bureau.

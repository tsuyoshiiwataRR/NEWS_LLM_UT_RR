A government decree has been issued to begin construction of 110 housing units on this island and the executive processes.” “It will start soon.”\nAccording to Mehr News Agency, Maleki confirmed, “The entire area of ​​Abu Musa Island is registered in the name of the Iranian government, and the entire area of ​​this island is considered national land that has been registered with the National Land and Housing Corporation as well.”\nHe pointed out, “The priority now is to build housing for the people living on this island, and in the next stage, every Iranian citizen who wants to live on this island will be able to own a house there.”\nThe Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ismail Baghaei, commented on the recent statement of the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries regarding the three islands, saying: “Our friends in the region are raising the issues that were the subject of discussion between us and one of the countries in the public arena, and they are raising them to countries that have nothing to do with this issue.” “Issues.”\nBaghaei added: “We are in contact with friends and countries that deal with this issue before and after every meeting throughout the year,” noting: “You have heard Iran’s position a lot, and it has repeated its position repeatedly. Iran will not hesitate to protect its territory and preserve its sovereignty over the three islands. It ignores its sovereignty.”\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council previously rejected “Iran’s continued occupation of the three islands,” stressing “support for the UAE’s sovereignty over its islands and territorial waters .”\nRevolutionary Guard: The three islands belong to Iran\nIn this context, the Commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Navy, Brigadier General Ali Reza Tangsiri, reiterated his statement that “the three islands in the Gulf have long been the property of Iran.”\nIRNA reported, “Brigadier Tangsiri’s statements came on the sidelines of his participation in the memorial ceremony for Major General Nilforshan in the capital, Tehran,” adding that “the Emiratis should not allow foreigners to raise this matter and drag the region to the brink of abyss.”\nBrigadier General Tangsiri said: “Naturally, the Westerners want to project the three islands, in order to cover up the massacres that affect innocent people in Gaza and Lebanon,” noting that “the Westerners seek to justify their presence in the region, and therefore they raise the issue of the islands.”\nIranian Army: Saudi Arabia requests a joint naval exercise in the Red Sea\nSeparately, the Iranian Navy Commander, Admiral Shahram Irani, announced that “the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has requested a joint naval exercise with Iran.”\nISNA news agency quoted Admiral Shahram Irani as saying, “The Iranian naval forces are present in the Red Sea, and that Saudi Arabia has expressed its desire to organize joint maneuvers in that region,” adding, “Both countries have invited the other to visit each other’s ports.”\nHe explained that “the proposal includes conducting bilateral exercises in addition to maneuvers with the participation of other countries, noting that coordination between the relevant authorities in the two countries is underway,” stressing that “the delegations of the two countries will conduct the necessary consultations on how to organize the maneuver.”\nLast updated: October 23, 2024 – 09:26\nSuggest a correction",

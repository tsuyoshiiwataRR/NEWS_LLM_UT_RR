    "text": "By Our Reporter\nSHILLONG, Oct 24: The Voice of the People Party (VPP) has taken a strong note of the alleged Rs 2,300-crore scam in the execution of the Shillong-Nongstoin-Tura road project and demanded action against the guilty.\n“It is a serious matter. I hope that those involved are taken to task,” VPP leader and Shillong MP, Ricky Andrew J Syngkon said.\nHe also said that a World Bank-funded project – road from Lad Umsaw to Mawmaram – is yet to be completed but repair work has already started in patches.\n“What is this? It is a matter of serious concern. The public should come out and speak against such illegality as it concerns us and our future,” Syngkon said.\nHe added, “If activities are carried out in such an illegal manner, then it is serious as it is public money and each and every penny is accountable. We expect the contractors to do a good job.”\nNine people, including senior engineers of the state government and officials of two private companies based in Telangana and Haryana, have been named in an FIR lodged in this connection.\nThe road project, connecting Shillong with Tura via Nongstoin and Rongjeng, was approved in 2010 as part of Centre’s Special Road Development Programme-North East.\nAfter multiple revisions, the cost of the Rs 1,303.83 crore project was enhanced to Rs 2,366.77 crore. The original project deadline was 2014.\nMeanwhile, alleging that illegal mining of coal and its illegal transportation have continued in the state, the VPP said it will take up the matter with the central government.\n“Illegal coal mining and transportation are affecting our state and the environment. It is unfortunate that there is still rampant illegal mining and transportation of coal,” Syngkon said.\n“I will take it up with the central minister concerned. Meghalaya is losing out on revenue and environment. These are pertinent issues. I have taken them up and I will continue to do so,” he added.\nAsked if he has taken up the issue of the implementation of Inner Line Permit with the Centre, the MP said, “I haven’t spoken about it in the right forum but we will take it up soon.”",

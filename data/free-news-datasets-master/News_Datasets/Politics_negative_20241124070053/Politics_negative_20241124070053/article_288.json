    "text": "Every couple of years and every major election cycle, voters are inundated with political ads, the usual talking points, and ballot measures. While some ballot measures are necessary, the default position we as voters should take is ‘Why am I being asked to vote on this now?' We should always assume that ballot measures are a last resort to circumvent the normal political processes we have in place and rely on, to serve our community day in and day out. In the case of a vacancy tax, our very own city council, the one we elected, decided to not move forward and voted it down earlier this year. Now, with Measure N on the ballot, a select group in our community is telling us that everyone must be wrong, including our own elected city council, everyone except them. I vote for my elected officials to do the job they campaign for - create and pass legislature as a group. They rightfully voted down a vacancy tax earlier this year, and I trust that they will continue to do the work we elect them to do, so we don’t have to waste our time legislating for them. Vote no on Measure N. - Brett Richardson A politically exhausted full time resident of South Lake Tahoe",

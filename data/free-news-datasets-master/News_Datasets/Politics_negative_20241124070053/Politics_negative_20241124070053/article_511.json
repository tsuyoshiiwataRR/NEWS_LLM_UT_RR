    "text": "A scathing new report has put the Biden-Harris administration on blast for allegedly advancing its open-borders agenda through the immigration courts. The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee’s [report](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-10-24%20Quiet%20Amnesty%20-%20How%20the%20Biden-Harris%20Administration%20Uses%20the%20Nation's%20Immigration%20Courts%20to%20Advance%20an%20Open-Borders%20Agenda.pdf) states that the federal government has used the backlog of court cases as an excuse to allow increasing numbers of illegal aliens to remain inside the country indefinitely. Rather than determining whether foreign nationals’ claims for asylum are valid or not, in accordance with the appropriate judicial proceedings, the Biden-Harris administration forced immigration judges to simply dismiss, close, and terminate cases. The process has been dubbed by the committee as “quiet amnesty.” Consequently, hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens are allowed to run rampant inside the country. The report also clarifies that these illegal aliens—numbering close to one million—can now remain in the country with no possibility of deportation. Further, the trend only seems to be getting worse as the number of cases filed continues to surpass the number of case closures. Simultaneously, the federal government meticulously worked to silence dissenters in the courts. The report recalls that in February, Executive Office for Immigration Review Chief Immigration Judge Sheila McNulty mandated that specific immigration judges “get supervisor approval to speak publicly to anyone outside the Justice Department,” in an attempt to silence anyone critical of the “heavily backlogged immigration courts.” The Biden-Harris administration has utilized the worsening border crisis as a “pretext” to remove a plethora of cases from judges’ dockets—rather than having cases properly adjudicated and concluded with foreign nationals being expelled back to their countries of origin. Yet, Texas is continuing to repel illegal border crossings as the federal government puts citizens in the crosshairs of its open-borders agenda. Gov. Greg Abbott shared Thursday on [X](https://x.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1849521047516663999) that construction of the border wall perseveres. “Illegal crossings are DOWN by 88% in Texas, while they increased in other border states like California and Arizona,” he said. “It’s because of Texas’ stiff resistance.” No ads. No paywalls. No government grants. No corporate masters. Just real news for real Texans.

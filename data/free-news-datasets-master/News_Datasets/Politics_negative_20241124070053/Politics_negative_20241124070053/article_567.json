    "text": "The Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Khamenei, issued a statement addressing the dear youth of the Resistance Front, praising the personality of His Eminence, the Head of the Executive Council of Hezbollah in Lebanon, Sayyed Hashem Safieddine (May Allah’s blessings be upon him).\nHis Eminence emphasized, “Hezbollah today remains the strongest defender of Lebanon and the firmest shield against the ambitions of the Zionist entity, which has long sought to dismantle Lebanon.”\n“The brave and sacrificing fighter, His Eminence Sayyed Hashem Safieddine (May Allah’s blessings be upon him), has joined the ranks of the martyrs of the Resistance. The sky of fight in the path of Sacred Al-Quds is now adorned with a new shining star. His Eminence was one of the most prominent figures in Hezbollah, a steadfast supporter and constant companion of His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. Thanks to the wisdom and courage of leaders like him, Hezbollah was able to protect Lebanon from the danger of division and collapse once again and thwart the threat posed by the usurping entity, whose cruel and unjust army sometimes trampled the ground all the way to Beirut. His Eminence’s chivalry and sacrifice, alongside the other leaders and fighters in the Axis of Nasrallah, eliminated the danger of the occupation of southern Litani, Tyre, and other cities in that region, and their annexation to the usurped and occupied Palestine. They made the souls, properties, and valuable reputation of Hezbollah enter the battlefield to preserve the sovereignty of Lebanon’s territories, foiling the plans of the aggressive and criminal Zionist entity.”\nWhile it may appear today that leaders like Nasrallah and Safieddine are absent in this life, their souls and leadership remain present in the field, defending Lebanon and its defenseless people, Imam Khamenei underlined.\n“Hezbollah today remains the strongest defender of Lebanon and the firmest shield against the ambitions of the Zionist entity, which has long sought to divide Lebanon. The enemy tries to deny Hezbollah’s sacrificial role for Lebanon, but those who care must not allow these false claims shouted by their voices to reach people’s ears.”\n“Hezbollah is alive and growing stronger, fulfilling its historic role. The Islamic Republic, as always, will continue to support the fighters for Al-Quds and the resistors against the occupation by the criminal and usurping gang of Palestine, by Allah’s permission.”\nI offer my congratulations and condolences on the martyrdom of our dear Sayyed Safieddine to his honorable family, his relatives, and his fellow fighters across all Resistance fronts, Imam Khamenei concluded.\nSource: Al-Manar English Website",

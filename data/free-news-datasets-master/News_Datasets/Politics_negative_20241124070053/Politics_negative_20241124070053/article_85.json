I am shocked that Miller is in charge of a legal PAC that is being funded by TFG donors. [Link to tweet] https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jake-tapper-cnn-donald-trump-advisor-stephen-miller-escorted-out-by-security/ President Donald Trump's senior policy adviser Stephen Miller was \"escorted\" off a CNN TV set in Washington on Sunday by the network's security officers following a contentious interview with Jake Tapper, CNN has said. A CNN source told CBS News that Miller was escorted out \"after refusing to leave voluntarily.\" Miller appeared on Tapper's \"State of the Union\" program Sunday morning to defend the president from charges leveled in the new book by journalist Michael Wolff, \"Fire and Fury,\" about the purported dysfunction in the White House. The interview became so contentious that Tapper cut the interview short and said Miller was wasting his viewers' time. \"The segment was over and Mr. Miller was politely asked to leave the set multiple times. After refusing to leave, he was escorted out by security,\" the CNN source told CBS News President Trump praised Miller, tweeting shortly after the appearance which at times devolved into an on-air shouting match, that his aide had \"destroyed\" Tapper. He urged his followers to \"watch the hatred and unfairness of this CNN flunky!\" Miller appeared on Tapper's \"State of the Union\" program Sunday morning to defend the president from charges leveled in the new book by journalist Michael Wolff, \"Fire and Fury,\" about the purported dysfunction in the White House.

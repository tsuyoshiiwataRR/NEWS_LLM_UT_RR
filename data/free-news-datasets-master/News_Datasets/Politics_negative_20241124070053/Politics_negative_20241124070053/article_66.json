    "text": "President William Ruto has been actively pursuing political leaders and allies of impeached Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, a move designed to diminish Gachagua’s political influence and clip his wings. Dr Ruto has won several Members of Parliament from Mt Kenya region previously considered to be Gachagua allies but have since shifted their loyalty. In the latest move, Gachagua’s former Personal Assistant Francis Maina has been appointed as the Deputy Director of Communication in the Executive Office of the President. Maina was recently sacked shortly before Gachagua was impeached. In the build-up to the impeachment, Gachagua had last month hosted 11 Senators from the Mount Kenya region at his official residence in Karen Estate in Nairobi where the Senators committed to supporting whatever political direction he deems fit as they seek reelection in the 2027 general elections. Senators Karungo Thangwa (Kiambu), Kamau Murango (Kirinyaga) John Methu (Nyandarua), John Kinyua (Laikipia) Joseph Githuku (Lamu), Joe Nyutu (Muranga), Tabitha Karanja (Nakuru) were present during the meeting in which Gachagua appeared to have consolidated his support in the region. At the same time, Senators Kathuri Murungi (Meru), Wahome Wamatinga (Nyeri) Mwenda Gataya (Tharaka-Nithi), Alexander Mundigi (Embu) and Veronica Maina (Nominated) were also present in the meeting that pledged to support Gachagua going forward only for them to make an about turn one month later by supporting his impeachment. Mathira MP Eric Wamumbi and Muranga County MP Betty Maina are some of the harshest critics of Gachagua at the moment although he was the Chief dowry negotiator during their wedding.. Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei who was considered a Gachagua ally and went ahead to cast aspersion on the 11 impeachment grounds that he faced surprised many after about one hour later he went ahead to vote in support of most charges signaling his change of tact bearing in mind he comes from the President’s backyard. Nominated Senator Karen Nyamu is one of those considered close to Gachagua, yet she surprised many when she decided to vote in support of the charges that Gachagua faced before the Senate signaling that she preferred being in Ruto’s camp stating it is a tough decision she was making. Three weeks ago, Senator Gataya hosted his colleagues Murungi, Wamatinga and Mundigi in Tharaka Nithi where they pledged support for Prof Kithure Kindiki as the Mt Kenya region Spokesman. Later Kindiki was nominated by President Ruto as the Deputy President and approved by Parliament. “The person given the position of Deputy President has transformed into a leader of a particular tribe, yet we want a leader who represents the face of the country, one who is acceptable in the entire country, we have resolved to have Prof Kindiki as our link to the National Government,” said Gataya. Wamatinga said Senators from Mt Kenya region will rally behind President Ruto’s development agenda so that the broad-based government he has formed achieves the vision that they had for Kenyans and that as leaders they had agreed not to engage in tribal politics. Murungi said that the region’s elected leaders had decided to rally behind Kindiki since he has distinguished himself as a national leader and that he was the best person to represent the region’s interest at the national table.

Subscribe to our newsletter During the impeachment motion against Gachagua, Senators Karanja, Wamatinga, Murungi, Mundigi, Gataya and Maina were among those who voted in support of most of the charges that he faced before the Senate leading to the senate Speaker Amason Kingi declaring that Gachagus had ceased holding office. Karanja said that she represents a county that is home to 42 tribes noting she had to make the right decision to ensure that there is peace in her county.",

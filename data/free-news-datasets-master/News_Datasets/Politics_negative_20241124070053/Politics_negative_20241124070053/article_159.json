    "text": "Andalusia, Aragon and Castilla y León, three of the autonomous communities that expect to receive a greater amount of investment in the coming years due to the energy transition process, have shown their willingness to appeal the tax that the Government is proposing for energy companies.\nThe Andalusian president, Juan Manuel Moreno, has expressed his “clear and forceful” opposition to the tax, which he considers a “strategic error”, and assures that he will use “legal and institutional” instruments to prevent the tax relief being allowed to some communities. and not to others, in relation to the request of the Basque Nationalist Party to be able to arbitrate this new tax.\nMoreno has been “very concerned” about the Government’s negotiations on the conversion of an exceptional measure such as the tax for the energy crisis into a new tax on electricity companies, and has shown his opposition to it because it has no greater justification than the The collection “voracity” of Pedro Sánchez’s Government.\n“Be careful with this,” warned Moreno, who recalled that Spain and Andalusia have a great opportunity to re-industrialize and produce their own energy with renewables, with photovoltaics, in a way that “puts Spain below competitors like Portugal.” represents a “very serious strategic error for the present and the future.”\nFor the Andalusian president, Spain and Andalusia have a great opportunity for reindustrialization thanks to renewable energies, and anything that involves “limiting” this type of energy through taxation will only cause the present and the future to be “mortgaged” , something that will be “difficult to overcome”, as he indicated in a conference organized by La Vanguardia.\nMoreno has warned the central government that “any action” taken along these lines will encourage Andalusia to act “with the legal instruments and institutional capacity” that the autonomous community has.\nThe Andalusian president recalled that Andalusia has very important projects linked to green hydrogen, so modifying the fiscal framework could put “million-dollar investments” at risk not only in Andalusia but in the rest of Spain, among other communities, the Catalan one.\nThe President of the Government of Aragon, Jorge Azcón, has also spoken along the same lines, stating that he will appeal in court and before the Competition authorities against the special tax on energy companies if the Government consolidates it and becomes a permanent lien.\nAragón is in the crosshairs of large data center operators such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and BlackStone with investments worth 33 billion over the next 10 years.\nThe Minister of Economy and Finance and spokesperson for the Government of Castilla y León, Carlos Fernández Carriedo, also announced that the Executive will appeal the tax on energy companies, since it “harms” and promotes “inequality” between autonomous communities.\nCarriedo advanced that the Board has analyzed the possible impact that this tax would have on the Community and rejected the possibility of the tax having a specific collection for the autonomous regions of the regional regime.\nWhatsApp Twitter Linkedin Beloud\n#Andalusia #Aragon #Castilla #León #stand #hacha #blow #electricity #companies",

    "text": "WALKER COUNTY, Ga. — Plans to build a shooting range in Walker County just across the street from a Girl Scout camp are raising concerns for community members. But as of Thursday, those plans have been withdrawn, after developers pushing the plan noticed a map error. The proposal, put forth by McLemore Club LLC, was initially set to be discussed at a commission meeting Thursday night, but was pulled back prior to the meeting. The proposed site is located in the city of Menlo, right off Highway 157, directly across from Girl Scouts Camp Adahi. We have heard from several viewers who oppose the firing range. “I'm worried about our property values. I'm worried about my children.” JL Compton and his family live just 2,000 feet from the proposed shooting range site. “If you're walking a dog, if we have birthday parties, get togethers, how is all that noise gonna impact our home?\" Compton says. At the planning commission meeting last week, JL says at least 30 residents showed up to voice their concerns. \"It was unanimously shut down and denied through the board of planning and zoning.” According to a Walker County spokesperson, Macklemore withdrew the proposed plan from the agenda for Thursday. But a spokesperson for Scenic Land Company told us they pulled the plan because of an error in this map: Steve Bridges also lives close to the proposed site, and he says he doesn't want the sound of gunshots ringing through the valley his property overlooks. \"I'm not a opposed to guns. That's not the issue at all. We hear gunshots periodically with hunters, but it's not six days a week.\" Scenic Land Company tells usthey are \"taking into account the community's comments\" and they \"anticipate the opportunity for further discussion and consideration of the sporting club will come at a later date.\"",

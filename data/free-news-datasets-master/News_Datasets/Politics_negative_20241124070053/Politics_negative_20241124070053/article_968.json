The Wades also applied for and received forgiveness of their fraudulently obtained PPP loans based upon additional falsehoods, which included falsely representing to the SBA that they had spent their loan proceeds on payroll. During the commission of the offenses, Tracy and Carolyn Wade were employed as deputy sheriffs in BSO’s Department of Detention.\nA sentencing date has not yet been set by the court. The maximum sentence for conspiracy to commit wire fraud is 20 years in prison; the maximum sentence for each wire fraud conviction is 20 years in prison; the maximum sentence for conspiracy to make false statements to the SBA is 5 years in prison; the maximum sentence for each conviction of making false statements to the SBA is 2 years in prison.

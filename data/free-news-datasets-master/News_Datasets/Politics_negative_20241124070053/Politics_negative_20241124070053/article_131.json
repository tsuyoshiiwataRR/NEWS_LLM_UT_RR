    "text": "When it is said that women “talk to each other” We mean not only that we are a safe place for everyone, but that in those conversations you end up finding the courage and fortitude to say “it’s over” , “I do believe you.” To express with complicity that “If it happens to someone, they are not crazy” as one of the women victims of abuse by Íñigo Errejón wrote in an Instagram message – addressed to journalist Cristina Fallarás – whose complaints that are now impossible to contain have caused the resignation of the former spokesperson for the Sumar parliamentary group .\nAs has happened so many other times in cases of this type, at first it seemed to be an isolated testimony, but the others soon arrived. “It’s being tremendous, there are many, many,” explains to the phone Fallarás, who since he dynamited the #tellit dedicates her Instagram profile to giving visibility to hundreds of stories of women who They relate from their own flesh different episodes of sexual violence, machismo and misogyny. . But the conversation with Fallarás continues with a key statement: “They are terrified.” They are afraid because they know the stigma and the fear of re-victimization, the fear of being singled out, judged by a society that, on too many occasions, remains lenient towards aggressors and hostile to them, the victims.\nIt could be paradoxical that dozens of users echoed the case on social networks and pointed directly to Errejón – despite the fact that the victim only referred to “a politician who lives in Madrid”, a socially outraged” who “never takes his name”. head on the days of 8M” – but then the vast majority of them have not wanted to speak, at least not yet.\nFor now, we only have the name of the actress and presenter Elisa Mouliaá who contacted Public this Thursday afternoon via direct message, explaining that she was another of the victims of sexual harassment by Íñigo Errejón and that she wanted to report it. Although we know that there are more than a dozen who could relate similar episodes with the former deputy. It is worth remembering that a little over a year ago a thread in X from an anonymous profile already set off alarm bells with another harassment situation that directly mentioned Errejón. The woman even said that a member of the politician’s cabinet had tried to dissuade her from reporting what happened to court.\nNevertheless, general fear is not unfounded . Telling it continues to be read, above all, as a disruptive and even dangerous act, especially if instead of assuming responsibility or, at least, opening a space for self-criticism, Errejón presents his resignation, avoiding any direct allusion to the victims or the abuse. reported. Or when you see how the environment becomes silent, looks away and acts as an invisible barrier rather than questioning his own.\n“Eloquent silences from those who do not usually remain silent even under water”, as he has criticized from his X account Lorena Ruiz-Huerta former deputy of the 10th legislature of the Madrid Assembly for Podemos, who knows and has worked very closely with Errejón. The lawyer, who He has referred to Errejón’s resignation as an “episode of justice” has been very harsh with “those who already silenced, in a complicit manner, in the party and even encouraged more and more” the former spokesperson. And she wanted to insist that “it doesn’t happen to us, pressure and responsibility don’t make us bad.”\nIn his statement, Errejón alluded to neoliberal inertia something like the speed of institutional politics to justify what happened, but figures like Guillermo Zapata have shown that It’s something that comes from afar and, above all, what no one close to us has taken care of until everything has blown up. “I have shared political spaces with Íñigo Errejón at various times in my life. I didn’t realize this until very recently. There is a part of what happened that also falls on my side. Saying it now changes little, but keeping quiet is worse,” he wrote in X.\nZapata’s tweet responds to a publication of the journalist and writer Marta G. Franco where she expresses what many have been thinking and sharing all day: fed up and tired of the fact that “we feminists have to be the ones who always have to report on this shit.” Again, as experts have warned so many times, without the environment of impunity that breathe crimes against women, nothing would be possible. EITHER, in the words –again– of Fallarás: a society has the violence that it tolerates .\nHowever, the sisterhood, the efforts of the feminist movement – ​​which since 2017 has regained great momentum – and the work of initiatives such as the # tell it or the # It’s Over –which offer spaces and loudspeakers to make visible a systematic and interestingly hidden violence–, have managed to make it less and less.\n#Errejón #scandal #portrays #wall #impunity #silence #crack #sorority #among #victims",

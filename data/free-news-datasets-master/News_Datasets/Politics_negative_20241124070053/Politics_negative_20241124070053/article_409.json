It’s unconscionable.”Read Trump ally accused of being a Nazi after he changed the price of his pillowsShe added that Sinwar’s killing provided an opportunity to end the war, return the hostages and “bring relief to the Palestinian people, and work toward a two-state solution where Israel and the Palestinians in equal measure have security, where the Palestinian people have dignity, self-determination, and the safety they so rightly deserve.”When CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked about citizens who may refuse to vote for her because of the Biden Administration’s support for Israel, Harris responded by expressing sympathy for anti-Israel sentiments.“Listen, I am not going to deny the strong feelings that people have. I don’t know anyone who has seen the images who would not have strong feelings about what has happened, much less those who have relatives who have died and been killed,” she said.Read Kamala loses the JewsWhen Cooper asked Harris if she would be more pro-Israel than Donald Trump and she dodged the question and instead focused on her opponent’s alleged affinity for authoritarian leaders such as Vladimir Putin and compared him to Adolf Hitler.“I believe that Donald Trump is dangerous,” Harris said. “And if the president of the United States, the commander in chief, is saying to his generals, in essence, why can’t you be more like Hitler’s generals? This is a serious, serious issue, and we know who he is.” 2024 electionDonald TrumpIsrael supportKamala Harris",

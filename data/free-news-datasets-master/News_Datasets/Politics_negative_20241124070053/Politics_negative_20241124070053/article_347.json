    "text": "Journalists across the political spectrum regret that interviews with Kamala Harris shed precious little light on her views or the policies she intends to implement if elected president. However, some of society’s most noxious forces — including abortionists, those who support transgender surgeries for minors, and pornographers — plan to shape the direction of a Harris-Walz administration and have donated more than $100 million dollars to ensure the pair take power next January.\nAbortionists The abortion industry alone has dedicated tens of millions of dollars to its business interests, and candidates who support them, in the 2024 election. The nation’s largest abortion business, Planned Parenthood, dedicated $40 million to promoting pro-abortion candidates in eight swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n“Abortion will be the message of this election, and it will be how we energize voters,” enthused Jenny Lawson, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes. Lawson said her message would highlight the alleged “devastation that comes when anti-abortion politicians have power” — a theme the Democratic ticket has adopted with relish. Kamala Harris has falsely accused “Trump abortion bans” of claiming the lives of women who died as a result of complications from the abortion pill, mifepristone.\nREACH PRO-LIFE PEOPLE WORLDWIDE! Advertise with LifeNews to reach hundreds of thousands of pro-life readers every week. Contact us today .\nOne of the nation’s most influential pro-abortion PACs, EMILY’s List, amplified this message with a fearmongering $6 million ad buy telling female voters in swing states that lifesaving laws will kill them. The group’s first ad features someone dressed as an emergency room doctor claiming “a pregnant patient” comes in “every shift” bleeding. But “it’s against state law for me to provide life-saving care, because Donald Trump took away a woman’s right to make her own medical decisions,” she lies. No pro-life law at any level makes it illegal to care for miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies, nor forces women to wait until they are at the point of death to receive medical treatment.\nThe abortion industry has banded together with the legal Left to launch an enduring, $100 million campaign under the new name Abortion Access Now (AAN). AAN describes itself as “a long-term federal strategy to codify the right to abortion, including lobbying efforts, grassroots organizing, public education, and comprehensive communication strategies to mobilize support and enact change.” Its leadership includes:\nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) and Planned Parenthood Action Fund (PPAF) Reproductive Freedom for All American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR) National Women’s Law Center (NWLC) In Our Own Voice: National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice (Latina Institute) National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum (NAPAWF) Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity (URGE) Its steering committee also includes the oxymoronic, dissenting group Catholics for Choice, as well as EMILY’s List, the National Abortion Federation, MoveOn.org, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the National Council of Jewish Women, and the National Abortion Hotline.\nMany of these groups worked in concert to support Ohio’s Issue 1 , which wrote the “right” of minors to obtain abortion and other “reproductive” services into the state constitution last November. The groups support abortion for minors without parental consent or notification, transgender surgeries for minors, legalizing prostitution, hampering law enforcement, and forcing taxpayers to fund abortion-on-demand throughout all nine months of pregnancy.\nAbortion Access Now’s opening statement signals that it, too, aims at far more than simply abortion. “We envision a future where abortion, and all sexual and reproductive health care, is not only legal but also accessible, affordable, and free from stigma or fear,” the group said in a press release announcing its formation in June. “We are operating with a really big vision, but we’re also living in the world of the possible,” Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity, told Politico.\nFor the short term, the group intends to fund abortion through Medicaid and other federal programs, expand the “right” of taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand to illegal immigrants and other pregnant “people in federal custody facilities,” and corporate welfare for abortionists to rebuild “ the abortion care ecosystem .” Its statement also hinted at the abortion industry’s fear-based misinformation strategy, alleging, “People are struggling to get lifesaving medical care for miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, and other pregnancy complications.”\nPlanned Parenthood state affiliates in California, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, and Ohio will also launch localized campaigns on the issue, many focused at the state level. A total of 10 states will host ballot initiatives on abortion this November. But ultimately, Planned Parenthood CEO Alexis McGill Johnson vowed that her industry will use all the resources at its disposal to “fight for federal” pro-abortion legislation.\nSBA Pro-Life America has announced it will spend $92 million in eight swing states, including Michigan, this election cycle aiding those who respect the unalienable right to life.\nPornographers The New York Times reported that the “ porn industry ” — whose products often feature incest, rape, violence, and themes of pedophilia — has thrown its support behind Kamala Harris in 2024. The industry launched a $100,000 “Hands Off My Porn” campaign , running anti-Trump ads in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada. The advertisements accuse the former president of secretly seeking to implement provisions of Project 2025, a conservative policy document he has repeatedly disowned, which would harm the smut industry’s bottom line.\nThe porn industry has a long history of endorsing Democratic candidates, and the party seemingly looks out for its interests, as well. The 2024 Democratic Party platform promises to keep “fighting” parents who want to place sexually graphic books in age-restricted parts of the library and ensure schools are not promoting such content to their children. The Democratic platform refers to these parental modesty initiatives as “book bans that censor LGBTQI+ content.” Both Kamala Harris and vice presidential candidate Tim Walz (D), who has a long history with the LGBTQ movement, have said they oppose efforts to spare minors from exposure to porn in schools.\nGroups That Support Transgender Surgeries for Children The nation’s leading LGBTQIA+ pressure group, the controversial Human Rights Campaign (HRC), has dedicated $15 million to the 2024 presidential election. As this author has written at The Washington Stand, HRC opposes laws protecting minors from transgender procedures and surgeries, and its controversial K-12 curriculum encourages employees to teach children radical transgender ideology beginning in preschool:\n“HRC’s ‘Welcoming Schools’ program instructs teachers to read the book ‘ They, She, He, Easy as ABC ’ to children in preschool or kindergarten. Its pre-K lesson plan defines ‘gender identity’ as ‘How you feel. Girl, boy, both or neither. Everyone has a gender identity,’ conducts school trainings , and creates lesson plans for teachers beginning in ‘ pre-K .’ By third grade, it encourages students to use the ‘ Gender Snowperson ’ exercise to ‘understand the differences between gender identity, sexual orientation and sex assigned at birth.’”\n“The HRC, an LGBT activist group with a $46 million budget, opposes laws protecting minors from transgender procedures and has denounced laws ‘allowing misgendering of transgender students’ or regulating ‘drag performances.’”\nHRC is joined by the so-called Equality PAC, which is co-chaired by Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), which has raised $12 million for the 2024 election.\n“Welcome to our annual convening of the gay mafia,” Torres told the group’s star-studded fundraiser in June. “Vice President Harris, some of you from California may remember that she began marrying gay couples when she was the DA in San Francisco — before gay marriage was even legal across the country,” Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) told the crowd.\nThe group has raised so much money that it has branched out from supporting candidates who identify as LGBT to spreading LGBTQIA+ activists’ money throughout Democratic congressional campaigns broadly. “We recognize that without a pro-equality Congress, without a Speaker Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president, we will never be able to make the Equality Act the law of the land,” said Torres. Besides, Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told the group a future Democratic majority could “pull back” the Senate filibuster to pass the so-called “Equality Act” with a bare majority.\nA new Democratic Congress may have a much stronger ally in the White House next January. In all, the movement aims to “build a world where it’s no longer noteworthy when a trans candidate runs and wins,” insisted a Democratic Delaware state senator born Tim McBride , who now goes by the name Sarah.\nTorres linked the LGBTQIA+ cause with abortion-on-demand, telling NPR, “A woman born in 2024 has fewer rights than she did in 1973, which is a tragic reminder that progress cannot be taken for granted, that LGBTQ rights can be every bit as fragile as reproductive rights.”\nA poll from the LGBTQ pressure group GLAAD found that those who identify with the movement favor any generic Democrat over any generic Republican by 63 points (77% vs. 14%).\nDr. Jennifer Bauwens has also pointed out at the 2024 Pray Vote Stand Summit that, according to federal election data, “92% to 96% of research psychologists and social workers” have “given to a liberal Democrat candidate” for office.\nResearchers have found politicians prove remarkably responsive to people or organizations who donate to their campaign. Rest assured that if Kamala Harris is elected, pornographers, abortionists, and the transgender industry will have her ear.\nLifeNews Note: Ben Johnson is senior reporter and editor at The Washington Stand.",

    "text": "[We're not sure why CNN re-hired Brian Stelter](https://twitchy.com/justmindy/2024/09/03/brian-stelter-new-role-and-dossier-reminder-n2400497), because he seems to not watch much of programming his network puts forth. Because, if he did, he'd know that everything Fox News said about the Harris town hall with Anderson Cooper is true. But Stelter clearly hate-watches Fox News so he can dunk on them on X (and fail). Which is fine by us, because it makes for great content. Kamala's town hall yesterday was, in a word, terrible. [Even CNN fact checked it,](https://twitchy.com/samj/2024/10/24/cnn-fact-checks-tf-out-of-kamala-n2402680) and Cooper's questioning made Kamala look like a fool (again). Here's what Fox & Friends viewers are reading/hearing about the Harris town hall: ‚Äî Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) \"HARRIS DODGES QUESTIONS, SLAMS TRUMP AT TOWN HALL\" \"HARRIS STRUGGLES TO EXPLAIN RECORD AS VP\" \"HARRIS MAKES ANOTHER OUTRAGEOUS CLAIM ABOUT TRUMP\"[October 24, 2024] This line of attack might work if the rest of us hadn't, ya know, seen the clips of the town hall and -- with our own eyes and ears -- confirm it was just as bad as Fox News reported. Clearly you didn‚Äôt watch. Anderson actually exposed her for the fraud she is and your own CNN panel shredded herüòÇüòÇ ‚Äî Spitfire (@DogRightGirl)[October 24, 2024] He didn't watch. Which is hilarious. That means they actually watched it. Total and complete train wreck. ‚Äî Audie Morphy (@AudieMOrphy)[https://t.co/AfVCKytYcp][October 24, 2024] Like the Hindenburg and the Titanic combined. ‚ÄúTRUMP‚ÄôS AVALANCHE OF ABSURD TWITTER TYPOS‚Äù ‚Äî 100 Proof ü•É (@ChampionCapua)[pic.twitter.com/JNp80KnoJF][October 24, 2024] We'd forgotten about this. That's some hard-hitting journalism right there, Tater. Your team at CNN said the same things last night. What‚Äôs the issue? ‚Äî GayRepublicanDad (@steant_pros)[October 24, 2024] 'Argle bargle! Fox News! Bad Orange Man!' -- Trump, probably. The town hall went so bad for Kamala instead of reporting on that, you‚Äôre reporting on the reporting. ‚Äî Queen Velvet (@TMIWITW) That‚Äôs funny[October 24, 2024] Funny and completely on-brand for Stelter. Brian was cool for a couple months then he got hired back by CNN and went full shill again. ‚Äî The Jorster (@jorster)[https://t.co/zeMnc6PVeM][October 24, 2024] YUP. CNN taking you back was a huge misstep. ‚Äî Mulder‚Äôs Long Fight for Account Reinstatement (@proteinwisdom) You‚Äôre a sad bloated partisan gimp. The country will heal once people like you become irrelevant. Not until.[https://t.co/fTyyr8VN4V][October 24, 2024] No lie detected. Notice how quickly Stelter went back to basically covering only what Fox News does. ‚Äî RBe (@RBPundit)[https://t.co/L1ymbv9Wvn][October 24, 2024] That's all he's good for. And he even sucks at that. Yes. ‚Äî Chad Felix Greene üáÆüá± (@chadfelixg) All objectively true. We watched the townhall.[https://t.co/CJksHuw3Sa][October 24, 2024] Who are we supposed to believe, our own eyes and ears or Stelter? Just wait until Mr. Potato Head here finds out what his CNN colleagues said about her performance. ‚Äî Varad Mehta (@varadmehta)[https://t.co/G2DC6vsbye][October 24, 2024] He's gonna be appalled. Stelter posted this like it‚Äôs not self-evident that‚Äôs it‚Äôs exactly what happened on his network last night. ‚Äî Tim Murtaugh (@TimMurtaugh) Dude is a transparent shill for any Democrat. Any Democrat at all.[https://t.co/ctob2mcVVS][October 24, 2024] They're (D)ifferent.",

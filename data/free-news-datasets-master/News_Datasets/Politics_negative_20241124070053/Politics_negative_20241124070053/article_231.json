    "text": "It is no secret that America faces a very uncertain future heading into the November 5th elections. On one side are a desperate cadre of elites, criminals, and rabid cultists cowering at the fear of what a Trump electoral victory could mean for their exclusive clique which has run the American political system for at least the last century. On the other side are many ordinary Americans who have been driven to the edge domestically in all aspects of their lives by failed elitist policies and criminal enterprises sanctioned by the increasingly imperial government in Washington DC. It is a mercurial period which is bearing much resemblance to the lead-up of several flashpoints in American history, such as the conflicts in the 1770s, 1860s, and 1940s. Into the midst of this volatile mixture has been thrust the news that [state legislators in West Virginia have proposed legislation whereby the state will refuse to recognize the results of any presidential election it deems compromised](https://news.tnm.me/international/north-america/west-virginia-pushes-back-the-first-step-toward-independence/). While the full ramifications of such a proposal have yet to make waves in the American political sphere, it was a proposed act of defiance on par with [Texas defying Supreme Court orders to open the border](https://rumble.com/v4atc7f-secession-speakeasy-54-public-house-edition-texas-border-crisis-leading-to-.html) earlier in the year. It is also an act which could provide a glimpse into what is coming after November 5th if the “unstoppable force meeting an immovable object” scenario plays out into any one of several previously unthinkable outcomes. One of the Elites’ favorite mouthpieces, the New York Times, recently released [a piece](https://archive.ph/4UIBA) which was [seen by many as a warning to the American people that vote rigging, electoral fraud, and manipulation would be going on in the upcoming election](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/results-could-take-awhile-ny-times-primes-voters-election-night-malarkey), just as it had in [2018](https://apnews.com/article/3cfd93f7859149809949bd611287154e), [2020](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781510776692&submitBtn=Search&new_used=*&destination=us¤cy=USD&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr), [2022](https://keepgovlocal.com/from-steal-to-secession-am-episode-14-2022-elections-post-mortem/) and [2023](https://keepgovlocal.com/from-steal-to-secession-am-episode-22-2024-elections-already-been-stolen/). This was accompanied by a number of other items raising suspicions. Stories emerged warning of [potential mail-in balloting issues](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/election-officials-warn-problems-us-mail-could-cause-2024-voting-disruptions), and news that [the postal unions (representing those individuals collecting mail-in ballots) were throwing their support behind the Democratic ticket](https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2024/09/13/union-for-postal-workers-who-will-handle-ballots-endorses-kamala-harris/). The [return of the master election challenger in the legal realm](https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2024/10/10/trumps_toughest_foe_could_be_harris_lawyer_marc_elias_1064203.html) and [legal action taken by the DOJ against governors like Glenn Youngkin for trying to clean up their voting rolls](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/doj-sues-virginia-purging-voter-rolls-close-election) also speaks of efforts to slow or stop any efforts to secure American elections. All this would seem to imply that the Elites are ensuring that electoral fraud plays a major role in yet another election season. The general assumption among many is that the planned electoral fraud in this election cycle is meant to help ensure Donald Trump is defeated on election night, just [as the 2020 effort did](https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/). Though a closer look at certain other details shows that there may be more to it than just stopping Trump this time. [Trump’s support in the polls is far higher than it was in either 2016 or 2020](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris). This has led to speculation that the sheer volume of votes for him could be enough to overwhelm the efforts to rig the votes against him in certain states. However, the Elites may be ready for that this time with backup plans ready for implementation. Certain Democratic leaders have been [openly admitting that they will likely refuse to certify the election in Trump’s favor if he wins the election night vote](https://americanmilitarynews.com/2024/08/video-democrat-congressman-calls-for-civil-war-conditions-to-disqualify-trump-if-he-wins/). This tactic would only work, however, if those refusing to certify held a majority in the House of Representatives. This then poses the question of whether the Elites may decide to focus on stealing control of Congress instead [so as to thwart a Trump return to the White House through the certification process](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/02/democrats-congress-trump-january-6/677545/). [The polls for the House seem to point to a Democrat advantage](https://www.realclearpolling.com/latest-polls/house), and even if the Republicans do retain control, a slim enough majority would make it easy for a couple elitist Republicans to cross over and prevent a Trump return. [The Senate is a close call also](https://www.realclearpolling.com/maps/senate/2024/toss-up) with [questions as to whether Republican seats in states like Texas and Nebraska might not be ripe for an upset](https://www.newsweek.com/senate-polling-texas-montana-florida-republicans-1967015). When taken in conjunction with electoral fraud being a significant factor in this election, a strong possibility exists that the real steal on election night will focus on Congress rather than Trump. There are other signs to indicate this may indeed be the first backup plan if Trump cannot be defeated in the vote count. The first is that [Trump’s sentencing in the New York criminal case was moved to after the election on November 26th](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/judge-delays-trumps-hush-money-sentencing-until-after-election). The peculiar re-scheduling of that event would seem to suggest that the Elites might use his conviction and sentencing as justification for not certifying the election. The second is [the existence of a bulletin issued from the DC intelligence community warning of widespread “election-related grievances” turning into violence from “domestic extremists.”](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-violence-domestic-extremists-fbi-dhs-bulletin/) Logically, the only reason for publication of such a bulletin would be the expectation of a significant backlash from disgruntled Americans who see themselves as robbed of the candidate they freely chose. The third, and perhaps most telling, sign [is the security precautions being implemented for the Capitol on January 6th, 2025](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3151930/due-to-2021-capitol-riot-jan-6-2025-will-be-designated-as-special-security-event/), the day the 2024 election results will be certified. It is a preparation rooted in fear and public image, and hints that those pulling strings in DC are expecting their actions on that date to be wildly unpopular with the general public. Taken together, these facts seem to indicate the Elites’ first backup plan is disqualifying Trump through controlling Congress and refusing to certify his election. If that were to happen, the question would become: who would replace Trump? In that case, Congress could have two choices. The first choice would be to declare that the runner-up wins by default, putting Kamala Harris in power. The second choice would be to invoke the line of succession as laid out in the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. With the executive offices vacant due to the winning ticket being declared ineligible to serve, the Speaker of the House—in this case likely Hakeem Jeffries—would be promoted to the presidency. In either case, the people’s choice would be removed, and a clear indication given as to who holds the real power. Undoubtedly, the Elites believe that such a show of power would break the people’s defiance by showing them the futility of further electoral resistance. What if the Elites fail to prevent a sweep on election night and Trump not only wins, but his party manages to win control of at least one house of Congress? Here again, it appears that the Elites have put pieces in place for yet another backup plan, namely a third edition of the Russia-gate narrative. It makes sense they would go this way as DC is currently engaged in a proxy war with Russia in eastern Europe, and the first two editions of Russia-gate in 2016 and 2020 worked so well in helping the Elites derail Trump and his agenda. [Certain legal foundations for another Russia-gate investigation were laid in early 2024](https://thegaggle.locals.com/post/5296921/tg-1489-election-2024-russiagate-2-0-makes-its-inevitable-appearance), and a narrative surrounding Russian interference in American internal affairs began to accelerate in the middle of the year. First, there was the [Russians-paying-TENET-media story](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/popular-conservatives-allegedly-tricked-10m-russian-influence-campaign-doj)—which [certain observers stated had all the indications of being a psy-op of some kind](https://alt-market.us/russian-collusion-i-predicted-the-tenet-media-psy-op-way-back-in-2014/)—to broadly paint all media not defending the Elites’ narrative as being stooges for Russia, specifically the Russian news service known as RT. This was followed by [proclamations from DC of the dangers of the RT news channel and the need to wage war against it](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/biden-admin-unveils-new-global-war-russias-rt-news), despite the fact that it has already been banned in most of Europe and it’s reach into America is minimal at best. Then, in what is to date the crowning claim of all, [journalist Bob Woodward has claimed in a new book that Trump and Putin have had at least seven phone calls since Trump left office in 2021](https://thehill.com/policy/international/4921585-trump-campaign-rejects-woodward-book/). This claim has prompted [comments from Elites like Susan Rice that Trump has violated the Logan Act](https://thehill.com/policy/international/4924145-susan-rice-trump-putin-logan-act/), which could tie the whole third edition of the Russia-gate narrative together and give the Elites’ the political ammunition they need to remove Trump from office. It also could lead to widespread arrests of those in the alternative media sphere as agents of Russia and a crackdown on free speech [which so many Elites have been calling for in the last several weeks](https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/09/30/john-kerry-hillary-clinton-are-so-done-pesky-first-amendment/). The darkest backup plan the Elites seem to have in their list of options is that of resistance which could take a war-like turn. Some months ago, [Tucker Carlson discussed this prospect with a guest who revealed that the Elites were game-planning war-like scenarios in response to a Trump victory](https://www.lewrockwell.com/political-theatre/military-coup-simulation-reveals-potentially-dangerous-2024-outcome-for-donald-trump/), building off [the precedent of similar scenarios which the Elites game-planned for leading up to the 2020 elections](https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/08/02/democrats-war-game-for-election-includes-west-coast-secession-possible-civil-war-john-podesta/). An [in-depth look at one of these Elite game-planning sessions](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/03/war-game-constitution-trump-biden/677779/) revealed very disturbing thought processes on the part of those who were participating; thought processes which seem rooted in strategizing for a brutal domestic conflict. The kind of domestic conflict which the Elites have ignited in other areas of the world such as Africa, Southwest Asia, and Eastern Europe. It would appear that the Elites are resolved to destroy America’s self-governing structures through violence as a last resort, should all other efforts to maintain their grip on power fail. The Elites cannot permit the people of America to take back control of their own governance. Too many plans will be in peril, too many criminal agendas in danger of being exposed, too many schemes for wealth and power will be destroyed. While Trump himself will not accomplish any of these results, the Elites clearly fear that a successful return to the White House on his part would ignite a domino effect which would lead to the American people eventually accomplishing those ends themselves. That is why there is a real desperation on the part of the Elites to stop Trump. It is not Trump himself that they truly fear, it is what his victory might inspire others to achieve which has them in utter panic. Taken together, these details would seem to point to the truth of geopolitical analyst Martin Armstrong’s forecast that “[we should be prepared for NOBODY to accept this election REGARDLESS of who wins.](https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/international-news/britain/the-riots-in-the-uk-coming-to-the-usa-soon/)” The stakes are too high for the opposing sides to simply accept losing, especially if one’s very survival might hinge on the result. The Elites’ hold on the levers of power gives them an advantage in determining who America’s leaders will be come late January 2025, which makes it very likely that Trump will be prevented from taking office through one or more of the means just listed, even if the election results are in his favor. If this is the result, what happens next? This is where the act of the West Virginia legislators mentioned at the beginning comes into perspective. With the stakes so high, it is no longer unthinkable that certain states as well as state and local leaders would begin to take very serious steps to defy DC in the face of what would be perceived as a blatant coup d’état. A taste of this was seen in the Texas border standoff earlier in 2024 when [25 states](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/war-red-states-rally-round-texas-battle-brews-biden-over-border) (joined later by the legislatures of [Arizona](https://www.kjzz.org/2024-01-30/content-1869858-top-arizona-gop-lawmakers-sign-letter-calling-texas-migrant-arrivals-invasion), [Kansas](https://www.ksnt.com/news/house-passes-resolution-in-support-of-texas/), [Kentucky](https://kentuckylantern.com/briefs/kentucky-senate-joins-house-in-urging-beshear-to-back-texas-governor-at-the-border/), and [North Carolina](https://nsjonline.com/article/2024/01/general-assembly-republicans-stand-with-texas-on-border-crisis/)) rallied behind [Texas’ open defiance of stand down orders from not only the current administration, but the Supreme Court in regards to securing the border](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/texas-defies-lawless-biden-invokes-right-self-defense-invasion-more-razor-wire). This stark divide could re-appear very quickly post-election if the blatant power-grabbing tactics of many Elites become too much for local leaders to ignore. With the Elites unlikely to back down in the face of such defiance, it is hard not to see a “national divorce” resulting from the constitutional crisis which will unfold from any of the possible actions listed. America will begin to divide naturally, first states from the DC union, then certain states will divide as local communities seek to join with those of similar values to protect their culture and heritage. The future is impossible to foretell with specificity. However, as the novelist Charles Dickens once wrote “[Men’s courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, they must lead.](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781712674215&submitBtn=Search&new_used=*&destination=us¤cy=USD&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr)” The courses of the parties involved in the unfolding drama all point to a forthcoming political division of America and much of the world. Even if the events which lead to this end only contain elements of the plans which seem to be put in place for the near future, it does not mean that the result will be any different. The Age of Centralization is reaching it’s tragic and foreseeable end. The question that now remains for those tasked with rebuilding civilization from the shattered pieces of a failed world order is: will the correct remedies be gleaned from these lessons on the dangers of state power? For therein lies the path to truth and peace.

    "text": "Don't Miss Most Read Trending on GB News Former US First Lady [Melania Trump](https://www.gbnews.com/news/us/melania-trump/) is reportedly \"upset and worried of potential security threat\" after her late mother's visa details were released as part of a lawsuit concerning Prince Harry's immigration records. The conservative think-tank Heritage Foundation published approximately 165 pages of Amalija Knavs' immigration papers, which were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request to the Department of Homeland Security. Trump's immigration lawyer, Michael Wildes, said that the release of these documents poses a \"potential security threat\" to the former First Family. The disclosed paperwork includes photocopies of Knavs' Slovenian passport, naturalisation certificate, and permanent resident card, as well as details of holiday destinations and past addresses in both America and Slovenia. Melania Trump is said to be upset with the situation that has arisen GettyThe release of Knavs' immigration documents occurred as part of the Heritage Foundation's lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security. The conservative think-tank is seeking to force the publication of [Prince Harry's immigration records](https://www.gbnews.com/royal/prince-harry-us-visa-drugs-row-calls-to-reopen-unique-case). They argue that the Duke of Sussex should have disclosed his past drug use, as detailed in his memoir Spare, to immigration officials. The Heritage Foundation contends that if Harry revealed his drug use, he should have been refused a visa. They claim the public has a right to know whether he received preferential treatment. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: A judge ruled that Harry's visa application should remain private - despite him admitting taking drugsPAIt remains unclear why the Department of Homeland Security deemed Knavs' papers eligible for release, but not Prince Harry's. The decision may have been influenced by Knavs' passing in January. Michael Wildes, Knavs's immigration lawyer, expressed strong concerns about the release of these documents. He told Newsweek: \"Mrs Trump is exploring all options, we spoke yesterday. \"The US government has once again not paid adequate attention to the security and safety of a former First Family. \"We find it mean-spirited and insensitive to drag a totally innocent party into whatever issue they have with Prince Harry. To say nothing of the potential security threat to the former First Lady and her surviving family members. I was there when she was tested and sworn. It was a solemn and meaningful moment.\" Michael Wildes, Knavs's immigration lawyer, expressed strong concerns about the release of these documents GettyWildes further questioned the rapid release of the documents. He told The Daily Mail: \"That the DHS released Ms. Knavs's immigration file after only 11 days further screams the impropriety of this request. How could the DOJ and Secret Service allow this breach?\" Wildes added: \"Mrs Trump is rightfully upset. \"This egregious and abhorrent violation of Ms. Knavs's immigration file—including highly sensitive medical information and addresses that impact her family's security—is an outlandish affront, not just to Ms. Knavs, and her family including former First Lady Melania Trump, but also to the very notions of confidentiality and privacy.\" A letter from the DHS to the Heritage Foundation which was disclosed as part of the court filing read: \"We have considered the foreseeable harm standard when reviewing the record set and have applied the FOIA exemptions as required by the statute and the Attorney General's guidance. \"We have completed the review of all documents and have identified 165 pages that are responsive to your request. Enclosed are 100 pages released in their entirety and 37 pages released in part. We are withholding 28 pages in full. \"In our review of these pages, we have determined they contain no reasonably segregable portion(s) of nonexempt information.\"",

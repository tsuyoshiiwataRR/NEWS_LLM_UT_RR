    "text": "With the general election in process, law enforcement officials want to remind people to respect other people’s property and property rights. Although there have been only a handful of reports of individuals tampering with yard signs in Chaffee County and Salida specifically, Chaffee County Sheriff Andy Rohrich said oftentimes his department doesn’t hear about incidents involving signs until long after they’ve happened. “We hear about that stuff later, so I encourage people to call the police if that happens. The more information we get, the more of a likelihood it is that we can establish a potential suspect and follow that line, because people do talk,” Rohrich said. “We do find that we typically hear about these things a long time later; people assume we’re not going to find out who it was.” He explained the difference between potential charges that could be brought depending on the level of crime committed. For example, if a yard sign is egged and there is not a calculable monetary damage, that would classify as tampering. If someone vandalizes a sign and causes damage, that would be classified as criminal mischief. If a sign is removed from a yard, that would qualify as theft. However, it is important to note that felonious theft is only applicable to monetary amounts of $2,000 or more, so the theft charge would likely classify as a misdemeanor. Police Chief Russ Johnson said, “People are allowed to have their own political beliefs. We live in a free country. Whether you agree or disagree with someone, you should respect their rights. Do any kind of dig back at them at the polls, and not on someone’s property.” Jennifer Barker, secretary of the Chaffee County Republicans, said, “Chaffee County Republicans strongly oppose all vandalism done to political signs, property and beings of both parties. One of our own executive board members’ car was keyed in Walmart’s parking lot because she has Trump bumper stickers on her car, as an example of actual physical damage to her vehicle for no reason other than her political views.” JoAnne Allen, chair of Chaffee County Democrats, said, “Political vandalism and violence is a tool of cowards and bullies and has no place in American electoral democracy.” She noted that some Democrats who have experienced vandalism, whether it be theft or tampering with a sign, have expressed to her their fear in reporting, as they believe their “Trump neighbors are capable of violence.” “We reject all kinds of political vandalism and, as the Chaffee County Democrats, we condemn it. Two wrongs don’t make a right,” Allen said. To report theft of a political sign or tampering with a political sign, call the nonemergency dispatch number at 719-539-2596.",

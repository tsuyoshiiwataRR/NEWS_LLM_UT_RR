    "text": "A new Microsoft report shows that China is conducting election interference in the United States by targeting multiple Republican candidates. Sharing a report on Wednesday regarding foreign election interference efforts, Microsoft said, “With two weeks until Election Day 2024, the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) observes sustained influence efforts by Russia, Iran, and China aimed at undermining U.S. democratic processes.” Microsoft’s report revealed that China is trying to damage the 2024 campaigns of Rep. Barry Moore (R-Ala.), Michael McCaul (R-Texas), and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.). The report also showed that China has targeted Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is not up for reelection in November. “Chinese influence operations have focused on down-ballot Republican candidates and members of Congress that advocate for anti-Chinese policies,” Microsoft stated. “Actors have parroted antisemitic messages, amplified accusations of corruption, and promoted opposition candidates. While not always resulting in high levels of engagement, these efforts demonstrate China’s sustained attempts influence U.S. politics across the board.” According to Reuters, the Republican candidates are being targeted by Taizi Flood, which is a group that has been linked with China’s Ministry of Public Security. In response to Microsoft’s report of Chinese election interference, Reuters said a Chinese embassy spokesperson claimed China “has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election” and suggested that election interference claims were “full of malicious speculations.” McCaul told Reuters that being targeted by China was a “badge of honor” since he has made “standing up to the CCP a central part of my career.” Moore described the Chinese Communist Party as “anti-Semitic,” adding, “It isn’t surprising that they are targeting me and other politicians who support Israel to try to sow division in advance of the most important election in our lifetime.” READ MORE: Election results expected four days after Election Day, analyst warns Warning about the efforts of foreign nations to influence the 2024 election, Microsoft said, “History has shown foreign actors’ ability to rapidly distribute deceptive content can significantly impact public perception and electoral outcomes. With a particular focus on the 48 hours before and after Election Day, voters, government institutions, candidates, and parties must remain vigilant against deceptive and suspicious activity online.” In addition to China’s efforts to target Republican candidates, Microsoft’s report warned that Iran and China are using social media platforms to influence American voters ahead of the November election. “During times of heightened emotion, conflict, and competition, manipulated images, audio, and video often travel further and faster across audiences than during an average news cycle,” Microsoft said. “Foreign actors have proven nimble and capable of inserting deceptive content and distributing it rapidly during these moments.”",

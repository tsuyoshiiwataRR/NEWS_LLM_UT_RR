    "text": "Recent mailers sent out by Republican candidate Ramey Johnson’s campaign decry her Democratic opponent, Lakewood City Councilwoman Rebekah Stewart, for using her City Council position as a “stepping-stone” for a statehouse run. But on the other side of that same mailer, Johnson touted her own 10 years of prior experience on Lakewood’s City Council as a reason why she herself should be elected in November. Johnson and Stewart are both running for Colorado House District 30. The district is currently represented by Democrat Chris Kennedy, who defeated his Republican opponent by over 30 points in 2022. The mailer argued that Stewart’s campaign for the Colorado legislature shows she “lacks commitment to her current constituents.” In an emailed response to the Colorado Times Recorder, Johnson claimed that this statement was based on her own conversations with with Stewart’s constituents. “She served on city council for just a short time before making it known that she would run for a state office,” Johnson wrote. “That is a significant jump from one level of government to another. Her constituents who I talked with are concerned that she is using her councilor position as a steppingstone to a state office.” Stewart was first elected to Lakewood City Council in 2021. Her current term is set to end just over a year from now, in November 2025. Johnson has been a fixture in Lakewood politics for multiple decades: she ran multiple times to represent Lakewood in House District 23, succeeding in 2002 but failing to be reelected for a second term. She later won a 2011 vacancy election for Lakewood City Council, and was reelected to her seat twice in 2013 and 2017. Her final term ended in 2021. Johnson also unsuccessfully ran for Lakewood Mayor twice, in 2015 and 2019. Both runs took place while she was still in the middle of a City Council term. In an email to the Colorado Times Recorder, Stewart referenced these frequent runs, writing, “I find these kinds of statements ironic, given that my opponent has run for office more than 10 times, including two failed runs for mayor while she was still serving on the Lakewood City council.” She continued, “I’m running to continue to represent the constituents I already have the honor of serving and bring more power to their voices, needs, and hopes at the state level. The people of House District 30 deserve a Representative who is focused on the issues that affect them most—like housing affordability, protecting our clean air and water, and increasing access to mental healthcare. They’re not interested in dirty politics and mudslinging and neither am I.” In recent years, Johnson helped organize [a screening of a documentary](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2023/10/panelists-at-climate-denier-documentary-premiere-claim-climate-activists-are-anti-human/56558/) claiming climate change is a hoax, which starred her husband Walt Johnson. Along with over 100 other Colorado Republicans, she also [signed onto](https://coloradotimesrecorder.com/2024/01/qanon-promoters-pro-trump-supreme-court-brief-signed-by-several-colorado-gop-leaders/59368/) QAnon promoter Terpsehore Maras’ amicus brief intended to persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to allow Donald Trump to remain on the Colorado Ballot. Maras’ brief claimed that Trump did not engage in insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. Johnson’s full response to the Colorado Times Recorder is included below. Thank you for asking me these pertinent questions. First, my opponent Rebekah Stewart is a nice lady. We have a cordial relationship. Early on, I invited her out for coffee to start things off on a “good foot”. She served on city council for just a short time before making it known that she would run for a state office. That is a significant jump from one level of government to another. Her constituents who I talked with are concerned that she is using her councilor position as a steppingstone to a state office. Additionally, some of her constituents have told me they believe it is because she is anxious to leave this position and that she is not committed to her ward, its issues or her city council responsibilities. As you know, I am a former state legislator and served on the city council for 10 years. This service has given me a depth and breadth of experience that only comes from time serving in an elected position. When I met with Rebekah, I asked her, “Why are you running”. She had only served for such a short time in her current position. She could not give an answer. I hope this helps you understand more fully the language in the mailing. Respectfully, Ramey Johnson",

    "text": "By Gustaf Kilander ,\n7 minutes ago Former President Donald Trump has again suggested his wildest tax reform plan - fully removing federal income taxes and saying that the lost revenue can be replaced by funds received from tariffs.\nAppearing at a barbershop in the Bronx on Monday in a segment broadcast on Fox News, Trump was asked when the country could end all federal taxes. The former president suggested returning to the policies of the 1800s.\n“It had all tariffs — it didn’t have an income tax,” Trump said. “Now we have income taxes, and we have people that are dying. They’re paying tax, and they don’t have the money to pay the tax.”\nSimilarly, in June, Trump suggested that federal income taxes be replaced by funds obtained via tariffs, something he has not explained further.\nExperts on both sides of the aisle have criticized his ideas as mathematically unworkable and damaging to the economy, The New York Times noted. Legislators are unlikely to end the income tax even if Republicans gain control of Congress, even as tariffs and tax cuts have been some of the top issues pushed by Trump.\n“There is a way if what I’m planning comes out,” Trump said about removing federal income taxes.\nThe Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a liberal think tank, found that Trump’s plans would raise the tax burden on lower-income Americans, cut taxes for the wealthy and significantly add to the deficit.\nMeanwhile, Congressional Republicans are working on tax plans to pass sweeping changes as soon as the new Congress is sworn in next year if they win majorities in both chambers and if Trump manages to win back the White House . GOP leaders are laying the groundwork for Trump’s first 100 days of his second term, set to take quick action to pass a budget reconciliation package to enact tax cuts worth trillions.\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump (L) chats with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R) alongside former first lady Melania Trump during the 79th Annual Alfred E.

McConnell’s folks and Thune’s folks have been leading the effort on our side,” the aide told the outlet.\n“A lot of the House committees have been putting work in on this – some are further along than others,” they said. “Efforts are underway. Hitting the ground running is something everyone wants to be able to do.”\nSenator John Barrasso told The Hill that he has been meeting with those in charge of Trump’s transition team to plan for the first 100 days of the next possible Republican administration.\nJohnson spoke to Senate Republicans over the summer about passing tax cuts, spending cuts, and regulatory reforms. The package would pass under the Senate’s budget reconciliation process to avoid being thwarted by filibustering Democrats.\nThis summer, Texas Senator John Cornyn, who’s also running to replace McConnell, said Johnson was “pretty clear that they want to try to go big, and that means more than just extending the tax cuts,” according to The Hill.",

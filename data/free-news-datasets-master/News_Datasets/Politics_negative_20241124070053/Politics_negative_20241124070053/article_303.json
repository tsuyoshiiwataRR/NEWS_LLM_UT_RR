    "text": "WASHINGTON Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) said in a newly unearthed interview from 2022 that women who have abortions hate the country and hate that baby because they know if they carried their pregnancies to term, it would mean responsibility. Schweikert, who is currently facing a tough reelection bid, made his comments in July 2022 on a conservative radio program, The Seth Leibsohn Show. During the interview, host Seth Leibsohn referenced a woman in a House oversight committee hearing who had recently testified that having an abortion was the best decision shed made and an act of self-love. Think about what she just said, Schweikert said. You have a number of these [inaudible] that life means nothing, self means everything. Leibsohn agreed as Schweikert went on. Its about self. Its about self. Its about self, said the Arizona congressman. And you wonder why they hate the country because they only care about themselves. https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gop-david-schweikert-abortion-arizona_n_67194bd5e4b0ede6b2bff075?ybp",

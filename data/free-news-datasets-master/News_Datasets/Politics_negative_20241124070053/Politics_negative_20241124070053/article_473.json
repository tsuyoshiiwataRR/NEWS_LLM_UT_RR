    "text": "By Grey Papke ,\n18 minutes ago\nDenver Broncos wide receiver Josh Reynolds was wounded in a shooting early Friday morning.\nReynolds and two friends were leaving a strip club early Friday when they were pursued and shot at, according to police documents obtained by Janet Oravetz of 9News . The three were driving on I-25 when two drivers followed them and fired shots.\nReynolds was shot twice, once in his left arm and once in the back of his head. There was no further word on his condition. Another man was shot in the back, while a third victim suffered injuries from broken glass.\nDenver police announced Wednesday that two suspects had been taken into custody in relation to the shootings.\nReynolds signed a two-year free agent contract with the Broncos during the offseason. The eighth-year wide receiver has appeared in five games for Denver this season, tallying 12 catches for 183 yards and a touchdown. He is currently on injured reserve due to a broken finger he suffered during the teamâ€™s Week 5 win over the Raiders.\nThe post Broncos WR Josh Reynolds wounded in shooting appeared first on Larry Brown Sports .",

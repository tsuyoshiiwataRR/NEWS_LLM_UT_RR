    "text": "Blackburn blames Chinese bot election attack on a weak Biden administration By Cami Mondeaux Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Email Print October 24, 2024 4:40 pm . Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Email Print A GOP lawmaker targeted by Chinese-controlled social media accounts is blaming the Biden administration, claiming that the U.S. government has not been aggressive enough to prevent such foreign attacks.\nSen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) accused the Biden administration of being “too friendly” with the Chinese government , leading to a disinformation campaign led by Chinese social media bots ahead of the November election against downballot Republicans. The senator’s comments come after she and a handful of other lawmakers known for making anti-Chinese statements were targeted online as they seek reelection.\n“It should not surprise anyone,” Blackburn told the Washington Examiner in an interview. “We’re the ones that have said China needs to be held to account and China needs to keep their end of the trade deals and China should be held responsible for taking our jobs and sending us a virus.”\nBlackburn said the attacks were China’s way of “getting even” with the lawmakers because of their efforts to thwart the Chinese government. However, the senator said the foreign country likely felt emboldened to do so because the Biden administration “has been more friendly to them.”\n“I have gotten frustrated with this administration because they will not require China to keep their end of the bargain on our trade deals,” Blackburn said. “This administration removes sanctions, and you’ve got this administration that’s just been lax on holding China to account with their activity with our allies, so I’m not surprised.”\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to the White House for comment.\nSocial media accounts specifically targeted Blackburn with claims that the Republican senator has accepted $700,000 in campaign donations from opioid manufacturers, according to a report by Microsoft published earlier this week. The bots have also sought to promote Tennessee state Rep. Gloria Johnson, who is challenging Blackburn for her seat next month.\nIt is not clear whether lawmakers will push for legislation to crack down on foreign interference as Congress is not scheduled to return to Washington until after the election. However, Blackburn told the Washington Examiner that “some of us have already talked a good bit” about efforts to address the online attacks when they reconvene.\n“You’ll continue to see these efforts,” Blackburn said. “There should be bipartisan agreement that we hold China to account. Their goal is to be globally dominant by the time we get to the midpoint of this century, and if we are not firm with them, they’re going to continue to push forward.”\nOther lawmakers targeted in the disinformation campaign include Reps. Michael McCaul (R-TX) and Barry Moore (R-AL) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL).\nMcCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has been a target of the Chinese government after he called the Communist Party of China “the greatest generational challenge we face today” in a report released in 2020. China later banned the congressman from visiting the country after he visited Taiwan in 2023.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n“I consider it a badge of honor when the CCP — a leading abuser of human rights, censor of free speech, and oppressor of its own people — takes issue with my work,” McCaul said in a statement. “I’ve made standing up to the CCP a central part of my career because I believe they pose a generational threat to the United States and our interests around the globe, and I won’t be intimidated by their scare tactics.”\nIt is not clear whether McCaul will push for any legislative action in the House related to the social media attacks. The Washington Examiner contacted a spokesperson for his office for any future plans.\nTags 2024 Elections China Congress Marsha Blackburn Social Media Related Content Immigration Trudeau announces immigration restrictions as electoral defeat looms Beltway Confidential Land and labor acknowledgments teach students to hate America Presidential Trump’s comments about ‘ethnic cleansing’ leave Armenians ‘cautiously optimistic’ Beltway Confidential Will Kamala Harris cause a Democratic Party Jan. 6 crisis if she loses?

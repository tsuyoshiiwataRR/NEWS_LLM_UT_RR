    "text": "2024-10-24 19:25:00\nA lack d’ “impartiality” of “multiple controversies and a climate of strong internal conflicts ” a distrust of national authorities… The list of “dysfunctions” reproached by the regional health agency (ARS) to the departmental council of the order of doctors (CDOM) of Reunion is long.\nThese grievances led, on Wednesday October 23, the director general of the island’s ARS, Gérard Cotellon, to sign an order dissolving the CDOM, which brings together around 3,300 practitioners. “An exceptional decision” he explains, in order to “restore the conditions of confidence of doctors in Reunion Island”.\nThis dissolution was carried out at the request of the National Council of the Order of Physicians (CNOM), which had already requested it in 2022, without obtaining it. When contacted, the CNOM refused to communicate further and limited itself to recognizing the exceptional nature of such a decision, only mentioning “two precedents known and confirmed by the order” .\nRetaliatory measure In addition to the violent disputes which have pitted doctors against each other for several years, divided between the majority elected to the CDOM in 2021 and its opposition, two closely intertwined cases have prompted the ARS to react. First, the elections of June 21 aimed at renewing half of the departmental council. A vote finally canceled by the administrative court of Saint-Denis, on October 17, following irregularities.\nThen, the criminal and ordinal complaints launched in 2023 by a general practitioner on the island, Lise François, who accuses her ex-husband, Benjamin Dusang, doctor, of domestic violence, who chaired the CDOM between 2021 and June 2024. During the last ordinary elections, two pairs, including that of Ms. François, were prohibited from running, by decision of the CDOM. The doctor then denounced a retaliatory measure.\nRead also | Article reserved for our subscribers In Reunion, the president of the order of doctors accused of violence by his ex-partner\nAdd to your selections\nThe administrative judges agreed with him, finding that the two pairs had been “irregularly ousted”. In his decree, of which The World has taken note, the ARS considers that the departmental council refused to « with place under control » of the National Council, which had opposed the rejection of the candidacies of the two pairs.\n“Relieved” This election only accentuated the accusations of the CNOM, which already criticized Reunion officials for having suppressed Ms. François’ complaint of domestic violence against her former spouse. Following the complainant’s report, in June 2023, the CDOM “limited himself to auditioning Doctor Benjamin Dusang” even though he presided over order on the island, and never heard the complainant, notes the ARS. The CDOM then chose not to refer the matter to the disciplinary chamber, despite the CNOM’s recommendations.\nYou have 24.11% of this article left to read.

The decision‌ to dissolve⁢ the‍ CDOM has certainly‍ caught many by surprise. Can you tell us what prompted this exceptional measure?\nGérard Cotellon: Thank you for⁣ having me.⁢ The‌ decision to dissolve​ the CDOM was not taken ⁣lightly. We identified ‌significant dysfunctions within the organization, including a lack of impartiality ⁣and a climate rife with internal conflicts. This has bred distrust among medical practitioners on‍ the island and has‌ directly impacted their ability to work collaboratively for the benefit of the community.\nInterviewer: You mentioned a series of grievances against the CDOM. ‌Can you elaborate on some of these issues?\nGérard Cotellon: ⁣ Certainly. Among the main ​concerns ⁤were multiple controversies stemming from divisive disputes amongst doctors and irregularities in the recent elections aimed at renewing​ part of the council. ⁢Beyond⁢ that, we’ve seen escalating tensions tied to personal grievances, particularly involving criminal complaints made by a practitioner. These issues have severely undermined the⁤ council’s credibility​ and functionality.\nInterviewer: The National Council⁢ of ​the Order of Physicians had requested this dissolution back in 2022. Why⁣ was the decision made now?\nGérard ‍Cotellon: The situation has reached ⁣a critical ‍point ⁤where trust ​among doctors in ⁤Reunion Island is‌ at an all-time low.‌ With ongoing ​issues unresolved and the cancellation of ⁢the recent⁤ elections adding fuel to the fire, we⁣ felt⁣ immediate action was necessary to restore a functioning medical authority that can effectively oversee and support our health professionals.\nInterviewer: Dissolving an⁣ organization like the CDOM is a significant step. What are the next steps for the medical community in Reunion Island following this decision?\nGérard Cotellon: Our ‍primary goal is to​ create an environment where‍ doctors can⁤ feel secure and supported. We’ll be working closely with stakeholders‍ to establish a temporary governing​ structure that can ensure continuity of services and oversight. In⁣ parallel, ⁣we will initiate a ⁣transparent process for rebuilding‍ the council in a manner that fosters⁤ equity and impartiality.\nInterviewer: It’s ‍clear this ‌is a pivotal moment⁣ for healthcare ​governance ⁤in Reunion. What message would you like to send to⁢ the medical professionals ‍on the island?\nGérard Cotellon: I want to reassure them that we⁤ are committed to restoring ‌their trust, ​and that we recognize the challenges⁣ they face. ⁤This transition will be handled with care and in ​consultation with the medical community so they can⁣ actively participate in shaping a new, inclusive leadership structure that better ⁣serves everyone involved.\nInterviewer: Thank you, Mr. Cotellon, for shedding⁤ light on this important issue. ‌\nGérard Cotellon: Thank you for the opportunity to discuss⁤ this. It’s ‍an important moment for our healthcare system, and I hope for a ​constructive path forward.\nInterviewer: What steps will you take next to ensure that the medical community in Reunion Island can rebuild trust and move forward successfully?\nGérard Cotellon: Our immediate priority is to establish a provisional authority to oversee the medical profession in Reunion. This body will work to ensure transparency and reinstate impartial governance. We will also provide a platform for open dialogue among practitioners. We believe that fostering communication is essential to healing past divisions and preventing such dysfunction in the future.\nInterviewer: Given the intense conflicts, do you anticipate resistance from some members of the medical community regarding this decision?\nGérard Cotellon: Yes, there will likely be mixed reactions. Change can be difficult, especially after so much turmoil. However, we are committed to demonstrating that this measure is in the best interest of all doctors and, ultimately, the public. It’s crucial that we regain trust and create an environment where healthcare professionals can collaborate effectively.\nInterviewer: There have been allegations of suppressed complaints of domestic violence within the CDOM leadership. How will you address or investigate these serious accusations moving forward?\nGérard Cotellon: Addressing such serious allegations is paramount. We will be launching an independent review to examine these claims and any related issues within the council. It’s essential that all professionals feel safe and supported within their working environment, and no grievance should go unheard or unaddressed.\nInterviewer: Lastly, what message do you want to send to the healthcare professionals and citizens of Reunion Island about this decision?\nGérard Cotellon: I want to reassure both practitioners and the public that our goal is to enhance the integrity and functionality of our healthcare system. By dissolving the CDOM, we are taking a necessary step towards rebuilding a healthcare authority that prioritizes the wellbeing of both medical professionals and the communities they serve. We are hopeful that this move will lay the foundation for a stronger, more cohesive medical community going forward. Thank you for having me.",

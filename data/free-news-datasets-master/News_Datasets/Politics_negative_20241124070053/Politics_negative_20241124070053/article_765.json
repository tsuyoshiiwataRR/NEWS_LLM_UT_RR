    "text": "Drew Allen explains why he believes Vice President Kamala Harris is the least qualified Presidential candidate in history. She was asked again by a reporter what she would do differently than President Biden, and her answer will shock you. New polling shows that Vice President Kamala Harris is outperforming both President Biden and former Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton, with women over the age of fifty. Their most important issue? The economy.\nPlus, Former President Trump enrages Democrats with his political stunt at McDonald’s. Finally, U.S. intel is leaked exposing Israel’s plans to strike Iran. Is this the biggest scandal no Democrat is talking about?\n“Follow ‘The Drew Allen Show on DailyClout’ on Rumble! https://rumble.com/c/TheDrewAllenShowOnDailyClout/videos\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nBirch Gold Group: “A Gold IRA from Birch Gold Group is the ultimate inflation hedge for your savings in uncertain times.

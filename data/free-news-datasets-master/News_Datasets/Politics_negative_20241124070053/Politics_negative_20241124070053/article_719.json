    "text": "AMMAN, Oct. 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday strongly condemned Israel's attack on a school sheltering displaced people in the Nuseirat area of central Gaza, which killed at least 17 Palestinians and injured more than 52 others. In a statement, the ministry described the attack as \"a heinous crime,\" \"a blatant violation of international law,\" and \"a systematic continuation of targeting civilians.\" The ministry's spokesperson, Sufian Qudah, reiterated the kingdom's absolute rejection and condemnation of the ongoing Israeli \"crimes\" against civilians, saying that Israel disregards the international calls to stop the military offensive, which has led to an unprecedented humanitarian disaster in the territory. Qudah also urged the international community, particularly the UN Security Council, to assume its responsibilities by compelling Israel to immediately end its hostility and continuous violations of international law, ensuring protection for the Palestinian people and holding the perpetrators accountable.

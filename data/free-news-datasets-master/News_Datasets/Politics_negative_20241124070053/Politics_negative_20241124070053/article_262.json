    "text": "According to a Wednesday report from Microsoft, U.S. Rep. Barry Moore (R-Enterprise) is one of a handful of congressional candidates being targeted by Chinese bots ahead of the November 5 election, both for policies critical of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and supportive of Israel. The report published by the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) claims to have discovered sustained attempts by Russia, Iran and China to influence the upcoming November 5 election. The report claims that the Russian and Iranian bots are primarily focused on the presidential campaign, with Russia targeting Vice President Kamala Harris and Iran targeting former President Donald Trump. However, China seems more focused on targeting congressional candidates with a history of policies aimed against the CCP. According to the report, the Chinese bots have spent months bombarding candidates like Moore, promoting their opponents, and making accusations of corruption. [Microsoft Elections Report 5 on Russian Influence](https://www.scribd.com/document/783896783/Microsoft-Elections-Report-5-on-Russian-Influence#from_embed) by [Craig Monger](https://www.scribd.com/user/635371466/Craig-Monger#from_embed) on Scribd “Starting in July 2024 and accelerating in September 2024, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security-linked influence actor Microsoft tracks as Taizi Flood (a.k.a. ‘Spamouflage’) launched campaigns critical of several Republican politicians including candidates up for election this November,” the report reads. “The candidates for seats in both the House and the Senate have all publicly denounced the People’s Republic of China (PRC), making them attractive targets of Chinese influence operations. Moore was listed in the report alongside U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) and U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). The bots appear to target Moore’s support of Israel, with many comments making antisemitic statements throughout Moore’s social media accounts.

The United States must be prepared to stand against Chinese aggression and continue to stand with Israel and Taiwan.” To connect with the author of this story or to comment, email [craig.monger@1819news.com.](mailto:craig.monger@1819news.com) Don't miss out!

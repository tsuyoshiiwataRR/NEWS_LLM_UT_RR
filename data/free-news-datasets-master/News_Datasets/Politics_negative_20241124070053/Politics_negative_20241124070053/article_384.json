    "text": "/ world today news/ In an effort to reduce inflation and fuel prices, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to the highest levels since 2007. The US government bond market couldn’t hold out and collapsed. Furthermore, public debt has reached a new all-time high. Investors note: the situation is dangerous: the supply of securities already exceeds demand, they are starting to get rid of them. And high interest rates and the risk of unsustainable debt pushed the economy into recession as early as the fourth quarter.\nDebt collapse\nThe Federal Reserve has been aggressively raising interest rates for a year and a half. They are now in the 5.25 to 5.5% range, a 16-year high.\nCleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said inflation remains “too high” even though there are many signs that price pressures are easing and the economy is rebalancing. However, “upside risks to the outlook still prevail.”\nHowever, investors could not stand the regulator’s actions. The new fiscal year in the United States began on October 1, and the next day the government debt market collapsed.\nOn October 2, the 10-year government bond yield jumped to 5% (not since 2007). As a result, the price of securities fell dramatically.\n“This is due to the sale of short-term bonds in a context of an increase in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate: the new bonds offer a higher yield than those previously issued. On some days, sales volumes increase. Not only residents, but also holders of other countries are getting rid of bonds,” notes Artyom Golubev, associate professor, Department of Economics at RANHIGS.\nInvestors fear the Fed will continue this policy into 2024.\nIn fact, Loretta Mester admitted, “I suspect we’ll have to raise the federal funds rate again this year and then leave it at that level for a while.”\nHuge debt\nOther factors also undermined demand for U.S. Treasuries. In particular, the growing budget deficit and the unsustainable public debt, which has updated the record again: 33,442 trillion dollars. Only on the first day of the new financial year it increased by 275 billion, which is more than the entire sovereign debt of Russia. The budget deficit in August jumped 29% to 219 billion. Expenses increased by 19.2% to 523 billion, while revenues were only 303 billion.\n“Investor concerns about the fiscal deficit contributed to the sharp sell-off that pushed government bonds to 16-year lows,” Reuters notes.\nDue to rising costs, the government and Treasury will have to issue more and more debt. According to Fitch forecasts, the budget deficit will reach 6.3% of GDP this year (previously it was 3.7%).\n“Oversupply of government bonds will outstrip demand,” JPMorgan Chase analysts warn.\nFinally, government bonds are affected by the loss of their top sovereign credit rating. In August, Fitch downgraded the US credit rating for the first time in 30 years.\n“In this context, the collapse was inevitable. Naturally, such events undermine demand and confidence in US government bonds,” says Oleg Vorobyov, a member of the trade committee of Business Russia.\nRisks of recession\nRising interest rates make it more expensive for families and businesses to borrow and slow down bank lending. As a result, the economy slows down.\nThe US economy now appears quite strong, with GDP growing for the fourth consecutive quarter. According to the latest estimate in the second quarter of 2.1% year-on-year.\n“The aggressive attitude of the representatives of the Federal Reserve is also due to the fact that the economy seems stable, the risks of a recession are low. Therefore, the rate can be kept high for a longer period of time,” notes Mikhail Denislamov , an analyst.\nAt the same time, according to Fitch forecasts, the United States will enter a recession in the first half of 2024, due to the lagged effect of tightening credit conditions and Federal Reserve policies.\nThe biggest danger remains excessive spending and disagreements in Congress over how to cut it. According to economists, if inflation does not fall soon – and this will only be possible by reducing government spending – the United States will face another large-scale economic crisis.\nTranslation: v.

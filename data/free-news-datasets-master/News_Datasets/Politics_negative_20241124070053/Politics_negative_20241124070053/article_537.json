    "text": "Fenerbahce 1-1 Manchester United: Red Devils pegged back again in frustrating draw as Jose Mourinho sent off Updated 24/10/2024 at 21:13 GMT Manchester United were unable to hold onto a lead once again as they were frustrated in a 1-1 draw at Fenerbahce in the UEFA Europa League. Christian Eriksen put the Premier League side ahead in the first half but they were pegged back after Youssef En-Nesyri's header early in the second half. Fenerbahce boss Jose Mourinho was sent to the stands for his protestations over a refereeing decision. Jose Mourinho was shown a red card as his Fenerbahce side came from behind to earn a 1-1 draw against Manchester United in a high-octane UEFA Europa League clash in Istanbul. The former Red Devils boss was sent to the stands after reacting angrily to seeing his team denied what he felt should have been a second-half penalty for a trip on Bright Osayi-Samuel. United had weathered some early pressure to silence a typically hostile crowd on 15 minutes when Christian Eriksen pinged a brilliant first-time strike into the top corner from just inside the area. Marcus Rashford went close to adding a second with a lovely run and shot before Andre Onana produced an outstanding double save to keep out two close-range headers from Youssef En-Nesyri. However, the former Sevilla striker – who had scored twice when the La Liga side knocked United out of this competition back in 2023 - levelled within four minutes of the restart when he headed home an inviting left-wing cross. United controlled much of the second period but could not find the winner as they once again let a lead slip to make it three successive draws in this competition. Next up, The Red Devils visit West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday. Talking Point - A solid point but losing a lead continues to be an Achilles Heel Erik ten Hag’s team selection raised a few eyebrows ahead of kick off – not least in the TNT Sports studio where former Red Devils stars Owen Hargreaves and Paul Scholes were a bit perplexed to see full back Noussair Mazraoui operating in a No.10 role. However, the new-look United were energetic and lively, countering dangerously and throwing their bodies on the line when Fenerbahce did turn the screw in an impressive first half showing. But a 1-0 interval lead is never comfortable for a Red Devils side that aren’t known for keeping teams out and it was perhaps unsurprising that an early lapse following the restart saw them fail to win after scoring first for the sixth time in their last eight European matches. A draw was not a disaster by any means here, but the familiar pattern will be frustration for United supporters, who will still have high hopes of going deep in this competition despite what feels like a long wait for a win - and the concerning current position of 21st in the UEFA Europa League standings . Player of the match Manuel Ugarte (Man United). The combative Uruguayan is still finding his feet following his move from PSG, but this was arguably his best display so far. The 23-year-old had a role in winning the ball and starting the move for Eriksen’s opener and made several important interceptions and tackles, including a goal-saving block in the first half.

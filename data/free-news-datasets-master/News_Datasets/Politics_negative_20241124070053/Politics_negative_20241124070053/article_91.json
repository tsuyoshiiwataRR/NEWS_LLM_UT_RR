    "text": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (KY3) - With no-excuse in-person absentee voting underway across Missouri, make sure you know who is collecting your information. A western Missouri county clerk reported to the secretary of state’s office that a voter showed up and was expected to dodge lines, claiming he had signed up online for an appointment to vote. There’s no such thing as a fast pass. “You can’t have reservations, like you would at a restaurant for voting,” said Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft. “Our clerks and election boards are taking everyone as they come. We don’t want people to think, oh, I signed up for an appointment, but we don’t do that. It’s whoever is there first we deal with.” The voter provided personal information, including home address, phone number, and email. Instead of third-party groups, always use trusted sources like county clerks, local election boards, and the Missouri Secretary of State’s office.

    "text": "“They have snuck a dictatorship in through the back door.” “(Sánchez) props up the Bolivarian dictatorship.” “Some gangsters and some Stalinists.” Or the “I like fruit” from the guest gallery of the Congress of Deputies, which was actually a serious insult to the president of the Government. These are some of the phrases that Isabel Diaz Ayuso has launched against Pedro Sánchez, the Executive and the PSOE.\nAll of them got a big media stir and this Wednesday they did it again: “Spain is already a police state” for the Government’s “excessive and authoritarian control over citizens”, the Madrid leader said this Tuesday at an event organized by the newspaper The Confidential .\nThe national leadership of his party, through the mouth of the general secretary, Cuca Gamarra, avoided endorsing this statement and the Minister of the Interior, Fernando Grande-Marlaska assured that Ayuso “has lost perspective on everything.”\nBut behind this verbal escalation there are those who see a clear strategy. The first, his party companions. As this media already told there is an increasingly large sector of the PP that is uncomfortable with this discretionary fire against Sánchez that on many occasions disrupts Génova’s strategy and wears down Alberto Núñez Feijóo.\nIt is the most interesting “variable” of Ayuso’s political style, according to the political scientist and professor of Sociology at the University of Valencia, Aida Vizcaíno Estevan . “What it does is differentiate itself and set the pace with respect to Feijóo and that is the analysis that I do, although it is a short-term strategy. In this sense we are not talking much beyond 2027,” he reasons in conversation with this newspaper. He identifies two other effects: the intended one, he says, which is to “discourage interest in politics and muddy the political-media battle” and “to move possible competitors around the board.” By raising the Ayuso tone manages to seduce a part of the far-right electorate .\nIt is something that both the PP barons and the Feijóo leadership recognize and that leads them to assume that, despite the controversies she generates, she is an “essential” political leader for them.\nNuria Alabao an analyst specialized in the extreme right, expands this vision: “This is the strategy chosen above all in the PP of Madrid. (Ayuso) She was an advisor and worked with Esperanza Aguirre, who was the importer of the American cultural wars into Madrid politics. , especially in those years of the Zapatero Government,” he points out.\nLike Vizcaíno Estevan, Alabao does not doubt that Ayuso is making “it seem like everything is the same.” The president of the Community of Madrid faces the judicial situation of your partner who has admitted committing a tax crime, confronted with the Government. “It manages to create a kind of noise that Deep down what citizens see is a cloud of confrontation and they are not able to discriminate what is really happening,” he says.\nSol has no intention of stopping this verbal escalation, convinced that It benefits Ayuso at all levels . Sánchez has also found the perfect antagonist in her.\n“In this framework of the campaign in the United States between Trump and Harris, what we are seeing is that Trump is going from being a person to a character and approaching parody. Something that can be seen from certain positions. Transferring it to Ayuso, the question is how much “There is no way to measure this tone or if it can come close to that parody,” emphasizes Vizcaíno Esteban.\n#Ayusos #verbal #escalation",

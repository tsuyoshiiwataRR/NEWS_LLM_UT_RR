    "text": "The San Antonio Spurs and Dallas Mavericks open their seasons Thursday. Tip-off from the American Airlines Center is set for 7:30 p.m. ET (TNT). Let’s analyze BetMGM Sportsbook’s NBA odds around the Spurs vs. Mavericks odds and make our expert NBA picks and predictions for the best bets.\nSeason series: First meeting; Dallas swept 4-0 last season\nThe Spurs went 22-60 in 2023-24, the first season of the C Victor Wembanyama era for San Antonio. The Spurs acquired F Harrison Barnes from the Sacramento Kings in July — part of a 3-team deal with the Chicago Bulls — and signed G Chris Paul , who averaged just 9.2 points per game (PPG) with the Golden State Warriors last season.\nThe Mavericks went 50-32 last season — good for 5th in the Western Conference — and worked their way through the playoffs before losing 4-1 to the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals. The highlight of their offseason was bringing in G Klay Thompson from the Warriors — part of a 6-team sign-and-trade — to form a big 3 alongside G Luka Doncic and G Kyrie Irving .\nSpurs at Mavericks odds Provided by BetMGM Sportsbook ; access USA TODAY Sports Scores and Sports Betting Odds hub for a full list of NBA odds . Lines last updated at 4:47 p.m. ET.\nMoneyline (ML) : Spurs +310 (bet $100 to win $310) | Mavericks -400 (bet $400 to win $100) Against the spread (ATS) : Spurs +8.5 (-105) | Mavericks -8.5 (-115) Over/Under (O/U) : 227.5 (O: -110 | U: -110) Spurs at Mavericks key injuries Spurs\nG Devin Vassell (foot) out Mavericks\nG Dante Exum (wrist) out For most recent updates: Official NBA injury report .\nPlay our free daily Pick’em Challenge and win! Play now !\nSpurs at Mavericks picks and predictions Prediction Mavericks 111, Spurs 110\nMoneyline The Mavericks (-400) will likely beat the Spurs for a 5th straight meeting, but this line has too much vig to recommend.\nPASS . Bet the spread and/or total instead.\nAgainst the spread While the Spurs struggled overall in 2023-24, they ended the season on a high note, covering 9 of their final 11 games. Their regular-season wins total is set at 35.5 (O: -120 | U: +100 at BetMGM Sportsbook ), so the market is expecting them to take a huge step forward this year with Barnes and Paul.\nDallas was nothing special at home last season, going 26-25 ATS, according to Teamrankings.com. It will need time to fully integrate Thompson into the offense, and laying 8.5 points against an improved Spurs team seems like an overreaction to last season’s impressive playoff run.\nBET SPURS +8.5 ( -105 ).\nOver/Under Dallas was the 3rd-best Under bet when playing at home last season, going 20-31 O/U (60.8%).\nSan Antonio was 17-22-2 O/U in road games, the 7th-highest clip for cashing Unders. We can only assume that Wembanyama will continue to progress as a defender this season. The Paul signing also gives him another leader on the defensive end — and hopefully helps us cash this Under!\nBET UNDER 227.5 ( -110 ).\nLooking to check out the latest NBA odds and perhaps make a wager?

    "text": "It was a political stunt for the ages when former President Donald Trump donned a McDonald’s apron to work the fry machine and drive-thru window. Whether it helps reelect him remains to be seen, but let’s hope it does one thing for sure.\nLet’s hope it symbolizes the dignity and importance of entry-level work.\nFast-food jobs become more important as inflation prices millions of Americans out of fast casual and sit-down restaurants. As the value of these jobs continues to rise, we see employment ads offering considerably more remuneration than the highest state minimum wages.\nToday’s fast-food employees are increasingly rewarded with health insurance benefits, tuition assistance, flexible schedules and more. Some businesses offer hiring bonuses or “get paid the first day you work.”\nThough an assortment of entry-level employers offer the moon and stars to young unskilled workers, McDonald’s has come to symbolize the first job. In 2015, the company began marketing itself for offering “America’s Best First Job.”\nThe 20th and 21st centuries provide countless examples of people who began their working years at McDonald’s and/or other fast-food establishments.\nJeff Bezos, founder and former CEO of Amazon, has amassed a fortune worth hundreds of billions. For him, it all began with flipping burgers and fulfilling orders at age 16.\n“You can learn responsibility in any job if you take it seriously,” Bezos said, as quoted by Wired magazine. “You learn a lot as a teenager working at McDonald’s. It’s different from what you learn in school. Don’t underestimate the value of that!”\nTaylor Morrison, CEO of the Taylor Morrison homebuilding company, began working at McDonald’s at age 15, climbing the ranks to become the company’s marketing manager for San Diego stores by the time she turned 20.\n“Every 16-year-old should have to work at McDonald’s, because you really do learn how to work,” said Morrison, as quoted by Business Insider.\n“You have to pull back the equipment and sweep behind. There are no shortcuts. You had to do it right because it was such a part of their brand. There were a lot of life lessons in that job.”\nPaul Ryan, former speaker of the U.S. House, credits much of his success to fast-food experience.\n“When I was flippin’ burgers at McDonald’s, when I was standing in front of that big Hobart machine washing dishes or waiting tables, I never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life,” Ryan said during a 2012 speech.\n“I thought to myself, ‘I’m the American dream on a path and journey so that I can find happiness however I can find it myself.’”\nColorado’s unlikeliest member of Congress, Rep. Lauren Boebert, credits a McDonald’s job for keeping her off welfare — which she grew up on — and for showing her the freedom and fulfillment that comes with working for money.\nVice President Kamala Harris claims a McDonald’s work history, hoping it will help her become the first female president.\nSome of the most successful people in the world tell war stories of entry-level work — usually at a fast-food chain — before they mention Ivy League degrees or promotions in the suit-and-tie world.\nThat’s because all work is important. All work elevates, strengthens and enlightens the person putting in the hours. Politics aside, it is good to see our country’s most accomplished leaders highlighting entry-level work as the foundation for success.\nThe Gazette Editorial Board",

    "text": "Former President Donald Trump has launched a scathing attack on his former White House chief of staff, Retired Gen. John Kelly, calling him a \"lowlife\" and a \"total degenerate.\" This came in response to Kelly's recent comments, in which he criticized Trump’s alleged admiration for authoritarian rulers and his supposed desire for unchecked power.\nTaking to his Truth Social platform, Trump vehemently denied Kelly's claims, framing them as nothing more than fabrications driven by what he termed \"Trump Derangement Syndrome.\" In his post, Trump expressed gratitude for the support he has received against Kelly's accusations, asserting that his former chief of staff was both “tough and dumb,” qualities he believed did not serve Kelly well. \"The problem is his toughness morphed into weakness, because he became JELLO with time!\" Trump wrote.\nHe also took aim at a particularly controversial claim made by Kelly about Trump’s disrespect for military personnel. Kelly had alleged that Trump made derogatory comments about soldiers during his presidency, a story Trump was quick to label as a lie. \"The story about the Soldiers was A LIE, as are numerous other stories he told,\" Trump stated emphatically. Despite initially indicating that Kelly was not worth his time, Trump continued his tirade: \"Even though I shouldn’t be wasting my time with him, I always feel it’s necessary to hit back in pursuit of THE TRUTH.\"\nThe former president further accused Kelly of being ineffective during his time in the White House, claiming that he eventually stopped seeking Kelly’s advice altogether. \"John Kelly is a LOWLIFE, and a bad General, whose advice in the White House I no longer sought, and told him to MOVE ON!\" Trump wrote in the same post.\nThese remarks from Trump followed Kelly’s recent interviews, where he painted a deeply concerning picture of Trump’s mindset. In an interview with *The New York Times*, Kelly went as far as to claim that Trump \"certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.\" Kelly had also previously told *The Atlantic* that Trump expressed a desire for the U.S. military to show him the same level of loyalty as “Hitler’s generals” did to the Nazi regime during World War II.\nThese comments have not gone unnoticed in political circles. Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign was quick to amplify Kelly's warnings. In a public statement on Wednesday, Harris condemned Trump's alleged aspirations, calling him “increasingly unhinged and unstable.” She warned that, should Trump win a second term, people like Kelly—who, despite their later differences, had served as a check on some of Trump's more extreme impulses—would no longer be in place to offer resistance. “The bottom line is this, we know what Donald Trump wants. He wants unchecked power,” Harris said. “This is a window into who Donald Trump really is. From the people who know him best.”\nAs the feud between Trump and Kelly escalates, the retired general’s comments have further fueled concerns among Trump's critics about what a potential second term might look like. For now, Trump appears determined to discredit his former chief of staff, even as the broader political implications of Kelly's remarks continue to reverberate.\nBased on a report from the Hill 2024-10-25",

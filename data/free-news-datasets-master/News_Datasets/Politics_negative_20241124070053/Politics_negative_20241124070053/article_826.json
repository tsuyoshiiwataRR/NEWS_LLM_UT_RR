    "text": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz today refused to respond to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's call for an invitation from NATO to Ukraine to join the alliance. The request for the invitation is contained in the \"Plan for victory\", recently presented by Zelensky, reported France Press, quoted by BTA. \"It is important to realize that a country at war absolutely cannot become a member of NATO. Everyone knows it, there is no disagreement on this issue,\" Scholz said on Cet De Ef TV. He recalled that during the summits of the alliance in Vilnius last year and in Washington this year, the leaders outlined the prospect of Ukraine's accession, but when the allies decide this and the conditions for this are present. \"But I think beyond that there is no new need to make a decision at this time,\" he said. Last week, Zelensky requested an invitation from the alliance right now, which will be the only and true guarantee for the security of his country. He also demanded that Western countries lift restrictions on the use of weapons they provide to Ukraine to strike at Russia, as well as to deploy non-nuclear weapons of dissuasion on Ukrainian territory. None of these requests has so far met with unanimous support from the allies, notes AFP. During the interview tonight, Scholz reiterated his position that NATO should avoid becoming a party to the conflict launched by Russia against Ukraine in February 2022. He also reiterated his opposition to the delivery of German Taurus missiles. with a long range that could reach targets located far inside Russian territory - something that Ukraine has long wanted.",

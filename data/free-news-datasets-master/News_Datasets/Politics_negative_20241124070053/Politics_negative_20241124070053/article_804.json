    "text": "My initial reaction to seeing this headline was “yes, and you’re part of the reason why”, but the column about the candidates talking to every media outlet except the New York Times wasn’t as whiny as I expected from Douthat. ...the younger audiences Trump and Harris want to reach may not have a perception of politics apart from whatever they get through their TikTok feed or YouTube diet. This future is, as ever, unevenly distributed. There is still a big share of older Americans who experience politics through a daily newspaper, “60 Minutes” or “Face the Nation.” There is a share of Americans, the committed partisans and infovores, that will always supply an audience for national media operations. But as the first group ages further, the older dispensation will become more and more of a niche in its own right. A few prominent enterprises will endure, a much-diminished version of the mainstream media, but much of the industry will be a vast terra incognita of YouTube stars, podcasters and social media communities. Is this a dark future? Not in every respect. The terra incognita will probably be less vulnerable to establishment groupthink than the order it’s replacing. ...the younger audiences Trump and Harris want to reach may not have a perception of politics apart from whatever they get through their TikTok feed or YouTube diet.

I love that last line, since NYT is of course the leading purveyor of establishment groupthink. No, we won’t be sorry to see you go. --- Aside: this column came to me via the msn.com newsfeed, and if you follow the link, the msn url places it in the category “/health/weightloss”. LOLWTF? Maybe their AI editor just caught “smaller” in the headline and thought it was a diet story?",

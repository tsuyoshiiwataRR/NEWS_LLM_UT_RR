Additionally, the outlet asserts that the filing was reportedly made “just hours before” Bronny and LeBron took to the court in the Lakers’ season-opening game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.\nFurthermore, the outlet notes that filing was reportedly made in Los Angeles County by two plaintiffs. The pair are reportedly seeking unspecified damages.\nHere’s What Allegedly Occurred In The November 2022 Car Crash & What Will Reportedly Happen Next Per the outlet, the lawsuit alleges that April Almanza Lopez and Kiara Rae McGillen were driving on a highway on November 13, 2022. While traveling the roadway in Littlerock, California, the father and son reportedly “slammed into” their car.\nAdditionally, TMZ notes that Lopez and McGillen “sustained injuries that will require further medical attention.” PEOPLE notes that the women also paid for “physicians, surgeons, and others” for “examination, treatment, and care.”\nFurthermore, their vehicle was reportedly damaged and “has lost value due to the wreck.”\nLastly, PEOPLE notes that a hearing for the case has reportedly been scheduled for February 19, 2025.\nBronny & LeBron James Recently Made Their Father-Son Lakers Debut According to TMZ , LeBron and Bronny James’ debut on the court was nothing short of “memorable.” The outlet adds that the pair played together on the court for “several minutes,” and the Lakers ultimately took home a 110-103 victory.\nFurthermore, Bronny and LeBron are now the “first father-and-son duo to ever play in a game together.”\n“That moment, us being at the scorer’s table together and checking in together, is something I will never forget,” LeBron reportedly said postgame. “No matter how old I get, no matter how my memory may fade as I get older or whatever, I will never forget that moment.”\nRELATED: WATCH: LeBron James Weighs In On Bronny’s Lakers Draft Amid His Summer League Debut",

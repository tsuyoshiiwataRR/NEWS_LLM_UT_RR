This has allowed the migrants to remain in the country without consequences for violating federal immigration laws.\nThe administration allegedly also took advantage of a swelling backlog of immigration court cases to allow these individuals to continue to go free. Such “quiet amnesty,” according to the report, could prove detrimental to the country.\n“In the face of an unprecedented border crisis, the Biden-Harris Administration and Senate Democrats have chosen to ignore H.R. 2, the House-passed Secure the Border Act of 2023,” the document reads. “It is beyond time for President Biden and Vice President Harris to end the border crisis and stop their backdoor amnesty.”\nReport authors continued, calling on the Senate to pass the Secure the Border Act as the committee continues its “aggressive oversight” into the Biden-Harris administration’s immigration policies.\n“For nearly four years, the Biden-Harris Administration has systematically remade America’s immigration courts in the image of open-borders extremism,” the report reads. “Instead of encouraging immigration judges to adjudicate cases and order aliens removed from the United States, the Biden-Harris Administration has used the border crisis as a pretext to remove myriad cases from immigration judges’ dockets.”\nImmigration continues to be a thorn in Vice President Harris’s side as she campaigns for control of the Oval Office. In an interview with “60 Minutes” this month, Harris vowed to fix the \"longstanding\" problem with solutions \"at hand.\"\n“It's a longstanding problem,” she said of immigration. “And solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions.”\n\"But the numbers did quadruple under your, under your watch?\" interviewer Bill Whitaker asked.\n“And the numbers today, because of what we have done, we have cut the flow of illegal immigration by half,\" Harris responded.\nThe vice president this month, however, also said during an appearance on “The View” there is “not a thing” she would have done differently than Biden, a remark that drew the ire of some Republicans on social media.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment from The National News Desk on Thursday.\nFollow Jackson Walker on X at @_jlwalker_ for the latest trending national news.

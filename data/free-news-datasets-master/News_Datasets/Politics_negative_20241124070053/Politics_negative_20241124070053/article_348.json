In our first half hour we speak with Michael Lynk, a Canadian professor of Law and Former Special Rapporteur on Human rights in the Occupied Palestine territories about some of the pressing difficulties in arriving at a satisfactory legal solution. And in our second half hour we hear from Michel Chossudovsky of the centre for research on globalization and Global Research editor about how the focus of much of the peace movement is too much on Israel and not enough on the architects of Israel’s actions located in Washington DC.\nCredits:\nInterviews by Michael Welch\nNotes:\nVersion 1:\nDescription:\nLength (hh:mm:ss):\n00:59:13\nLanguage:\n1\nDate Recorded:\nOct. 24, 2024\nLocation Recorded:\nAnnouncer Script/Transcript:\nView Script\n#\nLabel\nLength\nFile Info\nDownloads\n1\n00:59:13\n128Kbps mp3\n(MB) None\nNone\nBrowse Programs\nby Popularity\nby Type\nAction/Event\nActuality (Uncut Material)\nAnnouncement\nCommentary\nDaily Program\nDocumentary\nInterview\nMusic\nNews Report\nRegular Show\nSpeech\nUnspecified\nWeekly Program\nby Topic\nby Length\n0-1 minute\n1-2 minutes\n2-5 minutes\n5-15 minutes\n15-30 minutes\n30-60 minutes\n60-90 minutes\n90-120 minutes\nover 120 minutes\nby Series\nby Contributor\nby Advisory\nUnknown\nNo Advisories\nContains Potentially Offensive Language\nFor Safe-Harbor (late-night broadcast) Only\nby License\nNon-Profit Only\nNo Excerpting\nContact Producer\nSee Notes\nLog In\nSign Up\nTranslate\nDeutsch\nEspañol\nFrançais\nItaliano\n日本語\nPolski\nPortuguês\nРусский",

    "text": "A Hamas hostage shocked the UN as she recounted the torture she endured in Gaza: “I was raped and hung upside down.”\nAmit Soussana, a 40-year-old lawyer, delivered a speech at the UN Security Council, vividly describing the horrors she experienced as a hostage of Hamas.\nAmit Soussana described the agonizing 55 days she spent as a hostage of Hamas in the Gaza Strip before the UN Security Council. The 40-year-old lawyer revealed that she was sexually assaulted and tortured while fearing for her life “every moment.”\nOn October 7, 2023, the day of the Hamas invasion, Amit was at home, sick, in the Kibbutz Kfar Aza. She heard gunshots and sent a message to her family, telling them she would try to hide in a safe place.\nHowever, Soussana was captured by Hamas members. Security cameras recorded her resistance, as she kicked and stubbornly refused to follow them. In the footage of her abduction, Soussana can be seen fighting back, while one of the terrorists carried her on his back to restrain her.\nAmit was freed after 55 days, along with other hostages.\nThe 40-year-old lawyer addressed the UN Security Council, describing the treatment she endured in Gaza.\n“I was alone, chained by the ankles with a metal chain, unable to move, and forced to beg to use the bathroom,” she said.\n“A Hamas terrorist guarding me sexually assaulted me. He forced me into the shower, following me closely with his gun pointed at me. His heavy breathing and gaze were terrifying… I didn’t have the strength to stop him,” she described.\n“I had no one to comfort me, and I had to obey the man who had just raped me most horrifically,” Soussana continued.\n“A few days later, I was moved to a new location, where other Hamas terrorists were watching me. There, they tortured me… They hung me upside down, beat me, and humiliated me. Every moment I feared for my life,” she recalled.\n“I Beg You, Don’t Turn a Blind Eye”\nAmit Soussana urged the members of the UN Security Council to end the hostilities in Gaza and Lebanon and to secure the release of all hostages.\nRegarding the hostages, she said, “Every day that passes causes them further psychological trauma and endangers their lives. Act before it’s too late.”\n“I beg you, don’t turn a blind eye to the horrific suffering of innocent civilians. It is your responsibility to protect human rights, combat terrorism, and bring the perpetrators to justice. Free the hostages and ensure no one else faces such a fate,” she said.",

    "text": "Many believed Magomed Ankalaev would be the one to challenge Alex Pereira for the title. Instead, it was Khalil Rountree who received the opportunity but ultimately fell short, losing to Pereira at UFC 307. Following the fight, Pereira claimed that Ankalaev had turned down the matchup. Now, Ankalaev asserts that he has been paired with Aleksandr Rakic for UFC 308, and as he prepares for this bout, he has fired verbal jabs at Pereira.\nAnkalaev is set to take on Rakic, presenting a formidable challenge as he seeks to maintain his unbeaten streak since 2018 and solidify his status as the top contender in the UFC light heavyweight division. He believes the UFC placed Rakić in front of him to block his path to a fight with ‘Poatan.’ Nevertheless, Ankalaev is focused on securing the win to earn his desired title shot. At the UFC 308 press conference, he remarked,\n“We know that Rakic is a great fighter. I think the only reason the UFC put him in front of me is to defend their champion. So, we’re going to go across from him, we’re going to roll him over, and then we’re going to move onto the champ.”\nThe Russian fighter has his sights set on becoming the next world champion, but he must first overcome Rakić this weekend. Despite the criticism directed at him, UFC 308 main event fighter Max Holloway believes that Pereira has already secured the title of the best fighter of 2024.\nMax Holloway Claims Alex Pereira is a Lock for the 2024 Fighter of the Year Award\nAhead of his upcoming fight against Ilia Topuria for the featherweight title at UFC 308, Max Holloway, the current BMF champion discussed Alex Pereira’s impressive run in the UFC. In a recent interview with Kevin Iole on YouTube, Holloway labeled Pereira as the Fighter of the Year, recognizing their outstanding performances in 2024. He openly shared his insights on the light heavyweight champion, saying:\n“I mean I don’t know, man. I don’t know that I would do that. The way Alex took fights. I mean the fastest guy to defend his title, right, with three title defenses. That’s a hard man to beat. I mean every time I’m in the talks for it, somebody’s having a crazy a** year. I think Alex Pereira has got that win in the bag already.”\nClick on ‘Follow Us’ and get notified of the most viral MMA stories via Google!

However, a potential matchup between Pereira and Ankalaev hinges on the Russian defeating Rakić at UFC 308. If that happens, the future clash promises to be thrilling, and fans are likely eager for the fight.\nAlso Read: Khalil Rountree Chases 2025 Q1 Comeback Against Former Light Heavyweight Champion After UFC 307",

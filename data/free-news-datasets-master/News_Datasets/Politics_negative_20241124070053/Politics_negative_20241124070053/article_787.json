    "text": "NAIROBI/ACCRA: Militants fighting in Burkina Faso are discreetly using Ghanaâ€™s north as a logistical and medical rear base to sustain their insurgency, seven sources told Reuters, a move that could help them expand their footprint in West Africa.\nThe sources, who include Ghanaian security officials and regional diplomats, said Ghanaian authorities appeared to be mostly turning a blind eye to the insurgents crossing over from neighboring Burkina Faso to stock up on food, fuel and even explosives, as well as getting injured fighters treated in hospital.\nBut they said that approach, while so far sparing Ghana from the kind of deadly attacks that have plagued its neighbors, risks allowing militants to put down roots in the country and recruit in some marginalized local communities.\nGhana shares a 600 km (372 mile) border with Burkina Faso, the country at the heart of an insurgency that has killed thousands, displaced millions and, according to some experts, turned the Sahel region into the epicenter of global terrorism as factions loyal to Al-Qaeda and Daesh expand their presence.\nBurkina Faso has lost control of over half its territory as a pro-Al-Qaeda group known as JNIM gained ground. A JNIM leader this week told French broadcaster RFI that it was aiming to push into Ghana, Togo and Benin.\nUnlike Benin and Togo, Ghana has not suffered a major attack.",

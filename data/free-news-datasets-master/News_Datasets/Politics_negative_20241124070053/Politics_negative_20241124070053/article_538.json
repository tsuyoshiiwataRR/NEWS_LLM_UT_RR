    "text": "Sir Alex Ferguson: Paul Scholes says it was 'distasteful' and 'disrespectful' to end legend's ambassador role Published 24/10/2024 at 20:01 GMT Paul Scholes has called the decision of INEOS and Manchester United to cut Sir Alex Ferguson's ambassadorial contract as \"distasteful\" and \"a little bit disrespectful.\" The United legend, who won 38 trophies in a 26-year reign as manager, saw his role as ambassador terminated by INEOS as part of a cost-cutting procedure that has seen hundreds of club staff lose their jobs. Paul Scholes has reacted to INEOS' decision to terminate an ambassadorial contract with Sir Alex Ferguson, calling the move \"distasteful\". Ferguson is Manchester United's most successful manager, winning 38 trophies over 26 years, and was appointed as an ambassador following his retirement in 2013. Company accounts in 2014 show that the Scotsman's role earned him a salary of £2.16 million, and that agreement lasted for over a decade. But his role has been terminated as part of cost-cutting measures at Old Trafford. \"I felt it was a little bit distasteful for what that man has done for the club, almost a little bit disrespectful,\" Scholes said on TNT Sports. \"But they're new owners and new owners make changes, and they think what they're doing is best for the club. \"Now if they think they can save whatever money it is, I know it's been said about £2m, I don't know if that's correct, but if they think they can use that elsewhere then so be it. \"But this club owes a lot to Sir Alex Ferguson, it's where it is now mainly because of the success he had for so many years. \"And probably the timing of it was a little bit poor as well, because they're in a really bad run of form. Could you have waited or done it before the season started, done it at the end of the season? \"The publicity wasn't great around it, but Sir Alex will be fine, he'll go on, he'll still be the best ambassador this club could ever have.\" It is understood that Ferguson and the club reached an amicable agreement to cease his duties at the end of the current season, and that he will continue to remain as a non-executive director on the club's board. The decision marks a major step forward in Jim Ratcliffe's cost-cutting drive at United after 250 staff members were removed from the [club's payroll in the summer.](https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/05/sir-jim-ratcliffe-cuts-250-jobs-to-save-manchester-united-about-10m-a-year)TNT Sports will show over 500 matches from the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Conference League across the 2024-25 season.

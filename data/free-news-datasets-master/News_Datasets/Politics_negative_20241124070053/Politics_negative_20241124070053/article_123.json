    "text": "Clarksburg resident Jaiden Ochieng was first identified and charged following a shooting that was reported in March in the 19300 block of Archdale Road in Germantown. According to a spokesperson from the Montgomery County Police Department, at around 3 p.m. on Wednesday, March 13, Ochieng arrived at a bus stop in a stolen Hyundai, and when his would-be 15-year-old victim got off the bus, he got out of the vehicle and chased after the teen. During the pursuit, Ochieng pulled out a handgun and began shooting at the teen, who was uninjured. Ochieng then fled the scene. Investigators say they recovered two casings at the scene, and it was ultimately determined that Ochieng was the suspect involved in the incident, and a warrant was issued for his arrest, charging him with first-degree murder and other offenses. Last month, officers located Ochieng in the 13300 block of Copper Ridge Road in Germantown, and he was found be in possession of a loaded handgun that was reported stolen out of Clinton. Ochieng was initially charged as an adult with: - Attempted first-degree attempted murder; - First-degree assault; - Use of a firearm in the commission of a violent felony; - Possession of a firearm on school property; - Possession of a loaded handgun; - Underage possession of a firearm; - Related theft offenses. On Thursday, Oct. 24, authorities announced that the teen, still in custody, has been linked to a shooting in August on Crystal Rock Drive in Germantown. In the second incident, police say that on Thursday, Aug. 8, officers were called to the 19600 block of Crystal Rock Drive to investigate a shooting when Ochieng allegedly got out of a vehicle and fired shots at his victim, who was sitting on a park bench. In that case, the victim was able to run away and was uninjured. During the investigation into that shooting, it was determined a Honda used by Ochieng was stolen out of Clarksburg, and his weapon was reported stolen out of Prince George's County. Ochieng now faces additional charges, including attempted first-degree murder, motor vehicle theft, and multiple firearms-related offenses. He is being charged as an adult in both the March and August incidents and is currently being held without bond at the Montgomery County Central Processing Unit.

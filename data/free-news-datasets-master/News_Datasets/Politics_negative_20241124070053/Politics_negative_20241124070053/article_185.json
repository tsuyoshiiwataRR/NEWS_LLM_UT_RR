    "text": "Authored by Paul Joseph Watson via Modernity.news,\nDonald Trump claimed that Kamala Harris is taking days off and not properly campaigning because she knows something about the election that the American public doesn’t.\nTrump made the cryptic comments during his campaign rally in Georgia.\n“This is a woman who took yesterday off, how do you take yesterday off?” asked Trump.\n“You’ve got 13 days, you’re running for the presidency, she takes time off,” he added.\n“I’ve got 52 days in a row and I’m not taking any days off, that I can tell you,” said Trump.\n“I hear she’s taking another one tomorrow or something – it’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen – maybe she knows something that we don’t know, that’s bad, right? Maybe she knows something we don’t know – does everybody understand that, maybe, maybe,” he concluded.\nRespondents on X speculated that Trump was referring to Democrats cheating to win the election or the election not happening at all.\nHarris had no speeches or public appearances scheduled for Tuesday, with her campaign only noting that she would take part in a recorded interview with NBC’s Hallie Jackson and another with Telemundo.\nHer only major event yesterday was a town hall show with CNN that didn’t go too well as even Anderson Cooper made her look silly.\nAs we highlighted earlier, both former Congressman George Santos and journalist Eric Daugherty suggested that a story would come out today that will end Kamala’s campaign.\nSome have expressed doubt given that previous supposedly scandalous stories about Harris and Tim Walz have fizzled into nothingburgers.\nIt is my sincere desire to provide readers of this site with the best unbiased information available, and a forum where it can be discussed openly, as our Founders intended. But it is not easy nor inexpensive to do so, especially when those who wish to prevent us from making the truth known, attack us without mercy on all fronts on a daily basis. So each time you visit the site, I would ask that you consider the value that you receive and have received from The Burning Platform and the community of which you are a vital part. I can't do it all alone, and I need your help and support to keep it alive. Please consider contributing an amount commensurate to the value that you receive from this site and community, or even by becoming a sustaining supporter through periodic contributions.

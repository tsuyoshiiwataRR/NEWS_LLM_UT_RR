    "text": "An [Arizona](https://www.latintimes.com/ahead-elections-harris-makes-last-push-court-key-group-arizona-mccain-republicans-562695) [man](https://www.latintimes.com/texas-man-accused-killing-coworker-over-unauthorized-lunch-breaks-everyone-must-think-im-563091) allegedly started a [mailbox ](https://www.latintimes.com/ring-cam-appears-catch-republican-candidate-stealing-rivals-flyer-voters-mailbox-replacing-it-563450)fire not to sway votes in the swing state but because he \"wanted to be arrested.\" Firefighters responded to a report of a burning collection box outside a USPS post office in Phoenix around 1:30 a.m. on Thursday, Arizona's Family reported. They forced the mailbox open and extinguished the flames, but, in doing so, destroyed a collection of unsent mail, including about 20 electoral ballots. Dieter Bradford Klofkorn, 35, was arrested for an outstanding unrelated warrant sometime Thursday morning and admitted to the arson while in police custody. He told deputies he did it because he \"wanted to be arrested\" and his actions \"were not politically motivated,\" [according to Arizona's Family](https://www.azfamily.com/2024/10/24/usps-blue-collection-box-damaged-by-fire-overnight-phoenix/). He was booked on one count of arson of property. Meanwhile, Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer encouraged any voter who placed their ballot in the collection box within the last 36 hours to check its status on BeBallotReady.Vote and watch for a status change over the next 72 hours. The last day to request a new ballot is Oct. 25. © 2024 Latin Times. All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.",

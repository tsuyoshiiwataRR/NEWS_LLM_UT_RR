    "text": "The place of independent research leadership within an EU competitiveness fund is far from assured\nIf anyone in EU policymaking circles is still in the dark over the EU’s ailing research competitiveness, they really have no excuse to be.\nThis month, an expert group led by Portugal’s former research minister, Manuel Heitor, warned that the EU needs to “wake up” to its declining position globally on research and innovation. The group’s report, on the future of the EU’s R&I framework programme, follows similarly heavyweight warnings in the reviews of the EU’s competitiveness and its single market led by former Italy prime ministers Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta respectively.\nIn a set of recommendations to the Commission generally welcomed by the sector, Heitor’s and his co-authors have called for the next R&I framework programme to have its budget more than doubled to at least €220 billion, the biggest increase suggested so far. The recommendations aim to help address a falling behind in the EU’s research competitiveness that has seen its share of the top 1 per cent of most-cited scientific publications globally drop from 20.7 per cent in 2000 to 17.8 per cent in 2020.\nHeitor told Research Professional News that he does not see his group’s advice as at odds with rumours swirling in Brussels that the Commission intends to wrap the next Framework Programme into a wider European Competitiveness Fund, essentially arguing that however the R&I programme is packaged, the recommendations still hold. But while that might be true of the headline budget and pushes to do away with underperforming elements, for example, there appears to be significant room for conflict with some of the report’s other attention-grabbing ideas.\nChief among these is the recommendation to create two further expert councils, along the model of the European Research Council, to steer funding for research related to industrial competitiveness and societal challenges.\nOne of Heitor’s co-authors, Mark Ferguson, told RPN that the report deliberately held back from the question of whether these councils would directly award grants. But either way, they would be expected to ensure funding is “flexible” and “imaginative”.\nSitting behind the proposal is the view that independence from political intervention enables the ERC’s governing board and that of the European Innovation Council to “bring excellence”, in Heitor’s words.\nFerguson, like Heitor, believes sitting the R&I programme within a competitiveness fund, alongside programmes on defence, digitisation, health and space, need not be problematic—as long as the recommendations of the review are heeded. But the ERC’s head, Maria Leptin, has already expressed her fears that subsuming the R&I programme within a broader fund would lead to a one-size-fits-all approach to rules around participation. This, she has said, would “kill” the ERC.\nA ringing endorsement of the ERC has sounded loud and clear in all the recent pitches for changes to the way EU-level R&I is funded. Its success was also recognised by Commission president Ursula von der Leyen in her ‘mission letters’ to proposed new commissioners—despite these letters also offering the first clear sign that a broader competitiveness fund could be on the cards.\nWhile designing autonomy for individual councils within a bigger programme would be possible, the approach has struck many as at odds with the creation of a fund aiming to bring greater coordination to R&I efforts in the name of improving the EU’s performance.\nWith the role and purpose of R&I increasingly in the political spotlight, the sector is rightly calling for clarity on the Framework Programme’s future in light of the EU’s wider competitiveness push. Despite Heitor’s sanguinity, his group’s recommendations add urgency to that call.",

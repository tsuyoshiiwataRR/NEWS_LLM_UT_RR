    "text": "Republicans have said a lot of weird , wildly disturbing things in their time, but perhaps nothing has come close to the creepiness that was on display on Wednesday night, when former Fox News host Tucker Carlson told a crowd of Donald Trump supporters that the ex-president needs to give America—which he likened to a “hormone-addled 15-year-old” girl—a “vigorous spanking.”\nYes, at a campaign event in Georgia, Carlson opined that Americans under Democratic leadership have been allowed to act like a toddler “smear[ing] the contents of his diaper on the wall of your living room” or a “hormone-addled 15-year-old daughter” slamming the door of her bedroom and giving her parents the finger. Then, he said , “There has to be a point at which Dad comes home,” and if you’ve recently consumed lunch, consider pausing for an hour or two before hearing what Carlson had to say next, or at least have a barf bag at the ready.\n“When Dad gets home, you know what he says?” Carlson asked the crowd. “‘You’ve been a bad girl, you’ve been a bad little girl, and you’re getting a vigorous spanking right now.’” A huge grin on his face, he continued, “‘And no, it’s not going to hurt me more than it hurts you. No, it’s not. I’m not going to lie. This is going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me. And you earned this. You’re getting a vigorous spanking because you’ve been a bad girl.’”\nX content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\nBecause this was a Trump rally, instead of responding with stunned looks of “WTF did he just say?,” the crowd broke into rapturous applause at the idea of Trump meting out corporal punishment on a 15-year-old, and calling her a “bad girl” in the process. Later—and again, grab that barf bag—the ex-president’s supporters addressed him as “Daddy.”\nX content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\nIncredibly, Carlson’s extended metaphor wasn’t the only time he had something weird to say about young women last night. Referring to Liz Cheney, Carlson called the 58-year-old former GOP representative, “ Dick Cheney ’s creepy little daughter.”\nIf you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, click here to subscribe.\nDefinitely seems like someone who should have access to the nuclear codes\nX content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\nSeems like a pretty clear choice!\nX content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\nElsewhere!\nSweeping Raids, Giant Camps, and Mass Deportations: Inside Trump’s 2025 Immigration Plans\nNYT • Read More\nTrump says he’d “fire” special counsel Jack Smith in “two seconds” if elected again\nThe Washington Post • Read More\nAll the Top Trump Officials Warning Against Voting for Him\nNew York • Read More\nWhat Is Usha Vance Thinking?\nNew York • Read More\nGOP candidates embrace Trump’s call to abolish Education Department\nThe Washington Post • Read More\nBeyoncé Will Appear With Kamala Harris at Houston Rally\nNYT • Read More\nKamala Harris Asks Americans: Are You Really Going to Elect a Guy Who Has Good Things to Say About Hitler?\nVanity Fair • Read More\nNo One Knows How Big Pumpkins Can Get\nThe Atlantic • Read More\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair Monica Lewinsky on 25 Ways to Calm the F–k Down Before the Election\nThe Second Coming of Guru Jagat\nWhy Isn’t Melania’s No. 1 Bestseller Flying Off Bookstore Shelves?\nKamala Harris Isn’t Repeating the Mistakes of 2016\nStanley Tucci : “After The Devil Wears Prada, I Couldn’t Get a Job”\nHow Barron Trump’s Best Friend Is Shaping the 2024 Podcast Offensive\nJohn Williams’s Dark Days Before Jaws and Star Wars\nHere’s What a Taylor Swift Thank-You Note Looks Like\nSign Up for Cocktail Hour , VF ’s Essential Daily Brief\nThe post “You’ve Been a Bad Little Girl”: Tucker Carlson Gave the Most WTF Speech of All Time at a Campaign Event for Trump appeared first on Vanity Fair .",

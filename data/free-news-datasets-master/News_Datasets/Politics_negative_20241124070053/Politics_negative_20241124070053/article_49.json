    "text": "Batman has spoken! Michael Keaton is no stranger to speaking his mind, something he usually does in a stern, yet intelligent, way. With the Presidential election almost upon us, Keaton has a message to male voters about Republican nominee Donald Trump and Elon Musk, an unlikely pair united in their goal to put the convicted former president in the White House again. Despite some males seemingly believing that the duo respects them, their well-being, and their opinions, Keaton wants to make it clear that this is not the case. Keaton took to his Instagram page to post a video where he declared that both Trump and Musk \"don't really respect you,\" speaking specifically to male voters who are still considering voting for Trump. The actor was pretty pointed in his comments but spoke some serious truths about the pair if you fall on Keaton's side. The actor continued: \"Some of you folks, guys mostly, who are thinking about attending a rally with Musk and Trump — they don’t really respect you. They laugh at you behind your back. They think you’re stupid. They don’t want to hang out with you. They have nothing in common with you. They’re not your bros.” Keaton is speaking on how Trump particularly wants to sell that he's for the people and will be in support of all Americans should he be elected president again. The actor has thrown his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris for her Presidential bid, even campaigning for Harris in his native Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which will be a key swing state in determining the election. It's clear that Keaton believes Trump and his supporters will say whatever they need to say to get elected but, in the long run, they couldn't care less about the little man and only care about themselves. The Batman actor also believes Trump is aware of his pull with his supporters, pointing to the former President saying he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and his supporters would still vote for him. Keaton elaborated on that by saying, \"Basically, what he’s saying in parentheses is people are so stupid. They’re so dumb, they’d still vote for me. They have no respect for you, trust me.\" Michael Keaton Isn't the Only Actor to Call Out Donald Trump Keaton isn't the only person who has called out Trump and the male voters who believe he's a \"bro\" or some alpha male. Dave Bautista recently appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in a taped segment that called out this very notion , insinuating that Trump isn't a man at all and that his male supporters need to be aware of that. Bautista is an actor that has also put his support behind Harris and hasn't been shy about letting that be known. [Related ](/donald-trump-bashes-the-apprentice/) [ Donald Trump Finally Breaks His Silence About The Apprentice ](/donald-trump-bashes-the-apprentice/) The convicted former President unsurprisingly bashes the controversial biopic. Sebastian Stan, who plays Trump in the latest film The Apprentice, has called out the former President for different reasons, particularly his hypocrisy . Stan was asked if the film would serve a purpose in swaying voters away from Trump, and he asked voters to \"dig deeper\" before they think about whomever they may vote for. The actor said, \"I don't know. But what I do hope is that people regardless of their opinion, are curious enough to try to dig deeper. Because I think we're living in a world where it's so easy to be handed an opinion everywhere you turn.\" He then went on to voice his opinion on Trump trying to censor his movie. \"He's been trying to censor this movie, and at the same time, he claims that he acknowledges free speech...I can't think of anything more hypocritical. So at the end of the day, it's about him as a character. Forget the politics and just go in there and use your instinct and ask yourself: Do you trust this man?\"",

    "text": "The war of words between the Cleveland Browns and the city of Cleveland over the team's recently announced plans for a new stadium continue to play out publicly. Earlier this week, the city invoked the infamous Art Modell Law in an attempt to keep team owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam from moving the team from their current stadium in downtown Cleveland in favor of a new state-of-the-art facility in Brook Park, Ohio. The political move will see the issue play out in the court room, as the city attempts one final Hail Mary to keep the team in their current stadium, Huntington Bank Field along the lakefront. In response to the city, the Haslam Sports Group, Chief Operating Office Dave Jenkins fired back at the city's latest round of political theatrics. Throughout our future stadium planning process, we have always acted transparently and in good faith with the City of Cleveland and are disappointed in the City’s latest course of action stating its intent to bring litigation regarding the \"Modell Law”. These statements and similar actions create uncertainty and do not serve the interests of Greater Cleveland. Therefore, today we have filed a lawsuit seeking clarity on this vague and unclear law. Today’s action for declaratory judgment was filed to take this matter out of the political domain and ensure we can move this transformative project forward to make a new domed Huntington Bank Field in Brook Park a reality. We have no interest in any contentious legal battle but are determined to create a project that will add to Greater Cleveland by building a dome stadium and adjacent mix-used development, a $3-3.5B project, that will include approximately $2B in private investment. This project will bring premier events and economic activity that will generate significant revenue for the City, County and State. As this is now an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comments. We look forward to a positive resolution.",

    "text": "Another elected representative has quit the Pirates, the latest in a series of resignations from the party, which is at the centre of an investigation by the EU’s public prosecutor into allegations of fraud.\nTammy Broers, a councillor in Esch-sur-Alzette, has become the latest figure to resign, the Pirates’ co-ordinator Marc Goergen wrote in a post on social media site X on Wednesday evening.\n“Tammy Broers (Esch) informed us this evening that she is leaving the Pirate Party,” wrote Goergen, who is one of just two Pirate Party MPs.\nBroers intends to join the Greens, as does the president of the Pirates’ branch in Esch-sur-Alzette, Patrick Steffen, RTL reported. Around a quarter of the 19 councillors elected for the Pirates in last June’s local elections have since quit the party.\nThere was a lot of “bullying and bashing each other” within the Pirates, Broers told RTL on Thursday, adding: “There was no longer any cohesion. It was unbearable.”\nLuxembourg City councillor Marie-Marthe Muller, who only took up her post in June this year, and member of parliament Ben Polidori are among those who have defected to the LSAP. The Pirates accused the socialist party of the “theft” of its elected representatives in a statement issued at the end of September.\nSeveral elected representatives have quit the Pirates in recent months, following the publication in June of a Luxembourg Times and Luxemburger Wort investigation which revealed that the national refugee office (ONA) is trying to reclaim over €92,000 from the Pirates for work on a translation app called Malt.\nThe European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) said earlier this week that it has taken over an investigation into the contract from the Luxembourg prosecutor.\nFollowing the initial revelations in June, Marc Goergen publicly distanced himself from Clement and accused him of bullying party colleagues and bringing the party’s reputation into disrepute over his commercial interests that were at the heart of the Malt contract.\nClement responded by claiming that Goergen had used almost €30,000 in parliamentary funds to pay for private expenses.\nThe two MPs have since said that they will continue to work independently of each other in parliament.",

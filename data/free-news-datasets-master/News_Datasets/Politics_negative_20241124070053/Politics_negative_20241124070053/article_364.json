    "text": "The president of Colombia, Gustavo Petro , criticized on Tuesday, without mentioning him, his Argentine counterpart, Javier Milei , and his motto “Long live freedom, to hell”, when he spoke before the UN General Assembly about the subjugation of politics in power the richest.\n«Politicians, including the presidents of the most powerful countries on earth, simply obey them. “They pay for the electoral campaigns, they are the owners of the media, they are the ones who hide the truth of science, like in the film ‘Don’t look up'”, he said referring to political power, the richest. % of the world.\nPetro, who has had several disagreements with Milei, said the rich are “the ones who say what you think, what you say and what should be prohibited and silenced.”\n«In their force of prohibition and censorship they shout ‘Long live freedom, to hell’, but it is only the freedom of the richest 1% of the world’s population which in its mercantile and free-market sentiment leads us to the destruction of the atmosphere and life» , he stated.\nEnd of humanity In his third speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Petro predicted today that “the end” of humanity has begun due to the “genocide” in Gaza , wars and climate change that has caused the destruction of 11 million of hectares of jungle. Amazon burned in just one month due to global warming.\nHe denounced that powerful countries, which have the “power to destroy the life of humanity” and at the same time to stop the bombing of Gaza, do not listen to the majority of other heads of state who demand that the “genocide” stop.\n«They don’t listen to us when we vote to stop the genocide in Gaza, even though we are the majority of the world’s presidents and representatives of the majority of humanity; “A minority of presidents who can stop the bombing do not listen to us, that is, the presidents of countries that can destroy humanity do not listen to us,” lamented Colombia’s first left-wing president.\n«In this room, a president’s ability to communicate depends on the amount of dollars he has in his budget, the number of warplanes he owns and, ultimately, his country’s ability to destroy humanity on the ground» , he added.\nThe bells of the planet Likewise, the climate crisis is leading to the end of humanity, according to Petro, because “scientists have said that if the Amazon forest burned we would reach the climate tipping point, where human decisions to stop the collapse will have already been made ”. harmless”, and “the Amazon forest is burning”, he recalled, alluding to the hundreds of fires that have occurred in recent weeks in South America.\n«The bells are already ringing all over the planet for you, for us, for life and for humanity, as Ernest Hemingway said. The bell rings not only for you, but for all of your life. The end has begun,” the president predicted.\nThe president also referred to social inequality, recalling that Oxfam indicated this week that the richest 1% of humanity owns more wealth than 95% of all humanity combined.\n“It is in this achieved inequality, the greatest in our history as a species, that we find the logic of the massive destruction unleashed in the climate crisis and the logic of the bombs that a criminal like (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu drops on Gaza. Netanyahu is a hero for the richest 1% of humanity because he is able to demonstrate that people are destroyed under bombs,” the Colombian president said.\n«The maximization of death» As in previous years, Petro attacked the free market, underlining this time that it is “the maximization of death” and underlining that the richest 1% is the one who allows “bombs to be dropped on women, the elderly and children of families.” Gaza.” , or Sudan, or rebel countries that do not fall under their dominion are economically blocked.\n«I can only tell the weak-voiced people of the world about a country without weapons of mass destruction, but beautiful for its natural and cultural diversity, the country of beauty and butterflies of all colors, which is no longer “It is not It is the time of governments, but it is the time of peoples”, stated Petro, who invited us to raise “the flag of life, otherwise our cities will be filled with cemeteries, as the epidemic has shown us”.\nAnd he addressed the main world leaders directly: “I no longer speak with Biden, nor with Macron, nor with Scholz, nor with Xi Jin Ping, nor with Putin. (…) It is up to humanity to fight, it is the people’s time. If governments were unable and decided to play with bombs and senseless wars, with harmless power games, then it is time to put the solution to humanity’s great problems in the hands of the people themselves.\n*With information from EFE*\n#Petro #criticized #Javier #Milei #spoke #humanity",

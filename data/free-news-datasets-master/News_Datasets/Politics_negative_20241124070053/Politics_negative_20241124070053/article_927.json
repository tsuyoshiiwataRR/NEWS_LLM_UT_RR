    "text": "Makemstine Roger said: â†‘ Samurai sword attacker found NOT GUILTY by multicultural London jury\nA 'Black Lives Matter' extremist who attacked Britain First activists with a samurai sword has been found 'Not Guilty' by a multicultural jury in London.\nDespite the entire incident being captured on nearby CCTV and an iPhone, a biased and politically motivated jury found the attacker not guilty.\nIt was admitted, and proven , in court that the attacker in question pushed and punched Paul Golding, chased our activists with a brick, threatened them with a shovel, then brandished a samurai sword while threatening to chop their heads off.\nThe attacker even acted aggressive in court, arguing with the prosecutor and being reprimanded by the judge.\nThe British legal system has now collapsed due to race-based left-wing politics.\nWe are living in a new 'Dark Age' of two-tier justice based on politics and race.\nYou can attack people with weapons , it seems, as long as you are black (or Muslim).\nWatch Paul Golding's shocking video explaining the situation:\nplease log in to view this image Click to expand... Where are you getting this from Roger, because the first line is completely untrue.\nHe was at Medway Magistrates today, because the defendent is from Dartford, Kent - the case has been referred to Woolwich Crown Court, which would make sense, his next appearance is on the 9th Nov for a preliminary hearing.",

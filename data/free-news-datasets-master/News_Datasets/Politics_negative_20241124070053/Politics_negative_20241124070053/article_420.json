    "text": "[Opinion](https://www.conservativedailynews.com/category/opinion-of-the-editor/) [Trending Commentary](https://www.conservativedailynews.com/category/trending-topics/featured-opinion/) The Latest Democrat-Media “Trump is Hitler” Election Year Hoax According to several news outlets in early 2018, Kelly’s influence in the [Trump] White House had been diminished and Trump made several key decisions without his presence. On December 7, 2018, [CNN]and others reported that Kelly and Trump were no longer on speaking terms and that Kelly was expected to resign in the coming days. On December 8, Trump announced that Kelly would be leaving at the end of the year.[Wikipedia], White House Chief of Staff” [John Kelly] Senator Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) [and] Representative Jayapal (D.C. 7th District) Investigate Former White House Chief of Staff General John Kelly’s “Cynical” and “Unethical” Decision to Join the Board of Directors of Federal Contractor Running Nation’s Largest Detention Center for Migrant Children [because] “General Kelly … was at the center of the inhumane and poorly planned immigration policies that put children in cages while separating thousands of families and that benefitted [his] company. … In fact, those policies helped a subsidiary of [the] company [that] operates the ‘nation’s largest facility for unaccompanied migrant children,’ rake in hundreds of millions of dollars in government contracts.” Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren,[Warren.Senate.gov], Jun. 6, 2019 Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (Democrat, Florida 26th District), who represents the district containing the [Detention Center for Migrant Children], tweeted, “It [is unforgivable” [that people like] Kelly … are willing to profit off the cruel detaining of immigrant children,” [Slate], May 4, 2016 Sen. Cory Booker (Democrat – NJ): “[General Kelly] Profiting from [his] own cruel policies … is disgusting.” [FoxReno], May 14, 2019 Since the 2024 presidential election is just weeks away and since the previous “Trump is Hitler” comedies don’t appear to have worked (Trump is [leading](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/donald-trump-leading-in-majority-of-swing-states-new-poll-shows/ar-AA1sHzsF) in the polls and [betting markets](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/17/trumps-polymarket-odds-top-60-how-election-betting-markets-differ-from-polls/)), the Democrat “News”-media Colluders (or DNC) have come up with another “Trump is Hitler” skit just in time. According to the latest routine, Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic reports that General John Kelly stated that in a private conversation Trump stated that “I need the kind of generals that Hitler had … People who [are] totally loyal …, that follow orders” and suggested that this means that Trump is increasingly attracted to fascism. Since the DNC have again managed to put the words “Trump” and “Hitler” together in the same sentence this sent what remains of our “news” media into a frenzy. One hasn’t seen this much [heavy breathing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1ab6uxg908) in the DNC since the heyday of the Trump-Russia Collusion hoax. CNN, which, for years, ran the Trump-Russia Collusion hoax that did so much damage to our country, reports that General Kelly “entered the 2024 fray in stunning fashion, saying the former president fits ‘into the general definition of fascist’ and wanted the ‘kind of generals Hitler had.” Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’ choice for Vice President, who has [praised Chinese communism](https://www.johnlocke.org/walz-praised-chinese-communism/), stated, in a fit of [alleged moral outrage](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/23/politics/trump-hitler-democratic-warnings-analysis/index.html) that As a 24-year veteran of our military, that makes me sick as hell — and it should make you sick. … Folks, the guardrails are gone. Trump is descending into this madness — a former president of the United States and the candidate for president of the United States says he wants generals like Adolf Hitler had, … Needless to say, Walz, the Democrats and their media propagandists are taking these reports about Trump as fact, [just like they took](https://www.conservativedailynews.com/2024/09/russia-collusion-hoax-and-rigged-abc-news-debate-are-connected/) the Trump-Russia Collusion Hoax, the “[Trump tear gassed protestors](https://www.thepostil.com/the-news-medias-war-on-donald-trump-a-retrospective/) in Lafayette Park for a Bible photo-op” hoax, the “Trump admitted grabbing women by their pussies” hoax, the “Trump called the Corona virus a hoax” hoax, the “Trump told people to ingest bleach to kill the Coronavirus” hoax, the “Trump has never [condemned White Supremacists](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-very-fine-people/)” hoax, the “Trump led [an insurrection](https://www.conservativedailynews.com/2024/06/goodbye-to-the-democrat-media-fake-trump-insurrection-narrative/) on Jan. 6, 2020” hoax, etc., as verified fact. However, Trump campaign adviser [Alex Pfeiffer](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4948174-john-kelly-donald-trump-praised-hitler-generals-loyalty/) has stated that: This is absolutely false. President Trump never said this. President [Trump ](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump/)has spent his life caring for America’s military heroes. As President, he kept our troops out of harm’s way, secured the largest pay raise for our troops in a decade, and signed historic VA reforms. As a private citizen, he has financially supported veterans and forcefully advocated for the Kabul Gold Star families. There has been no greater advocate for our brave military men and women than Donald Trump. It is worth noting that, despite all the never-ending attempts by the DNC to disparage Trump’s bond with the military, [Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/30/military-veterans-remain-a-republican-group-backing-trump-over-harris-by-wide-margin/), not exactly a MAGA organization, reports that the polls indicate that, military veterans support Trump over Biden or Harris “by a wide margin.” Since Trump’s alleged remarks about Hitler’s generals took place in a private conversation, it is impossible to verify determinately if he ever said them and, if so, what he meant by them. It is, therefore, worth pointing out that even if Trump said something very like what Kelly reported, praising Hitler’s generals, this by no means implies any support for NAZISM or fascism. If someone said that he needed chefs like Hitler’s chefs, that would not mean he accepted NAZISM or fascism. It would mean wants good cooks. Second, most politicians require loyalty from their staff. In 2020, [Politico](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/transition-playbook/2020/11/20/biden-rewards-loyalty-791808) reported that “Biden rewards loyalty,” specifically, that “The hires [by the Biden-administration] are part of a larger dynamic in Biden-world: he values loyalty.” However, a president wanting loyalty was not a sin back then, primarily because of that big “D” behind Biden’s name. Further, a modicum of commonsense dictates that a president could not operate an effective administration unless he/she could count on loyalty from their staff. Loyalty only becomes a problem when a president demands loyalty to the exclusion of all else, for example, the country or the constitution. However, in the remarks cited by Kelly, Trump did not say that he demands loyalty to the exclusion of all else. Finally, when someone criticizes Trump, it never seems to occur to the DNC that these Trump critics might have agendas or prejudices of their own. For example, just as the DNC never liked or trusted John Kelly, they never, putting it mildly, liked or trusted Liz Cheney, seeing her as a [war criminal](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3147267/war-criminals-for-harris/) and [warmonger](https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-liz-cheney-backfire-1972851), until, of course, she criticized Trump. However, as soon as she came out against Trump, she became a saviour of democracy and all was forgiven. Accordingly, Kelly, just like Trump-critic Liz Cheney, was, in an all-too familiar expedited process not requiring the usual [2 verified miracles](https://aleteia.org/2019/08/09/how-many-miracles-does-it-take-to-be-canonized-a-saint), sainted immediately upon voicing his criticisms of Trump. It never seemed to occur to anybody in what’s left of the DNC that Kelly’s visions of Trump’s fascism might derive from the fact that Trump began disregarding Kelly’s opinions and eventually got rid of him altogether. In other words, if Trump got rid of someone of my genius, he must be a fascist. One does not dismiss people with these kind of egos without expecting a major reaction. In brief, should one be permitted to think about this latest smear, because that is what it is, one can see that this is, once again, much ado about nothing or, at least, about very little. The DNC would be better advised to think less about smearing people and rather more about trying [to listen](https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2024/10/western_governments_despise_their_own_citizens.html) to what [American citizens](https://www.amazon.sg/Democrat-Party-Hates-America/dp/150118315X) actually want.

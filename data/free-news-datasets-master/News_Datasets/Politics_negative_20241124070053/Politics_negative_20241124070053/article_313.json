It has made life much worse.”\nMr Richardson said that poor governance had “run this country into the ground”, but that good governance could “turn it back around again.\nHe added that the solution to creating a fairer Bermuda was to fix the basics of good government.\nHe said: “That means creating an environment where investors want to come here, and cutting taxes and red tape to help local businesses thrive; delivering a world-class education for our children; investing in our roads and infrastructure to bring Bermuda back to where it should be, and reducing our crippling national debt.\n“Most importantly and the most basic of all, is governing with integrity and accountability — and being accountable to the people who put you in government.\n“If Premier Burt wants a fairer Bermuda, he needs to stop wasting time complaining about the ‘combined opposition’ and start fixing the problems that his government created.”\nRelated Stories Premier warns of ‘new Combined Opposition’ Parliament to reconvene early next month Commissiong mulls standing as an independent",

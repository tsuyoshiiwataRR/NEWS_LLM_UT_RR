    "text": "Pilot Mountain Town Manager placed on administrative leave after ‘discrepancies’ discovered in town’s finances, mayor says\nThe town manager of Pilot Mountain, Michael Boaz, has been placed on administrative leave after questions arose concerning the town’s finances, according to Mayor Evan J. Cockerham.\nCockerham said that he, along with Mayor Pro-Tem Donna Kiger, “discovered discrepancies in the town’s finances.’ He said this led to the Board of Commissioner and Pilot Mountain’s legal teams directing him to place Boaz on administrative leave.\nTOP STORIES\n1 airlifted after Asheboro chase ends in crash; Firearms, fake cash found in car, officials sayNorth Carolina hit record-breaking early voting numbersMan found dead from gunshot wound to the head, High Point officials say\nGet the latest news stories of interest by clicking here\nThis will give the town the time to investigate “without interference.”\nIn the meantime, assistant Town Manager Holly Utt was appointed to acting town manager.\nAdam McHone, President of the Board of Directors of Pilot Mountain Rescue and EMS said, “Once it became clear that State grant funds, earmarked for improvement to the Rescue Squad building had been misused, Mayor Cockherham immediately took swift, decisive action.”\nYou can read both statements from Cockerham and McHone below.\nWatch: NOWCAST streaming newscasts\nCockerham's statement reads:\nLast year, standing in front of town hall, I promised accountability. That applies not just to our Police Department which has made great strides toward delivering a higher level of service to our community and building trust through Chief Tillotson’s leadership, but throughout all departments.\nOn Monday morning, after Mayor Pro-Tem Donna Kiger and I discovered discrepancies in the town’s finances, the Board of Commissioners, in conjunction with the town’s legal team, directed me to place Town Manager Michael Boaz on administrative leave. This leave gives the town an opportunity to investigate this matter without interference, in coordination with the Local Government Commission and any other authorities as maybe required. We will consider additional personnel action when appropriate.\nAssistant Town Manager, Holly Utt has been designated as acting town manager. Thank you for your trust. Our board of commissioners is committed to making sure that all aspects of our local government remain up to the standards that the citizens of this great town deserve.\nKeep up with the latest news and weather by downloading the WXII app here\nMcHone's statement reads:\nAs an emergency volunteer community agency profoundly impacted by this unfortunate situation, Pilot Mountain Rescue and EMS, Inc. is fully committed to supporting the ongoing investigation to ensure transparency and achieve a fair and timely resolution.\nI reported my concerns to Mayor Cockerham. Once it became clear that State grant funds earmarked for improvements to the Rescue Squad building had been misused, Mayor Cockerham immediately took swift, decisive action. He has been understanding, courageous and completely transparent. Mayor Cockerham and the Board of Commissioners, particularly commissioner Donna Kiger, have been very supportive of the Rescue Squad and other parties impacted by these events.\nAs a dedicated part of this community, we are hopeful that these joint efforts will clarify the circumstances. Despite being adversely affected, Pilot Mountain Rescue and EMS, Inc. remains steadfast in our mission and is optimistic that it will strengthen our relationship with the Town. I also want to assure our many friends and supporters that the financial discrepancies at Town Hall are no reflection of the books and records of the Rescue Squad. Our financial position remains verifiably strong, untainted by what was allegedly done by the Town Manager.\nNAVIGATE: Home | Weather | Watch NOWCAST TV | Local News | National | News We Love |\nTRENDING STORIES",

    "text": "Rick Morton ’s writing career has benefited from his wit and talent for prose, and the Walkley award-winning newshound doesn’t disappoint in his latest book about the public service scandal we all can’t get enough of: robodebt.\nBut much like any person obsessed with details, understanding how things work, why decisions are made, and the machinations of government power, exposure to enough weighty truth can also be taxing.\n“I’m glad it’s done, and I’ll be even happier when I no longer have to talk about it,” Morton told The Mandarin.\n“It’s been an incredibly painful process, partly because of my own Catholic guilt and reflecting on things that I wasn’t there [for] or missed [in reporting over the years], and also then just seeing the way other people respond to their own mistakes,” he said.\nAhead of a special event discussing his new book at the Canberra Writers Festival this weekend, Morton said the most frustrating thing about the illegal debt-collecting scheme which ran between July 2015 and November 2019 was that even today, almost a decade on, there was no happy conclusion.\nFollowing a Federal Court case, a royal commission , a referral to the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) that subsequently flatlined, an APSC-led workplace inquiry and sanctions for a small number of government actors, the robodebt story feels oddly incomplete.\n“The publisher was like, ‘We need a more uplifting final chapter’. I’m like, ‘I don’t have one.’,” Morton said.\n“It’s not because I’m overly cynical about everything — if anything, I can be a little bit too rose-coloured glasses about things — but writing and paying this much attention to this, particularly for the last two-and-a-half years, has just absolutely wrecked me,” he said.\nSome people involved in robodebt have been named and shamed , key Coalition ministers who orchestrated the policy conditions that allowed a social security system to be as weaponised against people have issued remorseful statements but deflected responsibility, and the APS commissioner, Gordon de Browuer, has now ruled at least 97 breaches of the code of conduct were committed by public servants.\nBut nobody has been sacked over their involvement in the process, and nobody charged by the police.\nAll we have is a terrible cautionary tale about all the ways the government’s duty to the public can fall off the wagon, symbolic apologies from ministers of the day, and an ongoing reticence to change royal commission recommendation 57 around secrecy provisions for cabinet documents.\n“The royal commission can make their findings, and you can see in the back of my book, there’s a whole bunch of responses from people who’ve had findings made against them, who just say: ‘Well, you shouldn’t take anything the royal commission did as true, because here’s why we don’t believe it,’” Morton said.\n“And they can point to other institutional failures, like the NACC and say: ‘See, they said there might be a risk of creating an unequal outcome so we should not believe what the royal commission says’.\n“It’s not enough to go backwards in time [to achieve justice or find accountability] anymore.”\nMorton reflected that robodebt’s ultimate consequences were unsatisfactory given the scale of the harm caused by the scheme and the way debt collectors and bureaucrats treated vulnerable people .\nSome of those who have been accused of wrongdoing in the robodebt scandal visibly bristle the moment it’s mentioned to them, which shows they know it is not something to be proud of being associated with.\nBut mostly, because ‘ministerial responsibility’ has lost all meaning over the years, the journalist said, he suspected there was a general view that people did not care enough about the injustice suffered by welfare recipients for a reputational mark against chief robodebt offenders to count for much.\n“The story is bleak and, because of that revisionist history [at play], it is so complex,” Morton said.\n“People who should have been self-reflecting by now are not, and can move the pieces [of the story] around in just the right way that it kind of looks reasonable and nice from the outside, and imply that maybe this was all a big hubbub about nothing — I just don’t think that’s fair.”\nThe injustice of subpar accountability was exacerbated by powerful actors who were deft hands in spin, public relations and expert in avoiding mud from sticking , Morton added.\n“There really is a mean streak in the psyche that runs through this country — some things are not worth defending according to the status quo,” he said.\nThroughout his book, Morton shows how victims who were capable of overcoming the cruelty of a system were either supported by a strong network of family and friends or prepared to go in and fight a process they knew was wrong all along.\nMost people complied and believed what the government was telling them was true — at serious personal, financial and psychological cost.\n“There are so many ways that people suffered in robodebt, and I wanted to get a little bit of a flavour of that,” Morton said.\n“There’s a family at the end of the book, just within days of the solicitor-general’s opinion coming in, whose daughter died of a heroin overdose. She had a debt and was trying to get into rehab, which was expensive. I wanted those moments to be peppered throughout the book.\n“But equally, if there’s any value I can bring to it, I think is in how the fuck it happened,” he said.\nThe nature of the way robodebts were raised, the issuing of letters of notice without a contact phone number on the header, online forms that did not allow people to contest automated debts and the flawed formula used to generate them, and the agency’s preparedness to litigate against challengers — all add up to paint a David vs Goliath picture with the odds stacked terribly in favour against David.\nWhat Morton said he worries about most were issues also underscored by the APSC taskforce . He simply does not know what is needed to guarantee reform of a bureaucratic culture allowing public servants to demonstrate lack of curiosity and shrink from mistakes or cover them up.\n“The active disappearing of evidence when the ombud came knocking was incredible. I’d never seen anything like it, particularly from people who, yes, had made mistakes, but they weren’t the ones who came up with robodebt,” he said.\n“I genuinely didn’t think it was possible. I thought rules were always bent and that things were distorted all the time. I’d never thought I would see an outright lie to an independent statutory authority.”\nBuilding a picture of how robodebt was allowed to stand up, and wrapping a narrative around it makes one keenly aware of the insidious public service cultural rot .\nIt also gives journalists like Morton a unique insight into how otherwise well-meaning public servants, who give an inch here or cut corners there, acting across the system can contribute to the ‘look away’ and ‘don’t probe too much’ environment robodebt thrived in.\n“There’s one very senior person who was involved in robodebt going ‘Oh yeah, I thought I did a good job until the royal commission, and then I realised maybe I could do some things better.’ That’s a nice thing to realise, because they weren’t a bad person,” Morton said.\n“But then they were like, ‘It’s really hard though, because what do they want us to do? Go into the secretary’s office and say we’ve got legal advice advising this scheme’s illegal?’ Yes — we do want you to do this. It is your job!”\nREAD MORE:\nRobodebt reverse charges: Dreyfus puts burden of proof back on APS",

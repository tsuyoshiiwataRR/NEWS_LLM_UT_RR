    "text": "It may have been the worst town hall for any candidate ever…\nVice President Kamala Harris held a town hall event in critical battleground Pennsylvania on Wednesday night — but Harris failed to deliver any substantive answers. Even the talking heads over at CNN said Kamala served up word salad and failed to define her policies.\n“What I’m hearing from people who I’ve been talking to … if her goal was to close the deal, they’re not sure she did that,” CNN anchor Dana Bash said immediately after the event outside Philadelphia.\n“Having said that, any time that she can be in front of an audience and interacting with voters is a win as far as her campaign goes — and they are very happy about that.”\n“The things that would concern me is when she doesn’t want to answer a question, her habit is to kind of go to Word Salad City,” said former Obama strategist and CNN contributor David Axelrod. “And she did that on a couple of answers.”\nAxelrod continued: “One was on Israel — Anderson [Cooper] asked a direct question, ‘Would you be stronger on Israel than Trump?’ And there was a seven-minute answer, but none of that related to the question he was asking.”\n“She would acknowledge no concerns about any of the administration’s policies. And that’s a mistake,” he said. “Sometimes you have to concede things, and she didn’t concede much.”\nWatch critical clips from CNN below:\nNEW: CNN’s Scott Jennings says Kamala Harris is a “double-threat” because she can’t think on her feet and can’t answer the expected questions.\nCNN has railed on Harris after her town hall event.\nHere are the top reactions:\n6.

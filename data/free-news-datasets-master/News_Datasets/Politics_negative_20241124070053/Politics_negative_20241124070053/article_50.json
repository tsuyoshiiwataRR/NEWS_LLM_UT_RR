    "text": "Dieter Klofkorn, 35, has been arrested for allegedly burning 20 electoral ballots inside a mailbox in Phoenix, Arizona on Thursday morning. A suspect is in custody for allegedly burning 20 electoral ballots that were inside a mailbox in Phoenix, Arizona, on Thursday morning, the city's mayor and police said. Dieter Klofkorn, 35, is accused of igniting a fire in a mailbox at a U.S. Postal Office in the area of 7th Avenue and Indian School Road around 1 a.m., Phoenix police said in a news release. The Phoenix Fire Departmentâ€™s Arson Investigation Taskforce was contacted and assumed the investigation, according to police. The scene was processed, including finding nearby surveillance footage. Phoenix Fire Capt. Rob McDade confirmed to NBC News and AZFamily that 20 electoral ballots were damaged, along with additional mail. Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego voiced her concern about this crime on X, saying: \"I am concerned about the recent incident at one of our post offices involving damage to several ballots.\" \"I am closely monitoring the situation and maintaining regular communication with the @AZSecretary , @RecordersOffice , and local and federal law enforcement,\" Gallego's post continued. \"There is zero tolerance for criminal activity in our community, and we are working collaboratively with every level of government to bring the perpetrator to justice.\" Klofkorn admitted to burning ballots, said actions were not politically motivated In a follow-up X post on Thursday , Gallego announced the arrest of a suspect. \"Thanks to swift action by @PhoenixPolice, @PHXFire and federal partners, we have arrested the suspect involved in this incident,\" the mayor's X post reads. Investigators identified Klofkorn after working on several leads, police said. He was eventually found and arrested for an outstanding and unrelated arrest warrant, according to the release. Police did not disclose what the arrest warrant was for. While in custody, Klofkorn admitted to committing the arson, police said. He went on to tell interviewing officers that he \"wanted to be arrested and that his actions were not politically motivated and not related to anything involving the upcoming election,\" according to the department. Klofkorn was subsequently booked into jail on one felony count of arson of property. It is unclear if Klofkorn has an attorney.",

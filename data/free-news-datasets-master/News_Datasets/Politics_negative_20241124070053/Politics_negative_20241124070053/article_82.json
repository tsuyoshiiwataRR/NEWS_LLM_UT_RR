The letter from U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and U.S. Representative Jamie Raskin cited an Oct. 4 Reuters report that revealed that Kushner on multiple occasions had discussed U.S.-Saudi diplomacy concerning Israel with Saudi Arabias de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, since leaving government. \"This revelation is deeply disturbing, as Mr. Kushner appears to be influencing U.S. foreign policy by acting as a political consultant to the Saudi government while also accepting their money,\" Wyden and Raskin wrote in the eight-page letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland. The letter has not been previously reported. \"Mr. Kushner's proximity to President Trump and the potential for political interference warrants the appointment of a Special Counsel,\" the letter added.

That's been in the news for months. Like this little gem from early April. To be fair though maybe his dog, if he has one or perhaps his neighbors dog chewed up the news paper Ninety-nine percent of funding at Kushners investment firm comes from foreign sources. https://newrepublic.com/post/180559/sketchy-way-jared-kushner-investors Jared Kushners investment firm, Affinity Partners, has invested nearly $1.2 billion since it was formed in 2021. Nearly all of that money has come from foreign sources, raising major ethical red flags. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 99 percent of Affinitys investor funds have come from foreign sources, The New York Times reported Tuesday. Affinity, which is worth $3 billion, has received investments from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as corporate moguls like Terry Gou, who founded electronics giant Foxconn. These are all countries that Kushner worked with when his father-in-law, Donald Trump, was in the White House. Kushner served as Trumps main envoy to the Middle East and was a key figure in brokering the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and the UAE, and Israel and Bahrain. Kushner announced two of his biggest deals yet last month: a $500 million hotel and condominium complex in Serbia and two luxury developments in Albania. Neither of these deals could have happened without Kushners time working in the Trump administration, where he met the president of Serbia and the prime minister of Albania, who were directly involved in each respective deal.

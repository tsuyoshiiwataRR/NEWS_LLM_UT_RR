    "text": "Embassy of Japan, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary His Excellency\n2024-10-25: Dear Sir,\nHurricane Milton has caused great damage in the United States. Not only in the United States, but also in Russia and China, \"damage\" due to abnormal weather has occurred. .\nThe Amazon River has \"dried up\" in Brazil. In Japan, \"crops\" have \"abnormally har-vested\" due to abnormal weather. \"Seafood\" catches have also changed signifi-cantly. .\nThese abnormal weather events have been blamed on the increase in \"CO2\". The world has been working hard to \"reduce\" \"CO2\". However, there is something that everyone is \"turning a blind eye to\". .\nI think that much of the cause of the increase in \"CO2\" is the increase in the use of \"gunpowder\" in war. The world should conclude a new \"Treaty to Prohibit Explosive Weapons\".\nThe conclusion of a \"Treaty to Prohibit Explosive Weapons\" should take precedence over the \"Paris Convention\" and be applied. Trump believes there are \"oppositions,\" but he should \"insist\" on the creation of a \"ban treaty\" for \"gunpowder weapons.\"\nTrump is advocating withdrawal from the \"Paris Convention,\" but a \"ban treaty\" for \"gunpowder weapons\" should be created. I think \"Harris,\" who supports the Ukraine war, will oppose it, but he should make his case for the sake of humanity.\nThree months have passed since Israel's invasion of Gaza. It has become clear that this war has \"emitted a large amount of CO2,\" which exceeds the annual emissions of \"countries affected by climate change,\" such as the \"Central African Republic.\"\nAccording to a report as of June 2024, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions due to Rus-sia's invasion of Ukraine are expected to reach \"at least 175 million tons.\"\nA group of European experts and the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natu-ral Resources of Ukraine announced this on the 13th. The invasion of Ukraine has increased greenhouse gas emissions. This is the annual emissions of 90 million cars.\nThe report states that the additional greenhouse gases generated in the two years since Russia's invasion of Ukraine have reached at least 175 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2), equivalent to \"the equivalent of 90 million gasoline vehicles\" or \"the annual emissions of the Netherlands.\"\nI agree with the voices that the \"popularization of EVs\" is a \"conspiracy theory.\" It was all a forced \"conspiracy theory\" that CO2 could be reduced by popularizing \"EVs.\"\nI think that the EU should withdraw from the \"Paris Agreement\" and continue selling gasoline vehicles. However, they should make further improvements to reduce CO2 emissions.\nI think that Trump, who loves America's \"gasoline-powered cars,\" was \"right\" in his statement. America should use \"gasoline-powered cars\" to realize \"MAGA.\"\nI find it strange that there is no \"official report\" that publishes the emissions of \"CO2 from gunpowder\" in war. Looking at Ukraine and Gaza, I think that abnormal weather will increase.\nTrump should withdraw from the Paris Agreement and insist on a ban treaty on gunpowder weapons. I think he will be hated by the \"war merchants.\" Good luck, Trump!\nPart 1 Citations/References\nWar accelerates the climate crisis! The enormous impact of Israel's invasion of Ga-za on the planet\nhttps://www.eco-online.org/news-2024-1-11/\nI will write again tomorrow.\nPart 2. Japan is a \"state of abnormal human rights violations\". \"Everyone\" of the \"international community\", please help!\nFirst of all, please read \"false accusation\" in the 2010 \"Crime of Supporting Violation of Immigration Law\".\nReason for punishment:\nA Chinese national obtained a \"residence status\" by submitting a \"false employment contract.\" And they committed immigration law violations (activities outside of their qualifications).\nBecause \"we\" provided \"false employment contract documents\" to the Chinese, the Chinese were able to obtain \"residence status.\"\nThe Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan because they obtained a \"status of residence\".\nBecause the Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan, they were able to \"work illegally.\"\nTherefore, ``we'' who ``provided'' the Chinese with ``false employment contract documents'' were punished as ``helping'' the Chinese ``activities outside the scope of their status of residence''.\nThis is an arbitrary \"error of applicable law\". This is out of the \"logic of the law\".\nMy claim:\n\"1\" The Immigration Control Act stipulates that the Minister of Justice will take an \"administrative disposition\" (Immigration Control Act: Cancellation of the status of residence) for the act of submitting false documents and obtaining a status of residence. You are now \"finished\". \"Aiding\" an act of innocence is innocence.\nA Chinese national who has engaged in “2” (activities outside the qualification) is not guilty. The reason is that the \"person who hired them\" has not been punished for \"promoting illegal employment\" under the Immigration Control Act. Therefore, by \"equality under the law\", the Chinese are innocent.\nThe revision of the Immigration Control Law in December 2016 made it possible to punish the act of \"providing\" \"false employment contract documents\".\nImplemented from January 2017. According to Article 39 of the Constitution, it is not possible to \"retroactively\" to the \"past\" and \"punish\".\nhttps://www.moj.go.jp/isa/laws/h28_kaisei.html\nSee \"Indictment.\" The stated facts \"state\" the \"fact\" of \"not guilty.\" (Japanese English)\nhttp://www.miraico.jp/ICC-crime/2Related%20Documents/%EF%BC%91Indictment.pdf\n\"My Appeal\" (Japanese)\nhttps://blog.goo.ne.jp/nipponnoasa/e/d28c05d97af7a48394921a2dc1ae8f98\n\"My Appeal\" (English)\nhttps://blog.goo.ne.jp/nipponnoasa/e/ac718e4f2aab09297bdab896a94bd194\n\"Chinese, Korean, Filipino, American, etc.\" There are more than tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of victims all over the world. An unusual number of people.\nProsecutors' \"(deprivation) of liberty\" is \"arbitrary.\" They are \"disobeying the law\" and \"selfish\". They have no \"(logical) (necessity)\". The prosecution is \"punishing\" \"as they wish\".\nIn 2010, \"me and the Chinese\" in the immigration violation case, and in 2013, Philippine Embassy staff and diplomats were also punished for the same reason.\n\"I\" argued \"not guilty\", explaining with \"logic of the law\".\nPolice and prosecutors then said, \"(You) should admit (your crime) in general terms.\"\nJapan is the only country that punishes in general terms! .\nThe judge stated \"Causal relationship\" with crazy \"logic\". When I \"see\" (text of the judgment), I \"laugh out loud.\"\nThis case is an error of arbitrary application of law by police officers, prosecutors and judges. The charges are \"abuse of authority of a special public official\" and \"crimes of false complaints.\" The prosecution \"killed\" the \"accusation letter\" and \"accusation letter\" by \"ex officio.\" Therefore, the statute of limitations has been suspended.\nI am \"appealing\" two things.\n1: The foreigner performed \"illegal labor\" other than \"status of residence\". But foreigners are innocent because of \"equality under the law\".\n2: The prosecution “applied” “Articles 60 and 62 of the Penal Code” to Article 70 of the Immigration Control Act on the grounds of “support for Article 22-4-4 of the Immigration Act”. However, it is \"error of applicable law\". (as above).\nKoreans make demands on Japan over the \"solved\" \"comfort women and forced laborers\" issue, but should support \"tens of thousands of Korean victims\" who have been punished for \"violating immigration laws.\" .\nThe Japanese government is hiding Japan's human rights violations by making up such things as \"human rights violations against Uyghurs in China.\"\n\"I\" am demanding \"restoration of honor\" and \"compensation\" for myself, the Chinese, and the Philippine Embassy officials.\nEveryone in the world! ! Victims should report to their respective governments. The governments of each country have an obligation to demand the Japanese government to restore the honor of their own citizens and compensate them.\nPart 3. Construction of special zones.\nThe \"special zone\" \"accepts\" refugees and immigrants as \"temporary immigrant\" workers, limiting their residence to the \"special zone\". Developed countries can use them as low-wage workers for economic growth, and refugees and immigrants can get jobs and live a hopeful human life.\nNo2:\nhttps://world-special-zone.seesaa.net/\nNo1:\nhttps://naganoopinion.blog.jp/\nPart 4. Ukraine war.\nZelensky took office on an \"election promise\" to scrap the Minsk Accords and regain territory through war. But when news of his tax evasion and tax havens came to light, he started a war.\nNo2:\nhttps://ukrainawar.seesaa.net/\nNo1:\nhttps://ukrainian-war.blog.jp/\nPart 5. \"U.S., Russia, and China\" Tripartite Military Alliance/War Show\nTo create a world without war, we need a “Tripartite Military Alliance”!\nNo2:\nhttps://urc-military.seesaa.net/\nNo1:\nhttps://sangokugunzidoumei.blog.jp//\nPart 6. Japan's notorious judicial system and human rights violations\nJapan's judicial system: Immigration law violation case False accusation: Nissan Ghosn case False accusation: Abuse at immigration facility: International student/intern student case: Non-interference in domestic affairs: Foreign opinions\nNo2:\nhttps://nipponsihou.seesaa.net/\nNo1:\nhttps://humanrightsopinion.blog.jp/\nPart 7.

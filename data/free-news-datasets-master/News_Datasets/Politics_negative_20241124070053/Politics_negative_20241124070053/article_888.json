    "text": "Cleveland Browns file lawsuit to get clarity of the ‘Modell Law’ CLEVELAND, Ohio (WOIO) - The Cleveland Browns filed a lawsuit to seek clarity in the [“Modell Law” which the City of Cleveland plans on using](https://www.cleveland19.com/2024/10/22/cleveland-city-council-express-concerns-about-browns-moving-out-downtown/) to keep the team from moving to Brook Park, Ohio. The Browns Chief Operating Officer Dave Jenkins released the following statement about the suit: Throughout our future stadium planning process, we have always acted transparently and in good faith with the City of Cleveland and are disappointed in the City’s latest course of action stating its intent to bring litigation regarding the “Modell Law”. These statements and similar actions create uncertainty and do not serve the interests of Greater Cleveland. Therefore, today we have filed a lawsuit seeking clarity on this vague and unclear law. As we have consistently conveyed, the intent of our future stadium planning has always been to work in collaboration with our local leaders to find the optimal long-term stadium solution that will benefit our fans while positively impacting our region. Our lease expires at the end of the 2028 season, and we are working hard to develop a long-term solution upon completion of our current agreement. Today’s action for declaratory judgment was filed to take this matter out of the political domain and ensure we can move this transformative project forward to make a new domed Huntington Bank Field in Brook Park a reality. We have no interest in any contentious legal battle but are determined to create a project that will add to Greater Cleveland by building a dome stadium and adjacent mix-used development, a $3-3.5B project, that will include approximately $2B in private investment. This project will bring premier events and economic activity that will generate significant revenue for the City, County and State. As this is now an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comments. We look forward to a positive resolution. Read complaint below: Copyright 2024 WOIO. All rights reserved.",

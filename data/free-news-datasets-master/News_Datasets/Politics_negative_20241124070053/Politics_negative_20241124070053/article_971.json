    "text": "Grammy Award-winning artist John Legend has never been shy about expressing his political opinions. Recently, Legend aimed sharp criticism at former U.S. President Donald Trump, accusing him of pushing racist rhetoric, particularly against immigrants.\nDuring an appearance on Shannon Sharpe’s Club Shay Shay podcast, Legend voiced strong opposition to Trump’s past remarks about Haitian immigrants. Trump had falsely claimed that these immigrants were eating domesticated pets in Springfield, Ohio, a town close to Legend’s heart as his birthplace. Legend did not hold back, calling Trump’s rhetoric dangerous and racially charged.\n“When he talks about immigration, he’s talking about Black and brown people from the global South,” Legend explained. “He says they’re messing up the gene pool in America, which implies an ideal, white America. It’s a thinly veiled racist argument.”\nEchoes of History Legend went on to compare Trump’s views on race and immigration to disturbing historical ideologies. “That takes us back to Hitler. That takes us back to eugenics,” the singer said. “He believes there’s a genetic hierarchy determined by race. As a Black man, I can’t imagine supporting someone who sees me as inferior because of my race.”\nThis is not the first time Legend has been outspoken against Trump. Throughout his career, he has supported candidates who represent a more inclusive vision for America, backing figures like Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and more recently, Kamala Harris.\nAbortion Rights and Personal Experience for John Legend Legend also weighed in on the issue of reproductive rights, which he connected to Trump’s influence on state-level abortion laws. Reflecting on his wife Chrissy Teigen’s traumatic experience with a pregnancy loss, Legend expressed outrage over abortion bans in states like Texas and Georgia. “The government needs to evaluate whether you are ‘sufficiently dying’ before you can have an abortion,” he said. “Not your doctor. Not your family. The government.”\nJohn Legend’s fiery remarks highlight his deep concerns about Trump’s political influence and the societal consequences of his rhetoric. As the 2024 election draws near, his words are bound to resonate with many Americans.",

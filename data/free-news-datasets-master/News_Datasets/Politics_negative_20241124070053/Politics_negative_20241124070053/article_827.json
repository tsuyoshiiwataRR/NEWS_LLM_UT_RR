    "text": "Tory leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick has said all Nato countries should up their defence spending to 3% of GDP.\nSpeaking to The Telegraph, Mr Jenrick said: “Peace comes through strength. To deter a Russian invasion of Nato, we must spend 3% of GDP on defence and make that the new Nato standard for all member states.\n“We must prepare for an American pivot to the Indo-Pacific to contain China, which means the UK and Europe stepping up to defend against Russian belligerence. The age of freeloading has come to an end.”\nKemi Badenoch is bidding to be Tory leader (GB News/PA) Mr Jenrick also said the West should reduce its dependency on China and prepare for China to invade Taiwan “within three years”.\nThe former immigration minister has also said he wants to get rid of the Climate Change Act, Equality Act and Human Rights Act and instead introduce a “Great Reform Act” if he becomes Prime Minister.\nMr Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch were confirmed as the final two candidates in the race to replace Rishi Sunak earlier this month, after James Cleverly failed to make it through the last round of MP voting in a surprise result.\nThey are hoping to secure the support of Conservative Party members in the final ballot of the leadership contest.\nThe result will be announced on November 2.",

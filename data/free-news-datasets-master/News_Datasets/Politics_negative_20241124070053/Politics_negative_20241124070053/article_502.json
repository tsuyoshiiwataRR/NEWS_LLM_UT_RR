    "text": "( DCNF )‚ÄîJournalist Mark Halperin said Thursday that Vice President Kamala Harris‚Äô ‚Äúperformance‚Äù during her Wednesday CNN town hall left many Democrats feeling resigned about her candidacy. Harris faced criticism for her indirect answers during the event from CNN host Dana Bash and CNN senior political commentator David Axelrod shortly following the town hall . Halperin , on his 2WAY platform , asserted Democrats now realize Harris won‚Äôt have the chance to sharpen her skills, with the presidential campaign nearing its end. Trending: All Recombinant ‚ÄúVaccines‚Äù and Adjuvants ‚Äì Not Just Covid-19 Jabs ‚Äì Are Now Implicated in DNA Contamination Scandal WATCH: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to go overboard here and say, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs over, [former President Donald] Trump‚Äôs going to win.‚Äô But a lot of what we‚Äôre going to talk about today is not great for Kamala Harris. Again, it doesn‚Äôt mean Trump‚Äôs a great guy in the eyes of all of America,‚Äù Halperin said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt mean Trump‚Äôs going to win, but where we are right now is there are increasing problems for the Democratic Party. You saw it in the punditry from Democrats last night on CNN after the town hall.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou saw it on morning television, where Democratic pundits, trying to be poker-faced, are clearly feeling what a lot of Democratic donors are feeling and Democratic elected officials are feeling, which is there‚Äôs no time left for her to get better,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúAnd I think the biggest story of the news cycle is, along with ‚ÄòTrump loves Hitler,‚Äô which we‚Äôll talk about, is her performance last night was the last straw for a lot of Democrats. No more ‚Äòthe more she does it, the better she‚Äôll get.‚Äô‚Äù The journalist then prompted Democratic strategist Dan Turrentine to share his perception of the town hall ‚Äúand why it‚Äôs considered in Democratic circles to be such a disaster.‚Äù Turrentine started by asserting Harris effectively advanced her messaging accusing Trump of being ‚Äúa fascist‚Äù before expressing concern about how the vice president performed. ‚ÄúWe saw this in 2019, and there was a hope that as she did more interviews and settled down and got more comfortable, that you would see kind of a human being with some passion, some humor. Because we talk about it ‚Äî Trump is having fun. Like it is clear as day that he‚Äôs feeling pretty good,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo I think the frustrating part to Democrats is it is clear that she is just not really capable right now of answering that question: ‚ÄòWhy should I be for you?‚Äô And I hope that enough voters decide that she doesn‚Äôt have to, but I don‚Äôt feel confident about that.‚Äù Harris currently trails Trump in all of the seven top swing states, according to the RealClear Polling averages. Halperin asserted Tuesday that Trump will be president-elect on Nov. 5 if the current early voting trajectory persists.",

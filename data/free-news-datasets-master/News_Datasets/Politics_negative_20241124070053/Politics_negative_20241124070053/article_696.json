    "text": "Call 212-577-3300 News No guns were found during last summer’s thirty-day trial of weapons scanners in the New York City Subway system, according to a new report by PIX 11 News. As The Legal Aid Society warned back in July, these invasive technologies are ineffective and frequently trigger false alarms, 118 in the pilot program alone, according to the data provided by the NYPD. “It’s now abundantly clear why the Administration delayed releasing these figures. Not only did the Evolv scanners detect zero firearms, but they triggered 118 false alarms, compromising the safety of subway riders,” reads a statement from The Legal Aid Society. “This is objectively a failure, no matter how hard City Hall tries to spin this data.” “Given this failed pilot, all the other overwhelming evidence against using Evolv’s weapons detectors, and the surrounding controversies, including lawsuits and various investigations,” the statement continues. “We hope that this ill-conceived, fraught, and unwanted idea is finally shelved for good.” Last Updated: 24 October 2024 2024 The Legal Aid Society.

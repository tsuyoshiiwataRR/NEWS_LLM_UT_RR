    "text": "With all eyes on the swing states that are set to decide the fate of the presidential election, a group of Texans recently traveled to Wisconsin to campaign for President Donald Trump. The Texas Strike Force, a volunteer organization working in coordination with the Republican Party and conservative groups, set up shop for a week in Milwaukee, determined to rally support for Trump. Dwayne Collins, who led the delegation of 16, said the group knocked on doors in the “belly of the beast.” “What we see when people come by and honk and thumbs up or give us a hug, what you see are the working men. Plumbers, electricians, truckers. The working people are Trumpers. We’re trying to get that group to the polls,” said Collins. This isn’t the first time the Texas Strike Force has left the Lone Star State to rally support for conservative candidates. Over the past 12 years, the group has campaigned for candidates up and down the ballot in states like Wisconsin, Louisiana, Iowa, and Georgia. The group is a segment of the Mighty American Strike Force, which consists of thousands of volunteers across the country. “A lot of times we work with the Republican parties in the various areas. This time we’re working with Charlie Kirk’s Turning Point Action,” said Collins. “And their goal is for each one of us to get 100 people and follow them up, make sure they get to the vote, get to the polls and vote. And of course, we’re doing more than 100 since we’ve been here for a week.” The response when voters find out they traveled all the way from Texas? “When we tell them we’re from Texas, they tend to want to listen to what we have to say. And of course, we point out the attributes of Trump. And of course, being from Texas, the one thing we mention is the illegal immigration situation that we’re dealing with. It really hits us in Texas,” said Collins.",

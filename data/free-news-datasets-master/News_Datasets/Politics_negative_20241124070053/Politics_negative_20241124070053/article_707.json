    "text": "Legislators on Thursday grilled and sought policy promises from Maryland’s public safety and correctional services secretary and other department officials about the lack of communication, safety policies and adequate equipment for parole and probation agents. The legislators were clearly agitated by what they viewed as a lack of sufficient improvement in the Division of Parole and Probation in the months since Davis Martinez, a 33-year-old agent, was found dead on May 31 inside the Chevy Chase home of a man he was monitoring. The man, Emanuel Edward Sewell, 54, was released in 2021 after nearly 25 years in prison for breaking into a man’s home and brutally sexually assaulting him, according to news reports. He was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and has since been deemed not competent to stand trial. It appeared that parole and probation agents may still be unable to easily access new protective equipment, including bulletproof and stab-proof vests. For communication while conducting home visits, the agents carry just a cellphone, much to the surprise of Republican Sen. Bill Folden, a police officer who questioned why agents don’t carry a two-way radio. The division is burdened by its caseload, with each agent often handling more cases than national standards call for, said Democratic Sen. Sarah Elfreth. The caseloads are driven in part by vacancies at the division, which officials hope will be filled in the coming months. Four legislative committees scheduled the hearing in response to Martinez’s death in May. Leaders of Maryland’s largest public union in June called for a new home visit policy and investigation into the Division of Parole and Probation. Public Safety and Correctional Services Services Carolyn J. Scruggs said Thursday that a department investigation into the incident found no violations of department policy contributing to the tragedy. But, the secretary said, “it became clear that the mindset surrounding the supervision practices within (the Division of Parole and Probation) needed to be strengthened.” Scruggs replaced the director and two other top officials within the division shortly after the incident, and on Thursday she outlined a series of other changes or plans for changes within the division, including a stress-call system for agents conducting home visits. Questions remained, though. It was unclear to lawmakers on Thursday why Martinez was missing for several hours before an emergency call was placed. Scruggs at one point said that there wasn’t a specific policy in place for when to call the police in such an event. Police officers can accompany parole and probation agents on their home visits, but law enforcement agencies are often too understaffed and overstretched to do so. Democratic Del. Jared Solomon said he expects the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services to establish a written policy stating that the agents must have an officer accompany them on home visits, even if it requires delaying a scheduled visit to accommodate an officer’s schedule. Martinez was alone when he visited Sewell’s home. Following Martinez’s death, the AFSCME Maryland Council 3 union suspended in-home agent visits and called for the division to continue virtual home visits until officials negotiated a new policy with the union. The practice remained suspended as of Thursday. Union members have said that Scruggs and her department repeatedly ignored their concerns about agents’ safety, and that Martinez’s death could have been prevented if officials had listened to member’s attempts to discuss health and safety issues.",

This meeting took place on Thursday afternoon. The PTI legal team had planned for three lawyers to meet Khan at the jail at 3pm. The meeting commenced as scheduled and concluded around 4pm. The order to bring Khan from jail to court was initially meant for the lawyers’ meeting. But a solution was proposed to facilitate the meeting within the jail itself, and all parties involved were informed accordingly. Advocate Faisal Chaudhry confirmed the meeting with Imran Khan at 3pm, stating, “I was called for a jail meeting along with Salman Akram Raja and Shoaib Shaheen.” Court says produce Khan Islamabad High Court ordered authorities to produce former Prime Minister Imran Khan by 3pm on Thursday. Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq stated that if the government fails to produce him, it must provide a valid reason. The superintendent of Adiala Jail, where Khan is currently imprisoned, was instructed by the court to ensure his presence. The court further emphasized that the government must satisfy the court regarding any security threats cited as a reason for Khan’s non-appearance. Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq questioned the notification presented by the Punjab government, stating it only covered the period from October 21st to 25th and demanded the earlier notification as well.

    "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris continued her campaign’s abortion extremism during an interview with NBC News’s Hallie Jackson on Tuesday. When asked about religious exemptions for abortion, Harris stated, “I don’t think we should be making concessions when we’re talking about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body.” The Democratic nominee for president believes in forcing religious healthcare providers to perform abortions, a procedure that goes against many of their deeply held religious beliefs. It’s further proof a Harris administration would be authoritarian and infringe on religious rights while masquerading as freedom-loving and tolerant. Harris has been radically pro-abortion during her entire political career. Her history shows she is more than willing to target religious healthcare providers with punishment for not bowing to societal pressure. In 2018, then-Sen. Harris proposed and sponsored the Do No Harm Act . The legislation was in direct response to the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores and Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania cases, both of which received favorable Supreme Court rulings. In each, the high court allowed for religious exemptions within the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate. At the time the Do No Harm bill was introduced, Harris was adamant: “That First Amendment guarantee [of religious freedom] should never be used to undermine other Americans’ civil rights or subject them to discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity,” she said . Ironic, considering Harris wishes to undermine freedom and openly discriminate against religious healthcare organizations because they refuse to take the life of an unborn human being. It is hardly surprising that Catholic hospitals and other Catholic healthcare clinics would push back against government attempts to strong-arm them into performing abortions. The Catholic Church opposes the act of abortion. Allowing a religious exemption for Catholic hospitals and other faith-based medical organizations does not prohibit a woman from seeking an abortion elsewhere. The number of abortions in the United States has actually increased since 2020 . During her NBC interview, Harris repeated the claim that “a basic freedom has been taken from the women of America,” referencing the Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. This is wholly false. While women in the U.S. have the freedom to secure abortion services at a variety of places, a Harris administration wishes to force religious providers to violate their core values. Harris has made abortion a cornerstone of her campaign since it began only three months ago. As a woman attempting to become the first female president, she presents herself as genuinely sympathetic when it concerns “reproductive rights.” But that concern only extends to women who find themselves with unwanted or unexpected pregnancies. And Harris’s only solution is to push abortion to get rid of the “problem” of a supposedly inconvenient life. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Without a doubt, religious exemptions should always exist for abortion and other reproductive-related issues such as contraception. As long as abortion is permitted in the U.S., there must be protections for those whose faith does not allow their participation in it. Harris says abortion “cannot be negotiable.” What really should be nonnegotiable is protecting our foundational freedoms. Harris is no friend to religious people, and she actively stood on the side of religious oppression while in Congress and during the last four years as vice president. Her desire to continue this anti-Americanism while in the Oval Office should greatly alarm voters, whether they’re personally religious or not.

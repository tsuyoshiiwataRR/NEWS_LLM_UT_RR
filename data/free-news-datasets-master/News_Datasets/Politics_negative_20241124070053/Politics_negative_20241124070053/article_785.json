    "text": "HOUSTON, Texas – The man who is accused of shooting his girlfriend to death and then dumping her body next to a dumpster is on the run after authorities say he never showed up to his murder trial.\nStephen Chaney, 33, was found guilty of murdering Claudi Leiva in 2020. When Chaney did not show up to court, the judge decided to proceed the trial without him and a jury ultimately found him guilty.\nRecommended Videos\nChaney was set to begin his murder trial on Oct. 9, but according to a citation issued by the court, Chaney never appeared at his trial and his bond has since been revoked. It’s believed that Chaney, who was supposed to be wearing an ankle monitor during his bond release, cut off the monitor.\nWhat Happened? On Aug. 12, 2020, Houston police responded to the Rose Tree apartments in apartments in north Houston and found Leiva lying on the ground, unresponsive, covered with boards, and next to a dumpster. Police said it appeared she had been shot in her head and her body had been in the location for several days before being discovered.\nAccording to court records, investigators collected surveillance video, showing Chaney driving a black Chevrolet Trailblazer and parking next to the dumpster. He then exited the vehicle, walked towards the back of the car, near the dumpster, observed the area, and then dragged a body to the dumpster, placing boards on top. He also took a bag and threw it in the dumpster.\nOn Aug. 15, Houston police received a missing person’s report matching the description of Leiva.\nLeiva’s mother reported her missing, stating she last communicated with her daughter on Aug. 11. She mentioned that her daughter had been prostituted by several men and had recently filed a harassment report against a man. Investigators discovered the report, filed on Aug. 7, identifying Chaney as the man accused of harassment.\nInvestigators searched Leiva’s phone and found several text messages between her and Chaney. Court documents show Leiva asking Chaney several times not to kill her and also telling him that she no longer wanted to date or see him. Investigators said Chaney did not take that well.\nInvestigators used Chaney’s phone records, along with surveillance video, to charge him with murder.\nCopyright 2024 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.",

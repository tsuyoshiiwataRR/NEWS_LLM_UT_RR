    "text": "By David Lynch ,\n27 minutes ago Donald Trump’s campaign has complained about the UK Labour Party to US federal election authorities (PA) PA Archive The Prime Minister has not spoken to Donald Trump since the presidential candidate’s campaign claimed the Labour Party was interfering in the US election.\nSir Keir Starmer was asked if he had called Mr Trump to smooth over the row about Labour staffers campaigning for Kamala Harris.\n“No, he’s in the middle of a campaign,” Sir Keir told ITV.\n“Also I think we need just a little bit of perspective here. This is Labour Party members of staff volunteering in their spare time in the election. It’s happened at every election, it happens across the world.”\nSir Keir Starmer has called for ‘a little bit of perspective’ in the row (Stefan Rousseau/PA) (PA Wire) Mr Trump’s team has filed an official complaint with US federal election authorities, in which they claim the UK Labour Party has “made, and the Harris campaign has accepted, illegal foreign national contributions”.\nSenior Labour officials were also said to have met Ms Harris’s campaign staff.\nSir Keir has insisted that his relationship with Mr Trump, who could be the next US president following the closely fought race, would not be jeopardised by the incident.\nWhen he travelled to New York in September, Sir Keir had also hoped to meet Ms Harris but was not able to schedule a meeting.\nThe Labour Party has said it is common practice for campaigners of all political persuasions from around the world to volunteer in US elections and that any Labour activists who take part do so at their own expense and in line with US laws and rules.",

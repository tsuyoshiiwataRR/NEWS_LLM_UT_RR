    "text": "According to House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter (R-Rainsville), the Beason-Hammon Alabama Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act (HB 56) undermined by the federal courts could get another look, if necessary. During an interview that aired on Wednesday's broadcast of Mobile radio FM Talk 106.5's \"The Jeff Poor Show,\" Ledbetter acknowledged that a win by Vice President Kamala Harris in next month's presidential election could mean action from the Alabama Legislature on immigration, including revisiting HB 56. However, he also questioned the federal court for gutting HB 56 and interfering with the State of Alabama redistricting efforts. \"[I] thought [House Bill] 56 was a good bill, to be honest with you,\" he said. \"It bothers me, to be quite frank, because if you look at what's going on with our court system — I mean, elections have consequences. You know, we have got the majority in the state, and even when we drew the district lines for the congressional districts, you know, that was done by the people that were put in office. And it was [over]turned by the courts.\" \"I think the three branches of government should stay separate,\" Ledbetter added. \"And unfortunately, I'm not seeing that right now. With HB 56 and with the district lines that we've seen, it was changed. I mean, the thing that the founding fathers meant was for separation. And I think the judicial is getting involved in the legislation, and I don't think that's right.” Jeff Poor is the editor in chief of 1819 News and host of \"The Jeff Poor Show,\" heard Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-noon on Mobile's [FM Talk 106.5](http://fmtalk1065.com/).

    "text": "Ottawa’s drastic immigration cuts have sent shockwaves across Canada even though a growing number of Canadians are saying the country has accepted too many newcomers amid a stagnant economy and rising cost of living. Over the past year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government has signalled the need to rein in the surge of international students and temporary foreign workers, but the sharp reduction in permanent immigration was a first after years of steady increases by successive governments since the early 1990s. The pulling back of the welcome mat has surprised many observers from advocates to the business sector, immigration lawyers and politicians, adding further uncertainty in an already volatile system for migrants and over what impacts the cuts would have on the labour market, economy and demographics in both short and long terms. “In the tumultuous times as we emerged from the pandemic between addressing labour needs and maintaining population growth, we didn’t get the balance quite right,” Trudeau told reporters in unveiling [the new immigration plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/supplementary-immigration-levels-2025-2027.html) on Thursday. “Immigration is essential for Canada’s future, but it must be controlled and it must be sustainable. With today’s annual immigration plan, that is precisely what we’re doing.” Under the plan, Canada will reduce its annual intake of permanent residents by 21 per cent to 395,000 next year, 380,000 in 2026 and 365,000 in 2027 — following similar trends in other major immigration countries such as the U.K. and Australia. The announcement came just days after a long-term tracking poll by Environics Institute [found 58 per cent of Canadians said there’s too much immigration](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/clear-majority-of-canadians-now-say-theres-too-much-immigration/article_4d60afbe-8c8e-11ef-9ad4-df0258692913.html) — the first time in a quarter-century that a clear majority of respondents share that view. The share of skilled and economic permanent residents will be about 60 per cent, followed by those in family reunification (24 per cent) and the rest, about 16 per cent, will be from the humanitarian and refugee stream. Canada’s temporary population including international students and foreign workers will also be slashed by 445,901 in 2025, 445,662 in 2026 but increased modestly by 17,439 in 2027. Canada’s population is inching toward 42 million by year end, up from 38 million in 2019, [growth primarily attributed to immigration](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/canada-is-getting-bigger-are-we-setting-the-country-and-its-newest-citizens-up-for/article_ea2d0580-9f24-5aca-83ad-24c06e6c126a.html), which was [key to Ottawa’s economic recovery strategy after the pandemic](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/canada-plans-record-levels-of-immigration-in-roadmap-to-post-covid-19-economic-recovery/article_9855e6fd-26f1-513f-9d60-c37cdb3480ce.html). Over the five-year period, the annual targets for new permanent residents rose to 485,000 from 330,800. The plan is expected to result in a population decline of 0.2 per cent in each of the next two years before returning to a population growth of 0.8 per cent in 2027, by which time about 670,000 fewer housing units would be required, said Immigration Minister Marc Miller. Diana Palmerin-Velasco, a director of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said the business community understands the need for a sustainable immigration system but is concerned about the plan’s implications on the labour market. “It seems that the government might be overreacting,” she said. “It’s not just 100,000 fewer permanent residents. We are also expecting to see 400,000 fewer temporary residents. We are talking about 500,000 people.” The cuts to permanent resident levels are affecting all immigration programs. The federal economic immigration class — where applicants are primarily from abroad — is the hardest hit, with its permanent resident spots cut by 60 per cent next year. The provincial immigration programs that allow provinces to hand-pick skilled newcomers to fill regional gaps will be cut to 55,000 from 120,000. The cuts to the provincial programs will impede Ontario’s ability to bring in as many skilled trades workers to build more housing, transit and expand highways, said David Piccini, minister of labour, immigration, training and skills development. “They’ve created a problem. They’re attempting to fix it,” he said, referring to the federal government. “What I do fundamentally disagree with is doing it on the backs of our provincial nominee program, which is Ontario’s strongest tool to bring in skilled trades women and men, and in health-care professions like nurses” and personal support workers. Since it was elected in 2015, the government had raised annual permanent resident targets from 272,000 to 485,000 this year, with the biggest jump in 2021 to 401,000 when the border reopened after the pandemic and Ottawa resorted to immigration as an economic stimulant. Rules were relaxed to welcome more international students and temporary foreign workers to fill immediate labour shortages, with job vacancies reaching one million in 2022. As hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians sought temporary refuge from the Russian invasion, Canada saw its temporary resident population skyrocket from 924,850 to over three million, or 7.2 per cent of the overall population today. Since last November, Ottawa started imposing new rules on study and work permits in an attempt to rein in the number of international students and foreign workers. It has capped the number of new study permits issued and set a target of reducing the temporary residents’ share of the overall population to five per cent over three years. “Today’s immigration flip-flop is a massive admission of failure by Justin Trudeau,” said Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. “Trudeau has suddenly admitted that radical, uncontrolled immigration and policies related to it are partly to blame for joblessness, housing and health-care crises.” Scotiabank economist Rebekah Young said the drastic cuts to both permanent and temporary immigration are going to have a near-term macro impact on the economy, and there will be trade-offs. “They are a source of labour supply and they provide economic activity through the workforce, but they also consume,” said Young. “We’re likely left with lower GDP, but not necessarily a stronger trajectory for the growth outlook.” While a tighter labour market may provide incentives for businesses to invest in technology, research and capital, it would also be disruptive to the economy, she said. On Thursday, Miller said the department will prioritize the transition of temporary residents in Canada by allocating 40 per cent of the permanent spots in 2025 to migrants already studying and working here. There will also be a smaller-scale regularization plan to grant legal status to undocumented migrants. “These people are a young labour pool. They are skilled. They’re here,” he told reporters. “They’ve begun the process of integration and it doesn’t place the additional demands on the housing, health-care and social services that we see with someone that comes directly from another country.” Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said the cuts are troubling to employers and small businesses. “A restaurant owner who can’t find a cook ready and willing to work in their community will not have work for the Canadians who may work in the front of the house,” he said. “We need to rethink many of these recent changes and be ready to turn the dial back up.” In an open letter, a coalition of more than 100 community groups expressed disappointment in the reduction in temporary and permanent immigration. “This government was elected on a pro-immigration platform and promised permanent resident status for migrant workers, students and undocumented people at the start of the current mandate,” it said. “Not delivering on them will be remembered at the ballot box.” The cuts mean migrants will be forced to remain temporary or become undocumented, and pushed further into exploitative jobs and conditions, said Syed Hussan of the Migrant Rights Network. The Canadian Immigration Lawyers Association called the pullback a “dark day” for Canada, warning of economic, fiscal and social damage. “We still have an aging population, low birth rate, and pressing economic and fiscal pressures,” said Barbara Jo Caruso, its co-president. “Canada’s fundamental need for immigration has not changed.” Diana Gallego, president of the Canadian Council for Refugees, said behind the numbers slashed from the humanitarian component of the levels are 14,000 real people struggling under persecution or in conflict zones around the world. “Canada has betrayed the world’s refugees,” she said.

    "text": "[U.S. News](../)\nBallots burned in Arizona mailbox fire days before election\nPHOENIX — A mailbox in central Phoenix with 20 ballots inside was set ablaze early Thursday morning.\nThe ballots placed inside the box at 7th Avenue and Indian School Road were damaged as a result of the fire, according to [ABC 15 Arizona](//www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/ballots-damaged-after-usps-mail-collection-box-fire-near-7th-avenue-and-indian-school-road). It’s unknown if the motive was election-related.\nThe mail drop box appeared to be gone when The Post physically checked the scene Thursday morning, with just one of the usual two there remaining.\nThe suspect was arrested Thursday afternoon, said Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, who [thanked](//x.com/MayorGallego/status/1849515749942944222) authorities for “swift action.”\n“An unknown individual arrived early Thursday to the United States Post Office, located at 3905 North 7th Avenue and lit a fire inside the blue drive-up collection mailbox. The Phoenix Fire Department responded, firefighters forced the box open and extinguished the fire,” the department told The Post.\n“Approximately 20 electoral ballots were damaged, along with additional miscellaneous mail. The Postal Inspector took possession of the damaged ballots and mail. The Phoenix Fire Investigations Task Force, which includes Phoenix Police detectives and Phoenix Fire investigators, are working with US Postal Inspectors.”\nMaricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer told The Post people who dropped their ballot off at the mailbox recently should make sure it’s received.\n“We are waiting for details from law enforcement. We encourage all voters who used that mailbox in the last 36 hours to check the status of their ballots at [BeBallotReady.Vote](//urldefense.com/v3/__https:/BeBallotReady.Vote__;!!F0Stn7g!C-y0s7H6WI2bTrX08f0mojJoDpfBDMnNouwXjBT3skAipOX72rFB7ZkoNXCqldBUCqzDU1qk2oNKgxlSwuWVukTH-69oAhNv$). Successful delivery is usually reflected on that website within 72 hours,” he said. “Voters should be aware that tomorrow, October 25, is the last day to request a replacement ballot. If a voter believes they were impacted by this incident they can learn more about how to make that request at [Request.Maricopa.Vote](//urldefense.com/v3/__https:/Request.Maricopa.Vote__;!!F0Stn7g!C-y0s7H6WI2bTrX08f0mojJoDpfBDMnNouwXjBT3skAipOX72rFB7ZkoNXCqldBUCqzDU1qk2oNKgxlSwuWVukTH-9JGK6Rq$).”\nArizona is a hotly contested swing state, with former President Donald Trump rallying Thursday in Tempe.\n[He’s up 1 point](//nypost.com/2024/10/24/us-news/trump-sees-swing-state-momentum-in-latest-polls/) against Vice President Kamala Harris, per the latest Marist College poll.\nDemocratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz is visiting the Grand Canyon State Saturday, and his Republican counterpart J.D. Vance rallied voters in Tucson and Peoria Tuesday.\n[World News](/)||\n[Latest News](/news)||\n[U.S. News](../../us-news)\n[Source link](//nypost.com/2024/10/24/us-news/ballots-burned-in-arizona-mailbox-fire-days-before-election/)",

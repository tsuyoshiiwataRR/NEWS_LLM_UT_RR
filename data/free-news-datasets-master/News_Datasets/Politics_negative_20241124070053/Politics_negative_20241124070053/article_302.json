    "text": "7 days ago Jersey City Man Sentenced to 225 Months in Prison for Possession with Intent to Distribute Cocaine. Photo by Morristown Minute Jamil King receives a lengthy prison term for his role in local drug trafficking, as part of a broader violent crime crackdown. MORRISTOWN, NJ â€“ Jamil King , a 32-year-old man from Jersey City, has been sentenced to 225 months in federal prison for his involvement in cocaine distribution. U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas handed down the sentence today in Newark, following King's conviction in a trial that highlighted his role as a high-ranking member of the Parkside street gang.\nDuring the trial, evidence presented by federal prosecutors demonstrated that law enforcement officials, executing a search warrant on July 8, 2022, found approximately 50 grams of cocaine in King's residence. The drugs were discovered in a pair of sweatpants that contained King's DNA and matched the sweatshirt he was wearing when police raided his apartment. King attempted to flee the scene but was apprehended.\nIn addition to the prison term, Judge Salas also imposed a three-year period of supervised release upon completion of King's sentence.\nThe successful investigation and subsequent sentencing of King were led by the Jersey City Police Department, with significant contributions from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger acknowledged the collaborative efforts of local and federal agencies under the Jersey City Violent Crime Initiative (VCI). Established in 2018, the VCI aims to combat violent crime in the area through a coordinated approach involving multiple agencies, including the FBI, DEA, and Homeland Security Investigations, among others.\nThe case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Desiree Grace, Chief of the Criminal Division, and Joseph Stern of the General Crimes Unit. This sentencing marks a significant achievement in the ongoing effort to tackle violent crime and drug trafficking in Jersey City.\nFor updates, subscribe to our free newsletter!

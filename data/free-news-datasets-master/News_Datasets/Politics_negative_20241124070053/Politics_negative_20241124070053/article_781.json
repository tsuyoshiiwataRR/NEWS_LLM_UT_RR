    "text": "Hamas commander who was also UN aid worker dead: Israel Israel’s military said on Oct 24 it killed a Hamas commander who took part in the Oct 7, 2023, assault on southern Israel and who also worked for the UN aid agency in the Gaza Strip. The agency, UNRWA, has been accused by Israel of having many employees who double as members of Hamas and other armed groups. The UN said in August that nine UNRWA staff were possibly involved in the Oct 7 attacks and fired them. There was no immediate comment from UNRWA regarding the latest Israeli allegation. Separately, the agency on Oct 23 had said that one of its staff members was killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza Strip. North Korean units already in Kursk region, says Ukraine Ukraine’s military intelligence service said on Oct 24 that the first North Korean units trained in Russia had been deployed in the Kursk region, a Russian border area where Ukrainian forces staged a major incursion in August. The Kremlin has previously dismissed reports about the North’s troop deployment as “fake news”. But Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Oct 24 that it was Moscow’s business how to implement a partnership treaty with Pyongyang. The Russian leader did not deny that North Korean troops were currently in Russia. McDonald’s sued by US man sickened in E. coli outbreak A Colorado man has filed what appears to be the first lawsuit against McDonald’s over an E. coli outbreak linked to Quarter Pounder burgers that has killed one person and sickened nearly 50 others. The lawsuit, filed in Circuit Court in Cook County, Illinois, on Oct 23, alleges that Mr Eric Stelly ate food from a Greeley, Colorado, McDonald’s on Oct 4 and tested positive for E. coli a few days later. Colorado health officials later told Mr Stelly that his E. coli was connected to the McDonald’s outbreak, the lawsuit said. King Charles’ Scotland retreat could become wedding venue Britain’s King Charles III’s remote private estate in the Scottish Highlands could become an exclusive location for weddings, if an application to the local council is approved. Documents submitted for consideration next week by the licensing board of Aberdeenshire Council outline plans to allow “weddings, dinners, meetings and associated events” at the Queen’s Building on the royal Balmoral Estate. The Queen’s Building lies just north of Balmoral Castle near the estate office and stables, and was built in the 1980s as staff quarters and a canteen. Chris Hoy resolved to find positives in cancer diagnosis Six-time Olympic cycling champion Chris Hoy said he is hoping to make a positive impact from his terminal cancer diagnosis after it sparked a surge in men seeking advice. Britain’s most successful Olympian, 48, revealed his prognosis at the weekend, after announcing in February that he had been diagnosed with cancer. Hoy explained he had initially shrugged off pain in his shoulder as an injury caused by exertions in the gym.",

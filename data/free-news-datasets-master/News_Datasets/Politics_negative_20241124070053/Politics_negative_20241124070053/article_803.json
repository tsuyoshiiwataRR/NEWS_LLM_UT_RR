    "text": "The events of January 6, 2021 are etched forever in the halls of infamy. I’ll summarize them briefly. A deceitful and cowardly President called on a crowd of his followers to attack his own government. Under his orders they stormed the United States Capitol, destroying property, threatening people, and temporarily shutting down the operation of our national legislature. In short, he caused a riot. As too often happens in riots, people died. A capitol police office fired on the people breaking in, killing one of them. That person was Ashli Babbitt. I don’t want to get into all the details of what happened –who was Ashli Babbitt, what exactly did she do and why. The important thing to me here is that she died, and she died for Donald Trump. She died for Donald Trump and then Donald Trump betrayed her. That is the literal truth, in the old-fashioned sense of literal, meaning not symbolically or metaphorically, but in the sense that it means exactly what it says. Trump called on his followers to march to the Capitol and fight like hell. Babbitt took him literally and marched to the Capitol, as Trump asked her to do, where she was shot and her life passed out of her body. She died. She died in Donald Trump's name. And then Trump ran away. He literally betrayed her. What do you suppose went through Ashli’s mind as she was dying? Perhaps it was something like this: “It’s not for nothing. It’s not for nothing. I had to save our country. Donald Trump said so. He said if we didn’t fight we would lose our country. Donald Trump said so. I did it, Donald. I did what you asked. Now Donald Trump won’t have to leave the White House. Now he’ll get to stay in the White House. Joe Biden will never get there. Do you hear me, Joe Biden? You’ll never get in the White House. Donald Trump will stay there. He will stay there forever and he will save our country. I won’t see it. I’m going away But it’s not for nothing. It’s not for nothing.” But it was for nothing. She shed her life’s blood for Donald Trump, and then Donald Trump let her down about as much as anyone can let another person down. He got on a helicopter, flew back to Mar-a-Lago and flushed her heroic sacrifice right down his golden toilet. Now Trump wants back in the White House. That’s the place Ashli died to keep him in four years ago. That’s the place he ran away from four years ago. Now, without an ounce of shame or a shred of remorse, he is demanding that we put him back. I know what my response to that is. How about you? ADDITIONAL Donald Trump got 250 million dollars from his supporters to ‘Stop The Steal.’ Then he betrayed them. The January 6 rioters went to prison for Trump. Then Donald betrayed them.",

Frances McDormand, Jon Hamm, and Miranda Richardson co-star. The series is adapted from Gaiman’s novel “Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch,” co-written with Terry Pratchett. Season 3 is produced by Amazon MGM Studios, BBC Studios Productions, the Blank Corporation, and Narrativia.

Production is expected to begin in early 2025 in Scotland.\nThe episode, which is being described as a “forthcoming season” by Prime Video, will “bring to life a serendipitous conversation from almost 35 years ago between the late Sir Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, where they mapped out ‘what happens next’ to the wonderful characters in the world of their internationally bestselling novel.”\n“Good Omens” first premiered as a limited series on Prime Video in May 2019. It was later renewed for a second season, which aired in July 2023. The new third season is produced by Amazon MGM Studios, BBC Studios Productions, and Narrativia. Rob Wilkins of Narrativia, who is representing author Pratchett’s estate, will executive produce along with BBC Studios Productions’ head of comedy Josh Cole.\n“Good Omens” co-creator Gaiman was accused by four women of engaging in nonconcensual “rough and degrading sex” and coercion. The accusations were made during Tortoise Media ‘s four-part podcast “Master: The Allegations Against Neil Gaiman.”\nTwo women who had relationships with Gaiman went on record for the podcast. One of the women worked as a nanny for Gaiman’s child, and claimed Gaiman assaulted her in February 2022 at his New Zealand home. She filed complaint to New Zealand police in October 2022.\nThe second woman alleged that when she was 18 years old, she and Gaiman began a romantic relationship after a book-signing event in Florida in 2003.\nSince the podcast was released, three more women have come forward with allegations of sexual assault and abuse. Tortoise Media released a fifth episode of the podcast that included two of the additional women’s accusations.\nGaiman denied the sexual assault allegations in July 2024.\nHis upcoming Disney+ feature adaptation of “The Graveyard Book” was shelved in the wake of the allegations.\nRead More: Good Omens Neil Gaiman TV Daily Headlines Daily Headlines covering Film, TV and more.

    "text": "WASHINGTON (TNND) — Comedian Bill Maher said in an interview Thursday that Vice President Kamala Harris needs to convince voters undecided on the election that she is not part of the “worst excesses of the left.” “Kamala’s big, I think, challenge here to win over the undecided voters is to convince them that she’s not part of what they suspect she might be, sort of a stealth version of the worst excesses of the left,” the comedian told Joe Scarborough, host of the MSNBC show “Morning Joe.” There are some people who think Harris’s opponent, former President Donald Trump, is less “crazy” than things on the “left” that are “aggressively anti-common sense,” according to Maher. The left side of the political spectrum wasn’t as crazy when former Presidents George Bush and Barack Obama were in office, Maher added, pointing to “cancel culture,” “victim culture” and rising support for Hamas. Harris has campaigned over the past week in swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia, which FiveThirtyEight’s data shows are all supporting a candidate by a margin of one percentage point. READ MORE | Bill Maher slams criticism of his attitude toward liberals: 'Your ideas are stupid' Obama gave a speech at a Detroit rally for Harris on Tuesday. The former president recited lyrics from a song by Eminem, who spoke before him. “I gotta say, you know, I have done a lot of rallies, so I don’t usually get nervous, but I was feeling some kind of way following Eminem,” Obama said. “I noticed my palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy. Vomit on my sweater already, mom’s spaghetti. I’m nervous, but on the surface I look calm and ready to drop bombs, but I keep on forgetting.” Last week, Harris held a rally in La Crosse, Wisconsin, where she told protesters interrupting her speech that they were at the “wrong” rally. The protesters chanted \"Christ is king\" and \"Jesus is Lord\" after the vice president discussed reproductive rights. “I think you meant to go to the smaller one down the street,” she told them. On Thursday, Harris is scheduled to hold a rally in Atlanta with Obama and Bruce Springsteen. Have questions, concerns or tips? Send them to Ray at [ rjlewis@sbgtv.com](mailto:rjlewis@sbgtv.com).",

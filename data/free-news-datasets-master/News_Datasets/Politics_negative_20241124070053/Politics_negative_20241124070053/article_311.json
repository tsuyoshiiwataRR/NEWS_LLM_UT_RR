Contrary to some who claim he has been anointed by God to lead; Trump cannot return the U.S. to faithfulness. Sadly, by embracing such a megalomaniac, Christians have been turning away from those who are curious about the Lord. We lose credibility when we say that God is love, but then rally, and sometimes riot, in support of an individual whose entire worldview centers on himself. Jerushah Duford, Granddaugher of Evangelist Billy Graham, October 2024. The idea that Trump has somehow been \"anointed\" by God to be President of the United States is antithetical to any biblical doctrine of Christianity. That's a concept that has been produced by the false connection made by faulty interpretation of passages from the Old and New Testament, unrelated in context but used as prooftexts to justify political ambition. The idea that \"God sometimes uses evil men to achieve his purposes,\" is neither Christian, nor even biblical in any correctly discerned context of any part of the Bible.

The idea that \"God sometimes uses evil men to achieve his purposes,\" is neither Christian, nor even biblical in any correctly discerned context of any part of the Bible. Somewhere along the line, there are leaders within the church who have deceptively led their congregations to believe that the moral and social problems they perceive as existing within the United States are the result of political policy and government fiat. That's as patently false as the belief that electing the right President and government will fix it, and open the door to revival. Even if that were true, choosing a leader whose personal morality is as worldly and immoral as anything these people are complaining about happening in society would be counterproductive to any kind of revival of faith. In fact, looking at the shape most Evangelical churches and denominations find themselves in at this point, the support and loyalty they've given to this immoral, worldly, licentious imposter might just do the trick and extinguish their influence in this country for good. It's almost gone as it is. Membership losses and financial decline due to the exit of thousands of members over the past decade is taking a huge toll. They've thrown out the gospel and they've thrown Jesus under the bus.

    "text": "Case dismissed over plans to build new men's prison near Harrisburg\nA [Lincoln County](https://ujs.sd.gov/Circuit_Court/Default.aspx) judge dismissed a lawsuit over the [Department of Corrections’](https://doc.sd.gov/) plans to build a men’s prison near Harrisburg.\nAt the heart of the lawsuit is whether new state law trumps an existing local government’s law.\nThe suit was filed last year by the [Neighbors Opposed to Prison Expansion](https://nopelincoln.com/about/) – or NOPE – group and a few other individuals who own property adjacent to the proposed prison site. NOPE claimed the state needed to request a conditional use permit as required by [Lincoln County law](https://lincolncountysd.org/186/Planning-Zoning).\nThe Department of Corrections argued the state does not have to abide by local governmental law under [South Dakota’s constitutional right](https://sdsos.gov/2023SouthDakotaConstitution20220124.pdf) to sovereign immunity.\nThe DOC also argued that [House Bill 1017](https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24675) passed in March 2023 preempts the county’s zoning law.\n[HB 1017](https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24675) immediately appropriated funds to go towards the planning and construction of the new prison. In that law, the DOC was authorized to purchase land for the new site.\n[In October 2023](https://www.sdpb.org/news/2023-10-06/state-buys-land-for-prison-to-replace-sioux-falls-penitentiary) the DOC Secretary Kellie Wasko used the appropriated funding to buy state-owned land between Canton and Harrisburg for almost $8 million.\n[Circuit Court Judge Jennifer Mammenga](https://www.sdpb.org/news-and-information/2021-08-10/noem-appoints-mammenga-as-judge-for-south-dakotas-2nd-circuit-court) dismissed the case based on the grounds that Lincoln County’s zoning laws do not apply to the DOC.\n[Judge Mammenga wrote in her opinion](https://www.keloland.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/103/2024/10/41CIV23-000877_MEMORANDUM-DECISION.pdf) “a county by its very nature is a legislative creation, and therefore seemingly lacks authority to preempt state law.”\nShe also said the need for the creation of a new prison likely out balances the surrounding landowners’ interests.",

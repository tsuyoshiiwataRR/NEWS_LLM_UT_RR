    "text": "Mayor Eric Adams was welcomed at the New York Liberty’s championship parade with a rain of boos so intense it supposedly had to be drowned out with music. The Liberty on Thursday celebrated the franchise’s first-ever WNBA championship in its 27-year history. Although the decisive Game 5 on Sunday was the subject of great debate — mainly from Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve — that all went away amid the celebratory atmosphere of the parade. The parade route ended at the steps of New York City Hall, where a number of people gave remarks to the crowd. In addition to a dance routine from the Liberty mascot Ellie the Elephant, fans also heard from New York governor Kathy Hochul. While Hochul was met with a relatively positive reception, Adams was not so lucky. Multiple videos from the crowd captured clear boos as soon as Adams was introduced and his entrance music — Jay-Z’s song “Empire State of Mind” — started playing. According to at least one attendee, the volume of the music was actually raised in an effort to conceal the booing. Adams’ appearance at the parade is part of his continued effort to maintain some semblance of normalcy as he’s facing corruption charges. Have a tip for us?

This comes after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken failed to persuade Netanyahu to opt for a more moderate approach. Israeli security agencies have confirmed that the strike could happen within days, with the Israeli Air Force and missile defense systems readying for a potential Iranian response. The U.S. THAAD missile defense system has been deployed, particularly in southern Israel, to counter any ballistic missile threats from Iran. Concerns now center on possible Russian support for Iran in countering Israeli missiles, which could shield Tehran from a severe blow. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes continue across Lebanon, reaching as far as Beirut. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a conversation with his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant, expressed Washington's concern over Israeli strikes targeting the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL forces. On the ground, senior Israeli officers have revealed that five Israeli brigades are preparing for several weeks of battles in Lebanon in order to dismantle Hezbollah's infrastructure, particularly in villages along the frontline. In response, Hezbollah continues its rocket and drone attacks on northern Israel and as far as Tel Aviv, despite a media blackout on Israeli military casualties. Israeli Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi has insisted on maintaining the secrecy of military base locations to prevent Hezbollah from gaining tactical advantages.

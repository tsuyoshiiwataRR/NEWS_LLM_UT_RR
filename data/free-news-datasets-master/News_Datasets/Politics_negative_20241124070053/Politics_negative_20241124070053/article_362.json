    "text": "By Athlon College Football Writer ,\n1 hours ago\nIt's safe to say that the Lincoln Riley era at USC has not gone quite as planned for the Trojans.\nThrough three years in Los Angeles, Riley is 22-12, and in 2024, the team is struggling mightily with their change to the Big Ten Conference. After a 3-1 start to the season, the Trojans have dropped three consecutive games, losing to Minnesota, Penn State, and Maryland. To make matters worse, USC held leads in the 4th quarter of all of those games, but failed to close them out.\nAll of this has led to Trojans fans starting to get fed up with Riley and his tenure in Los Angeles, with many pointing to the fact that Clay Helton, the much-maligned coach the Riley replaced, had a better record through his first 34 games (24-10) than Riley does.\nWhile a lot of fans are frustrated, legendary USC quarterback Matt Leinart is trying to do his part to preach some patience.\nBrian Rothmuller&solGetty Images\n\"Let's try to have patience and trust that Lincoln and his staff will figure this out,\" Leinart wrote on X.\nThat pro-Lincoln Riley stance isn't going over so well on social media, though.\n\"Process my ass. With NIL and the portal, regression at USC is unacceptable,\" noted football analyst Mike Farrell replied .\n\"Matt's \"Dad\" TikToks are way better than his USC football takes,\" one fan wrote.\n\"Helton > Lincoln … this sounds and feels like the scott frost can’t win close games gonna get fired type team at usc,\" another said.\n\"You are a dreamer Matt, face reality, LR ain’t him … time to move on as you are invariably prolonging your disappointment,\" one more fan added .\nMore than just USC fans, though, there have been both Oregon fans and Oklahoma fans to chime in as well.\nIn his plea to Trojans fans, the former Heisman Trophy winner also noted that this is just the third year of Riley's tenure, and his first in the Big Ten, so he should be extended some grace. As is the case in college football fandom, though, this obviously opened the door for the Ducks to step in and talk some trash.\n\"I wonder how the other team that’s in year 3 with their coach and their first year in the B1G is doing? Let’s take a look in Eugene…\" one fan wrote, referring to Dan Lanning and his 29-5 record with the No. 1 Ducks.\n\"Denial stage of grief,\" said an Oklahoma fan.\nAfter coming into the 2024 season with expectations of competing for a spot in the Big Ten title game and maybe getting to the College Football Playoff, the Trojans are now in a spot where they have to win three of their next five games to even become bowl eligible.\nIt's not what fans were expecting, but if you ask Matt Leinart, there are brighter days ahead.\nRelated: Lincoln Riley Makes Definitive Decision On USC’s Quarterback Position Amid Struggles",

He posed.”\nMore From Post Editorial Board Don’t rush to end Gaza war, Dems’ blue-collar blues and other commentary Harris-Biden’s last-minute migrant moves are an attempt to hide their border mess Democracy danger alert! UK interfering in election to help Kamala Harris Memo to the left: Trump was not actually embarking on a new, fast-food career. He was: Staging. A. Photo-op. Lefties should order a McFlurry and chill out.\nThis excuse: “I speak honestly.” — Tim Walz, Monday\nWe say: Asked to explain his numerous falsehoods — such as that he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests or that he carried weapons of war in “war” — Walz gave one of his signature knucklehead excuses : He speaks “honestly.”\nWhen a Democrat tells a lie, you see, he’s speaking “honestly.” Get it? We don’t either.",

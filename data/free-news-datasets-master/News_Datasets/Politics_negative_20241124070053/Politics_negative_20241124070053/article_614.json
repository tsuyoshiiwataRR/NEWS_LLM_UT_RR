It is a very important piece of reporting - hope it stays visible for a while. It's believed that Navalny was poisoned with the nerve agent Novachok. he recovered from the attack in Germany, and was arrested almost immediately after he returned to Moscow. In the final moments of Navalny, Alexei gives a serious answer to the director's question about the risk he was taking. \"My message for the situation when I am killed is very simple, [to] not give up.\" A look at his memoir. In his posthumous memoir, Patriot, Navalny wrote - \"If they do finally whack me, the book will be my memorial.\" Though his voice has fallen silent, his wife Yulia Navalnaya is sharing his message. She now leads the movement her husband started, fighting Russian President Vladimir Putin's grip on power. She spoke with NPR's Ari Shapiro about her husband's book, and legacy. For Navalnaya, it's a look into him in his entirety; including his unshakeable sense of positivity. \"I think that it was a kind of his superpower,\" Navalnaya told Shapiro. \"That's why he was so popular. That's why people love him. That's why he had so many supporters. From one side, he was the leader of the Russian opposition. He was a serious politician.\" But as he shares in the book, Navalny also wanted to be the ordinary guy next door. \"He was really funny. It's not about the book. It's about all of his life. I spent more than 25 years with him, and all the time, he was very funny and he was very easy. And he laughed a lot during very difficult moments in our life. And it helped a lot and it gave him a lot of strength.\" Info View thread info, including edit history Trash Put this thread in your Trash Can (My DU » Trash Can) Bookmark Add this thread to your Bookmarks (My DU » Bookmarks) 0 replies, 22 views Share Get links to this post and/or share on social media Alert Alert this post for a rule violation Powers There are no powers you can use on this post Edit Cannot edit other people's posts Reply Reply to this post Edit Cannot edit other people's posts Rec (1) Reply Reply to this post Reply to this discussion https://pmatep5f7b.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ProdStage Latest Discussions » General Discussion » Even in death, Alexei Nav...

    "text": "The Popular Party has accused the Government and, specifically, the minority party of Pedro Sánchez’s Executive, Sumar, of covering up Iñigo Errejón after his resignation this Thursday amid suspicions of sexist behavior. Those of Alberto Núñez Feijóo have shown their “rejection” at what they consider “to be the real reasons” that have forced Sumar’s until now spokesperson in Congress to abandon politics.\n«It seems that it was an open secret in all areas of the left. “They knew it, they covered it up, they consented to it.” Thus, in a video message, the deputy secretary of Mobilization and Digital Challenge of the PP, Noelia Núñez, has accused the minority party of the Government of covering up Errejón, a criticism that she also extends to the rest of the leftist formations, which she has also criticized for his “hypocrisy” after an anonymous testimony accusing sexist violence.\nThe popular people have demanded that the second vice president of the Government and current leader of Sumar, Yolanda Díaz, explain these alleged events and that, if anyone else collaborated in covering them up, they be removed from office. “Now we understand that they did not make him a minister at the time, but Mrs. Díaz did reward him with the spokesperson for her parliamentary group,” Núñez reproached.\nThe criticism of the PP deputy has not been limited to Sumar, but she has rebuked the entire Government by discrediting its “hypocritical feminism”, in the words of Núñez: “From Pedro Sánchez with Ábalos and now from Yolanda Díaz with Errejón.” They consider in the Popular Party that “if the aggressor is from the left, everything is covered up”, reiterating their “rejection” to those who, either actively or passively, allegedly collaborated in covering up the founder of Podemos.\n“The Government that began with a pact of losers continues with a pact of concealers,” the popular deputy concluded.\n#accuses #Sumar #covering #Errejón #asks #Yolanda #Díaz #explanations #knew #consented",

    "text": "[PR Newswire](/news/pr-newswire) BMBL Investors Have Opportunity to Lead Bumble Inc. Securities Fraud Lawsuit BMBL Investors Have Opportunity to Lead Bumble Inc. Securities Fraud Lawsuit PR Newswire NEW YORK, Oct. 24, 2024 NEW YORK, Oct. 24, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Why: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Bumble Inc. (NASDAQ: BMBL) between November 7, 2023 and August 7, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), of the important November 25, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline. So what: If you purchased Bumble securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. What to do next: To join the Bumble class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=3076 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [case@rosenlegal.com](mailto:case@rosenlegal.com) for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than November 25, 2024. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Bumble's projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth on the back of its tiered-subscription options and subsequent app relaunch, while also downplaying the potential disruption to Bumble's brand and reputation caused by the imminent change in leadership. In truth, Bumble's Premium Plus subscription plan did not have a clear market fit and would very quickly need to be revamped. Bumble's tiered-subscription options were ill equipped to provide the claimed revenue per user benefit to Bumble's faltering market share, particularly regarding user growth and monetization. Defendants misled investors by providing the public with materially flawed statements of confidence and growth projections which did not account for these variables. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Bumble class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=3076 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [case@rosenlegal.com](mailto:case@rosenlegal.com) for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

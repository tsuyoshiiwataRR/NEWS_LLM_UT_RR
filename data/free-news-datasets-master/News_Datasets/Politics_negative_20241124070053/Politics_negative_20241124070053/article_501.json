    "text": "ALBANY, Ga. (WALB) - A jury has come to a verdict in a trial of a former Monroe Comprehensive High School administrator accused of sexual assault and child molestation. On Thursday, Oct. 24, former Monroe Comprehensive High School Assistant Principal Horace Bentley was found guilty of sexual assault on a student and not guilty of child molestation. This verdict comes following his 2017 arrest after a cell phone video and allegation surfaced of Bentley reportedly touching a male student under 16-year-old inappropriately. WALB previously reported that other allegations were made by students as far back as 2014. Sentencing was deferred as Bentley has a pending trial in Upson County. His defense attorney told the court on Thursday that they will be prepared for sentencing in the next week or two. “This defendant had been engaging in conduct in both Dougherty County and in Upson County, Thomaston, Georgia, where he faces that charge even now,” Dougherty County District Attorney Greg Edwards said. “So with that additional evidence, on top of the evidence that was presented from the victim, we believe the evidence was pretty overwhelming and solid for the jury and that they reached the appropriate verdict.” He will be held in custody pending his sentencing date. “It is critical that number one these things are maintained making sure that are children are protected, and making sure that the integrity of our educators is protected as well,” Edwards said. “We don’t want one bad apple so to speak to spoil the integrity of our educators.” Watch the jury return their verdict in the courtroom.

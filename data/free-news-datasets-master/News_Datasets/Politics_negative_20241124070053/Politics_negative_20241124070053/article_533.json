    "text": "Letter to the editor: Election help needed in Pennsylvania Oct 24, 2024 | Op/Ed\nOp/Ed Letter to the editor: Election help needed in Pennsylvania October 24, 2024 By Lise Anderson Voter turnout in the Philadelphia area is crucial to winning Pennsylvania for Democrats and for preserving democracy. Swing Blue Alliance Pennsylvania needs more boots on the ground right now. So, this week, if you want to make a difference, consider traveling to Philadelphia.\nLast week Abi Sessions, Carolyn Craven and I went from Middlebury to Bucks County, Pa., to help Swing Blue Alliance register voters, inform voters about early voting locations, and canvas for local Democrats up and down the ballot. One day we took the train into South Philly and told passersby about the city’s new satellite polling stations. It was very rewarding!\nThere were volunteers from Massachusetts and Vermont, folks from California and as far away as Wales, UK, but they need more folks to come.\nDon’t wait for election day. Early voting is happening now. You can have a travel adventure and make a difference (it’s a pretty 6–7-hour drive)! Sign up for at least three days; they prefer five+ to perfect your skills. (We found that to be true.) Organizers can help arrange your housing, or you can stay with supportive old friends, like we did.\nYour presence can make a big difference in the outcome in Pennsylvania. As David Plouffe, Obama’s former campaign director says, “more than at any other time in any campaign: doors matter!”\nUse one of these links to sign up:\nPhiladelphia or Bucks County\nLise Anderson\nCornwall\nShare this story: This article’s tags:\nLetter to the editor , Lise Anderson , elections More News Op/Ed Editorial: Ask questions before you cast ballots What’s interesting in the state’s House and Senate races this year is that most candidates … (read more)\nOp/Ed Community Forum: Conservation vital to our health In the natural world I find hope and a deep understanding that life will go on regardless … (read more)\nOp/Ed Ways of Seeing: Guidelines for hope in tough times When I was young, my parents insisted that I take piano lessons at Westminster Choir Colle … (read more)\nShare this story:",

    "text": "The alleged ex-girlfriend of Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff has come forward accusing him of slapping her across the face, according to a report released Thursday. Speaking with the Daily Mail, the woman, who has reportedly chosen to remain anonymous, contended that the outlet’s prior reporting about the incident in question is true. As The Federalist’s Tristan Justice previously noted , three friends of the alleged victim claimed to the Daily Mail that Emhoff — the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris — “struck the woman named under the pseudonym ‘Jane’ following a glitzy night out at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival in France.” The alleged victim’s friends also provided photos, “other documents and communications corroborating elements of the story,” according to the outlet . Described by the Daily Mail as a “successful New York attorney,” the accuser reportedly did not want to go on the record at the time the outlet published its first story on the alleged incident. According to the Daily Mail, she changed her mind after witnessing Emhoff’s “alleged hypocrisy by claiming to be a feminist in media interviews, [which] finally became too much for her.” “What’s frightening for a woman that’s been on the other end of it, is watching this completely fabricated persona being portrayed,” she said. “He’s being held out to be the antithesis of who he actually is. And that is utterly shocking.” Emhoff is a central figure in his wife’s presidential campaign, and legacy media have attempted to cast him as a model of masculinity and a champion of women. The second gentleman has yet to directly deny the allegations made against him. While he https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13898791/Kamala-Harris-husband-Doug-Emhoff-accused-ex-girlfriend-slap.html didn’t respond to the Daily Mail’s request for comment on its initial story, an Emhoff spokesman told Semafor , “this report is untrue” and “any suggestion that he would or has ever hit a woman is false.” The claims were subtly touched upon during Emhoff’s recent MSNBC interview , in which network host Joe Scarborough indirectly classified the Daily Mail’s reporting as “misinformation” that’s being promoted by Donald Trump. Harris’ husband agreed, calling it a “distraction.” Speaking with the Daily Mail, the New York attorney expressed outrage at the lack of media coverage of reports that Emhoff impregnated his daughter’s nanny at the time he was married to his now-ex-wife. The second gentleman previously confirmed his infidelity, although it is unclear if the alleged child was killed via abortion, given up for adoption, or lost as the result of a miscarriage. “I’ve been telling this story to my friends. And I kept saying, this is a big deal, why doesn’t anybody in the media care? And apparently nobody did,” she said. “Not a single reporter has directly asked Doug about these allegations.” The ex-girlfriend denied her allegations are politically motivated, contending she and her husband are registered Democrats and previously voted for and donated to Joe Biden during the 2020 election. The Daily Mail “obtained Federal Election Commission records evidencing the donations, and voter registrations showing the couple’s previous registration as Democrats,” according to the outlet.",

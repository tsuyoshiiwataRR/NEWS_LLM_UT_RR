    "text": "While the UN General Assembly resolution reflects a significant moment in international politics, it also uncovers the hypocrisy that often accompanies such discussions. By DANIEL YAKCOBI OCTOBER 24, 2024 11:57 Israeli ambassador to the UN Danny Danon shows a photo of a Hamas tunnel in Gaza, on September 17, 2024. (photo credit: Eskinder Debebe/UN)\nIn a significant move on September 18, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling for the Old City of Jerusalem to become Jew-free as part of a broader agenda aimed at addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The resolution, which passed with a vote of 124 in favor, 14 against, and 43 abstentions, has sparked considerable debate and criticism, raising questions about the United Nations’ role and authority in a matter deeply rooted in historical, religious, and cultural significance.\nThe resolution, drafted by the Palestinian Authority, demands that Israel “brings to an end without delay its unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory... and do so no later than 12 months,” as well as “comply without delay with all its legal obligations under international law.”\nDanny Danon , Israel’s ambassador to the UN, called it “a shameful decision that backs the Palestinian Authority’s diplomatic terrorism,” saying the General Assembly “continues to dance to the music of the Palestinian Authority, which backs the Hamas murderers.” What sparked the UN General Assembly resolution on Jerusalem?\nThe impetus behind this resolution can be traced back to a July advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice , which deemed Israeli presence in territories occupied after the 1949 armistice line as illegal. By calling for the complete withdrawal of Israeli Defense Forces from Judea and Samaria, east Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip within a year, the resolution seeks to enforce this advisory opinion, effectively pushing for the evacuation of thriving Jewish communities, including those in Jerusalem’s Old City.\nHowever, this resolution exhibits a stark hypocrisy. The UN has frequently condemned Israel, while appearing to turn a blind eye to provocations and violent acts stemming from Palestinian territories. Advocates argue that such resolutions only serve to undermine stability and peace in the region rather than foster cooperation and understanding. The disproportionate focus on Israel raises concerns about bias, leading many to question the fairness of the UN’s stance.\nAdding to the complexity of this situation is the broader theological belief among many Jewish people that ultimate authority over Jerusalem transcends international politics. Many Jews and supporters of Israel hold the perspective that the UN’s resolutions hold no real power over the city, as they believe divine sovereignty supersedes human governance. This sentiment is echoed in foundational Jewish texts, including Genesis, which asserts that God has the ultimate control over the land.\nIndeed, as the scripture reflects, “God gives, God takes, and God gives back.” The belief is that divine providence has a hand in the existence and resilience of Israel, and that spiritual focus should take precedence over the resolutions of any international body. In this regard, many find solace and strength in biblical promises, such as those found in Amos 9:14-15, where the Lord declares that He will firmly plant His people in their land, and they will never be uprooted again.\nThis call to redirect focus away from the UN and toward faith and spiritual fulfillment resonates with those who believe that true change will only come from a higher authority rather than through political maneuvering. The sentiment suggests that by concentrating on faith and unity among believers, a more profound and lasting peace can be achieved.\nIn conclusion, while the UN General Assembly resolution reflects a significant moment in international politics, it also uncovers the hypocrisy that often accompanies such discussions. It raises crucial questions about the efficacy and fairness of international governance in matters that touch on deeply held beliefs. The future of Jerusalem and Israel remains a complex and multifaceted issue, one that is as deeply spiritual as it is political. The resolution serves as a reminder that while political dialogues continue, there exists a vibrant and enduring connection to the land that transcends diplomatic decisions. To many, it is a time to raise spiritual awareness, place faith above politics, and seek everlasting peace through divine, rather than human, decree.■\nDaniel Yakcobi, born in Jerusalem and raised in the kibbutz community of Sde Eliyahu, has lived in South Africa for the past 12 years with his wife, Natasha, and their three children.

    "text": "Íñigo Errejón has resigned this Thursday, October 24, through a statement on X, formerly Twitter, after two thirty in the afternoon. Sumar’s until then spokesperson in Congress thus leaves his seat in the Congress of Deputies and retires from politics.\nIn the statement, the politician indicates having reached “the limit of the contradiction between the character and the person. Between a neoliberal way of life and being a spokesperson for a formation that defends a new world. Furthermore, he has alluded to “patriarchy” and «psychological support process» in which he has been immersed for “some time”.\nAt the moment Sumar has communicated that a information gathering process about some rumors that had emerged about Errejón’s sexist behavior with some girls, most of them spread through social networks.\n«I announce thus, as I have already communicated to my colleagues in charge, my resignation as spokesperson for the Plurinational Parliamentary Group of Sumar, I leave the seat in Congress and all my political responsibilities,” explained the former deputy on his Twitter account.\nAfter his resignation, it remains to be seen what the suspicions about the former deputy take shape, of whom we review his personal and private career since he entered the political arena.\nÍñigo Errejón and some controversial beginnings in politics\nBorn in Madrid on December 14, 40 years ago, Errejón has a doctorate in Political Sciences from the Complutense University of Madrid. Errejón was one of the best-known faces of the 15M movement and one of the few who had resisted until now in politics.\nHe was one of the founders of Podemos and managed to become a deputy in Congress and later move away from the purple formation. He moved to Manuela Carmen’s Más Madrid, which later became Más País, a party with which he was also a deputy.\nIn the 2023 elections, the Errejón party joined an electoral coalition with Add . He was again elected as a deputy and became spokesperson in the plenary session for said party since January of this year.\nThroughout this career of more than a decade in politics, there have been several controversies that have surrounded the political scientist. One was known as the ‘black scholarship’, that the politician would have received from the University of Malaga, for which he received 1,800 euros per month without going to school and carrying out work lacking solid research. He was filed and disqualified.\nAnother of his most notable controversies was related to an incident for which he was accused of having kicked you in the stomach to a man in May 2021 in Lavapiés (Madrid). The plaintiff claimed that, when jokingly asking the politician for a photo, he kicked him.\nErrejón denied these accusations and stated that the man was very insistent and annoying, that he grabbed him by the neck to pose for a ‘selfie’, so he got rid of him without any type of aggression. After going through trial, Justice acquitted Errejón .\nRelationship with Rita Maestre and other relationships\nRegarding his personal life, there is no evidence that he maintains any romantic relationship formal today. However, in his past some have transcended, such as those he has had with colleagues in the world of politics.\nThe most striking was Rita Maestre now councilor of the Madrid City Council with Más Madrid. It is said that they had an affair with her for several years, since they began the relationship in 2011 and ended it in 2015, after many comings and goings. One of the proofs were the words that Errejón dedicated to her in his thesis: «Rita knows by heart, despite herself, this thesis, the reflections, questions and hours that are behind this work. I would say that it has the unparalleled merit of having endured me in times of anxiety and, perhaps even more so, in times of good wind. However, that happens in the course of sharing the days in handfuls, like desire, war and hands. AND that would be irreplaceable to me », according to ‘La Razón’.\nAfter this long courtship, Errejón began a new relationship, this time with LaSexta journalist, Glòria Mena whom he met in 2015 but whose romance did not become official until 2019, the year in which they could be seen together on a romantic getaway outside of Madrid. Love also ended in this case and the last girlfriend that the politician would have known would be Mireia Vehí, a CUP deputy in Barcelona, ​​although they would also have ended a romantic relationship in 2023 that was never confirmed.\nThe ‘political divorce’ of Pablo Iglesias\nThe year 2019 It should have been a celebration for Podemos, a party founded, among others, by Pablo Iglesias and Íñigo Errejón, because it was celebrating five years since its inclusion in the Spanish political landscape. However, during the months before the people of Madrid chose their new president, a bucket of cold water fell on the purple formation.\nPablo Iglesias was Podemos’s main candidate to occupy the presidency of the Community of Madrid but, by surprise for him and the majority of his party, your trusted man Íñigo Errejón, gave him a ‘stab’ in the back, by running with Manuela Carmen’s platform for the regional elections and leaving Podemos and, therefore, Iglesias behind. This represented an unprecedented schism, in which Errejón proposed that Podemos, IU and Equo be integrated into his list with Más Madrid, something they did not consider and, in the end, competed among themselves.\nWith what happened, as told by ABC Iglesias shared a statement in which He admitted feeling “touched” and “sad” for Errejón’s decision to start a “new personal political project” together with the then mayor of Madrid, Manuela Carmena, also regretting that they hid it from him, something that he implied was a betrayal:\n«I can’t believe that Manuela and Íñigo they have hidden us who were preparing to launch their own electoral project for the Community of Madrid and who announced it by surprise. “I think our registrants deserve more respect,” wrote Pablo Iglesias, who also resigned and walked away from politics in May 2021.\n#personal #life #Íñigo #Errejón #controversies #relationship #Rita #Maestre #political #divorce #Pablo #Iglesias",

    "text": "Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson riled up the crowd at a Georgia rally for former President Donald Trump Wednesday with an unusual metaphor. The long-divisive conservative political commentator compared Trump to a “pissed” father. He said in the case Trump is reelected on Nov. 5. and returns to the White House next year, it will be as if he is coming home to punish his misbehaving daughter, the country. “He’s not vengeful. He loves his children, disobedient as they may be,” Carlson said. “When dad comes home, you know what he says? ‘You’ve been a bad girl. You’ve been a bad little girl and you’re getting a vigorous spanking right now.’” More: Election 2024 live updates: Trump, Harris close in swing state polls; Beyoncé joins Harris He also said that, when the country is led by Democrats, it's like a child allowed to “smear the contents of his diapers on the wall of your living room,” or a “hormone-addled 15-year-old daughter” who makes rude gestures at her parents. Carlson’s comments quickly drew criticism online from Democrats. Former White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield responded to a clip of Carlson's metaphor on X writing , \"what the actual...\" and James Singer, a spokesperson for the Kamala Harris campaign, called Carlson's comments \"weird\" using an expletive. Later, when Trump took the stage at the Duluth campaign stop, members of the audience chanted “Daddy’s home.” Trump used the appearance as an opportunity to celebrate the state's record early voter turnout and its potential swing-state impact. As the host of “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Fox News, Carlson was one of the network's biggest stars. The show was canceled last year following a series of controversies . Carlson drove ratings at the network but, his critics say he pushed extreme right-wing views and trafficked in racist and misogynistic themes and conspiracy theories.

    "text": "(Oct. 24, 2024) — On Tuesday a video was uploaded to Rumble by “The Liberty Daily” depicting an apparent computer graphics technician detailing how he found the “long-form” birth certificate image posted by the Obama White House in 2011 to be a forgery, echoing the findings of then-Maricopa County, AZ Sheriff Joseph Arpaio and his lead investigator on the case, Mike Zullo.\nVarious commenters to the video remarked it was “old news” but nevertheless important even nearly eight years after Zullo’s investigation, begun in August 2011 with Arpaio’s authorization, concluded, reinforcing its original findings that the image posted at whitehouse.gov on April 27, 2011 is a “computer-generated forgery.”\n“I’m a professional designer…” the speaker in the video states. “I do this all the time. I’ve done photo editings; this is insane…I gotta show you this.”\n“I’m downloading it right now…I’ve done this a few times now at this point…I can’t even believe this is real,” he said, proceeding to open the image in (Adobe) Illustrator.\n“There’s bounding boxes on here, so you can delete the bounding boxes in Illustrator, and if you delete them, you can move the entire background document off of the page, and you can literally separate it, and you can see that this is the original document with the original text on it, that this has been completely photo-edited and they put this ghosting effect on here…I can’t even believe this…even the background’s been edited…,” he said. “This is from the White House’s website!”",

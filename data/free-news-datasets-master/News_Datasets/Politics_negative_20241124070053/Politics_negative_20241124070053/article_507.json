    "text": "Society WATCH: For Protesting Rickey Williams, the husband of pro-life activist Bevelyn Beatty Williams, posted a chilling and heartbreaking video statement before his wife surrendered to federal prison. Williams was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in federal prison for peacefully protesting outside a New York City abortion clinic. Williams is one of several peaceful protesters who has been sentenced to multiple years in federal prison for violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act. The Biden Department of Justice has been aggressively pursuing FACE Act cases against pro-life protesters, resulting in multiple federal prison sentences. (FOCUS GROUP: Do You Blame KAMALA or TRUMP for record inflation?) In one instance, 75-year-old Paulette Harlow was sentenced to 24 months in prison for protesting inside a D.C. abortion clinic. When her husband asked the court for probation due to his wife’s advanced age — stating that she may die in prison — U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said, “maybe you should make an effort to remain alive because that is a tenet of your religion.” Last week, Williams uploaded a chilling video to her TikTok account before serving a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence for protesting outside a building. “So right now, I’m about to drive my wife to a federal facility. She has to surrender herself there. And this is due to the Harris-Biden administration,” Rickey began. “And any husband in this country, anyone that’s married, knows, any mother, any father, knows from your loved one, separation from a mother and a daughter at two years old is traumatic and no person, no American citizen should have to experience this in this country.” He then took aim at the Democratic Party’s rhetoric on criminal justice reform, namely former President Barack Obama. “When Kamala Harris’ administration is separating me from my wife and my wife from her daughter at two years old for unlawful assembly. My wife is facing three and a half years for unlawful assembly and federal time y’all, okay? Federal time,” Williams continued. “And it’s devastating for our family, but we’re going to get through this. But I want people to know in this country, mothers, fathers, single fathers, single mothers, that this cannot be tolerated and you should not vote for Kamala, because voting for Kamala will do things like this. Alright? It’s unacceptable.” Williams, a Tennessee native, was sentenced to a lengthy federal prison term for preaching the gospel outside an NYC abortion clinic. Federal prosecutors further accused her of injuring a clinic employee’s hand and blocking the entrance. “I was persecuted as a Christian standing for my beliefs when it comes to life,” reads a statement from Williams on her fundraising page. “This is devastating news. Not only is this bond extensive for the accused crime, but she made it very clear in the courtroom that she was going to make an example out of me.” (CHAOS: Costco Sells Out Of Gold Bars As Economic Uncertainty Grips Markets)",

    "text": "Jennifer Lopez’s first husband, Ojani Noa, has sparked controversy by claiming she attended Sean “Diddy” Combs’ notorious “ freak-off” parties during their relationship. Noa made the allegations through a now-viral Instagram post, distancing himself from the parties while implicating Lopez, his ex-wife.\n“I’M NOT ON THE LIST,” Noa emphasized in his post. He added, “To those people and media outlets asking if I ever went or participated in that Piece of Sh*t (DIDDY’S) Freak-Off Parties. No and No. Never. But my Ex-Wife (Jennifer Lopez) a.k.a (JLO) Did… Ask Her.” He also urged people to question Lopez about alleged explicit recordings, writing, “Oh, and ask her about the SEX TAPES…”\nNoa’s comments come as Combs faces multiple lawsuits related to sexual misconduct and accusations that his infamous parties involved numerous high-profile celebrities.\nOjani Noa Speaks Out In an interview with Univision’s Despierta América , Noa expanded on his Instagram post. “First of all, I’m not accusing anyone, let’s clear the air,” he said, clarifying that he simply wanted people to stop asking him about his involvement in Combs’ events. Noa also stressed that while he was never part of the parties, he believes Lopez was present. “I didn’t go to any party, but she did go to the parties,” he added.\nNoa and Lopez were married in 1997 but divorced within a year. He partly blames their split on her relationship with Combs, whom she began dating while working on her debut album, On the 6 . “When Diddy got involved, that’s where the separation began,” Noa stated. He revealed that while Lopez’s career was taking off, he felt their relationship was deteriorating due to her increasing professional and personal closeness with Combs.\nJennifer Lopez Silence Lopez has not publicly responded to Noa’s claims. The singer and actress, now married to actor Ben Affleck, has been known to guard her personal life carefully. Meanwhile, Noa continues to express his frustration over the fallout from their brief marriage. “To tell the truth, to talk about everything that happened in the past,” he said, would be his request if they ever met again.",

Prosecutors must now seek court approval.\nLyle Menendez, then 21, and Erik Menendez, then 18, admitted they fatally shot their entertainment executive father Jose Menendez and their mother Kitty Menendez.\nThe brothers said they feared their parents were about to kill them to prevent the disclosure of their father’s long-time sexual molestation of Erik Menendez.\nPA Media Media gather for a news conference being held by Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon PA Media The brothers’ extended family has pleaded for their release, saying they deserve to be free after decades behind bars.\nSeveral family members have said that in today’s world — which is more aware of the impact of sexual abuse — the brothers would not have been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life.\nThe Menendez brothers were tried twice for their parents’ murders, with the first trial ending in a hung jury.\nProsecutors at the time contended that there was no evidence of molestation and many details in their story of sexual abuse were not permitted in the second trial.\nThe district attorney’s office also said at the time that the brothers were after their parents’ multimillion-dollar estate.\nThe case has gained new traction in recent weeks after Netflix began streaming the true-crime drama Monsters: The Lyle And Erik Menendez Story.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country\nFollow STV News\nFollow STV News on WhatsApp Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country\nPosted in Crime World News",

    "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris is a wizard when it comes to the bob-and-weave approach. Her interviews and appearances are charming, but they demonstrate her way of bobbing and weaving around the questions and statements made for her to answer. She is extremely evasive when required to answer any inquiry. Kamala is running a tight race with former President Donald J. Trump and is evasive to answer any inquiries about how to secure America. Does Kamala really know how to do so? I do not believe she has given too much attention to that subject. She does not state how she would plan to maintain and grow our military might throughout the world and within our own nation. She does not mention what her intentions are to ensure that America is the strongest military in the world. Of course, we must take into consideration her vice presidential candidate, Tim Walz, who has extremely strong compliance with China. China is a very competitive military nation and continues to strengthen its military forces. Kamala is definitely the queen of the bob and weave. She is an expert at evading any questions that she has no interest in whatsoever. She will not end her bob-and-weave practices, and America will definitely suffer the consequences. Vote Trump!

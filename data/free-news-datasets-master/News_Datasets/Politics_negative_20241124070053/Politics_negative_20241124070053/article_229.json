    "text": "Chris Russo stopped himself at first before deciding to go for it.\nRusso has poured cold water on the idea that the public cares as much as the sports media does about Bronny James taking the court alongside his father LeBron for the Lakers on Tuesday night and said his son Colin is a better radio host than Bronny is a basketball player.\nThursday, the Mad Dog appeared on the “Dan Patrick Show” and was asked if he’d ever tell SiriusXM management he’d like to do a show with his son.\n“Well, I wouldn’t say that. But I understand what your point is. I wouldn’t say that because these jobs are very difficult to get and I think that that advantage for him would be unfair. So I would not tell bosses, ‘Hey, do me a favor, make sure Colin Russo gets on Sirius and does a once-a-week show with me,” Russo answered.\n4 Chris Russo (l.) and his son Colin Russo (r.) on the air together.

Smith on ESPN’s “First Take,” initially thought better about what he was going to say next but got coaxed into it by Patrick.\n“I’ll say this right now … well, I won’t say that because that will get me in trouble,” Russo said as Patrick chuckled.\n“Your wife’s out of town. You can’t get in trouble,” Patrick said, having a good idea of what Russo was about to say.\nRusso took the bait.\n4 Chris Russo (l.) with his son Colin Russo (r.)

Colin, from a radio perspective, he is better at what he does right now than Bronny at what he does. How’s that? I’ll say that with all sorts of confidence,” Russo said.\nBronny James played under three minutes on Tuesday night, and it remains to be seen if/when he will return to the court for the Lakers.",

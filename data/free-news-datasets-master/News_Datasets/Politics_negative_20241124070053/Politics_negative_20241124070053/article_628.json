    "text": "• Party vows to reconnect with public, strengthen grassroots presence • Preparing for upcoming elections with ‘renewed vigour’ Srinagar, Oct 24: People’s Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti on Thursday chaired a meeting of senior leaders here to review the party’s dismal performance in the recently concluded Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections and to strategise future actions. The party spokesperson said the principles and ideas on which the PDP was founded remain highly relevant. “We consider these principles the most appropriate remedy for the problems faced by Jammu and Kashmir. At the core of our mission is dialogue, and the current pervasive situation demands addressing the root cause,” he said. Regardless of electoral outcomes, the PDP has an essential role to play, he said, adding, “We will continue raising issues concerning the people and extend support to the government wherever our voice can contribute to securing the constitutional rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.” The PDP spokesperson said the party will draft detailed proposals to strengthen its grassroots presence and reconnect with the public. He further noted that the PDP is willing to support any party that shares its mission of safeguarding public rights. “Despite sustained assaults on the PDP, including a mass exodus of leaders, MLAs, and MLCs, this election has demonstrated that the PDP is here to stay,” he said. “We are committed to rebuilding, addressing our weaknesses from the recent polls, and expanding our worker base to ensure effective voter mobilisation in future elections.” During the meeting, the party said it is preparing for the upcoming municipal, panchayat and District Development Council (DDC) elections with “renewed vigour”. “Our well-structured grassroots network will be activated in line with the political vision of our founder, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed,” the spokesperson said. The PDP also highlighted the potential of its younger members, many of whom have left established careers to join politics. “These young talents are crucial to the party’s future, and their political skills will be honed under the guidance of senior leaders,” he said. During the meeting, the party leadership reiterated its historical commitment to providing a credible democratic alternative. “The achievements of our brief tenures under Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Mehbooba Mufti—particularly in connectivity, opening routes across the Line of Control, education and health—continue to benefit the public. We will carry forward this legacy,” the party said. Recently elected MLAs – Mir Mohammad Fayaz, Waheed ur Rehman Para, Rafeeq Ahmed Naik – and all contesting candidates in recent elections attended the meeting. Senior leaders included Abdul Rehman Veeri, Dr Mehboob Beg, Sartaj Madni, Ghulam Nabi Lone Hanjura, Aseia Naqash, Zahoor Ahmad Mir, Sardar Amreek Singh Reen, Ab Gaffar Sofi, Adv Abdul Haq Khan and Imtiyaz Ahmad Shan and Khursheed Alam.",

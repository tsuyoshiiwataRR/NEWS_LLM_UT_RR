Dare Glintstone Akinniyi, Spokesperson of the Peoples Democratic Party ([PDP](https://www.legit.ng/tags/pdp-news-today/)) National Youth Group, criticized President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's cabinet reshuffle announced on Wednesday, October 23. Recall that in a decisive move, President Bola [Tinubu sacked five ministers ](https://www.legit.ng/nigeria/1620988-breaking-tinubu-sacks-ministers-scraps-merges-ministries/)and reassigned ten others after a thorough performance review. PDP chieftain criticises Tinubu for retaining Wike, other ministers In an exclusive interview with Legit.ng on Thursday, October 24, Akinniyi queried [Tinubu's decision to retain Nyesom Wike](https://www.legit.ng/politics/1621012-cabinet-reshuffle-full-list-ministers-retained-positions-portfolios/), the minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), and [David Umahi](https://www.legit.ng/tags/david-umahi/), the Minister of Works.

Speaking further, he also criticised President Tinubu's appointment of seven new ministers, describing it as a mere joke. The [PDP](https://www.legit.ng/tags/pdp-news-today/) chieftain said: \"A critical assessment of the cabinet's new members and ousted officials reveals a lack of exceptionalism among the newly appointed. \"Their selection appears to be a tactical move to placate influential quarters in the lead-up to 2027, favoring political pragmatism over proficiency. \"President Tinubu appointed two former Ministers under President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, which makes the new appointments a mere joke to me. It's clear that Bola Tinubu led APC government is confused and incompetent. \"It is surprising that the Blue Economy, Economy, Power, Works and FCT Ministers still hold their positions.\" Read more about cabinet reshuffle here: [Buhari’s ex-aide hints at Tinubu’s move to sack more ministers, “second batch shake-up”](https://www.legit.ng/politics/1621262-cabinet-reshuffle-buharis-aide-hints-tinubus-second-batch-shake/)[Nigerians react as Tinubu appoints Bianca Ojukwu: “She is a core Biafra”](https://www.legit.ng/politics/1621059-nigerians-react-tinubu-appoints-bianca-ojukwu-a-core-biafra/)[Presidency explains why Matawalle wasn't sacked amid terrorism allegations](https://www.legit.ng/nigeria/1621187-cabinet-shake-presidency-opens-matawalle-sacked/)[Tinubu told to scrap Marine Ministry](https://www.legit.ng/nigeria/1621095-cabinet-reshuffle-heads-roll-president-tinubu-cracks-underperformance/) Power minister hails Tinubu for cabinet reshuffle Earlier, [Legit.ng reported](https://www.legit.ng/politics/1621222-cabinet-reshuffle-power-minister-reacts-tinubu-7-fresh-nominations/) that the Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, commended President [Tinubu](https://www.legit.ng/tags/bola-tinubu/) over the appointment of seven new ministers.

    "text": "COLUMBUS, OH —Today, Americans for Prosperity-Ohio (AFP-OH) announced opposition to Ohio Issue 1. The drawing of state lines should be a function of officials who are chosen by the voters–not an unaccountable group of fifteen unelected individuals. Should Issue 1 become enshrined in Ohio’s Constitution, voters will lose their ability to hold those who draw district lines accountable, creating an unchecked bureaucracy with unlimited spending.\nAFP-OH State Director Donovan O’Neil released the following statement:\n“Today, Ohioans can hold the legislators who draw district lines accountable at the ballot box. But if Issue 1 passes, Ohioans will lose this opportunity, and the power will be placed in the hands of unelected individuals who are not directly accountable to voters in the Buckeye State.\n“Americans for Prosperity-Ohio is committed to championing common-sense policies that protect freedom and prosperity. Issue 1 runs contrary to the values that we fight for so vigorously. Unelected bureaucrats with little oversight have no business drawing Ohio’s district lines, and we will continue to fight to protect Ohioans’ right to hold those in power accountable.”",

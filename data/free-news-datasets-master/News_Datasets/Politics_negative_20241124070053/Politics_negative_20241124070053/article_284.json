The witness testified last week and his cross-examination began but was put on hold until his return to the stand on Thursday.\nThe witness previously said he and five others went to Logan Lane to rob Leger and his girlfriend, Chantal Boudreau. He told the jury Thursday they had heard there might be more than $30,000 in the home.\nThe witness said last week that Phillips was the only one to enter the house and he heard several gunshots before seeing Phillips jump down the stairs and run out of the house.\nThe young offender told the court he heard a .22-calibre gun fire, then the sound of louder gunshots. He had testified Phillips was carrying a .38-calibre revolver and told the group after the shooting that he was shot in the hand but put four shots in Leger. Police seized a .22-calibre homemade gun from Leger’s home and the jury has watched videos of him firing it and playing with it on different occasions.\nDefence lawyer Brian Munro asked the witness if shooting Leger was part of the plan.\n“You didn’t intend to shoot anybody that night?” he asked, to which the witness said no.\nThe witness told the jury he didn’t even know Leger, that he had just heard his name in the days before the shooting. During cross-examination he said he had heard Leger was “going around robbing people” that “I was told he put a gun to somebody’s head.”\nMorning Email Times & Transcript A clear and concise roundup to start your weekday morning.\nThere was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Article content\nThese answers prompted a caution by the judge that the information is hearsay and the witness only heard those things.\nMunro asked the witness about several statements he gave to police and the fact his story evolved over time, with more detail provided. He asked the witness if he was lying but the young offender answered that he was holding back information at first.\n“I was still on the fence about being a snitch,” the witness said.\nWhen prosecutor Stephen Holt later asked him to elaborate on that comment, the witness said he was on the fence about providing information and helping police. He said he grew up being told you don’t “rat.”\n“I know what you mean, but what is a ‘rat,'” asked Holt.\n“Exactly what I’m doing right now,” said the young offender.\nHe said he only decided to tell police the full story after talking to his family.\n“I wanted to do the right thing,” he said. “I felt guilty that I was involved in a very serious offence. We took the life of someone who had a future.”\nHe said it was the right thing to do for Leger’s family, who attend the trial most days.\n“They need justice,” the witness said.\nMunro asked the witness if his goal was to make a deal with the Crown to testify in this trial, but the young offender denied that. Munro suggested he was originally charged with first-degree murder and eventually pleaded guilty to manslaughter.\n“So was everybody else,” the youth responded.\nWhile all accused in the case were initially charged with first-degree murder, Nicholas McAvoy and Hayden LeBlanc pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced in August, Hunter England pleaded guilty to manslaughter but a publication ban prevents any further reporting on his case at this time and Jerek England will stand trial in the future on charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to commit robbery.\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content\nThe youth denied he got any deal for his co-operation and while the defence lawyer agreed there was no deal on paper, he kept prodding the witness by suggesting he got a deal because he was charged as a youth when he could have been charged as an adult. The witness maintained he got no deal and was given the maximum sentence a youth can get for manslaughter: Three years, including two years in jail and one year on conditions. He said he got out of jail last November and is currently on conditions.\nMunro said the youth would have done anything not to be charged as an adult and got the witness to read a line from a transcript of a conversation he had with an undercover police officer in a cell after his arrest.\n“A judge would have to be the biggest bitch ever if I got charged as an adult,” the young offender said, reading the transcript.\nMunro also asked if he told police he planned to forge his passport and flee to Peru while he was on the run between the shooting and his arrest in June and the witness agreed he told police that.\nThe defence lawyer also asked Phillips if the shooting was not so much a robbery but something that stemmed from ill will between Leger and England, whom the jury has head was the getaway driver.\n“This night was about that fight between Hunter England and Joedin Leger?” the lawyer asked.\nThe witness said he didn’t know anything about that at the time of the robbery but heard something about it after the shooting.\nCourt of King’s Bench Justice Robert Dysart cautioned the jury after the witness was finished, that while they have now heard evidence that the young offender and others may have pleaded guilty to manslaughter in Leger’s death, that has no bearing on whether or not the jury finds Phillips guilty.\nThe trial continues with more witnesses Friday.\nArticle content Share this article in your social network",

    "text": "FBI arrests Naples man, 26, Thursday linked to Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riots A Naples man faces charges linked to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, the U.S. Department of Justice said Thursday, accusing him of assaulting law enforcement officers and other charges. The FBI arrested Zachary Pearlman, 26, of Naples, Thursday on charges in a criminal complaint filed in the District of Columbia with felony offenses of assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers and obstruction of law enforcement during a civil disorder, a news release reports. Pearlman is charged with misdemeanor offenses of entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly conduct in a capitol building or grounds, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building. He joins other Collier County residents in facing charges. His alleged actions and the actions of others disrupted a joint session of the U.S. Congress convened to ascertain and count the electoral votes related to the 2020 presidential election, a release said. He will make his initial appearance in the Middle District of Florida. The court has offices in Fort Myers, Tampa, Orlando and Ocala. The release didn't immediately make clear where he would be arraigned. The Naples Daily News could not immediately confirm information linked to a Zachary Pearlman of Naples. One such person exists on LinkedIn. Court documents claim Pearlman engaged riot police, struck shield According to court documents, Pearlman was seen on U.S. Capitol building closed-circuit Middle District of Florida. Pearlman walked into the Rotunda and was present when a large group of police officers arrived to clear the area of rioters. According to the release, Pearlman, who was at the opposite end of the room, turned from a conversation he was having with other members of the crowd to watch the officers push rioters in the Rotunda toward a nearby exit. Instead of moving toward an exit or leaving the area, Pearlman walked toward the police line. He worked his way through the crowd, pushing past other rioters until he was at the front of the crowd, facing off with the police. Pearlman then began jeering at the officers, pointing at them repeatedly, the release continues. For the next several minutes, he remained at the front of the crowd as the officers tried to physically force rioters from the Rotunda. The officers' efforts, paired with rioters' attempts to remain, resulted in a scrum of pushing and shoving that lasted several minutes. Pearlman remained at the front of the crowd and, at about 3:08 p.m., during this scrum, Pearlman extended his left arm and pushed against a police officer's riot shield. Eventually, Pearlman left the Rotunda and returned to the area inside the Rotunda Doors, the investigation found. There, he rubbed his eyes and appeared to be feeling the effects of a chemical irritant such as teargas or OC spray. He left the Capitol building through the Rotunda Doors at approximately 3:12 p.m. Pearlman was in the Capitol for approximately 27 minutes, records indicate.

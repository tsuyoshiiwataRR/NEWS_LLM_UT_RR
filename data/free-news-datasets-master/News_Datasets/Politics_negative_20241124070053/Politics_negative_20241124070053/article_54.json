    "text": "Former New York congressman and convicted felon [George Santos](https://www.latintimes.com/former-us-rep-santos-pleads-guilty-wire-fraud-identity-theft-i-betrayed-trust-my-557987) has claimed [Kamala Harris](https://www.latintimes.com/topics/kamala-harris) is \"speculated to have been in attendance\" at a \"Diddy party or Jay Z party,\" admitting he \"always wanted to go\" to one. On Wednesday, Santos [posted a video](https://x.com/MrSantosNY/status/1849469192833049022) to the platform X (formerly known as Twitter) teasing a \"damning\" story about Kamala Harris which he claimed would \"drop\" Thursday. When Thursday came, he wrote that because of his video, \"the very LARGE publication\" that would presumably drop the story is now \"stressed,\" and may decide to cover the story up. One hour later, he posted his claim that Harris is speculated to have attended Diddy or Jay-Z parties. Reactions varied as commenters wondered if this could be the \"sink shipping\" news Santos alluded to in his previous posts. Some readers happily piled on to the speculation, with one sharing a photoshopped image with Kamala's face attached to a woman standing beside Diddy. Others alluded to various conspiracy theories. Others expressed earnest disappointment at the flimsiness of Santos' insinuation when they were led to believe there would be more substantial news. Many asked Santos if this was the news he hinted at in earlier posts. There were also commenters critical of Santos. Santos has not participated much in the discussion he started, which has led to \"George Santos\" ranking as a trending topic on the platform. He did respond to one commenter who asked if this was the big surprise, insisting that a big news outlet is sitting on more information. The comments, as well as Santos' past, indicate that most people will not be holding their breath for details of his alleged reveal. Â© 2024 Latin Times. All rights reserved.

    "text": "Mayor of Key GOP Stronghold In Wisconsin Endorses Kamala Harris: ‘I’m Terrified of Donald Trump Becoming President’ Alex Griffing Oct 24th, 2024, 5:32 pm Twitter share button Waukesha Mayor Shawn Reilly told his local Fox station on Thursday that he will be voting for Vice President Kamala Harris for president, despite running a majority Republican city in a very Republican part of Wisconsin.\n“It’s difficult. The easy thing to do is just not say anything and cast my vote the way I want, but I think we’re at a crossroads now,” Reilly told Fox6, adding:\nI feel in my heart that this is something that I need to come out and say: I am going to be voting for Vice President Harris to become our next president.\nReilly told Fox6’s Jason Calvi that he voted for Joe Biden in 2020, but that regularly votes for Republican “more often than not.”\n“It is a vote against Trump,” Reilly added, saying, “I am terrified of Donald Trump becoming our next president for all the reasons I have indicated: he’s already been impeached twice. He’s been convicted of felonies and this is not what the United States needs.”\n“I’m going to put up with repercussions for this,” Reilly said of the blowback he’s already received. “There’s going to be a lot of people who are not happy with what I say, and there will be a lot of people who are happy with what I have to say. But when you’re in this job, that’s your daily life, anyways.”\nReilly noted that he doesn’t plan to run for reelection when is term ends in 2026.\nWatch the clip above.\nHave a tip for us? tips@mediaite.com\nTags: 2024 Election Donald Trump Kamala Harris Republican Party Wisconsin Previous Post Next Post Previous Post Next Post Alex Griffing - Senior Editor Alex Griffing is a Senior Editor at Mediaite.

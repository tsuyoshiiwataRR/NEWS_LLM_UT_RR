    "text": "Co-founder and CEO of The Federalist Sean Davis joins Fox Across America With Jimmy Failla to explain why he thinks the power brokers in the Democratic Party are having buyer’s remorse about Vice President Kamala Harris being their nominee.\n“I even joked at the time that Democrats are going to wish they had Joe Biden back. And I say joke. It’s kind of funny, ha, ha. I genuinely believe it. Because when you looked at the Teamsters poll that came out a month or so ago, the Teamsters, by and large, they kind of like Joe Biden. Blue collar Joe. He’s from Scranton. He had developed this kind of persona that they like. And then Harris gets airdropped in and they’re like, we’re out of here. And suddenly Trump has a 20 point lead. So, yeah, I think they absolutely wish that they hadn’t perpetrated just an awful attack on our sacred democracy by not letting their own people vote for who they wanted.”\nJimmy and Sean also share their thoughts on Harris’ rocky performance during a CNN town hall moderated by Anderson Cooper. Listen to the podcast to hear what else they discussed!",

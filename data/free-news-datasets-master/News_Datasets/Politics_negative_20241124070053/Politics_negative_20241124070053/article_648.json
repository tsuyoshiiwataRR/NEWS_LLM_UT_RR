    "text": "Socialist MP Is Taken Defendant by SPAK The Special Prosecution against Corruption (SPAK) closed investigations and took as defendant this Thursday the socialist MP, Plarent Ndreca, for the reconstruction procedures in four commissariats in Albania when he was General Secretary of the Interior Ministry. His legal representatives, appeared at SPAK this morning to be informed over the case. The accusation was communicated to Ndreca for \"Violation of equality in the tender\", while it was also communicated to several other officials as well as a member of the bid evaluation committee. The report to SPAK was made by the State High Control, which suspects that the officials have allowed inconsistencies and legal deviations in the competition for intervention in the Police Stations of Vlora, Mirdita, Pogradec and that no. 4 in Tirana. According to KLSH, during the inspection, inconsistencies and legal deviations were found, as a result of violations of legal provisions in public procurement procedures, which have affected the equality of participants in tenders.",

    "text": "GLACIER COUNTY, Mont. â€“ An investigation is underway after a video emerged showing a man tampering with a ballot box in Browning on the Blackfeet Reservation. This incident is stirring concerns about election integrity in Montana, especially amid a significant race for U.S. Senate.\nThe video, obtained by Fox News Digital, captures the man, Laszlo Gendler, at the ballot box located at the Glacier County Satellite Office. This is one of the two designated boxes in the county.\nMontana is currently a focus due to the hotly contested senate race between Jon Tester and Tim Sheehy.\nFox News reported that Gendler was employed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC). Gendler reportedly informed the Glacier County Election Administrator that he was sent to test the box's security. The video shows him tugging on the box before leaving.\nThe DSCC responded to Fox News, clarifying that Gendler's actions were not aligned with their procedures. \"Out of an abundance of caution, they're no longer doing this type of work moving forward,\" they stated.\nThe investigation continues as the state looks into ensuring the security and integrity of its election process.\nCurrent Contests Glacier Gallows Contest",

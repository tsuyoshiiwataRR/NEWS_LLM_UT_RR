    "text": "Sumar’s former spokesperson in Congress, Íñigo Errejón who resigned this Thursday from all his political positions, confirmed to Más Madrid that the accusations of sexual abuse and harassment against him published on social networks are true according to sources from the political party.\nThis Thursday, Errejón has released a letter on the social network His resignation, accepted by the coalition of Add arrives in the middle of anonymous accusations of sexist violence for which the management itself has already opened an internal process.\nThus, and after becoming aware of them, More Madrid got in touch with Errejón himself, who, according to sources, confirmed the facts so the decision was made to ask Sumar to demand the deputy’s certificate. In fact, Sumar leader Yolanda Díaz has said that Errejón’s resignation is the result of open process for this training on testimonies about possible cases of sexist violence.\nAfter this, the Secretary of Communication of Add Elizabeth Duval, has assured that her former parliamentary spokesperson recognized “morally reprehensible acts” after the complaint anonymous with accusations of sexist attitudes towards women and the warning from Más Madrid. Faced with this confession, Duval has recognized that in Sumar are “dismayed” and has regretted that the former deputy does not meet the “standards of exemplary feminist which should be required of any political position, any public position, but particularly a left-wing political position,” as he has defended in statements to the Chain Being .\n“Commitment against machismo” Shortly before and after the resignation of the co-founder of Podemos, Díaz indicated on social media that during this week his party had launched an investigation. “This week, Sumar has started a process to collect information about the testimonies that emerged on networks about Íñigo Errejón. As a result of the process, today he leaves all his positions,” she wrote. The leader of Sumar adds that the commitment of this training “against machismo and for a feminist society it’s firm and without exceptions.”\nErrejón’s resignation comes shortly after journalist Cristina Fallarás published an anonymous testimony on her Instagram profile in which she spoke of a deputy (whose name was not cited) who was defined as “ a psychological abuser” and that different users related that testimony to the name of the former leader of Sumar and began to share other stories.\nLate this Thursday afternoon, in addition, l Actress Elisa Mouliaá became the first victim to stand up to the former political spokesperson. “Hello, I am a victim of sexual harassment by Íñigo Errejón and I want to report it,” he wrote on social media, where he also claimed that he had not reported it before out of “fear.”\n#Madrid #affirms #Errejón #recognized #sexual #harassment #accusations #true",

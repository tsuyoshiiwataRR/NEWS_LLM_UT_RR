    "text": "By Sean Noone ,\n1 days ago\nBUTLER, Pa. ( NewsNation ) — More than a dozen 911 calls from the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on July 13 in Butler County , Pennsylvania, have been released by the county.\n“They just tried to kill President Trump. You might want to make a note of that,” one caller told dispatchers.\n“We’re at the Butler Farm Show grounds. We need assistance now!” said another.\nDriving the vote: Some Michigan union workers still undecided The 15 recordings were released by Butler County after news outlets sued to get the public records. They were released Tuesday as part of a settlement of the public records lawsuit.\nIn August, law enforcement released body camera footage from local police responding to the shooting.\nShooter Thomas Crooks was shot and killed by U.S. Secret Service agents seconds after he opened fire on Trump.\nMembers of a bipartisan House task force investigating the recent attempts on Trump’s life have emphasized that the Secret Service, not local authorities, was responsible for the failures in planning and communications that led to a gunman being able to open fire on Trump in Butler.\nTrump was wounded in the shooting, and a man, Corey Comperatore, who was attending the rally with his family, was killed.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

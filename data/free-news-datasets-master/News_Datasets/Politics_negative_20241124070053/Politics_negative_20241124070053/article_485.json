    "text": "We all know she's a Kama Kama Kama Kamaleon, but trying to figure out Kamala's actual religious beliefs really has America stumped. Kamala Harris last night: 'I was raised to believe in a loving God, to believe that your faith is a verb, you live your faith.' — Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) She was actually raised by her mother to believe in a vengeful Hindu goddess, if you listen to her early political speeches in SF. From the book:[pic.twitter.com/hrCFqXyP8N][October 24, 2024] I'm really getting confused about Harris' religious background. One minute, she claims to have been observant of her Hindu background, having affirmed that with public comments. — Bonchie (@bonchieredstate) The next, she says she celebrated Kwanzaa. Now, she's a devout Christian?[https://t.co/2grsqSRVQ2][October 24, 2024] It's a mystery wrapped up in an enigma. She’s a chameleon. A vapid one, but still. — DelilahM (@delilahmused)[October 24, 2024] Well she may be a lizard person and her brain is the size of a pea, so that makes sense. She is whatever you need her to be — Dan Goldwasser (@dgoldwas)[October 24, 2024] Rather, she is whomever Obama needs her to be. She has no religion other than to seek her own self actualization. — NotYourJewishMom (@CaffMomREDACTED)[October 24, 2024] She needs to learn to effectively communicate first. This has to be the one question that I can’t find any answers for. I would have more respect if she just settled on one religion, but she picks and chooses whatever will make her look more sympathetic. — Sam 🇺🇸Yoda🇺🇸 Bronkey (@TheYodaPagoda)[October 24, 2024] She's basically Gumby. She’s also Jewish on Chanukah. — Walter Sobchak (@WalterSobchakSr)[October 24, 2024] Well, her husband is Jewish so she already claims that. She is who you want her to be. Started back when she was offering the Girlfriend Experience. — dcnh (@dcnh42)[October 24, 2024] She is whatever she needs to be for her audience. She is an empty vessel — Angry NPC (@the_angry_npc)[October 24, 2024] Literally, a listless vessel. No need for confusion. She’s a liar. It’s that simple. Therefore you can discount anything that flows from her mouth. — The Canaanites Had It Coming ✝️🇺🇸 (@randysult)[October 24, 2024] Most religions don't excuse liars, after all. She should change her name to Kamaleon instead. — Joseph Rizal 🇺🇸📟 (@jrizal1957)[October 24, 2024] We should make a Venn Diagram. — Steve R. (@steverosen1235)[pic.twitter.com/NjgnuSyBW5][October 24, 2024] She’s a total fraud. We will never know the real Kamala — JenniferR 🇺🇸 (@JenTexas16)[October 24, 2024] Her religion, like her accent, changes with the wind. — Black Supremacy Watch (@Blacknatwatch)[October 24, 2024] Her religion depends upon what day it is and what audience she is standing in front of. Pandering — Linda MacDougall (@lindamac12steps)[October 24, 2024] Maybe she grew up like Biden, in a Puerto Rican neighborhood attending Jewish synagogue and black churches, while marching for civil rights and taking on bullies at the local swimming pool. — Neil Axelrod 🇺🇸 (@NeilAxelrod)[October 24, 2024] Her real religion is Marxism, which means she pretends to be all of those other things whenever it's convenient for her to get what she wants — Buanadha (@buanadha)[October 24, 2024] Bingo!",

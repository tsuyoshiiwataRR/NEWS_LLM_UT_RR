    "text": "Srinagar, Oct 24: The Jammu Kashmir Press Corps (JKPC) has raised concerns regarding certain individuals posing as editors and allegedly operating media organizations in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). These individuals are reportedly engaged in defamation and blackmail, particularly targeting government officials, undermining efforts to promote transparency and fairness within the region’s press. “Journalists have been seen as custodians of public interest, bridging the gap between the government and the people. Their role in highlighting the issues faced by ordinary citizens and raising awareness about government initiatives aimed at public welfare is a cornerstone of democracy,” the statement said. However, in J&K, unethical practices have compromised the media’s integrity and the values it is meant to uphold. Before 2019, a select few media organizations in J&K monopolized the journalistic landscape, fostering radicalization and engaging in blackmail against various government departments, including the J&K Information Department. This unethical conduct severely damaged the integrity of journalism in the region, turning the media into a tool for personal gain rather than serving as a watchdog for society. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi post-2019, significant reforms were introduced to rectify this situation. The media sector, particularly newspaper organizations, underwent a much-needed overhaul, restoring a sense of fairness and transparency in the distribution of government advertisements. The J&K Information Department ensured that all newspapers received their rightful share based on merit rather than coercion or manipulation. Recently, however, troubling reports have emerged suggesting that some of the same unscrupulous elements within the media fraternity are resorting to blackmail tactics once again. These individuals, often referred to as the “black sheep” of the newspaper community, are allegedly pressuring officials within the J&K Information Department. The actions of these individuals have not only tarnished the reputation of the entire journalistic community in Kashmir but have also turned their newspapers into tools for defamation and blackmail. They are accused of launching personal attacks against officials from various government departments, particularly those within the J&K Information Department, even going so far as to malign their private lives. Adding to the concern is the involvement of these so-called journalists and editors, some of whom are facing criminal charges and have been booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA). They are reportedly using their influence with newly elected legislators to further their own interests, undermining the transparency of government operations and harming both the personal and professional lives of their victims. This resurgence of unethical behavior has fostered a climate of fear, with innocent individuals being blackmailed under the guise of journalism. Many of these so-called “Litho newspapers” are printing only 50 to 100 copies to mislead the government. As the largest and only registered journalist association in J&K, the JKPC is deeply troubled by these developments. The organization urges the Prime Minister to take swift and decisive action against these blackmailers, emphasizing the need for accountability to prevent further degradation of the media’s credibility in J&K. Only through stringent measures can the press maintain its role as a force for truth and accountability rather than a tool for personal vendettas and corrupt practices. In response to these issues, the JKPC has resolved to send letters containing the names of alleged blackmailer editors and fraudulent media houses to the Prime Minister’s Office, the Home Minister’s Office, and the Chairperson of the Press Council of India.

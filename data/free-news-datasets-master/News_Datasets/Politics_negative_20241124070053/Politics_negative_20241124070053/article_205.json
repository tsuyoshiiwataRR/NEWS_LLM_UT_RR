    "text": "By Shereen Siewert ,\n19 minutes ago Wausau Pilot & Review\nWeeks after more than two dozen Stettin residents received an incorrect ballot, at least 20 voters in Kronenwetter may have cast the wrong ballot during in-person absentee voting, or early voting.\n“Due to a clerical error, voters in Ward 11 who reside in the Mosinee School District might have been given a ballot for voters in the D.C. Everest School District, and vice versa,” a Kronenwetter official said in a news release. “This mishap is especially significant because the Mosinee School District has a referendum on the ballot.”\nThis mistake only affects voters in Ward 11 who voted early between Oct. 22 through Oct. 24. This does not affect voters who received their absentee ballot by mail, the news release said.\nOfficials have asked residents to contact the contact or visit the Kronenwetter clerk’s office as soon as possible if they suspect they received the wrong ballot. They further said that they will make every effort to contact the 20 voters who may have been affected.\nThe development comes after more than 30 Stettin residents were sent incorrect absentee ballots, an error that has since been corrected .\nAffected Kronenwetter residents can contact the Village of Kronenwetter clerk’s office at 715-693-4200 (ext. 1728), [email protected] or at 1582 Kronenwetter Drive, Kronenwetter, WI 54455.",

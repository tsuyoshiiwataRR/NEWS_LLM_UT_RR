    "text": "A\nFox News pundit's attempt to dismiss reports that former President Donald Trump wished his generals were more like high-ranking Nazis failed to convince a swath of his viewers.\nHoward Alan Kurtz on Thursday tried to diminish the significance of former\nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly's on-the-record statement that Trump had positive things to say about Nazi generals, arguing he may have been \" letting off steam.\"\nThis prompted Georgetown University law and politics professor\nJosh Chafetz to respond, \"How do these people not understand that 'He only rants about wanting to be like Hitler in private!' is not actually reassuring?\"\nKelly's statement has rendered Trump's political foes increasingly fearful of the Republican presidential nominee's authoritarian leanings as he mounts his third bid for the White House.\nALSO READ:\n'He’s mentally ill:' NY laughs ahead of Trump's Madison Square Garden rally\nTrump's worrying statements include racial attacks\non Vice President Kamala Harris and immigrants he says have \" bad genes,\" demands the U.S. Constitution be \" terminated,\" and promises to punish political opponents whom he describes as the \" enemy within\" and ally Tucker Carlson described as bad little girls about to get a spanking from daddy.\nThis may be why some viewers were loath to accept the theory that Trump's praise of Nazi generals was no more than a tension-release exercise.\n\"I think this segment, more than any, hits on the head that talking about Hitler in relation to a candidate, in any way, shape or form, is probably not a good thing,\" said public relations executive\nChris Harihar.\n\"I often valorize Hitler when I find myself angry,\" replied a sarcastic\nLee Kovarsky, professor of law at the University of Texas.\nMedia strategist\nTom Domke concluded, \"So the closing argument from is that sometimes Trump can’t control himself and to 'let off steam' he may need Nazi generals to carry out his orders.\"\nAdded liberal radio show host\nDean Obeidallah, \"Fox News just found a new way to normalize Trump's love of Hitler!\"",

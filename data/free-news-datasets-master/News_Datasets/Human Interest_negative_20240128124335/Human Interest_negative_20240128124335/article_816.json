    "text": "There are fears Gloucester’s historic docks have been turned into a “glorified car park”. Motorists have been using the land between North Warehouse and the Main Basin to park their vehicles over recent months.\nNearby business owners raised concerns in November that it poses a risk to the many pedestrians who walk along there. The land there is owned by Gloucester City Council and they had tried to stop the practice by using temporary bollards.\nHowever, these were vandalised and the land is still being used by motorists. It is understood council chiefs are currently considering the installation of permanent bollards there to curb the problem.\nDid you see this story? Underused care home to become short-term housing for people granted asylum in UK\nCouncillor Rebecca Trimnell (LD, Westgate), who represents the area on Gloucester City Council, is calling for a solution to be found. She says the area is being used by motorists on a daily basis.\n“A solution must be found ASAP to stop the historical docks from being used as a glorified car park,” she said. A spokesperson for Gloucester City Council previously said they are working on a solution to stop parking in that area for good.\nAttempts to stop people using an unofficial car park in front of North Warehouse have been unsuccesful so far\n“We are aware of people using land in Gloucester Docks to park their vehicles. Temporary bollards were installed to prevent this but, unfortunately, they were vandalised. We are currently working on a permanent solution to prevent parking in this area.”\nWant our best stories with fewer ads and alerts when the biggest news stories drop?

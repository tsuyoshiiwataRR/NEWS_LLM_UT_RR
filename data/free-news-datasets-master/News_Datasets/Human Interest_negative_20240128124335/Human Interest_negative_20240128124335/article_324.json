    "text": "Enlarge image Damascus International Airport Photo: YOUSSEF BADAWI / EPA-EFE Attacks in the dark: Israel has again attacked targets near the capital Damascus, according to Syrian state media and the Ministry of Defense. Air defenses are targeting \"enemy targets\" near the city, the state news agency Sana said on Thursday. Syrian state television also reported Israeli attacks from the Damascus area. According to the Syrian Defense Ministry, the attacks were carried out from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The agency did not report any casualties of the shelling. According to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the strikes targeted an air defense position in the southern Syrian province of Suweida, as well as the area around Damascus International Airport. The airport had only reopened a day earlier – after being closed for several weeks as a result of an earlier Israeli airstrike at the end of November. In October, the airports in Damascus and Aleppo in northwestern Syria had already been forced to suspend operations twice following Israeli air strikes. In general, Israel rarely comments on individual attacks in Syria. However, it has repeatedly stressed that it will not allow its arch-enemy Iran to expand its presence in Syria. Tehran is allied with Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad. Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war in 2011, Israel has shelled the neighboring country from the air hundreds of times. The attacks are directed in particular against the Iranian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah militia, but also against positions of the Syrian army. Since the start of the war against the Hezbollah-allied radical Islamic Palestinian organization Hamas nearly two months ago, Israel has intensified airstrikes in Syria. dop/AFP",

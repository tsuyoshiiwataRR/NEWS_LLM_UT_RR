Unfortunately for one family living north of Atlanta, that’s not the case. Their daughter’s 2022 Honda Civic is melting, WSB-TV reports .\nAccording to Charles Goldberg, his daughter’s side-view mirrors, bumper and other trim pieces began to warp, and bubbles appeared in the paint. “It’s as if someone shot a ray gun at our car,” he told the news outlet, adding, “I’d never seen anything like it. It was also warped and started melting and disintegrating.”\nRead more\nADVERTISEMENT Rebel Moon's Ed Skrein on Co-Starring With His Game of Thrones Replacement\nThe Best RPGs Of 2023\nThe State Of The Nintendo Switch In 2023\nGypsy Rose Blanchard has been released from prison and hopes to meet Taylor Swift\nChinese Chess Champ Stripped Of Title After Taking A Dump In A Bathtub\nThe Goldbergs, however, don’t sound particularly happy with that explanation and have reportedly filed a complaint with Honda corporate. Unfortunately for them, while a quick search for “melting Honda” turns up a number of forum results, if you dig a little deeper, Honda owners aren’t the only ones dealing with similar issues. Still, considering how many complaints there are about melting Hondas, you have to wonder if it could change the type of exterior plastics it uses to make melting less likely to happen.\nMore from Jalopnik\nThe Best Movies You May Have Missed in 2023, and Where to Stream Them\nResearchers Uncover the ‘Most Sophisticated’ iPhone Exploit Ever\nXbox Slammed For AI-Generated Art Promoting Indie Games\nWegovy and Other New Weight Loss Drugs Actually Work—so What's Next?\nIDIOT OF THE YEAR: It's the final countdown (Nos. 10-1)\nSign up for Jalopnik's Newsletter.

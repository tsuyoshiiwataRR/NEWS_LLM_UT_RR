    "text": "FREEPORT, Nassau County (WABC) -- Nassau SPCA is offering $5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction after a dog was stabbed 17 times. Cornell, a two-year-old Terrier mix, was found injured and bleeding on November 27 on Washburn Avenue in Freeport, Long Island. \"Cornell can't tell us his story. He can't tell us what happened. He can't tell us why or when something like this happened to him. We just know he was found bleeding from the 17 wounds,\" said Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly. The woman who found Cornell brought him to the non-profit, no-kill organization shelter in Hempstead, but his injuries were too extensive for them to treat. Cornell was then sent to a veterinarian hospital in Farmingdale. Miraculously, Cornell has survived his injuries. \"Some of the stab wounds caused his lungs to leak air between his body cavity and his lungs, and they had to be drained a number of times. The other stab wounds were cleaned, were either stapled or sewn,\" said DA Donnelly. The Nassau County DA's Office is asking anyone with information to call the animal crimes hotline at 516-571-7755. \"People who commit crimes like this against animals can be very dangerous, also to people. We need to find out who did this to Cornell,\" said DA Donnelly. ALSO READ | New laws that take effect in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in 2024",

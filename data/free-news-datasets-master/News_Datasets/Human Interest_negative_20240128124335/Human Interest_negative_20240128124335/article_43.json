    "text": "Bill Granger has died, aged 54 Famous Aussie chef was known as 'King of Breakfast'READ MORE: How Bill Granger invented the Aussie brunch\nWorld-renowned Australian chef Bill Granger began his hospitality career as a waiter while at university – but he had an even more humble start to his working life.\nGranger, 54, died on Christmas Day surrounded by his family following a battle with cancer.\nThe talented self-taught cook introduced the world to Australia’s iconic informal breakfast culture.\nHowever, his highly-successful chain of restaurants – bills in Australia and Granger and Co in the UK, with 14 locations around the globe – is a far cry from the father-of-two’s first job as a worker at a Kmart in a Melbourne shopping centre.\nBill Granger (picture with wife, Natalie) opened his first restaurant at 23 years old after first being introduced to the culinary world as a chef\nFamous Australian chef Bill Granger (pictured with his parents) passed on Christmas Day following a battle with cancer\nIn a 2009 interview with food blogger Lorraine Elliott, Granger revealed he was raised by his butcher father and vegetarian mother in south-east Melbourne.\n‘I was brought up down near Mentone then we moved out to a place called Berwick which is near where Kath and Kim do the series,’ he said.\n‘That was my first job – at Kmart Fountain Gate!’\nGranger’s entry into cooking came from reading cookbooks as a teenager but it wasn’t until he took a waiter’s job as a student that he considered becoming a chef.\n‘I used to cook all the time from the Women’s Weekly cookbooks and recipe cards that were in the box right next to the stove,’ he said.\n‘Then Margaret Fulton, then as I got older I got into more sophisticated books like Elizabeth David.\n‘When I was 19 I always read them and just became a good home cook, which is what I am now. Just a good home cook.\n‘When I was at my second year of uni I needed some money to pay my way and there was a restaurant across the road from uni and I applied for a job as a waiter.\n‘I became friends with the owner and I cooked for her and she really liked the way I cooked so she invited me to cook in the kitchen and it started from there.’\nGranger opened his first restaurant in Sydney’s Darlinghurst at the age of 23 after making the life-altering call to drop out of art school.\n‘I wouldn’t use the word daunting, it was more of a challenge,’ he said of opening the first bills location.\n‘I had no idea how to run a business and it’s still not what I’m best at. I’m very good on the creative stuff. I’m very lucky as I had Dad who used to do all the bookwork.’\nGanger picked up his first job at Kmart in Melbourne’s Fountain Lakes and became a waiter in his second year of university (pictured left in 1993)\nGranger first met his partner, Natalie, at his Darlinghurst cafe and within four weeks, they were planning their wedding.\nThey quickly moved in together and went on to have three daughters – Edie, 22, Inès, 20, and Bunny, 19.\nGranger long nurtured a dream of taking his avo and scrambled eggs abroad – and was already planning his blueprint to take the Aussie brunch global when he moved with his family to the UK in 2009.\nGranger admitted at the time that plans were in place to take the winning formula to London: ‘I’d love to. That’s the next dream.\n‘We’ve been tentatively looking at things in the last few months. I just love the food scene there. It’s very exciting.’\nGranger also revealed what his dream last meal would have been.\n‘My last meal would be with my family so it would have to please them,’ he said.\n‘A perfect steak, being the son of a butcher I can’t get away from that.\n‘A beautiful rib eye or any other delicious steak, some french fries, a perfectly dressed green salad with lettuce from my garden, strawberries and cream, some little chocolate truffles and nice glass of champagne.\n‘Simple and straightforward.’\nGranger (pictured in with his wife and three daughters) wanted his last meal to be steak with french fries and a salad\nIt’s understood Granger was diagnosed with cancer several months ago.\n‘A dedicated husband and father, Bill died peacefully in hospital with his wife Natalie Elliott and three daughters, Edie, Inès and Bunny, at his bedside in their adopted home of London,’ his family wrote in an Instagram post on Wednesday.\n‘He will be deeply missed by all, with his loss most profoundly felt by his adored family, who are grateful for all the love and support that has been given.’\nThe news was followed by tributes from the Australian and international culinary communities, including from British chef Jamie Oliver and former MasterChef judge Matt Preston.",

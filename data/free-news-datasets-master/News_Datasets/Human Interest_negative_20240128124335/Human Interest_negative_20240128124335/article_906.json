    "text": "Chopper pilots have shared the terrifying view from a police helicopter whilst being thrown around the sky by Storm Gerrit.\nThis was the moment a National Police Air Service helicopter was transformed into a \"flying washing machine\" as it hit the tempest over London on Thursday. Airborne officers commanding the aircraft shared the clip with green-faced emojis as the storm swept in, wreaking havoc across the UK.\nWriting on X, formerly known as Twitter , NPAS London pilots said: \"If you think it’s windy down there, spare a thought for us up here in our flying washing machine!\" They added: \"Thankfully, we have recent taken delivery of some extra sick bags. None have been required…… yet!\"\nThe pilots weren't the only ones in the sky to struggle in the strong gusts this week, however. One American Airlines flight faced a very bumpy landing at Heathrow on Wednesday amidst the severe windy conditions from the named storm.\nBigJetTV captured the nailbiting moment the flight from Los Angeles touched down as it was thrown side to side by strong gusts. The airline enthusiast filming the landing can be heard shouting \"oh\" over and over as the aircraft makes its shaky landing, before yelling, \"stop it!\"\nMeanwhile, British Airways planes were captured making similarly treacherous landings at Bristol Airport on Wednesday. The vehement gusts meant one aircraft had to make three attempts to land, while others were filmed being thrown about by the storm above the runway.\nThe Met Office issued several weather warnings earlier this week for strong wind and heavy rain, as well as snow in parts of Scotland and the Shetland Islands. Forecasters named the storm Gerrit as a warning to Brits hitting the road or heading outdoors during the post-Christmas week, with concerns the severe weather would unleash travel chaos and power cuts.",

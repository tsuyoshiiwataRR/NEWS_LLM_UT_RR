    "text": "As a long time member of this forum, i stopped posting for a while, because the discussion had gone awful, with people calling out people with animal names. I hope, this style has vanished, although i still see many bickerings and flames and ego shooters in the discussion here. Anyway, i am still interested in tennis history, ans some new posters like Mtincoronel, Drop, No Mercy or Ivan have made some good contributions in some recent posts i read in the last days.\nI think, the old pro tour pre open and early open era is still a puzzle that is not solved sufficiently. What we do get, is more information on results, because many newspaper archives are going open on the internet. I have deep respect for researchers like Sutter or McCauley or Robert Geist, Carlo Colussi, Elegos or Andrew Tas, who hadn't internet sources, but went to libraries and archives and put together written accounts (with all the flaws inherent). I respect tennis base (i think i was the first here in 2015, who pointed to that webside), or the work of Slasher, who reconstructed the early open era rankings, or the Italian websides of Ubitennis or tennis is my life. But research is not analysis, analysis requires more: a factual basis with giving the full picture and some structural context, an open and independent mind, some critical method of reading and understanding (we call this in German hermeneutics), a proper way of arguing, with no tricks and with looking at the other side of arguments, some clear writing and foremost some methodical consistency. Serious research on the old pro circuit would go behind newspaper findings to real sources: documents, contracts, match lists of organizers, managers or promoters. There must have been material existed, alone for tax reasons. I found on the internet, that the Penn State university offers some material in boxes: the George McCall papers, with boxes of contracts, match lists, letters and other documents. McCall was US DC captain and later the manager of the NTL, the pro group that was founded in late 1967.\nI think, the old pro tour pre open and early open era is still a puzzle that is not solved sufficiently.

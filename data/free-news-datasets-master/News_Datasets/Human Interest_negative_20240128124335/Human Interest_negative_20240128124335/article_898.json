    "text": "3rd most capped player in OM history and captain of the Minots, François Bracci has died\nIt is a monument to the Olympique de Marseille which has bowed out: François Bracchi has experienced everything in the blue and white jersey, from the title of champion of\nFrance in 1972 to the Minots epic in the mid-1980s. left side died at the age of 72.\n342 matches played in the OM jersey: only Roger Scotti (452) and Steve Mandanda (613) have managed to do better than François Bracci and it is not an empty word to write that it is an authentic legend of the Marseille club who disappears following a long illness.\nThe left back born in Alsace was passionate about OM and he made his dream come true by wearing the blue and white jersey. Although he also played in Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Rouen and Béziers, it was with “his” club (1971-1979 then 1983-1985) that he marked his era. An\ninternational (18 caps), he played in the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, the crowning achievement of a career where he experienced everything with OM.\nChampion of\nFrance in 1972, winner of the Coupe de France in 1976, he experienced the club’s last successes before a decade-long eclipse, but if one day Bernard Tapie set his sights on OM, it was also because that Bracci was the captain of the Minots team that brought the club back to Division 1 in 1984.\nHaving become a coach, he has competed in the Algerian and Moroccan championships over the last two decades. It was with Mouloudia Algiers that he won the Cup and the Super Cup in 2006 then the champion title in 2010.\n2023-12-28 21:09:30\n#3rd #capped #player #history #captain #Minots #François #Bracci #died #Flashscore.fr",

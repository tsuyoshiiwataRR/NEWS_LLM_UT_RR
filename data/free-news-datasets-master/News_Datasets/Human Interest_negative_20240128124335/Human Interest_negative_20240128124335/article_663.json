    "text": "A federal grand jury indicted a Wheat Ridge man who went on an alleged string of crimes around the metro Denver area over several months, reportedly injuring two people, carjacking three vehicles and robbing five stores. Keenan Clodfelter, 20, was indicted on 11 counts — three counts of carjacking, three counts of robbery and five counts of brandishing a firearm in relation to the carjacking and robbery charges — according to a Wednesday news release by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado. The slew of alleged crimes began on Oct. 4, when two people were carjacked in Thornton in the 9700 block of Welby Road around midnight, according to a previous news release by the Thornton Police Department. One person had their 2013 Toyota Highlander stolen by a man with a gun. Another nearby victim claimed a man with a gun attempted to steal her vehicle. As she drove away, she was shot in the arm. The Highlander was eventually found and two men fled from the front seats. Clodfelter was eventually tracked down, tazed and arrested. Another man, Jaquise Redd, 18, the driver of the Highlander, was arrested. Authorities said he had a black Springfield XD-9mm handgun, a high-capacity magazine and a 50-round box of ammunition in a bookbag. The carjacking spree picked back up on Nov. 20 when a man told the Aurora Police Department he had been carjacked by two men with guns at 1540 N. Laredo Street. Police across the metro then responded to armed robberies at a 7-Eleven located on East Quincy Avenue in Aurora and Pour Boy Liquor on 20th Avenue in Lakewood on November 20th, as well as the robbery of a Circle K on Kalamath Street in Denver on November 21st. The indictment charges Clodfelter in all of these robberies, according to the press release. The crimes ended with a shooting on Nov. 21 in the area of 44th Avenue and Youngfield Street. The suspect allegedly shot into a vehicle, breaking glass and injuring the driver. Investigators connected Clodfelter to the robberies through physical descriptions and video footage, according to arrest records. On Nov. 22, at around 2 a.m., a Lakewood officer found a Scion without plates in the parking lot of a Motel 6 at 480 Wadsworth Boulevard. The vehicle had been reported stolen from Aurora. Clodfelter and another man were found in a motel room. He was arrested by Lakewood police. Though only 20, Clodfelter's criminal history stretches well beyond the string of incidents this autumn. He has previously been charged with assault, disorderly conduct, felony menacing with a weapon, aggravated motor vehicle theft, aggravated robbery, resisting arrest, eluding and others, court records show. His Colorado driving status has been revoked since Oct. 2021. He has six prior suspensions and four prior convictions. The federal case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Lakewood Police Department, according to the release.",

    "text": "(WWJ) - A woman is facing multiple charges, including torture, after authorities said she allegedly abused her boyfriend’s mother while she was in the woman's care. 40-year-old Laura Tisdelle, of Sterling Heights, was bound over to face the charges on Dec. 27, officials said. Tisdelle’s boyfriend returned home on June 21, after a five day trip, and allegedly found his mother “with her hands tied together, restrained to the bed, severely beaten and laying in her own urine and feces,” the Macomb County Prosecutor’s Office said in a written statement. At the time of his trip, Tisdelle was the sole caregiver for the victim at her Sterling Heights home. Tisdelle has been charged with torture, vulnerable adult abuse in the first degree, unlawful imprisonment and domestic violence 3rd by the Macomb County Prosecutor’s Office Senior Crimes Unit, authorities said. Torture is a life felony, adult abuse and unlawful imprisonment are both 15-year felonies and domestic violence is a five year felony. “We are committed to pursuing justice for the alleged torture and abuse inflicted upon this elderly woman. This commitment drives us to passionately advocate for the dignity and well-being of individuals who are unable to protect themselves,” Macomb County Prosecutor Peter J. Lucido said. Tisdelle’s next court date is on Jan. 8 in Macomb County Circuit Court.",

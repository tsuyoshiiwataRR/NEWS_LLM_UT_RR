    "text": "I continue to read letters concerning snow removal; most are critical, and some are supportive. My experience indicates a pretty dismal effort, not because of the snow removal personnel but despite them. It appears management at state and municipality have trimmed down the efforts to achieve savings and we are now paying the price. That is my grasp of the facts without firm support. I would love to see a comparison of past levels of effort to current levels of effort. Perhaps an inflation-adjusted comparison of snow removal budgets from 2000, 2005, 2010, 2020, and present to include funded positions and numbers of equipment. Perhaps the editors might take on an investigative effort to make these comparisons. If they are essentially equal, then we are good and it is just the snow levels. However, if my hunch is right and the level of effort has decreased over time, then that speaks for itself. â€” Michael L. Mott Eagle River Have something on your mind?

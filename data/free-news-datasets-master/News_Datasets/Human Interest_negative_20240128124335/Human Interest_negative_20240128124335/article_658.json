    "text": "A bout of drinking and fighting during an off-campus school activity came before a reported riot between Simon Sanchez High School students at the John F. Kennedy High School campus earlier this month. That’s according to Sanchez High Principal Carla Masnayon, who shared more details about the fights at JFK during a roundtable on school violence hosted by the Office of the Attorney General this Wednesday. Masnayon confirmed that students involved in the incident earlier this month were from Sanchez High, and were not fighting JFK students. Sanchez students have been left attending double-session classes at JFK after the Sanchez campus in Yigo was abandoned due to serious damage from Typhoon Mawar in May. Police responded to a reported riot at the JFK campus on Dec. 11, and two students who were 18 years old were arrested and charged following the incident, the Pacific Daily News reported previously. But trouble began a day before, during a school concert that was held at Ypao Beach, according to Masnayon. Guam Police Department had to be called to stop a fight between students who had become intoxicated and started fighting around a pavilion at the beach. “This was the first time that we did an off campus, open area event. We wanted to showcase some of the talents of our students, and one of the challenges that we’ve had because we were doing a double session was that we didn’t have a facility to do these things,” she said. When fighting broke out at Ypao Beach, it was dark, and difficult to identify students in the wide-open beach, Masnayon told Attorney General Douglas Moylan on Wednesday. School administrators had to focus on keeping parents and students who had come for the concert away from the fighting. By the time GPD arrived for the incident, the fighters had dispersed. Fighting at Ypao, “that was brought into the campus on the following day,” the principal said. Charging documents alleged the Dec. 11 fight at JFK campus started after one student, Attshawn Kasuta, 18, approached another with his fist wrapped in a red bandana and asked if “we’re going to throw down?” Christian Rick Ada, also 18, told police he witnessed the first fight, and said that more students jumped into the fight after Kasuta and the student Kasuta was fighting, fell on the ground, court documents stated. Masnayon said Sanchez High has implemented a Student Advocate Mentorship program, to provide mentors to students in the hopes of keeping them on the right track. The school has been tracking a higher number of ninth graders involved in “mischief” this year, from contraband to fighting. 84 riots so far this school year Though the Simon Sanchez fights, which were caught on camera, were the most recent to make headlines, there have been a total of 84 riots reported at public schools just halfway through the 2023 to 2024 school year, according to data shared by the Guam Department of Education. A perceived high level of violence on school campuses is what led to the OAG’s Wednesday’s roundtable. If the rioting trend continues through the second half of the school year, this year will be on track to record more school riots than every school year since the summer of 2019, based on GDOE data. The number of fights reported this school year, however, are on par with what’s been seen in previous years. Simon Sanchez students actually have a lower daily average of disciplinary incidents than every high school besides Tiyan High School, according to GDOE data, though data doesn’t differentiate between minor infractions and violent behavior reported at each school. ‘Disturbing’ videos of fights Also more commonplace are videos of altercations between students. Education oversight chairman, Sen. Chris Barnett, said he’s discovered a number of Instagram pages which are entirely devoted to fights on school campus—both disagreements and sparring matches between students. “What I see when I see these videos, I see students who are very comfortable with disrespecting each other. I see students who are also very comfortable with the amount of time they have,” he said. Guam Education Board Chair Mary Okada said the board called the fight videos that have been circulating “quite disturbing,” and that the board wants to support GDOE to deal with issues at local schools. “Many of us have seen the videos over the past several months, as school began. Post-COVID students returning to campus, and they’re bringing back to campus, perhaps a lot of built up energy that they’ve had during COVID,” she said.",

    "text": "A social media post from the Cincinnati Cyclones caused some uproar online, resulting in the team deleting its post and clarifying that its retro-inspired jerseys for its upcoming Throwback Night are ‚Äúin no way a political statement.‚Äù\nThe Cyclones posted a video Tuesday night on Twitter showcasing their red throwback jerseys with the caption, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care we paint the town red üö® (on January 6).‚Äù\nFeel bad for admin but this is objectively hilarious. https://t.co/Ri23MJ7XkK pic.twitter.com/EihVrVI7mx\n‚Äî Keg. (@GratefulKeg) December 27, 2023 Several Twitter users questioned whether the caption, paired with the date, was meant to be a political statement.\n‚ÄúPaint the town WHAT on WHEN?!?!‚Äù tweeted Connor Moore, a social media coordinator for the WNBA team the Chicago Sky.\nMoore‚Äôs tweets had thousands of likes and retweets, with several users wondering if the team meant to connect the lyrics from the popular Doja Cat song ‚ÄúPaint The Town Red‚Äù to the events that occurred at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\nThe Cyclones deleted the video and on Wednesday released a statement clarifying the post.\npic.twitter.com/QoFd3VsLnk\n‚Äî Cincinnati Cyclones (@CincyCyclones) December 27, 2023 ‚ÄúLast night we shared a video of our red warm-up jerseys with the lyrics to a trending song. The tweet was meant to hype people up for our Throwback Night, where we will wear the retro inspired jerseys,‚Äù the Cyclones said. ‚ÄúOur Throwback Night is traditionally held on the first weekend of January. This night and these jerseys are in no way a political statement.‚Äù\nMany Twitter users, including Moore, responded that they were laughing at how the post could be misconstrued but never believed it to be political.\n‚Äú(Cyclones) I want you to know I was just making jokes üò© trust me, I know the feel,‚Äù Moore said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing phenomenal, my friend!‚Äù\nThe Cyclones are hosting their Throwback Night on Saturday, Jan. 6.

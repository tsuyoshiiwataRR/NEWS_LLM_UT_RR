    "text": "I love seeing the differences in the dynamics between a big family and a small family. I have 2 sisters, and I would consider my family to be small. Growing up with only two siblings got me to become really close with them. There is a two-year gap between me and my older sister, and also a two-year gap between me and my younger sister, so we have a lot in common. Meanwhile, my best friend grew up in a family of 10. Being 8 siblings, there is an 18-year gap between the youngest and the oldest sibling. By the time the younger siblings grow up, they barely get to see their older siblings. Although my friend claims they are all also very close, and that the family gatherings are a blast. There are also a lot of families in between these two situations, and so I like to observe the relationships in these different families. This brings me to the story of this woman who turned to the people of Reddit to see if she was in the wrong for not wanting her boyfriend's kids to show up at their house unannounced. As he has 7 of them, that can make things a little complicated in their household. The people of Reddit did not hesitate to fully judge this woman and her situation, so scroll down for the full story.

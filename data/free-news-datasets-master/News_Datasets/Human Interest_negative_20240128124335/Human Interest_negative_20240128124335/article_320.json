    "text": "Agencies\nVirat Kohli’s defiant 76 failed to save India from being thrashed by an innings and 32 runs by South Africa in the first Test at Centurion.\nIndia lost seven second-innings wickets in the evening session as they were bowled out for just 131 in 34.1 overs.\nKohli and Shubman Gill (26) were the only India batters into double figures as Nandre Burger (4-33) and Marco Jansen (3-36) did the damage.\nThe second and final Test starts on 3 January at Newlands in Cape Town.\nIndia captain Rohit Sharma said his side’s performance after a defeat inside three days was “not good enough” and they “failed” to “come together collectively”.\n“Guys have come here before, we understand what to expect from the conditions. Every individual has his own plan,” Rohit said.\n“Our batters were challenged at different times. We didn’t adapt well. We didn’t bat well both times which is why we stand here.” Earlier in the day, South Africa had posted a commanding 408 in response to India’s first-innings total of 245.\nDean Elgar, who announced he would retire from international cricket after the series against India, played freely to make a classy 185 while Jansen hit an unbeaten 84.\nIndia were 62-3 at tea with Kagiso Rabada, who took 5-59 in the first innings, capturing the key wicket of India skipper Rohit.\nHowever, the tourists lost seven wickets for just 59 runs in the evening session as South Africa’s seamers ran through their middle order.\nKohli made a determined 76 from 82 balls but he was last man out - caught brilliant by Rabada off Jansen - as extras third top-scored for India with eight runs.\nPlayer of the match Elgar said: “You need fast bowlers and a spinner, potentially, to take 20 wickets. You need guys firing.\n“Kagiso Rabada was amazing, and a guy like Nandre just came to the fore. It was a really great team performance.”\n Copy 29/12/2023 10",

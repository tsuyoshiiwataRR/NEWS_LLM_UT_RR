    "text": "Indigo, owner of Scarborough’s largest bookstore, Chapters at Kennedy Commons, says the store is closing permanently on Jan. 27. Its union says the store’s staff, 30 to 40 people in all, are not being offered jobs at other Chapters Indigo stores. Chapters 929 Union organized pickets around the store, an anchor of the Kennedy Road power centre for 24 years, before Christmas and on Boxing Day. In posts on X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram, the union alleges the company is treating Scarborough employees unfairly because they chose to unionize. “We’ve taken care of you, and now we hope you’ll take care of us,” one post said, asking members of the public to call Indigo and support employee transfers and a severance package that exceeds the legal minimum offered. In a statement this month, the company said it makes decisions to close stores based on many factors, including profitability. “As part of our normal business practices, we regularly review and optimize our real estate portfolio,” Indigo said. The company added it is “working closely with all employees to ensure they are fully supported” as the store closes, but a company spokesperson didn’t respond to an inquiry on why transfers were not being offered. A spokesperson for the union could not be reached for comment. Over a quarter century, the Kennedy Commons store hosted many events celebrating books and literacy. A long list of writers, including Scarborough author Catherine Hernandez, have signed a letter protesting the closing. The company, Canada's largest book retailer, still owns the smaller IndigoSpirit store at Scarborough Town Centre and Coles in Eglinton Square.",

Officers found her unconscious and she appeared to be bleeding from her head, the news outlet reported. Her dog stayed at her side.\nThe victim was taken to the hospital where she died a day later on Christmas from her injuries, KTLA reported.\nThe sheriff’s department only identified the victim as an Asian woman between the ages of 60 and 65, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nInvestigators identified the suspect through surveillance footage as Jeffrey Davis, 40, according to KTLA.\n“The person that we had an idea of who was on the security footage is, we believe, a homeless person we’ve had contact with before,” said Sgt.

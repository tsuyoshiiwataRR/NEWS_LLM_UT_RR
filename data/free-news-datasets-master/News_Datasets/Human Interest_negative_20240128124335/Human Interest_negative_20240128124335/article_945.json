    "text": "These city people had a lot to learn about [life in the country](https://cheezburger.com/23433477/we-were-told-we-werent-using-enough-twine-distribution-center-employees-spend-7-hours-wrapping-an). A few years back when everyone was stuck indoors for a year or so, lots of people couldn't handle it. Especially for city dwellers, being cooped up inside made it feel like we were trapped. For people who had the money to do so, moving to the countryside seemed like a great solution. They could be properly isolated from others while actually having space to roam around, garden, or take walks. But since this was such a last-minute decision, folks didn't always think things through all the way. These people, for example, were unhappy with the smells and sounds of [country living](https://cheezburger.com/23654405/we-dont-need-to-check-the-design-builder-tries-to-warn-fuel-company-that-their-blueprints-were). There's not much to be done about that. Farm animals are going to smell a little stinky, and they're going to moo/neigh/oink/cluck accordingly, because that's how they communicate. You can't come to a [dairy farm](https://cheezburger.com/23400453/ill-make-you-watch-me-work-auto-shop-employee-demonstrates-how-slow-their-computer-is-to-their) and tell the farmers to knock these things off. It's their livelihood, and the farmers are totally used to it. Well, these [city people](https://cheezburger.com/23665157/im-just-going-to-have-to-drop-out-then-student-starts-college-a-year-early-to-get-back-at-guidance) realized that the farm life wasn't quite for them. Instead of the peace and tranquility they were probably expecting, they realized that farmers get up at the crack of dawn to work. As the OP, u/Doriantualus, writes, â€œWork started at 5am, tractors and all.\" Apparently the city slickers would rather sleep in than have help with their snow plowing! After you check out this great malicious compliance story, this [student managed to outsmart their principal](https://cheezburger.com/23659525/i-dont-see-how-i-did-anything-wrong-student-reads-the-school-rulebook-to-outsmart-principal) in order to have a snowball fight.

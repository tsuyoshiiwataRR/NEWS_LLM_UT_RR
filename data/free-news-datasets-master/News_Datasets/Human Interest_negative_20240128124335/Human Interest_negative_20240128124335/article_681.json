    "text": "TULSA, Okla. â€” Tulsa Police say they have a suspect in custody after the deadly shooting at Woodland Hills Mall on Tuesday. Tulsa Police are looking for the person they say shot and killed someone outside an entrance at Woodland Hills Mall on Tuesday. Deonte Crump was arrested in connection to the homicide, police say. Police said Crump was arrested at a residence he was staying in near 51st and Memorial. They said it took some convincing to get Crump out of the home, where they found \"good evidence.\" Police are investigating this as a homicide after the victim, 21-year-old Kierstan \"KJ\" Love, died at the hospital. FOX23 spoke with Devin Williams who spent several years working in the school system mentoring youth and who says he knew the victim. \"He kind of deescalated problems. He knows how to joke out of them. I know it started with a fight, that's what gets me,\" said Williams. Williams says he can't imagine the pain Love's family is going through as well as anyone who knew him. \"His life has a lot more value than that. All humans have more value than that,\" said Williams. Williams told FOX23 that he is worried about retaliation and is asking anyone close to the situation to keep calm and let police do their work. \"I think about any of his friends or homies who want to retaliate, that hurts me too. Anyone trying to get in trouble for him, he would be the type of kid who would try and make them feel better about the situation,\" said Williams. TPD Capt. Richard Meulenberg says detectives working the case are speaking with witnesses to identify exactly who pulled the trigger. \"There are still things we have to figure out. I cant get too far into suspect information, but we think we might have an apprehension in the near future,\" said Meulenberg. Police said the shooting happened around 6:30 p.m. and several Tulsa Police officers responded to reports of shots in the mall. FOX23 viewers who were in the mall at the time said they were asked to take cover in the stores, and some stores had locked their doors with staff and customers sheltering inside. Tulsa Police said the victim, identified as Love, was taken to the hospital in critical condition. Tulsa Police Lieutenant Brandon Watkins confirmed Love passed away at the hospital around 10:40 p.m. on Tuesday. Police said two people were arguing just outside of the mall, a fight ensued, and the suspect pulled out a gun and shot Love. The suspect ran away from the mall through the parking lot, police said. Police said this was not an active shooter.",

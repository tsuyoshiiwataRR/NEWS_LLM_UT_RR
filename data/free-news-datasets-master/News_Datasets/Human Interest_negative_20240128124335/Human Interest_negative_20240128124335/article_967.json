    "text": "Dear EA Support Team,\nREPORT PLAYER:[Edit]\nI am compelled to bring to your attention a grave incident involving conduct that flagrantly violates the community standards and ethical gaming norms in Apex Legends.\nDuring a recent gaming session, a player displayed appalling misconduct. This individual not only abstained from any form of teamwork but also resorted to extreme verbal abuse.\nThe language used was shockingly offensive, including blatant slurs directed at transgender individuals and the use of deeply racist terms such as the N-word.\nThis behaviour goes beyond mere poor sportsmanship; it represents a disturbing display of bigotry and hate speech.\nAlthough the attached video is only a segment of the entire incident due to file size restrictions, it provides irrefutable evidence of this deplorable behaviour. It insults the diverse and inclusive community that EA and Apex Legends strive to foster. By allowing such actions to go unchecked, we risk normalizing hate speech and discrimination, inflicting profound distress on marginalized groups, especially the LGBTQ+ community. In light of this, I urge you to conduct a swift and thorough review of this incident and enforce the appropriate disciplinary measures, including considering an immediate and permanent ban on the player's account. The integrity of Apex Legends as a safe and respectful gaming environment is at stake.\nFurthermore, I intend to share this incident across social media platforms to promote accountability and ensure community safety.\nThis is not just about one player's misconduct but about taking a stand against toxicity and discrimination in the gaming world.\nI trust that EA will respond with the seriousness this matter demands and uphold the values of respect and inclusivity that are fundamental to the gaming community.\nThank you for your immediate attention to this pressing issue.\n[Edit: Naming and shaming is against AHQ tos, please don't. The attached N&s name, Id no and picture was removed.]\nSolved! Go to Solution.",

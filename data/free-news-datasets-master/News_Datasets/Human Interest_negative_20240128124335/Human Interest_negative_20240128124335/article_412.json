    "text": "Gerwyn Price was sensationally turfed out of Alexandra Palace by Brendan Dolan as the 'Iceman' melted like a glacier in global warming. In a huge upset, 50-year-old Dolan progressed to the Paddy Power PDC World Championship fourth round with a 4-2 win against the No.5 seed. After his wife, Bethan, sat through a harrowing defeat alone in the players' enclosure, Price - who lifted the Sid Waddell Trophy here three years ago – can have no complaints.

Sky Sports is the only way to watch all the action this year. £22 a monthSky On an Instagram post he wrote: “Absolutely gutted with the chances I gave away tonight, trying too hard and beating myself up. “Just want to say how much I appreciate the crowd that got behind me. Just couldn't get a flow and Brendan took out every chance I gave him. Well done to him and hopefully I'll learn from this.” Look no further than 23 missed darts at a double, Gezzy. That's where your hopes of a second title went south. Do you think we'll see Price back at Ally Pally next year? Let us know in the comments section. Dolan, a popular Northern Irishman who is nobody's mug, was pipped 4-3 by Price at the same stage of the competition three years ago to the day. He milked his revenge like a dairy maid, and who can blame him? Dolan said: “I'm buzzing at the moment, feeling over the moon. I was thinking we might go to a final leg, to reminisce about what happened when we played years ago, but thank God we didn't. “If I go on to win the title, it would be perfect revenge, but it's too early to talk about that. As far as I'm concerned, Gezzy is a class act and he didn't deserve the boos.” Although his reception at the walk-on was mixed, Price cannot blame the crowd for scattering his arrows across the board as if they had been blown off-course by Storm Gerrit. Although he recovered from a supine opening set to level the contest, the Welshman never settled. And although he had not gone out of the tournament before the quarter-finals since 2018, Price played like a man who felt the whole audience wanted him to lose – even though they didn't. The 'Iceman' had revealed, after his first-round win against Connor Scutt, that he had almost withdrawn from the competition because he was apprehensive about fans getting on his back. But no excuses about hostility from the fancy-dress riff-raff – perceived or otherwise – will wash, nor explain, Price's hit-and-miss performance. And his body language was terrible. It wasn't so much Pan's People as Down-the-Pan's People. When Dolan took out 120 to take control of fifth set – his third ton-plus checkout of the night – Price's pained expression was pure despair. He never had control of the contest and got what he deserved.",

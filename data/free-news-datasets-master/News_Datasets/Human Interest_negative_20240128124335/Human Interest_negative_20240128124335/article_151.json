    "text": "(CNN) — Paul Whelan marked five years in Russian detention on Thursday – a grim milestone that the ex-US Marine hoped he would never see.\n“It’s surreal,” Whelan told CNN in a call from his remote Russian prison camp last week.\n“It’s unbelievable to me that I’ve been here five years, that we’ve had two governments that haven’t been able to get me out of here,” he said.\nIn the half-dozen phone conversations Whelan has had with CNN since, he has expressed both confidence that the US government is working to secure his release and immense frustration that those efforts have not yielded success.\n“I would ask President Biden to pull out the stops, cross the red lines, and do whatever needs to be done to get this case resolved and to get me home. If my life is not worth that effort, then I don’t know what is,” Whelan told CNN last week.\nIn recent phone calls, Whelan has voiced exasperation that the US claims his case is “a priority” but has not found a way to bring him home. He has on multiple occasions conveyed a sense of abandonment and concern he will be left behind again, citing the release of two other Americans from Russia in a prisoner swap last year.\n“I am wondering what they’re going to do next. If there’s no diplomatic solution, what comes next? What are they prepared to do to honor that promise to get me home? If they’re just throwing spaghetti at the wall hoping that something sticks and they can come up with a quick agreement, that’s not a very good policy,” Whelan told CNN in late November.\nWhelan has also increasingly expressed fear for his safety, telling CNN last week that he was being targeted by an official at the prison camp after being assaulted by another prisoner.\n‘I would never have come here’ Whelan was arrested in Moscow on December 28, 2018, which he says he visited for a friend’s wedding, and imprisoned on charges of espionage that he has consistently and vehemently denied.\n“If I had known that there would be any sort of problem, I would never have come here,” Whelan said last week.\nHe was sentenced to 16 years in prison in June 2020. He has been serving that sentence at a remote prison camp in Mordovia, where he does manual labor at the prison’s clothing factory.\nWhelan was designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department in May 2020.\nFor Whelan and his family, the anniversary of his arrest is an acute reminder of how much they have lost. But the painful fact that five years have gone by is never far from their minds.\n“This is five years of my life and I can’t get back, five years of my parents’ life that we can’t get back,” Whelan told CNN in October.\nWhelan’s parents are in their 80s, and he told CNN in May, “I know this is taking its toll on my parents and that’s the unfortunate thing.”\n“It’s a concern for me that I won’t see them again,” Whelan echoed in the call last week.\nThe family’s beloved dog, Flora, about whom Whelan spoke fondly during his May call with CNN, passed away the following month.\n“I never thought I would be here not to see my cat, not to see my dog and they both passed away. Relatives have passed away. Friends have moved on. I’m very concerned that I won’t get home to see my parents,” Whelan told CNN last week.\n“It’s been like running through a labyrinth and we’re still not out yet,” said Elizabeth Whelan, his sister. She told CNN in mid-December that the plight has also taken a large financial toll on the family.\nSuccess! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup.\nError!

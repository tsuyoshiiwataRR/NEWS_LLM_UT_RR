    "text": "Arsenal suffered their first home defeat of the season, missing their chance to return to top spot in the league as West Ham United took advantage of a contentious VAR call before defending resolutely in a 2-0 win.\nWest Ham took the lead with their first real attack, Tomas Soucek tucking the ball home from close range after a defensive mix-up from the hosts, but there were questions over whether the ball drifted out of play in the build-up. The visitors were dealt a blow not long after, though, with Lucas Paqueta - who had earlier gone down in the warm-up - limping off.\nArsenal were inches away from a leveller late in the first half when Bukayo Saka shashed a shot against the post, but the second goal was the visitors' too as Dinos Mavropanos headed home against his former club. The hosts launched attack after attack in the second half, with Gabriel Jesus missing a couple of presentable chances and Martin Odegaard stinging Areola's palms, but West Ham hung on and even had time for Said Benrahma to miss a late penalty.\nThe visitors took the lead in the corresponding fixture last season and did so again on this occasion. Their opener owed a lot to some shambolic Arsenal defending as players got in each other's way attempting to clear an Emerson cross, allowing Jarrod Bowen to lay on a tap-in for Soucek.\nArsenal came close to a leveller seconds before the half-hour mark as Alphonse Areola tipped a Saka header over the bar. Saka went close again late in the first half, only for Mavropanos to double the away side's lead.\nAfter beating Arsenal once in the Carabao Cup, they have now repeated the trick in the league. Here are Mirror Football 's talking points as David Moyes got a long-awaited win at the Emirates Stadium.\n1. The finest of margins You can't get much closer than the call which allowed West Ham's opener to stand. Had the on-field officials ruled that the ball drifted out of play before Bowen's touch, that decision might have stood amid inconclusive evidence, but instead the hosts saw Michael Oliver confirm the goal would stand.\n\"The on-field decision is a goal, so they have to find conclusive evidence that the ball has gone out of play,\" former Premier League ref Mark Clattenburg said during Amazon Prime's coverage. \"From the angles I have seen, the ball looks to be slightly in play.\"\nEven after the controversy, though, Arsenal had chances to respond. That they struggled to do so owes a lot to their opponents' defensive efforts.\n2. More Zinchenko questions Oleksandr Zinchenko's attacking quality and link-up play with Gabriel Martinelli have served Arsenal well since the left-back's arrival from Manchester City in 2022. Defensively, though, some questions still remain.\nWith Jurrien Timber and Takehiro Tomiyasu both missing, Zinchenko's place has been a little more secure than at other times. However, the poor communication between him and Gabriel in the lead-up to the opening goal didn't exactly make it more secure.\nOn the bright side, a two goal deficit allowed Arsenal to sacrifice the left-back for another attacking player in the form or Reiss Nelson. Longer term, though, Arteta might be thinking it's time to push Zinchenko into midfield and seek out defensive reinforcements.\n3. Ogbonna stars after coming back in Since suffering an ACL injury in the first half of the 2021-22 season Angelo Ogbonna has been far from a first choice in East London. The Italian international had started just one league game this season before the trip to North London, the win over Brighton back in August, and endured a shaky first start in Europe not long after.\nWith Kurt Zouma and Nayef Aguerd both unavailable, Ogbonna partnered Dinos Mavropanos at the back. There were obviously worse games to give him the reins, with West Ham always expected to defend deeper and see less of the ball against their title-contender opponents, but then you have the challenge of Arsenal's smart movement.\nIn the first half, Ogbonna put in his best performance in some time, and he was forced to dig deep in the second. There was a nervy moment late on as Saka went over the centre-back's challenge, but no penalty was given.\n4. Stars against their former sides Ogbonna's defensive partner came to the Emirates Stadium with a point to prove. One of Arsene Wenger's final signings, the Greek international never got a consistent run of games under Mikel Arteta but moved to East London after impressing in Germany.\nThe former Stuttgart man had a couple of nervy moments against Manchester United on Saturday but the game ended with him celebrating a first Premier League ckean sheet in the Hammers' defence. He started again against Arsenal, meaning Declan Rice wasn't the only man up against a former employer.\nWhen Rice was given his first reunion with the club he captained last season, he did so as a substitute in a Carabao Cup exit. This time he started, and came close to a belter of an equaliser early in the second half only to fire just over.\nMoments later, Mavropanos got his name on the scoresheet. It was his first goal as a West Ham player, and the muted celebration indicated he still had some feelings for the club who brought him to England. There was still more misery for Rice, though, as Arsenal's number 41 conceded a late penalty.\n5. Trossard struggles in change of role With Kai Havertz suspended for the hosts, Leandro Trossard occupied a midfield role rather than his more common spot in the front three. After an underwhelming first 45 from the Belgian, though, some wondered aloud whether Emile Smith Rowe ought to have started in his place.\nArteta didn't seem to agree, though, introducing Nelson and Nketiah in his first double change. Trossard was given freedom to get into attacking spaces, though, and tested Areola with a second-half effort from close range.\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

There was one shot, providing Areola with a comfortable save, though he'll hope for more time when he next plays.\n6. Arsenal dealt title blow Liverpool's Boxing Day win at Burnley left Arsenal knowing the significance of this game. Win and they'd end this round of fixtures in top spot, anything else and Jurgen Klopp's side would hold that honour.\nWhile Mikel Arteta's team dominated te ball early on, they didn't necessarily have the urgency of a team with that much on the line. As West Ham dropped deeper, more opportunities came, but Arsenal couldn't take them.\nNext up for Arsenal is another London derby in the form of a trip to Fulham . They'll need an immediate response to avoid things going from bad to worse.\nJoin our new WhatsApp community! Click this link to receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

    "text": "– EHC Thun’s final dream has shattered\nThe Bernese Oberlanders make up a 0-2 deficit against the higher-class Basel, but lose the cup semi-final game in a penalty shootout.\nPublished today at 10:34 p.m\nThun goal celebration after Fabian Boss’ goal.\nPhoto: Markus Grunder\nDespite the defeat: A calendar year that (almost) couldn’t have been better came to an end for EHC Thun on Thursday. First, the Bernese Oberlanders made it to the playoff final in the MyHockey League (MHL) last season. Despite their incredible bad luck with injuries, they are once again doing well in the current championship. Accidents like the 5-0 loss at home against Frauenfeld can happen. And in the Swiss Cup, Thun knocked two higher-class teams, Bellinzona and the GCK Lions, out of the competition.\nThey will be rewarded for this during the festive season with the semi-final game against the strongest possible opponent remaining in this competition. The opponent is EHC Basel, the current leader of the Swiss League.\nPuck throw-in by Hanspeter Latour\nAn interesting comparison between two teams that are at the top of their leagues and have one thing in common. Neither club wants to get promoted. Not this season. “We’re not ready for it yet. “But everything could look different in a year,” says Basel’s sports director Kevin Schläpfer before the game in Grabengut. The Swiss League could soon become an issue in Thun too. Maybe in a year too.\nBut celebrations can already be celebrated today. Just in the cup. Hanspeter Latour is present and opens the game with the symbolic puck throw-in. In 2004, as coach of Thun’s footballers, Latour defeated FC Basel 4-1 in a memorable game. Can the ice hockey team do the same 19 years later?\nSuddenly Basel leads 2-0\nIn any case, the Basel team take the game and the opponent seriously. You know the qualities of EHC Thun. And he more than holds up for long stretches of the game. Basel is only stronger than the MHL club in the power play, at least for the time being.\nThe EHC Basel is in trouble: Thun is making life difficult for the higher class.\nPhoto: Markus Grunder\nIt is a situation of superiority that gives the guests the lead. The Canadian Jakub Stukel scores. Only 24 seconds have been played in the middle third. Around three turns of the hand, Basel extends its lead. Stukel can once again be celebrated as a goalscorer.\nThun catching up\nThun defends himself and looks for the next goal in the absence of head coach Daniel Steiner. Steiner is currently with the U17 national team at the\nWorld Cup in Finland. Assistant coach Hans Bosshardt is on the boards in the Cup semi-finals.\nMichael Bärtschi only hits the edge of the goal (38th). But then the disc is in. Fabian Boss brings hope back 1:13 minutes before the second half-time siren. Mathys Mojonnier finally equalizes (52nd). The majority of the 1,741 spectators are enthusiastic. Thun is close to 3:2. But there is an extension. Keeper Stephan Küenzi saves the home team from a penalty shootout. In this respect, only Nocola Christen is successful in the Bernese Oberland. Basel scores twice and, like Olten, who narrowly defeated Seewen, is in the cup final.\nRead more: U.S. Senate Passes All-American Flag Act: Ensuring American-made Flags for Federal Government Purchases\nFound an error?

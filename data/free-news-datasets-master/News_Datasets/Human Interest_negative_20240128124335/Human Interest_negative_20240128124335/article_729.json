    "title": "Idaho house where 4 students were killed is being razed. Here’s what happened to other homes linked to notorious killings",
    "text": "The University of Idaho on Thursday began demolition of the off-campus home where four students were fatally stabbed last year — the latest instance in which a property is razed following grisly, high-profile killings.\nEthan Chapin, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen were killed inside the Moscow, Idaho, off-campus rental on Nov. 13, 2022,\nstunning the university and the surrounding community.\nThe owner of the home donated it to the university and the school planned to tear it down in July, before the start of the new academic year. But\nthose plans were delayed until this month, when the university announced attorneys for the suspect, Bryan Kohberger, had been given access to the home as part of their preparations for trial. Prosecutors also accessed the house on Dec. 21, the school said.\nPeople are also reading…\nKohberger has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder, and\nnot guilty pleas have been entered on his behalf. Prosecutors have proposed his trial begin in the summer of 2024.\nThursday’s demolition – taking place during winter break – was expected to last several days, the University of Idaho said in a news release this month. But it could be finished within a day, Jodi Walker, university spokesperson Jodi Walker told CNN.\n“It is the grim reminder of the heinous act that took place there,” University of Idaho President Scott Green said in a news release. “While we appreciate the emotional connection some family members of the victims may have to this house, it is time for its removal and to allow the collective healing of our community to continue.”\nOn the eve of the demolition, the families of Goncalves and Kernodle pleaded with the university and local prosecutors to preserve the home. They argued it may provide evidence during the murder trial, including about how much the surviving roommates may have heard during the killings, according to a joint statement.\nBut neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys have opposed the demolition,\nthe university said, and a prosecutor told school officials in an email the house is “so substantially different than at the time of the homicides” that a jury wouldn’t be authorized to see it.\nWith the house gone, attention can turn to the property’s future. The university intends to create a\nmemorial garden on the site to honor the four students, it has said, and landscape design and architecture students were set to draft concepts for the garden this past fall.\nThe question of what to do with such properties has become distressingly rote in recent years, particularly in the U.S., where communities regularly have to grapple with the scenes of mass shootings, asking themselves how they honor the victims and their families while allowing those left behind to heal and move forward.\nThat’s particularly difficult following\nmass shootings at schools, where students and teachers face the possibility of having to return: For example, Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, was torn down and rebuilt after 26 people, including 20 6- and 7-year-old children, were killed in a shooting there in December 2012.\nBut for decades, communities have faced similar questions about private homes, like the one in Idaho, where notorious killers lived or their victims were murdered. Often these homes are torn down, like the\nSandy Hook shooter’s home, where he lived with his mother – his first victim the day of the shooting.\nHere’s a look at what happened to other homes synonymous with the killings that took place there.\nCharles Manson murders: 10050 Cielo Drive\nIn 1969, five people, including the actress Sharon Tate, were murdered at\n10050 Cielo Drive in what was perhaps the most notorious of the murders carried out by the cult led by Charles Manson.\nThe Beverly Hills, California, home was demolished in 1994, and a new one — a sprawling nine-bedroom, 18-bathroom mansion — was built and completed in 1996. It received a new address.\nThe mansion was put on the market in January 2022 for $85 million, but the asking price has repeatedly dropped over the last 23 months. The sellers are now asking $49.5 million, according to the\nreal estate agent’s listing, which makes no mention of the property’s dark history.\nJohn Wayne Gacy’s home\nThe serial killer\nJohn Wayne Gacy killed at least 33 people, and the remains of more than two dozen of them were found underneath his house near Chicago by investigators following his arrest in December 1978, according to the Chicago Tribune.\nGacy’s home was demolished months later, in April 1979, the Tribune reported at the time. It was a relief to neighbors, including one who told the newspaper, “I’ll be glad when every bit of it’s gone.”\nThe lot was empty for almost a decade, until a new home was erected on the site beginning in June 1988, per the Tribune. Like the Cielo Drive house, the new home also was given a new address.\nThe home of Fred and Rose West\nFred and Rose West abducted, sexually abused and killed a series of girls and young women — two of their daughters among them — between the 1960s and 1980s in England. Fred, accused of 12 murders, died by suicide before he could stand trial, while Rose was convicted on 10 counts of murder in November 1995 and sentenced to life in prison.\nWhen the case broke open in the 1990s, investigators found the remains of many of their victims at their house at 25 Cromwell Street in the city of Gloucester, including in the garden, the basement and the bathroom.\nThe home, dubbed a “house of horrors,” was\ntorn down in 1996. A public walkway has since been built in its place.\nAlex Murdaugh’s hunting estate\nBefore it became known as the site where\nAlex Murdaugh murdered his wife, Maggie, and grown son Paul, the 1,700-acre Islandton, South Carolina, property known as Moselle was the family’s hunting estate – including a house, a cabin and dog kennels where the killings occurred.\nDuring the now-disgraced attorney’s trial earlier this year, jurors visited the estate to help them better understand the crime scene and the prosecution and defense arguments.\nUnlike the other crimes’ sites, however, Moselle is still standing.\nThe estate went up for sale several months after the killings, according to\nCNN affiliate WJCL, and many items from the home were auctioned off soon after Murdaugh’s conviction. He has filed an appeal, which is on hold while his defense attorneys pursue a motion for a new trial.\nThe home was sold for $2.6 million,\nanother affiliate, WCIV, reported in March.\n___\nCNN’s Cindy Von Quednow, Veronica Miracle and Jeffrey Kopp contributed to this report.\n___\nA look at some of the most notorious serial killers in the US since 1970\n1970-2005: Samuel Little\nFebruary-May 1971: Juan Corona\n1972-1978: John Wayne Gacy\n1974-1991: Dennis Rader\n1975-1998: Robert L.

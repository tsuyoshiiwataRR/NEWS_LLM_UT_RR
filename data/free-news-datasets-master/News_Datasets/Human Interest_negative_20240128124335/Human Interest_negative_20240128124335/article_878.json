    "text": "This story is a script ready for a movie. On June 20, 2002, Aza Shuni, a Georgian woman from the small village of Kirtskhe, gave birth to twins. However, due to postpartum complications, she fell into a coma. Then her partner sold the twin. The girls, as young women, did not find each other until years later.\n1. Two different worlds\nGocha Gakharia, Azza's partner, was left alone with their five children shortly after their mother fell into a coma. It was suspected that the twins were the result of Azza's affair with another man. So he came up with a plan to get rid of them and make money at the same time. He decided to sell the young girls for illegal adoption.\nIn this way, each girl ended up in a different house. Well, she lived in Tbilisi, and Taku in Zugdidi, a city in the western part of the country. For years they lived as if they were not twins. When they were 11 years old, they participated in the same dance competition, where everyone's attention was drawn to their great resemblance. But then no one discovered the truth.\nThis only came to light in November 2021. Well, then she received a message from a friend Send her a specific recording. It showed a young woman with blue hair who bore a striking resemblance to Ano. She looked so much like her that many people thought that Anu had dyed her hair.\nIn this way The women learned they were separated twins in childhood. They met for the first time two years ago on the Rustaveli Bridge in the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi.\n-Every person has his own smell. When I hugged her, I felt strangely familiar. Then I heard her voice, even though I knew exactly what her voice was, Anu told Kidspot.com.au.\n– Every day I dreamed of the same little girl dressed in blackTaku added, asking me questions about my daily activities.\n[@sartagnaano]\nDumb and dumber\nThe two women confirmed that they were twins through a DNA test. As their case gains publicity, Taku and Ano's father – the same person who once sold them out – comes forward. The man wants to meet his daughters. However, they announced that this would never happen.\nDo you have news, photos or videos? Send us via\ndziejesie.wp.pl\nRecommended by our experts\n“Coffee enthusiast. Troublemaker.

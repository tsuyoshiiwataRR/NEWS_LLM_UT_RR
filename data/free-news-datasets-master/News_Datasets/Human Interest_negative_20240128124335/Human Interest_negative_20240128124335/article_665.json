    "text": "December 28, 2023 - Los Angeles - Los Angeles Police Department officials report the Department’s Southeast Division robbery detectives announce the arrest of two suspects responsible for a series of armed robberies. On December 18, 2023, around 6:30 a.m., one suspect entered a convenience store in the 800 block of West Rosecrans Avenue. The suspect pointed a handgun at the clerk and demanded money from the cash register. On December 20, 2023, around 6:30 a.m., the same suspect entered a convenience store in the 500 block of West El Segundo Boulevard. The suspect walked behind the counter, pointed a handgun at the clerk, and demanded money from the cash register. Officers arrived and located the suspect’s vehicle, who led officers on a vehicle pursuit. During the pursuit, officers observed clothing and money being thrown out of the suspect’s vehicle window. These items were later determined to be the money taken and the clothing worn by the suspect during the armed robbery. At the termination of the pursuit, officers arrested the driver. Southeast robbery detectives discovered the suspect was responsible for an additional robbery that occurred in the 5000 block of Wilshire Boulevard approximately 2 hours prior. The suspect was identified as Amauje Ferguson, a 27-year-old resident of Nevada. Ferguson was booked for 211 PC-Robbery, with no bail (Booking No.6729653). On December 22, 2023, the District Attorney filed three counts of robbery on Ferguson. On December 24, 2023, around 10:45 a.m., a second suspect entered a convenience store in the 15300 block of South Figueroa Street, pointed a handgun at the store clerk, and demanded money from the cash register. During the investigation, a Tactical Flight Officer with LAPD’s Air Support Division directed officers to the suspect’s location in the 12300 block of South Willowbrook Avenue in Compton, where he was arrested. Officers recovered a firearm, the money taken during the robbery, and the clothing worn by the suspect during the robbery. The suspect was identified as Charles Christopher, a 24-year-old resident of Los Angeles. Christopher was booked for 211 PC-Robbery on $100,000 bail (Booking No. 6731619). Detectives do not believe the incidents involving Ferguson and Christopher to be related. Anyone with additional information is urged to contact Los Angeles Police Department Southeast Area Robbery Detective Christopher Lopez at (213) 485-6914. During non-business hours or on weekends, calls should be directed to 1-877-LAPD-24-7 (1-877-527-3247). Anyone wishing to remain anonymous should call the LA Regional Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (800-222-8477) or go directly to www.lacrimestoppers.org.

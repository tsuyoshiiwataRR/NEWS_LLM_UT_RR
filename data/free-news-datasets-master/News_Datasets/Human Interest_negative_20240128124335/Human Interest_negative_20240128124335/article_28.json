    "text": "Government gives states and territories $10b per year in road funding But the states and territories don't share the road deaths data they gather READ MORE: P-plate driver jailed over Buxton crash that killed five of his mates\nThe Australian government aims to reduce road deaths by 50 per cent by 2030, but the numbers are going up, not down – 1,247 people died in the 12 months to October 31 and more than 100 were hospitalised every day.\nThe Federal Government gives states and territories $10billion in road funding each year, but many organisations and academics say it should be doing more to tackle the death toll using hard data.\nEvery state and territory government collects vital information on road deaths and serious injury, but they don’t share this data with each other, the federal government, independent experts or the public.\nThe Australian Automobile Association (AAA) says this data could save lives and it ‘can be done relatively quickly – governments must not kick the can down the road’.\nBut not one federal Labor politician has signed up to AAA’s campaign to have this data shared, with the association offering an online service where people can ‘find out if your local MP is focused on saving lives or winning votes’.\nAerial scene photo from the site where 10 people died and 11 others were hospitalised after a bus crash in the Hunter Valley, NSW, June 12, 2023\n‘Despite billions spent each year on our roads, deaths are increasing and the data can tell us what is going wrong,’ AAA managing director Michael Bradley said, welcoming the Australian Medical Association’s backing for the campaign.\n‘Doctors and first responders serve on the front lines of the nation’s road safety crisis. They deal with the tragic human outcomes of road trauma.\n‘Politicians should listen to doctors and put safety ahead of secrecy. Using data to save lives is not a political issue. It is simple common sense.’\nAfter falling during lockdown, the number of road crash deaths have been rising again across the world as countries emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThough there are theories that being locked down for so long made people less patient with other drivers and more likely to speed and take other risks, the reality is much simpler.\nMore cars on the road and more kilometres being driven means more crashes, more deaths and more serious injuries.\nLives lost and lives ruined\nThe crashes, lives lost and lives ruined throughout the past 12 months in Australia have been relentless.\nIn June, 10 people died in Australia’s worst road crash in decades when a bus carrying people home from a wedding reception rolled in the NSW Hunter Valley.\nIn December, a P-plate driver who killed five teenage school friends when he crashed a speeding ute in 2022 was jailed for at least seven years.\nThe sentence given to Tyrell Edwards, 20, was called ‘absolutely disgusting’ by victims’ relatives outside Campbelltown District Court in south-western Sydney.\nIn November, five members of two young families were killed when an SUV ploughed through a packed pub beer garden in Daylesford, Victoria.\nThe driver, William Herbert Swale, allegedly ignored nine alarms notifying him his blood glucose was low in the hour before the crash.\nMelbourne Magistrates’ Court also heard that Swale had previously received 32 penalty notices, largely for excessive speed.\nAcademic and road safety expert Professor Raphael Grzebieta was astonished that Swale was still allowed to drive.\n‘We’ve got some real fundamental problems in terms of how to control people who are recalcitrant, habitual, recidivist speedsters, drinkers and drug users who put our general population at risk,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.\n‘When it comes to road safety, for some reason, we seem to exempt people with allowing them to do this.\n‘How many cases have I heard where someone was a recidivist alcoholic and (the authorities) didn’t stop them from driving.\n‘They were driving and they wind up killing someone as a result of that. These criminal aspects of the law need to be tightened up a lot more.’\nSpeed kills\nMark Stevenson, a Professor of Urban Transport and Public Health at the University of Melbourne said the problem of speeding has not changed much from before, during or after the pandemic.\n‘We have got some unique data where we’ve followed thousands of drivers, pre-Covid and post-Covid, and in that data we show that the speeding and other elements haven’t changed significantly at all over that period,’ he said.\n‘There’s this perception that Covid changed how people drive. But from what we’re seeing in that data that doesn’t hold up as a hypothesis.’\nBut even if driver behaviour has not worsened, it is still a huge factor in the carnage on Australian roads.\nAn academic said undivided rural roads should have a maximum speed limit of 80km/h. A road with a 100km/h road sign is pictured\n‘Speeding, fatigue, drink driving and drug driving remain leading contributors to these tragedies – all behaviours within drivers and riders’ control,’ a Transport for NSW spokesperson said.\nProf Grzebieta said reducing speed limits on many roads would save lives, if only politicians had the will to do so.\n‘The one thing that’s really important here is the default speed on rural roads,’ he said.\n‘The speed limits on rural roads are just too high for those roads that don’t have appropriate infrastructure.\n‘So, undivided roads which don’t have median barriers, which have unsealed shoulders and are without any tactile rumble strips.’\nHe said such roads should have a maximum speed limit of 80km/h.\n‘That’s really the absolute limit of survivability if you have a head-on crash or you run off the road and hit a tree or an embankment.’\nAcademic and road safety expert Professor Raphael Grzebieta (pictured) is passionate about saving lives through better legislation\nThe professor explained that cars are designed for survivability of a head-on crash travelling at 64km/h.\n‘That’s what they’re tested to, 64km/h (is) where you walk away from the crash, you’re shaken, but you walk away from the crash.\n‘And then up to about 80, there’s various levels of survivability. At 80km/h, you may have time to do a bit of braking and reduce your speed to 70 or 60.’\nHe said 80km/h ‘is the absolute limit’ that should be allowed on undivided rural roads.\n‘If you’re on a high risk road, your chances of having a crash and trying to survive are low if you’re traveling at 90 or 100.’\nResidential streets\nProf Grzebieta said for suburban streets, speed limits should be set to a maximum of 40km/h.\n‘At the moment, the default is 50. In the Northern Territory it’s a crazy 60,’ he said.\n‘It’s just too high and it should be set to 40km/h, because at night when you’re driving your car in a built-up area, you have to set it to low beam.\n‘The major feeder roads have sufficient lighting, but in residential streets the lighting’s not so good and you won’t see a pedestrian with low beam.’\nA pedestrian’s chances of surviving being hit are 10 times higher if the speed limit was reduced from 50 to 40, he said.\n‘If you hit someone at 50km/h (there’s) a 60 per cent chance that they will wind up getting killed,’ Prof Grzebieta said.\n‘However, if you set the speed at 40, which is a reasonable speed for such residential streets, you will spot the pedestrian just in time to apply your brakes and reduce the speed of your car to 30.’\nAt that speed, he said, ‘that’s equivalent to falling off the roof of your house. That’s the sort of survivability, with about a 6 per cent risk of fatality.\n‘So that’s why I’ve been pushing for 40km/h speed limit for residential streets, 80 for (lower grade) rural roads that … and that’s what it should be set nationally.’\nProf Grzebieta said: ‘If you’re on a high-risk road, your chances of having a crash and trying to survive are low if you’re traveling at 90 or 100.’ Speed limit signs are pictured on a freeway\nThe difficulty of getting change\nProf Grzebieta said any plans to have speed limits reduced nationally would lead to a ‘huge pushback from WA, from the Northern Territory, parts of the outback of NSW and Queensland. They’ll kick up a stink.\n‘(But) until the regulators start doing that, you’re not going to reduce the fatalities on our roads, they just simply won’t come down.’\nHe said Victoria has done better than the other states in reducing fatalities on its roads.\n‘They’ve got terrific roads. They’ve been installing wire rope barriers everywhere.\n‘They’ve got strong enforcement in terms of point-to-point speed cameras and covert speed cameras … and their fatalities have been coming down over the years.\n‘So the things that Victoria do, NSW and Queensland and other states should adopt.’\nBut he said NSW is ‘not keen on adopting covert speed cameras’ and that both the Coalition and Labor ‘have been using road safety as a political football’.\n‘It’s crazy. They’re about to increase the speed limit in the new WestConnex tunnel (in Sydney) from 80 to 90km/h.’\nThat was a change agreed to by the NSW Premier Chris Minns during the election campaign earlier this year.\nBut Prof Grzebieta said ‘that’s a real no-no. The whole world knows that you shouldn’t go above 80km/h in a tunnel.\n‘You saw that very clearly in Victoria all those years ago when they had that massive truck crash and the fire and people died.’\nThe Burnley Tunnel crash in March 2007 killed three people. Black smoke poured from stacks above it and the fire – which was estimated to be more than 1,000 degrees – melted one of the vehicles involved beyond recognition.\n‘They immediately reduce their speed to 80km/h (in tunnels) and nothing’s happened since,’ the academic said.\nHe pointed out that in NSW, ‘They’re putting signs in front of their mobile speed cameras. I mean, that’s nuts when you think about it.’\nMost people want hidden speed cameras\nProf Grzebieta said that it is just a ‘small minority’ of people who complain about having hidden speed cameras.\n‘The majority of NSW agree with it. The small minority … want to be allowed to break the law,’ he said.\nA car driven by a 66-year-old man from Mt Macedon ploughed into patrons seated in the courtyard of a bar in Daylesford, Victoria (pictured)\nA police officer hugging a therapy dog at the scene of the Daylesford crash\n‘It’s a really simple formula. Just don’t go over the speed limit and you’re fine, you won’t get fined.’\nA Transport for NSW spokesperson said the state government is ‘committed to lowering road trauma … with the road map set out in the 2026 Road Safety Action Plan.\n‘It sets new targets to halve deaths and reduce serious injuries by 30 per cent on NSW roads by 2030 as well as actions to contribute toward achieving these targets.’\nDaily Mail Australia contacted federal Transport Minister Catherine King for comment.",

    "text": "Former GOP candidate for U.S. Senate in Washington State Tiffany Smiley joins Fox Across America With guest host Jason Chaffetz to shed light on why the U.S. military is currently facing a recruiting crisis. “There’s a lower percentage of individuals that are serving and most of those that join the military are from military families. So I believe we need to expand that. We need patriotism back in this country. And we need a Commander-in-Chief who’s strong, who leads from a place of strength, peace through strength. And unfortunately, sort of what I was talking about at the beginning is Joe Biden showed weakness on the world stage with the failed departure in Afghanistan, deeply hurt our military families. You know, to see how much so many families have sacrificed. I mean, we have friends who have been in Afghanistan more than they have in the United States of America and away from their families. And to watch that failure on the world stage is just set us up to be stretched thin. We’re not meeting our recruiting goals. There’s not a sense of strength and peace through strength. Right? And that starts at the top. That’s in any organization. And if our Commander-in- Chief is showing weakness on the world stage, I mean, our military families are the ones holding us up and they’re the ones that are exhibiting courage and bravery every single day in the face of an administration that is unable to stand up and show the world that we are a shining beacon on the hill. It is our military families that are absolutely doing it day in and day out.” Listen to the podcast to hear what else she had to say to Jason!

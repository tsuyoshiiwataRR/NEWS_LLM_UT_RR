    "text": "2023-12-29 00:17:13 Couple Lucas Michel Published 45 minutes ago, Updated now Odegaard and his partners were defeated by the very compact Hammers. PETER CZIBORRA / REUTERS A successful Seagulls corrected Spurs while the Gunners were trapped at home by West Ham at the end of Boxing Day on Thursday evening. Successful in December, Tottenham fell back into their ways this Thursday at Brighton (4-2), at the end of Boxing Day in the Premier League. Mitigated by two late goals from Veliz (82nd) and Davies (86th), this rout prevents Spurs from climbing back into a top 4 abandoned in November after an idyllic start to the season. But this was the Tottenham of November, the one so easily overwhelmed in defense and so imprecise in attack. Or unlucky, like Richarlison, the man in good form in recent matches, who hit the post before having two goals refused for offside (46th, 62nd). Opposite, Brighton will therefore have benefited at great cost. First by the young Hinshelwood (12th), brilliantly served by the untenable Joao Pedro, author of a double on penalty (23rd, 76th), his favorite exercise. Enhanced by Estupinan’s missile (63rd), the Seagulls’ big success allows De Zerbi’s squad, despite having been suffering for two months, to move up to 8th place, with six Spurs units still as unpredictable. Frustrated by Areola, Arsenal misses the lead Later, the curiosity of the last meeting lay in the identity of the fall champion. Leader at Christmas, like last year, Arsenal had the opportunity to finish as autumn champions by winning against West Ham. Missed. Trapped at home by their London neighbor (0-2), the Gunners will have experienced an evening in line with their rival from north London. To a lesser extent, certainly, but the ambition was quite different. Except that the very solid West Ham team, having regained confidence for several months, decided otherwise. Showered by a first goal on the verge of Soucek (13th), the locals were picked up again on their return from the locker room, on a helmet strike from a veteran of the house (Mavropanos, 55th). #Arsenal #misses #header #Tottenham #slapped #Brigton",

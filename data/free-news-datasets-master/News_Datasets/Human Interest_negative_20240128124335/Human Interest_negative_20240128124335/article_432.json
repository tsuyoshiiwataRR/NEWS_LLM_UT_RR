    "text": "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., as commander-in-chief, leads the celebration of the 88th anniversary of the Armed Forces of the Philippines at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City on Thursday, Dec. 21, 2023. Also present were AFP Chief Romeo Brawner Jr. and Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro. PHOTOS BY MIKE ALQUINTO\nMORE Filipinos are dissatisfied with the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the latest survey conducted by Publicus Asia Inc. showed.\nThe Pahayag End of the Year survey, conducted from November 29 to December 4, showed a noteworthy shift in pro-administration sentiment, which declined from 50 percent in the third quarter to 46 percent in the fourth quarter.\nThe polling firm said that anti-administration sentiment remained stable at 18 percent, while those adopting a neutral stance increased from 30 percent to 36 percent during the same period.\n“Economic concerns, including price inflation, joblessness, low wages, and a perceived lack of productivity, emerge as driving factors behind the changing political landscape,” Publicus Asia said in a statement.\n“These issues, left unaddressed by the administration, have prompted a notable migration of pro-administration voters towards neutrality,” it added.\nThe National Capital Region (NCR) witnessed a significant drop in pro-administration sentiment from 49 percent to 33 percent, while Mindanao and North-Central Luzon (NCL) showed declines of 51 percent and 49 percent, respectively.\n“Notably, neutral sentiments increased across regions, indicating a shift towards non-partisanship,” Publicus Asia said.\nThe polling firm added that anti-opposition sentiment has decreased from 40 percent to 32 percent, with a notable increase in neutral sentiments from 42 percent to 47 percent.\n“The Duterte effect persists, with the Opposition Party grappling with discreditation from the previous administration,” Publicus Asia said.\nRegionally, pro-opposition support remained relatively stable, experiencing marginal increases in the NCR, NCL and Mindanao.\n“Anti-opposition sentiment declined across all regions, showcasing a shift towards neutrality,” it added.\n“The proportion of Filipino voters adopting a neutral stance towards the opposition has notably increased in NCR, Visayas, and Mindanao,” Publicus Asia said.\nThe Pahayag 2023 End of the Year Survey was non-commissioned.\nThe poll was conducted using purposive sampling composed of 1,500 respondents randomly drawn from the market research panel of over 200,000 Filipinos maintained by the Singapore office of PureSpectrum.\nThe sample was restricted to registered Filipino voters maintained by PureSpectrum, a US-based panel marketplace with a multinational presence.",

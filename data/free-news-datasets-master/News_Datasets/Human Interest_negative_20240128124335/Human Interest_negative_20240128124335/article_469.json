    "text": "Hall-of-fame broadcaster, author and Kansas State University professor Ian Punnett died Dec. 22, 2023 from a genetic non-alcohol-related liver disorder. He was 63.\nStudents and faculty who knew the professor took to social media to tell stories of working with Punnett. Many mourned, expressed gratitude or simply wrote, “Rest in peace.” Others talked about Punnett’s care for students and his ability to get the best out of them.\nPunnett held many titles throughout his career. He joined K-State’s A.Q. Miller School of Journalism and Mass Communications in 2018, and he last served as the chief operator and faculty adviser for the university’s student radio station, Wildcat 91.9 FM.\nIn that role, Punnett led his students at Wildcat 91.9 FM to win the best college/university radio station in the nation for schools with more than 10,000 students at the 2023 Intercollegiate Broadcasting Awards ceremony.\nPunnett also was known for his work on the national radio show “Coast to Coast AM” for the past 24 years. Listeners across the country heard him in several capacities, including regular weekend hosting duties, his own spin-off show “Coast to Coast LIVE with Ian Punnett,” a podcast entitled “Vaudeville for the Frightened” and most recently, twice-monthly hosting duties.\nLisa Lyon, the executive producer at Coast to Coast AM, echoed his students’ words of mourning and gratitude.\n“I’ve had the privilege of producing for Ian these past 24 years, and I will miss our friendship and the professional collaboration,” Lyon said in a statement. “Every conversation behind the scenes was as lively and entertaining and everything we strive for on the air. Ian was great radio personified.”\nPrior to his time there, Punnett co-hosted rock morning radio shows on WXLP in the Quad Cities, on then-rock music station WKDF in Nashville, Tennessee in the 1990s and was also the morning man on WMJY in Long Branch, New Jersey.\nPunnett then moved to talk radio at WGN in Chicago in 1994 and then Atlanta in 1997 to host a nightly talk show. In Minneapolis-St. Paul, Punnett hosted the morning show on KTMY-FM. It was known as “The Ian and Margery Show,” and was co-hosted by his wife, Margery Punnett.\nWhile still working in radio, Punnett earned a master of divinity degree from Columbia Theological Seminary in Atlanta. He then completed his Ph.D. in 2017 at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communications.\nIn October 2023, Punnett was inducted into the Kansas Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame.\nPunnett published a book on theology, “How to Pray When You’re Pissed at God,” and was co-author of “How Millennials Can Lead Us Out of the Mess We’re In.” He also wrote true crime stories, children’s books and of course, a book on journalism.\nHe is survived by his wife and two sons, Cam and Garr Punnett.",

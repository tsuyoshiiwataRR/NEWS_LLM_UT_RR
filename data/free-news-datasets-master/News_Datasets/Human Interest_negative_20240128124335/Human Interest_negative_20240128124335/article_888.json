    "text": "Karan Johar has had enough of the trolls! Lashing out at one for suggesting that he should bring home a 'bahu' for his mom, the director shared that he finds such comments the most 'offensive.'Karan Johar slams trolls targeting him and his momTaking to Instagram stories, the B-town director responded to a comment that read, \"Bahu laa do maa ko time pass nahi hota hoga.\" Stating that he finds such comments the most offensive, Karan wrote, \"Firstly, no 'bahu' should be a time pass for anyone's mother. A bahu is a label which comes with ridiculous regressive baggage. She is an individual in her own right and can pass her time how she likes, personally and professionally.\" Coming to his mother's defense, the filmmaker further added, \"Also, to everyone, I would like to add, my mother co-parents my children with me and doesn't need any 'time pass'. Her life is complete by the love we receive from her and we do our best to give it back. And bringing in a 'bahu' is not an option to whoever is concerned about my relationship status! If I were to have a partner, I would do so to fill my void, not anyone else's.\" For the unversed, the Johar family is often targeted by trolls as Karan Johar, who is unmarried, welcomed his twins Yash and Roohi via surrogacy.ALSO READ: On Salman Khan's Birthday, Karan Johar REVEALS They Are Set To REUNITE 25 Years AFTER Kuch Kuch Hota HaiKaran Johar's professional lifeKaran Johar made his directorial comeback, after seven year, with Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh starrer Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani.

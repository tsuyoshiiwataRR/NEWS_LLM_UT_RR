Using [data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/APU000074714)(released in April 2020), we analyzed the average price for a gallon of unleaded regular gasoline from 1976 to 2020 along with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for unleaded regular gasoline from 1937 to 1976, including the absolute and inflation-adjusted prices for each year. Read on to explore the cost of gas over time and rediscover just how much a gallon was when you first started driving.

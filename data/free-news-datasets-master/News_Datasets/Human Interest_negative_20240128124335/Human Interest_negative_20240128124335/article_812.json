    "text": "On Thursday, the cross examination of a psychiatrist who concluded a man who fatally shot his best friend in McKinleyville was operating under severe delusions wrapped up. Deputy District Attorney Candace Myers asked Dr. Robert Soper several questions about his medical conclusions regarding the mental state of Jasen Coley, who fatally shot 25-year-old Kenneth “Michael” Davis on July 3. Soper said that Coley met the requirements for a not guilty by reason of insanity verdict – which would send Coley to a state hospital, rather than a 15-year-to-life prison sentence – and Myers wanted the specifics on how he reached that conclusion. Soper said that, while Coley’s specific documented delusions might have changed over time, the paranoid psychosis was consistent. “He was having the same reported symptoms before he murdered anybody,” Soper said. Coley had been hospitalized at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in February for suicidal ideation and paranoid delusions. In previous testimony, Dr. William Darby – appointed at Myers’ request – said Coley told him he killed Davis because “gray aliens” in the woods he would visit told him to do it. Soper said he concluded Coley killed Davis out of a delusion that it would protect his family from getting their organs harvested, wealth stolen and being human trafficked. However, Soper said that Coley never specifically told him Davis was an alien, though Darby testified that Coley believed Davis was either an evil “black alien” or aligned with their nefarious goals to harm his family. Myers pointed out that in the interview with law enforcement shortly after Coley’s July 6 arrest, Coley never mentioned aliens or the illuminati as a reason he killed Davis. Soper said this detail is unsurprising. “What’s going on in his head is very different than what comes out of his mouth,” Soper said. Myers also asked, if Coley was protecting his family, why would he only kill Davis instead of others he implicated as threats, including other members of the Davis family and his friends? Soper responded that Coley was deeply psychotic and was not operating on logic. However, Soper said that Coley understood the nature and reality of his actions – a split from Darby – in the sense that Coley knew what he was doing was a crime and that if he fired a gun at Davis, it would kill him. Myers also narrowed in on a comment Coley made during the police interview in which he said he was “going to hell” for killing Davis, even saying “of course,” when asked if he knew that killing Davis was wrong. Soper said he didn’t put too much stake in these comments because of Coley’s delusion that Davis would harm his family – in texts, Coley said the Davis family planned to put his family on a desert island and let them starve to death – and that Coley was morally obligated to protect them, even if he understood that generally killing is illegal and wrong. “You’re (Myers) looking for consistency here and there’s no consistency, it’s not logical,” Soper said. By the Times-Standard’s print deadline, Myers was finishing her cross-examination and Michael Robinson, Coley’s attorney, was preparing for redirect. Coley has been present for proceedings from the county jail, where he remained since his arrest. The Davis and Coley families were also in attendance.

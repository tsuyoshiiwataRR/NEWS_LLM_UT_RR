    "text": "Mitch Kenny blames trolls for social media stitch-up Star's Instagram account posted about 'Boxing Day lines' Footy fans roasted the Panthers star on social media\nPenrith Panthers hooker Mitch Kenny has issued an explanation for a social media post referring to ‘Boxing Day lines’, insisting it’s the result of ‘trolls’ taking his phone.\nAn Instagram story was posted from Kenny’s phone on Tuesday showing a photo of the 25-year-old alongside the caption: ‘Couple Boxing Day lines have got me in troubleeee’.\nDoing lines is common slang for using cocaine or other drugs that come in powdered form, such as speed.\nDaily Mail Australia does not infer that Kenny made the post, has ever used drugs, had any knowledge that the post was being made, or gave his permission for the post to be published.\nThe post on the Panthers star’s Instagram account raised eyebrows with footy fans\nPenrith and the NRL are aware of the image, with the governing body saying they are ‘liaising’ with the Panthers.\nFooty fans were were stunned and had a field day on social media arguing about exactly what Kenny was talking about.\n‘Nuhh fair play Mitch Kenny has been shopping all day trying to score some deals but the shops were making people wait in lines and he had enough of it and fired up,’ wrote one X user.\nMitch Kenny has explained his social media post about ‘Boxing Day lines’ was the result of ‘trolls’ taking his phone and putting the message up without his knowledge or permission\nOther fans posted memes and comments that Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to publish because they incorrectly infer guilt.\nReturning to Instagram hours later, Kenny cleared up the situation, posting: ‘Happy New Year guys. Enjoy and ignore trolls who grabbed my phone. Happy New Year.’\nKenny, who scored in the NRL grand final against Brisbane, was one of the unsung heroes for the Panthers last season.\nHe made his debut for the club in 2019 as part of the part-time squad while also working as the club’s groundsman.\nKenny learned much of his craft from ex-panthers teammate Api Koroisau, who was the No.1 hooker at the club.\nIn 2023, Kenny found himself as the starting hooker after Koroisau’s move to the Tigers, and thrived in the role.\n‘There has been a few ups and downs,’ Kenny told 7NEWS before Penrith’s historic premiership three-peat.\n‘I was part of the team for most weeks last year, which was pretty special, and got to win a comp which I will remember forever.\nKenny issued an explanation for the post on his Instagram account (pictured)\nKenny (pictured right) recently visited New York with some of his Penrith Panthers teammates, including Nathan Cleary (left)\n‘This year has been a different story for me, more minutes and more importance with what I’m doing, if I don’t play well it’s a lot more noticeable.\n‘There has been a lot of learnings, but I’ve loved it.’\nDuring the off-season Kenny has been having a well-deserved break, and was spotted in November partying in New York alongside teammates Nathan Cleary and Damon McCarthy.",

    "text": "CHANTILLY, Va. — A [16-year-old boy accused](https://www.google.com/search?q=wusa9+chantilly+sexual+assault&rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS932US932&oq=wusa9+chantilly+sexual+assault&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg7MgYIAhBFGEAyBggDEEUYO9IBCDQwOTNqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) of breaking into a woman’s home in Chantilly and attempting to sexually assault her is in jail, according to Fairfax County Police. The 73-year-old victim told WUSA9 that the teen, whom she’d never met before, knocked on her door around 10:30 p.m. on Saturday. She assumed it was a neighbor who needed help, but once she opened her door, the victim said the suspect forced his way in and demanded her car keys. “I told him, ‘You have to leave, you have to leave,’” the victim recalled. “He started shoving me around. He was putting his hand over my face and tackling me from the back and shoved me into the bedroom and shoved me onto the bed.” The victim alleged the suspect threatened to rape her. “I was really struggling to keep him off of me,” she said. “I was struggling to keep him from grabbing my clothes.” Prior to being shoved in her bedroom, she called 911 using her landline. However, she claimed the teen knocked the phone out of her hand. Chief Kevin Davis said because he didn’t turn off the landline phone, the open line helped 911 operators guide officers to the home. “She answers the door with the 16-year-old standing immediately behind her who right off the bat, is pretending to be her grandson and trying to talk over the elderly woman at our patrol officers,” Davis said. Davis credited the officers for following their instincts and asking several questions before eventually detaining the teen suspect, whose name isn’t being released because of his age. The teen is charged with Burglary with the Intent to Rape, Abduction with the Intent to Defile, Preventing a 911 call, and Assault and Battery. “I'm very, very, very grateful,” the victim said. “I could've been very seriously hurt.” Detectives are asking anyone who has information about this incident to call our Major Crimes Bureau at 703-246-7800, option 3.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, 10% of adults over 60 in the country experience some form of abuse each year. Studies show about two-thirds of elder abuse victims are women. The number of victims is likely higher since only about one out of every 24 cases is reported.",

    "text": "GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert's decision to ditch her home district won't solve a problem likely to haunt the Colorado Republican like Beetlejuice, according to a new political analysis. The Independent's John Bowden argued on Thursday that the firebrand's flight to Colorado's District 4 — and away from [two well-funded competitors in District 3 ](https://www.rawstory.com/lauren-boebert-campaign-2666806788/)— does not mean Boebert will face an easy campaign in 2024. \"She’s the only incumbent House member running (so far?), giving her an advantage in name recognition and an established base of support in the state,\" Bowden writes. \"Those advantages are not ironclad by any means.\" Also read: [Kari Lake hits Nikki Haley in fight for VP: Trump 'would pick anybody over her'](https://www.rawstory.com/kari-lake-nikki-haley/) Boebert may be the only incumbent House member running so far, but the name recognition she brings comes with its own burdens, Bowden argues. \"The congresswoman’s undignified exit from a live-action performance of Beetlejuice earlier this year earned her viral ridicule on an entirely new level,\" writes Bowden, \"including [a round of mockery](https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/2023/10/late-night-tv-hosts-return-with-jokes-about-donald-trump-taylor-swift-lauren-boebert-and-more.html) from America’s late-night hosts.\" Boebert is opting to run for the seat currently occupied by Republican colleague, Ken Buck, who has announced he will retire. In an online video statement, Boebert said she did not arrive at the decision easily. “A lot of prayer, a lot of tough conversations and a lot of perspective convinced me that this is the best way I can continue to fight for Colorado, for the conservative movement and for my children’s future,” she said.

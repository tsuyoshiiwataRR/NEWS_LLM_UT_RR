    "text": "NEW YORK , Dec. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ --\nWHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, continues to investigate potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of Maison Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ: MSS ) resulting from allegations that Maison Solutions may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public.\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Maison Solutions securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. The Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses.\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the prospective class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=21393 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] or [email protected] for information on the class action.\nWHAT IS THIS ABOUT: On December 15, 2023 , Hindenburg Research published a series of social media posts shorting Maison Solutions. Hindenburg Research also stated its belief \"that retail shareholders will once again be left holding the bag on a massively overvalued company that has become bloated in size due to illegal and nefarious pumping/manipulation.\"\nOn this news, Maison Solutions' stock price fell $12.71 per share, or 83%, to close at $2.50 per share on December 15, 2023 .\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm , on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/ .\nAttorney Advertising. Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome.\nContact Information:\n Laurence Rosen, Esq. Phillip Kim, Esq. The Rosen Law Firm, P.A. 275 Madison Avenue, 40th Floor New York, NY 10016 Tel: (212) 686-1060 Toll Free: (866) 767-3653 Fax: (212) 202-3827 [email protected] [email protected] [email protected] www.rosenlegal.com\nSOURCE THE ROSEN LAW FIRM, P.

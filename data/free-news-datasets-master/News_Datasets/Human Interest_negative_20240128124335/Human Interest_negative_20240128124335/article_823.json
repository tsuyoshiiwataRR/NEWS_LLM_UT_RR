    "text": "Who Is Nicholas Godejohn, Gypsy Rose Blanchard's Ex-Boyfriend? In a surprising turn of events, Gypsy Rose Blanchard, the Missouri woman at the center of a chilling murder case, has been released from prison three years ahead of her scheduled release date for the June 2015 murder of her mother, Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard that she orchestrated with her then-boyfriend Nicholas Godejohn. Let's take a look at where he is now. While his defense aimed for a lesser charge, citing Gypsy's influence, Godejohn was ultimately convicted of first-degree murder and armed criminal action. Photo : Twitter In a surprising turn of events, Gypsy Rose Blanchard, the Missouri woman at the center of a chilling murder case, has been released from prison three years ahead of her scheduled release date for the June 2015 murder of her mother, Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard that she orchestrated with her then-boyfriend Nicholas Godejohn. Gypsy Rose and Nicholas' Tumultuous Relationship Gypsy met Nicholas Godejohn on a Christian dating site in 2013. For two years, their online connection seemed like a budding romance, filled with dreams of a shared future. However, text messages revealed a darker side, rife with plans for escape and Dee Dee's demise. Their first real-life encounter led to Godejohn's fateful 2015 trip from Wisconsin to Missouri. On June 9th, while Dee Dee slept, Godejohn entered the home and, as Gypsy hid in fear, brutally ended her life. Following the murder, the pair fled with $4,000 of stolen money and checked into a Days Inn outside of Springfield before fleeing to Godejohn's family home in Wisconsin by bus, only to be apprehended soon after. Who Is Nicholas Godejohn? Godejohn, with no prior history of violence, claimed he acted out of \"blind love\" for Gypsy, fulfilling her desperate desire for freedom. He was only 26 years old when he committed Dee Dee's murder. However, the Wisconsin man had a history of mental illness and a criminal record for indecent exposure when he and Gypsy met on the internet. He also reportedly told Gypsy that she must be “respectful” of him at all times and to capitalize his name while texting him. 'Blind Love' and Manipulation Godejohn's trial focused on Gypsy's alleged manipulation. While his defense aimed for a lesser charge, citing Gypsy's influence, he was ultimately convicted of first-degree murder and armed criminal action. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole plus an additional 25 years for armed criminal action. Godejohn is currently serving a life sentence at the Potosi Correctional Center. In August of 2022 The Springfield News-Leader reported that Gypsy had married a man named Ryan Scott Anderson of Saint Charles, Louisiana, that June. This case, shrouded in manipulation and tragedy, exposed the dark side of online relationships and the devastating consequences of parental abuse.

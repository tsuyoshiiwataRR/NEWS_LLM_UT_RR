However, Arsenal need to buck that trend this winter and make a signing that they won't win the title without.\nREAD MORE Transfer news as Man Utd receive Greenwood bid and Chelsea strike January deal [BLOG]\nKonstantinos Mavropanos haunted Arsenal on Thursday. (Image: Getty) Moyes breaks nightmare streak Before this evening, Moyes had never won a Premier League game as a manager away at Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester United in 72 attempts.\nHe had only gone without a league victory against Chelsea (23 games) longer than Arsenal, drawing four and losing 18 of his previous meetings.\nBut Moyes ended that nightmare run by ending the Gunners' 13-game unbeaten streak at home in all competitions, stretching back to a 3-0 loss to Brighton and Hove Albion in May.\nArsenal had won their previous seven games at the Emirates by an aggregate score of 21-2. It's an excellent result for West Ham just days after their 2-0 triumph over United.\nBecome an Express Premium member\nSupport fearless journalism\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free\nGet super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial More VAR controversy for Arteta Arteta was left furious after a controversial goal that saw Newcastle United beat Arsenal 1-0 earlier in the season.\nThere was mass debate over whether Joe Willock had kept the ball in play during the move, which ended with Anthony Gordon scoring the winner.\nThis time, VAR couldn't provide a definitive call on whether Jarrod Bowen had kept the ball in before assisting Tomas Soucek's opener. Therefore, Michael Oliver's on-field decision stood.\nKonstantinos Mavropanos - who joined West Ham in a £19million deal in the summer - came back to haunt his former club Arsenal by heading in the second after half-time.\nDON'T MISS\nArsenal duo blocking Liverpool transfer as Man City fear deal haunting Guardiola [TRANSFERS]\nArteta 'blocks three January exits' as Arsenal boss risks souring relationships [NEWS]\nMan Utd outcast Jadon Sancho spotted in rare footage as PSG 'make transfer call' [FILMED]\nArsenal need a new striker in January.

But it's fair to say he wouldn't have expected to have already lost twice to his ex-employers this term.\nRelated articles Man Utd receive transfer response as Erik ten Hag 'eyes second January deal' Man Utd have already agreed Mason Greenwood plan after '£40m transfer snub'",

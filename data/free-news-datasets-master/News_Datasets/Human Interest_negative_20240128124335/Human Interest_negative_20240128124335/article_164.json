    "text": "A 52-year-old man has been charged with lewd behaviour in front of teenage girls at St Kilda in Melbourne's southeast.\nDetectives arrested the man at Preston in Melbourne's northeast on Thursday, after Victoria Police in October called for the public's help to find the person behind incidents in the St Kilda area on Boxing Day, 2022 and January 8, 2023.\nBoth allegedly involved a man approaching teenage girls then exposing himself and performing a lewd act.\nThe first incident happened on Beaconsfield Parade at Middle Park, and the second happened near the water on the popular St Kilda beach, police alleged.\nOfficers raided a home at Heidelberg Heights in Melbourne's northeast and seized a number of items before they arrested the man, who was charged with a total of 13 offences.\nThe charges included performing a sexual act in the presence of a child, directing sexual activity at another person, sexual exposure and committing offences while on bail.\nThe 52-year-old was granted bail to face Melbourne Magistrates Court on Friday.\nLISTEN to the new podcast Court in the Act\nInside the courtroom with Tim Clarke.\nFind out more",

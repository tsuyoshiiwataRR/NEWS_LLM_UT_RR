    "text": "A young Melbourne man was slammed by his mum READ MORE: Therapist reveals common things everyone struggles with in secret\nA young man got into an argument with his mother over laundry – and thousands of adults are facing the same issue.\nAnthony Voulgaris, from Melbourne, revealed that while he plans to live with his parents until he’s 50, he still wants to do his own washing every week.\nThe Greek and Italian man claimed that living with his European parents was often tricky due to their customs.\n‘I suggested to my mum that I start doing my own washing every week – that I get my own washing basket,’ he said in a video. ‘I’m a 22-year-old male and I fully know how to do washing, so it’s not like I would ruin the washing machine.’\nHe added, ‘I then received a ten-minute lecture on how rude and disrespectful I am, and that I don’t appreciate the things that are done for me.’\nMr Voulgaris did not expect to receive such dramatic backlash for his simple suggestion.\n‘All because I wanted to wash my own clothes,’ he sighed.\n‘Living at home with my European parents is going good,’ he joked. ‘Every day I count my blessings.’\nA few in similar situations shared the ‘toxic’ repercussions of the culture.\n‘You’re in a transactional relationship with your parents,’ one said. ‘They believe they can treat you the way they do because of the things they do for you. I had this for 43 years of my life.’\n‘I’m paying rent with my mental health,’ a woman wrote.\nAnthony Voulgaris, from Melbourne, revealed that while he plans to live with his parents until he’s 50, he still wants to do his own washing every week\nOthers in the same boat revealed their own experiences.\n‘And then tomorrow you’ll wake up to her loudly cleaning the house, and when you ask what’s wrong she’ll say no one helps her,’ a woman said.\n‘I’m 20 and I don’t even know how to do my washing because my Indian parents never let me wash my own clothes,’ a man wrote.\nA woman revealed, ‘I told my dad I want to move out next year and he started crying. I’m 25.’\nOthers wished their parents helped them as much.\n‘Meanwhile I’m the eldest daughter in a Greek family and I have to do everyone’s washing,’ one said.\n‘I’m European and was made do every bit of my own housework from age seven,’ another added.\n‘I wish my Australian dad was like this. I was out all day yesterday and he was home. I get home and he whinged that the house work isn’t done,’ a woman said.\nA few suggested clever ways for Mr Voulgaris to work around his dilemma.\n‘That’s why l have a washing basket in my room and do my washing when my mum isn’t home,’ one revealed.\n‘Why even ask? You’re probably familiar with her washing schedule, just do yours the day before,’ another advised.\n‘Why are you still living at home at 22!? Move out already!’ a third wrote.",

(IROZ GAIZKA / AFP)\nA preliminary investigation into sexual assault and violence at the Hôtel du Palais in Biarritz (Pyrénées-Atlantiques) was opened by the Bayonne public prosecutor’s office on Thursday December 28,\nlearned France Bleu Pays Basque. No complaint had been filed, the prosecution took matters into its own hands. Of the “images” of a “concerning incident that took place on the hotel premises” ont “circulated” on social networks, indicates the American group Hyatt which manages the site. Michelin-starred chef Aurélien Largeau, dismissed Thursday December 21, for its part refutes the existence of a “humiliating hazing of a kitchen assistant”.\nThe hotel group states in a press release that “This incident does not reflect the values that we all defend, an investigation was carried out and the appropriate decisions were taken.” “I would like to formally deny the allegations made against me,” answers Aurélien Largeau. “I condemn any form of mistreatment, hazing or humiliation within the brigades and more broadly, and I will never associate myself with such behavior.” he continues, indicating that he is preparing his defense with his lawyers in order to “stop the defamation”.\nView comments\nRead more: The Steam version of the yellow-haired masterpiece \"NTRaholic\" will be released in May, and \"After Stories\" will be added in the future talk | 4Gamers\n1703800807\n#investigation #opened #sexual #assault #violence #palace #Hôtel #Palais",

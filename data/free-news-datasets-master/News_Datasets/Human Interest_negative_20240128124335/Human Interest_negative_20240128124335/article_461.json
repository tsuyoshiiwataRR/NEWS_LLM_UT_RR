    "text": "The man who died in a Christmas Eve shooting at The Citadel mall has been identified as 18-year-old Teryus Thomas of Colorado Springs. The El Paso County Coroner's Office conducted an autopsy of Thomas and will determine the cause and manner of his death, according to a Thursday morning news release from the Colorado Springs Police Department. Currently, his death is being investigated as a homicide, police said. This is the 35th homicide in Colorado Springs this year. At this time in 2022, there were 54 homicides, police said. The shooting began as a fight between two groups of people that escalated into gunfire shortly before the mall was set to close at 5 p.m. on Christmas Eve, police have said. Thomas was found dead in the mall from an apparent gunshot wound, police said in the release. Two other men who were critically injured in the shooting are now in stable condition. A female who was transported to a local hospital Sunday night with minor injuries from the attack was treated and released, the Gazette reported Tuesday. Colorado Springs Police spokesman Ira Cronin previously said the investigation indicates the shooting was an isolated incident, the two groups were known to each other and there is no ongoing threat to the community. The department has not announced any arrests related to the shooting as of Thursday afternoon. Police are still actively investigating the incident. Anyone who has information about or is a witness to the shooting is asked to call the Colorado Springs Police Department at 719-444-7000. Callers who wish to remain anonymous can call the Crime Stoppers Tip Line at 719-634-7867 or 1-800-222-8477. The Christmas Eve shooting is the latest act of violence at the southeast Colorado Springs mall that opened in early 1972. The Citadel has [a history of escalating gun crimes and violence](https://gazette.com/news/crime/13-citadel-mall-related-shootings-a-timeline-from-recent-years/article_da1ed19e-dd8d-11ed-9eea-9f2a3814e7ac.html) that dates back to at least early 2016, when three people were injured in a drive-by shooting. Four people have died in shootings on mall property, including in one officer-involved shooting, since a parking lot fight ended in a double murder on March 25, 2022. The Men of Influence, an anti-violence community group in Colorado Springs, will hold a rally at the mall on Saturday at 1 p.m. to condemn the recent deadly shooting and to promote peace through community collaboration. Event organizers aim to unite Colorado Springs residents with city and state leaders at the event to \"stand against violence\" and \"(foster) an environment of peace, empathy and understanding,\" a Thursday morning news release from the group states. The organization was founded in 2020 to bring together current and former gang members, as well as other Colorado Springs residents, to open lines of communication and prevent violence locally. \"Our goal is to have support and solidarity for folks working inside the mall, vendors doing business inside the mall, and also to have a place our kids and families can go and feel safe,\" said Shaun Walls, a founding member of the Men of Influence and vice president of the nonprofit activist group Chinook Center. \"The mall is a center for a lot of us. We have memories there and a lot of us grew up at The Citadel. We hate to see the things going on recently.\" Walls said he isn't sure exactly what changes need to be made to foster and promote safety at the mall, but residents must have a voice as the city seeks solutions. \"Nothing can happen for our community without the community being represented or present there,\" Walls said. Colorado Springs Councilwoman Nancy Henjum, who represents the city's fifth district where The Citadel is located, said she plans to attend Saturday's rally and is having conversations with neighbors, the mall's manager and a shopkeeper, Colorado Springs Police Chief Adrian Vasquez and Men of Influence representatives about the recent violence. \"People are very concerned, understandably. I'm looking forward to the rally, very much focusing on accountability for ourselves, for our kids, for our neighbors, for our friends and for our public spaces, and really working to reclaim peace in those areas,\" Henjum said. The rally is currently planned to take place inside the mall's food court.",

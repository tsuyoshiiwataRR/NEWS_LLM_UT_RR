    "text": "Two young boys from Antioch killed last week in a late night hit-and-run collision were identified publicly by authorities Thursday. Amahje Amenike, 13, and Arsenio Rabb, 12, both died after being taken by ambulance to a hospital following a vehicle crash that happened at about 11:30 p.m. on Dec. 22. Police said two cars collided at W. 6th Street and G Street in the downtown area and the driver of one of the vehicles fled. Police have not made an arrest, nor provided any information about a suspect. They said they believe at least one of the vehicles was speeding and that reckless driving may also been a reason for the crash. The older boy appeared to spend at least some of his time in San Francisco. Teachers at the city’s James Denman Middle School stated in an online fundraiser that Amenike was a student and basketball player there. The fundraiser had raised about $11,460 by Thursday afternoon. It was seeking $15,000 for funeral and other expenses. “Amahje was the kind of person who made everyone around him smile,” fundraiser organizer Nicole Ambrosio wrote on the page. “A smart, kind, funny kid with a bright future. He was a great athlete and a good sport. A wonderful friend and teammate. A beloved brother and son.” Antioch police Lt. Rick Martin said in the hours after the crash that the department is seeking information and asked people who may know anything to contact him at 925-779-6972 or the department at 925-778-2441.",

    "text": "Katie Perinovic murdered her three young children before killing herselfClaire, 7, Anna, 5, and Matthew, 3 perished in the Tullamarine home in 2021Tom Perinovic had been sending photos of television sets to his wife at the timeMr Perinovic is suing his wife's doctor and hospital for negligenceREAD: Could Dan Andrews' lockdowns be the blame for the unthinkable\nGrieving father Tom Perinovic will see out the New Year with renewed determination as he plans to hold accountable those he believes left his children to die at the hands of their delusional mother.\nKatica ‘Katie’ Perinovic, 42, murdered her children Claire, 7, Anna, 5, and Matthew, 3 one by one before taking her own life inside their Tullamarine home, north-west of Melbourne, on January 14, 2021.\nTheir dad, who had been out buying his family a new television set when the atrocity happened, will head to court next year seeking damages from his wife’s general practitioner Dr Abid-Ur Rahman and Melbourne Health.\nFather Tomislav Perinovic (left), the children and Ms Perinovic. Mr Perinovic has been left devastated by the tragedy\nAs Mr Perinovic prepares to seek justice for his children, Daily Mail Australia can reveal heartbreaking details into the little lives lost.\nClaire was described by her aunty Maria as ‘pure joy’.\n‘She had a beautiful personality. She was beautiful, kind, caring, gentle, considerate, thoughtful, smart and funny,’ Maria told Victorian Coroner Audrey Jamieson during a hearing in November last year.\n‘She was always happy and smiling. The best big sister and big cousin.’\nClaire’s little sister Anna was described as the family’s ‘little entertainer’.\n‘Cheeky, very funny and was a jokester with a great sense of humour,’ Maria said.\n‘She loved to learn new things and couldn’t wait to start school… she even wore her school uniform on orientation day.\n‘She was so motherly and loved looked after her younger cousins. We miss her sucking her finger and dummies.’\nThe two sisters had a passion for music and loved dancing together.\n‘I miss watching their performances together,’ their shattered aunty told the court.\nDetectives arrive at the crime scene on January 14, 2021. The carnage inside was described as ‘gruesome’\nMatthew had been the little brother they had all wished for.\n‘His two older sisters loved him so much and he loved them,’ Maria said.\n‘He loved his cars, monster trucks, playing in the sand and digging, superheroes and wearing his superhero costumes.\n‘He was a sweet boy, kind and caring.’\nThe children had loved nothing more than being at home playing together in the backyard.\nRiding their bikes and scooters up and down the driveway, they had been a postcard example of what appeared from the outside to be a perfect family.\n‘They all loved painting, doing Play-Doh and drawing together. They loved going to the beach, swimming classes, bike riding, and playing in the park,’ Maria said.\nIt was the lifeless and bloody body of little Matthew that Mr Perinovic found first on that dreaded day.\nMatthew had been his father’s shadow.\nWhen Mr Perinovic arrived home he found his son in the front lounge with injuries to his head and arm.\nUnaware the remainder of his family lay dead in another room, he called Triple Zero.\nWhile paramedics worked on Matthew, Mr Perinovic went into the rear living room and saw what his wife had done.\n‘They’re all dead,’ he told paramedics.\nA view of the backyard where the Perinovic family was killed\nPeople continued to leave flowers outside the Tullamarine property for weeks on end\nMaria told the court her brother is now a broken man.\n‘How will he ever trust another person after what his wife did,’ she told the coroner.\n‘I worry that people judge him, and if they are unkind to him.\n‘For men there is always a stigma about how he treated his family which is unfair. Tom was a loving, supportive, kind, loyal and hardworking father and husband.’\nIndeed, Mr Perinovic was initially arrested at the scene, with the media not being told for a full day that he had not been the killer.\n‘Media was not told immediately that he didn’t do it, it was 24 hours later. This was not good enough,’ Maria said.\n‘Everyone thought he was a guilty man, who murdered his family. His image was all over the media.’\nMr Perinovic had been so distraught he could not even converse with the detectives that barked questions at him.\n‘When the police came there were so many people, and I was in a state of shock that I couldn’t speak,’ he told the court.\n‘I was just lost for words, and it was incomprehensible to me what I had just seen in my home.’\nShackled in handcuffs, he was taken away in an ambulance as paramedics tried to calm him down.\n‘The police treated me unfairly. I was immediately handcuffed. The male paramedic treated me in the ambulance while I was still handcuffed,’ Mr Perinovic said.\n‘There were so many faces and detectives questioning me outside on the nature strip in front of everyone in the street. I even recall one policewoman yelling at me during this traumatic experience.’\nKatie Perinovic, 42, murdered her children while their father was out on a shopping trip\nMr Perinovic said the trauma of that day would haunt him forever.\n‘Living with the loss of my entire family I still just can’t believe my wife would do this to our lovely, beautiful kids,’ he said.\n‘After it happened, I was scared to go anywhere. I continue to be paranoid and uneasy around knives.\n‘I still have nightmares, and flashbacks to what I saw that day. I have to live with this forever.\n‘I have wanted to end my life numerous times. The hurt and pain never leave me. I’m angry and sad most days. I hope that one day I can help others that have gone through a trauma like this.’\nIn a brief writ filed with the Supreme Court last week, Mr Perinovic’s lawyers claim his pain was caused in part by the alleged negligence of Dr Rahman and NorthWestern Mental Health Service.\nVictoria had been in the grip of what would become the longest Covid-19 lockdown on the planet when Katie seemingly lost her mind.\n‘There was a huge negative impact during the Covid lockdown on our family and particularly Katie. We were unable like others in Victoria to see our family and friends for so many months,’ Mr Perinovic told the coroner.\nUntil Victorians were locked down, Katie had been a successful physiotherapist.\nIsolated from her family and friends, her mental health rapidly declined.\nCurtains at the property can be seen closed. Tom Perinovic suspected all was not well inside. He was right\nWhile Katie found the strength to return to her beloved job in October 2020, she resigned just weeks later under a cloud of mystery.\nShe had worked at the very same clinic for the previous 16 years.\n‘A few days after she resigned, I got a phone call from her boss, saying ‘your wife needs help. Go see a doctor. I can’t tell you what she’s done.’ And that was it,’ Mr Perinovic told the coroner.\n‘He said, ‘you haven’t been looking after your wife.’ I asked in what way? He was saying she needed mental help. I have no idea what happened at her work, and I have no idea what her boss was talking about.’\nConcerned over her own mental decline, Katie went to see her local doctor, Dr Rahman.\nBy then she had been feeling paranoid, exhausted and anxious.\nShe had earlier told her husband she believed she was being covertly watched by CCTV cameras within their own home.\nDr Rahman prescribed her sleeping pills and sent her home, prompting Mr Perinovic to return with her the very next day in the hope of having her treated properly, the court heard.\nWith her husband by her side, Katie was referred to the Royal Melbourne Hospital’s mental health department, NorthWestern Mental Health.\nClaire, 7, Anna, 5, and Matthew, 3 were all slain by their own mother inside their home\nTom Perinovic had been texting his wife asking her for an opinion on television sets he was looking to buy for the family\nBut her mental health continued to spiral out of control as the lockdowns continued.\n‘Ultimately, Covid restrictions meant I was unable to come into most appointments with Katie and I would have to wait in the car or not attend. I was unaware of what was happening in Katie’s appointments or her treatment plan, unless Katie told me what was happening,’ Mr Perinovic told the coroner.\nWhen Mr Perinovic eventually worked his way inside a consultation with his wife, she asked him to leave in what he would later learn had been the midst of a ‘psychotic episode’.\nWith less than a month before her murderous rampage, Katie overdosed on her medications.\nShe refused to go to hospital, telling her doctor the following day she had simply wanted to sleep.\n‘He was in an angry mood with us. I didn’t know why. He said, ‘I want you to hide the medication, and give it to her every day.’ It was his idea for me to manage the medication. I listened, and I hid it in garage and locked it,’ Mr Perinovic told the court.\nKatie’s mental health practitioner would only learn of the suicide attempt after she had already killed her family.\n‘There was no discussion, or anything mentioned explicitly about the kids being at risk of harm,’ Mr Perinovic said.\nJudge Jamieson found the treatment given to Katie was ‘suboptimal’, but stopped short of linking her death to the care of Dr Rahman.\n‘I find no causal link between North Western Mental Health and Dr Abid-ur Rahman’s treatment of Katica Perinovic and her decision to take her own life and that of her children,’ she found.\n‘I do, however, find that the mental health treatment that was provided to Katica Perinovic to be suboptimal in the circumstances.’\nFor confidential support please call LIFELINE: 13 11 14 www.lifeline.org.au, Suicide Call Back Service: 1300 659 467 or 1800RESPECT",

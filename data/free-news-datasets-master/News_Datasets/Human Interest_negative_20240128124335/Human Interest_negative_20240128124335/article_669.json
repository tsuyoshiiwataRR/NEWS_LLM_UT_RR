    "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nDec 28, 2023\nMedia Contact: Melissa Garriga | [email protected] | 228-990-4168\nEast Bay CODEPINK and Local Peace Organizations Stage Dramatic Shutdown of Travis Air Force Base in Protest Against Military Support to Israel Fairfield, CA — In a demonstration of dissent, East Bay CODEPINK, in collaboration with other local peace organizations, executed a shutdown of Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, CA, on Tuesday, December 28th. The coalition rallied to draw attention to the base's alleged active involvement in shipping military supplies directly to Israel, thereby contributing to the ongoing genocide in Gaza.\nThe protest, which unfolded at the North Gate road entrance, saw participants blockading the entrance as they voiced their concerns about the base's complicity in supporting actions leading to a devastating impact on Palestinian lives. Fairfield Police, in conjunction with military police, initially issued warnings for the protesters to disperse, and it wasn't until approximately half an hour later that arrests were made for unlawful assembly.\nAt least a dozen peace activists were taken into custody. They were transported to Solano County Jail in Fairfield and charged with unlawful assembly.\n\"The majority of casualties are children. No matter what happened on Oct. 7, this is wrong,\" asserted, CODEPINK member Toby Blome. She continued, \"Many consider the area an open-air prison, worse than the ghettos in Warsaw during World War II.\"\nCynthia Papermaster, another CODEPINK member, told the media covering the protest that she lays awake at night thinking about this.\n“I am not the only one. Many of us can't sleep thinking about what is going on over there,\" she said. \"It is horrible. They are going to wipe out all the Palestinians.\"\nTravis Air Force Base, recognized as the largest transport Air Force base in the U.S., has become a focal point of concern due to its alleged role in aiding and abetting Israel's relentless bombing of Gaza. The base is accused of being complicit in the loss of over 20,000 Palestinian lives, including more than 8,000 children. Gaza's infrastructure has been devastated, with 1/2 to 1/3 of homes destroyed, leaving civilians, hospitals, ambulances, hospital workers, and journalists as repeated targets.\nThis act of civil disobedience underscores the growing discontent within the community regarding the base's activities and its contribution to the ongoing crisis in the Middle East. The coalition calls for a reevaluation of the base's operations and urges a reexamination of the military support provided to Israel. East Bay CODEPINK and its partners remain steadfast in their commitment to advocating for peace and justice on a global scale.\nFor media inquiries, please contact: Melissa at [email protected]\n###",

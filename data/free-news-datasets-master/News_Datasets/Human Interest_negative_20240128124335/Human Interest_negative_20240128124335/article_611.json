    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nBuffalo Bills linebacker Von Miller said allegations of domestic violence leading to his arrest last month are \"100% false\" and \"overblown\" while addressing the situation for the first time publicly on Thursday (December 28).\nMiller, 34, turned himself in to the Glenn Heights, Texas, Police Department on November 30 and was booked into the DeSoto Tri-City Jail after being accused of assaulting his pregnant girlfriend.\n\"Obviously, there are things that I can't talk about but everything that was out is completely wrong and blown out of proportion,\" Miller said via Syracuse.com 's Matt Parrino . \"Me and my girlfriend, we have problems just like any other couple does, but there has never been any of those things that was alleged against me. Hopefully over time, all of this stuff will get cleared up. Sometimes life just ... be life-ing. You've just got to keep pushing and keep moving. The people who know me and the people who have been around me know my character, they know who I am.\"\nMiller was reportedly accused of shoving, pulling the hair and putting his hands around the neck of his girlfriend, according to an arrest warrant affidavit obtained by NBC 5 Dallas Fort Worth .\n\"My boyfriend was choking me, hitting me, pulling my hair, I have bruises all over me, my hair- my hair's out,\" the woman told a dispatcher in the 911 call obtained by WFAA .\nThe woman later sent a text message to WFAA downplaying the allegations, claiming she and Miller were \"fine\" and described the incident as \"a verbal disagreement\" and \"a huge misunderstanding.\"\n\"No one assaulted anyone,\" she texted. \"This is insane. And sad.\"\nThe incident reportedly took place at Miller's Dallas home at about 11:00 a.m. on November 29 when \"Miller and the victim got into a verbal argument and the suspect assaulted the victim,\" Dallas Police said.\nMiller reportedly left his home before officers arrived at the scene. The woman told police that the argument started at around 10:50 a.m. when she and Miller, who is currently on a bye week, had a disagreement over travel plans.\nThe woman reportedly went to a home office and slammed the door, at which point she claims Miller got upset and told her to leave. The victim said she tried to gather her belongings before Miller began to \"shove and push her, all while telling her to leave.\"\nThe woman said she pleaded to get her phone and laptop, at which point Miller took out his own phone and recorded the altercation as he continued to push and shove her toward the door. The woman said she pleaded for Miller to stop, acknowledging that she was pregnant, but he reportedly continued to push her, stepped on her feet and caused her to fall back into a chair, at which point he grabbed her by the neck for three to five seconds before letting her go.\nThe woman said she was in pain but didn't experience any difficulties breathing at the time. Miller then reportedly grabbed the victim's phone, threw her laptop on the floor and stomped it before pulling her by her hair, which resulted in a chunk being ripped out and causing her to fall to the ground.\nThe woman said she was then able to start recording the incident on one of her two phones, which she put in her pocket, before Miller continued to push her onto a couch and again placed his hands around her neck. The victim then told Miller she was calling the police, at which point he left their home.\nResponding detectives said they saw minor abrasions on the woman's left hand and bruising on her neck, which were consistent with her assault claims. The victim also reportedly showed investigators a video in which Miller is heard yelling at her to get out during the alleged incident.\nThe woman told police that she was six weeks pregnant and shared a photo of a positive pregnancy test, as well as text conversations with Miller that showed he was aware of the pregnancy. The victim was not transported to a hospital, but received treatment for minor injuries sustained during the attack at the scene.\nMiller, who suffered a torn ACL late in the 2022 season, has appeared in eight games and recorded two tackles in 2023. The former Texas A&M standout signed with Buffalo last offseason after splitting the 2021 season between the Denver Broncos -- with whom he had previously spent his entire career -- and Los Angeles Rams, having won his second Super Bowl in February 2022.\nMiller is a three-time first-team All-Pro, four-time second-team All-Pro, eight-time Pro Bowler and a member of the NFL 2010s All-Decade Team.",

    "text": "A Dallas County grand jury has indicted a clerk for a justice of the peace on misdemeanor charges of forgery for allegedly faking a hearing notice used to evict a Mesquite woman, according to court documents filed Dec. 23. Lutishia Williams, 53, is accused of fabricating a hearing notice in August 2022. The notice was used as a basis to evict Chantel Hardaway, a Mesquite mother who claimed in a lawsuit that she never received the hearing notice.\nAdvertisement Related: Mother who says court faked eviction hearing notice still waiting for justice Advertisement The hearing notice alleged to be fake is a Microsoft Word-generated document dated June 14 and signed by Williams.\nBreaking News Get the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\nEmail Address By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\nSUBMIT Williams is the chief clerk for justice of the peace Margaret O’Brien, who previously denied any wrongdoing by anyone in her court.

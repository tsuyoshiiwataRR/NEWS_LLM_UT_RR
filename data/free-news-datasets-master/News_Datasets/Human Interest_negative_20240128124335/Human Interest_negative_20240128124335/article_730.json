    "text": "WAKESHMA TOWNSHIP, Mich. â€” An alleged West Michigan shooting has turned into a swatting investigation. Michigan State Police and Kalamazoo County deputies were called to Wakeshma Township at 11 a.m. Thursday after someone called about a shooting. That call, however, was found to be illegitimate, prompting authorities to investigate the alleged shooting as a \"swatting call,\" according to state police on Twitter. Swatting, according to [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/swat), means to make a fake report of an ongoing crime to \"elicit a response from law enforcement (such as the dispatch of a SWAT unit).\" \"MSP would like to remind residents that these calls tie up valuable resources and are taken seriously,\" troopers said in a statement. \"This case will be investigated to its fullest extent to identify & hold accountable those responsible for this incident.\" Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call Kalamazoo Silent Observer at 269-343-2100 or the Michigan State Police Paw Paw Post At 269-657-5551.",

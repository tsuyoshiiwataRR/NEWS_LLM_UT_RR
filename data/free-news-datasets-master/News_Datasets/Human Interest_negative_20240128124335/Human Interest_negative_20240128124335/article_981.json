    "text": "Albert William Brown, obituary ROCKPORT — Albert William Brown, passed away on December 19, 2023, with his loving family at his side after a long battle with Alzheimer’s Disease. Al was born in Reading, Massachusetts, on July 27, 1940, one of seven children born to Cyrus and Delphine Brown. He spent his childhood in Reading and would go on to graduate from Reading High School with the class of 1958. From there, Al worked with National Poly Chemical until entering the US Army in September 1963. He served his time in Germany as a driver for a Colonel and received his Driver and Mechanic Badge and an M14 rifle sharpshooter merit. After returning home, Al met Pamela Brown (nee Wadsworth). They were married and lived in Wakefield, Massachusetts. Al spent many years in the industrial and mechanical insulation industry and joined the Association of Heat & Frost Insulators & Allied Workers Local #6 union, becoming a proud lifelong member. After several years of living in different places, they found their way to Pam’s childhood home of Camden, Maine, and settled in nearby Rockport with their two children, Michelle and Chris. They bought a local Camden restaurant called Ferrari’s and ran it successfully for nine years until they decided to sell the business, semi-retire, and spend winters in Florida. Post-retirement, Al would team up with his brother-in-law Carl Griffith and cousin Charlie Millett to become legendary handymen in Gulf Coast Florida and the Midcoast area. After spending many years summering in Rockport and wintering in Florida, they moved back to Rockport full-time to be closer to family – including their two granddaughters, Michelle’s children, Isabella and Maren. Al enjoyed fishing and often traveled all over Maine with close friends and family. We’re certain he fished every river and stream in the State of Maine. Cribbage was a favorite pastime; he was well-known for his humble wins. Al passed his love for the game on to his children, Michelle and Chris, who now carry on that tradition – maybe not the “humble wins” part. He loved telling stories about his childhood trips to Prince Edward Island (where his parents were originally from). Above all, Al cherished time with his granddaughters, Isabella and Maren, who adored their Papa. His face lit up whenever they entered the room. Al is survived by his wife, Pam of Rockport; daughter Michelle, her husband, David Kinney and their daughters, Isabella and Maren Kinney of Lincolnville; son, Chris Brown of Camden; two brothers, Leonard Brown of Hudson, New Hampshire and their daughters, Laurie and Lisa, Tom Brown, his wife Nona, and their daughters, Lorri and Colleen of Reading, Massachusetts; sister, Helen LeBlanc, her husband Harry, and their daughter, Alicia of Lynnfield, Massachusetts; nieces, Jodi Brown Collins and her husband, Kenan; Donna Brown Freedlender and her husband Eddie; sister-in-law, Pat Griffith, her husband Carl of Lincolnville, and their sons, Tom and Jason. He also loved being an uncle to all his grand nieces and nephews and cousins no matter how far removed. In addition to his parents, Al was predeceased by two sisters, Marilyn, and her husband, Bob McCaughey, Lorraine; a brother, Joe, and his wife, Pat; a sister-in-law, Evelyn Brown; and his in-laws, Orion and Barbara Wadsworth. At the request of Al and his family, arrangements for a celebration of life will be announced at a later date. Memorial gifts may be made to PAWS or the Camden Area District Nursing Association. Condolences and memories may be shared at [www.longfuneralhomecamden.com](http://www.longfuneralhomecamden.com). Arrangements are with the Long Funeral Home & Cremation Service, 9 Mountain Street, Camden.

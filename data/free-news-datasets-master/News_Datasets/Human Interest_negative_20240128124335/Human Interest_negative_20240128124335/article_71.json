    "text": "Maine blocked Donald Trump from its primary ballot, making it the second state to do so. JUPITER, Fla. (CBS12) — The family of a man who died from an electric shock in a fountain at Harbourside Place two months ago filed suit against the establishment, requesting over $50,000 in damages. In the [tragic events](https://cbs12.com/news/local/electrocution-fountain-nathaniel-davenport-father-electrocuted-police-report-released-in-jupiter-harbourside-place-electrocution-149-soundings-avenue-october-31-2023#) October 22, [multiple people were shocked](https://cbs12.com/news/local/adult-electrocuted-others-injured-shocked-fountain-area-recover-three-juveniles-harbourside-place-jupiter-florida-monday-oct-23-2023-update#), including children of Amy and Nate Davenport — [the deceased husband, father of four and veteran](https://cbs12.com/news/local/nate-davenport-victim-electrocution-fountain-passed-away-father-husband-identified-fatal-jupiter-harbourside-place-investigation-florida-october-26-2023#). The subsequent investigation revealed [other people had been shocked](https://cbs12.com/news/local/electrocution-fountain-jupiter-nathaniel-davenport-attorney-says-others-were-also-shocked-in-the-same-fountain-at-harbourside-place-splash-pad-jupiter-police-department-november-1-2023#) by the same fountain only months before the fatal incident. See also: [Construction worker dies five days after violent, overnight hit-and-run, suspect still at large](https://cbs12.com/news/local/louis-vixon-construction-worker-dies-five-days-violent-overnight-hit-and-run-suspect-still-at-large-west-palm-beach-police-department-searching-vehicle-visible-damage-florida-december-28-2023#) The lawsuit was filed Wednesday morning in Palm Beach County court with the lawyer for the family issuing a statement: Harbourside Place also released a statement in response to the Davenport family's filing: Our first concern continues to be with the family as they go through and deal with this tragic loss. We know how tough this tragedy is for this beautiful family and we pray for them during this time. Had Harbourside known there was an issue they would have moved immediately to fix it. Harbourside had no knowledge whatsoever that there was any problem with the fountain. We are confident that the true facts will become known during the legal process. In the over 70-page lawsuit, it states Harbourside Place had a \"non-delegable\" responsibility to keep its premises, including the grounds, building fountains, fixtures, electrical equipment and more in safe condition. The Town of Jupiter Building Department's investigation into the electrocution concluded light fixtures within the fountain were not kept up to proper standards. The town's case said some of the light fixtures within the \"electrified fountain\" were \" [leaking electrical voltage](https://cbs12.com/news/local/nate-davenport-harbourside-place-fountain-wire-dina-fleck-expert-richard-johnson-shares-view-why-electric-current-investigation-jupiter-town-building-department-florida-november-2-2023#).\" The directors, managers, supervisors or representatives at Harbourside Place should've been aware known of the hazardous state the fountain was in. Both Amy and her children suffered \"devastating mental pain, suffering, sorrow, grief and distress,\" the Davenport family's lawsuit said. The family will continue suffering the loss of Nate's \"companionship, love, guidance, support, services, instruction and protection\" for the \"remainder of their lives,\" the documents read.",

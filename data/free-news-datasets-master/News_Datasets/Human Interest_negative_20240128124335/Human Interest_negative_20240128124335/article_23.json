    "text": "Tourists visiting a 400-year-old fairytale bridge in North Wales have been slammed after calling for hand rails to be installed on the crossing as part of a health and safety crackdown.\nThe historic beauty spot – described as being like something ‘straight out of a Harry Potter novel’ – was used as a 17th century packhorse crossing before being awarded grade II-listing as a scheduled monument.\nThe rolling stone arches, in the village of Mallwyd, near Snowdonia, North Wales, are covered in grass with the Dyfi river running underneath it.\nDay-trippers have now sparked a furious row for suggesting safety barriers should be installed at the site.\nOne visitor said: ‘If health and safety see that, it’ll have to be fitted with handrails and a high-grip surface.’\nTourists visiting a 400-year-old fairytale bridge in the village of Mallwyd, North Wales, have called for barriers to be installed across the historic beauty spot\nThe bridge, named Pont Minllyn, is off limits to the public but can be viewed from a nearby footbridge\nThe fairytale bridge is located in the village of Mallwyd, near Snowdonia, North Wales\nAnother said: ‘They should put up some metal barriers, someone could get hurt.’\nA third added ‘gorgeous, but too unsafe,’ while a fourth joked ‘don’t go drinking if you live there’.\nThe bridge, named Pont Minllyn, is under the care of Welsh heritage body Cadw. It is off limits to the public but can be viewed from the adjacent footbridge.\nCalls for handrails, however, have been shut down by locals and nature lovers alike who say it will spoil the peaceful spot.\nOne said: ‘Without safety rails people tend to pay more attention and look after themselves better. With rails, they tend to blame someone else for falling off the bridge.’\nThe bridge, pictured from the public footbridge opposite, is under the care of Welsh heritage body Cadw. It is off limits to the public but can be viewed from the adjacent footbridge\nAnother said: ‘I was quite moved. It’s still a sight to behold, especially considering its construction by the primitive tools of the time.’\nThe structure is one of three bridges in the area funded by scholar Dr John Davies who published a Welsh grammar guide.\nHe served as rector of Mallwyd from 1603 until his death in 1644 – and worked on early Welsh translations of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer.\nPont Minllyn is the only survivor of three bridges built by Dr Davies in Snowdonia – known as Eryri.\nThe other two bridges were called Pont-Y-Cleifion and Pont-Y-Ffinant.",

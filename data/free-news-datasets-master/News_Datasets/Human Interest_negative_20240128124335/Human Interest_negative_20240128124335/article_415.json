    "text": "A Texas SWAT team demolished the cab of an 18-wheeler truck with a bulletproof digger in order to pluck the driver out after he led them on an hours-long slow car-chase.\nShocking video shows the moment that a seven feet tall bulletproof vehicle, known as 'The Rook', tore apart the cab of a tractor trailer.\nThe Rook effortlessly ripped through the 18-wheeler's exterior and tore the door of the cab right off so that members of the Texas SWAT team could yank the driver out.\nDeputies had been forced to bring the massive truck to a stop by using spike strips to puncture its tires.\nThe dramatic measure came after the truck's driver - later identified as Trinidad Cutshall - repeatedly ignored the officials' commands to exit and continued to rev the truck's engines as it drove down a highway east of Houston.\nAfter the tractor trailer had finally been forced to a halt, the digger ripped an initial hole in the cab which allowed the SWAT team to throw an unknown item into the vehicle.\nThe SWAT members then let one of their dogs into the truck before ripping Cutshall out.\nAccording to officials - Cutshall continued to press the gas and hold on inside the cab as officers desperately tried to drag him out.\nEventually - at around 4 pm on Wednesday - the man was plucked from the cab and officers walked towards the bloodied man with a stretcher.\nCutshall's worrying behavior came after an already alarming hours-long car chase, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said.\nGonzalez said the driver appeared to be suffering from 'heavy impairment,' but that authorities don't know what was behind his behavior.\n'Still don't know why he was reacting in the erratic manner he was,' Gonzalez said.",

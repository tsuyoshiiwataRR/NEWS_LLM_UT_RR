    "text": "The grieving husband of a British woman murdered in Australia last Boxing Day has emotionally revealed how he ‘went into dad mode’ to protect their two teenage daughters and took them to the UK to avoid a painful Christmas Down Under\nLee Lovell, 44, has stayed in the Brisbane bungalow where his 41-year-old wife Emma was stabbed by intruders because it is the place where he, Scarlett, 15, and 14-year-old Kassie feel closest to her.\nBut as this December approached he decided it would be too hard to mark such a family orientated time of the year in the house where they had once shared so many happy memories and instead returned to Britain to stay with friends.\nIn a heartbreaking interview, Mr Lovell said the aftermath of his beloved wife’s death had seen him go into ‘dad mode’ – with his full focus on looking after his daughters.\nHe told the BBC: ‘The kids, the house, I’ve been trying to be the best parent I can be. It’s all on me. They were 13 and 15 at the time. Emma lost her dad at 13 and I know how much that affected her.\n‘I’ve got to get up, I’ve got to work, I’ve got to get the kids to school and put food on the table for them. I’ve got to make sure there’s a roof over their head.\nThe couple in love when they first arrived in Australia from the UK back in 2002. Within 10 years, the couple had welcomed two daughters and returned to Australia to call Down Under their permanent home\nThe Lovells celebrated Christmas Day 2022 by eating a special meal at the local beach hours before Emma died\nTwo 17-year-olds from a nearby halfway house have been charged with Ms Lovell’s death\n‘So I guess I’ve been a bit practical in that regard. I’ve just got on with life a bit. They just come to me and talk to me about stuff – their day at school, boys, girls stuff. You’ve just got to be the best person you can.’\nMr Lovell said he felt like his future had been ‘robbed’, adding: ‘Sometimes in life you go through things and you’re not so confident about something and you lean on that other person to help get you through and I just don’t have that.\n‘It’s also hard seeing couples together, you feel really angry and jealous about that.’\nThe Lovells fell in love when they first arrived in Australia from the UK in 2002 and decided to make it their permanent home.\nThey celebrated Christmas Day 2022 by eating a special meal at the local beach.\nMr Lovell wrote in a Facebook post at the time: ‘So for the first time in 11 years we spent Christmas day on the beach and even managed to cook up some bacon and eggs!’\n‘Hope everyone has a great Christmas day spent with loved ones and friends.’\nHours after the post – when the family had returned home to their bungalow in North Lakes, Brisbane – they woke up to find intruders in the hallway.\nMr Lovell had just forced one of the men out of the house when he heard his daughter say ‘mummy’s bleeding’.\n‘I remember thinking at the time, ”I can’t die, I can’t leave the kids orphans”’, he recalled.\nMrs Lovell was resuscitated but died later in hospital.\nSpeaking today, her shattered husband said he had found grieving ‘hard’, struggling to combine it with the pressures of looking after his kids.\nHe called his late wife ‘beautiful, amazing’ and said he regularly found himself breaking down in tears while he was driving due to the pain of losing her.\nTwo 17-year-olds have been charged with murder over Mrs Lovell’s death.\nIn August, Mr Lovell revealed his determination to stay in the house where his wife died because it was full of years of joyful memories.\n‘I just want to focus on this house being a happy place for us and our family,’ Mr Lovell told The Courier Mail.\nHe said that for months the whole family had slept in the same bedroom after the terrifying incident with Scarlett on a mattress on the floor and Kassie where her mother used to sleep.\nHe said that while he was proud of his children for being strong, it had also caused the absence of his wife to sink in further.\nDescribing his current predicament, Mr Lovell said: ‘The kids, the house, I’ve been trying to be the best parent I can be. It’s all on me’\nMr Lovell said he felt like his future had been ‘robbed’ since the death of his beloved wife\nHe added that the mother-of-two ‘died trying to protect me and our family’ and that he missed her ‘so much’\n‘I haven’t gotten used to it, I suppose it’s been pretty lonely. Just going to bed by myself and waking up by myself,’ he said.\nThe children had offered to stay, which Mr Lovell suspects was for his benefit rather than theirs, but he conceded they should go if they felt ready, even if he did not.\nMr Lovell said he had added extra security since that night including a new security door at the front of the property, motion sensors and security cameras which, even eight months on, he will vigilantly check throughout the night.\nThe couple had been particularly close, having been married young and spent more than two decades together, including relocating across the other side of the world from the UK to Australia in 2011.\nMr Lovell said it was particularly ‘heartbreaking’ to lose such an intimate relationship in which both he and Emma had been so happy.\nSpeaking publicly for the first time since losing her mother, in August, Scarlett said her presence would ‘brighten’ any room she was in and said she found it hard to recall moments when her mother was ever sad.\nShe particularly misses their regular night drives to collect Kassie together.\n‘I guess it’s when we really opened up to each other but also had a lot of fun singing songs and stuff,’ Scarlett said.\nMr Lovell had just forced one of the intruders out of the house when he heard his daughter say ‘mummy’s bleeding’\nShattered neighbours left tributes to their ‘beautiful friend’ outside the North Lakes home\nMr Lovell said with each day the family is adjusting to the loss though some days are harder. His birthday and Mother’s Day, just a week apart, were particularly difficult.\nScarlett and Kassie have become closer to their father, confiding in him about boys or teenage things they would previously only ever tell their mum.\n‘Emma was the glue in our family, she was funny, smart, so caring, would do anything for anyone,’ Mr Lovell previously told Daily Mail Australia. ‘She died trying to protect me and our family.’\nAt the time of the tragedy last Boxing Day, neighbour Julie Balhatchet told Daily Mail Australia her daughters were on the second floor of their home when they saw the commotion unfolding across the road.\nThey quickly told their father who ran across the street to help.\n‘When my husband ran over, it was dark. He had no idea she was injured,’ Mrs Balhatchet said. ‘She [Mrs Lovell] was laying face down on the ground bleeding.’\nMrs Balhatchet said after the scuffle in the street, her daughters saw the two alleged offenders running from the house.\nWhile her husband and Mr Lovell worked to save his wife, another neighbour ushered the two daughters away from the traumatic scene.\nPictured is a map showing the halfway house where the suspects lived in and the Lovell’s home\nMrs Balhatchet was devastated to later learn Mrs Lovell died in hospital.\n‘It’s just so so sad,’ she said. ‘Those poor girls and her husband. He was very distraught.’\nMrs Balhatchet said the random alleged attack had shocked the normally quiet neighbourhood.\n‘I’ve lived here 19 years and nothing like this has happened. You think, why them? It could have been any of us on the street.’\nMr Lovell said today that prosecutors had warned him that his wife’s case may not go to trial until 2025.\n‘I sometimes feel quite guilty for saying it, but I want the trial to be done,’ he said. ‘It’s hanging over us and I want to move on but then by saying that it almost feels like I’m leaving Emma behind.’",

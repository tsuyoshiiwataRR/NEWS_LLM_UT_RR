    "text": "Former Michigan GOP gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon joins Fox Across America With guest host Jason Chaffetz to give her take on President Biden traveling to the U.S. Virgin Islands to spend New Year’s at the home of wealthy supporters. “I think it’s incredibly frustrating where you see Americans across the country having to work over this time frame when most people are wanting to stay home with their kids. Everybody’s off. It’s the holiday season, we’re between Christmas and New Year’s. People want to be on vacation. They can’t be They can’t afford to be on vacation. In fact, they’re looking at this and they’re saying, well, wait a minute. Up until the last minute, we were told you were working from Camp David, and then at the very last minute, suddenly everything changes and he’s going to the U.S. Virgin Islands. I mean, give me a break. The American people are looking at this and saying this was not the year, my friend. You’re campaigning. You should be showing us that you’re going to do the job instead of taking your, what, 417th day vacation since you’ve been president. This is completely outrageous. But will the American people come out and vote? That’s what I’m asking for. Whether you are a Republican, Democrat, independent, are you going to vote for a president that’s actually going to work for you? And you talk about spending. When am I going to hear one of these candidates talk about making sure that we’re trying to balance the budget at some point? Because I think all Americans are saying, hey, we’re having to balance our budget. When are you going to decide what to cut and how we’re going to get back on track in the United States?” To hear what else she had to say to Jason, listen to the podcast!

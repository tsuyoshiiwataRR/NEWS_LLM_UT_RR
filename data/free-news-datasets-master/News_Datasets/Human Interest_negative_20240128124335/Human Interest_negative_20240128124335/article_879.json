    "text": "Judge sets $250K bond for stabbing suspect who was married to his victim A man accused of stabbing a woman multiple times and then trying to escape on a train appeared in court Thursday. According to police, Shenika Williams was stabbed Wednesday around 1:40 p.m. near the intersection of Glenwood Avenue and Millbrook Road in Raleigh. James Andre Hunt, 51, was taken into custody after boarding a train at Union Station in an effort to get away. Hunt, who records show married Williams in 2019, was charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury. Williams was taken by ambulance to a hospital with serious injuries. WRAL News is working to get an update on her condition. Shana Christopher, who works at Union Station, told WRAL News a woman approached her and pleaded for help stopping a train. The woman said a man had stabbed her aunt and was trying to board a train to evade police. Christopher then told a train conductor to stop the train from leaving the station. The conductor ordered everyone on board to leave the train, leading to Hunt's capture and arrest after a six-hour manhunt. The train station is located about 8 miles from the stabbing scene. \"She told me that her aunt had just been stabbed,\" Christopher said. \"And that the man had came into the train station or was attempting to get on a train and get out of here.\" \"I went up here and alerted the guy back there so that they could radio out there and that’s when they stopped it and I brought her up there,\" Christopher said. \"She gave the name and everything like that and they rushed and stopped the train. Then the cops came flying in.\" At the scene of the stabbing, the investigation looked to be centered around an SUV. Officers blocked traffic at the busy intersection for hours as they searched for the perpetrator. Millbrook Road reopened around 5:40 p.m. Hunt was on pretrial release for felony drug charges and felony eluding arrest. The judge gave him a $250,000 bond. •Credits [Jodi Leese Glusco](/rs/bio/20192147/) [Ryan Bisesi](/rs/bio/20211237/) [Willie Daniely](/rs/bio/20921078/)",

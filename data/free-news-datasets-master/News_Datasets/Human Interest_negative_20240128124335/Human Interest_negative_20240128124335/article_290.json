Here are just a few of the actors, writers, producers, artists and musicians who died in the past year, listed chronologically below by the dates of their deaths. Free-spirited icon of American rock David Crosby Crosby was a prominent figure of the 1970s Laurel Canyon scene who helped bring folk-rock mainstream with both [The Byrds](https://www.npr.org/artists/15786738/the-byrds) and [Crosby, Stills & Nash](https://www.npr.org/artists/104401754/crosby-stills-nash).

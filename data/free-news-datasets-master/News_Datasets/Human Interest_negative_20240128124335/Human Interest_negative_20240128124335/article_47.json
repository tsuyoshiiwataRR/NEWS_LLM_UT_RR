    "text": "With 39 points (20 in the first quarter alone),\nLuka Doncic put on another show on Wednesday, but it wasn’t enough as the Dallas Mavericks lost 113-110 at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Donovan Mitchell, Darius Garland, and Evan Mobley were all out of the Cavaliers’ lineup, and Kyrie Irving was still not in the Mavs’. Shannon Sharpe and Gill Arena showed their frustration at the Dallas Mavericks’ defeat.\nAdditionally, the Mavs led by as many as 20 points in the second quarter before getting halftime leads of 15 points and fourth-quarter leads of up to 10 points. The Dallas Mavericks let a 20-point lead slip away at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers, who were without injured players like Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley, and Darius Garland. Former NFL player and current sports analyst\nShannon Sharpe expressed his disappointment.\nShannon Sharpe said via NightCap,\nCavs were without three starters, You Can't lose that game on your home court especially up by 20 points. A 20-point lead in today's game is not the same as 20 20-point lead twenty years ago\"\nJarett Allen and Caris LeVert came up and performed well despite the Cavaliers’ injuries, helping the team pull off a victory.\nSharpe’s response to the game was not unusual. The Mavericks’ collapse surprised and disappointed a lot of fans and analysts. The loss especially disappointed fans of the Mavericks because their team had been playing well lately and had high expectations for the upcoming campaign.\nLuka Doncic’s burning response to being booed by the ‘hostile’ Phoenix crowd goes viral: “Best feeling in the world”\nLuka Doncic is having a wonderful season for the Dallas Mavericks\nDoncic came into Wednesday having played twelve straight games with an average of 37.6 points, 11.4 assists, and 9.2 rebounds, which included\n a fifty-point performance against the Phoenix Suns on Christmas Day. He kept up that furious pace and appears headed for his fifth consecutive selection to the All-NBA First Team. Even after the Dallas Mavericks’ defeat by the Cleveland Cavaliers, Luka Doncic is still the league’s best player in December and the entire campaign. https://www.nba.com/player/1629029/luka-doncic is among the front-runners for the NBA MVP award this season thanks to his outstanding performances. The Slovenian International is currently averaging 33 points, 8 rebounds, and 9 assists per game. The Mavericks have moved up two spots in the NBA power rankings thanks to Doncic’s dominance. His ability to create plays and score has been essential to the Mavericks’ success this year. With an 18-13 record, the Mavericks are ready to cause a stir in the Western Conference.\nThis season, the Mavericks hope to make the playoffs, and Doncic’s continuous dominance will be essential to that goal. The player has demonstrated his capacity to take control of games and improve his teammates. If the Mavericks want to go far in the playoffs this year, Doncic’s outstanding play must continue.\nIn case you missed it:\nPaul Pierce claims the Lakers hung up the ‘in-season championship banner’ just to ‘spite’ the Celtics “This sht is a*!” – Zion Williamson gets BRUTALLY trolled for seemingly uncentered chest tattoo flexing a ‘lion in a cross’\n- Do follow us on:\n- Follow FirstSportz on\nWhatsApp Channel",

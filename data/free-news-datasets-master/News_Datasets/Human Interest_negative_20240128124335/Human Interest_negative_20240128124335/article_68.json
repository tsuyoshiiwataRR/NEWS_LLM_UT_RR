    "text": "Huge crowds hit Boxing Day sales despite slow start to the morningAussies are expected to spend more than $1billion this year READ MORE: Ten of the best Boxing Day deals on Amazon\nLarge crowds have descended on Australia’s shopping precincts to grab a Boxing Day bargain, despite the cost-of-living crunch tightening household budgets.\nThousands of shoppers ventured out for the sales with Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne teeming by the middle of the day after a very quiet early morning.\nIn previous years it was common for long queues to be forming from sunrise, with hundreds clamouring to be the first to rush through the doors when retailers opened.\nBut it seems the shift to online shopping along with stubbornly high inflation hasn’t dulled the enthusiasm for one of the biggest shopping days of the year.\n‘Boxing Day is the grand final of Australia’s favourite sport, shopping,’ Australian Retailers Association boss Paul Zahra said.\nBoxing Day sales are underway across Australia with large crowds turning out for one of the year’s biggest shopping days (pictured is Sydney)\nAustralians are expected to spend $1.25billion on December 26 according to the Australian Retailers Association (pictured: shoppers in Sydney)\nShoppers lined up outside Pandora in Sydney’s Pitt St Mall on Tuesday\nBy 12pm Sydney’s CBD was bustling despite hardly anyone lining up earlier in the morning\nThe association estimates Australians will splurge $1.25 billion on the ‘unprecedented’ bargains as shoppers try to stretch their dollars further during discounts and sales.\nSome retail experts forecast that Australians will spend big at the shops on Boxing Day because of the cost-of-living pressure not despite it, as they opt to find that item they’ve been eyeing for a cheaper price.\nThough it may have sparked some concern from retailers earlier in the morning with hardly anyone seen at Sydney’s Pitt St Mall.\nIt was a little busier in Melbourne’s Bourke St Mall with a small crowd of about 200 people lined up outside David Jones when it opened at 7.30am and another 100 walking through Myer’s doors when it opened half an hour later.\nIn both cities it was a long way from previous years when extra security guards have to be hired to shepherd the hoards of stampeding shoppers rushing through the doors as they opened.\nIt might have caused retailers to worry when the Sydney’s CBD appeared to be deserted about 7am but crowds picked up\nSydney was a ghost town earlier on Tuesday morning on contrast to previous years where shoppers would line up to be the first through the doors\nThe crowd outside Myer as doors opened was subdued compared to just a few years ago\nShoppers weren’t appearing too fazed by the cost of living crunch with many seen lugging away multiple shopping bags\nSuburban shopping centres could even see bigger crowds than their CBD counterparts with Chadstone Shopping Centre in Melbourne expecting more than 150,000 visitors on December 26.\nAustralia’s biggest bank expects almost one in two people to participate in the sales, spending an estimated $4.6 billion in total.\nCommonwealth Bank personal finance expert Jess Irvine said while more people are planning to shop the Boxing Day sales than in previous years, people are planning to spend less.\nThe average planned spend this year is $475.70 compared to a planned average spend of $483.20 in 2022 and $557.05 in 2021.\nThe driving demographic involved in Boxing Day shopping are those aged 39 and under, reflecting data from a recent CommBank IQ cost of living report which found younger Australians are feeling the most pain from rising prices.\n‘Aussie household budgets are being squeezed on multiple fronts, so it is not surprising that individual shoppers are tightening their belts,’ Ms Irvine said.\nDavid Jones and Myer, have been preparing for one of the biggest days on their shopping calendar.\nDavid Jones alone anticipates up to one million customers through its doors and online during the week-long bargain period across all departments.\nFor those looking for a change of scenery, Qantas and subsidiary Jetstar are offering discounted one-way fares on almost every domestic and some international routes in the second half of 2024.\nHuge discounts drew in shoppers at David Jones in Pitt St with the retailer expecting 1million customers to shop at the store either in person or online on December 26\nMany shoppers braved the crowds and potential for rain as they shopped in Sydney\nCrowds queue in Sydney on Boxing Day despite a shift to online shopping\nRetail experts said Aussies will be out in force at the sales as they try and make their dollar go further amid high inflation\nAs shoppers transition from Christmas, so do their spending behaviours, Mr Zahra said.\n‘In the lead up to Christmas, shoppers are focused on buying gifts for their family and loved ones,’ he said.\n‘Post-Christmas, Australians typically turn their attention to purchases for themselves and their household, focused on snagging a bargain.’\nAussies who face buyer’s remorse amid the rush or want to return unwanted gifts are being warned by NSW Fair Trading to know their rights.\nIf a product is not of acceptable quality, does not match the description or is not fit for purpose, customers may be entitled to a repair, replacement or refund under consumer law.\nCustomers have the same legal refund rights on sale items as they would have on full-price products unless they were informed of a fault before the purchase.\n‘Retailers have a responsibility to ensure their products meet required standards but consumers also need to do their homework before they buy or they might get caught out,’ Fair Trading Commissioner John Tansey said.",

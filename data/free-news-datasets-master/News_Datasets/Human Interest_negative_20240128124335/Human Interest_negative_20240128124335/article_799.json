    "text": "Gary Neville has mocked Arsenal fans who have been left fuming by the decision to award West Ham’s opening goal on Thursday night.\nGabriel and Oleksandr Zinchenko failed to clear the ball from a cross into the box, with the ball falling to Jarrod Bowen. The Hammers star reached for it, tapping it back to team-mate Tomas Soucek, who fired past David Raya.\nThat put David Moyes ‘ side a goal up, despite Arsenal having dominated possession up to that point. The goal was checked extensively by VAR Craig Pawson, with replays appearing to show the ball had gone out.\nBut with Bowen’s body blocking a clear view of the ball, Pawson directed referee Michael Oliver to award the goal. That sparked Neville into life, with the Manchester United defender taking full advantage of the chance to mock Gunners fans.\nNeville had previously filmed a segment for Sky Sports showing how the ball can be in even if it looks out. At the time, one Arsenal fan tweeted: “Gary Neville made a segment on live television talking about how spheres work and then Joe Willock came out and told the ball went out.”\nThe pundit responded to that tweet on Thursday night with 24 laughing face emojis. He followed that up by tweeting a photo of a ball that looked to be out but was in from his film, with the caption being the magnifying class emoji.\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Should West Ham’s goal against Arsenal have stood? Comment below.\nJarrod Bowen blocks the VAR before Tomas Soucek’s opener at Arsenal\nOne Arsenal fan did not take kindly to the mocking though, replying: “You were the worst full back in the PL.” Neville delivered a customarily witty comeback, writing: “Agreed but great at goal line technology.”\nHe did have good news for the Gunners, despite them going into half-time a goal down. Neville wrote: “On a positive note for Arsenal the front 3 are playing narrower and closer to each other to combine. They look dangerous!”\nFormer Rangers star Ally McCoist was unsure that the ball had stayed in, admitting the replays were inconclusive. McCoist said on Amazon Prime TV: “It’s a tough one. That is going to be a tough one, whether it’s gone out or not. That looks… what do we think? That looks out to me.”\nAfter seeing a different angle, he added “It looks in there! That frame it looks out, but it’s hidden (the ball). Clearly, Bowen is hiding the part of the ball that we really want to see, his right leg is covering the line.\n“It makes it extremely difficult for us. I’d very, very hopeful whoever is looking at it has another angle because you can’t see it. His right leg, his right thigh, is actually covering (the view).”\nJoin our new WhatsApp community!

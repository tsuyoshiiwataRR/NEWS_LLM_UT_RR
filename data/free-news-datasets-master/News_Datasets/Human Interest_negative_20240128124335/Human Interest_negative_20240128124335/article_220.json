    "text": "Individually, they are stars of sport. Yet, what happens when some of Australia's most recognised and celebrated athletes are also in a relationship with another high profile sports person? Enter: The sporting power couple. We've done the limbering up and compiled a list of Australian sporting power couples. Madi Wilson and Matt Short went public with their relationship in January 2023, with Wilson captioning the photos, \"Deserves the hardest launch\". Little is known about how the Olympic gold swimmer and her Big Bash League cricketer beau met. However, since January they have documented holiday time together on social media together. Short isn't one to shy away from poking fun at himself either. In an August 2023 post to his Instagram account, the Adelaide Strikers player wrote \"Batting above my average,\" next to photo of himself and Wilson. In October 2023, the couple sealed their sport crossover romance with a ring. They kept things simple when announcing their happy news, letting their beaming smiles and sparkling bling shine. \"20/10/23 üíç YES\", the caption read. They are the golden couple of Australian cricket. Mitchell Starc and Alyssa Healy, who have both worn the baggy green, have been together since they were teenagers. They first met when they were both just nine years old , competing against each other in Sydney's Northern District Junior Cricket Association. Starc said the two kind of just fell into the relationship. \"The week before I went away on my first Australian tour, I realised I had been seeing Alyssa almost every day for a long, long while,\" he said. \"It felt a bit weird asking but it was like, 'Are we dating now?' It just happened.\" The pair got engaged in 2015 and were married by 2016. Starc and Healy, now both in their thirties, remain happily married with two pet Staffies by their side. Starc, a celebrated fast bowler, was named Australia's player of the series in the 2023 Ashes, having taken a series-high 23 wickets. Healy, a champion wicketkeeper like her uncle Ian Healy, is recovering from a hand injury after a freak accident involving her pups. \"I've got two puppy dogs that were having a bit of a rough and tumble. It got a little bit more than that and unfortunately I got my hand in the wrong place,\" she said When swim stars Cody Simpson and Emma McKeon went public with their relationship, McKeon described their pairing in one word. \"It's pretty easy,\" 9HoneyCelebrity quoted McKeon as saying last year . \"I mean, we've got the same schedule, we're tired at the same times, hungry at the same times, all that kind of stuff, so it makes living very easy.\" McKeon is the most decorated Australian in Olympic history, winning 11 Olympic medals, five of them gold. Simpson is best known for his pop stardom before returning to swimming professionally. He is also known for his high-profile dating life. He famously dated US music superstar Miley Cyrus and model Gigi Hadid . Simpson confirmed his relationship with McKeon in an Instagram post in July . \"A brief rendezvous in Barcelona with my love [McKeon],\" Simpson wrote. McKeon responded with a love heart emoji. McKeon (left) has previously been romantically linked to fellow Australian swimmer Kyle Chalmers. Football superstar Mary Fowler had millions of Aussies cheering her on during this year's Women's World Cup. While there were a number of familiar faces cheering on the 20-year-old Matilda forward, there was one face that stood out. Nathan Cleary was photographed watching intently on during the Matilda's AFC Women's Asian Olympic Qualifier match in November in Perth. The 26-year-old is a premiership Penrith Panther and World Cup winner for the NRL. In November, Matildas star Mackenzie Arnold took a playful jab at Fowler and her rumoured romance with Cleary. Arnold, 29, appeared on 2DayFM's Hughesy Ed and Erin jokingly banning Cleary from the field during Matildas matches. The reason? The Panthers beat the Brisbane Broncos in the NRL Grand Final in October. Arnold is a keen Broncos fan. \"Seeing Nathan Cleary in the crowd was a little bit different for us, I was salty from the Grand Final to be honest,\" Arnold said. \"So I wasn't happy about it, I let Mary know he couldn't come on the field,\" she added with a laugh. The pair have yet to go public with their relationship. Though the pairing has gained much interest from fans of their respective camps. Such fascination can make having a nice meal together look awkward. In November Cleary was quoted in the media as saying he is keen to keep his private life private. For those wondering, yes they both follow each other on Instagram. Lance 'Buddy' Franklin and wife Jesinta have been a power couple for more than a decade now. Since the couple first started dating in 2010, and then marrying in 2016, they have been a tower of support for each other, often championing each other's work online. In 2020, the couple welcomed their first child together , a daughter named Tullulah. Buddy, a proud Noongar-Wajuk man, opened up about what he's learned since becoming a father. \"I appreciate my mother and all women, but the appreciation of seeing exactly what mothers do, day in day out ... my appreciation for them is just through the roof, and especially my wife,\" he wrote on the Sydney Swans website. A year later, they welcomed their second child, a son, named Rocky. The former Miss Universe Australia winner is known more for her beauty products and fashion trends, yet in 2022 she turned heads when she helped negotiate what would become Buddy's final AFL playing contract. \"Jesinta Franklin last year completed the AFL Players' Association accreditation course, enabling her to register as a player agent before the Sydney Swans forward made one of the biggest decisions of his career,\" WWOS quoted Today's Brooke Boney . Boney was asked to comment on Jesinta for its 50 Most Influential Women in Sport list released in March in 2023. Jesinta ranked 42 on the list. Adelaide AFLW captain Chelsea Randall and two-time premiership defender Marijana Rajcic are all smiles. And why wouldn't they be? The Adelaide Crows teammates and couple are both multi-premiership winners. They are also proud new parents. Rajcic (left) and Randall (right) have been teammates since 2018. The pair became engaged in March 2023. Their engagement comes two months after Rajcic announced her retirement , following 50 AFLW games. Rajcic played in the Crows' 2019 and season six premierships. She moved into a coaching role with the team in 2023. Rajcic stepped down from her coaching spot earlier this year to prepare for the birth of the couple's first child. In late October 2023, they welcomed their son. \"Welcome to the world Tomi Randall,\" the couple wrote in a post to Instagram. \"Our beautiful boy. We are SO in love.\"",

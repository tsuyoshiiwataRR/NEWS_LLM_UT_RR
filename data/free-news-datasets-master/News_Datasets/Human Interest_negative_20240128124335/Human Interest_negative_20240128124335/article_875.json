    "text": "A Montpelier-based nonprofit that spent more than four decades working on issues affecting older Vermonters closed its doors this week, citing financial pressures.\nThe Community of Vermont Elders announced in a press release Wednesday that its board of directors voted unanimously on Dec. 22 to shut down the 41-year-old organization. While all programs ended immediately, according to the release, its offices will close Dec. 31.\n“Ongoing financial challenges and limited resources have led to the decision to cease operations,” the release stated.\nJim Holway, president of the board of directors, said in the press release that the decision to close was “incredibly difficult.”\n“The organization has faced mounting challenges over a prolonged period of time, including insurmountable financial issues warranting the Board’s action on Friday,” said Holway, who could not be reached for comment on Thursday.\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, Holway took over as interim executive director of the organization in October.\nIn addition to providing resources and education for older residents of the state, the nonprofit worked at the Statehouse on advocacy and policy and administered a Medicare education program.",

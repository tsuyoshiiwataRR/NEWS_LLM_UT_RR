    "text": "RAPID CITY, S.D. - On the day after Christmas, the Rapid City Police Department bid a heartfelt farewell to retired K9 Stryker, who peacefully passed. Born on April 4, 2010, Stryker was nearly 14 years. Stryker enjoyed an long career with the Rapid City Police Department, retiring alongside his handler, Senior Officer Sean Doyle, in late 2019. Functioning as a dual-purpose dog, Stryker's legacy is woven with numerous stories of bravery, as he led the way into challenging situations, ensuring the safety of the Rapid City community and fellow officers. Related: Stryker's retirement RAPID CITY, S.D. — Two highly trained members of the Rapid City Police Department celebrated their retirement this week. Senior Officer Sean Doyle has been with the department for 21 years, and spent half of the time working in the K9 unit. He and his K9 partner Stryker have worked to track suspects and train other K9s in South Dakota. Dogs in the K9 unit of RCPD undergo intense training including apprehension and drug detection — and knowing how to handle a police service dog requires just as much work. RCPD Chief Karl Jegeris says that the job of a K9 and handler is a challenging one. “It’s a nonstop, 24/7 obligation,” Jegeris said. “It requires a lot of commitment, so today is a day of celebration to recognize the commitment that both Senior Officer Doyle and Stryker made for our community and our department.” Stryker will be celebrating a successful career by going home to live with the Doyle family. “A high level of expertise is walking out the door,” Jegeris said. “But in a good way. He is retiring and moving on to other things.”",

    "text": "The 2023 football season has officially come to an end for the Aggie Football team and new head coach Mike Elko has a lot to look forward to in the future.\nI don’t think anyone knew what to expect when the Aggies took the field at NRG Stadium on Wednesday night. Then, when third-string QB Jaylon Henderson was knocked out of the game on the very first play from scrimmage, it appeared that skipping the game altogether might have been the wiser choice.\nHowever, true freshman Marcel Reed , 180 pounds soaking wet, showed that Aggie spirit and fought all game long, giving A&M a fighting chance to the very end. Two seniors, Max Wright and Sam Mathews, played huge roles in keeping the game in reach, capping off their final game in the Maroon & White. Wright finished the game with four receptions for 62 yards and Mathews finished with a career night that he will never forget.\nHis stat line consisted of a team-leading 14 tackles, 1.5 TFLs, and an interception. Max and Sam both talked about their time at A&M and what this season meant to them.\n“Texas A&M, to me, is the perfect representation of what it means to be people of honor and people of character. It’s the best university in the world, and there is no other university like it. I will be an Aggie for the rest of my life.” – Max Wright\n“This season has been one I’ll never forget. Those last weeks might have been my favorite on this team with how everybody bought in and committed to each other. It was special to be a part of.”\nBelow, you can hear everything Max Wright and Sam Mathews had to say following the game.\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on Twitter, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.

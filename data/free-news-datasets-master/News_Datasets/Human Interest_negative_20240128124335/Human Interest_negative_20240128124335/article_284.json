    "text": "Prince Harry and [Meghan Markle](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/royal-family) were allegedly \"tipped over the edge\" by one incident during Christmas 2019, which helped them realise they had to make their \"own path\". The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped down as [working royals](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/royal-family) in 2020 and moved to the United States, reports [the Express](https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1849910/prince-harry-meghan-markle-christmas-moment). While there were many reasons that they stepped down, this Christmas incident was the \"final straw\", according to a royal author. In his first book, Finding Freedom, Omid Scobie, alongside Carolyn Durand, wrote about how [Harry and Meghan ](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/royal-family)were allegedly furious after they were not included in the late Queen's 2019 Christmas broadcast. During the broadcast, there was not a picture of the couple and their then-newborn son, Prince Archie, alongside the family portraits on the monarch's desk. Before they even announced their departure from the family, the couple believed that the Royal Family and their staff were \"conspiring against them\". According to the authors, the couple felt they \"had long been sidelined by the institution and were not a fundamental part of its future.\" The book read: \"One didn’t have to look further than the family photos displayed during the Queen’s Speech on Christmas Day. \"In the Green Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace, where the Queen delivered her address, viewers glimpsed photos of the [Waleses] and their children, Charles and Camilla, Prince Philip, and a black-and-white image of George VI. \"Noticeably absent was a photo of Harry, Meghan, and their new baby, Archie. Palace sources insisted that the photos were chosen to represent the direct line of succession, but for Harry and Meghan, it had been yet another sign that they needed to consider their own path.\" However, Prince Harry and Meghan were included in the 2019 Christmas Day speech, when the Queen and Prince Philip met Archie for the first time, and Meghan’s mum, Doria Ragland, was included.

    "text": "A wife and mom-of-one has been slammed for dressing up and taking herself out on a 'solo date,' with many declaring her behavior as 'suspicious.' The woman took to Reddit to ask if she was in the wrong for leaving her husband with their child to go out for dinner by herself once a month. She explained that although her husband had no issue with her taking time for herself, he began to suspect she was having an affair because she would get dressed up for 'dates' by herself and be gone for hours. Taking to Reddit, the mom posted in the Am I wrong? subreddit, asking if they thought her habit was odd or if her husband was just being unreasonable. A wife has been slammed for dressing up for luxurious 'solo dates' without her husband for hours at a time (stock image) The mom-of-one took to Reddit to question if she is in the wrong for leaving her husband with their child to go to luxurious dinners by herself She began by explaining her dining ritual, adding she's been taking herself on a solo date 'every month or so' for two years. 'I will make reservations or simply go to a restaurant with nice clothes and make up,' the mom-of-one explained. 'I just feel good when I am dressed well.' She continued admitting she sometimes needed a break, and she relished the time she got to spend by herself. 'So, sometimes I just go out alone, eat food and just spend quality time [by myself],' she said. The woman said she would usually indulge in a solo date on a day when she was working in the office. 'I have had this ritual for two years,' she explained. 'At first my husband wanted to join but I refused.' The woman told her husband that they could do date nights any other day of the week, but she needed the one night to herself. She added she loved eating alone because she didn't have to share her food with anyone and the restaurant was quiet. 'But my husband doesn't like it,' the confused woman wrote. 'He has no issues with me taking time off but he says me wearing nice clothes and wearing make up is unnecessary. 'I told him he has nothing to worry. I just don't like going anywhere like a ghoul.' People flooded the comments section and slammed the mom-of-one for her 'weird' behavior The mom-of-one noted it was not only her solo dates she dressed up for, explaining she got dolled up to go to the supermarket too. However, her husband was no longer buying her story and was convinced there was another man in the picture. 'Last week he got angry and asked me if there is someone else,' she confessed. '[He thinks it's] unreasonable for me to go to a restaurant for hours just by myself. But he doesn't believe me. 'I honestly do nothing. I eat my food, stare into the void, think about something random for few minutes and go home.' 'Am I wrong here?' she questioned. People flooded the comments section and slammed the mom-of-one for her 'weird' behavior, many agreeing with her husband and telling her it sounds suspicious. 'So no you're not wrong for wanting alone time,' a Reddit user assured her. 'The problem is, sounds like your husband is uncomfortable because honestly op (original poster), although you aren't cheating, it sure looks that way.' 'If the roles were reversed people would be screaming cheating,' one user pointed out. 'Honestly if your husband had posted from his perspective, I think most people would be suspicious. 'Start just saying it's alone time, and you just need a small break every now and then, it might also be the fact that your are doing it in the evening maybe?' Others suggested her behavior may have been flagged by friends of her husband's. 'I'm not sure It just seems like your husband isn't uncomfortable about what you're actually doing, but maybe someone mentioned something to him and it made him feel insecure about it,' someone else wrote. Some Reddit users urged the woman to communicate with her significant other. 'OP, you need to realize, even though you know what you're doing is fine, everything that he sees is suspicious. Communicate with him instead of getting insulted by his words. This isn't a 5th grade concept,' one commenter explained. 'I'll go against the grain on this one. Yes you're wrong. This is great cover for you to cheat in the future,' another declared. The Reddit user continued: Going out dressed up like you're looking to get some action. You are planting the seeds of doubt in your partner's mind, where there should be none.'",

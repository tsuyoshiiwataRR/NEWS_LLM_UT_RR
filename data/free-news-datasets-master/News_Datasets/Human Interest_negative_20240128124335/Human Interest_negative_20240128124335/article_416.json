The impact on their businesses, their investments, their personal health the last two years has been a lot,” says association chair Krystal Churcher.\nShe owns a child-care centre in Fort McMurray and runs another out of a school in Calgary, and says the scheduling of payments also poses a major challenge.\nUnder the program, parents pay around $15 a day per child at the start of the month and operators submit the claims and are later reimbursed from the grant funding from the government.\n“The problem that we’re having is that money isn’t instantly refunded by the government it takes 40 to 45 days,” she says.\n“All of that income then is not coming back to your childcare operator for 40 or 45 days. It’s really difficult to cover the overhead of a childcare centre like your rent, your wages, your insurances without access to your revenue.”\nThe provincial government has provided funding to operators that amounts to a three per cent increase in program fees to help cover increased costs.\nHowever, Churcher says operators are also limited with what they can use the funding for and they don’t take inflation into account.\n“We’re in a private business situation that is completely government-controlled and regulated without having engagement over that or consultation or input. It’s very frustrating and I think people are starting to see the impacts the loss of control over the decisions they have,” she says.\n“Over the last two years, we’ve seen record high inflation, we’ve seen utility costs skyrocketing, food costs are through the roof. If parents are struggling at home with the cost of groceries, imagine a child-care centre with a food program that hasn’t been able to increase their fees for two years.”\nOperators, like Sunny South Day Care Centre, are now considering opting out of the program or making major cutbacks, which according to its letter to parents includes cancelling meal programs and field trips, cutting salaries or laying off staff, or hiring less experienced educators.\nThe new contract is set to take effect Jan. 1, 2024, with a deadline for operators to sign on by Jan. 31, 2024, leaving operators little time to make difficult choices.\n“The biggest issue you’re going to see across the province over the next 15 months is financially, centres are not going to be able to stay open under this program,” says Churcher.\nThe provincial government allocated $32.8 million in 2023 to operators through a one-time grant to help with inflationary and administrative costs.\nThere are also wage top-ups, infant care incentives and subsidies for eligible families available.\n“Alberta’s government is focused on ensuring life remains affordable for families and businesses. Affordable child care creates opportunities, keeping money in the pockets of parents,” says Ashli Barrett, press secretary for the Minister of Children and Family Services.\n“Alberta’s government is also offering a one-time grant early next year for operators who submitted their financial reporting for the 2022-23 Affordability Grant that ended on March 31, 2022. This grant will help cover some of the costs of associated with financial reporting requirements.”\nParents looking for information or have concerns about child-care programs in Alberta can call the Child Care Connect line at 1-844-5165 or email cs.childcareconnect@gov.ab.ca.\nShopping Trends\nThe Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

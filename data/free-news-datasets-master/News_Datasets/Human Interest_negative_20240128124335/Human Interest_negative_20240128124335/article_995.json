    "text": "Streaming Now The decade's most triggering comedy “Grandma, how did mom die?” After interviewing over 150 people and conducting a two-month investigation that included evidence from video footage and GPS data, The New York Times published a [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/28/world/middleeast/oct-7-attacks-hamas-israel-sexual-violence.html) about the sexual atrocities committed against Israeli women by Hamas on October 7, and the stories are shocking and horrific. The Times report highlights photographs showing a woman’s corpse with “dozens of nails driven into her thighs and groin,” as well as a video showing two dead Israeli women soldiers who were shot in their vaginas. One barbaric incident the Times documented involved a 24-year-old female accountant who was shot in the back and who hid under the low branches of a tree and covered herself in dry grass. She said she saw roughly 100 men arrive on motorcycles, cars, and trucks. The first victim she saw was a young woman with blood streaming down her back and her pants around her knees. The accountant said a man yanked the victim by the hair and forced her to bend over. Another man began raping her and every time she flinched he stabbed her in the back. The accountant said she witnessed another woman “shredded into pieces.” A Hamas terrorist raped her while another cut off one of her breasts with a box cutter. “One continues to rape her, and the other throws her breast to someone else, and they play with it, throw it, and it falls on the road,” she recalled, adding that the men sliced the victim’s face and then the woman fell from view. She said she saw terrorists carrying three severed heads of other women. The female accountant said she has become an insomniac, and when she does sleep she awakens covered in sweat. “That day, I became an animal,” she said. “I was emotionally detached, sharp, just the adrenaline of survival. I looked at all this as if I was photographing them with my eyes, not forgetting any detail. I told myself: I should remember everything.” Meanwhile, the United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, and the agency U.N. Women “did not acknowledge the many accusations until weeks after the attacks,” the Times noted. A young Israeli man said he saw five terrorists dragging a naked young woman. “They all gather around her,” he said. “She’s standing up. They start raping her. I saw the men standing in a half circle around her. One penetrates her. She screams. I still remember her voice, screams without words. Then one of them raises a knife and they just slaughtered her.” The first volunteer emergency medical technicians to arrive at the rave site, at which much of the massacre was committed, said they found dead women, no underwear and legs spread, with some of their hands tied with rope and zipties. A member of the rave’s production team whose two brothers were murdered in the massacre hid from the terrorists, later finding a woman naked from the waist down with her vagina area apparently sliced open. In Be’eri, a paramedic found two sisters, ages 16 and 13. One’s body had bruises on her groin; the other’s pajamas were pulled down and she had semen smeared on her back. A female dentist who worked at the identification center said she saw several dead women with cuts in their vaginas and another with fingernails pulled out. One young woman who was murdered was found with her face burned beyond recognition. Video of her body posted on October 8 went viral, the Times noted, “with thousands of people responding, desperate to know if the woman in the black dress was their missing friend, sister or daughter.” She was Gal Abdush, 34, a mother of two boys ages 10 and 7, whose husband, 35, was also murdered in the massacre. They had been in love since they were teenagers. Their grandmother has taken to lying in bed with the two boys until they fall asleep. The Times ends its report by noting that one night she tried to quietly slip out of the bedroom when the seven-year-old said, “Grandma, I want to ask you a question.” “Honey,” she said, “you can ask anything.” “Grandma, how did mom die?” the little girl asked.",

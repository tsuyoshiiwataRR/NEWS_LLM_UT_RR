    "text": "Floods Hit North Aceh; 44,000 Residents Affected and 4,000 Displaced Translator Editor 29 December 2023 00:00 WIB TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - North Aceh Regency has been hit by flooding since Sunday, Dec. 24, following high-intensity rain in the upstream area of Bener Meriah District, the Regional Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) reported. “The water level of the river remains high. The flooding is increasingly spreading to Lhoksukon and Tanah Luas sub-districts,” Chief Executive of BPBD North Aceh, Asnawi, said in a statement, on Thursday, Dec. 28. Asnawi said that based on the rapid assessment, the flood has impacted 12,826 families or up to 44,244 people. “As many as 4,048 people have been displaced in 18 locations,” he added. Thirteen sub-districts consisting of 108 gampongs or villages have been affected by the flooding, with water levels ranging from 10 to 80 centimeters. “The flood made it impossible for people to carry out economic activities. Several embankments broke, cutting off the main roads,” he said. In response, the local government issued a Flood Emergency Response Status (STDB) No. 360/869/2023, which is valid for 14 days from its issuance. Asnawi also mentioned that North Aceh is often hit by flooding from upstream areas in Bener Meriah Regency. Since 2020, floods have caused not only material losses but also casualties. Meanwhile, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) assessed that the flooding was caused by several factors, including weather and environmental damage. Several river banks around the affected areas also lacked vegetation, which reduced their resistance.

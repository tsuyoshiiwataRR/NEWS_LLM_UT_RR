    "text": "23-Year-Old Man Arrested in Turkey and Extradited to Sweden for Attempted Murder and Kidnapping\nA 23-year-old man has been arrested in Turkey and is set to be extradited to Sweden in connection with an attempted murder and a kidnapping in Sundsvall earlier this year. According to information obtained by Aftonbladet, the man, who was detained in his absence, will be returning to Sweden to face charges.\nThe man is suspected of beating and stabbing three boys along with several other people. Two of the boys are said to have traveled to Sundsvall with the intention of carrying out a murder, while the third boy joined them in Sundsvall and was also subjected to a beating. The boys had reportedly planned the murder, but their plans were leaked, leading to their kidnapping and a brutal assault in a forest area.\nThey were eventually found on a staircase outside a residential building where they sought help and received medical care. The boys survived the attack but sustained serious injuries and had to be sedated and treated.\nThe attempted murder is believed to be connected to a conflict over the drug trade in Sundsvall between the Foxtrot and Dalen networks. Parts of the beating were filmed and shared on social media, with the video aiming to mock and belittle the Foxtrot network.\nThe 23-year-old was arrested in his absence in September, suspected of attempted murder and kidnapping. He is also known to have a prior conviction for breaking the Knife Act and minor drug offenses.\nAccording to Aftonbladet’s information, the man will be extradited from Turkey to Sweden on Friday to face the pending charges.",

    "text": "MONROE, N.C. â€” A group of Monroe residents are suing East Frank Superette and Kitchen for allegedly using their photos and altering them by placing advertising over them.\nWCNC Charlotte has been following this controversy for a year . East Frank restaurant often holds drag shows during brunch. Some community members protested the shows and said children should not be allowed to attend. Many called on city leaders to shut down the performances all together. The restaurant argued it's the guardians' choice whether they bring a minor to the shows.\nPREVIOUS STORY: 'We sell out every single time we do it' | Union County restaurant sees pushback on social media after drag bingo events\nIt's been a year of back and forth, but now, the colorful drag shows have been met with the black-and-white text of a lawsuit . The suit claims the restaurant engaged in false advertising.\nThe attorney representing the plaintiffs Jason Sneed said the lawsuit claims East Frank used photos from people protesting the drag shows and then the altered the images.\nCredit: WCNC Charlotte Before and after Monroe protesters versus what East Franklin Superette and Kitchen turned it into\nMichelle Ball is one of the women suing the restaurant because she was featured in some of the changed photos.

    "text": "Four men, aged between 16 years old and 24 years old, have been detained and are being investigated for their suspected involvement in importing electronic vaporisers [1] (e-vaporisers) into Singapore via Tuas Checkpoint.\n2 On 21 December 2023, Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers at Tuas Checkpoint profiled and directed an arriving Singapore-registered car for secondary checks. During the inspection, officers uncovered 25 pieces of e-vaporisers and related components hidden below the driver’s and passenger’s seats, within a bag of food and within one of the subject’s clothing. The estimated street value of the seized e-vaporisers and components is estimated to be more than $200. The subjects and the seized exhibits were referred to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA).\n3 HSA’s investigations revealed that the men had purchased the e-vaporisers and related components from a shopping mall in Johor Bahru before attempting to enter Singapore using a car rented from a car-sharing platform.\n4 HSA will not hesitate to take stern enforcement actions on those who conduct illegal activities such as importing or selling prohibited e-vaporisers to members of the public.\nPenalties for such offences in Singapore 5 HSA would like to remind the public that it is an offence [2] to import, distribute, sell or offer for sale e-vaporisers and their components. Any person convicted of an offence is liable to a fine of up to $10,000, or imprisonment of up to six months or both for the first offence, and a fine of up to $20,000, or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both for the second or subsequent offence. All prohibited tobacco items will also be seized and confiscated.\nConsumer advisory 6 Safeguarding Singapore’s borders remains a top priority for ICA. ICA will continue to conduct security checks and work with relevant authorities to detect and deter smuggling attempts so as to keep Singapore safe.\n7 Members of the public are reminded that the possession, use or purchase of e-vaporisers is illegal and carries a maximum fine of $2000. Information pertaining to prohibited tobacco products in Singapore is available on the HSA website and more details about the harms of e-vaporisers can be found in this HealthHub article .\n8 Members of the public who have information on the illegal import, distribution, sale or offer for sale of e-vaporisers can contact HSA’s Tobacco Regulation Branch at Tel: 6684 2036 or 6684 2037 during office hours (9:00am to 5:30pm, Monday to Friday).\nHEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY\nIMMIGRATION & CHECKPOINTS AUTHORITY\nSINGAPORE\n28 DECEMBER 2023\n Download the PDF version here 640 KB",

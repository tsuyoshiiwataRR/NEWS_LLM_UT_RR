    "text": "Twin Cities real estate developer Kelly Doran, who founded both Doran Cos. and Doran Group, died overnight Thursday, Dec. 28, following a fight with cancer, a press release from the Doran Group announced. He was 66 years old. Doran, born in Duluth, was a leader in the multifamily housing industry, as well as in retail space. In 2007, he founded the powerhouse commercial real estate firm Doran Cos., which has three divisions — Doran Development, Doran Construction and Doran Management. In 2019, he sold his majority share in Doran Cos., before selling his final stakes in the company in 2021. He left the firm, now helmed by Anne Behrendt and Ryan Johnson, and started Doran Group, which he said at the time was so he could get back to building “the buildings that we own,” and that he “never liked doing third-party design and build work” that was performed at Doran Cos. Doran Group was a venture by Doran that he started with his son Evan Doran. Evan Doran is expected to take over the group, which he has helped lead since 2022 as president, according to the press release. “We are all saddened by my dad’s passing,” Evan Doran said. “He was not only an exceptional businessman, but also a loving father, grandfather and friend. He built this company from the ground up and instilled in all who worked with him a commitment to excellence, integrity and looking out for one another.” In an interview with Finance & Commerce earlier this month, Kelly Doran said Doran Group expects they will see 700 units in 2023, many of them luxury apartments. Some projects underway include The Reserve at Arbor Lakes in Maple Grove and a second building at The Triple Crown Residences at Canterbury in Shakopee. In the same interview, Kelly Doran said the processes for handing the reins to his son were underway and that he felt good about them. “He’s already doing a great job with what he’s taken on so far and I have no doubt that the future is bright for the company,” Kelly Doran said earlier this month. Prior to starting Doran Cos. in 2007, Doran was also the president of the Robert Muir Company from 1992 to 2005. In 2006, he launched a failed bid for the DFL nomination for governor.

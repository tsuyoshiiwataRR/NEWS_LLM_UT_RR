    "text": "[Transportation](/Subjects/00091-LAST-transportation.htm) • https://www.ericpetersautos.com, By eric [DieselGate II](https://www.ericpetersautos.com/2023/12/26/dieselgate-ii/) Cummins, the maker of diesel engines, has just \"agreed\" to pay the federal government $1.6 billion as penance for \"cheating\" federal emissions control requirements. It's VW all over again – and probably for the same reasons. Per the catcall media: \"The Justice Department accuses Cummins of installing defeat devices — which can bypass or defeat emissions controls — on 630,000 2013-2019 Ram 2500 and 3500 pickup truck engines, as well as undisclosed auxiliary emission control devices on 330,000 2019-2023 Ram 2500 and 3500 pickup truck engines.\" Italics added. In other words, not necessarily does bypass. As in the case of VW's \"cheating,\" the bypassing probably occurs only occasionally, as under wide open throttle operating conditions. The resultant \"emissions\" are higher than allowable. But are they significant? Merrick Beria-Garland, the lead inquisitor, insists yes. \"The types of devices we allege that Cummins installed in its engines to cheat federal environmental laws have a significant and harmful impact on people's health and safety,\" he j' accuses. But he does not substantiate. Instead, he asserts: \"Our preliminary estimates suggest that defeat devices on some Cummins engines have caused them to produce thousands of tons of excess emissions of nitrogen oxides.\"",

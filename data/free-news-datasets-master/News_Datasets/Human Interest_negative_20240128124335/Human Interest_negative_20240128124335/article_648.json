    "text": "Ten men whose jobs reportedly range from technology worker to yoga instructor, have been charged with attempting to solicit sex from children after a three-day sting operation by the Fairfax County Police Department.\nPolice Chief Kevin Davis announced Thursday that 10 men were arrested as a result of “Operation ADC Express 2,” which began on Dec. 18 and involved undercover detectives with the department’s Child Exploitation Unit posing online as 13 or 14-year-old teens.\nNoting that several of those arrested have criminal records, Davis said he’s “satisfied” to see that “10 predators are in jail this holiday season.”\n“We never know the true impact of taking one of these predators off the street, because ultimately, they offend again, again and again,” Davis said at the press conference. “It’s been my experience that the only way to interrupt the criminal misconduct of these types of predators is to incarcerate them, so that’s exactly what we did.”\nAccording to police, the undercover detectives encountered the suspects in online forums, where the men initiated “sexually related conversations” even though the detectives explicitly presented themselves as underaged.\nThe men were arrested when they attempted to meet the detectives, who they believed were teens, at an agreed-upon “familiar public place,” Davis said.\nCollectively facing 25 felony charges, all of the suspects were in custody at the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center without bond, as of Thursday morning, according to police.\nThe arrests include:\n- Michael Flannery, 33, of Winchester was arrested and charged with Attempted Indecent Liberties and Computer-Solicitation of Child Under 15-Years-Old.\n- Casto Ian Unson III, 35, of Vienna was arrested and charged with Attempted Indecent Liberties and Computer-Solicitation of Child Under 15-Years-Old.\n- Ravi Vongavolu, 24, of Herndon was arrested and charged with Attempted Indecent Liberties and Computer-Solicitation of Child Under 15-Years-Old.\n- Rabiul Islam, 44, of Arlington was arrested and charged with Attempted Indecent Liberties and Computer-Solicitation of Child Under 15-Years-Old and Attempted Production of CSAM.\n- Osman Aslan, 30, of Vienna was arrested and charged with Attempted Indecent Liberties and Computer-Solicitation of Child Under 15-Years-Old.\n- Estuardo Orozco Orozco, 27, of Falls Church was arrested and charged with Computer-Solicitation of Child Under 15-Years-Old.\n- Mohamed Elnefili, 38, of Qatar was arrested and charged with Attempted Indecent Liberties and Computer-Solicitation of Child Under 15-Years-Old. He was currently staying in Springfield at the time of his arrest.\n- Roy Hayes, 22 of Herndon was arrested and charged with Attempted Indecent Liberties and Computer-Solicitation of Child Under 15-Years-Old.\n- Imran Ahmad, 42, of Ashburn was arrested and charged with Attempted Indecent Liberties and Computer-Solicitation of Child Under 15-Years-Old.\n- Bassem Karam, 36, of Herndon was arrested and charged with Attempted Indecent Liberties and Computer-Solicitation of Child Under 15-Years-Old.\nPolice officials urged parents to have conversations with their children about safely using apps and social media and avoiding inappropriate interactions with strangers online, suggesting the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children as a resource.\nAccording to Davis, one of the FCPD’s goals for 2024 is to conduct more operations similar to this three-day crackdown.\n“Our community can expect to see more of this in 2024, because our children deserve it,” he said.",

    "text": "The Telegraph Brighton are no Premier League nice guys – they are horrible to play against Read full article Thom Gibbs 29 December 2023 at 0:11 am · 3-min read Captain Lewis Dunk helps to give Brighton an uncompromising edge - Reuters/John Silbey\nFrom a distance, the patronising assumption is that Brighton and Hove Albion are one of the “nice” football clubs. Their feelgood comeback story, from when the record label Skint was a grimly apposite shirt sponsor; the cheerful gull on the emblem; the dozens of keen young boys poring over spreadsheets in an underground scouting bunker. What is not to like? Plenty, if you are unfortunate enough to be playing against them.\nTottenham were terrorised into nervy mistakes from scrambled thinking in the first half, punished every time they hesitated. Danny Welbeck closed down Ben Davies to win a corner, the Spurs defender punched the air in anger. Seeing his team so cowed with their passing, the otherwise impassive Ange Postecoglou span around in frustration as one too many balls was worked backwards.\nThe Spurs manager would prefer his team to be on the front foot forever, but Brighton gave them little opportunity for 80 minutes, playing with a physicality and speed Spurs could not match.\nThere were glimpses of vulnerability. Spurs targeted left-back Igor Julio with occasional success in the first half but Pervis Estupinan replaced him at the break, a weak link immediately tightened by a full-back who can casually slam in a third goal from 30 yards.\nIt is all led by Roberto De Zerbi, who looks like a complete nightmare to work for. Within minutes he was swearing at his colleagues on the bench as if they were the ones who failed to award a foul for a marginally too-strong Tottenham challenge. Any balls sent out of play but into his orbit were caught or controlled as if to make a point: standards. Even when it literally does not matter.\nRoberto De Zerbi has the respect and ear of his players - Reuters/Dylan Martinez He clearly has the ear of his players and it does not hurt to have the fans helping to build a siege mentality. After one debatable decision against, with the manager’s recent broadsides at referees fresh in the mind, the home supporters chanted “De Zerbi’s right / the refs are s----”. No let up from assistant Andrea Maldera either, bad cop to De Zerbi’s worse cop, who seemed furious with sub Carlos Baleba for failing to return quickly enough from a touchline warm-up.\nStory continues None of this would fly if the results were not forthcoming or, crucially, if it were not fun. It is an odd feature of Brighton’s galaxy-brained recruitment strategy that they rely on some players who are apparently past their peak. Danny Welbeck, with career seemingly in decline, looks utterly re-energised, James Milner is still playing at the ripe old age of 83, started off in the middle then drifted onto the left wing and hit a post at 2-0 with a long range screamer which would have brought the house down.\nThere is plenty of skill too, Brighton’s tenacity earning their flair players to deploy their talents when appropriate. The first goal came after Joao Pedro took a circuitous but high-speed route around a baffled Spurs defence. But mostly you notice Brighton’s grit.\nEvery corner is a threat, every high ball is contested with gusto, enormous centre backs Lewis Dunk and Jan Paul van Hecke used their physicality to the limit of the rules. Joao Pedro took a mild brush in the face from Richarlison as his invitation to roll around as if assaulted with an anvil. Usually this is behaviour which turns other clubs’ fans against you, but Brighton’s intensity does the opposite. Their clear fallibility at the back helps.\nAn untidy end to their game made the final minutes needlessly tense, with their occasionally frantic defending finally punished after a number of offside reprieves. Dunk looked too tired to challenge Ben Davies for Spurs’ second and a game which seemed settled stayed exciting to the end.\nHere is something for the neutrals, steel and softness together. At both ends, Brighton are thrilling to watch when playing like this.\nTRENDING 1. Experience: I’m a world champion pea thrower 2. The 10 greatest commentary moments in sports history 3.

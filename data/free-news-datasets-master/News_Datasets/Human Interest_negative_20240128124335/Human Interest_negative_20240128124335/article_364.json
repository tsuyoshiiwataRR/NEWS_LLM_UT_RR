    "text": "Section Branding\nHeader Content\nPierce Brosnan faces charges after allegedly walking in Yellowstone's thermal areas\nPrimary Content\nActor Pierce Brosnan could be facing possible jail time after allegedly walking in Yellowstone National Park's hydrothermal areas in violation of federal law, according to court documents.\nBrosnan is facing citations of \"foot travel in all thermal areas and w/in Yellowstone Canyon confined to trails\" and \"violating closures and use limits,\" the court record shows.\nCriminal charges were filed against the Irish actor in Wyoming on Tuesday.\nFederal law states: \"Foot travel in all thermal areas and within the Yellowstone Canyon between the Upper Falls and Inspiration Point must be confined to boardwalks or trails that are maintained for such travel and are marked by official signs.\"\nA representative for the 70-year-old Brosnan, who is best known\nfor his stint as James Bond in films in the 1990s, didn't respond to NPR's request for comment.\nWhat's the big deal?\nWithin Yellowstone National Park's roughly 2.2 million acres there\nare more than 10,000 different hydrothermal features, like geysers and hot springs.\nThe park provides many\nguidelines and warnings online and throughout the park for visitors to be aware of the dangers posed by hot springs and the like.\nThe park says, \"Hot springs have injured or killed more people in Yellowstone than any other natural feature.\" More than 20 people have died after entering or accidentally falling into Yellowstone's hot springs,\naccording to the park because certain thermal pools can reach deadly temperatures of over 150 degrees Fahrenheit.\nStill, a number of visitors to the park, like allegedly Brosnan,\nviolate this law when they visit Yellowstone â€” some incidents leading to serious injury or even death.\nIn August, a 49-year-old Michigan man was arraigned in federal court for traveling off-trail in Yellowstone's thermal area. Jason Wicks suffered thermal burns and was banned from Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks until his criminal charges are resolved,\naccording to the park.\nOther violators in recent years have\nfaced a week to a 10-day jail sentence, hundreds of dollars in fines and a lengthy ban from Yellowstone.\nBrosnan's court appearance is set for Jan. 23.\nCopyright 2023 NPR.

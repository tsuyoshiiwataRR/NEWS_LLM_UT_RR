    "text": "UTICA, N.Y. (WKTV) -- According to the CNYSPCA, there has been an increase in the number of animals coming to the shelter through dog control and animal cruelty cases. CNYSPCA points to the increases in foreclosures, evictions and living situations as reasons that could contribute to the upward trend. “The number of animals being surrendered, dumped or found in unsafe and unclean conditions is increasing rapidly,” Troy Waffner, director of CNYSPCA, said. “Unfortunately,\" Waffner continued, \"the picture it is painting is not a pretty one for our most vulnerable pets as their families are being displaced by changes in their lives and living situations.” The shelter said that there has been an 85 percent increase in the number of animals seized through its cruelty investigations. Additionally, there has been a 16 percent increase in the number of animals picked up as strays through dog control. “The almost doubling of cruelty seizures in one year is a travesty – the cases we saw this year ranged from hoarding to physical abuse on pets,” Waffner said. “It breaks your heart but also causes you to really focus on the question of what is causing the increase and how do we stop the cycle of abuse.” They have seen an 11 percent increase in adoptions recently, which can be attributed largely to their improved marketing efforts. “The silver lining in all of this is that we have been working harder than ever to place all of these animals, and we are seeing the results of that as there has been an increase in adoptions of all of our animals going into loving new forever homes,” Waffner said. In 2023, the shelter saw 303 surrenders, 404 seized animals and the intake of 537 strays. There were 958 adoptions this year. “Looking ahead to 2024, there are things we can do to try to help the situation including offering low cost spay/neuter programs, vaccination programs, microchipping and more to try to help pet owners who want to keep their animals but may not be able to afford all of the needed services a pet requires,” Waffner said. CNYSPCA, which was founded in 1891, serves all of Madison and Oneida counties. For more information on the CNYSPCA, [click here](https://cnyspca.org/).",

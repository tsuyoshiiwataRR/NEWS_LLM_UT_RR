    "text": "The organizer of a cancelled Christmas craft market in Abbotsford still has not responded to vendors’ requests for thousands of dollars in refunds or an explanation about why she has ignored them. But the Abbotsford Police Department (APD) has indicated the matter is not likely to be pursued criminally. The Abbotsford News first reported at the end of November that several vendors had spoken out after not receiving refunds for table rentals at the Krafted Handmade Christmas Market. The event, organized by Ange Eely of West Kelowna, had been scheduled to run Nov. 30 to Dec. 3 at the Ag-Rec Building at Abbotsford Exhibition Park. The city has indicated that Eely paid the full amount to book the building – a total of $12,408 for the four-day market – plus a $500 security deposit, but did not cancel the event or request a refund. RELATED: [Vendors at cancelled Abbotsford craft market say organizer has ‘ghosted’ them](https://www.abbynews.com/news/vendors-at-cancelled-abbotsford-craft-market-say-organizer-has-ghosted-them-7114752) The market had been advertised mainly on Facebook, with application forms available on the Krafted Canada website. It was estimated that 130 vendors had signed up, with some paying as much as $1,000 for the space. A post on an artisan-related Facebook page on Nov. 6 from a friend of Eely’s indicated the event was being cancelled due to her requiring “emergency surgery.” Another post indicated that an email would be sent out when Eely was recovered, and she would offer vendors a choice of a refund or a move to another Krafted Canada market in 2024. Within days of those posts, the Krafted Canada website was taken down, as was Eely’s private Facebook page. Emails to Eely bounced back, phone calls were not answered and private messages were not returned. The Abbotsford News also attempted to contact Eely at four email addresses – two of which bounced back – and by text message and through a friend. As of Thursday, Dec. 28, neither The Abbotsford News nor the vendors had heard from Eely. The vendors’ frustration led to the formation of a Facebook group to discuss options for receiving their refunds. Some said they have had the charges reversed on their credit cards – although it took time to occur – but others, including those who paid by e-transfer, haven’t been as successful. APD media officer Const. Art Stele said police have received at least one report about Eely and are aware of the situation, but a fraud investigation is not likely. “It would be dependent on the evidence from the various parties and, at this stage, it’s not likely to be pursued criminally,” he said. Stele recommended that those impacted take action through the Civil Resolution Tribunal, through which parties can resolve disputes under $5,000. The process is conducted entirely online and doesn’t require lawyers, he said.",

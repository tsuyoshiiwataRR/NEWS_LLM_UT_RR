    "text": "Ana Fa Lavaka, 43, allegedly stabbed in the chestDorothy Jane Downie, 55, charged with murderREAD MORE: Alleged murder in upper-class suburb\nA woman who was allegedly murdered by her neighbour has been described by grief-stricken loved ones as a ‘devoted daughter, sister and mother’.\nAna Fa Lavaka, 43, was allegedly murdered by Dorothy Jane Downie, 55, in a unit complex on Oxford Street in Hamilton, Brisbane, at about 8.45am on Thursday.\nEmergency services found the mother-of-one critically injured from multiple wounds including a stab wound to the chest.\nShe was rushed to the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital where doctors pronounced her dead as a result of her injuries.\nDownie appeared before the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday where she was charged with murder and enter dwelling with intent.\nAna Fa Lavaka, 43, (pictured) was allegedly murdered by Dorothy Jane Downie, 55, in a unit complex on Oxford Street in Hamilton, Brisbane, at 8.45am on Thursday\nForensic were seen putting evidence into brown paper bags at the home on Thursday\nEmergency services found Ms Lavaka critically injured at the Hamilton unit complex (pictured)\nMs Lavaka’s relative, Ana Kauffusi, shared a tribute online in the hours after the alleged murder.\n‘ Both born in the same year, same month… I was older than you by 22 days. B1 and B2,’ she wrote.\n‘You would always hate it when I tell everyone you were named after me.\n‘We had plans for our 50th birthday. You wanted to go on a cruise clearly knowing I get sea sick.\n‘I stayed up last night waiting for your call cos (sic) we had a lot to complain about for yesterday.’\nOthers from Ms Lavaka’s local Tongan community shared their sympathies for her family on social media.\n‘Ana was known to many as our avid baker, devoted daughter, sister and most importantly mother to her beautiful daughter Amelia,’ one person wrote.\nIn court, police prosecutor Tara Williams made an urgent forensic request for a sample of Downie’s blood before it was too late, the Courier Mail reports.\n‘The urgency is in relation to the level of drugs whether prescription or non-prescription present in her blood at the time,’ she told the court.\n‘Over time the longer it takes to deal with this application the levels are going to change your honour. It’s going to result in incomplete information for the prosecution and for the defence to consider.’\nDownie’s defence, Daniel Hannay, said police believed his client had a history of ‘delusions of grandeur and psychosis’, which he had yet to address.\nMr Hannay said Downie needed to first be attended to by a mental health nurse and did not oppose Sgt Williams’ request for a blood sample.\nMs Lavaka died at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital on Thursday\nA crime scene was set up at the Oxford Street complex (pictured) on Thursday\nDetectives (pictured) arrived at the public housing unit complex to door-knock residents\nMagistrate Hackett said that despite Downie’s mental health issues, the evidence requested by Sgt Williams had the ‘potential to be highly relevant and could be lost’.\nNo application was made for bail and Downie did not appear in court on Friday.\nShe was remanded in custody and will not be required to attend her next court appearance on February 14.\nDetective Inspector John Mison confirmed officers had attended the unit complex previously ‘on a number of occasions’.\n‘This is a very sad tragic loss of life,’ he told reporters on Thursday.\nThe unit complex is multi-unit public housing run by the Department of Housing.\nAnyone who may have information is urged contact Crime Stoppers.",

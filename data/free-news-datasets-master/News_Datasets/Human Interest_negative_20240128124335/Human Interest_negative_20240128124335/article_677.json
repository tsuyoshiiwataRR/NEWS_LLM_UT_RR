    "text": "The US army has confirmed that the man who [murdered a Louth woman at her home in New York](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41270170.html) was a former soldier. Denise Morgan, from Tullyallen suffered a gunshot wound to the head and neck during a row with her former partner Joed A Taveras in Queens on October 21. The mother of one had ended the relationship and was preparing to move to a new apartment with her daughter when she died. When police arrived on the scene, they discovered the remains of Ms Morgan and Mr Tavaras, who had turned the gun on himself. In a statement, the US army press office told thethat Mr Tavaras held a previous position of “specialist” within the defence forces. “He held the rank of specialist at the end of service,\" it said. “Due to Privacy Act constraints, we are unable to provide the characterization of discharge for any soldier. “Army policy controls a current soldier’s access to government firearms and participation in live fire exercises but does not extend to possession of personal firearms by former soldiers.\" An online obituary for Mr Tavaras said he served four years as a tanker, deploying in 2013, before he was “dishonourably discharged”. Ms Morgan’s family previously told thethat they will “never get justice” for Denise, but that they wanted to warn others about the dangers of controlling behaviours. Lisa Morgan said: “He was trying to cut her off from people. “I was though, afraid of what he would do if he knew Denise was leaving. There were red flags and we knew he was controlling. But no one expected this. We just hope that people will be careful when they are leaving an abusive relationship because she was living with him for five years. You would never see this coming.\"",

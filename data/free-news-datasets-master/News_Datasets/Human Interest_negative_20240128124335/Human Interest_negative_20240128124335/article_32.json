    "text": "Brisbane nurse Storm Doncon can't afford to see family this Christmas READ MORE: The salary Aussies are now earning to be in the middle\nAustralia’s cost of living crisis has stopped low-paid workers from being able to see their loved ones at Christmas.\nStorm Doncon, an agency nurse in Brisbane, spends $220 a week living in a share house and another $70 on petrol driving to hospitals and nursing homes for work.\nFor helping those in need when permanent nursing staff are in short supply, those expenses account for more than a third of her $832 weekly pay after tax.\nAs a 28-year-old casual worker who recently graduated from Queensland University of Technology, her $50,000 salary before tax isn’t much more than the $45,906 full-time minimum wage.\nAustralia’s cost of living crisis is now stopping low-paid workers from being able to see their loved ones at Christmas. Storm Doncon, an agency nurse in Brisbane, spends $220 a week living in a share house and another $70 on petrol driving to hospitals and nursing homes for work\nThe surging cost of living means Ms Doncon wasn’t be able to fly down to Melbourne this year to spend time with his parents and two brothers.\n‘I always miss them,’ she told Daily Mail Australia.\nThe overall weekly rent on her inner-city Coorparoo share house she lives in with two others this year rose by 15 per cent to $655 a week.\n‘All of my friends rent and live in share houses,’ she said.\nBrisbane’s rental vacancy rate of 1 per cent is even tighter than Melbourne’s 1.3 per cent level and Sydney’s 1.4 per cent mark, SQM Research data showed.\nThis is occurring after Queensland saw 32,255 new residents move from interstate, on a net basis, during the last financial year as overseas immigration hit a record-high of 518,100.\nWhile she likes her housemates, who are also her friends, Ms Doncon is annoyed she can’t rent on her own with enough space for her family to come and stay with her.\n‘All our family are interstate so we can’t really have people here comfortably,’ she said.\nMs Doncon isn’t optimistic about inflation coming down next year, despite Reserve Bank predictions of easing price pressures.\n‘I’ve kind of seen it get higher every year so I just don’t see it going down,’ she said.\n‘I just try and make it work, I try not to get too stressed about money.’\nInflation in October moderated to 4.9 per cent, down from a 32-year high of 7.8 per cent at the end of 2022.\nBut it’s still significantly higher than the Reserve Bank’s two to three per cent target.\nMs Doncon is a casual worker who is regularly on call to fill nursing shortages, which means she isn’t entitled to annual leave or sick leave.\nAs a 28-year-old casual worker who recently graduated from Queensland University of Technology, her $50,000 salary before tax isn’t much more than the $45,906 full-time minimum wage\nDespite having a small hatchback, her weekly petrol bills typically range from $60 to $70, often having to drive an hour away for work in places like Logan and Ipswich in heavy traffic.\nAs for Christmas Day, Ms Doncon won’t be spending big on presents or a lavish meal, despite already cutting back on food spending throughout the year.\n‘Maybe just a quiet one,’ she said.\n‘I’d love to go to the beach or something but I guess it depends on what the weather’s doing up here.’\nRenters in particular are struggling the most with an InfoChoice survey of 1,000 renters showing 59 per cent of them would be spending less this Christmas because of their rising housing costs.\nThe survey also showed 13 per cent of them could not afford Christmas presents and 2.6 per cent did not have enough for a Christmas tree.\nA majority or 58 per cent of renters had changed their holiday plans, with 21 per cent choosing a cheaper Christmas option, and 37 per cent scrapping their Christmas holiday entirely.\nBrisbane’s rental vacancy rate of 1 per cent is even tighter than Melbourne’s 1.3 per cent level and Sydney’s 1.4 per cent mark (Bondi rent queue, pictured), SQM Research data showed\nInfoChoice money analyst Harrison Astbury said renters in particular were cutting back on Christmas spending just so they could pay their bills.\n‘The connection between rental rises and reduced Christmas spending isn’t a fluke,’ he said.\n‘High rents are literally sucking the money out of household budgets and forcing these cutbacks.\n‘Cutting back on food, gifts and travel at Christmas is the last thing that most people want to do but if there is a choice between putting a roof over your head and celebrating, then shelter comes first.’",

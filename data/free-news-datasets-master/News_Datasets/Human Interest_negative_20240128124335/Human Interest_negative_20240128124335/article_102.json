    "text": "From: Correctional Service Canada\nNews release On December 25, 2023, as a result of the vigilance of staff members, a package containing several prohibited and unauthorized items was seized on the perimeter of Drummond Institution, a medium-security federal institution.\nDecember 28, 2023 – Drummondville, Quebec – Correctional Service Canada\nOn December 25, 2023, as a result of the vigilance of staff members, a package containing several prohibited and unauthorized items was seized on the perimeter of Drummond Institution, a medium-security federal institution.\nThe contraband and unauthorized items seized included hashish, cannabis, tobacco and cell phones with accessories. In total, the institutional value of the seized items is estimated at $33,300.\nThe Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) uses a number of tools to prevent drugs from entering its institutions. These tools include ion scanners and drug-detector dogs to search buildings, personal property, inmates, and visitors.\nThe CSC is heightening measures to prevent contraband from entering its institutions in order to help ensure a safe and secure environment for everyone. CSC also works in partnership with the police to take action against those who attempt to introduce contraband into correctional institutions.\nCSC has also set up a telephone tip line for all federal institutions so that it may receive additional information about activities relating to security at CSC institutions. These activities may be related to drug use or trafficking that may threaten the safety and security of visitors, inmates, and staff members working at CSC institutions.\nThe toll-free number, 1‑866‑780‑3784, helps ensure that the information shared is protected and that callers remain anonymous.\nContacts Elyse Sullivan\nAssistant Warden, Management Services\nDrummond Institution\n(819) 477-5112 ext. 210\nFollow the Correctional Service of Canada on Twitter and Facebook .\nFor more information, please visit the website .",

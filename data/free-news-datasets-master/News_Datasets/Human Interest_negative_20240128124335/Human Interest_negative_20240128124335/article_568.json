    "text": "Aljaz Skorjanec and Janette Manrara on Escape to the Country (Image: INSTAGRAM) Escape To The Country fans have exploded with rage over the celebrity edition of the show, exclaiming: \"Just because you can make a celebrity version doesn't mean you should!\" One follower exclaimed on Twitter (X) last night that it was \"out of touch\" and \"condescending\" to feature \"two rich celebrities shopping for houses that are pushing £1m on a property show at 7pm on the BBC \".\nAnother enraged viewer blasted: \"Our licence fee is paying for their house in the f g country!!! Talk about rubbing it in our noses! Who the f*** commissioned this?!!\" Some viewers didn't think much of the properties featured either, with one claiming that, despite the potentially eye-watering price tag, it looked as if it was set in \"the middle of a council estate\".\n\"Nothing about this episode is watchable. And please explain why 'celebrities' need help finding properties?\" asked another incredulously. The celebrities ruffling so many feathers were Strictly Come Dancing stars Aljaz Skorjanec and Janette Manrara , with the latter a regular fixture on our TV screens presenting It Takes Two this year.\n\"The only thing more irritating than this pair is the clap, I imagine!\" one tweeter groaned, while another blasted: \"If she says wow one more time, I will scream \" The couple had headed to rural Cheshire on the lookout for a new location after Janette gave birth to their daughter Lyra Rose earlier this year.\nThe dancer announced her return to work just weeks after Lyra was born, whereas Aljaz volunteered to do the lion's share of childcare so that she could continue TV hosting. That left one more issue to resolve - where the couple were going to live.\nREAD MORE: Jasmine Harman addresses 'depressing' family Christmas abroad after quitting UK [LATEST]\nThe married pair had been renting, but were hoping to put down more permanent roots.\nThey looked like they were having a great time on the show, hanging out with miniature ponies in tranquil Knutsford and generally enjoying the joys of the remote countryside.\nThis week, Janette took to her Instagram account to confirm that their property-hunting experience had been \"special\".\n\"We did some very special filming today in our new place we call home.

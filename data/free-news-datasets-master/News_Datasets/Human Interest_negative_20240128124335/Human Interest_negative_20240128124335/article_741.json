    "text": "Carroll C. Weigen, age 90 passed away at Hyland Crossings in Sun Prairie on Wednesday, December 27, 2023. She was born on November 14, 1933 in Madison and was the daughter of Herbert and Colletta (Brown) Retzlaff. She married Charles Weigen on June 20, 1964 at St. James in Madison. Carroll worked for the Wisconsin Conservation Department for 17 years and as the Westside Elementary School secretary in Sun Prairie from 1977 to 1994. Carroll was a faithful servant of our Lord, Jesus Christ. She was a loving mother, who selflessly gave her heart to all she knew and loved. She was an avid bowler, a dedicated Wisconsin Badger Fan, and most of all, she enjoyed spending time with her family. She was “Mother Hen” who was happiest when all her chickens were with her. We love you mom and we’re happy that you are now dancing with dad. She is survived by: 2 sons, Timothy (Kendra) Weigen of Tomah, James Weigen of Sun Prairie; a daughter Cynthia (Paul) Kohler of Appleton; grandchildren Adam and John Kohler, Jacqueline Weigen, Amanda and Alexander Weigen; grandchildren, Terra, Sandra and Kristina; 10 great grandchildren and many nieces and nephews and 2 special friends Sue and Barb.",

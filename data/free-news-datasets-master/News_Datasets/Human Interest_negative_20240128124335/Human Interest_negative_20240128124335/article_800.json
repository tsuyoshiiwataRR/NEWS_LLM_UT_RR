Photo: Reproduction TikTok @supermariozelaya\nMario Zelaya posted a video on social media recounting the uncomfortable situation he faced after his Tesla automatically locked itself. + Click here to watch the video + Passenger documents the moment a man invades her personal space in the airplane window seat\nMario Zelaya from Canada posted a video on TikTok, totaling around 18.7 million views, in which he angrily referred to his $140,000 Tesla as a “piece of garbage” as he showed that his vehicle had automatically locked itself after the battery ran out.\nMario then revealed that his Tesla wouldn’t open the doors, and thus, he couldn’t get into the car. He even considered using ownership documents to sell the vehicle, but they were all trapped inside the car. Subsequently, after realizing that the cost of a battery replacement would be around $26,000, he was outraged.\nHe also mentioned that he had been in contact with other Tesla owners who had exactly the same problem, sparking a wave of dissatisfaction among users. Fortunately, Mario was lucky, and by paying $30, he obtained a second copy of the documents and could sell the car.\nBut undoubtedly, this was the last vehicle of that brand that he had: “This will be the end of my Tesla journey. It’s out of my life. Keep it out of yours too,” expressed the driver.",

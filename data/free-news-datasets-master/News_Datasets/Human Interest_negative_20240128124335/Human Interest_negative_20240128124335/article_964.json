    "text": "SAN ANTONIO — The holiday season [brought confusion and heartbreak](/article/news/local/savanah-soto-pregnant-teen-disappeared-induced-matthew-guerra/273-7a256266-d755-4e99-8feb-381bd2bc08ed) for two San Antonio families after a pregnant woman and her boyfriend were found dead a few days after going missing. Savanah Soto and Matthew Guerra were found dead with gunshot wounds in a locked car this week. Police have classified their investigation as a capital murder case, and released footage of two unidentified persons of interest they are seeking. Here's everything we know about the case so far, with new information added as it is revealed. When did Soto go missing? Leon Valley police [issued a CLEAR Alert ](/article/news/local/leon-valley-police-searching-pregnant-18-year-old/273-78d1e73c-8a72-46a2-bd35-99ed9483ba0d)for the 18-year-old on Christmas, after she was scheduled to go to the hospital Saturday to be induced. She never showed up. Family members said they hadn't heard from Soto since Friday, and [started organizing searches](/article/news/local/family-organizes-search-for-missing-pregnant-teen-christmas-night/273-c734f696-7c9c-4e22-be5a-48894d408550) on Christmas night. On Tuesday, police also said Guerra, Soto's 22-year-old boyfriend, was [considered a missing person](/article/news/local/savanah-soto-boyfriend-missing-disappearance-pregnant-teen-induced-police/273-cf19fbee-70fa-4994-81cb-0206dfc4bcca). How were they found? A family member on Tuesday was alerted about a car found in an apartment complex in the Medical Center area of San Antonio. Authorities confirmed to KENS 5 that Soto and Guerra were found inside, dead from gunshot wounds to the head. SAPD also said in a report that an unborn baby was dead, and Police Chief William McManus said it's believed the car was in the parking lot for three to four days. McManus said it wasn't immediately clear what had happened that led to the two victims' deaths. Relatives say Soto was found in the front seat with a car seat on top of her, while Guerra's body was in the back seat. \"It's a very, very perplexing crime scene,\" McManus said Tuesday evening, in an update to news media and family members who had congregated at the complex. \"Detectives are looking at this as a possible murder, but we're not sure. We can't say for sure what we have.\" SAPD has since classified their case as a capital murder investigation. Have police arrested anyone? San Antonio police haven't identified any suspects in the case, but on Thursday afternoon authorities [released footage](https://twitter.com/SATXPolice/status/1740486837565886590) of two persons of interested they're seeking in the investigation. One is seen driving a dark pickup truck, the other driving the silver car Soto and Guerra were found in. Anyone with information about the vehicles or individuals seen in the video is asked to call SAPD at (210) 207-7674 or (210) 207-7440. Another update is expected around 3:30 p.m. Thursday. What have the families said? \"It breaks my heart,\" Soto's mother, Gloria Cordova, told KENS 5 before her daughter was eventually found. Cordova said Soto was [making final preparations ](/article/news/local/who-killed-savanah-soto-her-unborn-baby-matthew-guerra-both-families-speak-out/273-6877248a-fade-4124-8b0a-5ee472aab874)to be a mom, having completed a nursery. But when Cordova tried to check on Soto at her apartment on Saturday, no one answered. Now the Soto family, along with police and Guerra's relatives, are on similar searches for answers. “I hope they pay for whatever they did to my daughter,” Cordova told KENS 5 on Wednesday, saying she had had a bad feeling that something terrible had happened to her daughter and Fabian. \"It's not something that a mom ever wants to hear. I didn't want to accept it.\" Cordova said she suspects Guerra was involved with illegal activity. His father says he knew his son had a criminal history including unlawful carry of a weapon, evading police and an assault charge causing bodily injury. “He didn’t hang around the best crowd,” Gabriel Guerra said. He confirmed the assault charge involved Soto on Christmas 2022. However, he said, the two had been in a good place ever since and living together in Leon Valley. “They were inseparable,\" Gabriel Guerra said. \"Was it a perfect relationship? No, but she definitely was not a prisoner there. Her and Matthew were both overjoyed and couldn’t wait for Fabian’s arrival.” He believed Matthew was going to change for the better once he became a father. “He talked about how it was going to make him better, a better person,” Gabriel Guerra said. How can the community help?

    "text": "Her reaction to the Gérard Depardieu affair caused a lot of talk, Lucie Lucas decided to break her silence. On Thursday, the actress spoke to franceinfo about the op-ed signed by some fifty artists in support of the actor, who has been indicted for rape and accused by many women of sexual assault. She also returned to her writings targeting the actress Victoria Abril, who signed the text, with whom she toured extensively.\nIt all starts on Tuesday on Instagram. The actress Charlotte Arnould, one of Gérard Depardieu's accusers, published on the social network the list of signatories of the op-ed in support of the actor. In the comments, Lucie Lucas gets angry.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Charlotte Arnould (@__charlottearnould__)\n\"Do you want us to talk about your many assaults, including sexual assaults on your partners?\" \"I've been an actress for 15 years and I've been protecting a lot of these degenerate boomers by not telling in interviews all the harm they do to others on a film set (...) I have a lot to say about some of the people on this delightful list of co-signers,\" she writes. Before directly attacking Victoria Abril, who plays the role of her mother in the series Clem : \"You want us to talk about your many assaults, including sexual assaults against your partners? Come to think of it, I'm not surprised you signed this tea towel... You're freaking out too, and when you think about it, you're right.\"\nActress Lucie Lucas looks back on her sensational statements against Victoria Abril, her former co-star in the series Clem on TF1.\n\"It's not Victoria Abril that I'm accusing,\" the actress explains, while saying she was \"abandoned and betrayed\" by her \"movie mom.\" pic.twitter.com/wfEnEa3n3k\n— franceinfo (@franceinfo) December 28, 2023\nOn Thursday, at the microphone of Franceinfo, Lucie Lucas clarified her statements about her colleague. \"The sexual violence I'm accusing him of wasn't directed at me, but it's something I witnessed,\" the actress said. It's not Victoria Abril I want to accuse. I had this kind of rush of blood. Maybe I allowed myself to do that, because she's my cinema mom and I felt deeply betrayed and abandoned.\"\n\"Tyrannizing over entire plateaus\" More than a particular actor or actress, Lucie Lucas targets a generation of comedians. \"What I would like to denounce is that there is impunity, a feeling of impunity that is total among some people and especially among certain people from the generations of Gérard Depardieu and Victoria Abril, who allow themselves to tyrannize entire sets and to behave in ways that I do not find acceptable or even legal.\"\nVictoria Abril has not, for the moment, commented on Lucie Lucas' statements. But actor Kevin Elarbi, who starred alongside the two actresses in the series Clem, defended her on X (ex-Twitter): \"Victoria Abril has integrity, and has her freedom of expression. Whether you agree with it or not, she has the right to speak. Without a fascist dictatorship of censorship. I told her yesterday that she can be assured of my unconditional support. It was an honour to work with her on Clem.\"",

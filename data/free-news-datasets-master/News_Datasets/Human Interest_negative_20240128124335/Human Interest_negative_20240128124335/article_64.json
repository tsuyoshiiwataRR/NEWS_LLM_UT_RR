    "text": "December 28, 2023 The death this week of the former head of the Lebanese Jewish Community Council has shed light on the country’s dwindling Jewish community at a time of heightened tensions with neighboring Israel.\nIsaac Arazi, 80, died on Tuesday and was buried on the same day in Beirut's Jewish cemetery, lawyer Bassem el-Hout told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Wednesday.\nAccording to his obituary, Arazi pushed for the renovation project of the Magen Abraham synagogue located in the Jewish district of Wadi Abu Jamil in downtown Beirut. The synagogue, which was built in 1925, was looted and heavily damaged during Lebanon’s civil war (1975-1990).\nThe Jewish Community Council that Arazi headed funded the renovations launched in 2009 through $200,000 worth of private donations. Lebanese construction firm Solidere donated another $150,000, according to a 2009 Haaretz report.\nAccess the Middle East news and analysis you can trust Join our community of Middle East readers to experience all of Al-Monitor, including 24/7 news, analyses, memos, reports and newsletters.\nSubscribe Only $100 per year.\nSign up for our newsletter Email Daily AM\nDaily Briefing New Weekly\nThe Takeaway Weekly\nWeek in Review Weekly\nBusiness & Tech Briefing Weekly\nSecurity Briefing Weekly\nChina-Middle East Briefing Weekly\nGulf Briefing Weekly\nTurkey Briefing Weekly\nIsrael Briefing Weekly\nPalestine Briefing Leave this field blank Videos The Israel-Hamas War: Live Q&A with Amb.

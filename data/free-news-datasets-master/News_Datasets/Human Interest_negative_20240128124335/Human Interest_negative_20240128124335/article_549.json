It’s just people who want to give people the best chance to succeed and thrive in life.\n“When you think about the family, it’s about stability.\n“Most of the kids who struggle in Bury are the products of crap parents and so what do we do to try to address that issue?\n“On the left it would just be we’ll throw money at this and hope something sticks, somebody like me thinks about this more fundamentally.”\nJames Frith, Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidate for Bury North, said: “It is revealing to see how little James Daly thinks of his own constituents.\n“Rather than insulting the parenting skills of people in Bury, he should look closer to home.\n“Over the last 13 years the Conservatives have failed to grow our economy, protect our public services or provide opportunities for young people in Bury and across the UK.”",

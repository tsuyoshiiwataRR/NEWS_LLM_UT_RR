Within the first 24-hours the superintendent had eight or nine different groups of people and had to ask them to get off the lot,” said LeBLanc.\nHe’s witnessed drug use all around his property and people blocking the main entrance of the building.\n“[People] getting high, just trying to stay warm. I've got a baby barn, there's a corner, same thing there. They hang out there. They do their drugs,” said LeBlanc.\nTenant Michelle Donnelly said she's too scared to go outside without a companion.\n“For the last two years I don't think I've gone and taken my garbage out myself because I'm too afraid to go out back. I have a son who comes to visit me. He takes my garbage out for me. I will not go out back,” said Donnelly.\nThe building is just a few doors down from the\nHarvest House homeless shelter.\nManaging director Leon Baker said he's aware of the issue and is working with LeBlanc. However, he said the people causing problems on the corner are not all Harvest House clients.\n“We do monitor the area on a continual basis, ask people to move along,” said Baker.\n“It's not that we come around from time to time, it's part of our regular routine throughout the day, throughout the evenings. We monitor not only our own property, but the property of the people around us.”\nLeBlanc is happy Harvest House is cooperating and he’s sympathetic toward the plight of Moncton’s homeless, but said he needs to make sure his tenants feel safe.\nHe reached out to the city around three weeks ago with his concerns and said he was put in touch with a member of the Codiac Regional RCMP.\nCity of Moncton spokesperson Isabelle LeBlanc said they cannot discuss active by-law enforcement files, but drug use or other illegal activity should be directed to the police for appropriate handling.\n“Residents should feel safe on their property,” said Isabelle LeBlanc in an email to CTV News.\nSgt. Sébastien Decaens of the Codiac Regional RCMP said if a tenant witnesses any criminal act they should immediately call police, because if they reach out to a landlord first it may be too late.\n“The issue that we have sometimes is the tenants are not calling. So we don’t have a witness to the offence. When we get called it’s later and they’re gone,” said Decaens.\nDonnelly said overdoses on or near the property are commonplace.\n“The sirens... police, ambulance, fire trucks are constant. All day. All night. There is no stop,” said Donnelly.\nPeter LeBlanc said he’d like to see the neighbourhood cleaned up. He’d also like to see a new tenant move in.\nFor more New Brunswick news visit our\ndedicated provincial page.\nShopping Trends\nThe Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

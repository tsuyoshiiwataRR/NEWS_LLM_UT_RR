    "text": "MONCKS CORNER â€” A 20-year-old man has been arrested in connection with a Dec. 20 double homicide in a Berkeley County mobile home park. Isaiah Bennett of North Charleston was arrested Dec. 28 by Berkeley County Sheriff's officers and charged with two counts of murder. Bennett was booked into the Hill-Finklea Detention Center, according to a news release from the sheriff's office. He has [no felony convictions](https://www.postandcourier.com/tncms/asset/editorial/5b0abd90-a318-11ee-8f96-839ddd2cddb4/) locally, according to court records in Berkeley, Charleston and Dorchester counties. On Dec. 20, officers were called to the Summer Creek Mobile Home Park on College Park Road on a call about gunshots and a person lying in the roadway. Officers found 21-year-old Ismael Rodriguez and [15-year-old](https://www.postandcourier.com/tncms/asset/editorial/9e4fc642-797c-11ee-98b2-c335a34b2da2/) Jose Nieto shot to death. Since the shooting deaths, sheriff's officers worked on the case through the Christmas holiday, Berkeley County Sheriff Duane Lewis said in the Dec. 28 news release. \"We are thankful to the community for the assistance and tips that helped bring this case to a closure,\" the sheriff noted. Officers are continuing to investigate the case and ask anyone with additional information to contact the sheriff's office at 843-719-4465 or [sheriff.berkeleycountysc.gov/apply/give-us-a-tip](http://sheriff.berkeleycountysc.gov/apply/give-us-a-tip).",

    "text": "The [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/) know one thing about their quarterbacks going into the offseason: change is needed. Whether the change is small, like finding a new rookie on Day 3 in the draft, or large, like trading for Russell Wilson, things will inevitably look different in 2024. [Spotrac’s Michael Ginnitti](https://www.spotrac.com/news/predicting-quarterback-resolutions-for-2024-2104/) suggested a solution for all quarterback rooms for the 2024 season, including the Steelers. Kenny Pickett carries a fully guaranteed 2 years, $4.6M, and should regain his starting gig next Spring. 2024 will be a pivotal year for the future of Pickett in Pitt. Mitchell Trubisky holds a non-guaranteed 2 years, $11.25M (incredibly). THE STEELERS RELEASE TRUBISKY BEFORE HIS $1M ROSTER BONUS IS DUE NEXT MARCH, RE-SIGNING MASON RUDOLPH TO A 1 YEAR, $2.5M CONTRACT TO BACKUP PICKETT. If Pickett and Rudolph were to return, it will likely give the Steelers reason to select a quarterback late in the draft this spring or sign an undrafted player. As we’ve learned this season, there is no such thing as too much quarterback depth, and the Steelers need to find some new blood to shake things up for next season.",

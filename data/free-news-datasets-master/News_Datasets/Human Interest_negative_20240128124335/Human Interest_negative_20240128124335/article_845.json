    "text": "NOTRE DAME — After weeks of controversy, St. Mary’s College last week reversed a new policy to consider transgender students for admission at the historically all-female Catholic university. The South Bend college’s non-discrimination policy was updated in June to say it would consider undergraduate applicants whose “sex is female or who consistently live and identify as women.” That change made national headlines in November after an email from President Katie Conboy informing faculty, staff and students of the policy change was made public. Days later, Indiana Bishop Kevin Rhoades, whose diocese includes South Bend, urged St. Mary’s board of trustees to “reject ideologies of gender that contradict the authoritative teachings of the Catholic Church” and “to correct its admissions policy.” The board obliged on Dec. 21. In a letter addressed to the Saint Mary’s College community, Conboy and the board president wrote that it had become “increasingly clear … that the position we took is not shared by all members of our community.” “Some worried that this was much more than a policy decision: they felt it was a dilution of our mission or even a threat to our Catholic identity,” the letter reads. “As this last month unfolded, we lost people’s trust and unintentionally created division where we had hoped for unity. For this, we are deeply sorry.” Opponents of the former policy praised the college’s change of course, arguing that allowing men who identify as women into an all-female school goes against Catholic teaching. “The desire of Saint Mary’s College to show hospitality to people who identify as transgender is not the problem,” wrote Bishop Rhoades in an open letter. “The problem is a Catholic woman’s college embracing a definition of woman that is not Catholic.” Those in favor of the former policy say the reversal marks a dangerous precedent for transgender students, who already face real discrimination inside the church, argued Marianne Duddy-Burke, executive director of DignityUSA, a Catholic LGBTQ advocacy group. “The board at St. Mary's essentially caved under pressure,” she said. “It just shows how much transgender people are being targeted and scapegoated in our society and in our church. It’s disappointing that the board did not stick with its conviction that this was the right thing to do.” Most Catholics believe there are only two genders. A poll by the Public Religion Research Institute this year found 69% of white Catholics and 66% of Hispanic Catholics hold that view. In response to the controversy, St. Mary’s will introduce a series of listening sessions to “explore what it means to embrace our values as a Catholic women’s college.” “We will continue to work toward understanding how a college like ours can become a true home, a place of open doors and open arms, where everyone, with all their differences intact, belongs,” Conboy wrote in the letter. The policy reversal came just days after Pope Francis formally approved letting Catholic priests bless same-sex couples, marking a radical shift in policy that aims at making the church more inclusive while maintaining its strict ban on gay marriage. Duddy-Burke with DignityUSA said it all shows how the church is grappling with how to handle LGBTQ issues. “My sense is that dealing with gender identity is really new for Catholic institutions,” she said. “Unfortunately, groups that try and get on to what will be the right side of history on this are paying the price.”",

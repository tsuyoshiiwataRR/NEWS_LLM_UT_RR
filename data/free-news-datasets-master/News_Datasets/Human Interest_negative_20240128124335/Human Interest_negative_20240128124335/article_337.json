The thing was, exactly what we expected from him, he said ‘I’m not going to give in, I’m just going to fight it all the way’.\n‘And he said, ‘If I pass away too soon, I’m going to see even less matches where Queensland beat New South Wales’.’\nBrisbane Broncos coach Kevin Walters, former teammate Ben Ikin, and ARLC Chairman Peter V’landys also paid heartfelt tributes to Webb.\nWalters remarked on the respect and admiration Webb commanded, while Ikin marveled at the grace with which Webb handled the debilitating effects of MND.\nTributes have been flowing in for the much-loved NRL enforcer who died way too soon\nARLC Chairman Peter V’landys spoke about Webb’s bravery throughout his battle with MND\nV’landys extended condolences to Webb’s family, acknowledging his fearsome presence on the field and unparalleled toughness.\n‘Anyone who has come across Carl’s battle will have been touched by his bravery,’ the ARLC chairman said.\n‘He was a fearsome player and competitor and one of the toughest forwards to play in his era. He had a physical presence and aggression which was unmatched.\n‘He showed every bit of that toughness following his diagnosis with Motor Neurone Disease.’\nWebb’s remarkable 11-year playing career included stints with the Brisbane Broncos, Parramatta Eels, and North Queensland Cowboys.\nHe briefly ventured into boxing, sharing a fight night card with Anthony Mundine in 2010. Despite the adversities he faced, Webb’s enduring legacy lives on through the Carl Webb Foundation, established to aid those suffering from MND.",

    "text": "O fficials in an Illinois county put up signs along exits on Interstate 55 telling migrant buses they were not welcome in the area over the holiday weekend. The move comes as more Chicago suburbs take strides to prevent the city's influx of immigrants from overflowing into their towns.\nGrundy County, which recently passed a resolution declaring it a “non- sanctuary county for immigration,” placed two digital signs along I-55's northbound exits by Dwight and Gardner that read \"NO MIGRANT BUSES THIS EXIT\" on Saturday. The signs went up in response to reports of buses dropping off asylum-seekers in other nearby communities, Grundy County Sheriff Ken Briley said to the .\nHOUSE PREPARES FOR EARLY 2024 SHAKE-UP WITH SLEW OF SPECIAL ELECTIONS\n“We wanted to get us through the holiday weekend so we didn’t run into the unfortunate circumstances of having these people dropped in rural Grundy County with no place to go,” Briley said.\nThe sheriff said no buses stopped in the county, the signs have been removed, and there are no plans to put them back up. He said an emergency plan was in place to take migrants to Joliet if any ended up in Grundy County. Joliet police and Will County emergency management would coordinate to direct migrants to trains bound for Chicago.\n“If someone got lost or thought by mistake that this was Chicago, those signs were a directory,” Grundy County State’s Attorney Russell Baker said. “We thought the signs could persuade bus drivers, if lost, to keep going on I-55 to places that are equipped to handle [migrants].”\nKankakee officials reported that four days before Christmas, a bus dropped off 30 to 40 migrants at a gas station around 4:30 a.m. Three hours later, police showed up to find people wrapped in blankets, with some staying at the gas station while others were spotted walking on the highway.\n“The passengers, hailing from Venezuela, were left without money, food, adequate clothing, and were under the impression that they had reached their destination,” the Kankakee County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement .\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nThis is the latest event involving immigrants filtering into Chicago suburbs. Naperville, Aurora, Fox River Grove, Elmhurst, and Cicero are among the towns and villages that have witnessed busloads of migrants arriving in recent weeks. Several of the suburbs are rejecting the buses, threatening to fine or impound them if they drop off homeless immigrants. Villages of Schaumburg and Elk Grove Village have passed ordinances preventing illegal immigrants from being housed in hotels, and Oak Park is now evicting 150 immigrants living in the town's hotel and YMCA.\nGrundy County passed its \"non-sanctuary\" status resolution two weeks ago, rededicating its \"limited resources\" to residents in need, such as seniors, veterans, homeless people, and those living below the poverty line.\nLatest New Hampshire 9-year-old calls Nikki Haley 'the new John Kerry' to her face By: Jenny Goldsberry\nRecent backlash against Nikki Haley proves 'momentum': Tiana Lowe Doescher By: Jenny Goldsberry\nChris Christie's conceit By: Varad Mehta Videos\nTrump campaign slams Biden on US-Mexico border in ad: 'The world burns'\nLouisiana joins list of states considering disqualifying Trump from primary ballot\nBiden chides Trump over Christmas Day 'rot in hell' wish\nJudge upholds redrawn Georgia congressional map in win for Republicans Newsletters\nSign up now to get the Washington Examiner’s breaking news and timely commentary delivered right to your inbox.",

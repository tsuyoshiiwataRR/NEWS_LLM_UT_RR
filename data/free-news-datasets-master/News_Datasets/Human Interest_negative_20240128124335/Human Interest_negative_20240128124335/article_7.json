    "text": "Streaming Now The decade's most triggering comedy Bobbie Jean Carter, 41, was discovered [dead](https://www.dailywire.com/topic/death) in the bathroom of her Florida home over the weekend. The sister of Nick and [Aaron Carter](https://www.dailywire.com/topic/celebrities) was found on Saturday, but new details are emerging regarding the manner of her death. The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office told [TMZ](https://www.tmz.com/2023/12/27/nick-aaron-carter-sister-bobbie-jean-carter-found-unresponsive-bathroom-dead-dies/) that first responders were dispatched to Bobbie’s Tampa residence on Saturday morning. “On December 23, 2023, Hillsborough County Fire rescue crews arrived at the home located… in Tampa, and they discovered a woman who later was identified as Bobbie Jean Carter,” a statement from the sheriff’s office said, per [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/bobbie-jean-carter-nick-aaron-carters-sister-dead-bathroom). “She was immediately transported to St. Joseph’s Hospital in Tampa, where she was declared dead by hospital medical staff at 8:02 a.m.” The outlet noted that Carter was on probation for [cocaine possession](https://www.dailywire.com/topic/drugs), but her roommate insisted that “she had not used any narcotics since her release from prison.” “No narcotics or personal paraphernalia were located in Ms. Carter’s room or bathroom. Deputies observed no signs of foul play,” the document stated. Deputies stayed with Carter’s 8-year-old daughter until relatives arrived, the outlet said. Bobbie Jean’s death is very similar to that of her brother, Aaron Carter, who was found dead in his bathtub in November 2022. The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner confirmed in April that the 34-year-old singer died from drowning after taking pills and huffing spray paint, as The Daily Wire previously [reported](https://www.dailywire.com/news/medical-examiners-release-official-cause-of-death-for-singer-aaron-carter). The report noted that Aaron’s cause of death was “due to the effects of difluoroethane (aerosol propellant found in spray cans) and alprazolam (commonly referred to as Xanax).” [CLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP](https://onelink.to/dwapp) Aaron’s mother Jane Schneck blamed authorities for not investigating Carter’s death as a potential crime. She tried to raise public interest by publishing [graphic images](https://www.dailywire.com/news/aaron-carters-mom-releases-graphic-photos-of-his-death-scene-in-plea-for-police-assistance-we-want-answers) of her son’s death scene on her Facebook page, insisting that foul play was likely. “Aaron had a lot of death threats and many, many people who were making his life miserable,” the singer’s mother said at the time. Both Bobbie Jean and Aaron were siblings to Backstreet Boys singer Nick Carter. Their sister, Leslie Carter, [died in 2012](https://people.com/celebrity/leslie-carter-aaron-carters-sister-was-depressed-on-drugs/) at the age of 25 after going to sleep following a fall in the shower. Her death was also found to be drug related following years of substance abuse issues and depression, per People.",

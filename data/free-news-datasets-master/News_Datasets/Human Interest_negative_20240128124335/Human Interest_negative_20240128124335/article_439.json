    "text": "(WLUK) -- The owner of Minocqua Brewing Company filed a complaint to ban former President Donald Trump from being on Wisconsin's 2024 primary ballot. Kirk Bangstad, of Madison, [filed the complaint with the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC)](https://mailchi.mp/minocquabrewingcompany.com/6om0lhhnph-7909438?e=19c38d3cdd) Thursday. Similar efforts have been made in other states, including Colorado, [Maine](https://fox11online.com/news/nation-world/maine-group-attempts-keep-former-president-donald-trump-off-primary-ballot-secretary-state-constitution-capitol-insurrection#), Michigan and Virginia, which cite section 3 in the 14th Amendment disqualifies Trump from becoming president again. The clause says candidates can be disqualified from holding office if they “engaged in insurrection or rebellion.\" [Colorado’s Supreme Court ruled the ](https://fox11online.com/news/nation-world/former-president-donald-trump-cannot-appear-on-colorados-ballot-for-2024-election-ineligible-for-the-white-house-constitutions-insurrection-clause#)former president's role on January 6th and efforts to overturn the election, amount to insurrection and essentially make him ineligible. Meanwhile, [Michigan's Supreme Court](https://fox11online.com/news/nation-world/michigan-supreme-court-rules-to-keep-donald-trump-on-2024-primary-ballot-republican-insurrectionist-ban-us-constitution-14th-amendment-january-6-capitol-riot#) rejected the attempt to remove him. The complaint filed by Bangstad, reads: Despite the President being the highest-ranking government official in the United States and arguably the most important head of state in the world, there are only four Constitutional requirements that a candidate must meet to serve as President of the United States of America. They must be a natural born citizen, have lived in the United States for at least 14 years, be over the age of 35 and have never engaged in an insurrection after having previously taken an oath of office. Donald J. Trump fails to meet those requirements and may not serve as President of the United States of America The filing with the WEC is the first step in a process to bar former President Trump from the Wisconsin ballot. It is anticipated that the matter will end up in state court, but has to first go through the WEC process.",

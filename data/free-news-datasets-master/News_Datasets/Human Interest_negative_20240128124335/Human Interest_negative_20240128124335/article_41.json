Ms Seed is pictured with fiancé, Chris Smith\nREAL Estate Agents Group principal Ally Comley took to Facebook on Sunday, paying tribute to her employees and calling for support for mental health care workers.\n‘We must honour dear Julie’s life and ensure this tragedy is the turning point to fast-track an immediate overhaul of the SA Mental Health System that has utterly failed so many,’ Ms Comley wrote.\n‘There is no person at fault here.\n‘We cannot blame the unfortunate medical staff who released [Dunk] – these too are real people who I’m sure must also be badly affected right now. I feel for them.\n‘They are duty-bound to follow processes. The blame lies entirely in the inadequacies of the broken system they work within, not them personally.’\nMs Comley described Ms Seed and Ms Scardigno as like ‘sisters’ to their colleagues at the agency and ‘an integral part of our REAL family who we love wholly’.\n‘Julie’s family are suffering incredibly with the pain of their loss and we feel deeply for them,’ Ms Comley wrote.\n‘Sue was severely injured but pulled through due to her inner strength and the hand of God.\nTeam leader Susan Scardigno, 50, was critically injured in the alleged attack by Sean Michaels Dunk and is recovering at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. A friend of Ms Scardigno (above) said she sustained her injuries while trying to protect her colleague\n‘She is an inspirational woman and is already making a remarkable recovery due to her tenacity.\n‘But her emotional healing I’m sure, will be lengthy. We will stand by all of them in every way possible.’\nREAL Estate Agents Group principal Ally Comley (above) paid tribute to Ms Seed and Ms Scardigno on Facebook\nA friend of Ms Scardigno previously told Daily Mail Australia she had sustained her injuries while trying to protect Ms Seed.\nMs Comley thanked those who had come to her employees’ aid including paramedics and police officers.\n‘We are completely indebted to our co-tenants in the building for their brave and timely intervention,’ she wrote. ‘Without question they saved Sue’s life.’\nMs Comley said Ms Seed’s death and Ms Scardigno’s injuries had deeply affected their colleagues’ families, friends and clients.\n‘Such tragedies never just stay within a few,’ she wrote. ‘They have a ripple effect and in this case, the emotional damage to many families is immense.\n‘We have been overwhelmed and humbled by messages of support from our clients, landlords, tenants, and our neighbouring businesses – your kindness and beautiful messages have touched us.’\nDunk spent the night of December 19 in the care of the Urgent Mental Health Care Centre on Grenfell Street in Adelaide’s central business district before being let out two hours before the alleged attack.\nShaun Michaels Dunk, 30, (left) has been accused of storming into the REAL Estate Agents Group in Plympton, Adelaide, on December 20 and attacking workers with a knife and hammer\nHe had been detained under the Mental Health Act on December 5 after showing up to a police station claiming that he was experiencing hallucinations of people threatening to kill him, according to The Advertiser.\nSA Health has launched a review into their processes and the state’s chief psychiatrist will be reviewing the circumstances around Dunk’s treatment and discharge.\nDunk appeared via video link before the Adelaide Magistrates Court on December 21.\nHe did not apply for bail and will remain in custody until March when he is due to to face the court again.\nA friend of Ms Seed’s fiancé, Chris Smith, launched a GoFundMe campaign to help her family cover flights from the United Kingdom and other funeral costs.\nMs Seed has two daughters aged 12 and 18, and got engaged to Mr Smith a year ago.",

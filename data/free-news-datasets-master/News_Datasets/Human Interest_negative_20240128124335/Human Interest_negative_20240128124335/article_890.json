    "text": "Police in York Region say media coverage, along with a tip from a member of the public, helped them apprehend a suspect wanted in connection with an axe attack in Richmond Hill as well as several other criminal offences.\nThe assault happened on Dec. 13 at about 7 p.m. at a residence on Highland Park Boulevard.\nPolice say that the suspect got into an altercation with another man and assaulted him with an axe.\nThe victim was able to fend off his attacker and contact authorities, they said.\nInvestigators said that the suspect was also wanted for a robbery at a commercial business in Richmond Hill on Nov. 23 during which a hammer was used.\nDespite their efforts to find him, the suspect remained at-large.\nAn arrest warrant was subsequently issued for Alexander Gordon Dykes, 59, of no fixed address.\nOn Dec. 20, York Regional Police Service (YRPS) sent out a media release regarding this wanted man.\nSix days later, on Dec. 26, a member of the public saw the suspect in the area of Major Mackenzie Drive East and Old Markham Road. The citizen recognized him from recent media coverage and contacted authorities.\nOfficers promptly responded and took Dykes into custody.\nHe has been charged with one count each of aggravated assault, assault with a weapon, break and enter with intent, robbery, and four counts of breach of probation.\nThe accused was held for a bail hearing.\nPolice are thanking the media and the public for their assistance with this investigation.\nAnyone with information is asked to contact YRPSâ€™s #2 District Criminal Investigations Bureau at 1-866-876-5423, ext. 7241, or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477) or going online at www.1800222tips.com.\nWith files from CTV News Toronto's Alex Arsenych.\nRelated Stories Man allegedly tried to attack someone with axe in Oshawa Brampton axe attack: Image of suspect vehicle released as police make renewed appeal for tips Man charged with attempted murder after alleged axe attack 7 injured in axe attack at German station; 1 arrest Three have life-threatening wounds after Sweden axe attack Grief wracks parents after Brazilian axe attack kills 4 kids Police search for man wanted in Richmond Hill axe attack Photos Police in York Region are searching for a suspect who allegedly attacked a person with an axe in Richmond Hill last Wednesday.

    "text": "Section Branding\nHeader Content\nActors, musicians, writers and artists we lost in 2023\nPrimary Content\nThe worlds of art, music, literature, film and more lost some of their most notable giants and geniuses in 2023. Here are just a few of the actors, writers, producers, artists and musicians who died in the past year, listed chronologically below by the dates of their deaths.\nFree-spirited icon of American rock David Crosby\nCrosby was a prominent figure of the 1970s Laurel Canyon scene who helped bring folk-rock mainstream with both\n The Byrds and Crosby, Stills & Nash. He developed a harmony-rich vocal approach and kaleidoscopic sound, which incorporated psychedelic rock, jazz and twangy folk. As a songwriter, Crosby's canon included the stormy classic \"Eight Miles High\" and \"Almost Cut My Hair\" from the hit album Déjà Vu. He died Jan. 18 at age 81. Read Annie Zaleski and Eric Westervelt's remembrance.\nBurt Bacharach, who composed an astonishing number of hits\nThe visionary pop composer wrote music that sounded simple. But there was nothing simple about the songs now seared in the memories of generations of listeners. They include \"I Say a Little Prayer,\" \"Walk on By,\" \"What the World Needs Now\" and \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head.\" He died on Feb. 8 at age 94.\nRead Elizabeth Blair's remembrance.\nSage of the saxophone and visionary jazz composer Wayne Shorter\nThe 12-time Grammy-winning saxophonist and composer created some of the most singular sounds in contemporary jazz over more than half a century. From the hard bop of the late 1950s to genre-defying small-group jazz in the '60s all the way through the birth of rock-influenced jazz in the '70s, Shorter's soprano and tenor saxophones offered sonic clarion calls for change and innovation. He died on March 2 at age 89.\nRead Felix Contreras' remembrance.\nRyuichi Sakamoto, trailblazing godfather of electronic pop\nThe Japanese composer was one of the first musicians to bring electronic production into popular songcraft though his band Yellow Magic Orchestra. As a solo artist, he collaborated with the likes of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. Sakamoto also scored such movies as Pedro Almodóvar's High Heels and Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor, which earned him an Oscar, a Golden Globe and a Grammy. He died March 28 at age 71.\nRead Anastasia Tsioulcas' remembrance.\nRaghavan Iyer, an icon of accessible Indian cooking in the U.S.\nThe chef and author did much to popularize Indian cooking in non-South Asian kitchens through an approachable series of books that encouraged straying from traditional preparations. He also created a line of frozen dinners sold at Target. Iyer's final book, On the Curry Trail, was published just a few months before his death. He died March 31 at age 61.\nListen back to Iyer's 2023 interview with Ari Shapiro.\nDesigner Mary Quant, who styled London's Swinging '60s\nOne of the most influential designers of her era, Dame Mary Quant is credited with spreading the gospel of hot pants, miniskirts, colorful tights, waterproof mascara, baby wale corduroy, dresses with pockets, shiny PVC raincoats and Vidal Sassoon bobs. While only in her 20s, Quant opened a shop on Kings Road that evolved into a global fashion brand. She died April 13 at age 93.\nRead Neda Ulaby's remembrance.\nAhmad Jamal, who helped define American jazz for nearly a century\nOver eight decades of performance, jazz pianist Ahmad Jamal influenced everyone from Miles Davis to MacArthur Award-winning pianist Jason Moran.

He died April 16 at age 92.\nRead Martin Johnson's remembrance.\nHarry Belafonte: singer, actor, activist and an EGOT for the ages\nEasily one of the 20th century's most charismatic performers, Belafonte won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony award. In the 1950s, he set off a craze for calypso music with his chart-topping recording of \"Day-O\" (also known as \"The Banana Boat Song\"). Among other achievements, Belafonte helped organize the 1963 Freedom March on Washington. He died April 25 at age 96.\nhttps://www.npr.org/2023/04/25/516446742/harry-belafonte-dead.\nIncomparable soul and rock powerhouse Tina Turner\nAn eight-time Grammy winner, Turner was known for her octave-defying voice and mesmerizing stage moves. In a recording career that spanned six decades, she found fame both as a solo artist and in a duo with her first husband, Ike Turner. Her story of surviving his abuse became the basis of the 1993 biopic What's Love Got to Do with It. She died May 24 at age 83.\nRead Annie Zaleski's remembrance.\nNPR correspondent Wade Goodwyn, known for keen storytelling\nThe Texas-based radio journalist reported on his home state for the better part of three decades.

He died July 31 at age 69.\nHear A Martínez's remembrance.\nTrop rock king Jimmy Buffett, who lived life like one of his songs\nEven though \"Margaritaville\" was his only top 10 hit, Jimmy Buffett sold out venues for decades.

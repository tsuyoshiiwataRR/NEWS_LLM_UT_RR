    "text": "Paris Hilton clapped back at mommy-shamers criticizing her for letting her one-year-old son toddle around a yacht sans floatation device.\nParis and her husband, Carter Reum , were enjoying their luxury catamaran vacation when she shared some photos on social media. The Paris in Love star captioned the photos, “Watching Phoenix explore the world has been so special to me! I am so grateful to be a #SlivingMom.”\nNaturally, fans were quick to fill the comments section with unsolicited, but probably necessary advice.\nPhoenix explores the world @parishilton Watching Phoenix explore the world has been so special to me! ?✨ I am so grateful to be a #SlivingMom ?✨\n♬ original sound – jacquelinethoma While many fans gushed over how cute her baby was and offered messages of support, there were “concerned netizens” who scolded her about his lack of a life jacket.\n“Momma, please have him wear a life jacket always on a boat!! Stuff happens. That’s why they’re called accidents. With love,” posted one follower.\n“Please from one mom to another.. life jacket!” another commented, while another added, “My anxiety not seeing him in a life jacket! Can never be too safe on the water!”\nParis, who also shares nine-month-old daughter London with Carter, calmly explained to concerned commenters that it was a big boat and her son was nowhere near any danger. Except being on a vessel in the middle of open water.\nI’ll admit, while watching the video, my heart nearly stopped when little Phoenix seemed to be walking off the boat into the sea. Even though he was just stepping onto the trampoline-like netting meant for passenger lounging, it startled me. Not my circus, not my clowns.\nParis’ babies are her “world”\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Paris Hilton (@parishilton)\n“Hey Mamma’s [sic], thank you for the advice & always caring about my #CutesieCrew,” Paris responded. “It’s a big boat & my husband and I are following him around everywhere & watching like hawks. My babies are my world.”\nOther fans followed her lead and agreed that little Phoenix was safe.\n“Guys this boat is way bigger than it seems in this video. A life jacket would be silly, and worst case scenario, they taught him to swim,” a social media user wrote.\nOkay, but swimming at sea is much different than swimming in a pool. It’s usually much colder, and there are currents. No comparison. On Below Deck Mediterranean Season 8, Roy Orbison Jr. and his family were charter guests on the Mustique superyacht. Captain Sandy Yawn insisted that their three small boys each wore an appropriate-sized life jacket when they were on deck, for their own safety.\n“You do you xx pheonix [sic] is having a ball xx and 100% safe,” another fan added.\nThis isn’t the first time Paris has learned that sharing cute photos of her kids online only invites unsolicited safety concerns and disapproval. In May, she was disparaged for the way she installed her children’s car seats. At that time, she good-naturedly admitted that “no one is perfect.”\nThat same month Kathy Hilton’s elder daughter was again critiqued for posting a pic of her son swimming in a pool with his lifejacket on backward. Apparently, Paris doesn’t ever read the directions, but she was gracious enough to thank her followers for correcting her mistake.\nParis in Love is available on Peacock.\nTELL US – DO YOU THINK IT WAS DANGEROUS FOR CARTER TO TODDLE AROUND WITHOUT A LIFE JACKET? WOULD YOU LET YOUR CHILD DO THAT?",

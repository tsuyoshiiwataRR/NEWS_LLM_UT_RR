But it is worth, firstly, to buy all the appropriate insurance and permits, and secondly, to study how safe the local roads are.\nEuronews\nhas published the data of the research, which named the most dangerous for drivers and their passengers countries of the European Union. The situation was studied by the company Vignette Switzerland, which provides electronic vignettes to pay for highway tolls. Its experts analyzed the latest data of the European Transport Safety Council (ETSC) on deaths on the roads. And named the countries where the situation is the worst.\nThe first place in the not too honorable rating was taken by Bulgaria. In 2023, 79% more road deaths were registered there than the EU average. Bulgaria's highways claimed the lives of 523 people during the year. This is almost 82 people per million inhabitants.\nAt the same time, experts recommend traveling Bulgaria by public transport. The network of bus and rail routes here is quite developed, and ticket prices are affordable compared to many other European countries.\nIn the second position of the list was Romania. In 2023, 1545 people died in traffic accidents here. This is 81 people per million inhabitants. This figure is 78% higher than the average figures for the EU. Here, too, it is more convenient and safer to travel by buses and trains. Especially since Romania has a good railroad connection with Bulgaria and Hungary.\nThe third and fourth ranks are occupied by Serbia and Latvia. In these countries, road deaths are 66% higher than the EU average. Characteristically, these are also countries with well-developed land public transportation of long-distance, including international connections.\nCroatia, one of the most attractive tourist countries in Europe, ranked fifth on the list. The road death rate here is 56% higher than the European average. It is followed by Portugal (32%), Greece (31%) and Lithuania (23%).\nItaly is in ninth position. Last year 3094 people died on the roads here - about 54 traffic fatalities per million inhabitants. Which is 15% more than the EU average. Poland with an indicator of 13% excess closes the top ten.\nWhat to do to avoid getting into an accident while on vacation\nPolice, travel regulators and doctors regularly issue advice on how to behave on the roads to avoid accidents. Especially if you are driving. To do this, you need to do the following:\n- stop and take breaks more often;\n- remember to drink water on hot days;\n- be sure to pay attention to all speed limits and warnings on the road.\nIn some European countries there are also separate rules, which you should ask about before you go there on a road trip. Thus, in most EU countries it is forbidden to transport children in the front seat of the car, and in France, Spain and Switzerland, drivers who wear glasses must carry a second pair.\nSubscribe to the channels OBOZ.UA in\nTelegram and Viber to be aware of the latest events.",

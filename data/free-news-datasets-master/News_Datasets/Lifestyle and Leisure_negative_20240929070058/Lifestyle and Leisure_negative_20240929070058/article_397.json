    "text": "By Dustin Nelson ,\n5 hours ago Women's clothing retailer D.NOLO will close its doors this fall after more than a decade in the North Loop.\nOwner Veronica Clark is moving to New York, she tells the North Loop Neighborhood Association , after a year of traveling back and forth to be with her longtime partner, who moved east for work.\n\"I am overwhelmed by the response I am getting from people,\" Clark said. \"I didn't think it would be as emotional as it is, but I'm feeling very blessed also.\"\nD.NOLO D&periodNOLO&solFacebook\nD.NOLO isn't just a shopping hub in the rapidly changing North Loop, the store helped others get their start. The initial concept was to bring together small businesses with concepts that worked together. Stores like Requisite and Jaxen Grey, each with their own storefront now, started in Clark's store.\nWhile D.NOLO officially closes on Oct. 1, Clark isn't entirely done with Minnesota. She tells the Neighborhood Association that she plans to work with the owner of Excelsior's Clubhouse 366 for a project in 2025. Representatives for D.NOLO did not respond to a request for comment on the project.\nRelated: Kim's closes earlier than planned, workers launch relief fund\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

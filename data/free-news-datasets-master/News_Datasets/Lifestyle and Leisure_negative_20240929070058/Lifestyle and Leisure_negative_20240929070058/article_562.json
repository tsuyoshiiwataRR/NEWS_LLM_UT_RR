    "text": "Key Takeaways A change to Steam status indicated that Hollow Knight: Silksong beta testing is underway. As it turns out, this was an automatic update which is done for thousands of other games. The news came as a shock for fans, who had waited for the title for quite a while. An automatic Steam backend update has caused massive confusion among Hollow Knight: Silksong fans.\nNot only did it change the date of the game's latest update, but it also indicated that Hollow Knight: Silksong was ready for beta testing.\nRelated 10 Amazing Metroidvanias With Standout Mechanics Double Jumps and Grapple Hooks are old hat. Check out these imaginative tweaks on the Metroidvania formula instead!\nAs it turns out, Steam is just playing tricks on us . The platform makes similar changes to the thousands of titles within its library , but these changes don't necessarily reflect the games' current development status.\nIn other words, the latest entry from two days ago wasn't made by Team Cherry.\nThe Endless Wait For Hollow Knight: Silksong\nThe Steam update was first reported on Reddit by user Frequent-Rest-2171.\nAs you can see in the image below, the last update was marked as \"28 August 2024.\" This might indicate that Hollow Knight: Silksong received new, unreported content.\nBelow that, there's a new entry that says \" Hollow Knight: Silksong for Beta Testing ,\" which caused all this confusion.\nThe fans quickly started theorizing this was a huge update before the upcoming beta testing. The post received more than 700 upvotes and thousands of clicks in less than a day, showing the community's hunger for a new entry.\nUnfortunately, it was simply not meant to be. For all intended purposes, the long-awaited metroidvania is still far from finished.\nRelated Peeling Back The Layers Of ULTROS, The Trippiest Metroidvania Ever We speak with Mårten Brüggemann, Game Director behind ULTROS, one of the most unique Metroidvanias in years.\nBased on all reports so far, Hollow Knight: Silksong probably won't be one of the surprise hits of 2024 . In fact, don't be surprised if the title comes out in 2026 or later!\nThe lack of communication from Team Cherry is especially infuriating. Some fans even accuse them of not being dedicated to the project.\nThis is another gut punch for loyal Hollow Knight fans, who are getting closer to a full-scale pitchfork revolution. Hopefully, we'll receive at least some glimmer of hope in the upcoming month.\nRelated Abubakar Salim Explains Why Tales Of Kenzera: Zau Is A Metroidvania Metroidvanias aren't known for narrative focus.\nHollow Knight: Silksong Metroidvania Systems\nOpenCritic Reviews Franchise Hollow Knight Platform(s) PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series S , Xbox Series X , PC , macOS , Linux Developer(s) Team Cherry Publisher(s) Team Cherry Engine Unity ESRB e Expand Video Games hollow knight Your changes have been saved\nEmail is sent\nEmail has already been sent\nclose Please verify your email address.\nSend confirmation email close You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.\nManage Your List Follow Followed Follow with Notifications Follow Unfollow Close",

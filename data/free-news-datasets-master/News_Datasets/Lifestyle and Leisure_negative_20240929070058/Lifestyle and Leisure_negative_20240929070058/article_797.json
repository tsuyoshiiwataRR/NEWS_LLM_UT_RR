The Hollywood couple announced their split [in a joint Instagram post Thursday,](https://www.instagram.com/p/C_Rlu6AS3le/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=95d4dc79-2905-4dbc-b159-f5ec3e340a06) writing they were splitting \"after 28 years together and 21 years of marriage.\" \"This decision came after a lot of thought and care, and as hard as divorce is, we are approaching this with a positive outlook because we know it's what's best for us,\" they wrote. \"We are proud of how we have worked through this together.\" They continued: \"But here's the thing: we’ve been best friends for so many years. We are still celebrating holidays together, watching our favorite tv shows together, and gathering as a family.\" Leah Remini is 'screaming' over Beyoncé [wax figure: 'Will take any and all comparisons'](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/02/09/beyonce-wax-figure-leah-remini-reacts/72536007007/) In the post, the pair called their marriage a \"success\" and said they're \"looking forward to creating even more cherished moments—just in a different way.\" \"We think a marriage that lasted this long and created so many beautiful memories, especially raising our incredible daughter, is something to celebrate,\" they wrote.

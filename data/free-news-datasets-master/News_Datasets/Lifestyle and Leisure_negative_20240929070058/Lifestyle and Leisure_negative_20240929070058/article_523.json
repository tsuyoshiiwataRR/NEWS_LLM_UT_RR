    "text": "Expat Spanish town flooded with complaints as new leisure centre blocks sea view…but their ‘solution’ sparks MORE fury\nTHE council of a coastal Spanish town favoured by expats has been slammed with complaints after a new leisure centre blocked sea views.\nAnd their solution to the controversy has only added fuel to the fire.\nTorrevieja, southeast Spain, is home to a bumper number of Brit and Irish expats attracted to the blue waters and sunshine.\nIt's even been branded \"Costa del\nYorkshire\" in a nod to the amount of sun-seekers who have moved from the historic county.\nBut dreamy sea views hit a snag with the construction of a new sports centre providing an obstacle for locals in a block of flats in La Mata.\nViews of the sunny coast were suddenly replaced by a thick concrete wall, sparking a flurry of furious complaints.\nRead more World News\nIn response, the Torrevieja City Council ticked off an ingenious idea - a giant, 1,000-square-metre painting on the wall illustrating fake views of the beach.\nThe high-tech mural is also equipped with a special chemical promising to remove bad odours, bacteria and air pollution.\nBut locals claimed the mural covered even more of their view than what was originally blocked by the wall.\nTown Hall hit back, saying anyone who lives behind the site knew about plans to build the sports centre before buying their properties.\nMost read in The Sun\nThe local authority added it had no choice but to build there given they owned the slice of land.\nIn a positive development, residents can now head to the leisure centre for\nstaple Spanish dish paella - served in a giant Yorkshire pudding. The council last year revealed it designated more than £4.2m to the sport complex, saying it was being \"highly demanded by the people of Mata\".\nIndoor football, volleyball, handball, basketball and badminton had all been earmarked for the centre, as well as space to host cultural and social events.\nA\nlocal Spanish news site quoted mayor Eduardo Dolon claiming the council had been \" in contact with these neighbours\" from \"the first day\".\nAppearing to take a flippant tone, he also joked: \"They (the residents) are happy because they have sports facilities just a stone's throw away and many of them are athletes.\"\nAccording to the local council, Torrevieja recently reached a population of 100,000.\nNearly 5,000 of those are Brits, according to the authority.\nThe town, just southwest of Alicante, is also enjoyed by Ukrainians (more than 7,000) and Russians (almost 6,000).\nThe population is split 50/50 between Spanish-born and expat residents, according to data.\nRead More on The US Sun\nPrice comparison site 'Which?' says it is the cheapest coastal town in Spain, with an average room priced at £77 per night.\nIt's just a 40-minute drive from Alicante airport.",

    "text": "By WILLIAM J. WRIGHT Fifty years into the future, New York City is a dystopian hellscape, ravaged by crime, storms, residual radiation from a devastating terrorist attack and genetic mutations in WARM FUSION, the upcoming sci-fi horror limited comic series from writer Scott Hoffman (Nostalgia, Wag, member of pop icons Scissor Sisters) and artist Alberto Ponticelli (Frankenstein: Agent of S.H.A.D.E., Orc Island). Debuting this November from creator-owned publisher DSTLRY, WARM FUSION promises to plunge readers into a nightmarish vision in which “biotech corporations unleash atrocities to rival the serial killers stalking the night.” From DSTLRY’s synopsis: After a series of murders rip through the city’s brothels, an escort named Vin Young, who cosplays as the Brothers Grimm’s Snow White – and is one of the generation of deformed victims – pursues the killer (or killers), reluctantly joining forces with Jarrod Hannover, the lone cop assigned to the case. The two eventually arrive at a biotech megacorp developing a cellular metal called Warm Fusion, a pioneering technology meant to replace prosthetics limbs, and soon confront the sociopathic scientist Nicholas Fleischer, his monstrous alter-ego, Mr. Barnaby; and the hideous monster that he’s been secretly developing. “Warm Fusion is a deep dive into the grotesque possibilities of biotechnology and its impact on humanity,” says writer Scott Hoffman. “Alberto Ponticelli’s art is transportive, blurring the lines between flesh, machine, and everyone caught in the gutters between. This is an evolution of the body horror classics I watched growing up, and perfect for a time when humanity is obsessed with (and achieving) provocative new levels of post-humanism.” “Working on Warm Fusion has been an exhilarating experience,” adds artist Alberto Ponticelli. “The world Scott and I have incubated straddles horror and hope, and imagining the extremes humanity will warp itself into in the coming decades has been perverse and delightful.” DSTLRY was kind enough to share some concept art for WARM FUSION exclusively with RUE MORGUE.

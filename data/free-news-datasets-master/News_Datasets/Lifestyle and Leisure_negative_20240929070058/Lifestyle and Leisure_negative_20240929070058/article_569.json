    "text": "In a harrowing turn of events, what was meant to be a team-building exercise turned into a life-threatening ordeal for one unfortunate employee. A man was left stranded on a treacherous mountain slope after a corporate retreat went disastrously awry, leading to a nail-biting rescue operation.\nThe incident unfolded when a group from tech startup InnovateCorp embarked on what was supposed to be an exhilarating hiking expedition. However, as the team descended, they failed to notice that one of their colleagues, 32-year-old software engineer Mark Thompson , had fallen behind and become separated from the group.\nIt wasn’t until hours later, as dusk settled over the craggy peaks, that the alarm was raised. Local mountain rescue teams were immediately mobilized, facing a race against time and the elements to locate and retrieve the stranded employee.\n“We received the call at 8:45 PM, and knew we had to act fast,” said Sarah Jenkins, lead coordinator of the Mountain Emergency Response Team (MERT). “With temperatures dropping and limited visibility, every minute counted.”\nThe rescue operation was nothing short of heroic. MERT deployed helicopters equipped with thermal imaging technology to scan the rugged terrain, while ground teams navigated treacherous paths with search dogs. After a tense five-hour search, Thompson was finally located, huddled in a small crevice, cold and dehydrated but alive.\n“It was like finding a needle in a haystack,” recounted John Martinez, one of the rescuers who reached Thompson first. “The relief on his face when we arrived… it’s moments like these that remind us why we do this job.”\nThompson was airlifted to a nearby hospital, where he was treated for mild hypothermia and exhaustion. He is expected to make a full recovery, thanks to the swift and coordinated efforts of the rescue teams.",

    "text": "Deltona is known locally for its stunning trails, beautiful parks and its nearby winery. Did you know it's also known for having the worst Taco Bell in the country? That is according to a recent survey released by Fast Company , a business magazine that looked through Google Maps reviews of every Taco Bell eatery in the United States to determine the most liked — and disliked —locations. The magazine \"ranked the locations based on a weighted scoring system that we devised, which factors in both the average customer review score and the number of reviews that customers have left,\" according to the survey's results, published on Fast Company's website. The company did not return an email request for comment as of Friday afternoon. Deltona Taco Bell location named worst in the country The chain's Deltona restaurant, located at 1519 Saxon Blvd., topped the list of \"worst\" Taco Bell locations, according to the survey, based on 95 reviews (the total number as of July 31). One of these reviews, which Fast Company chose to illustrate the customers' sentiment toward the restaurant, calling it the \"representative review,\" said, \"Not a good first impression considering this place has just opened up.\" \"The food wasn’t great at all to be honest. The burritos looked a mess, had missing ingredients I’m sure, and my supreme chalupa was actually missing tomato and cheese so you know 2/4 ingredients missing. Not bad eh. Even paid a dollar extra for the steak so that’s laughable,\" it continued. \"So yeah. Take a gamble if you wish. I did and it was pants (sic) but eh. You might get good food who knows. Maybe it will improve in time. Fingers crossed as I do like Taco Bell.” Chicken tender wars: How are Zaxby's, Huey Magoo's and Raising Canes different? According to Google Maps, the location has an average score of 1.8 out of five stars based on 105 reviews. A one-star review from a week ago said, \"Been multiple times thinking it’s a new location give them a chance, but this is probably my seventh time being at this location now, and not once have they got my order right.\" Another reviewer grabbed Mexican pizzas at the drive-thru \"for a quick snack,\" but \"we paid dearly for the rest of the evening. Never again.\" But the restaurant still has its fans, with one reviewer writing three weeks ago, \"Never really have a bad experience here. Today, today they killed it. Food was phenomenal. First taco ever that actually looked like the picture. Great job.\" What are the other low-ranking Taco Bells in the U.S.? And the best? As far as the other locations that came close to the chain's overall poor customer reviews, the next four on the list are way up north: - 1810 E. Seymour Ave., Cincinnati, Ohio. - 355 Dix Ave., Queensbury, New York. - 1893 Elmwood Ave., Buffalo, New York. - 7660 Barrington Road, Hanover Park, Illinois. But the survey also identified which Taco Bell stores were the best reviewed in the country, located at: - 5200 CA-1, Pacifica, California. - 925 FM802, Brownsville, Texas. - 402 Dixieland Road, Harlingen, Texas. - 3509 John F. Kennedy Blvd., Union City, New Jersey. - 420 S. 10th St., McAllen, Texas.",

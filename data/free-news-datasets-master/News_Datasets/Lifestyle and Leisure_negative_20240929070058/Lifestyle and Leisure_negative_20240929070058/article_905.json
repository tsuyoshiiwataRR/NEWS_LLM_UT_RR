    "text": "By Jonah Kubicek ,\n1 hour ago The San Antonio Spurs are rebuilding, however slowly, around Victor Wembanyama. Last season, Wemby was their only major addition, and the year was full of experimentation, so the Spurs trudged to a 22-60 record. This season, however, Wembanyama is surrounded by more established talent, and the Spurs should be looking to make the Play-In Tournament.\nAs Wembanyama ascends to superstardom, the clock is ticking in Texas for the Spurs to become contenders in the Western Conference. Even last season, NBA media was spreading rumors that he was \"unhappy\" in San Antonio. While those murmurings were quickly dispelled, expect the likes of ESPN and other media giants to promote rumors that he would do better in a bigger market.\nApr 12, 2024; San Antonio, Texas, USA; San Antonio Spurs forward Victor Wembanyama (1) reacts after official John Goble (10) called a technical foul during the first half against the Denver Nuggets at Frost Bank Center. © Scott Wachter-USA TODAY Sports\nRobert Horry spent five seasons with the Spurs and won two NBA Finals with the Silver and Black, although he has become better known for his outlandish takes. However, he hit the nail on the head in a recent episode of The Big Shot Bob Podcast.\n\"Give it two, three seasons especially if the Spurs aren’t doing anything or Wemby may not be ‘happy’, you going to see his name connected to the Lakers,\" Horry predicted.\nNow, to his credit, Horry did not say that the Los Angeles Lakers' pursuit of Wembanyama is realistic, nor did he say there is any basis for analysts to make the claim, he just said that they would.\nAlmost every superstar gets connected to the Lakers in some way or another. This offseason both Trae Young and Donovan Mitchell had their name mentioned.\n\"We talked about it with Giannis a few years ago,\" explained Horry. \"Now it’s Luka’s turn. At some point of time down the line, hell, it’s going to be Wemby.\"\nRelated: George Karl Compliments San Antonio Fans\nSince trading for Anthony Davis, the Lakers have been unable to add an in-their-prime star next to their duo of Davis and LeBron James. While adding Wembanyama will likely be a goal of theirs, it is wildly unrealistic.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

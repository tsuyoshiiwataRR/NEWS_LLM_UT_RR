    "text": "Gophers offense looks lost in season-opening loss to North Carolina The Gophers football team began its 2024 season with bad news as [star running back Darius Taylor](https://www.si.com/college/minnesota/gophers-football/gophers-running-back-darius-taylor-ruled-out-against-north-carolina-01j6g51y52ct) was ruled out pregame, along with starting safety Darius Green. With costly penalties, two missed field goals and a plethora of mistakes, the Gophers fell to North Carolina 19-17 Thursday night in front of an announced crowd of 50,805 at Huntington Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. Preseason All-American kicker Dragan Kesich missed a 27-yard field goal early and his 47-yarder at the buzzer sailed wide right to give the visiting Tar Heels the nonconference win. Minnesota's [new transfer quarterback](https://www.si.com/college/minnesota/gophers-football/ex-gophers-qb-athan-kaliakmanis-wins-first-career-start-at-rutgers-01j6g9yew1aa) Max Brosmer looked nervous in his first FBS football game. He began the night 3-of-7 passing for 26 yards through his first three drives. Right when it looked like he led the offense down the field for a field goal, Kesich banged a 27-yard attempt off the right upright. North Carolina took advantage and put together a 90-yard touchdown drive, taking a 7-0 lead. Things continued to look like a struggle for Minnesota's offense, but veteran cornerback Justin Walley reeled in an interception midway through the second quarter and put together a highlight return, setting them up in the red zone. [Oklahoma transfer Marcus Major](https://www.si.com/college/minnesota/gophers-football/injuries-force-gophers-to-rely-heavily-on-highly-touted-transfer-portal-class-01j6g75hmnar) found the end zone on a 5-yard carry, and Minnesota evened things at 7-7. Brosmer and the Gophers (0-1) ended the first half with their most successful drive, going 65 yards on nine plays, highlighted by a 20-yard Daniel Jackson reception. Brosmer's quarterback sneak touchdown gave Minnesota a 14-7 lead going into the half. North Carolina dominated the third quarter, holding the ball for over 13 minutes. Despite a costly penalty, Minnesota's defense held firm at the goal line and forced a pair of field goals, narrowing its lead to 14-13. The Tar Heels (1-0) went into the fourth quarter without starting quarterback Max Johnson, who was [carted off with an injury](https://www.si.com/college/minnesota/gophers-football/north-carolina-quarterback-max-johnson-carted-off-in-gophers-game-01j6gk9vn82e), but an early Brosmer fumble set up a third field goal from Noah Burnette to give UNC a 16-14 lead with just over nine minutes to play. Right when it looked like Brosmer and the Gophers offense had nothing left, Le'Meke Brockington hauled in a 22-yard reception only to fumble before a lucky bounce put the ball right into the hands of Major, who carried it for 16 more yards. That set up a 30-yard field goal by Kesich for a 17-16 lead, but UNC answered with another field goal to go ahead 19-17 with under two minutes to go. After a night of bad passes and mistakes, Brosmer and the offense finally moved the ball, going all the way down the field only to have Kesich pull his 47-yard attempt wide right. Brosmer finished 13 of 21 for 166 yards and a fumble. Major had 73 rushing yards on 20 carries, but only two yards in the second half. Jackson led Minnesota receivers with four catches for 55 yards.",

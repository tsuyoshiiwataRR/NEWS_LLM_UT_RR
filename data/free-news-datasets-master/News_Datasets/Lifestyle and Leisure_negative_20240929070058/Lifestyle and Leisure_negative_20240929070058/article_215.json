    "text": "Anfisa Nava, the fiery Russian beauty from 90 Day Fiancé , is no stranger to turning heads. But this time, she’s left fans absolutely gobsmacked with her latest Instagram reveal. Once known for her bold attitude and tumultuous relationship with Jorge Nava, Anfisa has now sparked a wave of disbelief among her followers. Her recent selfie has people asking, \"Is that really Anfisa?\" as she debuts a face so transformed, even the most die-hard fans are doing a double-take .

Why Anfisa’s New Selfie Is Causing Controversy Anfisa Nava first burst onto the scene in 2016 when she joined season four of 90 Day Fiancé with her then-fiancé, Jorge Nava. From the start, she was one of the most memorable personalities on the show, known for her no-nonsense attitude and sky-high expectations. The couple's rollercoaster romance and eventual marriage in 2017 kept viewers hooked, but it was their explosive arguments that truly made them reality TV gold. Fast forward to 2024, and it’s not just her relationship status that’s changed—her entire look has undergone a jaw-dropping transformation. The 28-year-old recently set social media ablaze when she posted a new selfie ( you can see it on IG here ), showcasing a face that fans barely recognized. The comments came pouring in, with some expressing genuine shock. One fan couldn’t hold back, questioning, \"What did she do to her face?? I didn't recognize her!\" Another lamented, \"She doesn't look like Anfisa. What a shame, she was so pretty.\" It’s clear that Anfisa’s latest look has left some of her longtime followers feeling nostalgic for the 90 Day Fiancé star they once knew. But not everyone was ready to criticize. Amidst the disbelief, a few fans came to her defense, showering her with compliments. \"Lovely pictures!!! You look absolutely beautiful,\" one wrote, while another added, \"You're gorgeous and these pics are a vibe.\" It’s a classic case of divided opinions, something Anfisa has been dealing with ever since she first appeared on reality TV. Anfisa Is Open About Her Love For Plastic Surgery Anfisa has never been shy about her love for plastic surgery , openly sharing her experiences with her fans. Her transformation journey is well-documented, starting with a rhinoplasty in Russia to correct a deviated septum. But that was just the beginning. Unsatisfied with the results, she underwent a second nose job in the United States for purely cosmetic reasons. And because the third time’s the charm, Anfisa headed to Turkey in 2022 for yet another rhinoplasty. She praised her experience in Istanbul, saying the doctors were highly experienced, the hospital was top-notch, and the prices were more than reasonable. [Related ](/90-day-fiance-breakups-blindsided-fans/) [ These 90 Day Fiancé Breakups Totally Blindsided Fans ](/90-day-fiance-breakups-blindsided-fans/) The 90 Day Fiancé franchise has showcased plenty of couples falling out of love, but these specific breakups still leave fans shocked. But her nose isn’t the only thing that’s changed. Anfisa has also had a breast augmentation, lip fillers, and regular Botox injections, proving that she’s committed to achieving the look she wants, no matter what it takes. And while some might say she’s gone too far, Anfisa is unapologetic. \"I had rhinoplasty because my nose was something that always bothered me,\" she’s previously shared. She’s all for plastic surgery as long as it’s done for the right reasons and not just to follow trends. Anfisa’s journey from 90 Day Fiancé star to fitness guru and plastic surgery enthusiast has been anything but boring. While some fans might miss the Anfisa they first met on TV, there's no denying that she's carved out a new path entirely on her own terms. Whether you love or loathe her transformation, Anfisa is living proof that she's here to stay—and she'll keep everyone talking while she does.

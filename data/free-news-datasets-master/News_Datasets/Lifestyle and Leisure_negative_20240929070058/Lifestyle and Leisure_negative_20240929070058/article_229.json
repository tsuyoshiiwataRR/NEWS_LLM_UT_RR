    "text": "51m ago\n- last edited\n33m ago\nI've moved homes. I changed my address in the app, and it killed all storage and history. Fine.New home - I set up the hub - it works with google assistant. It connects to the internet. I can change it's name. I can use it via the touch screen. But the video no longer works. If I check it in the Google Home App (up to date), iDeciesAll instructions (including factory reset) say - go into the Google Home App, go to Settings, and remove device.Here's the issue:Google Home -> Devices (Unassigned) -> Display -> \"View Nest Cam\" does not load anything. \"Turn On\" and it's a loading indicator. If I select the GEAR icon - \"Internal error encountered.\" (Retry - which does nothing). Reboot - will reboot the device. But nothing changes.I can't remove the device. I can't reset the device. Is there a step I'm missing?\nETA:\nI went to support and there it showed me how to do a factory reset - so it reset!But the old device was still listed in Home.Oddly enough, despite saying it was \"resetting everything\" it savedâ€¦ everything. But it's working now.That took too much effort to resolve, but hopefully anyone else hitting this issue can find this helpful!\nnever-displayed\nFollow Us\nGoogle Nest Help Center\nChromecast Help Center",

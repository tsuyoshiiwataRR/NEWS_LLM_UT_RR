    "text": "One of the newest additions to Walt Disney World has stopped working, again.\nCredit: Inside the Magic Related: Controversial SeaWorld Releases Three More Animals, Even More Heading back Into the Wild Soon\nGuests visiting EPCOT recently may have noticed new LED lighting systems, which can be seen in the park’s World Celebration area. However, these lighting packages have encountered multiple issues since originally debuting earlier this year, with guests sharing concerning updates regarding the new LED lights on social media.\nEPCOT has undergone perhaps the most significant transformation of any of the four main theme parks at Walt Disney World. First opening in 1982, EPCOT has evolved and changed over the decades, with the last few years being incredibly important for the theme park.\nIn 2022, EPCOT welcomed its very first roller coaster, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind . EPCOT has also welcomed a variety of other rides and attractions in recent years, such as Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure and Journey of Water Inspired by Moana.\nThe park’s layout has also seen upgrades recently, though some projects went smoother than others, with EPCOT’s new lighting system still facing technical issues months later.\nEPCOT’s Lighting System Goes Haywire Credit: Disney Related: ‘Stranger Things’ Drama: Show’s Star Shades Millie Bobby Brown, Feels “Frustrated” and “Hopeless”\nTwitter/X user ShowcaseWishes shared an image of the LED lights failing to work again late Thursday night. These LED lights are planted in the ground in World Celebration, one of EPCOT’s four themed areas.\nthe ground lights at EPCOT are still not working\nthe ground lights at EPCOT are still not working pic.twitter.com/wCvrXL6Pek\n— Showcase of Wishes (@ShowcaseWishes) August 30, 2024\nThese lights were introduced along with World Celebration, which officially opened earlier this year. Unfortunately, World Celebration was not the only area of EPCOT suffering from technical issues, with lights on the park’s main fountain flickering as well.\nThis fountain is placed directly in front of Spaceship Earth, which is also lovingly referred to as the “EPCOT Ball” and is one of the first things guests see as they enter the park.\nTwitter/X user TharinWhite shared a video of the flickering lights late Thursday night.\nThe amount of broken LED lights in the new areas of Epcot is almost funny at this point. Disneyland has a half red and half white bulb to blend in. Epcot has an epileptic’s nightmare in a multi-million dollar park improvement area. Things break, I get it. But this is months at this point.\nThe amount of broken LED lights in the new areas of Epcot is almost funny at this point.\nDisneyland has a half red and half white bulb to blend in.

These issues are even more disappointing, considering the park underwent an extensive refurbishment before they were added, with multiple areas of EPCOT closing to guests over the last five years.\nTechnical issues also persist for Magic Kingdom’s newest addition: Tiana’s Bayou Adventure. This new take on Disney’s legendary log flume adventure Splash Mountain officially opened this summer but has suffered from extensive downtime and technical issues.\nThe ride has failed to open along with the rest of Magic Kingdom for the last several weeks, with guests reporting that various animatronics and other themed elements were not working during their time on Tiana’s Bayou Adventure. The ride has also endured several evacuations .\nFans are hoping these kinks will get worked out with Disneyland’s version of the ride, which is set to open this November.\nWhat’s your favorite ride at Walt Disney World? Have you been to EPCOT recently?",

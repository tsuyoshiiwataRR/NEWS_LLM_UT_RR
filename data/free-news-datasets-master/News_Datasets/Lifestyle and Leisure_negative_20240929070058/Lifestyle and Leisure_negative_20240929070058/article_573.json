    "text": "Columbia favorite faces repeat food storage violations during inspection A Columbia favorite for Chinese food had some issues with food storage, with a couple noted as a repeat violation during a routine inspection Aug. 22. House Of Chow, 2101 W. Broadway, was storing food on the floor of its walk-in cooler and freezer rather that at least six inches off the floor, one of the repeat violations. An inspector also found some raw beef stored in the walk-in cooler on top of a box of cream cheese, the other repeat food storage issue. [Routine inspections happen two to three times per year](https://www.como.gov/health/environmental-health/inspections/) based on priority and location of Columbia restaurants, Columbia/Boone County Public Health and Human Services previously has said. Follow-up inspections happen if a critical violation is found. Restaurants usually can correct noncritical violations by the next routine inspection. Reports are from Aug. 20 through Monday, unless otherwise noted. The inspector noted the proper storage order for raw and ready-to-eat items. From the bottom to the top of shelves, it must go raw chicken; raw hamburger and any pork meat; raw whole muscle beef; seafood, fish and eggs and then ready-to-eat or fully cooked food at the top. Some potentially hazardous ready-to-eat items, including crab rangoons, egg rolls, cooked chicken, cooked noodles and more, were missing date labels. These noted issues needed correction by Tuesday, but a reinspection report was not yet available when this story was submitted for publication. One issue addressed during the inspection Aug. 22 was the concentration of chlorine-based sanitizer in bottles and buckets that were either not strong enough or too strong. Other noncritical issues can be addressed by the December routine inspection. This includes cleaning buildup on dry storage racks, and resurfacing or replacing several cutting boards that are heavily scratched and scored. Lessons on food temperatures A couple restaurants received lessons on food cooling procedures and one received a lesson on hot holding of food. This was either in reaction to an observed violation or just proactive education for future reference. Beans that were improperly cooled at Pancheros Mexican Grill, 421 N. Stadium Blvd. were discarded Aug. 21 during the restaurant's routine inspection. Pico de gallo and lettuce also tested above 41 degrees Fahrenheit and were discarded. Cold food must be stored at 41 degrees or below and hot food must be stored at 135 degrees or above. The restaurant's soda machine ice chute was soiled and needed cleaning by Wednesday, but a report was not yet available. The front door still does not have weather stripping to prevent entry a pests from a previous routine inspection. This needed correction by Wednesday. There was no food manager certificate onsite, a noncritical violation. Management needs food safety training by the November routine inspection. Big Daddy's BBQ and Soul Food, 1802 Paris Road received the proactive lesson on food cooling methods during the Aug. 23 routine inspection. When cooling food, it has to get to below 70 degrees within two hours and below 41 degrees within an additional four hours, per an inspector's notes. A critical issue of a lack of a hand drying method at a hand sink was addressed during the inspection. Management can get a cover for a light bulb in the walk-in cooler by December. Chicken in a crock pot tested at 97 degrees at Myanmar Kitchen, 1301 Vandiver Drive Suite J, during an Aug. 22 routine inspection. The potentially hazardous chicken was discarded and a lesson was provided on using time as a temperature control. Food held outside the safe temperature zones of 41 degrees or below and 135 degrees or above must be discarded after four hours. The restaurant will start to use low or medium settings on the crock pot instead of the warm function and routinely test the food temperature to ensure the proper holding temperature. One other issue addressed during the inspection was adding a label to a chemical spray bottle. Other routine inspections Food products were stored on the floor rather than at least six inches above it at Shiloh Bar and Grill, 402 E. Broadway, on Aug. 20. That issue and ice buildup in a freezer can be addressed by the next routine inspection in December. U Knead Sweets, 808 Cherry St. discarded an adulterated fruit item during its Aug. 21 inspection. Staff also discarded soiled gloves hanging above an in-use food preparation area, along with several food utensils that were in disrepair or broken. A scoop stored in an ice machine was readjusted so the handle was not touching the ice. Food items stored in used sour cream containers also was corrected, since single-use items cannot be reused. A soiled ice machine, soiled soda machine nozzles and a dishwasher needing a service since it is not dispensing enough sanitizer during the cycle all were found Aug. 21 at Rio Grande, 3306 Broadway Business Park. The restaurant had until Tuesday to fix the issues, but a report was not yet available. Los Comales, 3510 Interstate 70 Drive SE, had soiled soda nozzles Aug. 21. The restaurant and grocery store had until Monday to clean them, but a report was not yet available. Another issue needing correction by Monday included uncovered food items at multiple locations in the establishment. Time stamps and logs were added to food items in the walk-in freezer and cooler after a discussion with management. The establishment can clean dust buildup on ceiling vents by the December routine inspection. Cookie dough in a toppings well at Steak 'n Shake, 1912 W. Worley, tested above 41 degrees and was discarded Aug. 22. The topping well either needs a service so it maintains temperatures for the cookie dough. Otherwise, it needs to be stored in the walk-in cooler. Soiled soda nozzles were replaced during the inspection. Ice buildup in the walk-in freezer on food needed defrosting by Tuesday, but a report was not available. Concentration of ammonia-based sanitizer and the dish machine not dispensing enough sanitizer during the cycle were corrected during the inspection. Less than five food handler cards were presented during the inspection and not all managers had a food manager's certificate. This needs correction by December. An employee was storing personal food above establishment food. The employee's food was moved. The restaurant has until December to fix the walk-in freezer floor. Scooters Coffee No. 432, 2101 W. Ash St., had a soiled ice machine which was cleaned the same day as its Aug. 22 inspection. A discussion was held on adding the removable ice machine shield to the weekly cleaning schedule. There also were multiple reach-in coolers that did not have thermometers, which can be in place by the November routine inspection. Management plan to call a plumbing service if a slow-draining hand sink is unable to be corrected by staff through physical or chemical means. Management also will call Culligan to service the water softener after salt buildup was found on the floor in the back room near it. The inspector held a discussion with management on taking a ServSafe or other approved food safety course. A meat thermometer was acquired Aug. 23 during the inspection of Vida Coffee, 812 Hitt St. It is needed to check food temperatures such as when reheating burritos or sandwiches. A discussion also was held about adding a sign regarding discarding cheese danishes by 10:30 a.m. since baking finishes at 6:30 a.m. and washing/rinsing/sanitizing of blenders and utensils by mid-shift at 1 p.m. Midway Restaurant, 6401 W. Highway 40, employees were not changing gloves between tasks, an inspector observed Monday. Education was provided on hand washing and glove changes. Dented cans in a dry storage area were discarded, along with orange juice kept past the manufacturer's date label. Ice buildup in an ice cream freezer can be defrosted by the February routine inspection. Randy's Frozen Custard was not open at the time of an attempted inspection Aug. 26. A couple restaurants had no violations during inspection. This included Cherry Street Cellar, 505 Cherry St. on Aug. 21 and White Castle, 3401 Clark Lane on Aug. 22.

Broadway Suite 236, was cleaned by its Aug. 21 reinspection. The restaurant is now using quarternary ammonia concentration test strips for sanitizers until hydrogen-peroxide sanitizer concentration test strips are approved by a district manager. El Maguey, 901 E. Nifong Blvd., cleaned its soiled ice chest by Aug. 23, after the Aug. 21 routine inspection. Noncritically, the restaurant can address food being stored on the floor of the walk-in cooler and freezer floors rather than at least six inches above by December. The soiled ice machine at First Watch, 421 N. Stadium Blvd., was cleaned Aug. 23 after the Aug. 20 routine inspection. McNally's/Wise Guys Pizza, 7 N. Sixth St., cleaned up a soiled microwave by Aug. 23, after the Aug. 20 routine inspection. The restaurant also addressed uncovered food items at multiple locations in the establishment and a soiled ice machine. Food that was kept past its date mark was discarded Aug. 20. The restaurant has until December to defrost a chest freezer. The menu at Sycamore, 800 E. Broadway, did not the standard consumer advisory regarding consuming of raw or undercooked food during the Aug. 19 routine inspection. It was added to menus by Monday. Other issues found Aug. 19 were noncritical, and can be addressed by December. This included a repeat violation of a lack of food manager's certificate onsite, excessive dust buildup on vents, ice buildup in a minifridge behind the bar and replacement of a torn gasket and rusted shelves in a reach-in cooler under a large food preparation station.

    "text": "29th August 2024 – (Kyushu) Typhoon Shanshan, a severe tropical storm, continued its relentless path across Japan, making landfall near Satsumasendai in Kagoshima on Kyushu island this morning. By the afternoon, it had advanced towards northern Kyushu, causing widespread disruptions.\nEVA Air flight BR106, which departed from Taoyuan Airport in Taiwan at 8.17am, was scheduled to arrive in Fukuoka at 11.42am local time. However, the storm’s severe conditions forced the aircraft to circle multiple times in an attempt to land. The flight ultimately had to return to Taiwan, landing back at Taoyuan Airport at 1.23pm.\nPassengers recounted harrowing moments aboard the aircraft, with many experiencing severe nausea and distress due to the turbulence. “The plane couldn’t land; we circled for about 40 minutes. It was extremely bumpy, many were sick, and children were screaming,” a passenger reported to Taiwanese media. The decision to return to Taiwan was met with applause from the distressed passengers.\nFlight tracking website FlightRadar24 showed the aircraft’s prolonged attempt to land in Fukuoka, but to no avail, leading to its return to Taiwan.\nMeanwhile, Typhoon Shanshan’s impact on Japan has been severe, with record-breaking rainfall across Kyushu. Japanese media reported at least three fatalities and 82 injuries. The casualties were particularly severe in Miyazaki and Kagoshima, with local authorities and NHK consolidating reports of injuries throughout the day.\nThe storm also caused significant infrastructural damage, with numerous homes damaged and power outages affecting over 233,200 households across seven prefectures in Kyushu, according to Kyushu Electric Power Company.\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency and NHK reported that the storm, moving north at about 15 kilometres per hour, was expected to slightly weaken but still bring significant rain and strong winds to the region through this evening and into the next day.",

    "text": "Mariah Carey’s mother Patricia and the singer’s sister Alison died last weekend on the same day, the media reported, citing the singer’s statement. The star did not provide the cause of their deaths.\n“My heart is broken, I lost my mother this past weekend. Unfortunately, in a tragic twist of events, my sister lost her life on the same day,” Mariah Carey wrote in a statement, quoted by People magazine and the BBC. She added that she was glad she was able to spend the last week with her mother before her death. “I appreciate your love, support and respect for my privacy during this impossible time,” we read.\nSEE ALSO: Media: Crazy Town singer Shifty Shellshock is dead. He performed the big hit “Butterfly”\nMariah Carey’s mother and sister died on the same day\nAccording to the media, no details are known about the causes of death of the famous singer’s mother and sister. 87-year-old Patricia, the ex-wife of Alfred Roy Carey, was an opera singer and vocal specialist. As the “People” magazine portal writes, although the star inherited her vocal talent, their relationship was complicated. “Like many aspects of my life, my journey with my mother was full of contradictions and competing realities. It was never just black and white – it was a whole rainbow of emotions” – the portal quotes the singer’s memoirs published in 2020. “Our relationship is a thorny bond of pride, pain, shame, gratitude, jealousy, mutual admiration and disappointment” – the artist wrote.\nThe BBC recalls that Mariah also spoke about the love she felt for her mother. She expressed this in the dedication to the memoir: “Pat, my mother, who did the best she could. I will love you the best I can, always.”\nMariah’s relationship with her sister, 63-year-old Alison, was equally complex. In her memoirs, she wrote that at the time, “it was emotionally and psychologically safer for her not to have contact” with her siblings, according to People. The BBC adds that after the book was published, Alison sued Mariah.\nSEE ALSO: He claims Mariah Carey stole the title of his song “All I Want for Christmas is You.” He’s demanding $20 million\nKariera Mariah Carey\nMariah Carey is one of the most popular female singers in history.

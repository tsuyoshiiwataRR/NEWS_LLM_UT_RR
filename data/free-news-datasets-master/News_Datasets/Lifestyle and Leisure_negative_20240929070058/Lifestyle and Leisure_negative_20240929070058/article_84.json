    "text": "Some people just don't respond well to rejection, even when that rejection is only perceived and comes in the form of an employee handing in their notice, even if they've never treated the employee well or cared much for them in the first place. Anyone who has been around the block a couple of times in their career will know how this goes. They'll say it's about betrayal and the fact that you're leaving your ream high and dry with a touch of \"How could you do this to us,\" this might be followed by silent treatments or tantrums or otherwise trying to discredit your contributions and scapegoat you for problems that they might have caused themselves—all before you're even out the door. Chances are you've given notice as a professional courtesy and actually have no legal or contractual obligation to see it through. So, the question begins to form in your mind of just how much you're going to put up with before you don't turn up the next day to see your notice period through. Restaurants and kitchens can be notoriously terrible places to work for places like this, with far too many businesses in the industry being owned and operated by small businesses headed by individuals who have no people skills or care for it—and with far too many managers with nasty tempers triggered by short fuses. It's a brutal industry with long shifts and low margins that breeds stress and exploitative, or just disingenuous, practices. This restaurant worker shared how they left just a couple of days into their notice period after facing inappropriate behavior from one of their bosses, forcing them to choose instead to cut their losses and walk. See below the text messages they shared between them and their other manager, followed by their account of events and responses from the community. Like what you see?

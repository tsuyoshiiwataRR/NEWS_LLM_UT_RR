    "text": "Criticism erupted on social media after a Thai man was seen taking photos with his car on a deserted expressway . The incident raised questions about the legality of such actions, with netizens speculating it might be the Bang Yai – Kanchanaburi route. Relevant officials are being urged to investigate the matter. A video clip showing the man posing with his car on an empty expressway was shared widely, sparking intense online debate. Many social media users are questioning whether this behaviour is permissible, given the road appears to not have yet been opened to the public. The expressway in question is suspected to be the Bang Yai-Kanchanaburi Intercity motorway. This route was initially opened for free trial use during the new year. Subsequently, the section between Nakhon Pathom and Kanchanaburi toll gates has been opened every Friday at 3pm and closed on Sundays at 9pm, starting from April 26. The controversy has drawn numerous comments from the online community. Some questioned the legality of the man’s actions, wondering how he managed to access the closed route. Others expressed their disbelief and frustration about the situation. “Is this even legal? How did he get there?” “I see this happening a lot. Immediate investigation needed!” Officials issued a warning, advising people to exercise caution. They highlighted that certain parts of the expressway are still under construction. Stopping or taking photos on these roads is strictly prohibited to prevent potential accidents, reported KhaoSod. In related news, a sudden brake by a van led to a four-car pile-up on the motorway , resulting in injuries and requiring rescue operations. The accident occurred at 5pm on August 19, with emergency services swiftly responding to the scene. In other news, a collision between two trailer trucks on a Chon Buri motorway has left one driver with minor injuries. The incident took place at 10.16pm on Tuesday, August 27. Thailand News",

    "text": "Parcourez la nécrologie de Wendy Irene Macintyre Fraser June 20 1954 August 26 2024 70 Years Old résidant dans la province Nova Scotia pour le détail des funérailles Wendy Fraser Obituary It is with heavy hearts and profound sorrow that we, the family, announce the passing of Wendy Irene (Macintyre) Fraser on Monday, August 26, 2024, following a hard-fought and courageous battle with cancer. While cancer may have ultimately won the fight, Wendy will forever live on in our memories and our hearts. Born in Sydney Mines on June 20, 1954, Wendy was one of seventeen children born to the late Rod (Topper) and Ellen (Vickers) Macintyre. She was a loving mother, grandmother, partner, sister, aunt, and friend and will be greatly missed by all those who knew and loved her. Prior to her illness, Wendy had been employed as head bartender at Branch 8 Legion in Sydney Mines for 46 years. She was a long-time member of Branch 8 and a 50-year member of the Ladies Auxiliary, having served as its president for 26 years before stepping down due to ill health. Wendy dedicated her entire adult life to working for and on behalf of veterans and received many awards for her hard work and dedication. For her dedication and commitment, Wendy was awarded the Meritorious Service Award (Auxiliary) and the Meritorious Service Medal (Branch). She was also awarded the Palm Leaf, which is one of the highest awards a legion member can receive. This award recognized not only her work on behalf of the branch and veterans but also her community involvement. Wendy also catered to many suppers at the Legion and was known in the community for her delicious meals (especially her gravy). Before her illness, Wendy loved to travel whenever she could. Her travels took her to many places, including Spain, New Orleans, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, to name but a few. Wendy was also an avid bingo player and never found a bingo game she didn’t like. Wendy enjoyed life and lived life to the fullest. Wendy is survived by daughters Crystal Serafinus and Nicole Fraser and grandchildren Brianne, Logan, Zach, Keisha, Jeremiah, Grayson, and Zoe. She is also survived by her loving partner, Brian Bobbitt, who was by her side through it all and who was her rock to lean on. Also, stepdaughters Holly MacMillan (Mike) and Crystal Larade (Joe), stepson Brian Bobbitt Jr. (Victoria), and step-grandchildren MC, Max, Madison, Emma, and Leah. Also left to mourn her loss are her sisters Ann Mann (Jim), Barbara Macintyre (Paul), Cathy Macintosh (George), and Heather Macintyre (Sharon) and brothers Len Macintyre (Margie) and Cliff Macintyre (Ruth). Also, by numerous nieces and nephews. Besides her parents, Rod and Ellen, Wendy was predeceased by sisters Bev Tobin, Alice Power, Bernetta MacGean and, three sisters in infancy, and brothers Arthur, Purvis, Clayton, and Raymond MacIntyre. While our hearts mourn Wendy’s loss, we take comfort in the fact that she is no longer suffering. A special thank you to the VON and the palliative care nurses for the excellent care provided to Wendy, both at home and at the An Cala Palliative Care unit at the Regional. Your kindness and compassion were greatly appreciated. Also, a heartfelt thank you to Mary Helen Luker, friend and caregiver, who went above and beyond for Wendy and the entire family. We will be forever grateful. Per Wendy’s wishes, cremation has taken place. A celebration of Wendy’s life will be held at Branch 8 Legion, Main Street, Sydney Mines, on September 27, 2024. The family will receive visitors at a meet & greet at 1 pm, followed by the service at 2 pm. Light lunch will follow. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the An Cala Palliative Care Unit at the Regional Hospital or to a charity of one’s choice.

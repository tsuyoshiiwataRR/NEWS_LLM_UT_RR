    "text": "By Weston Blasi\nPrices for the famous tennis cocktail have been raised six times since 2012\nOne of the most popular attractions at the U.S. Open isn't the tennis, but the tournament's signature cocktail, the \"Honey Deuce.\"\nThe drink, made of Grey Goose Vodka, lemonade raspberry liqueur and honeydew, has become so popular over the years that 450,000 were sold at last year's U.S. Open. That's $9.9 million in sales.\nBut despite its popularity, some fans have groaned over the price of the drink; it increased again this year to $23 from $22 (up 4.5%). And while the U.S. has gone through periods of inflation in recent years, the price of the Honey Deuce has exceeded that pace, going up six times since 2012.\nHere's how prices of the drink compare with year-over-year inflation, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics:\nThe price of the Honey Deuce has increased 64% since 2012, compared with a 37% increase in inflation over the same period.\nThe U.S. has been in a multi-year period of high inflation. And while it has gone down from a four-decade high in 2022, consumer prices were still up 2.9% in July compared with last year.\nIn addition to increases in consumer prices, labor costs for companies have increased too. Grey Goose likely pays its workers more to sell drinks at its stands at the U.S. Open than it did back in 2012.\nGrey Goose did not respond to request for comment.\nFood and beverage servers in the U.S. made an average hourly wage of $14.29 an hour in 2023, compared to $11.96 in 2012, according to the BLS.\nRead on: How much Arizona's 99-cent Iced Tea would cost if it kept up with inflation\nA video of two men buying the same woman a Honey Deuce went viral Wednesday and has over 20 million views on social media.\n-Weston Blasi\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "text": "[90 Day Fiancé](https://screenrant.com/db/tv-show/90-day-fiance/) star [Loren Brovarnik](https://screenrant.com/tag/loren-brovarnik/) can’t stop putting her foot in her mouth – the new comments she’s made about [Michael Ilesanmi](https://screenrant.com/tag/michael-ilesanmi/) while showing her love for [Angela Deem](https://screenrant.com/tag/angela-deem/) are insensitive and how! Loren has been in the news for mostly the wrong reasons in the past few months. It started with [Loren trying to lose her baby weight](https://screenrant.com/90-day-fiance-loren-hottest-model-poses-weight-loss-mommy-makeover/) obsessively and then undergoing surgery while calling it “natural.” She was called out when she smiled while posing for photos at a memorial in Israel. I would have preferred that Loren calmed down once she became a fan-favorite again for standing her ground [when Thaís Ramone and Sophie Sierra](https://screenrant.com/90-day-fiance-real-reason-thais-ramone-upset-loren-brovarnik/) bullied her on the Tell All, but Loren did just the opposite. While fans thought the Loren they loved and respected was back, she went ahead and praised Angela to the point that I felt like Loren was justifying Angela’s on-screen behavior. [Loren is very pro-Angela](https://screenrant.com/90-day-fiance-all-times-bottom-feeder-loren-brovarnik-dissed-castmates-said-angela-deem-played/), and it’s not a good look for her. She’s actively defending Angela while also saying Michael is a scammer despite Angela’s own private investigator having proved the Nigerian man’s innocence.

With so many to choose from, here are some of the best reality TV shows to stream or watch right now. Is Loren Acting Like A \"Bottom Feeder\" Again? Loren Should Mind Her Own Business Loren has an opinion about every cast member, and she doesn’t hold back while expressing it. She was the one who said she loathed Big Ed Brown when asked to name the cast members she disliked on a podcast. Loren could have chosen to dismiss the question, but she chose to name Big Ed. I often feel that Loren tries hard to impress fans. She knows that Big Ed is a generally unpopular cast member, so naming him wasn’t going to get her in trouble. However, Loren also did not expect Big Ed to be asked about her in an interview. Big Ed expected Loren to have shown some sympathy towards him. That’s the least he can expect from a co-star when he has to hear negative comments about his appearance, etc. online. He was hurt and said that Loren was a “bottom feeder.” He meant that Loren was like a troll making a fake account just to bully a cast member in the comment section. Loren could have learned from her mistake and not called Michael a scammer because that seemed to be something he'd been accused of for years. Michael's A User, But Angela's Worse Michael Did Not Deserve To Be Treated Badly, Even If He Were A Scammer Loren tried to again mimic what anonymous people online had to say about Michael using Angela to come to America. However, I think it would have been a better idea for Loren to also admit that Angela was also never an angel in the relationship. She knew what Michael wanted and treated him like dirt. Loren said she loved Angela in an Instagram Live. She said Michael had played Angela. In a different Live video that I watched on her Instagram, [Loren](https://www.instagram.com/p/C_I-q5KO9XP/?hl=en) declared Michael scammed Angela and that it was the “biggest scam” in the show's history. Loren did address the abusive actions of Angela on the show. She revealed she has told Angela that she doesn’t “condone” the way she handles herself and she “sometimes” doesn’t condone the way Angela speaks. Loren should have chosen her words carefully. She ended up showing sympathy for the alleged abuser and also went on to accuse Michael of buying a Mercedes using his GoFundMe money when she had no proof he had done it. Loren Keeps Defending Angela, Who's Been Abusive Angela Is Calling Michael A Fraud To Justify Her Misbehavior Michael later confirmed that the Mercedes had belonged to a friend and that he had just posed in front of it. Loren never addressed her mistake. I believe that her false accusations may have caused Michael pain and the least she could have done was publicly apologize to him on Instagram. Loren’s words show that she’s tone-deaf. I recall her saying that she doesn’t watch the show, which could be why she’s not aware of Angela’s cruel treatment of Michael. As someone who’s been a part of the franchise for so long, Loren needs to be better informed. 90 Day Fiancé: Before The 90 Days season 7 premieres on Sunday, September 1 at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC and Max.

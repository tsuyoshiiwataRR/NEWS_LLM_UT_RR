    "text": "Molly-Mae Hague has revealed the “hardest part” of her split from fiancé Tommy Fury in a new YouTube video. Just two weeks after ending their engagement, the former Love Island sensation and the professional boxer, both 25, are navigating the waves of a very public split.\nMolly-Mae and Tommy have been a couple since their time on Love Island, and the news of their split has sent ripples through their fanbase.\nThe internet has been rife with accusations aimed at Tommy. These include an alleged cheating incident with 20-year-old Danish Milla Corfixen during a holiday trip to North Macedonia.\nMolly-Mae Hague addressed the split in a YouTube video.

We were together for five years and it is very very sad,” she also said.\nMolly-Mae and Tommy Fury separated after 5 years together.

I’m not looking forward to them but I think every weekend that past it should get easier.\n“In break-ups there are parts of the days that are worse and better than others, morning and evenings are horrendous and weekends for me horrendous. In the middle of the day when your busy you’re not thinking about it and then when things slow down you think about it.\n“I was so used to how life was for so long and had a routine and everything is done with your person and there is a lot of change and it is really crap.”\n‘It’s going to be a journey’ The influencer confirmed that she will always have respect and love for Tommy, especially as he is the father of her child, Bambi, but she also recognises the need to press forward.\nShe concluded the video on a hopeful note. “It’s going to be a journey and process but I’m glad I have an online family for support.”\nRead more: Tommy Fury ruthlessly mocked as he issues new statement hitting back at ‘horrendous allegations’ about Molly-Mae split\nWho do you stand with?

    "text": "Monmouth’s 2024 Opener Ends in 42-27 Defeat to Eastern Washington\nBy the Numbers\nMonmouth University opened its 2024 football season with a disappointing 42-27 loss to Eastern Washington. The Hawks fell behind early and struggled to contain the Eagles, despite a strong performance from quarterback Derek Robertson, who completed 27 of 42 passes for 390 yards and three touchdowns. Eastern Washington's quarterback Kekoa Visperas excelled, throwing five touchdown passes and completing 89% of his passes, leading the Eagles to victory.\n- Derek Robertson recorded 390 passing yards and three touchdowns.\n- Efton Chism III of Eastern Washington had 173 receiving yards and three touchdowns.\n- Monmouth was limited to just 49 total rushing yards on 21 attempts.\nMonmouth coach Kevin Callahan criticized the team's overall performance, emphasizing their struggles on both offense and defense. Despite Robertson’s strong individual display, the Hawks were unable to execute effectively against the high-scoring Eagles.State of Play\n- Monmouth's defense allowed scoring on all four Eastern Washington drives in the second and third quarters.\n- Key penalties were minimal, with Monmouth penalized just once for five yards.\nMonmouth will look to bounce back in their home opener against Lafayette on September 7, aiming to rectify the mistakes made in their season debut.Bottom Line\nThe Hawks need to improve their defensive containment and offensive execution to compete effectively in upcoming games, as individual performances alone may not suffice against tougher opponents.\nRead more at\n Monmouth University Athletics\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

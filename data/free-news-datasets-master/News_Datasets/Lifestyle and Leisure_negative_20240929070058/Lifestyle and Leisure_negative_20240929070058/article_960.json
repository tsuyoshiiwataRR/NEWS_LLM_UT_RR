    "text": "A woman has shared a furious rant about her husband as she detailed the heated argument they had after he invited her mother on a two-week couples getaway without consulting her.\nThe anonymous woman took to Reddit to express her issues with her spouse and admitted that she and her partner, whom she did not name, were “digital nomads” living in the United States.\nIn a thread titled Am I the idiot? The exasperated wife detailed the anger she felt when she discovered her mother-in-law would be joining them on the couple’s trip.\nShe explained that she was “completely left out of the decision” and added that as a “married couple” they should have discussed it together.\nThe furious woman questioned whether she was wrong to voice her concerns and revealed that her husband even threatened to divorce her if she did not “accept his mother”.\nA woman has shared a furious rant about her husband as she details the heated argument they had after he invited her mother on a romantic getaway without consulting her (file image)\nThe post was titled: “Am I an idiot for getting into an argument with my husband after he booked tickets for his mother to come with us on a two-week trip without asking me first?”\nShe explained that she and her husband loved traveling around the world.\n‘My husband and I live in the US, but we’re digital nomads, so we like to spend six-month periods traveling abroad. Last year we traveled to Thailand and this year we’re in Brazil, exploring the northeast and then heading south.\n“We are Brazilians, so our entire family lives in this country,” said the woman, who noted that they had planned to travel around Brazil on a romantic getaway.\nHowever, their romantic trip was cut short when her husband revealed that his mother would be joining them for two weeks.\nShe explained: ‘We’re doing different periods of time in different cities. We’ve already done Fortaleza (one month), and now we’re doing São Luiz (10 days), then Maceió (two weeks), then other cities in the south and then each of us will go our separate ways to be in our home cities for two months. It’s just me, him and our baby dog, enjoying our great time as a couple.\n‘However, last night at dinner I found out that he and his mom decided ALONE that she should come the entire two-week trip to Maceió.\n‘Two weeks with my mother-in-law in a tiny flat. There’s no turning back, the decision is made, the flights booked and everything.\nThe anonymous woman took to Reddit to express her issues with her spouse and admitted that she and her husband, whom she did not name, were “digital nomads” living in the US.\n‘Now I understand that he and his mom live in different countries, and they miss each other… but he’s going to spend TWO MONTHS with her in her hometown at the end of the trip anyway, so that’s plenty of time to enjoy her company.’\nThe anonymous wife said she was angry that her husband did not consult her first, adding that they should have discussed it before he bought the tickets.\nShe added: “What I mean is that I was completely left out of the decision. I think that as a married couple, you should consult each other before making decisions like this. Maybe ask: ‘Honey, is it okay if I take my mother to Maceió? For the two weeks?'”\nThe Reddit user noted that she would have been fine with her husband’s mother coming over for a week, but was hurt that he didn’t even think to ask her opinion.\nShe added: “It’s a huge lack of respect towards me because it shows that my opinion doesn’t matter and that he’s going to do what he wants regardless of what I think or feel. As if I had to put up with it and accept it.”\nAt the end of the post, she revealed that their argument took a shocking turn when she confronted her husband about it and that he even threatened to divorce her if she did not agree to her mother joining them.\nShe added: ‘This is what happened when I found out: I immediately had an argument with him over dinner (I was very discreet) where I was clearly angry. I was telling him how upset and offended I was to have been completely excluded from the decision.\nPeople on the web flooded the comments section and rushed to the woman’s defense while criticizing her husband.\n‘He took immense offense that I wasn’t 100 percent happy and excited for his mom to spend the two weeks with us (he thinks I should be, although it was a surprise to me), and even went so far as to physically remove his wedding ring as a way to show ‘either you accept my mom or we can go our separate ways. ‘\n‘Later after dinner he even said things like “if you and I get divorced, we’ll share Penny (our dog).” LIKE THAT?! Excuse me, sir!?\nThe anonymous woman then wondered if she was a “moron” for starting an argument about the situation.\nPeople on the web flooded the comments section and rushed to the woman’s defense while criticizing her husband.\nOne person said: “It sounds to me like he’s going to extremes to get her to regret it. This is incredibly manipulative. And there is a chance of ‘backing out’. They may lose money, but this isn’t a done deal. Although it may be for their marriage. This man has no respect for OP and that’s a real relationship killer.”\nSomeone else added: ‘No, not the moron. This guy is a moron. First for not asking you if his mother could travel with you and second for his over the top, stupid, petty antics.\n‘Take off your wedding ring? Give you ultimatums? Ask you about joint custody of your dog? Girl, fuck that noise. Seriously, I would not travel with them. This is beyond mean, cruel, and controlling. He’s telling you to do what he wants without question or he’ll divorce you. This is not a nice person. Fuck him and his mother. I would change my ticket and go home. This is just too disrespectful to me.’\nAnother user wrote: “If you can, keep the dog. Leave the husband.”\n“Give him the divorce he wants. The lack of respect is disgusting. No to the asshole,” someone else added.\nOne user commented: “Don’t listen to him. Get divorce papers. He doesn’t value you or your marriage if he’s willing to use you as a bargaining chip.”",

    "text": "DEAR MISS MANNERS: A few days after I got my brand-new, light-colored couch, I had friends over with their new baby. When the dad started changing the baby’s diaper directly on my new couch, I quickly offered to put a blanket down. He glared at me like I’d insulted him, and they left soon after. Was I wrong to offer? GENTLE READER: New parents are told that their baby is upset for one of a very limited number of reasons. The menu for the new parents themselves may be slightly longer, but no good comes of your guessing the father’s look was meant to convey that you insulted their baby by reasonably offering a blanket. Miss Manners prefers to think the parents were tired or needed to get home for baby’s bedtime, and are looking forward to their next visit. *** (Please send your questions to Miss Manners at her website, www.missmanners.com ; to her email, [dearmissmanners@gmail.com](mailto:dearmissmanners@gmail.com); or through postal mail to Miss Manners, Andrews McMeel Syndication, 1130 Walnut St., Kansas City, MO 64106.)

    "text": "It took their breath away.\nAs if Boeing planes weren’t plagued by enough problems of late : Passengers flew into a panic after oxygen masks deployed in their faces aboard a Boeing 737, as seen in a dramatic clip taking off online.\nThe air scare occurred on Sunday, Aug. 2,5 onboard Air Algerie flight AH 1460 flying from Algeria to Lyon, France, Viral Press reported.\nThe aircraft had reportedly reached an altitude of 33,000 feet when it appeared to experience a pressurization problem, causing the life-saving accessories to deploy.\nPassengers panic as oxygen masks deploy in front of their faces. ViralPress The “cockpit crew decided to flight turn back” in order “to ensure the safety of the company’s passengers,” officials reported.

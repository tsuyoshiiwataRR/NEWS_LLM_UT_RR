    "text": "People went to great lengths to avoid exposure to COVID, but even the pandemic could not prepare most for the kind of hyper-vigilance seemingly necessitated by the events on a recent Delta Air Lines flight: an in-seat baby diaper change. A panicked discussion spilled over from Reddit onto other social media platforms, eventually making headlines after the nasty details were disclosed in a post on the subreddit Delta. \\\"The people in the row in front of me are changing a poopy diaper in their seats,” read the pseudonymous update by Jolly Armadillo. “Anyone ever experienced this?,” the passenger asked, continuing, “The smell is horrendous. There's no reason not to do this in the bathroom.” Armadillo’s post initially sparked a conversation about flight etiquette, with Redditors listing the efforts they have to take because of others’ disregard for hygiene in a shared space. Many mentioned the additional steps they're having to take after reading the horrible account. “I wipe down the armrests, seatbelt, tray table…Adding to my list!” a comment read. “New fear unlocked,” another declared. Smelly diaper changes, it turns out, aren’t unheard of on flights. “People do this all the time because their logic is ‘well, it’s just baby poop.’ POOP IS POOP it’s disgusting use the damn changing table,” one wrote furiously. “Same with bringing sick kids to the airport,” added another. “FYI, ‘kid germs’ are still germs and I didn’t need to get COVID (or something worse!) when I was flying out to see my terminally ill father.” According to some frequent-flying parents, the changing table isn’t sanitary, leaving them no choice but to subject others to the olfactory nightmare that is diaper change. If reports are true, it also comes with the risk of getting pink eye. However, the fact remains that it’s socially unacceptable to change your infant’s nappies in a flight seat.

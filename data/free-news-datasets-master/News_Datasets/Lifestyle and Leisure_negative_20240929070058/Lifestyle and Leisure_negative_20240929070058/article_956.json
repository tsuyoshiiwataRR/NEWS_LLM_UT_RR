    "text": "Dwight Howard admits he didn't want to play with Kobe Bryant in 2012 Los Angeles Lakers fans were very excited in the summer of 2012 when their favorite team traded for future Hall of Famers Steve Nash and Dwight Howard in the same offseason. Along with incumbent stars Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol, they were supposed to make the Lakers elite again and bring home an NBA championship. Of course, that's not exactly what happened. A gnarly string of injuries, including a torn Achilles for Bryant near the end of the season, the firing of head coach Mike Brown and the subsequent snubbing of legendary coach Phil Jackson resulted in Los Angeles winning just 45 games and getting swept in the first round of the playoffs. Afterward, Howard left as a free agent, and it seemed as if Lakers mystique had completely evaporated. While on [\"Gil's Arena,\"](https://x.com/GilsArenaShow/status/1829255773106667629) Howard revealed that he didn't want to play with the Lakers or alongside Bryant that season. But it wasn't for the reasons one may think. \"It was difficult playing with Kobe,\" said Howard. \"It's the expectation of winning and then it's like everybody expected me and Kobe to be the new Kobe and Shaq. I'm just coming off an injury, I'm still dealing with all the mental [expletive] from Orlando and now I gotta go to LA and I'm playing with Kobe Bryant. I watched him play, they beat us in the finals. I was already pissed because I had to go to LA and nobody knew I didn't want to go to the Lakers. I wanted to beat the Lakers, they just beat us in the finals. I wanted to go to Brooklyn and start my whole career over. But I got sent to LA and it didn't work out and I made an emotional decision to leave.\" Bryant was already a five-time NBA champion at the time, and thus any team with him on it had to face massive expectations â€” namely, championship-or-bust expectations. As that ill-fated season unfolded, Lakers fans came to the conclusion that perhaps Howard simply didn't have the grit or the chutzpah to carry the burden of being a Lakers star. He would get his redemption years later. In 2019, DeMarcus Cousins, a mercurial former All-Star center L.A. had just signed, suffered a season-ending knee injury during the summer. It turned to Howard, who by then had been greatly humbled and was desperate for one last chance. He accepted a much-reduced role that he embraced, and he played a key role off the bench, especially defensively and on the boards, as the team won the world title. After a third stint with the Purple and Gold two years later, Howard spent a year with the Taoyuan Leopards of the T1 League in Taiwan. While he didn't have a fruitful time playing with the Black Mamba, he can always say he's an NBA champion.",

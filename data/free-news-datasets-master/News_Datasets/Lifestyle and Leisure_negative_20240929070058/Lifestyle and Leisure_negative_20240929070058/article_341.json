    "text": "Australian tourists are ignoring stern government warnings as countries including Iraq,\n[Colombia](/story/8682356/) and Somalia become \"rising star\" travel destinations.\nAdventurer and travel consultant David Smyth said his clients, particularly those aged 50 to 70 years, were booking holidays\ndespite 'do not travel' advice based on threats of kidnapping and violence.\n\"History and culture are drawing these intrepid travelers who want authentic experiences,\" he said.\nMr Smyth followed their lead when he travelled to Iraq, visiting the ancient Sumerian city Ur, in 2023. \"Mesopotamia is the cradle of civilization, the history was mind blowing,\" he said.\nTravel to Iraq increased by 50 per cent over five years, despite a dip during COVID-19 lockdowns, with 15,850 Australian travellers heading to the country in 2023 compared to 9140 travellers in 2018.\nAlmost 2000 Australians aged between 50 and 70 years went to Iraq in 2018. That figure climbed to 3600 in 2023.\n\"I'm finding 70-year-olds are the new 40-year-olds,\" the Irish-born travel agent said.\n\"They're so young at heart and they're so adventurous. They're happy to go down to a budget lodge if it gets them closer to a particular temple.\"\nHowever the Australian Government warns that the \"security situation remains volatile\" in Iraq.\n\"Due to the security environment and the threat of kidnappings, you should leave Iraq immediately by commercial means, if it's safe to do so,\" the smartraveller warning said.\nMr Smyth urged caution saying \"it's not for your first-time traveler\".\n\"The main thing is common sense. Do your research and book through a reputable company.\"\n\"Book through someone local because If you book [a trip] yourself and then something goes to pot, you're on your own.\"\nHe recommended that intrepid travellers register with their consulate.\n\"We've also noticed a significant rise in the number of women doing solo cycling or driving trips to places like the west coast of Africa,\" the travel agent said.\n\"While a beach or cruise holiday would be an easier holiday option, these adventurers are driven to travel beyond their comfort zone by the desire to see history unfold, support local communities and challenge mainstream perceptions of these regions,\"\n ",

Thornton/FilmMagic,) Muni Long Opens Up About Separation From Her Husband Muni typically puts her music out there while keeping her personal business under wraps! However, she switched up her privacy habit in an interview released on August 29. The artist spilled about the latest chapter in her marriage on ‘The Cruz Show,’ a radio program based in Los Angeles.\n“This is the first time I’m putting my real life in it. It’s no secret. I’ve been married for nine years, and it just didn’t work out,” Muni Long said.\nShe didn’t specify what particular incident led to her separation from Raysean. However, the singer implied that her husband was not celebratory of the continued upward movement in her career.\n“I don’t have time for drama; I don’t have time for nonsense. This is one of the most amazing times of my life, and if you can’t celebrate that with me, I’m so sorry, I’m gonna have to leave you behind. I cannot. Like you wake up everyday mad, there’s nothing to be upset about.”\n“We have a beautiful child, we’re good. We might owe some bills, but everybody has that,” she added.\nThe singer seemed to suggest that it takes strength to realize when a situation isn’t working out. Muni Long also said that her husband, Raysean Hairston, could really be a “good man” to her if “he got it together.”\nHowever, she clarified that she’s not willing to sacrifice her life, passion, and happiness for him to catch up. Muni Long also seemingly hinted that losing her by dragging his feet will be “a powerful lesson to learn.”\nSwipe below to see everything she said about the topic.\nMore Details About The Singer’s Husband PEOPLE reports that Muni and Raysean first met in Los Angeles. Before him, she never saw herself getting married and disliked dating. Still, the estranged couple tied the knot in June 2014.\nIn 2019, they expanded their ties from married lovers to co-workers after conceptualizing and co-founding the record label Supergiant Records together, per Billboard .\nTo date, he has reportedly served as a composer and producer on some of her tracks. In a 2023 interview with NPR , she credited Raysean for the official pronunciation of her stage name.\nMuni Long’s sentiments during the Cruz Show interview differed from those when she also spoke to Jenifer Hudson in February 2023. At that time, she described their relationship as “amazing,” adding that he keeps her “cool” during her poetic phases.\nMuni Has Been In Her Bag Since 2022 Keep in mind that Muni Long has been in the entertainment industry since the late 2000s, primarily as a songwriter. However, over the years she’s carved a lane for herself from the booth. In 2022, her song ‘Hrs & Hrs’ went from gold to platinum in about a month, per Rated R&B.\nAccording to a January 2022 interview, Raysean inspired that song . For months, TikTok users were obsessed with the track, even sparking the ‘Hrs & Hrs’ challenge. The social media trend had amateur and celebrity singers trying to keep up with her runs on the song!\nAdditionally, her interview on ‘The Cruz Show’ came days before the release of her second album, ‘Revenge,’ on August 30. Track five, titled after the album, speaks of moving on from a failed relationship without seeking revenge.\n“Not lookin’ for revenge. Especially on someone I once considered a friend. I’d rather make amends. ‘Cause I loved you to no ends. Not lookin’ for revenge. Right now, it’s 1AM. And I don’t know where you been. Or who you with, but f**k that b***h,” Muni Long sings in the song.\nRELATED: Allison Holker Sparks Romance Rumors Nearly Two Years After Husband tWitch Boss Passed Away (PHOTO) What Do You Think Roomies? +1 3 +1 0 +1 0 +1 0 +1 0 +1 1 +1 0",

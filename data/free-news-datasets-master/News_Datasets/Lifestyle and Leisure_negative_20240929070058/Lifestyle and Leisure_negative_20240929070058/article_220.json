    "text": "Since 2023, reports of the presence of renowned Hollywood actor Channing Tatum in the Yucatan Peninsula surfaced. Even a photograph taken at the Mérida airport caused a stir. However, there was no further information or evidence, and people said the image was fake.\nHowever, in 2024, the Yucatecans were surprised after the release of the trailer for the movie Blink Twice because, in the clip, people can see scenes recorded on a hacienda in Yucatán.\nAlthough Channing Tatum said he was amazed by the construction located on the Peninsula, the actor recently confessed that he became severely ill.\nTatum stated that his health was affected after drinking water from a pool in a Hacienda in Yucatán while filming the film in which Zoë Kravitz makes her directorial debut. However, Channing managed to recover, although the experience did remain.\nIt was in an interview with Buzzfeed that the actor announced that he spent 12 hours in the bathroom, vomiting.\nThis after accidentally swallowing water from a pool while recording at the Hacienda Temozón in Yucatán, which became the setting for a Hollywood project.\nThe actor and his girlfriend, Zoë Kravitz, shared that the incident occurred during the filming. Simon Rex, the co-star, was also affected by the water in the pool.\nChanning Tatum, 44, confirmed that he needed an injection to recover. However, the couple, engaged since 2023, took the situation with humor. “It was an incredible party,” joked the 35-year-old daughter of musician Lenny Kravitz.\nTYT Newsroom",

    "text": "13 Illegal Interview Questions Hiring Managers Still Try To Ask\nInterviews can be nerve-wracking. But what do you do when an employer asks you a very personal — and illegal — question?\nIt may be 2024, but some companies are still stuck in the archaic ages. That means from time to time, they can ask questions that have long been deemed inappropriate, not to mention illegal. You do not have to answer these questions if they come up as they do not pertain to the job at hand.\nA quick perusal of job boards shows that these illegal questions still tend to pop up during interviews.\n1. Are You Married?\nThis question is mostly directed at women, though it has been asked of men, as well. Not only is it illegal to ask you about your marital status, your employer cannot ask if you are living with a domestic partner, either.\nSimply put, your personal life — including your dating life — is nobody's business but your own and has zero impact on your ability to do your job.\n2. Are You a US Citizen?\nWhile you do need credentials to be able to legally work in the United States, you do not have to be a citizen. Employers will eventually be aware of your citizenship status, given that you have to pay taxes, but it's not something they can ask in an interview.\nAdditionally, an employer cannot ask you if your parents are citizens or variations thereof.\n3. Are You (Do You Plan to Become) Pregnant?\nOne of the major concerns that may spark this question is whether a woman will leave when she has a baby. However, no matter if you are pregnant, wish to become pregnant, or don't plan to have children, this question doesn't belong in an interview.\nIf the hiring manager brings up the subject, you're well within your rights to say that it's a personal question between you and your family.\n4. Have You Ever Been Arrested?\nThis question is a doozy, because while an employer can reject your application due to a criminal history, an arrest or even spending a night in jail does not equate to guilt.\nSometimes people are erroneously arrested based on false information and some have spent a night in jail without being charged. That's why it's important to have all of the facts and why only convictions should count against you.\n5. Have You Been Injured on the Job Before?\nEvery employer wants to mitigate risk, but asking someone if they've suffered an injury in the workplace before is unacceptable. Even if you were injured, that should not play into whether or not you get a job with someone else.\nYou do not have to disclose this to any prospective employer and can ignore the question if asked.\n6. Are You a Republican or Democrat?\nAn employer cannot ask you what your political affiliation is if it does not pertain to the job. This is considered a form of discrimination. They don't need to know who you voted or plan to vote for, nor do they need to know your take on any specific hot-button issues.\nWith political tensions as escalated as they are, it's a good idea to redirect the conversation, or politely refuse to answer.\n7. Are You Disabled?\nWhile there are certain disabilities that can impact your ability to do a job, employers cannot come right out and ask if you're disabled. That is your choice to disclose when and if necessary. An employer also cannot ask if you are taking any medications or about your mental health.\nIf you do decide to disclose a disability, your employer is within their rights to ask what they can do to help you overcome it in the workplace.\n8. What Is Your Financial Standing?\nSome positions, such as those dealing with handling money or sensitive information, require someone to be in good financial standing and have a good credit score. However, it's not okay for a hiring manager to ask you personally what your financial standing is like.\nYour credit score, with rare exceptions, and the amount of money or assets you own is nobody's business but yours.\n9. What Religion Are You?\nThis is seemingly another way to discriminate against prospective employees, by asking them what religion they are. It's also illegal.\nIt's nobody's business whether you are Catholic, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, or one of many other religions. Unless you're working with a specific type of organization, you can remain mum on this one.\n10. Do You Have Childcare?\nThis is another personal question that seems to come up from time to time. Employers want to know who watches your children to generally get an idea of how reliable the childcare aspect is.\nThe concern is that you'll miss time at work because you have nobody to watch your children, and time is money. Regardless of how innocuous this question may seem, it's illegal to ask.\n11. Any Genetic or Physical Characteristics\nOther questions among those that are illegal include inquiries into your weight, age, gender, sexual orientation, race, or nationality. In a private questionnaire, you have the opportunity to disclose some of those variables, but they cannot be brought up during an interview.\nThese types of questions can be viewed as discriminatory, especially if they were to keep you from getting a position you're otherwise qualified for.\n12. How Old Are You?\nFor most people, their age has no bearing on their abilities, but some employers tend to want to hire younger or older, depending on their company values and needs.\nThis question could actually be disguised as another question, such as what year were you born? How old are your children, or even, do you have any grandchildren? All variations of asking for your age are illegal and you do not have to answer.\n13. Where Do You Live?\nUnless you are required to live within a specific distance of your job — such as if you're on a local police force or you work in a government capacity in a region — employers are not entitled to know anything about your living situation.\nThis also goes for whether you rent or own, or what you pay per month for your home.",

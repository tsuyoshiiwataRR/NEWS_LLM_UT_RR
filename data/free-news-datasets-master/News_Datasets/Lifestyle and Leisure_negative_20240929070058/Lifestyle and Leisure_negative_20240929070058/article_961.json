    "text": "Amare Snowden was losing control.\nHe was sitting against a wall outside of a meeting room at UW-Platteville during the University of Wisconsin football team’s training camp and physically rejecting the news he’d just been given. Snowden’s mother, Angela Key, died at the age of 42 on Aug. 7, a bit more than a week into the grind of the off-site portion of preseason practices.\nSnowden’s grandmother called to tell him of Key’s death, and a new phase of his life had just begun.\n“It was very traumatizing, heartbreaking for me,” Snowden said Tuesday. “Just had to … not just have to deal with it, but I just had to take that lump of depression and emotions.”\nSnowden, a redshirt freshman cornerback for the Badgers, was the last one out of the meeting room that day. Through tears, he repeatedly slammed his phone against the tile floor outside the meeting room, breaking the device. Senior cornerback RJ Delancy III did what he could to console his teammate.\nPeople are also reading…\nThe transfer from Toledo experienced the same anguish as Snowden, having lost his father suddenly in 2020. He told Snowden words that have helped keep Snowden grounded and able to continue pushing heading into the team’s opener at 8 p.m. Friday against Western Michigan.\n“I told him straight up,” Delancy said, \"'Don’t let nobody tell you that you’ll be OK. You’ll never be OK.'\"\n’The goofy, big kid’\nSnowden always could count on his biggest cheerleader’s encouragement growing up.\nHe was one of Key’s three children, but all of them felt her energy from the stands or the sidelines. Key worked as a nurse at the Henry Ford Cancer Institute’s service line, and Snowden said he saw how she invested energy into each of her children every day.\n“She loved her kids, supportive, caring,” he said. “She was always asking if I'm good. … Any nick, bruise, sickness I had, she took care of it.\n“Goofy, loving, funny. She loved to dance. That’s why I think I fall under that, being just the goofy, big kid. Always laughing, can dance a little bit — we both had no, got no rhythm. I fall under that. So I feel some of those traits came from her.”\nSnowden exceled at football but also was a star baseball player, a lefty pitcher who had multiple Division I offers. That was the path that Key was hoping her son would take, but she stood behind him when he followed coach Luke Fickell and flipped his commitment from Cincinnati to Wisconsin, ending his chances of playing both sports in college.\n“She’s baseball all the way,” Snowden said smiling. “My mom didn't really know nothing about football, but she knew that the mental (side) was draining, for sure, college athlete and being a student at the same time. So it was hard, going to miss the check-ups and just checking on the mental and stuff like that. But I know she's in a better place now.”\nSnowden said his family’s awaiting answers regarding how Key died.\nSnowden often carries a baseball with him. It’s a comfort device — feeling the raised seams and stitches helps him to be present in the moment. His baseballs helped him through the test of stamina that training camp presents, and they now hold even more meaning as a channel through which he can connect with his mother.\n“Just being able to rub it, being in the now,” Snowden said, “that helped me a lot, just being mentally here, in the moment. I don't know if people know, but fall camp is from sunup to sundown. You don't stop.\n“I always think about like, ‘Fall camp, it just had to …’”\nSnowden paused for a bit, knowing he wouldn’t have been prepared for this loss at any moment.\n“I took it as a challenge, like you just gotta keep going. Fall camp is sunup to sundown, it don't wait on nobody. You maybe get, what, an hour or two just to relax and get to ourselves? But other than that it's just football and work. I had the baseball to deal and try to ease my pain and ease my mind.”\nSnowden didn’t practice for two days after he received the news of his mother’s death. That decision angered him in the moment, but he now says he appreciates Fickell and cornerbacks coach Paul Haynes keeping him out of those sessions. He didn’t leave camp, miss a practice or meeting until last week when he returned to Detroit for Key’s funeral. Snowden said seeing family was both cathartic and difficult given the circumstances, and the trip was a quick turnaround to be back in Madison for a team meeting Sunday.\nCoaches, teammates provide needed support\nSnowden credits Fickell and Haynes’ consistency and thoroughness of support over the past month. Both have been actively reaching out to him, giving him chances to verbalize his ache when he needs to and providing him space when he needs it. Fickell, who’s known Snowden and his family for the better part of five years, has been in contact with both sides in an effort to support Snowden.\n“I don't have any like, nothing to fall back on to say I've been through it, you know, so it's difficult,” Fickell said. “But I think when you have a relationship with those guys, when it starts in recruiting and it's continuous, it’s not like there's some magic words you can say, but that's why I think it's so critical.\n“That's hard on anybody, a guy could be in the NFL (and it’d be hard), but 18 to 22, the first time you're away from home, that's one of the things I worry about with where the evolution of college ball could be going into more of a transactional world, that things like this on an 18, 19 year old, can get lost, right? I mean, they could just pass it off to some expert when that's good, but I think if they don't have the support from around them and the relationships around them, it's going to be really, really difficult for those guys. And so fortunate enough to have known the family for a long time and he feels comfortable coming up and talking and being able to air some of that. And so from both sides, that makes me feel really good about the relationship we do have as well.”\nHaving teammates like Delancy and Fourqurean, the latter of which is also Snowden’s roommate, provides sounding boards who have firsthand knowledge and sources of encouragement.\n“When people say, it’s going to be OK — because that's the first thing people would say — but it's truly not,” Snowden said about the advice his veteran teammates have given him. “Them two guys, they been through it. … They helped me through it. And it's still fresh on me. It's so fresh on me. I gotta just keep going, gotta keep playing, let's get my mind out of it and just keep balling.”\nAdded Delancy: “I told him how I took it when I found out my dad died. I told him, my reaction was the same as his. But I told him at the end of the day, that’s not going to do nothing but make you more angry. I told him, 'Make sure you don’t hold it in. You can go somewhere and cry it out. If you hold it out, it’s just going to build anger up in you, which is what it did for me.’ But I realized that’s not the answer. Amare took that and went with it. … I told him I love him.”\nOther cornerbacks were impressed with Snowden’s ability to continue playing through his tragedy, let alone continue to be the good-natured teammate they’ve come to know.\n“He's been a really good, really good guy to be around,” cornerback Ricardo Hallman said. “I know he told me being around the guys and being around football helped him out a lot with the emotions he's going through. So just we constantly let him know that we're here for him, whatever he needs to talk about, whatever he needs from us, he knows that he can lean on us.”\nSnowden will run through the tunnel at Camp Randall on Friday as part of the Badgers two-deep, a boundary cornerback expected to be available to sub in at a moment’s notice. He’ll do so knowing healing isn’t a linear process.\n“It's hard, man,” he said. “It's even … even if she was alive, things are still hard being a college athlete and stuff like that. But it’s what you live for. I took it on as a challenge. Yes, I'm hurting, but I still have to keep going for her, for rest of my family, for my two brothers back at home that doesn't have our mom … just being there for them, being a safety blanket for them, both of those guys and my grandma, too. My dad called me his ‘strong child’ on his side. I don't really get too emotional. But when things hurt, they hurt.”",

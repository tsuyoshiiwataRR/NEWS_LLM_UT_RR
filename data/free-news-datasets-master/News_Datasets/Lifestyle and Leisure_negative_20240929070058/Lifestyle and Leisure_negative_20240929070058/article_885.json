    "text": "In a heartfelt revelation, [Muni Long](https://hollywoodunlocked.com/?s=Muni+long+) has shared a significant life update with her fans while promoting her highly anticipated new album, “Revenge.” During her recent appearance on The Cruz Show on Real 92.3 LA, the talented singer, known for her hit “Made For Me,” disclosed that she and her husband, Raysean Hairston, have decided to part ways after nine years of marriage. Long emphasized the importance of prioritizing her happiness over any relationship drama. “It’s no secret. I’ve been married for nine years… it just didn’t work out, you know? Again, like I was saying, I don’t have time for drama. I don’t have time for nonsense,” she explained candidly. The singer expressed that this period in her life is one of her most fulfilling, stating, “This is one of the most amazing times in my life, and if you can’t celebrate that with me, I’m so sorry, but I’m going to have to leave you behind. I cannot.” While she refrained from delving too deeply into the reasons for their separation, Long provided insight into her feelings about the relationship. “You wake up every day mad, and there’s literally nothing to be upset about. We have a beautiful child, we’re good. We might owe some bills, but everybody has that. I think it takes incredible strength to realize that this was the love of my life at one point—and he probably could be really good for me if he got it together—but I’m not willing to put my life, my passion, and my happiness on hold for you to catch up. Unfortunately, you might get it in a year…but I’m sorry, I’m probably already over it.” Raysean Hairston, a talented producer who has played a significant role in composing many of Muni’s songs, has yet to publicly comment on the recent breakup.

Her new album “Revenge” is now available, and she has described it as deeply personal. In a previous interview with iHeartRadio, she shared her thoughts on the album, stating, “This album means so much to me. It’s cathartic. It’s like my journal. I normally don’t have people in my business because it’s none of your business. You don’t need to know what I’m doing. I don’t want you to know what I’m doing.” She added, “This is the first time that I’m actually using my music and using my gifts to sort of vent about what’s going on in my real life.”",

    "text": "There’s a lot of backstory here, but I’ll keep it short. I’m 6 months’ pregnant with my first baby after years of infertility and finally success with IVF. I haven’t told any of my family. And I’m thinking about not telling them ever, or at least until after the birth. I live in another country from my family, and have seen them twice in 5 years. They disapprove of many of my life choices, and will go for periods of months ignoring me for minor things, not wish me a happy birthday, etc. I’ve never had a great relationship with my parents and I am completely estranged from my sister. I come from an insular culture with very different social norms to the mainstream, but I now live a ‘normal’ life with a professional job, partner who isn’t from that culture, etc. They don’t know anything about my fertility struggles or pregnancy, but I know if I tell them, they’ll be angry and hurt I didn’t tell them. Babies are very prized in our culture and I’m having one quite late (early 30s) and they’ll be on the next flight over - which I don’t want. My partner feels uncomfortable about me hiding this from them - and keeping baby from its grandparents. And everyone keeps asking me what my parents feel about my pregnancy. I’m starting to second-guess my decision. AIBU in keeping this news private?",

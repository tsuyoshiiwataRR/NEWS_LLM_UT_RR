    "text": "A serial shoplifter has been arrested after allegedly stealing multiple items, including a Bratz sweatshirt, from a Target in Cape Coral .\nAccording to the Cape Coral Police Department , on June 2, at approximately 7:40 p.m., officers responded to the Target at 1890 NE Pine Island Road about a retail theft.\nTarget’s loss prevention staff said 38-year-old Tabetha Crystal Doden grabbed three sets of leggings, a pink shirt and a gray Bratz sweatshirt from the women’s clothing department.\nDoden also walked over to the shoe department and took off her shoes, replacing them with a new pair in a shoe box.\nLater, Doden walked out, hiding the items she had taken. She passed all points of sale and was encountered by the loss prevention staff near the exit doors.\nShe reportedly pushed the loss prevention member out of her way and rode away on her bicycle with the stolen items.\nThe investigation revealed that Doden has six prior theft convictions in Lee County . She was already in custody at the Lee County Jail on unrelated charges.\nDodan is being charged with grand theft and battery.",

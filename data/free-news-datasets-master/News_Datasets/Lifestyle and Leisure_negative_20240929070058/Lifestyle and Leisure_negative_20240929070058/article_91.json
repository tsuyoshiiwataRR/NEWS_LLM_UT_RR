    "text": "Star actress Sandra Bullock has appeared in box office hits such as Bird Box, The Blind Side, and Bullet Train. However, the Oscar winner has been temporarily sidelined after suffering an injury.\nIt is still unclear what happened to the The Proposal star. But whatever occurred, it appears to be serious. Because TMZ cameras caught the actress leaving physical therapy on crutches.\nSandra Bullock Hobbles on Crutches, Going to Physical Therapy | Click to read more üëá‚Äî TMZ (@TMZ)\n [August 29, 2024]\nSandra Bullock Caught on Crutches\n‚ÄúSandra Bullock‚Äôs walking ‚ÄúSpeed‚Äù has taken a hit ‚Ä¶ the actress is sporting a pair of crutches after suffering an undisclosed injury.\nThe Oscar winner was spotted leaving a physical therapy session in Santa Monica Wednesday ‚Ä¶ leaning on a pair of crutches while walking with an aide to her car nearby,‚Äù\nTMZ wrote.\n‚ÄúThe actress tried to keep a low profile ‚Ä¶ wearing a New York Yankees baseball cap and a gray sweatsuit to her appointment.\nAugust has clearly been a tough month for SB. On top of her apparent health issues, August marked the one-year anniversary of her partner Bryan Randall‚Äôs death.‚Äù\nThe Blind Side Star Calls Bluff on Film\nBullock has appeared in dozens of box-office hits throughout the years. But her claim to fame was when she played the role of Leight Anne Tuohy, in The Blind Side. It landed her the only Oscar award of her illustrious career.\nThe story follows the journey of NFL defensive lineman Michael Oher, who the Tuohy Family adopted after discovering he was homeless. The movie credits Michael‚Äôs journey to the NFL largely to the Tuohy‚Äôs. But Oher recently revealed that much of the content of the movie was fabricated. And thus brought legal action against the family.\nMichael Oher ‚ÄòEmbarrassed‚Äô By Film\n‚ÄúThe lie of Michael‚Äôs adoption is one upon which Co-Conservators Leigh Anne Tuohy and Sean Tuohy have enriched themselves at the expense of their Ward, the undersigned Michael Oher,‚Äù\nthe legal filing says.\n‚ÄúMichael Oher discovered this lie to his chagrin and embarrassment in February of 2023, when he learned that the Conservatorship to which he consented on the basis that doing so would make him a member of the Tuohy family, in fact provided him no familial relationship with the Tuohys.‚Äù",

    "text": "BURLINGTON – The University of Vermont suffered a 3-0 loss against Colgate on Thursday night, marking the Catamounts’ first defeat of the season.\nFreshman Vanessa Smith made her first career start in goal and blocked five shots for UVM. Teammates Amelia Adiutori fired the only shot on goal for the hosts.\n\"We had a slow start, everything that we talked about before the game, that we wanted to execute, did not happen,\" said Head Coach Kristi Huizenga. \"It got better at halftime, but we obviously didn't take care of what we needed to do.\"\nColgate got off to a hot start, scoring in the 6th minute when Paige Foa set up Cate Childers for her first goal of the season. Maya Greenholz was also credited with an assist on the place.\nDuring the next 15 minutes Vermont’s Jill Brody unleashed two shots, while teammate Sydney Remington created a shot of her own. Luckily for Colgate, the scoring bids narrowly missed the target.\nThe Raiders doubled their lead in the 50th minute when Ari Bezanson sent a shot past multiple defenders. The ball landed in the bottom-right corner to give Colgate a two-goal cushion.\nThree minutes later Jordan Juetten made it 3-0 after being fed the ball from Ellie Stokes in front of a wide-open net. Juetten finished the job to make the Cats’ comeback attempts even more difficult.\nIn the 77th minute UVM’s Lauren DeGroot broke free and found herself all alone with just the goalkeeper to beat. But she placed her shot just high of the net, keeping Vermont off the scoreboard.\nAubrey Bough had two opportunities in the 85th and 86th minute to give the Catamounts their first goal, but both shots missed the mark as Colgate (1-2-1) closed out the shutout at Virtue Field.\nEmma Warren played all 90 minuts for the Catamounts, who fall to 1-1-2. The Cats will finish their four-game homestand against Fairleigh Dickinson University on Sunday, The matchup with FDU will serve as the Catamounts’ annual Youth Day. Children 12-and-younger will be granted free admission upon arrival while tickets last. There will be lawn games, face painting, a bounce house, arts and crafts and more activities starting at noon.\nMEN’S SOCCER\nVermont 1, UC Irvine 1\nIRVINE, Calif. – Goalie Lou Liedtka's save on a penalty kick in the 89th minute allowed the Cats to secure a 1-1 tie Thursday night at Anteater Stadium.\nVermont finished the night with a 17-15 edge in shots, with seven directed on goal. The Catamounts tallied 11 of their shots in the second half. UVM took11 corner kicks, compared to UC Irvine’s eight corners. Both teams now stand at 0-1-1.\nCatamounts star Yaniv Bazini recorded a game-high five shots in 78 minutes of action. He directed three shots on goal. Teammates David Ismail, Jeremy Tsang, and Ryan Zellefrow each had two shots.\n\"We played another excellent opponent who was very well-coached,\" Vermont coach Rob Dow said. \"Progress was made from Game 1 to Game 2. To win on the road against top opponents, we must be more relentless in our attack.\"\nLiedtka (seven saves) was tested early by a shot from Francesco Montanile that was directed toward the lower-right corner in the fourth minute. The UVM goalkeeper also denied a long-range shot from Samuel Atiye minutes later.\nVermont’s Nick Lockermann's inswinger in the 11th minute bounced around the UCI box, ending with a Niels Hartman shot that was blocked.\nMax Murray nearly scored his first goal of the season in the 24th minute when Nathan Simeon's cross found the 6-foot-5 forward sprinting toward the front of the goal. Murray's kick while in stride missed over the top of the bar as the game remained scoreless.\nUC Irvine held the edge in shots (3-2) over the remainder of the opening half. Agaton Pourshahid's shot in the 26th minute forced Liedtka to make his third and final save of the first half.\nBazini broke the scoreless tie in the 64th minute when he capitalized on a failed clearance by a UCI defender and quickly found the back of the net. The goal was his second in as many games as Vermont took a 1-0 lead.\nBazini came close to doubling the lead minutes later when he dribbled through traffic and fired a shot toward the upper right corner, but he was denied by UC Irvine goalie Alex Shields (four saves).\nMarcus Lee notched the equalizer for UC Irvine in the 80th minute when he collected a rebound in the 18-yard box, took a touch and fired a shot into the uppe-left corner. Isaac Powell was credited with an assist on the goal that made the score 1-1.\nThe Catamounts had an 18-yard scoring chance a few minutes later, but the shot toward the top shelf was turned away by Shields. The game closed with a chaotic final few minutes, beginning with a red card served to UCI's Nolan DiCenzo in the 88th minute. Less than a minute later, a Vermont foul in its own 18-yard box led to the penalty kick that was denied by Liedtka.\nVermont concludes its West Coast trip at 1o p.m. Monday with a match vs. San Diego State at Snapdragon Stadium.",

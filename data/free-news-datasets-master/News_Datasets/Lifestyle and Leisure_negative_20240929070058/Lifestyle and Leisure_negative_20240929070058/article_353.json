    "text": "Essex man’s Thai holiday night out ends in tragedy A dream holiday in Thailand turned into a nightmare for an [Essex](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fy99y2H5VS5Ryb6s7) couple when a 27 year old [British national](https://thethaiger.com/news/bangkok/missing-brit-from-bangkok-airport-boarded-flight-to-finland) from Romford was tragically [found dead](https://thethaiger.com/hot-news/crime) in a body of water after a night out. Theo Morgan, a former Met [Police](https://thethaiger.com/hot-news/crime) officer, had been enjoying a 10-day getaway in [Surat Thani](https://thethaiger.com/news/national/surat-thani-police-launch-successful-drug-rehabilitation-in-ban-klang) with his girlfriend when disaster struck. The couple had joined an organised pub crawl on the fateful night. According to Essex Coroner’s Court, Morgan’s girlfriend briefly left him to go to the bathroom. During this time, Morgan, who was known to wander off when intoxicated, disappeared. The last footage of him was captured on CCTV before he vanished. Coroner Michelle Brown reported that it’s believed Morgan hit his head, leading to a fatal fall into the water. The post-mortem confirmed the cause of death as asphyxiation due to [drowning](https://thethaiger.com/news/national/two-boys-drown-in-isaan-reservoir-searching-for-lost-motorcycle-key). “Morgan’s death was most likely due to drowning whilst under the influence of alcohol.” Theo’s family has been left reeling from the tragedy. “Theo’s accidental death has shocked everyone to their core. He was simply enjoying a night out on a holiday in Thailand.” Morgan was a man of many talents and ambitions. After earning a degree in animation, he took an unexpected career turn and served with the Metropolitan Police for four years. He had been working towards becoming an auditor with RSM, dedicating himself to his studies and future career, reported Essex Live.

    "text": "After a long day at work and dealing with traffic on the commute home, sometimes you don’t have energy to do much at all after work, but you still have to make dinner, right? It seems a lot of folks just can’t do it, as new research reveals 77% of Americans admit there are days they’re just too tired to cook a meal for themselves when they get home from work.\nAccording to the poll of 2-thousand U.S. adults:\nBelieve it or not, 20% of people have been so exhausted while trying to cook, they’ve actually fallen asleep while doing it. Half of those surveyed (51%) say they’re the busiest on weekdays, while 38% say they’re equally busy all seven days of the week and don’t get a break on the weekends. It turns out, some days are more challenging than others for making a home-cooked meal. Mondays are the hardest (35%), followed by a tie between Wednesday (29%) and Friday (29%). Just 12% of respondents “never” feel overwhelmed by their busy schedule. For the rest of those who definitely can be overwhelmed by their hectic routine, 40% realize it affects their diet and 57% of them admit it has a negative impact. When they’re in a rush, people count on their favorite convenience meals, like sandwiches (42%), fast food (37%), microwaveable dinners (33%) and ramen (29%). While 78% of those polled say eating healthy is important to them, 19% of all respondents confess to getting fast food at least once a day. A quarter (26%) of Americans admit to ordering food delivery multiple times a week and 61% of them end up regretting it because of the nutritional value. Convenience seems to be the key, as 74% say they’d be interested in eating a healthier diet if it was more convenient.

Doordash to the rescue!",

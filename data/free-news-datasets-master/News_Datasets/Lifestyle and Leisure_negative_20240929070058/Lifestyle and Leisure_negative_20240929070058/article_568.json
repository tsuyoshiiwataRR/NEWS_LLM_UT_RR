    "text": "John Cena doesn&apos;t think he will ever be \"personally ready\" to be a dad. The &apos;Blockers&apos; actor - who is married to Shay Shariatzadeh - has a lot he wants to do with his own life and admitted he doesn&apos;t see having children in his future as a result. Speaking on the &apos;Club Shay Shay&apos; podcast, he said: “I have a certain curiosity about life, and I also know the investment that it takes. “As somebody who’s driven, many times stubborn and selfish, I try to approach the world with kindness and curiosity ... but I don’t think I’m personally ready, nor will I ever be, to invest the time [needed] to be a great parent. “I want to live life for all it is. I still have a lot to do.” The 47-year-old star admitted he and Shay have had \"open conversations\" about raising a family but ultimately found themselves to be \"on the same page\". John began the \"uncomfortable\" discussions very early in their relationship. He said: \"I opened with a few uncomfortable conversations. “Those were first or second date questions with my now-wife. It’s great because we both got to lean into these uncomfortable moments, address this stuff and build a foundation.” And as a result of the intense chats so early in their romance, \"nothing is off the table\" between the couple. John said: “Nothing is too uncomfortable to be unapproachable. Starting off with a conversation about … what is the definition of our family … helped us forge a path together as a team.” The WWE star admitted in 2022 he didn&apos;t feel \"qualified\" to be a parent and doesn&apos;t have the \"passion\" for fatherhood. Appearing on &apos;The Drew Barrymore Show&apos;, he said when the host declared he&apos;d be the \"world&apos;s greatest father\" because of his philanthropic efforts and his temperament: “I think just because you might be good at something, for me, is not a strong enough reason to do that. “You have to have a passion for it. You have to have a fuel for it.”",

    "text": "Photo = Getty Images Korea. Not related to the article.\nThe human desire to pursue beauty is endless. Cosmetic surgery for aesthetic purposes is increasing every year. According to the 2023 announcement of the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS), 15.8 million cosmetic surgeries and 19.1 million non-surgical procedures were performed worldwide. This is a 5.5% increase from the previous year. The overall increase rate over the past four years is 40%.\nBut obsession with external beauty can come at a huge cost. Beyond just financial issues, it can also have lifelong consequences.\nAccording to the 2023 Procedure Statistics Report recently released by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), the most dangerous plastic surgeries were analyzed and ranked, and some plastic surgeries had a complication rate of over 90%. This is eye color change surgery, which has a complication rate of 92.3%.\nEye color alterations, including cosmetic iris transplants, laser pigment removal, and corneal pigment injections, ranked overwhelmingly first among the ten most dangerous cosmetic surgeries (with a combined score of 0.8313). Complications include vision loss, blindness, glaucoma, and uveitis (eye inflammation).\nPhoto = Getty Images Korea. Not related to the article. Some ophthalmologists warn that the surgery, which costs around 16 million won, is “like gambling with your eyesight.”\n“Any unnecessary eye surgery is a bad idea,” Dr. Colin McCannell, an ophthalmologist at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) School of Medicine, told Healthline, because of the risk of complications.\nThe second risky surgery is ‘thigh lift surgery’. This is a cosmetic surgery that removes excess fat and loose skin from the thigh area. There is a risk of blood clots, infection, and changes in skin sensation. The probability of complications is 78% (total score 0.6361).\nThe Brazilian Butt Lift (complication risk 37.94%, overall score 0.5759), which transplants fat from the stomach or sides to the buttocks, was ranked as the third most dangerous plastic surgery. This surgery, which is especially popular among young women, is notorious for complications such as fat embolism.\nNext, body lift, commonly referred to as ‘sagging skin surgery’, ranked 4th with a total score of 0.5759 (complication rate of 42%).\nThe fifth is filler treatment. The risk of complications was 64.61%. Filler treatment, known as the so-called ‘lunchtime treatment’, is a procedure in which a substance similar to skin is injected under the skin with a syringe. The recovery period is short at 1~2 days, but the frequency of complications such as allergic reactions or asymmetry is known to be worrisome.\nNext, breast reduction surgery (38% risk of complications), buttock implants (21.6% risk of complications), breast augmentation (14.4% risk of complications), arm augmentation (21% risk of complications), and mastopexy (10.4% risk of complications) were included in the top 10.\nASPS announced that it calculated the overall score by adding up the weighted scores for each surgery (procedure) and ranked the surgeries in order of risk based on this score.\nReporter Park Hae-sik, Donga.com pistols@donga.com\ngreat 0 dog I’m sad 0 dog I’m angry 0 dog I recommend it dog Hot news right now 2024-08-29 18:42:14",

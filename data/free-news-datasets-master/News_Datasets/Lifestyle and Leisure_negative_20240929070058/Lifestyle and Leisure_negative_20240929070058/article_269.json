With two outs, Joe Johnson walked and Tyler Sandoval was hit by a pitch. JJ Figueroa hit an RBI single to even it at one.\nThe game remained tied into the seventh before Washington (65-27) took the lead for good. Jalen Miller singled and Washer hit his second homer of the night, making the score 3-1.\nThat was still Windy City's deficit into the ninth, when Tyler Sandoval tried to bring the tying run to the plate with a two-out single. Sandoval, though, was thrown out trying to stretch his hit into a double, ending the game.\nZach Kirby (10-4) allowed one run in six innings and earned the win. Will Armbruester (4-8) lasted seven innings, allowing three runs on six hits in the loss. Gyeongjiu Kim pitched a scoreless frame for his 27th save.\nThe ThunderBolts close the season with a two-game weekend series against the Evansville Otters starting Friday night. Buddie Pindel (8-7, 2.12) gets the start for the Bolts against Evansville's Zach Smith () on Swiftie Night at Ozinga Field. The first 500 fans teenaged and younger get a free friendship bracelet and the game will be followed by a fireworks show. First pitch is scheduled for 6:35 and the broadcast can be found through wcthunderbolts.com.\nWindy City ThunderBolts Statistics\nâ€¢ Discuss this story on the\nFrontier League message board...\nFrontier League Stories from August 29, 2024\nThunderBolts Drop Series to Washington- Windy City ThunderBolts Boomers Survive a Nail-Biter in Home Finale- Schaumburg Boomers Byrd Rumbles to Third, Gives Crushers Late Win to Keep Pace in the West- Lake Erie Crushers Grizzlies Allow One Hit, But Lose at Lake Erie- Gateway Grizzlies Washer's Two Homers, Great Pitching Cap Regular Season Road Schedule- Washington Wild Things ValleyCats Inch Closer to Playoff Berth with Shutout Victory- Tri-City ValleyCats Y'alls Lulled to Sleep in Final Home Game- Florence Y'alls Jandron Tosses Quality Outing, Bats Fall Silent Again- Ottawa Titans Grizzlies Set for \"Greatest Night in Baseball\"- Gateway Grizzlies Tickets for ValleyCats \"Playoff Game A\" on Sale Now- Tri-City ValleyCats FL Recap- FL ThunderBolts Lose Late Lead, Fall to Washington- Windy City ThunderBolts Cristino's Multi-Hit Game Falls Short, Knockouts Drop Middle Bill- New England Knockouts Otters Can't Hold on in Game Two- Evansville Otters ValleyCats Bash Four Homers in Win Over Jackals- Tri-City ValleyCats Walk-off Keeps Boomers in Playoff Position- Schaumburg Boomers\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.",

    "text": "Hollywood star Angelina Jolie returns to the silver screen three years. She last appeared in the Marvel film Eternals, which tanked at the box office. Now, the actor has returned for an outing as the revered 20th century opera singer Maria Callas. The first reviews of Maria are already out. While Jolie's performance has garnered praise from critics, the same cannot be said for the film. The Hollywood Reporter mentioned in its review, \"Starring Angelina Jolie as revered operatic soprano Maria Callas over the final week of her life in Paris, the movie is like a glittering jewel in a glass showcase, inviting you to look but not touch. That doesn’t mean it’s uninvolving or that Jolie’s technically precise interpretation isn’t impressive. But there’s a meta collision between a star whose celebrity has long eclipsed her acting achievements, and a subject who constructed an imperious persona for herself, performing even when she wasn’t on a stage.\"Variety praised Jolie's skills and wrote, \"Jolie, for the first time in years, reminds you that she can be a deadly serious actor of commanding subtlety and power. Yet one wishes that Larran and his screenwriter, Steven Knight had found a greater vulnerability in the end-of-her-tether Maria.\" \"Jolie is an almost magical match for the real diva: achingly thin but still beautiful, loftily patrician, capriciously kind or selfish, tip-toeing dangerously close to madness. The actor’s commitment to this creation is obvious at every turn. Maria tells a fascinating story, but it lacks that rasping edge,\" wrote Deadline in a section of its review. BBC said that there is \"no urgency to Maria.\"\"Pablo Larran's fact-based drama, starring Angelina Jolie as opera diva Maria Callas, is witty and beautiful, but this Callas is an icon rather than a human being, and some scenes are less opera than soap opera. There is no urgency to Maria,\" the publication stated. Earlier, Maria had a premiere at the Venice Film Festival where it received a standing ovation for eight minutes, moving Jolie to tears. Maria will release on streaming giant Netflix. It had earlier shared a post which read, \"Starring Academy Award winner Angelina Jolie, Maria is a creative imagining and a psychological portrait of Maria Callas. The film takes place in the ’70s near the end of Callas’ life. A story about a woman that lived from the ’20s to ’70s, a woman who burned her voice, her life, by doing (what she loved) her work. From acclaimed director Pablo Larran and written by Academy Award nominee Steven Knight. Coming soon to Netflix in the US.\"Published By: Anvita SinghPublished On: Aug 30, 2024ALSO READ | Angelina Jolie to be honoured at Toronto Film Festival with tribute awardMust Watch",

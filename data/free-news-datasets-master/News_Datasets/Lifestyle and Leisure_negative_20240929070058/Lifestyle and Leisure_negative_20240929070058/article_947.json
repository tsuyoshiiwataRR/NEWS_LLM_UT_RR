    "text": "Terry's Unveils New Chocolate Orange Flavour But Fans Aren't Impressed - Terry’s launches a plain version of its iconic Chocolate Orange, leaving fans disappointed. - The new Chocolate Milk Ball will still have segments but lacks the signature orange flavour. - Fans express frustration over the flavour change, with some calling it \"pointless.\" Terry’s, the beloved chocolatier, has left fans divided with its latest release – a plain version of the iconic [Chocolate ](/tags/chocolate)Orange. Known for selling 44 million of its citrus-infused treats annually, Terry’s has now introduced a Chocolate Milk Ball that completely omits the signature orange flavour, sparking outrage among loyal customers. The new [Chocolate ](/tags/chocolate)Milk Ball will retain the familiar segmented shape but will hit shelves in October without the zesty twist that made its predecessor a favourite. Last year, Terry’s successfully expanded its range with a mint edition, which quickly became a seasonal sell-out. However, this latest innovation seems to be causing more frustration than excitement. Chocolate expert Jennifer Earle shared her thoughts with The Sun, stating, “Terry’s Chocolate Orange is a classic, so launching a version without the orange is a bit ridiculous. Fans might buy it as a novelty, but it’s likely to be a one-hit-wonder.” Fans have taken to social media to voice their disapproval, with one stating, “This is as wrong as my favourite milk chocolate adding orange flavour,” while another described the new offering as “pointless” but admitted they couldn’t resist buying one. Lorène Decam, a spokesperson for Terry’s, commented, “Launching a plain version is something most brands start with, but Terry’s will always be different. Who knew forgetting the orange could be so ballsy?” Tom Church, Co-Founder of [LatestDeals.co.uk](/), added, \"It’s a bold move by Terry’s to alter a much-loved product. While innovation is important, it’s always a risk to change a classic. Time will tell how fans truly feel.\" I love getting Terry's Chocolate for my birthdays and Christmases. I shall be requesting this one instead. How stupid and pointless Tastes like cheap nasty chocolate I love the orange one this one is awful So it's a round bar of chocolate how original lol This is absolutely great for people like me who don't like orange flavoured chocolate! I wouldnt buy It myself. I only buy the original orange because Its yummy. Not a fan of boring plain chocolate apart from Lindt which has to be orange.",

    "text": "Americans love cosmetic procedures and they’re more popular than ever, as they were 5% more performed in 2023 than in the previous year, according to a new report from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. While every nip and tuck comes with risks, some are definitely more hazardous than others, but that doesn’t seem to be stopping anyone from going under the knife.\nA new study reveals that one procedure tops them all when it comes to risk, as it comes with a 92% likelihood of complications. Eye color change surgery tops the list of the most dangerous cosmetic surgeries.\nIt involves cosmetic iris implants, laser pigment removal and keratopigmentation - which isn’t even approved by the FDA - and uses a laser to make a tunnel in the cornea to put the color pigment in. The procedure costs an average of $12-thousand and has a recovery time of between one and eight weeks. The appeal of turning their brown eyes blue has some overlooking those downsides, but experts have been warning about all the complications that it can have, including vision loss, blindness, glaucoma and eye inflammation. But eye color change surgery isn’t the only one that can be high-risk. Thigh lifts are the second most dangerous procedure, they come with a 78% chance of complications, which can include blood clots, infection and altered skin sensation. Brazilian butt lifts are third, with a 38% risk of complications including fat cells getting into the bloodstream and traveling to the lungs or brain, infection, nerve damage, swelling and scars. The Top 10 Most Dangerous Cosmetic Surgeries\nEye color change surgery - 92.3% complication rate Thigh lift - 78% complication rate Brazilian butt lift - 38% complication rate Body lift - 42% complication rate Injectable fillers - 65% complication rate Breast reduction - 38% complication rate Butt implants - 22% complication rate Breast augmentation - 14% complication rate Arm lift (brachioplasty): 21% complication rate Breast lift (mastopexy): 10% complication rate Source: NY Pos t\nPhoto: Getty\nPhoto: Juanmonino / E+ / Getty Images",

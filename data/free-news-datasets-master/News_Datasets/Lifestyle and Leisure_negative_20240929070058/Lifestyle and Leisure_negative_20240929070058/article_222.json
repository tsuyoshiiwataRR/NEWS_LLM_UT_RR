An Omar Martinez SAC fly gave the Renegades a 1-0 lead. The BlueClaws then loaded the bases in the bottom of the first but failed to score.\nMitch Neunborn wiggled out of a jam in the fourth, pitching around a pair of leadoff singles to keep the game at 1-0.\nThat remained the score into the sixth inning when Brendan Jones smashed a grand slam over the right field wall off Gunner Mayer to give Hudson Valley a 5-0 lead. It was Jones' third home run of the year and second with the Renegades.\nRenegades starter Trent Sellers threw 3.1 scoreless innings on just two hits. Yorlin Calderon (1-0) gave up three hits over 1.2 innings, striking out two. Harrison Cohen and Mason Vinyard each threw two scoreless innings to close out the win.\nNeunborn came out after five innings, allowing one run on four hits and took the loss, falling to 5-5 on the year despite a 2.01 ERA.\nEmaarion Boyd had two hits for Jersey Shore.\nThe teams continue their series on Friday night at 7:05 pm.

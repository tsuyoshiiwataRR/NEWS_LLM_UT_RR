    "text": "Locals have exposed the harsh reality of Australian ski slopes right now as unusually warm weather hits the country’s east coast.\nThe mountains are now covered in soft snow, mud and almost bare, instead of being covered in powder snow as in previous weeks.\nRecent photographs of the popular Thredbo Alpine Resort Supertrail have provided a “reality check” for holidaymakers hoping to spend another weekend in the snow.\nPhotos shared on the Facebook group ‘Snowy Mountains Uncensored’ show little to no snow with large patches of exposed ground and bushes dominating the area.\nSki and snowboard fans were devastated by the update, with many planning to venture out over the weekend after shelling out hundreds of dollars in advance for ski passes and lodging.\nMany people wonder if it is worth going down to the slopes at this time of year.\nThis comes as the country records its highest winter temperature on record while experiencing an unexpected heatwave.\nThe post quickly caught the attention of locals and tourists alike, who were disappointed that the season seemed to be ending early.\nPhotos shared on the Facebook group ‘Snowy Mountains Uncensored’ show little to no snow with large patches of exposed ground and bushes dominating the area.\n“What a joke,” wrote one.\n“It’s been a very sad season,” said another.\n“Go to Japan or don’t even bother,” warned a third. “I’m devastated, thanks for the update.”\n“It’s more or less spring now, the sun is starting to come out, the snow is melting. That’s a fact. Stop complaining,” another added bluntly.\nDespite the unusually hot weather, Thredbo Resort is still open for skiing and snowboarding.\nA Thredbo spokesperson told FEMAIL that the resort has offered incredible snow conditions over the past two months and while warmer weather and recent rain has affected the mountain, there are still a variety of lifts and trails open for guests to enjoy.\nThe purpose-built Friday Flat beginners area in Thredbo is now open and offers the ideal terrain for learning to ski or snowboard.\nThe Cruiser area also remains open, providing access to a variety of much-loved family trails including Walkabout, Ballroom and High Noon, plus Australia’s only Halfpipe, which is open for all to enjoy.\nWith possible snowfall and colder temperatures forecast for the coming weeks, Thredbo is committed to opening up as much terrain as possible if conditions allow.\nIt is not the first complaint to hit Australian ski slopes this year.\nEarlier this year, an Australian father was shocked to discover how expensive ski passes are today compared to 34 years ago.\nMichael Atkinson has been skiing all his life and visits Perisher Ski Resort in New South Wales every year.\nHe revealed how in 1990, when he was 14, an elevator ride cost him $46, but today customers are charged $249.\nThe father of two, better known as @outback_mike Online, he detailed how he used to stack shelves at Woolworths for $7 an hour and was able to save up money for a swipe after a seven-hour shift.\nNow her 15-year-old son, who makes $17 an hour, would have to work twice as hard to save enough money for a pass.\n“And it’s not inflation because I plugged it into an RBA inflation calculator and it should be $107 today – add in GST because it came in later and it should be $118,” he said in the video.\n“Adjusted for inflation, the lift pass should cost $118. It’s more than double that. It’s crazy.”\nAlthough some skiers criticized the father’s calculation, pointing out that he was comparing a child’s pass in 1990 with an adult pass in 2024.\nAt Perisher, a child pass costs between $95 and $124 if booked in advance, and up to $136 if purchased on the day. This is more in line with their calculation of GST and inflation.\nTICKET PRICES FOR PERISHER VS THREDBO SNOW MATCH: Individual\nSingle day ticket for adults (15-64):\n– maximum $249 (purchased the same day)\n– August 219-226\n– September 172\nSingle day ticket for children (5-14 years):\n– maximum $136 (purchased the same day)\n– August $120-$124\n– September $95-$124\nThredbo\nSingle day ticket for adults (22-64):\n– $209 if purchased the same day\n– $175-$199 business days\n– $188-$209 weekends\nSingle day ticket for youth (13-17)\n– $125 if purchased the same day\n– $103-$106 Business days\n– $112 weekends\nSingle day ticket for children (5-12 years)\n– $115 if purchased the same day\n– $97-$103 Business days\n– $98-$103 weekends\nHowever, Perisher considers everyone over the age of 15 to be an adult. Adult day passes cost between $172 and $226 if purchased in advance, and can go up to $249 if purchased on the day.\nThredbo day passes were cheaper overall, with teen tickets costing a maximum of $112 per day.\nMr Atkinson told FEMAIL how this expensive hobby is becoming “out of reach” for the average Australian.\n“I think this is going to lead to a greater divide between the rich and the poor,” he said.\nThe avid traveler said he will never stop skiing despite the cost and how difficult it is to pinpoint the exact cause of the price hike.\nThe disappointed father highlighted the price difference in a now-viral Instagram video that has surpassed more than 2.8 million views.",

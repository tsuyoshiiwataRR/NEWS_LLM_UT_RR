    "text": "Marian Kapphahn Marian Emilia Kapphahn passed away peacefully at her home with her family and friends by her side on Wednesday August 14, 2024 in Bemidji, MN. Memorial Services will be held at 11:00am, Tuesday, September 17, 2024 at the New Salem Lutheran Church in Turtle River, MN. Visitation will be one hour prior to the service. Interment will be at the Minnesota State Veteran’s Cemetery in Little Falls, MN under the direction of the Cease Family Funeral Home in Bemidji. Marian Emilia Larsson was born on April 11, 1937, in Fergus Falls, Minnesota to Karl Johan Emmanual Larsson and Mildred Igna Swenby, She graduated from Wahpeton (ND) High School in 1955. She went on to attend the North Dakota State School of Science and the University of North Dakota earning degrees in both Home Economics and Chemistry. Marian married Clare Elmer Kapphahn on August 10, 1963, at the First Lutheran Church in Wahpeton, North Dakota. She and Clare had three boys; Mark Alan, Ken Eric and Scott Kelly. The family lived in Benson, MN and Willmar, MN and also spent the summers at the different lake homes they built on Little Sand Lake near Park Rapids, MN. Clare and Marian moved to Bemidji in 2000 where they spent their retirement years. Marian taught Home Economics in Benson, Minnesota from 1959 - 1968. She then became a stay-at-home mother to raise her three boys. After retiring from teaching and the boys became older, she worked for Child Care and Nutrition Inc, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing services to family child care providers. She was a monitor of the food program and traveled extensively to visit in home daycares. Marian loved spending time with her family and friends. She was a wonderful interior decorator and enjoyed helping Clare design and decorate the multiple houses and cabins they built over the years. She was an avid quilter and a member of the Headwaters Quilt Guild of Bemidji. Marian loved traveling, whether quilting retreats with friends, shopping excursions, and trips with family to Alaska, Iceland, Sweden, England and visiting her Sister Nancy and Niece Laurie in Maryland. Marian is survived by her husband of 61 years, Clare, three sons; Mark Alan (Becky) Kapphahn, Ken Eric (Alan) Braun, Scott Kelly (Annie) Kapphahn and the two grandchildren she greatly adored; Katie Rebecca Kapphahn and Ryan Mark Kapphahn. A special thank you to Marian’s caregiver team and the Sanford Hospice nurses and assistants, we never could have done it without you all. Condolences may be left at ceasefuneralhome.com.",

    "text": "Debate Can Naomi Osaka overcome her emotional struggles to reclaim her spot at the top? No such thing as a dramatic ending to a player’s post-match presser, right? Well, think again. [Naomi Osaka](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/naomi-osaka/) never fails to change that. The Japanese talent has crashed out of the [US Open](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/us-open-twenty-twenty-four/), facing an early exit in the event’s second round. However, her recent string of losses elicited her to term how heartbreaking it is for her to endure such premature exits. Having returned to the Tour after her pregnancy hiatus, the former World No. 1 came high-spirited at the Flushing Meadows event.

It’s tough because I take these losses personally. This is a dramatic word.. but I feel like my heart dies every time I lose. It sucks a lot. But I’ve been trying to be more mature and learn and talk more about them.” What’s your reaction? Naomi Osaka's heartbreaking admission: \"My heart dies every time.\" React!

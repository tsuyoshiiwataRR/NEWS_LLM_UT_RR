Advertisement Several passengers were injured after a flight encountered severe turbulence , according to a Federal Aviation Administration preliminary report.\nThe United Airlines Boeing 737 was flying from Cancún to Chicago on Wednesday.\nData from Flightradar24 shows that the plane changed direction about two hours into the flight and made a loop before landing safely in Memphis, Tennessee.\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . It's the latest incident of severe turbulence in recent months, which has seen some airlines change protocols to reduce risks . Korean Air said that the number of turbulence incidents had doubled in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2019.\nAdvertisement United said in a statement to Business Insider that the seatbelt sign was on when the jet encountered the turbulence.\n\"Paramedics met the aircraft at the gate and transported one passenger to the hospital,\" it added.\nThe Memphis Fire Department told CNN that six others declined treatment.\nAccording to the FAA's preliminary report, five passengers and one cabin crew member sustained minor injuries.\nAdvertisement After diverting to Memphis, the Boeing 737 continued on to Chicago where it landed about two hours behind schedule, per data from Flightradar24.\nAn FAA spokesperson said the agency would investigate the incident.\nRelated stories\nSerious injuries due to turbulence are very rare, sustained by an average of less than 12 people a year between 2009 and 2022, per FAA data.\nThe risks have been under more scrutiny since a Singapore Airlines passenger died on board a flight in May, when dozens were injured by turbulence.\nAdvertisement The climate crisis is making severe turbulence more common and intense because the warming atmosphere speeds up jet streams and imparts more friction between air particles.\nIn a 2023 study , researchers at the University of Reading found that turbulence was getting more common over the North Atlantic. It found that over a typical point, the most severe type of clear air turbulence increased by 55% between 1979 and 2020.\nRead next\nWatch: Severe turbulence launches passengers to the ceiling of Singapore Airline flight United Airlines Aviation Airlines Advertisement Close icon Two crossed lines that form an 'X'.

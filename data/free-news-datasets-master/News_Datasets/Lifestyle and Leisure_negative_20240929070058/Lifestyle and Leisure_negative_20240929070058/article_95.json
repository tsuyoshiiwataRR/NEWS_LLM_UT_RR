    "text": "Netflix’s KAOS drops today and it looks like a steaming pile of crap, although we could be wrong about that. Who knows? Not us, because Netflix made sure not to send any screeners of this soon-to-be-masterpiece out to critics, which is never a good sign. But at least the cast looked fabulous at the premiere party! Mostly. Let’s take a closer look:\nJeff Goldblum (in Versace) and Janet McTeer\nIt almost seems redundant to point out that he’s wearing Versace because just about the most Versace any outfit can possibly be. It’s a bit of a cliche, dating back at least 30 years, but there’s no denying he looks great in it. Janet looks great in white but we don’t like the combination of textiles. Her after party footwear is hilariously fab.\nBillie Piper\nWe feel like she’s worn some version of this look a thousand times before, but like Goldblum in Versace, there’s no denying she looks great in it. That hair color is harsh as hell, though.\nKillian Scott\nIt’s a cutely low-key look and we’re impressed by the blinding immaculateness of those kicks, but he feels a bit underdressed.\nAurora Perrineau\nThose pale neutrals look great on her. We like the dress design (it’s got a classic – as in ancient Greek – feel), but we don’t like the print elements.\nMisia Butler in Amiri\nIt’s not exactly to our tastes, and the color combination is hideous, but we love that he took the risk and the overall vibe suits him well. Modern men don’t know what kind of shoes to pair with boho styles. They keep defaulting to these hard-soled boots and it looks so strange to our eyes.\nABOUT THE SERIES:\nZeus has long enjoyed his status as King of The Gods. That is until he wakes up one morning and discovers a wrinkle on his forehead. Neurosis sets in, setting him off on a dangerous, paranoid path. Zeus becomes convinced his fall is coming – and starts to see signs of it everywhere.\nZeus’ once reliable brother, Hades, God of the Underworld, is secretly losing his grip on his dark dominion. There is a backlog of dead waiting to be processed and they are growing restless. Hera (Janet McTeer), Queen of the Gods, exercises dominion on Earth — and over Zeus — in her own unique way. But her power and freedom become threatened by Zeus’ growing paranoia, and she is forced to act, while Zeus’ rebellious son, Dionysus, (Nabhaan Rizwan), is out of control and on course for a cosmic collision with his father.\nOn Earth people are aching for change, however Poseidon (Cliff Curtis), God of Sea, Storms and Earthquakes (and Horses) is more concerned with the size of his super-yacht and where the next party is at. The wellbeing of mere mortals is of little interest to him. Unfortunately for the Gods some of those mortals are beginning to realise this…\nThese mortals – Riddy (Aurora Perrineau), Orpheus (Killian Scott), Caneus (Misia Butler) and Ari (Leila Farzad) – come from different walks of life and are all cosmically connected in the battle against Zeus. Each one has a very different role to play, any one of them may be destined to bring down the Gods.\n[Photo Credit: Courtesy of Netflix, PA Images/INSTARimages – Video Credit: Netflix/YouTube]\nVenice Film Festival: Cate Blanchett in Moschino at the DISCLAIMER Photo CallNext Post:\nPlease review our\nCommunity Guidelines before posting a comment.

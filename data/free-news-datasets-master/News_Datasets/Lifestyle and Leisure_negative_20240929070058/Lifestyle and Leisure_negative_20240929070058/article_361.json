Know Side Effects Of These High-fibre Grains Millets are great for your health and have various benefits to enhance your overall health and well-being. However, the grain does not suit everyone. According to experts, if you have digestive issues, thyroid or a history of grain allergies, then it is recommended to avoid excessive consumption of millet. Read on to know a few safer methods to include millets in your diet without any side effects. Many people get digestive issues and allergies after eating millets Millets are among the most nutritious and oldest cultivated grains in the world. Today, millets are among the important cereals around and are a staple crop for humans and animals. Loaded with a variety of nutrients like niacin - important for healthy skin and organ function, along with beta-carotene - which converts to vitamin A, millets help your body fight free radicals and support your immune system. Since it is easy to digest and low in calories, the nutritious grain is also great for boosting metabolism and weight loss. It keeps your blood sugar levels in control, protects your heart, promotes anti-ageing, and even builds healthy cells. However, a millet-based diet is not for everyone.

Studies say that diets high in millet – especially in regions where they are a staple food, can contribute to various mineral deficiencies. Who should avoid eating millet?

If you also have a sensitive hut, you may experience discomfort and other gastric symptoms. To overcome this problem, it is recommended to drink plenty of water. Water helps in better digestion of millet. You can also try soaking, sprouting, or fermenting millets to make millets more digestible and avoid common digestive issues. Those with nutrient deficiencies Millets have tannins which create a problem in the absorption of other essential nutrients in the body like calcium and zinc etc. And so, here as well to reduce the antinutrient effects and enhance absorption – you must soak the grains before cooking.

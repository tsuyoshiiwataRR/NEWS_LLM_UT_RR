    "text": "Being a rookie in the NFL is not easy. NFL systems are complicated, and rookies do not have the luxury of spending an entire offseason in an NFL facility.\nRookie running backs tend to enjoy more success than other positions in the NFL because it is a much easier transition. As a result, many rookie running backs produce for fantasy. However, some running backs simply do not make the leap right away or even ever.\nSecond-year running backs\n[Bijan Robinson](/nfl/player/23189/Bijan+Robinson), [Jahmyr Gibbs](/nfl/player/23200/Jahmyr+Gibbs), [Chase Brown](/nfl/player/24374/Chase+Brown), and [De'Von Achane](/nfl/player/24179/De'Von+Achane) already enjoyed success in their first year. A few other players had high expectations but did not live up to the hype. Let's take a look at three sophomore running backs to avoid in fantasy football in 2024. fantasy football rankingsfor 2024 fantasy football drafts: Quarterback fantasy football rankings Running back fantasy football rankings Wide receiver fantasy football rankings Tight end fantasy football rankings Defense (D/ST) fantasy football rankings Fantasy football rookie rankings Best ball fantasy football rankings Superflex fantasy football rankings Dynasty fantasy football rankings IDP fantasy football rankings\n[Zach Charbonnet](/nfl/player/23173/Zach+Charbonnet) - Seattle Seahawks\nZach Charbonnet was a bit of a surprise pick by the Seahawks in the second round a year ago. The pick came after the team had drafted\n[Kenneth Walker III](/nfl/player/23214/Kenneth+Walker+III) in the second round in 2022. Walker was no slouch his rookie season and had already established himself as the Seahawks feature back.\nMany figured that Charbonnet would take over a substantial pass-catching role in 2023. He did manage to haul in 33 receptions for 209 yards but he only received 108 carries for 463 yards.\nWhile Walker finished with fewer receptions than Charbonnet, he more than doubled his carry count. Walker was also the player that the Seahawks trusted near the end zone as he finished with eight rushing touchdowns to Charbonnet's one.\nWalker figures to see a similar workload in 2024 and the Seahawks offense should be improved under a new coaching regime. New offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb deployed\n[Dillon Johnson](/nfl/player/25055/Dillon+Johnson) as a true workhorse back at the University of Washington in 2023.\nCharbonnet is a solid back with real pass-catching and pass-blocking chops. However, he is not nearly as explosive as Walker. Charbonnet may see a slight uptick in usage but do not expect a player who is going to be relevant for fantasy unless Walker goes down.\nThis is what separates him from Zach Charbonnet…\nToday’s NFL is structured around big playmaking in a pass heavy league and he fits this style.\nYou can’t tackle Walker in a phone booth and Charbonnet is stiffer than a cardboard box.\n[pic.twitter.com/NIV6lodqOH]\n— Snoog’s Dynasty Society (@FFSnoog)\n[August 14, 2024]\n[Kendre Miller](/nfl/player/24238/Kendre+Miller) - New Orleans Saints\nKendre Miller was drafted by the New Orleans Saints in the third round of the 2023 NFL Draft. With incumbent starter\n[Alvin Kamara](/nfl/player/18878/Alvin+Kamara) facing a suspension to begin the 2023 season, many thought Miller might be able to thrive in a potential feature-back role in Kamara's absence.\nThings did not exactly go as planned for Miller, who could not seem to stay healthy throughout the season. The former TCU star only played in eight games. He finished 2023 with 41 carries for 156 yards and a touchdown. Miller was far from efficient as he averaged 3.8 yards per carry.\nKendre Miller - hamstring strain suffered today. All lower body injuries. Not good.\n[pic.twitter.com/kGYi2Y9VQE] [pic.twitter.com/ZyfyFamJT6]\n— Jeff Mueller, PT, DPT (@jmthrivept)\n[July 24, 2024]\nMiller was highly productive in college. He finished his final season at TCU with 1,342 yards and 17 touchdowns. He looked like a player with serious potential to succeed in the NFL as an explosive runner.\nKamara and backup running back\n[Jamaal Williams](/nfl/player/18995/Jamaal+Williams) were both highly inefficient in 2023. Both players appeared to show their age, which should have given Miller a chance to capitalize and eat into their workloads. Both players are entering their age-29 seasons but are still listed as the Saints' No. 1 and 2 options on the depth chart.\nMiller already finds himself fighting a hamstring ailment with the regular season a mere week away. If he cannot escape the injury bug, then he will not even give himself the chance to show his talent. Expect the Saints to roll with Kamara as the clear feature back once again. Williams will likely utilize Kamara sparingly, and Miller appears poised to scoop up the leftover scraps.\n[Tank Bigsby](/nfl/player/23193/Tank+Bigsby) - Jacksonville Jaguars\nTank Bigsby was a severe disappointment in 2023. The former third-round pick was brought in to help lighten the workload on starter\n[Travis Etienne Jr.](/nfl/player/21696/Travis+Etienne+Jr.)\nBigsby would go on to receive 50 carries for 132 yards. He averaged an abysmal 2.6 yards per carry and his longest rush was 12 yards. These inefficiencies kept Bigsby off the field. More importantly, it kept Etienne on the field, which the Jaguars had stated they wanted to avoid.\nBigsby enters 2024 still listed as the Jaguars' No. 2 running back on the roster. The Jaguars did not do much to address the running back room beyond adding rookie\n[Keilan Robinson](/nfl/player/25120/Keilan+Robinson) in the fifth round. The team's lack of action could suggest that it believes in a second-year jump from Bigsby. However, it is difficult to buy the coach's speak.\n[#Jaguars]HC Doug Pederson on Tank Bigsby:\n“I think Tank has a bigger role this year, going into Year 2. It’s something that we’ve been looking at. We definitely know we gotta take a little bit off of Travis [Etienne] and keep him healthy for an entire season… I think Tank’s…\n[pic.twitter.com/7FTsctuKZo]\n— The Coachspeak Index (@CoachspeakIndex)\n[July 29, 2024]\nDownload Our Free News & Alerts Mobile App\nLike what you see?

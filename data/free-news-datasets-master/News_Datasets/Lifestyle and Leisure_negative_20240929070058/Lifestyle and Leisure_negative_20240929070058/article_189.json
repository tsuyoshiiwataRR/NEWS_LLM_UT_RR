    "text": "NEW DELHI: Two-time champion Naomi Osaka's US Open comeback came to an end on Thursday in the second round as she lost 6-3, 7-6 (7/5) to Czech Karolina Muchova, ranked 52nd.Osaka of Japan, the winner in 2018 and 2020, was unable to compete in the competition last year due to the birth of her daughter Shai. Since the Australian Open in 2022, she has not advanced to the third round of a Grand Slam, as per AFP.— usopen (@usopen) She has struggled to gain momentum in her comeback, and her victory against Jelena Ostapenko in the opening round marked her first victory over a woman ranked in the top ten in four years.Muchova was a formidable rival as well. She was a semifinalist in New York the previous year and peaked at ninth in the world before missing nine months due to wrist surgery.Osaka made a grand return to Arthur Ashe Stadium, the scene of her first Grand Slam victory in 2018 when she stunned Serena Williams. This time, Osaka arrived on court dressed in a black customized Nike outfit designed for the spotlight.She got off to a solid start, but she failed to capitalize on an early break point and made too many mistakes while Muchova applied relentless pressure at the net.The Czech went on a run of five straight games, breaking for a 4-3 lead in the opening set.With a tough hold to end the run at 1-1 in the second set, Osaka broke Muchova to take a 5-4 lead.— usopen (@usopen) However, she squandered three set opportunities in the subsequent game, allowing Muchova to take the lead again. Osaka then leveled the set with a long forehand.After Osaka made her fourth double fault to open the door, she led 4-2 in the tiebreaker. Osaka saved one of Muchova's four consecutive points to give herself two match points before the Japanese player unleashed yet another insane long forehand.",

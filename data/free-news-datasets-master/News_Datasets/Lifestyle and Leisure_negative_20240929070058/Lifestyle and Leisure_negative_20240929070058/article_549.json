    "text": "Real Madrid have not had the most impressive of starts to their league campaign, failing to outgun RCD Mallorca and Las Palmas, which has left them four points behind Barcelona after just three games. The failure of their attacking trident to gel has set alarm bells ringing at the Santiago Bernabeu.\nThat is according to Marca , who say that the club are concerned not just by the lack of goals from Kylian Mbappe, but the form of Rodrygo Goes and Vinicius Junior . They believe that the interest from Saudi Arabia in the latter has distracted him, and they do not feel he is as focused as he should be. Despite Vinicius clarifying recently in an interview that he wants to stay at Real Madrid, there is a feeling that his actions and gestures are not the same as his words.\nhttps://x.com/footballespana_/status/1829445198750925248\nCertainly it seems the temptation to point the finger might be proving a little too attractive. Los Blancos have shown flashes of quality, but the reality is that Vinicius’ form does not seem to be any poorer than that of Rodrygo or Mbappe. It is no surprise that Real Madrid are having teething problems – this was the case last season, but absence Jude Bellingham’s goals and combined with the much higher expectations in part explain the difference.",

    "text": "Leah Remini and Angelo Pagán have announced they're going their separate ways after 28 years. The Hollywood couple announced their split in a joint Instagram post Thursday, writing they were splitting \"after 28 years together and 21 years of marriage.\" \"This decision came after a lot of thought and care, and as hard as divorce is, we are approaching this with a positive outlook because we know it's what's best for us,\" they wrote. \"We are proud of how we have worked through this together.\" They continued: \"But here's the thing: we’ve been best friends for so many years. We are still celebrating holidays together, watching our favorite tv shows together, and gathering as a family.\" Leah Remini is 'screaming' over Beyoncé wax figure: 'Will take any and all comparisons' In the post, the pair called their marriage a \"success\" and said they're \"looking forward to creating even more cherished moments—just in a different way.\" \"We think a marriage that lasted this long and created so many beautiful memories, especially raising our incredible daughter, is something to celebrate,\" they wrote. In the Instagram post, they said they opened up publicly to help other couples. \"We would love for everyone to have more access to different kinds of relationship stories and not feel so isolated in navigating the changes that millions of couples make every year,\" they said. Remini is best known for her role on the long-running CBS sitcom \"The King of Queens,\" which she starred on for nine seasons alongside \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" actor Kevin James . She is also known for her outspoken criticism of Scientology in Hollywood as a former member of the church. Her work on the A&E documentary series \"Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath\" garnered two Emmy wins. Pagán is an actor and \"Kings of Queens\" guest star. Jennifer Lopez files to divorce Ben Affleck on second wedding anniversary The news comes on the heels of Remini's longtime friend Jennifer Lopez filing for divorce early last week.

    "text": "Mama June Shannon is calling out the famed Pawn Stars reality series for a damaged delivery she just received. She just spent time in Las Vegas with her family and headed to the World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop. That is where the show is filmed and June decided to make a few purchases. Unfortunately, one was delivered to her home and it did not arrive the way she had hoped. So, what is she saying about the item? Keep reading for more details and to see the unboxing video.\nMama June Calls Out Pawn Stars For Damaged Delivery Recently, Mama June, Justin Stroud, Pumpkin Efird, her boyfriend, Darrin Kitchens, and a few friends headed to Las Vegas. Fans could not believe how Pumpkin and Darrin were acting plus how he was jokingly being referred to as ‚Äústepdaddy.‚Äù While they were out there, they decided to check out some local haunts. One of them was the World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop where Pawn Stars is filmed. June made it clear she and Pumpkin were in the building with the hopes they would get special treatment.\nMama June-YouTube She found a ring she really liked as well as a crystal tree which she negotiated down to just over $1K. It had to be shipped to her in Georgia and it has finally arrived. June was so excited to unbox it that she filmed the moment as her husband, Justin gently took it out. It was wrapped up and sealed tightly, filled with so much popcorn in the box. Unfortunately, they quickly discovered different pieces, including the base, were broken off.\n@officialmamajune @Pawn Stars this is thw #crystaltree i got whike in #vegas but @UPS didnt care it was #fragile im so saf not mad at thw #pawnstars though #brokentree _ #crystal #lasvevas #famouspawnshop #upsaucks #fragilepackage #upsdontcare #adultaonly ‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Mama June\nIn the caption, she attempted to alert Pawn Stars to the issue but blamed the delivery service for not caring it was fragile. On her TikTok , Mama June‚Äôs fans immediately had some suggestions:\nThe insurance should cover it. Just take pics of the damage and file a claim. UPS will reimburse if you had insurance That was the big question if she had gotten extra insurance because if that was the case, this should and would be a non-issue. They also felt bad that this piece broke.\nRefund Waiting? Though her followers on TikTok were very supportive, over on Reddit it was believed that Mama June just wanted a refund. It was noted that June talked about the packaging and not how thrilled she was to see her new piece. Others commented on how much she paid for such a hideous piece:\nMaybe it‚Äôs just me, but it seems odd to me that the narration seemed to be fixated on the condition the item would arrive in. If I was doing an unboxing of something I wasn‚Äôt aware was broke, at least fifty percent of my narration would be talking about the piece and why I purchased it or why I was excited to receive it. Paid $1k for that junk???? üôÑüôÑ Most of the damage is at the bottom, somebody dropped that damn box. She‚Äôs blaming UPS Some are skeptical of June while others still maintain she could have given that money to Alana ‚ÄòHoney Boo Boo‚Äô Thompson. Do you think June will fix up the item while calling out Pawn Stars for a refund? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.",

She worries about him going to the dance competition as well. Megha feels optimistic about it, though. Ranjeeta feels happy for Megha and uses her words to try to cheer her up. Megha feels disappointed in her father for breaking up with him. When Megha informs Ranjeeta that she knows she is there for her and that she wants to make sure she learns the truth, the story takes an intriguing turn. She watches Arjun perform, which makes her feel happy, but then Rajveer shoots her, which makes Arjun afraid. In the next episodes, we will witness Megha come to understand Arjun's kindness. She then feels guilty for hurting him and chooses to apologize to him for her actions.

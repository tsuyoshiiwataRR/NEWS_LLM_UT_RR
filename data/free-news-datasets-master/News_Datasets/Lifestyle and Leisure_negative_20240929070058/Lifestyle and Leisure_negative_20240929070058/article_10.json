    "text": "Square Enix just announced that Final Fantasy Brave Exvius (Free) is shutting down on October 30th (this year) following its debut back in June 2016. Since launching on mobile, Final Fantasy Brave Exvius has seen many collaborations including ones with some of Square Enix’s best games like NieR: Automata and also its other titles like Final Fantasy XV . It is being shut down because Square Enix says that it will be “difficult to maintain the app experience.\" Following this announcement, in app purchases will no longer be offered but you will be able to use anything you’ve bought until service ends. Bundles will no longer be sold as well.\n[Important Notice]\nThank you for playing FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS.\nWe regret to announce we have made the difficult decision to discontinue the FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS app service as of October 30, 2024 23:59 (PDT).\nPlease see details here: https://t.co/vcL5Dn8xe4 pic.twitter.com/W6U9QArq5O\n— FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS (@FFBE_EN) August 29, 2024\nOn October 30th at 23:59 PDT, service will end and accounts will be deleted.

    "text": "Welcome back ladies and gentlemen of the internet. When it comes to having children, it's everyone's individual prerogative whether they want to or not. [No one can force them against their will, ](https://cheezburger.com/35898885)or decide for them. As a society, people like to put women in a box as being 'maternal,' expecting that due to their gender, they will automatically want to be a mother. This is so far from true. In this particular Reddit piece, the couple decides before marriage [ that they don't want children](https://cheezburger.com/35701509). The husband's sister ends up abandoning her three young children. As tragic as this is, I understand the sister-in-law for not wanting to take them in and [ commit to being a mother the rest of her lif](https://cheezburger.com/36092677)e. They help for a while, but eventually she can't do it anymore. She tells her husband she wants a divorce, or the kids are gone. Well, he doesn't handle it well, and pressures her into changing her entire life trajectory. Like what you see?

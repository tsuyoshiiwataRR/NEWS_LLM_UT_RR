    "text": "Bruce Willis' family has been left heartbroken after his health took a turn for the worse, following his aphasia diagnosis last year. The Hollywood star, known for his role in 'Die Hard', had to retire from acting in 2022 due to aphasia, the language disorder that affects communication skills.\nHis condition has since progressed to frontotemporal dementia, a more severe and specific form of the disease, causing immense distress for Bruce and his loved ones. Tallulah Willis, one of Bruce's five daughters, spoke to\nPeople about her father's condition, saying he is 'doing the same', but she often prepared to be 'open to what the visit is'.\n\"I'll go visit my dad and spend some time with him,\" she added. \"But whatever kind of day it is, my family and I meet him where he's at.\"\nFrontotemporal dementia, as described by the\nNHS, is a rare dementia type that primarily affects behaviour and language, usually diagnosed in individuals aged between 45 and 65, but can occur at any age.\nThere is currently no cure or way to slow down its progression. Neurologist Dr Nicholas Milano at\nMUSC Health Memory Disorders Clinic, previously explained: \"While everyone is different, the average life expectancy of a patient diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia is nine years from the first symptom but five years from the first diagnosis. Because usually there’s a delay in diagnosis.\n\"... Because it’s less common than Alzheimer's disease, there probably hasn’t been as much research, and there haven't been any treatments that have been shown to be beneficial.\"\nAlthough Bruce's condition has especially impaired his\nuse of language, Tallulah last year shared her gratitude that his physical mobility hadn't been affected. In a Vogue piece, she said: \"I keep flipping between the present and the past when I talk about Bruce: he is, he was, he is, he was.\n\"That’s because I have hopes for my father that I’m so reluctant to let go of. I’ve always recognized elements of his personality in me, and I just know that we’d be such good friends if only there were more time.\"\nWhat do you think? Let us know in the comment section below",

    "text": "3 weeks ago\nI have a new 2nd Gen indoor wired Nest Camera, however, it does not come out of night vision mode. I have reset that device, cleaned the lens, and Google support even replaced the device a few weeks ago, however, the problems persist, each day I have to go into the Home app and toggle Night Vision mode from Auto to off and then back to Auto, if I leave the setting to off, it become grainy and unfocused. The room is very dark with the blinds closed and I would think as soon as I open those blind and the light comes in that night vision would turn itself off, but it is not doing that... Are there any newer firmware REV's available? Please advise\n2 weeks ago\n***Important update to this Post*** After going home last night and thinking more about the location of this camera, high in the corner of the room (the dark corner that does not get direct light from the window) I started to turn on / off the over head light and once that light was turned on with the window blinds open, I could hear a clicking toggling itself (night vision lights coming off and on) with the switching of the overhead lights off and on. So while night vision works in extreme lighted and no lighted environments, it must be the dark corner and the ambient light sensor not detecting enough light or darkness to make this work as designed. I would move the camera but it is the only logical place to put it to see what needs to be seen. Google Please advise.. thanks JTRnR\n2 weeks ago\nAt this point I have not received any help regarding Night Vision, the problems persist, sometimes I work around it by toggling the Night Vision setting from Auto to Off and back to Auto and the the Night Vision goes off in a 1 window room, meaning it a bit dark in the corner where the camera is, but the the view shows light in the room. And BTW the contrast on this new Gen 2 Nest Wired Camera is too bright.. Anyway to adjust that?\n2 weeks ago\nHi there!\nThanks for posting here in the community. I'm sorry the Night Vision mode doesn't come out. Help's here!\nI'd like to ask a question:\nLet's try the following:\nKeep me posted.\nBest regards,\nMelany\n2 weeks ago\nI don't mind sharing a photo of the rooms and lighting, but don't have permissions in this forum to upload, it reported that error when I tried. Regardless, I move the new 2nd Gen Camera into a very well lite room (Entryway) downstairs and still the camara stays in night vision mode as of 7:30am this morning, Sunrise was 6:54am all curtains in the rooms were open, no direct sunlight, just a problem 2nd Gen camera with faulty firmware still in black and white night vision mode.. I trust this will be investigated and fixed in the months to come I hope... this device has already been reset, replaced and moved around our home to demonstrate that the sensor that controls this is not set or working properly.\n2 weeks ago\nBy 8:30 AM the \"Entryway Camera\" did come out of night vision mode, that is the new Gen 2 Wired camera, so it works, just not as expected. And the 1st gen camera that was working great in this entryway before I moved the 2nd gen downstairs is upstairs now in the spare bedroom and office is still in night vision mode, this is a one window room and both camera and the light face the same way, meaning the are side by side facing the same direction, and now this camera does not come out of night vision mode, so in the end I would say that these cameras night vision does work, but not at expected. I will be on the look out for some sort of firmware rev on the Gen 2 camera in the future.. \"that all I got to say about that!\" mic drop... I am out!\n2 weeks ago\nHi\n[@JTRocknRossi](/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/46243),\nThanks for the information.\nMy team would like to learn more about this behavior.

I appreciate you taking the time to fill it out. Our team will reach out to you via email to further assist you.\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\nBest regards,\nMelany\na week ago\nThe new Nest Gen 2 camera was moved out of a 1 windows dark cornered room, and into the main living space and now it does go in and out of Night Vision mode with out user intervention. However, the gen 1 Camera that was moved into that room now does the same thing in that corner, this legitimately does not not look like an issue other than that ambient light sensor might need some tweaking. No other action is needed on my part, the Nest/Google Home network is awesome and works as designed.\na week ago\nHi there!\nWe appreciate the information you have provided. We are glad to know that your Nest cameras are working correctly.\nPlease do not hesitate to contact us if you need assistance.\nBest regards,\nMelany\n39m ago\nJumping through all the google \"Hoops\" or suggestions work temporarily, there is a much bigger problem here that google needs to address by updating, fixing, changing the behavior of the IR night vision mode sensor, it is just stuck in night vision mode, its been fully light for that last hour, blinds are all open in our main living area and BLAM still stuck in night vision mode, and yes I can toggle the setting off and back on and it comes out but this is not a solution, just a small band-aid and honestly I am very disappointed that Google has not come out with some kind of Firmware REV or permanent Fix, this is the last time I buy something just released and new from your company. That explains why everyone single one of these Nest next gen 2 wired indoor camera's were on sales for as low as $69 in some places. Very disappointed customer! BTW the camera after writing this did come out of Night vision mode but it took an 90 minutes after I opened up all the blinds and it was past 8 AM in the morning",

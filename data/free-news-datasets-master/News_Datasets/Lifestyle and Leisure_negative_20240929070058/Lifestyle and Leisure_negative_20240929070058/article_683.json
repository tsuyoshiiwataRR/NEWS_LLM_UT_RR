    "text": "A new report by World Population Review has ranked Morocco as the eighth most dangerous country for solo female travelers in 2024. The report reveals that 45% of Moroccan women experience physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner, the highest rate among the countries surveyed. Additionally, 32% of Moroccan women believe that violence against women is justified under certain circumstances, placing Morocco tenth in this category. The country also ranks tenth for legal discrimination against women. These findings are consistent with recent data from the Higher Planning Commission (HCP), which shows that 57% of Moroccan women have experienced violence. Most of this violence occurs in marital and family settings (52.1%), followed by educational (18.9%) and professional environments (15.4%). Violence in public spaces is less common, at 12.6%. South Africa is identified as the most dangerous country for female solo travelers, followed by Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Iran, the Dominican Republic, Morocco, India, and Thailand. In contrast, Spain, Singapore, Ireland, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Portugal, Croatia, Canada, and Poland are ranked as the safest countries for women. The study, conducted by journalists Asher and Lyric Fergusson, assessed the 50 most popular tourist destinations based on factors such as street safety, homicide rates, sexual violence, legal discrimination, and general attitudes towards violence against women. The report also notes the tragic case of two tourists murdered in Imlil in late 2018, highlighting the risks faced by solo female travelers in Morocco.",

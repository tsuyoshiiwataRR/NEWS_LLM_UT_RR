    "text": "Hi Forest1607 and welcome to the Macmillan Community but so sorry to hear about your mum's diagnosis and prognosis.\nA cancer diagnosis like this in the family can be such a challenging and stressful time but getting support from others who are dealing with the ‘exact same' support challenges can help you a lot.\nThis New to Community area is like our reception desk where we try to direct you to the best part of the Community for you to get support. The Community is actually divided into dedicated Support Groups (Discussion Rooms) and when it comes to the practical and emotional challenges of supporting your mum and indeed yourself you may benefit from joining and posting in our\nCarers only\nand our\nSupporting someone with incurable cancer\n……. support groups where you will connect with a wide range of members navigating the exact same support challenges.\nTo connect with a group click on the “ Bold Italic Links ” I have created above …… then once the group page opens click in the [Black - Click to Join - Banner] that appears at the bottom of the page and this will then confirm that you have joined the group.\nWhen you are ready……. you can introduce yourself by putting up your very own post by clicking [+ Create new post] or [+] in the top right of the group page.\nYou can copy and paste the text from this post into your new post.\nIt is an emotional time supporting family so you might find this Macmillan information your feelings when someone has cancer helpful as well as this link getting help with your emotions .\nYou may find it helpful to call the Macmillan Support Line open 8am-8pm (timings may differ across services) 7 days a week on 0808 808 00 00. This service provides cancer information, practical information, emotional support, benefits/financial guidance or just a listening ear.\nTalking to people face to face can be very helpful so do check to see if you have any Local Macmillan Support i n your area, do also check for a local Maggie's Centre as these folks are amazing and support all the family.\nPlease do get back to me if you need further help navigating the community ((hugs))",

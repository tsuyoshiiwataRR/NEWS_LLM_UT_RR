    "text": "NEW DELHI: Former champion Carlos Alcaraz's Grand Slam winning streak ended abruptly at the U.S. Open on Thursday, as the Spaniard was defeated 6-1 7-5 6-4 by unseeded Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp in the second round. Alcaraz, who had won titles at the French Open and Wimbledon, was unable to overcome a shaky start and unforced errors.Alcaraz's 15-match winning run at major tournaments was halted by Van de Zandschulp, who took control early. The Dutchman claimed the opening three games with strong defensive plays from the back of the court and broke Alcaraz again in the sixth game, securing the first set.Alcaraz tried to fight back in the second set, delivering a remarkable forehand pass to hold serve in the first game. However, his struggles with closing out points allowed Van de Zandschulp to break for a 2-1 lead. Alcaraz made a tactical change by returning serve from a deeper position, which helped him break back immediately, but a double fault handed his opponent another break. Van de Zandschulp then comfortably doubled his advantage.The third set saw Alcaraz briefly leave the court, only to return and face further difficulties. A wayward forehand gave Van de Zandschulp another break. Though Alcaraz responded quickly and seemed to regain some composure, world number 74 Van de Zandschulp stayed focused and completed the upset on serve.\\\"Actually I am a little bit lost for words. It's been an incredible evening here,\\\" said Van de Zandschulp. \\\"I think from point one here today I believed (I had) a chance.\\\"I had some nerves but I think if you want to beat one of these guys you have to be unbelievably calm and keep your head there.\\\"",

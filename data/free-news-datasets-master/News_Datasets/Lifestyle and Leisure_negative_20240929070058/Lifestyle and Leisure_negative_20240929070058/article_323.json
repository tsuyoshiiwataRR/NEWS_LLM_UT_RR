    "text": "Hi. I am having a major device-breaking issue with my iPad Pro which is rendering me unable to use certain applications that I commonly use on my device. Every time I load certain full screen applications, my iPad Pro crashes and restarts after a period of time, typically a few seconds to a few minutes.\nDevice: iPad Pro, 11-inch, 2nd generation, 128GB & Wi-Fi only model ( iPad Pro 11-inch (2nd generation) - Technical Specifications - Apple Support )\niPad OS Version: 17.6.1\nSteps I did that led up to this issue:\nI recently updated from an older version of iPadOS to version 17. After updating my device, I noticed that loading & using many full screen applications for a period of time would cause my device's wallpaper to disappear and turn black on both the home screen and lock screen. Restarting my device would restore my wallpaper. This issue most commonly occurred with full screen apps like games, such as Genshin Impact or Honkai: Star Rail, but I've also had this issue with art applications like Procreate. I decided to change my device's wallpaper to see if it would fix the issue of my wallpaper disappearing. This seems to have made the issue worse. Now when I load those same full screen applications that previously caused my wallpaper to disappear after a period of time, my device instead crashes and restarts after a short period of time, typically a few seconds to a few minutes.\nNotes:\nReducing the graphics settings in Honkai: Star Rail and Genshin Impact from High to Low seems to reduce the frequency of my device crashing and restarting. As said though, it doesn't fix the issue, simply reduces its frequency. I don't know for sure if the wallpaper issue is related or entirely a coincidence, but I find it weird that the initial strange behaviour with full screen apps messed with my device's wallpaper and then the crashes began the moment I changed my device's wallpaper.\nThis issue has rendered me entirely unable to use most full screen applications on my device and has effectively rendered my iPad unusable to me as I originally bought this device with doing both professional art production and being able to play mobile games in mind. I can't do either if my device crashes repeatedly when I try to do said tasks on it.\nAny help would be extremely appreciated.",

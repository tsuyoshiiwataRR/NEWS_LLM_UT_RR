The night I went was a $2 fireball shot night, however they were calculating the tip for our bill as if the shots were $8 each.\nI love pins, but this, their mandatory processing fee, and no allowance of cash is making it hard to justify buying drinks there regularly.\"\n10 \"Just In Case You Were Thinking Of Tipping Less...

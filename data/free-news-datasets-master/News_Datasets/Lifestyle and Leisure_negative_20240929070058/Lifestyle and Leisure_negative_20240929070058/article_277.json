    "text": "CAMDEN — Priscilla Bourne Wood, 86, died Aug. 23, 2024.\nPriscilla was born on Sept. 19, 1937, in West Hartford, Conn., where she lived with her parents Roland and Emma (Nelson) Bourne, until she married Barton W. Wood on Sept. 7, 1957.\nCAMDEN — Priscilla Bourne Wood, 86, died Aug. 23, 2024.\nPriscilla was born on Sept. 19, 1937, in West Hartford, Conn., where she lived with her parents Roland and Emma (Nelson) Bourne, until she married Barton W. Wood on Sept. 7, 1957.\nBart and Pris raised their three children in Wallingford, Penn., a suburb of Philadelphia. For 33 years, Bart and Pris lived in Camden, first on Lily Pond Drive and then at Quarry Hill.\nAlmost immediately after arriving in Camden, Priscilla began volunteering at the Penobscot Regional Chamber of Commerce. She was awarded “Volunteer with the most years of service,” several years ago. Priscilla was also very active volunteering at Merryspring Nature Center. Pris helped with the kitchen tours, the craft sales and with weekly weeding in the gardens on Wednesday mornings.\nPriscilla had a great love of books, and she volunteered for 20 years at the Furness Free Library in Wallingford, Penn. She also worked at the New Leaf Bookstore in Media, Penn. Once she arrived in Camden, she worked at the Rockport Public Library. A few years ago, the library had a retirement party for Priscilla, and then asked her to come back on Wednesday nights! Pris also was very involved in the annual book sale for the library, which she ran for several years. She very much enjoyed sorting donated books with her friends on Tuesday and Friday mornings.\nBarton and Priscilla were married for 64 years until he passed away on Oct. 12, 2021.\nPriscilla is survived by her daughter Julie and her husband Geoff Coleman (Pittsburgh, Penn.); her son Jeff and his wife Mary (West Grove Penn.); and her son Jamie and his wife Dana (Ashburn, Va.). Pris is also survived by her grandchildren, Katie and her partner Joe, Andy and his wife Michelle, Jena, Kari, Jonathan and Christopher and his fiancée Alaina. Priscilla also is survived by her great-granddaughters, Sophia and Lily.\nA family gathering will be held at a later date. If you wish, donations in Priscilla’s name can be made to the Rockport Public Library or to Merryspring Nature Center. Priscilla will be remembered for her warm, friendly smile. She loved to laugh!\n“If you have a garden and a library, you have everything you need.” — Cicero.\nSuccess! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup.\nError!

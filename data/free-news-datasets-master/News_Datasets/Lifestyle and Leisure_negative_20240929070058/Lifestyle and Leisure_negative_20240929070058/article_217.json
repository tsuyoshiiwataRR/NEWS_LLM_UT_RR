    "text": "Following her split from Ben Affleck , Jennifer Lopez is no longer comfortable living in the mansion she once shared with him.\nLopez and Affleck tied the knot in July 2022 and purchased the $60.8 million Beverly Hills mansion the following May. They resided there with Lopez’s 16-year-old twins, Max and Emme , and Affleck’s three children, Violet , 18, Seraphina , 15, and Samuel , 12.\nRumors of the couple’s divorce started in May 2024, and Affleck moved out of the mansion and into a $20.5 Los Angeles home shortly after.\nNow, Lopez reportedy doesn’t feel right living in the house alone.\nThe home is listed on Zillow for $68 million. The 38,000-square-foot estate features 12 bedrooms and 24 bathrooms. It has a zero-edge pool, a gym, a boxing ring, basketball and pickleball courts and a caretaker house. The driveway can accommodate 80 vehicles, in addition to the 12-car garage attached to the house.\nLopez officially filed for divorce from the actor on April 26 and requested to drop Affleck’s last name in July.\nEarlier this week, Affleck was spotted on a date with Robert F.

[Amazing match...VdZ could come out of this bracket to the quarters.](#post1)CincyDem 50 min ago #1 [He played badly; VDZ played great](#post2)tishaLA 36 min ago #2 [He crapped out early in Cincy too](#post3)CincyDem 22 min ago #3 [Yeah he said that was the worst match](#post4)tishaLA 12 min ago #4 (6,798 posts) [CincyDem](/?com=profile&uid=287285) [Sibelius Fan (Original post)](#op) I saw Draper play a few weeks ago here in town and I dont think he beats VdZ. And the other two guys left in the quarter are bothe on their career downswing. Clearly a lightening bolt match. VdZ and Carlos may never see another one like it. But VdZ record winning the first two sets goes to 6-0 and Carlos have never won a 5 setter so I guess the odds played out. (14,237 posts) [tishaLA](/?com=profile&uid=128781) [Sibelius Fan (Original post)](#op) I kept expecting him to turn into Carlos, but it was obviously a subpar night for him. Shame because he brings so much excitement. (6,798 posts) [CincyDem](/?com=profile&uid=287285) [tishaLA (Reply #2)](#post2) Monfils beat him with an assist from the weather that suspended the match overnight. Gael was dead on his feet when they suspended. He came back the next afternoon stringer and Carlos never hit his stride. (14,237 posts) [tishaLA](/?com=profile&uid=128781) [CincyDem (Reply #3)](#post3) He'd ever played. Obviously hyperbole, but I think the Roland Garros-Wimbledon-Olympics stretch wore on him mentally and physically. He's still so young.",

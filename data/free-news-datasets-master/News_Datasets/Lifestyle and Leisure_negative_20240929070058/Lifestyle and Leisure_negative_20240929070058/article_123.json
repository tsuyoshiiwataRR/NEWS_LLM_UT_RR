    "text": "A Woman Made Sourdough on a Flight. How Gross Is that, Exactly? A recent video of a woman making sourdough bread on a plane left us wondering if that method would yield a good loaf of bread. Another day, another absurd meal being prepared on an airplane. We've already seen [shrimp and grits](https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/passenger-cooked-shrimp-airplane-bathroom-sink-tiktok-video) prepared in an airplane bathroom sink, and while it really cannot get much worse than that, it can get weirder. In a two-part Instagram post, baker Maria Baradell shared the process of creating Sourdough bread dough during her flight to Spain, hashtagging the video \"#milehighsourdoughclub.\" To me, the most unbelievable part of this is that she managed to film and knead [in an economy seat](https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/us-airlines-most-legroom-economy-seats-ranking). But for others, there were more extreme and horrified reactions. People called her rude, gross, and inconsiderate. \"As a flight attendant I'm gonna say: E ,\" one Instagrammer commented. \"On the last flight, some unhygienic passenger clipped his toe nails on that table and another one puked on it. Needless to say that the armrest you're touching is where some dudes' unwashed hands from the lavatory were as wellâ€¦ Now there's you, kneading and folding sourdough. Enjoy your germ-bread.\" Thanks to this video, there is a question that must be answered: Is Baradell making germ-bread? I consulted with Gregorio Fierro, a Master Instructor for [Scuola Italiana Pizzaioli](https://scuolaitalianapizzaioli.it/). He is an international pizza- and bread-making authority and was intrigued by my weird question. \"It's an interesting question,\" Fierro said. \"The generation of a sourdough starter is largely dependent on whatever random strains of yeasts happen to be floating around in the atmosphere. Those living things are always searching for organic matter to feast upon and help that organic matter to decompose. All of these fermented products stem from nature's desire to reclaim organic matter.\" Under other circumstances, that would be a phenomenally poetic way to think about making sourdough. But as I reflect on the comment from the flight attendant, Baradell's bread is starting to sound more like a loaf of nightmares. Fierro says that even though the air is filtered on a plane, it's probably not filtered enough to remove all airborne germs on an airplane. \"The atmosphere on a plane, despite being filtered, is still being influenced by all of the living creatures on the plane (us!) and therefore should conceivably be capable of inoculating the flour/water mixture,\" Fierro said. \"The variables would be: how aggressively the plane's ventilation system scrubs the air, how large and how many people are actually on the plane and how old the plane is.\" Fortunately, Baradell is not going to try to make another germ-bread creation. In the second part of her plane baking video, she wrote in the caption, \"#milehighsourdoughclub won't be a thing. I was trying to be creative after I saw another creator making pasta in-flight, but thanks to your comments I learned this was not a great idea.\" Unfortunately, however, she did eat the sourdough after baking it upon her arrival in Barcelona. \"We had this bread for dinner the following day and it was great!\" To be fair, it looked like perfectly normal bread. But after hearing Fierro's breakdown, I can't help but wonder what odd plane germs were baked into the loaf.

Jennifer Mistry, who played the role of Mrs. Roshan, wrote, \"Om shanti. Please tc.\" Ambika Ranjankar, who played the character of Komal Hathi, also commented, \"Om shanti.\" Fans praised Shailesh Lodha for his portrayal of the iconic Taarak Mehta. The actor left the program in 2022. Fans were disappointed to hear that the actor was leaving the program. Media portals stated that Shailesh was extremely hurt by producer Asit Modi's uncultured behavior. \"Asit Kumarr Modi spoke to me in a very uncultured, derogatory tone. Which I couldn’t tolerate. Mujhe bardaasht nahi hua (I could not tolerate); this was not the first time. At that time, he had said, “Yahan par sab kaam karne waale mere naukar hai. (Everyone working here is my servant.) That time also, I’d objected to him and his language,\" had shared Shailesh.

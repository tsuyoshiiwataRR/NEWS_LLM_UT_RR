    "text": "The Rays dropped the series finale to Seattle, and fell one game below .500, thanks in part to a send off homerun for his former club by Randy Arozarena. The former Rays All-Star had a cold start to the first half of the season, performing at a league average 98 wRC+ and missing out on a consecutive All-Star season despite finishing second in the Home Run Derby last year in an historic performance. And that power has back on display in the final run scored in this game: Randy has a 157 wRC+ in the second half of the season, and was picked up by a Seattle club that is now one game above .500 and just three games back from Houston in the AL West. Winning this series against Seattle was fairly necessary for the Rays to dream of the Post Season this year, as there had been four teams in the hunt for the final Wild Card slot in the playoffs entering the week, but two losses now puts the Rays six games back, while eliminating their head-to-head record against Seattle. The Rays are now entering a week of baseball that will see the Padres (who are currently playoff bound) and Twins (who lead the race for that final playoff spot) come to town. It might get ugly! If you’re looking for any positives, here are a couple. Junior Caminero hit his first career triple... Dylan Carlson had an In Play Run(s) moment... And Josh Lowe hit an emphatic homerun that is most notable for its heart... A very positive development for Josh Lowe’s mom, Wendy Lowe who is battling brain cancer:— Tricia Whitaker (@TriciaWhitaker) The doctor told her that her tumor is decreasing in size. Just interviewed Josh after the loss. He was in the midst of a tough stretch at the plate but recently he has felt better.… [August 28, 2024] Josh Lowe, who had a strong series in Seattle, shared positive news about his mom’s battle with brain cancer. She recently had a good doctor’s visit, which Josh said puts things into perspective, showing there are bigger and more important things in life than baseball.— Bally Sports Sun: Rays (@BallyRays) [pic.twitter.com/ptmeYVvgts] [August 28, 2024]",

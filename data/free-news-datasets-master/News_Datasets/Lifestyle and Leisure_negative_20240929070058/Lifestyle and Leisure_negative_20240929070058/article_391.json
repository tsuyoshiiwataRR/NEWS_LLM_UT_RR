    "text": "Square Enix has decided to shut down the mobile turn-based RPG Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius after eight years of maintenance. The game was released in 2016 and immediately gained popularity among users, since then receiving a large number of major updates and collaborations. However, on October 30, 2024, the global versionâ€™s servers will be shut down forever.\nAs the developers explained, they always strived to provide players with an incredible and enjoyable gaming experience, but ultimately came to the conclusion that it would be difficult for them to continue to support the game. The team apologized for this decision and thanked them for their support.\nIt is worth noting that Square Enix currently supports two more free games in the Final Fantasy universe, such as War of the Visions Final Fantasy Brave Exvius and Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis. The developers have also released nine parts of the main series on mobile devices, of which the first six have been officially translated into Russian.",

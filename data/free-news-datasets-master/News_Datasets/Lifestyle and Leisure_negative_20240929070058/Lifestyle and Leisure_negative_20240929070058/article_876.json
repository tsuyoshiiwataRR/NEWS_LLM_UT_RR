    "text": "Although Rick and Morty ’s spinoff was blamed for breaking a major rule of the original show, the series itself already got away with breaking this same infamous rule earlier. Rick and Morty: The Anime was released in August 2024 and the Rick and Morty spinoff earned a dispiriting reception. Rick and Morty: The Anime’s failure could be chalked up to the differences between the anime adaptation’s sense of humor and the original show’s unique comedy style. However, it didn’t help that Rick and Morty: The Anime also wasn’t a traditional spinoff in terms of its premise and main characters. While its first episode didn’t pick up where Rick and Morty season 7’s ending left off, Rick and Morty: The Anime does share the same main characters as the original show. Most successful spinoffs, from Frasier to Young Sheldon, take a character or two from the original show and transplant them into a new setting. In contrast, Rick and Morty: The Anime features Rick, Morty, Jerry, Beth, and Summer as its heroes. This similarity made the show too similar to its predecessor to feel original, but too tonally different to feel like an organic offshoot of Rick and Morty.

Rick and Morty: The Anime Isn’t Rick and Morty’s First Time Travel Plot The Series Famously Refused To Do Time Travel Stories But Season 4 Features One Although some critics noted that Rick and Morty: The Anime’s first episode broke one of the original show’s cardinal rules, this particular criticism is not quite fair. Rick and Morty featured a time travel storyline before Rick and Morty: The Anime’s first episode, despite its creators and Rick claiming the show would never engage with the infamously convoluted sci-fi staple. In season 4, episode 5, “Rattlestar Ricklactica,” Rick and Morty were forced to resort to time travel to stop sentient snakes from taking over the galaxy and rewriting history. This absurd plot proves Rick and Morty occasionally includes time travel. Rick and Morty ’s co-creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland both claimed the series wouldn’t explore time travel. Rick and Morty’s co-creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland both claimed the series wouldn’t explore time travel, since the sci-fi story staple had been historically overused in the genre. As such, Rick and Morty: The Anime beginning with an exploration of the theme seemed to prove the disparity between the two shows. However, it is only fair to note that Rick and Morty itself also played fast and loose with this rule. Many classic episodes of Rick and Morty work precisely because they play with the show’s usual formula, and “Rattlestar Ricklactica” is no different in this regard. Why Rick and Morty: The Anime’s Time Travel Story Was Less Successful Rick and Morty’s Spinoff Failed To Recapture The Original Show’s Tone “Rattlestar Ricklactica” embraces the silliness and inherent contradictions of time travel stories, never taking itself too seriously and using most of the episode’s story to point out the problems with other time travel plots. In contrast, Rick and Morty: The Anime’s time travel plot was a more straightforward example of the sci-fi subgenre. This goes some way to explaining why Rick and Morty’s spinoff failed to replicate the original show’s critical success. Rick and Morty might break its own rules from time to time, but the show still knows how to hold onto a consistent, unique tone despite this.

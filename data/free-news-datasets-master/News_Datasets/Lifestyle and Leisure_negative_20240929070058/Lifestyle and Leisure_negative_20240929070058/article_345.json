    "text": "A popular Plymouth restaurant has been closed for major building work after being damaged by this year&apos;s torrential rain. The successful The Early Bird eatery on Mutley Plain has had to replace the floor of its basement and kitchen after water poured in.\nThe eatery closed on August 10 and will be shut until at least early September. The problem contributed to the outlet having its food hygiene score downgraded from four, the second highest available, to two following an inspection in late July.\nThe inspector highlighted issues with the cleanliness and condition of facilities and the building and said it needed improving. The business’ other outlet, in Mayflower Street in the city centre , has a top-rating of five and is trading well, having recently staged an Abba disco-themed bottomless brunch during the August bank holiday.\nREAD NEXT\nPlymouth firm &apos;restructures&apos; but leaves £8.5m of debts unpaid\nPlymouth pays top consultants to give city an image makeover\nDebbie and Rob Stander, who run The Early Bird restaurants and bakeries with daughters Hannah and Beth, said they were “extremely disappointed” to learn the Mutley outlet had been downgraded. They said they had immediately taken action with building work well underway and a general upgrade coming too.\nThe couple said: “As a family business, we - like the other incredible independents in our city - pour our heart and soul into our restaurants. We understand how this (the food hygiene rating) can have a huge detrimental effect on a business and hope that our customers understand that we are working closely with EHOs (environmental health officers) to bring Mutley back up to the high standard it has been over the past five years.”\nThey added: “Unfortunately, due to the age of our Mutley Plain premises, we have had some ongoing issues with the flooring in the basement of the building, which has been made worse by water ingress after heavy rains over time and in turn has had an impact on the fabric of the building. The last 12 months has been a frustrating time for us, as we have been back and forth with our landlords and insurance companies to get improvements on the building completed to the high standards we adhere to.\n“After our recent inspection with EHOs, although a very disappointing rating, it has enabled us to put pressure on the right parties to move forward with the necessary building repairs. We made the difficult decision to close our doors for the first time since lockdown to ensure any issues were rectified immediately.”\nThey said EHOs have been very supportive of the improvements and alterations to the building that are being carried out. They told PlymouthLive: “We are very confident that after these building works have been completed, we will be able to achieve a five star rating the same as we hold at our Mayflower Street branch.\n“We are pleased to say that works are well under way - we now have a new concrete floor and vinyl flooring in the basement as well as improved wall coverings and wash up area. A spruce up for Mutley is also on the cards with a new lick of paint and new outside seating.\n“We look forward to welcoming back our loyal Mutley customers and we are doing everything in our power to ensure the smooth re-opening in the first few days of September… with some exciting changes.”\nThe Early Bird opened in Mutley Plain in 2019 and was such a hit it added a second branch , in Mayflower Street in 2022. Between the two outlets more than 40 jobs have been created.\nClick here to join PlymouthLive on WhatsApp and we&apos;ll send breaking news and top stories directly to your phone.

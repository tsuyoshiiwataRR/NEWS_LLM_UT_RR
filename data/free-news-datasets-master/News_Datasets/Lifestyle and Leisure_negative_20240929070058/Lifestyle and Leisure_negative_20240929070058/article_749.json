    "text": "She was the founding mastermind behind provocative lingerie chain Honey Birdette, but after selling the brand in 2021, Eloise Monaghan says she is “devastated” that her life’s work has been destroyed.\nDespite pocketing $66 million from the $443 million sale to PLBY, the leisure and entertainment company behind Playboy magazine, the outspoken businesswoman says the downfall of her former brand has been like a death.\n“It’s been devastating to watch,” she told Daily Mail Australia.\n‘I built the brand on female empowerment – it wasn’t about fake boobs or fake asses, that’s all it is now.’\nThe US-based company bought Honey Birdette in 2021, with the 48-year-old former founder staying on as creative director of the brand she had honed for more than a decade. Within eight months, however, everything fell apart.\n“I came into an industry that wasn’t ready for women’s clothing or anything ridiculously empowering,” she said.\n“I felt like I was wearing a muzzle, so I just stopped.”\nAfter his release, his life took a 180-degree turn. He quietly divorced his ex-wife Natalie, lives full-time in Los Angeles and is in love with Australian designer and photographer Rebecca Collinson-Smith.\nEloise Monaghan is the mastermind behind Honey Birdette, the edgy Brisbane-based company she founded in 2006 after visiting her first adult toy store while shopping for a hen party.\nHoney Birdette is no longer about female empowerment, says founder Eloise Monoghan\nThe couple have since joined forces in love and business, expanding Collinson-Smith’s swim and resort brand, Hunting Hue, into the U.S. market.\n“We were friends before we were together,” says Collinson-Smith, 37.\n“Now I can’t imagine doing this without her. We challenge each other but we’re good partners because we listen to each other.”\nDriven by a passion to empower women, Eloise’s journey with Hunting Hue represents more than just a business venture, but redefining the industry.\n“Having witnessed numerous takeovers, including my own, by male corporate figures who don’t understand the essence of female empowerment brands, I feel driven to preserve our message at Hunting Hue,” Monoghan said.\n‘We proudly operate as a fully female-owned and operated company and intend to remain that way. I am thrilled to re-enter the retail space and partner with my life and business partner.’\nIn June, the couple captivated the American fashion industry with their latest show at Paraiso’s Miami Swim Week, ushering in a new era in swimwear: a canvas for artistic expression, a testament to love and a commitment to timeless allure.\nThe swimwear collection featured stunning aerial images of Sydney’s famous beaches.\nTo capture stunning images, Collinson-Smith hired a helicopter and photographed iconic Sydney landmarks including the Harbour Bridge, Bondi Beach and the Opera House from 500 feet up.\nLooking ahead, the brand is preparing for a major expansion into the U.S. market in 2025, with plans to establish a physical presence in Los Angeles, New York, Miami and Texas.\nRebecca Collinson-Smith (pictured left) and her partner in business and love Eloise Monoghan (right)\nCouples resortwear brand Hunting Hue was a hit at Paraiso’s Miami Swim Week last month.\n“Having witnessed numerous takeovers, including my own, by male corporate figures who don’t understand the essence of female empowerment brands, I feel motivated to preserve our message at Hunting Hue,” said Eloise Monoghan.\nHunting Hue proudly operates as a fully female-owned and operated business.\n“Americans love anything ‘made in Australia’, so it’s a really exciting time for the brand to have a strong presence in the US market,” Collinson-Smith said.\nWhile its store at The Rocks will remain an iconic shopping destination loved by tourists who love Australia, its culture and iconic landmarks such as the Opera House and Bondi Beach.\nAway from fashion, the couple say they hope to continue travelling the world before settling down and have recently taken steps to expand their family.\n“We are currently considering IVF and could ultimately live in Greece,” Monaghan said.\n“We love the States, but our families are in Australia, so it’s important for us to get back home, although we certainly see ourselves travelling and continuing to be inspired,” Collinson-Smith added.",

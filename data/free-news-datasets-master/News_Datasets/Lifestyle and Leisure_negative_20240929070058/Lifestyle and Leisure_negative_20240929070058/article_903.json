    "text": "By now, it’s common knowledge that non-organic cow’s milk is one of the worst choices you can buy at the store due to the excess hormones, antibiotics, steroids, pesticides, and who knows what else it all contains. The food industry has tried to mislead us into believing that organic cow’s milk (and its products) comes with pure innocence and is made from cows that graze gracefully and happily in fields all day with the cleanest of air, water, fresh grass, and more. Regardless that almost none of this is true, cow’s milk is still one of the worst health food choices you can make for many reasons, no matter what kind of cows it comes from. The main reason is how it affects your hormones.\nAll cows that produce milk are pregnant, organically raised, fed, etc., or not. It makes no difference that their milk doesn’t have added hormones considering that alone, cow’s milk contains over 60 different hormones without anything being added to it . Now, while all of us have different hormone situations going on, there is no logical research that says we need to take in added hormones from another mammal.\nWhy Ditching Dairy is Important for Your Hormones: Cows are pregnant nearly 300 days of the year and Harvard Health shares that the more times a cow has been pregnant during that year, the more hormones she produces through her milk every time. Cows were not made to stay pregnant 300 days of the year and they develop infections due to this high demand for production, not to mention may be subject to further disease and bacteria when antibiotics aren’t used (such as in organic farming practices).\nSo, what about a cow’s hormones so detrimental to our health?\nHere are some things to consider:\n1. Insulin Issues One of the primary reasons dairy is linked to acne is that it raises insulin in the body. All dairy contains IG1, or insulin-growth factor. It raises our levels of insulin, which causes blood sugar swings that lead to acne. Acne is strongly influenced by hormonal changes, which is one reason so many teenagers struggle during puberty. Why would we put ourselves through that any more than necessary? No matter what kind of dairy you choose, you’re taking in excess insulin growth-like factor. Sadly, it’s promoted as a healthy option for bodybuilders looking to bulk up, but over time, it’s not a healthy choice and will likely cause insulin problems that lead to overeating, sugar cravings, and poor blood sugar control.\n2. Mood Swings Dairy also contains hormones that can lead to mood swings. Estrogen and testosterone are our sex hormones, and when they get out of balance according to our bodies’ needs, we suffer mood swings as a result. Dairy milk promotes excess estrogen in the body due to it containing estrogen from female cows. At the same time, milk naturally contains androgenic properties , so it raises testosterone in the body and can cause bulking quickly. It’s chock-full of all these hormones we don’t need scurrying throughout our bodies. Think about it this way: the dairy you consume contains hormones from the female cow and the male cow that were used during impregnation. That doesn’t sound so healthy or appetizing, now, does it?\nDairy milk accounts for about 80 percent of estrogen consumed through the human diet, along with the fact that milk from pregnant cows (which is how all milk products are produced) contains about 33 times as much estrogen as milk from non-pregnant cows.\nMood swings inarguably happen due to swift hormone fluctuations and women aren’t the only ones to suffer. Men can too, which is one reason dairy isn’t a healthy choice for anyone looking to have a healthier, happy, and more stable mood. How about some tastier, much healthier mood foods instead, all hormone-free?\n3. Cancer-Causing The jury is in: milk causes cancer in any form, organic or not. Check this out: Harvard Health studies show that dairy milk and cheese products led to testicular cancer in men ages 20-39 and have been found to affect breast, colon, and prostate cancer heavily as well. And then there’s the casein protein found in milk that has also been linked to cancer . Even without hormones or even lactose, casein is a detrimental protein to our health and should be avoided however possible.\nHelp Your Hormones: Ditch Dairy Sadly, the food industry would have you believe you need to consume milk to be healthy, but we know that’s not the case. Quit believing the lies about cow’s milk and have some other calcium-rich options instead , all free of these scary hormones.\nIf you need a dairy replacement, look to these milk-free alternatives. So Delicious Dairy Free Coconutmilk Creamer is an amazing alternative. This Milkadamia Unsweetened Milk is a great choice. Good Karma Flaxmilk is a new way to enjoy grain milk. And this Silk Soy Milk Vanilla is a must-have.\nLooking for other reasons to ditch dairy?

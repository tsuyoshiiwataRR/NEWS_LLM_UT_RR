    "text": "My husband, who agreed to work with me doing this, gives me a hard time every week by being late. We need to be there after business hours at 5:30 p.m. so we don’t interrupt anyone while they’re working. I have to remind my husband EVERY Wednesday that we need to be AT THE JOB. It causes fights. He makes his own hours at his other job. He can work whenever he wants and leave when it’s done. I was raised to believe, “If you’re early, you’re on time. If you’re on time, then you’re late.” His attitude is, “Why worry about when we show up?” I’m angry that he doesn’t respect how important this job is to me. I’m his boss when it comes to this jobsite. How can I handle this? I’m so done. I can’t lose this job, and I can’t do it by myself! It’s HIPAA-protected, so not just anyone can do this with me. -- TIMED OUT IN THE MIDWEST DEAR TIMED OUT: How important is it that you start promptly at 5:30? Could all the work get done if you started at 6? I know you are a stickler for promptness, but who set the hours? You and your husband might fight less often if you become more flexible. However, if the problem persists, remind him that the extra income helps to pay important bills. If that doesn’t motivate him, stop fighting, contact the friend who gave you the job and ask if she has any suggestions about someone who could do what your husband has been doing. I wish you luck.

    "text": "The Unhealthiest Foods You Can Order From Panda Express Authentic Chinese food can be quite healthy, according to Lillian Cheung, editorial director of the Nutrition Source at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/traditional-chinese-diets-a-template-for-healthy-eating-habits). \"Many staple foods, such as vegetables, tofu, and seafood, are all linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease,\" she said. \"So are the unsaturated oils (such as canola, soy, or peanut oil) frequently used to prepare Chinese dishes.\" However, [Panda Express](https://www.pandaexpress.com/our-food-philosophy) isn't traditional Chinese food. According to the chain itself, \"Our flavors are a combination of Chinese roots with an American taste.\" And, as Deanna Ting points out on [Resy](https://blog.resy.com/2021/01/chinese-american-food-is-its-own-great-cuisine-time-to-love-it-that-way/), American Chinese cuisine is \"'Frankenstein' food: an unholy mashup of all things sticky, sweet, deep-fried, and doused in MSG, jammed into a takeout container.\" That's not to say that everything is bad, however. There are [healthier options to order at Panda Express](https://www.healthdigest.com/1117754/healthier-options-to-order-at-panda-express/). But, there are also certain menu items that you'll want to steer clear of. To learn more, we asked Angel Luk, a Registered Dietitian and Nutritionist who is a co-founder of the websites [Food Mysteries](https://foodmysteries.com) and [Ask the Sports Nutrition Dietitian](https://sportsnutritiondietitian.com) as well as the author of \" [You Can't Out-Train a Bad Diet](https://www.amazon.com/YOU-CANT-OUT-TRAIN-BAD-DIET-ebook/dp/B01NA99A9A/ref=sr_1_2?crid=VQEU392L5QS0&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ffg-GveAKujwJwAoWG3ZAHTZG_JLVwBnmEE4JI1gcyqauyohyxN55iq7ZjwDmdFLJhtpWulBoADYIDzcHbK2iOjUbV2sURtqz6NGGZ29dVfdkppBqweigN8qIt04wKkYqj195lWmHlGFQ-5-Oi14xg.LVKEcx6xmtKHh_TvSLu4XCE8VXai8yUE45nuEPiVIS4&dib_tag=se&keywords=you%20can't%20out-train%20a%20bad%20diet&qid=1724783418&sprefix=you%20can't%20out-train%20a%20bad%20diet,aps,477&sr=8-2&tag=staticmedia-healthdigest-20),\" just what the unhealthiest foods are that you can order from Panda Express. Orange Chicken If you're a fan of Panda Express, then you're probably not too surprised that their Orange Chicken took the number one spot on [The Daily Meal](https://www.thedailymeal.com/1503256/ultimate-ranking-panda-express-items/)'s ranking of Panda Express' best menu items. Ever since chef Andy Kao invented it in 1987, it's been a best-seller for the chain, which sold 115 pounds of the dish — about one-third of all sales — in the year 2021 alone (per [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/panda-express-orange-chicken-changed-game-american-chinese-food-35-yea-rcna38016)). Despite its popularity, however, Luk says it's not one of their healthiest offerings. \"While the chicken is a lean protein that is lower in saturated fat (when the skin is removed), it appears to be battered, then fried to create a crispy texture,\" she noted, \"which ironically reintroduces saturated and potentially trans fat into the dish.\" And it's not just the fat that makes this dish problematic. \"The generous amount of sweet and spicy orange sauce provides a significant amount of added sugar, which the World Health Organization recommends we (adults and kids) limit to less than 5% of our daily calories,\" said Luk. Cream Cheese Rangoons After ordering their main dish at Panda Express, many people like to toss in a few Cream Cheese Rangoons to round out the meal. However, Luk said Panda Express' Cream Cheese Rangoons are also less than healthy, and, again, it's about their fat and sugar content. \"The wonton wrappers provide carbohydrate,\" she said, \"but after being deep fried, it's loaded with added fats and packs a heavy caloric punch without much [nutrient density](https://www.healthdigest.com/1397805/most-unexpected-nutrient-dense-food-watercress/). The cream cheese filling is a source of more added fat, while providing little in terms of protein and anything else.\" Luk added that the sweet and sour sauce that it's dipped in is really just added sugar. \"Put together, this appetizer is loaded with refined carbs and added fats, deficient in vitamins, minerals, protein, and fiber, and is a poor choice for people managing their weight,\" she said. White Steamed Rice Given Luk's previous concerns about foods that are high in fat and sugar, it probably makes sense that opting for steamed white rice would be a safe choice for a side dish. However, it's really about which sides have more nutrition to offer, she said. \"In a nutshell, all the other side dishes have vegetables, which offer more fiber, vitamins, and minerals,\" said Luk. Additionally, she pointed out that the white rice served at Panda Express appears to be jasmine rice, which is high on [the glycemic index](https://www.healthdigest.com/416386/what-is-the-glycemic-index/), a scale that ranks how foods affect our blood sugar. \"High GI foods should be chosen least often by people living with diabetes, prediabetes, and heart health issues,\" said Luk. For a more nutritious side dish, consider [Panda Express](https://www.pandaexpress.com/nutritioninformation)' Super Greens. A single 90-calorie serving has only 3 grams of total fat and 4 grams of sugar.",

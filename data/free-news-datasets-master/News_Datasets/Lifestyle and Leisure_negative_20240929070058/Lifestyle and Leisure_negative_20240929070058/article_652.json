    "text": "Why cutting down screen time feels impossible—and how to change that As screens become more embedded in our daily lives, cutting back on usage is challenging, yet essential for better mental and physical health Screens have become an integral part of our daily lives, making it increasingly challenging to cut back on screen time. From smartphones to laptops, TVs to tablets, screens are everywhere, serving multiple functions—communication, entertainment, work, and education. Understanding why it’s difficult to reduce screen time and learning effective strategies to manage it can significantly enhance our well-being. One major reason cutting back on screen time is challenging is the sheer convenience and versatility that screens offer. They provide instant access to information, entertainment, and social interaction. Whether it’s binge-watching a favourite show, scrolling through social media, or playing online games, screens are designed to capture and hold our attention. [According to ExpressVPN’s survey](https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/digital-minimalism-generational-insights/) on limiting tech for mental health, 61% of the respondents find smartphones the hardest to cut back on, highlighting their high engagement and dependency levels. The rise of remote work and online learning, accelerated by the pandemic, has further blurred the lines between work and personal time, leading to increased screen exposure. Many people find themselves spending their entire day in front of a screen. More specifically, 27% of Millennials and Gen Z struggle with this issue due to work requirements, which compounds the challenge of reducing screen time. The psychological and physical impact Excessive screen time is linked to various psychological and physical health issues. Prolonged use can lead to eye strain, poor posture, and disrupted sleep patterns. Psychologically, constant screen use, especially on social media, is associated with anxiety, depression, and decreased well-being. The ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) plays a significant role here. Over 40% of Gen Z and 34% of [Millennials](https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/129205/public_service_chief_urges_heads_to_understand_gen_z_employees_in_fast_changing_world) say FOMO keeps them glued to their screens, highlighting the mental toll of constant digital engagement. These negative impacts are often gradual and not immediately apparent, making it hard to recognise the need to cut back until the damage is done. By the time we realise the problem, screen-dependent habits are deeply ingrained. Strategies for cutting back Despite the challenges, reducing screen time is feasible with a few mindful strategies: Set Clear Boundaries Designate specific times for screen use and stick to them. For instance, screens should be avoided an hour before bed to improve sleep quality. 46% of Gen Z are actively taking measures to limit their screen time, showcasing the effectiveness of setting boundaries. Use technology to your advantage Many devices and apps offer screen time tracking features. Set daily or weekly limits and adhere to them. Although 40% of Gen Z and 32% of Millennials struggle with motivation, these tools can provide structure and help enforce limits. Prioritise face-to-face interaction Engage in more in-person activities, such as having meals with family, outdoor activities, or hobbies that don’t involve screens. 43% of Millennials are cutting back on screen time to connect more with loved ones, underlining the value of face-to-face interactions. Take breaks Incorporate short breaks throughout the day to step away from screens. Even a five-minute walk or quick stretching can make a difference. Digital detox Plan regular breaks from screens, whether for a few hours, a day, or a weekend. 45% of Gen Z and 39% of Millennials are reducing screen time to improve their mental well-being, supporting the benefits of digital detoxes. Replace screen time with other activities Engage in activities such as reading, starting a new hobby, or physical exercise. 43% of Gen Z and 38% of Millennials find fewer digital interruptions help them focus better and get more done. Conclusion Cutting back on screen time is challenging but achievable. By understanding the reasons behind our screen dependence and implementing practical strategies, we can manage our screen usage better, leading to a healthier, more balanced life. Remember, the goal is not to eliminate screens but to use them in a way that enhances rather than diminishes our well-being.",

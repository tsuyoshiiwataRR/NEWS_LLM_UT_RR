    "text": "Bats Score Early But Fall Short 10-6 to Indians\nAugust 29, 2024 -\nInternational League (IL) Louisville Bats News Release\nDespite both early and late scoring bursts, the Louisville Bats lost their fourth game against the Indianapolis Indians with a final score of 10-6 on Thursday night at Victory Field. The loss extends the Bats' losing streak to a season-high 11 games.\nFollowing a 45-minute rain delay, Louisville got off to a quick start. Jacob Hurtubise and Blake Dunn knocked back-to-back doubles against Indians starter Thomas Harrington (W, 3-1) to kick off the top of the first. A sacrifice fly from Levi Jordan put the Bats on the board, and an RBI single from David Wendzel strengthened an early Louisville lead at 2-0.\nIndianapolis fought back, taking advantage of a two-run homer in both the first and second innings from Jack Suwiniski and Matt Gorski respectively. The Indians rally doubled Louisville's score, putting Indianapolis ahead 4-2.\nIn the top of the third, the Bats combined a leadoff walk to Dunn, a base hit single from Jordan, and a double from Wendzel to even up the tally at 4-4.\nThe Indians reclaimed the lead in the bottom half of the frame thanks to a couple of walks and singles, racking the score up to 6-4. Following several quiet innings, Indianapolis launched into another scoring burst, driving in four more runs and setting the Bats at a 10-4 disadvantage going into the final innings of the game.\nLouisville rallied in the top of the eighth, starting with a leadoff walk to Edwin Ríos. Wendzel then doubled and P.J. Higgins brough in a run on an RBI groundout, cutting the Indians' lead in half and making it 10-5.\nIvan Johnson smacked a 351-foot home run in the top of the ninth, but Louisville ultimately dropped their fourth game in a row against Indianapolis with a final score of 10-6.\nBats starter Connor Overton tossed 2.2 innings, allowing four runs on four hits with two strikeouts. Coming on in the third, Patrick Weigel (L, 0-1) gave up two earned runs and claimed the loss, his first of the season. Wendzel ended the night three for four with three RBIs, and Levi Jordan also went two-for-three with an RBI.\nThe Bats (57-71, 19-35 second half) and Indians (63-63, 30-23 second half) will play the next game in the series tomorrow, Friday, August 30. With the first pitch at Victory Field set for 7:05 p.m., Nick Curran will be on the call for 1450/96.1 WXVW.\nLouisville Bats Statistics\n• Discuss this story on the\nInternational League message board...\nInternational League Stories from August 29, 2024\nBats Score Early But Fall Short 10-6 to Indians- Louisville Bats Seven-Run 10th Inning Sinks Jacksonville in 12-7 Loss to Norfolk- Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp Bats Score Early but Fall Short 10-6 to Indians- Louisville Bats Basallo Hits First Triple-A Homer In Extra Innings Win- Norfolk Tides I-Cubs Blown out in Weather-Shortened Contest- Iowa Cubs Gorski Slugs Indians to Record-Setting 10th Consecutive Win at Victory Field- Indianapolis Indians Stripers' Comeback Bid Falls Short Once Again in 5-4 Loss to Columbus- Gwinnett Stripers Rain Rests Redbirds' Rout of Rivals- Memphis Redbirds Knights Drop Thursday's Game to Sounds, 5-1- Charlotte Knights WooSox' Bats Held Dormant in 4-2 Loss to Toledo- Worcester Red Sox White, Collins Help Sounds Conquer Knights- Nashville Sounds Syracuse Pummels Lehigh Valley, 13-6, on Thursday Night- Syracuse Mets Kody Clemens Goes Deep as IronPigs Drop Second Straight to Mets- Lehigh Valley IronPigs Hens Rally Late to Claim 4-2 Victory Over Red Sox at Polar Park- Toledo Mud Hens Seymour Leads Durham to Fourth Straight- Durham Bulls Red Wings, RailRiders Postponed Thursday Night- Rochester Red Wings RailRiders and Red Wings Game Postponed- Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders August 29th Omaha Storm Chasers Game Postponed- Omaha Storm Chasers Saints and Storm Chasers Rained Out, Doubleheader Friday- St. Paul Saints August 29 Game Notes: Iowa Cubs vs. Memphis Redbirds- Iowa Cubs Trivino Scheduled to Rehab with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre- Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders Nastrini Promoted to White Sox on Thursday- Charlotte Knights SWB Game Notes - August 29- Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders Rochester Red Wings Game Notes - August 29 at Scranton/WB- Rochester Red Wings Kornberg to Broadcast Seven Additional Marlins Regular Season Games- Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp Sounds Host Braves, Cardinals Affiliates in Final Homestand of Season- Nashville Sounds Storm Chasers Drop Second Straight to St. Paul- Omaha Storm Chasers Late Offensive Charge Fizzles Out in 7-6 Loss to Columbus- Gwinnett Stripers\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.",

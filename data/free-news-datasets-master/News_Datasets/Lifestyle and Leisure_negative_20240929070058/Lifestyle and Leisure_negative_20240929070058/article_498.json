The Gallagher brothers announced they would be reuniting for a series of gigs in the UK and Ireland, reports the [Daily Express](https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1942129/oasis-fans-urgent-ticket-deadline-warning). With fans desperate to get their hands on tickets, [BBC Breakfast](https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/all-about/bbc) aired a segment advising them how best to do so. Business correspondent Ben Boulos warned Oasis fans it \"won't be a simple process\".

So even then there’s no guarantee of getting a ticket!” Ben went on to chat to two Oasis superfans who have seen the band 50 times between them – and one is already planning on attending two dates of the 2025 tour. And in a cheeky exchange with hosts Charlie Stayt and Naga Munchetty, Ben made it clear he’s had “quite enough” of their antics.

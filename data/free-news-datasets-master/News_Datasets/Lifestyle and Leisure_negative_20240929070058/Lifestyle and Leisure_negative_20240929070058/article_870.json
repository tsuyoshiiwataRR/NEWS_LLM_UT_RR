    "text": "This guy never learns his lessons. He had a cheap Testarossa before. After that stint, he swore he would never do it again. But that was six years ago when he bought the cheapest Testarossa in the US with the insurance money that he got after another of his cars burned down to the ground. Back then, Tyler Hoove, because he is the one we are dealing with, paid $85,000 for the car, but a month later, due to some title issues, the selling dealer had to buy it back. The A five-speed manual transmission gearbox put the power down through the rear wheels. Those were enough for an acceleration from 0 to 62 mph (0 to 100 kph) in 5.8 seconds and a top speed of 180 mph (290 kph). Back then, the Testarossa hit the market ready to battle the The model was a magnet for VIPs. Celebrities such as It was its popularity that kept it in production from 1984 until 1991. During that time, 9,939 examples rolled off the production line in Maranello, Italy. The figures made it one of the most mass-produced Ferraris of all time. Right now, a 40-year-old It is a 1989 model year, which is far from being a low-mileage example since it was used as a daily driver by the previous owner. The odometer reads 42,000 miles (67,592 kilometers). That is one of the factors that surely affected the final price. Its collectability is already ruined, so Tyler won't have to worry about that. Tyler notes that it looks perfect from 15 or 20 feet back. It has never been in a serious accident, there is no salvage title attached to it. There are issues on board the car as well. The leather covering the dashboard has started to shrink. The material on the top of the instrument cluster has been stapled so it would not start running forward. So, Tyler will also need to reupholster that area. The tires on this Ferrari should probably be about 20 or 30 years old, so the car really needs new ones. The car sat for years before being purchased. It had its clutch replaced some 2,000 or 3,000 miles ago, in 2013. The previous owner made sure the engine ran, so he paid $18,000 to get it running again. The front brakes were also redone.

Tyler will have to ask for help from a restoration shop to fix his Testarossa. The good news is that the car will not split in two. The Wizard also notices some leaks. He can fix those, but not the corrosion part. The [Ferrari Testarossa](https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/ferrari-testarossa-1984.html#aeng_ferrari-testarossa-1984-49-b12)shot to fame in a heartbeat back in 1984, when it was unveiled at the Paris Motor Show as the successor of the Berlinetta Boxer. The rear-mid-engined model was powered by Ferrari's 4.9-liter Tipo F112 flat-12 engine, which pumped out 385 horsepower (390 metric horsepower) and 333 pound-feet (451 Newton meters) of torque. A five-speed manual transmission gearbox put the power down through the rear wheels. Those were enough for an acceleration from 0 to 62 mph (0 to 100 kph) in 5.8 seconds and a top speed of 180 mph (290 kph). Back then, the Testarossa hit the market ready to battle the [Lamborghini Countach](https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/lamborghini-countach-lp-400-1973.html#aeng_lamborghini-countach-lp-400-1973-39-v12), which already had a lead of a decade. The new owner of the 1989 Testarossa, Tyler, also owns a Countach. The model was a magnet for VIPs. Celebrities such as [Michael Jordan](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/michael-jordan-once-gave-scottie-pippen-his-own-ferrari-for-christmas-199518.html), Mike Tyson, Elton John, and Alain Delon just had to have one. Besides, Enzo Ferrari knew exactly how to advertise the model. He gifted Don Johnson, the star of the Miami Vice series, a brand-new silver 1989 Testarossa. Executive producer Michael Mann also had one, but his sports car was painted in blue metallic, while a white one featured in the series. It was its popularity that kept it in production from 1984 until 1991. During that time, 9,939 examples rolled off the production line in Maranello, Italy. The figures made it one of the most mass-produced Ferraris of all time. Right now, a 40-year-old [Testarossa](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/a-short-history-of-one-of-the-most-popular-ferraris-of-all-time-the-testarossa-152616.html)would hit the used car market for an average price of around $148,000. However, Tyler Hoover of Hoovies Garage brags about buying a super cheap Testarossa. He paid $70,000 for the car. But is it really worth it? It is a 1989 model year, which is far from being a low-mileage example since it was used as a daily driver by the previous owner. The odometer reads 42,000 miles (67,592 kilometers). That is one of the factors that surely affected the final price. Its collectability is already ruined, so Tyler won't have to worry about that. Tyler notes that it looks perfect from 15 or 20 feet back. It has never been in a serious accident, there is no salvage title attached to it. The model still seems to have the original paint, which displays chips and dents on the front end, fenders, doors, and just about everywhere else. There are issues on board the car as well. The leather covering the dashboard has started to shrink. The material on the top of the instrument cluster has been stapled so it would not start running forward. So, Tyler will also need to reupholster that area. The tires on this Ferrari should probably be about 20 or 30 years old, so the car really needs new ones.

There is the sophisticated and somehow pointless seat belt system on board. The old Panasonic radio still works, but the AC doesn't. Meanwhile, the center console is covered in buttons and switches, something that you don't see in cars of today anymore. The park lights are in that center console, the pop-up headlights controls are on the left, and the fog lights are up in the headliner panel. There is also a button that opens the glove box compartment door, which contains a huge mirror. Hoover takes the car to David Long aka Car Wizard of Omega Auto Clinic to take a look at it. He is the one who has recently purchased a [superb 1963 Cadillac Coupe deVille](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/mechanic-buys-superb-1963-cadillac-coupe-deville-wife-says-it-s-ok-238917.html)from Missouri that his wife labeled as \"ok\" before she really showed enthusiasm. What worries the Car Wizard the most is the corrosion that is eating up the frame and floor. That is also one of the main reasons the Ferrari was so cheap. Tyler will have to ask for help from a restoration shop to fix his Testarossa. The good news is that the car will not split in two. The Wizard also notices some leaks.

    "text": "It used to be an affordable staple of a family day out. But any parent who's stood in front of an ice cream van or stall this summer will probably have been taken aback by 2024 prices.But one ice cream van in particular has drawn criticism from families who claim they can't afford the 'shocking' prices. A price list for the van, based at a popular family park, was shared on Facebook as a warning to other parents to 'steer clear with the kids'.The list shows prices started at £3.95 for a basic 99 cone, rising to £5.95 for a Knickerbocker Sunday and £6.95 for a King Cone, prompting hundreds of people to criticise the seller for the 'unbelievable' prices, MEN reports.\"We saw many kids crying the other day because their mum just couldn't afford it,\" said one local resident of the Mr Whippy van in Wythenshawe Park in Manchester. \"Everyone is out to make a profit but this is taking the p**s.\"Another person commented: \"I understand they have a fee to pay for that spot and need to cover that, but these are like festival prices and not even worth it.\"A third person added: \"How are families supposed to go on cheap days out with these prices? Daylight robbery! He should be ashamed of himself.\"One customer claimed there was no price list when they visited the van, which is parked next to the children's playground, and were shocked when the bill came to £11.25 for two ice creams.Manchester City Council said it was 'engaging with the operator' of the Royal Ices van and 'addressing concerns' that have been raised. And when a joournalist from the MEN went to visit the van, they noticed prices had dropped, with two standard waffle cone 99s now costing £7.The classic 99 had been cut to £3.25, or a mere £2.75 without a Flake, while the Knickerbocker Sunday was down considerably to £3.95 and the King Cone had dropped to £6.A Manchester council spokesperson commented: \"Affordability is a key strand of our assessment process for the procurement of partners.Through the contracting process we will work with operators to make sure their prices are fair and affordable for our residents.\"A Manchester council spokesperson commented: \"Affordability is a key strand of our assessment process for the procurement of partners.

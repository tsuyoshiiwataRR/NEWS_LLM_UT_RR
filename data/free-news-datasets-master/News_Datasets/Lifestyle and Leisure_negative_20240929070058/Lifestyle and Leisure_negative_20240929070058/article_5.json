    "text": "Ireland goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher gave strong hints that he was keen to end his enduring status as Liverpool's back-up keeper in this summer’s transfer window, but it appears that ambition may not lead to the move he was hoping for. According to widespread reports, Liverpool have rejected a second Nottingham Forest bid for the Cork man, believed to have been £15m (€17.6m), and have now suggested a cash deal and player swap, including another ‘keeper, Matt Turner. However, Liverpool deemed the package well below their expectations with just a day left before the transfer window closes. Kelleher was linked with a move to Celtic after Joe Hart retired at the end of last season, but that move always appeared to be unlikely given the finances involved. Staying in the Premier League looked to be more realistic, but Kelleher’s options appear to have dried up with the transfer deadline set to close on Friday at 11pm. Forest have already signed a goalkeeper this window, adding Carlos Miguel from Corinthians. Bournemouth have also been linked with a move for Kelleher in recent weeks, but they have confirmed the arrival of Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga on loan until the end of the season. Kepa spent last season on loan at Real Madrid and became available for a move away from Stamford Bridge after being told he was not in new manager Enzo Maresca’s first-team plans for the current campaign. The Spain international, who is the world’s most expensive keeper following his £71million move to Stamford Bridge from Athletic Bilbao in 2018, has signed a one-year contract extension with the Blues. Southampton was another club rumoured to be weighing up a move for Kelleher, but they are set to wrap up a loan move for Arsenal keeper Aaron Ramsdale. Wolves are also believed to be looking for a keeper, but there would have to be a lot of late movement in the transfer market for Kelleher to get a move now. That will be good news for Liverpool boss Arne Slot, who with Kelleher one of the best reserve keepers in the Premier League as he backs up No.1 pick Alisson Becker. The truth may be that Kelleher is a victim of his own success at Liverpool, as loan moves for goalkeeper are a cheaper option for rival Premier League clubs than trying to seal a deal for a player who would be valued in excess of £20million.",

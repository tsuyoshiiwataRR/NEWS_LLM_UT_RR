    "text": "For some, Dragon Ball GT appears to be a fun story that emerged out of the minds of Toei Animation staff. But many are in disagreement, especially the fans in Japan. However, the characters from the series did quite well in the video game adaptations of the game.\nThe black sheep of the Dragon Ball family is likely to see its characters making it to the upcoming Bandai Namco game. That‚Äôs because its predecessor had them too, and several other video game adaptations of the series had featured them before.\nGT Characters Might Not be a Fan Favorite for the Upcoming Game at All ‚õ∂ ‚õ∂ ‚õ∂ ‚õ∂ ‚õ∂ √ó After witnessing a recent conversation regarding inclusion of GT characters in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero , it seems like some fans aren‚Äôt really into characters from the anime-exclusive series.\nIn one recent community debate on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the poster asked if they wanted to see GT characters or the original anime‚Äôs.\nLet‚Äôs debate: Who should be more of a priority to be in Sparking Zero?\nOG Dragon Ball or GT pic.twitter.com/fA3CR1JvrH\n‚Äî JJ üòà (@KingJordan_57) August 18, 2024 Expand Tweet The answer to that was pretty clear, as these Dragon Ball fans came together emphasizing the original series.\nGT was terrible until the end, it had no character development at all and super Saiyan 4 was over hyped lol\n‚Äî Kyle McCoy (@KyleMcC58703479) August 22, 2024 Expand Tweet While the original series is definitely something to consider, GT does have its charm that‚Äôll make fans love it.\nNot GT Fans Want to See Characters from the Original Dragon Ball Dragon Ball GT wasn‚Äôt as popular in Japan as in the USA. Credits: Bandai Namco If not GT , these fans were seen showering their love for the characters from the original series.\nEven if I played GT Characters more back then it‚Äôs still OG DB. That is a CRUCIAL part of dragon ball. Without DB, there is no DBZ and DBS and people don‚Äôt get ts cuz most people haven‚Äôt watched the original(hell I‚Äôm watching it rn).\nThey honestly need to push OG db way more\n‚Äî Josh (@joshua38x) August 18, 2024 Expand Tweet This one fan believes emphasizing the original anime‚Äôs characters would help the game do a lot better.\nOG Dragon Ball needs to be in Sparking Zero. OG DB doesn't get enough exposure in the west so actually having a og db arc would do a lot for the fans in the west. Especially if they had most of the great fights like Goku vs Tien 1 and 2, Goku vs Nam, Goku vs Tao, etc\n‚Äî Lord Von (@TheEmperor_Von) August 19, 2024 Expand Tweet February 26, 1986, was the day we saw Dragon Ball characters come to life. From Emperor Pilaf Saga to Piccolo Junior Saga, it was a delight to watch.\nRELATED ‚ÄúGOKU COSTUMES IN SPARKING ZERO LOOKING CLEAN‚Äù: New Yardrat & Saiyan Armor Shown Off For Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO Z fighters like Goku, Tien, and Piccolo originally belonged to that era. Interestingly, both of them, and Yamcha, first appeared as Son Goku‚Äôs enemies.\nSome fans were recently seen talking about certain outfits that could add more salt to the game . If characters from the original series make it to the Spike Chunsoft game, it would be great to see outfits like that of Bandit Yamcha.\nDo you want to see GT characters coming to the upcoming Bandai Namco game? We would like to know about it in the comments section below.",

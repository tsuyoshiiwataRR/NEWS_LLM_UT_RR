Mount revealed the extent of his injury on social media. Mason Mount insists he will do all he can to return to full fitness after suffering an injury in Manchester United's match against Brighton and Hove Albion. The Red Devils fell to a [2-1 defeat against the Seagulls](https://www.tntsports.co.uk/football/premier-league/2024-2025/brighton-hove-albion-2-1-manchester-united-joao-pedro-heads-stoppage-time-winner-to-inflict-defeat-o_sto10310299/story.shtml)at Amex Stadium last weekend, with Mount replaced by new signing Joshua Zirkzee at the start of the second half. Mount's Old Trafford career has been blighted by injuries since arriving at the club from Chelsea in July 2023. The 25-year-old stressed that he wanted to be the one to let fans know about the setback in a social media post. \"During the last game I picked up a minor muscle issue,\" he wrote on social media. \"I've had it checked and it looks like I'll be out for a few games. \"Leading up to and during pre-season, I worked hard to get my fitness back to where it needs to be and I felt re-energised, sharp and ready. \"I wanted you to hear it directly from me how frustrated I am, as I expect you are too. I will do everything possible to be back in the best shape and help the team.\" Mount was in Erik ten Hag's starting XI for the Community Shield and featured in both of their opening two Premier League games this season. The [midfielder joined United from Chelsea for a reported Â£60 million](https://www.tntsports.co.uk/football/transfers/2023-2024/manchester-united-clinch-60m-mason-mount-signing-from-chelsea-in-first-move-of-the-summer_sto9673979/story.shtml)having scored 27 goals in 129 Premier League appearances for the Blues.

    "text": "Heavy traffic is expected across Massachusetts highways and at Boston Logan International Airport for the Labor Day weekend, prompting transportation officials to urge travelers to leave extra time and consider making their trips at off-peak times.Construction work across Massachusetts roadways is on hold through Labor Day weekend as the state Department of Transportation expects heavy traffic volumes. All non-emergency road projects were paused as of 5 a.m. on Friday, MassDOT said in a statement. Scheduled work will resume on Tuesday morning. Additionally, MassDOT said the high-occupancy vehicle lane on Interstate 93 between Boston and Quincy will be opening at 2 p.m. on Friday, and it will not be used on Monday. \"Weâ€™re expecting to see higher traffic counts across the state, so drivers should plan ahead and make safe choices while out on the roads this holiday weekend,\" Highway Administrator Jonathan Gulliver said in a statement. Work on the Sumner Tunnel will not occur during the holiday weekend, and the swing lane on Route 1A southbound at the Sumner Tunnel will not be deployed on Monday but will resume its normal schedule on Tuesday. Weekend closures of the tunnel are scheduled to resume later in September as that project nears completion. According to AAA, gas prices are following a historic trend of peaking in the early summer months and sliding gradually downward as Labor Day approaches. Gas prices have fallen steadily over the past five weeks, the auto club said. At Boston Logan International Airport, Massport officials are suggesting that travelers allow extra time to reach the airport and get through security screenings. For MBTA riders, all subway lines, bus routes and the RIDE offerings will operate on a Sunday schedule. Commuter Rail most ferries will also operate on a weekend schedule.",

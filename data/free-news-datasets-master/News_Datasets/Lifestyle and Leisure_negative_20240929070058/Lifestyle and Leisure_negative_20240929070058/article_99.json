    "text": "Emily Ratajkowski's Cheeky Mexico Swimsuit 'Doesn't Look Comfortable' By Evie Scott on August 29, 2024 at 7:00 PM EDT Emily Ratajkowski put her sizzling curves on display in yet another revealing swimsuit during her Mexico travels. In March 2017, the supermodel jetted South of the Border for some fun in the sun, and the paparazzi had clearly figured out her exact location. Showing off her jaw-dropping figure, Emily padded around a beach in a plunging swimsuit with a cheeky thong finish, and she was met with mixed feedback as The Daily Mail published the photos. Age 25 at the time of the snaps, 33-year-old Emily left little to the imagination, and it would appear that \"flossing\" thong was one of the focal points in the outlet's comments section. Emily Ratajkowski Wows In Swimsuit In Mexico View this post on Instagram Scroll for the photos. Displaying her mile-long legs in a tan swimsuit with a deep-cut neckline, Emily drew the eye from her toned shoulders to her killer assets, also making fans envious with her tiny waist. Enjoying a sandy spot near rows of kayaks, the Inamorata founder made the most of large, towel-covered loungers, with fans seeing her in shades and a sunhat. Keeping stylish with a multicolor beach tote containing her belongings, Emily flashed her bare buns in some photos, and she'd chosen one extra-cheeky thong. See More Photos Below! Emily Ratajkowski: Busy Bikini Model Takes A Break With A One-Piece While On Vacation! [pic.twitter.com/0KVI1pWadA] — National Enquirer (@NatEnquirer) [March 22, 2017] Going backless, Emily even lowered part of her top in one shot, affording hints of sideboob as she exposed her busty figure in a rearview snap. The mom of one, yet to welcome 2021-born son, Sylvester, was also spotted strolling around with an item of clothing strewn over her beach bag, with other images showing her keeping cool with a water bottle as she chilled out on a lounger. Fans didn't take long to comment. Likening Emily's thong to \"floss,\" one user said that her bathing suit looked \"painful.\" Agreeing, another said: \"Wedgie doesn't look comfortable.\" This comment gained 150 upvotes. A third even wrote: \"That costume looks painfully stretched around the [nether regions].\" Thong Bikini Celebrates 'The Perfect Shape' View this post on Instagram More recently, Emily has turned heads with her cheeky Inamorata promos, including the above one, shared to her brand's Instagram earlier this summer. Pinging out her briefs as she rocked a printed two-piece from her 2017-founded brand, EmRata wowed with a very peachy display, putting her toned posterior at the forefront of the photo as she hid her face and faced a wall. \"Perfect print. perfect shape. shop our tie side bottoms!\" a caption read. 'Love Your Plastic Surgery, Girl' View this post on Instagram Emily tends not to spark surgery allegations when it comes to her backside. Nonetheless, 50 fans have now liked a reply slamming the backside view shot. \"Love your plastic surgery girl! Since you continue to leverage your cosmetic work to sell bikinis, let’s talk about it,\" they said.",

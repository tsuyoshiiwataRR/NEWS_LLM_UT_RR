    "text": "Dwight Howard Critiques Rudy Gobert’s 4th DPOY Win as Unwarranted\nRudy Gobert recently won his fourth Defensive Player of the Year Award, making him one of only three players to achieve this feat. However, Dwight Howard criticized Gobert, claiming he is not an elite defender and only thrives in a team setting. Howard argues that Gobert's recognition comes from his support system rather than individual prowess, although he acknowledges Gobert's impact in pick-and-roll situations this season.

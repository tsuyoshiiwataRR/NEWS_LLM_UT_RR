    "text": "It was an evening to forget for\nEnzo Maresca's side, as Servette grabbed a 2-1 victory on home soil, with the Blues squeezing past their opponents with a 3-2 aggregate score. Christopher Nkunku scored the opener for Chelsea, after Mykhailo Mudryk was brought down in the box, but Servette were able to bypass a leaky Blues back line, finding an equaliser through striker Jeremy Guillemenot.\nSubstitute Enzo Crivelli then added a second for the home side, who were arguably the better team on the night, but both sides will have hoped to have finished more of their chances, with golden opportunities from both teams.\nhttps://www.vavel.com/en/football/2024/08/20/chelsea-fc/1193272-joao-felix-returns-but-will-atletico-madrids-biggest-bet-be-a-gamble-that-pays-off-for-chelsea.html will now find out their group stage opponents in the draw on Friday, before a visit by Crystal Palace on Sunday as they hope to return to winning ways quickly.\n-\nStory of the match\nChelsea named a strong lineup for this match despite moderate rotation, and looked to see out their established 2-0 lead over Servette.\nIt was a bright start from the Blues - captain\nEnzo Fernandez had started the match in a deeper midfield role but was able to give the Servette keeper Joel Mall an early test with a strong strike. Noni Madueke was fresh from earning his first England call up, and was in strong form after his performance against Wolves last weekend. He had a good opportunity through the middle that was snuffed out, after Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall was dispossessed.\nIt took just 14 minutes for Chelsea to find an opener, as\nMykhaylo Mudryk received the ball well down Chelsea's left flank, showing great movement to cut inside, winning a penalty after a silly foul by the right-back Keigo Tsunemoto. https://www.vavel.com/en/football/2024/08/01/chelsea-fc/1190781-enzo-maresca-very-happy-after-improved-chelsea-performance-in-atlanta.html made no mistake from the penalty spot, smashing home to the 'keepers left, with the Frenchman recording a goal in both legs of the tie and putting the Blues 3-0 up on aggregate.\nAt the other end, a silly foul by\nBenoit Badiashile gave Servette a good opportunity to find an equaliser, but they couldn't capitalise, with Steve Rouiller's effort failing to find the target.\nChelsea looked comfortable in their shape and seem to be slowly adapting to Maresca's tactical setup game by game. Nkunku showed great vision to create an opportunity for Madueke, but his effort was well blocked again by the Servette defence.\nThere was fluidity in attack, with some good link-up play down the left between Dewsbury-Hall and Mudryk, the former with a good opportunity to run in behind before being dispossessed.\nHowever, a moment of laziness by Chelsea saw Servette find the leveller after 30 minutes; an excellent run by the winger Dereck Kutesa finding striker Guillemenot in attack; the Frenchman making no mistake with a class finish.\nIt was a warning sign for the Blues, and a spark for Servette as they reduced Chelsea's advantage back to two goals.\nServette threatened to score another before half-time, and got the better of Chelsea's defenders with bursts of pace in behind. It was Kutesa again, who had his effort saved by JÃ¶rgensen, before Guillemenot failed to turn in the rebound.\nOn the opposite side, Cognat was able to find a crossing opportunity, but his effort was cut out well.\nEnzo Maresca will have been delighted to hear the half time whistle, after a good period of dominance by the Swiss side, which had exposed a leaky and disorganised Chelsea defense.\nSecond Half\nThe second half begun with a similar competitiveness, with both sides having strong chances to pull ahead. Guillemenot had another quality chance but drifted just offside, before\nMarc Guiu suffered another agonising miss at the other end for Chelsea.\nMudryk then had a golden chance after a burst of pace, but was unable to find the net after a rebound bounced just wide of the Servette goal.\nSubsitutions on the hour mark saw a Chelsea debut for youngster\nTyrique George, replacing Madueke whilst Moises Caicedo and Nicholas Jackson were also introduced.\nServette found good opportunities from the right-hand side, and it was the substitute Enzo Crivelli, who rose highest from a Cognat cross to nod in a second goal and give his side the lead.\nCole Palmer was introduced as Chelsea looked to respond, but they could have risked conceding another when Cognat's low cross failed to find a Servette player.\nNot long afterwards, Jackson found the back of the net with a great finish, but his left leg stepped just offside and the goal was disallowed.\nThe game turned tense into the final ten minutes, with the home fans in loud chorus as their side pushed for a third goal. Another dangerous cross from the right hand side had to be intercepted by\nAxel Disasi, who headed away from danger.\nNkunku was by far Chelsea's strongest creative outlet and created a golden chance for\nCole Palmer, his chance rebounding cruelly off the crossbar.\nThe match was halted in the final few minutes by a firework display at the home end; cause for celebration with Servette coming away with a well earned result against a lacklustre Chelsea side, who failed to finish their chances.\n-\nPlayer of the match:\nChristopher Nkunku\nEven after a dry attacking display from the Blues, one positive to take away was the performance from\nhttps://www.vavel.com/en/football/2024/08/22/chelsea-fc/1193531-chelsea-2-0-servette-post-match-chelsea-player-ratings.html, who demonstrated his individual ability after being left out of the 6-2 victory at Molineux.\nAs an attacking eight in midfield, Nkunku showed quality off the ball to find pockets of space to receive, but also had energy to fall back and help out the defensive pivot when needed.\nHe was also an excellent creator in an advanced central position and showed good link-up with\nNoni Madueke out wide, as well as substitutes Palmer and Jackson, and will have wondered how he did not nab an assist.\nA strong performance by Nkunku, who is fighting for a starting spot amongst Chelsea's rich attacking depth.",

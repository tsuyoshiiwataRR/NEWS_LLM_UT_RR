    "text": "Look, we've all eaten things we're not proud of . You waddle to the fridge in the middle of the night and end up eating a whole bag of shredded cheese—it happens! I once ate two slices of cold, wet pizza, so I'm not judging here. Again, no judgment! However, some of the stuff on this list is pure nightmare fuel and might just make you gag a little. I mean, peanut butter and jelly deviled eggs? Why? Why do that? Hotdog water Jell-O?? Who hurt you so much that you'd do such a thing? So, I'm sorry in advance if you feel sick to your stomach by the end of this list, but if I had to suffer , now so do you! Just do me a favor and never eat a cheeseburger from a can or make yourself a tall glass of \"Beef Fizz\" (the recipe is in this list, but please, don't!).",

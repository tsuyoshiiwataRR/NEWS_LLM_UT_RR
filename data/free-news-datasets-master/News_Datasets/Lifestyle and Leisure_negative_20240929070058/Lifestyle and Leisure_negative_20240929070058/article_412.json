    "text": "Sign up / Sign in Browse over 9,000 car reviews When I’m turning at low speeds in my [2017 Holden Captiva 2.2 AWD](/holden/captiva) it feels like the back wheels are snatching. This sounds like a problem with the rear or centre differential not working properly. When a car turns a corner, the various wheels must turn at different speeds (because they travel through different arcs). The differentials use a complex series of gears allow this to happen, but if they’re not all working properly, there’s a chance that the individual wheels are not able to turn at the correct speed. When that happens, the tyres have to skip and spin. Either that, or something like an axle or drive-shaft will snap. The rear differential allows the two rear wheels to turn at different speeds, while the centre differential (which an [all-wheel-drive car](/car-advice/all-wheel-or-four-wheel-drive-whats-the-difference-33194) has) allows the front and rear wheels to turn at different speeds and maintain harmony. Being [all-wheel-drive,](/car-advice/all-wheel-or-four-wheel-drive-whats-the-difference-33194) your Captiva also has a front differential, but since you’re feeling the rear wheels skipping and skating, the front differential is probably not the cause. Which leaves the rear or centre differential. Differentials can fail for a variety of reasons, including excess heat build-up or a lack of the correct type of lubricating oil. It’s entirely possible a seal has failed, allowing the oil out and letting the differential run dry to the point where it’s now damaged. But don’t ignore the simple things like a biding rear brake or poorly adjusted park-brake.",

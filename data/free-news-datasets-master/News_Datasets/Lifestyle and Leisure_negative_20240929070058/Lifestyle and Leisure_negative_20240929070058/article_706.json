    "text": "Capri Sun, the iconic beverage brand, has announced a significant change to its packaging, introducing a bottle form aimed at adult consumers. The new design, which replaces the traditional silver pouch, was revealed on August 28 in an Instagram post by the food blog Snackolator. The post showcased the new 12-ounce bottles, which will be easier to use as they eliminate the need for a straw. \"Capri Sun is coming for the adults with new bottles that will be arriving in stores soon!\" the post stated, also mentioning that the initial launch will feature three popular flavors: Fruit Punch, Strawberry Kiwi, and Pacific Cooler. The announcement has sparked a wave of reactions from fans on social media, with opinions ranging from excitement to nostalgia. Some fans expressed enthusiasm for the new design. \"All my dreams are coming true,\" one Instagram user commented, while another added, \"I'm definitely going to be on the lookout for those!\" Others, however, are concerned that the new packaging may alter the nostalgic experience of drinking from the pouch. \"I just want it to taste like when I was a kid in the 90s and 2000s,\" one fan wrote, while another said, \"This doesnâ€™t sit well with my spirit.\" One user on X (formerly Twitter) went so far as to call the change \"one of the most shocking product changes in the history of food & beverage.\" Despite the mixed reactions, Capri Sun has not yet announced an official release date for the new bottles, though the post hinted that they would be \"coming soon.\" COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

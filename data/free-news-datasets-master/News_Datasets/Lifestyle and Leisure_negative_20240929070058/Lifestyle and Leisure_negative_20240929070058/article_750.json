    "text": "The idea of asking for a entrance fee to attend a weddingas in the case of the Houston couplehas clearly sparked controversy and negative reactions, to the point that None of the guests agreed to participate.\nThe groom, Hassan Ahmed, took to TikTok to express his disappointment, complaining that none of the guests agreed to pay the $450 fee required to attend the ceremony.. He tried to justify the request by explaining that the wedding cost about $200,000 to organize, and compared that expense to what people pay to buy concert tickets for artists like Beyoncé or Chris Brown, suggesting that it should be just as acceptable to pay for a significant event like a wedding.\nHowever, it is clear that the request was perceived as inappropriate. In many cultures, a wedding is seen as an occasion for sharing and celebration, not as a paid event. This type of request could be interpreted as a lack of respect towards the guests, turning a joyful occasion into a financial obligation, and consequently alienating even the people closest to them.\nThe situation highlights a sensitive issue: how the costs of major events are managed and the expectations of guests. Asking for direct financial contributions to attend a wedding, however unusual, can raise ethical and social issues that deserve broader consideration.",

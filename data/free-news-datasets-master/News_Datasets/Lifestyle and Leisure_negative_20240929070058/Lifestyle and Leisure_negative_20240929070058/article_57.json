    "text": "RAWALPINDI: National team Head Coach Jason Gillespie Thursday admitted that Pakistan will have to make a marked improvement on all fronts to create an impact in the second Test against Bangladesh starting from today (Friday) here at the Pindi Stadium. “There is a lot of things to improve including the over-rate that requires drastic improvement. What happened in the first Test is unacceptable. Pakistan will have to improve their over rate. The most important thing is that we need to play positive cricket. Playing positive cricket does not mean hitting fours and sixes, it means covering all the basics and playing according to the requirements. If we want to improve on what we have shown in the first Test, we need to play according to the situation,” he said. Gillespie added that playing for the country was a big honour. “As such we need to make the best of opportunities coming our way. I know all the players love to play for the country. It is very encouraging to see such a spirit in players.” The head coach said that intentions in the first Test was to go all out for a win. “That is why Shan Masood declared the first innings. We wanted to move forward. Unluckily, we did not get good results. At the same time Bangladesh team played well and snatched the initiative.” He said that everyone was disappointed to lose the first Test. “We cannot do anything about that. What we want at this point of time is to concentrate fully on the second Test. We have to make all our efforts to win the second Test to draw the series. At this moment we are focusing on as how to take Bangladesh’s 20 wickets. We have learnt our lessons and will make every effort not to repeat the mistakes we have made during the first Test. The players are excited to take up the challenge. Though it is difficult, we believe, we can achieve the target by playing flawless cricket in the second Test.” He added that Shaheen Shah was given rest for the second Test. “I talked to him and he fully understood what I said about the requirements. Though he has become a father and we have allowed him to stay with his family. He is also working on his bowling so that he can be more effective.

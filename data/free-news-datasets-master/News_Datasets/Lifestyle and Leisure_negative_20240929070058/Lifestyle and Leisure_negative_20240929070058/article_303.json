    "text": "Bison take lead into the Half, but Fall 31-26 to Colorado NDSU FOOTBALL OPENS 2024 SEASON WITH WEEK 1 LOSS TO COLORADO. BOULDER, CO (KVRR)â€“ Since head coach Deion Sanders was hired at Colorado, NDSU had their 2024 week one game against the Buffaloes circled on their calendar. Earlier this year, it was announced it would be a nationally televised game as well, adding even more hype for the 9-time FCS national champions. NDSU entered the showdown in Boulder winners in 9 of their 13 all-time meetings against FBS programs. The Bison opened up their season with a bang. On their opening drive, quarterback Cam Miller connected with running back TK Marshall for a 48-yard completion that set up a successful 36-yard field goal from Griffin Crosa and a 3-0 Bison lead. The Buffaloes offense responded quick, however, with a 41-yard touchdown score from quarterback and Heisman trophy candidate Shedeur Sanders to two-way star Travis Hunter. When NDSU got the ball back, they quickly proved they could hang with FBS programs. Cam Miller led the Bison on a 75-yard drive capped off by a 7-yard touchdown strike to tight end Joe Stoffel. Following that drive, Shedeur Sanders was quick to answer with a 69-yard touchdown pass to give the Buffaloes a 14-10 lead after the first quarter. After doing it with his arm in the first quarter, Miller did it with his legs in the second. The lone second quarter touchdown was scored by NDSU on a 7-yard Miller run helping the Bison to a 20-17 half time lead. After NDSU and Colorado traded punts to begin the third quarter, Shedeur Sanders shined, exploiting the holes in the Bison secondary. Sanders found Hunter for their second touchdown connection of the game quickly after finding wide receiver Jimmy Horn Jr. for 41-yards to set up the score. Leading 24 to 20 entering the fourth quarter, the Sanders-Hunter connection struck for a third time with eight minutes to go in the game, extending the Colorado lead to 11. In all, it was a 17-play drive that ate up over eight minutes of game clock. On the ensuing Bison offensive drive, the Bison converted on a 4th and 1 to keep their comeback hopes alive with just under 5 minutes remaining on a Cole Payton rush up the middle. Later, Miller picked up his second rushing touchdown on the day with a 20-yard dash to cut the Bison deficit to 5. NDSU elected to go for two, but were unsuccessful. Trailing 31-26, Code Green needed a stop to give the Bison offense a crack at the go-ahead score. With under two minutes to go in the game, on third and long, Sanders scrambled and threw the ball down field to LaJohntay Wester. Wester was ran into as he went up for the reception, prompting a pass interference penalty and an automatic first down for Colorado. Code Green was given one more chance at getting the ball back for their offense with one minute and 30 seconds to go in the game. On third and 10, Sanders connected on a 7-yard pass, 3 yards short of a first down. With no timeouts remaining, NDSU got the ball back with just 32 seconds remaining on their own 8-yard line. NDSU needed a miracle. Miller moved the ball down field with a few completions which led to their final chance with 5 seconds to go form the 47-yard line. The Hail Mary pass was caught by Tyler Terhark at the 4-yard line for a gain of 49-yards, but he was quickly tackled giving Colorado the 31-26 week one win. NDSU (0-1) will return to the FargoDome next week, September 7. They will host Tennessee State at 2:30 P.M.

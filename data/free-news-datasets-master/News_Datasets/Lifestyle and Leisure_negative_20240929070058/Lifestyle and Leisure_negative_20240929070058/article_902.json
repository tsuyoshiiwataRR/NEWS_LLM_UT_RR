LAPRESSE LW 30/08/2024 - 10:45 CDT\nCompartir en Facebook\nCompartir en Twitter\nCompartir en Telegram\nCompartir en Whatsapp\nEnviar por email Celebrities. Jennifer Lopez, seen for the first time after her divorce alone in the mansion she is selling with Ben Affleck: It's really hit her hard Celebrities. Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck move forward with their divorce: U-Haul truck spotted at their Beverly Hills mansion Ben Affleck is a bit worried about how Jennifer Lopez is spoiling the kids, even though he appreciates her strong bond with them. It seems like their parenting styles just don't quite match up . According to an insider, Affleck feels that Lopez's approach is too lenient and lacks the necessary discipline that kids need while growing up. It's no surprise that they had disagreements over this during their time together.\nEven though their fairytale love story has come to an end, Affleck's kids are still very attached to their stepmom . Especially his oldest daughter, Violet, who's often seen hanging out with Lopez and going to restaurants. It's a tricky situation for Affleck as they head towards divorce.\nJennifer Lopez and stepdaughter Violet Affleck enjoy a walk together A source told InTouch Weekly that Ben Affleck isn't too thrilled about how much Jennifer Lopez spoils their kids and disrupts his usual traditional way of raising them. The insider mentioned, \" They have always had vastly different styles of parenting. Ben spoils them from time to time and gives them their favourite treats, but J. Lo really showers them with gifts like nobody's business. \"\nBen worries Jennifer's leniency may spoil their kids It's clear that Affleck is grateful for the way Lopez has embraced his family and kids, as well as the strong bond she has with his ex-wife Jennifer Garner . However, it seems like she's more of a \" Disneyland stepmom \" in his eyes. The source also mentioned, \" She's always picking up treats for them, she always seems to know just what will make them happy, and she gets a real kick out of making them smile .\"\nIt's not all bad though. Despite their differences in parenting styles, it's evident that both Affleck and Lopez care deeply for the kids . Affleck might be a bit concerned about the spoiling, but he also appreciates the strong bond Lopez shares with the children.\nIn the midst of all this, Jennifer Lopez seems to be enjoying some downtime in the Hamptons, indulging in her love for gardening. Meanwhile, Ben Affleck spent the Fourth of July with the kids in LA. It's good to see that they're both finding ways to spend quality time with the kids, despite their differences.",

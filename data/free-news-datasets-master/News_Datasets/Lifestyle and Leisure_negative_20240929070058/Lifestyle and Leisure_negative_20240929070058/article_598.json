    "text": "Dirty Birds Drop Series Finale to Southern Maryland\nAugust 30, 2024 -\nAtlantic League (AtL) Charleston Dirty Birds News Release\n(Charleston, WV) - 15 minutes into the ballgame on Thursday night, the game was delayed for almost three hours due to rain. This is the final series between Southern Maryland and Charleston, so the game needed to be completed. The nine-inning contest resumed at 9:47pm and did not conclude until 12:55am on Friday morning.\nThe Dirty Birds used six pitchers in the loss. Edison Suriel took his first loss of the year after allowing two runs in 2.2 innings. Only one of those runs were earned due to a fielding error by short stop Joseph Rosa. The pitching staff combined to allow only three hits, but two errors and six walks put the Blue Crabs on top.\nCharleston combined for seven hits, including two home runs. Atlantic League home run leader, Keon Barnum, hit his 36th home run of the season. Third baseman Juan Santana hit his eighth home run in the eighth inning.\nThe Dirty Birds host the High Point Rockers for a four-game series starting Friday night at 6:35pm.\nCharleston Dirty Birds Statistics\nâ€¢ Discuss this story on the\nAtlantic League message board...\nAtlantic League Stories from August 30, 2024\nDirty Birds Drop Series Finale to Southern Maryland- Charleston Dirty Birds\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.",

    "text": "Brooke Shields’ daughter Grier has shared her opinion on the infamous nepo-baby tag saying that it “hurts her feelings”. In an exclusive interview with People, Shields’ 18 year old daughter and model Grier, opened up about being raised by the model and actress and discussed the nepo-baby tag that has been making its round for a few years now. “My mom says I can get you in a room but I can’t get you to stay there,” she told the outlet, explaining that though her mother’s name can open doors, they’re not guaranteed to always stay open and bring in opportunities. “People have referred to me by that term [nepo-baby] a bajillion times,” Grier added. “It doesn’t really affect me because they are sitting behind a screen commenting on my social media [but] it hurts my feelings. Obviously wanting to model and having a mom that models, helps, but also if I get there and they hate the way I look, they’re not going to ask me to come back.” She went on say that “Having a famous mom can only get you so far,” adding that if she and her sister – 21-year-old Rowan – were horrible at their jobs, they’d be fired despite who their mother is. “You have to be good at what you’re doing to keep the job.” In other nepo-baby discourse, Emma Robbers recently opened up about the term and shared that her famous relatives have actually caused her to be turned down for jobs in Hollywood in the past . Recommended While appearing on the Table For Two podcast back in June, she spoke about the difficulty of people assuming she has it easy and ignoring the failures that she has had to endure . Lily Allen has also previously spoken out against the ‘nepo baby’ concept , describing it as sexist. “I feel like young girls get it harder with the nepo baby thing,” she said. “I don’t really see people calling out sons of famous actors — not that they should be called out. I don’t think anyone should be called out for wanting to follow their dream.” Willow Smith, meanwhile, has admitted to feeling a sense of “insecurity” about the term .",

    "text": "This movie is really stupid and very boring most of the time. There are almost no \"ghoulies\" in it at all. There is nothing good about this movie on any level. Just more bad actors pathetically attempting to make a movie so they can get enough money to eat. Avoid at all costs.\nGhoulies IV\n1994\nComedy / Fantasy / Horror\nGhoulies IV\n1994\nComedy / Fantasy / Horror\nLoading video, please wait...\nPlot summary\nWhile in pursuit of cop Johnathan Graves, his demonic nemesis, Faust, sends his disciple Alexandria to hunt down the amulet that will set him free. Meanwhile, the Ghoulies find their way through an open porthole and onto the streets of L.A., creating madness and mayhem as they search for a way to get back home. As the body count rises, it becomes an ultimate battle between a demonic killer, a rule-breaking cop, and our favorite creatures from the netherworld!\nUploaded by:\nFREEMAN\nAugust 30, 2024 at 11:49 AM\nDirector\nTop cast\nBarbara Alyn Woodsas Kate Tony Coxas Ghoulie Dark Philip McKeonas Demon Peter Liapisas Jonathan Graves\nTech specs720p.BLU\nMovie Reviews\nJust plain stupid\nVery bad straight-to-video cheese that isn't too bad to watch\nI don't know why IMDb lists all the Ghoulies films as theatrical releases.. They were all straight to video films. Same with the Puppet Master series. Why hasn't anyone noticed this yet? Right, somehow you've stumbled across Ghoulies IV, probably raiding through an old abandoned video rental store from 1993. You looked in the discount section and found this...Look at the back and front covers. What do you expect, The Shawshank Redemption? There is no need to review this film so critically. It is the fourth GHOULIES film! I bought it on DVD for 6.50 because... it was 6.50.. I knew it wasn't Kubrick material. And I was right. An unremastered DVD with no extras, not even a trailer, boasts an uncared-for film.\nIt actually contains the star of the first Ghoulies film, Peter Liapis... who really didn't get many 'big' roles apart from those two films. And I don't see why... He's not too bad an actor and is pretty fun. But I guess if you're gonna take a lead role in the Ghoulies films, Scorsese and Tarantino will lose interest. Also present is his idiot sidekick Bobby Di Cocco, who despite having a very small resemblance to Al Pacino (very small), retains none of his acting ability... A complete idiot who's just awkward to watch. Then there's Stacie Randall - obviously a porn star, I don't need to look that up. She does look quite sexy, though her costume, her character and everything she does drags down the films credibility, which is no easy task for such a film.\nThen there is the Ghoulies themselves! Who also manage to let us down. Ghoulies III made them start talking, mistake no. 1, but Ghoulies IV takes it a step further. Instead of being puppets, this time the Ghoulies are in fact KIDS in COSTUMES!!!! The filmmakers decided to run that extra mile to insult the films viewers. Also, there's only TWO of them, and they're not the main highlight of the film, as they don't appear in a lot of it. However, at times they are MILDLY amusing... And they're not evil this time either.\nThis really is hilariously bad stuff, it's amazing that I was actually able to enjoy it. I dunno why... Some of the black humour is actually funny, though the script is mostly effortless. Imagine Satan's only threat to you being that he will \"kill you, slowly...painfully...\".\nBut at least Full Moon had no involvement this time. Did they? Yeah, a very bad and cheaply made film with 0 production value, but not so bad as to be in the ranks of Puppet Master 1/2, Lawnmower Man 2, Surviving Christmas or even Ghoulies III.\nYes, I watch crap. But not just any crap. Wynorski Crap!\nOkay, so I have a little thing for director Jim Wynorsky. Or at least I used to have, because it's been a while since I've seen a film of his. Wynorski must be one of my favorite bad-movie-makers ever. It's as simple as that. And \"Ghoulies IV\" really is one of the biggest stinkers of his I've ever seen. The only screen time the notorious Ghoulies have in this 4th installment is actually taken from footage out of the first movie. That's one thing you can say about Wynorski: He rips off whatever he can, even right down to his own movies (this not being the case for \"Ghoulies IV\", though - you have to see \"976-Evil II\" and \"Storm Trooper\" to understand this). But in this film we do have: Two extremely annoying and totally unfunny troll-midgets, a bunch of cheap & silly animated effects, a mysterious demon-summoning red diamond, bad acting, a retarded storyline that leads to nowhere, a drugstore shoot-out totally unrelated to the plot, yap yap yap and so on and so on... And best thing of all: Stacie Randall running around in a tight black latex suit with her boobies half exposed (all the time!). Great fun, but I have this slightest feeling that no-one is going to agree with me on that.\nRead more IMDb reviews",

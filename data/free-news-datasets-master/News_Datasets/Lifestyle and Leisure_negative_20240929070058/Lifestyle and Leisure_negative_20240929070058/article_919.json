    "text": "“King of Queens” star Leah Remini and husband, Angelo Pagán, are going their separate ways after nearly 30 years together.\nRemini, 54, and Pagán, 56, announced Thursday in joint Instagram posts that they have decided to file for divorce, ending their 21-year marriage and 28-year relationship, because “we both changed, as people do, and we got used to playing roles that didn’t fit us anymore.”\n“This decision came after a lot of thought and care, and as hard as divorce is, we are approaching this with a positive outlook because we know it’s what’s best for us,” they said in the joint statement.\nAdvertisement “We are proud of how we have worked through this together,” they added. “Yes, we’re sad, and we’ve got some figuring out to do as we continue to move forward into our new normal — together still in many ways, and apart in some new ones. But here’s the thing: we’ve been best friends for so many years. We are still celebrating holidays together, watching our favorite tv shows together, and gathering as a family.”\nEntertainment & Arts\nChurch of Scientology fires back after Leah Remini sues, says she’s ‘horrible’ and ‘toxic’ The Church of Scientology has responded to Leah Remini, who sued her former church alleging decades of stalking, defamation and harassment akin to the mob.\nAug. 3, 2023\nThe statement said they were taking this next step into “unknown territory” after “a lot of effort and consideration,” and that the decision “reflects who we are today.”\n“Our bond is still strong — it’s just evolved into something different,” the statement said. “We think a marriage that lasted this long and created so many beautiful memories, especially raising our incredible daughter, is something to celebrate. From our perspective, this marriage was a huge success.”\nAdvertisement The New Yorkers publicly shared their relationship in TV specials that aired on VH1 and on Remini’s TLC series “It’s All Relative,” which aired for two seasons. Likewise, they said, they want to be “as transparent as we can be” about their split to potentially help others “have more access to different kinds of relationship stories and not feel so isolated in navigating the changes that millions of couples make every year. “\n“We hope our journey can inspire others to see that relationships — whether they change or end — aren’t failures,” they said. “We’ll keep sharing snippets of our lives as we navigate this new chapter.”\nEntertainment & Arts\nJennifer Lopez files for divorce from Ben Affleck after two years of marriage Jennifer Lopez has filed for divorce from Ben Affleck, ending their relationship once again. She filed for divorce Tuesday in L.A. without benefit of a lawyer.\nAug. 20, 2024\nRemini filed for divorce without a lawyer Thursday evening in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The “Kevin Can Wait” and “Saved by the Bell” alum cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split, according to court documents obtained Friday by The Times. She listed the date of separation as Aug. 1 in the petition and checked boxes agreeing to mediation about property and support and to proceed by a stipulated judgment.\nAdvertisement Neither she nor Pagán is seeking spousal support nor child support, as their daughter, Sofia Bella, is an adult.\nRemini first met Pagán in 1996. At the time, the Puerto Rican actor and singer was performing at El Floridita — a Cuban club and restaurant in Hollywood — and Remini told Redbook in 2010 that it was “love at first sight.” They wed on July 19, 2003, and had their daughter in 2004. (Pagán has three sons from a previous relationship.)\nThe musician also supported his wife during her tumultuous departure from the Church of Scientology , which she documented in her 2015 book “Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology” and subsequent docuseries “Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath.”\nIn May, the New York Post reported that Remini and her longtime friend Jennifer Lopez had rekindled their friendship following reports that Lopez was splitting from husband Ben Affleck. Lopez filed for divorce earlier this month, ending her two-year marriage to the Oscar winner.\nMore to Read\nSophie Turner and Joe Jonas finalize divorce after custody battle turned contentious Sept. 11, 2024\nJudge Mathis is optimistic about repairing his marriage after wife filed for divorce Sept. 3, 2024\nJudge Mathis’ wife files for divorce from TV personality after nearly 40 years of marriage Aug. 23, 2024\nTelevision Entertainment & Arts Breaking News Relationships",

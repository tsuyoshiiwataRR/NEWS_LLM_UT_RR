The genre however can only persist if it is allowed to grow, and a significant component that makes that possible is competitors. The DCU's first chapter \"Gods and Monsters\" will contribute to the overall superhero genre, and series like The Boys have given subversive looks at the same ideas and themes . This trend continues with a new Netflix series.\nMarvel has had mixed success with television, but they appear to be working to correct this. With at least 12 MCU TV shows coming, it is essential that the studio reflect on what they have done right and wrong . Daredevil: Born Again went through a creative overhaul near the end of its production to ensure a final result that would engage audiences, showing that, when things aren't working, Marvel has recently been bold enough to go back and fix them, no matter the effort it takes. Following this, the MCU should take cues from other superhero series, including one on Netflix.\nRelated Every Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie Ranked Worst To Best Over 15 years and 33 movies, the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies have redefined blockbuster cinema. But how do all the films stack up?\n2 Netflix's Supacell Currently Has A 100% Rotten Tomatoes Score Close Supacell is a 2024 British superhero television series that has clearly resonated with critics, garnering a 100% Rotten Tomatoes critic score with 20 votes . The series has done well for the streamer since its release in June, and has been confirmed to receive a season 2. Telling the story of several Black South Londoners who suddenly gain superpowers and must avoid being captured by a shadowy organization, the series has gained steady viewership over its time on Netflix.\nWhile many critics have admitted that the general makeup of the series is not incredibly original, it is in its themes and execution that the show sets itself apart. Superhero stories are nothing new, but exploring themes of racial profiling and poverty through a unique lens sets this series apart. In addition, the show, created by Rapman, discusses sickle cell disease and its impact on individuals and their families. Using these links to real-world struggles helps to highlight Supacell as a series to look out for.\nSupacell (2024) Where to Watch stream rent buy Not available\nNot available\nNot available\n*Availability in US Supacell is a British superhero drama series that follows a group of ordinary Black Londoners who suddenly develop superpowers. The series explores the impact of their newfound abilities on their personal lives and the broader societal implications. Supacell blends action with social commentary, highlighting themes of empowerment and responsibility.\nCast Michael Salami , Eddie Marsan , Adelayo Adedayo , Tosin Cole , Eric Kofi Abrefa , Nadine Mills , Calvin Demba Release Date June 27, 2024 What The MCU Can Learn From Netflix's Supacell Close The MCU has been in a bit of a rut in recent years, attempting to expand the scope of its universe through enormous multiversal storytelling. Some of this has worked, allowing Deadpool & Wolverine 's excellent cameos , while other stories have not worked as well. Netflix could learn from the smaller, more specific stories of series like Supacell . Rather than everything being enormous, real, smaller, specific details of life should be allowed to be a part of the story. This helps audiences to connect more deeply.\nMarvel has done this on occasion, and it has worked from time to time. Ms. Marvel took a small-scale story of high-school experience and gave it a superhero gloss, which garnered much critical acclaim . However, this scope seems to have been abandoned with the character, with little of the human experience translating to the story of The Marvels . Following this, for the sake of engagement and connection, Marvel should be elevating components of its creators' voices and history. Using these connection points can help their series feel more compelling and engaging.\nThe MCU has been around for some time and has done an excellent job with keeping their audiences engaged. This has, however, required some level of reinvention through its many phases. Fortunately, the creators behind many of these projects, including Kevin Feige himself, are big fans of the superhero genre and tend to explore and appreciate other works from other studios . Looking at Supacell could provide some good lessons for the Marvel Cinematic Universe . Fortunately, the studio is likely already well aware of successes like these and is learning from them.\nMarvel Cinematic Universe The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a multimedia superhero franchise that began in 2008 with Paramount's Iron Man starring Robert Downey Jr. The franchise quickly grew in popularity, with Disney eventually buying out Marvel Entertainment in 2009. The MCU consists of dozens of movies and TV shows, most notably Avengers: Endgame, WandaVision, and Loki.\nCreated by Kevin Feige First Film Iron Man Upcoming MCU Movies\nCaptain America: Brave New World\nRelease Date February 14, 2025\nThunderbolts*\nRelease Date May 2, 2025\nThe Fantastic Four (2025)\nRelease Date July 25, 2025\nBlade (2025)\nRelease Date November 7, 2025\nAvengers: Doomsday\nRelease Date May 1, 2026\nAvengers: Secret Wars\nRelease Date May 7, 2027 Marvel Cinematic Universe Your changes have been saved\nEmail is sent\nEmail has already been sent\nclose Please verify your email address.\nSend confirmation email close You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.\nManage Your List Follow Followed Follow with Notifications Follow Unfollow Close Thread Sign in to your ScreenRant account We want to hear from you!

    "text": "John McEnroe suspects the final entry in Rafael Nadal’s tennis story is looming large, as he looks to follow in the footsteps of his greatest rival with his final appearance.\nNadal has confirmed he will miss this month’s US Open and play next at the Laver Cup in September.\nThe 22-time Grand Slam champion hinted after his Olympics exit that he would skip the final major of the year at Flushing Meadows.\nNadal has won the US Open on four occasions but competed there only once since his 2019 triumph after a number of injury struggles in recent years, which has sparked continuous debate over when he will retire.\n“I have decided not to compete at this year’s US Open a place where I have amazing memories,” Nadal posted on his official X page last month.\n“I will miss those electric and special night sessions in NYC at Ashe, but I don’t think I would be able to give my 100 per cent this time.\n“Thanks to all my US fans in particular, will miss you all and will see you another time. Best of luck to all for the always amazing US Open. My next event will be the Laver Cup in Berlin.”\nNadal’s commitment to playing at the Laver Cup next month could raise the prospect of the Spaniard following in the footsteps of great rival and friend Roger Federer by retiring at the Ryder Cup-style event.\nFederer walked away from professional tennis in 2022 after an emotional farewell at the Laver Cup in London, where he played competitively for the last time in a doubles match alongside Nadal.\nA similar outcome for Nadal could be on the cards given his injury struggles in recent years, with McEnroe suggesting the 22-time Grand Slam icon could wave farewell to tennis in Berlin next month.\nRafael Nadal News The 7 players with the highest US Open men’s win percentage: ft. Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer & Rafael Nadal\nUS Open: The 9 greatest men’s singles champions – ranked!\n“It feels like he is going to stop, maybe, at Laver Cup,” said Laver Cup Team World captain McEnroe, who will be a Eurosport analyst at the US Open.\n“Then again, Roger did it at Laver Cup a couple of years ago, so maybe he wants to do it in his own time.\n“He still seems like he has an appetite to play. It seems like he is trying to get the body up to a level where he feels like he can play. Maybe see what he can do at the start of next year?\n“I don’t know and this is a total guess, but Laver Cup could be the end for Rafa.\n“He really loves to play, more than almost anyone I’ve ever seen, but we’ve watched Andy Murray for the last six years trying to get back to that level and it’s hard when your body lets you down.\n“It’s hard to walk way when you still want to play and you look at Murray and he wanted it so bad. It sucks when your body doesn’t cooperate and we will see with Rafa. I’d be a little surprised if he carried on playing.”\nFans across Europe can watch the US Open on Eurosport and Max (excludes Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and Ireland)",

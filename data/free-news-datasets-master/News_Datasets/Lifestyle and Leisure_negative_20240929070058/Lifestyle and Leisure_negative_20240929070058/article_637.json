    "text": "Chelsea did not have as comfortable a night as they would have imagined going into the match, as they lost the Conference League Play-off second leg 2-1 to Servette.\nDespite the late scare, the Blues still progress into the Conference League\nSimilar to the first leg, it was a\nChristopher Nkunku penalty which opened the scoring on the night to make it 3-0 on aggregate.\nAlthough it looked as if the tie would be over after that goal,\nServette did brilliantly to come back into the tie scoring a goal in each half to put pressure on the West Londoners late on.\nHere is how each player performed:\nFilip Jorgensen - 6\nThe Danish goalkeeper did not have as good a performance as he did in the first leg.\nAlthough he made a couple of decent saves, he was poor on Servette's second goal of the match.\nAxel Disasi - 5\nDisasi was caught out of position for the first goal.\nThe French defender also did not look composed on the ball many times throughout the match.\nTosin Adarabioyo - 6\nAdarabioyo was solid for large portions of the game and he does look composed playing out from the back.\nHowever, he should have definitely done better for Servette's second.\nBenoit Badiashile - 5\nVery poor for the first goal as it looked as if he had switched off for a split second.\nThe Frenchman also does not fill you with confidence when he is on the ball.\nRenato Veiga - 6\nThe Portuguese summer signing had a solid enough performance.\nAlthough he was not perfect, you can tell that there is definitely a player in there and perhaps this was good business from Chelsea.\nEnzo Fernandez - 6\nHe was controlling the match at times with his passing, but the final ball was lacking.\nThe Argentine does not offer enough defensively though, as many times he was ran past too easily.\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall - 5\nThe midfielder picked up some good positions at times but he lost the ball too often.\nThe former\nLeicester City man's final ball also was not there.\nhttps://www.vavel.com/en/football/2024/08/01/chelsea-fc/1190781-enzo-maresca-very-happy-after-improved-chelsea-performance-in-atlanta.html - 7\nAs he did in the first leg, Nkunku scored the penalty for the Blues.\nThe Frenchman also looked like a creative threat throughout the match, and was unlucky to not get another goal or assist.\nNoni Madueke - 6\nMadueke looked dangerous at times cutting in on the right.\nHowever, the final product was not there as it was against\nWolves on the weekend.\nMykhailo Mudryk - 6\nIt was a performance that we are used to seeing from the Ukrainian, bright moments and electric pace but no end product.\nHe did win the penalty for his side and did look better overall than he did in the first leg.\nMarc Guiu - 5\nThe young Spanish striker pressed well as he did in the first leg.\nHowever, other than that he struggled to lead the line and did not have the best of matches.\n-\nSubstitutes\nTyrique George - 7\nThe young winger grew into the game the longer he was on the pitch.\nA creative threat, it looks as if Cobham has another gem on their hands.\nMoises Caicedo - 6\nCaicedo came on for Enzo and added a bit more durability than his Argentinian counterpart would have done.\nIt was not a performance to write home about, but he was alright.\nNicolas Jackson - 7\nThe Senegalese forward came on and definitely was a threat.\nHe put the ball in the back of the net, but it was ruled out for offside.\nJackson will be leaving this match wondering how he did not get a goal or an assist.\nCole Palmer - 7\nSimilar to Jackson, the Englishman will be wondering how he did not leave this game with a goal.\nPalmer hit the woodwork and also linked well with his teammates in a creative showing off the bench.",

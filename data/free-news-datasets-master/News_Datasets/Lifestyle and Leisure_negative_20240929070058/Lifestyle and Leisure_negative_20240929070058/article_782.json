    "text": "Bollywood actress Raveena Tandon recently shared a deeply emotional post on Instagram, reflecting the bittersweet journey of watching her children grow up and prepare to leave “the nest.” In a heartfelt post, Raveena shared touching throwback images of her four children – daughter Rasha, son Ranbir and adopted daughters Pooja and Chhaya – alongside more recent snapshots. The carousel begins with nostalgic photos of young Rasha and Ranbir, playfully splashing in a pool and hugging their mother. Following these are recent snapshots of the duo, showing how much they have grown. Raveena also includes cherished childhood pictures of Pooja and Chhaya alongside their recent images. The collection beautifully captures adorable family moments, from travelling adventures to attending special events together. The series concludes with a breathtaking image of Raveena posing with her three daughters, all elegantly dressed in matching white traditional attires. In her emotional note shared along with the pictures, Raveena opened up about the challenges every mother faces as her children mature and embark on their own paths. “How fast the time and tide carries us they, and then time to fly the nest. Most heartbreaking time for Moms to let go, they’ve been your, your focus of even everyday mundane things that now will seem so so precious,” Raveena wrote. She also extended her gratitude to her followers, asking them to shower her children with love and blessings, stating, “But then, give them wings, watch them fly.. with all the love and blessings of us and yours my dear insta fam… love them like your own.” See the post here: Raveena tied the knot with Indian film distributor, Anil Thadani on February 22, 2004. The couple welcomed their daughter, Rasha in 2005, followed by the birth of their son, Ranbir in 2005. Prior to her marriage, in 1995, Raveena adopted Pooja and Chhaya, as a single mother when they were 11 and 8 years old respectively. Meanwhile, on the professional front, Raveena recently appeared in the film Ghudchadi alongside actor Sanjay Dutt. Up next, she is set to reunite with Akshay Kumar in the upcoming comedy Welcome to the Jungle, directed by Ahmed Khan. The film also boasts a star-studded cast including Disha Patni, Sanjay Dutt, Arshad Warsi, Lara Dutta and Paresh Rawal, among others. Reportedly, Welcome to the Jungle was scheduled to be released on December 20, 2025. However, the recent removal of the announcement video has sparked speculation that the film might be facing some challenges.",

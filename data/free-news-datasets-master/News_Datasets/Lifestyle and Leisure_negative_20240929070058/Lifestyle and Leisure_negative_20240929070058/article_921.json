    "text": "As we eagerly await the return of [Selling Sunset](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/selling-sunset-season-eight/) for its eighth (yes, really!) season, we've obviously been doing our due diligence and refreshing our minds on all of the iconic cast members of the hit reality show. We've been reminding ourselves [who's beefing with who](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/selling-sunset-cast-who-is-still-friends/), [who's dating who](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/how-many-of-the-selling-sunset-cast-has-jason-dated/) and who's BFFs with who. Now, if you cast your minds back to series six, you'll remember that that there had been concerns from fans that without Selling Sunset’s resident villain, [Christine Quinn](https://graziadaily.co.uk/celebrity/news/christine-quinn-selling-sunset-left-oppenheim-group/) ( [who left at the end of series five](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/is-christine-quinn-returning-to-selling-sunset/#/)), the show could be entering its flop era. But thankfully season six had some of the best drama we’ve had yet and this is, in part, thanks to new recruit [Bre Tiesi](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/who-is-selling-sunsets-bre-tiesi/). The agent joined [the Oppenheim Group](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/selling-sunset-celebrity-clients/) with a ‘don’t give a fuck’ attitude and a backstory which is quite simply written for reality television. Not only was she six-weeks postpartum when she strutted into the infamous industrial chic Oppenheim Group office, she had also just given birth to Nick Cannon’s eighth child. When Grazia caught up with Bre just days after her Selling Sunset debut in 2023, she set the record straight about opinions on what she describes as her ‘unconventional’ relationship with Nick Cannon - who has twelve children in total with six women - two of which are with Mariah Carey. Bre and Nick's son Legendary Love Cannon was born in June last year. ‘I've been getting ripped apart for the last almost two years now. Because of who my partner is,’ she told us when we chatted to her last year. ‘But I think for me, I'm so secure in my in my relationship with my partner and who I am as a person, I just can't let it affect me. Obviously, it's not always fun, you know, it is hard to hear 24/7 that your partner's a player or you're crazy, you're brainwashed, all the awful things that people say because they don't understand. They obviously don't know the ins and outs, they don't know the details. They don't understand how we do things and why it works. Nor do I care to explain any of that. So I never will.’ Having first been approached to join the show in 2020, Bre finally felt the time was right to film last year, despite having given birth six weeks before filming started. It was a wrench to be away from her son, not least because she was breastfeeding and determined to continue. Indeed, during one scene in series six, episode two, Bre uses a breastpump at her desk. This was an intentional move, to do it on camera. ‘I felt like it was really my identity, especially in that moment, this was something I was really going through,' she shared. '[It was] something that was so new to me, and something that as women, we’re often shamed for doing what is completely natural. Yeah. And as everyone can tell, I don’t live my life the way people want me to. So I wanted to be very open with my [breastfeeding] journey, and how I felt about it, and that it’s okay, and we should be embraced. And I’m not going to go either in a room to feed my child or a bathroom or any of those places, and you have a problem with it. I do not care. It was very important for me.’ The rest of the team, said Bre, was very supportive, and she has grown particularly close with [Chrishell Stause](https://graziadaily.co.uk/celebrity/news/chrishell-stause-interview/) and [Emma Hernan](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/emma-hernan-selling-sunset-age-boyfriend-vegan-business/), however she’s openly not a fan of Chelsea or Nicole Young. And (like the rest of us) she is slightly confused by the appeal of [Jason Oppenheim](https://graziadaily.co.uk/celebrity/news/jason-oppenheim-regrets-selling-sunset-2/), who has dated three of the agents on the show: Chrishell, Nicole and [Mary Fitzgerald](https://graziadaily.co.uk/celebrity/news/selling-sunset-mary-romain/). ‘It's very funny to me. I don't necessarily understand it,' said Bre, laughing. 'But you know, most of the girls work well together. They're not bothered. I'm not bothered. He collects quality women. That's what Jason does!’ Of course no Selling Sunset agent would fit in without an impossibly tiny and expensive wardrobe, and Bre admitted that she came prepared to serve looks. She says she had a ‘business forward’ brief on her moodboard she worked on with her stylist (though it’s hard to imagine anyone dressing like these women do for any other day job). It’s part of the camp fun though! Bre agreed, ‘I’m obsessed with fashion, and there is pressure to bring the outfits and dress a certain kind of way.’ She admits that she works with a stylist, though not all of them do. ‘I tried to really channel how I would actually dress at the office with a little bit of flair and how I would dress out in public, but also how I would dress my postpartum body.’ We have no doubt that series eight of Selling Sunset will be bigger and better than ever - especially when it comes to the outfits. And the drama of course!",

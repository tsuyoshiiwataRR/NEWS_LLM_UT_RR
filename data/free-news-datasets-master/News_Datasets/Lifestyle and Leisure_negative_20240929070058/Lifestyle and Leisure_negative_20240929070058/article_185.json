    "text": "How to Do It is Slate’s sex advice column. Have a question? [Send it to Jessica and Rich here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdx34-uOijrCIKqMdw5hnyYahSJBKa4AaSzDCu1nfcpmd3IjA/viewform). It’s anonymous! Dear How to Do It, I’m a 34-year-old woman, and I’ve been dating Dave (33 M) for a few months. The sex has generally been good, but we do have an issue I was hoping you could help with. I have a tattoo on my lower abdomen. It’s a little stick figure pushing a lawnmower right above where I keep my pubic hair trimmed like he’s shaving it off. I think it’s cute. Dave thinks it’s hilarious and will occasionally burst into bouts of giggling when he sees it. It totally kills the mood when we’re getting down and dirty, and it happens maybe one-third of the time we have sex. And when I say “kills the mood” I don’t just mean it takes one or both of us out of it. It often kills his erection and he starts telling jokes instead of continuing. Then I start laughing too, and while it is nice, it’s not sex. I’d have thought our time together would acclimate him to it, but he finds it as hilarious as the first time we slept together, and I see no sign of it getting better anytime soon. Is there a way I can get him to stick to sex when we’re actually having sex? —Tattoo Trouble Rich Juzwiak: As usual, I would like to know a little bit more information. If they’ve been dating for a few months, we can assume that they’re probably having a decent amount of sex. This is cutting into sex a third of the time. What does that actually look like? Are they having sex twice a week instead of three times a week? I think that information would help us understand the stakes here. Because if you’re just having a fun, nice time and you’re still having regular sex, well, I understand it’s a distraction, but unless you want to take the obvious route of removing the tattoo to remove the laughter, it seems like something to just roll with. Jessica Stoya: For a moment, I thought maybe crotchless panties that over the tattoo would work, but then I figured Dave would probably also find those really funny. Rich: We’ve talked about laughing and smiling during sex before, which I really enjoy. I think it’s great to have that. I wish that our writer could see and understand that, and translate that dynamic into fun sex. I understand that the issue here is a repeated distraction, but sometimes that happens. Is it that difficult to get back into it once you’ve been pulled out of the mood by some laughter? Not for me. Jessica: But apparently for Dave, it is really hard to return to sex mode. The fact that Dave, who is in his mid-30s, finds this so entertaining may point to a general youthfulness in his personality that the author might want to really consider the long-term ramifications of and benefits of. Rich: Right. Jessica: No relationship has everything. For me personally, I would rather have a really joyful relationship that contains spontaneity and playfulness than have one where that energy is absent, but you have consistent, reliable sex that is not interrupted by mirth. Our writer has to kind of decide for themselves: What trade are they willing to make here? Rich: Yes, and I would say go where the wind blows during this situation. If this is a moment where you’re about to have sex and then you start laughing about that tattoo and you both forget about sex because you’re no longer horny, then it makes sense to not have sex at that moment. It kind of works itself out. But if Dave is laughing and our writer is still horny and his dick isn’t hard, and for whatever reason it’s not responsive to further trying, then just say, “We’re supposed to have sex. I understand we’re doing something different now. How about if we just hang out and you can help me get off? Because I’m still horny, so kiss me, finger me, do something next to me. We’ll still have the experience, it won’t be intercourse per se, but it’ll be something, and that way I’ll get off and you being soft won’t be an issue.” Jessica: Yes. Rich: Also, I have to wonder how much they’ve actually talked about this. Is this something that’s happened that she’s been silently stewing about the whole time, or have they talked about strategies? Because it seems like he should at least be amenable to her saying, “Look, this has become a distraction, I’m not really into that. What can we do about that? Can you not look at it? Could I cover it in some way? I could get a temporary tattoo. I could totally cover it up. Can I turn around so you can’t see it? We have all of these options.” Jessica: They can turn the lights off, too. Rich: All of this stuff is doable. But I’m going to ultimately say that laughter in a relationship, wherever you find it, is not a bad thing. Sex is good, laughter is good. You don’t want your ratios to get too unbalanced, but in general, if you’re having regular sex, you’re laughing sometimes, and sometimes the laughing takes over the sex, then you’re still having sex. So I have to wonder how big of a deal it actually is in the grand scheme of things. But also, there are so many other options. So first, talk to him and see what you can do. Say: “This is distracting, it’s actually starting to bother me. What can we do about it? Can we laugh a little bit less about this?” Jessica: Then work out solutions together that both people are on board with. Rich: Yeah, exactly. If he’s not willing to do that, well, that’s data. Again, use this as a kind of litmus test. You’ve been seeing him for a few months, and now you’ve come upon an issue. Is he willing to solve that issue with you? That can indicate how strong the partnership is as a preview for the future. Jessica: Yeah, both his behavior and the ability of the two of them to work together will be more apparent after our writer starts tackling this. More Advice From Slate I’m in my early 40s and dating again, and I’ve discovered something a little unnerving about myself. After deciding I wanted a partner, the last three men I’ve had sex with over the last couple of months (I’m a woman) have all been great in bed. However, none of them have put a condom on after I’ve asked them to when we’re getting naked the first time. [They acknowledge I’ve said it, and I’m holding a condom out, but then they go down on me or do something else amazing and I’m instantly into it and I don’t care about anything else.](https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/03/men-condoms-request-sex-advice.html)",

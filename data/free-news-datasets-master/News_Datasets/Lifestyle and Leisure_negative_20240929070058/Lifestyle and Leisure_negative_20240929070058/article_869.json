    "text": "Video: Woman does yoga with snakes in California studio, slammed A woman was criticised on social media after a video of her performing 'snake yoga' at a studio in California went viral. Listen to Story In Short - Woman criticised for 'snake yoga' in California - Video by content creator Jen Zhang went viral - Social media users called it 'animal abuse' A woman was brutally slammed by social media users for doing ‘snake yoga’ at a studio in California. Jen Zhang, a content creator from Los Angeles, documented her experience in a video on Instagram that has gone viral with close to one million views. In the video, Zhang was seen practising yoga on a mat in the studio with a snake coiled around her neck. Ahead of the yoga session spanning over an hour, she was instructed regarding the procedure that involved non-toxic ball pythons. “This is the only place where you can do snake yoga. It is an hour-long experience where you are paired with your own snake, and you do a snake incorporated yoga routine. I thought it sounded absolutely insane. So, I booked it immediately. When you get there, your instructor and snake handler will give a hands-on rundown on how to handle the snakes properly. Then, you pick a gem randomly. Each one corresponds to one of their eight snakes, and you get to keep the gem as a souvenir. These are non-toxic ball pythons,” she said in the video. Describing her experience, Zhang said that though she was nervous in the beginning, she was eventually able to concentrate. “I am low-key, a little scared of snakes and have never held one before, so I didn’t know how this was going to go. I started out pretty nervous. But just in case, snakes can smell fear. I compartmentalised that fear to the back of my soul and definitely got comfy as the class went on. It helps that snakes are super slow. They are also under three pounds and are very smooth and gentle compared to snakeless yoga. I felt a lot more concentrated,” she added. Watch the video here: Social media users, however, were furious and said that this was nothing but “animal abuse”. “Stop treating animals like commodities or accessories (sic),” a user said, while others emphasised that this isn’t yoga at all. “There is NO animal companionship in yoga. Call it stretching with snakes, but it’s not yoga at all. Do some research before blatantly disrespecting an ancient wellness practice (sic).” “Personally, I don't agree with using animals in yoga. They're not an exercise accessory and add unnecessary risk (sic),” a comment reads. Also called the royal python, the ball python is a species native to West and Central Africa, where it lives in grasslands, shrubs and forests.",

    "text": "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has confirmed that new signing Mikel Merino will miss ‘a few weeks’ after sustaining a shoulder problem in training.\nThe Spain international signed for Arsenal from Real Sociedad for a fee that could reach £31.6m earlier this week but has suffered a setback in training.\nArteta has revealed that Merino has injured his shoulder during a training ground ‘collision’ with Gabriel Magalhaes on Thursday and is expected to miss the next few weeks, due to a ‘small fracture’.\nMerino will miss ‘a few weeks’ “Very unfortunate. Yesterday he had a collision and he has a shoulder injury. It looks like he’s going to be out for a few weeks,” Arteta said at his pre-match press conference ahead of facing Brighton this weekend.\n“He was really excited and everything was looking really good. He landed on the floor and Gabi [Gabriel Magalhaes] landed on top of him and it looks like he has a small fracture probably.”\nArteta discusses Aaron Ramsdale exit Arteta also thanked Aaron Ramsdale for his service at Arsenal after the goalkeeper signed for Southampton. The England international has joined the Saints for a fee that could reach £25m, having lost his place as first-choice goalkeeper to David Raya.\nArteta said Ramsdale ‘brought a lot of joy and charisma’ to the dressing room during his time at the Emirates.\n“Thank you so much for what he’s done for the club, for the team and for myself,” Arteta said.\n“He brought a lot of joy and charisma and was really good when he joined.\n“He had a situation that was really good for him. He insisted that he’s really joyful when he plays and we tried to arrange that.”\nRead – Deadline Day: The most surprising deals in Premier League history\nSee more – Deadline Day: Five unforgettable transfer stories\nFollow The Football Faithful on Social Media: Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube | TikTok",

    "text": "Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:\nULTA) trimmed its forecast for full-year and missed on both revenue and profit consensus for the second quarter.\nShares of the company fell nearly 7% in post-market trading on Thursday. Stock closed +0.2% at $367.58 before the report.\nThe company now expects 2024 net sales between $11B and $11.2B, from $11.5B to $11.6B previously forecast. The midpoint of the sales range is $11.1B, which is below the consensus estimate of $11.5B.\nIt also guided earnings per share to $22.60 to $23.50, from $25.20 to $26.00. The midpoint of the new range is $23.05, which is below the $25.06 estimate.\nUlta now expects comparable sales for the year to be negative 2% to 0%, revised from the prior guidance of 2% to 3% growth.\nIn Q2, comparable sales fell 1.2% vs. the Bloomberg consensus estimate of 1.3% growth. The decline was driven by a 1.8% decrease in transactions and a 0.6% increase in average ticket, the company said.\n\"While we are encouraged by many positive indicators across our business, our second quarter performance did not meet our expectations, driven primarily by a decline in comparable store sales. We are clear about the factors that adversely impacted our store performance, and we have actions underway to address the trends,‚Äù CEO Dave Kimbell said.\nNet income for the three months ended June 30 was $252.6M, compared with $300.1M for the same period a year earlier.\nOn a per-share basis, the company earned $5.30, missing the average analyst expectations by 15 cents.\nRevenue rose 4% to $2.6B but missed the consensus mark by $10M.\nMore on Ulta Beauty\nUlta Beauty: Quality Business And No FCF Growth Priced In Ulta Beauty: Buffett's Stamp Of Approval Ulta Beauty: No Change In Fundamental Prospects Despite Berkshire Hathaway's Position Ulta Beauty GAAP EPS of $5.30 misses by $0.15, revenue of $2.6B misses by $10M Ulta Beauty Q2 2025 Earnings Preview",

    "text": "As every reader must know by now, Kody Brown no longer has any sister wives. Over the past two years or so, Christine, Meri and Janelle Brown have ALL walked away from their spiritual spouses. With [Kody feeling openly betrayed by their actions](https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/kody-brown-plays-the-victim-whines-on-sister-wives-ive-been-betrayed/), a brand new report has left us wondering: Might Kody Brown soon have no wives at all?!? The father of 17 has been legally married to Robyn Brown since 2014, and all three of the aforementioned ex-spouses have cited how deeply Kody cares for her as a major reason for their decision to leave. But all is no longer peachy keen between the pair. Robyn reportedly feels pretty [dumb for sticking with Kody](https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/robyn-brown-am-i-an-idiot-for-sticking-with-kody/) — and we now have a reason to believe she may be done with the selfish plural marriage fan as well. According to In Touch Weekly, [Robyn and Kody have listed](https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/sister-wives-robyn-and-kody-brown-list-flagstaff-house-for-sale-excl/) their Flagstaff, Arizona, home for sale; they’re asking $1,650,000 for the residence. The house was built in 2007 sits on a two-acre wooded lot “tucked away behind towering pines on a secluded ridge,” the listing posted on Thursday, August 29, reads. The 4,476-square-foot house includes five bedrooms and four bathrooms. There’s also “primary bedroom with a luxurious, spa-like en-suite bathroom, complete with a large dual-head shower and built-in shelving in the walk-in closet,” the huge kitchen comes with a double oven, a commercial-size refrigerator/freezer and a walk-in pantry. Other amenities include a game room, two laundry rooms and an extra-wide garage. It’s unclear what is going on here. However, this real estate news comes amid speculation that [Robyn is miserable in her marriage](https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/08/robyn-brown-miserable-on-the-verge-of-leaving-kody/). “Robyn and Kody are not doing well. They have been very unhappy… [and] it’s getting worse,” a source said just this week to The Sun. The main reason behind the tension, per this same tabloid? Kody is “just really mad at the world right now. He’s not who he used to be at all. He’s completely changed. He’s angry and he’s volatile, and he doesn’t like anybody that’s not worshiping him.” Previously, Robyn confessd that she’s been shocked and saddened by the end of her plural family. She’s been candid about her mental state. Heck, [she even compared it to a death](https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2023/12/robyn-brown-im-mourning-the-death-of-my-plural-marriage/). “I don’t know what to do with it. It’s messing with my identity,” she said on the latest Sister Wives One-on-One special before bursting into tears. Will Robyn actually take same step as Meri, Christine and Janelle? We doubt it, but Kody is “controlling so much of her life right now” that it has made her “not happy,” The Sun also wrote a couple days ago. “Robyn is not committed to staying if things don’t change. That’s just what it has come down to. Their marriage is not going to sustain this kind of control,” the insider concluded.",

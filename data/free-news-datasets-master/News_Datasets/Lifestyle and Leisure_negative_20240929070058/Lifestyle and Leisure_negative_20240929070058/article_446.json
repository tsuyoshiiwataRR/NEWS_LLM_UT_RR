    "text": "Browse over 9,000 car reviews My [2018 diesel Ford Everest](/ford/everest) with 114,000km stopped 80km after a Ford service. They are saying the motor needs replacing. Is this a possibility? They are quoting $15,000 to $16,000 to replace. I find it difficult to believe this could happen after a service with no issues and no warning lights. It doesn’t sound right, does it? While it’s possible for an engine to be perfect one minute and blown up the next, you’d expect some sort of warning that this was about to happen. Which begs the question of why didn’t the [Ford](/ford) mechanic spot that there was a problem. Probably the best advice is to have the engine independently inspected to find out what broke or went wrong. From there, you can work out whether you were just unlucky, or the dealership missed something or somehow contributed to the engine’s demise. For the record, these engines won’t tolerate being drained of oil for more than about ten minutes. Due to the design of the oil pump, leaving the engine drained for more than that length of time means the pump won’t work when the engine is restarted and the engine will blow up soon after. Plenty of mechanics have been caught out by this, but surely not a Ford dealership…",

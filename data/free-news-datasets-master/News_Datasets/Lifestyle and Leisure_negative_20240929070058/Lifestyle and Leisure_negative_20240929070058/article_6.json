    "text": "Bills star Josh Allen reacts to being voted most overrated QB by NFL players\nBy the Numbers\nBuffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen was named the most overrated quarterback in a recent ESPN poll of 103 NFL players, receiving 11 votes. He acknowledged the criticism during an interview, stating he isn't bothered by the opinions of players outside his team but expressed disappointment over not being invited to participate in the survey himself. Despite leading the league in turnovers since 2018, Allen has been recognized for his performance, being a two-time Pro Bowler and ranking among the top quarterbacks in passing yards and touchdowns in the 2023 season.\n- Josh Allen has 102 turnovers since his rookie year, the most in the NFL.\n- In the 2023 season, he ranked top five with 4,306 passing yards and 29 touchdown passes.\n- Allen was also voted the best trash-talker with 27 votes, well ahead of Baker Mayfield's 16.\n- In the poll for the top NFL quarterback, he ranked fourth behind Mahomes, Jackson, and Burrow.\nIf Allen can lead the Bills back to the playoffs this year with a revamped offense, he may gain respect from his peers and shift perceptions about his capabilities.Bottom Line\nDespite being tagged overrated, Allen's impressive stats and performance illustrate that he remains a top-tier quarterback in the league, showcasing the disparity between peer perception and on-field results.\nRead more at\n CBSSports.com\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

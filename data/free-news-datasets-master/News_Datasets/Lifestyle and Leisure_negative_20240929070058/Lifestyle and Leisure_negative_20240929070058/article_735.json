I told you to come in it can happens for some touch ups. The tattoo is not even healed.\"\nBhabie then said part of her portrait's eye and lip \"came off\" and told the worker, \"You sound like you have no idea about how tattoos work.\"\nShe ended her string of IG Story posts by saying she was told the tattoo had to be large to replicate the photo.\nBhabie also said she felt \"sabotaged\" because the artist had done beautiful portraits in the past.\nAs for Le Vaughn's tattoo, the\nsocial media star got a portrait of Bhabie that showed her looking off to the side with a finger on her bottom lip.\nBhabie seemed to love the tattoo as she shared photos of her boyfriend's leg on Snapchat, adding the caption, \"I c me.\"\nThe couple began dating in July 2020 and\nwelcomed their daughter, Kali, in March.\nBefore the portrait, she got a tattoo of the number \"1111,\" which represents Le Vaughn's birthday, November 11.\nTROUBLE IS PARADISE\nThe couple's new tattoos come roughly one month after things didn't appear to be going as smoothly for the couple.\nIn early July, the rapper shared a video that appeared to show her and Le Vaughn in a\nphysically violent altercation, according to TMZ.\nIn the clip, Le Vaughn pushed her to the ground and pressed his knee into her back.\nThere were also pictures of her with swollen black eyes and facial bruises posted to her\n\"This man thinks he is gonna take my daughter from me!!! Say whatever you want, tryna take my baby is crazy,\" she wrote in the caption.\nAfter one person showed concern in the comments, Bhabie insinuated the two would most likely break up.\n\"I wasn't gonna speak on this but who said I was staying?\" she said.\nRead More on The US Sun\n\"What about that post made y'all think I'm staying? Bc I said I love him? Bc I said he's gonna get help? I'm so confused and apparently so are y'all.\"\nThe photos and video have since been removed from the platform.",

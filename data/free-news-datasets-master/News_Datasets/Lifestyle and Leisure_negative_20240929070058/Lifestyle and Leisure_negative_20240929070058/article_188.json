    "text": "The Big Brother 26 cast sent another houseguest home on Thursday night.\nT’Kor Clottey completed her week as the Head of Household, but it’s hard to call it a success.\nWhile she remained safe for another week, T’Kor became the HOH without having a real eviction target.\nAs such, T’Kor’s plans never seemed clear during the week, even as the latest eviction night approached.\nCam Sullivan-Brown had been on the block but won the Week 6 Power of Veto.\nThe final nominees for the week (and the people at risk of going home) were Tucker Des Lauriers, Angela Murray, and Makensy Manbeck.\nBig Brother 26, Episode 21 recap Host Julie Chen Moonves welcomed fans to the August 29 episode. The narrator joked that Tucker had been the Instigator, but Angela instigated her way onto the block.\nOne of them would head home soon if Makensy found a way to win the Week 6 AI Arena Challenge. Let’s see how it went!\nThe fallout from the recent Veto Meeting was also shown. Tucker was upset that Angela was placed on the block instead of Leah Peters.\nTucker was also upset with Angela because he had warned Angela that people thought she was the Instigator, and then Angela tried to turn people against Tucker.\nAngela turned on everyone after she got placed on the block. She revealed every person she had worked with and new alliances she had joined. It was pure chaos.\nJoseph Rodriguez tried to play catchup after escaping solitary confinement with Matt Hardeman. Makensy also got clued into alliances she didn’t even know existed.\nCheslie Baham and Cam discussed trying to flip the vote and evict Tucker if he failed to win the AI Arena Challenge. Meanwhile, Tucker tried to (finally) secure a final two agreement with Rubina.\nKimo is me during Angela’s drama moment. #BB26 pic.twitter.com/QLSKLkHRg5\n— travis’s video soul. (@travisfromdabk_) August 30, 2024 Who won the Week 6 AI Arena Challenge on Big Brother 26? Tucker won his first two times in the AI Arena; Makensy has also won an AI Arena Challenge. But with no real target from the HOH this week, they each knew the importance of winning it this time.\nAngela, Tucker, and Makensy had to complete a puzzle to learn a password (in numbers). They then had to find the correct password from a wall of choices. The first one to complete it all would win safety.\nMakensy dominated the August 29 AI Arena Challenge. She was safe for the week.\nMAKENSY is a fighter damn! You can’t get rid of her fr\n#BB26 pic.twitter.com/1r0bKMr5DV\n— Mel ✨ (@melbrown00) August 30, 2024 Who got voted out and finished 11th place on Big Brother 26? The houseguests had to decide if they were sending Tucker or Angela home.\nWould Chelsie and Cam try to pull off a shocking plan to send Tucker home? Or would it be a house vote against Angela without the drama?\nAngela jumped in quickly to find support (after the AI Arena Challenge). Tucker also began asking for votes. Before the vote, Tucker told Angela he felt people were keeping her.\nBelow is how the eviction vote played out Thursday night:\nRubina voted to evict Angela. Chelsie voted to evict Tucker. Kimo voted to evict Angela. Joseph voted to evict Angela. Leah voted to evict Tucker. Makensy voted to evict Tucker. Quinn voted to evict Tucker. Cam voted to evict Tucker. Tucker Des Lauriers was evicted on a 5-3 vote. He finishes in 11th place this summer.\nMore from the Big Brother 26 season Angela Murray’s daughter wanted her to escape a “nightmare” in the house. She posted about it on social media.\nJoseph Rodriguez has a huge crush and is struggling. He talked about the crush on the Live Feeds.\nMakensy blamed two players for her terrible gameplay . She claims it was their fault that she was on an island in the house.\nPrevious episodes of Big Brother 26 are streaming on Paramount+.\nBig Brother 26 airs on CBS during Summer 2024.",

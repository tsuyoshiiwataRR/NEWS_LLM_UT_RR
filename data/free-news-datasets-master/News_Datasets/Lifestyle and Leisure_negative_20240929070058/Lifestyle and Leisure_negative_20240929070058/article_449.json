    "text": "Kareena Kapoor Khan caught everyone’s attention after the actress shared Clint Eastwood’s quote about not seeking luxury through money but via the small joys in life. The actress is receiving backlash for endorsing not chasing luxury although her wealth includes her husband, Saif Ali Khan’s palace!\\nThe quote shared by Kareena on Instagram read, “Don’t look for luxury in watches or bracelets, don’t look for it in mansions or sailboats; luxury is laughter and friends, luxury is not being sick, luxury is the rain on your face, and luxury is hugs and kisses. Don’t look for luxury in stores or in gifts, don’t look for it in parties or events. Luxury is that people love you, luxury is that they respect you, luxury is that your parents live, luxury is being able to play with your grandchildren, luxury is those little things that cannot be bought with money.”\\nKareena shared the post with the caption, “Read it again and again (red heart emoji).” This found its way on Reddit where people slammed the actress for her ‘hypocrisy’. One person wrote, “Made me laugh. People living in luxury talking about how luxury is not the most important thing in life.” Another added, “No hate or jealousy here but I always find it funny (and tone-deaf) when people who are uber-rich post about how money is not everything in life. I mean if you had gotten the short end of the stick in life, surely ‘materialistic’ things would be first on your list.”\\nOne person wrote, “As Micheal Corleone said in Godfather 2, ‘This contempt for money is just another trick of the rich to keep the poor without it.’” Another added, “The irony. This woman has Pataudi Palace and goes to Gstaad every year.” “They live in their own bubble. Take luxury out of their lives then we’ll see,” a comment read. “This is like the thing where people with money preach of money not giving you happiness and people with things preaching abt minimalism. This is a luxury. Money gives you that luxury to talk sh*t like this,” read another comment.\\nMeanwhile, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Hansal Mehta recently announced the release date of their long-awaited film, The Buckingham Murders. Kareena confirmed that The Buckingham Murders will be a theatrical release. She revealed that The Buckingham Murders will be released on September 13. The film will take the slot left empty by Sara Ali Khan’s Metro In Dino, which also stars Aditya Roy Kapur.",

    "text": "Vivian McDonald\nAugust 23, 2024\nVivian McDonald (nee Krause), age 84, passed away on August 23, 2024, in long term care near her daughters in Ontario. Born at home in Gravelbourg, SK, she moved to Edmonton in the early 1960s then proudly resided in Calgary for over 50 years. Vivian supported the community, and donated countless hours to Calgary Meals on Wheels, Girl Guides, the Canadian Cancer Society and the Diabetes Association.\nViv was an independent woman, who loved family, the Calgary Flames, and having a laugh. She raised her children through hard work and by putting herself through school, and was strong for them until the end. She is survived by many siblings, her children Mary Lou, Diane and Brian, and their families and loved ones.\nThe family will hold a private gathering for Vivian, and wish to thank the caregivers at Friendly Manor for all their care and love. Donations can be made in honour of Vivian to Calgary Meals on Wheels.\nPublished online August 30, 2024\nSend Flowers: When Is the Ordering Deadline?\nANY DAY OF THE WEEK\nOrder any time up till the day before\nMON-FRI Order by 2:00PM\nSAT & SUN Order by noon\nTUES-SAT\nOrder by 3:00PM\nThe day before\nSAT & SUN Order by Saturday\nNote: These are general guidelines; some florists may not be able to operate within these timelines.

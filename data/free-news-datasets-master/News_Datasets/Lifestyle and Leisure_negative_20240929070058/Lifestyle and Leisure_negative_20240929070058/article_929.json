    "text": "If there’s one thing that you’re DEFINITELY going to experience in Disney World , it’s lines!\nRemy’s Ratatouille Adventure always has long lines Those queues come in all shapes and sizes. You’ve got the attractions that you basically walk right onto, and you’ve got the rides that you might spend half of your day in. And you’ve got some truly “special” lines that are just plain terrible (and we can’t overstate it)! So let’s talk about those queue lines and how you can avoid them!\nAs we were saying, it’s amazing just how terrible some Disney World lines are, so let’s talk about those lines and the best ways to avoid them!\nSpace Mountain Space Mountain is a classic, right, but its line? Not so much.\nThe Space Mountain line is LONG To be fair, it’s one of the fewer queues that has A/C (which is so nice in the Florida heat), but since the queue is indoors, it means that when people get loud (and believe me, they will), the sound bounces off the walls and hits you from every angle. Also, the queue itself is incredibly long, which means that when the sound turns up, it’s like being trapped in a loud, never-ending tunnel.\nSpace Mountain line So, if this ride is a must-do for you (I mean, it’s basically a rite of passage), you’ll want to consider grabbing a Lightning Lane reservation or heading there first thing in the morning (rope dropping) as that can save you from the noise assault and shave off a good chunk of the waiting time.\nSoarin’ Around the World Soarin’ is one of those must-do rides that’s on everyone’s list, but let me tell you, the line is quite a “snoozefest.”\nSoarin’ It’s such a long queue from start to finish. It used to have some fun interactive games that helped everyone pass the time, but those are long gone. Now, it’s just you and your thoughts for what feels like forever.\nSoarin’ Queue The best way to avoid this potentially mind-numbing wait is to snag a Lightning Lane or head there late in the day when the crowds are thinner. Trust me, you do not want to spend an hour+ of your Disney World day staring at nothing but walls.\nAlien Swirling Saucers and Slinky Dog Dash The queues for these two rides in Toy Story Land can be quite “torturous” especially if you catch them on a hot day (which is basically everyday at Disney World).\nAlien Swirling Saucers Line There’s minimal shade, and when you’re stuck in the lines (which are almost always extremely long) for what feels like an eternity, you end up melting into the pavement.\nSlinky Dog Dash line. So, if you don’t want to become a human puddle, try to hit these rides early in the morning or during the evening when the sun isn’t as brutal. Lightning Lanes are also your best friend here, so don’t hesitate to use them.\nKilimanjaro Safaris Okay, so Kilimanjaro Safaris is amazing, there’s no denying it, but that line can stretch on for what feels like miles, especially during its peak times. And if it’s a hot day, forget about it. You’ll find yourself sweltering long before you even see the first animal.\nKilimanjaro Safaris Line What you’ll want to do to avoid the worst of it is to aim for a morning safari when the sun hasn’t turned the queue into an oven. Now, if you can’t make it early, go for the opposite end of the day or, of course, grab a Lightning Lane.\nMagic Carpets of Aladdin You know how Magic Carpets of Aladdin looks like it’s a quick and easy ride? Well, the ride alone is just that, but the queue is quite the sun trap. There’s almost no shade, which means you’ll be baking while you wait.\nMagic Carpets of Aladdin Honestly, unless this ride is a must-do for you, you’re probably better off skipping it especially if the line looks long. However, if you’re determined to ride it, you can try hitting it up during the fireworks when the crowds are significantly thinner, and the sun has finally set.\nHow to Avoid the Worst Lines Overall, the key to avoiding the worst of these lines is in your timing and planning. Lightning Lanes are going to be your go-to for skipping long waits, but if you’re not into paying extra, rope dropping or going late in the day can save you a ton of time and discomfort.\nSpace Mountain Now, specifically with Magic Kingdom rides, the fireworks are your best friend. While everyone’s watching the show, you can sneak in shorter lines and enjoy the cooler temps.\nMagic Kingdom fireworks Those are just a couple of our thoughts on the worst queue lines at Disney World, and now we want to hear from you!

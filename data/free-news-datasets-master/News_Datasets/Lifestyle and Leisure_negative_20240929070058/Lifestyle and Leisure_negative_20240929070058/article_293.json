    "text": "Naomi Watts is in the grieving phase as her grandmother, Nikki Roberts died at the age of 99 after suffering a massive stroke three weeks ago. Paying her tribute to her \"Nanna\", The Ring star took to social media and shared a series of different pictures of her. “She is such a huge part of who I am: her core values, her work ethic, and her mischievous humor and joy of life,” she captioned. Recalling her last conservation with her late grandmother, Naomi said it was on a video call on Aug, 26. \"We will miss you so much,” she continued. “I'll never forget her wicked laugh, her feisty spirit, her no-nonsense attitude, her no waste policy.\" “She'd be trimming the mold off the bread and cheese: ‘You don't need an expiration date — that's what a nose is for!’ Grannies are the greatest. May her stories and memories live on.” Under her post, Julianne Moore penned, “I’m so sorry for your loss. What a beautiful person.” “She's laughing with the angels. How blessed your family is to have had her,\" Glenn Close wrote.",

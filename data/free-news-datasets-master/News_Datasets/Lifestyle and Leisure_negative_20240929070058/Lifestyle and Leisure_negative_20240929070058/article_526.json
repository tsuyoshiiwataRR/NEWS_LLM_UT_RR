To manage the influx of tourists, some destinations like Barcelona have raised their tourist taxes.\nHolidu&apos;s research indicates that Dubrovnik is currently the world&apos;s most overcrowded tourist spot, with a ratio of 30 visitors to every local. But which other locations are known to be swamped in summer?\nSara Rodriguez, a seasoned traveller and the blogger behind Madrid Traveling, spoke to Express.co.uk about four places she found overwhelmingly crowded, reports the Express .\nPositano, Italy In the stunning Amalfi Coast of southern Italy lies Positano, a village famed for its breathtaking views and steep, cliffside buildings. Despite its beauty, Sara described the location as overly \"hectic\".\nShe said: \"While undeniably beautiful with its colourful buildings and seaside views, the narrow streets were packed shoulder to shoulder with other sightseers.\"\nShe added: \"The atmosphere felt more hectic than idyllic and prices were inflated for tourists. I left feeling like I never got to experience the real Positano beyond the chaotic surface.\"\nParis, France Paris, France , also made her list of excessively busy spots. The &apos;City of Love&apos;, Paris, might be a top choice for many European travellers, but visitors like Sara are reporting less-than-stellar experiences in the French city.\nShe expressed her frustrations: \"The congested boulevards of Paris and the never-ending line-ups at attractions like the Eiffel Tower and Louvre strained my patience. I didn&apos;t really enjoy the atmosphere as much as I was waiting to take shots.\"\nThis viewpoint resonates with other tourists on TripAdvisor, including one visitor to the Louvre Museum who shared: \"The art is crazy but the queues are insane. Two hours to access the museum and then you can barely walk due to the quantity of tourists. They should regulate this.\"\nAdding to the city&apos;s struggles with overtourism, the Olympics and Paralympics also drew large crowds this year. This surge comes despite the decision by Paris City Hall to hike up the tourist tax by 200 percent for 2024, a move meant to support Ile-de-France Mobilites, the body overseeing public transport including the metro and bus services, expected to ferry an increased number of passengers during the global event.\nMykonos, Greece Meanwhile, Greece&apos;s Mykonos sees its bustling tourist season between Greek Easter (April) and the end of October, reaching a peak between mid-July to late August. Despite the premium cost associated with staying on this picturesque Greek island, it continues to draw travellers of all ages, though its prices significantly outpace those of nearby locations like Syros.\nTourists at Niko&apos;s Taverna on Mykono, Greece (Image: Getty) Sara expressed her disappointment with the bustling atmosphere of popular destinations. She said: \"When I finally went to the Greek island, I thought it would be a tranquil haven. Even while it was breathtakingly gorgeous, I felt that partygoers and inebriated vacationers overshadowed it. The restaurants were expensive and the beaches were noisy.\"\nAmsterdam, The Netherlands Amsterdam , known for its dynamic culture, storied history, and picturesque canals, has been grappling with the issue of over-tourism. The city&apos;s 17th-century canal ring is a standout feature, creating an urban landscape unlike any other.\nAmsterdam (Image: Getty) However, despite its charm, Amsterdam&apos;s popularity means it&apos;s often crowded, especially given its relatively small size compared to London. Last year alone, the city saw 15.1 million day visitors, with around 60 percent being domestic tourists, as reported by the European Travel Information and Authorisation System.\nSara&apos;s experience in Amsterdam was less than ideal due to the congestion. She said: \"The city centre was overrun with rowdy bachelor parties riding bikes through crowded streets. The museums were packed and reservations at restaurants were impossible to get.\"\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

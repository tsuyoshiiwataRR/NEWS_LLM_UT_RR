    "text": "Andy Murray issues warning after US Open star appeared to aim dig at Emma Raducanu\nPA\nBy\n<a href=\"https://www.gbnews.com/authors/jack-otway\">Jack Otway\n</a>\n 11:54\nUpdated: 30/08/2024- 12:35\nCasper Ruud recently appeared to aim a dig at Emma Raducanu following his win over Gael Monfils.\nAnd Andy Murray has now sent a warning to the Norwegian, saying he could potentially suffer hip issues like himself after winning a stunning point against Gael Monfils.\nRuud beat Monfils on Wednesday, with the 25-year-old winning one point that saw him sprinting across the width of the court.\nSome fans then felt he aimed a dig at Raducanu, who had previously said the US Open 'didn't feel different' without Murray being there.\nAndy Murray has sent a warning to Casper Ruud after the Norwegian appeared to aim a dig at Emma Raducanu\nPA\nRaducanu was widely condemned for those comments, with some fans feeling she 'disrespected' Murray.\nRuud aimed his own thinly veiled dig by saying: \"A tribute point to @andy_murray, you‚Äôre missed over here!\"\nHe also accompanied his message with a winking emoji.\nMurray, writing on his own X account, has now replied - with the 37-year-old instead choosing to warn Ruud about his hips.\nJUST IN:\nJermaine Jenas update as U-turn on lifeline 'could be made' following BBC sacking\nLove to see it üòÑüòÑ what a point!‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äî Andy Murray (@andy_murray)\nWord of warning though‚Ä¶.Keep doing that for a few more years and you‚Äôll end up with hips like me too!\n [August 29, 2024]\n\"Love to see it, what a point! Word of warning though....Keep doing that for a few more years and you'll end up with hips like me too!\"\nFans were amused by Murray's take, with one user saying: \"He isn't leaving the hip joke anytime.\"\nA second said: \"Classic Scottish praise. Commendation, but with a cautionary tale of doom attached.\"\nA third reacted by saying: \"I remember many years ago in your first couple of years that Fed predicted your body wouldn't last long if you kept playing the same way. I think you went well beyond what he was expecting, but maybe in the end it caught up with you. You were amazing to watch Muzza!\"\nREAD MORE:\nEmma Raducanu 'facing sponsorship crisis' as details emerge after nightmare US Open exit\nAnd another user opined: \"All Your Fault Andy! If You Will Go Inspiring People! lol! BLESS!\"\nAs for Raducanu, the tennis star was tearful after her US Open exit at the hands of Sofia Kenin on Wednesday.\nHer schedule has raised eyebrows, with the 21-year-old opting to play in just one hard-court tournament before the competition.\nAnd Tim Henman, who previously backed that call, has now performed a U-turn by admitting she should potentially have played more.\nLATEST SPORTS NEWS:\n‚ÄúThis has all been a rebuilding process when she's coming back from the surgeries,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\"When she has played she has played very well.\n‚ÄúThat was a big chunk of the summer to miss.\nAndy Murray is yet to react to Emma Raducanu's elimination from the US Open\nREUTERS\n\"Obviously they were big tournaments and she wasn't a direct acceptance [into the main draw] but in hindsight she probably should have been in qualifying to get those match reps under her belt.\n‚ÄúShe's learning all the time and fingers crossed she's going to have many more opportunities here at the US Open in the future.\n\"I still think her game is moving in the right direction and there are still elements that she can do better.‚Äù",

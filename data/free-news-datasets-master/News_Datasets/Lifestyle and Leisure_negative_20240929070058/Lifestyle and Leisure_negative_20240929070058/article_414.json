    "text": "Leah Remini and her husband Angelo Pagán have announced their separation.\nThe King of Queens actress and the businessman took to Instagram to share their decision to end their marriage after 21 years.\n“Well, here we are. After 28 years together and 21 years of marriage, we have decided to file for divorce. This decision came after a lot of thought and care, and as hard as divorce is, we are approaching this with a positive outlook because we know it’s what’s best for us,” began their joint statement.\n“We are proud of how we have worked through this together. Yes, we’re sad, and we’ve got some figuring out to do as we continue to move forward into our new normal—together still in many ways, and apart in some new ones,” they added.\nThe couple mentioned that the primary reason for their split was the changes they have both gone through over the years.\n“Our bond is still strong—it’s just evolved into something different. We think a marriage that lasted this long and created so many beautiful memories, especially raising our incredible daughter, is something to celebrate. From our perspective, this marriage was a huge success. And now, we’re looking forward to creating even more cherished moments—just in a different way,” their statement continued.\nThey emphasized the importance of being transparent about their personal lives.\n“We are sharing this unknown territory with you all as we take our first steps into this next stage of our lives publicly. We would love for everyone to have more access to different kinds of relationship stories and not feel so isolated in navigating the changes that millions of couples make every year. We hope our journey can inspire others to see that relationships—whether they change or end—aren’t failures. We’ll keep sharing snippets of our lives as we navigate this new chapter,” the couple concluded in their statement.\nLeah Remini and Angelo Pagán were married in 2003 and have a daughter, Sofia Bella. Angelo Pagán also has three sons, Angelo Jr., Alex, and Nico, from a previous relationship.\nThe couple’s journey has been watched by many, and their decision to part ways marks the end of an era but also the beginning of a new chapter for both of them.\nTheir willingness to share their journey with the public may provide comfort and perspective to others going through similar experiences.\nSource: People",

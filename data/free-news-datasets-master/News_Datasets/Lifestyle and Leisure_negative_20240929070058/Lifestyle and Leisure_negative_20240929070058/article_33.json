    "text": "Kelsea Ballerini performs onstage during the 2024 CMA Music festival at the Nissan Stadium on June 07, 2024 in Nashville. Jason Kempin/Getty Images Kelsea Ballerini is asking fans for prayers and good thoughts for her dog Dibs, revealing that her beloved pooch has been diagnosed with cancer.\nBallerini wrote on her Instagram Stories on Wednesday (Aug. 28), “The last few days we have discovered that dibby has inoperable cancer in his heart. He’s not in pain and luckily it hasn’t spread further.”\nThe singer-songwriter adopted the dog in 2015, following the breakthrough success of her debut single “Love Me Like You Mean It.” Her cherished dog shares a name with her hit song “Dibs,” which became a No. 1 Billboard Country Airplay hit in 2016.

He is getting extra cuddles and kibbles from his little family.”\nBallerini, who will release her new album, Patterns , on Oct. 25, also told fans, “I feel pretty disingenuous promoting this album and tracklist reveal (which I am so, so proud of) without updating you on my sweet dibs health.” She added, “It’s a complex and emotional time. He’s been my baby and my steady for the last 9 years and very much alongside this whole journey with us all. I know so many of you care about him and are sending him prayers and love, and from my whole heart … thank you. He’s wagging his tail right now no doubt saying thank you too.”\nBallerini had previously shared days ago that Dibs was going through some hard times, with the musician sharing on Instagram that the dog had “made it through the night and is stable enough to run the tests we need to figure out our next steps.” In that same IG story, Ballerini said, “Thank you for all of the prayers and good energy. I made sure to tell him so many people love him and are thinking of him when I got to visit last night.”",

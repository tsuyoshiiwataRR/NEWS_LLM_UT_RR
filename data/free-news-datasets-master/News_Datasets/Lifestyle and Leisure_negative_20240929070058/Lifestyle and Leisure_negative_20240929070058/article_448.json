    "text": "Loose Steering Wheel: Causes & Solutions When your steering feels loose. Don’t panic or ignore it either, it means that your steering wheel has more play or movement than it should have before the wheels turn. The loose steering wheel can be caused by some basic problems. Let’s delve into this topic and find out the reason and solution for the issue. Understanding the Steering System Ever wondered how cars respond so well to the driver? it’s because of the steering system. Invented in the 50s of the 19th century, up to now, the car steering system is still constantly being improved to give a better driving experience to drivers. The car steering system plays a pivotal role in controlling the direction of the vehicle’s movement. The structure of the steering system is very complex, divided into many component clusters and parts but still interconnected and mutually supportive. A proper steering system mechanism is necessary to effectively control the vehicle with safety during its entire speed range without much effort. The structure of the steering system includes: - Steering wheel - Steering shaft and column - Tie rods, rack - Idler arms - Pitman’s arm - Drag or center link. Knowing the structure of the steering system will help you understand how important the steering wheel is in the steering system and the vehicle. The steering wheel is a part of the steering system, helping the driver easily change direction when driving and perform several other operations through basic buttons. So let’s move to the next part to find out what causes loose steering wheel ? >> Related post: Steering Wheel Returns To Center After Turn – Know The Reason Here! Why Does My Steering Wheel Feel Loose? Driving the loose steering wheel can feel wiggly or turn more readily (or farther) before the wheels react when the steering wheel is loose. This extra play or looseness can make the steering wheel feel unresponsive, vague, and less conducive to driver control. There are some common loose steering wheel symptoms you shouldn’t ignore: - Difficulty maintaining a straight path - Excessive play or movement in the steering wheel - Vehicle pulling to one side - Vibrations from the steering system What are the culprits behind these problems? - Over time, the various parts of your steering system can wear down causing excessive play in the wheel like a loose steering nut. The steering nut, which physically fastens the steering wheel to the steering column, is located behind or beneath the airbag. The steering nut can occasionally come loose. Worn ball joints are also the reason for the loose steering wheel. The steering system contains numerous ball joints. Ball joints provide a pivot point for each front wheel to pivot, or turn upon, as the steering system turns the front wheels left and right and the control arms move up and down. Ball joints are a significant part, but they deteriorate over time, they become loose which can create a vibration that you can feel through the floor or the steering wheel while you drive. - Broken pitman arm: Pitman arms connect the steering linkage to the steering column and support the other end of the linkage from the idler arm. This part typically lasts the lifetime of a car, but if one starts to deteriorate, it can cause everything to feel a little sloppy and impair steering. Additionally, improper wheel alignment can put added stress on the steering mechanism, resulting in a loose feeling when you turn. For hatchbacks or sedans, MC Pherson front suspension is often used, combined with a rack-and-pinion, hydraulic, or electric power steering system. This connection provides high performance and if the system fails, it is usually because the rotor is damaged or worn out. How To Fix Loose Steering Wheel?

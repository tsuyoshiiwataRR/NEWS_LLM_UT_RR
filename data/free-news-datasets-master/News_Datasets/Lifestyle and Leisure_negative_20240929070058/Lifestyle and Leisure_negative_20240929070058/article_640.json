    "text": "Key Takeaways - Diablo 4 players are divided on the new Baneful Hearts drop rates that are affecting Helltide events. - Update Patch 1.5.0 adjusted the parameters for earning Baneful Hearts, sparking mixed reactions. - Community is split over whether the Baneful Hearts tweak made Helltide less rewarding. The Diablo 4 community is split on the current drop rate of Baneful Hearts, the currency used in the endgame Helltide activity that received significant changes recently. [Diablo 4](https://gamerant.com/tag/diablo-4/)'s upcoming Vessel of Hatred expansion, which is set to come out on October 8, will feature a new endgame experience called The Dark Citadel. When Season 5 of Diablo 4 went live on August 6, it was accompanied by the popular dungeon crawler's 1.5.0 patch. In addition to introducing a host of new content, this update addressed a long list of issues and implemented tweaks to many of the game's parameters. [Diablo 4's Baneful Hearts currency](https://gamerant.com/diablo-4-where-get-use-baneful-hearts/) was affected by the update, with Patch 1.5.0 adjusting the way the special loot could be earned in the game. Nearly a month into Season of the Infernal Hordes, players are still divided on the changes made to Baneful Hearts. [Related ](/diablo-4-goblin-loot-disappearing-issue/) [ Diablo 4 Players Having Trouble With Goblin Loot Disappearing ](/diablo-4-goblin-loot-disappearing-issue/) Diablo 4 players are facing an issue with treasure goblins, as their precious loot is disappearing before players can collect it. In one recent discussion on Reddit, a user, Cross2Live, said that Season 4 gave players too many Baneful Hearts, but they added that the current drop rate for the item was also bad. The Baneful Hearts tweaks have supposedly made players more hesitant about using the item during [Diablo 4's region-wide Helltide events](https://gamerant.com/diablo-4-helltides-explained/). Baneful Hearts are used to initiate an Accursed Ritual and summon a Blood Maiden, which is a powerful mini-boss that drops high-quality loot. According to Cross2Live, many players nowadays simply circle around the Accursed Ritual altar and wait for someone else to use their Baneful Hearts so they can collect free items. Others, however, insisted that the new Baneful Hearts parameters were fine, with one community member even saying that they did not notice the changes made to the item. A user explained that Helltide simply evolved from a main farming activity to a side affair, resulting in fewer monsters being farmed and, in turn, less loot being distributed. Another user, meanwhile, pointed out that players can still collect plenty of Baneful Hearts by doing Helltide events, clearing enemies, and opening chests while under the effects of [Diablo 4's Profane Mindcage](https://gamerant.com/diablo-4-how-get-use-profane-mindcage/), an item that simultaneously makes enemies stronger and improves the quality of dropped loot. Blizzard Entertainment released [Patch 1.5.1 for Diablo 4](https://gamerant.com/diablo-4-season-5-hotfix-151-patch-notes/) on August 20, which mostly dealt with bugs and other issues, including one that caused players to lose Baneful Hearts when using Accursed Altars. It also made some tweaks to Diablo 4's new Infernal Hordes mode, as well as delivering a few quality-of-life improvements. Diablo 4 Baneful Hearts Changes in Patch 1.5.0 The way baneful hearts are earned has been adjusted. - Chance to get one from a Tortured gift starts at 15% and increases each time you fail to get one.

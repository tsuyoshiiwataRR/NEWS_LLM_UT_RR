    "text": "How to Get Rid of Meta AI Search on Facebook?\nIf you’re tired of Facebook’s Meta AI-powered search bar taking over your news feed, this article is for you. We’ll explore the reasons behind this new search feature and provide step-by-step guides on how to disable it.\nWhat is Meta AI Search?\nMeta AI search is a feature that uses artificial intelligence to analyze your search queries, identify patterns, and provide personalized search results. It’s designed to make your Facebook experience more relevant and efficient, but many users have raised concerns about the loss of control over their data.\nHow to Disable Meta AI Search on Facebook?\nDisabling Meta AI search on Facebook involves making a few tweaks to your settings. Follow these steps:\nTable of Contents\nToggle\nStep 1: Check if You Have the New Facebook Layout Step 2: Clear Cookies and Site Data Step 3: Disable the Search Bar Step 4: Opt-out of Custom Audiences Step 1: Check if You Have the New Facebook Layout\nOpen Facebook on your desktop or mobile device\nCheck if your Facebook layout resembles the following: A gray toolbar at the top with your name, profile picture, and a magnifying glass icon\nA blue sidebar on the left with the Meta AI search bar\nIf you have this layout, proceed to Step 2. If not, you don’t have the new search feature enabled, and you can skip to the conclusion section.\nStep 2: Clear Cookies and Site Data\nLog out of Facebook\nGo to your browser’s settings and search for \"cookies\"\nClear cookies, site data, and browsing history (ensure you have saved important logins or data first)\nThis step is crucial as Meta AI search stores user data on your browser to personalize search results. Clearing cookies will delete this data and disable the feature temporarily.\nStep 3: Disable the Search Bar\nLog back into Facebook\nClick on the three horizontal lines or the gear icon at the top-right corner (depending on your browser)\nClick on \"Settings\" and then \"General Account Settings\"\nScroll down to \"Apps, Websites, and Devices\"\nClick on \"Edit\" next to \"Apps, Websites, and Devices\" and toggle off \"Allow [Name] to read your search history\" and \"Allow [Name] to manage your search results\"\nThis will remove the Meta AI search bar and prevent the app from tracking your search queries.\nStep 4: Opt-out of Custom Audiences\nLog in to your Facebook Ads Manager account\nClick on \"Assets\" and then \"Data Sources\"\nFind your ad account and click on \"Edit\" next to \"Data Sources\"\nClick on \"Add Data Source\" and then \"Other Data Source\"\nFill out the required information, including your company name, industry, and data types you want to upload\nOpt-out of custom audiences, allowing Meta to use your search data for targeting purposes\nThis step ensures that your search data isn’t used for targeted advertising.\nHow to Revert to Classic Search on Facebook?\nReverting to classic search on Facebook requires changing your search preference. Here’s how:\nOpen Facebook and go to the search bar\nType a query in the search bar\nClick on the gear icon at the top-right corner\nClick on \"Settings\"\nSelect \"Search Settings\"\nChange \"Default Search Engine\" to \"Basic\"\nThis will restore the classic search engine and disable the Meta AI-powered search.\nCommon Issues and Troubleshooting Tips\nSearch bar won’t disappear: Try clearing browser cache, cookies, and site data (Steps 1-2). If the issue persists, contact Facebook support.\nCan’t find the settings option: Ensure you have the correct Facebook layout and search for \"Settings\" at the top-right corner or in your profile dropdown menu.\nIssues with custom audiences: Try revisiting your Ads Manager account and reviewing your data sources. If issues persist, contact Facebook support.\nConclusion\nBy following these steps, you should be able to disable Meta AI search on Facebook. Remember to clear cookies, disable the search bar, and opt-out of custom audiences to regain control over your data. Reverting to classic search will help you bypass the AI-powered search feature.\nKeep in mind that Meta AI search is designed to provide a personalized experience, so you may encounter some limitations by disabling it. However, by taking control of your data and settings, you can customize your Facebook experience to your preferences.\nSummary Table:\nStep\nDescription\n1\nCheck for new Facebook layout\n2\nClear cookies and site data\n3\nDisable the search bar\n4\nOpt-out of custom audiences\n5\nRevert to classic search (optional)\nRemember to review the issues and troubleshooting tips section if you encounter any difficulties during the process.",

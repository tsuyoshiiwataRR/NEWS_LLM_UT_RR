    "text": "The infamous Gallagher brothers, Liam and Noel, have put their legendary spat behind them, [revealing plans for a tour next year](https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/ticket-prices-oasis-live-25-9517393), ushering in waves of excitement among Oasis aficionados. Perhaps less well known is the fact that famously outspoken younger Gallagher brother Liam has also been involved in a spat with [pop sensation Peter Andre](https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/). Cast your mind back to 2007, when Liam was probed on ITV Mobile's The Hot Desk regarding which celebrity out of news icon Trevor McDonald, country legend Dolly Parton, and [the 'Mysterious Girl' vocalist](https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/peter-andre-shares-amazing-moment-9512399) he would choose to ignore, text, or work with. Liam, showcasing his characteristic style, answered: \"I'd call Trevor McDonald, I'd text Peter Andre and I'd ignore Dolly Parton. The only reason I'd text Peter Andre is to say, 'What the f*** are you on about man? Where'd you get my f***ing number from, you f***ing p***y c***?\" READ MORE Later that year, Peter told new! Magazine: \"I read somewhere that Liam Gallagher has been calling me all sorts of names. I found this quite surprising because when I last saw Liam he couldn't have been friendlier to me and Katie [Price]. \"I'd go as far as to say that he was totally up our backsides! We bumped into him at a Radio 1 event and he told us how great he thought we were and how his mother Peggy was a big fan. It's such a shame he was too much of a coward to tell us how he really felt to our faces instead of being two-faced. That man is all mouth and no trousers!\" Fifteen years after their disagreement, [reports OK!](https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/peter-andres-unlikely-bust-up-33547991) Peter wrote about how he and Liam had finally made amends in his column for new! In 2022, he said: \"Last week, the Loose Women were talking about unusual meetings with celebs. Coleen Nolan's was with Oasis's Noel Gallagher, who tapped her on the shoulder in Euston Station and said 'My mum would kill me if I didn't say hello to you!' \"It made me think of my encounter with Noel's brother, Liam Gallagher. He once said some harsh things about me in an interview. I took it on the chin, as I'd been told it's his nature. \"A while later, I bumped into him and he not only apologised, but praised me for being a great father and for my relationship with my kids. I didn't expect it! I knew about his 'tough guy' bravado, but we talked about our families. It was a bizarre encounter, but a good one.\" Somerset Live WhatsApp Breaking News and Top Stories Join Somerset Live’s WhatsApp community for top stories and breaking news sent directly to your phone [Somerset Live](https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/) is now on WhatsApp and we want you to join our community.

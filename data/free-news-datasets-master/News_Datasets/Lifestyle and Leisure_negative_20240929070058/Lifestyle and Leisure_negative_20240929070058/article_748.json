    "text": "We were all shocked when [Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury announced their split](https://www.netmums.com/life/mollie-mae-hague-and-tommy-fury-announce-shock-split) – and there's been no end of rumours about the break-up since. But now reality star and mum-of-one Molly-Mae has opened up about life in the past few weeks, as she addressed the break-up in her latest YouTube video. The 25 year old spoke about her 'coping mechanism' and exactly why she won't be discussing what happened with Tommy, also 25. 'The last two weeks have been very, very real' In the first few minutes of the video, Molly-Mae – who shares daughter Bambi, 19 months, with Tommy – began: 'I feel like a lot of you will have clicked onto this video because you want me to sit down and talk about everything that's gone on in the past couple of weeks. 'That was never something that was going to happen and it's not something I ever plan on doing, or talking about. 'The last two weeks have been very, very real. It's real life, it's something we've been going through as privately as we can but obviously not privately whatsoever because I haven't really been able to get away from it the last couple weeks.' 'The last thing I want to do' Molly-Mae then added that the 'last thing' she wanted to do was to talk any more about the split. She explained: 'The last thing I want to do is come on here and fuel that more and just talk about it really. It's not my coping mechanism. 'My coping mechanism is talking to the people I love, who are so close to me and have been so incredible through this time. Then coming on here and pushing forward. 'I don't really ever plan on talking about the last couple of weeks, it's not something I feel comfortable with. Continuing, Molly-Mae clarified that the situation was 'real life' and that she would also not be speaking about what had happened 'out of respect to Tommy'. She added: 'It's not drama, it's not tea... it's very sad and very deep and it just doesn't feel right to come on here and talk about it.' 'Also out of respect to Tommy as well because it's just not nice. Everything over the past couple of weeks... it's been a lot... it's really got a bit carried away with itself. 'The last thing I want to do is fuel that fire anymore or stir the pot when it doesn't need to be stirred.' 'She can definitely sense that there are changes' In a further clip, Molly-Mae spoke briefly about the impact the split had had on daughter Bambi, revealing that the toddler was extra clingy at the moment. She explained: 'I can’t go to the toilet or leave the room or do anything without her crying her eyes out which is not really ideal. 'I think she is having a little bit of attachment issues at the minute. 'She can definitely sense that there are changes and things are strange at the minute. 'I can really feel that she can sense that, which is very interesting considering she’s just a baby – she’s not even two yet.'

'Never in a million years did I think I'd ever have to write this,' she explained. 'After five years of being together I never imagined our story would end, especially not this way.' Molly-Mae added: 'I will forever be grateful for the most important thing to me now and always, my beautiful daughter. Without us there would be no her, she will always be my priority. 'I want to thank you all for the love you have shown us over the last five years.' She later came back to Instagram, with a grid post thanking her followers for being 'the best online friends I could’ve ever wished for'.",

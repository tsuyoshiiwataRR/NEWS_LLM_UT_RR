    "text": "Carrier Infinity hybrid heating system nightmare: advice, please! Rhonda Hurwitz last year I moved into a house 18 months ago, and the Carrier Infinity hybrid heating system -- gas furnace and heat pump -- has been a constant problem since we moved in.\nIntermittently, the system turns off and shows FAULT CODE 178 - indoor communication error - and we have had no luck diagnosing it. I can restart the system manually whenever this code occurs, to get the heat going again, but this used to occur every month or so, but now it happens several times a week, in the middle of a New England winter. This is still a big issue, especially if I want to travel.\nThe furnace and the heat pump were manufactured approx 12 years ago, and calls to Carrier to troubleshoot the problem have not been productive. They tell me to contact the original installer, who has been unfortunately unresponsive. As a result, I found a local HVAC company, and they have been to my house many times.\nOn the local HVAC company's recommendation, last week we changed all of the wires from the INFINITY thermostat to the indoor control board and from the zone board to the outdoor unit with a special improved type of wire. (Installed twisted shielded wire in place of the solid conductor thermostat wire that it was installed with). Carrier recommends twisted shielded wire be used for communicating systems. We did this last week at a cost of $1500, but unfortunately this did NOT resolve the issue -- the same error we have been getting all along occurred the next day!\nPlease offer any advice if you have had similar experience troubleshooting this system/error code. Or, do we just scrap the system instead of throwing good money after bad and buy a new system?",

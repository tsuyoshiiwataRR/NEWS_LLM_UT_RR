    "text": "Product : Apex Legends\nPlatform : Xbox Series S\nPlease specify your platform model. Microsoft Xbox Series S\nWhat is your gamertag/PSN ID/EA Account name? pilot.anna.1901\nPlease provide your squad mates' gamertag/PSN ID/EA Account name if possible.\nAre you using any software with an overlay? No\nWhich Legend were you playing (if applicable)? Wattson\nWhich Legends were your squad mates using (if applicable)?\nWhere did the issue occur? In a match\nWhich part of the map or menu were you in? If you don't remember the exact name, please describe the area or what you were trying to do in the menu. Every part of every map.\nWhat were you doing when the issue occurred? E.g. respawning a squad mate at a beacon, using an ability, a squad mate left the game. Playing\nDid your squad mates also experience the issue? Yes\nHow many matches had you played in a row before the issue occurred? Every time I play Wattson\nWhen did this happen? (dd.mm.yy hh:mm) 22.08.24\nHow often does the bug occur? Every time (100%)\nHow severe is your issue? Major impacts to gameplay\nWhat happens when the bug occurs? On control and team deathmatch when I play Wattson I cannot regenerate life at all. There are no syringes either so I have the same life until I die and respawn on these game modes. This happens on not just one account or console.\nWhat should be happening instead? I should be regenerating life like everyone else.\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? Play Wattson on Control and Team Deathmatch and take any damage.\nâ€Œ",

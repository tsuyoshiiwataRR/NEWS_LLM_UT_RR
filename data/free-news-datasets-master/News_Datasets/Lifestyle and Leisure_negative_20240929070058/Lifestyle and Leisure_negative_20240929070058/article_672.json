    "text": "Urban Chislic , Sioux Falls’ only eatery to exclusively serve chislic, a South Dakota staple, as its main course, is closing its doors Friday. The owners announced the closure Tuesday on their Facebook page . Located at 431 W. 85th St. near the South Minnesota Avenue Walmart, the eatery opened in August 2018, offering traditional fried mutton chislic to chislic burgers, nachos, salads and even a dessert option featuring bacon bit chislic sundaes. More: A history chislic and why it's South Dakota's unofficial dish Co-owners Erik Christensen and Hong Phrommany said closing after the past six years of serving a modern twist on a South Dakota classic, \"unfortunately, had to be done.” “It's been a gradual process as far as sales go, but it's slowly gone down, and it's gotten to the point where it just not sustainable,” Christensen said. “Instead of spinning our wheels and beating our head against the wall, trying to bring people in, it's probably time to, you know, all good things have to come to an end.” Phrommany, who is also the founder of Icon Lounge and Events and was the general manager at Bracco World Cafe before it closed in 2017, said another factor could be location, given when the restaurant first opened in 2018, it was still a new development inside a strip center. More: Urban Chislic is now open. Check out the South Dakota-inspired menu Both agree though the concept of “urban” chislic may have detoured some who cherish the traditional style they remember. “It's different,” Phrommany admitted. “It's not the chislic that your grandfather made for you on the farm.” For Christensen, he wanted to “revolutionize” the way chislic is prepared by incorporating less garlic salt and more variety of rubs and sauces, a concept he said that people either “loved or hated.” The last few days, Phrommany said, have been emotional for everyone. “The staff was crying because our customers were giving them hugs,” Phrommany said. Phrommany said he has been making calls to other restaurants in the area to help displaced employees. Staff were informed of the closure on Tuesday, the same day as the public. Christensen said this decision was not made in haste. He and Phrommany, who both grew up in Sioux Falls and have known each other as friends since childhood, had been pondering it for a while but wanted to see how the summer went. The closure marks the end of a notable chapter that began as a catering business for five years before opening a physical location. The restaurant also had its fair share of time in the spotlight, with a visit first in June 2020 from Guy Fieri of Food Network’s “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.” Urban Chislic was one of six locations Fieri tried out during the show’s first visit to South Dakota .

As for what’s to become of the space that many frequented for a bite and drink to watch the big game, both say they have a few interested parties despite their remaining four-year lease. “Most likely it's going to be a national or regional chain that goes in there,” Phrommany said. “It's not a brand new concept that Sioux Falls has never seen before. They just want more locations.” As for the people behind the idea of Urban Chislic, both Christensen and Phrommany have other endeavors they will pursue. Christensen has his main businesses as the owner of Trademark Homes, a custom home-building company in Sioux Falls, along with an additional land development company. “Hong was the go-to as far as running the restaurant,” Christensen said. “I would be on the outside doing some big picture stuff, but he was the main grind, every day, in and out there in the morning, there at night.” As for Phrommany, he said he will be taking a step back from the restaurant industry for a bit and will continue to focus on other ownerships and investments he has, along with his most recent focus the last few years, biohacking. “I'm researching different types of foods and products that I want to resell,” Phrommany said. “Like, maybe, even a high-end grocery mini-mart…like Pomegranate Market but smaller scale. And, you know, plant-based stuff, organic vegetables and fruit, grass-fed beef.” But, he said, he will eventually circle back around to food and beverage, his passion since he was 19 years old. “I would just say thank you to all our loyal customers,” Christensen said. “We had a following of some people who were absolutely diehards and loved to go there, we saw them every week. And we can't appreciate those guys enough.”",

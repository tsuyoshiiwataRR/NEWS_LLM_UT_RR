    "text": "The Governor of Quintana Roo, Mara Lezama, announced signing of an agreement with the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association (FCCA) to establish a Cruise Tourism Development Fund. The new fund will be financed through a $5 fee charged to each cruise passenger visiting the ports of Cozumel and Mahahual. The revenue generated from this tax will be dedicated to improving tourism infrastructure, strengthening natural disaster prevention measures, and enhancing security at these popular destinations. The fund will come into effect in the first half of 2025 and will be overseen by a Technical Committee, which will ensure resources are managed transparently and used effectively. During the signing ceremony, Governor Mara Lezama emphasized the importance of the agreement, highlighting the role of the Quintana Roo government as a strategic partner of the FCCA. The agreement underscores a shared commitment to fostering the growth of cruise tourism in the region and ensuring that the benefits extend to local communities, particularly those near Puerto Maya in Mahahual. The signing ceremony saw the participation of key figures, including Governor Mara Lezama and Tourism Secretary Bernardo Cueto, representing the Quintana Roo government. The FCCA was represented by CEO Michele Paige and President Adam Ceserano. Cozumel welcomed 4,089,054 cruise passengers in 2023. This number is expected to rise by an additional 400,000 visitors this year, further strengthening its status as one of the worldâ€™s most popular cruise destinations.",

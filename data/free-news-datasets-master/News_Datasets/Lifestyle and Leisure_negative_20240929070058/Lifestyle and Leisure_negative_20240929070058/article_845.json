    "text": "Had my first flight with Norse Atlantic this week, flying Gatwick to Barbados. I can't say that I was overly impressed with the experience. Though, I guess that's low-cost for you.\nOn the positive side, the flight was more or less on time and the aircraft was clean and comfortable with nothing obviously broken.\nHowever, I find it odd that they want you to pay to choose your seat even at the check-in counter where most other airlines offer free selection at check-in. And the lack of even free water on an eight hour flight doesn't strike me as a good idea.\nAs to their longer-term viability, while one flight isn't a trend, it's not a good sign that even as low as £200 one-way a flight to Barbados, in winter, was way less than half full. I really hope the people next to me at check-in were on the LAX flight because they paid £28 each to reserve seats and there were whole rows empty!\nAdding to questions about their long term prospects, they're chopping and changing their network, which suggests that they haven't found routes that work.\nSimple Flying article:\nOn the positive side, the flight was more or less on time and the aircraft was clean and comfortable with nothing obviously broken.\nHowever, I find it odd that they want you to pay to choose your seat even at the check-in counter where most other airlines offer free selection at check-in.

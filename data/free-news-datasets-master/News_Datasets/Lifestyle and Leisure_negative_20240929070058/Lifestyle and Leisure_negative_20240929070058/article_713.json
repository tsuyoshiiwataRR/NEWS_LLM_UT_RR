    "text": "[Paralympics 2024](/paralympics-2024) Paralympics 2024 Track-Cycling: Arshad Shaik finishes last in C2 3000m heats, exits Games Arshad, competing in his debut Paralympic event, finished his 3000m with a timing of 4:20.949s at the last spot in the final rankings. India's track cyclist Arshad Shaik was eliminated from the Paralympics 2024 men's C2 3000m event in the qualifying rounds, at the Velodrome in Paris, on Friday. Arshad, who tried his hand in many sports before taking to track cycling, made his Paralympic debut in Paris as the sole cyclist in his heat. He had a decent run, completing his 1000m in 1:27.200s, 2000m in 2:53.616s and finally finishing the race with a timing of 4:20.949s. The qualifying round is all about timings, with the top two place-holders getting a chance to compete in the gold medal race and the next two getting an opportunity to compete in the bronze medal race. Unfortunately for Arshad, his timing could only land him in the last spot, confirming his exit from the competition. France's Alexander Leaute broke the world record in the C2 category by clocking a timing of 3:24.298s and topped the qualifying round. He will race against Belgium's Ewoud Vromant for the gold medal. Great Britain's Matthew Robertson (3:28.373s) and Japan's Shota Kawamoto (3:29.875s) will battle for the bronze medal. India's other para-cyclist Jyothi Gaderiya also got eliminated on Thursday in the women's C1-3 3000m qualifying round. Both track cyclists still have one more event to go, with Jyothi set to compete in the women's C1-3 500m time trial and Arshad will feature in the C1-3 1000m time trial event, scheduled to take place on August 31.",

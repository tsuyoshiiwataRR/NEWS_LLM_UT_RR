    "text": "Even though this price increase won’t take effect until next week, users have decided to cut their losses and switch to Xbox , since, after the announcement, the available stock of the PS5 sold out quickly before the new price was applied.\nXbox Series X sales soar in Japan Automaton has contacted one of Japan’s largest retailers, who claims that sales have skyrocketed Xbox Series X sales placing itself in the Top 8 of sales, when until now it had not dropped below the Top 100. Due to the increase in sales of Xbox Series X, it has run out of stock.\nThe motivation for many Japanese users to buy the PS5 is due to the upcoming launch of Monster Hunter Wilds a highly anticipated title in the country that will finally not be exclusive to PS5 as initially reported, as it will also be available for PC and Xbox.\nMicrosoft has been working hard to make a name for itself in Japan for itself, and in recent years, with the launch of the Xbox Series S and Series X, it has succeeded. Thanks to Sony , it seems to have become the best option in the Japanese market.\nIt’s now a matter of time to see if Xbox Series X sales continue to increase or if, on the contrary, this is a one-off movement due to the price increase of the PS5 and the lack of stock due to the launch of Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom’s latest title expected for early 2025.\nIt will affect PS5 Pro sales The PS5 price increase in Japan comes at a bad time for the company, as, according to the latest news, the intergenerational renewal, the PS5 Pro will be presented at the PlayStation Showcase which is celebrated at the beginning of September, specifically on the 9th.\nIf the 90 euro increase seemed excessive to users in Japan, the outlook for the PS5 Pro is very bleak, as it will be more expensive, justified by the improvements it will offer.\nThis console will represent a significant change in terms of performance compared to the original console released in 2020. In addition, it will include twice as much storage space. So many improvements will be reflected in the price, a price that, according to various sources, could rise to 700 euros in exchange, becoming Sony’s most expensive PlayStation.\nOnce it hits the market, we’ll know if users consider it worth paying more to enjoy a higher resolution or if, on the contrary, the features offered by current hardware are more than enough.",

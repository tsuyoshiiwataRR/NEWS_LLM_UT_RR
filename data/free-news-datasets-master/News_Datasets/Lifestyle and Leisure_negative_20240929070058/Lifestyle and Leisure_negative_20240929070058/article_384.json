    "text": "Losses can weigh heavily on a fighter’s psyche, and\nIsrael Adesanya, the former middleweight champion, is a prime example of this. Adesanya, the man who once seemed invincible, suddenly finds himself on a losing streak. After two tough defeats, his coach, Eugene Bareman, recently spilled the beans on Izzy’s mental state.\nBareman decided to shed some light on the situation, appearing on a podcast with a name that is actually very memorable called “Who The Fook Is That Guy.” According to the coach, Adesanya’s loss to Dricus Du Plessis was easier to swallow than his defeat by\nSean Strickland.\n“He’s handling it well and you’re right, I love the way he loses. I actually prefer the way he loses than the way he wins…The Strickland loss, he will never get over. He just fought badly and just it was unexplainable…it’s not measurable like what caused it. You just go down a rabbit hole of a million things,” said Bareman.\nThe coach praised Du Plessis, calling his defense underrated. Adesanya was caught off guard and found himself tapping out to the submission. Bareman blamed fatigue for Izzy’s loss. But the Strickland loss? That’s the one that keeps Adesanya up at night, tossing and turning.\nBareman’s words paint a picture of a fighter grappling not just with opponents but with his own legacy. Israel Adesanya, once the undisputed middleweight king, now finds himself in unfamiliar territory, losing\nthree of his last four fights.\nCoach Eugene Bareman Reveals Israel Adesanya’s Comeback Date\nIsrael Adesanya has had a rough time lately. But his coach, Eugene Bareman, recently dropped some exciting news for fans. His recent loss to Du Plessis marked his second defeat in a row, and fans wondered\nwhether he would return to action soon.\nClick on ‘Follow Us’ and get notified of the most viral MMA stories via Google!\nFollow Us\nCoach Bareman dropped a bombshell in a recent interview. He hinted that Adesanya might return to the octagon before the year’s out. This might be a bit soon, but Adesanya is adamant about ending the year strong.\n“I would say that Izzy will fight again this year as well. It could be all on again, this year, it just doesn’t stop,” said Bareman via Combat TV.\nOf course, nothing’s set in stone yet. The\nUFC’s schedule is tight, and finding gaps that can adjust a fighter of Israel Adesnaya’s caliber is low. But the UFC usually makes its own way when there’s a potential pay-per-view draw.\nAlso Read:\nIsrael Adesanya Reacts As Alex Pereira Suspected Him Of Having Injury While Fighting Dricus Du Plessis At UFC 305 – “It’s Weird How This Guy Knows Me”",

    "text": "I am convinced that the next The Golden Bachelor lead should not be anything like the season 1 lead, Gerry Turner because he showed a lot of red flags. Speaking as an avid The Golden Bachelor fan, I am an expert about everything that went on during the scene as well as all the off-camera drama. I think that 72-year-old retired restauranteur Gerry presented himself well on the show, but his true colors came out after, which marred the show's credibility and reputation. Gerry had a choice between 22 single senior ladies , and he ended up choosing financier Theresa Nist . The pair got married in early January 2024, only to announce their divorce a few months later in April 2024. Myself and many other The Golden Bachelor fans had high hopes for the success of Gerry and Theresa's relationship only to be let down after investing so much emotion into the season and their union. I believe that their divorce crushed the franchise and fans' desire to continue watching the show in future seasons â€” which is why the next The Golden Bachelor lead needs to be nothing like Gerry. [Related ](/best-reality-tv-shows-right-now/) [ 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now ](/best-reality-tv-shows-right-now/) Reality TV is more popular than ever. With so many to choose from, here are some of the best reality TV shows to stream or watch right now. Gerry Turner's Shady Past & Bad Qualities Were Overlooked He Presented Well On The Golden Bachelor After The Golden Bachelor season 1 ended, issues in Gerry's past surfaced. Gerry claimed not to have dated since his wife of 43 years, Toni Turner, passed away in 2017. But that proved to be untrue, as an ex-girlfriend came forward and divulged about their relationship. She said Gerry was controlling and allegedly behaved rudely towards her. I know that new impression of Gerry soured my opinion and the opinion of fans. Moreover, Gerry seemed to be putting on an act for the camera, which did make him very likable, but it wasn't authentic. Given the hasty nature of his split from Theresa, I feel that Gerry was not ready for marriage and the compromise that comes with it. Gerry came off as empathetic and genuine on The Golden Bachelor, but that seemed to be a facade, given the fallout from the show. I think Gerry was on the show for fame, as evidenced by his new repertoire of celebrity friends and event attendance. The Next The Golden Bachelor Should Not Be Like Gerry They Need To Be Very Different The next The Golden Bachelor lead should not have any skeletons in their closet that could ruin their authenticity on the show. Furthermore, the future lead should be someone ready for a relationship and someone who is transparent about their dating life, background, and dealbreakers. Gerry and Theresa broke up over not wanting to move to be with each other, so I'm positive the next lead needs to be prepared to change their lives for the person they choose and not present the red flags that Gerry did post-season. Has Casting Begun For The Golden Bachelor Season 2? There Is A Casting Announcement The Golden Bachelorette season 1 is slated to premiere this Fall, and it is highly anticipated. Joan Vassos from Gerry's The Golden Bachelor season is the new lead. But looking ahead to The Golden Bachelor season 2, the lead will either be someone from Joan's season, or a new person completely. Bachelornation.com has open casting calls for both Bachelor spinoff shows. Either direction the casting takes, I'm certain the franchise needs to ensure that the new figurehead is likable and that they will stay likable, unlike Gerry. The Golden Bachelor season 1 is available to stream on Hulu.

    "text": "TV & Movies Yellowstone Season 6 rumors confirm our worst fears about Season 5 Part 2 Jakob Barnes ❘ Published: 2024-08-30T14:13:47 Paramount So, after all that fuss about the main show ending, the latest speculation is that Yellowstone Season 6 might actually happen. Good news, right? Well, not quite.\nYellowstone Season 5 Part 2 finally begins in November. Unfortunately, it’ll go ahead without Kevin Costner, who left the show after his well-publicized feud with Taylor Sheridan .\nWith this in mind, fans have been mentally preparing for the fall of the Dutton family empire for a while. But now, there’s a chance Yellowstone Season 6 will actually happen, with Kelly O’Reilly and Cole Hauser being eyed to star.\nArticle continues after ad This doesn’t just potentially spoil the big ending we’ve been gearing up for by all but confirming Beth and Rip will make it out of Season 5 alive; it uncovers a far more worrying issue at the heart of the production.\nDoes Taylor Sheridan actually have a plan? We’re a couple of months away from the return of one of the biggest TV shows in the US. We don’t know what will happen in the next batch of Yellowstone episodes . But Taylor Sheridan and Paramount certainly should.\nArticle continues after ad Article continues after ad Paramount So why are we only now discovering that there’s a chance for Yellowstone Season 6? To me, this screams, ‘we don’t know how to finish this thing.’ At the very least, it suggests the conclusive finale we expect will be left open-ended.\nIf you’d told me a year ago that Yellowstone would go on forever, I’d have been delighted. But now, I’m worried Sheridan is simply letting his worst tendencies take over – he weaves brilliant stories and creates compelling characters, but he sure knows how to lose control of his plot threads along the way.\nRelated: Yellowstone star promises “best series finale in history” for Season 5 ending Article continues after ad Don’t push your luck, cowboy As soon as they knew Costner was out, Sheridan and Paramount should have sat down and thrashed out a definitive journey for the final episodes that would end Yellowstone in style.\nTo go ahead without Costner for Season 5 Part 2 was always a risk, but it can work. Taking John Dutton out of the picture will leave a huge hole in the show, but it’ll also make for some fascinating developments in the Dutton ranks.\nArticle continues after ad Article continues after ad Paramount The shadow of John Dutton could and should hang over these next episodes, bringing tension and twists before the show gets a perfect send-off. Dragging Yellowstone out any longer only multiplies the risk of ruining its legacy entirely.\nThere are enough spinoffs in the works already, anyway. Yellowstone fans will remain well fed with the likes of The Madison and 6666 . We don’t need to be forced to consume the reheated leftovers Sheridan found at the back of the refrigerator. I mean, look, I’ll still eat it up, but second helpings aren’t always a good idea.\nArticle continues after ad Why not let Beth and Rip ride off into the sunset? Let John Dutton rest in peace. Let the Yellowstone ranch operate out of sight. Move on, Taylor, and remain the cowboy king that you are.\nkeep reading TV & Movies Yellowstone fans are fearing for one character’s life ahead of Season 5 Part 2 Jessica Cullen TV & Movies Kevin Costner shuts down Yellowstone feud question in awkward interview Jasmine Valentine TV & Movies Kevin Costner confirms he won’t return to Yellowstone — but there’s still good news Jasmine Valentine TV & Movies Yellowstone Season 5 Part 2: Release date, first trailer & Kevin Costner exit explained Jakob Barnes TV & Movies Yellowstone Season 6: Everything we know Sam Comrie TV & Movies Yellowstone 2024’s shock rumor proves the show isn’t dead yet Jessica Cullen TV & Movies Yellowstone set photo just put the biggest concern about the show to rest Jessica Cullen TV & Movies Yellowstone fans are fed up after worrying Season 5 update Jessica Cullen Related Topics Taylor Sheridan Yellowstone About The Author Jakob Barnes Jakob is the TV and Movies Evergreen Specialist at Dexerto.

    "text": "Sign In The Boston Red Sox closed out their four-game series with a 2-0 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays at Fenway Park on Thursday night.\nWith the loss, the Red Sox fell to 69-65 on the season, while the Blue Jays improved to 66-70.\nCheck out the full box score here.\nONE BIG TAKEAWAY\nThe Red Sox could not figure out Blue Jays starting pitcher Bowden Francis, getting just one hit in 22 at-bats through seven innings against the right-hander. Francis threw 72.8% of his pitches for strikes (51-of-70 pitches), striking out five batters without allowing a walk.\nNick Sogard, recalled before the game after the Red Sox placed David Hamilton on the 10-day injured list, was the lone Boston hitter to knock a single to left field in the bottom of the sixth inning.\nAcross the diamond, Kutter Crawford allowed two runs on six hits while striking out three and walking two Toronto batters in his 7th start for the Red Sox this season.\nDanny Jansen collected the Red Sox's second hit of the game in the bottom of the eighth inning off Blue Jays reliever Genesis Cabrera.\nSTARS OF THE GAME\n-- Francis earned his eighth win of the season for Toronto, pitching seven shutout innings.\n-- Rich Hill made his season debut, pitching 1 1/3 hitless innings, striking out two of the four Blue Jays batters he faced.\nRich Hill is the only player to appear in at least 1 MLB game in each of the last 20 seasons (2005-24).\nPunches out his 1st batter of 2024. pic.twitter.com/aXvvPObBoH\n— Red Sox (@RedSox) August 30, 2024 -- Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit his 38th double of the season, knocking in Brian Serven for Toronto's first run of the game.\nON DECK ON NESN\nThe Red Sox will begin a three-game set with the Tigers in Detroit on Friday. The first pitch from Comerica Park is scheduled for 6:40 p.m. ET. You can watch the game on NESN following 90 minutes of pregame coverage.\nMore Red Sox: Why This Red Sox Prospect Needs To Be 2025 Opening Day Second Baseman",

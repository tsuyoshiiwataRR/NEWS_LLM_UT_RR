According to multiple reports, the incident happened at around 4 a.m. on Wednesday (August 28) near the Schuylkill River, off Kelly Drive.\nRELATED: Oop! Bobbi Althoff Claps Back Amid Critiques About Her Social & Intimate Life Post-Divorce Intimate Session Leads To 911 Call For Philadelphia Couple The identity of the couple, a man and woman, remains unclear, per CBS News . Apparently, the pair was in the backseat steaming up the windows when the woman’s foot disengaged the gear. In response, the 2020 Range Rover rolled into the river with the couple inside.\nAs a Philly PD spokesperson put it, the man and woman were “enjoying each other’s company” before the real splash!\nDespite their lil’ surprise dive, the man and woman reportedly escaped the SUV without suffering any injuries. By 9 a.m., the Philadelphia Fire Department had fished their vehicle out of the river!\nAnother Car Recently Ended Up In Schuylkill River Note that it’s unclear if the Philadelphia couple will face any charges for public indecency, indecent exposure, or lewd or disorderly conduct charges, given that the couple was getting it on in a public area.\nHowever, to be clear, there’s no specific federal law banning sexual activity inside of a car in the U.S. The risk is getting it on in a public place, in the view of people.\nFox 29 reports that this is the second car to end up inside the Schuylkill River in the last few weeks. Police are still investigating the case of a 4-door sedan recovered from the river on August 16.\nAn eyewitness said he saw the car stop suddenly and then reverse into the river. He called 911, but responding authorities did not find anyone inside the locked car. However, a window of the car was open, and the back glass was reportedly shattered.\nUPDATE: vehicle recovered but NO BODY inside… pic.twitter.com/dQR3rh9bon\n— Marcus Espinoza (@MarcusFOX29) August 16, 2024\nRELATED: Megan Thee Stallion Sparks Dating Rumors After “Couple’s Edition” Video With THIS NBA Player (WATCH)\nWhat Do You Think Roomies? +1 0 +1 0 +1 0 +1 0 +1 1 +1 0 +1 0",

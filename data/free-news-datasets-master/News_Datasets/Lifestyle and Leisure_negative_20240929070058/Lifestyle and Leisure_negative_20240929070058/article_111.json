    "text": "A Singapore Airlines Airbus A380-800 bound for Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) was forced to return to Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport (SYD) shortly after takeoff due to a technical issue.\nFlight SQ 232 took off from SYD at 11:04 local time on April 7, 2024, but stopped its climb shortly after departure.\nThe 13-year old A380 (registered 9V-SKM), entered a hold at 10,000 feet to lose fuel weight before landing safely back at SYD.\nThe aircraft touched down at SYD airport at approximately 12:42 local time.\nAn airline representative told Channel News Asia that the technical issue was related to the aircraft’s flaps.\nAirplane flaps are used to generate more lift at slower airspeed, which enables the aircraft to fly at a greatly reduced speed with a lower risk of stalling. The flaps are most useful during takeoff and landing.\nThe technical issue was resolved on the ground at Sydney Airport and the flight was able to depart once more for Singapore at 16:19 local time. The flight arrived at SIN airport at 22:24 local time, almost five hours delayed from its original ETA.\nIn its statement to Channel News Asia, Singapore Airlines said it apologized to all affected customers for any inconvenience caused, adding that the safety of its customers and crew is its “top priority.”",

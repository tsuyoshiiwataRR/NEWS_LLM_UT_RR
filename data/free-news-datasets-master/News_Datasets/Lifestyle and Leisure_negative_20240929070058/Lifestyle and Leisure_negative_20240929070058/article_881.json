    "text": "Frage\nAntwort\nLösung\n30.08.2024 16:53 - bearbeitet 30.08.2024 16:54\nHi experts,\nI will be moving from Mannheim to Biblis in 3 months (just received my confirmation from landlord regarding my cancellation).\nI have a Cable gigazuhause 100GB contract with Vodafone that runs till May 2025.\nHowever, when I checked the availability of cable internet at my new address, it's confirmed to be unavailable (only DSL).\nI don't want DSL connection though because it's slower for higher price usually. And also my friend who I move in with is already having an existing internet in the apartment.\nI can share further details when it's required.\nIn this case can I cancel prematurely the contract without further payment under Sonderkündigungsrecht?\nI tried to request cancellation of my contract through formular, but not sure if I'm eligible, and if I should upload any further documents (there is no attachment function there) - like my new rental contract at new apartment, my cancellation confirmation of current apartment, ...\nIf possible, could you help me process this request?\nThank you.\nBR\nDo Le\nam 30.08.2024 17:22\nUse the relocation service\nMit Vodafone umziehen | Hilfe und Anleitung\nIf additional information is required you will be informed.\nThere is no support in the forums.\nIf you need assistance in english you have to use",

    "text": "Apparently Steven admitted Sabrina ‘wasn’t his type’ moments after Love Is Blind UK reveal\nAccording to a cast member he deliberately hid his true feelings from the producers\nLove Is Blind UK cast member Shirley Bekker has absolutely dragged Steven in a TikTok video, and accused him of not only recently using Hinge but also saying that Sabrina wasn’t his “type” moments after their initial reveal.\nShirley made the video to address an interview that Steven was part of where he called her “the one that’s active on TikTok all the time and never got any airtime.”\nShirley addressed the fact that she didn’t get airtime because she didn’t make any connections in the pods and didn’t want to lie about her feelings just to get screentime, but claimed that’s exactly what Steven did on Love Is Blind UK. She also made some accusations against Steven in regards to his true feelings on the show, claiming he said he wasn’t even attracted to Sabrina in the first place.\nShe explained: “In reality this is a show about one, getting engaged, and two, potentially getting married. If you do not get engaged or married and therefore cannot potentially get married, there is no relevant screentime to award you as a character, as is in my case.\n“Whereas in your case Steven, you got engaged to a very interesting woman. And after your Oscar performance at the reveal you turned around to your friends, unbeknownst to the producers, and said ‘not my type but I’ll go through with it.'”\nShe continues: “You falsified your feelings, you got engaged to someone and therefore were in a position to even receive this airtime in this first place… Apart from the fact you faked your life, your feelings, and your attraction to the person who you eventually proposed to, there’s nothing particularly interesting that qualifies you for this airtime.”\nShe also claimed that Steven has “recently been on Hinge.” As Shirley provided no evidence or screenshots for this accusation being true it is purely speculative. It’s all kicking off!\nSteven exclusively told The Tab: “I’ve only met Shirley in passing, spoke to her for all of five seconds at a screening. So as you can probably figure out it’s not the truth. She’s one of Sabrina’s mates and has been click-baiting off the back of the show. I wish her TikTok career the best of luck.”\nThe first season of Love Is Blind UK is available on Netflix now – For all the latest Netflix news, drops, quizzes and memes about Stephen\nlike The Holy Church of Netflix on Facebook.\nRelated stories recommended by this writer:\n•\nIt lasted 86 days: A full timeline of Sabrina and Steven’s failed Love Is Blind UK marriage\n•\nUm, Sabrina reveals Steven had his ex girlfriend come to their Love Is Blind UK wedding?!\n•\nSteven finally speaks out about Sabrina split and says Love Is Blind marriage is being annulled\nFeatured image via Netflix.",

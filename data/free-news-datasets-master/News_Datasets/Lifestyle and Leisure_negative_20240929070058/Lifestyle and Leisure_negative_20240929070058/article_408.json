    "text": "Getty\nWide receiver Brandon Aiyuk of the San Francisco 49ers.\nThe Cleveland Browns were willing to break the bank to add Brandon Aiyuk to the fold, but the money wasn’t enough to get the star wide receiver on board with a trade.\nAiyuk inked a four-year extension worth $120 million with the San Francisco 49ers on Thursday, August 29, which officially closed the book on any deal that could have made him a Brown. However, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported earlier in the day — before the news of the contract broke — that a trade to Cleveland had long been a non-starter for Aiyuk.\n“The hold up with Cleveland all along has been Brandon Aiyuk’s willingness to accept a trade to the Browns..\nThe contract would’ve been done there if he wanted to go..\nThe compensation would’ve been done there if he wanted to go” ~ @AdamSchefter #PMSLive\n“The holdup with Cleveland all along hasn’t been whether or not the Browns have cap space. The holdup there has been Brandon Aiyuk’s willingness to accept a trade to Cleveland,” Schefter told The Pat McAfee Show . “The contract would have been done there if he wanted to go.”\nSchefter added that the Browns were willing to pay Aiyuk more than any of his other top suitors, including the 49ers who ended up agreeing to pay the wideout $30 million annually starting in 2025 and running through 2028. However, Cleveland’s money wasn’t enough to move Aiyuk off of his position.\n“[The Browns] already were offering more money than Pittsburgh, more money than San Francisco,” Schefter added . “That wasn’t the issue. The issue simply was that he preferred to go elsewhere.”\nAiyuk finished last season with 75 receptions for a career high 1,342 receiving yards and 7 TDs.",

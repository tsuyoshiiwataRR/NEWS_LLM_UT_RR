    "text": "Trending: Nvidia Staff Works In A 'Pressure Cooker' Environment; Does A Hefty Paycheck Makes It Worth It? Nvidia staff works for long working hours and endure 'pressure cooker' environment for a hefty pay package. Would you trade places with one of Nvidia's staffers to upgrade your lifestyle? Does a hefty paycheck makes it easier for a professional to work in a stressful work environment? (Picture Credit: Canva) If you were asked to work for long working hours for a hefty pay package in return, would you take up the offer? Chances are those who prioritise mental well-being over anything else would decline it, but those who are big on monetary compensation would gladly accept it. Well, it seems Nvidia employees happen to fall in the latter category. As per a report, employees working at the AI chip making company are working for 7 days a week till 2 am. Rolling your eyes already? Ten people who spoke to Bloomberg mentioned that the staff at Nvidia works in a \"pressure cooker\" environment. Despite the non-conducive environment, many of you will be surprised to know that the company has the lowest attrition rate worldwide. In fact, after the company’s market capitalisation exceeded $1 trillion, the attrition rate fell further to just 2.7 per cent. This rate of employee turnover is in sharp contrast with that of the industry which stands at 17.7 per cent. This clearly means that monetary compensation is a great incentive for professionals and the latter may feel willing to go the extra mile just to reap in the rewards. As per the report, a former staffer at the organisation even mentioned that it is the “golden handcuffs” that serves as the major reason behind many professionals staying put in the company despite the hardships and unhealthy work-life balance. If you follow share market news, then chances are you would already know that Nvidia’s stocks have surged massively in the past few years. The company gives its employees stock grants that typically vest over a four-year period. This implies that a person who has been with the company for the past 5 years must have earned in millions by now. The compensation earned through the shares is also a good enough reason why professionals are enduring the unfavourable working conditions and are willing to endure more to earn more. If given a chance would you want to trade places with Nvidia professionals who have swanky cars and homes worth millions of dollars? Chances are some of you would say that you will endure the hardship for a few years, save enough money and then happily retire. However, come to think of it, there are many Nvidia professionals who have enough money to retire and yet they continue to work in stressful working conditions. Why do you think they do that? Well, if one were to tap into human psychology, then one may conclude that a human mind always vies for more even when their initials goals and aspirations are met. More money and more luxuries in life never hurt anyone, in fact, perhaps they serve as a bait to professionals to endure more. Thanks to the hustle culture and with most of us driven by the need to upgrade our lifestyles, we often end up sacrificing the quality of our lives. We fail to take a pause and reflect over our lives. When was the last time when you enjoyed a quiet me-time and reflected over what truly makes you happy? Did you ever question yourself if you enjoy doing what you do? In the race to climb the corporate ladder, most of us fail to identify when to stop enduring and start living.

    "text": "Molly-Mae Hague has shared a sad update about daughter Bambi, following the shock news of her split from fiancé Tommy Fury. Earlier this month, [Molly-Mae](https://www.tyla.com/molly-mae-hague), 25, confirmed that [things had ‘come to an end’](https://www.tyla.com/entertainment/celebrity/molly-mae-tommy-fury-broken-up-896355-20240814), saying she felt 'extremely upset'. \"After five years of being together I never imagined our story would end, especially not this way,” she told fans. Advert Since then, she’s remained fairly quiet on her platforms, apart from a [brief message on Instagram](https://www.tyla.com/entertainment/celebrity/molly-mae-breaks-social-media-silence-statement-463591-20240827) to thank followers for their support. Molly-Mae’s now shared a vlog to her YouTube channel to go into more detail about how she’s been, although [she warned that she wouldn’t be speaking about the breakup](https://www.tyla.com/entertainment/celebrity/molly-mae-tommy-fury-split-first-video-061373-20240829) specifically. She said: \"That was never something that was going to happen and it's not something I ever plan on doing, or talking about. Advert \"The last two weeks have been very, very real. It's real life, it's something we've been going through as privately as we can but obviously not privately whatsoever because I haven't really been able to get away from it the last couple weeks. \"The last thing I want to do is come on here and fuel that more and just talk about it really. It's not my coping mechanism. \"My coping mechanism is talking to the people I love, who are so close to me and have been so incredible through this time.\" While Molly-Mae did not wish to ‘stir the pot’ by discussing the past couple of weeks, she did allude to aspects of the breakup - including its impact on [Bambi](https://www.tyla.com/celebrity/meaning-behind-molly-mae-baby-girl-name-bambi-714659-20230201). Advert “Me and that [baby](https://www.tyla.com/parenting) have literally been joint at the hip,” she said. “We actually had a really nice couple of weeks together. I feel so, incredibly close to her at the minute, and she’s - quite frankly - obsessed with me! It’s scary. I literally can’t go to the toilet or leave the room or do anything without her crying her eyes out, which is not really ideal.\" Molly-Mae continued: “I think she is actually having a little bit of attachment issues at the minute. I think she can definitely sense that obviously there’s changes, and things are strange at the minute. I can really feel that she can sense that, which is very interesting considering she’s just a baby - to me, she’s just a baby; she’s not even two yet. Advert “And I feel like they’re just not stupid, they can really pick up on things.” Showing a suspiciously wet patch on the sofa to the camera, she added: “I also think that she has weed on the sofa this morning! “Just when I started filming this morning, I looked down and there’s a big wet patch in front of me, literally where she was sitting. She was wearing a nappy, so I’m not quite sure how that’s happened.” It seems the mum life never stops, even when you’ve got to share one of your career’s most highly anticipated vlogs...

    "text": "We are stopping in Santorini for 3 nights before we head to Athens as the last stop on our vacation. We will be flying into Athens, then taking a direct flight to Paros, then ferry to Antiparos for 4 nights. Ferry to Naxos for 5 nights, then ferry to Santorini for 3 nights and Athens for the last 2 night before flying back to Canada.\nThe crowds and cruise ships passenger overload has got me wondering if we should skip Santorini all together? We are staying at the Sunset Hotel which came highly recommended by this group with a beautiful view. But..if we have to fight crowds when we step out of our hotel to walk around the town I would not be enjoying this. Would someone recommend either staying away from the city centre instead, or skipping Santorini all together? IF so, where to stay for 3 nights instead?\nThanks for all of your help in my travel planning\nSantorini crowds too much and not worth it?\nWe are stopping in Santorini for 3 nights before we head to Athens as the last stop on our vacation.

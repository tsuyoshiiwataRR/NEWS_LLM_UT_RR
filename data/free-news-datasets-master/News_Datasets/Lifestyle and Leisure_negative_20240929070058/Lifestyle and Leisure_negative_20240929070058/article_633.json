    "text": "Watch: Shreyas Iyer falls prey to bouncer again, short-ball nightmare haunts him in Buchi Babu tournament\nPublished - 30 Aug 2024, 04:36 PM | Updated - 30 Aug 2024, 04:37 PM\nTable of Contents\nIndia National Cricket Team batter Shreyas Iyer came under the scanner for his poor batting in the ongoing game against Tamil Nadu Cricket Association XI in the Buchi Babu tournament. The match between the two teams is being played at the Sri Ramakrishna College Cricket Ground.\nShreyas Iyer, who is representing Mumbai in the Buchi Babu tournament, didn't have a great outing in the game against Tamil Nadu. The middle-order batter struggled to get going in the first innings and then came under scanner for his dismissal in the second innings.\nIyer got out to short-ball yet again as his woes continued. The batter perished to a bouncer in the second innings as the bowler used his weakness against him. He attempted to play the pull shot but was caught inside the circle. Iyer managed just 22 runs as Mumbai came under pressure.\nShreyas Iyer perishes to short-ball against Tamil Nadu Cricket Association XI in the Buchi Babu tournament\nHere's the video:\nShreyas Iyer once again fall into trap of shot ball and it wasn't even a pacy delivery.â€” Raazi (@Crick_logist)\nAnd people want him as first retention for KKR.\nLol\n[pic.twitter.com/p6Ji6m4J0j] [August 30, 2024]\nIyer has failed to get going against the short ball irrespective of the format. The right-hander often has got out similarly. He has also been criticized a lot for not tackling the short ball well and it was one of the main reasons behind his downfall in the Indian National Cricket Team.\nThe ongoing Buchi Babu tournament will be extremely important for Shreyas Iyer as he eyes a comeback in the Indian Test team. Iyer was one of the backbones for the side in the longest format of the game as he replaced Ajinkya Rahane in the team and set the stage on fire.\nShreyas Iyer made an immediate impact in\nTest cricket as he slammed a century on debut. However, after that, he played quite a few impactful innings for the team and bailed them out of trouble. He couldn't maintain the consistency and was dropped from the team.\nIyer dropped from the team after the two Tests against England, having bagged a series of low scores in the last few games and his poor record in overseas games. He got dropped after returning with scores of 35, 13, 27, and 29 in the first two Tests against England National Cricket Team.\nOverall, Iyer has slammed 811 runs in 14 Tests at an average of 38.86, including one century and five 50s. The poor outing in the game against the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association XI wouldn't have done any good to him as he has been fighting back for the Test spot.\nIyer would be keen to make a huge impact in the Duleep Trophy 2024 now. He has been named in the Team D squad and will also be captaining the team in the tournament. Iyer would want to set the stage on fire take his team to the win and stage a comeback in the Test team.\nTagged:\nShreyas IyerBuchi Babu Tournament",

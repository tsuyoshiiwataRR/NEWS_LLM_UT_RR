    "text": "The ending of Game of Thrones Season 8 will always remain in our memories as one of the most disappointing conclusions in the history of television. For eight years, fans have been rooting for the most deserving character to lead Westeros, only for someone like Bran Stark to end up becoming the ruler.\nCredits: Isaac Hempstead-Wright in Game of Thrones / HBO In fact, even the actor himself didn‚Äôt believe the showrunners would do such a thing for a project they have dedicated almost a decade of their lives. He knew the audience would get dismayed ‚Äì even mad ‚Äì but he still believes it to be a fitting end.\nEven Isaac Hempstead-Wright Couldn‚Äôt Believe Bran Stark Would Be King Perhaps the final season of HBO‚Äôs Game of Thrones was the most criticized of all the installments as not only the ending was anticlimactic, but it also had several production slip-ups that were beyond excuse. Apart from the fact that Emilia Clarke ‚Äôs Daenerys Targaryen would die in the hands of Kit Harington ‚Äôs Jon Snow, the next infuriating event would be the election of Isaac Hempstead-Wright ‚Äôs Bran Stark as king of Westeros.\nRELATED ‚ÄúWe can get 7 more shows but we can‚Äôt redo season 8‚Äù: George R.R. Martin Makes a Game of Thrones Announcement That Will Piss Off Any Fan This surprised the viewers in a not-so-good way because Bran doesn‚Äôt seem like the type of character who would lead a kingdom or rule his people. He was incapacitated after falling off a tower, and spent most of his life stuck in a wheelchair.\nCredits: Isaac Hempstead-Wright in Game of Thrones / HBO After learning that his character would eventually become the fateful king, Hempstead-Wright believed it was a jest from the showrunners. He told Entertainment Weekly how he thought ‚Äú it was a joke script and that [showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss] sent to everyone a script with their own character ends up on the Iron Throne .‚Äù\nWell, this sounds like a good prank, though, and when you think about it, it‚Äôs a good way to protect the show from spoilers and online leaks as they will have different endings.\nRELATED ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not following my template‚Äù: George R.R. Martin‚Äôs Worst Fears About Game of Thrones Series Came True After He Predicted a Major Flaw in the Approach The decision to elect Bran as King of Westeros made a lot of fans unhappy and the 25-year-old actor is very much aware of this. A fan remarked on this about the British star and Bran‚Äôs journey in the show:\nhe understood bran spent most of his storyline in a cave. he was a cave dweller. should‚Äôve been the master of whispers in all honesty, he‚Äôd have ALL the tea‚Ä¶\n‚Äî finnüêÆüáµüá∏ (@olrazzdazz_) August 29, 2024 It‚Äôs safe to say that fans thought he would have a more significant role in the final season as a warg and a greenseer, but it was clear that the showrunners had a different plan.\nGeorge R.R. Martin Wanted Bran Stark To Win The Game Of Thrones Credits: George R.R. Martin via CBS News Hempstead-Wright revealed that author George R.R. Martin intended Bran Stark to become king. Since the shocking news about his character, the actor didn‚Äôt believe the showrunners until he was told it was Martin‚Äôs vision all along.\nIn HBO‚Äôs Making Game of Thrones , the actor shared that ‚Äú there were two things [author] George R.R. Martin had planned for Bran, and that was the Hodor revelation, and that he would be king .‚Äù He was still happy to play the part despite the initial skepticism.\nGame of Thrones is currently streaming on HBO.",

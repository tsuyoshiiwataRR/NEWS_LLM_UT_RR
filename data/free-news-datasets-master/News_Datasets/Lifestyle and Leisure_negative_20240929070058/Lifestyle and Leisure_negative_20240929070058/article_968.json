How to spot impaired drivers Greg Giesen Delaware News Journal Show Caption\nHide Caption\nThis Labor Day could be the busiest ever for the TSA The TSA is anticipating an 8.5% jump in passenger volumes this weekend compared to the previous year. Labor Day weekend is one for relaxation. It's the final party weekend of the summer.\nHowever, like many holiday weekends, people may be out partying and then driving.\nIn Delaware, that tends to lead to fatal crashes.\nAccording to the injury law firm Bader Scott, who analyzed statistics from the National Highway Safety Administration, Delaware has the fifth highest rate of deadly DUI crashes in the country.\nIn the First State, 19.3% of fatal crashes involved an impaired driver. The national average is 11.8%.\nMontana led the nation with 32.48% of fatal crashes involving a drunk driver. Vermont (26.47%), Idaho (23.77%), Colorado (21.48%) and Delaware round out the top 5.\nNew Jersey was 43rd with 7.01% of fatal crashes involving an impaired driver. Pennsylvania was 30th with 8.73%.\nThe weekend at the Delaware beaches: Have you completed our summer bucket list?\nHow to spot a drunk driver Here are 15 ways to spot a drunk driver on the road, according to Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ):\nQuick acceleration or deceleration Tailgating Weaving or zig-zagging across the road Driving anywhere other than on a road designated for vehicles Almost striking an object, curb, or vehicle Stopping without cause or erratic braking Drifting in and out of traffic lanes Signaling that is inconsistent with driving actions Slow response to traffic signals (e.g. sudden stop or delayed start) Straddling the center lane marker Driving with headlights off at night Swerving Driving slower than 10 mph below the speed limit Turning abruptly or illegally Driving into opposing traffic on the wrong side of the road If you spot a driver you suspect is impaired, MADD suggests:\nStay as far away from the other vehicle as possible. Get a look at the license plate and the details of the vehicle. Call 911 to report the driver.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

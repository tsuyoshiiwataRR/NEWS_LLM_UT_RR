    "text": "Capri Sun lovers across the globe are taking to their keyboards in a frenzy after reports emerged the company is allegedly making a big change to its beloved juices. On the days you were lucky enough to get [a packed lunch](https://www.unilad.com/community/man-wife-packed-lunchbox-energy-drink-dangerous-766865-20240828), there was nothing better than popping open your little cube of brightly colored plastic to find a squishy Capri Sun inside. Not only did the pouch offer a delicious few slurps of syrupy, fruity goodness, but the funnest part was trying to stab the plastic straw in the little printed circle towards the top without missing and it slipping off completely, or ending up with a spurt of [juice](https://www.unilad.com/food-and-drink) hitting you right in your face instead. Alas, these sorts of childhood memories may soon be a thing of the past. Advert Instagram snack, food, candy and fast food review account known as Snack-o-lator took to its page yesterday (August 29) to reveal an alleged announcement from Capri Sun. The post reads: \"Capri Sun is coming for the adults with new bottles that will be arriving in stores soon! \"These were announced for the upcoming National Association of Convenience Stores trade show (NACS) show [set to be held in October] and will be in three flavors (at least) to start: Fruit Punch, Strawberry Kiwi, and Pacific Cooler. Advert \"Each bottle is 12oz and won't need you to have to find the spot to poke the straw in and hope that it doesn't come shooting back at you!\" Now, whether this means the bottles will actually replace the pouches altogether who knows - UNILAD has contacted Capri Sun for comment - but Pop Crave [reports](https://x.com/PopCrave/status/1829300816081232236): \"Capri Sun will reduce the number of pouches and transition more to bottles starting in 2025.\" And it's not taken long for fans of the beverages to flock to [social media](https://www.unilad.com/social-media) to weigh in. One Advert A \"There was a line. The line has been crossed. What happens next will be on capri sun’s conscience,\" another added. A third commented: \"Something in my brain has convinced me the taste of Capri Sun has to do with the pouch and straw. This can not be allowed.\" \"The straw poking was 99.8 percent of the fun………\" a fourth added. Advert And a final lamented: \"This was our childhood.\" Topics: [Food and Drink](/food-and-drink), [Social Media](/social-media),",

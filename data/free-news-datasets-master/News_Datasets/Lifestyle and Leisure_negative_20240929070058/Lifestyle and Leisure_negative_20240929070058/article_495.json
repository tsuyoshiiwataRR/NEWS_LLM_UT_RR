    "text": "As you may know, the hero shooter Concord, developed by Firewalk Studios and officially launched on August 23, was not received very well by gamers, with launch numbers that were dramatically low (we are talking about less than 700 concurrent players at peak). Unfortunately, the situation has not improved over the days and the number of players on the servers has decreased even more. For example, at the time of writing this news there are 71 concurrent players on Steam, with the peak of the last 24 hours being 178. Considering that only six days have passed since the launch and that we are talking about an online game, a big problem is therefore being created for the few remaining: they cannot find games to play, with waiting times between one and the other that are getting longer and longer. Biblical waiting times Some have reported waiting times of up to 8 minutes to play, sometimes with sudden disconnections mid-game. The situation on PlayStation 5 is not good either. According to the True Trophies website, the game only reached 147th place in its ranking, which measures the popularity of games on the PlayStation Network (calculated on more than 3 million active accounts). In short, at the moment the situation is really tragic for Concord that will hardly be able to recover from these conditions. Probably in the medium term Firewalk and Sony will try the solution adopted by Square Enix with Foamstars, that is the transition to the free-to-play model, in the hope of increasing the number of players.",

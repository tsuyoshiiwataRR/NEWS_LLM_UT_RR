    "text": "Hit the road, Jax! Brittany Cartwright has finally had enough of her estranged husband Jax Taylor . After separating in February, the two have gone back and forth on social media for everyone to see.\nWhile it always appeared to me that Brittany was done done, it seemed less so that Jax got the memo. But now there is no denying where Brittany’s head is at since she officially filed for divorce this week.\nFresh out of rehab for mental health struggles, Jax was spotted moving out of the home The Valley stars bought in 2019.\nMoving day for Jax Taylor\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Jax (@mrjaxtaylor)\nThe father and bar owner was spotted by Daily Mail loading clothes, boxes, and other miscellaneous items into his black pickup truck. He was not wearing his wedding ring.\nIf it’s one thing that these two have down, it’s timing. Plenty of fans thought that their split announcement was PR for their new show, as it coincided with the show’s premiere. But as the months went on, it was obvious that Brittany meant business.\nShe spoke out on numerous occasions about their breakup and expressed a bleak outlook on getting back together. Jax on the other hand, played dirty games on social media about what Brittany was doing while being seen with a new lady friend.\nAt the end of July, it seemed to be too much for Jax, whose rep confirmed he voluntarily checked into rehab for his mental health. The former stars of Vanderpump Rules were already slated to start filming the second season of The Valley. It wasn’t known if Jax would be back in time when the cameras picked up.\nHe did make it back in time and Brittany made the most of it. Word immediately came that Jax was served his divorce papers on camera .\nAccording to a source, “There’s a lot that has transpired over the past few months that she could not look past. This decision wasn’t made lightly but she feels adamant that it was the right one.”\nIn the filing, Brittany cited irreconcilable differences and requested primary legal and physical custody of their young son Cruz.\nTELL US – WHERE DO YOU THINK JAX IS GOING TO STAY? WILL YOU BE WATCHING SEASON 2 OF THE VALLEY?",

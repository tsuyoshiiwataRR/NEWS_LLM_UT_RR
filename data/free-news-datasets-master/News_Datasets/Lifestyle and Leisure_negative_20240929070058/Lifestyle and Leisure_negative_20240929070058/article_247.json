    "text": "Announcement posted by\n[Invigorate PR](/newsroom/invigorate-pr/)\n30 Aug 2024\nColour has a powerful role in many aspects of our lives, including interactions, psychology, marketing and art.\nAccording to Kellie Richardson, colour can impact our feelings, mood and behaviour more than we realise.\nKellie Richardson is a highly respected interior designer and founder of Melbourne-based home design company Kurved by Design. Richardson emphasises that according to the principles of good design and the ancient art of Feng Shui, there are simple things you can do to lift your d√©cor at home to improve your mood.\nFeng Shui is the ancient Chinese art of geomancy and it uses energy flow to harmonise and balance peace and prosperity in the home.\n\"As an interior designer, I am drawn to Feng Shui because integrating these elements into a home and your life creates a space that is not only harmonious but also extremely positive and aesthetic,\" she said.\nTrusted by clients and respected by those in the industry, Richardson is particularly well known for incorporating elements and principles of Feng Shui into her design concepts and she shares some of her tips on how to help households create a positive and uplifting environment at home.\nIn 2020, Richardson won the global CEO Excellence award in 2020 for 'Best Property Styling and Interior Design Business'. She is regularly asked to comment on all matters relating to Feng Shui and the home.\n\"The choice of colours in your home can significantly impact the atmosphere, mood and overall energy of the space. While personal preferences play a big role, certain colours can have negative psychological effects or clash with the intended ambiance,\" Richardson said.\nRichardson outlines which colours are generally advised against in home decor, along with the reasons why.\nDark or harsh black\n\"While black is currently a popular choice for many people, it can make a space feel small, oppressive and overwhelming if used excessively, particularly in large areas. It tends to absorb light, creating a gloomy atmosphere, which can negatively affect mood and energy levels,\" Richardson said.\n\"Use black as an accent colour rather than a dominant one, pairing it with lighter tones to balance the space.\"\nIntense red\n\"While red is a popular colour, especially for sports cars, when used in a home, it can be energetic and stimulating and too much of it can create feelings of anxiety, aggression or restlessness. In bedrooms, for instance, red can make it difficult to relax or sleep,\" Richardson said.\n\"Consider using red in moderation, such as in accents or smaller rooms where its vibrancy can be contained, like a dining room to stimulate appetite.\"\nOverly bright yellow\n\"Although yellow is often associated with happiness and energy, too much bright yellow can be overwhelming and even cause eye strain. It may also lead to feelings of frustration and irritability, particularly in spaces meant for relaxation, like bedrooms or living rooms,\" Richardson said.\n\"Opt for softer shades of yellow or use it as an accent rather than a primary colour.\"\nNeon or fluorescent colours\n\"Neon colours are extremely bold and can create a sense of visual chaos. They can be overstimulating and uncomfortable to live with on a day-to-day basis. These colours may also quickly go out of style, making your decor feel dated,\" Richardson said.\n\"If you love bold colours, use them sparingly in accessories or accent pieces rather than on walls or large furniture.\"\nCold gray\n\"While gray has been a popular neutral colour, certain cold or overly sterile shades can create a dull, lifeless and even depressing atmosphere. If not balanced with warmer tones, gray can make a space feel uninviting and bleak,\" Richardson said.\n\"Choose warmer grays with undertones of beige or blue, or mix in warmer textures and materials to avoid a cold feeling.\"\nDeep or muddy brown\n\"While earthy tones can be grounding, deep or muddy browns can make a space feel heavy, dull and uninspired, particularly in smaller rooms. Brown can also lack the brightness and vibrancy needed to energise a space,\" Richardson said.\n\"If you like brown, consider using lighter or warmer shades, such as taupe or tan and complement them with brighter accents.\"\nExcessive white\n\"While white is often seen as clean and crisp, too much white can feel stark, clinical and cold. An all-white space may lack character and warmth, making it feel unwelcoming and uncomfortable,\" Richardson said.\n\"Mix white with soft pastels or warmer neutrals to create a more inviting space and add textures to enhance depth and interest.\"\nOverly saturated or dark purple\n\"Dark purple can feel overly dramatic, moody or even depressing if used in large quantities. It may be too intense for spaces meant for relaxation or social interaction,\" Richardson said.\n\"Opt for lighter shades like lavender or soft plum for a more soothing and elegant effect.\"\nOverly bright orange\n\"Like red, bright orange can be overly stimulating and lead to feelings of anxiety or discomfort if used excessively. It can also clash with other colours and make a space feel chaotic,\" Richardson said.\n\"People with photosensitive epilepsy are known to have seizures triggered by bold and contrasting visual patterns. Research has also found that people with ADHD are often more attracted to, and stimulated by, intense visual stimuli such as bright colours.\n\"Use muted or burnt orange tones in moderation, particularly in spaces where you want to encourage creativity and warmth, such as a study or kitchen.\"\nOverpowering green\n\"While green is associated with nature and calmness, overly bright or intense green can feel jarring and out of place, particularly in spaces meant for relaxation,\" Richardson said.\n\"Choose softer, muted greens like sage or olive for a more tranquil and balanced feel.\"\nRichardson emphasised that in Feng Shui, colour choices should also align with the energy flow and purpose of each room. Colours that create imbalance or block positive energy should be avoided, such as overly dark or overly bright tones in spaces where calm and harmony are desired.\n\"Choosing colours for your home should be a balance of personal preference and the psychological or energetic impact those colours may have. It's often helpful to test colours in small amounts before committing to larger areas,\" Richardson said.\nAbout Kurved by Design\nSince 2016, Kurved by Design, founded by Kellie Richardson, has provided Melbourne with a range of home design services.

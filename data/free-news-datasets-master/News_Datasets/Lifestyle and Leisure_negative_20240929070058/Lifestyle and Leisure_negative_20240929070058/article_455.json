    "text": "As the summer holidays draw to an end, it's almost time to hit the shops for school uniforms and packed lunches. While it’s important to ensure your child’s lunchbox is filled with nutritious options, it’s equally crucial to consider the impact of certain foods on their teeth, experts say.\nIt can be hard to distinguish what is healthy for your child's packed lunch. With certain packaging misleading, some seemingly harmless snacks can be harmful to your child's teeth in the long run.\nDr Smita Mehra, BDS MFGDPRCS, Principal Dentist at\nThe Neem Tree Dental Practice, has compiled a list of 10 foods to avoid putting in your kids' packed lunch.\nSweetened Granola Bars\nOften, when we see granola bars on supermarket shelves, we associate them with healthy eating. But some of your favourite snack bars can contain a lot more sugar than you may think. The sticky nature of many sweetened granola bars means they can easily stick to the crevices of your teeth, making it difficult for saliva to wash away the sugar and particles.\nThe prolonged exposure of your teeth to sugars increases the risk of decay, especially in hard-to-reach areas like between teeth or in grooves.\nRaisins\nSimilarly to some granola bars, they are high in sugar and can easily stick to your child's teeth and in between grooves. Because raisins stick to teeth, they can stick to different parts of the mouth for the rest of the school day. If this happens regularly, your child may develop cavities since the sugar remains in contact with the teeth for an extended period.\nAlternatively, offer fresh fruit, which tends to be less sticky and contains more water to help dilute sugars.\nOranges\nWhile oranges are nutritious and packed with vitamin C, similarly to other fruits like lemons and grapefruit, they can be a bad choice for your teeth when consumed frequently or in large quantities due to their high acidity.\nIf your child consumes oranges regularly in their packed lunch or sips on orange juice throughout the day, their teeth will be exposed to acid more frequently. This consistent acidity can wear down the enamel, which is the protective outer layer of your teeth.\nPretzels\nPretzels are high in refined starches. When chewed, they break down into sugars and contribute to oral bacteria. As most pretzels are typically salty, they can dry out your mouth and absorb moisture. A dry mouth means less saliva, which is essential for neutralising acids and washing away food particles that may contribute to cavities.\nCereal\nAlthough some cereals can typically be branded as healthy, they contain hidden sugars under names like sucrose, fructose, or corn syrup, which still contribute to tooth decay.\nSome cereals can be packed dry for your child to snack on during the day, but for those that may attend a breakfast club, when eaten with milk, cereals can become a sugary, sticky mixture that clings to teeth. While milk is not harmful to your child's teeth, it can mix with the sugars and starches, making your mouth more acidic.\nFruit winders\nFruit winders are often made with concentrated fruit juices or added sugars, which can be bad for your child's teeth if exposed to them throughout the school day. Not only are they full of sugar, but the texture of fruit roll-ups is often sticky.\nThis stickiness allows the sugars to remain in contact with your teeth for a longer period, meaning the oral bacteria have more time to produce acids that damage enamel.\nWhite-breaded sandwiches\nWhite bread is made from refined flour, which is high in simple carbohydrates. The carbs turn to sugar quickly in the mouth, feeding bacteria that cause tooth decay. In addition to this, when white bread is chewed, it often becomes soft and sticky, forming a paste-like consistency.\nWhen your child is eating a sandwich with white bread, it can stick to the roof of their mouth or in between their teeth, which can be bad for their teeth if not washed down with water.\nInstead, you can opt for whole-grain bread instead of white bread. Whole grains contain more fibre, which is less likely to stick to teeth and provides additional nutrients that can protect teeth.\nLollipops\nLollipops are made up of mostly sugar, and unlike other sweets, they are often licked or sucked and take a longer time to consume. Because they take much longer to eat the sugar is in contact with your teeth for a longer time, increasing the risk of decay.\nAs some lollipops can be hard to chew, if your child bites down on them, it can risk damaging or breaking teeth.\nCrisps\nCrisps can be greasy and can leave a residue that sticks to the surface of your teeth, which can be difficult to remove and can contribute to plaque buildup.\nSome crisps can have sharp edges that may scratch or irritate your gums and the inside of your mouth. While this might not directly harm your teeth, it can lead to gum problems and increase the risk of infection.\nThey lack nutrients that can help protect your teeth, such as calcium or fibre, which can help you maintain strong teeth and promote overall oral health.\nCaramel popcorn\nThe caramel that layers the popcorn can easily stick to your child's teeth and gums, and the sugar within the caramel feeds bacteria in your mouth, leading to acid production that erodes tooth enamel and causes cavities.\nIf you do choose to pack caramel popcorn, your child must rinse their mouth with water to help wash away some of the sticky residue and sugar.",

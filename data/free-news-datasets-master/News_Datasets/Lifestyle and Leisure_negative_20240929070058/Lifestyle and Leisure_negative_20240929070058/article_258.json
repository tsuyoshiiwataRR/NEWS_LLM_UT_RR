    "text": "In a candid photo posted to Instagram, Tommy Fury shared a life update following his shock split from social media sweetheart Molly-Mae Hague. Earlier this month Hague announced the beloved couple’s split after five years, igniting intense internet rumours claiming Fury had cheated — though the pair have not revealed the real reason. Just days ago, the woman accused of kissing Fury during his European holiday confirmed the [controversial pash](https://www.perthnow.com.au/entertainment/tv/love-island-uk-danish-woman-tommy-fury-accused-of-cheating-on-molly-mae-with-confirms-kiss-c-15831145). Now, Fury has opened up to his 5.4 million Instagram followers, addressing the “horrendous” allegations. He is pictured wearing a crisp white t-shirt, gym shorts and Asics trainers as he sits in a gym on the end of a treadmill tying his shoe with a dejected facial expression. “These last few weeks have been heartbreaking,” he wrote. “The false allegations about me have been horrendous, thank you to everybody who has stood by me through this.” The 25-year-old left the comments section open and was mercilessly grilled by thousands of social media users with some comments receiving as many as 17,000 likes. “Then tell us what ya did bruh,” one person wrote “’Here mate take a picture of me looking sad and tying my shoes,” a second mocked. “Keeping the comments on for this post is ballsy,” a third user remarked. On Thursday, Molly-Mae made a similar post thanking fans for “being the best online friends” amid the social media frenzy.",

    "text": "In the early hours of Sunday, filmmaker Swapna Waghmare Joshi’s family woke up to a shocking incident as a burglar broke into their home around 3 am. Reportedly, the burglar scaled a drainage pipe, reached the sixth floor of the building and entered her apartment in Andheri, Mumbai, through a sliding window. As per reports, `6000 was stolen before a pet cat alerted the family of the intruder’s presence. Swapna’s home has CCTV cameras installed, footage of which has been helpful. Cops at the Amboli police station have gone through the footage to identify the thief. Speaking to us, Swapna shared that the entire family is still coping with the incident. “We have CCTV cameras installed in most of the rooms, which proved to be incredibly helpful. We also had a meeting with the housing society members and are enhancing security measures in the area,” she said, adding, “Our pet cat was quick to alert us of the burglar’s presence.” A family member tried to catch hold of the burglar but he escaped from the window. 112916154Sharing the CCTV video on social media, filmmaker Ashoke Pandit wrote, “This video is for all of us, especially senior citizens who live alone. You will be shocked to see how a thief climbs the 6th floor of the residence of noted filmmaker (Swapna Waghmare Joshi) with the help of the pipes and jumps out the same way when he is noticed by the member of the house (sic).”What happenedThe burglar first attempted to break into the room where Swapna’s mother and her caretaker were sleeping. However, he entered another bedroom, and stole `6,000 from her daughter’s purse. After being alerted of the thief’s presence, Swapna’s son-in-law, Devan, tried to catch the burglar, but the burglar escaped. Swapna soon lodged a complaint with the police.",

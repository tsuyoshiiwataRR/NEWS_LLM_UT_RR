    "text": "With its December 6 release date on the horizon, Marvel Rivals has already gotten fans excited. The 5v5 team-based shooter from NetEase Games has brought a fresh take on the hero shooter genre. If you were hoping to pick it up on your Nintendo Switch though, you’ll be disappointed.\nThe developers have made it clear that, as of now, there are no discussions about bringing the game to the popular handheld console. This news is not entirely unexpected given the technical demands of the game. The Switch is also notoriously underpowered so it makes sense.\nMarvel Rivals Looks Promising But Switch Users Won’t Get To Play It ⛶ ⛶ ⛶ ⛶ ⛶ × Marvel Rivals , developed by NetEase Games, is set to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. This choice of platforms is tied to the game’s use of Unreal Engine 5, which powers its impressive visuals and intense, chaotic battles.\nI’m sure we can talk about a Switch 2 port in a year or so, but yeah, I don’t see Marvel Rivals running adequately on the current Switch.\n— Lethal Cadence (@LethalCadence) August 28, 2024 Expand Tweet During an interview with Pocket Tactics at Gamescom, game director Thaddeus Sasser was candid about the possibility of a mobile or Switch version, stating flatly that “ there are no discussions ” regarding these platforms.\nThe lack of a Switch port is disappointing, but understandable to many, especially considering the game’s massive appeal. Despite this, the game has gotten a lot of praise before its release and fans are only excited to see more of it.\nRELATED Marvel Rivals’ Two Newest Characters are a Masterclass in Superhero Craft However, Sasser’s comments indicate that the game’s technical demands outweigh the benefits of a handheld version, at least for now. Maybe the successor to the Switch that may or may not be coming could be a better candidate in the future.\nThe Game Just Seems To Get Everything Right Marvel Rivals has the potential for greatness. | Image Credit: NetEase For now, those eager to dive into NetEase ‘s next game will need to do so on PC, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X|S. The game promises a rich roster of Marvel characters, from Captain America and Winter Soldier to Spider-Man and Hulk, all of whom will be available at launch without the need for microtransactions.\nThat’s disappointing for Switch fans, but fingers crossed they’ll consider it in the future! The Switch would be perfect for a game like #MarvelRivals .\n— Rajali (@b_rajaliyar) August 28, 2024 Expand Tweet This approach is a refreshing change in a genre often criticized for its monetization strategies. Marvel Rivals focuses on delivering an authentic Marvel experience, complete with team-up moves between characters that are flashy and powerful.\nRELATED NetEase Will Encounter the Same Issue Every Superhero Game Before It Has, Meaning We Won’t Be Getting At Least One Hero in Marvel Rivals Despite this, there is still hope for a future Marvel Rivals release on a handheld platform. Speculation is already mounting about the next-generation Nintendo console, often referred to as the “ Switch 2 .”\nWith more powerful hardware expected, a port might be possible once the new console is released.\nThis speculation, however, remains just that—speculation. As of now, there is no official word on whether NetEase Entertainment plans to revisit the idea of a Switch or mobile version once the new hardware becomes available.",

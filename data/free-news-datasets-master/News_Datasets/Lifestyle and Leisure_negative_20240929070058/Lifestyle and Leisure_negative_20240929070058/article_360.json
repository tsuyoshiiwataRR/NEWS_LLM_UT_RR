    "text": "Most Dangerous Cosmetic Surgeries: In the United States, most people go for cosmetic procedures – which have seen a rapid surge in the last few years. According to statistics from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, there is an increase of 5 per cent surgeries happening every year. Doctors say even though all surgeries carry risks, one has a sizeable 92 per cent likelihood of life-threatening complications. The eye colour change surgery - which includes colourful iris implants, laser pigment removal, and keratopigmentation, tops the list of the 10 most dangerous cosmetic surgeries in the US. How is eye colour changing surgery done? Keratopigmentation - also known as corneal tattooing or eye tattooing, is a surgical procedure that can change the colour of your eye by injecting pigment into the cornea. Apart from cosmetic, it is sometimes also done for therapeutic reasons like improving the appearance of eyes that have been damaged by disease, injury, or irregularities in the cornea's shape. Even though keratopigmentation has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, experts say youngsters are thronging clinics to get it done. With recovery times ranging from one to eight weeks and an average cost of $12,000, it is currently the most popular cosmetic surgery across the country. How is keratopigmentation done? According to experts, the procedure is done using a corneal refractive laser off-label and uses a mineral-based pigment that is inert when inserted into the translucent cornea using a cannula. New York Post reported that a French company that trains ophthalmologists to perform keratopigmentation had shared footage of a woman who changed her brown eyes to a stark, vibrant blue in a clip scoring nearly 30 million views on TikTok. However, experts are warning against this procedure, saying it can permanently change the cornea from clear to opaque. Some other complications include: Blindness Damage to the cornea can lead to cloudiness, warpage, fluid leakage, and vision loss Reaction to the dye It leads to inflammation, uveitis, or blood vessel growth into the cornea Infection The procedure also causes light sensitivity and bacterial or fungal infections that can spread all over, leading to pain, swelling, blurred vision, and even permanent loss of vision. Dr. Colin McCannel, a professor of clinical ophthalmology at the University of California, Los Angeles, told Healthline that it is a “bad idea” to pursue “any unnecessary eye surgery” due to the risk of complications. Which are other dangerous cosmetic procedures? Number two on the list of popular cosmetic surgeries is thigh lifts – with a nearly 80 per cent risk of complications like infection, blood clots, and even fatality. Also known as thighplasty, it helps improve the contours and tone of your thighs and works by removing excess fat and sagging skin. However, according to experts, it can lead to deep vein thrombosis and edema. Thereafter, comes the hugely popular Brazilian butt lift, in which a plastic surgeon removes fat deposits from other parts of your body and inserts them into areas around your butt. After your recovery, you will see the butt will be bigger, stick out more and have an even shape. However, it comes with an almost 40 per cent risk of injury, fat embolism, and even death.

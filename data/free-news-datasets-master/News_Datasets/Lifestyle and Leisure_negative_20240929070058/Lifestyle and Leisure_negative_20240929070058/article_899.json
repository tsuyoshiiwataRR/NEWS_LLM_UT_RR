    "text": "I have what I think might be an alarming and confusing message for you all. It is not fall yet.\nIt is not fall.\nSo just take your hand off the pumpkin spice latte and BACK AWAY.\nThat's right. Keep going. Back to your lemonade.\nHonestly. Why are we all such dingbats about this? We dream of summer, long for summer, write poems about summer but once it's here we wish it away. By August we're idiotically thinking think You Know What? I really like flannel. I want to put on my damn flannel. Why, WHY, WHY summer, are you holding my flannel hostage. Then around the middle of August people snap and start lighting apple pie candles and wrapping themselves in sheepskin rugs while wearing flip flips.\nIf you're still scratching mosquito bites it's too early to light a pumpkin spice candle.\nIt's going to come. Actual fall. On September 22nd in the Northern Hemisphere as a matter of fact. But that's just a date. Fall might come earlier or it might come later.\nI understand pumpkin themed retail displays have muddied the waters a bit and many of us have actually lost our natural, seasonal compass.\nSo in case you're a bit iffy on when it's actually fall here are some tips.\n10 No-Fail Signs It's Fall. Tik Tok is filled with shots of people pretending they're happily picking apples even though they just had a huge fight in the car on the way to the orchard and never even thought of picking apples before the invention of social media. Costco is sold out of all their Christmas wrapping paper. You drop kick the hanging baskets you stopped watering 2 months ago into the garbage. You dip into your pajama drawer for the warm ones and they have that drawer smell. You stop shaving above the knee. And below the knee. Bully through the week of itchiness then happily revel in skin that feels like a plushie for 6 months. You start to forget your neighbours' names again. You spend 4 nights in a row Pinning wintery craft things like whimsical cross stitch patterns you'll never actually do because - binge watching season. Your hair is staticky and you broke a nail making the bed. You realize yet again, you look dorky, not adorable in hats. Black nail polish. O.K. so now that you feel more comfortable in recognizing the season of fall on your own, you can enjoy this last long weekend of the summer.\nEnjoy it, do something summery, eat a hamburger, skateboard on a boardwalk, get sprayed by a skunk.\nJust back away from the pumpkin spiced latte.\nHave a good last long weekend of the summer.",

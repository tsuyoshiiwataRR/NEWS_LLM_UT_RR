As the source put it, “Because he is selfish and is not fully committed as a partner.”\n10 Leah Remini and Jennifer Lopez pose together on Instagram. leahremini/Instagram 10 Leah Remini and Jennifer Lopez on social media. leahremini/Instagram Meanwhile, a second source explained that Remini had wanted to reconnect with her former best friend for a while during their estrangement.\n“They were friends for years. She wants to reach out to her, but she can’t just call up and say, ‘I told you so,” the insider shared in May. “J.Lo was so mad, she cut off all ties.”\nNow, Remini and Lopez can lean on one another, as Remini announced that she and husband Angelo Pagán have split after 21 years of marriage .\n10 Leah Remini and Jennifer Lopez attend the “Second Act” World Premiere After Party at West Edge on December 12, 2018, in New York City.

After 28 years together and 21 years of marriage, we have decided to file for divorce. This decision came after a lot of thought and care, and as hard as divorce is, we are approaching this with a positive outlook because we know it’s what’s best for us. We are proud of how we have worked through this together,” the statement read.\n“Yes, we’re sad, and we’ve got some figuring out to do as we continue to move forward into our new normal — together still in many ways, and apart in some new ones. But here’s the thing: we’ve been best friends for so many years,” they continued. “We are still celebrating holidays together, watching our favorite tv shows together, and gathering as a family.”\n10 Leah Remini and Jennifer Lopez on “Watch What Happens Live.” NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images 10 Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez stop by Soho House in Los Angeles on May 19, 2024. Thecelebrityfinder/MEGA The pair also took a moment to explain the decision to separate.\n“So, the big question—why? To put it simply, we both changed, as people do, and we got used to playing roles that didn’t fit us anymore,” the statement said.\n“After a lot of effort and consideration, we’ve decided to take this step, which reflects who we are today. Our bond is still strong—it’s just evolved into something different. We think a marriage that lasted this long and created so many beautiful memories, especially raising our incredible daughter, is something to celebrate,” they concluded. “From our perspective, this marriage was a huge success. And now, we’re looking forward to creating even more cherished moments—just in a different way.”\nRemini and Pagán married in 2003 after meeting in 1996 at El Floridita, a Cuban club and restaurant in Los Angeles.\n10 Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez pose together on the red carpet.

Lopez and Affleck went on to have kids and marry Marc Anthony and Jennifer Garner, respectively, but ultimately rekindled their flame in 2021.\nAfter splitting the first time around, the Grammy winner admitted she felt like she “was going to die” and went into an 18-year “spiral.”\nBut this time around, Affleck’s proposal was completely different. The “Batman” actor engraved a special meaning into Lopez’s engagement ring , which is estimated to be worth “well over $5 million.”\n“This one he put ‘not.going.anywhere’ because that’s how he would sign his emails when we started talking again,” she explained to Apple Music One’s Zane Lowe in 2022 about her second engagement. “Like, ‘Don’t worry, I’m not going anywhere.’”",

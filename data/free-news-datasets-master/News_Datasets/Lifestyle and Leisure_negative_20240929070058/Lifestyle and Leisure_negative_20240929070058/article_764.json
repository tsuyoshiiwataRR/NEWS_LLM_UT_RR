If you changed your region or location, Netflix might switch to the language associated with your new location.\nProfile or username: Each Netflix profile has a specific language setting. If you have created a new profile or changed your username, it might have reset the language.\nDevice compatibility issues: Different devices, such as smart TVs or Blu-ray players, may have specific issues with language settings or configurations.

    "text": "I’m a few years into running a business I built from the ground up, but here’s the kicker—I hate it. When I started this journey, I was all in. I left a stable corporate job to pursue what I thought was my passion, poured everything I had into making this business successful, and for a while, it worked. I was proud of what I created, and it felt like I was doing something meaningful. But now, every day feels like a grind, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m trapped in a cage of my own making. It’s not just the long hours or the stress of running a business—though those are definitely part of it. It’s the fact that I’ve lost all connection to why I started this in the first place. The industry has changed, and so have I. The things that used to excite me now feel like chores, and the thought of continuing down this path for another year, let alone another decade, makes me want to scream. My family and friends see me as this successful entrepreneur, living the dream, and they don’t understand why I’m so unhappy. My employees rely on me, and I feel a huge sense of responsibility toward them. The business is profitable, and I’m making more money than I ever did in my old job, but what’s the point if I’m miserable every single day? I’ve thought about selling the business, but the idea of walking away feels like admitting defeat. What if I never find something I’m passionate about again? What if I regret giving up everything I’ve built? On the flip side, the thought of sticking it out and pretending to care for the sake of everyone else feels like I’m signing up for a slow death by boredom and burnout. So, what should I do? Should I sell the business, shut it down, or suck it up and keep going? Am I just going through a rough patch, or is it time to admit that I’ve fallen out of love with my own creation? —Shaun B. Let me start by saying this: You’re not alone. There’s a dirty little secret that successful entrepreneurs rarely admit out loud—it’s entirely possible to hate the business you built. You’ve likely heard that if you do what you love, you’ll never work a day in your life. But what happens when what you love becomes a golden cage, locking you in with your own success? I've been in your shoes. I built an agency from the ground up, and after several detours, I found myself running a business I no longer enjoyed. Like you said, it was successful—I was building for the market, solving a need, and getting rewarded for it. But solving for the market and what customers want isn’t always what you want. I spent years grinding it out, only to watch things worsen over time. If you keep trying to \"suck it up and push through,\" as you mentioned, you'll eventually run the business into the ground. Burnout will set in, and even the simplest tasks will start to feel like massive chores. You'll procrastinate and avoid doing what you know is essential to keep the business moving forward. And when that happens, decline is inevitable. A business is either growing or dying—there's no in-between. It might be a slow death, but it will happen if you keep pushing forward at this rate. That's exactly how I ran my business into the ground. I couldn't force myself to keep doing the work it required because, like you, the thought of continuing down that path for another year—let alone a decade—made me want to scream. The hard truth You owe nothing to the business you built. It doesn’t care about you; it’s an entity, a machine that runs on your time, energy, and passion. If that fuel is running low, it’s time to reassess. If a job were making you miserable, you'd quit, right? Yet, when it comes to our business, we trick ourselves into thinking we need to stay out of some misplaced sense of duty. But the reality is that staying in a business you hate is no different than staying in a toxic relationship. Sell it, hand it off, or burn it down Here’s the controversial part. It might be time to burn it all down. Sell the business, hand it off to someone who still has the passion, or even shut it down if that’s what it takes to reclaim your life. Or, pivot the business into something that excites you—something that energizes you and aligns with your values, contributing to a cause you find meaningful. That's exactly what I did. After sabotaging my own business and being stuck with the pieces, I decided to pivot. I began rebuilding slowly, offering different services and running things in a fun and exciting way again. The world won't end if you walk away. It might be the best decision you'll ever make. Imagine waking up tomorrow with a clean slate—a chance to start something new, something that excites you. That's not failure; that's evolution. Your business is supposed to serve your life, not the other way around. If it’s not serving you, it’s time to move on. You know how to build a successful business—you’ve proven it. Now, take those skills and start again. Create something new that excites you, something you’ll look forward to in the next chapter of your career. How to move forward Now, I’m not saying go full scorched earth without a plan. Get your finances in order, talk to a business broker, and if you have employees, give them a soft landing. But don’t let guilt or societal expectations trap you in a life you’ve outgrown. Once you have an exit strategy, focus on what you want to do next. Not sure where to start or what to do next? That's okay. Start by exploring and figuring out what really lights you up. Think about what you love spending time on in this new season of your life. Give yourself the space to dream a little. Ask yourself the big questions: What would your perfect workday look like now? What changes can you make to get closer to making that a reality? Which personal strengths would you like to use daily to run your business? Is there an intersection between what you love and what the world needs? If you were just given one million dollars to start your next business, what would that business be? What would your business offer to the world? What kind of people would your business serve? What kind of people would you hire? Start there and see where your answers lead. Moving forward is about reclaiming your passion and aligning your work with what truly matters to you. It’s not about having all the answers right away—it's about giving yourself permission to explore, dream, and redefine what success looks like for you. Start small, ask the big questions, and let those answers guide you toward your next chapter. Already have an account? [Sign in](/sign-in).",

BILL BULEY/Press Addy gives a kiss to Kristina Jensen at Companions Animal Center on Thursday. Bessie, with her ribs visible, looks around at Companions Animal Center on Thursday. [Previous](#slider) [Next](#slider) [BILL BULEY](/staff/bill-buley/) Staff Writer | August 30, 2024 1:09 AM A water leak is being credited with saving the lives of two dogs left in a garbage-filled Coeur d'Alene house. “Their only water source was a leaking toilet,” said Kristina Jensen, dog technician at Companions Animal Center. “That's probably why they’re still alive is because of that leaking toilet.” The dogs, a young Great Dane/boxer mix and a 10-year-old pit bull mix, are believed to have survived in the home for about a month before they were rescued. Jensen said the dogs were very thin and malnourished when they arrived at the shelter about 10 days ago. The larger one named Bessie weighed about 50 pounds, but for her size should have been around 80 pounds, Jensen said. The smaller one, Addy, weighed about 35 pounds and should have been about 50. Jensen said the dogs endured difficult conditions, as temperatures were in the 90s on several days they were trapped in the filthy home. Their only food was leftovers and trash scattered throughout the home. The home was also filled with animal waste, creating a strong stench, and the dogs were caked in mud and waste. “It was amazing how bad it was,\" said Vicky Nelson, CAC development director. “I mean, we’ve seen awful.” It's believed the dogs were left alone for more than a month because of a date found on a delivered package outside the home. “It’s amazing they survived,” Nelson said Thursday. The dogs are improving. Addy remains skittish but is starting to open up more, Jensen said. Ironically, Addy was adopted at the shelter about 10 years ago. Bessie was lethargic when she arrived but has regained some strength, though her ribs are still visible. Her teeth are those of a much older dog, and her ears were brown instead of pink, Jensen said. Both dogs were wary Thursday but tails occasionally wagged as they stood in a fenced outside area of CAC. “That's the kicker of it all. They’re so sweet and they still have so much trust for us even after all they went through,” Jensen said. “I wouldn’t trust anybody who let me sit there in a house and starve for a month.” Tales of abandoned dogs nationwide are not rare. A headline from a recent story read: “Abandoned dog found tied to bench with ‘Heartbreaking' note.\" Two from earlier this year read: “Abandoned dog patiently waits on porch for owners who moved away,” while another was “Abandoned dog learns to trust again after making a special friend.” According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, of about 6.3 million companion animals who enter shelters nationwide every year, about 3.1 million are dogs and 3.2 million are cats. Nelson previously told The Press that reasons given by people wishing to surrender a pet generally are connected to money and moving. With the rising cost of housing, many are forced to give up their pets. \"It's not supposed to be that way,\" Jensen said. CAC continues to operate at capacity, with nearly 50 dogs there Thursday, and it continues to have a waiting list for people wishing to surrender pets. Jensen said the shelter’s veterinarians developed a treatment plan for Bessie and Addy and they may be available for adoption in about a month when they have regained their health. “It depends on how they’re doing,” she said. Coeur d'Alene animal control contacted the dogs' owner, who could face animal cruelty charges, Jensen said. The name of the dogs’ owner was not released.",

    "text": "Grizzlies Allow One Hit, But Lose at Lake Erie\nAugust 29, 2024 -\nFrontier League (FL) Gateway Grizzlies News Release\nAvon, Ohio - The Gateway Grizzlies did not allow the Lake Erie Crushers a single hit until there were two outs in the bottom of the eighth inning on Thursday night, but the one hit they did allow was a go-ahead, two-run triple by Vincent Byrd, Jr. in a 4-2 loss at Crushers Stadium.\nIt was a combined effort by the Grizzlies' staff, as Deylen Miley struck out four in his three innings pitched to end 2024 with 161 on the year, the second-most in a single season by an individual pitcher in Frontier League history. Kaleb Hill would toss the next three innings, and Justin Goossen-Brown retired the side in the seventh.\nThe game itself was back-and-forth again, as Lake Erie took a 1-0 lead with an unearned run on an RBI groundout by Jake Guenther in the second inning before Gateway responded on a two-out RBI single by Victor Castillo in the top of the third. The Grizzlies then went ahead 2-1 in the next inning on another two-out RBI hit by Tate Wargo, but two leadoff walks by Hill in the bottom half led to a Guenther sac fly, tying the game again.\nIt remained 2-2 until the eighth inning, and after the Grizzlies had runners at first and third base with one out, as well as the bases loaded with two outs but failing to score in the top of the eighth, Keegan Collett (0-1) came in for the bottom half, and retired the first two batters he faced. But Alberti Chavez would reach on an error by Abdiel Diaz and Scout Knotts would follow with a walk, bringing up Byrd, who fell behind 0-2 before hitting a fly ball to left-center field that Castillo nearly caught for the final out of the frame. But it dropped out of his glove for the Crushers' first (and, as it turned out) only hit of the game, scoring the go-ahead runs and making the score 4-2.\nThe Grizzlies would get a runner on base in the ninth inning on an error, bringing the tying run to the plate, but would not be able to score in suffering just their second series loss since the end of June. They will look to bounce back this weekend in the final series of the regular season at home against the Florence Y'alls at Grizzlies Ballpark. First pitch of the series opener is set for tomorrow, August 30, at 6:30 p.m. CT in Sauget.\nGateway Grizzlies Statistics\nâ€¢ Discuss this story on the\nFrontier League message board...\nFrontier League Stories from August 29, 2024\nThunderBolts Drop Series to Washington- Windy City ThunderBolts Boomers Survive a Nail-Biter in Home Finale- Schaumburg Boomers Byrd Rumbles to Third, Gives Crushers Late Win to Keep Pace in the West- Lake Erie Crushers Grizzlies Allow One Hit, But Lose at Lake Erie- Gateway Grizzlies Washer's Two Homers, Great Pitching Cap Regular Season Road Schedule- Washington Wild Things ValleyCats Inch Closer to Playoff Berth with Shutout Victory- Tri-City ValleyCats Y'alls Lulled to Sleep in Final Home Game- Florence Y'alls Jandron Tosses Quality Outing, Bats Fall Silent Again- Ottawa Titans Grizzlies Set for \"Greatest Night in Baseball\"- Gateway Grizzlies Tickets for ValleyCats \"Playoff Game A\" on Sale Now- Tri-City ValleyCats FL Recap- FL ThunderBolts Lose Late Lead, Fall to Washington- Windy City ThunderBolts Cristino's Multi-Hit Game Falls Short, Knockouts Drop Middle Bill- New England Knockouts Otters Can't Hold on in Game Two- Evansville Otters ValleyCats Bash Four Homers in Win Over Jackals- Tri-City ValleyCats Walk-off Keeps Boomers in Playoff Position- Schaumburg Boomers\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.",

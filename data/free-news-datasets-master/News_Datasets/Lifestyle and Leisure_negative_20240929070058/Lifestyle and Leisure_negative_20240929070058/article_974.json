    "text": "Summary - Americans previously never needed a visa to enter Europe. However, US citizens must soon apply for authorization and pay a new visa waiver through ETIAS to enter Europe starting in 2025. - This new requirement applies to 30 countries in the Schengen Zone to enhance travel safety. - Applying online in advance and paying the fee ensures swift authorization for ETIAS, which is valid for three years. Americans who traveled through Europe this summer could be among the last to do so without a new travel requirement. While places like TÃ¼rkiye have lifted visa requirements for Americans , the European Union wants to add a layer of protection to travelers by requiring citizens of countries outside of the EU, including Americans, to pay for a new visa waiver to enter Europe in 2025. While many European countries like American visitors , that fondness and eagerness to get them to spend their tourist dollars will not exempt US passport holders from the new visa waiver. Next year, countries in the European Union's Schengen Zone will be participating in the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). This means that places Americans could go this summer without a visa , including beautiful beach destinations that did not require a visa , will require one starting next year (rather, it's a visa waiver, not an actual visa). In total, 30 EU countries will require American travelers to submit an application to be processed by the European Travel Information Authorization System, in addition to having a valid passport. While this may seem like an unnecessary step, a few dollars and a quick application process seem like a small price to pay for the ultimate goal of keeping travelers safe and maintaining better border controls. [Related ](/countries-americans-cant-travel-to/) [ 7 Countries Americans Can't Travel To ](/countries-americans-cant-travel-to/) Americans can travel to many exotic places around the globe. Some countries, however, are off-limits. The European Travel Information & Authorization System Is The New Visa Waiver Americans Must Pay For Americans who want to travel to the 30 countries in the Schengen Zone must have an authorization processed through ETIAS The European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS) is the new travel authorization that Americans must pay for in 2025. While a US passport was enough to travel to 30 countries in the Schengen Zone in the past without a visa, visa-exempt travelers who plan on spending up to 90 days in these countries must now take an extra step to travel to Europe. For the rest of 2024, Americans can continue to travel to Europe without ETIAS. The new travel authorization is supposed to go into effect in mid-2025. This date is to give the new Entry/Exit System being installed in Europe time to go live and work out any hiccups. However, given that the ETIAS start date was delayed in 2021, 2023, and again in 2024, it remains to be seen if the program will truly go live in 2025. The goal of ETIAS is to make travel safer in Europe . As such, it is not just Americans that are being singled out for the new travel requirement. Nationals of 60 other countries will also have to apply for ETIAS when traveling to Europe. While this visa waiver was not required of Americans in the past, it is very similar to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) that the US already requires of other countries' nationals before they travel through the States. Consequently, the concept of ETIAS is not a new thing. It is just new to Americans who used to have all the documentation they needed to travel the world with a passport alone. [Related ](/visa-free-countries-for-americans/) [ 10 Visa-Free Countries You Can Visit With Just A Passport In 2024 ](/visa-free-countries-for-americans/) With the 7th strongest passport in the world, US citizens can choose 187 visa-free travel destinations. Countries That Will Require European Travel Information & Authorization System In 2025 Countries like France, Italy, Spain, and more will require Americans to obtain ETIAS authorization (and have a valid passport) to be granted entry 30 countries will require Americans and other visa-free travelers to apply for ETIAS, starting May 2025. Fortunately, once ETIAS has been granted, it is valid for all countries in Europe that require it for three years. As a result, it does not need to be applied for again for every European country visited. The countries that will require ETIAS to enter in 2025 include: Austria Czech Republic Germany Latvia Netherlands | | Slovakia Belgium Denmark Greece Liechtenstein Norway | | Slovenia Bulgaria Estonia Hungary Lithuania Poland | | Spain Croatia Finland Iceland Luxembourg Portugal | | Sweden Cyprus France Italy Malta Romania | | Switzerland Be advised that Americans will need to meet specific travel authorization requirements to be allowed entry if traveling to countries outside those requiring ETIAS. This includes both the UK and the Republic of Ireland.

Some of the countries on this list are more tourist-friendly than others. How To Apply For The European Travel Information & Authorization System Visa Waiver A quick online application and an $8.00 processing fee are all it takes to receive authorization from ETIAS to enter the EU In order to apply for ETIAS, American citizens will need to fill out an online application . This will need to be completed in the weeks before traveling. Some will have their ETIAS application processed and approved in hours, but most will have their ETIAS application authorized in less than a week. However, in some instances, it can take longer. Therefore, it is recommended by ETIAS.com that the sooner ETIAS is applied for, the better. \"A small percentage of applications may take up to four weeks to process if additional documentation is required from the applicant. If your ETIAS has not yet been approved, and you do not have any other travel authorization, you will not be able to enter a country within the European Union.\" - ETIAS.com Given that ETIAS is valid for three years, it may be worth applying and paying the $8.00 fee sooner rather than later to have the ETIAS portion of the travel documents completed and checked off the to-do list if there is a desire to travel to any of the countries in the Schengen Zone in that timeframe. To ensure there are no issues with the authorization process, Americans need to ensure their passport is not only valid but will not expire within three months of applying for ETIAS. If getting a passport for the first time or renewing a passport, that needs to be done and a new passport in hand before ETIAS will be approved. The last thing travelers want to do is add another item to their checklist when traveling abroad. However, by having ETIAS go live in 2025, Americans and others traveling to Europe will be that much safer, which is a concern for many traveling abroad today.",

    "text": "A popular cafe inside Bondi Icebergs swimming club in Sydney has abruptly shut down, in devastating news for longtime customers. The Crabbe Hole announced its closure on social media on Wednesday, with owner Andrew Crabbe saying the decision had come about quickly. “I never got to say goodbye to any of you,” he said. He apologised for not sorting out the “$10 entry fee debacle”, referencing the fact people could bypass the pool entry fee if they said they were cafe customers only. The Sydney Morning Herald reported the loophole had done the rounds on social media before being scrapped six months ago, meaning cafe customers had to pay the entry fee whether using the pool or not. “It was my undoing at the end,” Crabbe said. “I shall miss seeing you. Thanks for everything.” The cafe, situated on the pool deck of the famous tourist destination, had been operating for 17 years. The Sydney Morning Herald reported a new cafe will open in its place and Crabbe Hole staff had been offered jobs. Regular customers described The Crabbe Hole as an “institution” and said they were shocked by the news. “Devastating — our happy place in Bondi,” one person said. “We loved coming to The Crabbe Hole for breakfast overlooking the pool and ocean. You will be sorely missed but thanks for everything and all the best for your next adventure.” The Crabbe Hole and Bondi Icebergs Club was contacted for comment.",

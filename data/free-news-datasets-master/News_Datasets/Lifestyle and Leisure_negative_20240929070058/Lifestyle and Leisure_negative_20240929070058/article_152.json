Sign up He instead offered a montage of photos and clips from some of the unnamed restaurants, including a few he felt he was “obviously not the target audience for.” The montage revealed a few of the negatives Lee and his team discussed while dining, including unprofessional customer service and poor food preparation.\nNonetheless, the DMV did not disappoint entirely. Okonomi Asian Grille in Fairfax, Virginia rated a 8.5/10; Hong Kong Carryout in Southeast, D.C. received a 8.6; and Dukem, a classic Ethiopian restaurant on U Street was crowned “the best food we’ve had in D.C.” in his Aug. 24 review.\nAt Hong Kong Carryout on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue in Southeast, D.C., Lee paid for neighbors to eat free.\nHe offered Okonomi $2,000 to pay for free food for customers, in addition to $1,000 to help the restaurant recover from recent fake DoorDash scams.\nDukem Ethiopian restaurant on U Street NW, Lee crowned “the best food we’ve had in D.C,” noting its “robust sauce” and “earthy taste” in food. Lee gifted $1000 worth of food for following customers, plus $500 in individual tips to the restaurant owners.\nThe former MMA fighter remained committed to giving back to the DMV’s restaurant community. In a culmination of food orders, generous tips and community donations, Lee and his team were able to “sow $30,000 to various restaurants around the DMV,” according to the Aug. 26 TikTok post.\nIn his now viral video, he also criticized media outlets for minimizing the positive impact of his DMV tour.\n “A lot of media outlets picked up on the fact that I said restaurants out here, in my opinion, tend to lean towards promoting alcohol more than promoting food. That’s the headlines more than us being in the actual city and being blessed enough to touch the people that we’ve touched,” he said.\nAs social media reacted to Lee’s transparent take on Washington’s food scene, some agreed with his thoughts, while others questioned his recommendation sources as a whole.\nOne user on X (formerly known as Twitter) voiced that Lee’s experience would be different if he, himself, was not so restricted.\n“Two things can [be] true,” read the tweet . “Yes, the D.C. food scene isn’t all that it’s cracked out to be. However, Keith Lee’s palate is a bit limited and how he chooses to eat the food, takeout in the car, makes it challenging to fully experience some restaurants.”\nAs the Detroit, Michigan native made his way to Baltimore, according to Axios , there’s speculation of a positive review for the Jamaican food chain Jerk at Nite, which has several locations in the nation’s capital. Based on an Instagram post from the local food chain, Lee visited and offered “a kind-hearted donation” earlier last week that prompted the eatery to give out 200 free meals at the Langdon location on Aug. 27.\n“[Ten] years ago, we were selling food out of our dorm [at Howard University] and now we’re here,” read the caption. “[Lee] heard about us being a Howard University and D.C. community staple so we made sure he tasted our perseverance and passion on every plate. We hope we made D.C. proud!”\nTagged: DMV (District, Maryland, Virginia) , Dukem , Hong Kong Carryout , Jada Ingleton , Jerk at Nite , Keith Lee , Okonomi Asian Grille , TikTok Jada Ingleton wijingleton@gmail.com\nJada Ingleton is a Comcast Digital Equity Local Voices Lab contributing fellow through the Washington Informer.

    "text": "Alison’s close friend David Baker claimed to US Sun that the ‘Don’t Forget About Us’ singer ‘never tried to contact’ her older sister during their estrangement – not even to check on her Alison when she was put into hospice care weeks ago.\n“A phone call or, even better, a video call would mean so much to Alison. But it never came,” Baker said in the report on Tuesday.\nAccording to Baker, the older sister was “upset” that Mariah “cut off contact with her” and chose to keep her distance.\n“The harsh rejection hurt Alison’s pain more,” he said.\n“He talked about it often. He wondered if Mariah or any of her relatives would come to her funeral,” he added. “I was told a memorial service is planned for a future date, but nothing now.”\nRepresentatives for the singer did not immediately respond to her request Page Six for comment.\nOn Monday, Mariah confirmed the deaths of her sister and mother, Patricia Carey, who tragically died on the same day over the weekend.\n“I lost my mother last weekend. Unfortunately, in a tragic turn of events, my sister passed away that same day,” the 55-year-old “Emotions” creator said in a statement to People.\n“I feel blessed that I was able to spend the last week with my mom before she passed away. I appreciate everyone’s love, support and respect for my privacy during this difficult time.”\n#Mariah #Carey #Tough #Knew #sister #dying #called",

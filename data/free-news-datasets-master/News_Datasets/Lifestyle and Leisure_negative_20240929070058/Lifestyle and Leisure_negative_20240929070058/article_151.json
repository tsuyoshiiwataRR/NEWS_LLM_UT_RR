    "text": "YouTube’s ‘ElAnalistaDeBits’ has shared a comparison video between the gameplay reveal and the final version of Star Wars Outlaws. And, as we can see, the final version looks almost as good as the gameplay reveal trailer. There are some slight downgrades. However, the game looks almost as good as that trailer. So, what was downgraded you may ask. From what we can see, Ubisoft has reduced the amount of destructible objects in some scenes. To be honest, that’s not a big deal. However, the game’s explosions have taken a big hit. I honestly don’t get it. One of the main criticisms of Watch_Dogs was the huge downgrade of its explosions. And while the downgrade here is not THAT big, it’s still noticeable. So, I don’t know why Ubisoft keeps doing it. What’s even funnier here is that it should be possible to have the “gameplay reveal” explosion in the final version. So, I don’t know why Massive has reduced its visual effect. It makes no sense. It’s also worth noting that some other areas can look better than the reveal gameplay trailer. Take for instance a look at 7:50. That area looks better in the final version. What’s also important to note is that the physic effects remain the same. That was one of the things a lot of gamers thought wouldn’t be possible in the final version. Well, I’m happy to report that all the physics/wind effects you saw in the gameplay reveal trailer are still present here. Overall, Massive was able to match the quality of the gameplay reveal trailer. Yes, there are some minor changes and downgrades. However, the final product looks almost as good. In other words, we don’t have another “Watch_Dogs” on our hands. So, kudos to the devs for not dropping the ball. As I’ve said, I’m currently on vacation. Thus, we won’t have a day-1 PC Performance Analysis. Once I get back, I’ll be sure to test the final version, so stay tuned for more. Enjoy! John is the founder and Editor in Chief at DSOGaming.

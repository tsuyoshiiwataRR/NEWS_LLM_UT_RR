    "text": "Passengers diverted to Memphis due to “severe” turbulence share experience on United Airlines flight MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) - Multiple people are recovering from injuries after their plane leaving Mexico heading to Chicago had to make an emergency landing here in Memphis, Wednesday. “I thought we were landing,” said passenger Tyeisha Jefferson. “At one point, raised the blinds up like, No, we’re not landing. Grab hands and pray to Jesus. Lord help us.” Severe turbulence led United Airlines flight 1196 to divert to Memphis Wednesday. It’s the latest out of several commercial airline flights to experience this while taking to the skies this year. “We started in turbulence, and then we literally hit the worst air pockets there was so the flight attendant almost hit the ceiling,” said Patrick Froh. “People were really hurt. We have, we have stains all over our clothes because of food going everywhere. The ceiling is covered with food. It was one of the most traumatic things to be on a flight for.” The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the diversion. A spokesperson says the Boeing 737 headed from Cancun to Chicago experienced “severe turbulence” over Louisiana. The turbulence caused multiple injuries on board. One person was taken to the hospital. United Airlines says 179 people including crew were on board. “Because it’s rare, but it’s increasing, this is important for pilots, for airlines, for passengers, and also for the companies that make airplanes,” said Dr. John Knox, a professor of Geography and Atmospheric Scientist at the University of Georgia. Dr. John Knox, a professor and atmospheric scientist at the University of Georgia says there are two kinds of turbulence. One related to thunderstorms and the other clear-air turbulence when planes are at cruising altitude. Although rare, Dr. Knox says both seem to be increasing and will likely continue on that path in the future as the air gets warmer due to climate change. “They also have to take into account that those severe events, which were extremely rare, are going to become a little bit more common, and that actually will influence how they design airplanes,” said Dr. Knox. Passengers arrived at Chicago O’Hare International Airport about four hours after their stop in Memphis, many glad to be home. “I travel a lot,” said passenger Gustavo Nouel. “But in my 22 years, I’ve never had a flight like this.” [Click here](https://www.actionnews5.com/newsletter/) to sign up for our newsletter!

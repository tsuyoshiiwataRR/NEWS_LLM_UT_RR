    "text": "Breaking up with a narcissist is very different from ending a relationship with a typical person. Narcissists see relationships as a way to get admiration and maintain control, so a breakup can seriously hurt their pride. They often go through specific stages that show their strong need for attention and power. In this article, we will discuss the five stages a narcissist goes through when you separate from them. Stage 1: They become the eternal victim - Once you leave them, they fabricate a web of lies. They weave a narrative, and each part of it is based on their distorted perception of reality. To everyone they meet, they play the victim with one purpose: to make you look like the villain. The narcissist never takes a step back to consider the role they played in creating the situation they now pretend to cry about. They never miss or grieve you, and they never feel remorse or think they should have treated you better. Stage 2: They make you jealous - A narcissist depends on you more than you depend on them. They are more affected by your life than you are by theirs. To keep you hooked and hurt, they post pictures with their new supply online, ensuring you see them. They do this to trigger chronic self-doubt and make you ask questions like, \\\"Was I not enough? Why do they look so happy with this new person? Does that mean this new person is better, offering everything the narcissist needed, and I was a failure?\\\" The narcissist tries to stay involved in your life more than in the life they seem to be building with this new supply. They do not like to be ignored or forgotten. Stage 3: They start hoovering - They begin hoovering and might try to win you back. A narcissist cannot stand to see you moving on, breaking free, and starting to thrive. Their main goal is to make you suffer because that makes them feel powerful and in control. You might get a message from them on your birthday, the anniversary of no contact, or any other significant day — a milestone. Then the narcissist shows up, attempting to pull you back in, trigger regression, and make you lose all your progress by reinitiating contact and going through the same cycle once again. Hoovering is their last attempt to re-establish control. Stage 4: They run a massive smear campaign - When a narcissist can no longer control you directly, they will try to control how other people see you. They will reach out to your friends and family, spreading lie after lie to isolate you and bring as many people as possible to their side. When this starts happening, know that you have already won. They are desperate and helpless. They know they cannot get a hold of you, and their actions are a testament to their loss of control. This desperation is a clear indication that you are no longer within their grasp — emotionally or mentally. Stage 5: They repeat the cycle - In this final stage, the narcissist inevitably repeats the cycle with someone new, leaving a trail of emotional destruction in their wake. They move on, not to find a genuine connection or stability, but to seek a new person who can fulfill their endless need for attention and validation. The narcissist's inability to maintain stable, loving relationships becomes glaringly evident as they shift their focus to a new target. Each relationship is merely a reflection of the previous one, characterized by the same deceit, emotional exploitation, and eventual abandonment.

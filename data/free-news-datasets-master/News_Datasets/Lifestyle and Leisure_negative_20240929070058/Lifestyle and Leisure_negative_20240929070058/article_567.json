    "text": "Currency\nWhy oatmeal doesn't taste good: don't make these mistakes\nMany people think oatmeal is a boring and unpalatable porridge. But this is far from true. Such a nutritious product you just need to cook correctly.\nFoodOboz editorial staff will tell you about the most common mistakes that are often made during the preparation of oatmeal. They should be corrected.\nDo not pour cold water over the oatmeal\nIn order for oatmeal to have a successful consistency, you should only put it in boiling water. In no case should you pour oatmeal with cold water and then boil it.\nIn this case, the groats in the water should be poured immediately after the liquid boils. But if you cook oatmeal on milk, it should still be poured into cold milk. Only after that you can put the container on the fire.\nDo not cook oatmeal without salt\nEven if you are cooking sweet porridge, salt should also definitely be added. And it should be done at the very beginning of cooking.\nDo not cook oatmeal in a small bowl\nSo that the porridge does not boil away and has a successful consistency, choose a deep enough pot for it. In addition, the product in a large container with thick walls will turn out really delicious.\nDon't forget to stir\nOatmeal needs to be stirred quite often. If you don't, the porridge will quickly burn and will look like one solid lump.\nDo not steam your porridge, but boil it\nReal wholesome oatmeal needs to be boiled. Everything else is difficult to call oatmeal. For the cereal to absorb the necessary amount of liquid, it needs 5-10 minutes.",

    "text": "Jeremy Clarkson's new pub hit by scammers DAYS after opening as fans issued urgent warning: 'Please report!'\nPA\nBy\n<a href=\"https://www.gbnews.com/authors/alex-davies\">Alex Davies\n</a>\nPublished: 30/08/2024- 09:24\nJeremy Clarkson's new business venture, The Farmer's Dog pub, has had to issue a rather concerning statement.\nThe pub, located in Asthall just outside Burford in Oxfordshire, has only been open a week but thousands and thousands of fans have already flocked to get a peek inside.\nClarkson not only has the pub to attract punters to the location but has also erected a miniature off-licence, butcher's, Diddly Squat Farm Shop, and food truck - named the Farmer's Puppy.\nThere are also sprawling green spaces around the pub for visitors to relax and soak in the picturesque views.\nWith so much on offer, it's no surprise how popular the Farmer's Dog has become since opening - its Instagram page already has 182,000 followers and counting.\nAnd it was on said Instagram page where Clarkson's new pub had to urge fans to be vigilant after imposters emerged online disguising themselves as the Cotswolds drinking establishment.\nTaking to Instagram, The Farmer's Dog posted a screenshot of a Facebook page that is impersonating the pub.\nThe caption of the post read: \"There is a FAKE FB page impersonating us and running giveaways.\n\"Please block and report it,\" Clarkson's pub urged. \"Our official FB page is The Farmers Dog Pub.\" (sic)\nThe words \"FAKE PAGE\" were written elsewhere on the screenshot while the fake page in question disguised itself to social media users with the description: \"The Farmers Dog Pub Owned and Run by Jeremy Clarkson.\"\nThe Farmer's Dog urged fans to report a scam page\nAt the time of the scam warning, the page had accumulated 671 likes and over 1,000 followers.\nThere is also another Instagram account under the handle @thefarmerdogpub too which isn't affiliated with Clarkson and co - it has 6,668 followers.\nClarkson himself hasn't publicly addressed the imposter accounts cropping up as he's been keeping himself busy with the day to day running of the pub.\nGB News attended the opening of the pub to speak exclusively with Clarkson about the impact The Farmer's Dog will have on British farmers given he's pledged to only use British produce.\n\"A tiny pinprint. But if everybody does it...\" Clarkson began.\n\"I keep thinking if farmers get together - because you can buy a pub for chicken feed these days - get together and they share the workload it might work. I'll let you know in a year.\"\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS:\nHe also told press at the grand opening that the prime minister,\nSir Keir Starmer, is \"banned\" from enjoying a pint there.\n\"No, he's banned,\" Clarkson told Times Radio. \"Actually he's the first person to be banned. He's actually on a board in the hall, he's banned.\n\"He hasn't done much to endear himself to me yet. We'll have a look at farming (though). It might turn around, you never know.\"\nClarkson was speaking prior to the prime minister confirming there had been talks to ban smoking cigarettes in outdoor spaces and pub gardens.",

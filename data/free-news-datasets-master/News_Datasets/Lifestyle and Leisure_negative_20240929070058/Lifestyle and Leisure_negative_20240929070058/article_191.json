After 28 years together and 21 years of marriage, we have decided to file for divorce.\"\nShe went on to say, \"This decision came after a lot of thought and care, and as hard as divorce is, we are approaching this with a positive outlook because we know it’s what’s best for us.\n\"We are proud of how we have worked through this together.\"\nThe King of Queens actress continued, \"Yes, we’re sad, and we’ve got some figuring out to do as we continue to move forward into our new normal—together still in many ways, and apart in some new ones.\nMore Celebrity News\n\"But here’s the thing: we’ve been best friends for so many years. We are still celebrating holidays together, watching our favorite tv shows together, and gathering as a family.\n\"So, the big question—why?\"\n\"To put it simply, we both changed, as people do, and we got used to playing roles that didn’t fit us anymore,\" she added.\n\"After a lot of effort and consideration, we’ve decided to take this step, which reflects who we are today.\"\nMost read in Celebrity\nLeah assured fans, \"Our bond is still strong—it’s just evolved into something different.\n\"We think a marriage that lasted this long and created so many beautiful memories, especially raising our incredible daughter, is something to celebrate.

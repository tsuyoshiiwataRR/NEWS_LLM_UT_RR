    "text": "Mbappé Struggles as Real Madrid Draws Against Las Palmas Kylian Mbappé failed to score as Real Madrid settled for a 1-1 draw against Las Palmas in the Spanish league. Vinicius Junior scored Madrid's only goal, while Barcelona secured their third consecutive win. Girona earned its first win with a 4-0 thrashing of Osasuna. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Madrid | Updated: 30-08-2024 09:42 IST | Created: 30-08-2024 09:42 IST - Country: - Spain Kylian Mbappé remained scoreless as defending champion Real Madrid managed only a 1-1 draw against Las Palmas in the Spanish league. Mbappé, Madrid's high-profile summer signing, has yet to find the net in domestic league play. His sole goal for the club came in the UEFA Super Cup against Atalanta earlier in the month. Vinicius Junior was the scorer for Madrid, which had beaten Valladolid 3-0 in the previous round but kicked off its title defense with a 1-1 draw against Mallorca. Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"It's been difficult for us to be as solid as we were last season. We need to find a solution quickly.\" Vinicius scored his first league goal this season with a 69th-minute penalty kick after a handball inside the area. The hosts Las Palmas took an early lead five minutes into the match through Alberto Moleiro, who scored from inside the area. Young Brazilian forward Endrick, who scored on his debut against Valladolid, came on in the 86th minute to replace Vinicius Junior. Las Palmas is yet to win this season, having earlier drawn against Sevilla and lost to Leganes. Meanwhile, Barcelona became the only team to secure three wins in three rounds after a 2-1 victory over Rayo Vallecano. Girona also saw success, clinching their first win with a 4-0 demolition of Osasuna. Bryan Gil, Viktor Tsygankov, Abel Ruiz, and Cristhian Stuani all contributed to Girona's victory. Girona had started the season with a draw and a loss, while Osasuna had a draw and a win from its first two matches. (With inputs from agencies.)

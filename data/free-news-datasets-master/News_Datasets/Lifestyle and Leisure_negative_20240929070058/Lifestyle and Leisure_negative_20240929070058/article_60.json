    "text": "Slipknot turntablist Sid Wilson found himself in the hospital after he suffered burns across most of his body earlier this month. However, the injuries weren’t due to malfunctioning stage pyrotechnics. Instead, Wilson suffered burns while dealing with a burn pile on his Iowa farm.\nWilson shared how the incident happened online. “A few nights ago, I lit it and let it burn down,” he said of the burn pile. “So, the next day, I went to check and see, you know, how much was left, if anything. There was a certain amount of debris around the side still left. So I, like a dummy, did what I’m not supposed to do and I added some gas to it,” he explained.\nIn a recent interview with Fox News , Wilson gave an update on his physical and mental health after the burns.\n[RELATED: Slipknot’s Sid Wilson Hospitalized After Suffering Burns on Face and Arms]\nSlipknot’s Sid Wilson Gives an Update on His Injuries Sid Wilson spent the night in the hospital before returning home to heal. “My whole right arm is bandaged up, half of my left arm,” he said. “My face is basically melted from the nose down. But the swelling’s gone down, and they said the face is kind of amazing that it’s regenerative, it happens real fast, seems to heal quickly,” Wilson added. “I’ve had better days, I guess, but I’m alive, so I’m doing good.”\nWilson is healing and seems to be in good spirits for the most part. “I’m not going to let it get me depressed,” he said of the incident. “The hardest part is just feeling stupid for doing it. It’s not even the physical part. It’s thinking, ‘Oh, man, I really learned that the hard way. I’ve got to make sure I just slow down sometimes and really examine the situation before I just dive in headfirst,” he added.\nAccording to a statement from the band, Wilson will join Slipknot when their Here Comes the Pain Tour resumes on September 1 at the Rocklahoma Festival in Pryor, Oklahoma.\nWilson walked away from the incident with a piece of advice for everyone. “Don’t f—k with fire. It’s going to win every time.”\nFeatured Image by Daniel DeSlover/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock",

    "text": "DEAR ABBY: My sister and I grew up with our father after our parents divorced. He was a hoarder. Years later, when he finally had to move out, it took three moving trucks to empty the two-bedroom house. You can imagine what that was like. I am very triggered by clutter. I appreciate an organized home with space to breathe. My husband of 10 years understands this, theoretically. For a long time, he was on board with a more austere setup. But recently we’ve become more comfortable financially, and he has started collecting things. First, it was comic books; then a pile of vinyl records showed up. More recently, a set of art supplies seems to always be spilling over the counters and tables. He says his acquisitions are well within what is normal. I know my background makes me overly sensitive about cleaning, but it’s really hard, and I’m stressed out every time I come home to piles of random objects and must move his stuff before I can make dinner. We don’t have space for a “man cave.” I am in counseling, which helps, but not enough. How can we reach a reasonable compromise when I know I might not be reasonable? — TRIGGERED IN ARKANSAS DEAR TRIGGERED: An alternative to throwing away your marriage along with the clutter might be to consider hiring a professional organizer to assist your husband in organizing his comic books, vinyl record collection and art supplies so they are less obtrusive. Other couples have done this successfully when blending two households, and it could be the answer for you.",

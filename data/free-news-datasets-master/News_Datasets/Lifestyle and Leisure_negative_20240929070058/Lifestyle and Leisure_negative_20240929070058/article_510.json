    "text": "[TellychakkarTeam](/users/tellychakkarteam)on Fri, 08/30/2024 - 11:12 MUMBAI: Anupamaa is presently ruling our television screens. The show is doing exceptionally well and is topping the weekly BARC ratings. Rupali Ganguly plays the lead role while Gaurav Khanna plays the role of her husband Anuj. These days the track revolves around Anupama going to the US. Also Read- [Spoiler Alert! Anupamaa: Anupama gets manipulated by Maya; Maya's secret man revealed](https://www.tellychakkar.com/spoiler-alert/spoiler-alert-anupamaa-anupama-gets-manipulated-maya-mayas-secret-man-revealed-230203) As of late, we have witnessed Anupama assure Aadya that she will always come to her aid and to stop worrying, which makes Aadya feel wonderful. But when Anupama discovers Megha's motivation, she becomes sorry for her. But because she is aware of her pain, she won't allow her to continue controlling Aadya. When Anupama makes the crucial arrangements to bring Aadya back to the house and to make Anuj happy, the story takes an intriguing turn. However, Anuj acts like a far worse man around Anupama, but she didn't mind because, unlike Ajun, she has a pure soul. We'll witness Anupama's health deteriorate in the next episodes following her reunion with Aadya. Megha offers to help, but she demands treatment from Aadya in return. Also Read- [Spoiler Alert!

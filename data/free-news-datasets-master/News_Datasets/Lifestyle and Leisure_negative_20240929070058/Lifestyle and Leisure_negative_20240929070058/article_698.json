    "text": "Venom: The Last Dance is the third and final movie in the series starring Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock and despite fans being excited for its arrival, some are confused by a post-credit Spider-Man scene. I am going into spoilers for [Spider-Man](https://www.gamingbible.com/spider-man): No Way Home’s post-credit scene which leaves more questions than it does answers, but not in a good way. No Way Home was nothing short of an epic [movie](https://www.gamingbible.com/tv-and-film) and after its conclusion, [Marvel](https://www.gamingbible.com/marvel) fans were teased that Tom Holland’s friendly neighbourhood hero is set to collide with Tom Hardy’s Venom. Check out Venom: The Last Dance trailer below! In a recent [Venom: The Last Dance](https://www.gamingbible.com/news/tv-and-film/marvel/venom-the-last-dance-teaser-confirms-release-date-797851-20240313) trailer, we see Baron Karl Amadeus Mordo played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, who we first met in Doctor Strange (2016). In a post-credit [No Way Home](https://www.gamingbible.com/news/tv-and-film/marvel/spiderman-no-way-home-voted-best-mcu-movie-220474-20240112) scene, we see Tom Hardy’s Eddie Brock at a bar before being pulled away into another multiverse. Advert Mordo also visits this bar in No Way Home and is reminiscent of the character seen in the Doctor Strange movies. However, Mondo is seen again in Venom: The Last Dance trailer but this time, he is kitted out in military gear and looks nothing like the sorcerer that we know him to be. This, understandably, has confused the heck out of Marvel fans and to be honest, it’s confused me too. Is this the same Mordo from the MCU or is it a totally different character for Sony’s Spider-Man Universe? “So you’ve got Chiwetel Ejiofor in Venom: The Last Dance as a new character, which takes place in its own universe. But right here he’s in the MCU and he’s not playing Baron Mordo, who he previously played in the MCU… and he’s taking back the symbiote that was left in the MCU. Good Job Sony!” tweeted CS11__. “I have questions. Like, why cast the actor that plays Mordo? Why was not-Mordo in 616 collecting the symbiote? Doesn’t that ruin No Way Home’s post-credit scene? Does this mean no Venom in Spider-Man 4?” exclaimed Th3birdman15. So many questions but so few answers. Hopefully, it will start to make sense when Venom: The Last Dance arrives in cinemas on 25 October 2025.

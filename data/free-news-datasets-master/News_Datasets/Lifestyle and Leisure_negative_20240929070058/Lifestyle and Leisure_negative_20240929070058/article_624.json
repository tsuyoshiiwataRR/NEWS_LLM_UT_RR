    "text": "I have a feeling you’re going to have some real insight to this piece.\nIn fact, I’d hedge bets that you’re already laughing about a certain delusion the narcissist in your life has had over the time you’ve known them.\nYes, it’s true that narcissists come with a self-centered air of delusion around them. But it’s more than that. It goes beyond simply thinking they’re the best, or that they live in a world of their own.\nIt actually almost makes me pity the narcissist, actually.\nI said almost…\nSo – what is it about delusion that seems to sit so well with narcissists?\nDid You Say Delusional?\nHard to believe, right?\nWrong!\nDelusion goes hand in hand with anybody narcissistic. If you’re unlucky enough, you’ll get to witness it in action.\nNarcissists really do believe they are a gift from God. They act as though they’re walking angels upon this green earth, and that everybody must stop and be in constant awe of them.\nOh dear.\nOnly those who are clued up on narcissism can see through this act.\nThe Driving Force of a Narcissist\nDelusion has to be the driving force behind all narcissistic people. If they were just themselves, they wouldn’t get a fraction of the attention they get in the shoes of their masked alter-egos.\nThey need those delusional thoughts in order to impress.It’s how they justify their heavily entitled view of themselves.\nAnd it’s how they get the average person to fall at their feet and believe every single word they say.\nExamples of Narcissistic Delusion\nSo let’s get right into this!\n#1 That They’re The Best\nShow me a narcissist who doesn’t think they’re the best, and I will show you a fake narcissist.\nNow, it doesn’t matter at all what ‘the best’ is defined as, because narcissists don’t always have to be specific.\nThis can be anything from, “I am so much better than everybody in this room, I’m almost bored,” to, “I am the best and nobody is better than me in the whole world!”\nWhen thinking about this form of delusion, you can also get way more specific.\n“I work as a hairdresser, and I am the best in my field. I would do a much better job than any celebrity stylist.”\n“I was chosen for the promotion because there is literally nobody else in the world who is able to do the job as well as I can.”\n“My child cannot even do their homework by themselves. They need me to help them with their math, obviously the teacher doesn’t know what he’s talking about.”\nIn reality, they might be great at their job, or exceptional at math. Does that make them ‘the best?’ Define the best, anyway? Narcissists don’t care about who else might come in and be better, they don’t want to talk about it.\nFor them, they are the best, and that’s final.\n#2 They’re Never Wrong\nYou know, you could back a narcissist into a corner of a room and tell them they’re wrong, and they still wouldn’t believe you.\nNarcissists. Always. Have. To. Be. Right. It goes so much deeper than that, though! This is not just wanting to be right, it’s automatically knowing they’re always right.\nNobody argues. Nobody Questions. Everybody accepts.\nIt’s delusional for obvious reasons, right?\nI mean, nobody on this earth is right all the time. Nobody.\nWe get things wrong. We misjudge. We misinterpret. We count change wrong. We sometimes pay our bills late because we forget.\nThese things are nobody’s fault but ourselves. And we don’t mean to, but we’re human. So how can you convince a narcissist that they’re wrong?\nYou can’t! Stop wasting your time!\n#3 Everyone Loves Them\nNot true. A lot of people will dislike the narcissist in your life, even if it doesn’t seem that way to you. The reason they dislike them is because they long figured out who the person behind the mask was.\nYou’ll hear words like, ‘arrogant,’ or, ‘sensitive,’ or even, ‘miserable.’ Narcissists are good at blanking people who don’t matter in that moment, and those people, it can actually seem rude. It’s enough for them to make their own minds up.\nThen of course, you’ll have those who have had direct run-ins with them. The ex partners too.\nThe fact is – they aren’t loved, or even liked, by some people.\nNarcissists are way too ignorant and entitled to be aware of this, as they live firmly in their own egotistical bubble.\n#4 They’re Never Afraid\nNarcissists live in a world of fear, but you’d never know. The reason you’d never know is because they hide it so well. It’s the reason their personality is seemingly so big. They’re some of the most confident people you’ll ever meet.\nNarcissists also love to tell people who much they’re worth, or the adventures they seek. They play on their own strengths daily, and will ensure you know everything there is to know about them.\nNow let’s dig a little deeper…\nNarcissists act. They play – and when I say it, I really mean it. They have not got a brave bone in their body. They fear you leaving, they fear not being good enough, and they fear being caught out.\nWhat does that tell you about them?\nWell, personally speaking, I feel it leaves narcissists looking as though they constantly need to fit in. They have to. Not wanting to be the ones left out, it’s in their best interests for people to see them as ‘one of them.’\nAs a result, these toxic people are going to do what it takes to hide their utmost fears that derive from needing to be perfect from a young age.\nThey will bury their fears, and hide them with a personality so toxic that nobody will suspect what’s underneath. The charm will coat their insecurities, but this coat will eventually wear off.\nNarcissists don’t see it that way – as they deem themselves a force of unbreakable nature. Their delusion is wrapped around the idea that they are better than everybody else, and will forever remain so.\n#5 Finances…\nThis is probably the most entertaining of all. Narcissists love to appear rich because it gives them a boost to the status they’re trying to live by. If something has a price tag on it, you’re going to need to assume two things:\n- The price tag is the most expensive. To the narcissist, if you own a lot, you’re worth a lot.\n- The narcissist is living an enviable life where they can simply afford to buy whatever they want.\nBoth are delusional. Money is materialistic, and you cannot buy a kind heart or soul with it. The right people won’t be impressed by price tags.",

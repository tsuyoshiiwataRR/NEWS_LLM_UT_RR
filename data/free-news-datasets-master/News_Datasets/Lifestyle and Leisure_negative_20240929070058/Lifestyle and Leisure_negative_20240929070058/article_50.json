    "text": "During their first season in the Big Ten, the Washington Huskies are going to be missing a promising piece at defensive tackle. On Thursday, coach Jedd Fisch announced that redshirt sophomore Armon Parker will miss the year with an injury.\n“Armon Parker will not be able to play this year,” Fisch said. “His injury was a season-ender.”\nAfter being an exciting find for coach Kalen DeBoer’s staff as a late addition to the 2022 recruiting class along with his twin brother Jayvon, Parker has struggled with injuries throughout his Washington career. Before signing with the Huskies, Armon suffered a torn ACL that cost him his freshman season, while his brother proved to be a vital asset to the defensive tackle rotation and burned his redshirt.\n“I think they might have leaned on each other there,” Fisch added. “Hats off to Armon, our training staff, and our strength staff that they’ve been able to keep him positive.”\nArmon has yet to take his first snap next to his brother, or his first snap in purple and gold for that matter and will have to wait until 2025 for that opportunity.",

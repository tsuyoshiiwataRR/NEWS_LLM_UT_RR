    "text": "Naomi Osaka Eliminated from U.S. Open 2024 in Second Round Defeat by Karolina Muchova [Naomi Osaka](https://www.justjared.com/tags/naomi-osaka/) is out of the U.S. Open after just two rounds. The 26-year-old 4-time Grand Slam winner lost in her second round match at the 2024 U.S. Open on Thursday night (August 29) in New York City. Naomi was eliminated 6-3, 7-6 (5) by Czech player [Karolina Muchova](https://www.justjared.com/tags/karolina-muchova/). [The New York Post](https://nypost.com/2024/08/29/sports/naomi-osaka-out-of-us-open-with-loss-to-karolina-muchova/) noted that Naomi made 21 unforced errors during the match, with 17 of them being in the second set. While Naomi used to be ranked No. 1 in the world, she’s currently ranked No. 88 after taking nearly a year and a half off of work to focus on her mental health and to welcome her first child into the world. We’re sure she’ll be back up the rankings in no time!

I think she may have died with a lot of loneliness and pain.” AFP\nEmbed Instagram Instagram URL\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by La Biennale di Venezia (@labiennale)\nMore On This Topic On the Italian trail of a sad diva, Maria Callas Brad Pitt says ‘vindictive’ Angelina Jolie sold winery stake to ‘intentionally’ damage his reputation Join ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.\nCelebrities Movies Opera Film festivals/awards Italy United States More Whatsapp Linkedin Twitter FB Messenger Email Print Copy permalink https://str.sg/L9ZG Read this subscriber-only article for free!

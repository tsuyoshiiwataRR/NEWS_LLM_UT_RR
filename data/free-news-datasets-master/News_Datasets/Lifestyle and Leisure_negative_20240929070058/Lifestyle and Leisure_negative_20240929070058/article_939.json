    "text": "If you haven’t torn your anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), chances are you know someone who has. About 1 in every 3,500 people—about two to eight times more commonly, women —tear their ACL every year, and almost half of all knee injuries are ACL tears. That leaves thousands of people each year asking: “Can you walk with a torn ACL?”\nThe knee joint is a network of bones, ligaments, tendons, and other tissues that help the knee bend, bear weight, and pivot the body. The ACL is a ligament in charge of stabilizing the joint: a strong band of tissue running diagonally in the middle of the knee and connecting the thigh bone to the shin bone.\nSome motions that commonly trigger tears include sudden direction changes, jumping and landing awkwardly, and knee hyperextension. These injuries most commonly occur in soccer, skiing , or basketball, where there are a lot of quick-pivot movements that stress the knee joint. Those aren’t typically motions found in hiking, but plenty of cross-training hikers find themselves with an ACL tear.\nKnees are famously a hiker’s weak link. If you’ve ever heard a “pop” followed by knee joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and instability, you might think that your uphill or downhill hiking career is completely over . However, that’s far from true.\nWhat’s the difference between torn ACL and strained ACL? ACL injuries include a spectrum of partial and complete tears, your treatment and prognosis depend on where you fall on it. Between 10 and 30 percent of ACL injuries are partial tears. A partial tear means the ligament has been loosened or overstretched, and only one of the two fiber bundles that make up the ACL have been torn. There’s still pain and swelling, but the recovery is a bit easier compared to a full tear.\nA complete tear is obviously more severe—and, also, more common. This type of injury tears the ligament completely in half or pulls it directly off the bone, making the knee joint pretty unstable. These likely need surgery.\nCan you fully bend your knee with a torn ACL? Likely not. A torn ACL can cause restricted range of motion, so bending and straightening your knee won’t be as easy as it was before. With a torn ACL, walking or hiking up and down hills or steps is a no-go until the pain and swelling goes down.\nCan you move normally with a torn ACL? It all depends on the severity of the injury. Some can walk—sometimes, even jog—with a torn ACL. It’s frowned upon to hike with a torn ACL; putting more stress on it, through inclines, long walks, or unstable terrain, can make a small tear even worse.\nYou can move normally in the sense that you can putter around the house and take yourself from room to room. In fact, two common goals many ACL patients need to achieve before getting surgery is being able to fully straighten the injured leg and being able to walk normally.\nHow can a hiker manage with an ACL injury? Because you can technically walk before getting surgery, there’s certainly an allure to sneak in an easy, flat hike. But, you have to wait until well after surgery and avoid leg-balancing movements that put a lot of stress on a torn ACL, like stepping over a fallen log or hiking on a technical trail.\nMost people choose to have an ACL tear surgically repaired, especially if they want to return to the same level of pre-injury physical activity. About a month or two after surgery, you can start to explore short, flat trails. You can’t push it here: Typically, the ACL graft is most delicate during the first 6 to 8 weeks after surgery, so you certainly should use trekking poles and knee braces for stability. Knee braces keep the knee joint secure, while preventing re-injury and supporting the rest of the leg throughout the hike.\nWith the guidance of your doctor, gradually increase the difficulty of your hikes throughout the course of several months. But, generally, it will be nine to 10 months after surgery before you can return to intense hikes.",

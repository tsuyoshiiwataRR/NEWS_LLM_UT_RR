    "text": "Viewers have slated Adam Sandler over his 'messy' new Netflix special, Love You, after claiming they couldn't hear anything Viewers have slated Adam Sandler over his 'messy' new Netflix special, claiming they turned the whole thing off after just a few minutes.\nThe Grown Ups actor returned to his comedy roots with a new program, titled Love You, which premiered on the streaming platform on August 27.\nIt served as a follow-up to the 57-year-old's 2018 special, 100% Fresh, and saw him performing for delighted fans, dressed in his signature, casual style of a hoodie, a colorful T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms.\nHowever, despite flying straight into the Netflix Top 10 list, many weren't thrilled by the quality of the 74-minute episode and flocked to social media to share their issues.\nOrganic-Hovercraft-3 revealed their thoughts in a lengthy message on the Netflix Reddit page, penning: 'Let me start out by saying Ive been a big fan of the sandman for decades. With that being said, this special was f**king awful.\n'The audio was absolute dog s**t. Adam mumbling, everyone else just so loud, including the crowd. The sound engineer needs to be fired. All the scripted pieces that are supposed to be candid are tacky and take away from the special.\nAdam Sandler's Netflix special premiered this month (Picture: Netflix)\n'We all pay $25-30 a month for Netflix because it is supposed to be hi quality – both the audio and visuals. And here I am watching some special that looks, and sounds like, it was filmed on a Motorola Razr. Anyone else feel the sams? Or am I f**king crazy?…\nRishma Dosani",

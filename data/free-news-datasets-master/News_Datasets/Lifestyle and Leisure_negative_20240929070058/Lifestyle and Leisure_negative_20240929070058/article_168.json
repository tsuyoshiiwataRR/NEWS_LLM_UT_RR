    "text": "Following a months-long controversy stirred by resident complaints about pervasive pickleball noise and traffic congestion at Szymanski Park, the South Burlington City Council has reduced the hours of playtime allowed at the park. Pickleball players are now only allowed to whack their paddles from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. The issue boiled over two months ago when a neighboring resident, Jovana Guarino, started circulating a petition about the noise and safety problems associated with the sport’s growing popularity. Since that time, the petition has garnered more than 75 signatures and council members have been bouncing solutions to the problem. At a council meeting last week, director of recreation and parks Adam Matth outlined multiple options for sound mitigation barriers to be placed at the park, but those efforts could have cost the city more than of $30,000. Matth said he frequented the park 14 times at various times of the day to catch decibel readings for the noise from three different areas across the park. Outside the courts, he said, on average, the sound reading was 63 decibels. From the parking lot, that number dipped to an average of 46. Outside of the park was slightly higher at 51. “From my time at the park, frequency of usage, and areas of complaints (traffic/parking lights and noise), I do not feel like the park currently warrants this financial contribution,” he said about the sound barriers. More conservative alternatives the city could explore would be to plant natural sound barriers like trees. The city council ultimately moved not to invest any funds yet but instead took an initial step with reduced hours. “I assume also when we go forward to have a review of our open space, we will be considering what is the demand for pickleball use in the city, and how we, in a proactive way, make decisions that will minimize the inconvenience that may exist or is at least perceived by some who live in proximity,” councilor Mike Scanlan said. The council did clarify that although pickleball hours are reduced, the park remains open from dawn until dusk.",

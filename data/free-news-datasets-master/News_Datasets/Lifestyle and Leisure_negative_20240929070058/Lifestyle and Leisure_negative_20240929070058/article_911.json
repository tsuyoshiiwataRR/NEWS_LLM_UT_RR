Directed by Sean McNamara, with a script written by Howard Klausner based on Paul Kengor's book, The Crusader: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism , the film follows the life of Ronald Reagan from his childhood to his time as president of the United States, told through a conversation between two former KGB agents. Quaid stars as Reagan alongside Penelope Ann Miller, Robert Davi, Lesley-Anne Down, and Jon Voight in supporting roles.\nNow, with reviews published and Reagan released in theaters, the film is fiercely dividing critics and audiences. On Rotten Tomatoes , Reagan has a 25% score from critics and a 97% audience score , recently renamed the Popcornmeter. These scores are only based on 28 reviews from critics and 50+ verified ratings from users, so they are subject to change over time.\nRelated Where To Watch Reagan: Showtimes & Streaming Status Ronald Reagan's life and presidency in America is the subject of Dennis Quaid's biopic movie, and there are options for where to watch Reagan.\n2 Why Reagan Is Dividing Critics & Audiences What Are The Reviews Saying? Close As a former president with a deeply polarizing legacy, a film about Ronald Reagan is bound to be a divisive feat . The film was actually born out of controversy involving producer Mark Joseph, who was inspired to make his own biopic after the 2003 miniseries, The Reagans , was widely criticized by conservatives as an unbalanced and inaccurate depiction of the 40th president. Also, leading up to Reagan 's release, Facebook temporarily blocked the film from advertising on the platform since its ads were seen as an effort to sway the 2024 United States elections.\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Already controversial leading up to its release, Reagan has received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics , who describe the biopic as a shallow, hagiographic, and one-sided portrayal of Ronald Reagan. While a few reviews acknowledge Quaid's strong performance as the former president , they largely criticize the film's lack of depth and overly idealized depiction of Reagan. A few positive reviews highlight the film's appeal to conservative audiences, but still, the consensus is that Reagan is a plodding and superficial effort that fails to provide meaningful insight into its subject's life.\nOn the other hand, verified audience reviews on Rotten Tomatoes paint a very different picture , consistently praising the biopic for its portrayal of Ronald Reagan's life and presidency. Like critics, they highlight Quaid's exceptional performance in capturing Reagan's essence, voice, and mannerisms. Audiences describe the film as both a compelling biography and a nostalgic reminder of Reagan's impact on America, emphasizing his patriotism and leadership during the Cold War. With the film now playing in theaters, audiences can see Reagan and form their own opinions.\nSource: Rotten Tomatoes\nReagan (2024) 0 Your Rating 5 stars 4.5 stars 4 stars 3.5 stars 3 star 2.5 stars 2 stars 1.5 stars 1 stars 0.5 star Rate Now Submit Rate Now Edit Leave a Review\nYour comment has not been saved\nNot Rated Biography Drama History Reagon follows the life of the 40th president of the United States, Ronald Reagan, from his time as a young boy through his tenure in the Oval Office.\nDirector Sean McNamara Release Date August 30, 2024 Writers Paul Kengor , Howard Klausner , Jonas McCord Cast Dennis Quaid , David Henrie , Robert Davi , Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa , Mena Suvari , Jon Voight , Penelope Ann Miller , Lesley-Anne Down Character(s) Ronald Reagan , Young Adult Reagan , Leonid Brezhnev , Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone , Jane Wyman , Viktor Novikov , Nancy Reagan , Margaret Thatcher Runtime 136 Minutes Main Genre Biography Expand Movies Reagan Your changes have been saved\nEmail is sent\nEmail has already been sent\nclose Please verify your email address.\nSend confirmation email close You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.\nManage Your List Follow Followed Follow with Notifications Follow Unfollow Close Thread 2 Sign in to your ScreenRant account We want to hear from you!

    "text": "Leah Remini & Angelo Pagan Split, Announce They're Divorcing After 21 Years of Marriage [Leah Remini](https://www.justjared.com/tags/leah-remini/) and her husband of over 20 years, [Angelo Pagan](https://www.justjared.com/tags/angelo-pagan/), are getting a divorce! The longtime couple have been together for nearly 30 years and just announced they are separating, revealing why and what’s next. “Well, here we are. After 28 years together and 21 years of marriage, we have decided to file for divorce,” Leah started out in a joint post on Keep reading to find out more… “This decision came after a lot of thought and care, and as hard as divorce is, we are approaching this with a positive outlook because we know it’s what’s best for us,” she continued. “Yes, we’re sad, and we’ve got some figuring out to do as we continue to move forward into our new normal—together still in many ways, and apart in some new ones.” “But here’s the thing: we’ve been best friends for so many years. We are still celebrating holidays together, watching our favorite tv shows together, and gathering as a family,” Leah added. As for why they are divorcing, the actress wrote, “To put it simply, we both changed, as people do, and we got used to playing roles that didn’t fit us anymore. After a lot of effort and consideration, we’ve decided to take this step, which reflects who we are today.” They will still continue to be in each others lives. Leah and Angelo first met in 1996 and got married in 2003. They are parents to one daughter, Sofia Bella, 20. He also has three sons, Angelo Jr, Alex and Nico, from a previous relationship. Read Leah‘s statement in full below… Well, here we are. After 28 years together and 21 years of marriage, we have decided to file for divorce. This decision came after a lot of thought and care, and as hard as divorce is, we are approaching this with a positive outlook because we know it’s what’s best for us. We are proud of how we have worked through this together. Yes, we’re sad, and we’ve got some figuring out to do as we continue to move forward into our new normal—together still in many ways, and apart in some new ones. But here’s the thing: we’ve been best friends for so many years. We are still celebrating holidays together, watching our favorite tv shows together, and gathering as a family. So, the big question—why? To put it simply, we both changed, as people do, and we got used to playing roles that didn’t fit us anymore. After a lot of effort and consideration, we’ve decided to take this step, which reflects who we are today. Our bond is still strong—it’s just evolved into something different. We think a marriage that lasted this long and created so many beautiful memories, especially raising our incredible daughter, is something to celebrate. From our perspective, this marriage was a huge success. And now, we’re looking forward to creating even more cherished moments—just in a different way. We want to be as transparent as we can be here because, for years, we shared our marriage so publicly, whether it was on our specials on VH1 or our reality show, which ran for two seasons on TLC. We are sharing this unknown territory with you all as we take our first steps into this next stage of our lives publicly. We would love for everyone to have more access to different kinds of relationship stories and not feel so isolated in navigating the changes that millions of couples make every year. We hope our journey can inspire others to see that relationships—whether they change or end—aren’t failures. We’ll keep sharing snippets of our lives as we navigate this new chapter.

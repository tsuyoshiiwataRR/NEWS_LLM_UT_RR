    "text": "A Korean Air flight bound for Malpensa Airport (MXP) in Milan was delayed after a live bullet was found under one of the passenger seats right before takeoff.\nFlight KE 927 was being prepared for departure on March 24, 2024 and at around 11:20 local time, one of the aircraft cleaners found the bullet underneath a passenger seat.\nAccording to Incheon Airport Police Corps, the bullet found in the aircraft was a 9-millimeter and used in a hunting gun. The Boeing 787-9 had earlier arrived from Suvarnabhumi International Airport (BKK) in Bangkok, and police are conducting an investigation into how the bullet came to be lodged underneath the seat.\nAirport police conducted a thorough search inside the aircraft but did not find any other objects presenting potential danger and concluded that the bullet was not linked to a terrorism attempt.\nThe flight eventually departed Incheon Airport at 13:44, almost an hour and a half delayed from its original ETD.\nIn March 2023, a similar scenario occurred on another Korean Air flight bound for Manila International Airport (MNL). Two live bullets were found inside the aircraft prior to departure, and 230 passengers were evacuated. Security checks concluded that the bullets identified no immediate risk.",

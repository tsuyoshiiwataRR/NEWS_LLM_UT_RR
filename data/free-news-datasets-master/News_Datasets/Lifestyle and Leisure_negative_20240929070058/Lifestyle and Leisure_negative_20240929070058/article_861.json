    "text": "A woman who paid £4,500 for a gastric balloon ended up in intensive care after it got stuck in her intestines. Alaina Shaw, 33, hoped the procedure would kick-start her weight-loss journey.\nIt involves swallowing a capsule which then inflates in the stomach and reduces appetite before usually passing naturally through the gastrointestinal tract without the need for a removal procedure. But the former accountant said it felt like she was going to die after the balloon ended up stuck inside her after it moved from her stomach to her intestine.\nAlaina, from Uxbridge, West London, who weighs 21 stone, said: “I didn’t lose any weight - I thought I was going to die. I want to warn people about the dangers of getting this done.”\nIn October 2023, Alaina had a consultation at a clinic in north London. She said she went ahead with the surgery as she was desperate to start losing weight.\nAlaina paid £4,500 to have the procedure done in November 2023 and said she was told she could lose up to 20% of her body weight within four months. But, instead of shedding pounds, she found herself in a life-threatening situation.\n\"It was supposed to be a temporary thing - you swallow this pill, they fill it with saline solution, and they check on an X-ray if it’s there,\" she said. But after the operation, Alaina woke up in immediate pain.\n\"I was in a lot of pain – it felt like a foreign body, but I was assured that I would start feeling better,\" she said. However, as the weeks went by, Alaina found that she was losing no weight and her appetite was exactly the same.\nShe decided to contact the practice, but claims they were “palming her off”. \"They didn’t seem like they were trying to help me,\" Alaina said. \"I said it was becoming a joke – I wasn’t losing any weight - I hadn’t even lost a stone.\"\nAlaina demanded an appointment with the clinic, but claims she was told it would be ill-advised to give a “young healthy woman” an X-ray. Alaina said: “I told them I’m not healthy and I’m not that young!”\nAlaina eventually managed to get an appointment, she said, but before she could attend, she woke up in agonising pain. Her brother rushed her to Hillingdon Hospital in Uxbridge, where she says she was “literally wailing in pain”.\nAt the hospital, doctors performed keyhole surgery and found the balloon, instead of dissolving as it was supposed to, had lodged itself in her intestines, she claims. She said she was warned surgeons might have to remove part of Alaina’s bowel to remove the balloon.\nThankfully, in the end they were able to remove it without resorting to such drastic measures, but Alaina still had to be kept in an ICU unit and the operation left her with a five-inch incision on her belly button to get the balloon out.\nAlaina said: \"I lost no weight and ended up in hospital questioning if I was going to survive. I was in ICU for two days - I was scared I was going to die.”\nAfter her stint in ICU she was released from hospital after two weeks, but was left in limbo as she had only just quit her job as an account manager to start her own dog-walking business.\n“It was the worst possible timing as I was unable to work for eight weeks – it really hit me financially,\" she said. Alaina is trying to get full reimbursement from the clinic.\nAlaina said: \"They were going to offer me £1,000 back - I didn’t lose any weight and could have died.\"\nShe claims the manufacturers want the balloon back in order to investigate. “It’s been inside me and they want it back – it’s rank,” Alaina said.\nThe makers of the balloon said: \"We are unable to comment on specific patient cases.\" A spokesperson added \"safety and effectiveness\" of the balloon was \"well-established\" and said: \"We are committed to working with clinics to ensure that any issues are thoroughly investigated and resolved in line with our commitment to patient safety.\"\nThe clinic did not respond to a request for comment. According to the NHS, in general the surgery is a very safe procedure, though, as a relatively new procedure the long-term effects are as yet unknown.\nComplications are rare, but can include leakage or bursting of the balloon, ulcers, a rupture or bleeding in the stomach or windpipe caused by a faulty insertion of the balloon or gastric problems such as reflux, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.",

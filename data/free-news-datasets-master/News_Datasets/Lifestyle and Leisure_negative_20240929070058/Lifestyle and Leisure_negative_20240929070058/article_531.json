Photo: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\nAmy Tennery Today at 10:16\nFormer champion Carlos Alcaraz was dumped out of the US Open in a stunning straight-sets defeat by world number 74 Botic van de Zandschulp last night, while top seeds Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek moved on to the third round with little fuss.\nSpanish third seed Alcaraz was fully expected to extend his 15-match winning streak at the Grand Slams but the Wimbledon and French Open champion got off to a horrible start and never recovered, going down 6-1 7-5 6-4 in the second round.\nVan de Zandschulp, the first Dutchman to defeat a player in the top three at a major since Richard Krajicek beat Pete Sampras in the 1996 Wimbledon quarters, will next play Britain's Jack Draper.\n\"It was a fight against myself, you know, in my mind during the match. In tennis you are playing against someone that wants the same as you,\" said Alcaraz.\n\"Today I was playing against the opponent, and I was playing against myself.\"\nUS Open: Carlos Alcaraz press conference following his defeat to Botic van De Zandschulp\nThere was far less drama earlier in the day at Arthur Ashe Stadium, where Poland's Swiatek swatted aside Japanese qualifier Ena Shibahara 6-0 6-1 in a little over an hour. She plays unseeded Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova next.\nAustralian Open winner Sinner was similarly untroubled in dispatching American Alex Michelsen 6-4 6-0 6-2, taking just 99 minutes to complete his ATP Tour-leading 30th hardcourt win of the year.\nThe Italian, who will play Australian Chris O'Connell next, has been dogged by controversy at Flushing Meadows after it was revealed days before the tournament he escaped a ban and was cleared of wrongdoing despite failing two drug tests this year.\nHe said he tested positive for a banned substance after his physio applied an over-the-counter spray to a cut on his own hand before carrying out treatments in March.\nSinner fired both his physio and trainer last week.\n\"Not easy, obviously, to find now in the middle of the season, you know, the physical trainer and the physio,\" said Sinner. \"We try our best to find the best people, and then we see.\"\nTwice champion Naomi Osaka was sent packing by Czech Karolina Muchova 6-3 7-6(5), another disappointing Grand Slam exit in what she has dubbed her \"learning year\" after coming back from a 15-month maternity break.\n\"I feel like I'm working way harder than I've ever worked in my life, so it needs to turn into something,\" said Osaka. \"Well, it doesn't need to, but I think it will.\"\nMuchova, a semi-finalist last year, will next play Russian Anastasia Potapova.\nFormer champion Daniil Medvedev moved past Hungarian Fabian Marozsan 6-3 6-2 7-6, helped by his opponent's 45 unforced errors, and will next play Italian Flavio Cobolli.\nSixth seed Jessica Pegula and 14th seed Tommy Paul boosted home hopes as both Americans advanced to the third round but compatriot Sebastian Korda crashed out.\nDefending champion Coco Gauff will hope to keep the good times rolling for the home crowd when she opens up the action at Arthur Ashe against Ukrainian Elina Svitolina today.\nBen Shelton and Frances Tiafoe promise fireworks in an all-American third-round clash.\nLatest Tennis US Open: Carlos Alcaraz press conference following his defeat to Botic van De Zandschulp\n‘It was a fight against myself’ – Carlos Alcaraz in shock straight-sets defeat at US Open\nNovak Djokovic makes history at US Open with Coco Gauff safely through\nUS Open press conference with Novak Djokovic\n‘I cannot really control what they think’ – Jannik Sinner gets frosty player reception after anti-doping controversy\nEmma Raducanu going ‘back to the drawing board’ after US Open loss\nLongest US Open match in US Open history at 5 hours 35 minutes won by Dan Evans\n‘Yeah, I feel down, like I feel sad’ – Questions remain over direction of Emma Raducanu’s career after US Open loss\nStefanos Tsitsipas crashes out as Naomi Osaka serves notice in US Open\nAustralian teen may miss out on $140,000 US Open payday due to rules about student athletes\nShow more Top Stories\nParalympics Breaking | ‘I know I can go faster’ - Ireland’s Ellen Keane storms into 100m Breaststroke final after winning heat in Paris\nComment Tanya Sweeney: Celebs like Blake Lively are rude to journalists because they think we’re ‘the help’ — and it happens more than you think\nTelevision Pat Stacey: Return of awful ‘2 Johnnies’ show hard to credit but low-key RTÉ schedule has some gems\nMusic ‘Even if we worked in the local fishmongers, we’d still be slapping each other with the trout.’ The caustic put-downs that propelled the Gallagher brothers' feud Latest News More Irish News Oasis in Dublin: Everything you need to know about tickets, pre-sale access and how to prepare for Ticketmaster 12:57 Celebrity News Oasis release Definitely Maybe anniversary edition as reunion pre-sale begins 12:30 Britain Public fury as Conservative MP uses Holocaust poem to attack smoking ban 12:29 Irish Business Corre secures loan from shareholders 12:28 News Destructive larch beetle detected in Scottish log import into Cork 12:28 Paralympics Breaking | ‘I know I can go faster’ - Ireland’s Ellen Keane storms into 100m Breaststroke final after winning heat in Paris 11:57 Asia-Pacific Indonesia to reform tourism on tropical island Bali: ‘Quality is more important than numbers’ 11:48 Personal Finance Just released Eurozone inflation figures leave ECB on course for rate cuts 11:46 Seachtain An ‘Sos Cogaidh’ 30 bliana ar aghaidh: The impact of the IRA’s ceasefire 11:35 Premier League Manchester United v Liverpool: Arne Slot full press conference 11:31",

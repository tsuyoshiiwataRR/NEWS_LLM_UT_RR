    "text": "[The Golden Bachelor](http://www.screenrant.com/tag/the-golden-bachelor) season 1's Theresa Nist missed all of Gerry Turner's red flags, because she simply didn't want to see the truth. When 70-year-old Theresa made her television debut, she was in desperate need of a love story. The day trader had been on her own since her late husband, William Nist, passed away in 2014, after 42 years of marriage and two children together. Theresa had been on her own since then, until she heard about a Bachelor spin-off that was casting eligible elderly singles, and she jumped at the chance. 72-year-old Gerry was also a widower before joining the [cast of The Golden Bachelor season 1](https://screenrant.com/the-golden-bachelor-cast-guide/), losing his wife, Toni Turner, in 2017, after 43 years of marriage. Gerry and Theresa hit it off immediately, and ended the season by getting married. Though hopes were high for the septuagenarian newlyweds, the Golden marriage lasted only three months. Though the divorce was likely devastating for Theresa, it shouldn't have been a surprise, as there were many red flags along the way. [Related ](/best-reality-tv-dating-shows/) [ 20 Best Reality TV Dating Shows ](/best-reality-tv-dating-shows/) Reality TV dating has become a complex and nuanced part of the genre, welcoming all different types of dating shows. Here are the 20 best! Gerry Misrepresented His Career A Lie Of Omission When [Gerry was announced as ](https://screenrant.com/the-golden-bachelor-casting-gerry-turner-lead-proves-show-doesnt-care-about-contestants/) [The Golden Bachelor](https://screenrant.com/the-golden-bachelor-casting-gerry-turner-lead-proves-show-doesnt-care-about-contestants/), he was identified as a retired restaurateur who once owned a popular Indiana diner. Over time, it became clear that Gerry sold his small diner decades ago and had worked as a maintenance person off-and-on since then. Gerry tried to clarify by explaining that he mostly did the maintenance work on a charity basis, which, considering his love for philanthropy, is possible. Though Gerry didn't lie about being a retired restaurateur, he omitted the rest of the story. Gerry Misrepresented His Love Life He Had A Secret Relationship Gerry's far bigger misrepresentation was about his love life. Gerry claimed that he had been single since his late wife, Toni, passed away in 2017, but that turned out to be untrue. It was eventually revealed that Gerry had been in a serious relationship with a live-in girlfriend between the death of his life and his participation in [The Golden Bachelor season 1](https://screenrant.com/the-golden-bachelor-season-1-how-watch-premieres/). Despite multiple glaring red flags, Theresa married Gerry anyway. Will Theresa Ever Love Again? It Will Be Hard To Trust Another Man Since settling her divorce from Gerry, [Theresa has kept her head down](https://screenrant.com/what-happened-the-golden-bachelor-theresa-nist-after-gerry-turner-split/), focusing on family and her work. She doesn't seem to have waded back into the dating pool, and it's unclear when she'll ever be ready to date again. After all the lies, deceptions, and misrepresentations she endured on The Golden Bachelor season 1, it would be perfectly understandable that Theresa would have a difficult time ever trusting another man. Hopefully, the mother of two and grandmother of six will be able to open her heart once again. Gerry Turner Will Likely Start Dating Again Soon He Recently Said Goodbye To A Close Friend Recently, [Gerry said goodbye to his best friend](https://screenrant.com/the-golden-bachelor-signs-hearbreaker-gerry-turner-ready-date-divorce-again/) and The Golden Bachelor is likely to be feeling lonelier than usual these days. After his wife Toni died in 2017, Gerry adopted a dog, Cody, to fill the unimaginable void left by the passing of his wife. Over the years that followed, Cody proved himself to be one of Gerry's greatest sources of love and comfort. Little Cody was there while Gerry was filming The Golden Bachelor. Cody was also there through Gerry's marriage to Theresa, and remained a loyal companion after the marriage fell apart. Sadly, [Gerry](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-vgsJUyPoi/?hl=en&img_index=1) recently posted about Cody's passing on Instagram, writing, \"Here's to the dog who ushered me thru the toughest years a man could endure.\" \"R.I.P. Cody.\" With Cody gone, The Golden Bachelor season 1 star may start to feel lonelier than ever, and wading back into the dating pool could help him cope with losing his beloved pup. Gerry's post has 6.2K likes so far, and the comment section is flooded with fans sending their love and support.

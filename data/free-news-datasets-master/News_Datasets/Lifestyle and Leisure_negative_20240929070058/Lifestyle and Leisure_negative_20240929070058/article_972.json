    "text": "The world of weight loss can often seem daunting.\nMediterranean diets, intermittent fasting, and carnivorous meals have all made headlines in recent years, yet it can still be challenging to determine which plan will be effective. However, Professor Tim Spector and Dr Sarah Berry suggest we might be overlooking something crucial.\nInterestingly, a common habit could leave you feeling extremely hungry upon waking - and it's possibly something you've never considered. In a recent\n ZOE podcast episode, Dr Berry explained: \"There was a really interesting study that came out last year that I think really nicely illustrates what's going on by eating late in the day.\n\"And in this study they gave people exactly the same food over exactly the same time period, but half of the people had the food slightly earlier in the day and the other half had the same food slightly later in the day.\n\"...Those people who were having it later in the day, despite eating late in the evening, woke up the next morning lots more hungry than the people who were finishing their food a lot earlier in the day.\"\nDr Berry continued to highlight two 'unfavourable' effects of this. The most obvious being that you wake up very hungry - an unpleasant sensation that could potentially prompt you to eat more than you would otherwise.\nEating late at night could be messing with your internal clock and how your body processes food with\nr esearch from 2022 suggesting that dining right before bedtime might boost weight gain and increase diabetes risk.\nAt the time, Dr Joseph Bass, a co-author of the study, said: \"Simply placing an animal in a high fat diet environment will lead to disruption of the clock system. And this has important implications because it suggests that clocks, although they are intrinsic and cause us to awake each day at a certain time, are also sensitive to our dietary environment.\"\nAs a result, Professor Spector recommends steering clear of food for at least 12 hours overnight. On the podcast, he explained: \"There are a number of reasons for this. One is that the body needs time to recover and that it's part of our circadian rhythms, so all the cells in our body have the same 24-hour clock.\n\"They have periods of work and then rest and then repair, so all the cells are repairing during that time. They don't want to be confused with new food being sent down...\"\nAside from this, eating earlier in the day can improve your blood sugar control, hormonal balance and quality of sleep, according to\nHealthshots.\nProfessor Spector continued: \"Our gut is exactly the same. So, our gut microbes completely change composition when we're not eating. They send out like a cleaning team that goes and cleans up our gut lining and that improves our efficiency and everything's clean and ready for the morning.\"\nWhat do you think?

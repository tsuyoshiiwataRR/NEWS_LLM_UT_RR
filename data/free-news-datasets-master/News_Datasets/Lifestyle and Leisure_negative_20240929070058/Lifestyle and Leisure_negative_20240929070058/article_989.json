    "text": "NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - Travelers flying out of Louis Armstrong International Airport (MSY) for Labor Day celebrations and the LSU game this weekend were met with delays due to a malfunctioning baggage belt on Friday.\nSince 5 a.m., passengers across all airlines have been unable to check in their bags as the airport’s baggage belt has stopped working. As a result, travelers are being directed to take their luggage through TSA and check it at the gate, creating additional stress and delays during an already busy travel weekend.\nMore: LSU fans head to Vegas for Labor Day kickoff game\nDespite the inconvenience, LSU fans remained optimistic.\n“I hope there’s nothing wrong with my luggage, but I’m going no matter what. I’ve got my ticket on my phone.

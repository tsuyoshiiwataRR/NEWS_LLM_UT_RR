    "text": "Singer Morrissey claims guitarist Johnny Marr ignored a propped reunion tour for The Smiths. (Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com) (Charlie Miller | cmiller@syracuse.com)\nBy Christopher Burch | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com Morrissey, longtime lead singer for the band The Smiths , recently explained why a proposed 2025 reunion tour won’t happen. And it isn’t because he didn’t want to do one.\nIn a statement posted to the singer’s website Thursday, Morrissey alleges he accepted an offer for the band to tour in 2025 — but guitarist Johnny Marr ignored it.\n“In June 2024 AEG Entertainment Group made a lucrative offer to both Morrissey and Marr to tour worldwide as ‘The Smiths’ throughout 2025,” the statement read. “Morrissey said yes to the offer; Marr ignored the offer.”\nThe Smiths will not be following in the footsteps of fellow British rock band Oasis, which announced a reunion tour earlier this week.\nWhile it appears there won’t be a Smiths reunion, those who love music from Morrissey and Marr will still have chances to see them live.\n“Morrissey undertakes a largely sold out tour of the USA in November,” the statement continued. “Marr continues to tour as a special guest to New Order.”\nThe popular rock band was formed in England back in 1982 by Morrissey, Marr, Andy Rourke and Mike Joyce. The band broke up in 1987. Morrissey, 65, and Marr, 60, have been at odds hardly spoken since the breakup, according to Ultimate Classic Rock .\nMarr — who has rejected the idea of a reunion and taken jabs at Morrissey’s political stance over the years — has yet to comment on the statement.\nThe Smiths are know for hits like “There Is a Light That Never Goes Out,” “Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now,” “Half a Person,” and more.\nMore entertainment coverage: Legendary rock band to release its first project in 16 years Legendary punk band cancels upcoming tour due to ‘an unforeseen family circumstance’ Legendary rock band adds more shows to reunion tour due to ‘unprecedented demand’ Legendary classic rock singer backtracks, will play biggest hits on new tour Netflix star dead at 45 just hours after bidding farewell to fans in video Our journalism needs your support.

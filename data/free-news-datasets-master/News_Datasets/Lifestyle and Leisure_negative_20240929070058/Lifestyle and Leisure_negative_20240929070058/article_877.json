    "text": "[MORE](/the-stand/authors/monica-cole/) Gillette INTIMATE needs to be held accountable for the disgusting commercial that repeatedly hints about and focuses on shaving men’s genitalia. This specific commercial, “Respect Your Junk,” with its tagline, “Respect Your Pubic Region,” is currently airing on television and appears to be gaining even more air time recently (in correlation to the sudden increase of complaints 1MM has received regarding this advertisement). The ad begins with a man standing in front of his bathroom mirror wearing a towel around his waist, as he peaks down inside to evaluate the need for grooming. During this commercial, the man is shown in his shower no longer wearing his towel or shaving below his belly button, while his hand continues down towards his groin. But the camera shot cuts off to the right before his pubic region is visible to the audience. The script states: “Guys, it’s time to stop treating your groins like junk! Introducing the new ‘INTIMATE’ pubic hair trimmer from Gillette. It’s not junk, so treat it right with a gentle and easy shave from America’s #1 trusted men’s grooming brand. Respect your pubic region with Gillette INTIMATE.” At the end of the advertisement, the man begins to dress and zips up his pants since he is finished grooming down there. This commercial is entirely too specific and graphic for television. The details are over the top. Yet, Gillette still chose to air this commercial despite its obviously controversial nature. It has been brought to our attention that the ad has aired on a children’s network as well. Can you imagine what goes through a child’s mind when viewing this ad? 1MM has received many complaints from parents. Gillette should be ashamed! Gillette needs to know that conservative parents disapprove of its advertising tactics. The company may push away customers if it continues advertising in a repulsive manner that offends parents. [Please sign our petition](https://onemillionmoms.com/current-campaigns/gillette-intimate-ad-is-extremely-inappropriate/) urging Gillette INTIMATE to cancel this inappropriate commercial immediately!",

    "text": "Koumala Hotel's resident cat banned from public bar, pool room by Mackay council In short: The local council has told owners of the Koumala Hotel their resident cat can no longer be in the pool room or public bar. The senior Siamese named Precious spends most of her days sleeping on a couch. What's next? The publicans have to rehome Precious or find a way to work with council to exclude her from areas where food and drinks are served. She could well be 18 and old enough to be in the bar, but this lady is not welcome at her North Queensland local. Precious the Siamese cat has called the Koumala Hotel home for the past 14 years. But Mackay Regional Council says on a recent visit she was seen in the restaurant, a breach of food safety legislation. The Food Standards Code bans animals from bars and dining areas where food or drinks are served. Dogs, however, may be in outdoor dining areas. Pub owner Rowena Colgrave said the council initially gave her 14 days to find a new home for the cat. A petition for Precious to stay has gathered more than 2,000 signatures with offers of a new home coming from as far away as Sydney and Melbourne. Precious came with the pub when Ms Colgrave bought it eight years ago. \"Everyone has their own opinion on how long she's been here. She was an adult cat when she turned up, so she could have been 4 to 6 years old, so she could be anywhere up to 18 to 20 years old now,\" she said. Ms Colgrave said she misunderstood advice from council last year. \"I thought Precious was allowed to stay, as long as she was fed outside, but apparently she's not allowed in any place where people could be eating, and sometimes people eat in the pool room.\" She said it would be impossible to keep her upstairs or outside. Ms Colgrave said when she was younger she used to enjoy seeing Precious on the bar stool. \"Everyone would let her have that bar stool, and everyone would give her a pat as they walked past her, and she would be up there for hours. \"Since she's gotten older, she can't jump up onto a bar stool, so she's out in the pool room now.\" \"The law's the law, I suppose, but I just think it shouldn't be so black and white.\" \"A positive solution\" Council says it will work with the owners to find a fix. Community services director Janine McKay said the pub owners were told about the legislation a year ago. \"The issue was first flagged with the pub licensee more than a year ago, but the cat was seen again during a routine inspection of the premises this week,\" Ms McKay said. Councillor Marty Bella supports Precious being removed. \"The scales of justice shouldn't be blind. It's not a matter of which pub or which restaurant or how old the cat is. \"It's a matter of our food safety regulations and they are there for exactly that reason â€” for the safety of the wider public.\" Patron Dennis Cash said the old cat just sat around. \"If she gets a bit hot she goes outside. She's been here for 14 years,\" he said. \"She's too old to get up on the bar stool now. All she wants to do is live the rest of her life out, poor old cat.\" Tahra Carniato has worked at the Koumala Hotel for the last four years. She says she was confused at first when she heard Precious might have to be kept outside. \"As far as I know, the lady who was here before me was here for fourteen years, so to add that to [the time] Precious was already here for it just doesn't make sense why she isn't allowed to be in her home now,\" Ms Carniato said. \"She is getting old and you can see her starting to decline. \"You start thinking one day she might pass away, which is really sad. But to be taken away from the pub now, at the end of her life, I think that's the saddest part. \"I couldn't imagine not being with her until the end of her life, if you know what I mean. That makes me a bit sad.\"",

    "text": "Auto review: 2024 VW Taos is blah at best Published in [Business News](/business/businessnews/) As the Volkswagen Group has a large fleet of vehicles across its array of brands, the need for another SUV in the fleet is shocking, but in 2024 the VW Taos arrived in Grasso’s Garage for a slice of the review pie. In hopes of competing with the Hyundai Kona and Kia Niro, Volkswagen delivers the Taos, a basic and plain subcompact SUV fit for five passengers with entry level options and features. It's powered by a 1.5-liter 16-valve DOHC turbo four-cylinder engine offering 158 horsepower. 4MOTION all-wheel drive was standard on our Cornflower Blue tester. The interior of the Taos was typical VW. There is a push-button start in the center console, nicely sized 10.25-inch driver instrument cluster, 19-inch black painted wheels, decently comfortable seats and good sight lines. Notably, the IQ DRIVE, VW’s answer to Advance Driver Assistant Technologies, was nice and easy to use. Two-year/20,000-mile scheduled carefree maintenance was included, in addition to a four-year/50,000-mile warranty. When VW enters Grasso’s Garage, we enjoy seeing what is new and exciting in the fleet. Although the Taos offers that new and exciting vibe, it seems overpriced for a basic commuter. There is no power tailgate, no memory seats and a lot of basics with no frills and thrills, which is common amongst entry level commuters. But for the $35K price tag, those should be standard options, especially in the top SEL line that we tested. I recognize the VW Tiguan and its endless success, but I'm confused as to the overall need for the Taos in the fleet. On the other hand, it's spunky, fun and roomy, and the Taos certainly looks good and has the vibe consumers enjoy, so maybe its success is here to stay, but only time will tell. 2024 Volkswagen Taos SEL 4MOTION MSRP: $33,515 MPG: 24 city / 32 highway / 26.7 as tested As Tested: $35,260 ©2024 the Boston Herald.

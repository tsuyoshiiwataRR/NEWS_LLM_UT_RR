    "text": "Japanese TikToker lives & cooks in bug-infested apartment, evicted after not paying rent for 21 months\nHoarding is one thing.\nBut a Japanese woman, who goes by the handle @shirokumatyandaisuki1999 on TikTok, took that concept to a different level through her cooking videos on the social media app.\nWhile showcasing how she makes her meals, viewers are also shown how incredibly, incredibly dirty her apartment is.\nShe was seen cooking her meal with an electric pot and recklessly placing it on top of a pile of her belongings.\nWhat was shocking though were the many insects crawling on the wall behind. In fact, this writer let out a loud squeal when he saw how many bugs there were.\nCan someone enlighten us on how she not only cooks but lives in that unsanitary place?\nThe video has since been viewed more than 16mil times.\nHowever, it seems there is at least one clean item in her possession – a teddy bear plushie wrapped in plastic.\nAccording to the woman, it is kept as such as she didn’t want the insects to eat at it.\nMaybe cleaning your living space will solve that problem?\nShe also took to X, formerly known as Twitter, that she was behind her rent for a year and nine months before the landlord evicted her from the apartment.\nThe woman even posted a picture of a masked officer arriving to remove her from the building.\nWe think the landlord is a saint for allowing her to continue living in such squalor for as long as she did.\nSince her eviction, the woman has also taken to videoing herself brushing her teeth — for the first time in three days, she wrote — along the streets.\nShe is now staying at a hotel though we wonder how long that will last.\nNetizens took to the comments with disgust, with many writing about how grossed out they were.\nWhile some asked how she could live so unhygienically, others asked if the woman adds the bugs on the wall to her cooking.\nOne netizen even suggested she collaborate or bunk in with Indonesian vlogger, Haritsu, who is infamous for cooking and eating rotting food.\nSeriously?\nhttps://www.todayonline.com/8days/j...icted-after-not-paying-rent-21-months-2480471",

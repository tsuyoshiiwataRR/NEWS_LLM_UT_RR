    "text": "entertainment / Celebrities and Showbiz Celebrities and Showbiz Matet de Leon reacts to ‘laos’ remark: ‘Paano malalaos di naman sikat?’ By: Jessica Ann Evangelista INQUIRER.net / 01:09 PM August 30, 2024 Matet de Leon | Image: Instagram/@misismatet\nMatet de Leon clapped back at a netizen who called her “laos” (a has-been), saying someone can’t be “laos” if they were not popular in the first place.\nDe Leon’s statement came after she was dragged into the issue of Kyline Alcantara and Carmina Villarroel by a netizen who edited a “malicious” video of them three.\nArticle continues after this advertisement “Nasasabihan pa akong laos nito. Paano malalaos ‘di naman sikat? Hindi nalalaos ang hindi sikat,” said De Leon. (I was told I’m a has-been. But how can anyone be a has-been if they were not famous? No one who was never famous can be a has-been.)\nFEATURED STORIES ENTERTAINMENT Rita Avila recalls being sexually harassed by director: ‘Kadiri, nakakatakot’ ENTERTAINMENT ‘Wil to Win’ host MJ Cayabyab reveals he resigned from the show ENTERTAINMENT Willie Revillame revokes player’s chance to win cash prize Asking to be left alone, the former child star said, “Hindi ‘yun para sa iniisip niyo na tao. Huwag niyo akong idamay kasi wala akong kinalaman jan. Kung ano anong sinasabi niyo tungkol sakin nanahimik ako.”\n(What you say to me is not for the person you’re thinking of. Don’t drag me into the issue because I have nothing to do with it. You guys are saying things about me when I’m just here minding my own business.)\nArticle continues after this advertisement “Huwag niyo akong pagtripan kasi kapag ako nang-trip, hindi rin maganda,” added the actress. (Don’t play with me because you wouldn’t like it when I hit back.)\nArticle continues after this advertisement De Leon rose to fame as a child star in the 1980s. Her first film was “I Love You, Ma, I Love You, Pa” in 1986. But her acting skills were noticed in the movie “Bunsong Kerubin,” which earned her a FAMAS Best Child Actress nomination in 1988.\nArticle continues after this advertisement Despite being one of the adopted children of former celebrity couple Christoper de Leon and Superstar Nora Aunor, Matet caved a name for herself in show biz.\nDuring her active years, Matet got the opportunity to act alongside the late Fernando Poe Jr. in the film “One Day Isang Araw” in 1988. She also starred in the 1997 movie “Mama Dito sa Aking Puso” with her mom Nora.\nArticle continues after this advertisement Matet is now focused on being a wife to John Michael “Mickey” Estrada and mother to her three children.

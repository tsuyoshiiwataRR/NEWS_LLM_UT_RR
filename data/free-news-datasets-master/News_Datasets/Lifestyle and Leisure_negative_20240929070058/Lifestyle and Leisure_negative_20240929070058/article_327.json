    "text": "Aug 30, 2024, 10:59 AM IST Refrigeration can extend the shelf life of many foods, but some items should never be refrigerated because cold temperatures can negatively affect their texture, flavour, or ripening process. Refrigeration can make tomatoes meaty and reduce their flavour. They are best stored at room temperature. Cold temperatures can turn the starch in potatoes into sugar, altering their flavour and texture. Store them in a cool, dark place instead. Refrigeration can make onions soft and mouldy. They should be kept in a cool, dry place with good air circulation. Like onions, garlic can become mouldy or sprout in the refrigerator. Store it in a dry, ventilated area. Refrigeration can dry out bread quickly, leading to a stale texture. Store it at room temperature or freeze it if you need to keep it longer. Cold temperatures cause honey to crystallize and become grainy. Itâ€™s best stored in a tightly sealed container at room temperature. Refrigeration can cause bananas to turn brown and lose flavour. They are best kept at room temperature.",

    "text": "People have been looking forward to Black Ops 6 ‘s Zombies mode ever since it was announced. Warzone Zombies didn’t nearly live up to the expectations that people had hoped for, and this was a chance for the franchise to redeem itself.\nUnfortunately, judging from the public’s reactions to new gameplay clips, Treyarch may have completely dropped the ball on this one. People are completely writing the mode off, claiming it’s a far cry from what a ‘good’ Zombies mode should look like.\nBlack Ops 6 Zombies Disappoints in New Clip ⛶ ⛶ ⛶ ⛶ ⛶ × What was previously a lot of hype and excitement for Black Ops 6 ‘s release has been completely replaced by overwhelming amounts of anger and frustration.\nIn a recent clip shared by @charlieINTEL on X/Twitter, players got a sneak peek at the Liberty Falls map, and the reactions have been less than enthusiastic, to say the least.\nThis is NOT the zombies I wanted…. Full loadout on start. No Thanks. Still in a Warzone style.. BIG NO THANKS. Wtf is this @Activision https://t.co/ntXQOf7ExV\n— Gloveaction (@Gloveaction) August 28, 2024 The clip shows a player loading into Liberty Falls with a full loadout, including an assault rifle.\nRELATED COD Next 2024: Here Are All of the Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Zombies Details Revealed From the Event As soon as the player spawns, they mow down zombies with ease, mixing in some quick melee kills for good measure. It’s very different from the tense, survival-focused experience many fans were hoping for.\nThis is NOT the zombies I wanted…. Full loadout on start. No Thanks. Still in a Warzone style.. BIG NO THANKS. Wtf is this @Activision https://t.co/ntXQOf7ExV\n— Gloveaction (@Gloveaction) August 28, 2024 In the replies, it’s clear that this is not what players wanted. Instead of taking after highly liked iterations, such as from the previous Black Ops titles, it seems to adapt from Warzone .\nThe reactions aren’t completely surprising—people were skeptical when it was revealed that Zombies would be moving ahead with Operators instead of crews like in previous games, was already Strike One for many.\nFans Feel Frustrated and Unheard After New Clip Emerges Black Ops 6 Zombies fails to keep fans excited even before its release. | Credit: Activision One of the biggest complaints is the ability to spawn in with a full loadout. In previous iterations of Zombies , players typically started with just a pistol and had to gradually work their way up to more powerful weapons as they progressed through the waves.\nHow hard is it for them to give us a starting pistol and wall buys / mystery box\n— Colbey Gross (@ColbeyGross) August 28, 2024 The progression not only made grinding worthwhile but upped the stakes for each match.\nRELATED “This gonna get so disrespectful”: COD Black Ops 6 Will Allow You To Take Other Players Hostage As Human Shields and Taunt Them Through Voice Chat Some players argue that you could simply choose to start with a pistol, but others feel that it isn’t the same.\nthis looks so bad, why are they doing these lay outs. where’s the scary aspects? the horror aspects? wtf is this garbage\n— Javier Aliaga (@javieraliaga_) August 28, 2024 The atmosphere hasn’t meshed well with fans either. There aren’t many zombies from what the clips show and the environment and sound design don’t do much to push the ‘horror’ part of Zombies .\nThe list of complaints stretches long. The COD Next showcase might’ve gotten fans excited for the game, the reality is a far cry from expectations.\nDo you think the situation is overblown, or do you agree that Black Ops 6 Zombies looks disappointing? We’d love to hear your thoughts on it in the comments below!",

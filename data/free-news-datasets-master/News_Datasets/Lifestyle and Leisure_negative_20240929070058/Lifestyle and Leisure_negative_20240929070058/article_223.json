    "text": "WooSox' Bats Held Dormant in 4-2 Loss to Toledo\nAugust 29, 2024 -\nInternational League (IL) Worcester Red Sox News Release\nWORCESTER, MA -- Jason Alexander was solid over five innings, but the Worcester Red Sox (30-23)/(65-63) dropped the third game of their six-game set to the Toledo Mud Hens (25-29)/(60-68) by a final score of 4-2. With Columbus' 5-2 win over Gwinnett, the WooSox fell to six games back with 22 games to play.\nThursday night was a classic pitcher's duel between the WooSox and Mud Hens.\nJason Alexander got the start for Worcester and was excellent in five innings of work. The right-hander retired the side in order twice and finished with a line of 5 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 1 BB, 6 K--with the lone mistake coming in the second inning. Ahead in the count 0-2, Alexander left a slider up in the zone and Eddys Leonard deposited it onto the berm in left to give the Mud Hens a 1-0 lead.\nToledo's starting pitcher, Lael Lockhart, was equally impressive, hurling five shutout innings for the Mud Hens. With Worcester averaging 6.1 runs per game in their last 18 contests, Lockhart held the WooSox' high-powered offense to just two hits over the course of his outing.\nOver the same 18-game span, Worcester's bullpen has been equally as dominant as the offense, pitching to a 2.72 ERA with 10.1 K/9 in their last 76.1 innings. The first two relievers-- Cam Booser and Bailey Horn--continued the WooSox' 'pen's stretch of excellence on Thursday night, preventing Toledo from adding on in the sixth and seventh innings.\nBooser was first out of the bullpen for the WooSox and allowed one hit while striking out the side. The southpaw began a rehab assignment with Worcester on Thursday after being placed on the 15-Day Injured List by the Red Sox on August 14 with left elbow inflammation. Horn followed with two strikeouts of his own in a perfect seventh inning.\nIn the WooSox half of the seventh, the offense finally woke up.\nWith one out, Worcester loaded the bases for Enmanuel Valdez, who worked a walk to tie up the game at one. Vaughn Grissom followed by lining a 2-1 fastball to left for a sacrifice fly to give the WooSox a 2-1 lead.\nTo begin the eighth inning, Worcester went to their third lefty of the night in Zach Penrod who walked two of the first three batters he faced. After a groundout put men on second and third with two outs, Penrod was relieved by Yohan Ramirez who looked to get the WooSox out of the inning. But the right-hander left a sweeper up in the zone that Andrew Navigato pulled onto the berm for a three-run go-ahead home run to put Toledo ahead, 4-2.\nWith six outs remaining, the WooSox offense went down quietly, striking out four times while only managing one baserunner. It was only their fourth loss in their last 19 games, but a crucial defeat as Worcester continues to chase the Columbus Clippers for the International League second half title.\nZach Penrod (L, 3-2) was handed his second loss of the year while Devin Sweet (W, 8-6) earned the victory for Toledo.\nThe WooSox and Mud Hens will continue their six-game series at 6:45 p.m. on Friday night at Polar Park. Hunter Dobbins will make his Triple-A debut after he was promoted to Worcester on August 22. Toledo will send Bryan Sammons (6-5, 4.18) opposite Dobbins.The game will be broadcasted live on NESN+ and radio coverage begins at 6:25 p.m. on 98.9 Nash Icon and the WooSox Radio Network.\nBOX SCORE - TOL 4, WOR 2\nWorcester Red Sox Statistics\nâ€¢ Discuss this story on the\nInternational League message board...\nInternational League Stories from August 29, 2024\nRain Rests Redbirds' Rout of Rivals- Memphis Redbirds Knights Drop Thursday's Game to Sounds, 5-1- Charlotte Knights WooSox' Bats Held Dormant in 4-2 Loss to Toledo- Worcester Red Sox White, Collins Help Sounds Conquer Knights- Nashville Sounds Syracuse Pummels Lehigh Valley, 13-6, on Thursday Night- Syracuse Mets Kody Clemens Goes Deep as IronPigs Drop Second Straight to Mets- Lehigh Valley IronPigs Hens Rally Late to Claim 4-2 Victory Over Red Sox at Polar Park- Toledo Mud Hens Seymour Leads Durham to Fourth Straight- Durham Bulls Red Wings, RailRiders Postponed Thursday Night- Rochester Red Wings RailRiders and Red Wings Game Postponed- Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders August 29th Omaha Storm Chasers Game Postponed- Omaha Storm Chasers Saints and Storm Chasers Rained Out, Doubleheader Friday- St. Paul Saints August 29 Game Notes: Iowa Cubs vs. Memphis Redbirds- Iowa Cubs Trivino Scheduled to Rehab with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre- Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders Nastrini Promoted to White Sox on Thursday- Charlotte Knights SWB Game Notes - August 29- Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders Rochester Red Wings Game Notes - August 29 at Scranton/WB- Rochester Red Wings Kornberg to Broadcast Seven Additional Marlins Regular Season Games- Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp Sounds Host Braves, Cardinals Affiliates in Final Homestand of Season- Nashville Sounds Storm Chasers Drop Second Straight to St. Paul- Omaha Storm Chasers Late Offensive Charge Fizzles Out in 7-6 Loss to Columbus- Gwinnett Stripers\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.\nOther Recent Worcester Red Sox Stories\nWooSox' Bats Held Dormant in 4-2 Loss to Toledo Grissom Drives in Three as WooSox Win 5-4 Over Toledo With 24 Games Remaining, WooSox Are Making a Late Push for the Postseason WooSox Score a Dozen, Win 12-2 Over Toledo in Series Opener WooSox Dismantle Tides in Series Finale, Win 13-0",

    "text": "By Stephanie Webber ,\n1 hour ago\nLeah Remini and Angelo Pagán have split after 21 years of marriage.\nThe estranged couple announced their divorce news in a joint statement via Instagram on Thursday.\n“Well, here we are. After 28 years together and 21 years of marriage, we have decided to file for divorce. This decision came after a lot of thought and care, and as hard as divorce is, we are approaching this with a positive outlook because we know it’s what’s best for us. We are proud of how we have worked through this together,” the statement began.\n“Yes, we’re sad, and we’ve got some figuring out to do as we continue to move forward into our new normal—together still in many ways, and apart in some new ones. But here’s the thing: we’ve been best friends for so many years. We are still celebrating holidays together, watching our favorite tv shows together, and gathering as a family.”\nLeah Remini and Angelo Pagán announced their divorce on August 29, 2024. Leah Remini/Instagram The pair then went into detail about their decision.\n‘Perimenopausal’ Leah Remini is ‘screaming’ over Beyonce wax figure comparison\n“So, the big question—why? To put it simply, we both changed, as people do, and we got used to playing roles that didn’t fit us anymore,” the explained.\n“After a lot of effort and consideration, we’ve decided to take this step, which reflects who we are today. Our bond is still strong—it’s just evolved into something different. We think a marriage that lasted this long and created so many beautiful memories, especially raising our incredible daughter, is something to celebrate,” they continued. “From our perspective, this marriage was a huge success. And now, we’re looking forward to creating even more cherished moments—just in a different way.”\nLeah Remini, Angelo Pagán and their daughter Sofia.

Leah Remini/Instagram “We want to be as transparent as we can be here because, for years, we shared our marriage so publicly, whether it was on our specials on VH1 or our reality show, which ran for two seasons on TLC,” the statement went on Thursday.\n“We are sharing this unknown territory with you all as we take our first steps into this next stage of our lives publicly. We would love for everyone to have more access to different kinds of relationship stories and not feel so isolated in navigating the changes that millions of couples make every year,” they concluded.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MORNING REPORT NEWSLETTER\n“We hope our journey can inspire others to see that relationships—whether they change or end—aren’t failures.

Getty Images for HollyRod Foundation Remini’s news comes just more than a week after Jennifer Lopez filed for divorce from Ben Affleck after two years of marriage. In May, Page Six reported that the ex best friends reconnected after having a falling out in 2022 over Affleck.\nRemini warned Lopez to remember the reason she originally broke up with the “Gone Girl” star when they first dated in 2002: “Because he is selfish and is not fully committed as a partner,” a source said at the time.\nRemini did not attend Lopez and Affleck’s second wedding ceremony in Georgia.\nFor the latest in entertainment, top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com/entertainment/\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

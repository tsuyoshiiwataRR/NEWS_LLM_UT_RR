    "text": "By Zach Braziller ,\n1 hour ago\nNaomi Osaka’s return to the U.S. Open didn’t last long.\nTwo days after a stirring, straight-set upset over 10th-ranked Jelena Ostapenko , Osaka looked capable of hanging around awhile in Flushing.\nInstead, she bowed out on Thursday night in disappointing fashion, and Osaka only had herself to blame.\nThis wasn’t a case of necessarily losing to a superior player.\nNaomi Osaka serves up another bow-inspired outfit at US Open\nOsaka beat herself after playing mostly mistake-free tennis in the brilliant opening-round performance.\nNaomi Osaka fell in her second-round match at the U.S. Open. Jason Szenes for New York Post Osaka committed 21 unforced errors in a 6-3, 7-6 (5) loss to unseeded Czech Karolina Muchova under the lights at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\nJessica Pegula echoes frustrations over internet trolls: ‘Totally normal for us’\nKarolina Muchova is moving on to the third round at the U.S. Open. Jason Szenes for New York Post In her first U.S. Open since 2022 — Osaka took time off to give birth to a baby girl — she was too mistake-prone.\nOf her 21 errors, 17 came in the second set, and she added four double faults.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR STARTING LINEUP NEWSLETTER\nThe game that turned the match came right after her one and only break of Muchova, which gave her a 5-4 lead in the second set.\nKarolina Muchova celebrates her win over Naomi Osaka. Jason Szenes for New York Post Naomi Osaka and Karolina Muchova shake hands after their second-round U.S. Open match. Jason Szenes for New York Post But a series of miscues enabled Muchova — a semifinalist at the U.S. Open last summer who has seen her ranking plummet to 52nd in the world — to break back.\nAnd in the tiebreak, it was against Osaka being unable to complete points.\nShe had a key double fault when up 4-2 in the tiebreaker and facing match point, Osaka was unable to convert a forehand swinging volley at the net.\nFor the latest in sports, top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com/sports/\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

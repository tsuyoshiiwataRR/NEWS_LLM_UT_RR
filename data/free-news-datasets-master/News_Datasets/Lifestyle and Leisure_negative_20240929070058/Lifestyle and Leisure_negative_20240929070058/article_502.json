    "text": "(Reuters) - The opening day's action in Pakistan's second test against Bangladesh was washed out on Friday following incessant rain and a wet outfield at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. The toss could not take place and the umpires inspected conditions around noon before calling off the day's play. Smarting from a 10-wicket loss in the series opener at the same venue, Pakistan are keen to level the two-test series but the inclement weather kept the teams off the field with more rain forecast for later in the day. After their all-pace ploy backfired in the opening test, Pakistan included leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed in their playing XI and dropped speedster Shaheen Afridi.

    "text": "I remember it slightly differently. As a journalist on pub trade title The Morning Advertiser in the 2000s, the anxiety felt by many pub and bar operators was a constant ahead of the bans in England and Wales in 2007.\nNot unlike now, the pub industry faced multiple challenges in the mid-2000s.\nRising costs – of raw ingredients, utilities, and surging alcohol tax – were eroding profits. New licensing laws added regulatory burdens, while deep discounting of alcohol by supermarkets encouraged at-home drinking (60p for a can of Stella, anyone?)\nMeanwhile, major tenanted pub companies had big debt piles to service. And on high streets, rents had become overheated after a huge expansion of bars and nightclubs in the 1990s. All this was before the recession and consumer spending squeeze brought by the banking crisis.\nIt felt at the time like smoking ban proponents were (no pun intended) gaslighting the industry.\nTypically, the ban’s impact would be undermined by highlighting opportunities to grow trade elsewhere – particularly by adding a food offer, which would encourage a more diverse customer base (read: more women and families, fewer boozing blokes).\nThese trends were indeed in play in the early 2000s, and it was clearly the direction of travel for many pubs and bars.\nBut that was little comfort to those outlets, especially community locals with little or no outside area, that were neither able to invest in a food offer nor to lose many loyal customers literally overnight. To not acknowledge this felt disingenuous at best, deceptive at worst.\nSome of the language was grating, too. I remember one government official correcting my use of the term ‘smoking ban’. No no, it’s the ‘smoke-free legislation’. Well that’s OK, then.\nIn the long term, most pubs adapted and survived. The health benefits of the ban are inarguable too. The majority of the pub industry would agree that life is better post-ban.\nBut let’s not pretend there weren’t victims. Many pubs did close and many livelihoods were ruined.\nResponding to news this week that the government is considering an outdoor smoking ban, UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls issued a strong warning, saying such a move “comes with the prospect of serious economic harm to hospitality venues”.\n“You only have to look back to the significant pub closures we saw after the indoor smoking ban to see the potential impact it could have. This ban would not only affect pubs and nightclubs, but hotels, cafés and restaurants that have all invested significantly in good faith in outdoor spaces and continue to face financial challenges.\n“The government must embark on a full and detailed conversation with affected parties on the impact of such a ban before any legislation is laid. It must also assess whether such a ban would achieve its aims of meaningfully reducing smoking or simply relocate smoking elsewhere, such as in the home.”\nNicholls is right. Communicators making a case for a ban must be honest: spell out the health benefits, but acknowledge that businesses will be hit and lives affected.\nThink also if there is a way to sweeten the pill. The ULEZ scrappage scheme, offering grants to scrap or retrofit vehicles that didn’t meet requirements of the London clean air zones, is a good example.\nAnd clear up uncertainties as soon as possible. Uncertainly was rife in the months and years prior to the indoor ban, with ambiguity over issues such as what type of smoking shelters would be allowed and whether non-food pubs or members clubs would be exempt. These hindered investments and created significant unease.\nOverall, healthcare communicators must think beyond purely healthcare arguments, and put themselves in the shoes of others, if they want an extended smoking ban to be successful for all.\nJohn Harrington is editor of PRWeek UK and former news editor of The Morning Advertiser",

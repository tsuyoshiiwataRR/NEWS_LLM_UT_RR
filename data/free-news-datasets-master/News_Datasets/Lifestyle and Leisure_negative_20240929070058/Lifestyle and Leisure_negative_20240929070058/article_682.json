Molly-Mae, 25, said their break-up was not \"a publicity stunt\" and she would not \"spill the tea\", but vowed to keep \"moving foward\".\nThe star also shared a glimpse into how she coped in the days after she dumped the shamed boxer, who was accused of cheating on her.\nShe said: \"I’ve managed to book myself a spa day, I’m so excited.\n\"I feel like this is so unbelievably needed.\n\"I couldn’t think of anything worse than just sitting at home all day, especially as that’s what I’ve done for so many days now.\n\"I’ve just been sort of house bound, bed bound, Zoe’s been coming around to help me alot with Bambi and also Tommy’s been having Bambi as well.\"\nMolly-Mae revealed their daughter 20-month-old daughter Bambi can \"sense\" something is wrong.\nReflecting on their routine now, she said: \"I’m a little bit run down, got a bit of a cold, bit of a cough, standard.\nMost read in Celebrity\n\"I actually have a child free day today and I don’t really know how to act because me and that baby have been joined at the hip.\n\"We actually had a lovely couple of weeks together.\n\"I feel so incredibly close to her at the minute. She’s quite frankly obsessed with me, it’s scary.\"\nShe went on: \"I can’t go to the toilet or leave the room or do anything without her crying her eyes out which is not really ideal.\n\"I think she is having a little bit of attachment issues at the minute.\n\"She can definitely sense that there are changes and things are strange at the minute.\n\"I can really feel that she can sense that, which is very interesting considering she’s just a baby - she’s not even two yet.\"\nIn the 36 minute video, posted to her YouTube channel, the star said she won't go into the details of why she broke up with Tommy.\nShe said: \"It’s not something I want to go into.\n\"He is Bambi’s dad and I will always value him, and respect him and always have a lot of love for him.\"\nOn fan expectations, she continued: \"This is real life, it is not drama, it is not tea, it is not a publicity stunt - as much as I wish it was.\n\"This is real life and it’s very sad and it’s very deep and it just doesn’t feel right for me to come on here and talk about it.\"\nThe Sun revealed Molly-Mae was sent an upsetting video of Tommy on holiday in North Macedonia where he was accused of cheating on her with a Danish girl.\nSources said Molly-Mae was also bracing herself for more women to come foward.\nShe\nconfronted him over a holiday to Las Vegas in 2022 over similar fears.\nMolly-Mae insisted the attention around the split - which made the ITV News - has been overwhelming.\nShe added: \"I think it’s important to deal with it privately, also out of respect to Tommy as well because it’s just not nice.\nRead More on The US Sun\n\"I feel like everything over the last couple of weeks has really been a lot. It’s been blown way out of proportion. It’s all got a bit carried away with itself. The last thing I want to do is fuel that fire.\n\"The best way to deal with this is to move forward, look to the future.\"\nTimeline of Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury's split\nAfter five years together, Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury split up in August 2024.\nAt around 4pm on Wednesday, August 14, Molly-Mae and Tommy suffer an explosive showdown and\nMolly-Mae announces her split from fiancé Tommy Fury, saying ' I never imagined our story would end, especially not this way'.\nAn hour later Tommy shares a\nseparate and brief statement confirming they have parted ways, and thanks Molly-Mae for making him 'a dad'.\nThe real reason they split emerges and on Thursday, August 15 The Sun reveals how Molly-Mae learned Tommy had cheated on her - leading to an explosive showdown.\nOn Saturday, August 17, The Sun reveals how Molly-Mae had been sent an upsetting video showing Tommy kissing a girl in a nightclub in North Macedonia on a lads holiday.\nExactly one week after the split a Danish woman accused of getting close to Tommy speaks to The Sun.

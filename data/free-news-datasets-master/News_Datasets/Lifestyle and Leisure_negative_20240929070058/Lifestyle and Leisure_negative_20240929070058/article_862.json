    "text": "Capri Sun is a drink loved by millions around the world, with it consumed in bucketloads during our childhoods. The beloved pouches of juice with a paper straw - which was once plastic if you're old enough to remember them like me - are a [packed lunch staple](https://www.ladbible.com/food-and-drink) alongside the likes of the iconic Dairylea Lunchables. Well, things are changing in the world of Capri Sun and some are absolutely not having it. Advert According to one major player in the world of snacks, Capri Sun is set to announce a major change to its product. Over [on Instagram](https://www.ladbible.com/instagram), food and snack blog Snackolator announced a major change when it comes to the packaging. It posted to its 415,000 followers: \"Capri Sun is coming for the adults with new bottles that will be arriving in stores soon. Advert \"These were announced for the upcoming NACS [National Association of Convenience Stores] show and will be in three flavours (at least) to start: Fruit Punch, Strawberry Kiwi, and Pacific Cooler. \"Each bottle is 12oz and won't need you to have to find the spot to poke the straw in and hope that it doesn't come shooting back at you. Are you excited for these?\" Reports suggest Capri Sun will start moving towards bottles over pouches, but nothing official has been said by Capri Sun. Advert It has to be said that it wouldn't be a brand new move for the company, with it using bottles for some products already. LADbible contacted Capri Sun on multiple occasions for comment but has not yet received a reply. Fans were not convinced over the [marketing](https://www.ladbible.com/business) change. \"Simple won't hit the same without the straw,\" one said on Instagram. Advert Another wrote: \"The f**k happened to respecting the pouch?\" And a third added: \"I prefer the pouch, maybe it's the nostalgia.\" A fourth posted 'this doesn't sit will with my spirit' and a fifth said: \"My childhood is ruined.\" It wasn't all negative though, with some embracing the product whatever format the juice is presented in. Advert One fan said: \"You're all tripping, I'm buying cases of this.\" A second concurred: \"Finally! I've been drinking the pouch like I'm still six years old.\" And a third said: \"All my dreams are coming true.\" It isn't the first time Capri Sun has tried to move away from its iconic packaging. In the early 2000s, the company started selling its drinks in metal bottles. Yes, metal. Topics: [UK News](/uk-news), [Food And Drink](/food-and-drink), [Viral](/viral)",

    "text": "It's Subaru's worst feature. You aren't alone if you are not a fan of [Subaru's Auto Stop-Start system](https://www.reddit.com/r/subaru/comments/uzyqqx/everyone_seems_to_hate_the_auto_startstop_feature/) on the Outback, Crosstrek, Forester, and other vehicles. Most drivers dislike the auto/stop/start system that shuts the engine off. I've covered this topic before [here](https://www.torquenews.com/1084/new-subaru-outback-feature-owners-dislike-most-and-how-turn-it), but here is new information for [Subaru](https://www.torquenews.com/subaru) owners that you'll find helpful. Thanks to Alex Prestigiacomo from Bachman Subaru for some of the information in my report. What is auto start-stop technology? Auto start-stop, or stop-start technology, is a vehicle feature that automatically shuts off and restarts the engine when the car stops and starts moving again. This innovative system not only reduces fuel consumption and emissions, but also contributes to a cleaner environment, especially in congested cities where vehicles often stop at traffic lights or in traffic jams. The Auto start-stop feature reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The feature not only saves fuel but, more importantly, significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions. According to the [Battery Council International](https://batterycouncil.org/news/article/start-stop-reduces-auto-emissions/) in the U.S. alone, it is estimated to save as much as 10 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually, substantially contributing to our environment. In 2022, 65% of the cars sold had the auto start-stop technology, so it's here to stay. And more cars are coming with the new technology. Does the auto stop-start save fuel? It saves fuel, especially if you live in an area with heavy traffic. According to a study conducted by the [Society of American Engineers](https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2023-01-0346/) (SAE), turning your car's engine off is beneficial if it is going to be idling for at least seven seconds. Within that range of time, enough fuel is saved to restart the car. So, fuel will be saved whenever the engine is shut off for over seven seconds. I know of one stoplight on my commute where I can sit for as long as two minutes. After a period of time, the fuel savings add up. Subaru has a unique dash feature that shows how much fuel you are saving. Are there situations where the auto stop-start does not shut off? The auto start-stop has a sensor to determine if the ambient temperature outside the vehicle exceeds the temperature inside. If it is, the car engine will not shut off. The same is true in the winter. The car will stay running if the outside temperature is colder than the cabin. Or suppose your engine is only partially up to its normal operating temperature. In that case, the auto start-stop will not shut off the engine until it does reach the correct operating temperature. Will I lose the use of my car's cabin features with the engine shut off? You still have full access and use of all your cabin features when the engine shuts down, such as radio, navigation, and other electronic technology. Does the auto stop-start system cause excessive wear on the starter and battery, which could cause reliability issues? As with any technology, the components of the Auto Stop-Start system are continually being improved, ensuring its reliability and performance. Subaru is committed to providing a dependable driving experience. Subaru has one of the largest OEM batteries on the new Outback, Crosstrek, Forester, and other models. It can handle the extra load when the engine is shut off to power your lights and electronics inside the vehicle. Subaru vehicles have improved starter motor capacity compared to models without the auto stop-start technology. The starter shouldn't wear out sooner. I recently reported that Subaru has significantly [improved the Auto Stop/Start feature on the next-generation 2025 Forester](https://www.torquenews.com/1084/subaru-just-improved-foresters-worst-feature), which will surely please potential buyers and current owners. The 2025 Forester is powered by an updated version of Subaru's 2.5-liter, four-cylinder Boxer engine. It now produces 180 horsepower and 178 pound-feet of torque. Subaru says the engine produces more power at lower rpm, making it quicker off the line. Essential engine parts have been updated to make the engine more efficient, reliable, and lighter—the auto-stop/start is one of them. While Subaru has not publicly announced the improvement of Forester's new auto stop/start system, a report from Automotive News reassures us, stating that \"The stop-start system is barely detectable.\" This news will surely bring relief to current owners. Can you shut off the auto stop-start on a Subaru? Yes, you can temporarily shut off the auto stop-start system. On your touchscreen, there is an A icon with an arrow circling it at the bottom of the screen with a green light. If you tap the icon, it turns the auto stop-start system off. It's important to note that the system has a default and automatically resets when you turn off the car. Which Subaru models do not have the auto stop-start? As of the 2024 model year, the Subaru Ascent, Subaru WRX, and Subaru BRZ do not have the technology. All 2025 Outback, Forester, 2024 Crosstrek, Impreza, Legacy, and Solterra models have the technology. Look for Subaru to improve the next-generation Outback's auto stop start system, which will be in 2026. Stay tuned. Let us know your opinion on Subaru's auto stop/start feature.

It prevents the feature from turning back on each time you start your car. It took less than ten minutes to plug it in. No more annoying judder and hesitation when I step on the gas. Recommend highly. [Hate auto stop start on my…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163341) Hate auto stop start on my 2021 Outback Touring XT. Car shutters when it starts. Annoying and I turn it off as soon as I get in the car. Wouldn’t mind it if it was quiet and non invasive. Subaru needs to clean this up especially in new models with hybrid tech. [There are 2 ways to turn…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163342) There are 2 ways to turn this feature off. The button on the dash and an option embedded in the settings. Why the embedded option makes no sense. The vehicle has to be stopped but the feature turns back on after the next time the ignition shuts off. The latter function takes longer to complete and serves no purpose. It's totally useless. [The auto stop/ start feature…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163348) The auto stop/ start feature is not valuable on my 2021 Subaru Crosstrek Limited. The problem is that the expressway is about two miles away and has only one stop usually with no traffic. If I have to stop then the engine usually stops too however briefly that may be. There is almost no stop that lasts longer than 7 seconds. I have been conditioned to press the off button on the lower left-hand side of my dash to turn the system off. I wish all of the on/ off buttons were on the display screen. Once on the expressway, there is only one more stop, and again, there is no traffic. If I could disable the start/ stop feature permanently I would. [Auto start/stop is generally…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163356) Auto start/stop is generally the most worthless feature of my Forester. It should default to Off, requiring someone to turn it on.

Please address this thank you [I own a 2018 Subaru Outback…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163365) I own a 2018 Subaru Outback and the stop/start is a deal breaker for me to purchase a new Outback in the future. I plan to purchase a 5 year bumper to bumper warranty after my 7 year warranty expires later this year. This stop/start is nonsense and justifies the government’s plan for the Green New Deal that they’re doing something to protect the environment. It doesn’t do that much as they claim, but it’s just another annoyance for drivers! [It's not just the starter…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163366) It's not just the starter life I'm concerned about. Every time a car is started, the piston rings and crankshaft journals are producing friction and thus wear until oil pressure is restored. Granted its not as bad as a cold start, but why add to engine wear to save a few drops of fuel/emissions? And I'm not buying the claim that the supposedly beefed up starter can take it. Not to mention it's just plain annoying. [I don't own a Suburu but my…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163368) I don't own a Suburu but my Bronco Sport has this feature and I hate it. Not only is it going to wear out the starter, it's dangerous. The hesitation, in some instances, could cause an accident. It's like when the ABS brakes first came out in the 80's. That hesitation did cause accidents. And, not only accidents, if your battery goes bad and you get a jump to start it so you can drive to the shop, you might just be stuck at a traffic light when it shuts off. [I left my start/stop on…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163370) I left my start/stop on while driving around town. At the end of the driving I had saved 1 tablespoon. Underwhelming [Dangerous feature. In my…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163373) Dangerous feature. In my combo of roads there are 2 intersections I have to pull out in from side streets and when I forget to disable there are close calls or at least nasty interactions that you'd like to apologize to the other drivers for. 1 second = 88ft at 60 mph, and that's several car lengths of getting things wrong. [your article is garbage.why…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163374) The car's fuel economy improves by about 5 miles per gallon, which Subaru should not advertise as the car's standard fuel efficiency if this feature is the only factor. Without this feature, the Subaru gets incredibly poor gas mileage, even though it starts as one of the least fuel-efficient vehicles on the road. This is also an extremely dangerous feature, as it can shut off when you need to merge. Additionally, it sometimes shuts off unexpectedly, causing the entire car system to malfunction. I want a car that works and doesn't contribute to higher emissions. [I hated it on my 2021 Legacy…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163375) I hated it on my 2021 Legacy Touring XT. The car would shake noticeably every time it restarted. I've driven a number of other vehicles with it and Subaru's was the worst. I always turned it off. My current car is a 2023 Hyundai Tucson and it's auto stop/start feature is smooth enough I leave it on. [I kick myself whenever I…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163378) I kick myself whenever I forget to turn off the auto stop/start function in my 2023 Forester. I cross shopped several brands prior to deciding on the Subaru. I knew that others, such as the 2024 Mazda CX-5 (my second choice), did not have auto/stop start, but I hadn't imagined that I would loathe it as much as I do. They should make it an option. [I find it very annoying when…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163379) I find it very annoying when pulling into my driveway and the auto stop/start shuts the engine off before I've had the chance to shut the engine off properly. It then restarts if I slightly remove pressure on my brake pedal only for me to shut the engine off half a second later. I also don't like how the vehicle shakes every time the engine restarts. [Had it in a loaner from…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163380) Had it in a loaner from Subaru and absolutely hated it. I’ll try to keep the old Forester running. [You said: <blockquote cite=\"…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163381) You said: \"The auto start-stop has a sensor to determine if the ambient temperature outside the vehicle exceeds the temperature inside. If it is, the car engine will not shut off. The same is true in the winter. The car will stay running if the outside temperature is colder than the cabin.\" According to this, it only works when ambient temperature and cabin temperature are equal. I think you were given some misinformation. [Agreed, this paragraph is…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163434) Agreed, the temp outside does not affect whether the auto start kicks in or not in my '24 Crosstrek. In fact, if I don't turn it off on the touchscreen, then when the engine shuts off at a red light it also shuts off my AC. Just the fan blowing ambient temperature air, which really sucks in August. I've only had it 5 months so I can't comment yet on heat use in winter. Pressing that button is quickly becoming part of my startup movements. [I have a 2020 Forester and I…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163382) I have a 2020 Forester and I absolutely detest the stop-start feature. The first thing I do when I start my car is turn that feature off. I don't believe that it does not wear down the starter since I already need mine replaced. The cost of replacing my starter is far exceeding the pennies I've saved in gas. I've been searching for a way to permanently disable this feature but haven't had any luck yet. If anyone knows of one - please let me know! [Annoying doesn’t begin to…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163383) Annoying doesn’t begin to describe it. It is a horrible system, the car shudders and lurches forward when restarting. I always disable it as soon as I start the car. [It has become a habitual…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163384) It has become a habitual part of driving my 2022 Crosstrek to reach to the dash and manually disable the auto start/stop feature EVERY time the engine is started. The sensation is too harsh when shutting off (feels like an engine stall) and there's too much of a delay to resume motion. The wear and tear on starter and battery surely will have some affect. The higher capacity battery will also be more expensive when replacement is needed, I'm sure. [I do the same thing. O…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163389) I do the same thing. O detest the feature. There should be a way to get rid of it all the time. [2019 Forester Sport owner…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163385) 2019 Forester Sport owner and I hate the A.S.S. but found out if I have my rear defrost on then the A.S.S. will never engage. And even on hot days my older version of A.S.S. definitely won't let my AC run full blast and turns to vent mode and is ridiculous. [The auto start/stop is the…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163386) The auto start/stop is the feature on my 2024 Crosstrek Limited that I strongly dislike. It is the first thing I turn off when starting the car. I wish the default setting could be changed. I don’t want some Big Brother controlling the start/stop default setting. Some day EV and charging stations will evolve to the point that auto start/stop will be a thing of the past. But not today. [Agree with most of the…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163391) Agree with most of the negative comments, and habitually turn it off when starting the car. The worst part is definitely a stop sign at a busy crossroads; that pause can seem like forever when trying to cross busy traffic. [I have my Outback for three…](/1084/subarus-worst-feature-auto-stop-start-truths-revealed#comment-163392) I have my Outback for three months and no only do I hate the stop/start feature, the car is a gas guzzler. It can’t even get 19 mpg. I hate everything about this car except for the comfort. I regret my decision to buy it.",

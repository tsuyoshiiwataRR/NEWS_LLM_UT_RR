    "text": "Paris Hilton found herself under scrutiny once again after the “parenting police” criticised her for not putting a life jacket on her son, Phoenix Barron Hilton Reum, during a recent outing at sea. The 43-year-old reality star had shared a TikTok video featuring her 1-year-old son exploring a luxury Sunreef catamaran during a vacation in France last month. What Is In The Video? In the video, Phoenix is seen happily wandering around the catamaran in a burgundy shirt and matching shorts as the boat cruised over the water. He walked across the deck, crawled on the mesh netting above the water, and even called out \\\"Mama\\\" as he climbed down a few steps. While the video captured a joyful moment, several followers expressed concern about the toddler’s safety, as he was not wearing a life jacket during the excursion. One concerned fan commented, \\\"Momma, please have him wear a life jacket always on a boat!! Stuff happens. That’s why they’re called accidents. With love.\\\" Another added, \\\"My anxiety not seeing him in a life jacket! Can never be too safe on the water!\\\" A string of similar comments flooded the post, with followers urging Hilton to prioritize her son's safety. What Was Paris Hilton's Response? On Thursday, Hilton responded to the criticism by explaining that both she and her husband, Carter Reum, had been closely monitoring Phoenix throughout the outing. \\\"Hey Mamma’s, thank you for the advice & always caring about my #CutesieCrew. It’s a big boat & my husband and I are following him around everywhere & watching like hawks. My babies are my world!\\\" she wrote in the comments section.

Earlier in May, Hilton shared a TikTok video of herself playing with Phoenix in the water, but followers quickly pointed out that the safety vest her son was wearing was incorrectly fastened backward. Hilton responded with humour, acknowledging the mistake and reassuring fans that she had the situation under control. \\\"Oops! Thank you! I never let him out of my arms. Thought it was backward too, I said that to the person whom I bought it from & they said it was on right,\\\" she replied. Hilton has also been criticised for improperly harnessing her children in car seats. After receiving feedback from her followers, the socialite posted an update, showing that she had corrected the issue and expressed gratitude for the advice. \\\"Thanks for the mom advice, I'm new to this,\\\" Hilton wrote. Paris Hilton and Carter Reum, who married in November 2021, welcomed their son Phoenix via surrogate in February 2023 and recently revealed they also welcomed a daughter, London, with the help of a surrogate. Hilton, who has been eagerly embracing motherhood, had previously shared her excitement about starting a family and balancing her career and personal life.

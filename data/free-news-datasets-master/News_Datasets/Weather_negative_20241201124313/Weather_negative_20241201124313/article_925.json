    "text": "Delhi records warmest October in 70 yrs; Diwali smog adds to woes Delhi has recorded its warmest October after more than seven decades, breaking previous records. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the monthly maximum and minimum temperatures over Safdarjung for October this year have been recorded as 35.1°C and 21.2°C, respectively. “Thus, October 2024 becomes the warmest October after 1951 in terms of both maximum and minimum temperatures,” the IMD said. The highest average maximum and minimum temperatures for October was recorded at 36.2°C and 22.3°C, respectively, in 1951. Other previous records for October include in 1941, with an average monthly maximum temperature of 35.8°C; and in 1907, when the average maximum temperature touched 35.5°C. Additionally, October 1930 and 1938 recorded average monthly maximum temperatures of 35°C. Likewise, average monthly minimum temperatures in October were recorded at 22.3°C in both 1915 and 1951; with 1941 recording 22.1°C. This points out that these years have recorded warmer nights. The absence of western disturbances, which could lead to rain in the hilly regions of north India, is the primary cause behind the unusually warm October heat.",

    "text": "By DPA ,\n22 minutes ago\nThe season finale in grand prix motorcycling will not take place in Valencia due to the severe flash floods in the region which have caused wide-ranging destruction and left more than 200 people dead.\nOrganizers Dorna said on Friday that the November 17 races in MotoGP, Moto2 and Moto3 would be moved to another venue but that funds would be raised to help with the victims.\n\"After carefully weighing up the potential positive impact of MotoGP racing in Valencia on delayed dates versus ensuring no single resource is diverted from the recovery efforts by the presence of MotoGP, the championship and local authorities have been obliged to cancel the 2024 Valencia GP,\" a statement said.\n\"In lieu of racing in Valencia, MotoGP will instead race for Valencia.\n\"The championship will put our collective efforts behind backing the relief funds already in place to ensure our positive impact can connect with the area in the way it best serves the people and communities we have been part of for so long.\n\"Our efforts will begin during the Malaysian GP and continue at the final round of 2024, with a new venue and dates to be announced as soon as confirmed.\"\nDuring Tuesday's extremely heavy rainfall - in some areas as much water fell in one day as would normally come down in a year - rivers burst their banks in the Valencia region. The floodwaters destroyed houses and swept away trees, people and vehicles.\nOther sports events have been postponed, such as the La Liga football match between Valencia and Real Madrid. Real said they would make â‚¬1 million ($1.08 million) available for flood victims.",

    "text": "October was the driest month in New York City since record-keeping began more than 100 years ago, according to meteorologists. And the dry spell is not forecast to end anytime soon. “It's almost 'rinse and repeat' except we're not getting rinsed off,” meteorologist Dominic Ramunni of the National Weather Service said. “We're going to see another few days of very unseasonably warm weather as we move into early next week.” Central Park has seen just barely 1.5 inches of rain since the beginning of September – a number that normally hovers around 7 or 8 inches, Ramunni said. And October was the driest part of that period, with just .01 of an inch of rain recorded in the park. But the month had one more record left to break before turning the calendar page: It was the warmest Halloween ever, according to meteorologists. Even though Friday morning might see a sprinkle or two come through, the National Weather Service has issued a [red flag warning](https://www.weather.gov/lot/firewx_definition#:~:text=A%20Fire%20Weather%20Watch%20or,watches%20and%20red%20flag%20warnings.) for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut for the day – due in part to blustery winds, which increase the risk that fires can start and be carried around. That means residents should use closed containers to burn anything, extinguish outdoor fires with plenty of water, and never leave fires unattended. The weather service also warns people not to throw cigarette butts or matches out of moving cars, because they can ignite on dry roadside grasses. The current warning will last until Friday evening, when winds are expected to die down, however the weather service has been issuing such warnings frequently. Temperatures will be cooler over the weekend, with a crisp 58 degrees forecasted as a high for the New York City marathon. A frontal passage next week could bring a few rain showers, but Ramunni said they won’t be enough to meaningfully change the dry conditions – which have[ stuck around so long](https://gothamist.com/news/central-parks-dry-spell-nears-century-old-record-as-october-remains-rain-free) thanks to a high-pressure system and a pattern of moisture-lacking air that’s prevented rainfall. “The drought buster is just not on the horizon at this point,” he said. While New York hasn’t seen many major fires yet, New Jersey and Connecticut have [battled hundreds of blazes](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/31/nyregion/new-jersey-connecticut-wildfires-drought.html?partner=slack&smid=sl-share) that have consumed hundreds of acres this fall – sharp increases from 2023. Despite the lack of rain, New York’s reservoir levels are still [not far below normal](https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/reservoir-levels.page). Parts of coastal and southwest New Jersey are in [more dire water conditions](https://dep.nj.gov/drought/current-conditions/). Most of Connecticut’s reservoirs have also [not yet entered](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/departments-and-agencies/dph/dph/drinking_water/pdf/surface-water-capacity-summary-and-drought-tracking-report-10-25-2024.pdf) drought stages.",

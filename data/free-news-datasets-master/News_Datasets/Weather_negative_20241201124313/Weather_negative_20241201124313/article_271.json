    "text": "14 hours ago Rainfall is expected across the region, with northern areas of the San Joaquin Valley, including Fresno County Photo by Matteo Catanese on Unsplash Central California will experience cooler-than-average temperatures and wet weather conditions through the weekend, according to the National Weather Service in Hanford. High temperatures in the San Joaquin Valley are unlikely to reach above 70 degrees, with a 50 to near 100 percent chance of staying below that mark through Monday.\nA Winter Weather Advisory is in effect for the Sierra Nevada from Friday evening at 5 p.m. through Saturday at 11 p.m., with a 50 to 70 percent chance of receiving 4 inches or more of snow above 6,000 feet. Higher elevations could see up to 8 inches of snowfall. Tioga Pass specifically has a 64 percent chance of accumulating at least 2 inches.\nThe Kern County Desert will face strong winds, with a High Wind Watch issued from 8 p.m. Saturday through 10 a.m. Sunday. Gusts may reach 60 mph in the Mojave Desert Slopes area, coinciding with the shift back to standard time, so residents are reminded to adjust their clocks.\nRainfall is expected across the region, with northern areas of the San Joaquin Valley, including Fresno County, seeing a 35 to 65 percent chance of a quarter-inch of rain. Areas south of Fresno County will have a 20 to 40 percent chance of lighter rainfall. Conditions will dry out and temperatures will return to normal early next week.",

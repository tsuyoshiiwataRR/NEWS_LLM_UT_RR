    "text": "TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [warned](https://www.cdc.gov.tw/Bulletin/Detail/xrTFytWkpvm-PatvjZg2uw?typeid=9) the public Friday (Nov. 1) of potential health risks following Typhoon Kong-rey, urging residents to take preventive measures to avoid mosquito-borne diseases and other infections. Heavy rainfall from the typhoon can lead to waterlogging and flooding, creating ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The CDC advised the public to eliminate standing water in containers, clean gutters and drains, and wear protective gear when cleaning up debris. Mosquito breeding prevention In the week following a typhoon, the risk of dengue fever increases. The public is advised to conduct thorough inspections of their homes and surroundings, following the “search, empty, clean, and brush” guideline. To prevent mosquito breeding, inspect and clean all containers, both indoors and outdoors. For larger items like bathtubs or aquariums, contact the sanitation department for proper disposal. To eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites, scrub remaining items to remove eggs. Then, store or invert these items to prevent water accumulation. Individuals experiencing symptoms like fever, headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, eye pain, muscle aches, or rash, should seek immediate medical attention and inform a doctor of recent activities to aid in diagnosis. Southern Taiwan residents should prioritize inspecting and cleaning roof gutters and back alley drains. These areas are common breeding grounds for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Prevention of injury and infection Individuals should wear protective gear like rain boots, gloves, and a mask when cleaning up. This will help avoid cuts and scrapes from rusty objects that could lead to infections such as leptospirosis, melioidosis, and tetanus. Additionally, wearing a mask indoors and outdoors can reduce the risk of inhaling harmful particles. Intestinal diseases To prevent foodborne illness, avoid consuming food that has been soaked in water or thawed for an extended period. Disinfect household surfaces with a 1:100 household bleach solution. To sanitize kitchen utensils and tableware, boil them or disinfect them with a solution of 40 ml bleach in 10 liters of water. Rinse thoroughly with clean water before use. During water shortages, drink only boiled water or bottled water. If the water supply resumes but appears contaminated, report the issue to local water authorities immediately. If soap and water are not accessible, use a hand sanitizer with an alcohol content between 60% and 95%.",

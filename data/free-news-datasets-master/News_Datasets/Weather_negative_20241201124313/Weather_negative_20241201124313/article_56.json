This is the seventh of nine 55-hour single lane closures scheduled to complete barrier upgrade and related work. Each closure work limits will be a 2.5-mile section. All work will be done outside of Express Lane operational hours. An additional lane may be closed at various times during the closures to facilitate equipment and materials.

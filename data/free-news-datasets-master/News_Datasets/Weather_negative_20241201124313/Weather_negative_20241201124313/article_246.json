    "text": "HSINCHU (TVBS News) — Typhoon Kong-rey (康芮颱風) has wreaked havoc in Hsinchu (新竹), causing strong winds and heavy rain that left 1,117 households without power on Friday (Nov. 1). Taipower (台電) has mobilized teams, striving to restore electricity before the day's end.\nThe outages primarily affect the mountainous areas of Jianshi Township (尖石鄉), where landslides have severely disrupted roadways, complicating repair efforts.\nThe typhoon has caused significant damage throughout Hsinchu, with numerous trees toppling and damaging power cables. At the height of the storm, 12,649 households experienced power outages.\nTo enhance repair efficiency, Taipower's Hsinchu District Office convened a disaster response meeting at 7 a.m. Friday. Under the leadership of its Disaster Response Team Commander Luo Yuan-liang (羅元良), the team assessed available personnel and contractors, dispatching additional workers to support mountainous regions.\nResidents in the remote areas of Jianshi Township have faced severe challenges due to fallen trees and landslides triggered by strong winds and heavy rains. These conditions have damaged power lines and poles, exacerbating the crisis. Taipower's Hsinchu District Office has established communication channels with village chiefs to report outages. They urge residents to contact their village chiefs or call the Taipower customer service hotline at 1911 for assistance.",

    "text": "Previously classified as a “super typhoon,” Kong-Rey has slightly weakened but still maintains the power of a Category 4 hurricane, with winds reaching over 250 km/h near its center, according to Tropical Storm Risk. The Taiwanese government has ordered a shutdown of government offices, the stock market, and canceled hundreds of flights on October 30 ahead of Typhoon Kong-Rey, expected to be the largest storm to pass through Taiwan in three decades.\nThe Taiwan Central Weather Bureau reported that Kong-Rey would make landfall in eastern Taiwan’s mountainous region, a sparsely populated area, at 2:00 PM local time. Despite this, the typhoon’s influence is expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain across nearly the entire island.\nPreviously classified as a “super typhoon,” Kong-Rey has slightly weakened but still maintains the power of a Category 4 hurricane, with winds reaching over 250 km/h near its center, according to Tropical Storm Risk.\nMeteorologist Gene Huang stated that after impacting Taiwan’s eastern areas, Kong-Rey is expected to move into the Taiwan Strait while gradually weakening. Residents have been urged to stay indoors to avoid hazardous winds.\nThe Central Weather Bureau has issued a high wind warning, forecasting gusts exceeding 160 km/h in Taitung County. Eastern Taiwan could receive up to 1.2 meters of rain, with strong coastal winds across the region.\nThe Ministry of National Defense has mobilized 36,000 troops for disaster relief, and 1,300 residents in vulnerable areas have already been evacuated.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a major chip supplier to Apple and Nvidia, announced that it has prepared typhoon-response measures at all factories and construction sites. “We anticipate minimal impact on operations,” TSMC stated via email.\nTaiwan’s Ministry of Transportation reported that 298 international flights were canceled, along with 139 domestic flights and ferry services to outlying islands. High-speed rail services connecting major cities in western Taiwan will remain operational on a limited basis, while overground metro services in Taipei have been suspended due to high winds.\nKong-Rey is expected to reach China’s Fujian province on Friday morning, November 1.",

    "text": "Typhoon Kong-rey Strikes Taiwan: A Storm of Historic Proportions Taiwan faced severe disruptions as Typhoon Kong-rey marked the largest storm in nearly 30 years, causing two deaths and significant infrastructural damage. The typhoon disrupted flights, led to warnings for further localized heavy rainfall, and continued to impact Taiwan and nearby regions despite weakening after its passage. Taiwan is recovering from the wrath of Typhoon Kong-rey, as offices and financial markets reopened on Friday. The storm left two dead, over 500 injured, and caused widespread travel disruptions. The typhoon, which hit Taiwan on Thursday, was the largest by size in decades. It traversed the island's central region before heading into the Taiwan Strait. In its aftermath, heavy rains and powerful winds toppled thousands of trees and street signs in Taipei, urging President Lai Ching-te to issue warnings for continued caution. Rescue operations were conducted in affected regions, including Taroko National Park in Hualien. Transportation started gradually returning to normal even as parts of central and southern Taiwan braced for more rain. Kong-rey, although weakened, still poses a threat as it heads towards Japan via the Taiwan Strait. (With inputs from agencies.)

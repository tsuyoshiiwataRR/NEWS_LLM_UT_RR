    "text": "High temperatures across several New England cities, including Boston and Worcester, broke records on Friday.\nBoston hit a high of 79 degrees, surpassing the 1974 record of 77 degrees on Nov. 1, according to the National Weather Service.\nTo the west, Worcester reached 76 degrees, breaking its 2003 record of 73 degrees.\nHartford was just a little warmer than Boston, hitting a high of 84 degrees. The last record high was on Nov. 1, 1974, at 81 degrees.\nProvidence tied with its record high in the same year at 78 degrees.\nThese records come amidst a Red Flag Warning set to last until 7 p.m. Days of wind, very little moisture and drought conditions have fueled several wildfires across parts of the state, including in Salem, Lynn, Wilmington, Middleton and Canton.\nIn October, at least 200 wildfires were reported, with almost half of them reported in the last week, Fire Marshal Jon Davine’s office said in a statement released on Friday. The October average of 15 fires jumped by 1,200% last month.\n“They accounted for more than half of the 1,158 acres burned so far this year,” Chief Fire Warden David Celino of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation said in Davine’s statement. “The weather conditions and dry surface fuels that have contributed to these fast-moving fires are expected to continue in the days ahead. Any outdoor fire will grow quickly, become difficult to control, and require numerous firefighting resources.”\nThe warm weather is not expected to stay for long, as temperatures are expected to drop starting Saturday with highs in the 50s, forecasters said.",

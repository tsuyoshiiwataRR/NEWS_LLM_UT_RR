    "text": "By VICTOR WOODDELL Capital News Service LANSING – The 2023-24 winter was the warmest on record in the U.S. with average temperatures throughout the state above freezing, with close to average precipitation, according to the National Weather Service. Data from the Southeast Regional Climate Center shows that average daily maximum temperatures in the Midwest were several degrees above normal between December 2023 and February 2024. But this year may be different. The outlook for Michigan for the 2024-25 winter is for increased precipitation and lower average temperatures than last year due to an expected “La Niña” effect, the National Weather Service says. A La Niña is when cold water temperatures in the Pacific Ocean affect the weather across the continental United States. That could mean more snow. Kelly Wolgamott is vice president of Pure Michigan, the state’s travel and tourism promotion agency. “We are more than likely to get more snow than last year – a good thing with the lack of snow we had last year,” she said. According to Wolgamott, Michigan’s tourism-oriented businesses are preparing for a strong season. “Snow sport destinations across the state have made significant investments in technology and infrastructure,” she said. Cross Country Ski Headquarters in Roscommon is one example, she said. “They have the latest technology for making snow, so they can make snow on their trails even if they are not getting the same organic snow they got in the past.” Crystal Mountain in Thompsonville is one resort that has increased its snow-making capacity, she said. But Michigan locations are not counting on snow-related activities alone, Wolgamott said. “Many resort locations are diversifying their offerings to be less weather-dependent.” Alternative activities include fat tire biking, hiking and horseback riding. “Boyne Mountain put in the SkyBridge that can be used regardless of the temperature,” she said, referring to a ski resort in Boyne Falls. Nevertheless, the state is still investing resources to support snow-related activities. Starting this December, Pure Michigan will begin tracking snowfall “to give travelers the opportunity to identify the ideal location, depending on what they want,” Wolgamot said. That information will provide real-time conditions at destinations offering skiing and other seasonal recreational activities, like dogsledding and snowshoeing, she said.",

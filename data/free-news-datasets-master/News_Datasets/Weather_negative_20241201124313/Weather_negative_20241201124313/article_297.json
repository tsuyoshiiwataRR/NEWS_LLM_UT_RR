    "text": "The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a heavy rainfall warning for Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and surrounding areas due to a deep atmospheric circulation over the Gulf of Mannar. IMD scientist Soma Sen Roy announced on Friday that this system is expected to bring substantial rainfall across southern India.“Yesterday, 11 cm of rainfall was recorded in Tamil Nadu, 6-7 cm in Kerala, and 9 cm along coastal Karnataka. Heavy to very heavy rainfall, between 12-20 cm, is anticipated in interior Kerala and south interior Tamil Nadu,” Roy stated, as reported by ANI.Weather impact and precautionsAs per the IMD's regional office, heavy rainfall could lead to waterlogging, potentially disrupting traffic and causing minor damage to weaker structures. The agency advises residents to remain indoors, avoid travel if possible, and ensure children and pets are safely indoors. Any loose items like timber or debris should be secured to prevent accidents.The IMD further advised those outdoors to avoid metal structures, utility lines, trees, and fences, as these can conduct electricity during thunderstorms. Additionally, people should stay away from windows, doors, and corded electrical devices, which could increase the risk of lightning-related accidents.North India: Temperature drop expected after November 3For northern regions of India, clear weather is expected to continue. Strong winds will persist across north India over the next 2-3 days, with no temperature fluctuations expected until November 3. Afterward, a decrease of 2-3 degrees Celsius is likely due to north-westerly winds, added Roy.Seven-day weather forecastThe IMD’s seven-day forecast highlights very heavy rainfall over Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Mahe on November 1, with a slight reduction in intensity in the following days. Additionally, a gradual temperature drop is anticipated in northern and eastern India, with minimum and maximum temperatures likely to fall by 2-3 degrees between November 3-7.Inputs from ANI",

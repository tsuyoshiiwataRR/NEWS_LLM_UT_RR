    "text": "Worcester welcomed in the month of November with record warmth. According to the National Weather Service, the temperature in the city hit 76 degrees on Friday, easily breaking the previous record high for Nov. 1 of 73 degrees, which was set in 2003. Boston (79 degrees) and Hartford, Connecticut, (84) also saw record high temperatures, while Providence tied a record with 78. The high temperatures Friday followed a near-record Halloween. Worcester peaked at 77 degrees on Thursday, 2 degrees below the record for any Oct. 31, set in 1946. Temperatures will dip substantially this weekend, with highs in the mid 50s on Saturday and in the low 50s on Sunday and Monday. Warmer weather, with highs around 70 degrees, will return Tuesday through Thursday, according to the forecast. Meanwhile, there is no little to no rain in sight. That's a concern with the state under a red flag warning for brush fires due to dry and windy conditions. All of Worcester County is now experiencing moderate drought conditions .",

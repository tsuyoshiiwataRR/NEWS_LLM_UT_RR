    "text": "On Friday at 9:53 a.m. a red flag warning was issued by the National Weather Service valid for Friday between noon and 7 p.m. for Blair, Huntingdon, Bedford, Fulton, Franklin, Union, Snyder, Montour, Northumberland, Columbia, Perry, Dauphin, Lebanon, Cumberland, Adams, York and Lancaster counties.\nResidents can expect winds to be west 10 to 15 mph with gusts up to 30 mph and relative humidity as low as 25 to 30 percent.\n\"Rapid wildfire growth and spread expected. Outdoor burning is not recommended,\" adds the weather service.\nWhat is the significance of a red flag warning? A red flag warning signifies that either extreme fire weather conditions are currently in effect or will be shortly, as stated by the weather service. Warm temperatures, very low humidities, and stronger winds are expected to combine to produce an increased risk of fire to spread rapidly.\nSo, what steps should you follow during a red flag warning? During a red flag warning, it is crucial to exercise extreme caution and be prepared to take immediate action in case a fire starts. The weather service offers these steps you can take to lower the risk of fires igniting and ensure your safety:\n1. Bolster burn barrel safety:\nIn areas where controlled burning is sanctioned, make certain that burn barrels sport a weighty metal cover, equipped with holes no larger than 3/4 of an inch. 2. Mindful handling of smoking materials:\nNever discard lit cigarette butts outside, and avoid tossing cigarettes or matches from a moving vehicle. These seemingly small actions can lead to dry grass ignition, potentially sparking a wildfire. 3. Prudent fire extinguishing practices:\nTo safeguard against accidental fires, diligently extinguish all outdoor fires. Drown them with an ample amount of water and stir to confirm that everything is cold to the touch. Submerge charcoal in water until it's thoroughly cooled. Never dispose of live charcoal on the ground. 4. Never leave fires unattended:\nRECOMMENDED â€¢ pennlive.com\nFire warning for Southeast Pa. until Friday evening Nov. 1, 2024, 8:23 a.m.\nFire weather watch for part of Pennsylvania until Friday evening Nov. 1, 2024, 3:11 a.m.\nAvoid leaving any fire unattended. Even sparks or embers carried by the wind can ignite nearby leaves or grass, triggering a fire that spreads rapidly. Understanding the gravity of a red flag warning and adhering to these precautions is pivotal in mitigating the risk of wildfires during these perilous conditions. Prioritize safety, stay well-informed, and act responsibly to safeguard lives and property.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

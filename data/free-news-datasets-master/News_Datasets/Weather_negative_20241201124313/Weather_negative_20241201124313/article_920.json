    "text": "BOLZANO. The strong wind, the incessant rain and the message from⁣ the ⁣Spanish ​government on ⁢all cell phones in ⁢the​ region: “Don’t leave your house.” ⁢For i Bolzanians on holiday‌ in Valencia for the Sharm​ week it ⁣was a shock. Locked⁤ in a hotel, they experienced the ⁣most dramatic days for ​Spain in recent decades.\n«The weather forecast was‌ rain, but we certainly never expected a storm of this type – he​ says Diana B ., returned on Wednesday ⁣- Fortunately our area, between the city of⁢ science and the sea,⁤ was less affected ​than the others”. She and her group were among the‍ few ⁤who managed to catch the​ flight home on Wednesday. Dozens were ⁣cancelled, ⁤plus, due to the flooded streets ⁣and the ⁣closed subway, it‍ was almost impossible to reach the⁢ airport.\nAnother Bolzano girl, Raffaella Less who returned yesterday from holidays⁣ in Valencia, took off ‍on⁣ the return plane and ⁣witnessed ⁤an ⁤apocalyptic​ scenario. «We saw all the ​flooded areas. In the city we didn’t realize the extent of the‌ disaster, ​also ⁣because the area around​ the port, where we were staying, was not particularly affected. We‌ felt the strong⁢ wind, yes. And in the night a terrible rain, never felt before. I ‌thought of Emilia Romagna.”\nOn Tuesday evening the group of holidaymakers from Bolzano were sitting at the restaurant table when, suddenly, all the phones in the room started⁢ ringing. ⁢It was the civil protection alert, activated at around 7.30pm, hours after the⁣ start of the disaster. «We⁣ all rushed out. – ‍says Raffaella Less – An absurd wind was blowing⁤ outside. We ‌heard ‌from citizens that ‍the⁤ largest floods occurred between ‌4 and 5 in the afternoon. ⁣The‌ alarm came much later… There must have been a flaw​ in ‌the system.”\nOn ‌the road, he explains, there were fallen trees, but nothing​ to suggest what was happening a ⁣few kilometers‌ further ​north. Public transport in⁢ the‌ city‌ immediately went haywire.‌ “We started ‌desperately ‍looking for a ‍taxi: ​we⁤ were all on the street trying to hail one,” says ⁣Less.\nMoving was ⁤also dramatic for Diana and her group. «We were ⁤supposed to⁤ catch the return flight at ⁢6pm on Wednesday. – he says – Finding a taxi was a challenge. The city was in complete chaos. Getting‌ to the airport was impossible, the drivers lied ⁣to the police at⁤ the checkpoint about ⁢where they were going,‌ because otherwise they would have sent them back. We were afraid of finding ourselves stuck along ⁢a ⁢flooded road.”\nChristian Alderucci a ⁢former hockey player⁢ from Bolzano, never ⁤made it to ⁣Valencia: he left yesterday on a ​flight from Italy and⁢ was landed as an emergency‌ in Malaga. A few hours later ​he decided to go back, like him many⁤ other Italians. “There were​ no means of transport to‍ reach Valencia – he said when reached by phone⁣ – I had to stay in Spain ⁤until Saturday, but it makes no sense to visit the city in those conditions”.⁤ Like everyone, he is shocked ⁤by the images broadcast by the international‍ media.\nInterview between‍ Time.news Editor ⁤and Weather Expert: Dr. Elena Torrens\nTime.news Editor: ⁣Good afternoon, Dr. Torrens. Thank you for joining⁢ us today. We’re here to discuss the recent ⁣severe weather event that struck Valencia, ⁣affecting many holidaymakers, including several from Bolzano. Can you first give us a brief⁤ overview of what caused‍ this unexpected storm?\nDr. Elena Torrens: ⁤ Good ‌afternoon! Absolutely, it’s great to be ‌here. The storms ⁢in Valencia were primarily ⁢caused by a combination ⁤of unusually warm sea temperatures and a​ low-pressure system that​ moved into‍ the area. This​ created a perfect storm scenario, leading to intense rainfall, strong winds, and ultimately⁤ flash flooding. While we can typically predict rain, storms of​ this​ magnitude⁢ are more challenging.\nTime.news Editor: It sounds⁤ incredibly alarming. We heard from travelers like Diana⁤ B. and Raffaella Less who experienced sudden alerts from the government to stay indoors. What typically triggers such alerts, ‌and was this response ‌timely enough?\nDr. Elena Torrens: ​ Civil protection alerts are usually triggered when the situation poses a significant threat to life and property. In this case, the alert came late relative to when the worst conditions began, as Raffaella mentioned. The response systems depend on real-time data and forecasts that unfortunately may not always align perfectly with the fast-changing conditions in⁢ severe weather events. In‍ this instance, the delayed warning ‍may have reflected a flaw‌ in the communication system between meteorological forecasts and civil authorities.\nTime.news Editor: That’s quite concerning. Raffaella shared that she thought of Emilia Romagna, likely referencing⁣ the ⁢devastating floods that impacted that region earlier. How do you assess the climate patterns in Spain, especially considering ⁢the potential for more intense weather ⁢events due to climate change?\nDr. Elena Torrens: You’re right to draw ⁤that connection. ⁣Spain, like many parts of the world, is​ experiencing changes ​in climate patterns, which contribute to more extreme weather events. Increased temperatures can lead to more moisture in​ the⁤ atmosphere, resulting⁢ in heavier ‍rainfall during storms. This is not just a localized issue; ⁢it’s a symptom of a global trend, and regions that traditionally weren’t prone to such severe weather are now vulnerable.\nTime.news Editor: That’s⁣ a sobering thought. What advice can you‍ give to travelers about staying safe during​ such unpredictable weather, especially when they are far from home?\nDr. Elena Torrens: My primary advice is to stay informed. Travelers should monitor reliable weather channels and local ⁤news for real-time updates. Additionally, having a plan in place, knowing the nearest evacuation routes,‌ and understanding local ‌emergency protocols can be vital. It’s also wise⁢ to⁢ have a few basic supplies on hand,‍ such ⁤as water and non-perishable food, just in case.\nTime.news‍ Editor: Excellent advice, Dr. Torrens. As we wrap ​up, how‍ can communities better prepare for and respond to these increasingly severe weather events in the future?\nDr. Elena Torrens: Communities⁣ need to invest‍ in robust infrastructure that can handle extreme weather, improve early warning systems, and enhance public‌ awareness campaigns concerning emergency preparedness. Collaboration with experts in meteorology and civil defense is crucial. Ultimately, fostering community resilience can greatly mitigate the impacts of such disasters.\nTime.news Editor: Thank you for your insights, Dr. Torrens. It’s crucial information for both travelers and communities. ​We ​appreciate your time and expertise today.\nDr.⁣ Elena Torrens: Thank you for having me. Stay safe, everyone!",

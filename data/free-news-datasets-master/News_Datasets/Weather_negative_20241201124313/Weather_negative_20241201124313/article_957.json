I believe North Pennsylvania near Memorial is definitely an area we highlight, Station 15 knows about that,” Chenoweth said.Several inches of rain are expected this weekend and into Monday. Fire officials said they have recurring training for when water levels start to rise.>> Download the KOCO 5 App“They train every few months for swiftwater emergencies — they go through rope rescue training, and they know how to throw ropes and do all that stuff,” Chenoweth said.Officials said the biggest problems usually happen on the roadways. A few inches of rain may not sound like a lot, but in a vehicle, it can wreak havoc. Even though it is inconvenient, driving through questionable water is not worth the risk.“About 12 inches (of water) can move a car, and anywhere from 18 to 24 inches can move large SUVs,” Chenoweth said. “What we’re prone to see, is people getting too confident, and just drive through water. People think their pickup trucks can go through deep water.”Fire officials said they have the capability to bring on more staff if they need to, with the rain expected to start Saturday night.Top HeadlinesPreliminary report lists what might have caused Rush Fire at Wichita Mountains Wildlife RefugeSnow in Hawaii?

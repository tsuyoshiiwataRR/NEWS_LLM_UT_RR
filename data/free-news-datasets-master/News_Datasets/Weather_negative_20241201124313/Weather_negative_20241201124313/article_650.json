DANA: Palma de Mallorca emergency prevention plan Reflecting on the damage caused by recent storms and with rainfall expected to reach 50 litres per square metre within an hour, Palma’s deputy mayor, Javier Bonet, has announced a series of safety measures. Alongside deploying additional firefighters, local police, Civil Protection units, and 20 Emaya (Municipal Water And Sewage Company) municipal brigades, the city council will also temporarily close several parks and cemeteries from Friday November 1 at 2:00 pm until Monday November 4.\nAffected parks include Passeig Sagrera, Bellver Forest, Son Tarres Park, and Ses Vies Park. However, in recognition of All Saints’ Day, cemeteries will remain accessible to visitors from 8:00 am to 9:00 pm.\nMost Read on Euro Weekly News Squatter crackdown: Spain’s swift new law puts homeowners first Network provider Ericsson might relocate its HQ from Sweden to the US Liam Payne's funeral: a heartfelt farewell to a beloved star taken too soon Additionally, as a proactive measure following recent flooding incidents in Valencia , the city council will assist homeless individuals in flood-risk areas by providing temporary accommodation for the duration of the alert.\nOrange alert for potential flash flooding in Mallorca AEMET warns of intense storm activity due to large-scale convective systems that will likely affect the Balearic Sea and surrounding islands, with rainfall of up to 50 mm expected in an hour and totals reaching 120 mm in 12 hours.\nThe agency offers real-time weather forecasts online for those wishing to monitor conditions as they develop. 112 Emergency Service, which has activated the Severity Index 1 (IG1) of the Meteobal Plan for rain and storms, reminds residents to follow safety recommendations, such as staying clear of flood-prone areas, avoiding basement and low areas, checking household drainage systems, keeping mobile phones charged, and calling 112 for emergencies.With these measures in place, Palma’s city council alongside the Balearic Goverment and the 112 Emergency Service hope to mitigate the impact of this storm, keeping residents informed and as safe as possible throughout the coming days.\nView all weather news .\nTags: DANA , Palma de Mallorca Share this story\nshare on Facebook share on Twitter share on WhatsApp share on LinkedIn share on Flipboard share on Email Sign up for personalised news Subscribe to our Euro Weekly News alerts to get the latest stories into your inbox!\nDaily Weekly By signing up, you will create a Euro Weekly News account if you don't already have one.

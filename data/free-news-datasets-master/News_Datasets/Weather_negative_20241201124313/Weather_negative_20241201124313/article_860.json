Storm Patty is brewing in the Caribbean - and there's a good chance it hits the US.\nAccuWeather meteorologists are monitoring a disturbance that could strengthen as it moves into the central or west where conditions are optimal for development.\nLead hurricane expert Alex DaSilva, said: 'Next week, most of the wind shear will shift to the north, and so it will basically create a pocket with high ocean temperatures, plenty of moisture and very low wind shear that will be favorable for tropical development.'\nThere are two potential paths this storm could take: one to the west and the other to the north.\nThe western track is unlikely to impact the US, but it could hit South Florida if the storm gains momentum in the next seven days.\n'Storms in the Caribbean usually move to the north or northeast in November. This means that residents and visitors from Florida (including the Gulf Coast) to the Carolinas will have to keep a close eye on development,' DaSilva said.\nThis has prompted the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to slightly increase the chances of a tropical disturbance forming in the next seven days.\nAccuWeather meteorologists say there is a 90 percent chance that hurricane will form in the Caribbean this weekend or early next week, potentially hitting the US\nDaSilva added: 'Even if a tropical storm forms and tracks into Mexico or Central America, changing steering winds can turn that storm to theâ€¦\nEllyn Lapointe",

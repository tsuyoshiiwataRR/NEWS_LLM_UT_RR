    "text": "FUKUOKA -- The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) is warning of landslides, flooding and rising river levels as Typhoon Kong-rey is expected to become an extratropical low-pressure system and bring heavy rain to west Japan through Nov. 2. The 21st typhoon of the year moved northwest over the sea south of Okinawa Prefecture and made landfall in Taiwan on Oct. 31. It is expected to move into the East China Sea through Nov. 2 and become an extratropical low-pressure system. Warm and moist air will flow toward the low-pressure system to form a front, which will create a risk of heavy rainfall in western Japan, mainly in the Kyushu region. According to the JMA, 24-hour precipitation levels up to 6 p.m. on Nov. 2 are predicted to be 200 millimeters in northern Kyushu and 120 mm in areas including the Chugoku and Kinki regions. The rainfall level in northern Kyushu may exceed that for all of November in a typical year. In western Japan, atmospheric conditions will become unstable through Nov. 2, and isolated downpours with thunderstorms are also expected.

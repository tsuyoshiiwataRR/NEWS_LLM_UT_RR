    "text": "Get ready for an unsettled weekend with showers and the potential for some severe weather November 1, 2024 - Evening forecast HASTINGS, Neb. (KSNB) - After a pleasant start to the month of November, reality will be setting in as we head into the first part of next week. And between now and then there will be a transition period. As with any transition there is usually an unsettled time. This weekend will be no exception as it will mark the dividing line between a warm fall season and a typical November weather weather pattern. With that said, get ready for an unsettled weekend with showers and storms. Some of those storms potentially strong to severe later in the second half on the weekend. The weather looks quiet with a gradual increase in clouds from the south later tonight. Lows will dip into the 30s and 40s with the warmest temperatures in North Central Kansas. A weak disturbance will lift northeast into the area tomorrow, increasing the chance of rain and isolated thunder as the day goes on. Chances will be greatest in the east and lowest to the west. Winds will be slightly breezy out of the southeast, increasing low-level moisture as the day goes on. Despite the increase in clouds, temperatures will still manage to get to the upper 50s and lower 60s for most. A chance of showers and thunderstorms will continue Saturday night. It’ll remain quite mild, thanks to the clouds and low-level moisture. Lows will remain in the upper 40s and low to mid 50s. It’ll actually be a bit milder on Sunday, despite the continued off and on chance of showers and thunderstorms. High temperatures will range from the upper 50s northwest to the lower 70s south. With enough instability, there is an outside chance of severe weather Sunday evening as a cold front slides southeast. While I don’t anticipated a large amount of severe weather, some isolated large hail and severe gusts can’t be ruled out. The cold front will push southeastward, bringing chillier air on Monday. Highs on Monday will mostly range from the upper 40s northwest to the upper 50s southeast. Some rain will continue, but the first area to dry out will be the northwest. We’ll then see the rain move on out Monday night. Tuesday should be a decent day for election day with a decent amount of sun. Highs will mostly be in the mid to upper 50s. Clouds will start to move in Wednesday and so will cooler temperatures. We’ll see highs back down in the 40s and 50s on Wednesday. There’s a lot of uncertainty with timing of moisture, but active weather could return for a time between Thursday and next weekend. This could be mostly rain, but it’s not out of the question for some wintry weather for some. But that will certain depend on timing, which is too difficult to predict this far out.

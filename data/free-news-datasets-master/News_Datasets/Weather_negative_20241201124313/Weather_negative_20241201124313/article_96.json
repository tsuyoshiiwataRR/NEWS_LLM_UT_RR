    "text": "A fantastic start to November, but heavy rain moves in for the weekend.\nWe are First Warning you that we have a series of soaking rains in the forecast that begin this weekend. But before we get there, we have a wonderful Friday to enjoy. The morning will have a bite with lows in the upper 30s, but bright blue skies and light northwest breezes will make for an enjoyable fall afternoon. Highs will be typical for this time of year, topping out in the low 60s.\nPlans outside Saturday may be OK for a good chunk of the day. Computer forecasts continue to bicker over the timing of the onset of the rain, with a minority bringing some rain as early as Saturday afternoon. But the bulk of our weather charts point to Saturday evening being the start of the rain. This will likely be heavy at times Saturday night and into Sunday. Sunday morning and the first half of the afternoon are likely quite wet, though we may catch a break by mid-late day Sunday. Highs through the weekend will be in the 60s.\nSo that’s round #1 of rain, with round #2 coming in Sunday night or Monday morning. This will make much of Monday wet, and potentially stormy. There is a chance for strong to severe storms. The timing for rain does include the Chiefs return to Arrowhead, so it would be wise to prepare for a wet and chilly tailgate and game. There is time for this to change, but the forecast has consistently looked wet for this time frame.\nRain likely comes to an end Tuesday morning or afternoon. The rain totals from Saturday through Tuesday could be impressive, with widespread 2-5″ possible, and even pockets of a half-foot not out of the question. At this point, it looks like the heaviest rain will be south and east of the Kansas City metro, with much lighter rain totals for northwest Missouri and northeast Kansas.\nCopyright 2024 KCTV.

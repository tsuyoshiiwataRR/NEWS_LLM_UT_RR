Any fires that develop may quickly get out of control and become difficult to contain.\nThe NWS says there is a high risk of rapidly spreading wildfires and recommends residents do not do any outdoor burning until the warning is lifted.\nWinds are moving west at 10 to 15 mph with gusts up to 30 mph and relative humidity will be as low as 25%. Temperatures are predicted to remain in the upper 70s.\nThe warning comes after a series of brush and woods fires across the county in an October that only recorded 0.04 inches of rain in Lancaster County, the second driest on record according to the Millersville Weather Information Center.\nLancaster County is in a moderate drought as of last week per the U.S. Drought Monitor, and some neighboring counties like Berks and Chester have entered a severe drought. The Red Flag warning has been issued for 20 counties in south-central PA.\nFor more information, the National Weather Service suggests visiting the website for Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources at dcnr.pa.gov .\nNewsletter Success!

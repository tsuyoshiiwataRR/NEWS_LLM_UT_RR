    "text": "Ukrainians warned about possible power outages due to cold weather: when schedules will return. In Ukraine, electricity might be turned off again according to the schedule due to worsening weather conditions. This was stated by a member of the supervisory board of \"Centrenergo\" Volodymyr Velychko. According to him, weather forecasters predict a drop in temperature from next week, which will require the application of more significant measures to balance the energy system. If unsuccessful in this matter, it will be necessary to introduce power outage schedules. The peak electricity consumption has already shifted to 19:10 due to the temperature drop. Velychko also emphasized the possible increase in electricity prices due to increased consumption in Europe and the decrease in the share of renewable energy sources. Currently, \"Centrenergo\" is continuing repair work at its own power plants to provide an additional capacity of almost 1 GW. However, the chairman of the company's supervisory board and the general director refuted Velychko's statement and noted that the determination of outage schedules is the competence of NEC \"Ukrenergo\", and Velychko's opinion does not reflect the company's position. The situation in the energy system is currently stable. Also, we remind you: Lithuania will dismantle power lines connecting it with Russia and Belarus.

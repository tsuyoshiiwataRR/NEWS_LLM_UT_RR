    "text": "We show you our most important and recent visitors news details Typhoon Kong-rey bashes Taiwan, the largest storm to hit island since 1996 in the following article Hind Al Soulia - Riyadh - TAIPEI — Heavy rains and high winds lashed Taiwan on Thursday as the largest storm to hit the island in nearly three decades made landfall along its southeast coast, killing at least one person and injuring dozens. Typhoon Kong-rey packed winds approaching 200 kilometers per hour (125 mph), equivalent to a Category 3 Atlantic hurricane, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), as it made landfall in Taitung county on Thursday afternoon. Kong-rey’s radius of maximum wind – how far the strongest winds are from its center – measured 320 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) on Wednesday evening, making it the largest storm to hit Taiwan since Typhoon Herb in 1996, said Chang Chun-yao, a forecaster with the island’s Central Weather Administration (CWA). At least two were killed and more than 500 storm-related injuries were reported, according to Taiwan’s Central Emergency Operations Center (CEOC) A 56-year-old woman was killed by a falling tree while traveling by car in the central county of Nantou, and a 48-year-old man died on Thursday night after he was hit by an electric pole that fell during the typhoon in Taipei. Ahead of the powerful storm, local authorities ordered offices and schools to temporarily close, while Taiwan suspended trading on its stock market. Taiwan generally has a strong track record of responding to major typhoons, though remote villages in more mountainous regions can be particularly vulnerable to landslides. Taiwan’s military put more than 34,000 soldiers on standby to assist with rescue efforts and over 8,600 people had been evacuated from high-risk areas on Wednesday, the CEOC said. More than 500 flights, including 300 international journeys, have been canceled, and all ferry services to Taiwan’s outlying islands have been suspended, according to Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration. High-speed rail services are operating at limited capacity, according to the rail operator, while the Taipei metro said it had suspended services on open-air sections. Images from Taiwan’s official Central News Agency and social media showed ferocious waves slamming into the coast of Taitung county, while parts of neighboring Hualien county were submerged in floodwaters. Toppled road signs and traffic lights were also seen across Taiwan, social media images showed. Kong-rey rapidly intensified to reach super typhoon strength on Wednesday as it barreled toward Taiwan after bashing the Philippines. Though the storm weakened slightly ahead of making direct landfall in Taiwan, has unleashed intense downpours, bringing flash flooding, storm surges and the risk of landslides. The heaviest rainfall was expected across eastern Taiwan. Taiwan’s weather agency on Thursday issued an “extremely torrential” rainfall warning, its highest level, for parts of Yilan, Hualien, Taichung and Taitung counties along the east coast. The rest of eastern Taiwan and parts of the island’s north, including Taipei, are under a “torrential” rainfall warning, the second-highest level. Additional rainfall of over half a meter (20 inches) is still possible across parts of eastern Taiwan, which could lead to flash flooding and landslides, according to the CWA. Warmer oceans from the human-caused climate crisis are leading storms to intensify more rapidly, according to scientists. Kong-rey is the third typhoon to make landfall on Taiwan this year, after Krathon and Gaemi. Earlier this month, Typhoon Krathon killed four people as it brought particularly heavy rains to the south of the island. In recent days, northern parts of the Philippines’ main island of Luzon have been lashed by the outer bands of Kong-rey, known locally as Leon, as authorities ordered evacuations and warned of its impacts after already seeing devastation last week from Tropical Storm Trami, known as Kristine, which killed at least 130 people. After moving into the northern Taiwan Strait, the storm is forecast to head into the East China Sea and toward Japan. — CNN These were the details of the news Typhoon Kong-rey bashes Taiwan, the largest storm to hit island since 1996 for this day.

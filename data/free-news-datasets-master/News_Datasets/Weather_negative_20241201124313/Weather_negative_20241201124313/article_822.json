    "text": "Sudden rain brings traffic to standstill in Hyderabad Telangana Rachel Dammala 2 Nov 2024 1:03 AM IST x In the Kukatpally region, intense rainfall measurements were reported as well, with Allapur receiving 38.3 mm and Balaji Nagar recording 29.5 mm. (DC Image) Hyderabad : A brief but intense spell of rainfall on Friday evening caused significant waterlogging and traffic disruption across Hyderabad, particularly affecting the western parts of the city that comprise the hi-tech zone. With rainfall measurements reaching up to 58.8 mm in some areas, roads turned into pools.\nData from the Telangana Development Planning Society revealed that Madhapur, located in the Serilingampally zone, experienced the highest rainfall at 58.8 mm, closely followed by Gachibowli with 56.8 mm. Chandanagar, another area in the same circle, recorded 41.8 mm, while Lingampally received 38.5 mm. These localities, popular for tech hubs and residential complexes, bore the brunt of the sudden downpour, with traffic slowing to a crawl due to the inundated roads. In the Kukatpally region, intense rainfall measurements were reported as well, with Allapur receiving 38.3 mm and Balaji Nagar recording 29.5 mm. The unexpected rainstorm created massive traffic snarls in these areas, with vehicles slowly inching forward amidst deep water. Other notable areas that experienced heavy rainfall included the urban health centre in Hafeezpet, with 31.5 mm and Miyapur community hall at 27.5 mm. Further north, Kukatpally recorded 38 mm, while the suburbs of Kompally and Nizampet also received considerable showers, contributing to waterlogged streets and hampering daily commutes. Waterlogging irked many with netizens taking to X to complain about how a short shower created ponds in the tech hub of the city. Many commuters and residents found themselves cautiously navigating the waterlogged streets. In response, Cyberabad Traffic Police personnel were observed opening manholes in certain areas to facilitate the drainage of stagnant water. A motorist, who headed returned to his residence to work from home in view of the traffic jam, said he took nearly 15 minutes to reach a U-turn. The heavy rainfall also affected various neighbourhoods, including Alwal, Jeedimetla and Bachupally, where measurements ranged from moderate to light. In addition, parts of the city like Jubilee Hills and Panjagutta saw rainfall of about 14 mm and 13.8 mm respectively, causing minor waterlogging but bringing some relief from the dayâ€™s sweltering heat. This unseasonal rain led to significant slowdowns in traffic across several busy intersections, particularly in Lingampally, Kondapur, Gachibowli, and Madhapur. The Telangana weather department has since issued a yellow alert across the state, advising citizens to brace for potential thunderstorms and lightning over the weekend. Several parts of Telangana witnessed heavy rainfall on Friday, with intense downpours leading to waterlogging and traffic disruptions across the region. Areas such as Munigadapa in Siddipet district saw substantial rain, measuring 55.5 mm, while Veernapalli in Rajanna Sircilla district recorded 48.0 mm. In Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district, Mothakondur experienced 45.8 mm of rainfall, Shankarapet in Medak district 38.5 mm. The downpour has prompted authorities to issue warnings and advisories, cautioning residents to be prepared for potential thunderstorms and further rainfall in the coming days.\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )",

    "text": "NORTH TEXAS â€“ Saturday, we're still expecting very isolated activity through the afternoon, with storms gradually picking up to our west and northwest late Saturday. A few storms could be strong.\nWe'll see more widespread shower and thunderstorm coverage in the afternoon on Sunday, also with a severe threat. All weekend storms will also have the potential for heavy rainfall and some localized flooding, so we'll want to watch any spots where storms slow or train.\nSPC's Day 3 risk map for Sunday has parts of the DMA in the level 2/5 risk.\nSPC's Day 4 outlook has the entire DMA in a Level 2 risk, three days out. This is notable.\nLatest HRRR high-res guidance has a few storms in the eastern DMA popping up in the afternoon tomorrow. These could be briefly strong.\nFinally, late tomorrow evening into Sunday morning, the HRRR has more of a convective system congealing and hugging our northern counties. We'll want to watch this time period for some quick flooding, if this does indeed pan-out.\nI'll share more for Sunday and Monday on Saturday afternoon, when more data is available and in better agreement.\nUntil then, have a great Friday evening and start to your weekend!\nMore from CBS News Rainy weekend ahead for North Texas; weather alerts in effect through Monday Storms move east of DFW, leaving cooler temperatures for Halloween Weekend storm threat looms over North Texas Clear Halloween skies to give way to stormy days ahead in North Texas Kay Granger, trailblazing North Texas congresswoman, to leave strong legacy In: Weather Forecast First Alert Weather North Texas",

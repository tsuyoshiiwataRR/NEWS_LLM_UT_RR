    "text": "The terrible flood that is bringing the Valencia area to its knees is destined to also affect the Valencian Community GP, which has long been the traditional closing of the world championship on the Ricardo Tormo circuit . However, the race on November 17th, which will follow next weekend’s in Sepang and which will decide the world championship challenge between <a href=\"https://www.archyworldys.com/motogp-test-day-3-bagnaia-flies-ahead-of-martin-bastianini-3rd-marquez-is-6th/\" title=\"MotoGP test day 3, <a href=\"https://www.archyworldys.com/motogp-test-day-3-bagnaia-flies-ahead-of-martin-bastianini-3rd-marquez-is-6th/\" title=\"MotoGP test day 3, Bagnaia flies ahead of Martin . Bastianini 3rd, Marquez is 6th”>Bagnaia flies ahead of Martin . Bastianini 3rd, Marquez is 6th”>Bagnaia and Martin, is inevitably at risk. The circuit, according to what its director Nicolas Collado reported to the Spanish media, is in order: “The structures of the Valencia circuit have not suffered any damage, the track is 100% in order. There were no injuries among the workers and everyone is well. I think this is the most important thing.”\nWinning is no longer enough for Bagnaia: for the World Cup he needs an ally\nby Massimo Calandri\nOctober 28, 2024\nHowever, the roads are in disaster: “The ownership is doing a damage calculation and is working in view of the last race. A project is being prepared to reconstruct an access road within a week, in order to allow the influx of the public and professionals”. In short, doubts remain, even if the possibility of the World Championship being awarded to Sepang must be ruled out. So there are two solutions left. Being able to restore the area surrounding the Ricardo Tormo circuit or – and it seems the most probable hypothesis – moving the last Grand Prix to another Spanish circuit located in an area not affected by the floods. For logistical reasons, the Portuguese one in Portimao would also seem suitable for replacement.\n#MotoGP #Valencia #flood #final #challenge #Bagnaia #Martin #risk #Portimao #hypothesis\n–",

    "text": "According to the IMD, 15.1mm rainfall is the long period average for the month of October. By: Express News Service New Delhi | November 1, 2024 11:48 IST 2 min read As per IMD records from 1901, the highest-ever average day temperature for October was recorded in 1951 at 36.2 degrees Celsius. The highest-ever average night temperature was 22.3 degrees Celsius in 1915 and 1951. This year October ended without its typical chill. A lookback at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) data from 1901 reveal that, this year Delhi reported the warmest October in 73 years.\nThe monthly maximum and minimum averages over Safdarjung were recorded as 35.1 degrees Celsius and 21.2 degrees Celsius respectively. This is the fourth highest monthly day temperature and the sixth highest monthly night temperature in October recorded since 1901.\nAs per IMD records from 1901, the highest-ever average day temperature for October was recorded in 1951 at 36.2 degrees Celsius. The highest-ever average night temperature was 22.3 degrees Celsius in 1915 and 1951.\nAdvertisement The other warm years were in 1907 with the average maximum settling at 35.5 degrees Celsius.\nOctober 1930 and 1938 recorded an average maximum temperature at 35 degree Celsius. In 1941 a record-breaking average maximum of 35.8 degree Celsius was reported. Further in a decade, this record was again broken with the year 1951 reporting an even higher monthly maximum temperature at 36.2 degree Celsius.\nThe nights were also warm for the year as a monthly minimum of 22.3 degrees Celsius (highest in 1901-2024) were recorded in October 1951. Earlier in October 1915 similar night time temperatures had been observed and the average minimum settled at 22.3 degrees Celsius.\nThe only other years with monthly minimum temperature close to this were observed in 1927 and 1928 at 21.5 degree Celsius and 22.1 degreesCelsius.\nAdvertisement No rainy day: IMD According to the IMD, 15.1mm rainfall is the long period average for the month of October. However, there have been no rainy days observed in Delhi so far, which has also contributed to the above-normal temperatures. Rainy days additionally help in dispersal of pollutants.\nWith the onset of winter, the air quality starts to worsen in the capital. Meteorological conditions such as high temperatures can also help aid dispersal of pollutants.",

    "text": "The cold drop that has devastated Valencia, leaving a hundred dead, moved strongly this Thursday morning to the province of Castellón, where up to 213 liters per square meter have fallen in towns such as Tírig and ravines have overflowed. Although the territory has spent hours on red alert, the warning has already been lowered to yellow.\nThe danger warnings began in the early morning, when the AEMET announced on Twitter that the rainfall could be intense and from then on they were updated until the red alert arrived. The mobile notification, managed by the regional executive, sounded mid-morning, at 11:50 a.m. It asked citizens not to leave home and, if they had already done so (at the time work centers and many schools were already full), to take refuge “in high areas.” AEMET has lowered the alert to yellow from 2:06 p.m.\nThe mobile phone warning also insists that people not travel on the roads, since there are torrents of water flowing towards the plain in the Torreblanca and Cabanes area. The most affected areas are l’Alt Maestrat, Baix Maestrat, els Ports and Plana Alta. Currently, the CV-137 from Càlig to Sant Jordi is closed; CV-200 in the section that connects Aín with Almedíjar; CV-130 Albocàsser-Sant Mateu through Tírig; CV-154 Endoménech-La Serratella Tower; CV-1486 between the terms of Cabanes and Oropesa; CV-148 in Borseral; and CV-15 in La Pelejaneta (Vall d’Alba).\nIt has rained a lot in the headwaters of boulevards, ravines and rivers such as Cervera, Coves, Cèrvol and Sènia, and these can experience sudden and important floods of flow while on the coast it does not rain, but it can receive all these overflows, especially Benicarló, and the Experts warn that the Valencia pattern may be repeated, which has left municipalities flooded and a hundred dead. Between Benicarló and Càlig, where a waterspout has fallen and the Cervera boulevard has overflowed, there are workers trapped in a factory and a telecommunications tower has also fallen, in addition to the roads being cut off.\nSome town councils had announced the suspension of classes this morning, such as Peníscola, Torreblanca, Vall d’Alba, Vila-real, Orpesa or Segorbe, but the consensual decision and the alert not to move has come when work centers and educational centers They were already full. It is the responsibility of the town councils to suspend classes in children’s, primary and secondary schools, although the Ministry can urge them to do so, which has not happened. The Jaume I University of Castelló has suspended its classes this morning, when some of the students were already on their way.\nThe decision to massively alert the population has been taken at Cecopi, the Integrated Operational Coordination Center that has assumed command of the situation, where all administrations are represented and where this morning the visit of the President of the Government and by Alberto Núñez Feijóo.\nFirefighters from the Castellón Provincial Consortium have rescued a person in the Vilafamés area affected by the torrential rains that the Castellón province recorded this Thursday and are working to rescue another person who is in a field house in Sant Mateu.\nWhile attempts are being made to contain the damage in the province of Castellón, work continues to rescue bodies in Valencia and hundreds of residents throughout the area affected by the floods, such as Catarroja or Paiporta, are still without basic supplies such as water, food or medicine.\n#Generalitat #alerts #citizens #Castellón #leave #home #refuge #high #areas",

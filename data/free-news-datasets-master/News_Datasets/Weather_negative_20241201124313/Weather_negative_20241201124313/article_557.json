    "text": "On Friday at 9:18 a.m. the National Weather Service issued a red flag warning valid for Friday between noon and 7 p.m. for Western Chester, Eastern Chester, Western Montgomery, Eastern Montgomery, Upper Bucks and Lower Bucks as well as Carbon, Monroe, Berks, Lehigh, Northampton, Delaware and Philadelphia counties.\nWinds are forecasted to be west 10 to 20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph and relative humidity as low as 27 percent.\n\"Any fire that develops will catch and spread quickly. Outdoor burning is not recommended,\" adds the weather service.\nWhat does a red flag warning indicate? A red flag warning indicates that either extreme fire weather conditions are currently happening or will happen soon, as per the weather service. Warm temperatures, very low humidities, and stronger winds are expected to combine to produce an increased risk of fire to spread rapidly.\nSo, what are the recommended measures to take during a red flag warning? During a red flag warning, it is crucial to exercise extreme caution and be prepared to take immediate action in case a fire starts. The weather service offers these steps you can take to lower the risk of fires igniting and ensure your safety:\n1. Bolster burn barrel safety:\nIn areas where controlled burning is sanctioned, make certain that burn barrels sport a weighty metal cover, equipped with holes no larger than 3/4 of an inch. 2. Mindful disposal of smoking materials:\nNever discard lit cigarette butts outside, and avoid tossing cigarettes or matches from a moving vehicle. These seemingly small actions can lead to dry grass ignition, potentially sparking a wildfire. 3. Prudent fire extinguishing practices:\nTo safeguard against accidental fires, diligently extinguish all outdoor fires. Drown them with an ample amount of water and stir to confirm that everything is cold to the touch. Submerge charcoal in water until it's thoroughly cooled. Never dispose of live charcoal on the ground. 4. Never desert a blaze:\nAvoid leaving any fire unattended. Even sparks or embers carried by the wind can ignite nearby leaves or grass, triggering a fire that spreads rapidly. Understanding the gravity of a red flag warning and adhering to these precautions is pivotal in mitigating the risk of wildfires during these perilous conditions. Prioritize safety, stay well-informed, and act responsibly to safeguard lives and property.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

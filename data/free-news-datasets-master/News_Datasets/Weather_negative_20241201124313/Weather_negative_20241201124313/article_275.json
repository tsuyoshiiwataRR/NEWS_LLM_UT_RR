    "text": "Andrew Follett\nA massive winter snowstorm could leave 75 million Americans across the Eastern Seaboard covered by record levels of snowfall Friday afternoon, according to weather experts.\n“By Sunday morning, nearly one-quarter of the U.S. population (about 75 million people) could get 6 inches or more of snow,” Dr. Roy Spencer, a climatologist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, wrote on his blog. “Consistent with the weather model forecasts for the last several of days… the area around Washington D.C. would be hardest hit, with about 2 feet of snow expected.”\n“New York City could see 16 to 20 inches, and nor’easter type conditions are expected for coastal areas from the Delmarva peninsula northward, with winds gusting over 50 mph,” Spencer added.\nThe Weather Channel has already issued a blizzard alert for the winter storm named Jonas. The National Weather Service says there’s a 70 percent chance of 12 inches of snow for the Washington D.C. area by Saturday. The Eastern Seaboard could see one to two feet of snow. Roads are expected to become impassable and many businesses plan to shut down. Travel is expected to be extremely hazardous.\nALERT:\n[#Blizzard]Watch issued – Winter Storm[#Jonas]may bring 12+ in. of[#snow]. Get the details.[#VAwx][#MDwx][#DCwx]— The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel)\n[January 20, 2016]\n“Potential life-threatening conditions [are] expected Friday night into Saturday night,” states a National Weather Service winter weather advisory. “Travel is expected to be severely limited if not impossible during the height of the storm Friday night and Saturday.”",

    "text": "Halloween Snowfall Downs Power Lines, Starts Plymouth Home on Fire Halloween was particularly unusual this year, and for one Plymouth family, heartbreaking. The snow totals varied locally, but northwest Plymouth got hit the hardest with more than four inches of snowfall reported to the National Weather Service. The heavy snow took down tree branches, impacting power lines. In one case, it impacted a home. “It’s hard to describe how I feel because I always try to plan for things, and you can’t plan for this,” said [Peji Ameli](https://dwellings.kw.com/meet-the-team) of Plymouth. Ameli’s home was destroyed in a fire Thursday afternoon. Investigators say the heavy snow caused a large tree branch to collapse. That branch then fell on some power lines and sparked a fire that caused extensive damage to most of the house. Ameli, his wife, and two kids will stay with family until they find a more stable housing solution. Despite the tragedy, Ameli remains upbeat, considering what could have happened. “I see a home full of memories of people I love and that I care for, and they’re all okay,” he said. Ameli says his family has lived in the home for the last 18 years, and he has every intention of rebuilding. The process could take up to a year.

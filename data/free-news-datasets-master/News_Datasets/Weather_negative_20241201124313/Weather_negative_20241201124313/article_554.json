    "text": "A red flag warning is in effect for all of Massachusetts Friday due to ‚Äúsevere drought‚Äù condition in parts of the state, according to the National Weather Service and the US Drought Monitor.\n‚ÄúA Red Flag Warning means that critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now, or will shortly,‚Äù forecasters wrote in the warning that is in effect until 7 p.m. Friday. ‚ÄúAny fires that start may spread rapidly and become difficult to extinguish.‚Äù\nThe Drought Monitor reported Thursday that conditions have worsened and that eastern Massachusetts is now experiencing ‚Äúsevere drought,‚Äù the Globe reported. The severe drought area covers Boston and the rest of Suffolk County as well as parts of Essex, Middlesex, and Norfolk counties.\nThe rest of the state is experiencing moderate drought or ‚Äúabnormally dry‚Äù conditions, with the exception of southeastern Mass., including the Cape, which has received a substantial amount of rain over the past three months, according to the Monitor.\nAdvertisement\nFirefighters across the state have been battling brush fires for more than a week, according to state officials.\nAccording to forecasters at the weather service, only a ‚Äúsmattering of rain‚Äù is expected in eastern Massachusetts in the near future.\nHowever, there will be a noticeable drop in temperature starting later Friday that will be very apparent on Saturday and through the rest of the weekend, which is expected to be sunny and dry.\n‚ÄúA significant cool down is on the way for the weekend as high temperatures will drop 20+ degrees from Friday to Saturday!‚Äù forecasters posted on X. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get used to it, though, as another abnormally warm period arrives for the middle of next week.‚Äù\nA significant cool down is on the way for the weekend as high temperatures will drop 20+ degrees from Friday to Saturday!

    "text": "Fire weather alerts issued in Maryland\nFire weather alerts issued in Maryland\nRAIN AT THIS POINT. NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. KAI THAT IT’S BEAUTIFUL, RIGHT? TO BE OUT AND ABOUT AND ENJOY THIS GORGEOUS WEATHER. BUT YOU CAN SEE THINGS DRYING UP. AND WE’VE NOW HIT A MONTH, 30 DAYS OFFICIALLY WITHOUT ANY MEASURABLE RAIN. WE DID HAVE THOSE SPRINKLES MOVED THROUGH EARLIER TODAY, AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ON OUR RADAR RETURNS HERE. OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST 12 HOURS, FRONT MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH DID MANAGE TO AT LEAST TRIGGER A COUPLE DROPS OF RAIN, BUT LESS THAN 1/100 OF AN INCH. SO JUST A FEW DROPS. AND THAT MEANS IT’S GOING TO GO IN THE BOOKS AS JUST A TRACE, NOT MEASURABLE AMOUNTS OF RAIN. AS FAR AS AT LEAST 1/100 OF AN INCH OF RAIN. AND SO WITH NO MEASURABLE RAIN, THE STREAK NOW GOES. IT STARTED ON OCTOBER THE 3RD WITHOUT ANY RAIN IN THAT DAY THROUGH THE MONTH. THE REST OF OCTOBER, AND NOW INTO THE FIRST DAY OF NOVEMBER, I DON’T THINK WE’RE GOING TO GET ANY RAIN NOW. BETWEEN NOW AND MIDNIGHT. SO THAT WILL MAKE 30 CONSECUTIVE DAYS WITHOUT MEASURABLE RAIN. THE ALL TIME RECORD FOR BALTIMORE, INCLUDING THE DOWNTOWN LOCATION IN BWI. MARSHALL GOING BACK TO THE LATE 1800S, IS 32 DAYS FROM THE END OF SEPTEMBER THROUGH OCTOBER OF 1963, AND I THINK WITHOUT ANY RAIN TODAY, WE MAY TACK ON ANOTHER 5 OR 6 DAYS AND PUSH THIS MAYBE EVEN LONGER, AND SET THE RECORD FOR THE LONGEST STRETCH WITHOUT MEASURABLE RAIN. IT’S WARM OUTSIDE AFTER THE RAIN SHOWERS MOVE THROUGH. THE FRONT IS MOVING OFF THE COAST AND SOME COOLER WEATHER IS ON THE WAY. BUT FOR NOW IT’S WARM AND DRY AND THE WINDS ARE GUSTING TO 30. AND THAT MEANS THERE’S AN INCREASED RISK OF BRUSH FIRES, ESPECIALLY THROUGH SUNSET GOING INTO ABOUT 6 P.M. TONIGHT, BE VERY CAREFUL WITH ANYTHING THAT MIGHT CREATE A SPARK OR A FLAME. THINGS ARE SO TINDER DRY IT COULD EASILY CREATE A BRUSH FIRE. AND WITH THE GUSTY WINDS, THOSE BRUSH FIRES WOULD SPREAD. NOW THE FRONT IS GOING TO MOVE OFF THE COAST AS WE CONTINUE THROUGH THE EVENING. THAT WILL OPEN THE DOOR FOR MORE DRY WEATHER. THE NEXT FEW DAYS RIGHT THROUGH THE WEEKEND WILL BE DRY, BUT ALSO SOME COOLER TEMPERATURES COMING IN BEHIND THAT FRONT TOMORROW MORNING UP NEAR THE PENNSYLVANIA LINE. YOU MAY BE IN THE UPPER 30S MID 40S IN BALTIMORE, UPPER 40S DOWN TO THE LOWER EASTERN SHORE. AND TOMORROW WILL BE A NOTICEABLY COOLER DAY. EVEN WITH A LOT OF SUNSHINE, WE WON’T BE UP NEAR 80, WILL BE IN THE 50S AND LOW 60S FOR A GOOD PART OF THE AFTERNOON ON SATURDAY. SO THE FORECAST OVERNIGHT TONIGHT A LITTLE BIT COOLER DROPPING INTO THE 40S. WINDS GRADUALLY DYING DOWN A BIT. HIGH TEMPERATURES TOMORROW AROUND 63. A PARTLY CLOUDY DAY. AND THAT’S ABOUT NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. MORE SEASONAL TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE STATE SATURDAY AND AGAIN ON SUNDAY, WHICH SETS UP GOOD FOR RAVENS FOOTBALL. LOOKS LIKE KICKOFF TEMPERATURES WILL BE AROUND 59 AROUND 60 AT 4 P.M. ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON. DON’T FORGET THE CLOCKS GO BACK AT 2 A.M. SUNDAY MORNING. WE’RE GOING BACK TO STANDARD TIME. GET TO SLEEP AN EXTRA HOUR, BUT THE SUN IS GOING TO SET EARLIER IN THE AFTERNOON A\nAdvertisement\nFire weather alerts issued in Maryland\nChief Meteorologist Tom Tasselmyer explains how Maryland is seeing very dry conditions with 30 days without any measurable amount of rain.\nBALTIMORE —\nChief Meteorologist Tom Tasselmyer explains how Maryland is seeing very dry conditions with 30 days without any measurable amount of rain.\nAdvertisement",

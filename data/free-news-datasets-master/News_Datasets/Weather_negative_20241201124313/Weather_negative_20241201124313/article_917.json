    "text": "The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued alerts across several regions, predicting heavy rainfall for parts of South India and a notable dip in temperatures for North and East India in the coming days. Here’s a detailed look at the rainfall forecasts, temperature trends, and specific updates for Delhi/NCR.\nHeavy Rainfall Expected Across Southern India\n-\n2nd - 3rd November: Southern regions, particularly Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal, and Kerala, will continue experiencing heavy rainfall due to a cyclonic circulation over the Gulf of Mannar.\n-\nIsolated Heavy Rainfall: Additional heavy rainfall is expected in parts of Coastal Karnataka and South Interior Karnataka through November 3rd, with thunderstorms and lightning likely in isolated areas.\nRegion |\nForecast |\nDate |\nTamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal |\nHeavy rainfall |\n2nd - 3rd November |\n|\nHeavy to very heavy rainfall |\n2nd November |\nCoastal & South Interior Karnataka |\nIsolated heavy rainfall |\n2nd - 3rd November |\nTemperature Decline Expected in North & East India\nFrom November 3rd to 7th, temperatures are set to gradually drop by 2-3°C across North and East India, which could bring some relief from the ongoing above-normal conditions. In the past 24 hours, both maximum and minimum temperatures have dropped by 2-3°C across Northwest India but are still higher than the seasonal average by 2-6°C in several regions.\nRegion |\nTemperature Change |\nTimeframe |\nNorth & East India |\nGradual drop by 2-3°C |\n3rd - 7th November |\nNorthwest India |\nAbove normal by 2-6°C |\nObserved past 24 hours |\nCentral, Western, Eastern India |\nAbove normal by 2-5°C |\nObserved past 24 hours |\nDelhi/NCR Weather Forecast (2nd - 4th November)\n[Delhi/NCR](/news/tomatoes-at-60kg-in-delhi-ncr-starting-today-with-stalls-at-key-locations/) is likely to see clear skies over the coming days, with slight shifts in wind patterns and persistent smog and mist during early mornings and nights. As winter approaches, morning fog may start becoming more frequent.\nDate |\nWeather |\nWind Conditions |\nVisibility |\n02.11.2024 |\nClear sky |\nCalm in morning, Northeast at 8-12 kmph by afternoon, easing at night |\nSmog/mist in morning and night |\n03.11.2024 |\nClear sky |\nEast-Southeast, up to 10 kmph by afternoon |\nShallow fog/mist in morning |\n04.11.2024 |\nClear sky |\nSoutheast, up to 10 kmph by afternoon |\nShallow fog/mist in morning |\nTemperature Overview for Delhi/NCR: On November 1st, Delhi recorded maximum temperatures between 32-34°C and minimums around 15-20°C, staying above normal by 2-4°C.\nDelhi/NCR Temperatures (As of 1st November):\n-\nMaximum Temperature Range: 32-34°C\n-\nMinimum Temperature Range: 15-20°C\nWith clear skies but reduced morning visibility due to fog, Delhiites should be prepared for possible disruptions, particularly in early hours as smog and misty conditions linger.\nAs heavy rainfall is expected in parts of South India, residents in affected areas are urged to take precautionary measures to stay safe from potential waterlogging and disruptions. For those in North India, the anticipated temperature drop will likely be welcomed as a respite from warmer-than-usual autumn days. Meanwhile, Delhiites should be prepared for early morning fog and monitor air quality during the forecasted period. Stay tuned for further updates!",

    "text": "At a Glance\n- Severe weather will plague the central U.S. for the third consecutive day Monday.\n- Tornadoes, some possibly strong, wind damage and hail are threats.\n- A tornado watch is in effect for northeastern Texas and eastern Oklahoma.\n- Flooding is also a concern, even in drought areas.\n[Sign up for the Morning Brief email newsletter](https://weather.com/newsletter?cm_ven=dnt_NLacquisition_inarticle) to get weekday updates from The Weather Channel and our meteorologists.\nA line of storms is continuing to move through the central U.S. overnight with possible severe storms, tornadoes, hail and flash flooding. This comes on the heels of [destructive tornadoes in Oklahoma](https://weather.com/storms/tornado/news/2024-11-03-oklahoma-city-okc-severe-storms-tornado-damage) early Sunday morning.\nCurrent Activity\nBelow is a look at the latest radar for the region along with any active watches and/or warnings issued by the National Weather Service.\nSevere Weather Forecast\nThe Storm Prediction Center is warning of possible tornadoes, damaging winds and large hail. The remaining potential for severe weather overnight stretches from eastern Texas into central Illinois.\nEven though this rain is needed given the [widespread drought](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/), too much rain too quickly could cause flash flooding in many of the same areas at risk for severe weather. Areas from northwest Texas to northern Arkansas and southern Missouri have already picked up 2 to 7 inches of rain since last Friday.\nFlood watches have been issued for this threat by the National Weather Service from northern Texas into parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri and Kansas.\nFlash flood warnings have also been issued across northern Arkansas and southern Missouri, with rainfall totals as of noon since midnight nearing or passing 6 inches in some spots.\nIf traveling, be sure to never drive through any floodwaters.",

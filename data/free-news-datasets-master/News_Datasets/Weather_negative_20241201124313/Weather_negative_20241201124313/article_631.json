    "text": "Following record-breaking warm temperatures and extreme winds to close out October, Milwaukee is in for another week of wild weather. Near-constant rain, with periods of heavy rainfall and possible thunderstorms, is in the forecast from Saturday night through the end of the day Tuesday, said Milwaukee-Sullivan National Weather Service meteorologist Kevin Wagner. Things should be cool and dry for remaining Halloween festivities on Friday and Saturday before a system moving across the Plains into the Upper Great Lakes region brings the rain and warmer temperatures, Wagner said. Friday and Saturday are expected to be mostly sunny in Milwaukee, with afternoon highs of 48 and 55 degrees, respectively. Highs will be in the upper 50s to mid-60s Sunday through Tuesday. Precipitation chances in Milwaukee climb throughout Saturday night to over 50% by 1 a.m. Sunday. Chances of rain continue to rise throughout the morning to between 90% and 100% from 1 p.m. Sunday to noon Tuesday. Periods of heavy rainfall should be expected, with daily totals in some areas between 1 and 1.5 inches, Wagner said. According to the NWS forecast, there is a possibility of thunderstorms from late Sunday night to noon Tuesday. Chances are highest between 7 p.m. on Monday and midnight on Tuesday. Rain remains likely through midnight Wednesday before a cold front moves in, calming the system and bringing cooler temperatures. Wednesday is expected to be sunny with a high of around 55 degrees.",

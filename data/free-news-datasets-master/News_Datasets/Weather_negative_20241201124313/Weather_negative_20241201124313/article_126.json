    "text": "1st November 2024 – (Taipei) Typhoon Kong-rey made landfall on Taiwan’s east coast on 31st October, becoming the largest storm to strike the island in nearly 30 years. With a wind radius reaching 320 kilometres and maximum wind speeds of 53 metres per second—equivalent to a force 16 gale—the typhoon has wreaked havoc, resulting in the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the closure of financial markets.\nThe storm, which initially reached super typhoon strength, has since weakened slightly but remains a formidable force, equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane with gusts exceeding 250 kph. Taiwan’s Central Weather Administration reported that the typhoon’s impact was felt across the island, with significant rainfall and strong winds affecting nearly all areas.\nAs the storm approached, power outages were reported, leaving nearly half a million households without electricity. One fatality was confirmed when a truck struck a fallen tree in central Taiwan. The typhoon’s size has been noted as the largest to hit the island since 1996, prompting President Lai Ching-te to urge citizens to avoid risky behaviours during the storm.\nAs Kong-rey moved inland, it forced numerous flights to divert. At least four China Airlines flights were redirected to Hong Kong, with passengers reporting harrowing experiences as they attempted to land in turbulent conditions. One particularly alarming incident involved a StarLux Airlines flight that nearly collided with the runway during a challenging landing attempt, causing panic among passengers.\nThe typhoon has also disrupted international travel, with Singapore Airlines and its low-cost subsidiary Scoot announcing multiple flight cancellations. One Singapore Airlines flight, originally bound for Taipei, was diverted to Hong Kong, safely landing at around 5.10pm local time. The airline provided affected passengers with meals and accommodation arrangements as they worked to rebook flights.\nOne particularly alarming incident involved a StarLux Airlines flight that nearly collided with the runway during a challenging landing attempt, causing panic among passengers.",

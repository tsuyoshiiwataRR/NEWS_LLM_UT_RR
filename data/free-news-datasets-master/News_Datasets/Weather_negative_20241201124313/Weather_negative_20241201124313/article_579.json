    "text": "- By [Sahelee Rakshit](/authors/sahelee-rakshit) - Published: Fri, 01 Nov 2024 06:52 PM (IST) - Source:JND Weather News: A deep atmospheric circulation over the Gulf of Mannar has prompted the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to issue a warning of heavy rainfall for Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and the surrounding areas. According to Soma Sen Roy, an IMD scientist, this system is predicted to provide significant rainfall to southern India on Friday. “Yesterday, 11 cm of rainfall was recorded in Tamil Nadu, 6-7 cm in Kerala, and 9 cm along coastal Karnataka. Heavy to very heavy rainfall, between 12-20 cm, is anticipated in interior Kerala and south interior Tamil Nadu,” Roy stated, as reported by ANI. Heavy rains may cause waterlogging, which might impede transportation and cause minor damage to weaker structures, according to the IMD's regional office. The agency urges citizens to stay indoors, stay away from travel if at all possible, and make sure that pets and kids are kept indoors. To avoid mishaps, any loose objects, such as wood or debris, should be secured. Additionally, because metal objects may carry electricity during thunderstorms, the IMD cautioned anybody outside to stay away from trees, fences, utility lines, and metal buildings. Additionally, to reduce the chance of lightning-related mishaps, individuals should avoid windows, doors, and corded electrical gadgets.

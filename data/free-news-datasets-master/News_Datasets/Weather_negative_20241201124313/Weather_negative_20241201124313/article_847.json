    "text": "Elevated Fire Danger Today, Nov. 1\nThe National Weather Service has issued a special weather statement for Farifax County. There is an Elevated Fire Danger alert for parts of Northern Virginia, including Fairfax County, for Friday, Nov. 1.\nElevated potential for the rapid spread of fire is expected this afternoon to early evening due to the combination of dry conditions and gusty winds. Relative humidity values drop to around 25 to 35 percent, along with sustained northwesterly around 15 mph and gusts to 20 to 30 mph. This will result in the rapid drying of fine fuels like grass, leaves and small shrubs.\n- You are urged to exercise caution if handling open flames or equipment that create sparks.\n- Dispose of cigarette butts, matches and other flammable items in appropriate containers.\n- Keep vehicles off of dry grass and obey local burn bans. Most dry grasses, dead leaves and other tree litter could easily ignite and spread a fire quickly.\nDiscover more from Fairfax County Emergency Information\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.",

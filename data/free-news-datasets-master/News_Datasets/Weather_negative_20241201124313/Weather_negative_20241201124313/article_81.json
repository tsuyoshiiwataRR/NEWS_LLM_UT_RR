    "text": "MONTANA - Today, temperatures were in the 30s to the west, the 40s in central Montana, and in the 50s to the east. Radar showed rain and snow, mainly across western Montana. Winds were light to the west but were gustier in central and eastern areas. Trick or treaters may get doused with a little rain this evening from the Missoula area to Bozeman. However, it should be dry in central and northeast areas. A cold front has brought colder weather to western Montana along with some rain and snow, which will end early tonight. Sunny and mild skies are forecasted to return to central and east Montana on Friday with cloudy skies to west. Another storm system will bring rain and snow this weekend to Missoula and Kalispell to the Helena, Butte and Bozeman areas. A winter weather advisory will be in place through Friday for the mountains of Madison and Gallatin Counties at elevations above 6000 feet, where one to nine inches of snow are possible. Lows tonight will range in the upper 10s and 20s with highs tomorrow ranging in the mid 40s to mid 50s. Mild temperatures are expected this weekend in central and eastern areas, but it will be a bit chilly in the west. Highs will range from the 40s to the west and into the 50s to the east.",

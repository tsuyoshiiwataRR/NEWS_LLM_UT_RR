    "text": "As if winter in the UK wasn’t cold and grey enough, there’s a weather phenomenon on its way to make the country even chillier. Experts predict that a ‘weak La Niña’ will arrive in a matter of weeks.\nLa Niña is when sea temperatures are cooler than average in the equatorial Pacific creating cooler, drier weather. It has knock-on effects for the rest of the world and is often linked to natural disasters like flooding or drought.\nFor Britain, La Ni ñ a brings bad tidings. It increases the likelihood of a colder early winter and milder temperatures at the end of the season with higher potential for storms and heavy rainfall. The Met Office says that it also increases the chances of westerly winds.\nAccording to predictions by the World Meteorological Organisation, there’s a 55 percent chance of La Niña conditions brewing between September and November and 60 percent from October 2024 to February 2025.\nSo, prepare to hibernate – winter is coming!\nLearn to love winter with Time Out Embrace the chill with our pick of the best stuff to do in London in winter .

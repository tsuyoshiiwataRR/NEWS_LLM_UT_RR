    "text": "Photo Unsplash Newsroom\n01 NOVEMBER 2024 - 08:21 Good morning, Cyprus! As we roll into Friday and kick off the weekend, don’t put away the umbrella just yet. A low-pressure system is sweeping in from the southwest, bringing along some strong northeastern winds that will stick around until tomorrow afternoon.\nToday, expect partly to mostly cloudy skies with a chance of scattered showers and even isolated thunderstorms, particularly around the mountains, inland areas, and western parts of the island later in the day. Winds will be brisk, ranging from 4 to 5 on the Beaufort scale, stirring up some choppy seas. Temperatures are set to reach about 27°C across the coast and inland, while the mountain regions will stay cooler at around 17°C.\nTonight, skies will start to clear up, though a few clouds may linger, especially along the coast, possibly bringing a stray shower. Winds will ease up a bit, but coastal areas may still feel a steady breeze at times. Temperatures will dip to 15°C inland, with coastal areas slightly warmer at around 18-20°C, while the mountains cool down to 10°C.\nLooking ahead, both Saturday and Sunday are likely to bring localized showers and isolated thunderstorms, with the chance of hail during some storms. Monday looks similar, with showers likely in the afternoon. Temperatures will stay warm for now, but expect a slight drop by Monday, bringing things closer to seasonal norms.\nEnjoy the weekend, stay safe, and keep an eye on those clouds!\nLawmakers weigh extended traffic fine deadlines and countdown timers Halloween haunt: Supreme Court digs into Cyprus black magic case Ακολουθήστε το KNEWS\nστο Google News TAGS Cyprus | weather",

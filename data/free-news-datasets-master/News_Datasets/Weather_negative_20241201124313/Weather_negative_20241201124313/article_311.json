It still looked like there was a strong wind!‚Äô he wrote on X.\nSeveral weather warnings are in force for eastern parts of the state, including a severe thunderstorm warning for parts of Gympie, the Sunshine Coast and Moreton Bay regions.\nResidents are told to expect damaging winds and hailstones up to 3 inches wide.\n‚ÄúA moist and unstable air mass combined with a south-easterly wind shift moving along the coast is leading to the development of severe thunderstorms in south-east Queensland,‚Äù the Bureau of Meteorology said.\n‚ÄúSevere thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds and large hailstones across parts of the Wide Bay, Burnett and Southeast Coast districts over the next few hours.‚Äù\nThe BOM said hailstones as large as 3 inches in diameter were spotted at Flagstone, in Logan, just after 3pm on Friday.\nThere‚Äôs more to come\nTwister on the Brisbane River!!! üå™Ô∏è\nAs far as I can tell, this is not a full-fledged tornado, but more likely a ‚Äúgustnado‚Äù which is a more transient feature on the leading edge of the storm.\nStill, it looked like there was a strong wind in it!\nCredit: Hayden Oakley pic.twitter.com/SD6V8GoU5T\n‚Äî Tony Auden (@TonyAuden) November 1, 2024\nThe gust, a small twister different from that of a tornado, was spotted on the Brisbane River at Kangaroo Point on Friday afternoon amid dangerous winds and heavy rain.\nHeavy thunderstorms hit Brisbane on Friday\nHuge hailstones lashed parts of south-east Queensland on Friday\nShare or comment on this article: ‚ÄòMini tornado‚Äô rips across Brisbane River as wild thunderstorms and huge hail hit Queensland",

    "text": "On Friday at 3:25 p.m. the National Weather Service issued a red flag warning in effect until 7 p.m. for Northern Worcester and Southern Worcester as well as Franklin, Middlesex, Essex, Hampshire, Hampden, Norfolk, Suffolk, Bristol, Plymouth, Barnstable, Dukes and Nantucket counties. Winds are forecasted to be west 10 to 20 mph with gusts up to 35 mph and relative humidity as low as 41 percent. \"Any fire that develops will catch and spread quickly. Outdoor burning is not recommended,\" says the weather service. What does a red flag warning indicate? A red flag warning signifies that either extreme fire weather conditions are currently in effect or will be shortly, as stated by the weather service. Warm temperatures, very low humidities, and stronger winds are expected to combine to produce an increased risk of fire to spread rapidly. So, what should you do under a red flag warning? A red flag warning demands vigilance and immediate readiness to respond to potential fires. The weather service provides these vital guidelines to minimize fire hazards and ensure your safety: 1. Bolster burn barrel safety: - In areas where controlled burning is sanctioned, make certain that burn barrels sport a weighty metal cover, equipped with holes no larger than 3/4 of an inch. 2. Mindful disposal of smoking materials: - Steer clear of haphazardly discarding lit cigarette butts and avoid flinging cigarettes or matches from moving vehicles. These innocuous-seeming actions can kindle dry vegetation, potentially spawning a wildfire. 3. Properly extinguish outdoor fires: - To thwart accidental fires, diligently extinguish all outdoor fires. Suffocate them with an ample deluge of water and stir to ensure complete cooling. Submerge charcoal in water until it's entirely devoid of heat. Never leave live charcoal unattended. 4. Never leave fires unattended: - Avoid abandoning any fire without supervision. Even minor sparks or drifting embers can incite nearby foliage or grass, setting off a rapidly spreading fire. Understanding the gravity of a red flag warning and adhering to these precautions is pivotal in mitigating the risk of wildfires during these perilous conditions. Prioritize safety, stay well-informed, and act responsibly to safeguard lives and property.

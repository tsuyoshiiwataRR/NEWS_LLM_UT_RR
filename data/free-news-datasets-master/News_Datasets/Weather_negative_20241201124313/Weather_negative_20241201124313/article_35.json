    "text": "The catastrophe caused by the cold drop phenomenon on Tuesday, October 29 in Spain is of such magnitude that it can already be seen from space.\n[Initiatives to help the victims of the cold drop in various regions of Spain](https://www.outono.net/elentir/2024/10/30/initiatives-to-help-the-victims-of-the-cold-drop-in-various-regions-of-spain/)\n[The terrible images of the floods recorded in several regions of Spain](https://www.outono.net/elentir/2024/10/29/the-terrible-images-of-the-floods-recorded-in-several-regions-of-spain/)\nSeveral images from NASA's Landsat 8 satellite, released in the last few hours, show the extent of the damage caused by this catastrophe in the province of Valencia. Tonight at 9:48 p.m. CET, [NASA Landsat published these two photos.](https://x.com/NASA_Landsat/status/1852090203235660177) The first was taken by the satellite on October 6, and in it we can see the coastal lagoon of the Albufera de Valencia clearly outlined in blue (click on the images to see them enlarged):\nThe second image is from October 30. In it we see the Albufera de Valencia in a greenish color, surrounded to the north and south by two brown spots: the flooded areas.\n[The European Space Agency (ESA) has released a processed version of these images](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2024/10/Valencia_flood_disaster). Here we can see the first one, taken on October 8:\nHere we see the image from October 30th. The coastal lagoon of Albufera is completely overflowing:\nIn addition, this afternoon [the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)](https://x.com/JPSSProgram/status/1852068566536990991), a collaborative program of NASA and NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the USA), has published two more satellite images of this disaster. The first one shows the situation on the Valencian coast on September 30:\nThe second image is from September 30th, and in it we see the brown spots of flooding in the coastal areas of the Valencian Community:\nFinally, [this is the satellite image of Valencia published by Google Maps this year](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.4443342,-0.3716186,11263m/data=!3m1!1e3?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAyOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (I don't know the exact date this image was taken):\n[Soar.earth has published this image of the city of Valencia](https://soar.earth/draw/1739?pos=39.45151309295295%2C-0.4190965353553767%2C12.15) taken on October 30 by Landsat. We can clearly see the large amount of sediment that the Turia River is spewing into the Mediterranean Sea due to the floods:\nMy prayers are with all the people of Valencia, especially with the families of the dozens of people who have died in this catastrophe, the families of the missing people and those who have lost everything due to the floods.\nDon't miss the news and content that interest you.

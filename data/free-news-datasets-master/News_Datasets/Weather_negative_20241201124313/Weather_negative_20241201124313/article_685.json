    "text": "HARRISBURG, Pa. — After nearly a month of consistently dry weather, [drought conditions have returned](https://www.fox43.com/article/weather/drought-watchwarning-lifted-pennsylvania/521-f06f624d-c4f5-4797-965b-cc363818ac4b) to more than half of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, including eight of 10 counties in Central PA, the state Department of Environmental Protection said Friday. The Pennsylvania Drought Task Force on Friday announced that Adams, Allegheny, Beaver, Bucks, Butler, Carbon, Chester, Clearfield, Columbia, Cumberland, Dauphin, Delaware, Fayette, Franklin, Greene, Indiana, Lancaster, Lawrence, Lebanon, Lehigh, Luzerne, Monroe, Montgomery, Montour, Northampton, Northumberland, Perry, Philadelphia, Pike, Somerset, Washington, Westmoreland and York counties are under a Drought Watch, and Berks and Schuylkill counties are under a Drought Warning due to consistent dry conditions. The Drought Task Force is monitoring other areas of the state, the DEP said. While not required, residents and businesses are encouraged to voluntarily conserve water by reducing nonessential water use, the Task Force said. Public water suppliers may request water conservation measures to ensure reliable delivery of drinking water. “Pennsylvania received very little rain over September and October, capping off a dry six months, particularly in the southeast part of the state. DEP makes drought declarations based on long-term trends; a rainy week may not lift the drought status for an area,” said DEP Acting Secretary Jessica Shirley. “We want residents to be aware of these conditions and be mindful of their water use.” “Much of the Commonwealth is at a high risk for fire danger as a result of dry conditions, and it is critical that Pennsylvanians use extreme caution when handling fire or avoid any burning as these conditions persist,” Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) Secretary Cindy Adams Dunn said. “Stay up to date with the latest information using DCNR’s [Wildfire Danger Forecast Map](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com%2Fls%2Fclick%3Fupn%3Du001.5jpw0ENHomUkTUsaJkP6C5W6cnzjxz5fB8uM5CwaKJRGD4gRXZXU-2FVu0j4VtrFl894DE6A0N73plTpi93PaeH2fp-2BCvmlq0xXZTf8kFbSg5aTFRczZacIMbar8ZFjjw2-2FY41NZOjAE76aUhrK-2BRx8A-3D-3Dtxc-_YYFvQ5-2BEPn8C1cQsu9dAbCUjModwuSrDARxYkYim4ZsWgp-2B8Jlh-2BIg4t2FRqWc-2F9N1JJWD5vxLlEJ7sUSYZW9eEs-2FiNY3RIe8IInOXgog1ErVUCzIKGoidhUCBSuKUJdkDUo2QCAKEYMuMfq1tpkddP9H9xuWsGXLF5W06TAFigDlYV05zSzlpMIv1ArjxAYZYgPHuVEjNs2r1qPzi8b1mKQrg87Q2eNuVcGYSQqbmhMPIHsOqNWyh-2FxFfr4BNPITERTswlNGg4IaG6dGPs8aLOmP58hdKIw7r0P-2BpY-2BkhDHEGOdQawLGY4J8jqW-2F527h0NuYVBD-2F3EmHahemwF92rvzwcdfRVHWUlpYttUXWxu0rJ4gTFJGl-2BGY5O6jT0zD&data=05%7C02%7Cnews%40fox43.com%7Ca7df49f82f994ae1a41e08dcfa82ad92%7Cccd8a79b7268413b878971f8b6f4c0df%7C1%7C0%7C638660686381557375%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=JwMOTpbiRptM5KK15q4Nw5Xlh0igWuYIWNkAE5E9p4s%3D&reserved=0) and be sure to follow all local guidance pertaining to burn bans to do your part to keep our natural resources and communities safe from fire.” “Water is essential for growing food. Voluntary restrictions do not apply to farms and other businesses that rely on it to produce food,” Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding said. “Risks and volatility in farming are weather-related more than in any other business. Pennsylvania’s beneficial natural average rainfall has been upended by weather extremes and unpredictability in recent years and 2024 is no exception. Nearly 40 percent of the topsoil across the state is either short or very short in moisture content in the past week, and several counties are eligible for federal relief for earlier drought conditions or flooding. “It’s critical for farmers to keep track of losses, and take advantage of federal crop insurance to help recoup losses. State conservation funding and business planning grants help protect their soil, diversify their operations, and cushion against future weather extremes. Planning cannot change the weather, but it can help farm businesses manage the risks that come with it.” Drought declarations are based on four factors – precipitation, stream flows, groundwater levels and soil moisture. DEP makes its drought declarations after assessing the departures from normal ranges for periods of 3-12 months. DEP also factors in information it receives from public water suppliers. There are several different stages of drought declaration that can be declared by the Commonwealth: Drought Watch, Drought Warning and Drought Emergency. - Drought Watch – a Drought Watch is typically declared for a county with three of the four factors in a “watch” status. Residents are encouraged, but not required, to voluntarily reduce their water use by five to ten percent. - Drought Warning – a Drought Warning is typically declared for a county with 3 of the four indicators in “warning” status. Residents are encouraged, but not required, to reduce their water use by 10-15 percent. - Drought Emergency – if conditions become more severe, a Drought Emergency can be declared by the Governor and emergency water restrictions can be implemented. In the unlikely event of a drought emergency, water suppliers and/or municipal governments will guide residents about water use and conservation. DEP will not implement mandatory water use restrictions outside of a Drought Emergency. Individual public water systems may implement their own conservation measures. Dry conditions have also heightened wildfire risk, according to DEP.",

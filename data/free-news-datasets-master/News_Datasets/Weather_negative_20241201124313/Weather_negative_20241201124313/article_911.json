    "text": "Oklahoma and Oklahoma State Adjust Kickoff Times Due to Severe Weather\nDue to anticipated severe weather in Oklahoma, kickoff times for two college football games have been adjusted. Oklahoma's matchup against Maine has been moved to Noon ET from its original 2:30 p.m., while Oklahoma State's game against Arizona State has been shifted to 3:30 p.m. ET from 7 p.m. Heavy rain and thunderstorms are predicted, prompting officials to prioritize fan and participant safety.\n- Oklahoma's record: 4-4, needs 2 wins in last 4 games for bowl eligibility.\n- Oklahoma State's record: 3-5, currently 0-5 in Big 12 play.\n- The National Weather Service has issued a flood watch for Norman, Oklahoma, from Saturday morning through Monday evening.\n- The Sooners aim to end a three-game losing streak against Maine.\nIf Oklahoma wins against Maine, they can gain confidence heading into tougher matchups against Missouri, Alabama, and LSU. Meanwhile, Oklahoma State will seek a victory to revive their disappointing season as they face Arizona State.\nBottom LineThe schedule adjustments highlight the importance of safety amid severe weather threats, while both Oklahoma teams urgently need victories to improve their dismal season standings and achieve bowl eligibility.\nRead more at CBSSports.com\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

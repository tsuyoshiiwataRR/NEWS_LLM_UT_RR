    "text": "As the calendar flips to November, more snow is accumulating on Okanagan highways. Throughout Friday, Nov. 1, a various amount of snow is expected on many different highways, which could make driving more difficult for travellers this weekend. According to Environment Canada, this is what the highways are expecting: Coquihalla Highway - Hope to Merritt This stretch of highway is expected 5-10 cm of snow throughout the day, with another five cm at night. Another 2-4 cm are expected on Saturday. Coquihalla Highway - Merritt to Kamloops Around five cm of snow is expected on Friday with another 2-4 cm at night. There is no snow forecasted for Saturday. Okanagan Connector - Merritt to Peachland Periods of snow totalling 5-10 cm is projected during the day with another 2-4 cm at night. Additionally, there could be a few flurries on Saturday morning. Highway 3 - Hope to Princeton Ten centimetres of snow is expected to accumulate, with half during the day and the other half at night. Periods of snow are expected to continue until noon on Saturday, when there's a 60 per cent chance of rain showers.

    "text": "01 Nov 2024 | 03:19 AM UTC Puerto Rico: Flash flood warning in effect for parts of eastern region until at least 02:15 AST Nov. 1 Officials issue flash flood warning for parts of eastern Puerto Rico until at least 02:15 AST Nov. 1. Disruptions possible. The US National Weather Service (NWS) has issued a flash flood warning for parts of eastern Puerto Rico until at least 02:15 Nov. 1. Affected areas include Caguas, Cayey, Cidra, Humacao, Juncos, Las Piedras, and San Lorenzo counties. Officials could amend the warning for the impacted areas and/or extend it to the surrounding regions on short notice. Sustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed stormwater drainage systems. Sites located downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly areas, especially where heavy rain has saturated the soil. Localized business disruptions may occur in low-lying areas; some businesses might not operate at full capacity because of flood damage to facilities, possible evacuations, and some employees' inability to reach work sites. Transport, electricity, and telecommunications disruptions are also possible in areas impacted by flooding. The impact area is around 35 km (22 miles) south of San Juan. Monitor local media for weather updates and related advisories. Confirm all transport reservations and business appointments before travel. Make allowances for localized travel delays and potential supply chain disruptions where flooding has been forecast. Do not drive on flooded roads. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

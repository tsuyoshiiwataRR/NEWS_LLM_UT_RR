    "text": "Preliminary rainfall totals show significant accumulations across Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with up to 8 inches recorded in eastern Puerto Rico and 2 to 6 inches in the Virgin Islands Photo Credit: NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE, SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO.\nThe National Weather Service has issued several warnings as unsettled weather marks the start of November for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with conditions favoring heavy rain, flash floods, hazardous seas, and dangerous rip currents.\n[\n](https://wcstx.org/)\nForecasters expect favorable environmental factors, coupled with abundant moisture, to create ideal conditions for sustained showers and thunderstorms, with rainfall totals estimated between 1 to 3 inches across the U.S. Virgin Islands and 2 to 4 inches, or more, in parts of eastern Puerto Rico.\nWith soils already saturated, the Flash Flood Watch remains active through Saturday morning due to a high likelihood of moderate to heavy rain. These conditions are expected to produce rapid river surges, potentially causing some rivers to exceed flood-stage levels. In areas with steep terrain, there is also a significant risk of mudslides.\nAdditional hazards include dangerous marine conditions, where northerly swells and strong winds are contributing to life-threatening rip currents. The Small Craft Advisories, High Risk of Rip Currents, and High Surf Advisories will remain in effect through the weekend, warning against recreational and navigational activities in impacted waters.\nWeather conditions may start to improve on Saturday and Sunday, but forecasters caution that saturated soils and elevated streamflows could mean that even brief periods of moderate to heavy rain may result in additional flooding.\nOfficials urge residents planning outdoor activities to monitor forecasts closely and stay informed of any updates, as hazardous conditions will persist in certain areas through the weekend.\n[latest](https://afraz.pk)news straight to your phone with the VI Consortium app.",

    "text": "The National Weather Service in Springfield released their latest informational packet on drought conditions in the Ozarks. The data therein does not reflect the rain we received yesterday morning, or the forecast rain coming up.\nIn summary and as expected, drought conditions have worsened since the last update. The sliding scale on severity goes from D0 to D4 conditions. The D2 conditions previously only seen in western Douglas County has spread, with those same areas in Douglas County now being upped into D3 category. As of current, the only county in the Missouri listening area not experiencing at least a D1 is Oregon County.\nThese conditions have made fires an issue in recent days, with several large fires breaking out, including within various areas of the Mark Twain National Forest. Remember that much of the listening area may be impacted by burn bans still yet, despite recent rains.\nThe good news appears to be that rain is still expected to make an appearance this weekend and into next week, with a possibility of over 3â€² in the forecast, depending on location.\nThe drought information packet will be posted below.",

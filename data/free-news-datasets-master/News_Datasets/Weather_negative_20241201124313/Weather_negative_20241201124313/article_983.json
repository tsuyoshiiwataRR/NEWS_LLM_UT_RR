    "text": "This Friday (1), the Civil Defense of the State of São Paulo issued a warning of moderate rain during this Friday (1) in some municipalities, which may continue in the next few hours.\nThe precipitation, according to the agency, is due to the heat that hit the region during the day and the humidity that comes from the ocean and the Amazon towards the Southeast, generating instability in certain areas of São Paulo, with the possibility of moderate rain.\nThe state institution’s Emergency Management Center (CGE) sent alerts to residents of the north, northwest, center-west and Vale do Paraíba regions of São Paulo.\nAnyone registered in the alert system via SMS 40199 (find out more about this at the end of the report) received a message informing them of the upcoming rain, including lightning and hail.\nRain, strong winds, lightning and thunder: weather has changed (Image: Daniel Tadevosyan/Shutterstock)\n“Our radars identified rain cells in some regions of the state, with moderate intensity, including winds that could cause some damage,” said São Paulo Civil Defense meteorologist, Cleber Souza.\nBy night, there is a chance of rain in the west of the state, as intense instability is forming in Mato Grosso do Sul and could move to São Paulo.\n“We need to continue monitoring minute by minute to observe the behavior of this rain that forms in Mato Grosso and what its potential will be when it arrives in São Paulo”, continued Souza.\nRead more:\nHow to protect yourself in case of rain or storms In the event of storms or catastrophes, follow the following Civil Defense safety guidelines:\nAvoid open places, such as beaches, football fields and parking lots; Avoid being close to tall and isolated objects, such as trees, poles, water tanks and kiosks; When it rains, keep away from appliances and objects connected to the electrical network, such as refrigerators, stoves and TVs; Avoid bathing during the storm; In case of strong winds, be careful with falling trees, poles, wires and traffic lights; Do not challenge the force of the water, do not try to overcome a flood or walk through flooded areas; If you are in a hillside area, watch for signs of ground movement, such as cracks in walls, leaning trees and posts, and muddy water; If a live wire falls on your vehicle, stay inside your car and call emergency services.\nOnly some regions of the State of São Paulo will be affected (Image: Cris Faga/Shutterstock)\nHow do I register for the Civil Defense alert system? To start receiving storm alerts and other relevant information from Civil Defense, send an SMS with your zip code to number 40199, or send a message to the agency’s WhatsApp, number (61) 2034-4611.",

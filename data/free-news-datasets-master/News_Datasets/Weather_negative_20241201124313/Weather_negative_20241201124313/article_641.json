    "text": "Thundery showers in 1st half of Nov, wet weather caused by inter-monsoon conditions Good news is in store for Singaporeans who miss the wet weather — it will be back in the first half of November.\nThundery showers will fall over the island on most days over the next two weeks, according to a weather advisory released by the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) on Friday (1 Nov).\nSource: Faisal Aljunied on Flickr\nThundery showers in Nov mostly in the afternoon, a few nights may be wet The impending thundery showers will be of moderate to heavy strength, MSS said.\nThey’re expected over parts of Singapore in the afternoon.\nHowever, on a few days they may also extend into the night, MSS added.\nSource: Abdul Rahim Amat on Facebook\nThe wet weather will be caused by inter-monsoon conditions, which are currently prevailing over Singapore and the surrounding region.\nThey typically bring winds that are mostly light and variable in direction.\nThundery showers on 1 or 2 mornings in Nov due to Sumatra squalls On one or two mornings, widespread thundery showers accompanied by gusty winds may occur.\nThese will be brought about by Sumatra squalls — a weather phenomenon brought about by the difference in temperature between land and sea.\nThus, the total rainfall for the first fortnight of November is forecast to be “above average over most parts of the island”.\nTemperature might exceed 34°C on a few days Accordingly, daily maximum temperatures are expected to range from 32°C to 34°C on most days.\nOn a few days, though, the temperature might “slightly exceed” 34°C.\nWell below-average rainfall for second half of Oct The second half of October was less wet compared with the two weeks preceding it, with Singapore recording “well below-average rainfall”.\nShort-duration thundery showers fell in the late morning and afternoon on some days.\nSource: Meteorological Service Singapore\nChoa Chu Kang recorded the highest rainfall for the period on 16 Oct, with a daily total rainfall of 57.6mm.\nThat day, moderate to heavy thundery showers affected the northern and western parts of Singapore in the early afternoon.\nOn the other hand, Jurong West was the driest location, recording 85% below-average rainfall.\nTemperatures about 34°C on most days As for the temperature, it was “warm” in the second half of October, MSS said.\nDaily maximum temperatures soared above 34°C on most days.\nPaya Lebar recorded the highest daily maximum temperature of the fortnight, with the mercury recording 35.6°C on 21 Oct.\nAlso read: Warm & less wet weather expected in 2nd half of Oct, with little rainfall on a few days\nWarm & less wet weather expected in 2nd half of Oct, with little rainfall on a few days\nHave news you must share?

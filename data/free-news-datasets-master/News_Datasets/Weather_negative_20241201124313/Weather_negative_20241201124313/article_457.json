Since this past Tuesday, a DANA (isolated depression at high levels) has left multiple material damage on the Peninsula and has claimed almost 150 lives during the floods it has caused. Locations of Valencian Community, Andalusia, Catalonia and Castilla-La Mancha have experienced the worst side of this storm, which continues to affect our country now, as the State Meteorological Agency has warned ( Aemet ).\nAfter this emergency situation, the focus is now on the evolution of this DANA and how long the devastating consequences it has caused during its time in our country will last. Now, coinciding with the All Saints Bridge which begins this November 1, the storm is heading towards Portugal, although the rains will not disappear of our country and there is still danger.\nUpdate | Special warning for intense rains in the Peninsula and the Balearic Islands.\nThis Tuesday is the most adverse day of the episode, but the very heavy showers will continue during the following days.\nMore details\nhttps://t.co/8PQPlLSl74 pic.twitter.com/BTdRF45lzh\n— AEMET (@AEMET_Esp) October 29, 2024\nAccording to Aemet, during the next few hours we will continue to be immersed in a episode of heavy rain which will leave rainfall in many parts of the east of the country. But until when will this DANA definitely last according to Aemet? This is what will happen over the weather during the November long weekend.\nHow long will DANA last in Spain?\nAccording to eltiempo.es, this Friday, November 1, coinciding with the All Saints’ holiday in Spain DANA will be located to the west of the peninsula, over Portugal.

As Aemet has confirmed, in many areas of Spain “the adverse situation will continue during the weekend”: “ The meteorological emergency has not ended . “DANA continues over Spain,” they have warned from the meteorological service, which will maintain the orange level warnings in these regions this Friday due to accumulations that could exceed the 50mm in 1 hour .\nDANA will lose intensity during the first hours of the weekend and will weaken as it moves south. Despite this, the rains will continue to persist in many parts of the country and Aemet calls for caution in the face of its possible consequences. «On Thursday and Friday there will be storms again in the southern Catalonia locally intense and rainy again abundant in Extremadura and Western Andalusia », explained Rubén del Campo.\nDespite this, the organization points out that these Precipitation will have “nothing to do with with what we have seen in the Mediterranean area. Records are expected that, in some cases, could exceed the 15 or 20 liters per square meter in one hour: « The rains are abundant, but not torrential. », they have warned from Aemet, which expects locally intense rains during the weekend in parts of the Mediterranean and southern Andalusia.\nTemperatures for the All Saints Bridge\nDuring this November long weekend, there will still be some « remains of instability in areas of the Mediterranean between the Balearic Islands, Catalonia and the north of the Valencian Community,” explained meteorologist Mario Picazo. « Don’t have a sense of false security in areas of the coast where it does not rain,” Aemet has warned, explaining that the orography can amplify the rainfall in these next few hours.\nAlthough the organization has asked to maintain “caution” and be attentive to changes in the weather forecast, everything indicates that stability will gain ground to the rains as the All Saints’ Bridge weekend progresses.\nThroughout the weekend, we will also have generally mild temperatures for the season. During these days, the values it will be around 20 degrees in many capitals, while in the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands they could approach the 25 degrees maximum . For its part, on the northern plateau and the west of the peninsula some slightly cooler thermometers could be recorded, although everything indicates that the minimum temperatures will remain. above 10 degrees .\n#Aemet #warns #weather #Spain #Saints #long #weekend #date #DANA",

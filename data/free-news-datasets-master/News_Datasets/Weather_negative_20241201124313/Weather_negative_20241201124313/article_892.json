Updated: 5:36 PM CDT Nov 1, 2024 Shawanda Jones WDSU Northshore Reporter Heavy rainfall floods roads in St. Tammany Parish and leaves residents frustrated Heavy rainfall from Thursday night's storms left roads flooded and residents upset as water takes hours to recede\nShare Copy Link Copy {copyShortcut} to copy Link copied! Updated: 5:36 PM CDT Nov 1, 2024 TROPICS WITH THE FULL OF THE FORECAST COMING UP LATER. FAMILIES IN SAINT TAMMANY PARISH ARE FRUSTRATED WITH WATER WOES AFTER STORMS CAUSED FLOODING AROUND PLACES LIKE COVINGTON AND FOLSOM. WDSU NORTH SHORE BUREAU REPORTER SHAWANDA JONES JOINS US WITH DETAILS ON HOW FAMILIES ARE DEALING WITH A LOT OF FLOODED ROADS. SHAWANDA. YEAH, I’M HERE ON GODSCHALK ROAD IN SAINT TAMMANY PARISH, WHERE THE ROADS WERE ABSOLUTELY COVERED IN WATER. JUST A FEW HOURS AGO, PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON THE ROAD SAY THAT THEY DIDN’T EVEN KNOW IF IT WAS SAFE TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES. NOW YOU CAN SEE THAT THE WATER HAS STARTED TO RECEDE, BUT NOT BEFORE IT LEFT A BIG MESS FOR DRIVERS AND RESIDENTS ALIKE. WE HAVE THE RAIN IN A WHILE, SO. BUT IT BROUGHT WAY MORE THAN I EXPECTED. HEAVY RAIN FROM THE LAST 24 HOURS LEFT NEIGHBORHOODS ALONG HIGHWAY 1077 COVERED IN WATER. THIS MORNING. LUKE MCADAMS SAYS OVERFLOWING DITCHES AND FLOODED STREETS ARE A NATURAL OCCURRENCE IN THIS PART OF THE PARISH. IT FLOODS LIKE WORSE. A PUSH UP INTO THE DOORS AND STUFF. MAYBE GET IN THE HOUSE SO THAT’S KIND OF AGGRAVATING DOWN A FEW MILES ON BUNNY LANE, THAT’S WHERE WE MEET MADISON ALONSO. SHE WAS CANVASING THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO SEE IF THE WATER LEVELS WERE FINALLY AT A SAFE HEIGHT TO DRIVE THROUGH. WE FLOOD LIKE THIS DURING A NATURAL DISASTER, BUT WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS, IT’S ALMOST LIKE IT FLOODS LIKE THIS WITH EVERY RAINSTORM. SHE SAYS WITH MORE HOUSES POPPING UP IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THE RAIN WATER HAS NOWHERE ELSE TO FLOW. IN THE RECENT YEARS, WE’VE HAD A NEIGHBORHOOD BUILT RIGHT BEHIND US AND THEY COMPLETELY CHANGED THE WATER FLOW. THAT’S WHEN IT ALL STARTED RISING. ALONSO SAYS THE NEIGHBORHOOD NEEDS MORE OUTLETS TO CREATE AN EFFICIENT FLOW OF WATER TO COMBAT THE CONTINUOUS CONSTRUCTION ON FLOOD PRONE MARSHLANDS. WE NEED HELP OUT HERE. BIG TIME. ALTHOUGH RESIDENTS REPORTED RECEIVING OVER FIVE INCHES OF RAIN IN THIS AREA, THERE HASN’T BEEN ANY OFFICIAL REPORTS OF FLOOD DAMAGE. REPORTING FROM SAI",

    "text": "Although the dry weather over Sukkos was appreciated, with zero measurable rain in the state in October, the entire New Jersey is either is now designated as a “moderate” or “severe” drought zone, according to the latest maps from the National Drought Mitigation Center.\nAccording to the map, from southern Monmouth county and below, are now experiencing a “severe drought,” while the Northern half of the state is is one level below.\nAn average October sees 4.19 inches of precipitation.\nAreas where there is a moderate drought will likely experience crop or pasture loss, a very high fire risk, water shortages and common water restrictions imposed.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor, which is updated once a week to show the location and intensity of drought conditions across the country, show experts’ assessments of conditions related to dryness and drought including observations of how much water is available in streams, lakes, and soils compared to usual for the same time of year.\nIt should be noted that in New Jersey, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection makes the official calls on drought status in the state.\nEarlier this month, the DEP issued a statewide Drought Watch, strongly urging residents and businesses to voluntarily conserve water, as the state experienced below-average rainfall over the last three months, contributing to diminished streamflow, reservoir, and groundwater levels, as well as an increase in wildfire activity.\nSince October 1st, the state Forest Fire Service has responded to 302 wildfires, which have burned 549.25 acres.\nThe declaration of a Drought Watch is intended to increase public awareness and appreciation of the stress water supply sources are facing and encourages the public to practice voluntary water conservation measures. If conditions do not improve, declaration of a Drought Warning or a Drought Emergency with mandatory water use restrictions may become necessary.",

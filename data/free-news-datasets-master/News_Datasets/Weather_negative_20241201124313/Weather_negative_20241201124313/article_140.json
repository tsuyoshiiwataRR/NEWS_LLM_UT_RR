    "text": "The 2024 hurricane season appears to be never ending. Threats are still active, while recent reports suggest hurricane formation could continue heading into December. That's something we haven't witnessed in nearly two decades.\nFor the time being, The National Hurricane Center is focused on what's ahead in the second-last month of the year. The current forecast calls for movement in the Caribbean. While odds were previously at 40% for formation in the upcoming seven days, those numbers just received a boost by the NHC following a recent report.\nLet's take a closer look at the ongoing formation, and what's ahead for other areas - specifically the Central East Pacific and Western East Pacific.\n[Related ](/hurricane-kristy-is-expected-to-dissipate-early-next-week-but-it-isnt-going-away-quietly/)\n[ Hurricane Kristy Is Expected To Dissipate Early Next Week, But It Isn't Going Away Quietly ](/hurricane-kristy-is-expected-to-dissipate-early-next-week-but-it-isnt-going-away-quietly/)\nDowngraded from a category 5 cyclone, Hurricane Kristy is still causing \"life-threatening\" conditions over the weekend.\nNational Hurricane Center Odds For The Caribbean Sea And The Gulf Of Mexico Jump To 50%\nThe National Hurricane Center updated its odds 24 hours later. The most recent update came at 8 AM on Thursday. For the North Atlantic, The Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, odds of formation are still at 0% in the next 48 hours, but jumped to 50% over the next 7 days.\nThe NHC notes the depression could drift northward or northwestward.\nThe NHC wrote, \"A broad area of low pressure is likely to develop over the southwestern Caribbean Sea during the next couple of days. Gradual development is possible thereafter, and a tropical depression could form over the weekend or early next week while the system drifts generally northward or northwestward over the central or western Caribbean Sea.\"\n[Related ](/latest-national-hurricane-center-update-storm-formation-in-upcoming-days/)\n[ Latest National Hurricane Center Update Gives 40% Chance Of Storm Formation In Upcoming 7 Days ](/latest-national-hurricane-center-update-storm-formation-in-upcoming-days/)\nThe NHC continues to monitor low pressure patterns in the southwestern Caribbean Sea.\nAs for the Central East Pacific movement, the odds are now lowered to 10% in the next 48 hours, and 20% over the next seven days. The Western East Pacific now has a 0% chance of any formation over the next 48 hours to 7 days. Within the area, Baja, California is now producing limited showers and thunderstorms. NHC wrote in its recent report, \"Development is no longer anticipated.\"\nHurricane Activity Might Extend Past November\nNovember 30th is typically the cut-off date for hurricane season, but this year is shaping up to be a different one. One more hurricane in the Florida region could set a record for the U.S. state. Not only are hurricane threats still looming, but AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva believes tropical development might extend into December. This would be the first time since Olga back in December 2007.\n\"We've been saying it since the very beginning of the hurricane season, even way back before when we made our initial forecast out in March, that we thought the end of the hurricane season could get quite active [in November]. We still think that right now.\"\nFlorida's current forecast indicates rainy weather as of Tuesday. Following the devastation from Hurricane Milton, Floridians are hoping they have seen the last of stormy weather. History is on their side, but this year has proven to be quite unpredictable.\nStay with us for more updates.",

Now that‚Äôs the weather‚Äôs equivalent of kicking the dog‚Ä¶ Absolutely not okay! You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd just get the hint and take it easy, but no, it seems the skies have a vendetta against umbrella manufacturers in Huelva!\nThe State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) is urging everyone to proceed with extreme caution‚Äîlike Michael Flatley dancing in a minefield. So, what do we do? Well, apparently, the genius play is to avoid traveling!

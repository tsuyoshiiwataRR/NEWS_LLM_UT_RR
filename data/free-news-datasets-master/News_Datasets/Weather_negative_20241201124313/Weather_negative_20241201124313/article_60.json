    "text": "A strong Typhoon Kong-rey made landfall on Taiwan's east coast yesterday, the largest storm by size to hit the island in nearly 30 years, closing financial markets, causing 314 international and all domestic flights to be canceled and reducing rail services.\nThe typhoon knocked out power to nearly half a million households.\nThe high-speed railway, which connects major cities on Taiwan's populated western plains, operated at much reduced service.\nKong-rey hit the mountainous and sparsely populated east coast county of Taitung, with strong winds and torrential rain affecting almost all the island.\nOne person had died when a truck hit a fallen tree in central Taiwan.\nAt one point a super typhoon, Kong-rey slightly weakened overnight but remained powerful as the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane packing gusts of more than 250 kilometers an hour.\nAdministration forecaster Gene Huang said after hitting the east coast it would head toward the Taiwan Strait as a much weakened storm and urged people to stay at home due to the danger from winds.\nEnvironmental officials were working to prevent oil leaking from a mainland cargo ship beached against rocks on Taiwan's northern coast after losing power in turbulent weather.\nSome roofs had been damaged and more than 1,300 homes had lost power.\nParts of eastern Taiwan recorded one meter of rainfall since the typhoon began approaching on Wednesday.\nThe defense ministry put 36,000 troops on standby to help with rescue efforts, while 10,000 people have been evacuated from high-risk areas ahead of time.\nKong-rey is forecast to graze China along the Fujian coast this morning.\nShanghai is bracing for potentially the worst rains in more than 40 years.\nREUTERS",

    "text": "Almost all (99.87%) of Indiana is experiencing some level of drought (D0-D4), with 68.14% in moderate drought (D1) or higher, and 34.65% in severe drought (D2) or higher — almost all of it in northern Indiana. Comparatively, a year ago, only 63.16% was under drought conditions, with a much smaller portion experiencing severe drought.\nThree months ago, on July 30, a much larger area (82.08%) was drought-free. Now, only 0.13% remains free from drought.\nA Red Flag Warning was issued for northern Indiana on Tuesday, October 29, 2024, as gusty winds up to 56 – 64 km/h (35 – 40 mph), the temperature near 26 °C (80 °F), and dry conditions made fires in agricultural land become a common event this week.\nOctober 2024 is now officially recorded as the third driest October in 127 years for Fort Wayne. With only 11 mm (0.43 inches) of rain, it marks the driest October since 1964.\nOnly 42.4 mm (1.67 inches) of rain fell in October at the South Bend International Airport, making it the driest month in 9 years and more than 50 mm (2 inches) below the monthly average total.\nVERY DRY OCTOBER IN SOUTH BEND: 1.67\" of rain fell this month across just 5 days. This was the driest October in 9 years and was more than 2 inches below the typical monthly total. pic.twitter.com/ivmmbKpj4Q\n— NWS Northern Indiana (@NWSIWX) November 1, 2024 INCREDIBLY DRY OCTOBER: October 2024 officially goes into the record books as the 3rd driest October in 127 years for Fort Wayne, IN! With only 0.43” of rain this month, this October was the driest since 1964. pic.twitter.com/ALqHPmB968\n— NWS Northern Indiana (@NWSIWX) November 1, 2024 The monthly Climate Prediction Center outlook for November favors above normal temperatures (40-50% chances) and above normal precipitation (33-50% chances). With ongoing drought this fall, a return to a more active weather pattern is certainly welcome! pic.twitter.com/Oy3Kb4Cvgm\n— NWS Northern Indiana (@NWSIWX) November 1, 2024 The monthly Climate Prediction Center outlook for November predicts above-average temperatures of about 40 to 50% chance and precipitation of about 33 to 50% chance.\nNorthern Indiana is home to significant agricultural areas, especially for corn and soybeans, which are the state’s primary crops. The region also supports wheat, hay, and livestock farming, which are essential to both the local and national agricultural economy.\nCounties like Allen, Dekalb, and Elkhart are particularly known for their large-scale farming operations. Additionally, northern Indiana has a mix of smaller specialty farms producing tomatoes, mint, and melons.\nAgriculture here is highly sensitive to drought conditions, as dry weather can reduce crop yields, stress livestock, and affect overall productivity.\nThe recent increase in drought conditions, as well as record-low rainfall in areas like Fort Wayne, could have substantial impacts on crop health, soil moisture, and farming sustainability in the region.\n1 Weather forecast for Northern Indiana – NWS – November 1, 2024\n2 Indiana Drought Monitor – DroughtMonitor – October 29, 2024",

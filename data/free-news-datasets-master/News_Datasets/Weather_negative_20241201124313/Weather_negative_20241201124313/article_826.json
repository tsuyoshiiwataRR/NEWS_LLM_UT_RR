    "text": "Weather Update: Rain and Strong Winds Expected, Followed ⁢by a Sudden Drop ‍in Temperature The leaves are just⁣ starting to turn beautifully, but the rain may ⁣cause them to fall off prematurely. The ​rain, which started ‍on the ⁢first day of November, ⁢is⁤ an indirect effect of Typhoon No. 21 ‘Kong-rey’.\nA ‍significant amount of rain is expected⁢ in our area, with up to ⁤40mm predicted by tomorrow morning. Meanwhile, strong winds are forecasted to hit Daegu and Gyeongbuk, with instantaneous ‌winds of over ⁢55 km/h, and the eastern coast of southern Gyeongbuk, Ulleungdo, and ‌Dokdo, with instantaneous wind speeds of over 70 km/h.\nPlease exercise caution ‌to avoid⁢ damage from the ​strong winds. Next⁢ week,⁤ the season will quickly transition to winter, bringing a significant change in temperature.\nUntil the weekend, temperatures will remain slightly above normal, with a large⁣ daily temperature difference . However, temperatures will drop sharply from midday next Monday ⁢due⁤ to ​the influence of a⁤ continental high pressure .\nIn particular, the morning temperature in Daegu next Wednesday is expected to plummet to 3 degrees, with frost and ice predicted in many ⁣areas. Unlike this ​week, mild⁣ daytime temperatures will also drop, ⁣and a strong ‌cold⁣ wind will blow, making the perceived temperature even lower‌ throughout the day.\nThe air quality ‍is expected to be good, with the fine dust level on Saturday being⁣ ‘good’. The sky will be⁤ mostly ⁢cloudy, with rain falling until the morning.\nA detailed look at the temperature reveals that the morning​ temperature in Daegu will ⁢be 15 degrees, Andong 14 degrees, and Pohang 17 degrees, which will be slightly higher than today. Daytime temperatures will be similar to normal, at 21 ⁣degrees in Daegu and Andong, and 20 degrees in Pohang.\nThe ‌rain ⁤has stopped, and cold air has descended, causing temperatures ⁤next ⁤week‍ to be lower than average and very cold. Daily temperature ⁢differences‌ will continue to widen.",

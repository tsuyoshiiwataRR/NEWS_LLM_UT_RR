    "text": "Sign up for the Morning Brief email newsletter to get weekday updates from The Weather Channel and our meteorologists.\nM&a;#8203;ultiple rounds of rain and thunderstorms will plague parts of the central U.S. into Monday, bringing threats of severe weather and flooding rain, even in areas where drought conditions exist.\nH&a;#8203;ere&s;s the latest timing and impacts for the severe thunderstorm threat as well as where flooding may materialize:\nSevere Weather Forecast Timing S&a;#8203;aturday-Saturday night: West Texas into southwest Oklahoma. Wind damage and hail are the primary threats, but an isolated tornado is possible, especially in southwest Texas.\nS&a;#8203;unday-Sunday night: Areas from north Texas to western and central Oklahoma and central Kansas could see scattered severe storms. Wind damage and hail are the primary concerns, but an isolated tornado threat is possible.\nM&a;#8203;onday-Monday Night: The threat will shift eastward from parts of Missouri southwestward to portions of Oklahoma, Arkansas and northern and eastern Texas. Wind damage, hail and a tornado threat may materialize depending on how unstable the atmosphere becomes.\nF&a;#8203;lood Threat Forecast Timing A&a;#8203; broad area from far northern Texas into Oklahoma, western Arkansas, southeast Kansas and portions of Missouri may see 3 to 8 inches of rain into the new week ahead.\nEven though this rain is needed given the widespread drought , too much rain too quickly could cause flash flooding. If traveling, be sure to never drive through any floodwaters.\nH&a;#8203;ere&s;s a look at the timing of the greatest flood potential.\nS&a;#8203;aturday-Saturday night: Texas Panhandle into much of Oklahoma, southeast Kansas and western Missouri.\nS&a;#8203;unday-Sunday night : Far northern Texas to much of Oklahoma, northwest Arkansas, eastern Kansas, western and northern Missouri, southeast Iowa and western Illinois.\nM&a;#8203;onday-Monday night: Northeast Texas to eastern Oklahoma, western and northern Arkansas, much of Missouri and western and northern Illinois.\nW&a;#8203;hat&s;s Causing The Stormy Weather Pattern T&a;#8203;he main instigator is a sluggish low-pressure system tracking from the West into the central U.S. through early next week.\nC&a;#8203;lockwise flow from high pressure in the East will pump plenty of Gulf of Mexico moisture northward for this system to interact with, giving rise to repeated rounds of rain and thunderstorms.\nChris Dolce has been a senior meteorologist with weather.com for over 10 years after beginning his career with The Weather Channel in the early 2000s.\n\\n",

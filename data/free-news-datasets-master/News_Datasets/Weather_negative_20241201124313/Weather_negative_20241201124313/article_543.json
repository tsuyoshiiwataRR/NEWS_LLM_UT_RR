    "text": "A winter weather advisory was issued by the National Weather Service on Friday at 6:04 a.m. in effect until 5 p.m. for East Slopes of the Oregon Cascades.\nThe weather service states, \"Snow Above 4000 feet. Additional snow accumulations between 1 and 3 inches around pass levels and between 4 and 8 inches in the higher elevations.\"\n\"Periods of moderate and heavy snow will combine with low visibilities to create difficult driving conditions,\" says the weather service. \"Slow down and use caution while traveling.\"\nWinter weather driving safety: Navigating the chill with expert tips from the weather service Winter weather can make driving treacherous, leading to over 6,000 weather-related vehicle fatalities and over 480,000 injuries each year. When traveling during snow or freezing rain, prioritize safety by slowing down. In near-freezing temperatures, it's safest to assume that icy conditions exist on roadways and adjust your driving accordingly. Be cautious of ice accumulating on power lines or tree branches, which can lead to snapping and falling hazards. If possible, avoid driving in such conditions. If you must venture out, opt for routes with fewer trees and power lines. Never touch a downed power line, and immediately dial 911 if you come across one. Here are additional winter weather driving tips:\nShare your travel plans:\nWhen traveling out of town in hazardous winter weather, inform your family or friends of your destination, planned route, and estimated time of arrival.\nPrepare your vehicle:\nEnsure your gas tank is full and equip your vehicle with essential winter supplies such as a windshield scraper, jumper cables, a small shovel, flashlight, cell phone, blanket, extra warm clothing, drinking water, and high-calorie non-perishable food.\nStay calm when stranded:\nIf you become stranded, stay composed. Notify someone about your situation and location. Avoid attempting to walk to safety. Attach a cloth to your car's antenna or mirror to signal that you require assistance. Make your vehicle more visible by using the dome light and flashers.\nBe mindful of snow plows:\nKeep an eye out for snow plows and provide them with ample room to pass. Only overtake a plow when you have a clear view of the road ahead.\nCheck road conditions:\nBefore embarking on your journey, verify the current road conditions to make informed travel decisions.\nStay safe on wintry roads with these valuable winter driving tips from the weather service, and reduce the risk of accidents during challenging weather conditions.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

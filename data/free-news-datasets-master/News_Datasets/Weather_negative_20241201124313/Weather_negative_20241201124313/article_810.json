    "text": "Photo: Malle-Liisa Raigla\nPhoto: Malle-Liisa Raigla The weather service has given Läänemaa a level two warning for this evening, that in addition to strong wind, sleet may fall in the rain in the evening and the roads will become slippery at times.\nOn Friday evening, the north-west wind in Läänemaa can reach a gust of 25 meters per second, in the Väina Sea the gusts can reach 28 meters per second.\nTS Laevad, which maintains the wrong connection between the mainland and Hiiumaa , has already warned that the departure of the last two ferries on the Rohuküla-Heltermaa ferry line is in danger on Friday evening due to strong winds and a rapid rise in the water level.\nAccording to Guldar Kivro, head of TS Laevade’s shipping department and member of the board, the departure of Hiiumaa line ships is affected by two weather-related phenomena, one of which is the strengthening of the northwest wind, which can gust up to 30 m/s in the evening, and the other is a rapid rise in the water level. “Due to the high water level, the shore ramp does not match the ship’s ramp and vehicles cannot get on and off the ship. This will also affect Saturday morning departures”, said Kivro.\nKihnu Veeteed, which is connected to Vormsi island, has announced that due to the high water level, the passenger ferry Ormsö will not accept vehicles weighing more than 3.5 tons on Friday.\nThe weather service warns that sleet may fall between the rain and roads will become slippery in places on Friday night.\n2024-11-01 14:14:00\n#weather #service #warns #strong #wind #sleet #high #water #level #disrupts #ferry #traffic\n**Interview with AI Specialist, Dr. ⁤Emily Cartwright**\n*Editor:* Today, we have ⁢Dr. Emily Cartwright, an AI specialist with over a decade ‌of ‌experience in the field, joining us to discuss crucial interview questions for⁤ aspiring AI ​engineers. Welcome, Dr. Cartwright!\n*Dr. Cartwright:*‍ Thank you for having me! I’m excited to be here to discuss this important topic.\n*Editor:* Let’s dive right in. What‌ do you consider the most critical ⁤skills an ​AI engineer should possess?\n*Dr. Cartwright:*⁤ First and‌ foremost, proficiency in machine learning algorithms ⁤is essential. This includes understanding both supervised and unsupervised learning.⁣ Additionally, a strong grasp of neural networks and deep ⁤learning⁣ frameworks is crucial, as they are foundational to many AI applications.\n*Editor:*⁤ Absolutely! ⁤And ⁣when interviewing candidates, ‍what types of questions should⁣ employers focus on?\n*Dr.‍ Cartwright:* Employers should aim to assess both theoretical knowledge and practical application. Questions about the ⁣candidate’s experience with specific algorithms, their ability to optimize models, and how they handle data preprocessing are pivotal.⁤ Asking ⁣scenario-based questions can reveal how a candidate applies their knowledge⁢ in real-world situations.\n*Editor:* That’s insightful! Can you give us an example of a challenging question you would ⁣recommend?\n*Dr. Cartwright:*​ Certainly! One challenging ‍question could be: “Can you explain⁣ the difference between ⁣L1‌ and ⁣L2 regularization, and when‌ you would use each?” This not only tests their knowledge of machine learning concepts but also their critical​ thinking skills.\n*Editor:* Interesting! Moving on, how important ⁣is teamwork and collaboration in AI projects?\n*Dr. Cartwright:*‌ It’s⁢ extremely important. AI ​projects typically require cross-functional collaboration. ‌Candidates ⁤should demonstrate good communication skills ⁢and the‌ ability to work‍ with data ⁢scientists, software engineers, and business stakeholders.\n*Editor:* are there any resources you recommend ⁤for candidates preparing for ⁣these interviews?\n*Dr. Cartwright:* Yes!⁣ Resources like online courses focusing on machine learning and neural networks, as well as platforms like GitHub for‍ practical application, are invaluable.⁢ Reading up on recent advancements in AI through journals or articles can also give candidates an edge.\n*Editor:* Great advice! Thank you, Dr. Cartwright, for sharing your insights with us today.\n*Dr. Cartwright:*⁢ Thank you for having me. I hope aspiring AI engineers find this information helpful as they ⁤prepare for their careers!",

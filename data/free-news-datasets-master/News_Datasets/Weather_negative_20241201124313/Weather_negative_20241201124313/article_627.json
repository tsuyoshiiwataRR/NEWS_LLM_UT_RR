    "text": "An updated report from the National Weather Service was issued on Friday at 10:05 a.m. for elevated fire danger until 5 p.m. for Southern Wayne as well as Lackawanna, Luzerne and Pike counties.\n\"Northwest winds of 10 to 20 mph, gusting to 25 to 30 mph, low relative humidity, dry fuels, and leaf litter will support wildfire spread if any fire were to ignite. Any outdoor burning is strongly discouraged. Use extra caution if handling any potential ignition sources, such as machinery or matches, and ensure to properly extinguish or dispose cigarette butts,\" says the weather service.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

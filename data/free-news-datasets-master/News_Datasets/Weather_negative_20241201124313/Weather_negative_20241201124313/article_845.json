    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. — With one month left in hurricane season, the National Hurricane Center said Friday said there was a high chance a Caribbean system will form into the season’s next tropical depression while tracking two more systems with potential to develop. As of the NHC’s 2 p.m. Eastern time tropical outlook, it said a broad area of low pressure is likely to develop over the southwestern Caribbean Sea in the next day. “Gradual development is possible thereafter, and a tropical depression is likely to form late this weekend or early next week while the system drifts generally northward or northwestward over the central or western Caribbean Sea,” forecasters said. Heavy rain is possible either way over the next several days across portions of the adjacent land areas in the western Caribbean. The NHC gives it a 30% chance to develop in the next two days and 70% in the next seven days. If it were to gain enough steam, it could become Tropical Storm Patty. The NHC also began tracking Thursday two more systems. One is a trough of low pressure near Puerto Rico producing widespread cloudiness and showers over the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the northern Leeward Islands and adjacent waters of the Atlantic and the northeastern Caribbean. “Slow development of this system is possible during the next 2-3 days as it moves west-northwestward near the Greater Antilles,” forecasters said. “After that time, this system is expected to be absorbed into the low pressure area over the Caribbean.” It’s expected to bring local heavy rains over the next several days from the northern Leeward Islands westward across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola to eastern Cuba and the southeastern Bahamas. The NHC gives it a 10% chance to develop in the next two to seven days. Then, in the North Atlantic, a low pressure system with increased convection Fridya was located a few hundred miles west of the western Azores. “Earlier satellite derived wind data depicted winds to storm-force mainly to the south of the the center,” forecasters said. “Environmental conditions appear favorable for some additional development and the system could become a subtropical or tropical storm as it moves generally eastward during the next few days.” The NHC gives it a 40% chance to develop in the next two to seven days. The potential systems would come in the final month of the official hurricane season, which runs from June 1-Nov. 30. The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season has so far seen 15 named storms, 10 of which have become hurricanes. Three of those struck Florida. --",

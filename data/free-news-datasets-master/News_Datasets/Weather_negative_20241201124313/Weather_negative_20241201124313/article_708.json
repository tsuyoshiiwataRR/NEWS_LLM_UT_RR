    "text": "York County is in a drought watch; red flag issued for fire warning York County is under a drought watch as the area has received little rain in weeks, and a red flag warning has been issued for Friday for fire conditions. The state Department of Environmental Protection issued the drought watches on Friday for more than 30 counties in the Commonwealth. In addition, Berks and Schuylkill counties are under a drought warning, a news release states. “Pennsylvania received very little rain over September and October, capping off a dry six months, particularly in the southeast part of the state. DEP makes drought declarations based on long-term trends; a rainy week may not lift the drought status for an area,” DEP Acting Secretary Jessica Shirley said in a news release. “We want residents to be aware of these conditions and be mindful of their water use.” Residents and businesses are encouraged to voluntarily conserve water as the dry conditions continue, the release states. [Dover Township already has placed mandatory restrictions](https://www.dovertownship.org/mandatory-restriction-on-nonessential-water-use/) on non-essential water use, according to the municipality's website. To date this year, [the York Water Company has recorded a deficit of 7.67 inches of precipitation](https://www.ydr.com/story/news/local/2024/10/30/dry-weather-results-in-lowered-lake-williams-york-county-burn-ban/75810356007/). In October, the York Airport in Jackson Township only received 0.17 inches of rain. Meanwhile, a red flag warning has been issued for York County until 7 p.m. Friday, according to the National Weather Service. It warns of rapid wildfire growth because of strong winds, low humidity and dry fuels. \"Any fires that develop may quickly get out of control and become difficult to contain,\" it states. [York County commissioners have enacted a burn ban](https://www.ydr.com/story/news/local/2024/10/30/dry-weather-results-in-lowered-lake-williams-york-county-burn-ban/75810356007/), which takes effect today. It prohibits all open burning, including fires in burn barrels and fire pits. Fireworks also are not allowed unless given authorization from the local municipality, the ban states.",

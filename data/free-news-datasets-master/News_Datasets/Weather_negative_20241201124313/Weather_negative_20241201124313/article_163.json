    "text": "Multiple severe thunderstorms are likely for parts of southeast Queensland, including Brisbane and Sunshine Coast, with experts calling one storm “very dangerous”. A severe storm warning is in effect for parts of Ipswich, Gympie, Logan, Somerset, Scenic Rim, Sunshine Coast and Noosa council areas on Friday afternoon. The Bureau of Meteorology warned a “very dangerous thunderstorm likely to produce giant hailstones was detected near Kooralbyn”. “This thunderstorm is moving towards the north and is forecast to affect Boonah, and the area between Boonah and Beaudesert, by 2.40pm — and Beaudesert and Bundamba Lagoon by 3.10pm,” BOM said. “Other severe thunderstorms likely to produce large hailstones and damaging winds were detected near Borumba Dam and the area southwest of Eumundi. “These thunderstorms are moving towards the northeast and are forecast to affect the area southwest of Noosa Heads and Imbil by 2.40pm and Noosa Heads and Pomona by 3.10pm.” Senior meteorologist Shane Kennedy said that Brisbane was “fairly lucky” on Thursday and missed the worst of the weather, but “may not be quite as lucky during the Friday”. Reports of hail slamming parts of Brisbane CBD and New Farm began coming in just before 4pm. “All of these severe thunderstorms could bring large hail, so 2cm or more, damaging wind gusts, which are 90k/hr or more, and heavy rainfall which may lead to flash flooding,” Kennedy said. Giant hail, which BOM categorises as 5cm or more, has also been recorded in Boonah. BOM says more severe storms are likely to hit the southeast coast and parts of Wide Bay and Burnett forecast districts with a risk of large to giant hail, damaging to destructive winds and heavy rainfall. It said a moist and unstable air mass combined with a southeasterly wind change moving up the coast is leading to the development of severe thunderstorms through southeast Queensland. “Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds and large hailstones in the warning area over the next several hours,” BOM said. “Locations which may be affected include Gold Coast, Brisbane, Caboolture, Ipswich, Noosa Heads, Cleveland, Jimboomba, Mount Tamborine and Redcliffe.” BOM advised residents to park cars undercover away from trees, keep asthma medications close by as storms and wind can trigger asthma attacks, and charge mobile phones and power banks now in case the power goes out. Pets should also be kept somewhere safe, and with identifiable tags should they get out and become lost. A severe thunderstorm warning is also in place for parts of the Northern Rivers and Northern Tablelands in NSW. The warnings come a day after storms ripped through parts of southeast Queensland on Thursday, with SES crews responding to dozens of calls overnight. Most calls were related to property damage, with Maleny resident John Neil telling 7NEWS the windows in his Sunshine Coast house were smashed and his car damaged by golf ball-sized hail. Neil said the storms “came rolling in” and carpeted the lawn in hail, damaging the garden. Fellow Maleny resident Charlie Thompson said the storm came through quickly before the clouds turned green and hail covered his yard “like snow”. More than 150,000 lightning strikes were recorded, leaving thousands of residents without power.",

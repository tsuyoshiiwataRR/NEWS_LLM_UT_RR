Seems to be close to Shawnee on Delaware.— HoundLyfe (@HoundLyfe) [pic.twitter.com/xxlmErkK0o] [November 1, 2024] The red flag warning, [issued by the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, N.J.](https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=PHI&wwa=red%20flag%20warning), is in effect until 7 p.m. Friday. In addition to Lehigh and Northampton counties, the warning also covers a large swath of eastern Pennsylvania, including Carbon, Monroe, Berks, Delaware, Philadelphia and more. A red flag warning is issued when the risk of fire danger is highest, and residents are urged to be extremely cautious with any open flame. Any fires that develop may quickly get out of control and become difficult to contain.National Weather Service in Mount Holly “Any fires that develop may quickly get out of control and become difficult to contain,” according to the NWS. Under these conditions, cigarettes or matches tossed out of vehicles may ignite dry grass on the side of the road. Outdoor power equipment that creates sparks should not be used, and activities with open flames or sparks should be avoided. Winds are expected, with gusts up to 30 mph, forecasters said. Relative humidity could be as low as 27% with temperatures warming again, with highs up to 78 degrees. [The Valley on Thursday was classified as in either “moderate” or “severe” drought by the U.S. Drought Monitor after weeks of dry conditions](https://www.lehighvalleynews.com/environment-science/lehigh-valley-slips-into-stage-of-severe-drought). However, the state Department of Environmental Protection has the state listed as “normal” [for its Current Drought Declaration Status](https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Water/PlanningConservation/Drought/pages/default.aspx).",

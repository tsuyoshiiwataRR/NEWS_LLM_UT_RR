    "text": "Recommended Stories A few days after season’s first Cyclone Dana battered Odisha after making landfall between Bhitarkanika in Kendrapara and Dhamra in Bhadrak with a wind speed of 110kmph, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday predicted the formation of another cyclonic storm over Bay of Bengal. “Most of the deterministic models are indicating likely formation of an upper air cyclonic circulation over southwest BoB around 5th November with gradual westwards movement towards Tamil Nadu coast till 9th November with no significant intensification,” the IMD said in a press release. It further said, “Considering guidance from various numerical models and environmental features it is inferred that there is likelihood of formation of a trough of low over south BoB during week 1 with formation of a Low Pressure Area over southwest BoB towards the end of week 1. There is also low probability of its intensification into a depression over southwest BoB off Tamil Nadu coast during first half of week 2.\" However, ECMM is indicating moderate (40-60%) probability of formation of depression over south BoB around 7th November. 850 hPa wind field of IMD ERF model is indicating a trough over south BoB during week 1 and an upper air cyclonic circulation over southwest BoB off southeast Sri Lanka coast in the first half of week 2, it continued. \"Cyclogenesis probability forecast based on IMD’s dynamical statistical model indicates 30-40% probability of cyclogenesis over southwest BoB off Tamil Nadu-Sri Lanka coasts/Comorin area during week 1. During week 2, 20-30% (low) probability of cyclogenesis over southwest BoB off Tamil Nadu-Sri Lanka coasts and 30-40% probability of cyclogenesis over southeast BoB & adjoining south Andaman sea,\" it added.",

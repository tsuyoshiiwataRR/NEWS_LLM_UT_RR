    "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. — Travelers headed up Mount Hood or driving along any of the Cascade passes should be prepared for potential temporary closures as the system that brought a snow storm to the mountains continues to move along, Oregon transportation officials warned Thursday. “Plan a lot more time for your trip, bring blankets and water and snacks, as well as make sure your vehicle is in well maintained conditions, the lights work, you're fueled up, and you have traction tires or chains,\" said David House, public information officer for Oregon Department of Transportation. “We expect snow on all the passes, today and tonight and through the weekend and into next week,\" House added. He said when chains are required, even if an individual has four-wheel drive or traction tires of any kind, they must still put on chains. With these conditions, House also said drivers are [required to carry chains](https://www.oregon.gov/odot/mct/pages/chains-and-traction-tires.aspx) with them through snow zones, even if they do not need to use them. House said that by Thursday afternoon, plowing had already begun on the passes, including along highways 26, 20, 58, 138 and more. ODOT crews will also be in place around the clock at Parkdale and Government Camp through the week. House said the goal is to keep the highways open for as long as they can, however the weather can be unpredictable. \"If we get a lot of heavy snow really fast, plows can't be everywhere all the time, so that could result in temporary closures,\" said House. “We’re in the stage of, please give a lot of time for your trip and expect the unexpected, just in case we need to do a temporary closure to get the roads in a condition where people can travel.\" \"You just have to know the conditions and what you can drive in, and be aware of that and the other drivers out there as well,\" said David James, who was out camping at Government Camp on Thursday James was excited about the season change. \"I just come up here and just get some of my work done and kind of play in the snow a little bit too,\" he continued. Others, like Dana and Mike Peters, said they drove a different way, because they saw one of the passes was dealing with more snow. \"We were like, 'Nope, we’re going to change plans and we’re going to go over this way,'\" said Dana Peters. \"We’re more fair-weather travelers, so we typically will avoid the mountain passes in the snow, especially in this vehicle,\" said Mike Peters. By Thursday afternoon, there were already around 13 inches of snow on the ground at Timberline Lodge. There's a couple of weather alerts in place already that are set to last until Friday evening. A few feet of snow could also be expected in elevations above 7,000 or 8,000 feet. This is the first big snow storm of the fall season this year.

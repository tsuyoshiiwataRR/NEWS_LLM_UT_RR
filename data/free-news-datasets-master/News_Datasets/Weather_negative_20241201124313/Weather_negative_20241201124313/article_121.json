    "text": "It has been WARM to HOT the last few days\nRecord high temps several days here in NW Ohio , SE Of Toledo Ohio\nNot a fan of bow hunting for deer when it is 75 degrees , with a 30 MPH wind\nSo I took the chance to hunt with a guy I meet online in another forum\nHe has a spot that has Gray and some Fox Squirrels a little over a hour away\nDepending where we hunted , depended what kind of squirrel there was\nEven better there are some melanistic Squirrels that are Black there in some areas\nHe told me I could shoot a limit if I wanted to\nBut Please only shoot 1 of the Black colored Grey Squirrels as he was hoping to let them expand their range\nWell with the wind we hunted in a creek bottom with high ground to the south\nThe direction the wind was coming from\nWell I had the 32 H&R Mag ( used to be 32 S&W ) H&R single shot with a Tasco World Class 3-9x40 scope\n95 gr SWC cast bullets\nPowder coated and pushed to about 1000 FPS with Unique\nStarline cases , CCI SP primers\nThe hunt was easy\nThere was a corn field next to the creek bottom where we hunted\nAbout 1 PM we walked along the edge of the corn field and found spots\nWhere we could see trails coming from the corn field to Maple and White Oak trees\nThe Maple trees had Squirrel boxes in them , so we knew where the squirrels would come from or to\nNot 5 min after sitting down next to a maple tree I saw a young gray squirrel looking at me from a branch\nNot 20 yards away , a easy shot\nWell about 2 hours later I had 5 gray squirrels and had passed up a number of shots\nBut had not seen a Grey / Black Squirrel\nSo we walked a few hundred yards farther along the edge and then dropped down next to the creek\nWell moving was a good idea , a lot less wind\n10 min later I was watching a Black / Gray squirrel hauling a ear of corn toward me\nI waited for it to stop about 25 feet away and go a few feet up a tree trunk looking back the way it had come\nWell I pulled the trigger and I had my limit of 6 squirrels\nI will admit I don't hunt gray squirrels much\nSo judging if they are young or older is tougher for me\nAs 3 of my squirrels will spend some time in the slow cooker as they were not young of the year\nJohn",

    "text": "ALBANY, Ga. (WALB) - The long dry stretch hit day 25 on Halloween. Although it’s perfect for trick or treaters, now SGA soils are abnormally dry according to the latest Drought Monitor released on Thursday. Not only very dry but very warm as temperatures remain about 10-15° above average. Definitely not feeling like fall with highs in the low-mid 80s and lows low-mid 60s.\nA front has entered the region with a line of moderate to heavy rain. It’ll make little progress eastward meaning still no rain for SGA. Rain stays away through the weekend into early week. Meantime the unseasonably warm air pushes highs toward record readings. Election Day likely the warmest with Albany near or possibly tying it’s record high of 87° set in 2003.\nMidweek another front slides east with rain chances returning. Also watching the tropics for possible tropical development in the Gulf of Mexico. Some models are suggesting a push of tropical moisture into the southeast late week. Too early to determine if that’ll pan out but we’re watching. Hurricane season officially ends November 30th.\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction? Let us know.

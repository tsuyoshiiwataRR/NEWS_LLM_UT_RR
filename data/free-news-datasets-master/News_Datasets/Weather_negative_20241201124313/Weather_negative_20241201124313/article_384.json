    "text": "Wet and stormy weekend WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - After a cool and quiet Halloween, expect a milder Friday before a wet weekend. Temperatures across the state will range from the mid 60s to the low 70s this afternoon under mainly sunny skies. Winds will be slightly breezy from the southeast, with gusts up to 25 mph. A storm system to the west will inch closer to the region over the next few days, bringing several rounds of showers and storms across Kansas. The first wave of showers and storms will arrive late tonight into Saturday morning. Additional rounds are expected on Sunday and Monday. Some storms could be strong to possibly severe on Sunday. The main threat would likely be some hail and strong winds. Most of the state will receive measurable rainfall. The heaviest will favor central and eastern Kansas, especially in areas with some of the worst drought conditions. Most of the rain should be out of the area by Election Day, with the middle of the week staying dry before another system takes aim for Kansas late next week, possibly bringing another chance for rain. WICHITA FORECAST: Today: Mostly sunny and milder. Wind: S/SE 10-20. High: 68. Tonight: Increasing clouds, storms arriving after 4AM. Wind: SE 5-10. Low: 54. Tomorrow: Scattered showers and storms throughout the day. Wind: S 10-15. High: 63. Sun: Low: 59. High: 70. Chance for morning and overnight storms; breezy. Mon: Low: 59. High: 67. Cloudy and breezy with scattered storms. Tue: Low: 42. High: 59. Becoming mostly sunny and cooler. Wed: Low: 38. High: 62. Mostly sunny to partly cloudy Thu: Low: 40. High: 60. Partly cloudy.

    "text": "Dry, windy conditions are expected Friday afternoon, bringing with it a brush fire danger.\nThe National Weather Service issued the following Special Weather Statement this morning, urging caution with flammable items outside today.\n…ELEVATED FIRE DANGER TODAY ACROSS PARTS OF EASTERN WEST VIRGINIA, NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VIRGINIA, AND DC METRO AREA…\nElevated potential for the rapid spread of fire is expected this afternoon to early evening due to the combination of dry conditions and gusty winds. Relative humidity values drop to around 25 to 35 percent, along with sustained northwesterly around 15 mph and gusts to 20 to 30 mph. This will result in the rapid drying of fine fuels like grass, leaves, and small shrubs.\nResidents and visitors are urged to exercise caution if handling open flames or equipment that create sparks. Also, dispose of cigarette butts, matches, and other flammable items in appropriate containers. Keep vehicles off of dry grass and obey local burn bans. Most dry grasses, dead leaves, and other tree litter could easily ignite and spread a fire quickly.\nFor more information about wildfire danger, burn restrictions, and wildfire prevention and education, please visit your state’s forestry or environmental protection website.\nWhile there were a few sprinkles around the region this morning, no measurable rain was recorded and thus the D.C. area’s dry streak continues to approach record-breaking territory, according to the Capital Weather Gang .\nDC did not receive measurable rain from these showers so the dry streak lives on and is poised to become the longest on record next week. https://t.co/dPt29kcrPR\n— Capital Weather Gang (@capitalweather) November 1, 2024",

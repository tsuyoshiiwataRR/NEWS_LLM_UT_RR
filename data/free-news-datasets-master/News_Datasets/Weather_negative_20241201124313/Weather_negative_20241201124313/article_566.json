    "text": "Friday is a transition al day weather wise for Southern New England. A cold front will come through in the morning with clouds and the chance of a showers then we clear to sunshine. Due to the morning lows in the 60s, the sunshine will warm us into the 70s for one more day. Much colder air will pour into Southern New England tonight as winds switch to the northwest, ushering colder Canadian air into out region. Overnight lows will drop into the lower 40s. The cold pool of air will be here for the entire weekend and even though there will be ample sunshine, daytime highs will struggle in the 50s. Saturday night into Sunday morning Daylight Saving Time comes to an end and clocks go back an hour. Temperatures will also drop off into the upper-20 and lower-30s, making for a light freeze in many areas. Looking to next week, Monday is looking to be the coldest with highs near 50. A warm front Monday night will bring in clouds and the next chance of showers Monday night. The warm air behind the front will bring back the 70s for midweek.",

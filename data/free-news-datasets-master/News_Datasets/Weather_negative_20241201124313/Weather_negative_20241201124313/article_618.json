    "text": "China's eastern coastal province of Zhejiang has been battered by strong winds and torrential rains as Typhoon Kong-rey is approaching. Typhoon Kong-rey, the 21st typhoon of the year, made landfall on the Taiwan region's Taitung coast at around 14:00 on Thursday before moving across the island and gradually shifting northeast toward the Fujian and Zhejiang coasts. The eastern and northern parts of Zhejiang have experienced a wide range of heavy rainfall starting from Thursday night, with strong rainstorms sweeping Wenzhou, Taizhou and Ningbo cities. The footage filmed on Friday morning showed that the gales and downpours brought by Kong-rey were continuing in some areas of Zhejiang. According to the meteorological authorities, Kong-rey is currently a tropical storm with a wind speed of 75 to 88 kilometers per hour. The typhoon is expected to move to the east-north direction at a speed of about 25 kilometers per hour, with little change in intensity, before making a landfall or sideswipe on the coast from Wenzhou to Taizhou before turning northeast. In the affected areas of Zhejiang, the waterborne projects under construction have been suspended, the seaside scenic spots have been closed, and marine workers have been relocated to safe places. Local emergency rescue and repair crews have been mobilized and on standby, while disaster relief supplies have been prepared.",

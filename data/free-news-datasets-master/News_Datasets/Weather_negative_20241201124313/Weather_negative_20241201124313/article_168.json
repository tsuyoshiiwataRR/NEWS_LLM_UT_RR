    "text": "Heavy downpours expected to cause flooding in central Viet Nam The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has just issued Official Letter No. 8220/BNN-DD dated October 31, 2024 requesting central ministries, branches and 13 provinces and cities from Nghe An to Khanh Hoa, Gia Lai and Kon Tum to proactively respond to upcoming heavy rains and floods. |Lifeboats and rescue vehicles have been transported to Hoa Khanh Nam Ward, Lien Chieu District, Da Nang to be ready to respond to heavy rain and deep flooding. Photo: HOANG HIEP| According to National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, localities in central Viet Nam may experience heavy rains from November 3 to 10, 2024 due to bad weather phenomena. The meteorologist also noted that after November 10, 2024, heavy rain in the central region will continue to be complicated, with the potential for 2-3 more spells of heavy rainfall that will probably worsen the flooding in the region. In the second half of November and early December 2024, rain will be concentrated in the provinces and cities from Quang Binh to Phu Yen. To proactively respond to the development of heavy rain and floods in the coming days, and minimise damage, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development requests provinces, cities and ministries and branches to urgently overcome the consequences of storm No. 6, especially in the provinces and cities of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue and Da Nang. Heed will be on proactively harvesting early aquaculture and agricultural production with the motto \"green at home is better than old in the field\". At the same time, forces will be ready to evacuate people in areas at risk of deep flooding, flash floods, and landslides to safer places. Means of transport, equipment, and essential supplies will be well-prepared according to the motto 'four-on-the-spot' to be ready to respond to all situations. In addition, the developments of natural disasters will be informed to authorities at all levels and people to proactively prevent and respond. Ministries and sectors, according to their functions, will proactively coordinate with localities to review plans to ensure safety and effectiveness in response to flood developments.

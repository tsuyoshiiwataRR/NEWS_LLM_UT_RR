    "text": "American rock band Guns N’ Roses may have famously sung about the cold November rain, but here it will be warm, with thundery showers, for the next two weeks.\nModerate to heavy rain is expected over parts of the island in the afternoon on most days during this period, with the showers possibly extending into the night on a few days, the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) said in a weather advisory on Nov 1.\nThis is because of prevailing inter-monsoon conditions – characterised by light and variable winds and higher lightning activity – here and in the surrounding region.\nAlso, Sumatra squalls may bring widespread thundery showers, accompanied by gusty winds, on one or two mornings. The total rainfall for the first fortnight of November is forecast to be above average over most parts of the island.\nThe daily maximum temperatures will likely range between 32 deg C and 34 deg C on most days, and may slightly exceed 34 deg C on a few days, MSS said.\nThis contrasts with Singapore’s weather in the last two weeks, which have been warmer and drier than the previous fortnight.\nSingapore Less rain, warmer days in second half of Oct Oct 17, 2024 Related Stories Comet makes rare appearance in cloudy Singapore skies PUB issues islandwide flood risk alerts due to heavy rain Thundery showers expected in first half of October Daily maximum temperatures in the last two weeks of October rose above 34 deg C on most days, with the highest recorded being 35.6 deg C in Paya Lebar on Oct 21.\nBelow-average rainfall was recorded during this period, with short thundery showers over parts of the island in the late morning and afternoon on some days. But moderate to heavy rain fell over northern and western Singapore on Oct 16.\nGet The New Paper on your phone with the free TNP app. Download from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store now",

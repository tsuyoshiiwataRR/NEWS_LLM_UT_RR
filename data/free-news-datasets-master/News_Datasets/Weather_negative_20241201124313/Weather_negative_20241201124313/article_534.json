    "text": "FIRST ALERT WEATHER: A rainy start to November HAZARD, Ky. (WYMT)—After a record-high temperature of 80 degrees on Halloween, the beginning of November is a bit closer to normal. Rain will continue to push east through the morning, leaving skies overcast into the afternoon. Temperatures this afternoon will get into the mid-60s. By the evening hours, the clouds will break giving way to a clear night for high school football. Temperatures overnight will dip into the 40s before warming up again for Saturday. HEADLINES: - November Begins - Rainy Morning/Clear Evening - A Cooler Friday DISCUSSION: An above-average weekend is expected with low 70s temperatures expected for Saturday. Sunday temperatures climb into the mid to high 80s where temperatures will sit into Election Day. A cold front late Tuesday could impact Election night by bringing a chance of showers. However, the showers look to move into the area after midnight. Wednesday and Thursday look to have low 70s and high 60s temperatures with rain chances for both days. The rain over the next week will be beneficial after the driest October in recorded history for Eastern Kentucky. November looks to end its first week with more rain days than all of October combined. LOOKING AHEAD: Above-average temperatures will continue into the beginning of the third week of November with temperatures still sitting in the high 60s and low 70s. Rain chances remain near normal for the beginning of November. Drought has returned to Eastern Kentucky with a majority of the viewing area returning to abnormally dry status. This week’s rain could help improve these conditions before another period of dry weather.

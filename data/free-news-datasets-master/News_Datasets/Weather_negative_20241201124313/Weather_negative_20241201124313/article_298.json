    "text": "This doesn't seem to have gotten quite the attention here that it probably deserves yet, but thanks to a climate-enhanced Depresi√≥n Aislada en Niveles Altos (DANA, a Spanish phrase that translates to an atmospheric high level isolated depression) that parked itself over the eastern Spanish province of Valencia Tuesday night, up to 20 inches of rain fell in just 8 hours -- leading to the most catastrophic flash flooding in Spain in at least a century, with an official death toll of at least 158 thus far and many others still unaccounted for. From Live Science: DANAs are intensified versions of what's known as a \"cold drop,\" which occurs when a mass of warm air collides with a stagnant mass of cold air at an altitude of around 29,500 feet (9,000 meters). In the upper atmosphere, there is a very strong wind current that surrounds Earth like a belt. Sometimes, this current begins to oscillate, appearing more like a snake than a belt. When this happens, the oscillation can get \"stuck,\" enabling the mass of cold air to remain in one place. On this occasion, it happened over southeast Spain. DANAs are intensified versions of what's known as a \"cold drop,\" which occurs when a mass of warm air collides with a stagnant mass of cold air at an altitude of around 29,500 feet (9,000 meters). While DANAs aren't all that uncommon in the western Mediterranean, what helped make this particular downpour so disastrous is the record high temperature of the Mediterranean itself (though still relatively mild compared to places like the Red Sea or the Gulf of Mexico) coupled with a two-year-long drought in Spain that had parched the soil and made flash flooding all the more likely. The scenes of chaos and destruction left behind are almost too bizzare to believe -- with numerous cars left piled atop one another like toppled Dominoes or someone's demented art installation: Yet another reminder (as if any were really needed at this point) that the world is rapidly running out of time to address the growing threat of global warming and climate chaos.",

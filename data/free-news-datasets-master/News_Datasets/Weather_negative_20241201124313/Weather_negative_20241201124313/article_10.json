    "text": "AFP – Super Typhoon Kong-rey made landfall in Taiwan yesterday as one of the biggest storms to hit in decades, whipping up 10-metre waves, triggering floods and claiming at least one life. Packing maximum wind speeds of 184 kilometres per hour (kph), Kong-rey slammed into eastern Taiwan yesterday afternoon, the Central Weather Administration said. It was the same strength as Typhoon Gaemi, which was the most powerful storm to hit Taiwan in eight years when it made landfall in July, but Kong-rey’s radius of 320 kilometres made it the biggest in nearly three decades. Scientists have warned climate change is increasing the intensity of storms, leading to heavier rains and flash floods and stronger gusts. “Its impact on all of Taiwan will be quite severe,” Chu Mei-lin from the Central Weather Administration warned. Work and schools across Taiwan were suspended yesterday as people hunkered down ahead of the storm. One person was killed when a falling tree crushed her vehicle yesterday in Nantou, the National Fire Agency said. Another 73 have been injured in the wild weather. “This typhoon feels very strong,” 52-year-old office worker Kevin Lin told AFP. “I’m used to the many typhoons in Taiwan and I don’t feel scared.” Wind and rain intensified after the eye of the typhoon passed, an official at the fire department told AFP, with reports of toppled power poles and trees in the coastal town. There was “very serious” flooding in Hualien County, Hualian Fire Department Chief Wang Ming-chung said, with rescues and evacuations still under way. “We are also handling incidents of falling signboards hitting people and fallen trees on the roads,” Wang told AFP. Kong-rey was expected to weaken after hitting land and then move across the mountains before exiting over the strait in the evening, Chu said. But she warned that the storm would “severely” affect all day and into the early hours of today. Authorities managed to contact two Czech tourists who were hiking in Taroko Gorge in Hualien and could not be reached by satellite or mobile phone on Wednesday.",

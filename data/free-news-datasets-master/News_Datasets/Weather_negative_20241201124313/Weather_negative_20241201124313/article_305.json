Spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi has urged residents to take precautions. “Extremely hot temperatures expected in most parts of the City of Johannesburg over this weekend. Residents are urged to stay hydrated, drink lots of water and stay away from direct sunlight between 11am and 3pm in the afternoon. “Those who are working directly in the sunlight are urged to take regular breaks and the elderly who are on medication to stay in cool areas because exposure to this extremely hot temperatures can lead to heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke,“ Mulaudzi said. Mulaudzi said they will remain on high alert for any eventuality during the scorching weather conditions. “When the temperatures are extremely high, humans’ ability to cool their bodies through sweating is reduced. “This can be a real threat that leads to hyperthermia. In an extremely hot environment, the most serious health and safety concern is heat stroke. Heat stroke can be fatal if medical attention is not available immediately.” ALSO READ: Natural disasters set to increase by 37% globally by 2025 – Report For those who will be tempted to swim to cool off the heat, here are some of the safety tips “Stay safe around water during this period of heat wave, for any life-threatening emergencies immediately call our Emergency Services Call Centre on 011 375 5911,” Mulaudzi said.

    "text": "Intense winds and an abrupt drop in humidity forecast for Sunday and Monday throughout the Inland Empire prompted the National Weather Service Friday to issue a Fire Weather Watch for the region.\nThe watch will be in effect from 7 p.m. Sunday to 6 p.m. Monday.\n“An upper level low pressure system is expected to dig into the Great Basin Sunday,” the NWS said in a statement. “This is expected to bring a swift shift in winds from onshore to offshore. Gusty northeasterly winds are expected in … the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains and below the Cajon Pass into the Inland Empire.”\nWinds are likely to be highest in and around mountains and in desert locations, the Weather Service said.\n“Peak gusts for the western portions of the San Bernardino Mountains and the Cajon Pass into the Inland Empire will be 35 to 45 mph,” the agency stated. “Dry conditions are expected to accompany these winds, bringing elevated fire weather conditions. Periods of critical fire weather are expected for portions of the … Inland Empire.”\nThe relative humidity is slated to drop below 20% Sunday.\nThe wind surge will trail the remnants of a trough of low pressure forecast to sweep just north of the region. Meteorologists had earlier predicted that the low would sink well to the south, generating appreciable rain on Saturday, but the weather pattern has since changed.\n“Shower coverage for places west of the mountains will be fairly isolated, with a tenth of an inch or less of rainfall expected,” the NWS said. “Coastal slopes of the mountains will have the potential to see the greatest amounts, with .25-.50 inches currently forecast. Deserts may see some light showers, but little to no accumulation is expected. Snow showers will be very light, below a half- inch for areas above 6,000 feet.”\nFor this weekend, high temperatures in the Riverside metropolitan area will hover just below 70, with overnight lows in the mid 40s, while going into early next week, the daytime mercury will climb only slightly.\nIn the Coachella Valley, the highs Saturday and Sunday will reach the upper 70s, with lows in the mid 50s, while for early next week, low 80s are possible during the day, with lows around 55.\nThe temperature band in the Temecula Valley will be virtually identical to Riverside metro.\nAfter Saturday, there’s no precipitation in the forecast region-wide for the next seven days.",

    "text": "Tourists in Bali this weekend are warned of dangerous weather conditions that are forecast for the coming days.\nThe forecast through to 2nd November shows potential for extreme weather, including flooding, high waves, and strong winds.\nThe warnings are especially important for those planning to travel by boat.\nThe Denpasar Metrology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) has issued weather warnings through to 2nd November as a series of convective clouds gather over the province, triggering heavy rainfall.\nThe Head of BKMG Bali, Cahyo Nughoro, told reporters, “The public is advised to remain alert to the impacts of extreme weather such as water logging flooding, landslides and fallen trees.”\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Balai Besar MKG Wilayah III (@bmkgbali)\nHe added, “Fishermen and marine tourism operators must be aware of the potential for increased wind speeds and the highest sea waves that can reach two meters in Bali waters.”\nBoat operators have been warned that windspeed could reach 36 kilometers an hour. Heavy rain is forecast for Tabanan, Badung, Gianyar, Klungkung, Bangli, and Denpasar Regency.\nThese are all home to some of Bali’s biggest tourist resorts, including Sanur, Nusa Dua, Uluwatu, Jimbaran, Kuta, Legian, Seminyak, Canggu, Ubud, and the Nusa Islands.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Balai Besar MKG Wilayah III (@bmkgbali)\nMotorcycle drivers have been warned to avoid driving in the rain and to be extra mindful of falling trees and branches.\nA motorcycle driver in Jembrana Regency has already received hospital treatment as a tree fell on them while they were driving.\nFallen trees have also caused traffic delays across the province, with more expected to fall over the weekend and more traffic to build up.\nThe Head of the Emergency Logistics Team at the Jemrbana Regency Natural Disaster Management Agency, Nyoman Winata, told reporters, “We urge all people to remain vigilant and careful when driving in the midst of extreme weather.”\n“Avoid driving when it rains heavily and is accompanied by strong winds, and it is recommended not to take shelter under large trees because there may be a potential for trees to fall.”\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Kantor SAR Denpasar (@basarnas_bali)\nOn Wednesday night and early Thursday morning, dozens of Denpasar residents experienced serious damage to their rooftops as strong winds hit the capital city.\nTourists planning on marine tourism experiences such as snorkeling, diving, or island hopping, as well as surfing and swimming, are advised to heed the warnings of the Bali, especially in areas like Seminyak, Canggu, Uluwatu, and Nusa Dua, all areas of the coast known to have powerful and unpredictable currents, even when weather conditions are placid.\nThe Bali Search and Rescue team has tragically confirmed that on Thursday, 31st October, they recovered the body of a student from West Java off the coast of Nusa Penida. The student, who was believed to be visiting Bali with friends, was pulled out by the strong current at Kelingking Beach on Nusa Penida.\nGede Suastra, from the Bali Search and Rescue Alert Unit, told reporters, “The victim was found dead in a westerly direction from the location of the incident, Around 200m from the shore.”\nThe 17-year-old student and eight friends had been swimming off Kelingking Beach when the tragedy took place.\nSuastra told reporters, “Suddenly, a big wave came and swept them away. The other friends managed to save themselves while the victim was lost and swept away by the current.”\nDespite a rapid response from the Bali Search and Rescue Response Team, there was little more that could have been done to save the student’s life.\nSuastra told reporters, “I would like to thank all Search and Rescue elements involved in the search effort; I also express my condolences to the victim’s family for this incident. Hopefully, this incident will not happen again.”\nHe called on all beach visitors to pay active attention to the safety signage in place across Bali’s coastlines.\nSwimming at Nusa Penida’s Kelingking Beach and Diamond Beach is highly advised against due to the ever-increasing amount of tourist deaths reported from the area.\nRemove All Ads & Unlock All Articles… Sign up for The Bali Sun Premium\nPlan Your Bali Holiday:\nBook The Best English Speaking Drivers For Airport Transfers & Tours\nChoose From Thousands of Bali Hotels, Resorts, and Hostels with Free Cancellation On Most Properties\nBook Cheap Flights To Bali\nDon’t Forget Travel Insurance That Covers Medical Expenses In Bali",

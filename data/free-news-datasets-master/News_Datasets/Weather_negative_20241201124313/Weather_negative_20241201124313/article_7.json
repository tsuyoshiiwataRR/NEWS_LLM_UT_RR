    "text": "Potential Caribbean Disturbances Forecasters are warning of possible new storm threats in the Caribbean as the historically severe Atlantic hurricane season nears its conclusion this week. AccuWeather reports that this season has already inflicted significant damage, with estimates for storms Helene and Milton approaching $100 billion. The forecast indicates that heavy rainfall expected across the Caribbean could lead to dangerous conditions, including flash floods and mudslides, irrespective of whether a tropical storm develops from the disturbances.\nAccording to Alex DaSilva, AccuWeather’s Lead Hurricane Expert, the current water temperatures in the mid-80s are slightly above seasonal norms, providing a favorable environment for storm formation. He highlighted two potential disturbances in the western and central Caribbean that have a “high chance” of evolving into a tropical depression or storm in early November. “The water temperatures are very warm, and we are expecting that the wind shear will be relatively low,” DaSilva explained, expressing confidence that something will develop in these conditions.\nImpact on the Southeastern U.S. Historically, storms during this time of year tend to move out to sea. However, forecasters caution that one storm could track towards Florida, potentially impacting the Carolinas as well. DaSilva noted that this scenario is plausible, particularly around Election Day, which is 10 to 14 days away. “Still way out there, but we will be watching it,” he stated, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance.\nWeather Outlook for Halloween While storm threats loom in the south, the Northeast is set to enjoy pleasant weather for Halloween festivities, with warm and dry conditions expected. DaSilva anticipates that temperature records may be challenged or broken across the region. Forecasts suggest that Boston could reach a high of 78 degrees, New York may see 75 degrees, and Philadelphia could experience temperatures around 80 degrees on Halloween day .\nIn contrast, a cold front moving eastward may bring the risk of showers and thunderstorms from Ohio and Michigan down to Louisiana and Texas. Meanwhile, the Central Plains, Rockies, and Southeast are expected to remain dry. However, a storm system approaching the Pacific Northwest could lead to “breezy and raw” weather, characterized by chilly temperatures and periods of rain. Overall, while storm threats continue during the season, many areas will also experience favorable conditions for outdoor activities.",

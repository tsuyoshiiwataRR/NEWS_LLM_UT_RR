    "text": "WEATHER BLOG: Weekend looking wet along with Monday Chiefs game, enjoy outside plans Friday\nNow is the time to prepare for a three-day span of First Alert Weather Impact Days that will begin on Saturday and stretch through Monday.\nIf you've got outdoor plans, Friday is going to be the best day to get them done.\nScattered light rain showers are likely Saturday afternoon and evening. Heavier bouts of rain and a few thunderstorms are likely Saturday night through much of Sunday morning. Plan on rainy impacts for your church and brunch plans. Areas of light rain will remain possible for the remainder of Sunday afternoon and evening.\n[Click here to track radar]\nThe next bout of heavier rain and thunderstorms will sweep in Monday afternoon through Monday night. If you are going to the Kansas City Chiefs game, plan on dressing to stay warm and dry as rain is likely during tailgating and at least part of the game. The potential of lightning could result in a delay of game.\nWidespread rainfall amounts will likely exceed 2\" with the potential for up to 6\" in a few spots. There is no risk of severe weather on Saturday or Sunday, however the First Alert Weather Team is monitoring the potential of severe weather just south and east of Kansas City on Monday.\nA few light showers may linger through early Tuesday morning, but the remainder of the morning and afternoon will remain dry with no weather impediments on Election Day.",

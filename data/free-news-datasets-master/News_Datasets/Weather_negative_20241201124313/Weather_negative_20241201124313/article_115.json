    "text": "MADRID - The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) on Thursday accepted the petition of La Liga to postpone all of the weekend matches involving clubs from the region of Valencia, which has been affected by devastating floods that have so-far claimed 104 lives. The top flight games between Villarreal and Rayo Vallecano, Valencia and Real Madrid, and the second division matches between Levante and Malaga, Castellon versus Racing Santander and Eldense against Huesca, have all been postponed until a later date.

    "text": "Incredible vision shows a gustnado rip through the Brisbane River as a dangerous storm cell moved over the city this afternoon. The vortex appeared very similar to a tornado, shocking onlookers. Those in the open were forced to seek shelter as it skimmed across the Brisbane River. The US National Weather Service describes a gustnado as a small whirlwind that forms during thunderstorms. The storm formed early this afternoon in Boonah before tracking north-east and bringing with it wild winds and hail up to six centimetres in size. South-east suburbs copped a lashing as the hail blanketed backyards and roads, forcing residents to run for cover. At Kangaroo Point, the storm uprooted a massive tree that came tumbling down. It also tore down branches from several other trees. The weather delayed domestic and international flights in and out of Brisbane airports. The extent of the damage across the south-east is not yet known but authorities warn it won't be the last of the wild weather as the high-risk season begins. \"We are the most disaster prone state in Australia so we need to be prepared,\" State Disaster Coordinator Shane Chelepy said.",

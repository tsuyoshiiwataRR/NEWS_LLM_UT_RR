    "text": "The warning was for Carbon, Monroe, Berks, Lehigh, Northampton and Bucks counties.\n\"Winds are starting to diminish with relative humidity levels rising as temperatures cool after sunset,\" says the National Weather Service.\nWhat does a red flag warning indicate?\nA red flag warning implies that either extreme fire weather conditions are currently taking place or will occur shortly, according to the weather service. Warm temperatures, very low humidities, and stronger winds are expected to combine to produce an increased risk of fire to spread rapidly.\nSo, what steps should you follow during a red flag warning?\nDuring a red flag warning, it is crucial to exercise extreme caution and be prepared to take immediate action in case a fire starts. The weather service offers these steps you can take to lower the risk of fires igniting and ensure your safety:\n1. Bolster burn barrel safety:\n- In areas where controlled burning is sanctioned, make certain that burn barrels sport a weighty metal cover, equipped with holes no larger than 3/4 of an inch.\n2. Mindful disposal of smoking materials:\n- Steer clear of haphazardly discarding lit cigarette butts and avoid flinging cigarettes or matches from moving vehicles. These innocuous-seeming actions can kindle dry vegetation, potentially spawning a wildfire.\n3. Properly extinguish outdoor fires:\n- To prevent inadvertent fires, diligently douse all outdoor fires. Quench them with a copious deluge of water and stir to guarantee complete cooling. Submerge charcoal until it's thoroughly bereft of residual heat. Never depart from live charcoal unattended.\n4. Never leave fires unattended:\n- Avoid abandoning any fire without supervision. Even minor sparks or drifting embers can incite nearby foliage or grass, setting off a rapidly spreading fire.\nUnderstanding the gravity of a red flag warning and adhering to these precautions is pivotal in mitigating the risk of wildfires during these perilous conditions. Prioritize safety, stay well-informed, and act responsibly to safeguard lives and property.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.",

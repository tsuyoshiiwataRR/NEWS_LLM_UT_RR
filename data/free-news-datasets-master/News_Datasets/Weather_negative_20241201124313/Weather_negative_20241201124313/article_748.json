    "text": "Namwater suspended the process of drawing water for irrigation from the Hardap Dam on Thursday.\nThis is due to low levels of water in the dam attributed to drought, said NamWater spokesperson Lot Ndamanomhata in a media statement on Thursday.\n“This decision, however, does not affect the drinking water supply to the Mariental municipality or surrounding communities,” he said.\nAccording to Ndamanomhata, the measure aligns with NamWater’s commitment to secure water reserves for essential use, including potable and livestock needs.\nIt ensures adequate supply until the projected dry run date of February 2026, he added.\n“Recent consultations and analysis were undertaken with stakeholders to assess the availability of ‘dead storage’ water, allowing irrigation water supply through October 2024. Beyond this point, remaining reserves will be prioritised for human consumption and livestock needs.”\nNamWater recognises the critical need for water conservation during these times and encourages all Namibians to save water, especially as the\nHardap Dam levels remain under pressure, noted Ndamanomhata.\n“We reassure residents that this move is a proactive approach to managing the region’s water resources responsibly.”\nHe said NamWater will continue to monitor the situation closely.\n“We remain committed to balancing the needs of agricultural producers, residents and the local economy,” he added.",

    "text": "By DPA ,\n41 minutes ago\nOvernight storms have triggered floods and landslides in south-western Norway, local media reported on Friday, the latest country in Europe to be hit by severe weather.\nThe rainfall subsided on Friday morning, meteorologist Julie Solsvik VÃ¥gane told broadcaster NRK, but flood and landslide warnings remain in place.\nSo far no one has been reported missing or injured due to the storms, according to police.\nAccess to the town of Odda - home to some 5,000 people some 60 kilometres south-east of Bergen - was cut off on Friday morning after a bridge collapsed. All other access roads to the town were closed due to the storms.\nThe mayor of Odda described the situation as \"dramatic\" when speaking to news agency NTB on Thursday evening.\nA cellar belonging to the historic Hotel Ullensvang north of Odda was flooded overnight, NRK reported. Numerous antiques and works of art were said to be stored in the hotel's basement.\nOn Friday afternoon, the storm had moved on to Sweden. The Swedish meteorological service warned of strong winds with local squalls, especially in the south and east of the country.\nSeveral train connections were suspended, and at times more than 12,000 households in southern Sweden were affected by power outages, electricity provider E.ON said.\nIt comes after more than 200 people were killed by devastating floods in Spain earlier this week, with dozens still missing.",

    "text": "The first storm system of the fall is expected to bring rainfall and strong winds to the High Desert and mountains over the weekend. The storm will move into Southern California Saturday night, bringing light rainfall and strong winds at about 35 mph through Sunday, the National Weather Service reported. Most of the rain is expected in Lucerne Valley, Hesperia, and the San Bernardino Mountains. Apple Valley may get a few sprinkles. A fire weather watch will be in effect from Sunday evening through Monday afternoon due to strong gusty winds and low relative humidity levels in western portions of the San Bernardino Mountains and portions of the Inland Empire, mainly the Cajon Pass, weather officials stated. Average high temperatures Saturday through Monday are expected to range from 60 to 65 in places like Adelanto, Apple Valley, Hesperia, and Victorville. Clear skies with high temps in the high 60s are expected in Barstow and Las Vegas. The weather service reminds residents that Daylight Saving Time ends at 2 a.m. PST. Sunday, Nov. 3, as we “fall back” one hour. Daily Press reporter Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at RDeLaCruz@VVDailyPress.com. Follow him on X @DP_ReneDeLaCruz",

    "text": "Abnormal weather in Kyiv region: rivers remain low despite heavy rains Kyiv • UNN In October, the temperature in Kyiv region exceeded the norm by 1.1-2.3°C, and precipitation reached 60-110% of the norm. Despite significant rainfall, water levels in rivers are critically low, at only 7-17% of normal. In October, the Kyiv region was 1.1-2.3°C warmer than normal, with rains at the beginning of the month bringing 60-110% of the normal rainfall, and 168% in the Ros River basin. Despite this, water levels remained low, with most rivers at 7-17% of normal. This is reported by the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Center, UNN reports. Details October 2024 was marked by abnormally warm weather in Kyiv region: the average temperature was 1.1-2.3 °C above normal. Although precipitation mostly fell at the beginning of the month and amounted to 60-110% of normal, in particular in the Ros River basin, the amount of rain reached 168% of normal, the water level in the rivers rose only slightly. Despite the rains, most of the rivers in Kyiv region remained low, with water levels of only 7-17% of their normal levels. For example, on the Teteriv River, the average monthly water flow was below the ecological norm, indicating a serious decrease in water resources. On the Ros River, the water situation is also worrisome: in the upper reaches it was 68% of normal, in the middle reaches, near the Fesyura gauging station, it was 30%, and in the lower reaches, near Korsun-Shevchenkivske, it was only 11% of normal.

    "text": "NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - Rain chances are set to linger into your Friday as a weakening frontal boundary dissipates over the area.\nNow heavy rains have continued overnight leading to as much as 6-9â€³ of rain, mainly in St. Tammany Parish. The wet roads and possible flooding could slow you down as you get started this morning so give yourself some extra time heading into work.\nThrough the morning I do expected the overnight rains to weaken but as daytime heating kicks in this afternoon, a reformation of showers and downpours will be possible. Our coverage of rain will remain elevated for one more day.\nThis weekend we revert back to more sun and warm/humid conditions. Highs will jump back to the middle 80s with a humid breeze blowing in from the Gulf.\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story? Click Here to report it.

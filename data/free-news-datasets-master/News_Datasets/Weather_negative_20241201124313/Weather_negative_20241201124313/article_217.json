    "text": "Typhoon Kong-rey remains a significant threat to Fujian, with heavy rainfall affecting local communities. Kong-rey, the 21st typhoon of the year, made landfall on Taiwan's Taitung coast around 14:00 on Thursday before gradually shifting northeast toward Fujian and Zhejiang coasts while weakening to a tropical storm. In Tailu Township, the area in Fujian closest to the typhoon's center, fishermen are worried about the safety of their aquaculture rafts and eager to return to them. Authorities have been actively monitoring the situation to prevent any dangerous returns to sea. In preparation for the heavy rainfall, local departments in Lianjiang County have already cleared flood-prone areas and relocated residents from geological hazard zones. To further ensure safety, Lianjiang has mobilized over 80 rescue teams to address any emergencies that may arise. The China Railway Nanchang Group, the administration taking charge of the railway network within the provinces of Jiangxi and Fujian, has responded to the typhoon's impact by suspending several coastal railway lines in Fujian and raising its emergency response to Level II. Train services have been adjusted to maintain passenger safety while accommodating travel needs. \"We have added six manual ticketing windows to assist passengers in processing refunds and changes,\" said Lin Peng, a staff member of the Xiamen Railway Station. Additionally, the National Meteorological Center has issued warnings for heavy rainfall across parts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, highlighting the increased risk of urban flooding and geological disasters in those areas, as Typhoon Kong-rey is moving northeast towards coasts of Zhejiang.",

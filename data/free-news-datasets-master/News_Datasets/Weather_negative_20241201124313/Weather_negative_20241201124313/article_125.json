    "text": "The region, home to popular tourist cities and beaches, is likely to face significant rainfall starting from Nov. 3 and continuing until Nov. 10 due to a complex combination of adverse weather factors, including a low-pressure zone in the southern and central parts of the East Sea, continuous cold air surges, and a strong easterly wind belt at altitudes of 1,500-5,000 meters, said Mai Van Khiem, director of the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting. \"This is a typical weather pattern that brings extremely heavy rain to central Vietnam, with large-scale flooding above the level three in the northern and central provinces of the region, widespread inundation, flash floods, and landslides in mountainous areas,\" he said. A level-three warning, the highest flood alarm level in Vietnam, signals major floods, posing serious risks to lives, property, and livelihoods. Khiem forecasted that the upcoming heavy rain would impact areas from Ha Tinh to Phu Yen provinces, which include Da Nang and Hoi An ancient town. After Nov. 10, the central region could see an additional couple rounds of heavy rain throughout the month. Khiem noted that heavy rains in late October have filled reservoirs and saturated the soil, which could lead to severe flooding, high risks of flash floods and landslides. Following Storm Trami, which made landfall in central Thua Thien-Hue Province and its neighbor Da Nang last Sunday, central Vietnam has experienced significant rainfall, causing widespread flooding in Quang Binh Province, where 12 fatalities have been reported.",

With the heavy rainfall expected, drivers could see flooded-out roads.\nIf you do see floodwaters, don't drive into it and instead turn around. When water is over a road, you don't know how deep it is or if the road is even still there.\nParents and guardians should also remind children that it's dangerous to play near flooding creeks or moving water. Just two inches of rushing water is enough to sweep an adult off their feet.\nSome events that were scheduled for this weekend in the Oklahoma City metro, such as Cycle 66 in Edmond and the DÃ­a de los Muertos event, have already been canceled or postponed due to the anticipated weather.\nBe sure to download the KOCO 5 App to receive customized weather alerts. You can watch our team coverage on the app, too.\n>> Check Live, Interactive Radar\n>> Download the KOCO 5 App on iPhone\n>> Download the KOCO 5 App on Android\n>> Stream KOCO 5 weather updates anytime on the Very Local app",

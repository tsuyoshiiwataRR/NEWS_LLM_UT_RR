    "text": "Yukon’s capital, Whitehorse, received an unexpected and substantial snowfall, with accumulations ranging from 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 inches), which began on October 30, following a series of large snowfalls earlier that month.\nResidents cleared driveways and sidewalks in response to the heavy snowfall, while city transportation staff sanded and plowed roadways.\nOn October 30, Wednesday morning, nearly all of Whitehorse’s 44 school buses were in operation, except for three that couldn’t leave their parking areas due to heavy snowfall. Despite delays, all students arrived safely.\nSurrounding towns, including Carmacks and different highways across the territory, also experienced severe snowfall, prompting travel advisories due to hazardous driving conditions.\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the snowfall had eased, and Environment Canada lifted the snowfall warning initially issued on Tuesday.\nTo this October 30 2024 at 6 am in Whitehorse Yukon pic.twitter.com/KXQk04TV8I\n— Windy101🇨🇦🇺🇸🇺🇦🐾🐾🐾 (@hey_butter) October 30, 2024 Winter Storm Warning for Whitehorse Yukon #ytstorm pic.twitter.com/rxJx7IhJnQ\n— Brandon Houck ⚡️ (@HouckisPokisewx) October 29, 2024 “We’re still gathering the data at this moment, but I would be surprised if there weren’t any records broken,” said Ken Dosanjh, a meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.\n“15 cm (6 inches) in Whitehorse, up to 20 cm (8 inches) in Carmacks — so definitely a notable event for sure, especially, you know, as we still haven’t even hit November.”\nThe current weather patterns in the Yukon are attributed to a low-pressure system, which has brought moist air, leading to heavy snowfall.\nWhile October snow is not unusual in Yukon, the volume and frequency of snowfall this year are unexpected and may set new records for the month.\nBobbie Milnes, the territory’s director of transportation maintenance, said, “I think we were prepared. We had trucks ready in all of our areas, and we did hit our goals in terms of season readiness,” he said.\n“We work until the work is done. So the main focus is keeping the roads clear and safe for the public.”\nThe city’s response involved deploying all available resources to clear roads and maintain safety for residents, while the transportation department emphasized the importance of being prepared for winter conditions.\n“I’d say we’re past the brunt of it,” Dosanjh said. “I’m not seeing too many large-scale events, at least for the next week.”\nLocal officials continue to monitor conditions, urging caution for drivers and residents as they adapt to the ongoing winter challenges.\nReferences:\n1 Zero visibility reported on some Yukon highways amid heavy snowfall – Yukon News – October 30, 2024\n2 Whitehorse digs out after another heavy dump of October snow – CBC – October 31, 2024",

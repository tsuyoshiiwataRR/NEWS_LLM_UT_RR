    "text": "The DANA that has affected different Spanish municipalities continued to be the main topic of debate on Thursday night television shows, as in 59 seconds with Gemma Nierga .\nMonica Lopez director of the Meteorology area of RTVE came to the set to clarify what they could or could not predict from organizations like AEMET . “The models they gave a lot of precipitation that means more than 180 liters per square meter, but more than 600 fell “he explained.\n“Meteorology gives us the tools to know that it can rain a lot, but not exactly how much “, he added. In addition, an unusual phenomenon occurred on the Magro River in Valencia. “A train of storms formed,” he stated.\nThe intervener explained what that was: “It’s a path of storms . A storm, due to its own dynamics, releases cold air, which is used by a second storm to form, and so on. I had never seen him in my life, lasted more than 12 hours “.\n“The way in which the population was notified was not correct,” he criticized. This opinion was added Nieves Sanchez president of the College of Geologists of Madrid: “The mobile alert arrived after 8:00 p.m. “.\nIn this way, he proposed a new reflection for those people who have the power to execute. “The precautionary principle is the first thing to apply, There must be protocols to avoid deaths and catastrophe, everything should have been clearer from the first hour of the day, and even from the night before,” he stated.\n#Mónica #López #director #RTVE #Meteorology #area #DANA #life",

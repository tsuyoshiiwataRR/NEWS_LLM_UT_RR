    "text": "Photo: WBZ NewsRadio\nLYNN, Mass. (WBZ NewsRadio) — Red flag warnings were issued across Massachusetts on Friday because of extremely dry conditions across the state.\nThe red flag warnings come as residents in Lynn and surrounding communities try to get rid of the smell of smoke from their homes as brush fires continue to burn in the area.\nThe affected counties include Middlesex, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Plymouth.\n“I woke up yesterday morning and I thought my house was on fire, but it was the heavy smoke,” said one resident.\n“It was scary breathing in all that smoke, too close to home,” said another resident.\nFirefighters on the North Shore are continuing to fight fires and are working to prevent any more hot spots from getting out of control.\nRead More: Boston Hilton Workers Ratify New Union Contract\nThe Boston region is in a state of severe drought, with a lack of rainfall creating dry conditions that haven’t been seen in the area in about two years.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, a Red Flag Warning means the combination of temperatures, very low humidities, and stronger winds could produce an increased risk of fire danger.\nThe Red Flag warnings will be in effect until 7 p.m. on Friday.\nWBZ NewsRadio’s James Rojas ( @JamesRojasMMJ ) reports.\nFollow WBZ NewsRadio: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | iHeartmedia App | TikTok",

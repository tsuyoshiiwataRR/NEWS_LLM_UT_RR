    "text": "Mother nature beat Uncle Sam, in the town of Norway, back in July. \"Part of our metal roof peeled back, literally, and air got in, took this roof here, picked it up like drew it up because of the force of the wind, and dropped,\" said Town Supervisor, Judy Gokey. Now, much of the community center ceiling is in a dumpster, out front. This is where the town votes, but obviously they can't this year, because it's not safe. So they put out word. \"Herkimer County did sent out little postcards, flyers, saying this is going on, this has happened,\" said Supervisor Gokey. \"My town clerk, and myself, we both put it on our Facebook pages, we put it on our town website.\" As soon as they knew they couldn't vote at the community center because of storm damage, they started letting people know they'd now be voting right up the road, at the Town Highway Garage, on Military Road. Yet, still.... \"Yesterday, I was here and I had a poll workers stop and ask if we were gonna post a notice. I said yes, but she said 'I've had a lot of calls' all the poll workers have. we've had people call us, Laura and I, and say what's going on, where are we voting?\" So they asked us, at NewsChannel 2, to help get the word out. Town Supervisor Gokey doesn't want anyone to be unable to vote. \"Every election is important, but a presidential election is monumental,\" said Gokey. \"I am a politician. I know how important voting is.\" This could affect up to 500 registered voters in Norway.",

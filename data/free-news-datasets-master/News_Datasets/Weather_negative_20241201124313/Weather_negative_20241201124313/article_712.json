    "text": "The National Weather Service issued a report at 9:34 a.m. on Friday for strong thunderstorms until 10:15 a.m. for South Central Oregon Coast.\nThe storms may bring nickel-sized hail (0.88 inches) and wind gusts of up to 55 mph.\n\"At 9:33 a.m., Doppler radar tracked a strong thunderstorm capable of producing a landspout 19 miles west of Bandon, or 31 miles northwest of Port Orford, moving east at 45 mph. This storm should reach the coast by 9:55 a.m.,\" according to the weather service. \"Minor damage to outdoor objects is possible. Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.\"\nLocations impacted by the alert include Bandon, Sunset Bay State Park, Charleston, Bullards Beach State Park and Barview.\nAccording to the weather service, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.\"\nLightning on the horizon: Expert safety measures for thunderstorms\nLightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away.\nTo protect yourself during a thunderstorm, take these recommendations into consideration:\nLightning safety plan:\n- When venturing outdoors, it's vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning.\n- Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby.\n- Seek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors.\nIndoors safety measures:\n- Once you've found shelter indoors, abstain from using corded phones, electrical appliances, or plumbing fixtures, and refrain from approaching windows and doors.\n- Lightning can follow conductive pathways, and these precautions reduce the risk of electrical surges.\nWait for the all-clear:\n- After the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities.\n- It's important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution.\nWhen indoor shelter isn't available:\nIf you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:\n- Avoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, which expose you to greater lightning risk.\n- Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In wooded areas, stay close to lower stands of trees.\n- If you're with a group, ensure individuals are spread out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people.\n- Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If you have no alternative, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. It's crucial to note that a tent provides no protection against lightning.\n- Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. While water and metal don't attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks.\nIn summary, when facing the threat of lightning, vigilance and preparedness are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the chances of lightning-related accidents and prioritize your safety.\nRainy roadways ahead: Essential safety tips for heavy rain\nRain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these tips from the weather service to ensure safety during heavy rainfall:\nBeware of swollen waterways:\nAvoid parking or walking in close proximity to culverts or drainage ditches, as the swiftly moving water during heavy rain can potentially carry you away.\nMaintain safe driving distances:\nUse the two-second rule to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you and allow an extra two seconds in heavy rain.\nReduce speed and drive cautiously:\nOn wet roads, reducing your speed is crucial. Ease off the gas pedal gradually and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.\nChoose your lane wisely:\nStick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water.\nPrioritize visibility\nEnhance your visibility in heavy rain by activating your headlights. Be particularly vigilant for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.\nWatch out for slippery roads:\nThe first half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mix of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\nLarge trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely.\nMind your windshield wipers:\nOverloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots.\nWhen stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.\nBy following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.",

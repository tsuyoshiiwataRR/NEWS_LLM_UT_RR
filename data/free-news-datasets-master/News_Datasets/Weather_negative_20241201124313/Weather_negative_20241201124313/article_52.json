    "text": "[News](/news)\n[Weather](/news/weather)\nLong Island in 'moderate drought' status after 2 months of record dryness\nLong Island has been moved into \"moderate drought\" status by a federal agency monitoring weather conditions, a change that caps off two months of little rain in the region.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor has six levels, ranging from no risk to \"exceptional drought.\" Long Island, northern New Jersey and part of the Lower Hudson Valley were raised on Thursday to the second of the six levels.\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Joe Pollina said, \"Conditions have been dry for a while ... We're in a moderate drought now.\"\nDrought is slowly creeping into our area as we continue to see more rain-free days. NE NJ, NYC and Long Island are now under a Moderate Drought. Our 7-day forecast calls for a few chances for showers, but not significant enough to offset any drought concerns.\nâ€” NWS New York NY (@NWSNewYorkNY)[#NYwx][#NJwx][#CTwx][pic.twitter.com/tu0dapfQR9][October 31, 2024]\n\"If it prolongs into next year, it could affect crops, Pollina said.\nSeptember was the driest on record for Islip, with just 0.24 inches of rain recorded, the weather service said. October was also looking to be one of the driest on record and the trend has been mirrored through the central and eastern United States.\nThe weather service said on X on Thursday: \"Our 7-day forecast calls for a few chances for showers, but not significant enough to offset any drought concerns.\"\nThe forecast Friday for the upcoming week called for a 30% chance of rain Thursday but the rest of the week looks sunny and dry.\nMore rain for LI ... Thanksgiving travel ... Penny trial continues ... FeedMe: Holiday pies\nMore rain for LI ... Thanksgiving travel ... Penny trial continues ... FeedMe: Holiday pies",

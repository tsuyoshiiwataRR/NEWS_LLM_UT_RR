    "text": "On Friday at 2:27 p.m. a red flag warning was issued by the National Weather Service in effect until 7 p.m. for Southern Wayne as well as Lackawanna, Luzerne and Pike counties.\nExpect winds to be northwest 10 mph to 20 mph with gusts to 30 mph and humidity as low as 25 percent.\n\"Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly. Outdoor burning is not recommended,\" says the weather service.\nWhat does a red flag warning indicate? A red flag warning indicates that either extreme fire weather conditions are currently happening or will happen soon, as per the weather service. Warm temperatures, very low humidities, and stronger winds are expected to combine to produce an increased risk of fire to spread rapidly.\nSo, what should you do under a red flag warning? During a red flag warning, it is crucial to exercise extreme caution and be prepared to take immediate action in case a fire starts. The weather service offers these steps you can take to lower the risk of fires igniting and ensure your safety:\n1. Secure burn barrels:\nIf burning is authorized in your vicinity, ensure that all burn barrels feature a weighted metal cover with holes no larger than 3/4 of an inch. 2. Mindful handling of smoking materials:\nPrudently discard cigarette butts and avoid flinging cigarettes or matches from a moving vehicle. These seemingly innocuous actions can kindle dry grass, potentially triggering a wildfire. 3. Properly extinguish outdoor fires:\nTo safeguard against accidental fires, diligently extinguish all outdoor fires. Drown them with an ample amount of water and stir to confirm that everything is cold to the touch. Submerge charcoal in water until it's thoroughly cooled. Never dispose of live charcoal on the ground. 4. Never leave fires unattended:\nAvoid abandoning any fire without supervision. Even minor sparks or drifting embers can incite nearby foliage or grass, setting off a rapidly spreading fire. Understanding the gravity of a red flag warning and adhering to these precautions is pivotal in mitigating the risk of wildfires during these perilous conditions. Prioritize safety, stay well-informed, and act responsibly to safeguard lives and property.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

    "text": "The National Weather Service issued a weather alert at 10:01 a.m. on Friday for elevated fire danger until 6 p.m. for Northern Clinton, Northern Centre, Southern Centre, Northern Lycoming, Southern Clinton and Southern Lycoming as well as Sullivan County.\n\"A combination of dry and windy conditions this afternoon will create an elevated risk of wildfire spread across the area. Minimum relative humidity values will range from 30 to 35 percent accompanied by wind gusts from the west northwest between 20 and 30 mph. Residents are urged to exercise caution if handling any potential ignition sources, such as machinery, cigarettes, or matches. If dry grasses and tree litter begin to burn, the fire will have the potential to spread rapidly,\" says the weather service.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

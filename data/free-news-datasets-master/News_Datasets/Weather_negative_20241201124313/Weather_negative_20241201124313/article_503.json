Most areas of the capital recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) over 350, raising health concerns.\nAt the India Gate, where the AQI stood around 317 post-Diwali, a cyclist commented, “Because of the pollution, terrible things are happening. It came on very suddenly this time. Just a few days ago, there was nothing, and now my brother has fallen sick. I used to come here to cycle with him, but he has been severely affected by the pollution lately. And today, the pollution is extreme.”\nAround 7 am, Anand Vihar recorded an AQI of 395, Aya Nagar stood at 352, Jahangirpuri at 390, and Dwarka reached 376—each reporting “very poor” air quality, posing significant health risks.\nThe pollution problem extended beyond Delhi; several cities across India, including major metros like Chennai and Mumbai, reported similar post-Diwali conditions, with smog and poor air quality impacting large areas.\nData from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) highlighted the serious impact of pollution, particularly following the Diwali celebrations, raising concerns about air quality and public health nationwide.\nAdvertisement\nDelhi IMD Pollution Related posts # Cities Mayor Dr Shelly Oberoi takes stock of sanitation operations across Delhi The Mayor ordered an immediate cleanup of all vulnerable points in the city.",

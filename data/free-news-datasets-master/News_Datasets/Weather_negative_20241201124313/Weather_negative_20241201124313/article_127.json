    "text": "1st November 2024 – (Tokyo) In 1831, the Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai captured a snow-covered Mount Fuji in his renowned woodblock print, The Great Wave off Kanagawa . Yet, as of this week, the iconic peak stands devoid of snow, marking the longest stretch without a snowcap since official records began 130 years ago. Typically, snow begins to blanket the 12,388-foot volcano around 2nd October, but this year, unusually warm temperatures have delayed its seasonal covering, with November fast approaching. For comparison, last year’s snow formation commenced on 5th October, while the previous record for the latest snowfall was set on 26th October, 1955, and matched in 2016.\nYutaka Katsuta, a forecaster at Japan’s Kofu Local Meteorological Office, attributed the lack of snow to persistently high temperatures throughout the summer, which continued into September, preventing the onset of colder air. This year, Japan has experienced its hottest summer on record for the second consecutive year, as reported by the Japan Times. In early October, approximately 74 cities recorded temperatures exceeding 84 degrees Fahrenheit, with anomalies ranging from 9 to 14 degrees higher than normal for this time of year.\nThe Kofu Local Meteorological Office has meticulously tracked the annual first snowfall on Mount Fuji since its establishment in 1894. Regarded as one of Japan’s three sacred mountains, Fuji is not only a revered pilgrimage site but also a popular destination for over 220,000 hikers during the summer months when the snow typically recedes.\nThe absence of snow on Mount Fuji reflects broader global trends associated with climate change. A study published in January highlighted that human-induced warming has contributed to diminished snowfall in the Northern Hemisphere over the past four decades. Atmospheric scientist Andrew Schwartz from the University of California, Berkeley, warned that if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated, many regions may experience snow-free winters by 2100.\nAs Japan grapples with climate-related challenges, Mount Fuji’s recent snowless status is exacerbated by the pressures of increased tourism. Following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, local officials have reported a surge in foreign visitors eager to climb the volcano. Toshiaki Kasai, a local government representative, noted this influx as a significant change in tourism dynamics.\nIn response to the growing number of hikers, Japan implemented a fee of 2,000 Japanese yen (approximately $13) for those wishing to traverse the mountain’s most popular route, alongside a daily visitor cap of 4,000. This measure aims to alleviate congestion and manage the environmental impact of tourism. However, concerns persist regarding the preparedness of hikers, with reports of injuries due to inadequate gear and littering on the mountain.\n“Overtourism—and all the subsequent consequences like rubbish, rising CO2 emissions and reckless hikers—is the biggest problem facing Mount Fuji,” remarked Masatake Izumi, a government official in Yamanashi Prefecture. “Fuji-san is screaming out in pain.”",

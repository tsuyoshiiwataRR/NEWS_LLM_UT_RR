Greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, are increasing faster than ever.\nOver the last 20 years, these gases went up by 11%, and they rose even more in 2023 due to fossil fuels, forest fires, and a weather event called El Niño. Experts are worried that forests may not absorb as much carbon now, which could cause more warming. Climate plans from the 2021 COP26 meeting didn’t lead to big changes. The UN says governments are not acting enough on their climate promises.\nNext year’s climate conference, countries should create stronger plans, but scientists warn that emissions need to drop by half by 2030 for real progress.\nDifficult words: fossil fuel (fuel from old plants and animals, such as gas or oil), absorb (to take in), progress (the process of getting better or improved).\nYou can watch the original video in the Level 3 section.\nWhat are some of the reasons for the increase in greenhouse gases over the last 20 years, and what is the target reduction for emissions by 2030 according to scientists?\nLEARN 3000 WORDS with NEWS IN LEVELS\nNews in Levels is designed to teach you 3000 words in English.

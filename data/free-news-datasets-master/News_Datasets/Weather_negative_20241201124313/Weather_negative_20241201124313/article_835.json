    "text": "Typhoon Kong-rey has finally begun to diminish in intensity across Shanghai after unleashing relentless torrential rains and fierce winds that approached 100 kilometers per hour for a harrowing 24-hour period.\nThe tropical cyclone made its impact felt in Shanghai on Thursday afternoon, delivering an unprecedented deluge that marked the highest rainfall ever recorded in the city during this time of year. More than ten local weather stations reported extraordinary amounts of rainfall, with several measuring over 80 millimeters in a single day—this figure set a new record for November precipitation.\nIn response to the unprecedented weather, the Shanghai Meteorological Service issued its second-highest rainstorm alert at 10 p.m. on Thursday, signaling serious weather conditions. Concurrently, the Shanghai Flood Control Command elevated the city’s flood and typhoon response efforts to Level II, emphasizing the urgency of the situation.\nAs a precaution, workers in the coastal Fengxian District were evacuated to ensure their safety, and numerous flights and high-speed train services were suspended to mitigate potential chaos. Additionally, several local universities transitioned to online classes to protect students from the inclement weather.\nThe relentless rain persisted overnight and into Friday, with certain districts witnessing extraordinary precipitation totals of up to 132 mm accompanied by gusty winds reaching 95 kph. Fortunately, despite the severe weather conditions, officials reported no major flooding incidents or casualties, and the city has already taken steps to downgrade its rainfall alert.\nThis year, China’s typhoon season has displayed an unusual pattern of being both late and intensely active. So far, four typhoons have made landfall across the nation, nearly double the historical average for this timeframe. Typically, the storm season peaks in July, but unpredictable weather has characterized 2024, highlighted by back-to-back typhoon strikes on Shanghai in September.\nExperts attribute these unusual weather patterns to various factors, including notably higher sea temperatures this year.\nTyphoon Kong-rey also made landfall in Taiwan on Thursday afternoon, marking it as the third-strongest typhoon to hit the island in October since 1951. Tragically, as of Friday, three fatalities have been reported on the island, underscoring the cyclone’s impact.\nLooking ahead, Shanghai’s weather is expected to stabilize this weekend, bringing mostly cloudy skies accompanied by light winds. Furthermore, a new cold front is anticipated to sweep through next week, potentially causing temperatures in downtown areas to plummet to lows of 12 degrees Celsius.\n(Header image: A mother and a daughter on their way home as Typhoon Kong-rey swept through Shanghai, Nov. 1, 2024. Wu Huiyuan/Sixth Tone)\n**Interview with Dr. ⁢Li ⁣Zhang, Meteorologist and Climate Expert**\n**Editor:** Thank you for joining us today, Dr. Zhang. ‍Can you start by giving us a brief overview of Typhoon Kong-rey’s impact on Shanghai?\n**Dr. Zhang:** Certainly! Typhoon Kong-rey was‍ a⁢ remarkable and intense tropical cyclone that struck Shanghai, bringing with it unprecedented rainfall and fierce ⁢winds.‌ Over a 24-hour period, we recorded ⁤wind speeds nearing 100 kilometers‍ per hour, and the city saw remarkable rainfall amounts, with some ⁣weather stations measuring over 80⁢ millimeters in just ⁢one day. ‌This rainfall set a new record for November‌ precipitation ‍in Shanghai.\n**Editor:** That sounds incredibly severe. ‌What led to the decision⁢ by the⁤ Shanghai Meteorological Service to ​issue a rainstorm alert?\n**Dr. Zhang:** ‍The decision to⁤ issue a second-highest​ rainstorm ‌alert was based on the rapid⁢ and severe nature of ⁤the weather conditions. ​The continuous ‌heavy rainfall not only posed risks of​ flooding but also highlighted⁤ the potential⁢ for significant ⁣infrastructure damage. By raising the alert, the authorities aimed to prepare residents and‌ services for the impending dangers.\n**Editor:** Can ‍you explain⁣ what the ⁢Level II response from the Shanghai Flood Control Command‌ entails?\n**Dr. Zhang:** Level II‍ response ⁣indicates‌ a serious weather‍ situation requiring immediate action.‌ This includes the mobilization of ⁤emergency services ⁣and flood ⁣control measures, ‌as well as the evacuation of‌ at-risk areas,​ such as in Fengxian District. It⁤ also involves suspending public transport—including flights ⁣and train services—to ensure public safety ​and minimize risks during such extreme weather events.\n**Editor:** How have ⁣residents ⁤been coping with Typhoon Kong-rey’s aftermath?\n**Dr. Zhang:** Many residents have faced challenges, particularly with flooding ‌in certain areas. Local authorities ‌have been ‍working tirelessly to manage the situation, clear ⁢debris, and provide assistance to those affected. Community ​spirit⁤ is essential‌ during such times, and reports indicate that people are helping each other with relief efforts and⁤ staying informed through official channels.\n**Editor:** Given the increasing frequency and intensity of ⁤storms like Kong-rey, what long-term measures should cities like Shanghai consider?\n**Dr.​ Zhang:** There’s a critical need for enhanced urban planning‌ and improved infrastructure⁢ resilience to⁤ cope with extreme weather‌ events. This includes investing in better drainage systems, creating green spaces that can absorb excess rainfall, ​and implementing⁤ more robust ‌emergency response⁣ frameworks. Additionally,​ community education ⁢on disaster preparedness ⁣plays a crucial role in helping residents stay safe during such events.\n**Editor:** ‌Thank⁣ you, Dr. Zhang, for your insights. It’s ⁣been a pleasure speaking with ⁣you.\n**Dr. Zhang:** Thank⁤ you for having me.​ Stay safe and informed!",

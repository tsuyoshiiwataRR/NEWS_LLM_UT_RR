    "text": "MIAMI (EFE).- The governor of Florida , Ron De Santis, yesterday declared a state of emergency in 35 counties in anticipation of the foreseeable impact of the tropical storm” Milton ,” which would reach the west coast of this southern state by the middle of next week, perhaps in the form of a major hurricane.\nThe emergency declaration will allow us to accelerate preparations for the expected effects of “Milton”, which would make landfall Florida as a Category 3 or higher hurricane.\nThese preparations come as recovery efforts continue following the September 26 impact of the powerful Category 4 hurricane “Helene,” which left at least 227 dead and hundreds missing across six states.\n“We will continue to mobilize state resources to prepare for effective search and rescue operations, restoring power and clearing roadways,” DeSantis said in a post on his official X account yesterday.\nHim National Hurricane Center (NHC, in English) from the United States yesterday predicted that Storm “Milton,” which today has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, will become a hurricane tonight and tomorrow, and that it “could become a major hurricane as it moves across the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico” headed to Florida.\nTHE Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) yesterday alerted Floridians that storms and heavy rain could occur in the state, especially in areas that have already been affected by “Elena”, which has since already become the deadliest in the United States “Katrina”, which in 2005 caused more than 1,800 deaths.\nAmong the counties included in the executive order signed by DeSantis there are also those in central Florida, right where the theme parks of Walt Disney World and that they may close in anticipation of the effects of “Milton”, according to local media.\n#threat #Florida #Milton",

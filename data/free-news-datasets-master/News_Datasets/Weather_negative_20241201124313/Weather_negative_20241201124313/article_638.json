    "text": "[Weather](/maryland/towson/weather)\nMD Burn Ban Declared, Red Flag Warning In Effect\nThe state of Maryland issued a statewide burn ban as dry conditions and gusty winds are likely to contribute to \"extreme fire behavior.\"\nMARYLAND — Several Maryland counties are under a red flag warning Friday, meaning dry conditions and gusty winds are more likely to contribute to the rapid spread of fires.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, [the warning is in effect](https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=LWX&wwa=red%20flag%20warning) from noon to 6 p.m. for the following counties: Frederick, Carroll, Baltimore, Cecil, Allegany, Montgomery, Howard and Harford.\nState officials also implemented a statewide ban on open-air burning Friday. The ban will remain in effect until further notice.\nFind out what's happening in Towsonwith free, real-time updates from Patch.\n\"Extremely dry conditions persist across the state and have led to an above average number of wildfires statewide, and conditions are not expected to change in the near future,\" the Maryland Department of Natural Resources said in a statement. \"The ban will remain in effect until the Maryland Forest Service determines the state has received enough precipitation to reduce the threat of wildfires statewide.\"\nFirefighters are battling blazes in four Maryland counties on Friday.\nFind out what's happening in Towsonwith free, real-time updates from Patch.\nForecasters said the combination of strong winds, low relative humidity and warm temperatures could contribute to \"extreme fire behavior\" and cause any grass or brush fires to quickly spread out of control.\nWinds on Friday are expected to reach 15 to 20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph, according to the forecast.\nAs of Nov. 1, much of the Baltimore region was experiencing abnormally dry or moderate drought conditions, according to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Drought Monitor.\nMeanwhile, eastern counties were experiencing moderate to severe drought while dry conditions in the far western portion of the state were flagged as extreme.\nMarylanders should be cautious when handling open flames and also dispose of cigarette butts, matches, and other flammable items in appropriate containers. Forecasters also urged residents to keep vehicles off dry grass and to heed local burn bans.\nMaryland Forest Service officials made the recommendation to implement the ban based on this data:\n- Since Oct. 1, the Forest Service has responded to more than 24 wildfires that have burned 75 acres, more than triple the 10-year average of seven wildfires burning 21 acres for the month. Forest Service firefighters and partner agencies are currently containing active fires in Washington, Frederick, Anne Arundel, and Worcester counties.\n- The state has received less than 25% of the average precipitation for October, with much of the state receiving little or no precipitation with the exception of Garrett and Allegany counties. Those two counties have received less than 50% of the monthly average.\n- The National Weather Climate Prediction Center weather outlook for the next 6-10 days calls for normal or below normal precipitation for most of the state.\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.\n[Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.](/maryland/towson/subscribe)",

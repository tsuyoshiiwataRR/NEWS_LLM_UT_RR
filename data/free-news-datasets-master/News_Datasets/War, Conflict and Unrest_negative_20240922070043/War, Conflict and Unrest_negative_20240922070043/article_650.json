    "text": "2024-08-22 20:12:01\nEU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Security Josep Borrell today called the Ukrainian offensive in the Kursk region a “heavy blow” against Russian President Vladimir Putin, DPA reported, referring to his post on the “X” platform.\nThe head of European diplomacy also announced his support for the removal of territorial restrictions on the use of Western weapons by Ukraine. Some countries that supplied the weapons insist that they be used only on Ukrainian territory, the agency notes.\n“Ukraine’s offensive in the Kursk region is a heavy blow against the narrative of Russian President Putin,” Borel wrote in X, adding: “The removal of restrictions on the use of military force against the Russian army participating in the aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international right, would have several important effects,” including strengthening Ukrainian self-defense, saving lives, and advancing peace efforts, BTA reported.\n“The EU fully supports Ukraine’s fight against Russian aggression,” Borel emphasized.",

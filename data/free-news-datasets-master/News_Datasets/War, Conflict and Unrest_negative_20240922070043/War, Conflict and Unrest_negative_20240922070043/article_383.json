    "text": "The SPD leader asserts that without the provision of weapons, Ukraine would face total obliteration. Just before the state elections in Thuringia and Saxony, SPD leader Saskia Esken reinforces military support for Ukraine against Russia. Chancellor Olaf Scholz is working towards a fair and sustainable peace, Esken told the Funke media group newspapers. \"As long as Putin doesn't abandon his hostile intentions towards Ukraine, peace cannot be achieved diplomatically.\" Esken connects her remarks to criticism of the co-chair of the Left Party, Sahra Wagenknecht. \"If, like Madam Wagenknecht and others, we were to cease delivering weapons to Ukraine today, the country would be conquered tomorrow and wiped off the map the day after. This would have catastrophic repercussions for security throughout Europe, which would not result in less armament and certainly not in peace.\" 11:48 PM Ukraine Braces for its Toughest Winter EverAs a result of the damage to its power and energy infrastructure caused by Russian attacks, Ukraine anticipates its harshest winter yet. \"We are facing our toughest winter ever,\" says Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Haluschtschenko during a video conference. This winter will be even more harsh than the last, as the damage from ongoing Russian attacks has progressively accumulated. The Russian army employs various weapons in coordinated attacks to inflict as much damage as possible, he says. During a warm winter, electricity consumption is approximately 18 gigawatts, whereas in a cold winter it's 19 gigawatts. Furthermore, a one-gigawatt reserve must be established, says Haluschtschenko. Russian attacks have destroyed around 9 gigawatts of capacity. 11:08 PM NATO Raises Security Level at Geilenkirchen AirbaseDue to a perceived threat, NATO heightens its security level at the airbase in Geilenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia. All non-essential staff have been sent home, according to a base spokesperson. This decision is based on intelligence information indicating a potential threat. \"This is not cause for concern and is a precautionary measure to ensure we can continue our critical operations,\" the spokesperson says. Police are present at the scene, but no further details, such as the number of deployed forces, are provided. 10:07 PM Ukraine Reports Strike on Kursk StrongholdThe Ukrainian military reports another strike against Russian troops in the Kursk region. In the afternoon, they targeted a Russian stronghold using precision-guided US bombs, according to the air force commander, Mykola Oleshchuk. \"A drone command post, a radio-electronic warfare unit, equipment, weapons, and up to 40 Russian military personnel were hit,\" Oleshchuk writes alongside a video claiming to show the attack. 9:43 PM Switzerland's Peace Summit Holds First Follow-up MeetingFollowing the peace summit in Switzerland in June, the first follow-up meeting has taken place, according to Ukraine. Representatives from over 40 countries and organizations participated in the virtual session. Additional such meetings of working groups will be scheduled. 9:08 PM Habeck: More Ukrainian Refugees Should Work in GermanyEconomy Minister Robert Habeck hopes that more Ukrainian refugees in Germany will find employment. Potential obstacles such as family-related circumstances, illness, war trauma, or childcare needs could potentially hinder employment, the Green politician told Welt TV. \"However, in general, it's better for everyone to work – it's better for the people, for their integration, and for the social system.\" Habeck is skeptical of statements like those made by Brandenburg's Minister President and SPD politician Dietmar Woidke, who questioned the allowance for Ukrainian refugees. \"I believe that's due to the somewhat rough eastern German election campaigns and hasn't been thought through completely.\" 8:28 PM Brigade Launches Counteroffensive in Kharkiv Region: Two Kilometers AdvancedThe Ukrainian military has announced a push in the Kharkiv region. Troops have advanced nearly two kilometers into the frontline area, according to the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade of the Ukrainian ground forces. The primary goal of the operation was to weaken the offensive capability of the 20th Army of the Russian Federation, which the Ukrainian military claims has been achieved. This cannot be independently verified. The brigade also reports that the Russian side has lost 300 soldiers in the last four days, and a substantial amount of equipment and weapons have been destroyed or damaged. The extent of the reported counterattack remains unclear. 8:00 PM Intelligence Service Allegedly Interferes with Russian TV BroadcastThe Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) is said to have interrupted the broadcast of several Russian TV channels and replaced it with a video about the war in Ukraine. \"HUR has hacked Russian television and shown the reality of the war [to the population],\" a source at the intelligence service told the \"Kyiv Post\" newspaper and the RBC Ukraine news agency. The inserted video was shown three times during prime time yesterday evening. Channels affected included Pervouralsk, Evraziya 360, and Pervyj Kanal TV. As a result of the attack, nine channels temporarily suspended their programming, it was reported. There's been a decrease in the number of Russian ground troops situated in Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave located between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic Sea, according to Lithuanian armed forces commander Raimundas Vaikšnoras, sharing this info with news portal \"Delfi\". He links this reduction to the Ukrainian offensive in the Russian region of Kursk. Upon the start of the conflict with Ukraine, noticeable relocations of equipment and troops from Kaliningrad were observed, the commander mentions. After the completion of rotations, soldiers have returned, but there's now a reduction, particularly in ground troops. 18:40 \"Armenians? Who needs them?\" – Lukashenko sparks furyBelarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko's controversial remarks about Armenia have sparked outrage. Monday evening, protestors reportedly hurled eggs at the Belarusian embassy in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, demanding the expulsion of the ambassador, as suggested by Ukrainian media sources. Prior to this, Lukashenko voiced his disapproval of Armenia's pro-Western course on Russian state television, saying \"Who needs Armenians? No one. Let them develop their economy and rely on their own resources. What is France? Who is Macron? Tomorrow, when Macron is gone, everyone will forget the Armenians,\" referring to the French president. Tensions between Armenia and its long-term ally, Russia, have been escalating since Azerbaijan seized the Nagorno-Karabakh region in a military operation in September, ending three decades of Armenian separatist rule. 18:03 Ukraine reports fatalities from glide bomb attackTwo individuals were reported killed in Sumy region bordering Russia's Kursk region due to an attack using two glide bombs, according to Ukraine's prosecutor's office.

They attribute the incident to a Ukrainian attack. Various Russian media outlets distribute pictures and videos showing the inferno and smoke plumes. Ukrainian military also shares such media on social platforms, stating \"Neptune pays a visit to the port of Kavkaz.\" Unverified reports from Russian Telegram channels suggest that the ship was hit by a Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missile, although the weapon's official range is 300 kilometers, and the frontline is farther away. Moscow uses the port extensively to supply its troops engaged in the war against Ukraine. 18:39 Update: The ship is reported to have sank following the fire. It had 30 fuel tanks onboard. 16:41 Russia declares victory near Pokrovsk, Ukraine reports successes in KurskRussian troops claim to have captured another village near Pokrovsk city in eastern Ukraine, moving 10 kilometers close to an important logistics hub. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy had earlier announced plans to fortify troops in Pokrovsk region. Meanwhile, he reported Ukrainian victories in the Russian region of Kursk, stating that another village was conquered and \"the exchange fund\" – captured soldiers – was increased. As per the claims, Ukrainian forces now control 94 villages and over a thousand square kilometers of land in Kursk. However, these claims are yet to be verified. 16:12 Ukraine denies attempted nuclear power plant assault: Russia may itself carry out \"nuclear provocation\" Ukraine refutes the claims by Russian President Vladimir Putin that Ukrainian troops attempted to attack the Kursk nuclear power plant last night. \"This is an absolute lie,\" states Andrii Kovalenko, head of the department for countering disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine. Russia has previously spread false information about Ukrainian preparation for a \"nuclear provocation\" at the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants. However, all signs suggest that Russia might be planning this provocation, Kovalenko continues. He considers the \"possibility of a nuclear provocation by Russia\" to be genuine, owing to Putin's active involvement. 15:46 EU gas storage nearly full Two months ahead of the deadline, gas storage facilities in the European Union are nearly 90% full. The EU proclaims itself \"prepared for the upcoming winter,\" as declared by the European Commission. Following the start of Russia's military invasion of Ukraine, the 27 EU countries agreed in the summer of 2022 that gas storage in the EU should be at an average of 90% full by November 1. According to data from the Gas Infrastructure Europe portal, there are variations between countries: the highest level is in Spain at 100%, and the lowest is in Latvia at around 69%. In Germany, storage is 93.6% full. The EU aims to further reduce its dependency on Russian natural gas. Instead, it is importing more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US and natural gas from Norway. 15:21 Putin: Ukraine attacked Russian nuclear power plant Russian President Vladimir Putin accuses Ukraine of attacking the Kursk nuclear power plant. \"The opposing forces attempted to attack the nuclear power plant last night,\" says Putin without offering any evidence. \"The International Atomic Energy Agency has been informed,\" Putin adds the statement during a cabinet meeting broadcast on television. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had earlier expressed concerns about the potential impacts of fighting on the power plant and urged \"all parties to maintain maximum restraint.\" Read more here. 14:50 IAEA Chief to Visit Controversial Kursk Nuclear Plant The leader of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, is set to visit the disputed Kursk nuclear power plant in Russia next week. This visit has been confirmed by an IAEA spokesperson, stating it will take place \"next week.\" In early August, the Ukrainian military launched an unexpected large-scale attack on the Russian region of Kursk. The Russian nuclear energy corporation, Rosatom, then issued warnings about a potential threat to the nuclear power plant due to Ukrainian aggression, which is situated roughly 100 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. 14:21 Russia: 115,000 Residents Fled Threatened Regions 115,000 people have been evacuated from endangered regions along the Ukrainian border in Russia, as reported by Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov.

The Public Prosecutor's Office in Flensburg is investigating on suspicion of espionage with the aim of sabotage. Internally, sources indicate that the no-fly zone over the nuclear power plant was repeatedly violated, and an enemy object, suspected to be a military drone, was detected. As \"Bild\" further reports, the drones are believed to be operated by Russian agents and might have been launched from civilian ships in the North Sea.

The robots can clear mines even in inaccessible areas, at a safe distance from the operators. \"One of the most heinous crimes Russia has committed in Ukraine is the scattering of countless mines,\" said Snyder. \"I've visited abandoned areas near the front where people take risks to help others return to their farms and homes. With these robots, mines can be cleared, and lives can be saved.\" Ukraine is heavily mined, and its demining could take decades. 08:01 Kremlin Prepares Russians for \"New Reality\"The Ukrainian incursion into Kursk poses a challenge for Moscow's propaganda. Although the territories are distant, a Kremlin-linked source informed the independent Russian portal Meduza, based in Riga, \"But even the penetration into Russian territory and the seizure of control over villages is a new and quite disturbing event.\" To alleviate the heightened apprehension that has arisen since the invasion of Kursk, the Kremlin is endeavoring to prepare Russians for living in \"a new reality\" and \"a new normality.\" The message is: The enemy has indeed entered Russian territory, its defeat is imminent - but the return of the territory will require time, and the Russians must be patient. In the meantime, they are encouraged to \"transform the negativity and shock into a positive expression\" - mainly by gathering aid supplies for the Kursk region.

It shouldn't come to the point where it's declared, \"There's no more money for Ukraine.\" In such a case, \"we, of course, would have to look in Germany where the funds will be sourced,\" Klingbeil said. \"We have a responsibility towards Ukraine. Solutions must be found, and we will find them.\" 04:27 Ukraine Addresses Overnight Drone Strikes in RussiaThe Ukrainian military intelligence service HUR has responded to the overnight drone strikes in Russia.

The situation has now been contained. 21:00 Zelensky: Ukraine Seeks Immediate Aid BillionsUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asserts that Ukraine is eagerly awaiting the prompt allocation of the financial aid billions promised by the West. This funding will be in part derived from the earnings of seized Russian government assets. While there have been numerous political assurances, Zelensky says in his nightly address that more concrete actions are required. \"But we need active measures,\" he states. Ukraine requires the income generated by frozen Russian assets to combat Russian aggression. \"The relevant negotiations have been lingering too long, and we need swift decisions now.\" The G7 nations pledged to offer Kyiv fresh financial aid at their June summit, with a generous loan of $50 billion to be secured by interest earnings from frozen Russian assets. 20:30 Putin Commends Strengthening Trade Ties with ChinaRussian President Vladimir Putin praises the growing collaboration with China. \"Our commercial relations are prospering (...).

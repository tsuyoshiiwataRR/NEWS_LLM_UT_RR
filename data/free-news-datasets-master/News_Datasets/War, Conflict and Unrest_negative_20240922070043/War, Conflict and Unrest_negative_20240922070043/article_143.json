    "text": "NEW DELHI: The intelligence establishment has dismantled an al-Qaida-inspired module comprising extremist Wahhabis spread across several states, which was purportedly on the cusp of executing terror strikes. The intelligence agency orchestrated simultaneous operations in four states, culminating in the arrest of a dozen individuals. One of them, Dr Ishtiyaq Ahmed from Jharkhand, allegedly holds a pivotal position in the outfit, known as the al-Qaida in Indian Subcontinent (AQIS). He was employed as a radiologist in a private clinic. However, a key operative of the module, codenamed Guddu, managed to escape from Mewat region during the raids, leaving the sleuths red-faced, according to sources in Rajasthan. A substantial cache of arms and ammunition has been confiscated during the raids and a training camp situated in Bhiwadi neutralised as well. The operation was conducted utilising sleuths from Delhi's special cell and anti-terror squads of various states.The training camp was operational in a densely forested area of Chopanki in Bhiwadi area of Rajasthan. About six-seven people were apprehended there. Apart from Dr Ahmed, the other suspects of the Ranchi module have been identified as Motiur, Rizwan, Mufti Rahmatullah and Faizan. Other arrested men are Hasan, Enamul, Altaf Ansari, Arshad, Umar Farooq and Shahbaz. In Jharkhand, the special task force (STF) sleuths conducted raids at 16 locations, including a madrassa in Ranchi, Hazaribag and Lohardaga, based on intelligence inputs. The neutralised module is linked to an AQIS module dismantled by agencies in 2016. Two of the men arrested in that operation, Abdul Rehman Katki and Abdul Sami, have resurfaced in this instance as well. Katki, who is currently in judicial custody, was alleged to have recruited boys from different districts like Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Lohardaga and Chatra to AQIS. A few were caught then while others managed to remain undetected and continue their operations. Some of the remaining operatives have now been nabbed. This module appeared to be inspired by AQ ideologue Abu Sufian, who is allegedly in Afghanistan. The seizure includes an AK-47 rifle, a .38 bore revolver, live cartridges of various calibres, a dummy Insas rifle, an air rifle and a hand grenade. Additionally, there were IED components, like an iron elbow pipe, a key remote-control mechanism, wires, a battery, a table watch, ground sheets, a target, a camping tent, and some food and drink items like biscuits, chips and a water bottle. A substantial amount of jihadi literature has also been confiscated. \\\"The module was aspiring to declare Khilafat and execute serious terrorist activities within the country. The members of the module have received indoctrination and weapons training at various locations. Six individuals were detained from Bhiwadi, Rajasthan, while undergoing weapon-handling training,\\\" said a statement from Delhi Police.",

    "text": "- By [Anushka Vats](/authors/anushka-vats) - Published: Fri, 23 Aug 2024 09:02 AM (IST) - Source:JND The interim government of Bangladesh revoked the passport of ex-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. An order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs directed Hasina along with advisers, former cabinet members and all members of the recently dissolved National Parliament, to surrender their diplomatic passports. The directive issued on Thursday, as reported by Xinhua news agency, also extends to the family members of those affected. The notification, signed by Faisal Hasan, senior information officer of the Ministry of Home Affairs, details the process for issuing general passports in exchange for diplomatic passports. The notification, meanwhile, doesn't mention the actions that will be taken against those not following the orders. This comes amid the tense situation in Bangladesh following protests led mainly by students demanding an end to a quota system for government jobs. Sheikh Hasina left Bangladesh for New Delhi on August 5 after stepping down as Prime Minister. An interim government in Bangladesh, led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, 84, was sworn in as the head of the interim government on August 8.

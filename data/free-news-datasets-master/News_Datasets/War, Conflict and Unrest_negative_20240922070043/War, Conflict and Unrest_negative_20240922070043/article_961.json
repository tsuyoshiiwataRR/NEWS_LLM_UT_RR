    "text": "Rising Tensions: Philippines-China Standoff in South China Sea The Philippines' military expansion on Thitu Island in the South China Sea has sparked a response from China, which accused Manila of provocative actions. This ongoing dispute tangles with claims and counterclaims from multiple countries, including the involvement of global players like the U.S. and Japan, raising regional instability risks. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Beijing | Updated: 23-08-2024 10:26 IST | Created: 23-08-2024 10:26 IST - Country: - China The Philippines' military expansion on Thitu Island in the South China Sea has drawn sharp criticism from China. According to China's state-backed Global Times, Manila's actions could 'stir up trouble' in the region, already fraught with territorial disputes. China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, including the contested Spratly Islands. Meanwhile, the Philippines occupies and is developing nearly 10 locations within these waters. Recent incidents between Chinese and Philippine vessels near Sabina Shoal have heightened tensions further. The international community, specifically the United States, has condemned China's aggressive maritime maneuvers. This geopolitical chess game underscores the precarious balance of power and sovereignty in the South China Sea. (With inputs from agencies.)",

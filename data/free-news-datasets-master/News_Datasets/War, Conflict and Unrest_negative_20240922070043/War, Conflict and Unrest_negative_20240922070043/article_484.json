    "text": "News Link • [Foreign Policy](/Subjects/00008-LAST-foreign-policy.htm) • https://ronpaulinstitute.org, by Caitlin Johnstone [Democrats Release Insanely Hawkish Middle East Policy Platform](https://ronpaulinstitute.org/democrats-release-insanely-hawkish-middle-east-policy-platform/) There is literally no evidentiary basis anywhere for this assertion. She made it up. Kamala Harris is not \"working tirelessly\" to do anything at this time besides become the next president. Her own staff are saying she is opposed to an arms embargo on Israel and won't consider cutting or conditioning military aid, which is the only way the Israeli government can be effectively forced to stop sabotaging a peace deal so that the US-backed genocide can finally end. Saying you'll continue pouring military explosives into a regime that is using those military explosives to conduct regular massacres of civilians is the exact opposite of working tirelessly to secure a ceasefire. \"This is false, it's propaganda, and it's making people misunderstand the issue,\" Current Affairs' Nathan Robinson said of AOC's statement. \"The Biden administration could have imposed a ceasefire anytime it wanted to. The only reason there isn't one is that Biden has made sure Israel has no incentive to agree to one.\" As we deal with this crap, the DNC has approved a 2024 [party platform](https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/FINAL-MASTER-PLATFORM.pdf) whose section on the middle east is so surprisingly hawkish that it largely reads like it could have been written by some of Washington's most war-horny Republicans. It repeatedly calls its support for Israel and the continuation of arms shipments thereto \"ironclad\". It criticizes Trump as having been too soft on Iran, for god's sake. After boasting about the Biden administration's bombing campaign against the \"Iranian-linked Houthi forces\" in Yemen, its \"precision airstrikes on key Iranian-linked targets,\" and its success in neutralizing Iran's retaliatory strikes on Israel after Israel assassinated multiple Iranian military officials in Syria, the platform says that this \"stands in sharp contrast to Trump's fecklessness and weakness in the face of Iranian aggression during his presidency.\" New Democratic Party Platform Pledges 'Ironclad' Commitment to Israel— Antiwar.com (@Antiwarcom) Platform also boasts of Biden's new military interventions in the Middle East, including the bombing campaign in [#Yemen] by Dave DeCamp [@DecampDave] [#Israel] [#Gaza] [#Palestinians] [#DNC2024] [https://t.co/mOmlFVEJhh] [pic.twitter.com/YPqlalFmAk] [August 20, 2024]",

    "text": "Concerns escalate regarding the situation of six captives in Gaza, following the discovery of gunshot injuries by the Israeli Defense Forces. The unfortunate event has sparked concerns that more Israeli captives might not return alive, mentioned one demonstrator. \"We need to bring back those we know were still alive,\" Daniel shared with CNN. He expressed that continuing the conflict while negotiations for a truce and hostage swap falter will only lead to more funerals, both for them and us, he added, aging 48. No formal explanation has been provided on how the six perished. IDF declared on Thursday that initial examinations indicate that all six captives had been fired upon, but the exact cause of their demise has yet to be determined. It also pointed out that the findings are provisional. IDF reported discovering four additional deceased individuals near the bodies of the six captives, believed to be Hamas militants who had been holding the captives. However, no signs of bullets were found on their bodies. IDF didn't assign any culprit. Outside Israel's Ministry of Defense, Daniel highlighted that IDF's announcement suggesting all six captives were shot underscores the threats involved in force-based rescue operations. On Tuesday, Israeli outlet Ynet reported early assessments suggested the captives might have succumbed to carbon dioxide inhalation, following IDF strikes on a nearby Hamas target. During a media session on Tuesday, IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari declined to confirm whether the captives were killed due to Israeli military actions. Instead, he referred to a statement he made in June, stating the hostages perished while IDF forces were operating in Khan Younis. The unfortunate incidents reinstated calls for a ceasefire among protesters in Tel Aviv on Thursday. Omer, 46, attending the protest with his two daughters, believed they \"could have been rescued much sooner.\" He accused the Israeli government of delaying the agreement with Hamas, which, he warned, would lead to a more expensive agreement that could have been secured earlier. A ceasefire would also relieve tens of thousands of Palestinians in the blockaded enclave as Israel presses on with its military campaign. United Nations estimated in July that approximately 1.9 million people in the strip had been displaced, which almost equaled the total population of Gaza. However, doubts surround Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's intention to reach a deal due to fierce opposition from right-wing ministers within his coalition. Netanyahu's political fate hinges on his right-wing coalition partners, with some already threatening to abandon the government if he agrees to the deal, potentially leading to its collapse. \"Maybe Hamas captured them (the hostages), but the one we can blame for their murder is Benjamin Netanyahu,\" Omer claimed, adding that the prime minister is \"solely responsible.\" A group representing the families of Israeli hostages, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, criticized Israeli authorities in a statement on Thursday, asserting that the forensic test results suggesting gunshot wounds were \"further evidence of the cruelty of the terrorists\" who kept them captive. The Forum also reiterated its criticism of Israeli authorities, stating that the recovery of bodies was \"no achievement.\" \"It is a testament to the complete failure to strike a deal in time, as six hostages who were expected to return alive instead returned in coffins,\" the Forum said. Israeli officials identified the recovered bodies as belonging to Yoram Metzger, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder, Chaim Peri, Nadav Popplewell, and Yagev Buchshtab on Tuesday. Except for Munder, all the deceased had been previously declared dead by the Israeli military. Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant stated that IDF and ISA had entered Hamas tunnels in a \"complicated operation\" to retrieve their remains. Munder was taken captive along with his wife, daughter, and grandson, who were later released during a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas in November. Munder's son, Roee, was killed during the attack. Nine-year-old Ohad Munder conveyed his feelings to Israel's public broadcast channel Kan 11, stating that the demise of his grandfather and the other captives \"shouldn't have happened.\" \"There have been numerous opportunities for a deal... but then they say no, only to regret it at the last moment. All the hostages could have returned alive from the start. They could have brought back my grandfather and all the other hostages,\" Ohad said. Currently, there are 109 Israeli captives still in Gaza, including 36 thought to be deceased, according to data from the Israeli Government Press Office. The world has expressed sympathy and concern over the tragic loss of the captives, with many calling for a peaceful resolution in the Middle East. Despite the conflicting reports about the cause of death, the discovery of gunshot wounds on some bodies has raised concerns about the role of Hamas militants and the Israeli military in this unfortunate incident.",

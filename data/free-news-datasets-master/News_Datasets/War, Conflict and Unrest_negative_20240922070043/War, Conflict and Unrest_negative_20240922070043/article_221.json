    "text": "World Israel kills top Palestinian militant as truce talks falter August 23, 2024 Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Telegram AFP – The Israeli military killed a senior Palestinian militant in Lebanon on Wednesday, leading to accusations from the Fatah movement that Israel was trying to ignite a regional war.\nThe strike that killed Khalil Maqdah, described by Fatah as “one of the leaders” of its armed wing in Lebanon, came hours after United States (US) Secretary of State Antony Blinken ended a tour of the Middle East aimed at reaching a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\nOn Wednesday, US President Joe Biden called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and “made clear that we must bring the ceasefire and hostage release deal to closure”, the president wrote on X.\nFatah, which is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and rivals the Gaza Strip’s rulers Hamas, said Maqdah was killed near the southern Lebanese city of Sidon.\nIsrael accused him of “directing attacks and smuggling weapons” to the West Bank and collaborating with Iranian forces. His killing marked the first time Israel has targeted a senior Fatah member in more than 10 months of cross-border clashes with Lebanese militants, mostly from Hezbollah, during the Gaza war.\nTawfiq Tirawy, a member of Fatah’s central committee, told AFP that the “assassination… is further proof that Israel wants to ignite a full-scale war in the region”.\nBlinken, who left Qatar late on Tuesday apparently empty-handed, appealed to Hamas to urgently accept a US-drafted truce proposal, while also publicly disagreeing with Israel over its future presence in the besieged Gaza Strip.\n“Time is of the essence,” Blinken said before flying out of Doha after stops in Egypt and Israel.\nA ceasefire “needs to get done, and it needs to get done in the days ahead”, he said.\nOn the ground, Gaza was again rocked by air strikes, according to AFP reporters, first responders, witnesses and the Israeli military, which also issued fresh evacuation orders.\nThe civil defence agency in the Hamas-run territory said at least three people were killed and 10 children wounded in an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City.\nIsrael’s military said the “precise strike” targeted Hamas militants based in the school compound.\nA father told AFP his child was killed in the strike while playing in the schoolyard.\n“What did this child do to deserve this?” he said, declining to give his name. Israeli bombardment elsewhere in Gaza killed at least 24 people on Wednesday, the civil defence agency said.\nPalestinians watch as smoke rises from a building hit by an Israeli strike in central Gaza City.

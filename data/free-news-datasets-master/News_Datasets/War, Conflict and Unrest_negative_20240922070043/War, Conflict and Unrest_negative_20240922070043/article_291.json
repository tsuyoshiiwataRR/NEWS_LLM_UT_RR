    "text": "There's breaking news on the story of the Arizona man who allegedly said he sought to kill former President Donald Trump at the U.S.- Mexico border, after a frantic manhunt ensued while the Republican nominee visited Cochise County Thursday. A manhunt is underway in Arizona, where Cochise County officials are looking for Ronald Lee Syrvud, a 66-year-old man who has threatened to kill a presidential candidate. It's being reported that the candidate is Donald Trump, and that Syrvud intended to attempt to assassinate Trump today during an appearance in Cochise County. As my colleague Jennifer Van Laar noted in her piece, Trump was speaking with county law enforcement officials at the time of the earlier breaking news. Read More: [BREAKING: Cochise County Sheriff Searching for Man Who Threatened to Assassinate Trump in AZ Today](https://redstate.com/jenvanlaar/2024/08/22/breaking-cochise-county-sheriff-searching-for-man-who-threatened-to-assassinate-trump-in-az-today-n2178418) Now, local authorities say the manhunt has ended, with the man in custody. Arizona man accused of threatening to kill Trump nabbed after manhunt during former president's border visit— Fox News (@FoxNews) [https://t.co/Cyt2yzcjA1] [August 22, 2024] via [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/us/arizona-man-accused-threatening-kill-trump-nabbed-after-manhunt-during-former-presidents-border-visit): The Cochise County Sheriff’s Office told Fox News Digital it took 66-year-old Ronald Lee Syvrud into custody without incident. He was arrested around 2:30 p.m. local time in Cochise County. Charges against Syvrud are pending. The sheriff’s office said it also has an absconder hold for Syvrud for failing to register as a sex offender. ... Court records reviewed by Fox News Digital show Syvrud was most recently charged with assault in June, but that was dropped in July. The sheriff’s office said earlier that Syvrud has outstanding warrants from the state of Wisconsin for DUI, failure to appear for DUI and from Graham County, Arizona, for hit-and-run and felony failure to register as a sex offender. The report added that authorities told Fox News that it is not thought there were ties between Syvrud and the assassination attempt against the former president in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. Trump is scheduled to speak at a Turning Point USA (TPUSA) rally in Phoenix on Friday evening. RedState will provide updates on this breaking story as they become available. Editor's Note: This article was corrected after publication. We originally stated that Trump will be speaking at an event in Phoenix on Thursday. That event is scheduled for Friday. We regret the error.

    "text": "Russia anticipates the U.S. will eventually lift all restrictions on weapon usage in Ukraine, according to Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov. He criticizes the current U.S. administration's contradictory stance and calls for an end to hostile policies. Antonov doubts any dialogue or meetings with U.S. officials soon. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 23-08-2024 09:20 IST | Created: 23-08-2024 09:20 IST Russia suspects that the United States will ultimately lift all restrictions on the use of weapons supplied to Ukraine, Russian ambassador to the U.S. Anatoly Antonov told RIA news agency on Friday. Describing Washington's stance on U.S. weapons not being used for deep strikes into Russian territory as \"goading,\" Antonov expressed concern over future decisions to remove existing limits. The U.S. has furnished over $50 billion in military aid to Ukraine since 2022, with stated limitations on usage. Antonov stressed that meaningful dialogue with the U.S. would require Washington to desist from its \"hostile\" approach towards Russia. The ambassador also cast doubt on a potential meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken during next month's United Nations General Assembly. Furthermore, Antonov refuted any intentions of Moscow to interfere in the upcoming U.S. presidential elections. (With inputs from agencies.)

Ukraine Braces for Severe, Dark Winter as Russian Attacks Target Power Grid Fighting off damage to its power and energy infrastructure brought on by Russian assaults, Ukraine is readying for a harsh and dim winter. \"We're dealing with the most demanding winter in our history,\" spoke Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Haluschenko during a video conference. This winter is anticipated to be even more challenging than the previous one, given the culmination of damages from ongoing Russian attacks. The Russian military is utilizing various weapons in coordinated attacks to cause maximum damage, stated Haluschenko. Electricity consumption in a mild winter is around 18 gigawatts, while in a cold one it's 19 gigawatts. Moreover, a reserve of 1 gigawatt must be established, said Haluschenko. Russian attacks have destroyed approximately 9 gigawatts of capacity. 23:08 NATO Increases Security at Geilenkirchen Airbase In response to a potential risk, NATO has upgraded its security level at the airbase in Geilenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia.

The police confirmed their presence on the scene. More details, including the number of deployed forces, are not being disclosed. 22:07 Ukraine Declares Strike on Russian Base in Kursk Region The Ukrainian military has reported another attack on Russian forces in the Kursk region.

While certain obstacles, such as family-related situations, illness, war traumas, or necessary childcare, could hinder employment, the Green politician advised Welt TV, \"However, in general, it's preferable for everyone to work – better for the people, their integration, and for the social system.\" Habeck sounded skeptical towards statements made by Brandenburg's Minister-President and SPD politician Dietmar Woidke, who questioned the allowance of Ukrainian refugees. \"Probably due to the somewhat rough eastern German election campaigns and insufficient contemplation.\" 20:28 Ukrainian Troops Launch Counteroffensive in Charkiv Region The Ukrainian military has declared a push in the Charkiv region.

He attributes this to the Ukrainian offensive in the Russian region of Kursk.

Soldiers have since returned after rotation, but a decrease is currently being observed, especially among ground troops. 18:40 \"What's the point of Armenians?\" - Lukashenko sparks unrestBelarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko's remarks about Armenia have sparked unrest.

Who's Macron? Tomorrow, when Macron is gone, nobody will remember the Armenians,\" he said, alluding to the French president.

Two months before the target date, the EU is declared \"prepared for the next winter\".

According to data from the Gas Infrastructure Europe portal, there are differences between countries: Spain leads with 100%, while Latvia has the lowest at around 69%. Germany's storage is at 93.6%.

These robots have the capability to deactivate mines in hard-to-reach locations while maintaining a safe distance from the operators. Timothy Snyder said, \"One of the most heinous acts Russia has committed in Ukraine is the scattering of millions of mines.

With these robots, mines can be cleared, and lives can be saved.\" The removal of mines in Ukraine could take decades. 08:01 Kremlin Preparing Russians for \"New Reality\" The Ukrainian attack on Kursk poses a problem for Moscow's propaganda. Even though the regions are far away, according to an unnamed Kremlin-linked source, the intrusion of Ukrainian forces into Russian territory is a \"new and very unpleasant event.\" To pacify the now noticeably anxious mood, the Kremlin is working to prepare the Russians for a \"new reality\" and a \"new normal.\" The message is: The enemy has indeed invaded Russian territory, they are close to defeat - but the retrieval of the territory will take time, and the Russians must be patient. In the meantime, residents are encouraged to \"convert negativity and shock into a positive direction\" - namely by contributing aid for the Kursk region.

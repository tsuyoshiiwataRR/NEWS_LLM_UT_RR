    "text": "Taipei [Taiwan], August 23 (ANI): Taiwan detected 41 Chinese aircraft and seven Chinese vessels around its territory till 6am on Friday, Taiwan's Ministry of Defence stated.\nThe defence ministry stated that 32 aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's Eastern Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ). Following this, Taipei monitored the situation and responded accordingly.\nAlso Read |\nDonald Trump To Be Joined by 'Special Guest' at Arizona Rally: Live News Updates Today.\n\"41 PLA aircraft and 7 PLAN vessels operating around Taiwan were detected up until 6 a.m. (UTC+8) today. 32 of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern, southwestern and eastern ADIZ. ROC Armed Forces have monitored the situation and responded accordingly.\"\nhttps://x.com/MoNDefense/status/1826786440745025884\nAlso Read |\nIsrael-Hamas War: 16 Killed Including Woman and 3 Children in Israeli Strikes in Gaz.\nEarlier on Thursday, the Taiwanese MND detected eight PLA (People's Liberation Army) aircraft and six PLAN (People's Liberation Army Navy) vessels around its territory.\nThe MND stated that three aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's Eastern Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ).\nIn a post on X, the MND stated, \"8 PLA aircraft and 6 PLAN vessels operating around Taiwan were detected up until 6 a.m. (UTC+8). 3 of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's southwestern and eastern ADIZ. ROC Armed Forces have monitored the situation and responded accordingly.\"\nhttps://x.com/MoNDefense/status/1826425216974671916\nThis latest incident adds to a series of similar provocations by China in recent months. China has increased its military activities around Taiwan, including regular air and naval incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ and military exercises near the island.\nNotably, Taiwan has been governed independently since 1949. However, China considers Taiwan part of its territory and insists on eventual reunification, by force if necessary.\nSo far this month, Taiwan has tracked over 300 PLA aircraft and around 200 Chinese ships. Since September 2020, China has increased its use of grey zone tactics by incrementally increasing the number of military aircraft and naval vessels operating around Taiwan.(ANI)\n(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)",

    "text": "Is anyone tired of the Hamas terrorists, their Gazan enablers, and the games they play yet? The IDF recovered the bodies of six Israeli hostages last night. They were found dead in a tunnel in Khan Yunis.‚Äî Vivid.üáÆüá± (@VividProwess) Hamas kidnapped Israeli civilians alive on October 7, tortured them in an underground tunnel, and executed them. The Palestinians are the most evil people on Earth. [pic.twitter.com/6oCdgqh1B5] [August 20, 2024] Almost two weeks ago, the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) was investigating a horrifying claim by Hamas - mind you, it was Hamas' claim - that it had executed and wounded hostages. The Israel Defense Forces said on Monday night that it was investigating a claim made by Hamas that a hostage was executed and two others wounded in separate incidents in Gaza. Al Qassam Brigades spokesman Hudayfa Samir Abdallah al-Kahlout, known by the alias Abu Obeida, published a statement on Telegram on Monday claiming that one Israeli male captive had been executed and two female abductees seriously wounded by their Hamas captors. ‚ÄúIn two separate incidents, two [Hamas] soldiers assigned to guard enemy prisoners fired at a Zionist prisoner, killing him immediately, and also injured two female prisoners critically,‚Äù according to the statement. The terrorist group had established a committee to investigate the shootings, and efforts were being made to save the lives of the wounded hostages, it continued. Abu Obeida blamed the incidents on alleged Israeli ‚Äúmassacres‚Äù against Palestinians. THE ISRAELIS MADE US DO IT Naturally. Butchering terrorists who were still holding hostages they'd carried off after a murderous incursion would never think to do anything so vile on their own. The group did say they'd done all this in Gaza. Two days ago, the IDF found the bodies of six more hostages , one of whom had been presumed to still be alive, during a rescue operation in the Khan Yunis suburb of Gaza. Israel recovered the bodies of hostages Nadav Popplewell, Yagev Buchshtab, Yoram Metzger, Haim Peri, Alexander Dancyg, and Avraham Munder from the Khan Yunis area in Gaza, who were murdered in Hamas captivity, the IDF announced on Tuesday. The rescue operation was conducted by the IDF's 98th Division and carried out by the Paratroopers Brigade, 'Yahalom' Unit, and the 75th Battalion, along with ISA forces. The operation was done under military intelligence, ISA, and the IDF Intelligence Directorate Hostage Headquarters. It was announced by Kibbutz Nirim earlier that the bodies of Popplewell and Buchshtab were retrieved [from Gaza]. Similarly, Kibbutz Nir Oz announced earlier that morning that the bodies of Peri, Metzger, and Dancyg were also retrieved. [Munder]was believed to be alive until [Kibbutz Nir Oz]announced his death while in Gaza captivity. Horrifying and heartbreaking, and the assumption was they'd been murdered by their captors. Today, word came that the six had confirmed bullet wounds on their bodies. The worst fears are that they had, indeed, been summarily executed by the savages who have been holding them in wretched captivity for the better part of a year. Evidence of bullet wounds was found on the [bodies of the hostages]who were recovered from the Gaza Strip earlier this week, the IDF confirmed on Thursday. These are preliminary findings, the army stressed. The captives may have been killed by friendly fire. Alternatively, they may have been shot dead by their captures. It is not yet possible to determine the circumstances of the hostages‚Äô deaths definitively, the military underlined. The investigation is ongoing, and findings will be presented to families and the public, it said. ...According to the IDF report, marks indicating bullets and wounds were found on all six of the bodies. Additionally, four bodies that were found next to the [hostages]in the Gaza Strip are presumed to be the remains of the terrorists who were holding the six captives. No signs of gunshot wounds were observed upon the examination of these corpses. Butchering savages. IDF recovered 6 de@d hostages this week. Bullets were found in their bodies. They were executed by their Palestinian captors.‚Äî Marina Medvin üá∫üá∏ (@MarinaMedvin) [pic.twitter.com/S901DFBIX2] [August 22, 2024] I could not help crying listening to this mother last night. Her precious boy, half of his arm blown off and still in the hands of these animals. The agony every single day.

[pic.twitter.com/D2z6Jwq9lr] [August 22, 2024] And the Democrats are so beholden to the monsters among them that they could disrespect that pain and the suffering of a kidnapped fellow American by...celebrating his captors? The people who burn babies alive if they haven't already cut their heads off? By demanding those who support the slaughter of innocents from the cradle to the walking cane have a platform for their hate? YGTBFKM If we want the war in Gaza to end, we can‚Äôt put our heads in the sand or ignore the voices of the Palestinian Americans in the Democratic Party. If we want peace, if we want real democracy, and if we want to win this election, the Democratic Party must allow a Palestinian‚Ä¶‚Äî UAW (@UAW) [August 22, 2024] If we want the war in Gaza to end, we can‚Äôt put our heads in the sand or ignore the voices of the Palestinian Americans in the Democratic Party. If we want peace, if we want real democracy, and if we want to win this election, the Democratic Party must allow a Palestinian American speaker to be heard from the DNC stage tonight. This Jew-hate preaching, unAmerican piece of work is the perfect spokesperson for the moral bankruptcy infecting the Democratic party, the progressive, anti-American nutroots they've nurtured, and the homegrown stormtroopers the party has spawned, of whom they are now intimidated by and beholden to. Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud said the failure to allow a Palestinian American on the DNC stage is a \"glaring shortfall.\"‚Äî Beth LeBlanc (@DNBethLeBlanc) Some are feeling deflated + apathetic in the absence of real policy change, he added. \"I think apathy will be their choice.\" [August 22, 2024] These are truly awful people. I guess we should be glad we know where they all are.

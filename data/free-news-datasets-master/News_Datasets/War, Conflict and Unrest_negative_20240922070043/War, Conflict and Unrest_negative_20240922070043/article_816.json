    "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky assured today that Ukrainian forces understand what Moscow is trying to do on the Pokrovsk front, where the Russian army is advancing, and that Kiev is strengthening its forces accordingly in the region.\nIn his televised address, Zelensky also urged Kiev’s partners to stick to the agreed timetable for supplying the Ukrainian army with ammunition.\nHe added that the attack launched by his country in Russia’s Kursk region on August 6 was continuing and said that the Ukrainians controlled “some areas”, without elaborating.\nStatements from Soltz German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said today that Ukraine had not consulted his country about its August 6 invasion into Russia and that he expected the advance to be limited.\nSpeaking during a press conference after talks with Moldovan President Maya Sandu in Chisinau, he also said Germany would continue to be Ukraine’s biggest supporter in Europe.\nFor her part, Moldovan President Maya Sandu said that Berlin’s support for her country strengthens neighboring Ukraine and security in the region.\nHe also said that Moldova is open to investment and invited German businessmen to participate in the country’s first tender for renewable energy production.\nThreats at Russian airports Airports in Russia’s Arctic Circle cities of Murmansk and Apatity have begun to reopen after a brief airspace closure, civil aviation agency Rosaviatsia said.\nSince the start of the war in Ukraine, Russian airports have been frequently shut down due to potential or actual Ukrainian drone attacks.\nMurmansk Governor Andrei Tsibis confirmed the drone threat to the region today, but did not provide further details.\nSeveral Russian media outlets later published a video purported to show the downing of a drone in the Murmansk region. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the video.\nIn the Murmansk region there is an air base for strategic bombers near the city of Olenegorsk.\nRead also:\nTwo injured on Easyjet Corfu-London flight – It made an emergency landing in Rome\nLibya: Deterioration in politics, economy and security, sees the UN\nShipwreck in Sicily: All the bodies of the missing were recovered – Among them the two crois\n#RussiaUkraine #Clashes #Pokrovsk #Germany #Didnt #Kievs #Plans #Solz",

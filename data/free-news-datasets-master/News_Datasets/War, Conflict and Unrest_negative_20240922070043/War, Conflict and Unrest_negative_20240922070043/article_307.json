He did not specify which facility was attacked, which he said targeted an area in the village of Marinovka, where there is an air force base.\nRussiaâ€™s Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsya) said temporary restrictions were imposed on Thursday at Volgograd airport, suspending departures and arrivals.\n#Ukrainian #attempt #breach #Russian #border #thwarted",

    "text": "Servette held out for half-time against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the Conference League play-off first leg. The Grenat ultimately lost 2-0 in London and will have to pull off a resounding feat in Geneva in a week to continue their European journey.\nEven though Chelsea’s start was intense with the first ten minutes almost unbreathable, the control displayed by the Genevans in the first half was remarkable.\nAs in Braga two weeks earlier, they gave nothing away and could even have opened the scoring through Dereck Kutesa (14th) or Steve Rouiller (38th) with a bit more luck in front of goalkeeper Filip Jörgensen.\nTwo sins of gluttony on the revival However, two sins of greed at the restart weighed down the Grenat at the restart. A loss of the ball by Rouiller led to a penalty caused and converted by Christopher Nkunku for the opening score in the 50th minute. A few seconds later, it was Jérémy Frick who was this time blocked by Marc Guiu before restoring the situation at the cost of a miraculous double save.\nThe 2-0 came in the 76th minute. Noni Madueke went behind Bradley Mazikou and left no chance for the Servette goalkeeper. Despite all their bravery, the Genevans were unable to get back into the game. There were, of course, two chances for Jérémy Guillemenot in the 81st and 96th minutes, and a shot from Tiemoko Ouattara deflected onto the crossbar in the 86th minute. Without success.\nServette were valiant on the Chelsea pitch but, like Nkunku, the Londoners were the most cunning.

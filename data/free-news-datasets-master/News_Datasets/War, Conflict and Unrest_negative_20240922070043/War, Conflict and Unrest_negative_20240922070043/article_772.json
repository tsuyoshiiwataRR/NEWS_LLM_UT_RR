    "text": "WW3 fears explode as Russian drones spotted over key EU infrastructure Insiders have raised the alarm about a Russian military drone possibly flying over a German nuclear power plant, signaling another act of Kremlin espionage that has caused concern for the west. The incident involved an &quot;enemy object&quot; hovering over the shut-down facility and a natural gas terminal in Brunsbuttel, Schleswig-Holstein, according to Bild. The publication also noted that several other drones were seen nearby recently. An internal police report was quoted by Bild: &quot;The no-fly zone was violated several times by flying over the nuclear power plant. An enemy object, believed to be a military drone, was captured.&quot; Sources suggest the drone likely came from Russia and might have been sent from civilian vessels in the North Sea. The Flensburg public prosecutor&#039;s office is looking into the possibility of a sabotage attempt. There have also been sightings of unidentified drones over German military bases where Ukrainian forces are being trained. Marcus Faber, a member of the German parliament, expressed his concerns to Bild in January, saying, &quot;Drones are regularly spotted over the Klietz military training area, where the Bundeswehr (German military) trains Ukrainians (on Leopard 1 tank).&quot; Mr Faber implied that Russia was responsible for these occurrences and highlighted Germany&#039;s urgent need for better drone technology and modern jamming equipment. German politician, Andreas Schwarz, has voiced his concerns over Russia&#039;s potential spying activities, stating: &quot;We must not allow Russia to spy on military training areas with drones.&quot; By the end of August 2023, Germany had trained at least 6,000 Ukrainian soldiers, with a target of 10,000 by year-end. The training programs have included general combat training and the use of advanced equipment such as Patriot air defence systems and US-supplied Abrams tanks.

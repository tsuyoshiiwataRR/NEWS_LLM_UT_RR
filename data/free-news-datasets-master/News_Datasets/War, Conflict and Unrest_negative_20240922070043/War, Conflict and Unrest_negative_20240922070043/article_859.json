( KOLO /Gray News) – The son of a Creedence Clearwater Revival band member was charged with murder after two bodies were found in Nevada in separate events.\nRecords show Brent Chandler Clifford, 55, is the son of CCR drummer Doug Clifford, 79.\nBrent Clifford is facing charges in a complex case that officials in both Nevada and California are continuing to investigate.\nOfficials said Brent Clifford is the suspect in the shooting death of his friend William F. Andrews, 68.\nAndrews was found shot to death at a home on Keystone Avenue in Reno on Aug. 11. Police said the death was a homicide.\nFollowing Andrews’ death, Brent Clifford’s girlfriend Patricia Portella-Wright, 48, was also reported missing after she didn’t show up for work.\nPortella-Wright was dating Brent Clifford, according to the Reno Police Department. She was last seen on Aug. 4 and was reported missing Aug. 9.\nFollowing a search, her body was found on Aug. 15 at the bottom of an embankment off Mt. Rose Highway in Nevada, the Washoe County Regional Medical Examiner’s Office confirmed.\nThe coroner ruled her death a homicide and said her cause of death was “multiple sharp force injuries.”\nPortella-Wright was from Kings Beach, California, on Lake Tahoe. Her death is being investigated by the Placer County Sheriff’s Office in California.\nBrent Clifford was arrested in Portola, California on Aug. 14, the day before police found Portella-Wright’s body.\nBrent Clifford was arraigned in Placer County Court on charges related to Portella-Wright’s death and had his first court appearance on Aug. 16.\nBrent Clifford is charged with homicide and identity theft in the case.\nAccording to court documents, Brent Clifford obtained Portella-Wright’s personal identifying information without her consent and attempted to use her access card. Investigators said the total value exceeded $950.\nBrent Clifford is being held in the Placer County Jail in California without bail. He is expected back in court on Sept. 9.\nThe Reno Police Department said investigators are still working to determine what charges Brent Clifford will be facing in Nevada related to Andrews’ death.\nOfficials have not released a possible motive for the alleged murders or any further information as of Thursday.",

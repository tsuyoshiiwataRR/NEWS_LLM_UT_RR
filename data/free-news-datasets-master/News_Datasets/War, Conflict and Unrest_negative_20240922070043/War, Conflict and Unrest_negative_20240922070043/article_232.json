    "text": "POWHATAN POINT, Ohio — Authorities have identified the man who prompted a [3-and-a-half-hour standoff with police ](https://wtov9.com/news/local/person-in-custody-following-powhatan-point-standoff)on Wednesday in Powhatan Point. Ray Allen Fox, Jr., 46, was taken into custody. It happened along Industrial Street after a domestic violence incident was reported. Allen and a woman were in a mobile home with the Belmont County Special Operation Branch trying to coax them out. Eventually, the woman emerged from the trailer, but Allen did not. That's when the sheriff's office's K-9 took over. \"It was decided to breach the front door and have the K-9 Xyrem ready,” Belmont County Sheriff Dave Lucas said. “The subject was informed that the K-9 would be deployed if he did not exit the residence immediately.\" Fox exited the residence shortly after, around 5:30. He was placed in custody without incident. He is charged with violation of protection order, strangulation, domestic violence, kidnapping, and two charges of failure to appear. \"On domestic violence, it's very serious,” Lucas said. “Especially when, like this situation, for a period of time, she was inside the resident with him. So, we're on eggshells and we take our time with regards to come to a peaceful ending.\" Fox is being held in the Belmont County Jail with no bond. Powhatan police are handling the investigation, as they assisted with the situation. The state highway patrol and Belmont County Animal Shelter also assisted.",

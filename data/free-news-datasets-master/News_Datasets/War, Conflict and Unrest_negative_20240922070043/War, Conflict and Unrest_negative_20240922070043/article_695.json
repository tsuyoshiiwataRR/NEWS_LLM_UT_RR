    "text": "The president of SYRIZA – Progressive Alliance, Stefanos Kasselakis, comments on the decision of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to move to the burned areas, in Penteli, next Tuesday.\nAs Stefanos Kasselakis points out, “the prime minister decided to go to hell. Not now, next Tuesday. Ten days after the unprecedented disaster. Let the propaganda find some green left to put him forward to make a statement. Let the propaganda gather some members of the ND who will represent the satisfied citizens. To tell us about the “few” affected while our entire people has been affected”.\nAt the same time, the president of SYRIZA – PS repeated his proposal to Kyriakos Mitsotakis to go together to the fire-stricken areas, as he had mentioned yesterday.\nThe statement of Stefanos Kasselakis in detail:\n“The Prime Minister decided to go to hell.\nNot now, next Tuesday.\nTen days after the unprecedented disaster.\nLet the propaganda find some green left to put him forward to make a statement.\nLet the propaganda gather some members of the ND who will represent the satisfied citizens.\nTo tell us about the “few” affected while our entire people has been affected.\nI repeat the official proposal I made to him yesterday: Let’s go together. I was there for 4 days. I can show him around normal burns, meet normal people, so that he can have a normal sense of responsibility in the face of the magnitude of the tragedy.\nIn the meantime, the Panhellenic Association of Contract Firefighters is asking the Prime Minister to dismiss the Minister of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection, Mr. Kikilia.\nIn their statement, the people most responsible for the fires describe the extent of Mr. Kikilia’s responsibility.\nBut how can Nero 1 expel Nero 2?”\n#Kasselakis #Mitsotakis #hell #days #repeat #lets",

    "text": "The Ukrainian Air Force struck American GBU-39 bombs at Russian positions in the Kursk region. This is reported by the Russian Air Force service with reference to the telegram channel VS APU. The Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine published a video in TK, which allegedly shows strikes by American GBU-39 bombs on the stronghold of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in Kursk region. The BBC notes that for a long time Washington did not allow Ukraine to use the weapons transferred to them to strike targets on Russian territory, but the US position changed after the Russian offensive in the Kharkiv region in May this year. American officials now say that Ukraine has the right to strike at the territory of the Russian Federation near the border, \"because in this way it prevents attacks and shelling.\" Judging by the Western media, the same applies to the operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region, the BBC reports. GBU-39 is a high—precision gliding aerial bomb weighing more than 100 kg, which has a range of 110 km. As reported by [EADaily](https://eadaily.com/), the United States allows Kiev to [strike at Russia with American weapons](/ru/news/2024/08/22/ssha-razreshayut-kievu-primenyat-amerikanskoe-oruzhie-v-kurskoy-oblasti-pentagon) during the attack on the Kursk region. This was stated by Deputy Pentagon spokesman Sabrina Singh.",

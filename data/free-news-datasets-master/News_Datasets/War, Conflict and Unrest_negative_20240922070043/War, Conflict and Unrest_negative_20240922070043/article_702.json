    "text": "Lebanon â€“ Sources from Lebanon reported that the Israeli army launched a series of successive raids on a number of areas deep inside Lebanon and in southern Lebanon.\nThe simultaneous raids carried out by Israeli warplanes on southern Lebanon included the towns of: Khiyam, Muhaibib, Kfar Shouba, Aita al-Shaab, Ramya, Zebqin, Kawthariyet al-Sayyad, and Kfar Kila.\nIsraeli warplanes flew over the southern suburbs of Beirut at a medium level.\nSirens sounded in the UNIFIL centers in southern Lebanon before the Israeli raids.\nYesterday morning, Wednesday, the Israeli army launched a series of raids on the Bekaa region in eastern Lebanon, which, according to an unofficial tally from the Lebanese Ministry of Health, led to the death of one person and the injury of 20 others.\nThe ministry said that one of the wounded was in critical condition, while 9 others, a pregnant woman and 8 children, were moderately injured.\nFor its part, the Lebanese factions targeted the Katzrin settlement in the southern occupied Syrian Golan with dozens of missiles, which resulted in at least one person being injured and significant material damage.\nThe Lebanese factions also announced the bombing of the headquarters of the 210th Golan Division in the Nafah barracks and the headquarters of the Artillery Regiment and the Armored Brigade in the Yarden barracks.\nIt is worth noting that these operations may develop and turn into a comprehensive war between the Lebanese factions and Israel, as the Middle East is witnessing a state of anticipation and fear of the expansion of the conflict between Iran and the Lebanese factions on the one hand, and Israel on the other hand, and its transformation into a comprehensive war, following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in the capital, Tehran, and the assassination of the leader Fouad Shukr in an Israeli raid on a residential building in the southern suburb of Beirut.\nThe Lebanese factions and Iran vowed to respond to the assassinations, amid diplomatic mediations calling for restraint and not to be dragged into a regional war.\nSource: RT\n#series #successive #Israeli #raids #Lebanon #dawn #Thursday\n2024-08-22 20:08:03",

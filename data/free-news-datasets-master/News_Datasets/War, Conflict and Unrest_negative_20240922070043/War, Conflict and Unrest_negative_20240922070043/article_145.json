    "text": "Israeli demands for troops in Gaza blocking truce deal Disagreements over Israel’s future military presence in Gaza and over Palestinian prisoner releases are obstructing a ceasefire and hostage deal, according to 10 sources familiar with the round of US-mediated talks that concluded last week. The sources, who include two Hamas officials and three Western diplomats, told Reuters the disagreements stemmed from demands Israel has introduced since Hamas accepted a version of a ceasefire proposal unveiled by US President Joe Biden in May. All the sources said Hamas was especially concerned about the latest demand to keep troops deployed along the Netzarim Corridor, an east-west strip Israel cleared during the current war that prevents Palestinians’ free movement between north and south Gaza, as well as in a narrow border strip between Gaza and Egypt known as the Philadelphi Corridor. Israel’s current grip on the Philadelphi Corridor gives it control of Gaza’s frontier with Egypt, the enclave’s only crossing that does not border Israel. Arizona man wanted for threatening to kill Trump An Arizona man is wanted after threatening over social media to kill former President Donald Trump, the Cochise County Sheriff’s Office said on Aug 22. Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, is in Cochise County as he visits the US border with Mexico as part of his campaign. The man, Ronald Lee Syvrud, 66, has multiple outstanding warrants from Wisconsin, the sheriff’s office said. Russian attitudes about Putin might be shifting Negative feelings about Russian President Vladimir Putin have appeared to increase across Russia since Ukrainian troops pushed into Russian territory two weeks ago, according to a firm that tracks attitudes in the country by analysing social media and other internet postings. While news outlets in Russia have tried to put a more positive spin on the developments in the war, some Russian social media users have expressed discontent. Many of the online postings, according to the analysis by FilterLabs AI, say Ukraine’s advance is a failure of the Russian government and, more specifically, President Putin. World’s second-largest diamond found in Botswana A massive 2,492-carat diamond - the second largest in the world - has been discovered in Botswana, the Canadian mining company that found the stone announced on Aug 22. The diamond was discovered in the Karowe Diamond Mine in northeastern Botswana using X-ray detection technology, Lucara Diamond Corporation said in a statement. Lucara did not provide an estimation of the value of the find. In terms of carats, the stone is second only to the 3,016-carat Cullinan Diamond discovered in South Africa in 1905. Apple to let iPhone users in Europe delete its App Store Apple will allow iPhone and iPad users in the European Union delete the App Store or its Safari browser, the tech giant told developers on Aug 22. Apple had long fiercely protected the App Store as the lone gateway for digital content to get onto its popular mobile devices. The change comes as the company loosens its grip on devices in the EU due to the bloc’s landmark new digital rules. “The App Store, Messages, Camera, Photos, and Safari apps will be deletable for users in the EU,” Apple said on a support page for developers. “Only Settings and Phone will not be deletable.”",

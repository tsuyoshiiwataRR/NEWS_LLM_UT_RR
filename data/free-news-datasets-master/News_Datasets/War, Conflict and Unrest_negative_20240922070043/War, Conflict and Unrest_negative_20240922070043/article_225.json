    "text": "One 2024 presidential candidate visited the overrun and wildly insecure southern U.S. border this week, but it‚Äôs not the presidential candidate known as the Border Czar. Cackling Kamala Harris, the failed Border Czar, gives her speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) Thursday, as she is set to be hailed the successful coup leader ‚Äî ahem, 2024 presidential nominee. Meanwhile, amidst still-overwhelming numbers of illegal alien entrants at both the northern and southern borders, GOP nominee Donald Trump has headed to the scene of Kamala‚Äôs crime to survey the border crisis up close and personal. On Aug. 22, as he visited the border, Trump posted on TruthSocial, specifically critiquing Kamala, ‚ÄúThe millions of Illegal Aliens pouring into our Country because of Comrade Harris, our ‚ÄòBorder Czar,‚Äô and her Open Border Policies, are taking the jobs of our Black and Hispanic workers and families. BIG NUMBERS AND DISPLACEMENT. NOT FAIR! VOTE FOR TRUMP AND STOP THE MADNESS!!! THE UNIONS ARE NEXT!!!‚Äù Related: Northern Border Apprehensions Surge, Border Patrol Struggling Trump is right to note that Democrat open border policies hurt minorities and poorer American workers, the very groups Democrats love to claim that they are most dedicated to helping. Indeed, as of February, the administration‚Äôs touted job ‚Äúgains‚Äù were going to migrants rather than to U.S. men. With both the catastrophic Biden-Harris economy and open borders, leftist policies are most damaging to the Americans who allegedly have an ally in the Democrat Party. Nothing has changed about that since Abraham Lincoln in the mid-1800s called out how at variance Democrat propaganda and Democrat policies were with each other. Happening Now‚ÄîPresident Trump‚Äôs motorcade arriving at the Southern Border‚Ä¶‚Äî Dan Scavino Jr.üá∫üá∏ü¶Ö (@DanScavino) [pic.twitter.com/GS2cQUfPVV] [August 22, 2024] ‚ÄúSince Comrade Harris took over the border, there has been a 43% nationwide increase in violent crime and a 60% increase in rape,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúAnd the FBI should be ashamed of themselves when they report numbers, because they ‚Äî in order to keep the violence numbers down, they didn't report some of the worst cities in the country, like Chicago.‚Äù That is true and, as Trump likewise noted, disgraceful. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Since‚Äî AJ Huber (@Huberton) [#ComradeKamala]took over the border there has been a 43% nationwide increase in violent crime and a 60% increase in rape. In New York this June, an illegal alien released into our country by Kamala Harris approached two 13-year-old children with a‚Ä¶ [pic.twitter.com/UlvqBpvBQG] [August 22, 2024] In New York, Trump went on, in June, ‚Äúan illegal alien released into our country by Kamala approached two 13-year-old children with a machete[-like knife] in broad daylight in front of other people, forced them into the woods, tied them together by the wrist and raped them over and over again.‚Äù The former president also cited ‚Äútwo Kamala migrants‚Äù who ‚Äúwere just arrested for the rape of a 46-year-old woman in Coney Island. The migrants are accused of ‚Äúthrowing her to the ground and raping her with a knife to her throat. One of them had previously been arrested for raping another woman, but instead of being deported, he was released into our country.‚Äù That‚Äôs Kamunism at work, allowing violent criminals to invade the U.S. and terrorize Americans. Trump has made border security a key focus of his campaign. The border crisis regularly polls as among voters‚Äô top concerns, and it's no wonder. The House Committee on Homeland Security released its fact sheet this week updated with July data and explained, ‚Äútotal nationwide encounters exceeded 170,000 in July, including 104,116 along the Southwest border‚Äîbringing the grand total of nationwide encounters under the Biden-Harris administration to 10.1 million, a staggering 200-percent increase from FY17-FY20 combined.‚Äù The Congressional release added, ‚ÄúNotably, this does not include the roughly two million known gotaways recorded by CBP since the start of FY21.‚Äù That failure can be laid directly to Harris‚Äôs charge as the White House placed her in charge of handling the border for the Biden administration. The buck stops there.",

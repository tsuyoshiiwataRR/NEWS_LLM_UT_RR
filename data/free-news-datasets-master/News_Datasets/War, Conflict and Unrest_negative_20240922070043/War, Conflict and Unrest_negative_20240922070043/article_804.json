    "text": "Jakarta, CNN Indonesia —\nDavid de Gea they had a bad argument together Fiorentina when they play against Puskas Akademia in a UEFA Conference League playoff match at the Artemio Franchi Stadium, Florence, on Thursday afternoon (22/8) local time.\nAfter signing an official contract with Fiorentina for one year, last August 9, De Gea made his debut with the Italian Serie A club. The debut of the 33-year-old goalkeeper took place when Fiorentina hosted a Hungarian club, Puskas Akademia.\nThis is the first time in the last 446 days that De Gea has played a professional game. The last time De Gea played was when he played for Manchester United in the 2023 FA Cup final against Manchester City. At that time Man City won 2-1.\nSEVENTEEN\nCHECK TO CONTINUE WITH INDEX\nUnfortunately, the first match after 1 year, 2 months and 19 days of unemployment did not go well for De Gea. The Spanish goalkeeper immediately conceded three goals in his first game with Fiorentina.\nDe Gea’s goal even conceded two goals after just 12 minutes of the game. Puskas scored two goals through Zsolt Nagy and Mikael Soisalo.\nFiorentina recovered and turned things around 3-2 through goals from Riccardo Sottil, Lucas Martinez and Moise Kean. However, Puskas was finally able to score the third goal with Wojciech Golla.\n“It was a bad start, that’s clear, and it can’t be explained why. We made mistakes that I didn’t even see in training. I liked the team’s performance in the second half, the approach was good different from us,” said Fiorentina coach Raffaele Palladino of Italian Football.\nFiorentina will visit Puskas Akademia’s headquarters at the Pancho Arena on August 29 for the second leg. The winner of this match will qualify for the 2024/2025 UEFA Conference League group stage.\n[Gambas:Video CNN]\n(hair)\n2024-08-23 01:44:31\n#Gea #Debate #Conceded #Goals #Days #Earning",

    "text": "Middle East\nHouse in northern Israel hit by rocket fired from southern Lebanon: Report\nHezbollah claims responsibility for 12 separate attacks targeting Israeli soldiers, military sites in northern Israel\nJERUSALEM\nA house in the Upper Galilee region of northern Israel was hit by a rocket fired from southern Lebanon on Thursday, the Israeli media reported.\nAccording to the public broadcaster, KAN, a house in the Zarit settlement was \"directly hit\" and sustained material damage due to a rocket fired from southern Lebanon, with no casualties reported.\nThe broadcaster also noted that sirens sounded in several areas of the Upper Galilee.\nMeanwhile, Hezbollah said in several statements that by 1600 GMT on Thursday, it carried out 12 attacks on soldiers and military sites in northern Israel, including targeting buildings used by soldiers in the Zarit settlement.\nThe Lebanese group said it also targeted buildings used by Israeli troops in the Manara and Metula settlements and shelled the Israeli Biranit barracks with heavy artillery.\nIt said that it targeted the Marj, Ghajar, and Malkia military sites with artillery shells and “appropriate” weapons, as well as the Al-Samaqa site with rockets.\nAdditionally, the group claimed to have struck Israeli soldiers stationed around the Metula site and the Avivim barracks with “appropriate weapons.”\nThe group also claimed that it carried out a drone strike on Israeli soldiers stationed in the Kiryat Shmona settlement and targeted spy equipment at the Jabal Al-Alam military site.\nFears of a full-fledged war between Israel and Hezbollah have grown amid an exchange of cross-border attacks, especially after the July 30 assassination of senior Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukr in Beirut.\nThe escalation comes against the backdrop of a deadly Israeli onslaught on Gaza which has killed over 40,200 people since last October following an attack by the Palestinian resistance group Hamas.\n*Writing by Mohammad Sio in Istanbul\nAnadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

    "text": "BJYM's 'Yuva Aakrosh Rally' Faces Prohibitory Orders in Ranchi Ahead of the BJYM's ‘Yuva Aakrosh Rally’ in Ranchi, prohibitory orders were enforced banning public meetings and gatherings. The BJP accused the Hemant Soren government of silencing dissent before the assembly elections. The district administration cited potential disruptions to government work and public order as reasons for the orders. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Ranchi | Updated: 23-08-2024 10:29 IST | Created: 23-08-2024 10:29 IST - Country: - India In a significant political development, the administration in Ranchi has clamped prohibitory orders ahead of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha's (BJYM) 'Yuva Aakrosh Rally' scheduled for Friday. The orders ban any public meetings, rallies, or gatherings near Morabadi Ground from 11 am to 11 pm. The BJP has criticized this move, calling it an attempt to stifle dissent against the Hemant Soren-led Jharkhand government. \"Hardly two months are left for this government, and they're already taking desperate measures to silence us,\" a BJP spokesperson remarked. Enforced under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS), replacing Section 144 of the CrPC, the orders aim to maintain public order. Carrying weapons and using loudspeakers have also been prohibited within a 500-meter radius of the rally site. (With inputs from agencies.)

    "text": "Bullets have been found in the bodies of all of the hostages recovered by the IDF from Gaza earlier this week. This discovery has led the IDF to assess that the hostages were likely murdered by Hamas while in captivity.\nThe victims—identified as Alex Dancyg, Yagev Buchshtav, Chaim Peri, Yoram Metzger, Nadav Popplewell, and Avraham Munder—were recovered from a hidden tunnel complex during a military operation between Monday and Tuesday. The IDF representatives presented the autopsy results to the families of the deceased, which were conducted at the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute. While the initial findings suggest gunfire as the cause of death, health and military officials have yet to determine the exact circumstances.\nDuring the recovery operation, IDF forces discovered four additional bodies near the hostages. These bodies, believed to belong to terrorists, displayed no signs of gunfire, according to the forensic institute.\nThe operation occurred amid intensified military actions in Khan Younis, with the IDF locating the bodies in a concealed tunnel shaft approximately 10 meters deep. No resistance was encountered within the tunnel itself, though forces clashed with armed militants nearby. Several terror operatives were killed, while others fled as the IDF established control over the area.\nIn response to the autopsy findings, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum condemned the brutality of the hostage-takers. “The discovery of bullets in the hostages’ bodies is further proof of the cruelty of the terrorists who have held 109 hostages for 321 days,” the group said in a statement. They called for urgent action, warning that any further delay could result in more hostage deaths.\nThe forum criticized the lack of progress in securing the hostages’ release, describing the recovery of the six bodies as “a testimony of the complete failure to reach a deal in time.”\n( YWN World Headquarters – NYC )",

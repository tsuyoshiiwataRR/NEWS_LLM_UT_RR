Police fired tear gas and water cannons at protesters, some of whom carried a mock guillotine featuring the face of outgoing President Joko Widodo. Similar demonstrations erupted across other major cities, including Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, and Makassar.\nIndonesian lawmakers were meeting in an emergency session to ratify legislation to overturn one ruling that the country’s Constitutional Court made earlier this week and to amend a second. If passed, the legislation would have expanded the political influence of Widodo and his successor, Prabowo Subianto , by letting Widodo’s son run for a regional deputy governor position and potentially paving the way for allies of Widodo and Prabowo to contest elections in Central Java and Jakarta virtually unopposed. Protesters called on the parliamentarians to respect the two court rulings.\nThe first ruling, on Tuesday, dismissed a case challenging age limits on people under 30 seeking regional governorships. Parliament wished to change the limits, allowing Widodo’s youngest son, 29-year-old Kaesang Pangarep, to run for office in Central Java.\nKaesang would not be the only member of Widodo’s family in power were he to win a seat come November. Widodo’s eldest son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, will be sworn in as vice president on Oct. 20 alongside Prabowo. Gibran was only allowed to run for vice president due to the Constitutional Court ruling last October that people under age 40 could run for the top offices if they had previously been elected to a regional post.\nCritics of Widodo’s administration denounced that ruling, arguing that then-Chief Justice Anwar Usman should not have participated in the case because he is Widodo’s brother-in-law. Anwar was later dismissed over the controversy.\nAlso on Tuesday, the Constitutional Court ruled in favor of abolishing a threshold rule that required political parties and coalitions to hold 20 percent of legislative seats or 25 percent of the popular vote in order to nominate candidates for regional heads, the highest such threshold in the world. The court issued a new stipulation saying parties and coalitions need just 7.5 percent of the popular vote for provinces with 6 million to 12 million eligible voters and only 6 percent of the popular vote for provinces with more than 12 million eligible voters.\nActivists hailed the ruling as a win for democracy, arguing that the decision hinders the Onward Indonesia Coalition’s efforts to create a broad coalition to prevent opposition candidate Anies Baswedan from running for the coveted governorship of Jakarta. But lawmakers aimed to amend the ruling on Thursday to once again raise the nomination threshold.\nLegal experts and political analysts have described these power struggles as bordering on a constitutional crisis for the world’s third-largest democracy and fourth most populous country. Widodo has downplayed these amendments, though, calling them just part of government “checks and balances.”\nSufmi Dasco Ahmad, the deputy speaker of Indonesia’s House of Representatives, ultimately postponed Thursday’s emergency plenary session over the unrest, first citing the body’s failure to meet a quorum before caving to protesters’ demands. The vote won’t be held until parliament’s next sitting period, meaning that any possible changes to the court’s decisions would not apply to Widodo’s outgoing administration or regional elections slated for November.\nToday’s Most Read Preparing for a Less Arrogant America by Michael Hirsh Ukraine’s Offensive Bolsters Russia’s Separatists by Justin Ling DNC Offers Few Clues on Harris’s Foreign Policy by Robbie Gramer and Amy Mackinnon",

    "title": "Ferry Carrying Fuel Tanks Sinks In Russian Port After Ukraine Missile Strike",
    "text": "Ukrainian forces sank a Russian ferry carrying fuel tanks in a missile strike on a port in Russia's southern Krasnodar region on August 22, Russian officials said.\n\"As a result of the damage, the ferry sank in the waters of the Kavkaz port,\" the Krasnodar region's operational headquarters said on Telegram.\nThe headquarters reported earlier that \"a railroad ferry with fuel tanks in the Kavkaz port was attacked\" and that emergency services had been dispatched. Images circulating on social media showed a plume of dark smoke rising in the area of the ferry crossing.\nThe port sits in the Kerch Strait separating Russia from Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow illegally annexed in 2014.\n-snip-\nFyodor Babenkov, the district head of the Russian town of Temryuk, was quoted by Reuters as saying the ferry was carrying 30 fuel tanks. The vessel sustained significant damage as a result of the attack, which caused a fire, Babenkov said.\nThe Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti said five people were on the vessel at the time of the attack and were unaccounted for. The Russian online news channel Baza reported that the number of people on board was 15 and all were missing.\nAll port employees were evacuated, TASS reported citing the Transport Ministry.",

    "text": "Rep. Pat Ryan of New York joined the lineup of speakers at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday, marking the final evening of a whirlwind four-day event that saw Vice President Kamala Harris accepting her party&#039;s nomination for president. Ryan, a 42-year-old Iraq War veteran, represents New York&#039;s 18th Congressional District. During his speech at the DNC, he touched on his military service and told the crowd that Harris is the right choice for president because she will support military veterans and troops. Rep. Pat Ryan (N.Y.) speaks during the final day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center. &quot;I&#039;ll tell you what I think of [former President Donald Trump], they told me I can&#039;t say that word on TV, I&#039;m going to use an Army term: FUBAR,&quot; Ryan said. Start the day smarter. Get all the news you need in your inbox each morning. What to know about Rep. Pat Ryan Who is he: Despite being seen as the underdog, Rep. Pat Ryan won a congressional seat in the 19th district through a special election in November 2022. After a redistricting process, he won a second race for the 18th district just three months later. What role he plays: Much of Ryan&#039;s time in office has focused on veterans&#039; issues. Recently, he dispatched caseworkers throughout his community to ensure veterans and their families secured federal benefits. Ryan also graduated from the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, which resides in his district. Key quote: &quot;At West Point, you learn the honor code: A cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do. Well there&#039;s a candidate who has violated every word in that code, a serial liar, cheater, thief, who looked soldiers in the eye then turned around and called fallen heroes &#039;suckers and losers,&#039; who insulted Medal of Honor recipients just last week,&quot; he said, referring to Trump, the Republican nominee for president.

    "text": "Photo: Shutterstock.com China is upset with Germany’s possible decision to send warships through the Taiwan Strait, warning that it would be seen as meddling in China’s internal matters. The warning came after reports that two German naval ships — the frigate Baden-Württemberg and the supply ship Frankfurt am Main — might sail through the 180-kilometer-wide strait next month. If Germany proceeds, it would be the first time since 2002 that German warships have navigated the sensitive waters between Taiwan and mainland China, according to Militarnyi. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and sees the strait as under its control, making any foreign military presence there highly provocative.

He noted that weather conditions could influence the final decision. &quot;We are showing our flag here to demonstrate that we stand by our partners and friends, our commitment to the rules-based order, the peaceful solution of territorial conflicts, and free and secure shipping lanes,&quot; Schulz added. In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning made it clear that Taiwan is part of China and that opposing Taiwan&#039;s independence is key to regional stability. &quot;Beijing has always opposed any actions that undermine China’s territorial sovereignty and security under the pretense of freedom of navigation,&quot; she told reporters. This potential move by Germany follows similar actions by other NATO allies like the U.S. and Canada, whose warships have regularly passed through the Taiwan Strait. The German ships, currently in Tokyo after a long journey across the Atlantic and Pacific, are set to join regional exercises with forces from countries like France, Japan, and the United States.

    "text": "As many as 15 policemen lost their lives when the riverine dacoits ambushed two police mobile vans in Rahim Yar Khan on Tuesday. The police sources said around two-dozen police personnel were deployed at Machka Camp 2 in the riverine area. They were returning to Rahim Yar Khan in two police mobile vans for weekly holiday when one of their vehicles broke down due to stagnant floodwater in the area. Seeing policemen trapped in the rainwater, the riverine dacoits fired rockets at the police party, leaving 15 of them dead. Two policemen sustained injuries in the attack while four were missing. Police reinforcements were dispatched to the riverine area immediately after the incident and security personnel were put on high alert across the province. The Punjab government declared emergency at Shaikh Zaid Hospital and THQ Hospital Sadiqabad. Additionally, doctors' holidays have been cancelled and they have been directed to report to duty. Taking notice of the incident, Chief Minister Punjab Marriyum Nawaz Sharif and IG Punjab Dr Usman Anwar sought report from RPO Bahawalpur and DPO Rahim Yar Khan. Meanwhile, a police spokesman confirmed the deaths of nine policemen in the attack, adding four others were injured. Condemnations pour in President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the attack on a police convoy by riverine area dacoits in Rahim Yar Khan. A press release from the President's House stated that the president extended his condolences to the families of the police officers, who were martyred in the attack. The president emphasized the need for strict action against criminals in the Kacha area and warned that attacks on personnel of police and law enforcement agencies would not be tolerated. He paid tribute to the martyred policemen and prayed for their elevated ranks. He also wished for the speedy recovery of those injured in the incident. Punjab Chief Minister Marriyum Nawaz condemned the attack on policemen and expressed condolences with the bereaved families. Deputy Commissioner Khurram Parvaiz expressed grief over the deaths of policemen in the outlaws' attack. He said the perpetrators of the heinous attack will be made an example. He added that such cowardly actions could not shake the morale of the government and the law-enforcement personnel. The lawyers' fraternity announced a day of mourning. A press release issued by the District Bar Association said the lawyers' community will observe a day of mourning over the incident. The lawyers expressed solidarity with the police and described the incident as a cowardly act. COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

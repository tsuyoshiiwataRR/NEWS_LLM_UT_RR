    "text": "- India\nInternational\n2017 Lucknow case: Gangster, 7 aides get life term for oil trader murder\nThe trader allegedly faced threats from gangster Akeel Ansari who warned him not to pursue his son’s murder case\nA CBI court in Lucknow on Thursday sentenced gangster Akeel Ansari and seven of his associates to life imprisonment for their alleged involvement in the murder of a Lucknow-based oil trader in February 2017.\nIt was alleged that Shrawan Sahu (55), the trader, faced threats from gangster Akeel Ansari, who had warned him not to pursue the murder case of his son Ayush Sahu (26) who was shot dead outside a beer shop in 2013.\nAnsari was the prime accused in Ayush’s murder.\nIn 2020, a court in\nLucknow had sentenced Ansari and his associate Azeem Khan, alias Babu to life imprisonment for Ayush’s murder.\nAfter Shrawan refused to comply with the gangster’s instructions, he was shot dead by two assailants at his residence in the Saadatganj area of Lucknow, it was alleged. He had sustained five bullets.\nEight persons, including Ansari, were booked in connection with the murder. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) took over the investigation on the recommendation of the state government.\nOn Thursday, the court found Ansari, Satyam Patel, Azeem Khan, Aman Singh, Vivek Verma, Ajay Patel, Rohit Mishra, and Faisal guilty under Sections 302 (murder) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. Aman, Vivek, Ajay, Rohit, Azeem and Faisal, who were out on bail, were taken into custody. Ansari and Satyam Patel were already in jail.\nAshish Kumar Saxena, senior public prosecutor for the CBI, said the court examined 51 prosecution witnesses and reviewed 101 documentary exhibits, 51 material exhibits during the trial. Seven defence witnesses were also examined by the court, he added.\nAccording to the prosecution, it was found during the investigation that Ansari initially threatened Shrawan to dissuade him from pursuing his son’s murder case.\nAnsari then tried to frame Sahu in a false criminal case to exert pressure on him. When even this didn’t work, Ansari then orchestrated Sahu’s murder with the help of his associates, it was alleged.\nFive days before eliminating Sahu, Ansari surrendered before a court in another case to evade police suspicion and that his associates executed the murder when he himself was behind bars, it was claimed.\nThe CCTV cameras installed at Sahu’s shop played a crucial role in identifying the assailants, the investigators said. It was found that Sahu’s murder was premeditated with a thorough reconnaissance conducted by the accused.\nIn the Ayush murder case, the police had filed charges against Akeel and his associate Azeem alias Baba. In January 2017, a case was filed against Shrawan, accusing him of hiring shooters to kill Akeel. But during the investigation, these allegations were found to be baseless and a closure report was filed, according to the prosecuting officer.\nAfter filing chargesheet, the CBI had recommended a departmental inquiry against the then Lucknow Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Manzil Saini, alleging negligence in the Shrawan murder case. But an inquiry panel formed by the state government this year to probe the allegations against Saini gave him a clean chit, sources said.\nClick here to join The Indian Express on WhatsApp and get latest news and updates\n5% of the total seats will remain vacant St Stephen's College has exceeded its sanctioned number of seats by 5%, with the addition of a 'single girl child' quota.

Containers were placed at different locations; however, a small passage had been left for motorists.\nThe district administration also keep all the public and private educational institutions closed in the city.\nThe administration made the decision in view of a scheduled jalsa of the PTI and a protest call by a religious party.\nDue to the blockage of roads, motorists faced problems and majority of people did not reach their destination on time. However, following the rescheduling of its public gathering for September 8, the administration opened all roads leading to the capital city. However, they kept the Red Zone sealed and put security on high alert in and outside of the Red Zone as the hearing of the Mubarak Sani case continued till late evening.\nDue to sealing of Red Zone heavy rush of motorists was observed at Margalla Road – one of the entry points which was kept open for going to the Red Zone.\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2024",

    "text": "[+](javascipt:void(0);) Gunmen armed with rocket-propelled grenades have ambushed a police convoy in Rahim Yar Khan district, eastern Punjab, resulting in at least 11 officers killed and seven others wounded. The attack, which occurred on Thursday, targeted the officers as they patrolled a remote area in search of robbers known to operate in the region. The assailants are suspected to be robbers rather than militants. The ambush took place in a particularly challenging area known for bandit hideouts along the Indus River. It is believed that one of the police vehicles broke down due to accumulated rainwater in the fields, which made the convoy vulnerable to the assault. Pakistan has been experiencing heavy monsoon rains since July, which may have exacerbated the situation. This attack is notable for its severity, as such a high number of police casualties in a single incident is rare in recent years. The incident has prompted swift condemnation from national leaders, including President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi. They have expressed sorrow, labeled the fallen officers as martyrs, and urged immediate action against the perpetrators. Sharif has also demanded the best medical care for the wounded officers. Earlier the same day, a separate attack saw gunmen open fire on a school van in Punjab, killing two children and wounding six others. No group has claimed responsibility for either attack. The surge in violence and attacks in Pakistan underscores ongoing security challenges, particularly in rural and underserved areas.",

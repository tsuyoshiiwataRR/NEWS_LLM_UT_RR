    "text": "The situation in Donetsk Oblast looks really troublesome for Ukraine. Since the Ukrainian balls-to-the-wall heroic stand in Avdiivka which proved very costly for Russia, the Russians have nevertheless seemingly been on an inexorable march to the next great prize … the Pokrovsk agglomeration of many villages, lakes, rivers and the major transit hub city itself. Village after village, defensive line after defensive line have fallen to the Russian meat assaults and the Ukrainians are back-peddling. A general evacuation has been called and is being enforced in the area. It all looks terrible and awfully gloomy for the Ukrainians, doesn’t it? Well, maybe not. I do not drink or smoke any of the interesting things I once did in my youth so I don’t know what has gotten into my mind regarding the Ukrainian situation in Donetsk Oblast. But I believe the Ukrainians are up to something here. It is not new in war. Heck it is not even new in the game of football. In the movie “Remember the Titans”, when the T.C. Williams High School team, the underdog against one of the top teams in their conference fell behind and were seemingly on their way to losing the game, the situation got even worse … they lost their starting quarterback. In comes the back up QB. With the play called by the coach in mind, he tells one of his offensive line men, Louie Lastik to let the opposing line go by him. What? “Trust me” says the QB. What followed was a glorious display of falling back against the all out onslaught and in the moment defeat the vaunted attackers by attacking their rear and wings. The underdog Titans won that game and went on to win the State Championship: Something akin is happening in the Russo-Ukrainian war. Russia is being drawn farther and farther away from their supply lines, increasing reports of manpower shortages and Ukraine harassing their rear and wings … in Crimea, Krasnodar, Kursk/Belgorod/Bryansk and even farther afield in Russia proper. And news comes today that Ukraine has launched a so far successful brigade size counter-offensive in Kharkiv. Could this lead to something bigger? For now it is supposed to set possible conditions for follow-on attacks. We shall see. global.espreso.tv/... Nevertheless it is becoming increasingly clear that Ukraine intends, along with the rope-a-dope in Pokrovsk, to push Russia away from their deeply ingrained military doctrine of cage match fighting in which the static battle line suits their style of overwhelming meat assaults and everything, including the kitchen sink, thrown in for good measure. Taking the Crimea trans-Kerch supply lines out and pushing them onto long winding highways and by ways where they are vulnerable to Ukrainian drones, Atesh Resistance spotters and long distance fires will make the coming months very difficult for Russia. Pokrovsk is shaping up to be a titanic battle which will last well into the fall and winter. My humble yet fearless prediction? Pokrovsk will be Russia’s culmination point. Winter is coming.

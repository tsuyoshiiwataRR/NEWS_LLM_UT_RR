    "text": "Anti-war and social justice activists are getting ready to protest a weapons industry convention at the Melbourne Convention Centre between September 8-13. Land Forces, which bills itself as the “premier platform for defence, industry and government”, is one of the military industrial complex’s annual “meet and greet”. It will feature Elbit, Lockheed, Boeing, Hanwha, Thales and NIOA, some of the biggest weapons makers in the world. The protest — [Disrupt Land Forces](https://disruptlandforces.org/) — endorsed by more than 50 organisations, including Socialist Alliance, aims to bring the power of the pro-Palestine [anti-genocide mass movement](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/protesters-call-out-labors-rejection-visas-palestinians-fleeing-genocide), which has [held Labor to account for more than 45 weeks](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/protesters-call-out-labors-rejection-visas-palestinians-fleeing-genocide), together with the anti-AUKUS and First Nations movements. Victorian Labor has thrown its full backing behind what some call the “one stop genocide shop”. The fact that Labor is a “principle sponsor” should come as no surprise. Labor governments, since Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, have been firmly in the imperialist camp. But the major parties are not just willing to go along with the United States’ global plans for war and militarisation, they are [enthusiastic participants](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/australia-seeks-bigger-slice-destructive-global-arms-trade). Former Coalition defence minister Christopher Pyne in 2017 said his mission was to make Australia a “world player” in the arms trade. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, in 2018, announced Australia was aiming to be one of the top 10 weapons exporters — war profiteers in the world. Federal Labor, under Anthony Albanese and Richard Marles, has embraced the Coalition’s push for Australia to set up its weapons’ manufacturing. In fact, Marles wants to turn Drilling /Geelong into a major weapons manufacturing hub. He has tried to justify this on the grounds of “investment” and “job opportunities”. But this has been contested, [again](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/anti-war-protesters-keep-pressure-richard-marles) and [again](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/peace-activist-metal-shops-should-be-helping-climate-transition-not-preparing-war), including that scarce funds must be allocated to the transition away from fossil fuels that the climate emergency demands. Protesting the Land Forces expo will also help in the fight to stop Australia aiding Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Despite it purporting to support a ceasefire, Australia is complicit in Israel’s murderous aggression because it has not stopped arms exports and not withdrawn political support for Israel. Labor is also supporting the United States’ “ [Operation Prosperity Guardian](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-23/australia-take-command-of-red-sea-shipping-operation/104256900)”, a military offensive against Yemen, for its steadfast support for Palestine, taking command in late August of the [aggressive force in the Red Sea](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/us-british-and-australian-attacks-yemen-spread-middle-east-war). Land Forces advertises itself as a “networking space” for weapons dealers. A critical part of the Palestine solidarity movement has been to expose and disrupt Australian [weapons manufacturing, including parts, being shipped to Israel](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/community-picket-shuts-down-hta-weapons-facility). Australia provides a key link in the US’s military-industrial complex, [through US bases](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/australians-being-kept-dark-about-pine-gap-expansion), and raising hell about that is a way we can show our solidarity with oppressed peoples everywhere, including in Palestine. [Disrupt Land Forces](https://disruptlandforces.org/events/) will be an important protest against the unjust world order of war-profiteering imperialism in which Australia’s ruling class reaps the spoils. The struggles of First Nations peoples will also be highlighted on September 10, including a march to the Philippines Consulate. A mass rally has been called for September 11 at 10am, the opening day of the weapons’ convention. We must use opportunity to protest Australian support for Israel’s genocide in Gaza and the Occupied Territories. We also need to call out the US and Israel’s provocative behaviour towards Iran and China. The ruling class tries to convince workers to defend “national security”. But the Australian working class will not benefit from US dominance over the Middle East or from an AUKUS-led war on China. Rather, our security would be better served by fighting for a peaceful, independent Australia, which does not seek to exploit or push its neighbours into joining a potentially disastrous war in the South Asian region. If you agree, come to Disrupt Land Forces and become a [supporter of Green Left](https://www.greenleft.org.au/support?type=long_term), the media project which, since 1991, has stood with those struggling for society’s resources to be used collectively for people and the planet.",

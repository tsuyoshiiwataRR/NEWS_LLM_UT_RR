ROC Armed Forces have monitored the situation and responded accordingly.\" This latest incident adds to a series of similar provocations by China in recent months. China has increased its military activities around Taiwan, including regular air and naval incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ and military exercises near the island. Notably, Taiwan has been governed independently since 1949. However, China considers Taiwan part of its territory and insists on eventual reunification, by force if necessary. So far this month, Taiwan has tracked over 300 PLA aircraft and around 200 Chinese ships. Since September 2020, China has increased its use of grey zone tactics by incrementally increasing the number of military aircraft and naval vessels operating around Taiwan.\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nAlso Read Taiwan defence spend to outpace expected GDP growth as China threat rises Taiwan launches live-fire missile drills as China ramps up military threats Taiwan boosts efforts to stop Chinese boats from operating across borders Taiwan detects 13 Chinese aircrafts, 7 vessels near its territory Taiwan detects 11 PLA military aircraft crossing median line in its ADIZ Topics : Taiwan China Chinese air force Chinese navy Don't miss the most important news and views of the day.

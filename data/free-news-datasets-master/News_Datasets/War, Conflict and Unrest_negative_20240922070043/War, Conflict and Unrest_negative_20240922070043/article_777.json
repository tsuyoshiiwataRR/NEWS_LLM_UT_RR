    "text": "Trump uses 'racist slur' against senator as he furiously 'live truths' while watching DNC The Democratic National Convention comes to a dramatic end on Thursday night with Kamala Harris' speech - and Donald Trump is watching. [Donald Trump](/latest/donald-trump) is watching the final night of the Democratic National Convention - and his 'live Truthing' has already caused a scandal. Trump has missed many powerful moments at the DNC this week, with [Tim Walz's 17-year-old son breaking down in tears](/news/politics/146600/tim-walz-s-17-year-old-son-breaks-down-tears-father-s-dnc-speech) and [Michelle Obama slamming Trump like a naughty schoolbo](/news/politics/146564/michelle-obama-donald-trump-chicago-dnc-democrats-kamala-harris)y as the [Democrats move to the right on key policies.](/news/politics/146637/democrat-policy-immigration-policing) But he's definitely watching on Thursday night as headline act [Kamala Harris](/latest/kamala-harris) takes to the stage. [Donald Trump humiliated as Fox News corrects him over Harris claim seconds after interview](/news/politics/146665/donald-trump-humiliated-fox-news-kamala-harris-putin-claim) [JD Vance gets weird on trip to donut shop after being rejected by worker on film](/news/politics/146666/jd-vance-awkward-conversation-Georgia-donut-shop) The former president is doing a \"live play by play' on Truth Social - and his first target was Massachusetts Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren. He wrote: \"Pocahontas is now speaking at the DNC. She used her fake Indian heritage to scam the system. Her mother told her she had “high cheekbones,” and therefore she was Indian, who would use this hoax on applications everywhere. It worked until she got caught. 10024th Indian, remember?\" Trump has a long-standing feud with Warren, and it's not the first time he's used the 'Pocahontas' nickname. The 78-year-old has taken delight in taunting Warren over claims about her Native American heritage - with many claiming the nickname is a 'racial slur'. As a teacher during the 80s and 90s, Warren formally notified administrators at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard law schools that she had partial Native American heritage and was listed as a Native American faculty member. But she's faced allegations of using her ancestry to advance her career, something Trump has been keen to remind her of. Trump previously said he would give a million dollars to charity if Warren will take a test proving her heritage. DON'T MISS: In 2018, Warren did take a DNA test which showed \"strong evidence\" of some Native American ancestry. \"While the vast majority of the individual’s ancestry is European, the results strongly support the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor in the individual’s pedigree, likely in the range of 6-10 generations ago,\" the report read. This morning, Trump was humiliated after [giving a live interview on Fox News as he falsely claimed Kamala Harris had previously met with Vladimir Putin](/news/politics/146665/donald-trump-humiliated-fox-news-kamala-harris-putin-claim). Moments after Trump hung up the phone following an interview with Fox & Friends, co-host Brian Kilmeade [moved quickly to set the record straight about Harris](/news/politics/146459/Michelle-Obama-dnc-chicago-kamala-harris-democrats-barack-trump-Donald). Brutal. Brian Kilmeade fact checks Donald Trump's claims that Kamala Harris met with Vladmir Putin, \"We don't have confirmation.\"— American Bridge 21st Century (@American_Bridge) Even the other Fox News hosts are shocked, \"I've heard that said a lot. You don't have confirmation that that is true?\" [pic.twitter.com/uX0GybAuhE] [August 22, 2024] It is the second time Trump has falsely claimed Harris met up with Putin [days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine](/news/world-news/146559/russian-tombstone-maker-rant-kursk-invasion-ukraine) as he made a similar comment at a rally in North Carolina on Wednesday. Trump claimed: \"Biden sent, I call her Comrade Kamala, sent comrade Kamala to see Putin in [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) three days before the attack. She went, she said, she gave her case, he attacked three days later.' Setting the record straight, Kilmeade said seconds after the Republican 2024 nominee hung up: \"Just as a quick clarification, we don’t have confirmation that the Vice President went to [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) to meet with [Vladimir Putin](https://www.the-express.com/latest/vladimir-putin). \"I know she went over to Europe right before the incursion when [Russia](https://www.the-express.com/latest/russia) invaded [Ukraine](https://www.the-express.com/latest/ukraine). And it’s a war there’s still going on right now.\"",

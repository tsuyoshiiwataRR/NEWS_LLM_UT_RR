    "text": "By William Frost ,\n44 minutes ago\nThree players from the Los Angeles Chargers have not participated in practice this week, raising concerns about their readiness for the upcoming season. Tight ends Hayden Hurst, Will Dissly, and Tucker Fisk are currently sidelined.\nIn response to the situation, the Chargers have signed tight end Isaac Rex and waived defensive lineman Michael Mason. Hurst and Dissly, both experienced blocking tight ends, are expected to play significant roles in the team's offense, which aims to be more physical this season.\nHurst has been a valuable receiving option, while Dissly brings a strong blocking presence. Both players were brought in to enhance the Chargers' offensive strategy under new offensive coordinator Greg Roman.\nFisk, who joined the team on August 14, previously played for the Atlanta Falcons after going undrafted in 2022. Dissly, signed in March, has a three-year, $14 million contract and spent his first six seasons with the Seattle Seahawks. Hurst also signed with the Chargers in March on a one-year minimum contract, marking his fifth team in seven seasons.\nRelated: Chargers News: Joey Bosa returns to practice, raises hope for rejuvenated Bolts' season\nAs the Chargers prepare for the season, the absence of these key players in practice could impact their game plan. The team is focused on building a physical identity, and the contributions of Hurst and Dissly will be crucial in achieving that goal.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

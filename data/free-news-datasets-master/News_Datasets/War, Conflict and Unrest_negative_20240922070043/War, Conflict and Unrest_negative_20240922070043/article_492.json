    "text": "According to a Reuters exclusive report , disagreements over Israel’s future military presence in Gaza are hindering progress on a ceasefire and hostage deal.\nThe report, based on information from ten sources including Hamas officials and Western diplomats, reveals that disagreements over Israel’s future military deployment in Gaza and Palestinian prisoner releases are the main obstacles.\nThe sources say Hamas is particularly concerned about Israel’s demand to keep troops deployed along the Netzarim Corridor, which divides northern and southern Gaza, and the Philadelphi Corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border. These demands were reportedly introduced after Hamas had accepted a version of the ceasefire proposal presented by President Joe Biden in May.\nHamas Expresses Frustration Over ‘Last Minute’ Demand One source close to the talks stated, “Hamas sees Israel as having changed its conditions and parameters ‘last-minute,’ and worries any concessions it makes would be met by more demands.” The Israeli Prime Minister’s office, however, denies making new demands, asserting that their position builds on the previous proposal.\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently concluded a trip to the region, urging Hamas to accept a new U.S. proposal aimed at narrowing differences between the parties. Blinken emphasized, “Once that happens we also have to complete the detailed implementation agreements that go along with putting the ceasefire into effect.”\nRelated Story: US Continues to Back Israel Despite Global Calls for Gaza Ceasefire\nThe next round of talks is expected to take place in Cairo in the coming days, focusing on the U.S. bridging proposal. Key negotiators, including CIA director Bill Burns and Mossad chief David Barnea, are expected to attend.\nAs negotiations continue, control over the Philadelphi Corridor remains a sensitive issue, particularly for Egypt. Egyptian security sources say that while Egypt is prepared to enhance security measures in the area, it rejects the presence of Israeli troops there.\nRead more at Reuters.",

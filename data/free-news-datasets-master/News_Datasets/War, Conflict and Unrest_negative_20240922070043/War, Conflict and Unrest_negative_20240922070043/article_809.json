    "text": "Israel’s land invasion of Rafah, which was awaited with fear for months, began by taking over the Philadelphia corridor on the Egyptian border. Israeli tanks entered the Rafah border gate on the corridor at the beginning of May, violating the historic agreement signed in 1979.\nEgypt, which has repeatedly warned Tel Aviv not to attack Rafah, which is located in the southernmost part of the Gaza Strip, changed its opinion about staying on the corridor, she sent troops to the border and announced that she would intervene in a genocide case at the International Court of Justice.\nWhile the death of an Egyptian soldier in the conflict that began in the Philadelphia corridor in May increased tension, Israel who is currently living is not considering withdrawing from the border.\nFollowing US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken’s Middle East tour, which included Tel Aviv, Cairo and Doha, Israeli state television KAN reported that Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to withdraw from the Philadelphia Corridor .\nOn the other hand, Netanyahu denied the news on Wednesday night and said that there was no such agreement at the meeting with Blinken, where they discussed the ceasefire and exchange talks. hospitality.\nThe Philadelphia Corridor between the Gaza Strip and Egypt is a buffer zone 14 kilometers long and several hundred meters wide.\nWith Israel occupying the corridor, the Gaza Strip’s communications with the outside world were effectively cut off.\nIn the current picture, it seems that the removal of Israeli occupation troops from the corridor is one of the most important nodes in the negotiations. Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip as well as Egypt, wants Israeli troops to leave the corridor.\nThe passage was also on the agenda during the phone conversation between US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the early hours of Thursday.\nUS officials speaking to The Washington Post said Netanyahu had offered concessions to Biden, but a diplomatic source speaking anonymously to Israeli media today argued that Tel Aviv did not change to stand\nThe Qatar newspaper Al Arabi Al Jadid wrote about another offer brought to the table by Secretary of State Blinken, who met with the Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah Sisi in Cairo during the week.\nAccording to the newspaper, Blinkenn asked Sisi to join the international peacekeeping force that will be in the Philadelphia corridor.\nThe US proposal includes giving Israel leadership positions in the task force that will be deployed along the 14-kilometer line.\nThere is still no word from Cairo regarding that news and offer.\nIsrael, which constantly adds new conditions to the indefinite ceasefire talks, refuses to withdraw from the Netzarim Corridor, which divides the Gaza Strip in two as well as the Philadelphia Corridor. The Netzarim Corridor was created by Israeli occupation forces during the war to separate northern and southern Gaza.\n2024-08-22 19:42:00\n#BREAKING #NEWS #ISRAEL #terrible #passage #offer #revealed #Sisi",

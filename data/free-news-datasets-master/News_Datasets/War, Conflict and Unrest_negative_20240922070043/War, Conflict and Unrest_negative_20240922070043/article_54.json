    "text": "EMC commander “Ivan Mordisco” declared war on dissident guerrilla units that decided to negotiate peace with the government without his approval.\nIn a statement, the EMC’s Amazonas Bloc, which is commanded by Mordisco, announced the “start of military confrontations” with the “factionalists” within the guerrilla federation.\nIn a statement, Mordisco’s group accused the dissidents of “attacking the peace talks table” by “proclaiming themselves” EMC delegates in negotiations with the government of President Gustavo Petro.\nThe declaration of war could have major consequences in southern Colombia where the Amazonas Bloc and the Jorge Suarez Briceño Bloc of dissident commander “Calarca” operate.\nThe units in the area have been ordered to enter into combat with any force that is in the way of retaking the area.\nAmazonas Bloc The announcement of Mordisco’s group comes days after the Ombudsman’s Office warned for another guerrilla turf war in southwest Colombia.\nIn the region south and east of Cali, the Yair Bermudez Front split from the EMC and has threatened to expel the EMC’s Dagoberto Ramos Front (FDR) from the north of the Cauca province since March.\nAccording to the EMC dissidents, the FDR has been terrorizing locals in the areas under their control.\nVery soon we will be in these territories, not generating violence but defending life.\nYair Bermudez Front Petro suspended peace talks with Mordisco because of an FDR attack on an indigenous community in Cauca.",

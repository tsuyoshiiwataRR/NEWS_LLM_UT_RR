    "text": "Middle East\nRussia accuses Ukraine of sinking ferry at port in Krasnodar region\nRussian authorities say 17 people at the port were rescued, but fate of 2 others is being clarified\nMOSCOW\nRussia accused Ukraine of sinking a ferry loaded with fuel tanks Thursday in the Russian port of Kavkaz in the southern Krasnodar region\nRegional authorities said in a statement that the ferry, carrying 30 fuel tanks, came under attack and was damaged so badly that it could not remain afloat and sank, while spilt fuel ignited and caused a major fire.\nAt least 19 people were at the ferry when the incident happened. Seventeen of them were rescued, but the fate of the other two is being clarified, the statement added.\nBooms were installed at the scene to prevent the spread of fuel.\nMore than 100 firefighters and 34 pieces of special equipment have been involved in extinguishing the blaze, it said.\nThe authorities prohibited people from publishing photos and videos and spreading information on social networks related to the work of air defense systems.\nUkraine has yet to comment on Russia's claims. Independent verification is challenging due to the ongoing war.\nAnadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

    "text": "Disagreements over Israel's future military presence in Gaza and over Palestinian prisoner releases are obstructing a ceasefire and hostage deal, according to ten sources familiar with the round of US-mediated talks that concluded last week. The sources, who include two Hamas officials and three Western diplomats, told Reuters the disagreements stemmed from demands Israel has introduced since Hamas accepted a version of a ceasefire proposal unveiled by US President Joe Biden in May. All the sources said Hamas was especially concerned about the latest demand to keep troops deployed along Netzarim Corridor, an east-west strip that prevents free public movement between north and south Gaza, as well as in a narrow border strip between Gaza and Egypt known as Philadelphi Corridor. Israel's current grip on the Philadelphi Corridor gives it control of Gaza's frontier with Egypt, the enclave's only crossing that does not border Israel. Hamas sees Israel as having changed its conditions and parameters \"last-minute\". Hamas was also worried that any concessions it made would be met by more demands, one of the sources told Reuters. The media office for the Palestinian group did not respond to the requests for comment for this story. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's office also did not comment on the talks.

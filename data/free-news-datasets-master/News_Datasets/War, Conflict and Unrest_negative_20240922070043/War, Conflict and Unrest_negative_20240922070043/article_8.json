    "text": "At 22:07, Ukraine initiates an attack on the Kursk base 19:43 Swiss Peace Summit's Initial Post-Meeting HappensAfter the peace summit in Switzerland in June, the first post-meeting took place as reported by Ukraine. Attendees included representatives from over 40 nations and organizations who participated in a virtual session. Additional meetings for working groups are to be held in the future, it has been suggested. 19:08 Habeck Expresses Hope for More Employment Opportunities for Ukrainian Refugees in GermanyGermany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck expresses optimism that more Ukrainian refugees in the country will find employment. Although obstacles such as family-related issues, health concerns, wartime trauma, and childcare responsibilities may hinder work, Habeck believes it's beneficial for everyone involved - the individuals, their integration, and the social system - for them to seek employment. Habeck criticizes the controversial stance of Brandenburg's Minister President and SPD politician Dietmar Woidke regarding the allowance for Ukrainian refugees, attributing it to rough election campaigns in eastern Germany that have not been thoroughly thought out. 18:28 Ukrainian Armed Forces Declare Counteroffensive in Kharkiv Region: Advance of Nearly Two KilometersUkrainian forces announce a push in the Kharkiv region, with troops advancing nearly two kilometers into the frontline area, according to the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade of the Ukrainian ground forces. The main objective of this operation was to weaken the offensive potential of the 20th Army of the Russian Federation, a goal reportedly achieved. This cannot, however, be independently verified. The brigade also reports that the Russian side suffered heavy losses of 300 soldiers in the past four days and significant destruction or damage to equipment and weapons. The scale of the reported counterattack remains unclear. 18:00 Alleged Interference with Russian TV Broadcast by Ukrainian IntelligenceUkrainian intelligence (HUR) is claimed to have successfully disrupted several Russian TV channels broadcasts and replaced them with a video about the war in Ukraine. A source from the Ukrainian intelligence told the \"Kyiv Post\" newspaper and RBC Ukraine news agency that \"HUR has 'hacked' Russian television and shown the reality of the war [to the population].\" The controversial video was shown three times during prime time last evening, affecting channels such as Pervouralsk, Evraziya 360, and Pervyj Kanal TV. As a result, nine channels had to temporarily halt their programming, it is reported. 19:16 Reduction in Russian Ground Troops in Kaliningrad as Perceived by Lithuanian CommanderThe Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, located between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic Sea, has reportedly seen a decrease in the number of ground troops stationed there. Commander of the Lithuanian Armed Forces, Raimundas Vaikšnoras, suggests that this decrease is due to the Ukrainian offensive in the Russian region of Kursk. When the conflict against Ukraine began, a significant amount of equipment and personnel were relocated from Kaliningrad, the commander stated. While soldiers have returned after rotation, a reduction among the ground troops is now being observed. 18:40 Controversial Comment from Lukashenko Sparks Protests in ArmeniaBelarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko's controversial remarks about Armenia have resulted in protests. Demonstrators in Yerevan, Armenia's capital, threw eggs at the Belarusian embassy and demanded the ambassador's removal, as reported by Ukrainian media. In an interview on Russian state television, Lukashenko criticized Armenia's pro-Western stance, saying, \"Who needs Armenians? No one. Let them develop their economy and rely on their own resources. What is France? Who is Macron? Tomorrow, when Macron is gone, everyone will forget the Armenians.\" Tensions between Armenia and its long-term ally, Russia, have escalated since Azerbaijan gained control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region in September, ending almost three decades of Armenian separatist rule. 18:03 Two Deaths Reported in Sumy Region After Glide Bomb AttackA glide bomb attack utilizing two Russian bombs in the Sumy region bordering the Russian region of Kursk has resulted in two fatalities, as reported by the Ukrainian prosecutor's office. The Russian bombs targeted infrastructure components. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had recently visited Sumy and stated that there had been a decrease in attacks on the region since the capture of portions of Kursk. 17:28 Ukrainian Attack Allegedly Sets Fuel Tanker Ablaze in Russian Port of KavkazAccording to local authorities, a ship carrying fuel tanks is on fire in the Russian port of Kavkaz, located in the Krasnodar region east of Crimea. This follows an alleged Ukrainian attack, and several Russian media outlets have published images and videos of the incident. The Ukrainian military shares such content on social media, touting the message \"Neptune visits the port of Kavkaz\" on their Telegram channel. Unverified claims from Russian Telegram channels suggest that the ship was hit by a Ukrainian Neptune-type anti-ship missile; however, this weapon's stated range is 300 kilometers, and the front line is further away. Moscow relies on the port to supply its forces in its conflict against Ukraine. Update at 18:39: As per the crisis center of the Krasnodar region, the vessel has reportedly sunk due to the fire. There were said to be 30 fuel tanks on board. Read more here. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has declared that his troops have seized another village in the eastern region of Pokrovsk, Ukraine, placing them approximately 10 kilometers from a key logistics city. Previously, Zelenskyy had announced his intention to reinforce troops in the Pokrovsk area. In the Russian region of Kursk, Ukrainian forces have reportedly captured another village and apprehended more Russian prisoners. Allegedly, they now control 94 villages and over a thousand square kilometers of land, though this information is yet to be confirmed by independent sources. 16:12 Ukraine denies attempted nuclear plant attack; Russia could stage \"nuclear provocation\" Ukraine's administration has refuted claims by Russian President Vladimir Putin that Ukrainian troops had attempted an attack on the Kursk nuclear power plant the previous night, labeling it \"a complete falsehood.\" Andrii Kovalenko, chief of the department for countering disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, suspects that Russia may itself be planning a \"nuclear provocation,\" stating that the \"threat of a nuclear provocation by Russia is real given Putin's involvement.\" 15:46 EU gas storage at 90% capacity Gas storage facilities within the European Union have reached 90% capacity early, as per the EU Commission. The commission declared the EU to be \"prepared for the upcoming winter,\" as the 27 EU members agreed that gas storage facilities should be filled to 90% capacity by November 1, two months prior to schedule. However, gas storage levels differ among countries, with Spain holding a full 100% capacity, while Latvia maintains approximately 69%. The EU aims to cut its dependence on Russian natural gas and increase imports from the US and Norway. 15:21 Putin accuses Ukraine of attempting to attack Russian nuclear plant Russian President Vladimir Putin has implicated Ukraine in attempting to assault the Kursk nuclear power plant, stating, \"The adversary attempted to attack the nuclear plant last night,\" without providing any proof. He also reported that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had been notified. Prior to this, the IAEA had expressed concerns about the dangers of combat near the plant and urged \"all parties to exercise the utmost caution.\" 14:50 IAEA Chief Announces Visit to Nuclear Power Plant in Kursk Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has announced that he will be visiting the Kursk nuclear power plant in Russia next week. An IAEA representative confirmed the visit, which is scheduled for the coming week. The Ukrainian army launched a rapid and large-scale offensive in the western Russian region of Kursk in early August, prompting the Russian state nuclear energy company Rosatom to caution of a potential threat to the NPP, located approximately 100 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. 14:21 Russia: 115,000 People Evacuated from Threatened Regions Around 115,000 people have been evacuated from at-risk Russian regions adjacent to Ukraine, as per Russia's Deputy Prime Minister, Denis Manturow. Accumulated damage to agriculture and industry in affected areas is being assessed, according to Manturow, during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other senior administrative officials. \"I have called this gathering to discuss the current developments in Russia's border regions,\" Putin said to initiate the meeting. 14:00 Tusk: India Could Mediate in Ukraine War Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk supports India's potential mediatory role in the Ukraine conflict. \"I am delighted that the Prime Minister has reaffirmed his willingness to engage personally for a peaceful, fair, and swift resolution of the conflict,\" Tusk asserted following talks with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi. Modi's proposed mediation efforts are significant given his planned visit to Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. India maintains neutrality in relation to the Russian invasion and refrains from supporting Western sanctions against Moscow. Read more here. 13:40 \"Currently Doesn't Look Like a 'Limited' Kursk Incursion\" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz presumes that the Ukrainian progress in Russia will be \"a spatially and temporally confined movement.\" However, there is currently no evidence to suggest this, according to ntv correspondent Nadja Kriewald. On the contrary, she reports. 13:20 Several Russian Military Aircraft Destroyed in Attacks on Sawaslejka Ukrainian attacks on the Sawaslejka airbase allegedly resulted in the destruction of several Russian aircraft, as per reports by Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne, citing intelligence sources. In an attack on August 16, a MiG-31K supersonic interceptor and two Il-76 strategic airlifters are said to have been destroyed, while about five MiG-31K/I aircraft were reportedly damaged. A fuel and lubricant depot was also struck in an August 13 attack, adding to the damage to several more MiG-31K/I aircraft. 13:06 Russian Security Agency Probes CNN JournalistsThe Russian internal security agency FSB has initiated criminal investigations against foreign journalists, specifically a CNN reporter and two Ukrainian female journalists, in the Russian region of Kursk. The investigations are due to their reportage in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Sudscha, where they were allegedly caught crossing the state border illegally. They filmed video footage in the area, leading to these accusations. The FSB has announced plans to issue international arrest warrants. If found guilty, the journalists face imprisonment for up to five years in Russia. Notably, American journalist Evan Gershkovich was recently released from a labor camp after being sentenced to 16 years for alleged espionage. More details here. 12:34 Zelensky Visits Border Region, Refills \"Exchange Fund\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the border region of Sumy in northeastern Ukraine. Ukrainian troops had advanced into Russia more than two weeks prior to this visit. He reported that another location in the Kursk region had been captured, replenishing the \"exchange fund.\" The term refers to the capturing of Russian soldiers, which could be exchanged for Ukrainian soldiers currently held in Russian captivity. Zelensky emphasized that the attacks on Sumy and the number of civilian deaths had decreased since the Kursk offensive. He shared a video with the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian troops, Olexander Syrskyj, who updated him on the troop reinforcements in the east of Ukraine, where Russia continues to advance. 12:06 Potential Spying Activity? Drone Sightings in BrunsbüttelReports suggest the presence of Russian drones over Schleswig-Holstein's industrial park. Multiple sightings of drones have been recorded, including flights near the decommissioned nuclear power plant and the LNG terminal in Brunsbüttel, which is in violation of the flight ban zone. The public prosecutor's office in Flensburg is investigating for suspected espionage purposes with an intent to sabotage. Law enforcement agencies within the region have reportedly detected a suspicious object, presumed to be a military drone. The \"Bild\" newspaper also alleges that the drones are linked to Russian agents, who may have launched them from civilian ships in the North Sea. More information here. 11:40 US Embassy in Kyiv Warns of Air AssaultsThe U.S. Embassy in Kyiv issued a warning of heightened danger due to potential air attacks in the coming days, leading up to Ukraine's Independence Day on August 24. This announcement comes in light of Russia's threat to attack Ukraine with drones and missiles, as reported by the embassy's website. The anniversary of Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union holds significant importance for Ukrainians since the onset of the war two and a half years ago. Recently, Ukrainian soldiers unexpectedly entered Russian territory in the border region of Kursk. Russian President Vladimir Putin labeled this action as a provocation and threatened appropriate retaliation. 11:13 Military Base in Volgograd Catches FireThere was a fire at a military camp in Marinovka, in the southern Russian region of Volgograd. Residents reported hearing explosions. Russian authorities claim that the fire was caused by a Ukrainian drone strike, and no casualties were reported. 10:41 Russia Constructs Pre-built Bunkers in KurskThe Russian border region of Kursk is building concrete shelters for civilians. Regional governor Alexei Smirnov announced that prefabricated bunkers would be installed at busy locations such as bus stops, sharing a photo of a truck delivering a bunker block. Bunkers are being constructed at two other locations, including Kursk, where the Kursk NPP nuclear power plant is located. Russia suspects Ukraine of planning to attack the facility, which Ukraine denies. 10:10 Ukraine Presents Advance into Kursk RegionUkraine reported over 40 attacks from Russian troops near Pokrovsk, with most of them being repelled. Zelensky promised reinforcement of troops in the area. Meanwhile, the advance in the Kursk region is continuing. 09:42 Russia Says Downed Drones in Multiple LocationsRussian authorities claim that Ukrainian attacks were intercepted in the western part of the country. In the Volgograd region, most of the drones were allegedly destroyed near Marinovka (previously mentioned at 07:30). In the Kursk border region, two Ukrainian missiles and a drone were reportedly downed by Russian air defense. In the Rostov region further south, five drone attacks are said to have been repelled. Drones were also reportedly shot down in the Russian regions of Voronezh and Bryansk. 09:09 Long-range weapon usage against Russian targets: Kyiv seeks approval from the USThe Ukrainian Minister of Defense, Rustem Umerov, holds discussions in Kyiv with a bipartisan delegation from the US House of Representatives. As per the information from Kyiv's ministry, Republican representative Rob Wittman and Democratic representative David Trone discuss with Umerov the situation on the front and United States' stance on using long-range weapons against Russian targets. \"I emphasized the importance of obtaining immediate consent from our allies to fully utilize long-range weapons against Russian targets\", Umerov stated. \"It's about safeguarding our tranquil cities and villages.\" 08:36 Star Wars actor initiates fundraisingUS actor Mark Hamill, renowned for his role as Luke Skywalker in \"Star Wars\", is raising funds for mine-clearing robots for Ukraine. In collaboration with Eastern Europe expert Timothy Snyder, they plan to collect $441,000 through the \"Safe Terrain\" campaign. These robots are capable of clearing mines even in hard-to-reach locations, maintaining a safe distance from the operators. \"One of the most deplorable acts committed by Russia in Ukraine is the scattering of millions of mines\", Snyder stated. \"I've visited unoccupied areas near the front where individuals put themselves at risk to aid others in returning to their farms and homes. Owing to these robots, mines can be eliminated, and lives saved.\" Ukraine is extensively contaminated with mines, and their removal could stretch over several decades. 08:01 Kremlin seems to be preparing Russians for a 'new reality'The Ukrainian assault on Kursk poses challenges for Moscow's propaganda. According to a Kremlin-linked interlocutor speaking to the independent Russian portal Meduza, based in Riga, \"But even the penetration into Russian territory and the seizure of control over villages is a new and deeply unpleasant event.\" In an attempt to quell the mounting anxiety, the Kremlin is trying to prepare Russians for life in a \"new reality\" and a \"new normality\". The message is: \"The enemy has indeed entered Russian territory, it will be defeated - but the return of the territory will take time, and Russians must be patient.\" In the meantime, the residents are encouraged to \"convert the negativity and shock into a positive direction\" - namely by contributing aid supplies to the Kursk region. All officials interviewed by Meduza agree that the fighting in the Kursk region could continue for several months. A government-linked interlocutor specifies that this estimate is \"quite optimistic - if everything goes well.\" 07:30 Russian governor confirms a blaze in a military facilityRussian authorities confirm reports of a military facility in the southern region of Volgograd being set ablaze following a Ukrainian drone attack. Regional governor Andrei Bocharov reports via Telegram that the drone crashed into the facility. No casualties were reported. Bocharov fails to specify which military facility was targeted. He indicates, however, that the village of Marinovka was attacked, where Russia maintains an airbase. 06:56 Former Security Advisor: Putin Had a Hypnotic Influence on TrumpAccording to former US Security Advisor and General Herbert Raymond McMaster, Russian President Vladimir Putin successfully manipulated former US President Donald Trump. This is detailed in McMaster's book \"At War With Ourselves: My Tour of Duty in the Trump White House\", as reported by \"The Guardian.\" \"Putin, a ruthless former KGB man, used Trump's ego and insecurities to flatter him\", McMaster describes. Putin called Trump \"an extraordinary person, talented, beyond any doubt,\" thereby exerting a near-hypnotic influence on him. McMaster, who served as Trump's security advisor for about a year, had warned Trump about Putin at the time: \"Mr. President, he is the best liar in the world.\" He suggested that Putin was confident he could \"play\" with Trump and achieve a relaxation of sanctions and a cheap withdrawal of the US from Syria and Afghanistan. 06:20 Reports of a fire on a Russian Airbase in VolgogradExplosions were reported in the Russian city of Kalach on the Don in the Volgograd region during the night, according to several Russian Telegram channels. They are believed to be the result of a drone attack. A fire erupted on a nearby airbase. The Volgograd region is approximately 900 kilometers southeast of Moscow. It is speculated that the Marinovka airbase in the village of Oktyabrsky, some 20 kilometers from Kalach on the Don, was the target. Witnesses in the area reported hearing six to ten loud explosions, accompanied by the characteristic sounds of drones, as reported on Telegram. 04:27 Ukrainian Military on Drone Attacks in RussiaThe Ukrainian military intelligence, HUR, has spoken about the objectives of the drone strikes occurring in Russia throughout the night. These strikes were aimed at Moscow airport Ostafyevo, the Millerovo airbase in Rostov region, and a radio communications center. HUR head Kyrylo Budanov shared this information on military site \"The War Zone.\" Around 50 drones were reportedly involved. The level of damage is currently being assessed. Russian authorities reported in the morning that they had taken down 45 drones within Russian territory. 03:09 Elections in Russia: Body Armor and Helmets for Election Helpers in KurskIn the heated electoral region of Kursk, Russia, election helpers will be equipped with bulletproof vests and helmets by the government ahead of early regional elections. Furthermore, additional polling stations will be set up in different parts of the nation for voters who have left the region, as per the regional election commission head, Tatjana Malachowa. The region is currently under a state of emergency. Elections for governors and regional parliaments are scheduled across numerous Russian regions from September 6 to 8. The central election commission of Russia approved early voting for citizens in border areas, including Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk. 01:34 Fico Pressured in Western Democracies' Policy ViewsThe Slovakian Prime Minister, Robert Fico, mentions the feeling of being pressure in his foreign policy views by Western democracies. Deviants in these matters face arbitrary pressure and threats of isolation by Western democracies, as stated by Fico on the occasion of the Moscow invasion anniversary. He likens this pressure to the violent suppression of the \"Prague Spring\" in 1968 by Warsaw Pact troops. Fico is against EU aid for Ukraine and has faced criticism for being pro-Russian. 00:12 Ukraine Reports 46 Russian Attacks Near PokrovskUkraine reports 46 Russian assaults adjacent to the city of Pokrovsk in the eastern part of the country over the day.

The enemy was targeted by fire, the message adds. The situation is now under control, as per Bogomaz. 22:15 Zelensky Hopes for Promised Billion-Dollar AidUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky anticipates the rapid disbursement of the promised billion-dollar aid by the West, from the revenues derived from the frozen Russian state assets. While many political affirmations have been made by Kiev's allies, more action is expected by Zelensky, who pointed out that Ukraine requires a practical mechanism. Ukraine relies on the revenues from Russia's frozen assets to counter Russian aggression. Discussions concerning the allocation of these funds have been ongoing for a long time, and urgent decisions are needed, according to Zelensky. The G7 countries agreed on a new financial aid plan for Kyiv during their summit in June. A generous loan of $50 billion is proposed, to be secured by interest earnings from frozen Russian assets. 21:52 Putin Praises Closer Trade Ties with ChinaRussian President Vladimir Putin commends the progress in collaboration with China. \"Our trade relations are expanding successfully (...). The attention both governments dedicate to trade and economic relations is bearing fruit,\" Putin states at a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in the Kremlin. China and Russia have \"large-scale joint plans and projects in the economic and humanitarian spheres,\" Putin adds. Li says, according to the Kremlin, that Chinese-Russian relations are at their peak level.

For Russia, China serves as a major trading partner as a result of Western sanctions. 21:20 Bulgakov's Appeal Rejected: Former Russian Deputy Defense Minister to Remain in DetentionFormer Russian Deputy Defense Minister Dmitri Bulgakov will remain in detention following the dismissal of his request for release under strict house arrest and his appeal against incarceration. According to Russian news agency TASS, a Moscow court also ordered the detention of two alleged accomplices of Bulgakov. Their firm allegedly received nine contracts from Bulgakov between 2022 and 2024, resulting in damage estimated at around 50 million rubles (approximately 500,000 euros). 9:00 PM Ukraine Strengthens Forces in Pokrovsk AreaAs per Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement, Ukraine is strengthening its military presence in the contended Pokrovsk region situated towards the east of the country. Zelenskyy shared in a televised broadcast that they are well-aware of the Russian forces' strategies in the area. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian forces are also progressing in the Russian area of Kursk, according to Zelenskyy's update. He fails to disclose additional information. 8:21 PM Eviction Threat for Numerous Ukrainians in Hungarian Shelters Post DecreeFollowing the execution of a Hungarian decree that withdraws general protection for Ukrainian refugees, numerous Ukrainians in Hungary are at risk of losing their shelters. Migration Aid, an organization, has reported that private refugee shelters have already started evicting Ukrainians. In Kocs, north of Budapest, approximately 120 refugees, predominantly Roma women and children hailing from the western Ukrainian region of Transcarpathia with a significant Hungarian minority, are required to vacate a guest house under police supervision. Review other recent events*here** The European Union's role in supporting Ukrainian refugees is being discussed, as Germany's Economy Minister, Robert Habeck, expresses hope for more employment opportunities for them. He believes that it would benefit both the individuals, their integration, and the social system if they seek employment. The European Union is also working to fill its gas storage facilities, as reported by the EU Commission. They have reached 90% capacity early and aim to reduce their dependence on Russian natural gas by increasing imports from the US and Norway.",

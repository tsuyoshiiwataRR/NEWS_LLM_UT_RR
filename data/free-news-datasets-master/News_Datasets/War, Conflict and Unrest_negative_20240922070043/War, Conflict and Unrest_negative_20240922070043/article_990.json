    "text": "The military rulers of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have written to the United Nations Security Council to denounce what they said was Ukraine's support for rebel groups in West Africa's Sahel region, according to Mali's foreign ministry.\nIn a joint letter, the three countries denounced the \"open and assumed support of the Republic of Ukraine for terrorism internationally, particularly in the Sahel\".\nThe countries asked the UN to \"take responsibility\" for Ukraine's actions and to prevent \"subversive acts\" that threaten regional and continental stability.\nThe letter was dated 19 August and circulated to the 15-member Security Council the following day, diplomats told Reuters news agency.\nThe text was also posted on the Malian foreign ministry's social media account.\nThe complaint marks a new stage in the deterioration of relations between these countries and Ukraine, according to experts.\nAccusations\nThe row arose over comments by a spokesperson for Ukraine's military intelligence agency about fighting in northern Mali that killed dozens of Malian soldiers and mercenaries from the Russian Wagner group in late July.\nBoth ethnic Tuareg separatists and jihadist insurgents operate in the region.\nSpeaking to Ukrainian media, spokesperson Andriy Yusov said rebels had received \"all the necessary information they needed\" to conduct \"a successful military operation against Russian perpetrators of war crimes\".\nMali interpreted the remarks as an admission of Ukraine's direct involvement in the conflict, accusing the country of supporting terrorist groups.\nMali's military government consequently cut diplomatic ties with Ukraine in early August, followed days later by Niger.\nAlong with Burkina Faso, the neighbours are allied by a mutual defence pact signed last year.\nRussian presence\nUkraine said it regretted the \"short-sighted and hasty\" decision by Mali and Niger to sever ties.\nThe Ukrainian government has since repeatedly called the allegations groundless, while an alliance of Tuareg rebels denied receiving its support.\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\nTop Headlines West Africa Arms and Armies Submit By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy .\nSuccess!

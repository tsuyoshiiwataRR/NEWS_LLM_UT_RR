    "text": "Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) went off on former President Donald Trump during her speech at the Democratic National Convention, and drew laughs with a brutal reference to couches.\nThe Democratic National Convention ( DNC ) entered its final hours Thursday night, with anticipation high for Vice President Kamala Harris — and maybe another surprise guest.\nWarren took the stage to a thunderous and extended ovation that moved her to tears .\nBut then, Warren got to work tearing chunks out of Trump and praising VP Harris — and threw in an unsubtle reference to sectional healing :\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN: Donald Trump, the felon, has no plans to lower costs for families. He doesn’t know how. And basically, he doesn’t really care. When did he ever fill up a gas tank or worry about a grocery bill? The only bills he worries about are from his criminal defense lawyers.\nBut Kamala, she cares deep down, and she will take on the giant corporations that are squeezing American families. In fact, it’s something she’s done before, during the California wildfires.\nShe went after the price gouging during the pandemic. We worked together in the Senate to stop price gouging.\nAnd as president, she will lower costs for your family. She’ll take on the Wall Street firms that buy up millions of houses and apartments, and then jack up the rent.\nShe’ll take on drug companies that charge an arm and a leg for prescriptions.\nShe’ll take on corporate monopolies that rip off consumers and billionaires who don’t pay taxes.\nAnd she’ll take on right wing extremists who think they should decide who has access to abortion or IVF. Kamala will protect abortion rights nationwide.\nAnd there it is. Groceries. Gas. Housing. Health care. Taxes. Abortion. Trust Donald Trump and JD Vance to look out for your family? Shoot, I wouldn’t let those guys–. I wouldn’t trust them to move my couch!\nCROWD: (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN: We need Kamala Harris!\nThis election is about your family and your future. I’ve seen Kamala Harris fight. I’ve seen her win. And when it comes to our families and our futures Kamala Harris is someone we can trust.\nSo here it is with joy in our hearts. Let’s elect Kamala Harris, the next president of the United States!\nWatch above via C-SPAN .\nHave a tip for us? tips@mediaite.com",

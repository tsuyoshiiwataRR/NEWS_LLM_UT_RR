The grim finding confirms the fears that most of them had been murdered by Hamas terrorists during their 10-month-long captivity in Gaza.\n“The Israeli army confirmed on Thursday that signs of gunfire were found on the bodies of the six hostages who were recovered on Tuesday from Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip,” the Israeli newspaper\nHaaretz reported.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Monday night extracted the bodies of six hostages from the southern Gaza town of Khan Yunis. The recovery operation in Hamas-infested territory was conducted after the terrorist group\nrepeatedly rejected President Joe Biden’s latest ceasefire proposal, demanding more security concessions from Israel.\n𝐁𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭: 𝐁𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐛𝐨𝐝𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐡𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐜𝐮𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐤.\nIt is believed that the terrorists guarding the hostages killed them while in captivity, fearing a rescue operation during an IDF…\n[pic.twitter.com/yqbLjPE2X9]\n— Israel ישראל (@Israel)\n[August 22, 2024]\nThe bodies of hostages brought back to Israel were identified as those of Yagev Buchshtav, 35, Alex Dancyg, 75, Chaim Peri, 79, Yoram Metzger, 80, Nadav Popplewell, 51, and Avraham Munder, 78.\nThe mother of hostage Yagev Buchshtab, shared that her son was shot dead in captivity.\nHamas is executing hostages.\n[pic.twitter.com/zhoi0GWQgx]\n— Aviva Klompas (@AvivaKlompas)\n[August 22, 2024]\nThe\nJerusalem Post reported:\nSigns of bullets and gunshot wounds were found on the bodies of hostages recovered from the Gaza Strip earlier this week, the IDF confirmed on Thursday.\nPreliminary findings were received from Israel’s National Institute of Forensic Medicine, which performed autopsies and examined the bodies of the six hostages, the military stated.\nAccording to the IDF report, marks indicating bullets and wounds were found on the bodies of the six hostages. Additionally, four bodies found next to the hostages in the Gaza Strip were assumed to be terrorists, and when examined, no signs of gunshots were observed. (…)\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum commented on the development, stating, “The presence of bullets in the bodies of the late hostages … is further proof of the cruelty of the terrorists who held the 109 hostages for already 321 days.”\nThe recovery of the bodies lowers the number of hostages still\nbelieved to be in Hamas captivity to 105.\nNetanyahu resists Biden demand Israel leave crucial Gaza-Egyptian border area used to supply Hamas\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is resisting the pressure from President Joe Biden to give up on key security demands in a bid to reach a ceasefire with the terror group Hamas in Gaza.\nPresident Joe Biden called Prime Minister Netanyahu on Wednesday to press him on the ceasefire deal. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris was also on the line with Biden. “Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, also joined the call, according to the White House,”\nThe Times of Israel noted.\nThe main sticking points in the negotiations include Israel’s control over the strategic Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border and continued IDF presence in the enclave to check the movement of Hamas terror fighters. The 9-mile-long Philadelphi Corridor is a major route for smuggling weapons and moving terrorists in and out of the Hamas-held Gaya.\nReuters reported Wednesday:\nU.S. President Joe Biden, in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, stressed the urgent need to conclude a Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal and pointed to upcoming Cairo talks as crucial, the White House said.

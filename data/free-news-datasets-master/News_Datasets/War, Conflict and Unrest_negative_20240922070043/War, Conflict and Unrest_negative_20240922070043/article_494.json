    "text": "Congress storm in offing; will blow away BJP: Kharge [GK NEWS SERVICE](https://m.greaterkashmir.com/author/gk-news-service/145) Jammu, Aug 22: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge Thursday maintained that Congress storm was in offing and it would blow away Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its leadership. He was addressing the convention of party workers and leaders here in Jammu. Bete-noire of his party and its leadership, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was his main target and major portion of his address focussed on criticising his (PM’s) functioning and even his persona. “It’s our party and its leadership, Soniaji, who thought about the Food Safety Act to provide free food to the poor. Congress brought MGNREGA, free education. We brought rail up to Banihal but Modi was taking credit for it. He would not have seen a university yet would claim that he opened universities across the country,” Kharge stated.. “You taught him a good lesson in 2024, he has lost his majority. But see, he is still arrogant – repeating that he has retained power for the third time. Our Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had crossed the 400 mark but never became arrogant. They are arrogant and believe in ‘Jumlabaazi.’ Home Minister (Amit) Shah, during his election campaign here in J&K, had promised to give statehood at the earliest. Did you get it? They did not keep their promise,” Congress president alleged. He criticised BJP leadership besides the (Lieutenant) Governor and to further sharpen his verbal assault, he invoked former J&K Governor S P Malik. “They will be blown away by a Congress storm or say tremors. This happens in quakes or tremors, everything gets lost. It will happen soon. There will be a Congress storm and they will not be visible,” Kharge said. While seeking support of people in assembly elections, he complained – ‘had you given Congress 20-25 seats more, our Rahulji would have been the Prime Minister.’ While referring to lateral entry advertisements and Waqf Bill, he alleged that BJP was harassing all - poor and SCs, and snatching their rights. “Waqf Board bill too was given to the JPC after we robustly opposed it. You have to fight for your rights, with dignity,” he exhorted Jammuites, while describing them as warriors. He asserted that only those working hard would be rewarded in the party. “If assembly elections are won, Modi’s aura will be shrunken further. He will have to bow down and you will get statehood,” Kharge added.",

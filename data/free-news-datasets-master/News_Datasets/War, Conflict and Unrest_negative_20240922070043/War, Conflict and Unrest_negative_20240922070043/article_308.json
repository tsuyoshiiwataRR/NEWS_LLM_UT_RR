    "text": "Claira Posted 11 minutes ago #1 Share Posted 11 minutes ago Following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's political wing is reportedly considering targeting Israelis abroad, according to a report by N12. Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader, was killed on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, where he was attending the inauguration of Iran's new president. Conflicting reports suggest that he was killed by a short-range projectile, however the Jerusalem Post independently confirmed that he was killed by a remotely detonated explosive device. His death marked a significant escalation in the Israel-Hamas conflict, with Iran and Hamas blaming Israel for the attack. The report indicated that it is still unclear whether Hamas will focus on tourists or high-ranking Israeli officials. Until now, this strategy has been primarily employed by Iranian and Hezbollah operatives, not by Hamas. https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-815960 Link to comment Share on other sites More sharing options...",

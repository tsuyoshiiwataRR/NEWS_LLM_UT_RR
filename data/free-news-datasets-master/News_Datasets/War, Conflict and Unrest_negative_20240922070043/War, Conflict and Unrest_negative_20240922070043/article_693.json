    "text": "Refugees in Gaza (doc: Aljazeera) A family, including six children, was killed in the central Gaza Strip, in the latest wave of deadly Israeli attacks on the Palestinian territory, Sunday (18/8) local time.\nThe Gaza Health Ministry reported at least 25 Palestinians were killed in the past 24 hours.\nThe parents and their six children were killed in Deir el-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said. The children’s grandfather said their mother worked for the United Nations.\n“My daughter, along with her husband and six children, were sleeping soundly in their house in Deir al-Balah. They were shocked, an Israeli missile landed on the roof of the house. They were all killed,” Mohammed Awad Khattab told Al Jazeera.\n“My daughter has been struggling to have a child for years. What wrong did those innocent children do? Did they endanger Israel? Did they carry weapons?” she asked.\nAl Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reported that four of the dead children were twins and they had been lined up together for burial in a cemetery in the city.\n“We have seen a very heartbreaking scene this morning with dozens of bodies lined up in the morgue outside Al-Aqsa Hospital. There has been a tremendous surge in Israeli attacks in Deir el-Balah, where Palestinians have been asked to seek shelter,” Abu Azzoum added.\nIsrael’s 10-month offensive has so far killed more than 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza.(M-3)\n#Family #Killed #Including #Children #Israeli #Attack",

    "text": "Photo: Strike on the port of Kavkaz (Russian media) Today, a strike hit the Russian port of Kavkaz in Kuban. As a result, a ferry carrying fuel sank in the port, with 15 crew members on board, SHOT reports. According to a Russian Telegram channel, so far only four crew members of the sunken ferry in the port of Kavkaz, who ended up overboard, have been rescued. In total, there were 15 people on board. The Governor of Krasnodar Krai, Veniamin Kondratyev, stated that the Russians are currently attempting to rescue the other crew members. Strike on Russian port Earlier today, Russian public channels began reporting that smoke was visible over the port of Kavkaz. Soon after, it was confirmed that a strike had hit the port of Kavkaz in Kuban. Initially, Russian authorities claimed that a fuel ferry had been attacked. However, just a few hours later, Russian media, citing local authorities, reported that the fuel ferry had sunk. Notably, this is not the first strike on this port. For instance, at the end of May, Ukraine&#039;s Defense Forces attacked an oil terminal in the vicinity of the port of Kavkaz. At that time, the strike damaged the ferry crossing and the port&#039;s oil terminal. Moreover, there was another attack on the port in July. Recently, drones attacked a ferry vessel in the port of Kavkaz. The General Staff of Ukraine noted that the Russians had been using this ferry for transporting, among other things, railway wagons.",

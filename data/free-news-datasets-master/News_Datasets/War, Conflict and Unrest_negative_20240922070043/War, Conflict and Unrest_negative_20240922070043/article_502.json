    "text": "Darfur\nRSF shell civilians in Omdurman, El Fasher, denounce bloody army airstrikes\nAugust 22, 2024 (EL FASHER/OMDURMAN) – Heavy artillery shelling by Sudan’s Rapid on Thursday killed and wounded civilians in El Fasher, capital of North Darfur, and Omdurman, the twin city of the capital Khartoum.\nThe RSF further accused the army of conducting 27 airstrikes over the past week that killed more than 280 civilians, a claim Sudan Tribune could not independently verify. Also, the army could not immediately be reached for comment.\nA medical source told Sudan Tribune that at least two people were killed and about 15 others were injured in RSF shelling that targeted residential areas in Omdurman. The shelling also hit villages in the northern countryside of Omdurman.\nIn El Fasher, the RSF intensified its shelling, targeting residential neighbourhoods, the airport and an army base. The state capital has been under siege by the RSF since April 2024 and has seen heavy fighting in recent months.\nRSF spokesperson Al-Fatih Qarshi said in a statement that the army’s airstrikes had caused widespread damage to civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and markets. He said the strikes continued even as peace talks were underway in Geneva.\nThe army has not yet commented on the RSF’s claims.\nThe conflict in Sudan has caused a major humanitarian crisis, with millions of people in need of food, water and medical care. Aid agencies have struggled to reach many areas of the country due to the fighting.",

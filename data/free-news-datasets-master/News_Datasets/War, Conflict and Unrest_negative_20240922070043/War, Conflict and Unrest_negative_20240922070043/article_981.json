    "text": "The upcoming NATO air exercise, Ramstein Flag 24, scheduled to be hosted for the first time in Greece, is facing significant hurdles due to a dispute with Turkey over Athens' flight information region (FIR) jurisdiction. Ramstein Flag 24, NATO’s largest air exercise, is expected to involve over 140 aircraft, personnel, and support from 14 member countries. The plan includes the participation of Turkish F-16 fighters, which would need to operate within the Athens FIR. However, Turkey has a long-standing policy of not submitting flight plans to Greek authorities, as it contests part of Athens' FIR jurisdiction. This creates a significant obstacle for the exercise, as flight plan submission, inspection, and approval are essential for safe and coordinated operations. Despite the exercise being just weeks away, with the first arrivals of personnel and aircraft expected soon, the issue remains unresolved. This is not the first time such a dispute has affected a NATO exercise in Greece. In 2022, Greece withdrew Turkey’s invitation to the NATO Tiger Meet exercise due to Turkey's aggressive actions in the Aegean. The ongoing disagreement highlights the complex geopolitical tensions in the region and the challenges faced by NATO in conducting joint operations in such a sensitive environment.

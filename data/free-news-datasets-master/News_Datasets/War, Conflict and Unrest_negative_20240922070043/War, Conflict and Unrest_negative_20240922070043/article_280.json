    "text": "Three police encounters resulted in the death of two suspected criminals implicated in cases of murder and robbery, while a constable was martyred. Four suspected bandits were apprehended, including a woman and an injured man. The police seized weapons and motorcycles after the shootouts. The bodies were transported to hospitals for legal formalities. The funeral prayers of martyred Constable Abid were offered in the Police Lines. Eagle Squad personnel Abid and Bilal were patrolling the Dhandra Gurdwara Road in hikriwala when they signalled two suspicious men on a motorcycle to stop. However, one of the suspects opened fire on the police personnel, injuring Constable Abid in the neck and chest. The police retaliated, injuring one of the attacker. Constable Abid was rushed to the Allied Hospital by SHO Arslan Bari and another official in a private vehicle, but he succumbed to his injuries. His funeral prayers were offered after post-mortem and he was laid to rest in his native village. In another encounter in Razabad, Noman, a resident of Ghulam Muhammadabad, was struck by a bullet. ASI Khalid Amir rushed him to the Ghulam Muhammadabad General Hospital, but he succumbed to his injuries en route. Police sources said Noman was involved in a murder three days ago in the Ali Garden area, where he had shot and killed Rana Anas Gulfam over resistance while snatching a motorcycle from his brother Asad. Meanwhile, six armed robbers barged into the homes of Abdul Hafeez and Bilal in the Roshanwala area and fled after robbing them. The police apprehended four suspects, including the woman, while one man was injured. COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

    "text": "Bangladesh: A Precipitous Descent [Sharif Hussain Khan](https://m.greaterkashmir.com/author/sharifhussainkhan/765) The specter of instability once again looms large over Bangladesh. A nation that, under Sheikh Hasina, seemed to chart a steady course, now finds itself at a perilous crossroads. The echoes of the 2009 Bangladesh Rifles mutiny, a stark reminder of the fragility of power, reverberate through the current upheaval. Hasinaâ€™s ascent in 2009 was meteoric. Backed by a surging tide of popular support, particularly among women and youth, she navigated a political landscape marred by military intervention. The BDR mutiny, a brazen challenge to her authority, was quelled, but the seeds of discontent were sown. Fifteen years on, the aura of invincibility that once surrounded her dissipated. The democratic spaces that once flourished have constricted. The economy, once a beacon of hope, now casts a long shadow of despair, especially among the disillusioned youth. The recent student protests, met with a heavy fist, were a stark indictment of a regime losing touch with its people. The army, under General Waker-uz-Zaman, finds itself in a complex predicament. Unlike the 2007 coup, when the military was the bulwark against chaos, it is now perceived as a reluctant midwife to a new political order. The appointment of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as interim leader is a departure from the usual playbook of military regimes, signaling a recognition of public sentiment. Yet, the army's role remains fraught with challenges. The specter of violence, once again, haunts the nation. The resurgence of extremist elements, coupled with the deep-seated political divisions, threatens to plunge Bangladesh into a vortex of strife. The desecration of national symbols underscore the gravity of the situation. India, a steadfast partner, faces a delicate balancing act. While its development initiatives have endeared it to the Bangladeshi people, it must tread carefully to avoid being caught in the crossfire. The parallels between Bangladesh and Myanmar are striking. Both nations, after periods of relative stability, are now grappling with the consequences of authoritarian rule. The international community, including India, must remain vigilant and support the aspirations of the Bangladeshi people for a democratic, inclusive, and prosperous future. The path ahead is fraught with uncertainty, but the stakes could not be higher. Sharif Hussain Khan, Delhi Based Author & Researcher",

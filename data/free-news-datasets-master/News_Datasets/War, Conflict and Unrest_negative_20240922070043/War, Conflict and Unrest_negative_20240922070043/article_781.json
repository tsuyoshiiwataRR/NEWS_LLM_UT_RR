    "text": "As speakers at the Democratic National Convention call out Donald Trump for his dangerous Project 2025 agenda that threatens our national security, here are the facts:\nTrump’s Project 2025 agenda would put our national security at risk and leave our allies out to dry.\nCenter for American Progress : “Project 2025 Will Undermine America’s National Security”\n“[Project 2025] includes a vision for the ‘common defense’ that will place the United States in direct confrontation with its adversaries and privilege unilateral militarism over a thoughtful, holistic, and adequately resourced national security strategy. In so doing, Project 2025’s proposals would fundamentally undermine America’s national and economic security, and ordinary Americans will pay the price.\n“Project 2025 would politicize the military chain of command and U.S. intelligence agencies.”\nCBS News : “The Department of Homeland Security, established in 2002, should be dismantled and its agencies either combined with others, or moved under the purview of other departments altogether, the policy book states.”\nWired : “Project 2025, a widely circulated playbook from the influential right-leaning Heritage Foundation, takes aim at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on several fronts, especially its efforts to reduce dangerous online misinformation. If former president Donald Trump wins the election and appoints officials who follow the playbook’s recommendations for CISA, the five-year-old agency could face an unprecedented crisis.\n“The document ‘appears blind to the fact that Russia, China, and Iran are weaponizing social media networks to create a false narrative that weakens US national security,’ [Mark Montgomery, senior director of the Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies] says.”\nREMINDER: Project 2025 is Trump and Vance’s 900+ page anti-freedom agenda crafted by the Heritage Foundation and Trump’s far-right extremist allies – it’s “undeniably a Trump-driven operation,” and Vance has praised it as containing “good ideas.”\nAxios : “This is undeniably a Trump-driven operation. The biggest tell: Johnny McEntee — one of Trump’s closest White House aides, and his most fervent internal loyalty enforcer — is a senior adviser to Project 2025. One of the most powerful architects is Stephen Miller, a top West Wing adviser for the Trump administration.”\nCNN : “Trump claims not to know who is behind Project 2025. A CNN review found at least 140 people who worked for him are involved”\nPolitico : “Many of the authors of the blueprint are former Trump officials, and the Heritage Foundation has spent the past year-plus recruiting people to implement the plans within the administration , Scott said.”\nThe Week : “Many of Trump’s indicated plans for a second term fall in line with the Project 2025 outline.”\nNew York Times : “[Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts] told me that he views Heritage’s role today as ‘institutionalizing Trumpism.’ … The lesson of Trump’s first year in office, Roberts told me, is that ‘the Trump administration … simply got a slow start. And Heritage and our allies in Project 2025 believe that must never be repeated.’”\nWashington Post : “Trump took a private flight with Project 2025 leader in 2022”\n“‘They’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do,’ Trump said.”\nVance : “I’ve reviewed a lot of [Project 2025]. There are some good ideas in there.”\nAxios : “J.D. Vance wrote foreword of upcoming book from Project 2025 architect”\nThe New Republic : “Project 2025 Leader Is Overjoyed by Trump’s Vice Presidential Pick”\nNick Corasaniti, New York Times : “[Roberts] reacted to the news [of Vance’s VP selection] ‘with a broad smile on my face’ and said that ‘privately, we were really rooting for him.’”\nVox : “Kevin Roberts, the president of the right-wing Heritage Foundation and the driving force behind Project 2025, told Ward that ‘ [Vance] is absolutely going to be one of the leaders — if not the leader — of our movement.’”\nPolitico : “Vought told POLITICO Magazine that he is in ‘regular contact’ with Vance’s Hill office and that ‘we probably have one of the closest relationships with [Vance’s] office that we do with any Hill office.’”\nAmericans are learning more and more about the Trump-Vance ticket’s extreme and unpopular Project 2025 agenda – and rejecting this dangerous and out-of-touch MAGA blueprint.\nNavigator Research : “Project 2025 Has Become Significantly More Unfavorable Since Trump Attempted to Distance Himself From the Plan”\n“Project 2025 has seen a significant increase in both awareness and unfavorability since our last survey in June. 54 percent of Americans report being familiar with Project 2025 … Among those familiar with the Project 2025, just 11 percent view it favorably, while 43 percent view it unfavorably.\n“When people are asked what negative news they have heard recently concerning Donald Trump, mentions of Project 2025 have dramatically increased. … A plurality of Americans believe Project 2025 accurately represents what Trump stands for.”\nNavigator Research : “Americans oppose all the key elements in Project 2025, with the greatest concerns around health care, worker’s rights, and dismantling federal programs. Over four in five Americans oppose an array of policies proposed in Project 2025 such as ‘allowing employers to stop paying hourly workers overtime’ … Additionally, four in five oppose ‘allowing the government to monitor people’s pregnancies to potentially prosecute them if they miscarry.’\n“Americans’ overall opposition to Project 2025 increases after reading about its specific policy goals.\n“Three in five Americans say Project 2025 would benefit the wealthiest Americans, CEOs, and corporations.”\nMiami Herald : “As Americans learn more about Project 2025, they become more opposed, poll finds”",

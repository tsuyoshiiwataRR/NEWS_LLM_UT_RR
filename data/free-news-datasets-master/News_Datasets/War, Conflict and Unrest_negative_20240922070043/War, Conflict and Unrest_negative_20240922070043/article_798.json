    "text": "Gunmen in Nigeria killed at least 10 farmers on Wednesday in an attack on a village in the northern Niger state, residents said.\nArmed gangs, known locally as bandits, have frequently raided communities in northwest Nigeria, kidnapping residents, farmers , students and motorists for ransom.\nResidents told Reuters on Thursday that the gunmen had attacked some farmers in Allawa community of Shiroro local government area in Niger late the previous day.\n“The farmers were trapped and 10 killed yesterday evening in their respective farms,” said Hassan Abubakar.\nAnother resident, Indamishe Auwal, who helped remove the corpses, lamented the incident and the general insecurity in the area.\n“Shiroro is bleeding. Our people are suffering and bandits have taken over our farmlands,” Auwal said.\nNiger state police spokesperson Wasiu Abiodun didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.",

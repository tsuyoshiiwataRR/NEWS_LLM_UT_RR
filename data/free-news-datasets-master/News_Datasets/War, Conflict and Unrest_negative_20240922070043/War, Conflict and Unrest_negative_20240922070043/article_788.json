    "text": "During a phone call he received from his American counterpart, Anthony Blinken, yesterday, Wednesday, Safadi stressed “the necessity of stopping all illegal Israeli measures in the West Bank and Israeli violations of the historical and legal status quo in Islamic and Christian holy sites in occupied Jerusalem.”\nHe warned of “the danger of these measures that kill all chances of achieving peace.”\nHe added that Jordan is “preparing the necessary legal files to take action in international courts against the attacks on holy sites, which constitute a clear violation of international law and a dangerous escalation that Jordan will confront by all possible means.”\nDuring the phone call, the two ministers discussed “the serious deterioration in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and its holy sites, and the need to take effective practical steps to stop it.”\nThey also discussed “the latest developments in the efforts being made by the United States, Egypt and Qatar to reach a prisoner exchange deal that would lead to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.”\nDuring the phone call, they discussed “the dangerous escalation witnessed in the region and the steps required to stop it.”\nSafadi stressed “support for the efforts made to reach a prisoner exchange deal,” emphasizing that “stopping the Israeli aggression on Gaza is the priority and the first step that must be achieved towards reducing the escalation that threatens security and peace in the region.”\nThe two sides also discussed cooperation in delivering aid “adequately and immediately to Gaza to confront the humanitarian disaster in the Strip.”\nFor his part, Blinken referred to “his country’s position on the necessity of respecting the historical status quo in the holy sites.”\nIsrael, with American support, has continued its war on the Gaza Strip for more than 10 months, despite the adoption by the UN Security Council of two resolutions calling for an immediate halt to it, and the orders of the International Court of Justice to take measures to prevent acts of genocide and improve the dire humanitarian situation in the Strip.\nThe Israeli army continues its raids, arrests and destruction of Palestinian property in the West Bank, coinciding with its aggression on Gaza.\nSource: “The Kingdom”\n#Safadi #Blinken #Jordan #measures #stop #Israeli #attacks #holy #sites\n2024-08-23 03:19:36",

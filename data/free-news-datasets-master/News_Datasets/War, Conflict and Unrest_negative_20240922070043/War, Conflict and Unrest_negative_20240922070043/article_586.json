    "text": "Anticipating violence during Nabanna march, Bengal tells SC KOLKATA: Bengal government submitted before the Supreme Court on Thursday that it is anticipating violent protests during a Nabanna (state secretariat) march scheduled for August 27, involving acid bombs, guns, and planned attacks against police, reports Dwaipayan Ghosh. The state highlighted a &quot;volatile and surcharged environment&quot; being misused by some people spreading false information on social media. The SC clarified that it had not restricted the state from exercising its lawful powers, but emphasised: &quot;Peaceful protests should not be disturbed and the state shall not take any precipitate action against those who are peacefully protesting.&quot; Bengal standing counsel Sanjay Basu said: &quot;The state is at liberty to initiate action against those not protesting peacefully or creating unrest. No statements politically or otherwise to be made, which would impact the volatile environment in the state.&quot; For more news like this visit TOI.

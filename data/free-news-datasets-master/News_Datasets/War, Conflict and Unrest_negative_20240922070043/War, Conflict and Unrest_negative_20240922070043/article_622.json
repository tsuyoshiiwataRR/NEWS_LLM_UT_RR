    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS â€” A man was arrested Thursday for his alleged role in a deadly shooting on Indianapolis' northeast side in late December.\nOn Dec. 28, IMPD officers responded to an apartment complex in the\n3400 block of Alsuda Court, just northeast of Binford Boulevard and East 46th Street, shortly before 3 a.m. for a report of a person shot.\nPolice found a man outside an apartment building who was pronounced dead at the scene.\nThe Marion County Coroner's Office identified the victim as 31-year-old Joshua Hopson.\nAn IMPD spokesperson said shortly after that, preliminary information led police to believe the victim was involved in a disturbance before he was shot. The suspect was not at the scene when officers arrived.\nOn Thursday, Jan. 5, IMPD officers with the Violent Crimes Unit located and arrested Emmanuel Newman for his alleged role in the shooting.\nThe Marion County Prosecutor's Office will review the case and make final charging decisions.\nAnyone with information on the incident is asked to contact Detective Kyle Hoover at the IMPD Homicide Office at 317-327-3475 or Kyle.Hoover@indy.gov. Tips can also be submitted anonymously to Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana at 317-262-8477.",

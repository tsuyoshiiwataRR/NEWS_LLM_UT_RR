    "text": "An international children's rights organization has called for an arms embargo on Israel, citing the regime’s massacre of women and children in Gaza. The call by Save the Children UK came on Thursday after a recent Israeli airstrike killed nearly a dozen women and children, including a group of ten-year-old quadruplets, and their mother. “We’re absolutely heartbroken to see that six children – including a group of ten-year-old quadruplets, and their mother – are the latest victims of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza,” Save The Children UK said on X. “We simply cannot accept the violence that Palestinian children continue to face as normal.” We're absolutely heartbroken to see that six children - including a group of ten-year-old quadruplets, and their mother are the latest victims of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.— Save the Children UK (@savechildrenuk) We simply cannot accept the violence that Palestinian children continue to face as normal. [https://t.co/f9h9tercHh] [August 22, 2024] The rights organization urged the British government to immediately stop selling arms to the Tel Aviv regime. It said there is a clear risk that weapons sold to Israel might be used to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law. The new development came after a group of international rights organizations launched legal action to stop UK arms sales to Israel over the regime’s war crimes in Gaza. The UK has continued arms supplies to Israel despite the ongoing genocide in Gaza, issuing more than 100 arms export licenses since last October. Israel has hit more than 500 Gaza schools in the past 10 months, according to an Al Jazeera report as schools in the Gaza Strip have been used to shelter nearly two million displaced Palestinians. Within 10 days in August, the regime's military forces struck five schools in Gaza City, killing more than 179 people and injuring scores more. Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, schools are considered civilian objects and should be protected from attacks. The Israeli regime has killed more than 40,223 and wounded 92,981 Palestinians since the regime launched its campaign of death and destruction in Gaza on October 7, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

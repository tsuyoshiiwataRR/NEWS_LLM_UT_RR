    "text": "Shafaqna India: Israeli forces have intensified their operations in the central and southern Gaza Strip, clashing with Hamas fighters. On Thursday, Palestinian health officials reported that Israeli strikes had killed at least 27 people across Gaza. The escalation follows a recent push by US President Joe Biden, who urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prioritize a truce and the release of prisoners. Concurrently, US and Israeli teams began new discussions in Cairo on Thursday to negotiate a ceasefire deal. Despite months of intermittent talks, both Israel and Hamas remain entrenched in their positions. In Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza, a strike on a house resulted in the deaths of 11 people, including children and women, some of whom were reportedly burned. Another strike in Al-Maghazi camp in the central Gaza Strip killed six, including a local journalist. Additional strikes in the south resulted in five more deaths. Later in the day, an airstrike near Khan Younis killed five Palestinians and injured several others. The Israeli military reported that its forces have increased their activity in Deir Al-Balah and Khan Younis, demolishing numerous structures and claiming to have killed 50 fighters in Rafah over the past 24 hours. Hamas’s armed wing responded by ambushing an Israeli force in Rafah, resulting in casualties on both sides. In Deir Al-Balah, tanks have advanced from the east, blocking roads and forcing residents to flee their homes, with some finding temporary shelter on roads or beaches. The situation is further complicated by ongoing negotiations in Cairo, where US and Israeli delegations are working on a truce proposal. Discussions are focusing on border security arrangements, with Egyptian and Qatari officials expected to join the talks. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s recent visit to the region did not yield a breakthrough, and negotiations continue to face significant obstacles, particularly regarding Israeli troop deployment in Gaza and along the Egypt-Gaza border.",

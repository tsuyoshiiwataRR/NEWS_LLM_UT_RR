    "text": "[Renan Ferreira](https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5641/renan-ferreira) warns [Francis Ngannou](https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3362/francis-ngannou) that his return to mixed martial arts could end up badly for him if he’s not fully committed and focused on the sport, dividing his attention between MMA and a potential return to boxing in the future. The former UFC heavyweight champion shocked the world in his boxing debut against [Tyson Fury](https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/6477/tyson-fury) in late 2023, putting on an impressive performance in a split decision loss to “The Gypsy King,” but then lost via second-round knockout to [Anthony Joshua](https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/6465/anthony-joshua) this past March. Ferreira brutalized [Ryan Bader](https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/39/ryan-bader) in just 21 seconds in a champion vs. champion clash between PFL and Bellator stars earlier this year to win the ticket to welcome Ngannou to PFL, and they will face off Oct. 19 in Saudi Arabia. “Francis is going through a rough year, but [the task] is even tougher ahead of him,” Ferreira said at Thursday’s PFL press conference in Washington. “He knows he has a big problem ahead of him that will be very hard to solve.” Ferreira said he’s followed Ngannou’s career for a long time and has been preparing to face someone like him “my whole life.” The Brazilian talent will enter the cage riding a four-fight knockout streak. Ngannou hasn’t competed in MMA since his final UFC appearance in January 2022, when he defended his UFC title against [Ciryl Gane](https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5037/ciryl-gane). “It’s a long time away from the cages, and it’s completely different [from boxing],” Ferreira said. “Francis has done boxing matches and it’s a whole different game so I think he will feel the difference, but he’s a warrior. It’s going to be difficult for him on the feet, and in the grappling area, because he knows I can either knock him out or submit him at any moment. “Many things can happen, but I know Francis is a big champion and is definitely taking this next fight seriously. If his head is not 100 percent on this fight, he has a big problem ahead of him.” Ferreira said he never doubted that he would be the one to welcome Ngannou to the PFL cage, and used the extra time to enjoy some time with his family and sharpen his tools. With [Jon Jones](https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/47/jon-jones) and [Tom Aspinall](https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5355/tom-aspinall) holds heavyweight belts currently in the UFC, and Ferreira ending 2023 as the division king in PFL, the Brazilian feels that his clash with “The Predator” defines who’s the No. 1 heavyweight in the world today. “This is the most anticipated fight of the year, two great heavyweights with similar styles, who move forward for the knockout,” Ferreira said. “So this is definitely going to be a great fight and will definitely define who’s the world’s best heavyweight.” Get the latest gear [](https://fanatics.93n6tx.net/c/482924/586570/9663?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2Fboxing%2Fmike-tyson%2Fmike-tyson-fanatics-authentic-autographed-red-everlast-boxing-glove%2Fo-47%2Bt-23347562%2Bp-454259416257%2Bz-9-933971910%3F_ref%3Dp-SRP%3Am-GRID%3Ai-r0c0%3Apo-0)",

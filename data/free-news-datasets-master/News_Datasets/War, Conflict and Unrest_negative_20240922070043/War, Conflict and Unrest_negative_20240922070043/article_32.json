    "text": "5 hours ago User-posted content In 1856, the Kansas Territory was caught in a violent struggle between anti-slavery Free Staters and pro-slavery Border Ruffians. In May, U.S. Marshal I.B. Donaldson led a small army against the Free State stronghold at Lawrence, Kansas, intending to arrest Free Staters accused of treason. After carrying out the arrests, Douglas County Sheriff Samuel J. Jones, who was pro-slavery, took command of the army and raided the town, destroying buildings and terrorizing the inhabitants. The “Sack of Lawrence” left the town in shambles and heightened tensions in the war along the Kansas-Missouri border, and led John Brown to seek retribution .\nThe Tragic Prelude by John Steuart Curry depicts John Brown and the violence of the border war. Photo by Wikimedia The Kansas-Nebraska Act In the mid-1850s, Americans living in the territory that included present-day Kansas and Nebraska looked to organize new States to join the Union.\nAt the time, slavery was banned in the region by the Missouri Compromise (1820). Because of this, Slave States opposed the organization of new territories that could potentially become Free States. They were worried the addition of Free States would upset the balance of power in Congress and lead to the abolition of slavery.\nDespite their objections, Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854 . Two territories were established, west of Missouri, and divided at the 40th parallel:\nNebraska to the north. Kansas to the south. It also stipulated that the section of the Missouri Compromise prohibiting slavery in the Louisiana Purchase north of the southern border of Missouri was “inoperative and void.” It allowed the people living in the new territories to decide for themselves if they would allow slavery — a concept known as “ Popular Sovereignty .”\nIllinois Senator Stephen Douglas submitted the Kansas-Nebraska Act to Congress. Photo by Wikimedia The Eve of the Civil War in the Kansas-Missouri Border Because of its proximity to two Slave States — Missouri and Texas — Abolitionists and Anti-Abolitionists rushed to determine the fate of slavery in Kansas.\nThe Abolitionists were known as “Free Staters” because they wanted Kansas to be a Free State.\nAs settlers moved into the territory, land disputes, personal feuds, politics, and their stance on slavery fueled violence. It also affected the establishment of towns:\nLawrence, Kansas was founded by two groups of New Englanders. The Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Society , an Abolitionist organization, sponsored these groups. Leavenworth and Atchison were founded by pro-slavery settlers. Most of these settlers were from Missouri. Militia factions also formed. The pro-slavery militia was referred to as the “ Border Ruffians ,” while the Free Staters were called “ Jayhawkers .”\nTrade sign used at the Boston headquarters of the New England Emigrant Aid Company. Photo by Wikimedia The Wakarusa War In November 1855, the Wakarusa War started when the tension between the two factions led to murder. Franklin R. Coleman, a Border Ruffian, killed Charles R. Dow, a Free Stater. Coleman insisted he killed Dow in self-defense, but Free Staters believed it was motivated by Dow’s stance on slavery.\nA mob burned Coleman’s house to the ground, and Sheriff Samuel J. Jones tried to arrest Jacob Branson, a Free Stater, for the crime. A mob of Free Staters gathered and forced Jones to release Branson, who was taken to Lawrence to keep him safe.\nJones followed the Free Staters to Lawrence and sent a message to Governor Wilson Shannon , informing him that a group of armed men had taken his prisoner.\nShannon called up the militia and hundreds of men responded. However, most of them were Border Ruffians, who were eager to attack the Free Staters in Lawrence. Jones and the Border Ruffians gathered on the Wakarusa River, just outside Lawrence, and laid siege to the town.\nFree Staters took measures to defend themselves. They built defensive works in Lawrence and raided the Federal Arsenal at Liberty, Missouri, seizing weapons and ammunition.\nOn December 6, Thomas Barber, a Free Stater, was killed after he ventured outside of Lawrence.\nWakarusa War Photo by Legends of America Meanwhile, Governor Shannon intervened and mediated a truce between the Border Ruffians and Free Staters. Although the Border Ruffians disbanded, Governor Shannon and the Free Staters feared they would return. Shannon gave the leaders of the Free Staters — James H. Lane and Charles Robinson — permission to organize their Jayhawkers into a legal militia.\nJohn Brown Arrives in Kansas Toward the end of the Wakarusa War, John Brown arrived in Kansas and was given command of a Jayhawk militia company. Brown was a vocal opponent of the peace treaty that ended the conflict.\nAccording to historian Richard Cordley : “John Brown was one of the unique characters which the Kansas struggle drew out. He was a man by himself. Very few of the free-state men agreed with him in his policy or action. Many of them were in constant fear that he would precipitate a conflict by some rash deed. He came to Kansas because he hated slavery, and his hatred of it was as a fire to his bones.”\nJohn Brown Photo by Library of Congress Growth of Lawrence Despite the Wakarusa War, the town of Lawrence experienced tremendous growth in 1855. While many settlers built shacks and log cabins to live in, some were able to build framed houses and some were built from stone and a new building material called “concrete.”\nThe largest structure in Lawrence, the Free State Hotel , was started by the Emigrant Aid Company and cost $20,000. During the Wakarusa War, Free State leaders used it as a shelter, even though it was still under construction.\nThe threat of violence from the Border Ruffians forced the people of Lawrence to think about defending themselves at all times. A pastor wrote, “All the public buildings are turned into barracks, the preaching hall with the rest, and nothing is thought of but the best means of defense.”\nWhile the Jayhawkers focused on dealing with the Border Ruffians, many new settlers simply wanted to move on with their lives. However, they were all joined together over the common cause of ensuring Kansas would be a Free State.\nLawrence Suffers Through the Harsh Winter of 1855–1856 The winter of 1855-1856 was harsh. It kept Border Ruffians from harassing the Free Staters in and around Lawrence, but the Free Staters also suffered from severe cold. Captain Samuel Walker, a Free Stater, wrote:\n“I failed to complete my log house before the winter of 1855-56 set in…Our cabin had no floor, but we were as well off in this particular as most of our neighbors. Chinks and fissures abounded in roof and gable...Seven of us made up the family, five children mostly small. At times when the winds were bleakest we actually went to bed as the only escape from freezing. More than once we woke in the morning to find six inches of snow in the cabin. To get up and make one’s toilet under such circumstances was not a very comfortable performance….”\nThe Slavery Faction Puts Its Scheme in Motion Meanwhile, the Border Ruffians and pro-slavery leaders were preparing to push the Free Staters out of Kansas. However, they needed to do this without attracting the attention of the Federal Government.\nAt the time, the Kansas government was controlled by the pro-slavery faction. However, Border Ruffians played a part in manipulating the election. The Kansas legislature was called the “ Bogus Legislature ” and the Free Staters responded by forming a government, even though it had no authority.\nThe scheme started in the spring of 1856 when pro-slavery leaders accused the leaders of the Free State government of treason.\nSheriff Jones Returns to Lawrence In April 1856, Sheriff Jones returned to Lawrence, with warrants to arrest the Free-Staters who had taken part in freeing Jacob Branson.\nJones arrived on the 18th but was unsuccessful. The next day, he tried to arrest Samuel F. Tappan. However, Tappan resisted, hit Jones, and escaped.\nGovernor Shannon responded by giving Jones 10 soldiers and an officer for a posse, so he could carry out his duties.\nOn April 23, Jones and his posse returned to Lawrence. Upon arrival, he arrested people whom he accused of refusing to help him on the 18th and 19th.\nJones stayed in Lawrence overnight and was in a tent when someone shot him in the back. At first, rumors flew throughout Kansas that Jones had been “mortally wounded” and “foully murdered.”\nThe Bogus Legislature used this to its advantage. It worked with a pro-slavery judge, Samuel D. Lecompte , to file charges of treason against prominent Free Staters — including James H. Lane and Charles Robinson . A Grand Jury — which met in secret — responded quickly and indicted them on the charges. However, one of the people on the jury warned the Free Staters.\nCharles L. Robinson Photo by Wikimedia The Free State Hotel is Completed By this time, the construction of the Free State Hotel in Lawrence was completed. This was important to the Free Staters because it gave new immigrants arriving in Lawrence a place to stay.\nAccording to historian Richard Cordley, the pro-slavery faction and Border Ruffians believed “To destroy this hotel was to remove a powerful attraction. All these disturbances had largely the same motive. They would keep the country in such a state of confusion and terror that settlers would be kept away.”\nMarshal Donaldson’s Proclamation On May 11, I .B. Donaldson, the U.S. Marshal for the Kansas Territory , issued a proclamation that called on “law abiding citizens” to assemble to help carry out the arrest warrants for Free Staters. According to Cordley, this meant: “The United States court had issued the order, and a United States marshal was to execute it. The people of Lawrence must tamely submit, or resist United States authority.”\nFree Staters quickly assembled and appealed to Governor Shannon for help. However, he denied them, saying he did not have the authority to interfere with the duties of Marshal Donaldson or Sheriff Jones.\nMeanwhile, Border Ruffians responded to Donaldson’s call to help enforce the law. They formed camps near Donaldson’s headquarters, at Lecompton, Kansas. Among the Border Ruffians who joined Donaldson were the Douglas County Militia, the Kickapoo Rangers, and the Missouri Platte County Rifles (see First Sack of Lawrence ).\nLawrence Prepares for the Attack On May 13, the people of Lawrence responded with resolutions that said:” …we are ready to resist, if need be, to the death, the ravages of an invading mob.”\nHowever, leaders disagreed on how to prepare for any attack. Some argued they had not broken any laws and they did not need to defend themselves. Others argued it was during a critical time for planting crops and people could not be asked to leave their farms.\nOn May 14, the town leaders sent a letter to Marshal Donaldson and asked him to clarify the charges against the Free Staters. They insisted they wanted to remain peaceful, but were aware the “...men collected about Lawrence openly declare that their intention is to destroy the town and drive off the citizens.”\nMarshal Donaldson responded that they were in violation of the territorial laws and had tried to assassinate Sheriff Jones. Donaldson questioned why they had armed themselves and said, “...those who seek to resist the laws of the land, and turn traitors to their country, will find me aiding in enforcing the laws, if not as an officer, as a citizen.”\nThe people of Lawrence appealed to Governor Shannon. They wanted him to ask the Federal government to send U.S. Army troops to serve in Donaldson’s army, instead of the Border Ruffians. Once again, Shannon refused to intervene.\nBy this time, violence had already started. The Border Ruffians were patrolling the roads, looking for Free Staters. They killed a man who left the safety of Lawrence and harassed farms in the area.\nThe Sacking of Lawrence On May 21, Marshal Donaldson, Sheriff Jones, and the Border Ruffians arrived outside of Lawrence. They assembled on Mount Oread, overlooking the town, and pointed artillery at the town. The people of Lawrence decided not to resist the authority of the United States Government.\nAround 11:00, the Deputy Marshal rode into town and arrested G.W. Smith, Gains Jenkins, and G.W. Deitzler, all of whom had been indicted on charges of treason.\nThe Free Staters invited Marshal Donaldson and his men to dinner at the Free State Hotel. The invitation was accepted. Afterward, Donaldson returned to his camp. He told Sheriff Jones and the Border Ruffians he was satisfied and dismissed them.\nOutraged, Sheriff Jones asked the Border Ruffians to remain and serve as a posse on his behalf. This effectively transformed the small army from a Federal force to a territorial one, but the people in Lawrence did not know this.\nJones rode into town and demanded the townspeople give up their weapons. He threatened to use the artillery to bombard the town if they refused. The town leaders agreed to his demands.\nAs soon as Jones had everything in his possession, he told the people living in the Free State Hotel to leave, because he intended to destroy it. After he failed to do so with the artillery, he had his men burn it to the ground. As the walls collapsed, Jones said, “This is the happiest moment of my life.”\nFree State Hotel Historical Marker Photo by Historical Marker Database The Border Ruffians continued to terrorize the town. They burned the offices of two Abolitionist newspapers. They vandalized homes, ransacked them, and burned the homes of Free State leaders.\nAt one point, the Border Ruffians raised a flag that said, “Southern Rights” on one side and “South Carolina” on the other.\nAftermath of the Sack of Lawrence The Lawrence Committee of Safety sent an account of the attack to Washington, D.C. The town was devastated by what the Abolitionist press in the North called the “Sack of Lawrence.”\nRumors flew that Free Staters had been killed by the Border Ruffians, which was not true. However, the fact that a U.S. Marshal had organized the small army — and allowed Sheriff Jones to take control of it — significantly heightened the tensions in the Border War.\nFour days later, John Brown had his revenge in one of the most brutal massacres to take place in American history — the Pottawatomie Massacre .\nCorrections If you see a grammatical or factual error in this article let us know in the comments.

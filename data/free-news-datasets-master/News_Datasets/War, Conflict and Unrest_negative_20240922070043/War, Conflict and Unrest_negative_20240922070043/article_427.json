    "text": "[+](javascipt:void(0);)\nUkraine has intensified its drone campaign with a night-time attack on a Kremlin military airfield near Volgograd and the capture of a village in Russia’s Kursk region. The attack on the Marinovka airbase, about 45 miles west of Volgograd, occurred around 3am and involved a series of explosions. The airbase, housing approximately 30 Su-34 and Su-35 fighter jets, has been a target due to its role in bombing Ukrainian positions. The extent of damage to the jets remains unclear.\nThis operation is part of Ukraine’s broader strategy of targeting key Russian infrastructure, with over 200 targets hit recently, including oil depots and airbases. Last week, Ukraine struck airbases Borisoglebsk and Savasleyka, and earlier this week, it attacked Moscow and the Arctic Murmansk region. Despite Russian claims of downing all hostile drones, Ukraine’s persistent attacks indicate a significant escalation in its offensive.\nIn addition to the airbase attack, Ukraine has claimed control over the village of Krasno-Oktyabrskoye in the Kursk region, with ongoing battles reported. This move aims to alleviate pressure on Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russian forces have been advancing toward key Ukrainian military hubs like Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad. Russian troops are reported to be within 7 miles of Pokrovsk and 3 miles from Myrnohrad, causing evacuations and a tense atmosphere.\nOn Thursday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited the Sumy region, highlighting the reduction in shelling and civilian casualties due to the Ukrainian-controlled buffer zone. Meanwhile, President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of attempting to strike the Kursk nuclear power station, although no evidence has been provided. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed finding drone fragments near the facility and plans a visit next week.\nThe Kremlin has also targeted journalists, issuing arrest warrants for CNN reporters, including Nick Paton-Walsh, who were in the Russian town of Sudzha. This follows recent tensions over American journalists’ presence in Russia. Putin’s administration has downplayed the invasion’s impact, with over 122,000 Russians fleeing the Kursk region. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy, criticized the Kremlin for ignoring the deteriorating situation and presenting the conflict as a new normal.",

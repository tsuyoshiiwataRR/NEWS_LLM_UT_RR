The Pakistani interior ministry and Prime Minister condemned the attack and called for swift apprehension of the culprits. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 23-08-2024 09:14 IST | Created: 23-08-2024 09:14 IST Robbers armed with guns and rocket-propelled grenades ambushed a police convoy in the Rahim Yar Khan district of Pakistan, leaving at least eleven officers dead and others wounded, according to police and the interior ministry. The attack occurred near the provincial border and targeted two police patrols. The police statement indicated a lack of control in the area, which is often used as a haven by numerous gangs. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the interior ministry strongly condemned the attack, urging police leadership to take immediate action to apprehend the culprits. Nine policemen were reported injured, said a Punjab police spokesperson. The border region is notorious for being a no-go area for civilians due to its use by criminal gangs as a refuge.

    "text": "Mourners carry the coffin of Yoram Metzger, one of the six hostages whose bodies were retrieved from Gazan captivity and brought to Israel in a military operation, at his funeral in Kibbutz Nir Oz, southern Israel, Aug. 22, 2024. Photo: REUTERS/Florion Goga\nBullets were found in the bodies of the six Israel i hostages retrieved from Gaza this week, the Israel i military and the Hostage Families Forum campaign group said on Thursday.\nThe military told Reuters it retrieved another four bodies alongside its hostages, presumed to be Hamas terrorists, and that those bodies did not show signs of bullet wounds.\nThe comments came a day after US President Joe Biden pressed Israel i Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the urgency of sealing a deal for a truce between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and the release of hostages held by Palestinian terrorists there.\nA total of 109 hostages are believed to remain in Gaza. About a third of them are thought to be dead, with the fate of the others unknown.\n“In every minute that the deal is not completed, another hostage could lose their life. It is clear to all that the return of the hostages is only possible through a deal,” the campaign group said.\nInternationally mediated ceasefire talks resumed in Cairo earlier on Thursday. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken left the region on Tuesday without producing a breakthrough to end the 10-month-old war.\nMonths of on-off ceasefire talks have circled the same issues, but Israel and the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas have stuck firmly to their demands.\nMost of Israel ‘s hostages were seized by Hamas gunmen who rampaged through southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 Israel is and foreigners and abducting around 250 as hostages.\nIsrael responded with a military campaign in neighboring Hamas-ruled Gaza aimed at freeing the hostages and dismantling the terrorist group’s military and governing capabilities.",

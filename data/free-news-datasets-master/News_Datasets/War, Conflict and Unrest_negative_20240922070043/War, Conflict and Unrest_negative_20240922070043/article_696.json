    "text": "2024-08-22 20:17:42\nThe feud between long-time Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and head coach Domenico Tedesco has reached a fever pitch. At the age of 32, she announced her retirement from the national team – because of Tedesco. The Real Madrid goalkeeper announced on social networks: “Unfortunately, following the incident with the coach and after careful consideration, I have decided not to return to the Belgian national team under his leadership.”\nThe situation was sparked in June when Tedesco handed injured Kevin De Bruyne forward Romelu Lukaku the captaincy in an international tie against Austria (1-1). with Courtois, who previously received the honor for his 100th international match. Although there was still a game against Estonia, the goalkeeper left after the game. After a recrimination ensued, with Courtois essentially accusing his coach of lying, the argument gradually worsened. Courtois was not selected for Belgium’s European Cup squad due to a torn cruciate ligament.\n1724358971\n#Courtois #longer #plays #Belgium #Tedesco",

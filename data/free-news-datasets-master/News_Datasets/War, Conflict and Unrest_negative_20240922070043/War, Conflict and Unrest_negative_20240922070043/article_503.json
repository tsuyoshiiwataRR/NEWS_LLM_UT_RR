    "text": "Darfur\nEast Darfur hospital bombed out of service, sparking health crisis fears\nAugust 22, 2024 (AL DAEIN) – Sudanese army airstrike on a major hospital in Sudan’s East Darfur state have forced its closure, doctors said on Thursday, warning of a looming health catastrophe for thousands in the conflict-ridden region.\nAl Daein Teaching Hospital was bombed on Tuesday, killing at least 15 people. The airstrike has left the facility completely unusable, according to hospital director Ali Mahmoud.\n“Al Daein Teaching Hospital is completely out of service,” said Mahmoud. Around 650 patients, including 200 children, were evacuated.\nThe closure has also impacted surrounding private clinics, raising concerns of a severe healthcare crisis in the area, which has been under the control of the paramilitary Rapid since late last year.\nThe bombing destroyed several wards including the men’s internal medicine ward, intensive care unit, mental health and tuberculosis departments. Three newborns and a stroke patient were among the casualties.\nSince the conflict erupted in April, most hospitals in Darfur have been rendered inoperable due to fighting, exacerbating the spread of diseases such as malaria, diarrhoea and malnutrition.",

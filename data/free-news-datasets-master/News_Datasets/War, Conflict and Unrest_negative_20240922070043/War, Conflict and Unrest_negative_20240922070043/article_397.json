    "text": "Ukrainian commanders are expressing concern over poorly trained recruits, who they say are contributing to the loss of territory on the eastern front. Inexperienced soldiers, some of whom refuse to fire at the enemy or abandon their posts, have been linked to recent setbacks near the strategic city of Pokrovsk.\nCommanders blame these losses on the rushed mobilization of new troops, who lack even basic combat training. Despite Ukraine’s recent incursions into Russia, its forces are struggling to hold ground against a better-equipped Russian army.\nThe situation has prompted commanders to call for improved training and better screening of recruits, as Ukrainian forces face mounting pressure in the region. The capture of Pokrovsk by Russian forces would be a significant blow to Ukraine’s defense efforts in the Donetsk region.\nGet the latest headlines delivered to your inbox each morning.

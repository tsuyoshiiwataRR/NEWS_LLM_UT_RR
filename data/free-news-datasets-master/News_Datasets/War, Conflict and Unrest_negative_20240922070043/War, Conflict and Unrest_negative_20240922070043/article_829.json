    "text": "Print Facebook X Telegram\nTalks on forming a Belgian coalition government were thrown into turmoil Thursday (22 August) as the chief negotiator handed his resignation to King Philippe, threatening further political limbo for the country two months after elections.\nFive groups had agreed in mid-July to formal coalition talks led by Flemish conservative Bart De Wever, in the wake of June legislative polls that boosted right-leaning parties.\nUsually the person forming the coalition goes on to become prime minister.\nBut De Wever, the mayor of Antwerp and head of the N-VA party that holds sway over the Dutch-speaking Flanders region, informed the king during a meeting late Thursday that the talks had fallen apart — largely due to a row over taxation.\nA palace statement said the king had accepted De Wever’s resignation and would pursue negotiations with the five party leaders himself starting on Friday “with a view to forming a government”.\nAlongside the N-VA, the other parties involved are the Reformist Movement and Les Engages (The Committed Ones) in French-speaking Wallonia, and the Christian-Democrats and the leftist Vooruit (Onward, formerly the Socialist Party) in Flanders.\nTogether, the five hold an 81-seat majority in Belgium’s 150-seat parliament.\nThe difficult talks finally hit a wall after the Reformist Movement rejected a capital gains tax proposed by De Wever as a way to plug the country’s budget deficit — 4.4% of gross domestic product in 2023 — while winning over the left-wing Vooruit.\nBelgium is one of seven European Union countries facing disciplinary action for running a deficit above three percent of GDP, in violation of the bloc’s fiscal rules.\nWith its linguistic division and complex regional and national system, Belgium has an unenviable record of painfully protracted coalition discussions — reaching 541 days back in 2010-2011.\nThe country’s 9 June elections — conducted the same day as a European Parliament vote across the EU — saw the right and centre-right triumphant.\nThe result was the loss of a parliamentary majority for the outgoing government of Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, a Flemish liberal who fronted a seven-party coalition formed after an arduous 493 days back in 2019.\nWith centre-right parties in prime positions across the country, analysts had predicted that finding a deal could take less time than usual — but still at least six months.\nFor the time being, De Croo remains as a caretaker leader until his successor is named.\nRead more with Euractiv Spanish government under threat as row with Catalan separatists over tax autonomy intensifies The Spanish government could face instability after the Catalonian pro-independence ERC party warned that it could block the national budget for 2025 if Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez fails to clarify provisions for a Catalan tax agency in a recently signed pact.",

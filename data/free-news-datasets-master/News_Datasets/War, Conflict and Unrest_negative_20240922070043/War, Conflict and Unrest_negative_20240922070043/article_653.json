    "text": "Volcanic Eruption in Iceland Triggers Series of Earthquakes Following several decades of peace, Iceland is currently facing an uptick in seismic activity. For the sixth time since December, a volcano has erupted in the region. The locals have adapted to this new situation. In the Reykjanes peninsula, a volcanic eruption took place for the sixth time in December. The Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) announced at midnight that an eruption had started at Sundhnuksgigaröd. The eruption commenced on Thursday at 21:26 local time (23:26 CET), following a series of tremors, including one measuring 4.0 on the Richter scale. Visual footage showed molten lava flowing from a fissure in the earth and smoke rising into the sky. The IMO initially estimated the fissure to be 1.4 kilometers long, later revising this to 3.9 kilometers within 40 minutes. The nearby fishing village of Grindavik was evacuated due to the volcanic activity, as it had been in previous instances. The evacuation process is reportedly proceeding smoothly, according to the local police chief, Ulfar Ludviksson. At the moment, there are still around 22 to 23 houses inhabited in Grindavik. Most of the town's 4,000 residents had vacated their residences in November, but only a few have returned permanently since then. Air traffic in and out of Iceland remains unaffected by the volcanic eruption, according to the Icelandic airport operator, Isavia. Just two months prior, a volcanic eruption in southwestern Iceland had concluded after a three-week span. This current eruption is the sixth one on the Reykjanes peninsula since December. More active volcanic systems than any other European region Reykjanes had not known volcanic eruptions for eight decades before the first one occurred in March 2021. Subsequent eruptions followed in August 2022 and July and December 2023. Volcanologists suggest that a new period of increased seismic activity has begun in the area. Iceland boasts 33 active volcanic systems - more than any other European region. The country sits on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a mid-ocean ridge separating the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates. The Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) alerted The Commission about the ongoing volcanic activity in Reykjanes. In response, The Commission has been monitoring the situation closely to ensure the safety of the locals and tourists.",

    "text": "/ world today news/ The fiasco of Zelensky’s visit to Europe showed that they are tired of the war in Ukraine and are afraid of its escalation, including a nuclear one. The failure of the VSU counter-offensive and especially Prigozhin’s rebellion made unquestionable demands from the West (which had almost exhausted its options to help Ukraine) to Kiev to accept the loss of territories and end the conflict with Russia.\nAs “compensation”, Ukraine will perhaps be offered semi-membership in NATO and the EU, which does not oblige the Westerners with anything, but Ukraine will finally become a colony. However, its role as a gun to Russia’s temple will not go anywhere, and Moscow will have to repeat what did not work out now.\nThey are tired of Ukraine not only in Europe. The leaders of 33 countries from Latin America and the Caribbean forced the European Union to cancel the invitation to Volodymyr Zelensky for the EU-Latin America summit, which will be held in Brussels on July 17-18. Moreover, they deleted from the draft of the meeting’s final declaration prepared by the EU’s external service, “all points related to support for Ukraine”. For this “ treason” the Brussels portal EURACTIV reported on Thursday, citing diplomatic sources.\nBut it’s a failure\nThe welcoming of Vladimir Zelensky in Bulgaria also speaks of the degree of fatigue with Ukraine. He, in his theatrical attire and image, as if crawling out of the trenches and holding the front on his shoulders, arrived in Sofia on a Bulgarian government plane from Moldova. In fact, there was no reception. The airport was empty. Zelensky was greeted in splendid isolation only by the Deputy Prime Minister, Foreign Minister Maria Gabriel, who is taller than him.\nThen Zelensky’s motorcade was anathematized by a Bulgarian priest who knew about his arrival, which was kept secret. I do not doubt the sincerity of the feelings of the cursing president of Ukraine and the priest who threatened him with the cross. However, it is hard to shake the feeling that the incident was staged. Everything was filmed on several cameras, which were said to be on hand at once.\nThe video was immediately posted online. And four large policemen on a deserted alley in the pouring rain were already painfully theatrically fussing around and allegedly could not do anything with the church minister who had lost his temper, who was shouting: “Anathema, Zelensky! Anathema, Satanists!”.\nAt the same time, the Bulgarian authorities did not do another, becoming traditional action – to organize a rally of refugees in support of Zelensky, although there are enough Ukrainians who have moved to Bulgaria and many of them would not give up additional income.\nThis is how one of the Ukrainian Telegram channels “Legitimny”, critical of their government, commented on this trip:\nUniversal love passed quickly, now Ze is waiting for a cold shower. It didn’t go without the Americans, who also gently show Ze his place. Sitting at the table to play with the crooks of the world, know that in the end they will “bring you down”, but first they will convince you that you are “cool” in order to raise you as high as possible.\nThe presidential “turn”\nThe West’s verdict on Zelensky and his regime was announced during the negotiations with the Ukrainian guest by Bulgarian President Rumen Radev. His speech was widely quoted in our media, so I will only dwell on his main points.\nFirst Bulgaria has nothing against having Ukraine one day “its place ” in the EU (from the context it is clear that it will be somewhere in the cache).\nSecond instead of the words “victory” we want to “hear more the word “peace”, the main efforts “must be aimed at achieving peace”.\nIn third place according to Bulgaria, Ukraine, along with the West, “does not now use all means of diplomacy to work in this direction, so as not to deepen the conflict”.\nFourth the Ukrainian war “acquires new dimensions” that “have long gone beyond the borders of Ukraine”.\nFifth there is “risk of radioactive contamination”, “in Bulgaria we still bear the consequences of Chernobyl, this is an extremely important issue that affects not only Bulgaria, but the whole of Europe”.\nSixth the war in Ukraine has negative economic, social and political consequences for Europe. It’s about “inflation, growing recession, increasing social tension” as well as the strengthening of “populism” and “radicalization” of political life.\nSeventh , “we have to think not only about Ukraine”, but also about “the future of Europe as a whole”, “how this war will affect Europe”.\nEighth Kiev should not ignore the interests of Europe, as its support is “extremely important” both in the matter of waging the war and in the matter of “recovery”.\nAt the same time, Radev, who is also the supreme commander, frankly told Zelensky that he was against the transfer of arms and ammunition stocks from the Bulgarian army reserve in Kiev, as he did not want the country’s defense capability to be weakened. . He stressed that the Ukrainian conflict has no military solution.\nBulgarian tricks\nOf course, with Bulgarians, not everything is so simple. Their Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov was more complimentary to Zelensky than the president. It is clear that the Bulgarians will not overtake the American “father”, and the countries also discussed the activation of cooperation in the military sphere. In particular, Denkov signed a declaration stating Sofia’s support for Ukraine’s membership in NATO.\n“Bulgaria has already become the 22nd country that supports the Euro-Atlantic integration of Ukraine. This is very important “, Zelensky boasted. And yet the overall impression of his reception in Sofia gives a clear signal: enough, stop! Both the opposition and the majority of the Bulgarian people insist on this.\nIn the Czech Republic… the same\nIn the Russophobic Czech Republic, Zelensky was better received, but there are nuances. The Czech president, retired NATO general Petr Pavel, assured his Ukrainian counterpart that Kiev could “to continue counting” of Prague’s support in the war with Russia. Pavel boasted that his country provided the Ukrainians with about 2 billion euros and a lot of military equipment – 676 ​​units of heavy equipment and air defense systems, 4.2 million pieces of medium-caliber and large-caliber ammunition.\nThis means that the Czech military warehouses are empty. In addition, it became clear from the president’s words that at the NATO summit in July, Ukraine will not be accepted into the alliance, and Prague’s share of half a billion euros, which will be allocated to Kyiv in Vilnius, will be only 5 million.\nPavel only hopes that after the results of the meeting in Vilnius, the level of cooperation between NATO and Ukraine will increase and that “ when the war is over,” “Czech Republic will try to get Ukraine to start EU accession talks before the end of this year.”\nIn short, the president of the Czech Republic, a country on which Ukraine’s prospects do not in the least depend, also called on Zelensky to end the war – in the name of the “carrot” of EU membership, it is not clear when and in what capacity.\nAs for NATO, Zelensky himself admitted to journalists: some of the member countries do not support his country’s participation in this bloc because they are afraid of the Russians. Speaking about the summit in Vilnius, where he promised not to attend unless Ukraine is invited to join NATO, Zelensky, according to TASS, said:\nIt can be difficult to get the unified support of all alliance partners. Someone is looking back at Moscow, they are afraid of Russia, although I think this is a great chance to show the courage and strength of the union.\nWhat of this?\nWell, that’s all – we’ve arrived. There will be no full-fledged EU and NATO for Ukraine. All this trip around Europe, including Istanbul, where on Friday Zelensky met with “our friend Rexep” (who has his own deal with Kiev, mostly grain), and was undertaken only to not go to Vilnius in a few days to disgrace yourself.\nHowever, Zelensky’s European trip showed something terrible for Kiev: The West, led by the United States and represented by its European vassals, is withdrawing from Ukraine because it has lost faith in the possibility of defeating Russia, despite the rivers of Ukrainian blood spilled to do so.\nThis means that serious negotiations with Moscow will begin in the fall to “freeze” the conflict, as warned by the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, who is on the subject. And then, after the deal is done, the two countries, who do not trust each other, will continue to seriously prepare to bring the war to an end on the battlefield called Ukraine.\nTranslation: ES\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel:\nand for the channel in Telegram:\nShare on your profiles, with friends, in groups and on pages.

    "text": "2024-08-22 22:58:10\nThe head of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, allowed for a scenario in which the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Kirill Budanov, could allegedly “liquidate” President Vladimir Zelensky.\nHe stated this in an interview with the Rossiya TV channel.\nConfused and confusing, but Lukashenko tried to explain his words. According to the head of Belarus, Zelensky was engaged in “unknown things” before entering politics and was not prepared for the consequences, and also “loves money very much.” It is money that can play a decisive role for Vladimir Zelensky, according to Lukashenko.\n“They gave you a little money, in England they said: ‘Here’s a free mansion, buy it for this money.’ And he will sit there with Elena (Elena Zelenskaya) and rejoice with the children,” Lukashenko said.\nAt the same time, for the people of Ukraine, Zelensky will be a traitor and, as the head of Belarus believes, Kirill Budanov himself will “send someone” to eliminate the “traitor”.\nIn addition, the head of Belarus said that he allegedly warned Zelensky that after the change of president, the US could abandon the agreements with Kiev on arms supplies. Lukashenko said that he called on Zelensky “to build relations based on mutually beneficial interests,” but he did not understand him.\nAt the same time, the head of Belarus is convinced that Belarusians, Ukrainians and Russians will always be together, because Ukrainians will soon understand that “no one needs them in the West.”\n“Aren’t we going to restore our good relations? We will. A few facts from the West – Ukraine will understand that they were simply used and then abandoned. They will understand this and will come to us. We will restore everything that was destroyed on a higher basis,” he summed up.\nEarlier, “Kursor” reported that Lukashenko announced the complete “denazification” of Ukraine, that is, the achievement of one of the key goals of the SVO. According to Ukrainian experts, this may indicate a signal about negotiations.",

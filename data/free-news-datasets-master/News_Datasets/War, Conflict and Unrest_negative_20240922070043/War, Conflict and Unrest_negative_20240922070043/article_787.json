    "text": "The Middle East is in turmoil and the global geopolitical chessboard could soon undergo major changes. The deal to release the hostages and the ceasefire is now on the verge of collapse and there is no alternative scheme that can be presented in its place, two senior US and two Israeli officials told Politico. “We don’t know if Sinwar wants the deal,” one source said. “If he doesn’t want it, there is a possibility that Iran will attack and the situation will escalate.” As the US pushes for a summit in Cairo on Friday, one Israeli official said: “It is not at all certain that there will be a summit. If there is, there will be nothing to talk about as long as Israel remains in its position.”\nIran, meanwhile, could launch a coordinated ground-to-air attack against Israel in response to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. The Iranian permanent mission to the United Nations announced this, providing details on the timing and manner of the retaliation. The Iranian response has two main purposes, as explained by the Mehr\nnews agency: “to punish the aggressor for terrorism and violation of Iran’s national sovereignty” and “to strengthen Iran’s deterrent power to prevent any future aggression”. Furthermore, according to Iranian diplomats, “Iran’s response should avoid a possible negative impact on a possible ceasefire” in the Gaza Strip.\n#IsraelHamas #failed #deal #Iran #plans #surfacetoair #attack #Tempo\n2024-08-23 03:21:25",

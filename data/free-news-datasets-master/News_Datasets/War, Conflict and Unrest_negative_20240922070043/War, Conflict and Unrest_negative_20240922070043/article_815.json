    "text": "/ world today news/ Ukrainian border regions are in a panic. The enterprises were evacuated, the fortifications were erected, the approaches were mined. Constantinople understood the reasons for the Ukrainians’ panic – and found in this equation a trace of the notorious PMC.\nNo one has attacked yet, but everyone has already fled\nThe border Sumy and Kharkiv are buzzing like devastated beehives. Or rather like typical cities in preparation for defense. Local officials and security forces rush to move the archives out and burn anything they don’t have time to move out. Businessmen evacuate businesses in western Ukraine.\nSeveral large city-building enterprises have already been transported to Zapadenshchyna (western regions of Ukraine, note ed.). In particular, they have already “left” the Hartron Aviation Plant, partly the Kharkiv Transport Engineering Plant “V. A. Malyshev” (which produced tanks and trains), the Kharkiv Bearing Plant, “Turboatom”, the Komunar plant (which produced the Neptune missiles). ), FED Engineering Plant, which manufactures aerospace equipment.\nAnd even the factories of the peaceful and non-strategic Kulinichi bread concern went to Galicia, although there are no grain reserves in the Occidental region that would allow it to work successfully on its land.\n“The mayor of Kharkiv, Terekhov, constantly reports on various channels that Kharkiv is an outpost of an independent Ukraine, and many residents of Kharkiv already say that this is not good. The same was said in Mariupol, Severodonetsk and Artemovsk,” says the Adequate Kharkiv resident”, journalist and reserve colonel Gennady Alyokhin, living in Russia, but not losing touch with his small homeland.\nAccording to the blogger, between Kharkiv and Belgorod, the fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, together with the territorial defense, are intensively digging trenches, in particular in the Volchan region.\nIn the area of ​​the Slatino and Kazachia Lopan railway stations, the enemy intensively mined the territory with anti-personnel and anti-tank shells.\nThis information was confirmed by the head of the pro-Russian military-civil administration of the Kharkiv region, Vitaly Ganchev. He also said that the Ukrainian authorities are forcing local residents to leave their native land.\n“We know that certain actions are taking place in Kharkiv and the region, which local residents have also informed us about.\nPeople are being driven from their homes, forced to leave the region, and meanwhile the so-called protectors are moving out businesses and whatever they find in the empty houses.”\nThis is what Ganchev said in an interview with TASS.\nA similar picture is also observed in Sumy region, it’s just that Sumy is incomparable in size and industrial potential with the million-strong city of Kharkiv. Because there the process is not so obvious. Chernihiv region does not lag behind its neighbors in the commotion.\nHowever, the evacuation in the border areas of the region began at the end of May this year.\n“Being in one of the settlements, he personally convinced a family of local residents to leave immediately because there was imminent danger,” lied a month later, at the end of June, the commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Sergey Naev, saying that Russia continuously shelling the territories bordering Ukraine.\n“I am currently calling on all citizens who live in the border areas of the Sumy region to leave,” he said at the time.\nAccording to the blogger, between Kharkiv and Belgorod, the fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, together with the territorial defense, are intensively digging trenches, in particular in the Volchan region.\nIn the area of ​​the Slatino and Kazachia Lopan railway stations, the enemy intensively mined the territory with anti-personnel and anti-tank shells.\nThis information was confirmed by the head of the pro-Russian military-civil administration of the Kharkiv region, Vitaly Ganchev. He also said that the Ukrainian authorities would have to return\nWe remind you: the Russian army has already entered the territory of Sumy and Kharkiv regions. But the first, along with Chernigov and Kiev, she left after the Istanbul Agreement, as a result of which Russia was deceived and misled. And the second area – after the known regrouping.\nBut we have to get back there. After all, after the withdrawal from these territories, we laid bare our borders – Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod regions. And the enemy did not fail to take advantage of this.\nIt is no coincidence that during a recent meeting with military commanders, President Vladimir Putin spoke about the need to create a sanitary zone.\n“And if this continues, then we must, obviously, consider the issue of creating some sanitary zone on the territory of Ukraine at such a distance from which it would be impossible to reach our territory,” the Russian president warned.\nExperienced nurses\nBy the way, immediately after the regrouping of our army from the Kharkiv and Sumy regions, Yevgeny Prigozhin took up the creation and training of fighters for the territorial self-defense of the Belgorod and Kursk regions. On his account, he claimed.\nIn those days they were afraid to give arms to the new militias. But in the border areas, the open terror of puppet collaborators from the so-called Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) began. And the bloody orgy of shelling of the armed forces of Ukraine.\nNoticing this, Prigozhin threatened to bring PMC Wagner there and settle the matter like an adult. In particular, he gave the Ministry of Defense two weeks to resolve the issue.\n“If this does not happen and if the situation worsens, then we will go to Belgorod. And we will defend our land,” he declared.\n“But we will insist that Frunzenskaya (headquarters of the Ministry of Defense in Moscow. – Ed.) also move to Belgorod. If I die, then it will all be together,” said PMC head Wagner.\nAs is known, the “Ahmat” special forces subsequently advanced to the border territories, and the bandits from the RDK* suddenly stopped their raids. But not the shelling of Russian soil. And the issue of creating a sanitary zone is still acute.\nPreparing for a concert?\nAccording to “TsarigraD” sources, even before Prigozhin’s “shooting riot”, a group of “musicians” arrived in the Belgorod region. And not the weakest. Maybe for reinforcement. Or research?\n“We are resting and preparing. On June 5 we left, on August 5, according to forecasts, PMC “Wagner” in full combat readiness will be able to perform the assigned combat tasks”, I remember that the head of the “Orchestra” shared his plans even before the start of the commotion .\nWe have already assumed that the northwestern direction, which had to be abandoned by the Russian army in 2022, could become the new tasks of the PMC.\nWe also analyzed why it is easier for “musicians” to enter from the territory of Belarus not directly, through swamps and minefields, namely through the region of Chernigov or Kharkiv with the prospect of moving to Sumy and Poltava.\nIf we assume this, then we should not assume that something similar was not calculated in the headquarters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n“I do not rule out that these Wagnerites who went to Belarus appear in the same Sumy. I do not deny the possibility that Prigozhin is now sitting and signing contracts for new military operations,” military expert, retired colonel Anatoly Matviychuk, shared his opinion with Tsarigrad.\n“Obviously, a sanitary cordon will be created around Ukraine, which will remain after the end of this conflict,” he also said.\nWhat follows from this?\nThe fact that the situation at the borders, on the one hand, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, and on the other – Belgorod, Kursk and Bryansk regions, cannot remain the same is obvious. Because every day there are shelling of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, houses are burning, there are people killed and wounded.\nAnd also because Russian people live here and there, divided according to the whims of various political adventurers. These people need a peaceful and secure life. And for the entire Russian people – historical justice.\nBut even with a high degree of certainty, we can only guess how events will develop further. Therefore, there is only one thing left – to wait for August.\n* The Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) is a terrorist organization banned in Russia.\nTranslation: SM\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel:\nand for the channel in Telegram:\nShare on your profiles, with friends, in groups and on pages.

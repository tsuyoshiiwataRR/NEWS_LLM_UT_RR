    "text": "GAZA STRIP, Palaestinian Territories: The Israeli military has issued so many evacuation orders in 10 months of war that many Gaza civilians no longer heed them, despairing of finding space or safety in the shrinking “humanitarian” zones.\nOver the first three weeks of August, the Israeli army sent out 11 evacuation orders via flyers dropped from planes, text messages or social media.\nThey called on 250,000 Gazans, almost all of whom had been displaced at least once already, to leave their place of shelter.\n“The Israeli army will operate with force against terrorist organizations in this area. For your safety, we urge you to evacuate immediately,” read one such order sent out Thursday in the southern province of Khan Yunis.\n“Every time we arrive somewhere, we get a new evacuation order two days later. This is no way to live,” Haitham Abdelaal told AFP.\nAmneh Abu Daqqa, 45, said she saw no point in moving again, so few were the options for safe haven.\n“To go where?” asked the displaced mother of five.\n“I live on the street, literally. I don’t have 500 shekels ($133) to rent a donkey-pulled cart. And I don’t even know where I’d go,” she said.\n“There is nowhere safe, there are air strikes everywhere.”\nThe proliferation of Israeli evacuation orders also severely complicates relief distribution by United Nations agencies in a blockaded territory where aid trickles in via Israeli-held entry points.\nWednesday’s evacuation order included “80 makeshift sites” but also offices and warehouses used by aid agencies, the UN humanitarian affairs office (OCHA) said.\nThe orders also affected “three water wells... which serve tens of thousands of people,” OCHA added.\nSometimes, the evacuation orders close roads, including the main Salah Al-Din highway that runs the length of Gaza from north to south.\nWhen portions of it are included in evacuation orders, transport becomes a headache.\nTrucks must use the coast road that runs parallel to Salah Al-Din, currently lined with makeshift camps that make movement “extremely slow and at times impossible,” OCHA said.\nNerman Al-Bashniti, who lives in one such camp, told AFP: “When the Israeli army took the street that we were on, we ran to the sea, left our tent and all our belongings inside.\n“Where will we go now? We can only throw ourselves into the sea and let the fish eat us.”\nIn the early days of the war, the Israeli army touted its plans for the displaced.\nAfter it ordered the evacuation of the north in the first week of the war, it published a map of Gaza broken down into several hundred numbered blocks, and declared the southern area of Al-Mawasi a “humanitarian zone.”\nTo let Palestinians know precisely which areas will be targeted by military operations, its evacuation orders feature the numbered blocks varying in size depending on building density.\nBut the many blocks have made the orders confusing and sometimes even contradictory, such as on occasions when blocks listed for evacuation were not featured as to be evacuated on the accompanying maps.\nFrom 1,200 inhabitants per square kilometer before the war, the Al-Mawasi “humanitarian zone” now houses “between 30,000 and 34,000 people per square kilometer” and its protected area shrank from 50 square kilometers to 41, the UN calculated.\nMost of Gaza is one extended built-up area, but Al-Mawasi was the location of most of the territory’s Jewish settlements before Israel demolished them when it pulled out in 2005 leaving farmland fringed by the beach.\nNow the area is a vast tent-city with more families desperately looking for space to pitch a tent with each new evacuation order.\nProliferating evacuation orders sow chaos, confusion in Gaza\nhttps://arab.news/wk7hq\nProliferating evacuation orders sow chaos, confusion in Gaza\n- Israeli military sent out 11 evacuation orders via flyers dropped from

grappling with the steep obstacles to conducting mass vaccination in the war-torn Palestinian territory.\nUnrelenting airstrikes by Israel more than 10 months into its war against Gaza rulers Hamas, restrictions of aid entering the besieged territory, and hot summer temperatures all threaten the viability of a life-saving inoculation drive.\nStill, equipment to support the extensive campaign — which UN agencies say could start on Aug. 31 — has already arrived in the region.\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry in the occupied West Bank said last week that tests in Jordan had confirmed polio in an unvaccinated 10-month-old baby from central Gaza.\nAccording to the UN, Gaza had not registered a case for 25 years, although type 2 poliovirus was detected in samples collected from the territory’s wastewater in June.\nPoliovirus is highly infectious and most often spread through sewage and contaminated water — an increasingly common problem in Gaza.\nThe disease mainly affects children under the age of five.\nIt can cause deformities and paralysis and is potentially fatal.\nUN bodies, the World Health Organization, and children’s agency UNICEF say they have detailed plans to vaccinate 640,000 children across Gaza.\nBut a significant challenge remains Israel’s devastating military campaign.\n“It’s extremely difficult to undertake a vaccination campaign of this scale and volume under a sky full of airstrikes,” said Juliette Touma, director of communications for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.\nUnder the UN plan, 2,700 health workers in 708 teams would take part, with the WHO overseeing the effort, said Richard Peeperkorn, the agency’s representative in the Palestinian territories.\nUNICEF would ensure the cold supply chain as vaccines are brought into and distributed across Gaza, spokesman Jonathan Crickx said.\nCold chain components, including refrigerators, arrived Wednesday at Israel’s main international airport.\nDemolition of historic Alexandria site sparks public controversy\n- Residents of the Egyptian city post messages on Facebook confirming part of Dekheila Fort, a site dating back as far as 1250 A.D., has been destroyed\n- Heritage enthusiast Ziad Morsi says: ‘Unfortunately, what was demolished is the oldest registered Mamluk-era monument in Alexandria’\nCAIRO: The recent demolition of parts of Dekheila Fort, a historic site near Alexandria that dates back to 1250 A.D., has sparked widespread controversy and criticism.\nOfficials from the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities declined to respond to a request for comment on the destruction at the site but residents and heritage campaigners posted messages on Facebook that seemed to confirm it happened.\nIn one such post, local resident and heritage enthusiast Ziad Morsi said Dekheila Fort consisted of two structures and two cannons. One of the structures, known as the basin, which was built during the Mamluk period that ran from 1250 to 1517, has been demolished, he confirmed.\nThe second structure, which remains standing, is a tower that is a remnant of fortifications built by Ghalis Pasha during the reign of Muhammad Ali Pasha (1805-1848) and reinforced with Armstrong cannons during the rule of Khedive Ismail Pasha (1863-1879), he said.\nMorsi wrote on Tuesday: “We were surprised yesterday by images from the Dekheila area showing a bulldozer demolishing the dry dock area and Dekheila Fort. I want to highlight a few points, the first of which is that the Dekheila beach area contains several historical sites, some of which are officially listed as Islamic antiquities in Egypt, while others remain unregistered.\n“Unfortunately, what was demolished is the oldest registered Mamluk-era monument in Alexandria. Some friends had plans to conduct detailed studies and propose a restoration project for it.”\nAbdel Rahim Rehan, head of the Campaign to Defend Egyptian Civilization, an organization established a few years ago to encourage preservation of the nation’s heritage, said: “The basin adjacent to Dekheila fort, which is reportedly demolished, is registered with the Ministry of Antiquities.\n“It is located directly on the shore of Lake Dekheila and was used during the Mamluk era for city defense. However, it was repurposed during the reign of Muhammad Ali Pasha as a lighthouse to guide ships entering Alexandria’s ports.”\nHe added that the basin had suffered damage from winter coastal storms, marine debris and sewage infrastructure.\nThe Alexandria Antiquities Directorate has not commented on the demolition at the site. However, on Wednesday it said two historical cannons had been moved as part of a transfer of artifacts from the Dekheila fortifications to the nearby Kom El-Nadoura archaeological area.\nAn official from the directorate said: “Each cannon weighs 9 tonnes and they were moved following approval from the Permanent Committee for Islamic and Coptic Antiquities to ensure better preservation at the new site, as they are among the most important registered artifacts.\n“The transfer was conducted under special procedures to preserve the cannons, with police security provided during the move. The cannons are now part of a collection in Kom El-Nadoura in Alexandria, where a display area for the cannons is being prepared. It will be completed once the entire contents of the fort are transferred.”\nThe Department of Archaeological Engineering and Environment at Cairo University’s Faculty of Engineering previously carried out studies at the site in preparation for a restoration project but no work was carried out.\nIsrael military court extends house arrest of soldiers accused of Palestinian prisoner abuse\n- UN special rapporteur on torture has said the alleged sexual abuse case is “particularly gruesome” and called on Israel’s civilian courts to investigate\nJERUSALEM: Israel’s military court has extended the house arrest of soldiers accused of sexually abusing a Palestinian detainee until Sept. 4 but will allow the defense to hold a hearing on Sunday to request an alternative to detention, the military said on Thursday.\nIt specified such an alternative could include ‘a place of work and suitable supervisors’.\nThe soldiers have been accused of sexually abusing a member of an elite Hamas unit at the Sde Teiman detention facility in the Negev desert in southern Israel, according to Israeli press reports.\nThe United Nations special rapporteur on torture has said the alleged sexual abuse case is “particularly gruesome” and called on Israel’s civilian courts to investigate and hold the perpetrators to account.\nThe UN has received multiple reports of alleged torture against Palestinians detained since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed Israel in a shock assault that killed some 1,200 people.\nMore than 40,000 people have been killed in Gaza in the 10 months of fighting that have followed, according to health officials in the Palestinian enclave.\nJapanese FM hopes Lebanese government will urge Hezbollah to avoid escalation\n- China advises its citizens to leave Lebanon ‘as soon as possible’\n- Israeli warplanes carry out near-simultaneous raids on 14 border villages\nBEIRUT: Japan says it hopes the Lebanese government will urge Hezbollah to avoid escalating hostilities to prevent its conflict with Israel spreading across the region.\nIn a telephone call to her Lebanese counterpart, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa said Tokyo was “closely monitoring the situation in the Middle East with deep concern” and “calls on all parties to refrain from escalation and avoid a full-scale war in the region.”\nHer appeal came as Israeli warplanes on Thursday carried out several raids on border villages in southern Lebanon, destroying several buildings.\nAccording to Lebanon’s caretaker Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib’s media office, Kamikawa “emphasized Japan’s support for the tripartite effort led by the US, Egypt and Qatar to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza.”\nDuring the call, Bou Habib warned that the situation in the region could spiral out of control if negotiations regarding Gaza failed.\nHe reiterated Lebanon’s “desire to avoid escalation and war and the need for a ceasefire in Gaza to establish calm in southern Lebanon and the region.”\nHe said he appreciated Japan’s “support for Lebanon at the UN.”\nKamikawa said Japan was coordinating with France on the UN Security Council regarding the extension of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon’s mandate, recognizing its importance.\nCaretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati's media office said the ongoing communications regarding the Security Council’s renewal of UNIFIL’s mandate for another year at the end of this month “showed an understanding of Lebanon’s demand to maintain the tasks of these forces without introducing any changes that could complicate the already tense situation.”\nThe Chinese Embassy in Beirut, meanwhile, said in a statement on Thursday that Beijing was urging its citizens in Lebanon to leave “as soon as possible.”\n“Recently, the situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border has continued to be tense and security circumstances in Lebanon are severe and complex,” it said.\n“The current level of risk to travel in Lebanon’s South and Nabatieh Governorates is red (extremely high risk) and other areas is orange (high risk).”\nIsraeli warplanes carried out almost simultaneous raids on Thursday on 14 border villages. They followed 13 military operations carried out by Hezbollah on Wednesday against Israeli army positions and outposts.\nThe Israeli raids targeted homes in Aita Al-Shaab, Kfarshouba, Mhaibib, Mais Al-Jabal, Wadi Al-Azba near Zebqine, Chihine, Kaouthariyet Al-Saiyad, Ramyeh, Kfarkila, Naqoura, Jable, Labbouneh and Allam.\nArmy spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on X that Israeli forces “attacked and destroyed Hezbollah targets in over 10 different areas in southern Lebanon.”\n“The targets included weapons depots, military buildings and a rocket launcher used by Hezbollah to carry out attack operations against Israel.”\nHezbollah said it responded with an attack on “the Branit site with heavy artillery shells” and “an aerial attack with a fleet of drones on Israeli army positions in the Kiryat Shmona settlement.”\nIt also targeted “spy equipment in the Jal Al-Allam site with an attack drone, hitting it directly,” and targeted “gatherings for Israeli soldiers in the surroundings of the Metula settlement, using direct weapons and causing direct hits.”\nHezbollah also targeted “a positioning of Israeli soldiers near Al-Ghajar site with appropriate weapons, killing and injuring its members,” it said.\nNo casualties were reported following the Israeli attacks, but Israeli media said “three mortars landed in Metula, near the Lebanese border, without causing the sirens to activate.”\nWhile the army spokesperson gave no explanation for the shelling a Lebanese security source said Hezbollah’s attacks on Wednesday “didn’t violate the rules of engagement.”\nHezbollah’s attacks on Wednesday targeted the Tsnobar logistics base in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights after Israel attacked Hezbollah’s weapon depots in northern Bekaa on Tuesday. Some of Hezbollah’s rockets landed in the town of Katzrin, injuring one person.\nIsraeli Channel 7 reported that 60 homes in the town had been damaged.\nSpeaking to Israeli Radio 104.5, Yehuda Dua, the head of the local council in Katzrin, said: “Five Hezbollah rockets hit the town, destroying homes and leaving families homeless.”\nAccording to the emergency health report prepared by the Lebanese Ministry of Health, “from Oct. 8, 2023 until Aug. 20, 2024 the total number of recorded injuries has reached 2,412, including 564 fatalities.”\nAbandoned oil tanker threatens Red Sea ecology, trade, warns EU naval mission\n- MV Sounion was attacked by Houthis on Wednesday\n- Four members of Yemen’s Baha’i community released after more than a year\nAL-MUKALLA: A tanker carrying 150,000 tonnes of crude oil that became adrift in the Red Sea after multiple Houthi strikes is now threatening the sea’s environment and maritime navigation traffic, the EU naval mission said on Thursday.\nThe EU naval mission in the Red Sea, known as EUNAFVOR ASPIDES, said that its warship evacuated the crew members of the Greek-flagged MV Sounion, which lost engine power after being attacked several times in the Red Sea and ferried them to Djibouti.\n“Carrying 150.000 tonnes of crude oil, the MV SOUNION now represents a navigational and environmental hazard. It is essential that everyone in the area exercises caution and refrains from any actions that could lead to a deterioration of the current situation,” the EU mission said in a post on X.\nA senior government official in Yemen’s southern city of Aden told Arab News on Thursday that relevant authorities are gathering information regarding the danger posed by the abandoned ship.\nIn May, a ship carrying 21,000 metric tons of ammonium phosphate sulfate fertilizer crashed in the Red Sea after being hit by Houthi missiles, prompting fears of an ecological disaster.\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center said on Thursday that the MV Sounion on Wednesday exchanged fire with two boats before being hit by projectiles northwest of Yemen’s Red Sea port city of Hodeidah.\nAll of the projectiles ripped through the starboard quarter, damaging the engine compartment, causing a contained fire, and injuring a crew member. The tanker had no links to the US, UK or Israel, which is the Houthis’ rationale for targeting ships in international commerce channels.\nIn a speech on Thursday, Houthi leader Abdul Malik Al-Houthi claimed responsibility for the attack on tanker, saying it violated the militia’s ban on sailing to Israeli ports.\nHe also stated that his troops carried out 21 operations against ships using ballistic and cruise missiles, drones, and drone boats in the last seven days, bringing the total number of ships attacked to 182 since the start of their anti-ship campaign.\nThis comes as the UK Maritime Trade Operations said on Thursday that a cargo ship was slightly damaged after being attacked by a drone 57 nautical miles south of Aden, but the ship’s crew members were unharmed. The master of the same ship, the Panama-flagged SW North Wind I, told UKMTO of five explosions near the ship on Wednesday, with no reported damage or crew injuries.\nAccording to marinetraffic.com, the SW North Wind I is a bulk carrier heading from South Korea to Egypt.\nSince November, the Houthis have seized a commercial ship, sunk two more, and launched hundreds of drones, drone boats, and ballistic missiles at commercial and naval vessels in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and other areas, claiming that their actions are intended to force Israel to end its war in the Gaza Strip.\nAs part of actions to degrade Houthi military capabilities, US Central Command said its troops destroyed a Houthi surface-to-air missile and radar system in Yemen. The Houthis said that the US and UK forces launched five attacks on the province of Hodeidah this week.\nMeanwhile, the Baha’i International Community, which speaks on behalf of the religious group, said the Houthis have freed the final four Yemeni Baha’is imprisoned by the militia for more than a year.\nIn May 2023, armed Houthis attacked a Baha’i gathering in Sanaa and abducted 17 people, sparking anger, condemnations and allegations against the Houthis for oppressing Yemen’s religious minorities.\n“We are relieved that this grim, unjust, and absurd episode is finally over. But these 17 Baha’is should never have been arrested in the first place. The group had gathered in a private home for a peaceful community activity,” Saba Haddad, representative of the Baha’i International Community to the UN in Geneva, said in a statement.\nThe Houthis accuse the Baha’is of being infidels and spying for the US and Israel.\nPrint Edition\n[Read pdf version](/pdfissues.php) Subscribe now",

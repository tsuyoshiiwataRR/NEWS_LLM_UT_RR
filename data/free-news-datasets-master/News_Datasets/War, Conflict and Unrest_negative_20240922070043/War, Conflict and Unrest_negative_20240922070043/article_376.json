    "text": "Warning: contains spoilers for Avengers #17 Marvel's very own Superman , the Multiversal \"hero\" known as Hyperion, returns to Earth-616 as a major Avengers villain in Avengers #17 , attempting to destroy the entire planet with one monstrous punch. Mark Milton, last seen in the 2021 Heroes Reborn event , is a powerful parody of Clark Kent, whose various universal counterparts have been heroes, villains, and even an Avenger. The \"original\" Hyperion was the villainous leader of the Squadron Sinister but became better known as the righteous and just heroic leader of the Squadron Supreme , a pastiche of DC Comics' iconic Justice League that debuted in 1971's The Avengers #85.\nThe Avengers can truly never catch a break, as Hyperion's vicious assault on Earth is happening right after the deadly Blood Hunt concludes. Thankfully, Avengers #17 - from writer Jed MacKay and artist Valerio Schiti - also introduces the epic X-Men hero Storm as the world's newest Avenger, just in time for the goddess to battle Hyperion.\nSquadron Supreme\nSquadron Supreme is a group of superheroes that dates back to 1971 when they first appeared in The Avengers #85. Several characters have rotated through the team since then, but core members include Hyperion, Nighthawk, Doctor Spectrum, Whizzer, and Power Princess. Many of the members were based on the supervillains from Marvel’s Squadron Sinister.\nHyperion Has Not Been Seen In Over Two Years Mark Milton's entire existence was revealed to be fake\nThe Hyperion who reveals his plan to destroy Earth in Avengers #17 is a fascinating amalgamation of two versions of the iconic hero and has not been seen since 2022's Avengers #50. Mark Milton of Earth-616 is actually an artificial construct created and given life by the demon Mephisto , in a plan to take over the world alongside the villainous Phil Coulson. To that end, Coulson used the Pandemonium Cube to create the Heroes Reborn universe, where the Avengers didn't exist, and the Squadron Supreme were Earth's Mightiest Heroes. After the Avengers reclaimed their identities and defeated Mephisto, the heroic memories of the Heroes Reborn Hyperion were transferred to Mephisto's Hyperion simulacrum.\nMarvel's Real Superman Has A Surprising Eternals Connection\nAfter the collapse of Coulson's Squadron Supreme, the Hyperion construct was incredibly confused and conflicted, unsure of who he was or if his entire life was a lie (it was). In Avengers #50, Hyperion was shown seeking out the Red Widow, so that she could deprogram him after months of mental manipulation by Coulson and the Power Elite. Milton was last seen being \"freed\" from his brainwashing through Red Room protocols at the hands of the Red Widow. Now, an emotionally devastated Hyperion has resurfaced in Avengers #17, convinced that either his life - or Earth-616 - is a \"lie,\" prompting him to threaten a galactic murder-suicide to \"solve\" this existential problem . Clearly, whatever the Red Widow did to Hyperion may have freed him from his previous programming, but did not heal his fractured mind.\nThe Avengers Now Have Storm To Help Them Stop Hyperion The X-Men leader's first Avengers mission will be intense\nAvengers #17 sees Captain America recruiting Storm to join the Avengers once again, believing that the Avengers failed mutantkind and her representation on the team would help the mutant race, and strengthen Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Ororo is immediately thrust into a battle for the fate of planet Earth, as Hyperion announces his intention to destroy the world right after she accepts her new role as an Avenger. Hyperion has defeated all the Avengers at one point or another. Still, he has never faced the Omega-level might of Storm , a goddess and mutant fighter who will give the powerful super-being a run for his money.\nHyperion is not pure evil, instead, he is a broken and scared man who can't get over the fact that his entire life was built on a demonic lie . Hopefully, Storm of the Avengers will be able to stop Hyperion without needing to kill him, instead showing him the error of his ways and setting him on a more heroic path once again.\nAvengers #17 from Marvel Comics is available now in stores.\nComics Avengers Your changes have been saved\nEmail is sent\nEmail has already been sent\nclose Please verify your email address.\nSend confirmation email close You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.\nManage Your List Follow Followed Follow with Notifications Follow Unfollow Close",

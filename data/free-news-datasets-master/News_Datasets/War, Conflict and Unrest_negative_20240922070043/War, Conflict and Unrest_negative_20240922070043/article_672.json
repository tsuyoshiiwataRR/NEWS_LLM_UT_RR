    "text": "LAHORE: Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari has said that the so-called ‘Fitna’ party has been continuously staging rallies and protests to incite unrest for the past year. According to her, the PTI’s gatherings have only served to sow discord and division. She claimed that the prisoner in Adiala Jail has shown no loyalty to the country or the nation. She further described those she referred to as “digital terrorists” as neither peaceful nor civilised, rather as representing the most extreme form of radicalism. Bokhari continued, “We have been hearing for a long time about the announcement, postponement, and rescheduling of rallies. The chaos they create in press conferences and on social media is the same chaos they intend to spread through their rallies. True politicians engage in peaceful struggles, while those lacking political integrity resort to spreading panic and disorder under the guise of a struggle.” The information minister also said that the youth of Pakistan now see through the reality of the Adiala Jail prisoner and his so-called mentor. She expressed shock that those who have led vicious campaigns against political leaders and heads of institutions for over a year and a half now claim to be advocates of peace. “How can those who attacked over 200 military installations and burned the statues of martyrs speak of peace? The time has come to hold accountable every individual involved in the failed coup attempt of May 9th,” Bokhari emphasised.",

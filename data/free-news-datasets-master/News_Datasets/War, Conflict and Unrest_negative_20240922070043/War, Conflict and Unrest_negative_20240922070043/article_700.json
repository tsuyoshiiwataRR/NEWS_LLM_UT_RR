    "text": "Clashes between the army and paramilitary forces in northern Sudan rocked the capital Khartoum with explosions.\nAccording to Arab media reports, heavy shooting and explosions were heard in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum. The shooting happened near the Sudanese army headquarters and the office of the Ministry of Defense in Khartoum.\nAccording to media reports, gunshots were also heard near the presidential palace of Sudan in Khartoum and smoke was also seen rising from Khartoum Airport. Apart from this, firing sounds have also been heard in the cities of Marwi and Bahri in Sudan.\nSudan’s paramilitary rapid support forces say that one of our camps has been attacked by the Sudanese army.\nOn the other hand, the Sudanese army says that paramilitary rapid force personnel are trying to occupy the military headquarters.\nBrigadier General Nabil Abdullah, spokesman for the Sudanese army, says that paramilitary Rapid Force personnel have attacked military camps in Khartoum and other places.\nAccording to foreign media, cannons and armored vehicles have been deployed in various cities of Sudan after the tension.\nThe American ambassador in Sudan demanded the army and paramilitary forces to stop the clashes, saying that they have taken refuge in a place with the diplomatic staff, while the Russian embassy has also demanded a ceasefire from the parties.\nIt should be noted that the generals in Sudan have been in power through the Sovereign Council since October 2021 and the command of the Rapid Support Force is the Vice President of the Sovereign Council, General Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo, while the command of the army is entrusted to General Abdul Fatah Al-Barhan, who is also the head of the Council.\n#Tension #paramilitary #forces #army #Sudan #shootings #explosions #Khartoum\n2024-08-23 01:33:18",

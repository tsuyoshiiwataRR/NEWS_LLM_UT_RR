    "text": "A NATO airbase in western Germany on Thursday said it has raised its security to the second-highest level citing intelligence reports of a potential threat, [APA](https://apa.az) reports citing DW. \"We raised the security level at NATO Airbase Geilenkirchen based on intelligence information indicating potential threat,\" the base said in a post on social media platform X. \"All non-mission essential staff have been sent home as a precautionary measure,\" the base said in a statement on the social media platform X, without giving details. \"The safety of our staff is our top priority. Operations continue as planned.\" A spokesperson for the Geilenkirchen airbase said that the security levels have been raised to Charlie. As per NATO's definition, level Charlie means that there has been an incident or that there is evidence suggesting a high likelihood of terrorist action against the alliance. The authorities did not provide any details but assured there was no reason for concern and that security had been raised as a precautionary measure.",

    "text": "Satellite images of Russia's Marinovka air base attacked by drones emerge on internet Satellite images of the Marinovka air base in Russia's Volgograd Oblast, [attacked by drones of Ukraineâ€™s Security Service and Special Operations Forces](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/08/22/7471401/) on the night of 21-22 August, have emerged. Source: American OSINT researcher [MT Anderson](https://x.com/MT_Anderson/status/1826643666934661462) on Twitter with reference to satellite data Details: MT Anderson noted significant damage around the hangars and to the north of them. The images show destroyed hangars, but the extent of damage to the aircraft remains unclear. Updated: Photos from the Marinovka air base have appeared online, showing that there were aircraft in the hangars that were damaged due to the detonation of guided bombs and a fire at the fuel storage. [MT Anderson](https://x.com/MT_Anderson/status/1826643666934661462) believes that at least one Su-34 was destroyed and another was damaged in the hangars. Other hangars, which may have housed more aircraft, were also damaged. Background: Residents of the Russian town of Kalach-on-Don in Volgograd Oblast reported hearing the sounds of drones and explosions in the sky on the night of 21-22 August. The drones were allegedly targeting the [Marinovka air base](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/08/22/7471369/) near the city of Oktyabrsky.

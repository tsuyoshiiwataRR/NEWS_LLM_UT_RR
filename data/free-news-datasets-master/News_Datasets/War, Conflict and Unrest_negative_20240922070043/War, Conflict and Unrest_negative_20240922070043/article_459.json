    "text": "No charges filed against officers in fatal Magna shooting last November\nAug 22, 2024, 5:41 PM\n(Isaac Hale/Deseret News)\nMAGNA, Utah —\nSalt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill will not file any criminal charges against a group of nine police officers involved in a fatal Magna shooting in November. Gill said witness video showed the man pointing a handgun at officers.\nOn Nov. 15, 2023, officers responded just after midnight to calls of shots fired in a neighborhood in Magna.\nThey found a man firing off shots in his house and in the street.\nWhen officers responded, they tried to talk the man down, Gill said.\nHe said officers only started shooting after the man pointed his handgun in their direction.\n“They demonstrated incredible restraint. They knew that he had weapons and had calls for it, but he had not yet pointed it in a way where they would have felt directly threatened,” Gill said.\nAccording to Gill, just one officer let them interview him for this investigation. The investigation also used witness video that showed Joseph Dean Black pointing a gun at officers.\nThe video also showed the man’s daughter coming out of the house and trying to get his gun away from him at one point.\nBlack was declared dead at the scene of the Magna shooting.\nRelated:\nInvestigation open over claims of Salt Lake City police officers alleged misconduct with body\nWe want to hear from you.\nHave a story idea or tip?

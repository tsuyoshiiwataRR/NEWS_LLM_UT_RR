    "text": "2024-08-23 00:37:38\nArmenia is conscientiously involved in negotiations with Azerbaijan, RA Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan stated this in response to a question from a Croatian public television journalist about peace efforts.\nHe noted that Armenia is more than interested in establishing lasting peace in the region.\n“We are sure that this will be beneficial not only for the population of Armenia, but also for the states of the region. However, we see that our constructiveness is sometimes not reflected in the behavior of our neighbors. We have been involved in the negotiations, among others, with the support of the European Union, and currently we see that Azerbaijan, unfortunately, refuses to resume the negotiations on the existing platforms. However, we are interested in continuing the negotiations,” said Mirzoyan.\nAccording to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Armenia does not value so much who contributes to the negotiations, but rather the principles on the basis of which the negotiations should continue.\n“And in this context, I would like to emphasize again that they are territorial integrity, recognition and indivisibility of borders, mutual recognition of sovereignty. These are the principles on the basis of which, I think, an agreement on peace should be reached. Regarding the participation of Croatia or the EU in general, I would like to express our gratitude to Croatia and the EU in the context of border security in our region. I have already mentioned the EU monitoring mission, and I would also like to thank Croatia and the EU member states for their support in 2023. Ararat Mirzoyan stressed, “for the support shown in meeting the urgent needs of refugees who were forced to leave Nagorno-Karabakh as a result of military operations in September.”",

    "text": "Putin Alleges Ukrainian Assault on Kursk Nuclear Plant, Cites IAEA Notification Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukrainian forces of attempting to attack the Kursk Nuclear Power Station, notifying the IAEA of the incident. As Ukraine continues incursions into Russian territory, President Zelenskyy aims to end the conflict. Tensions escalate with dueling claims around nuclear plant attacks. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 23-08-2024 09:48 IST | Created: 23-08-2024 09:48 IST - Country: - Russia Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused Ukrainian forces of attempting an overnight attack on the Kursk Nuclear Power Station, Al Jazeera reported. While Putin informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of the alleged incident, he provided no supporting documentation. Ukraine has yet to respond to these allegations. In a televised meeting, Putin stated, 'The enemy tried to strike the nuclear power plant at night. The IAEA has been informed.' The accusation comes as Ukrainian forces continue their bold cross-border assault, which has been ongoing for over two weeks, aiming to end the conflict on terms favorable to Ukraine, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He reported that Ukrainian troops had taken control of another Russian settlement in the northern Sumy region and captured more prisoners of war. Following skirmishes approximately 30 kilometers from the Kursk nuclear plant, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi called for restraint on both sides. The plant houses four Soviet-era nuclear reactors, which remain 'stable,' according to regional governor Alexei Smirnov. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, both nations have accused each other of reckless attacks on nuclear installations. In 2022, the IAEA condemned Russia's temporary seizure of the Chornobyl power facility. Russia currently controls Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, with both sides trading accusations of dangerous military activities around nuclear sites. (With inputs from agencies.)

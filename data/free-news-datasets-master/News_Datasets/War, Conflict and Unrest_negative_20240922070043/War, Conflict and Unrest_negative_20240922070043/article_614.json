    "text": "Jeffrey D. Sachs says the U.N. should investigate the charges that Imran Khan and Sheik Hasina have leveled against Washington.\nMass victory rally on an elevated expressway in Dhaka, Bangladesh, after Sheikh Hasina’s resignation on Aug. 5. (Md Joni Hossain, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0)\nBy Jeffrey D. Sachs\nCommon Dreams\nT wo former leaders of major South Asian countries have reportedly accused the United States of covert regime change operations to topple their governments.\nOne of the leaders, former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, languishes in prison, on a perverse conviction that proves Khan’s assertion. The other leader, former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheik Hasina, fled to India following a violent coup in her country.\nTheir grave accusations against the U.S., as reported in the world media, should be investigated by the U.N., since if true, the U.S. actions would constitute a fundamental threat to world peace and to regional stability in South Asia.\nThe two cases seem to be very similar. The very strong evidence of the U.S. role in toppling the government of Imran Khan raises the likelihood that something similar may have occurred in Bangladesh.\nIn the case of Pakistan, Donald Lu, assistant secretary of state for South Asia and Central Asia, met with Asad Majeed Khan, Pakistan’s ambassador to the U.S., on March 7, 2022.\nAmbassador Khan immediately wrote back to his capital, conveying Lu’s warning that PM Khan threatened U.S.-Pakistan relations because of Khan’s “aggressively neutral position” regarding Russia and Ukraine.\n[Related: Craig Murray: The Silence on Imran Khan ]\nThe ambassador’s March 7 note (technically a diplomatic cypher) quoted Assistant Secretary Lu as follows:\n“I think if the no-confidence vote against the Prime Minister succeeds, all will be forgiven in Washington because the Russia visit is being looked at as a decision by the Prime Minister. Otherwise, I think it will be tough going ahead.”\nThe very next day, members of the parliament took procedural steps to oust PM Khan.\nKhan at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in June 2019. (Kremlin, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 4.0)\nOn March 27, PM Khan brandished the cypher, and told his followers and the public that the U.S. was out to bring him down. On April 10, PM Khan was thrown out of office as the Parliament acceded to the U.S. threat.\nWe know this in detail because of Ambassador Khan’s cypher, exposed by PM Khan and brilliantly documented by Ryan Grim of The Intercept , including the text of the cypher. Absurdly and tragically, PM Khan languishes in prison in part over espionage charges, linked to his revealing the cypher.\nBangladesh Coup\nThe U.S. appears to have played a similar role in the recent violent coup in Bangladesh. PM Hasina was ostensibly toppled by student unrest, and fled to India when the Bangladeshi military refused to prevent the protestors from storming the government offices. Yet there may well be much more to the story than meets the eye.\nAccording to press reports in India , PM Hasina is claiming that the U.S. brought her down.\nSpecifically, she says that the U.S. removed her from power because she refused to grant the U.S. military facilities in a region that is considered strategic for the U.S. in its “Indo-Pacific Strategy” to contain China.\nWhile these are second-hand accounts by the Indian media, they track closely several speeches and statements that Hasina has made over the past two years .\nOn May 17, the same Assistant Secretary Lu who played a lead role in toppling PM Khan, visited Dhaka to discuss the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy among other topics.\nDays later, Sheikh Hasina reportedly summoned the leaders of the 14 parties of her alliance to make the startling claim that a “country of white-skinned people” was trying to bring her down, ostensibly telling the leaders that she refused to compromise her nation’s sovereignty.\nLike Imran Khan, PM Hasina had been pursuing a foreign policy of neutrality, including constructive relations not only with the U.S. but also with China and Russia, much to the deep consternation of the U.S. government.\nSheik Hasina at the 2019 summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Baku. (President.az, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 4.0)\nTo add credence to Hasina’s charges, Bangladesh had delayed signing two military agreements that the U.S. had pushed very hard since 2022, indeed by none other than the former Under-Secretary of State Victoria Nuland , the neocon hardliner with her own storied history of U.S. regime-change operations.\nOne of the draft agreements, the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), would bind Bangladesh to closer military-to-military cooperation with Washington. The government of PM Hasina was clearly not enthusiastic to sign it.\nThe U.S. is by far the world’s leading practitioner of regime-change operations, yet the U.S. flatly denies its role in covert regime change operations even when caught red-handed, as with Nuland’s infamous intercepted phone call in late January 2014 planning the U.S.-led regime change operation in Ukraine.\nIt is useless to appeal to the U.S. Congress, and still less the executive branch, to investigate the claims by PM Khan and PM Hasina. Whatever the truth of the matter, they will deny and lie as necessary.\nUN Role\nU.N. staff and delegates at U.N. headquarters ahead of Security Council meeting on peacebuilding and sustaining peace in March. (UN Photo/Manuel Elías)\nThis is where the U.N. should step in. Covert regime change operations are blatantly illegal under international law (notably the Doctrine of Non-Intervention, as expressed for example in U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2625 , 1970), and constitute perhaps the greatest threat to world peace, as they profoundly destabilize nations, and often lead to wars and other civil disorders.\nThe U.N. should investigate and expose covert regime change operations, both in the interests of reversing them, and preventing them in the future.\nThe U.N. Security Council is of course specifically charged under Article 24 of the U.N. Charter with “primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.”\nWhen evidence arises that a government has been toppled through the intervention or complicity of a foreign government, the U.N. Security Council should investigate the claims.\nIn the cases of Pakistan and Bangladesh, the U.N. Security Council should seek the direct testimony of PM Khan and PM Hasina in order to evaluate the evidence that the U.S. played a role in the overthrow of the governments of these two leaders.\nEach, of course, should be protected by the U.N. for giving their testimony, so as to protect them from any retribution that could follow their honest presentation of the facts. Their testimony can be taken by video conference, if necessary, given the tragic ongoing incarceration of PM Khan.\nThe U.S. might well exercise its veto in the U.N. Security Council to prevent such a investigation. In that case, the U.N. General Assembly can take up the matter, under U.N. Resolution A/RES/76/ , which allows the U.N. General Assembly to consider an issue blocked by veto in the U.N. Security Council.\nThe issues at stake could then be assessed by the entire membership of the U.N.. The veracity of the U.S. involvement in the recent regime changes in Pakistan and Bangladesh could then be objectively analyzed and judged on the evidence, rather than on mere assertions and denials.\nThe U.S. engaged in at least 64 covert regime change operations during 1947-1989, according to documented research by Lindsey O’Rourke , political science professor at Boston Collage, and several more that were overt (e.g. by U.S.-led war).\nIt continues to engage in regime-change operations with shocking frequency to this day, toppling governments in all parts of the world.\nIt is wishful thinking that the U.S. will abide by international law on its own, but it is not wishful thinking for the world community, long suffering from U.S. regime change operations, to demand their end at the United Nations.\nJeffrey D. Sachs is a university professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, where he directed The Earth Institute from 2002 until 2016. He is also president of the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network and a commissioner of the U.N. Broadband Commission for Development.\nThis article is from Common Dreams .\nViews expressed in this article and may or may not reflect those of Consortium News.",

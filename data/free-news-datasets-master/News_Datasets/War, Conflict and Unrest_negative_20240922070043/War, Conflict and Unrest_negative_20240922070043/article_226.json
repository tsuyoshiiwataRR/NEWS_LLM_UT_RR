    "text": "Putin says Ukraine targeted Kursk nuclear plant Russian leader Vladimir Putin on Thursday said his country informed the International Atomic Energy Agency about an attack on the plant, Russian state media [reported](https://tass.com/politics/1832503). IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said he would visit the Kursk nuclear plant next week, Russia’s permanent representative to the United Nations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, [said](https://t.me/ulyanov_mikhail/3158) on Wednesday. Ukrainian forces earlier this month fought their way across the Russian border into the Kursk region. They’ve remained in the area ever since, fighting with the Russian troops. Does Ukraine have anything to say about the alleged attack on the nuclear plant? Ukraine did not comment publicly on the allegations that it attacked the Kursk nuclear power plant. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday said Kyiv’s forces in Kursk were holding their positions and thanked the troops involved for their service.

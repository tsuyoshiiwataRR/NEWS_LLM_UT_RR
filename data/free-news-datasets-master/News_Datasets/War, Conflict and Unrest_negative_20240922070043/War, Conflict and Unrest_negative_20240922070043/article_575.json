    "text": "On Thursday, Day 321 of the ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli army intensified the bombing and shelling of various parts of the coastal enclave, killing and wounding dozens of Palestinians. The army fired barrages of missiles and shells at homes, schools, UNRWA facilities, and buildings where families sheltered, amidst an escalating humanitarian crisis affecting the lives of more than 1.7 million displaced Palestinians in Gaza. | Day 321: Continuous Bombing On Gaza Causes Dozens Of Casualties | Four Palestinians, including a child, were killed, and many were injured when the army fired missiles at displaced Palestinians and a warehouse where families sheltered in the Gaza Strip.

(@SuppressedNws) [August 22, 2024] Medical sources at the Nasser Medical Center in Khan Younis, in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, said three Palestinians, including a child, were killed, and many were injured when the army fired missiles at Palestinians in Abasan town, east of Khan Younis. Furthermore, medical sources said several Palestinians were killed and injured by Israeli missiles near Qdeih graveyard in Abasan town.

The sources added that one Palestinian was killed, and several others were injured, in another attack against displaced Palestinians, east of the Zeitoun neighborhood, in Gaza City. Furthermore, the army fired a missile at a shed where displaced Palestinians tried to shelter in the Nusseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza, causing many injuries. At least one Palestinian was killed and several others injured, when the army fired artillery shells at the Al-Mufti area, north of Nusseirat refugee camp.

In northern Gaza, the army fired a missile at a home in the Shaima area in Beit Lahia, wounding several Palestinians, including children and women. The Palestinian Civil Defense in Gaza said the Israeli army continues to refuse to allow its medics and rescue teams to search under the rubble of the bombarded home for the Abu Hadrous family since Wednesday and affirmed that sixteen Palestinians remain under the rubble. It added that it contacted the office of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, regarding the Abu Hadrous family, but ‚Äúthey failed to act despite all appeals.‚Äù On its part, the Israeli army said, on Thursday evening, that one soldier was killed in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, bringing the number of soldiers and officers, killed since October 7, 2023, to 695. UN United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, said on her X account ‚ÄúUnder the guise of #ceasefire negotiations, Israel is trying to create the conditions for permanent occupation and more land grab,‚Äù and added, ‚ÄúThose familiar with Palestine‚Äôs history recognize in what is happening to the Palestinians under Israel‚Äôs unlawful occupation, the pattern of settler colonialism.‚Äù History repeats itself: Israel using negotiations to eat up other portions of what remains of Palestine Under the guise of ‚Äú [#ceasefire]negotiations‚Äù Israel is trying to create the conditions for permanent occupation and more land grab. Those familiar with [#Palestine]‚Äôs history‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Francesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur oPt (@FranceskAlbs) [August 22, 2024] Albanese was commenting on Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, insistence that Israel maintains control of the ‚ÄúPhiladelphi‚Äù and ‚ÄúNetzarim‚Äù corridors, which would ensure Israel splits and fragments the coastal enclave, an issue that remains one of the main obstacles that indirect ceasefire talks are facing. In related news, UNRWA said that the Israeli army forcefully displaced 250,000 Palestinians, yet again, as it continues the war on Gaza. ‚ÄúSo far in August, the Israeli authorities issued 12 evacuation orders affecting around 250,000 people in Gaza,‚Äù UNRWA said on X platform, ‚ÄúFamilies are repeatedly displaced, carrying what they can amid military operations and summer heat.

In a post on X social media platform, the Commission said that there is currently no safe place within the Gaza Strip and added that the displaced Palestinians in Gaza remain confined to an area that constitutes only one-tenth of the Gaza Strip‚Äôs total space. The Palestinian Health Ministry said Israel has committed four massacres of families in the Gaza Strip in 24 hours, killing at least 42 Palestinians and injuring 163, largely children and women, across the coastal enclave. Israel has now killed at least 40.265 and injured more than 93.144, mostly children, women, and elderly, in addition to the thousands of missing Palestinians, mostly under the rubble of bombarded homes and buildings, on destroyed streets and in bombarded alleys across the Gaza Strip, since October 7, 2023.",

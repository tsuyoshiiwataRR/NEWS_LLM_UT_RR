    "text": "Global Security on the Brink: US Prepares for Potential Conflicts A bipartisan Congressional committee warns that the winner of the upcoming U.S. presidential election will face the most challenging strategic situation since 1945, with the potential for simultaneous wars with China, Russia, and others. The committee calls for extensive Pentagon reforms and increased defense resources. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 23-08-2024 06:30 IST | Created: 23-08-2024 06:30 IST A bipartisan Congressional committee has sounded the alarm: the next U.S. president will inherit the most perilous strategic situation since 1945, according to a recent report. The Commission on U.S. National Defense Strategy, established by Congress in 2022, cautions against the possibility of simultaneous wars with major powers like China and Russia. The U.S., the report declares, is not adequately prepared for such scenarios. The committee, led by former Congresswoman Jane Harman, Eric Edelman, and retired General John M. Keane, urges sweeping reforms in both the Pentagon and broader governmental structures. It also calls for increased defense resources and a national conversation about these looming threats.

    "text": "\"Shoot me!!!\" In an instant the gunman is turning her way, though is gun is still trained on Danny, his body partially slumped over from when he had been struck in the stomach. \"If you want to shoot anyone shoot me please!!!\" Her voice is desperate and tears are falling freely down her face. \"Don't hurt my Husband, please!!! Just shoot me!!!\" From where he is still trying to get up Danny can see his Wife, her eyes filled with tears as she begs for the gunman to spare him, doing absolutely anything that she can to make sure that he makes it out alive. Even at the cost of her own life. \"I won't be mad I promise, please just shoot me!!!\" The change was swift and the act was instantaneous and as the gunshot echoed loudly through the night gripped air a primal scream ripped its way up Danny's throat as he watched the love of his life collapse onto the rain wet asphalt beneath her. He was gone, seemingly faster than an eye blink but Danny didn't care, all he could focus on was his fallen Wife, his form staggering forward as he struggled to move fast enough, his hands immediately pressing down on the bullet hole that had been made, the feeling of warm blood staining the underbelly of his hands making his heart twist and revolt against his chest. Danny was still kneeling by her side when the paramedics arrived, the memory of dialing 911 and pleading for help passing vaguely though his mind and as his Wife is wheeled away and placed in the back of the ambulance Danny is left standing alone, covered in his Wife's blood and the reality of what she had done slowly but surely beginning to hit him. The ride to the hospital is completely silent and as Joe finally parks the squad car Danny gets out without a word, the shock finally settling fully into his body and now he can't seem to register much. Numbly Danny makes his way across the hospital's parking lot and towards the main entrance his father and sister waiting for him just inside the entrance lobby. \"She's in surgery.\" The first words that Danny actually takes notice of and his head snaps up and he seems to see for the very first time. \"The doctor says that they got her in just in time.\" Danny instinctively winces when he clenches his jaw to tight, a wave of shock cutting through his jaw. \"Let's head inside son, we've got a while to wait.\" Danny hasn't moved in hours, his back is screaming profanities at him for remaining in the same position for so long and he is sure if he were able to the skin from his fingers would be rubbed off with how excessively he has been ringing them. \"Mr. Reagan?\" At the sound of his surname Danny is on his feet, his head snapping to his right, the sight of a nurse dressed in theater scrubs making her approach resulting in his heart lodging firmly within his throat. \"Mr. Reagan, the surgery went well and we were able to remove the bullet from your wife without any issue, she is being rolled into recovery now if you would like to see her.\" Unable to bring himself to say a word all Danny does is nod his head and in less than a heartbeat he is following the nurse out of the waiting area and down the hallway. Silently Danny sits beside his Wife's bed, his gaze fixed on his hands as several quiet tears drip off his lashes and hit the back of his hands. As much as he wants to say something Danny can't find the strength to speak and so he just sits, trying desperately not to completely lose composure as he waits for his wife to wake up. A sound, far less than even a whine of discomfort enters the air and Danny's eyes are snapping upward and to his Wife's excessively pale face. He leans forward just a bit, his expression quietly contorted into one of immense pain. \"Hey there beautiful.\" he finds himself almost whimpering out when Amelia's eyes finally manage to roll open, his left hand fingers gingerly brushing across her sweat dampened hairline. Danny attempts a smile but it ends up dying almost instantly as the weight of his pain presses ever so tightly upon the corners of his eyes. He leans forward and with trembling lips presses a small kiss into his Wife's forehead. A soft glow emits from the hospital rooms bedside lamp as I sit quietly in my bed, Danny seated in the chair next to me his right hand holding gently to my left. With his shoulders hunched over and a look of deeply set torment upon his face I can feel my stomach twist and lurch within me as my gaze silently observes his profile. I gently squeeze his hand and he looks over at me. Hurt and afraid, these are the two emotions that I can pick out instantly, and as I lightly squeeze my Danny's hand again his voice drifts into the air. Tone weak and terrified. \"Why did you do it?\" Danny knows why I did what I did, he heard me, he saw me, he knows why, but I know too that he is hoping for an answer other than the one I will give him. Again I squeeze Danny's hand, though this time I lean over and press a tiny kiss into his mouth. \"Because you're my Husband and I love you.\" The anguish written into my Husband's features darkens In color as the words I have just spoke hang within the air and as tears quiet and fresh proceed to fall down my Husband's face I gently place my right hand on the back of his neck, draw him and repeatedly kiss the side of his head as he weeps into the curve of my neck. With Amelia fast asleep in her hospital bed, her left hand still holding his right Danny uses his other to tightly pinch the corners of his eyes. He feels the need to break down but he doesn't want to wake up his Wife, she has already been through enough and he wants her to rest. His emotions however have other plans and though he does his best to stay quiet, deep, hollow cries erupt from deep within his chest and easily break passed the confinements of his teeth. He didn't want to wake her, that is the last thing he wanted to do yet the moment he feels himself being drawn gently inward he knows that he has failed. She is kissing his head and lovingly rubbing his side, her voice soothing as attempts to help ease his pain. This only makes him cry harder and as Danny Reagan once again finds himself weeping into the crook of his Wife's neck there is only one that seems to remain alive within his mind. Almost losing her will forever be a muscle memory. ~ end",

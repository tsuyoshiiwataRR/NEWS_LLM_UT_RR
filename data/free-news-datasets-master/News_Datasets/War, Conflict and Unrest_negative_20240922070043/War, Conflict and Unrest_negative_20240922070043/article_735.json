    "text": "TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Ministry of National Defense (MND) tracked 41 Chinese military aircraft and seven naval vessels around Taiwan between 6 a.m. on Thursday (Aug. 22) and 6 a.m. on Friday. Of the 41 People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft, 32 crossed the Taiwan Strait median line in the country’s northern, southwestern, and eastern air defense identification zone (ADIZ), according to the [MND](https://www.mnd.gov.tw/NewUpload/202408/1130823_%E8%87%BA%E6%B5%B7%E5%91%A8%E9%82%8A%E6%B5%B7%E3%80%81%E7%A9%BA%E5%9F%9F%E6%B4%BB%E5%8B%95_155929.jpg). In response, Taiwan sent aircraft and naval ships and deployed coastal-based missile systems to monitor the PLA activity. So far this month, Taiwan has tracked PLA aircraft 359 times and Chinese ships 206 times. Since September 2020, China has increased its use of gray zone tactics by incrementally increasing the number of military aircraft and naval vessels operating around Taiwan. Gray zone tactics are [defined](https://www.csis.org/analysis/new-perspectives-foreign-policy-issue-18) as “an effort or series of efforts beyond steady-state deterrence and assurance that attempts to achieve one’s security objectives without resort to direct and sizable use of force.”",

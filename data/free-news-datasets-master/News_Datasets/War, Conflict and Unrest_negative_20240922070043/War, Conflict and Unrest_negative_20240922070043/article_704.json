    "text": "The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, declared this Thursday that the Ukrainian Armed Forces tried to attack the Kursk nuclear power plant, on Russian territory.\n“The enemy tried to attack the [Kursk] nuclear power plant today at night,” declared the president during a meeting on the situation in the Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk provinces in which the heads of these regions and senior officials from various regions participated. areas.\nIn this context, Putin indicated that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was informed about these attempts. “They promise to come personally, send specialists to evaluate the situation. I hope they finally do this,” he stated.\nLast week, the Russian Foreign Ministry denounced the kyiv regime’s preparations for an attack against the nuclear power plant in question. “We call on international organizations, especially the UN and the International Atomic Energy Agency, to immediately condemn the provocative actions being prepared by the Kiev regime and prevent a violation of the nuclear and physical security of the nuclear power plant in Kursk, which could cause a large-scale catastrophe in Europe,” urged Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zajárova.\nFor his part, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, announced that he will visit the plant next week. Grossi stressed that he is “very concerned” about the situation and takes “very seriously” the risk that the facility could be damaged, noting that it is “technically within range of Ukrainian artillery.”\nA harsh response The Russian Defense Ministry “evaluates with due seriousness the information from independent channels about the Kiev regime’s preparations to attack the Kursk nuclear power plant,” the organization said in a statement this Saturday.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry referred to recent reports that the Ukrainian Armed Forces were preparing a nuclear provocation. According to war correspondent Marat Jairulin, there is “a high probability” of attacks on the Russian nuclear power plants in Kursk and Zaporozhie.\n“The objective of this provocation is to accuse the Russian Federation of ‘self-attack’ on its plants in order to create reasons to attack nuclear facilities in Ukraine,” the ministry explained. He added that “such actions of the Kiev regime, supported by its Western sponsors, constitute a direct and clear violation of the international convention adopted by the United Nations General Assembly resolution of April 13, 2005 on combating acts of nuclear terrorism.”\nIn this sense, the entity concluded that “in the event that the Kiev regime begins to implement its criminal plans aimed at creating a catastrophe” of radioactive contamination of vast territories of the continent, Moscow will “immediately adopt military and military-technical response measures.” severe.”\n#Putin #denounces #Ukraine #attack #Kursk #nuclear #power #plant\n2024-08-23 01:02:13",

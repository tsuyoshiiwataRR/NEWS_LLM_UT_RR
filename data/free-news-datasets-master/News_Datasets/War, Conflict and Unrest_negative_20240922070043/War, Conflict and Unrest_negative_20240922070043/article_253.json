    "text": "Don't miss a moment of the 2024 Tour de France! Get recaps, insights, and exclusive takes with Velo's daily newsletter.\nSign up today!.\n“What happened today was not the strategy that we had in mind at the start of the stage.”\nThat’s the admission of Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe sport director Patxi Vila after\nBen O’Connor’s stunning smash-and-grab at the Vuelta a España Thursday.\nVuelta leader Primož Roglič may have been willing to relinquishing the red jersey temporarily, but what O’Connor achieved was something very different.\nHe wasn’t a lesser rider buried in the overall classification being allowed to borrow the race lead for a few days.\nInstead, the Australia was a proven, fully-fledged GC rival who wrested the jersey off Roglič’s back.\n“We had an important rider up the road for us and we felt like that we had an another option in the GC,” Vila said, referring to Florian Lipowitz.\n“What O’Connor did was incredible. The other teams pulled, with Movistar and others, but what he did on the final climb, to take time on everyone after being in the breakaway, that is a little bit of a surprise.”\nO’Connor put in one of the best performances of his career, and it left the peloton wondering what had happened in his wake.\nThe Australian made his move from the day’s big break on the Puerto del Vento climb inside the final 65km. He initially worked with Gijs Leemreize (Team DSM-Firmenich PostNL) to build a gap, then cast off the Dutchman with 28k remaining.\nHe then stomped to the third grand tour stage win of his career, finishing 4:33 ahead of runner-up Marco Frigo (Israel-Premier Tech), and turned the Vuelta upside down.\nRoglič and many of the other GC contenders trailed in a distant, dismayed 6:31 down.\n“We know that Ben O’Connor is one of the best riders in the world. Today he was unbeatable,” said UAE Team Emirates sports director Joxean Fernández Matxin.\n“He was better than everyone. There was nothing to do. We were pulling, with Movistar, Red Bull, Lidl-Trek, Bahrain. We gave everything and he still took time on us all alone.”\n‘Maybe they underestimated me’\nO’Connor’s audacious move evokes memories of other such raids in the past.\nThink Claudio Chiappucci in the 1990 Tour de France, a breakaway which almost saw the Italian triumph over Greg LeMond.\nThink Oscar Pereiro in the 2006 Tour, a huge breakaway time gain which earned him the yellow jersey and, eventually, the Tour win.\nBut O’Connor is different.\nHe is a far more accomplished rider than either Chiappucci or Pereiro were at the time.\nHe won a stage of the Giro d’Italia in 2020, and took a stage of the Tour de France one year later.\nHe’s finished fourth in both the Giro and Tour in the past. He’s a big rider who is firmly on the radar of the other GC contenders and all the big teams.\nThere was nothing “lucky” about what he did, no anonymity to give him additional leeway.\nHe started this race as one of the favorites who could win overall. He’s now moved a huge leap closer to that goal.\n“Maybe they underestimated me,” O’Connor said. “I’ve been fourth in Tour and I was fourth in the Giro just gone. So it’s not like I’ve done nothing in races.”\nO’Connor needed a few days to get up to speed. He had an off day on Tuesday’s stage four due to the heat, losing time. That plus a subdued opening time trial saw him start Thursday’s stage 1:56 back.\nBut he slammed fully into top gear Thursday, hitting his potential with a vengeance.\nAs a result of his exploit, he is now a significant 4:51 ahead of Roglič. He’s a further eight seconds ahead of João Almeida (UAE Team Emirates), who is nervous about what happened.\n“Of course, we are worried about him,” he said. “He’s not just any rider. He took a five or six minutes out of everyone, but at least we still have more than two weeks left of this Vuelta.\n“It’s gonna be really hard to tip back those five or six minutes that he took today.”\nDid the rival teams mess it up? By the time they realized how far he was up the road, it was too late.\nCounting the cost of a major miscalculation\nThe coming days may reveal a little about O’Connor’s prospects of wearing the red jersey in Madrid in just over two weeks’ time.\nSaturday’s and Sunday’s stages are not in the high mountains but may still run the rule over each of the GC riders.\n“We’ll find out once we get to Cazorla and Granada,” O’Connor said. “And pretty much every single day after that. It’s an interesting race, and I guess it’s been turned a little bit into a different card than everyone thought.\n“It will be for some good watching on TV.”\nThat’s certainly true.\nFor now the rival teams will be wondering if giving O’Connor any leeway Thursday will prove to be a very serious miscalculation.\n“It’s always like that; when you know the results, after you know what you should’ve done,” said Matxin.\n“Adam Yates crashed at a critical moment for us [with about 20km to go] and that’s we could not pull then. You can always try to make the best of the situation, but when he takes seven minutes out of the entire peloton there’s nothing else to say.\n“Red Bull had their plan to let the breakaway go, and when we all saw that O’Connor had so much time everyone started to work. But when one is stronger than everyone else, there’s no one you can criticize or say they should’ve done something else.”\nRed Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe DS Vila similarly accepts that things didn’t turn out as planned.\n“The idea was to keep Lipowitz up there to see if he can hang on and move up in the GC, and also that we wouldn’t have to work.\n“We wouldn’t like it if one of our rival teams put another rider up on the GC. And of course, the idea was to make our rivals work today, like Movistar or UAE, which they did.\n“But what happened was O’Connor went a little bit beyond what anyone expected. To get back the time we’ll have to go little by little. There is still a lot of the race ahead of us.”\nBut he, Roglič, Almeida and others could still have some sleepless nights ahead.\n“Of course, we are worried about him. He’s not just any rider,” Almeida said. “And he took a five or six minutes out of everyone, but at least we still have more than two weeks left of this Vuelta. It’s gonna be really hard to tip back those minutes that he took today.\n“It was another hard stage very fast very hot, the key to recover. Of course we would’ve liked to have one of our riders up the road, but the break went away at an unexpected moment,” Almeida said.\nThe day was full of surprises, and Maxtin articulated the problem well.\nIt’d be one thing if bad tactics explained in full what happened, but it was more than that.\n“Five teams pulling, and he took time on all of us.”",

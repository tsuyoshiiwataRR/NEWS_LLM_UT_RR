    "text": "The EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell has said that Vladimir Putin has been hit with a “severe blow” following Ukraine’s incursion into the Kursk region. Borrell has called for restrictions to be lifted to allow Ukrainian armed forces to use long-range Western weapons inside Russia. Borrell wrote on X that Ukraine’s invasion is “a severe blow to Russian President Putin’s narrative.” He then said the West should be “lifting restrictions on the use of capabilities vs the Russian military involved in aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international law.” Read more related news: [Russia files ‘criminal charges’ against CNN reporter who entered Kursk ‘illegally’](https://londonlovesbusiness.com/russia-files-criminal-charges-against-cnn-reporter-who-entered-kursk-illegally/) [Russian intelligence claims to have exposed NATO’s role in attacking the Kursk region](https://londonlovesbusiness.com/russian-intelligence-claims-to-have-exposed-natos-role-in-attacking-the-kursk-region/) [Kyiv never told the West of Kursk incursion over their fears of crossing Putin’s nuclear ‘red lines’](https://londonlovesbusiness.com/kyiv-never-told-the-west-of-kursk-incursion-over-their-fears-of-crossing-putins-nuclear-red-lines/) [Ukraine launches a massive hack on Russian TV to ‘expose the reality of the war’ to its citizens] Borrell said that this would then “strengthen Ukrainian self-defence by ending Russia’s sanctuary for its attacks,” this will save lives and stop Moscow dead in their tracks. Russia has also been accusing NATO of being on the ground in Kursk along with mercenaries who are actively participating in Ukraine’s incursion. Apty Alaudinov, Akhmat commander and deputy chief of the Russian Armed Forces’said he suspects there could be active-duty service members from NATO who are serving as mercenaries in the Kursk region. The commander told Rossiya-1 television, “You must understand that they have thrown together a ragtag army. And they have deployed as many foreign mercenaries as they could to there. “I guess there are people among these foreign mercenaries who are in the military of the NATO bloc.”",

    "text": "The leader of the Chavista regime in Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. EFE/ Henry Chirinos The president of Venezuela , Nicolas Maduro declared two female Chavista militants “martyrs” on Monday, “murdered” after the elections of July 28, of which the president accused – without showing evidence – the leaders of the majority opposition, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia y Maria Corina Machado .\n“I ask for the most sublime tributes for them as martyrs of this anti-fascist revolution” said the head of state in a meeting with the ruler United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) broadcast by the state channel VTV.\nMaduro claimed that both women were murdered “by the commandos” – political organization groups of the campaign of the largest opposition coalition, the Democratic Unitary Platform (PUD) – of «Fascist Maria Machado and the cowardly criminal Edmundo Gonzalez» and noted that “all the intellectual and material authors have been captured.”\nThe Chavista leader, who was declared the winner of the presidential election based on results that are still unknown in detail, said that these were crimes of “fascism” by both opponents, for whom he recently requested jail time for alleged “criminal” actions after the elections, in which the PUD claims that its candidate won.\nMaduro, who reiterated that two soldiers were also killed, assured that the Bolivarian National Guard ( GNB militarized police), the Bolivarian National Police (PNB) and some regional security forces “saved hundreds of citizens” from the claws of the fascists.\nCARACAS (VENEZUELA), 08/17/2024.- Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado (right) waves the Venezuelan flag in front of supporters this Saturday, in Caracas (Venezuela). Machado reappeared in public to participate in the rally against the official result of the presidential elections that – she claims – was won by the standard-bearer of the largest opposition coalition, Edmundo González Urrutia, despite the fact that the National Electoral Council (CNE) awarded the victory to Nicolás Maduro. EFE/ Miguel Gutiérrez According to official figures, more than 2,400 people were arrested during the post-election protests – some of which resulted in violence – and 25 deaths, which the Prosecutor’s Office attributes to “criminal groups instrumentalized” by the “comanditos.”\nThe majority of anti-Chavez supporters have called for the release of those arrested for protesting against the official election results and for “the persecution to cease.”\nLast week, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk denounced “the high and continuous number of arbitrary arrests” and the “disproportionate use” of force reported after the protests, an assertion that the Government rejected.

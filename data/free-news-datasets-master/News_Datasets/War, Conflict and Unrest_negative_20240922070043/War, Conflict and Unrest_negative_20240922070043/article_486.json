    "text": "Sen. [J.D. Vance](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/jd-vance/) (R-OH) urged the Left to soften its rhetoric around former President Donald Trump at the [Democratic National Convention](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/dnc/), as he worried “crazy people are going to take actions into their own hands.” Speaking to reporters in North Carolina on Wednesday, Vance reflected on Trump’s near brush with death last month and said even “Democrats recognize that when you say that the guy is an existential threat to American democracy, sometimes that means crazy people are going to take actions into their own hands.” However, Trump’s running mate expressed concern that while polarizing rhetoric had dropped “a little bit” in the wake of the assassination attempt on the former president, Democrats are “trying to ramp the rhetoric back up” at this week’s DNC in Chicago. The Ohio senator urged “my Democratic friends to maybe pump the brakes a little bit on the apocalyptic rhetoric around Donald Trump.” “I hope that they remember when you tell the American people that this guy must be stopped at all costs, most people are going to respond to that reasonably, some people are going to take crazy actions and take matters into their own hands,” Vance said. In his remark to the press, Vance specifically mentioned concerns over speakers from the second night of the high-profile Democratic event. Top Democrats from across the country took to the stage on Tuesday as they warned voters about the dangers of another Trump term. Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D-IL) [ called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lvwm3VRPSdg) the former president “dangerous” as he told attendees that “Trump chooses cruelty,” and John Giles, an Arizona mayor, worried that under Trump, the Republican Party had been “kidnapped by extremists.” Meanwhile, Angela Alsobrooks, who is making a bid for a Maryland Senate seat, told the DNC she was “frozen in fear” that “this one man and his extremist MAGA movement” could once again “come to power.” Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) also worried Trump was trying to “take away my rights and freedoms” and warned that Republicans will “prosecute doctors and they will shame and spy on women.” The night before, Rep. Jamie Raskin’s (D-MD) speech to DNC attendees attracted fire when he issued a dire warning to Vance. “J.D. Vance, do you understand why there was a sudden job opening for running mate on the GOP ticket? They tried to kill your predecessor!” Raskin said as he referenced the Jan. 6 protest at the Capitol where he claimed people chanted “hang Mike Pence,” who was Trump’s vice president at the time. [CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/) “They tried to kill him because he would not follow Trump’s plan to destroy and nullify the votes of millions of Americans,” Raskin continued. The Trump campaign slammed Raskin for being “willing to politicize talking about assassinations just one month” after Trump survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally.",

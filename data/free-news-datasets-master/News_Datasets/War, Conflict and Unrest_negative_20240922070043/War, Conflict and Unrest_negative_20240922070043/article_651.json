    "text": "SANAA - Yemen's armed Houthi group on Thursday claimed responsibility for launching attacks against two ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. \"In support of Palestinians in Gaza and in response to American-British aggression against our country, we carried out two military operations in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden,\" Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in a statement aired by Houthi-run al-Masirah TV.

It was directly and accurately hit while sailing in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea,\" he added. According to the UK Maritime Trade Operations, MV Sounion, a Greek-flagged oil tanker, and SW North Wind I, a Panama-flagged commercial vessel, were both attacked on Wednesday. The UK Maritime Trade Operations also confirmed that MV Sounion, which was hit multiple times, has lost engine power and all crew members have been rescued.

The mission urged vessels in the area to \"exercise caution and avoid actions that could worsen the situation.\" SW North Wind I, a 15-year-old bulk carrier, was navigating the southern Red Sea when the attack occurred. The ship sustained damage to its hull from the strike, but all crew members were unharmed, according to a Yemeni coast guard official. The attacks come amid ongoing regional tensions.

This intervention has led the Houthis to expand their targets to include US and British commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

    "text": "The former head of Israeli military intelligence has apologized for the failure on October 7 last year. He bears “the ultimate responsibility for the failure of the intelligence department,” said Aharon Chaliva when handing over the reins to his successor, Schlomi Binder. “Those who march at the top” are expected to take responsibility, said Chaliva. In recent months, the military intelligence service has thoroughly investigated how the bloody terrorist attack by Hamas, which left around 1,200 people dead, came about. This process will enable Israel to face the challenges that are still to come. He warned in this context of an expansion of the Gaza war to the region. “For the security of Israel, for the people of Israel and for future generations, a state commission of inquiry should also be established,” demanded Chaliva. The aim must be to examine in detail the reasons for the war and to ensure “that what happened to us is not repeated.”\nHis successor Binder said the events of October 7 “and the unbearable price we had to pay will stay with me forever.”",

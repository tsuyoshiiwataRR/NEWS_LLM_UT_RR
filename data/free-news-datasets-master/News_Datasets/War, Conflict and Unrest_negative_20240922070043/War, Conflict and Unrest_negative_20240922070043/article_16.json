    "text": "The Russian Black Sea Fleet wants to avoid an attack by sea drones According to the latest reports from Defence-Ua, the Russian Black Sea Fleet has relocated its main base from occupied Sevastopol to Novorossiysk. This location change has a significant reason. The latest satellite images, published by OSINT expert MT Anderson, reveal that most of the Russian fleet&#039;s valuable equipment in the Black Sea is currently situated in Novorossiysk. This relocation is an attempt to avoid attacks by Ukrainian maritime drones, which forced Russia to use barges to secure the entrance to the new base. It turns out this is not Russia&#039;s only problem. Novorossiysk - the new base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet At the new location, all operational Russian submarines in the Black Sea are stationed, including the B-871 &quot;Alrosa&quot; of Project 877V &quot;Paltus&quot; and three units of &quot;Varshavyanka&quot; - B-265 &quot;Krasnodar&quot;, B-268 &quot;Veliky Novgorod&quot;, and B-271 &quot;Kolpino&quot;. Besides submarines, the list of stationed units includes two new missile frigates of Project 11356P, &quot;Admiral Essen&quot; and &quot;Admiral Makarov,&quot; old sea guards of Project 1135, &quot;Burevestnik&quot; - &quot;Ladny&quot; and &quot;Pytlivy,&quot; six large amphibious ships, including four from Project 775, and all three patrol vessels of Project 22160. It should be noted that in recent days, the Russian fleet has been rendered powerless. Neglect and tragedy: The Kursk submarine disaster revisited Is the Russian fleet unable to continue fighting? In addition to more modern units, older Soviet-era units are also stationed in Novorossiysk, including two small missile ships of Project 1239 &quot;Bora&quot; and &quot;Samum.&quot; Interestingly, although the hostile forces have four small missile ships of the &quot;Buyan-M&quot; type capable of carrying &quot;Kalibr&quot; missiles, currently, only one such ship is in Novorossiysk. At the same time, the rest do not risk going out to sea.

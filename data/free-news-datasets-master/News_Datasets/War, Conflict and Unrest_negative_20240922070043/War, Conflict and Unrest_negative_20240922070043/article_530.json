    "text": "Russia is “preparing” for what could be a massive missile attack on Ukraine around Independence Day. The US embassy in Kyiv has also warned there is a ‘heightened risk” of Russian attacks ahead of Ukraine’s Independence Day on 24 August. Vladimir Putin has been stockpiling missiles and “training flights” using nuclear capable long-range bombers is being conducted in preparation for what could be a full-scale attack across Ukraine. Speaking to RBC-Ukraine, Oleksandr Musiienko, the Head of the Сenter of Military Law Researches warned, “Risks (of a strike around Independence Day) exist. They cannot be ignored. There are signs that Russia is preparing for an attack.” Read more related news: [Russia files ‘criminal charges’ against CNN reporter who entered Kursk ‘illegally’](https://londonlovesbusiness.com/russia-files-criminal-charges-against-cnn-reporter-who-entered-kursk-illegally/) [Kyiv never told the West of Kursk incursion over their fears of crossing Putin’s nuclear ‘red lines’](https://londonlovesbusiness.com/kyiv-never-told-the-west-of-kursk-incursion-over-their-fears-of-crossing-putins-nuclear-red-lines/) [Ukraine launches a massive hack on Russian TV to ‘expose the reality of the war’ to its citizens ](https://londonlovesbusiness.com/ukraine-launches-a-massive-hack-on-russian-tv-to-expose-the-reality-of-the-war-to-its-citizens/) [Putin’s ‘narrative’ has been dealt a ‘severe blow’ with Ukraine’s Kursk incursion] The US embassy warned of an “increased risk” of air attacks from Russia over the coming days. In a statement the US embassy “assesses that during the next several days and through the weekend there is an increased risk of both nighttime and daytime Russian drone and missile attacks throughout Ukraine in connection with Ukraine’s Independence Day on August 24.” An aviation expert has also told RBC-Ukraine that Putin’s forces are likely preparing and training for a massive attack on Ukraine. Russian Tu-95s which are strategic long-range bombers which NATO calls “Bears” is “conducting false launches” and the Tu-160 which the alliance calls “Blackjack’s” is also operational. The nuclear capable bombers are conducting pilot training and Russian forces are “setting up decoy targets.” Musiienko told RBC-Ukraine, “Training flights are being conducted, and stockpiles are being prepared. “So the enemy generally can carry out such an attack. A certain period has passed, and the missile stockpile they may have accumulated could amount to around 100 missiles. I mean those ready for use, which could be equipped.” He said that Russia has a track record of launching strikes either on or before key dates in Ukraine. He added, “But of course, this period is somewhat risky. This needs to be understood because certain factors coincide that may indicate the warnings from the U.S. are not just a formality.” Aviation expert Kostiantyn Kryvolap said, “It’s hard to say if there are any concrete signs, but it’s almost clear that something is happening and they are preparing for something.” He added, “Instead, they are flying, training, conducting false launches, and setting up decoy targets. There’s also an additional Tu-160,” noted the expert.”",

    "text": "Gavin Newsom spent over a year positioning himself as a potential successor Newsom has been relegated to doing interviews as a surrogate for Harris READ MORE: Democrats hope Gavin Newsom can replace Biden - but do they know about the sleazy California Governor&#039;s infidelities, addiction, TEENAGE lover... and why allies say he &#039;doesn&#039;t have real friends&#039;? With Kamala Harris set to accept the Democrat nomination for president Thursday night, many wonder what happened to the other California liberal many thought may take Joe Biden&#039;s place. Gavin Newsom, the two-term governor of the Golden State, spent over a year positioning himself as a potential successor to Biden, even posturing enough to go through with a debate against Ron DeSantis on Fox News. Instead, this week, Newsom has been relegated to doing interviews as a surrogate and announcing the nomination of Harris on behalf of his state&#039;s delegates. Newsom has not even had a devoted speaking slot at a convention that&#039;s included everyone from Oprah Winfrey to Ana Navarro. However, those close to him suggest that there&#039;s still a bright future ahead for the governor, despite being term-limited out and two younger Democrats holding the state&#039;s US Senate seats. With Kamala Harris set to accept the Democrat nomination for president Thursday night, many wonder what happened to Gavin Newsom (pictured left), the other California liberal many thought may take Joe Biden&#039;s place Newsom has been relegated to doing interviews as a surrogate and announcing the nomination of Harris on behalf of his state&#039;s delegates &#039;Ridiculous,&#039; Newsom spokesman Nathan Click told the Sacramento Bee if his boss&#039; star had dimmed. &#039;He&#039;s excited about the ticket and he&#039;s gonna be hitting the road just like he&#039;s been doing before. He&#039;s focused on defeating Donald Trump in 2024.&#039; Newsom and Vice President Kamala Harris both rose to political power coming through the San Francisco Bay Area. His public turn began in 2022, when he started to slam the Democrats for being soft on their own agenda. &#039;Where is the Democratic Party? Why aren&#039;t we standing up more firmly? More resolutely? Why aren&#039;t we calling this out?&#039; He seemed to set himself up to be the Democrat Party&#039;s spokesperson, launching a super PAC called Campaign For Democracy and touring deep red states. The run culminated in the December 2023 debate with his Floridian counterpart DeSantis, who pointed to his hypocrisy during COVID-19 by going out to fine-dining restaurant The French Laundry and sending his children to in-person private schools while his residents were still under lockdown. He said California ran out of UHauls because so many people were moving out to head to red states – including Florida. He said among the new residents in Florida is Newsom&#039;s wife&#039;s father. Biden made one of his last public speeches Monday night. After dropping out, many suggested Newsom wanted the job Newsom and Vice President Kamala Harris both rose to political power coming through the San Francisco Bay Area Newsom didn&#039;t back down in the one-on-one debate in Alpharetta, Georgia, taking a dig at DeSantis by saying they both won&#039;t be presidential nominees in 2024. &#039;You almost have to try to mess California up,&#039; DeSantis said during feisty opening remarks explaining why his state is superior. &#039;That is what Gavin Newsom has done since he has been governor.&#039; Newsom initially challenged DeSantis to a debate in September 2022. At the time, DeSantis was not yet running in the 2024 Republican presidential primary. The governor&#039;s profile made him the center of headlines after Joe Biden&#039;s debate disaster, with many suggesting he might win an open primary against Harris. But Newsom immediately headed to New Hampshire to canvas for Joe Biden, which won&#039;t stop those speculating he&#039;d replace the president on the ticket. Newsom, despite speculation, adamantly said that he &#039;will never turn my back on President Biden&#039; and promised he was not running a secret campaign. &#039;I don&#039;t know a Democrat in my party that would do so. And especially after tonight, we have his back,&#039; he said. He did his best to instead reassure Americans that the president is still capable. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (left) and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (right) met for a one-on-one debate hosted by Fox News and moderated by Sean Hannity (center) in December in Alpharetta, Georgia &#039;I spent a lot of time with him. I know Joe Biden. I know what he&#039;s accomplished in the last three and a half years. I know what he&#039;s capable of. And I have no trepidations.&#039; Newsom, 56, told DailyMail.com that claims that he could replace Biden, 81, in November were &#039;farcical.&#039; He apparently proved his own claim correct, when he almost immediately endorsed Harris upon her declaring her intention to run. &#039;Tough. Fearless. Tenacious. With our democracy at stake and our future on the line, no one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump&#039;s dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America’s Vice President,&#039; Newsom posted on X hours after Biden dropped out. Newsom&#039;s endorsement of Harris furthers the two&#039;s long interwoven political careers and shows a solidarity between the two. He also confirmed earlier this month that he would not challenge Harris for the presidency in 2024 - a commitment he made long ago - saying &#039;of course&#039; he would not run against her. On Thursday night, Newsom&#039;s seeming only major appearance again came on Fox News, with his fellow Californian set to have the biggest night of her political life. Read more",

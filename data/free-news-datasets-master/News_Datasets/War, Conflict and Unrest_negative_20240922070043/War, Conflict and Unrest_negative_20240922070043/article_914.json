The government of disasters is once again marching towards the next collapse of national security,” Lapid posted on the social media platform X.\nHe called for the removal of National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and his group of extremists “from any decision-making center,” adding that “the mass violations of the law in Yosh (West Bank) need to be stopped with a heavy hand.”\nOn Sunday, Israeli military officials also warned of the rising illegal settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, coupled with a decline in arrests by Israeli police.\nThe police force is overseen by Ben-Gvir, who has been accused even by left-wing Israeli politicians of turning a blind eye to illegal settler violence against Palestinians.\nIn May, the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem revealed a plan by Netanyahu's government in coordination with illegal settlers aimed at displacing Palestinian shepherds and residents from their lands in the West Bank. B'Tselem described this as part of the “Israeli apartheid system.”\nIsraeli estimates indicate that over 720,000 illegal settlers reside in West Bank settlements, including East Jerusalem.\nOver the past few years, the Israeli army has conducted regular raids in the occupied West Bank, which escalated after the Israel-Hamas war began last October.\nPalestinians have also been violently attacked by illegal Israeli settlers.\nAt least 640 Palestinians have since been killed and over 5,400 others injured by Israeli army fire in the occupied territory, according to the Health Ministry.\nIn a landmark opinion on July 19, the International Court of Justice declared Israel's decades-long occupation of Palestinian land unlawful and demanded the evacuation of all existing settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n*Writing by Mohammad Sio\nAnadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.

    "text": "Armed men ambushed a military convoy in eastern\nPakistan on Thursday, killing at least eleven police officers and injuring seven others.\nPolice officials told local media that two vans, carrying more than 20 officers, were trapped in rainwater when the “bandits” launched rockets at them.\nThe convoy came under attack in the Rahim Yar Khan district in a remote area when returning from routine duties aimed at targeting robbers in the region.\nMaryam Nawaz, the Punjab chief minister, condemned the attack and vowed that it would not go “unavenged”.\nShe said that her team of officials was dispatched with “clear directions to sort them out decisively”.\n“Sacrifices of police personnel will always be remembered,” she said, instructing the authorities to take immediate action to recover the missing officers.\nShehbaz Sharif, Pakistan’s prime minister, ordered “immediate and effective action” against those responsible for the attack. Asif Ali Zardari, the country’s president, also condemned it.\nNeighbouring Sindh province chief minister Murad Ali Shah has offered support to treat the injured officers.\n“Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan police should plan a joint operation against dacoits,” he said.\n“Punjab police is as brave as Sindh police, both have always fought against terrorism and dacoits,” he added. The armed groups in the region have consistently posed challenges to the provincial governments of Sindh and Punjab, despite numerous operations aimed at eradicating them.\nIn April, a review committee of the National Action Plan decided to launch a joint operation by the police forces in the area.\nEarlier in the day, gunmen opened fire on a school bus in the Attock district of the same region, killing two children, according to the police.\nThe attack on Thursday morning left five other children wounded as they were on their way to school. The children involved were as young as five years old.\nPolice reported that the assailants seemed to be targeting the driver, who was also injured.\nAttock district is located near Pakistan’s volatile north west, an area where attacks by armed groups have surged in recent years.\nIn 2014, Pakistani Taliban gunmen attacked a military-run school in the region, killing nearly 150 children.\nThe post\nEleven police officers killed in Pakistan ambush appeared first on The Telegraph.",

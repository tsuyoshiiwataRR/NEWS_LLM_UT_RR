    "text": "Fighting between the army and paramilitary forces in Sudan’s capital Khartoum continues for the third day, where the death toll has risen to nearly 100.\nAccording to the report of the foreign news agency AFP, the fight that started on Saturday is between the army chief Abdul Fateh al-Barhan and his deputy, the commander of the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Mohammad Hamdan Deglu.\nConcern was expressed at the global level regarding the worst fighting going on in Khartoum and there was a demand for negotiations by giving up the fighting immediately.\nThe doctors’ union said in a statement that 97 people, including civilians, have been killed so far in the clashes, but this number is not final because many people could not be taken to the hospital due to bad conditions.\nHe said that hundreds of civilians have been injured in the fighting so far.\nAccording to AFP correspondents, on Monday, terrifying sounds of gunfire and explosions are being heard across Khartoum, where clashes continue.\nAn eyewitness said that smoke and the smell of gunpowder spread from the damaged building.\nAccording to reports, the fighting between the two forces in the capital, Khartoum, began when Burhan and Deglu clashed over plans to integrate the RSF into the army.\nThis was the main condition of the final agreement after the two commanders set up a military government in 2021.\nThe seizure of the government by the military commanders in Sudan in 2019 ended the civil supremacy movement by ousting the then president Omar al-Bashir and created an economic crisis in the country.\nClashes have gripped civilians in Sudan, where the crisis has dragged on as hopes for civilian supremacy in the country have faded.\nOn Saturday, both sides accused each other of starting the fight.\nBoth sides claimed to have captured key sites, including the capital’s airport and the presidential palace, but their claims could not be independently confirmed.\nThe clashes later spread to other areas, including Sudan’s West Darfur region and the eastern border of Kassala state.\nThree World Food Program staff were killed in North Darfur on Saturday, prompting the agency to close its mission across Sudan.\nCalled for medical personnel to make way for ambulances and stop fighting to treat the injured as there are risks involved in taking the injured to the hospital.\nRecall that former President Omar al-Bashir formed the RSF in 2013, which emerged from the Janjaweed militia that his government used to control a non-Arab tribe in Darfur.\nThe current tension in Sudan is a result of the ongoing tussle between the two generals, which is indicative of the differences between the regular army and the RSF.\n#Clashes #army #paramilitary #forces #Khartoum #capital #Sudan #killed #people\n2024-08-22 21:29:10",

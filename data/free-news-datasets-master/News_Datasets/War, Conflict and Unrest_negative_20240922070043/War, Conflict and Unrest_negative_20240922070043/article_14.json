    "text": "US-Israeli genocide in Gaza The Israeli military has killed dozens more Palestinians in war-wracked Gaza as the months-long genocidal war continues with no signs of coming to an end. Most of the deadly Israeli attacks were carried out in central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah, and the Maghazi and Nuseirat refugee camps. A Palestinian journalist was killed along with his wife and child in an air raid on his house in the Maghazi refugee camp. Meanwhile, reports said the al-aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah was overwhelmed with injured and people gathering to identify the bodies of the slain Gazans. The regime has launched its invasion in Deir al-Balah after issuing the so-called evacuation orders for the overcrowded central city. The Israeli genocide, which began early last October, has so far killed more than 40,200 Palestinians and injured nearly 93,000. Yemen's anti-Israel operation The leader of Ansarullah movement says Yemen will press ahead with its naval operations against Israel as long as the genocide in Gaza persists. Abdul malik al-Houthi said, only this week, more than 20 missiles and drones have hit Israeli and Israeli-bound ships in the international waters. Regarding the situation in war-torn Gaza, Houthi said Israel is committing genocide through bombing, starvation, epidemics, torture and other crimes. He called the support of the Palestinians in Gaza “a religious and moral duty.” He also hailed Colombia’s decision to ban coal export to Israel, and slammed certain Arab nations’ continuous provision of goods to the regime. Houthi said the resistance axis response to Israel’s assassinations is impending, and the “deliberate delay” is aimed at making the retaliation more effective and painful. The Yemeni leader called on the people in the Arab country to hold another million-strong rally in support of Palestine this Friday. Ukraine-Russia war The Russian president has accused Ukraine of attempting to strike the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in an overnight attack as Kiev claims more gains in Russian territory. Putin made the remarks during an online meeting with senior officials over the situation in Russian regions bordering Ukraine. The officials said the situation was tense but under control in their respective regions. Earlier, Russian officials said the armed forces repelled missile and drone attacks on the Volgograd, Rostov, Bryansk, and Voronezh regions. Also according to governor of Russia’s Kursk region, where Kiev claims to have captured some settlements, two Ukrainian missiles and a drone were destroyed. Two and a half years into the war, Kiev launched a surprise incursion into Russia earlier this month. It claims to have seized more than 1,000 square kilometers of territory in Kursk. But this cannot be independently verified. Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses:",

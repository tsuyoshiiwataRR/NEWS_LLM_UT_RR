    "text": "What’s worse than finding a worm in your apple? How about a bunch of them in your gut? A revolting clip shows the moment that parasites were spotted wriggling around in a 70-year-old man’s abdomen, not unlike something out of the movie “Alien.” The septuagenarian had reported to a hospital in China to undergo a cholangioscopy, in which doctors insert a camera either through the mouth or the skin to examine the upper abdomen for problems, the Daily Mail reported. In this case, doctors found that the man, who had a history of colon cancer, harbored a tumor in his intestine, according to a study published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine. And that wasn’t all: During the examination, doctors found five flat, leaf-shaped worms writhing about in the biliary tract, the network of organs that transports digestive juices from the liver to the small intestine. In the freaky clip, the parasite can be seen squirming about in the tubes, evoking a clip from the Animal Planet docuseries “Monsters Inside Me.” Doctors identified the gastrointestinal interlopers as clonorchis sinensis, a species of liver fluke that’s found in undercooked fish and shrimp, per the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s native to East Asia, where raw seafood is commonly consumed. When a person eats a piece of contaminated fish, the baby parasite travels to the bile duct, where it grows into an adult worm measuring 10 to 25 millimeters by 3 to 5 millimeters. As most cases are asymptomatic, the patient often doesn’t even know the parasite is present. However, if untreated it can lead to complications ranging from bacterial infections to pancreatitis to liver abscesses. Fortunately, doctors were able to extract the parasite, after which they prescribed the patient a drug for such infections. They also put him on chemotherapy to combat the intestinal cancer.",

    "text": "celebritiesBackstreet Boys singer Nick Carter (43) was confronted with yet another tragedy in his family on December 23 when his sister Bobbie Jean suddenly died at the age of 41.\nPolice now confirm to various American media that she was found unconscious in her bathroom, just like her brother Aaron last year.\nLast Saturday, mother Jane Carter confirmed the sudden death of Bobbie Jean to\nentertainment site ‘TMZ’. She is said to have died of cardiac arrest, but that has not yet been confirmed. What the police have now revealed is that Bobbie Jean was found in her bathroom. She was then taken unconscious to hospital, where medics later pronounced her dead. Police have launched an investigation into the death, but authorities say there are no signs of foul play. It would now be investigated whether Carter had used drugs on the day of her death. According to ‘People’, the woman was imprisoned for cocaine possession from late September to early November. However, her roommates told police that Bobbie Lee had not used narcotics since her release. In addition, no drugs were found in Carter’s bedroom or bathroom, officers said.\nBobbie Jean, Nick, Leslie, Angel en Aaron Carter. © WireImage\nBobbie Jean’s death is the third loss for the Carter family in more than ten years. Last year, Nick’s brother Aaron Carter (34) drowned in his bath after overdosing on medication. Their sister Leslie died at the age of 25 after falling in the shower in 2012. She reportedly fell asleep under the influence of drugs after the fall and never woke up.

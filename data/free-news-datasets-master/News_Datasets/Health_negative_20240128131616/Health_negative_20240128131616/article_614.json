    "text": "The NHS has offered children with severe epilepsy brain surgery before medicinal cannabis, parents have revealed. Several families have told the Mail that their children were offered the “incredibly invasive procedure” which involves separating one side of the brain from the other and can cause vision loss. One mother refused the operation, which costs the NHS up to £33,400, and requested medicinal cannabis oil, which was legalized five years ago and has been shown to be effective with epileptic children. The oils are given orally every day and three children in the UK have NHS prescriptions, with successful results. But other young people with similar conditions have been denied, leaving parents paying up to £2,000 a month to obtain the medication privately, while others cannot access it at all. Luci Griffin’s son Alfie, 13, (pictured together) was diagnosed with intractable epilepsy six years ago and the family have so far been denied medicinal cannabis on the NHS. But last year doctors offered to perform a hemispherotomy on Alfie, which would involve temporarily removing a piece of his skull to operate on his brain. The family are currently purchasing highly concentrated CBD oil online, which costs them £300 a month, but Alfie’s condition is not improving. He can no longer go to school and Mrs Griffin has had to stop working to become a full-time carer (concentrated cannabis oil file photo) Luci Griffin’s son Alfie, 13, was diagnosed with intractable epilepsy six years ago and the family have so far been denied medicinal cannabis on the NHS. But last year doctors offered to perform a hemispherotomy on Alfie, which would involve temporarily removing a piece of his skull to operate on his brain. The family said they were warned this was “life-threatening”, that Alfie could lose his peripheral vision and would need weeks of rehabilitation to learn to walk again. Mrs Griffin said: “I don’t want to have to go to him and say we know it didn’t work… I want to say we’ve done everything we could, Alf, we did everything we could, why not do it?” Try medical cannabis first? The family, from Peterborough, have been refused Epidiolex on the NHS and private clinics that prescribe other oils cannot help. In October, the Mail revealed that two families were smuggling cannabis oil from the Netherlands in suitcases, as the pharmacy that supplied their private prescription did not have enough stock. Ms Griffin said obtaining the drug privately may not even be an option as they would struggle to keep up with the large monthly payments. ‘Even if we could (get it privately), how long can we sustain £2,000 a month? Not for long because we would have to sell the house,” the mother said. The family are currently purchasing highly concentrated CBD oil online, which costs them £300 a month, but Alfie’s condition is not improving. He can no longer go to school and Mrs Griffin has had to stop working to become a full-time carer. She said: ‘We are absolutely stuck. They were alone. “We have no support.” Families say they pay between £400 and £2,000 a month to obtain medical cannabis privately (file photo of scientist checking hemp plants in a greenhouse) The Mail has spoken to two other families whose epileptic children were offered brain surgery. “You can’t reverse brain surgery, so it seems crazy,” one mother said. Caroline Gisbourne’s 16-year-old son Mitchell underwent the procedure before medical cannabis was legalized in 2018, but it didn’t work and he is now using the oils successfully. She said: “If I had known about medicinal cannabis oils before, there would be no way to put him through the operation.” Brain surgery costs to the NHS depend on the age of the patients and the complexity of the procedure, but typically range between £7,800 and £33,400. Families say they pay between £400 and £2,000 a month to obtain medical cannabis privately. A spokesperson for NHS England said: “The decision to proceed with surgery… would be made jointly by a clinical team and the patient’s family and/or carers.”",

    "text": "The maker of the BlendJet 2 has recalled 4.8 million of the popular portable blenders because of the devices reportedly overheating or catching fire, and the blender blades breaking off, posing a laceration hazard to consumers, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\nThe CPSC recommends that consumers immediately stop using the recalled blenders and contact BlendJet for a free replacement of the blender’s base unit.\nAccording to the CPSC , BlendJet has received about 329 reports of blades breaking during use, and 17 reports of the blender overheating or causing fires that resulted in property damage claims totaling approximately $150,000. The company also received about 49 reports of minor burns, and one report of a laceration.\nSkip Ahead: Details of the BlendJet 2 recall.\nMore on Blenders Additional Incidents Increase Concern About BlendJet 2 Blender CR's Blender Ratings & Buying Guide Best Blenders for Making Smoothies Best Personal Blenders Consumer Reports called on the CPSC to take action on the blender this summer, when 12 complaints to the agency’s SaferProducts.gov website, as well as CR’s own tests, indicated that the blender posed risks. Among evaluations CR performed was a durability test involving crushed ice in which the BlendJet 2’s blade broke off after 38 minutes of operation. On Dec. 19, in light of new complaints to CPSC that included three reports of injuries, CR amplified its warning . It asked the federal agency to immediately investigate potential hazards and take whatever action was necessary to protect the public. The recall came nine days later.\nThe recall, which also includes about 117,000 units sold in Canada, is one of the largest CR has reported on.\n“We’re grateful to the CPSC and BlendJet for getting this done and encourage everyone who has one of these blenders to take part in the recall,” says William Wallace, CR’s associate director of safety policy. “BlendJet should get the word out about this recall as much as possible in the new year.”\nThe CPSC told CR that the agency has reviewed Blend Jet’s fix for its portable blender and that the remedy “addresses the hazard in a way that will protect consumers.” CR will evaluate the new base and report on the results in the coming weeks.\nBlendJet’s spokesperson, Ethan Rasiel, says the base being offered to consumers as part of the recall is the same one that is already on store shelves and starts with the serial number of 5543 or higher. When asked why the company also didn’t offer a refund as part of the recall, Rasiel said that “BlendJet customers love their BlendJets and want to continue to enjoy them for years to come. Through this recall we are allowing them to do that.” CR’s Wallace says BlendJet should offer people a refund if they aren’t comfortable getting a replacement.\nPortable blenders like the BlendJet are compact, battery-powered blending devices with a lightweight design that allows consumers to blend smoothies, shakes, and more while on the go. Operated by push button, they are less powerful than standard blenders, with a blending jar that often doubles as a drinking cup. Their lithium-ion batteries are usually recharged with a USB cable. The BlendJet 2, introduced in 2020, is among the most popular portable blenders on the market.\nThe recall covers BlendJet 2 blenders sold in a variety of colors and designs with a serial number that begins with four digits between 5201 and 5542. Consumers can identify blenders under recall by visiting the company’s recall page or plugging the serial number of their product into BlendJet’s serial number search tool . Consumers can also get help identifying their blender by calling BlendJet at 844-334-0562 from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. ET any day of the week. BlendJet 2 blenders currently on sale are not subject to recall, according to the company.\nIn addition to identifying their blender as a recalled product, consumers will need to remove the rubber seal from the base of the recalled blender and cut it into three or more pieces, then upload a photo of the seal along with a photo showing the serial number at the bottom of the unit to BlendJet’s recall page, or email them to safety@blendjet.com .\nThe serial number can be found on the bottom of the BlendJet 2 base, left. Consumers requesting a replacement are also asked to cut the base’s plastic seal to render it unusable.

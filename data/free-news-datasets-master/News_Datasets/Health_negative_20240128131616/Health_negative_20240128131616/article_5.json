    "text": "Cher is seeking to place her 47-year-old son Elijah Blue Allman into a conservatorship , claiming in court documents that he's allegedly suffering from \"severe mental health and substance abuse issues,\" and unable to manage his finances.\nAccording to documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by NBC News, the Oscar-winning actress and singer states that Allman receives regular payouts from a trust set up by his late father, legendary musician Gregg Allman. However, Cher is concerned he will immediately spend those distributions on drugs, \"leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself, and putting Elijah’s life at risk,\" the documents state.\nCher argues that Allman is “substantially unable to manage his financial resources\" and needs to be overseen by a conservator in order to \"protect Elijah’s property from loss or injury.\"\nThe \"Believe\" singer also states that she has \"worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs.\"\n The petition argues the 77-year-old is best suited to be the sole conservator, and includes signed affidavits from other family members supporting the request. It goes on to say that Allman’s estranged wife Marieangela King would not make a reliable conservator because \"their tumultuous relationship has been marked by a cycle of drug addiction and mental health crises.\"\nCher alleges that King has been a destructive presence in Allman's life and is impeding efforts to have him get the help he needs with drugs, including recently trying to check him out of a treatment center where he was receiving much needed medical care. She concludes that if King were to be appointed conservator, Allman's estate would suffer \"the immediate loss or dissipation of Elijah’s assets for self-destructive purposes,\" according to the documents.\nAllman and King were married in December 2013. Allman reportedly filed for divorce in 2021.",

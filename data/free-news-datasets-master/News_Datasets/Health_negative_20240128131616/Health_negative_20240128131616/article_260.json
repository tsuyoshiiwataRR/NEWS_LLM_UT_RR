    "text": "Antonia Hay has had surgery and kidney failure since being infected with the deadly bacteria\nA girl has been left fighting for her life after she caught a deadly strain of E. coli.\nAntonia Hay, 17, is believed to have caught STEC-HUS, caused by E. coli O157, from food at a Christmas market.\nThe aspiring actress, has spent most of the past two weeks in intensive care, only coming home temporarily on Christmas Day.\nShe has had multiple operations, including to remove part of her bowel, and a blood transfusion as kidney failure has meant she requires dialysis, and left her feeling her “dreams have been ripped away” from her because she cannot continue her performing arts course.\nJemima Hay, her older sister, said: “She is lucky to be alive and has continued to show amazing determination and strength throughout this time, despite the immense stress, pain and trauma – all combined with an extreme phobia of injections.”\nWhile the teenager is believed to have contracted E. coli from a Christmas market in November, it is not known what sort of food led to her catching it.\nAntonia has had to give up her performing arts course because of the infection\nShe is one of 30 confirmed cases of E. coli across England and Scotland since late July 2023, with one person having died.\nMost cases occurred in December, however, which sparked the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to issue a recall notice for four cheese products on Christmas Day.\nThe cheeses were Mrs Kirkham’s Mild and Creamy Lancashire, Mrs Kirkham’s Tasty Lancashire, Mrs Kirkham’s Mature Lancashire and Mrs Kirkham’s Smoked Lancashire, which were part of Christmas hampers.\nA further notice was issued on Wednesday by the FSA for the Waitrose artisan No.1 Kirkham’s Lancashire product, all of which are made by the same company.\nCheese may have been in hampers Mrs Kirkham’s, an award-winning cheesemaker from Lancashire, makes its product in Goosnargh and is the only place in the world to still make raw milk Lancashire cheese.\n“The cheeses are sometimes sold as a full block or served as individual portions and may have been provided as part of a hamper you’ve purchased or been gifted,” the FSA said.\n“In some cases it’s been sold as part of a charcutier grazing platter. It may not always be clear whether you have purchased an affected product.”\nAlthough E. coli is often transmitted via contaminated food, the UK Health Security Agency says it “can also be spread by close contact with an infected person, as well as direct contact with an infected animal”.\nSteve Hay, Antonia’s father, believes it was caught from food at a local market in Great Missenden, Bucks.\n“To anyone who may have experienced food poisoning symptoms at any restaurant, establishment or any market stall in Great Missenden during the Christmas Market, particularly on or from 25 November, please can you PM me,” he wrote on Facebook.\n“My middle daughter is fighting for her life after a serious bacterial infection suspected from eating something around this time and we have strong theories, but just need to know if anyone else was affected with any level of stomach issues or illness.”\n%n\nDiscover Telegraph Wine Cellar’s new wine club.

    "text": "MARLTON, N.J., Dec. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- An unknown number of patients are being notified that their Social Security numbers and other confidential information may have been compromised in what appears to be a cyberattack against INTEGRIS Health. The data breach lawyers at Console & Associates, P.C. are investigating claims on behalf of anyone who may be affected by a possible INTEGRIS breach, hoping to fully inform them of the risks they face in the wake of the breach as well as their legal rights.\nThe sensitive personal data of INTEGRIS patients may have been compromised. If the hackers' claims are correct, victims' full names, Social Security numbers and other personal information may be in the hands of criminals, putting victims at a greater risk of identity theft and other frauds.\nOn December 24, 2023, INTEGRIS posted a website notice describing what the company calls a \"data privacy incident.\" According to the notice, INTEGRIS was in the process of investigating a possible cyberattack when patients began receiving communications directly from those who claimed to have carried out the attack. The possible INTEGRIS breach is a developing situation, and more information is expected shortly.\nThe list of sensitive information that was possibly exposed includes patients':\n- Names,\n- Dates of birth,\n- Contact information,\n- Demographic information, and\n- Social Security numbers.\nIf you receive a data breach notice from INTEGRIS, you could now be at risk of identity theftâ€”and the devastating financial and legal consequences that go along with it.\nWhat Should You Do if You Receive an INTEGRIS Data Breach Letter?\nINTEGRIS has not yet confirmed a data breach. However, based on the company's recent website notice, a breach of patient information is possible. Individuals who receive a data breach letter from INTEGRIS should take steps to protect themselves. (See our Guide for Victims of Data Breach for more details at\nhttps://www.myinjuryattorney.com/patient-privacy-data-breach-lawyers/if-your-information-has-been-compromised-in-a-data-breach/).\nAdditionally, potential victims should consider contacting a data breach attorney immediately, as anyone who receives a data breach letter from INTEGRIS may be entitled to financial compensation.\nIf you wish to discuss this data security incident, please contact Console & Associates, P.C. at (866) 778-5500.

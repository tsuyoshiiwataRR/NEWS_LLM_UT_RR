    "text": "An NHS therapist who texted a patient asking \"wanna bang?\" has narrowly avoided being struck off.\nMarried Alicia Hing messaged the male patient with sexual advances, claiming she was attracted to him. The patient, a vulnerable man who had suffered from life-changing spinal injuries, was told he wouldn't receive nude images of her unless he \"displayed enthusiasm\", a disciplinary hearing was told.\nMrs Hing was working as an occupational therapist at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire when she first met the patient in 2018, later sending him a friend request on Facebook and sending him her personal number. Over the following weeks, the therapist engaged in a series of flirty messages over WhatsApp , it was heard, \"crossing professional boundaries\". She later messaged him on dating app Tinder, asking \"wanna bang?\". The hearing was told how the patient rejected her sexual advances, replying \"I'm not the person\".\nEmployed by Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, Mrs Hing moved to a role in the hospital's intensive care unit in early 2019. The panel heard how she had discussed some of those on the ward with the patient over messages, making vile and disparaging comments about them. In one message, the panel heard Mrs Hing spoke about one person who had undergone an amputation, calling them \"revolting\" and a \"human blob\".\nHer messages came to light later that same year when the patient she had hit on blew the whistle, handing over the exchanges to an outpatient psychologist. Among the boundary-crossing messages was one where she admitted: \"I do kinda fancy you\".\nMrs Hing was suspended by the hospital in November 2019 after the messages came to light, and has since resigned ahead of the formal disciplinary hearing. She was given a 12-month caution by the Health and Care Professions Tribunal Service (HCPTS) for breaching \"fundamental tenets of the profession\".\nAs part of her evidence, it was heard how she had simply sent the forward messages for \"validation\" rather than a genuine advance, and admitted she was \"quite disgusted\" in her comment about the ICU patient.- She also expressed deep remorse and regret over the messages.\nThe HCPTS panel found Hing had committed misconduct and brought the profession into disrepute. It ruled that some of the messages sent by Hing were sexually motivated acts \"towards a vulnerable patient who had suffered life-changing injuries\".\nIn its ruling the tribunal concluded: \"[Hing] engaged in sexually motivated conduct towards Patient A (albeit not in pursuit of a sexual relationship) on several days over a period of nearly 4 weeks. He was a vulnerable patient in her care. She also shared personal information of a distressing nature that left Patient A feeling anxious, burdened and concerned.\n\"[Hing] subsequently contacted Patient A and blamed him for having made an entirely proper complaint about the Registrant's conduct. By engaging in this behaviour, [Hing] breached fundamental tenets of the profession and has brought the profession into disrepute.\"",

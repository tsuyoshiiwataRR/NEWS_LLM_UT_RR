    "text": "The foal was found seriously ill after the RSPCA received welfare concerns (Image: RSPCA) A woman has been given a 16-week suspended prison sentence after failing to give her extremely ill foal veterinary treatment.\nCricket, aged between six and eight months old, was found tethered in a field in Castleford, West Yorkshire, on January 13 after the RSPCA responded to welfare concerns.\nThe foal was found lethargic and wobbly on his feet, with no food, water or shelter available. He weighed just 85kg when he should have weighed nearer 150kg given his age.\nCarol Summers, from Castleford, has now been banned from keeping animals for ten years after she admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the foal and failing to meet his needs following a prosecution by the RSPCA.\nAt a sentencing hearing at Kirklees Magistrates Court on 6 December, she was also handed a 16-week prison sentence, which the bench suspended for 12 months.\nThe court heard how RSPCA inspector Kris Walker had visited the field and seen multiple tethered horses but one in particular raised concern.\nIn a statement to the court he said: \"I saw a tethered young colt. He did not look any older than eight to ten-months-old. He was lethargic, wobbly on his feet and very thin with his hips and spine all prominent. The rug he was wearing was too big for him and not on properly. He was scouring badly. There was no food, water or shelter readily available for him and he should not have been tethered due to his young age.\"\nA vet was called out immediately to examine Cricket. She gave him a body score of just one out of nine and said he was suffering from dehydration, hyperthermia and diarrhoea and needed urgent veterinary care. The police took the foal into possession and arrangements were made to transport him for treatment. He was so thirsty he was drinking from the nearest puddle.\nSummers arrived on the scene and was told Cricket had been seized by the police and an investigation would be started. She agreed to sign him over into the care of the RSPCA, telling inspector Walker she'd owned the foal for six weeks. She also told the inspector that a vet had prescribed steroids to treat Cricket, although no record of this was found.\nCricket was initially taken to a nearby veterinary practice before being transferred to a specialist equine hospital. A vet who gave evidence as part of the case said: \"There was no shelter available for the foal and no water was provided. Cricket should have been provided with ad-libitum water, especially given that he was sick with diarrhoea and so had a higher demand for water intake.\"\nDespite receiving extensive ongoing treatment and care, Cricket's condition sadly did not improve in the weeks that followed and a vet made the decision that it was in his best interest to put him down to prevent further suffering.\nThe court heard that despite Summers telling the RSPCA inspector she had owned Cricket for six weeks, she later disputed this and said it had only been three. However, she agreed she had assumed ownership and had failed to get the foal the care he needed and he had suffered unnecessarily as a result.\nIn addition to the suspended 16 week custodial sentence - to run concurrently for each offence - Summers was also ordered to complete 15 RAR days and pay costs of £400 and a victim surcharge of £154. She will not be able to appeal her ban for the next five years.\nMagistrates said Cricket's basic needs had not been met and there was a failure by the defendant in all aspects of horse ownership.\nRelated articles The European city where wild boars are causing havoc as they run riot Ancient humans would have met 'most terrifying predators of all time' in America Pet owners issued warning over 'worrying' trend at UK vets Model outraged after facing a year in jail over topless dog walk The full story behind the rumour of EU pet tax as it creates panic on TikTok Become an Express Premium member\nSupport fearless journalism\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free\nGet super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial",

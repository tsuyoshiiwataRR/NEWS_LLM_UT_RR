    "text": "Injured during pursuit, Nelson County sheriff says, 'I'm lucky' A police pursuit with speeds reaching more than 100 miles an hour ends with an arrest and a local sheriff injured. A police pursuit with speeds reaching more than 100 miles an hour ends with an arrest and a local sheriff injured. A police pursuit with speeds reaching more than 100 miles an hour ends with an arrest and a local sheriff injured. In video obtained by WLKY, the wailing of police sirens is heard during a pursuit and an officer is seen falling to the ground as his spike strips and other equipment become tangled under the suspect's speeding car. That officer is none other than Nelson County Sheriff Ramon Pineiroa, who raced to the scene when he heard about the chase entering his county. It happened just before 5 p.m. Sunday, on Christmas Eve. \"The food was ready. We were ready to go to my in-laws,\" the sheriff told WLKY. Kentucky State Police were in pursuit of Jacorey Thomas, 32, who was wanted on charges out of Ohio. They had tried to stop him for speeding in Hardin County, but Thomas took off. The sheriff posted up at Exit 21 of the Bluegrass Parkway. \"He was still going pretty lead foot, five miles later, he was still at it. So I said, 'I'll set up spike strips again,'\" Pineiroa said. Responding officers had already thrown down several, and the suspect was driving on at least one flat tire. \"When he came around and I pulled the spike strips, they got tangled underneath his car, and that's when the pulling began,\" Pineiroa said. Incredibly, he managed to get back up immediately, and then he tried to drive himself to the hospital. The sheriff eventually called for help and was loaded into an ambulance to be taken to a local hospital. His fingers were cut deep and the bleeding would not stop. Pineiroa was treated and released that evening and says he feels fortunate it didn't turn out worse. \"Blessed, lucky. You name it. I got all 10 (fingers),\" he said. The pursuit ended just two miles from where the sheriff was injured. Jacorey Thomas is from Cincinnati, but he remains behind bars in Hardin County. He is facing multiple charges related to the chase, including assault on a police officer.",

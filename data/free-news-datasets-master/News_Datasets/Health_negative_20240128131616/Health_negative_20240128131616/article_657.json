    "text": "Born on Dec. 30, 1928, in McKean, Pa., AnnaBelle Kurtz peacefully passed away on Dec. 23, 2023, at CVPH in Plattsburgh. She was 94 years old. AnnaBelle was a beloved wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and friend, leaving behind a legacy of love and cherished memories.\nAnnaBelle was preceded in death by her devoted husband of 72 years, Alfred H. Kurtz, her parents, and her sisters. She was also preceded by her son-in-law, Joel Harwood. Her passing has left a void in the hearts of all who knew her.\nShe is survived by her children, Peter (Carolyn) Kurtz of Lake Placid, Barbara (Joel) Harwood of Lewis, and Anna (Reginald) Whitney of Keene. AnnaBelle was a doting grandmother to her grandchildren, Paige (George) Saltamach of Elizabethtown, Clare Harwood of Rochester, Hugh Harwood of Lewis, Hanna Whitney of Rotterdam, and Emily Whitney of Keene. She also had the joy of being a great-grandmother to Henry and Etta Saltamach, both of Elizabethtown.\nAnnaBelle's family meant everything to her, and her grandchildren were her greatest gifts. She was known for her love of sewing, crafting, reading, and solving puzzles. AnnaBelle had a passion for storytelling and would captivate those around her with her vivid narratives.\nA long-standing member of the United Church of Christ in Elizabethtown, AnnaBelle found solace and strength in her faith throughout her life. Her dedication to her church community was an inspiration to all who knew her.\nTo honor AnnaBelle's remarkable life, a Visitation will be held on Jan. 6, 2024, at the United Congregational Church of Christ in Elizabethtown at 1 p.m., followed by a Memorial Service at 2 p.m.; burial will follow at the Essex County Veteran's Cemetery.\nAs we gather to celebrate the extraordinary life of AnnaBelle Kurtz, we remember her kindness, warmth, and unwavering love. May her spirit continue to guide us and her memory forever be a blessing.\nServices were entrusted to Heidrick Funeral Home, Elizabethtown, N.Y.\nIn Memory of AnnaBelleWhen is the\n[ordering deadline?](javascript:void(0))\nIn Memory of AnnaBelleHow does\n[it work?](javascript:void(0))\nSend Flowers: When Is the Ordering Deadline?\nANY DAY OF THE WEEK\nOrder any time up till the day before\nMON-FRI Order by 2:00PM\nSAT & SUN Order by noon\nTUES-SAT\nOrder by 3:00PM\nThe day before\nSAT & SUN Order by Saturday\nNote: These are general guidelines; some florists may not be able to operate within these timelines.

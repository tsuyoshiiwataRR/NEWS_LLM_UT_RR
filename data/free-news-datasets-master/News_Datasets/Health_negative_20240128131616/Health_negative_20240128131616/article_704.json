    "text": "Yet another health care giant will have a mask mandate as the local COVID wastewater continues to surge and infections rise across the region.\nMass General Brigham will be bringing back its staff mask mandate in the new year with local hospitals seeing higher respiratory infection levels amid the winter when cases typically go up.\nWhen more than 2.85% of patients at emergency departments or outpatient clinics have respiratory illness symptoms, Mass General Brigham’s employee mask mandate is triggered .\n“With the percentage of patients presenting at emergency rooms and outpatient facilities with respiratory illnesses exceeding 2.85 percent in the region, Mass General Brigham will begin requiring masking for healthcare staff interacting directly with patients on Jan. 2,” Mass General Brigham said in a statement.\n“Patients and visitors will be strongly encouraged to wear a facility-issued mask,” Mass General Brigham added.\nHealth care personnel will need to use a facility-issued facemask in direct interactions with patients in clinical care locations — such as when entering a patient room or bay, or in other locations where care is delivered, such as examining a patient on a stretcher.\nPatients and visitors will be strongly encouraged to wear a facility-issued facemask in those same situations when they are able to, Mass General Brigham said.\nRelated Articles Health |",

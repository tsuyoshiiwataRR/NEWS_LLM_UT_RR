    "text": "The very famous singer Cher has filed for the conservatorship of her son Elijah Blue Allman after his issue with substance abuse. She has claimed that her child is suffering from severe mental health issues and substance abuse issues, and therefore he will be unable to manage his finances. In the documents filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court, the mother of 47-year old Elijah is seeking to be the sole conservator of his son’s wealth. The document also seems to state that Elijah is currently unable to manage his assets due to the severe mental and substance abuse issues that haunt the young man. Cher also claims that Elijah is due to receive assets from a trust, and a conservator is required to protect his property from loss. The documents also state that Elijah’s wife is not fit to be his conservator because their relationship has been marked by a cycle of drug addiction and mental health crises. His wife, Marieangela King, once accused Cher of kidnapping her husband from a hotel. This shows that the duo was not on good terms for a long time. Cher fears that the funds that are to be received by Elijah by the end of the year will be immediately spent on drugs, which will eventually leave Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and will put his life at risk. The filing also says that Cher deeply cares for her son and has always acted with his best interests in mind. A hearing for a temporary order is currently set for January 25, 2024, with the hearing on a permanent order scheduled for March 6, 2024. Everyone might be wondering how conservatorships work. It is usually filed when a person is considered to have a severely diminished mental capacity and is unable to take decisions that are best for them. The court grants someone the power to make financial decisions and major life choices for them. Cher on the abduction of her son Earlier in October this year, Cher broke the silence on the allegations by her daughter-in-law. King claimed that Cher has kidnapped her husband, who is also Cher’s son, from a hotel room. In an interaction, the singer said that the rumor was not true and also declined to comment further on it. A report surfaced that Cher allegedly hired four men to forcibly remove her son from a hotel room in New York City. King made these claims in her divorce paper that she filed against Elijah in December. She has also openly spoken about her son’s drug addictions and said that she is not the only mother who is suffering from such problems. She has been watching her son’s years-long struggles with substance abuse. She said in an interview that I’m a mother. This is my job, one way or another, to try to help my children. You do anything for your children. Whenever you can help them, you just do it because that’s what being a mother is. But it’s joy, even with heartache—mostly, when you think of your children, you just smile, you love them, and you try to be there for them. Elijah Blue Allman was born on July 10, 1976, a year after Gregg Allman and Cher married. They got separated three years after their son was born. Cher and Elijah have not had a normal relationship. She said in an interview with Robin McGraw on Dr. Phil that she and her son do not have a very stable relationship. King has also claimed that they were working on their marriage by spending some days alone to try and save it up. But Elijah was removed by four men, and she said that one of them revealed that they were hired by Cher herself. Cher, nevertheless, has consistently stated that she will be there for her kids anytime they need her.",

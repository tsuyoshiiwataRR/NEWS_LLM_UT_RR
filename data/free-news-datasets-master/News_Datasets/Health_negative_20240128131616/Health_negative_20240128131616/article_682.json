    "text": "HAMILTON COUNTY, Ohio (WKRC) - A man has been arrested after he recklessly failed to provide care for a person who has been clinically diagnosed with a developmental disability. According to court documents, Seydou Kane was arrested after he left Nakoma Thompson alone while at a soccer game. Kane told Thompson that they were going to a soccer game. Instead, Kane took Thompson to his own soccer game at Withrow High School. Kane then left him in the stands alone while he went and played. Thompson requires 24/7 care due to his diagnoses. Thompson became anxious as a result of being left alone around people he didn't know. He said he was scared and didn't know what to do so he called another provider and asked for help. As a result of this, Thompson was taken to the hospital after the game to help with his anxiety attack. Kane is officially charged with failing to provide for a functionally impaired person and patient endangerment. Kane failed to uphold his part of the contract that he signed to be a care taker for Nakoma Thompson.",

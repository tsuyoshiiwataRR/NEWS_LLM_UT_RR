    "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — [According to the American Heart Association](https://newsroom.heart.org/news/heart-attack-deaths-spike-during-the-winter-holidays), heart attack deaths are more likely to happen during this time of year. \"During the Christmas holidays, and specifically the last week in December, we're seeing an increased correlation of heart attacks and strokes,\" said Dr. Emmanuel Isang, a UT Medical Center cardiologist. \"There's no true study that shows what exactly causes it. But we believe there are several factors that are associated with it.\" He said medical professionals believe this increase in heart attack deaths can be caused by stress, a change in routine and not eating or drinking in moderation. \"The first one is when we're with family and friends is an increase in stress,\" said Dr. Isang. \"And with that stress, we're not eating the right foods, we're eating more processed foods, drinking more alcohol and not exercising enough, which can, which are all risk factors for heart disease.\" With the rise in heart attack deaths this time of year, Isang says it's important to know the symptoms to look out for. \"Crushing chest pain, sometimes it can radiate to the left shoulder,\" said Isang. But he says the signs of a heart attack can be different, especially for women. \"Anyone who's having jaw pain, shortness of breath, shoulder pain, abdominal pain should also be included in that,\" he said. And for Robin Morgan, a heart attack survivor, she said it seemed like she just had the flu. \"The trigger for me was my arms, my forearms started hurting,\" said Morgan, \"And it felt like someone was ringing them. So that was kind of a trigger for me to go, that doesn't usually come along with flu symptoms, like you know, you get a fever. I did sweat a little bit. And I did find that I had some jaw pain.\" Morgan said if she didn't have those other symptoms, she probably would have just taken some medicine and ignored the pain. But she said she's thankful she did go to the emergency room, because she had a heart attack while in the cath lab. \"When I got there, my cardiologist, Janet Eichholz, was there and she did a nuclear stress test that day. I failed it miserably,\" said Morgan. \"And then we went to the cath lab, and she put a stent in my artery. It was 99% blocked.\" Morgan said before her heart attack, she wasn't exercising regularly or eating well — but now she has made lifestyle changes and she wants other people to consider making changes too. The American Heart Association's research shows that a third of the adults in Knox County are obese, have high blood pressure, or have high cholesterol, which can all put someone at a greater risk of having a cardiac event. \"Some of the biggest risk factors for heart disease include high cholesterol, diabetes, strong family history, when we're having family around, this is the perfect time to ask those appropriate questions,\" said Isang. \" But age is also a risk factor, high blood pressure. And also, potential unknown congenital conditions can play a huge factor. I think one of the biggest and the most preventable risk factors is smoking. So it's the best time to quit smoking. If not quitting, then reducing the amount of tobacco use.\" There are things you can do to lower your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. \"AHA recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity,\" he said. \"But more specifically, just being as consistent as possible and not trying to fall away from your routines exercise regularly. Watch what you're eating. Have fun, but like, everything in moderation.\" \"Just slow down, go look at the Christmas lights, go walk in the the park and just take in the beauty of what is out here for us,\" said Morgan.",

    "text": "Well, I guess after 2 years plus it had to happen. P was due a sigmoidoscopy on 30 Dec. Checking through the paperwork on 26 Dec I find he should have stopped the iron tablets on 23 Dec in preparation for the sigmoidoscopy on 30th. I feel so guilty wasting the hospital's time but the appointment nurse was very understanding and we have a rescheduled date - 21 Jan. I am now finding the keeping up to date with when he has to take or stop taking which medication when etc etc very confusing. I feel so bad that I'd got these iron tablets wrong. I've made up a spreadsheet to cover his heart, colon cancer, lung cancer, eye and ear medicines so that shouldn't happen but I still feel guilty. I'm beginning to think that I've become a nuisance to this forum too. If so - I'm sorry.

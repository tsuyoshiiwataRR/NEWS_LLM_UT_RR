    "text": "A 12-bed drug detox and treatment facility that was expected open by November in Peterborough’s northeast end is still not open: the building is under extensive renovation, with a completion date (and an opening) expected by the end of March. The location is 24 Paddock Wood, a large house off Armour Road. It needs far more upgrades than originally planned, said Peterborough-Kawartha MPP Dave Smith. The Ontario government is helping to fund the facility, along with money from the city and County of Peterborough — and there’s an expectation to have it open by the end of the fiscal year (March 31). “There’s been some renovation challenges on it,” Smith said, of the building. He said city building officials have required the property to reach clinic-grade standards — and that hadn’t been anticipated. For years, 24 Paddock Wood had been the location of the Canadian Mental Health Association’s Safe Beds program, a non-medical program that allows people a temporary stay in times of crisis. The Safe Beds program has moved to a new location near downtown Peterborough (no address has been disclosed by the CMHA, for privacy reasons). You might be interested in Meantime Smith said it was expected that 24 Paddock Wood would need no more than “minor (building) modifications” to make it a 12-bed residential facility: six beds for drug withdrawal management, and six beds for people in drug treatment. That’s because the house had previously served for non-medical stays for people in crisis — and this was a similar use. But there is also drug withdrawal management to be offered, and Smith said city building officials wanted the facility to meet standards meant for medical clinics — and that means specialized fire suppression systems, for example. Smith said that some other municipalities haven’t required a clinic-grade building for this type of drug treatment and detox, which focuses very much on social therapy. But he said Peterborough officials “made the decision, for safety reasons,” to require clinic standards. “And that meant the tradespeople that we had to bring in for it were more in demand,” Smith said. “It (the renovation) has been significantly slower.” The renovation cost also escalated from about $120,000 to nearly $750,000, Smith said. He said the plan is to take unspent operational funding — unspent, since the facility was planned for a fall opening — and apply it to the renovation. Meantime Smith thinks the more extensive upgrades will pay off in the end. If the building is a up to medical clinic standards from the outset, he said, more detox services could be added later without need for further renovations. “It means putting in the work upfront — but it gives us the ability to expand at some point in the future,” Smith said. “And I think that's a good thing.” It was on May 2 at the CMHA offices on George Street that MPP Smith and Associate Minister for Mental Health and Addictions Michael Tibollo announced $1.138 million to operate six detox beds and six residential treatment beds as a two-year pilot program. Later, Peterborough city and county each voted to offer $200,000 to get the facility up and running. CMHA is expected to be the landlord and manager of the facility, while the local addiction services agency FourCast will run the programs. In his year-end interview Thursday, Smith said that working toward the funding announcement for the detox facility was his highlight of 2023. And he said he’s looking forward to an opening of the facility in early 2024, sometime prior to March 31. “We still are on pace to have it open before the end of the fiscal year.”",

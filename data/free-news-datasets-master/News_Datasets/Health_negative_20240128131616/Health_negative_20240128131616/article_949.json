    "text": "(Atlantic) While the Holidays are a time of celebration and joy for a lot of people, it can also be a period of stress, sadness, or loneliness. According to Senior Life Solutions Program Therapist Kacey Peterson, The impact of the holidays on mental health lasts beyond Christmas Day. Peterson says there are five strategies that can help support your mental health. The next strategy is to develop a plan. This plan includes recognizing if you are someone who suffers from seasonal mood changes. If you do, Peterson recommends determining your triggers and thinking of ways to respond if the holidays are difficult. Peterson added, “Doing things you value can make the difficult moments a little more manageable.” The third strategy includes getting involved with your community. The fourth strategy is to practice some self care, by prioritizing your health and well being. Peterson says this can include “watching your diet, getting plenty of rest, spending time in nature, practicing stress management skills, and staying away from substances like alcohol and drugs.” The final strategy focuses on seeking help from those around you.

    "text": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) - The deadline for a major house bill banning gender-changing care for minors is in its final days. The bill would also prevent transwomen from playing on girl's sports teams. Local activists and politicians said they are waiting for a decision. If Governor DeWine doesn't take action, House Bill 68 could go into effect without his signature. So, the only option for opponents of the bill is for the governor to veto it. Even if it's vetoed, local republican lawmakers said they have a majority to override it. The Saving Ohio Adolescents from Experimentation, also known as SAVE and Save Women's Sports acts are sitting on the governor's desk. Republican lawmakers are hoping for DeWine's signature. But, the governor said he can't rush to make a decision. \"I donâ€™t want to leave anything unknown, and I have the obligation to get as much information as I can before I make a decision,\" DeWine said. Republican Representative Adam Mathews, a co-sponsor of the bill, said the time has been well spent, and now it's time for Dewine to sign. If he does, Mathews adds it'll bring fairness to sports that isn't there now. \"Just like 13-year-olds have their own age limits versus 10-year-olds, we have men and women's sports because on average, there is going to be variation,\" Mathews (R) Lebanon said. The sports piece of the bill wasn't in the initial draft. It was HB 6 and later combined with gender-affirming care. Trans-rights advocates said medical options for trans youth are vital. \"We're talking about two different topics here. We're talking about sports recreation, and we're talking about life or death. That's big. Those two don't need to be grouped together,\" said PFLAG Cincinnati President Tom Sauer said. Children already receiving gender treatment would be able to continue it. That includes puberty blockers and hormone therapy. \"Those future kids won't be given the opportunity, and those future kids are some of the individuals that these major medical groups, like the American Medical Association, is saying they're going to need this care,\" Sauer said. Representative Mathews disagrees. He said the bill will protect children from surgeries that can't be undone. \"It recognizes men and women as both beautiful, but different and protects families [and] protects children,\" Mathews said. Trans-rights advocates said they'll try to get the law overturned if Dewine signs. Bill co-sponsors said the house has a veto majority. Ohio would join 22 other states that have a law or policy banning youth gender-affirming care. House Bill 68 only impacts trans-athletes playing on female sports teams.",

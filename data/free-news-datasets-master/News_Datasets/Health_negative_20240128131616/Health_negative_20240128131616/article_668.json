    "text": "West Greenville food pantry battling growing food insecurity According to area nonprofits, hunger is consuming the upstate. And as inflation rises, more men and women rely on food pantries and other resources to make ends meet. St. Anthony of Padua relies fully on its parishioners and outside donations to feed the many people who walk to their pantry doors four times a week. But the need in West Greenville is growing and showing no signs of stopping. Thursday, volunteers loaded freezers with donations, bags with food, and food pantry goers like Lenita Copeland with what they'll need for the weekend. \"Due to the economy, you know they help out with a lot of things, especially food,\" Copeland. \"When it gets a little tight, you have these people here to lean on, so you don't have to be without.\" St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church has fed the community for more than eight years decades and officially opened its pantry about 25 years ago. But over the past couple years, they've gone from just a few regulars to about 180 bags of food a day. \"I don't really know what the numbers were when I started, but it's gone up every month since I've been here,\" said Jane Guthrie, a volunteer. \"I think COVID had a lot to do with people out of work,\" said Jay Pitts, head of Ministry and Stewardship. U.S. inflation rose dramatically in 2021, coinciding with an increase in area homelessness and poverty levels, according to the Greenville Homeless Alliance. Though inflation has come down, many people are still recovering. \"Everybody we give food to is not homeless. There's just a lot of food insecurity with the cost of groceries now,\" Guthrie said. As hunger in West Greenville consumes more community members, St. Anthony of Padua feeds them out of a closet, relying on the generosity of others to fill it each week. \"We'd like a bigger space, but we're still able to do what we do,\" Pitts said. The church is planning to move into a bigger facility in the near future to accommodate newfound need. If you'd like to learn more, donate your time, food, or money, click this link.",

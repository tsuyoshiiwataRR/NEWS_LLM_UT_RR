    "text": "Traffic stop leads to meth, fentanyl seizure in West Glenwood A routine traffic stop by the Garfield County Sheriff’s Office led to an unexpected drug seizure on Dec. 23, involving a suspect identified as Jason Perpich. Perpich was arrested for possessing more than an ounce of meth and nearly a half ounce of fentanyl, along with a small amount of alprazolam. Perpich is facing multiple charges, including three counts of unlawful distribution, one count of distribution of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, and an improperly attached license plate. At around 7:45 p.m. Garfield County sheriffs noticed a dark-colored SUV with its rear hatch open, driving hazardously on Gilstrap Court in West Glenwood. The SUV, seemingly loaded with items at risk of falling out, was followed by Garfield County officers as it entered Interstate 70 heading east. The vehicle lacked visible registration, arrest records show. The SUV exited the interstate at the 116 eastbound exit pulled into the Kum and Go parking lot on 105 Sixth Street. Approaching the vehicle, a Garfield County sheriff noticed a plastic taped-up window. The driver, later identified as Perpich, informed officers of the broken window. Perpich appeared nervous and acted oddly, according to the affidavit. He claimed to be unaware of the open hatch, attributing it to a friend at a hotel in Glenwood Springs. During their interaction, sheriffs observed small tin foil sections in the vehicle, which he recognized as potential drug paraphernalia. Perpich denied having weapons in the vehicle, mentioning only a kid’s bow and arrow. A probable cause search was conducted after Perpich denied consent for a vehicle search. Sheriffs discovered a meth pipe with residue, two glass jars with white pills, and a bag of an unknown white crystalline substance. A field test identified the substance as meth, weighing 26.47 grams. Further search yielded a smaller bag containing 3.89 grams of methamphetamine, white pills stamped with M-30 in a glass bottle tested positive for fentanyl, weighing 10.99 grams. Additionally, oval-shaped pills found in an orange pill bottle weighed 1.71 grams and tested positive for alprazolam, a schedule four substance.

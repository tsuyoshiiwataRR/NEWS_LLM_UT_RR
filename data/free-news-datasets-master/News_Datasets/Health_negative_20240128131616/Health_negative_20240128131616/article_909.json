    "text": "A federal judge acquitted a Gambrills physician last week in a rare ruling that cast aside a jury’s August verdict that found the doctor guilty of multiple health care fraud counts. U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar, who presided over the three-week trial this summer, wrote in his decision that he found the case’s record “lacks evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that” certain statements made by Dr. Ron Elfenbein, the former director of an urgent care chain headquartered in Gambrills, were false. The judge noted in his Dec. 21 memorandum that he “does not take lightly” his decision to throw aside the jury’s guilty verdict on the Medicare billing fraud counts for submitting more than $15 million in claims, which the government alleged were fraudulent, for patients who received COVID-19 tests. “This is the rare case that merits overturning the jury’s verdict,” he wrote, adding that having observed the trial and having “carefully parsed” the case’s record, he concluded “that [the jury’s verdict](https://www.baltimoresun.com/2023/08/08/gambrills-doctor-convicted-of-health-care-fraud-after-covid-19-test-scheme/) cannot stand.” A spokesperson for the Maryland U.S. Attorney’s office said prosecutors had no comment on Bredar’s decision, which also conditionally granted defense attorneys’ request to give Elfenbein a new trial in the event the Department of Justice wins an appeal of the decision. Prosecutors had not filed any notice that they intended to appeal the case as of Thursday afternoon. Elfenbein, a doctor from Arnold who opened the Gambrills-based chain of First Call Medical Center locations after multiple runs for office, now “looks forward to getting his life back together,” former Baltimore State’s Attorney Gregg Bernstein, part of the physician’s defense team, said Thursday. He said Elfenbein and his legal team were “of course thrilled by Judge Bredar’s very thoughtful, detailed and comprehensive decision,” which he said agreed with “what we believed all along, which was that Dr. Elfenbein is innocent.” The former emergency care physician resigned from his position as medical director of the urgent care chain after being indicted in April 2022 on charges stemming from his company’s billing claims. Federal prosecutors alleged the urgent care facility billed insurers for complex medical procedures when the establishment had simply given patients COVID-19 tests. The doctor’s indictment turned attention to then-Del. Sid Saab, who was [connected](https://www.capitalgazette.com/2019/04/24/anne-arundel-county-delegate-posts-advertisements-tries-to-sell-car-on-official-social-media/) to the urgent care business but [resisted](https://www.baltimoresun.com/2023/08/08/gambrills-doctor-convicted-of-health-care-fraud-after-covid-19-test-scheme/) [questions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/04/23/maryland-covid-fraud/) about the scope of his involvement. The Republican candidate sued his opponent in that year’s general election for defamation, in part referencing campaign mailers — which were not actually sent by Sen. Dawn Gile — connecting Saab to Elfenbein’s indictment. He dropped the suit after [losing to Gile](https://www.baltimoresun.com/2022/11/16/annapolis-state-sen-sarah-elfreth-declares-victory-dawn-gile-overtakes-sid-saab-in-district-33-senate-race/), a Severna Park Democrat. Federal prosecutors later expanded the charges to include allegations the urgent care chain fraudulently billed other insurers, like Medicaid, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield and the Health Resources and Services Administration COVID-19 Uninsured Program. Awaiting sentencing after the jury’s Aug. 4 verdict, Elfenbein faced a maximum penalty of 10 years in federal prison for each of the five counts. The sentencing hearing, originally scheduled for November, was put off as Bredar considered defense attorneys’ motion to acquit the physician. Much of the government’s case hinged on the urgent care chain’s use of certain medical billing codes, which prosecutors alleged overcharged the insurers. Elfenbein’s defense team argued during the trial, and in their argument to acquit the doctor, that there was enough ambiguity in the definitions of the billing codes that prosecutors could not establish that the urgent care falsely submitted claims under the wrong key. In his decision last week, Bredar sided with the defense team, finding “the evidence does not support the jury’s apparent finding that billing” at a different level for the COVID-19 tests “was false or fraudulent.”",

    "text": "The Health Service Executive (HSE) has issued a warning as a surge in Covid-19 cases has led to 30 outbreaks in hospitals. The number of people visiting emergency departments with Covid-19 infections has doubled this week, with 54 outbreaks reported in hospitals and nursing homes nationwide. There's also been a 72% rise in patients presenting with flu symptoms over the past week. The HSE warns that infection numbers are likely to keep rising in the coming weeks. This week, emergency departments treated 538 people with flu and 282 with Covid-19. This is a significant increase from the previous week, which saw 312 flu patients and 144 Covid-19 patients, the [Irish Mirror reports](https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/hse-issues-warning-covid-19-31764250).

The HSE emphasises that everyone must do their part to prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. \"Hospitals and community services around the country have put a sustained effort into ensuring hospitals are positioned for the traditional post-Christmas demand,\" said a spokesperson. However, they warned that the rise in flu and Covid infections is very steep. They urged the public to only visit the Emergency Department for major health emergencies and to use other options for non-emergency situations. People are advised to utilise local pharmacies and check the HSE.ie website before going to their GP or ED if they have respiratory symptoms. The HSE also advises people to get vaccinated at their GP clinic or pharmacy. \"If you are unwell, you should stay at home until 48 hours after your major symptoms have resolved; avoid visiting people who are more vulnerable if you are unwell, especially avoid visiting hospitals or nursing homes.\" Dr Colm Henry, the HSE's chief clinical officer, warned that rising flu and Covid rates will put \"significant pressure\" on hospitals and care homes. He said: \"Our emergency departments are expected to encounter significant pressures as a result and we know from experience that a delayed peak in flu season such as we are seeing now, will inevitably lead to further pressures throughout the healthcare system with heightened risk of outbreaks in all facilities and delays discharging patients to nursing homes or step down facilities if they have flu or Covid,\" He added: \"Vaccination remains the best way to reduce the incidence of these respiratory illnesses. The HSE is urging every eligible person to get vaccinated against flu and Covid as soon as possible.\" Join the Daily Star's WhatsApp for the sexiest headlines, showbiz gossip and lots more The Daily Star is now on WhatsApp and we want you to join us!

The new JN.1 variant of Covid-19 is fast becoming the dominant strain, and is more transmissible, resulting in more infections, according to Dr Eamonn O'Moore, director of national health promotion. \"We are still collating data in Ireland and internationally on whether it will result in more illness requiring hospital care but at this time we are not seeing that signal. However, with more infection around, there is greater risk some people who are vulnerable could become ill and require hospital care and we still need to protect our vulnerable members of society, children and adults, by doing what we can to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.\" * This article was crafted with the help of an AI tool, which speeds up Daily Star's editorial research.

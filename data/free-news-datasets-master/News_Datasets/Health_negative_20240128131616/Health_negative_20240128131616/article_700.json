    "text": "About 246 Vermonters look their lives in 2020-21, most of them men (eight in 10) over the age of 25.\nThat was among the findings of an extensive study released this fall by the Vermont Department of Health that also found the highest rate of suicide among those who are single, never married, or divorced; those with a high school education or less; and those who live in rural areas of the state. Veterans had a suicide rate more than triple non-veterans, the study found.\nThe report is driven by numbers, but the authors noted the humanity behind the statistics.\n“This report is dedicated to the many Vermonters who have died by suicide and their loved ones. While the work is data-driven, we must not lose sight of the fact that each data point is far more than that,” the report opened. “We believe that the findings and recommendations within this document are valuable to informing our collective work to prevent future losses of life due to suicide.”\nThe report took two years to create, using data was collected during the pandemic years, although it’s unclear what impact COVID had on the suicide rate.\nOn an optimistic note, although it's too early to predict trends, the numbers will be down for 2022; they are unknown for 2023, according to Stephanie Busch of the Health Department.\nFunded in part by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this first-ever project was spearheaded by the Health Department, with participation from the Department of Mental Health, Area Agencies on Aging, The Green Mountain Care Board, and other state departments.\nThe group documented the statistics and put forward recommendations for trying to reduce the upward trend.\n\"It was a massive project,\" Busch said Thursday. She said the department is trying to get the information out to all the agencies and communities in Vermont, adding, \"All communities are impacted by a suicide death and we all have a part in coming together and facing suicide prevention.\"\nShe said it's important that people who are struggling – and those around them who recognize that struggle – know that help is available and how to access it.\n\"It’s OK to ask for help,\" she said, \"and help is there. People don’t have to be alone.\" [Information on locating confidential help 24/7 can be found at the bottom of this story.]\nAccording to the findings, firearms account for more than half of suicide deaths, followed by hanging and poisoning.\nAbout 76 percent had health insurance and had seen a medical professional within a year of death (35 percent had been to an emergency room within a year of death) — most within a few months of passing. Within a year of death, 17 percent of people who died interacted with emergency medical services, the study found.\nIn addition, according to the report, people who died by suicide were more likely to have a prescription for a controlled substance within a year of death.\nOf people who died by suicide, 45 percent experienced a crisis within two weeks of death (relationship, financial or health problem, for example); 22 percent had a court case within a year of death — often relief from abuse orders, a recent divorce or dissolution, felonies, misdemeanors, and civil suspensions. A significant percentage were 65 and older.\nVermont data shows that Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) and youth populations have high suicide morbidity (health issue), but the data doesn’t demonstrate high mortality (deaths). Vermont data also shows that individuals who identify as LGBTQAI+ have high suicide morbidity, but the data sources used in this analysis may not reliably capture sexual orientation or gender identity.\nAmong the recommendations (see the full report for a complete list and details):\n• Link all levels of care -- primary care, emergency departments, inpatient programs, emergency medical services, mental health services, substance use services, pharmacies, geriatric specialists and telehealth/telemental health providers – aiming for a Zero Suicide framework. Expand screening, intervention and prevention.\n• Better integrate state and local prevention and response efforts. Collaborate with the Veteran’s Affairs and Vermont National Guard to expand identification and support of service members and veterans at risk of suicide, including younger veterans and their families. Expand supports for telemental health when treating suicidality.\n• Continue and expand data collection.\n\"This report is the first of its kind of us,\" Busch said. She said all the different groups involved are still studying the information and working on ways to use the information going forward.\n“Suicide is an important public health issue facing Vermont. Approximately 120 Vermonters die by suicide each year, and Vermont’s suicide rate has been increasing over the past 18 years,” the report stated. But the problem is far from limited to those who take their lives. “For each of these suicide deaths, countless other Vermont family members, friends and colleagues are greatly impacted.”\nMore information is available at\nfacingsuicidevt.com.

[Try for £1](https://www.mailsubscriptions.co.uk/products/197224/1-for-3-months-then-12.99-a-month) [Sign in] ANGE POSTECOGLOU blamed the tiredness of his injury-ravaged Tottenham squad after they suffered a thumping 4-2 defeat at Brighton last night. ARSENAL were left furious after West Ham’s controversial opener. Here’s what the pundits said: Moyes’ men march up to sixth as Arsenal flatline TOTTENHAM icon Hugo Lloris is set to join Los Angeles FC, bringing the curtain down on his 11-year stay in north London.

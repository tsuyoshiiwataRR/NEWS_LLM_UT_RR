    "text": "Uganda President Yoweri Museveni says his wife, First Lady Janet, has tested positive for Coronavirus.\nThe long-serving Head of State, aged 79, announced on X, formerly Twitter.\nThe First Lady, referred to as Maama Janet by her husband of five decades, doubles up as the Minister for Education and Sports.\n“On Christmas day, after a family lunch, Maama Janet started feeling kukarakaatwa (sandy feeling) in the throat. We did a Rapid Corona test, which was negative. However, we sent another sample to Mbarara for PCR test and it came back positive,” explained Museveni.\n“Indeed, Maama was feeling weak, with headache sometimes and with the kukarakaatwa. Immediately, on the 26th morning, I had to carry out a test on myself so that we decided to manage the problem. The tests came back negative by afternoon.”\nThe First Lady, 75, is in isolation and has commenced treatment, the President added.\n“We, therefore, decided for Maama to self- isolate in one of the houses at Rwakyitura while I continue with the programmes that we had arranged but not ones where Maama was involved. That is why we could not go to Kyenkwanzi or to Hon. Kaboyo’s function.”\nDespite the setback, Museveni indicated that he will continue to discharge his duties.\n“What is of interest is how I remained negative despite being with Maama all these days- sharing the room, the air-conditioned car to Entebbe and back to Nakasero. Was it because I am emponoka (survivor) of Corona of last May? Maama is now a first-time corona warrior. She is doing well.”\nIn June 2023, Museveni, who has ruled Uganda for 37 years, announced he had contracted Coronavirus and consequently proceeded on ‘forced leave’.\nAt the time, the First Lady tested negative.\nCoronavirus is an infectious disease that causes patients to experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and mainly recover without requiring special treatment. The World Health Organisation (WHO) however explains that some patients can become seriously ill while older people with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, or cancer could suffer complications.\nA coronavirus outbreak in 2020 led to a global shutdown.\nAlso read: DPP consents to release of Sh400 million frozen Rwandan investors money\nKioni alleges plot to ‘illegally’ change the Constitution",

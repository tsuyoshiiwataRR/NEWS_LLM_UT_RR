    "text": "But not a very patient one!\nI've at least got a diagnosis, it's invasive ductal cancer grade 2, but still small, oestrogen receptive but looks as if I might get away with the lymph nodes....and maybe not too much treatment afterwards?\nComplex plan, but to begin with, a sentinel node (plus another one or so) removal as day surgery, (a nuclear medicine visit first to get 'the jab' for them to trace) then a gap while that, plus the HER result come back, then because of my previous surgeries for cysts and the fact one resulted in a massive haematoma, therefore scar tissue, I will have a complete mastectomy with an implant. That will be immediately after Easter.\nBy finding out as much as possible beforehand, the surgeon hopes to prevent too many operations. Obviously I will then need Tamoxifen or similar, so will appreciate helpful advice about that.\nBut I'd be interested on anyone's 'take' on her plan. I feel reassured that she took time with me, and the BC nurse afterwards spent a good while too.\nHugs xxx\nmoomy I so agree anout the smiley emoji…..so,here we are… Ninsim well done,ask anything on here any time… Snowys Mum ooooooooo ahhhhhhhhh such a happy baby.?so sorry can’t remember her adorable name.\nI saw the children on Christmas afternoon and they rushed into their back room to actually draw (a book about How to Draw,plus proper pencils and paper.\nWatched Lucy Worsley on Agatha Christie which I found on catch-up and LOVED.\nmanaged with Christmas money to buy a winter coat to wear to the lovely Choir.Got mistaken for a Teddy and Rosie was trying hard to cuddle me,but I was trying hard not to be cuddled !!(isolating as best I can).\nLP tried hard to kiss his little girlfriend under the mistletoe,but she was Not Amused and Trolloped off.Anyway…long story short…the next day these were found ….all pink and wriggley……xxx\nCrumble sounds lovely. Will have a search. Still a bit of wind this evening but not as bad as last night.\nTurkey curry was lovely and will be able to use it as a curry base - veg curry or chicken or even like a sauce with salmon I think - I like the Taming Twins website. Easy slow cooker is great with the children. In case you like a reas through recipes -\nhttps://www.tamingtwins.com\nPlenty there for supper tommorrow and goodbye turkey after that!\nNinsim ️\nWhatever cancer throws your way, we’re right there with you.\nWe’re here to provide physical, financial and emotional support.\n© Macmillan Cancer Support 2023 © Macmillan Cancer Support, registered charity in England and Wales (261017), Scotland (SC039907) and the Isle of Man (604).

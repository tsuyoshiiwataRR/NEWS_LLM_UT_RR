All the products are made by the same company.\nStory continues “The cheeses are sometimes sold as a full block or served as individual portions and may have been provided as part of a hamper you’ve purchased or been gifted,” the FSA said.\n“In some cases it’s been sold as part of a charcuterie grazing platter. It may not always be clear whether you have purchased an affected product.”\nAntonia’s family have launched an online fundraising page to support her.\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "1 of only 5 pharmacies in west Louisville is closing One of five pharmacies in west Louisville will soon close its doors. The CVS located on Portland Avenue will be closing on Jan. 18. While local store management was unable to comment, they did say that they are sad to see the store close. All CVS customers at the Portland location will now have their prescriptions transferred to the closest CVS location on Fourth Street and W Muhammad Ali Boulevard. Nearby residents said that takes 'convenient' out of 'convenience store.' \"If you go to Muhammad Ali, you're going to have to pay to park, worry if you're going to get tickets or not. I got a ticket like four weeks ago for parking down there because I picked somebody else's prescriptions up,\" said Aaron Maupin, a longtime customer at the Portland CVS. \"This is the closest place where I can get my medication, and now I'm going to have to travel a few miles,\" Don Young, who lives in the nearby Shawnee neighborhood, said. \"Without the proper transportation, it'll be hard for you to get around and everything. That's was going to hurt a lot of us around here, not being able to have the proper transportation.\" Russell neighborhood resident Yah Yah is also part of the organization Change Today Change Tomorrow, which helps to fill the gaps in resources in west Louisville. On Thursday, Yah Yah said she believes the lack of resources, like pharmacies and grocery stores, is one of the contributing factors to the high crime in west Louisville. \"The violence comes from a lack of resources. You bring the resources in, I guarantee you the violence is going to decrease because that's one of the things that people feel like they have to fight for, resources,\" Yah Yah said. Change Today Change Tomorrow already has programs in place, like their weekly free grocery giveaway, to help fill the voids in the area. Yah Yah said the new need for access to pharmacies will just be another issue the group will work to tackle. \"It's going to be tough,\" Yah Yah said. While residents are frustrated to lose another asset in the area, some are remaining optimistic. \"The West End is trying to build up a lot better, so I know they'll find something good to put in here,\" Young said. The store's final day will be Jan. 18. WLKY reached out to CVS's corporate office for comment but did not hear back.",

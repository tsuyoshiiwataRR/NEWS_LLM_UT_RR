    "text": "MESA, Ariz. - New weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are pretty popular, but they come with a warning from health experts and patients. The most common side effects of these drugs are nausea, vomiting, and fainting. But there&apos;s also been a spike in emergency room visits, including one in November at Banner Desert Medical Center in Mesa. Dave Wilhelmi has been battling Type 2 diabetes for 10 years and his doctor thought the new medicine on the block, Ozempic, might help. \"My blood sugars, my A1C were a little bit high and so this would be a better way to control my Type 2 diabetes,\" said Wilhelmi. But after a few months on Ozempic and two other diabetes drugs and increasingly higher doses, the trouble started, and it was time to get to the ER. Related \"They confirmed what I kind of suspected. I was severely dehydrated, and that can happen when you take some of these drugs.\" Dave is not alone. Poison control centers across the country are seeing a spike in calls connected to these drugs. \"Over the last couple of years, we’ve seen a doubling in the numbers of calls reported to our center,\" said Dr. Bryan Kuhn, a pharmacist and toxicologist at Banner Health. Dr. Kuhn says most issues come from a high dose to improper use. \"When we see patients taking the higher dose or if they accidentally or inadvertently take a double dose or some sort of the dose in medication, these otherwise tolerable and self-limiting symptoms can be quite uncomfortable and potentially harmful.\" Dave’s three-day hospital stay came after a bad reaction to another diabetes drug, according to his doctor. Now back at home and on the mend, Dave has a warning for other Ozempic users. \"If you wait too long, it could be fatal. I was lucky.\" Related Doctors are also urging people to stick with FDA-approved drugs , not similar drugs made at compounding pharmacies that can come with the wrong amount of ingredients. As for Dave, he’s getting back on Ozempic without the other drug that caused a bad reaction.",

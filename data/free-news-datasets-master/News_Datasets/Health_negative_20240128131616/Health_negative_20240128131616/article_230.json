    "text": "BOSTON – As we prepare to ring in the new year, health experts are worried about more than just COVID spreading this holiday season.\n\"This year is only different is that people are traveling more,\" said Mass General Hospital pediatric infectious disease expert, Dr. Vandana Madhavan. \"There are more gatherings with friends and family.\"\nThat means more opportunities for respiratory illnesses to spread, doctors warn.\nMass General Brigham is now requiring clinicians working directly with patients to mask up, and they're encouraging visitors to do the same.\n\"Not just COVID, not just flu, but all respiratory illnesses together are above the threshold of 2.85% so there's enough out there in the community that shows that wearing masks can decrease transmission,\" Madhavan explained.\nState wastewater collections show COVID cases are on the rise. The graph almost mimics the spike in cases this time last year.\n\"So COVID is what we look at in the wastewater and it is up as it was last year at this time and the year before at this time. So maybe it's settling into a pattern now,\" state Department of Public Health infectious disease medical director, Dr. Larry Madoff said.\nHealth experts admit that this time of year is always tricky. People are returning to the office from Christmas gatherings only to prepare for New Year's Eve celebrations.\nTo make matters worse, add the flu and RSV to the list of illnesses going around. Many of them share similar symptoms.\n\"There's so much overlap. Obviously, fevers, chills,\" Dr. Madhavan listed. \"Muscle aches, fatigue can be associated with any of these viruses.\"\nInfectious disease doctors are reminding people that they can still transmit respiratory illnesses before they're symptomatic.\nDr. Madoff said, \"If they have a runny nose, fever or cough, that staying home is a good idea.\"\nMore from CBS News Large Mass. hospital system bringing back masks for staff Goats at Massachusetts farms ready to eat Christmas trees Newton dentist hopes to take the fear out of appointments for kids First Night Boston preparations underway as festivities move to City Hall Plaza Tickets still available for \"Mass Millionaire Holiday Raffle​\" on January 1 In: COVID-19 Tiffany Chan Tiffany Chan is a general assignment reporter for WBZ-TV.\nTwitter",

    "text": "Invercargill mayor Nobby Clark will be undergo scheduled surgery next week following his heart attack on Wednesday. Clark suffered a minor heart attack on Wednesday afternoon and was admitted to Southland Hospital, being kept overnight as a precaution. He was taken to Dunedin hospital the following morning, where he will remain until his scheduled quadruple bypass heart surgery on January 3. Deputy Mayor Tom Campbell said in a release he has spoken to Clark, who \"remains positive.\" “I have spoken to Nobby today and he remains positive and is really chomping at the bit to get it over with and back on the road to recovery.” Campbell said he will \"take the reins\" at Council until Clark is able to return, which is expected to be in a few months time. “As we move into the New Year, I look forward to making sure there is no loss of momentum on the projects Nobby has been driving.\" Campbell said the major and his family continue to request privacy, but are grateful for the messages of support.",

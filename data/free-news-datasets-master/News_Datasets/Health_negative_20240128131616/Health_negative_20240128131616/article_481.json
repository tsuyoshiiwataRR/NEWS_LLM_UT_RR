    "text": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WICS) — As we near the end of 2023 people are getting ready for their New Year's Eve celebrations. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) partners with the Illinois State Police for their annual \"Drive sober or get pulled over\" campaign but what happens if you happen to be charged with a DUI? We break down the costs of a DUI. Driving sober during the holidays not only saves lives but it could also save you from having to pay thousands of dollars in court and attorney fees. When someone is charged with a DUI, the expenses begin before you make it to court. You could spend close to $1,000 on towing and storage fees. “If you get pulled over and you've got alcohol on your breath, I don't care what you do, you're going to get charged with DUI,\" said Springfield DUI attorney W. Scott Hanken. Hanken said first-time offenders can spend between $18,000 to $25,000 on a DUI charge. \"For a person that gets a DUI, you have to do whatever you can to avoid a conviction, because a conviction the costs that we're going to talk about skyrocket,\" Hanken said. Hanken said expenses increase drastically for repeat offenders but the biggest financial impact could be on your insurance premiums and employment status. \"The one thing that that doesn't factor in is your loss of income, loss of a job, and the impact that then has on your family. That is when it's devastating,\" he said. The Illinois Department of Transportation encourages motorists to drive sober, and if you plan to drink during the holidays it’s best to have a plan. \"A DUI can not only be expensive, it can be fatal. It can change your life, you could lose your life, and you can impact the lives in a negative way of others. Always designate a driver have a family member or friend drive you home make plans before you go out and celebrate and party,\" said IDOT spokesperson Paul Wappel. Officials say in Illinois, the first DUI conviction can result in a license suspension for six months, or a year if you refuse chemical testing. Some could also face up to a year in prison if found guilty of the misdemeanor. Both IDOT and Hanken agree that drunk driving is not worth the risk. Saying the costs of using a ride-sharing app or having a friend give you a ride are way less than having to pay for a DUI.",

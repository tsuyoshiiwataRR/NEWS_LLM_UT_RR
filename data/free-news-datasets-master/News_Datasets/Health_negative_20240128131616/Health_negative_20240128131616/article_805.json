    "text": "State officials announced that Pennsylvania's Department of Agriculture has [detected a new case of avian influenza](https://www.media.pa.gov/Pages/Agriculture_details.aspx?newsid=1362) in a game bird flock in Lower Mahanoy Township, Northumberland County. Samples from this detection are being forwarded to the USDA National Veterinary Services lab for confirmatory testing. However, the department has worked with the premises operator to respond immediately and mitigate the impact. The state Agriculture Department has quarantined the farm and established a control area around the farm. The control area covers a 10-kilometer perimeter around an infected, quarantined farm. Poultry owners in control areas are subject to testing requirements and must have permits to transport poultry, poultry products and related equipment. Anyone within three kilometers of the infected farm may not transport any poultry or egg products. Poultry and eggs continue to be safe to eat, state officials said, and human health is not at risk. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern at this time. \"While the Commonwealth has not had a case of HPAI since March 17, 2023, the Shapiro Administration and industry have remained vigilant and prepared,\" Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding said. \"In partnership with USDA and PA Animal Diagnostic Laboratory System, we quickly responded to the incident. This case is a reminder that this disease can strike anywhere, at any time, and that poultry owners must protect their birds through biosecurity and planning.\" Redding reminded backyard bird owners and poultry and egg producers to stay vigilant, especially as wild bird migration season continues, including: Practice excellent biosecurity every day. Everyone on the farm should clean clothes, scrub boots or shoes with disinfectant, and wash hands before and after contact with animals. Keep equipment and vehicles clean, including all those entering your property. Control birds and rodents who can carry and spread disease. Keep your birds inside whenever possible and minimize the chance of contact with wild birds. Clean under barn soffits and eliminate possible entry points for wild birds. Eliminate standing water that may attract wild birds.",

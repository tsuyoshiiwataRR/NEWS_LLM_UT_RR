    "text": "Jets' Allen Lazard (illness) out for Week 17 New York Jets wide receiver Allen Lazard (illness) will not play in Week 17's game against the Cleveland Browns. Lazard has been downgraded from questionable to out and will not play against Cleveland on Thursday Night Football. Look for Garrett Wilson to continue to operate as the focal point of the Jets' passing game. Wilson's Week 17 projection includes 4.9 receptions, 56.3 yards, 0.23 touchdowns, and 9.8 FanDuel points. His single-game salary is $11,500.

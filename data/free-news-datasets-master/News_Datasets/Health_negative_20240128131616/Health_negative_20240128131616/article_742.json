    "text": "How long does it take after diagnosis to start chemo? How many appts do you have to talk about chemo?\nThey confirmed I would need chemo last week as my her2 results came back positive. Had an MRI also last week to determine how big the lump is and wether to have surgery or chemo first.\nIf you have surgery first how long after you’ve had surgery will you start chemo?\nFrom your first day of chemo how long till you started to feel unwell?\nHi\nIt depends on your NHS Trust as some will have slightly more delay than others but, if they do decide on chemo first (called neo-adjuvant chemo, ie before surgery), it will be quick. I was in the chemo chair 2 weeks after my diagnosis/official results - also HER2+. Great to get the treatment so quickly but it doesn't give you a lot of time to get your head round it. Chemo wasn't really what I expected, in that I could function more than I thought I'd be able to and lead a normal life for much of it. Yes, some of it was yucky but they will give you medication to counteract nearly any side effect you might encounter.\nAll the best,\nLinda x\nPatience and faith\nIf you you go on July chemo group I have done daily updates following my 1st chemo.. currently 3 days after 2nd ..but remember everyone is different\nI had surgery on 23rd November and started chemo on 4th Jan, but I think the Christmas, New Year break slowed things down a little.\nIt depends upon the chemo regime you are having. I had fec-t. I sailed through fec, no problems. On T, I started to feel unwell (like a bad case of flu where everything aches) from about days 3/4 till days 9/10,\nBut everyone is different. My friend struggled through fec feeling nauseous but was ok on T. You just never know!\nIf you get achey you can take painkillers and there are antisickness tablets for nausea. So please don't worry. It was nowhere as bad as I expected.\nCwtches,\nGay xxx\nThey told me 7 to 10 days, I'm now on day 15 upcumming weekend with newyear day another 4 days be added, and I still haven't heard anything, and this with tripple negative in breast and both armpits, say it's more agressif still they not make a hurry with the chemo who I need to get first\nWhatever cancer throws your way, we’re right there with you.\nWe’re here to provide physical, financial and emotional support.\n© Macmillan Cancer Support 2023 © Macmillan Cancer Support, registered charity in England and Wales (261017), Scotland (SC039907) and the Isle of Man (604).

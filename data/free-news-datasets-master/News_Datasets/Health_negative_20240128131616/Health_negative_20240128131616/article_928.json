    "text": "[Parenting](https://www.upworthy.com/family/parenting/) Dad discovers his child has pinworms and now the entire internet is rethinking parenting Itâ€™s totally common and absolutely gross. If you're a parent you're likely in one of two categories: parents who have never heard of pinworms or parents who shuttered at the headline. Parents are not really given any sort of warning for all of the eyebrow raising situations that occur in childhood and one dad has found out that there was a lot left out of that non-existent parenting handbook. Justin, a dad that runs the [TikTok page drumbeatlane](https://www.tiktok.com/@drumbeatlane) took to social media to tell the world of the current nightmare fuel parenting situation he was experiencing. He's also doing parents on social media a solid by giving them a heads up on the disturbing secret plaguing the parenting worldâ€“pinworms. The viral video starts out with no trigger warning before he says though clenched teeth, \"my son has worms in his anus.\" Yeah, you read that right. It's a thing. A slightly terrifying but totally normal thing. \"No one tells you about this stuff when you're thinking about being a parent but apparently it's like super normal for a child to just have worms in his booty hole,\" Justin says. [Dr. Cerissa Key](https://www.tiktok.com/@therealdrkey), a pediatrician, chimed in on Justin's disturbing revelation and assured him and every parent watching that pinworms are a common thing that happens in young children. But she also dropped some info that other's including Justin may not have been ready to hear. \"Justin, sir. I hate to be the bearer of bad news. But if your son has worms in his booty hole, sir, politely and respectfully, you also have worms in your booty hole,\" Key reveals. Key goes on to explain that kids are \"disgusting\" and don't wash their hands well so pinworms spread easily if a child at school or daycare has them. She advises that parents stock up on the chalky banana flavored medication that clears them up and to wash everything on hot while being sure to vacuum your floors well. [@drumbeatlane] Parenting truly is just one surprise after another. But the biggest surprise to me every time something crazy happens is that it is usually super common, just no one talks about it. So Iâ€™m warning you. Your child might get worms in their anus. #justinkellough #dadsoftiktok #parentsoftiktok #momsoftiktok #parentingadvice #parenting @Justin People in the comment section of both videos were horrified that this was an actual thing while others commiserated with the stressed dad. \"I have no kids and now I'm paranoid I have pinworms with no symptoms,\" one person writes. \"I've raised 4 kids and never had this happen. Tomorrow this will be my entry on my gratitude journal,\" a mom confesses. \"Do I have kids? No...Do I even work around kids? Also no...do I still have the urge to take this medicine just in case anyways? 1 %,\" someone says. [@therealdrkey] #stitch with @Justin A about pinworms! It your kid has them, YOU have them. ðŸ˜© #pinworms #pinworm #pediatrician #momlife #itchybottom #itchyvulva #pinwormssuck #parenting Not everyone was stressed, some were thankful for the information. \"Thank you! We haven't experienced pinworms yet, but super informative and helps to make parenting normalized,\" another commenter writes. Key suggests that if your child has pinworms that the entire family should take a dose of the medication two weeks apart to make sure any left over newly hatched eggs are also killed. While you may not have been warned about pinworms, no one ever said parenting would be glamorous. It just seems people weren't prepared for how unglamorous it could get.",

    "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. ( KPTV /Gray News) - Oregon authorities say a Portland woman has been arrested and charged with animal abuse after she brought her kitten to an area animal hospital barely responsive and dyed pink.\nAccording to authorities, Elizabeth Zurcher-Wood brought the kitten into the Dove Lewis Animal Hospital on Dec. 12. The animal was suffering from hypothermia and in shock.\nZurcher-Wood reportedly told a veterinarian at the animal hospital that her cat was sick. So, she cleaned her with Windex glass cleaner, Spic and Span household cleaner and rubbing alcohol.\nThe veterinarian said the woman seemed to not understand that the chemicals she used were toxic to the cat.\nZurcher-Wood was taken into custody the following week and charged with two counts of animal abuse.\nThis is not the first time Zurcher-Wood has run into legal troubles.\nPolice said was previously arrested after trying to kidnap a child while wielding a machete.\nAccording to the Oregon Humane Society , the kitten is now healthy and is currently with a foster family.\nCopyright 2023 KPTV via Gray Media Group, Inc.

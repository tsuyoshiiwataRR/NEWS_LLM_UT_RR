    "text": "Japan app provider user data analysis reveals top goals that fizzle out after 3 days (Mainichi Japan) TOKYO -- New Year's is a time for resolutions, but some don't last as long as others, as evident in data analysis by a Yokohama-based online app provider highlighting resolutions that tend to fizzle out. Bondavi Inc., which provides lifestyle improvement apps for smartphones, has developed and provided \"habit-forming apps\" that help people set targets and improve their lifestyles. It analyzed data over a one-year period beginning in December 2022 on 552,692 app users, and extracted goals that people tended to give up on after three days. The goal that turned out to be the least successful was \"quitting smoking,\" with 71.3% of people being unable to keep going after three days. Next in line were \"going to the gym\" at 65.9%, \"dieting or fasting\" at 63.0%, \"running\" at 61.3%, and \"giving up drinking\" at 59.5%. Conversely, the goal with the fewest quitters was \"yoga,\" with just 38.5% giving up after three days. Next were \"painting practice\" at 39.5%, \"weight training (at home)\" at 41.8%, \"stretching\" at 42.6%, and \"meditation\" at 42.8%. A company representative commented, \"We found that goals along the lines of 'don't do such and such' seem to be high hurdles and easily lead to setbacks. The success rate would probably be higher if people started with small goals and hit them steadily.\" (Japanese original by Tsuyoshi Goto, Business News Department)",

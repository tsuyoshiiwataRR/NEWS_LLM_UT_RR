    "text": "James Allen Kinder, age 77, passed away on December 28, from Parkinson’s disease and dementia at the Riverwood Senior Living Center in Wisconsin Dells. Jim was born on December 2,1946 in Madison, WI. He graduated from Madison Central High School in 1965. There he was an outstanding football and basketball player under coaches and mentors John Olson and Bob Harris. He attended Iowa State University on a football scholarship. He received his bachelor’s degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his master’s degree from UW-Platteville. He spent his 30-year career doing what he loved – teaching and coaching others. He started at Madison Memorial High School coaching freshman football and at Holy Name High School working with their football, basketball, and track programs. At Pecatonica Area High School, he coached football and basketball, starting in 1973. At UW-Platteville he coached track, tennis, and served as defensive coordinator for the Pioneer football team. After the sudden death of George Chryst in 1992, he was appointed head football coach. He spent a year at Gustavus Adolphus College as defensive coordinator and finished his career as athletic director at LaFollette High School in Madison. Jim’s contributions to coaching were recognized when he was inducted into the Wisconsin Football Coaches Hall of Fame and the Pecatonica Athletic Hall of Fame.",

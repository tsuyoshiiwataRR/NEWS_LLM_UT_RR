    "text": "Our most exclusive model is hand-made by iconic guitar craftsman Makoto “Nick” Sugimoto. The J Artisan series represents the unbreakable bond between art and artist and will be released in separate runs, each with its own unique finish. The Boden design also adapts and scales extremely well to the use of various woods compared to traditional electric guitars, allowing the most discriminating musicians to appreciate and enjoy all the subtle sonic characteristics of the materials in greater detail. Visually, the modern Boden industrial design also blends seamlessly and in a complementary manner with exotic woods for aesthetic beauty. When this fusion of modern design and the very best materials and components are consummated by world class workmanship of some of the top guitar building artisans in the industry, the result is a musical instrument of the highest caliber for the true tone connoisseurs and collectors alike. .strandberg* has worked with legendary guitar builder and designer Nick Sugimoto in Japan for many years, producing some of the highest quality .strandberg* guitars in very limited quantities for the Japanese market. These Japan-only instruments were marketed and sold in the Japanese market as “J Custom” and “Master Artist” but now, these highly sought-after guitars are finally available to the rest of the world as “J Artisan” to highlight the highest level of craftsmanship of Nick Sugimoto and his small team of master builders. In high demand from rest of the world for years, these one-of-a-kind .strandberg* instruments are now finally available from .strandberg* Guitars in US and EU and a few select authorized .strandberg* dealers. Due to the extremely limited build capacity for the J Artisan, monthly quantities will be limited to 10 units per month for one year, so only 120 of these exquisite instruments will be produced from late-2023 through late-2024. After this build period for the J Artisan, production will again shift for the Japanese market only and it may be quite a while before the J Artisan becomes available for the rest of the world again. Each month’s run of 10 units will have pre-determined specifications with the highest-grade rare materials and unique finishes, making each guitar unique and unlike any other. Each instrument will have a Certificate of Authenticity signed by both Ola Strandberg and Nick Sugimoto to highlight this unique collaboration between a modern innovative guitar designer and traditional master builder.

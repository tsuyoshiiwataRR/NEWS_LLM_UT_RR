    "text": "Nikki Jurcutz warned water inside hoses that aren't running can become hot It's important to run the tap for one minute to cool the water down first Read more: Babysitter is yelled at for 'eating the kids' dinner'\nAn Australian mum and paramedic has issued a stern warning about the danger of garden hoses over summer and her 60-second rule.\nNikki Jurcutz, a former paramedic from Victoria, explained how the water inside a garden hose can reach between 55 to 60 degrees Celsius while not running out in the sun.\nWith this in mind, it’s essential to run the water for at least one minute to ensure it’s cool enough to sprinkle onto children or pets as a relief to the summer heat.\nNikki shared a video to the Tiny Hearts Education Instagram page and showed just how hot the water can quickly become.\n‘So this is your reminder: When you’re outside with your little ones and are planning to use the sprinkler or hose to cool off, run the water on the grass for 60 seconds or until the water runs cold before spraying onto anyone,’ she warned.\nMum-of-two Nikki Jurcutz (pictured), found of Tiny Hearts Education, advised to run the garden hose for at least 60 seconds before using the sprinkler to cool off in the summer\nNikki shared a video to the Tiny Hearts Education Instagram page and showed just how hot the water can quickly become and measured 47.9 degrees Celsius (right)\nIn the short clip, Nikki also included a concerning image of American boy Nicholas Woodger who suffered from painful burns to 30 per cent of his body due to scorching garden hose water.\nDominique Woodger was about to fill a kiddie pool with water in 2016 and as she turned the faucet on, hot water spewed from the sprinkler head attached to the hose, hitting her son sitting nearby.\nOn that particular day in Phoenix, temperatures outside reached 110 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius), according to KNXV.\nNikki advised to call 000 if a child sustains a burn that is bigger than 3cm, is on the face, throat, genitals, hands or airway, or is deep and blistering.\nParents should also cool the burn down with cool running water for 20 minutes while waiting for paramedics to arrive.\nIn the short clip, Nikki also included a concerning image of American boy Nicholas Woodger who suffered from painful burns to 30 per cent of his body due to scorching garden hose water\nThe video has since been viewed more than 714,000 times over 48 hours and most parents thanked Nikki for sharing the reminder.\n‘This is one of my biggest worries. Even our indoor taps burn when you run them on cold here in Brisbane so we’ve told the kids to run it for a while then test it quickly with their arm after it’s been running for a while!’ one mum wrote.\n‘Also do this before spraying the dogs too! They always run for it strait away so keep it low to the grass while it cools down,’ another said.\nA third mum wasn’t taking any chances revealed the next step she took to protect her kids.\n‘We also replaced all of our outside taps so the handle comes off to prevent the kids from turning the water on themselves,’ she said.\nBut others deemed the advice as ‘common sense’.\n‘Always test water on yourself before your toddler,’ one wrote.\n‘If you’re living in Australia that should be common knowledge! Everyone knows when it’s hot – don’t walk on the sand with bare feet!’ another said.",

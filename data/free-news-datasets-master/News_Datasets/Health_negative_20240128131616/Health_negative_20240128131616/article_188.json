    "text": "Nashville Predators’ Tyson Barrie out day-to-day with upper-body injury\nThe Nashville Predators have announced that defenseman Tyson Barrie is out day-to-day due to an upper-body injury.\nIt’s unclear as to what caused the injury, as Barrie, 32, played the entirety of his previous game on December 23rd against the Dallas Stars, but then did not play in their next game on Wednesday against the Carolina Hurricanes after the holiday break, which the Preds went on to lose 5-2. There’s also no specifics as to what the injury is.\nBarrie has had a bit of a down year with the Preds with just one goal and 10 assists for 11 points in 30 games this season, part of the reason why he’s been granted permission to talk to other teams to find a better opportunity for himself. He’s currently on pace for 30 points this season, which would be the fewest points he’s had in a season since entering the league in 2011-12.\nDespite his struggles, Barrie is still one of the more disciplined defenders in the league. Since the 2019-20 season, his 5 penalty goals above replacement is tied for 32nd in the league among defensemen.\nBarrie was a third-round pick of the Colorado Avalanche in the 2009 NHL Draft, and spent parts of eight seasons in Colorado before he was dealt to the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2019 along with Alex Kerfoot in exchange for Nazem Kadri. He spent one season there before he signed with the Edmonton Oilers in the 2020 offseason, and played there for parts of three seasons before he was dealt to the Predators as part of the return for Mattias Ekholm.\nBarrie is in the final year of a three-year contract with a $4.5 million cap hit, and will be an unrestricted free agent in the 2024 offseason.\nDante Fabbro has replaced Barrie in the Preds lineup thus far while Barrie recovers from his injury. Fabbro has two goals and five assists for seven points in 26 games this season.\nThe Preds will look to snap a streak of back-to-back losses when they face the Detroit Red Wings on Friday at 7 p.m. EST. They currently sit in the second wild card spot in the Western Conference with a 19-16-0 record.",

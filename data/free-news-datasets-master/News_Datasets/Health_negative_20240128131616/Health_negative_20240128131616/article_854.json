    "text": "People living with disabilities have been complaining about the lack of facilities to meet their special needs at airports across the country. This happens as business and leisure travellers groan over decaying airport facilities, JUSTICE OKAMGBA reports About one billion people living with disabilities are estimated to be travelling by air globally, according to the International Air Transport Association. For many of them, the travel experience is a nightmare as most airports have no provision for their special needs. In Nigeria, airports were constructed without facilities such as consumer desks, special toilet facilities, and flight display systems specifically designed for people with disabilities. PWDs have described the lack of provision of special facilities for them as discrimination against them. The challenges of accessing onboard toilets and managing special accommodation requests have continued to create a challenging environment for travellers with disabilities. While Nigerian airports often provide wheelchairs, some international airports have gone further to implement technology solutions and smartphone applications to assist people with low vision. Airports like Boise Airport in the USA and Vancouver International Airport in Canada have introduced virtual reality training, specifically designed for autistic passengers. Experts said such an innovative approach helped individuals with disabilities familiarise themselves with the airport environment, ultimately reducing stress during travel. The PUNCH reported that people with disabilities find Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos more stressful than Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja, which are the two busiest airports in Nigeria. The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority acknowledged the need for better airports and the challenges hindering progress, including inadequate finance, insufficient infrastructure, and security risks. The Federal Government has budgeted N23.1bn for the “rehabilitation and repairs” of airport facilities across the country in the 2024 fiscal year. N21.0bn has been earmarked for the rehabilitation and repairs of airports and aerodromes, with an additional N2.1bn allocated for the rehabilitation of air navigational equipment. Our correspondent cannot independently verify if these proposed rehabilitations and repairs will cater to the needs of passengers with disabilities. PWDs’ experiences A cripple and PWD advocate, Waheed Oguntade, told our correspondent that most of the country’s airports are disability-friendliness. Oguntade, who disclosed that he frequented airports like Akwa Ibom, Lagos (both local and international), Abuja, and Enugu airports, said, “I still find the Lagos airport the most disability-friendly compared to even the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, Abuja. This is what I will attribute to the level of awareness and interaction with the international community.” He urged airlines to capture PWD data during flight bookings as that would enable operators to make informed decisions and enhance airport services. “If the data of PWDs are captured during booking, this will enable airlines to make provision for the PWDs, instead of just improvising on the spot. This information will also determine the type of plane to put PWDs based on their disabilities.” According to Oguntade, the public address system is not audible enough for people with auditory impairments, especially those travelling alone. “There is a need to have an information board close to the departure gate for those with total hearing loss,” he suggested. The PWDs advocate asked the government to establish designated parking lots close to departure halls for people physically challenged persons in all airports in the country. He claimed that this would facilitate easy movement for PWDs in the airports A member of the Coalition of Disability Organisations, Susan Ihuoma, told The PUNCH that physical barriers such as stairs, narrow corridors and a lack of ramps posed challenges for individuals with mobility impairments, hindering their independent navigation through the airport. “Restrooms, seating areas, and other facilities may not be designed to accommodate various disabilities, affecting their comfort and convenience,” she stated. Ihuoma noted that individuals with certain disabilities encountered challenges with airport security measures. “For example, those with mobility issues face challenges during body scans or when they are asked to remove shoes and other items.” According to Ihuoma, many airport workers lack adequate training in communicating with individuals who are deaf or dumb. “Airport personnel are not fully aware of the specific needs of persons with disabilities, leading to a lack of appropriate assistance and support. “Access to real-time flight information, gate changes, or boarding announcements pose challenges for individuals who are blind or deaf, particularly when the information is not provided in accessible formats,” she remarked. She added some PWDs had challenges with navigating from one terminal to another or accessing transportation options like shuttles or taxis due to a lack of accessible transportation services. PWDs’ experiences in foreign airports The challenges PWDs face in airports are not limited to Nigeria. Some foreign PWDs also shared their stories. The story of Craig Nolan, who has a spinal cord defect and uses a wheelchair, suffered discrimination at the hands of airline workers staff in Melbourne, Australia informed him that he couldn’t travel alone, was published in the UK Guardian. Nolan, intending to return home to Finland, was told by airline staff that he could not travel alone as a disabled person. Despite his plans and preparations, he was taken off the flight in the middle of the night, leaving him stranded without a clear solution. After he was ejected from the plane, Nolan had nowhere to go. After negotiations with the airline, he was given an accommodation. The incident involving Nolan was one of the evidence presented to the Disability Royal Commission, revealing systemic challenges faced by Australians with disabilities in air travel. A quadriplegic passenger, Victoria Brignell, shared how her experience when she left on a plane for over an hour and a half upon landing at Gatwick Airport, London. Brignell, who had pre-booked assistance three months in advance, said she had to wait for a long time because the assistance she required to disembark the plane did not arrive as scheduled. Despite reminders two weeks before her journey, the service was not provided promptly. “I can’t use my arms or legs. To get off a plane I need two people to lift me from the airplane seat into an aisle chair, which is a specially-designed narrow wheelchair to push me along the aisle off the plane and lift me into my wheelchair waiting outside,” Brignell. She criticised Gatwick Airport for failing to provide the necessary support, adding that the delay not only affected her but also inconvenienced other passengers awaiting their flights. “I have been very nervous about travelling by plane because I had heard so many horrible stories about people’s chairs going missing,” he disclosed. Brignell said British Airways staffers got her off the plane and she received an apology from Gatwick via Twitter, but she planned to submit an official complaint. “As a disabled person, I now expect to be treated poorly in airports. I have experienced inaccessible air travel many times,” Celestine Fraser wrote in a column on Metro UK, published on Oct 17, 2021. According to Fraser, her first ugly experience at the airport was when she and her family travelled to Morocco. She disclosed that dropped out of the university, because of a series of health problems. “Looking back, I can’t help but see it as my rude awakening into life as a disabled person — disabled not by my body, but by barriers in society,” the 18-year-old noted. Fraser said that on arrival at the airport, her brothers suggested that she sat on the luggage trolley like it was a makeshift wheelchair, wheeling her through the airport to the special assistance desk, where she was given a real wheelchair, pushed through security, and given priority to board the plane. “So far smooth enough. It was when we landed that I faced my second barrier; this one attitudinal. I was met by a special assistance attendant who wore a permanent smirk and kept asking me why I needed the wheelchair,” she narrated. According to Fraser, at the time, he hadn’t had any diagnosis yet, and she struggled to give a perfect answer to the airport attendant. She explained, “I told him simply that ‘I had an illness that makes it hard for me to walk’, to which he replied that I was ‘too young’ and looked ‘too well’ to need a wheelchair. I felt ashamed, like I was somehow guilty, and I worried that maybe I would never be believed, because my illness was invisible. “The attendant wheeled me reluctantly through security. Then suddenly, without a word he disappeared, leaving me in the corner of the airport, my wheelchair facing a wall. The experience was humiliating. “When my family eventually found me – as they had to go through separately – they were shocked, but we were still all new to the lived reality of being disabled. We brushed this off as a singular bad experience and didn’t complain.” Fraser believed disabled people don’t have to disclose the intimate details of their medical conditions just to get the basic access that they deserve. Fraser also shared another ugly experience at the airport in 2018, this time in her home country, Italy. She disclosed that she was in return flight from Madeira, Portugal, when flight attendants announced that all passengers requiring special assistance would be driven to passport control in a separate buggy. “All the PWD were isolated from their friends and families but assured that they would soon be reunited. “After a long wait on the plane, they were made to board a small van and were driven to a room just off the tarmac. “An attendant told us that someone would come and pick us up; then she left, locking the doors behind her. The only exit was a towering staircase, which clearly, none of us could climb,” Fraser enunciated. According to her, they had to wait, “I phoned my family and they tried to find me, but none of us could work out what room I was in, and the airport staff were no help in trying to reunite us”. Fraser said they were there for almost two hours before they were picked up, adding that some of them missed their connecting flights. She noted, “Once we got home, we complained — but the short apologetic email did little to alleviate the harm that was caused.” The airport blamed the airline and the airline blamed the airport. There was no explanation, and certainly no compensation. “But these experiences are not mine alone. They happen to disabled travellers all the time,” Fraser wrote. People like Fraser are requesting for the right things to be done at the various airports in the globe for PWD. She concluded, “Because disabled people are not asking for seats in business class or complimentary champagne. “What we want is simple: To safely board a plane. Order an overpriced Bloody Mary. Get tipsy with the altitude. Empty our bladders. And land on the ground with our wheelchairs – and our dignity – intact. That doesn’t sound like special assistance. It sounds like a human right.” The PUNCH contacted Fraser but she declined to provide more details. However, Fraser responded, I’m afraid I won’t be able to help you with this story as it has now been years since I have travelled abroad by plane. So, I don’t feel I can provide an honest and up-to-date insight into what air travel is currently like for disabled people.” Poor facilities PWDs are not the only ones concerned by the poor state of transportation facilities in Nigerian airports. Chijioke Ejemba, a frequent air traveller, expressed worry about the deteriorating state of transportation facilities at Murtala Muhammed International Airport. He complained about non-functional buses and malfunctioning toll gates, leading to severe passenger inconvenience. Ejemba pointed out that all buses designated to shuttle passengers between parking lots and the airport were out of service due to a lack of maintenance. “They were all bought brand new some years back. Passengers have to trek miles to move from the parking lot to airport and vice versa. “I was unfortunate enough to have been at the airport recently and I ended up with severe back pain due to the trekking and load I tagged along,” Ejemba said. Another passenger, Raphael Falola decried the unprofessional conduct of customs officers at Murtala Muhammed International Airport, emphasising the stark contrast between the entry processes for Nigerians and non-Nigerians. “It is so sad that in Nigeria the process of entry is easier for foreigners than Nigerians! We talk about the ease of doing business, display SERVICOM banners at the airport and say nice things but we are wicked to ourselves,” he noted. Despite global advancements in electronic and efficient services, he lamented that the officials still expect gratification. This, according to Falola, contributed to a nearly two-hour wait in the passport queue after his 8 pm scheduled landing. “What is the KPI for these officials? What do they really understand by service delivery? Do they realise that their conduct is enough to put sand in the mouth of any visitor?” he queried. Beyond customs issues, Falola criticised the management of the airport, describing his experience as “horrid.” He highlighted poorly lit exit tunnels, security risks posed by rogues and unfamiliar faces harassing travelers. He stressed the need to create a positive and secure experience for travellers, especially at the port of welcome for those entering Nigeria. Falola urged the airport management to take immediate action to address those issues, to enable the airport to be run more efficiently. Another foreign traveller identified as Diani Ski, recounted an experience at the Lagos airport, dubbing it “possibly the worst in the world. He complained about the lack of transit facilities, coupled with intimidating encounters with military-looking personnel. The traveller, en route to The Gambia, said he faced a daunting situation with only two hours before departure. “We asked the military-looking guy directing people to immigration controls that we were in transit and where we could pick our boarding passes for our en route flight. “He told us that we had to go through immigration. He was very intimidating and aggressive,” he narrated. Despite explaining the lack of visas and the urgency to catch their connecting flight, Ski said they were coerced into going through immigration, ultimately finding themselves in Nigeria illegally. He noted, “We were taken to the Air Nigeria departure section, where there was a passport controls check. One of the personnel told my partner, who has a British passport that he needed a visa to go to the Gambia. “Despite providing evidence to the contrary, Ski and her partner faced unnecessary complications. Luckily he had gone to the Gambia the previous month and his visa had not expired.” According to Ski, the security checks added to the distress, with an incident where money was openly solicited during a bag inspection. “As we boarded our flight, there was a security check where the lady checking my bags openly asked me to give her money. I managed to wangle my way out of it. I was extremely relieved to be on the plane,” he added. The traveller expressed relief upon boarding the flight, highlighting the oppressive heat and stuffiness within the airport. However, the nightmare extended with delayed baggage, which only arrived two days later. Despite the challenges, the bags remained intact, providing a surprising silver lining to an otherwise nightmarish experience, Ski added. Further, the traveller drew a sharp contrast upon arriving in The Gambia, where staff exhibited friendliness and warmth “Staff was nice and friendly. If you can avoid it, try to connect through a different country even if it takes longer. Our bags only arrived two days later! None of them had been broken into which I am surprised about,” Ski concluded. In a review on TripAdvisor, one of the largest travel websites, an Australian traveler simply identified as Jenny B recounted her experience at Murtala Muhammed International Airport, labelling it as the “very worst airport” she has ever encountered. Jenny expressed frustration over the absence of a proper transit system at the airport. “They have no transit; they take your passport off you and send you to get your bags without explanation. Then, I was left to sit for two hours; they would not give my passport back to me,” he stated. A staff member, Jenny described as rude and aggressive in military-style attire, guided her through a convoluted route involving multiple stairs and outside areas. Jenny said, “He (staff member) waited impatiently at the top while I struggled up the stairs with 2 suitcases weighing 20 kilos each and an 8 kilo backpack. It was so difficult and on the last lot of stairs a kind man helped me.” Due to the extended wait, Jenny faced a delayed check-in, with the flight eventually closing. After an argument, she was finally checked in five hours after the original departure time, only to be informed that the flight was cancelled. “They take the entire planeload of people to some dodgy dirty hotel that actually seems to be a house with personal items in it.” Jenny recounted her discomfort at the makeshift hotel, describing dirty beds and shared accommodations. She said the lack of basic amenities like toilet paper and ineffective air conditioning further contributed to her dismay. “On my way back through this airport, I was scared to death, but hey, they only lost one of my suitcases this time…..and believe it or not it actually did arrive in Australia two days later, “ the Australian said. Jenny described the airport as a “debacle,” highlighting the lack of a proper transit system, issues with cleanliness and amenities, and expressing concerns about the overall quality of service. PWD law The Discrimination Against People Living with Disabilities Provision Act signed by former President Muhammadu In 2019 is aimed at safeguarding the rights of individuals with disabilities by mitigating discrimination and fostering inclusion. Additionally, it mandates public buildings to undergo necessary adjustments to accommodate people with disabilities. The convener of the Coalition of Disability Organisations, David Anyele, urged airport authorities and airline operators to ensure inclusive travel experiences for people with disabilities. “We are worried that despite the passage of the Discrimination Against People Living with Disabilities Provision Act, PWDs still struggle to access airports. “Air travel is the most convenient means for long-distance trips for Nigerians, so PWDs patronise airport services regularly, “ he stated. In the past, persons with disabilities had submitted petitions outlining alleged violations of their rights. Those petitions led the House of Representatives in 2021 to issue a directive to the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria and other pertinent agencies, instructing them to establish operational disability desks at airports. However the implementation of this directive has not alleviated the plights of PWDs in the airports.",

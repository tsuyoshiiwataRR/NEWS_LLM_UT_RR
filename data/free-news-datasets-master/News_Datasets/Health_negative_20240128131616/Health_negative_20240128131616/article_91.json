    "text": "No matter the time of year, drinking too much alcohol isn't good for you. And for many of us, the holidays are (or were) a time of overindulgence! But Consumer Reports has tips to incorporate a favorite wine, beer, or cocktail into your happy and healthy celebrations.\nMaybe you've heard that a glass of alcohol is actually good for your health. Well, new research says that's just not true.\nEveryone who drinks could probably benefit from cutting back. The latest research shows that no amount of alcohol is healthy/good for you. That said, if you stick to the current guidelines, no more than one drink a day for women or two for men, your risk of adverse health effects may be small, depending on your health situation.\nIf you have a tendency to overindulge during the holidays, take a moment to evaluate your habits and your potential risks, like your age, health, and family history. If alcohol abuse, heart disease, or cancer runs in your family, you may want to be extra cautious with how much you drink.\nGet DFW local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC DFW newsletters . While drinking too much alcohol is never a good idea, it is possible to incorporate a favorite drink into a healthy lifestyle.\nConsumer Reports has some tips for mindful ways to imbibe this holiday season.\nDrink beverages that contain lower amounts of alcohol. Use a smaller glass. Savor and enjoy your drink. And whatever your strategy, take a moment to remember why you're celebrating this season.",

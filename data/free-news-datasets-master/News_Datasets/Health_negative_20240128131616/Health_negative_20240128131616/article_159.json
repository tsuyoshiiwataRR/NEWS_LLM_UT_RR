    "text": "BANGOR -- The Hope House could be closing by next October if it does not find a new partner.\nThe announcement was made by Penobscot Community Health Care President Lori Dwyer.\nP.C.H.C. has been running the shelter for nearly 13 years since taking it over from Acadia Hospital in 2011.\nThe Hope House offers a variety of services, including health care for the homeless, mental health and transitional housing.\nDwyer says the organization is actively looking for a partner while navigating the challenges of finding funding.\n\"We wanted to give ourselves enough of a runway to be able to really have those important conversations and work really hard to identify additional funding resources because a partner organization is going to have similar challenges to us,\" said Dwyer.\nDwyer says funding has always been an issue, with the need has been growing rapidly.\nShould the Hope House close, Dwyer says the health care and transitional housing for the homeless will remain operational under P.C.H.C.\nDwyer says conversations with potential partners have gone well so far and remains optimistic the shelter will continue to be open for the foreseeable future.\nUpon finding its new partner, P.C.H.C. will continue to operate the transitional housing part of the campus, while the new partner will deal with the daily operations of the hope house.\n Recommended for you Currently in Bangor\n32° Cloudy 35° / 19° 4 AM 32° 5 AM 31° 6 AM 30° 7 AM 26° 8 AM 27° Storm Cancellations\nSubmit Cancellations Here Trending Articles Videos Articles Governor Mills responds to National Weather Service statement rebuking claim they failed to predict 12/18 storm Head on collision at Colbrook Road intersection New information in death investigation Police begin investigation into a death in Bar Harbor Waterville murder suspect found in Arkansas Hope House to close if no owner by October 2024 Man arrested for illegal firearm possession after allegedly threatening several people UPDATE: Mother and daughter have been safely located East Millinocket Fire Chief leaves position Bangor's Maddie Cyr, Callie Tennett sign to Maine track and field Videos What's on Tonight?

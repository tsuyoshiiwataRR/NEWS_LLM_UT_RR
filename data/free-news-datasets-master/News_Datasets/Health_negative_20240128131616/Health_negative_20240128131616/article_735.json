    "text": "After a successful start in December, Tottenham fell back into their mistakes on Thursday at Brighton (4-2), at the end of the Premier League's Boxing Day. Tempered by two late goals from Veliz (82') and Davies (86'), this rout prevented Spurs from climbing back into the top four, which was abandoned in November after an idyllic start to the season. But this was the Tottenham of November, the one so easily overwhelmed in defence and so inaccurate in attack. Or unlucky, like Richarlison, the man in form in recent matches, who hit the post before having two goals disallowed for offside (4', 46').\nTo discover\nPremier League fixtures and results Premier League Standings On the other hand, Brighton will have taken advantage of it at great cost. First by the young Hinshelwood (12′), brilliantly set up by the unstoppable Joao Pedro, who scored twice from the penalty spot (23′, 76′), his favourite exercise. Sublimated by Estupinan's missile (63′), the Seagulls' big win allowed De Zerbi's team, who had been struggling for two months, to move up to 8th place, six points behind Spurs, who were still as unpredictable as ever.\nFrustrated by Areola, Arsenal miss the header Later, the curiosity of the last meeting lay in the identity of the autumn champion. Leaders at Christmas, like last year, Arsenal had the opportunity to finish as autumn champions by winning against West Ham. Failure. Trapped at home by their London neighbours (0-2), the Gunners will have experienced an evening in line with their North London rivals. To a lesser extent, of course, but the ambition was quite different. Except that the very strong West Ham team, which has been regaining confidence for several months, decided otherwise.\nShowered by a first goal on the edge of Soucek (13′), the home side were once again plucked after the break, on a helmet shot from a former member of the house (Mavropanos, 55′).",

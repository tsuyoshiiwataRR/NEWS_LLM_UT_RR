    "text": "This contradicts the official announcement of the state government that he died in Germany.\nThe late Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State died in his private residence in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, Governor Lucky Aiyedatiwa said on Thursday.\nThis contradicts the official announcement of the state government that he died in Germany.\nThe new governor of the state, Aiyedatiwa disclosed this on Thursday while speaking to journalists during a condolence visit to the late Akeredolu's family in Ibadan.\nSaharaReporters reported on Wednesday that the state government while confirming the death of Akeredolu, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), said he died on Wednesday in Germany after a protracted illness.\nIn the statement issued by the state Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mrs Bamidele Ademola-Olateju, the government also said that Akeredolu died of prostate cancer.\nTitled \"It Is a sad day in Ondo State,\" the statement partly read, “With a heavy heart, the Ondo State Government announces the passing of our beloved Governor, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN, CON.\n“Mr. Governor peacefully departed from this world in the early hours of today, Wednesday, December 27, 2023. This tragedy has left behind a profound void in our hearts.\n“Governor Akeredolu answered the eternal call while receiving medical treatment in Germany. He succumbed to complications arising from protracted prostate cancer.”\nBut in contrast, the new state governor revealed that Akeredolu died in his private residence in Ibadan and not in Germany\nHe said: \"We are here, the government under my leadership, the government of Ondo State on behalf of the good people of Ondo State to pay our condolence visit to the immediate family of our former Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), who passed on yesterday in his private home here in Ibadan.\n\"Yes, we have to do this because he has always been our leader, a courageous one for that matter, one who has governed Ondo State in the last six and a half to seven years with great courage and with so many legacies that he has left behind. He is an exemplary leader, a courageous one. The leader who believed in fairness, equity and justice.\n\"A Senior Advocate of Nigeria who speaks on national issues so that adjustment and proper decision can be made concerning anything Nigeria. So he is known for that as an activist. Today he is no more; we have to pay him that respect by coming to the family to condole and commiserate.\"\nhttps://youtu.be/2A0yhsx7qII?si=JZwv1qdrMEMqw8T4",

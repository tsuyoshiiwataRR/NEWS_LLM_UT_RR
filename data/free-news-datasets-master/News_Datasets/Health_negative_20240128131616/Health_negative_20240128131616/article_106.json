    "text": "A Sterling Heights woman accused of torturing and abusing her boyfriend's 80-year-old mother will face a trial in Macomb County Circuit Court. Laura Tisdelle , 40, was charged with torture, first-degree vulnerable adult abuse, unlawful imprisonment and third-offense domestic violence. If convicted, she faces up to more than 40 years behind bars, the Macomb County Prosecutor's Office said Thursday.\nTisdelle allegedly was the sole caregiver of her boyfriend's mother while her boyfriend went on a five-day trip in June. Upon his return home, Tisdelle's boyfriend found his mother with her hands tied together, restrained to the bed, severely beaten and laying in her own urine and feces, prosecutors said.\n\"We are committed to pursuing justice for the alleged torture and abuse inflicted upon this elderly woman,\" Macomb County Prosecutor Peter Lucido said in a statement. \"This commitment drives us to passionately advocate for the dignity and well-being of individuals who are unable to protect themselves.\"\nTisdelle was initially arraigned June 23 in the 41A District Court in Sterling Heights.\nHer next court date is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on Jan. 8.\nJAimery@detroitnews.com",

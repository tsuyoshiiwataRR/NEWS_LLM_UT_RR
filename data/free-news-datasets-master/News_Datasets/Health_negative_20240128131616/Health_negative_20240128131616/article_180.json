    "text": "CONCORD, N.H. – The New Hampshire Lottery Commission suspended the gaming license of Andy Sanborn and the Concord Casino for six months starting Jan. 1, 2024, after an independent hearing officer ruled Wednesday the commission had just cause to do so. After six months, if the casino has not been sold, its license will be revoked, according to the lottery commission.\nSanborn was accused by the Attorney General’s office of fraudulently applying for a $844,000 COVID relief loan, even though casinos were not eligible to receive the money. The state alleged he spent the money on three luxury racing cars.\nAdvertisement\nMichael King, an independent hearing officer, heard the case after Sanborn’s attorneys asked the Superior Court to intervene in the lottery commission process, which they argued would not be impartial since the lottery commission had already investigated Sanborn and wanted to take his license away.\nIn his decision, King said the hearing wouldn’t determine if the application for the loan was fraudulent, but whether the information on the loan application was true.\nGet N.H. Morning Report A weekday newsletter delivering the N.H. news you need to know right to your inbox. Enter Email Sign Up “The filing of this application with clearly false and/or misleading information ‘undermines the public confidence in charitable gaming,’” wrote King in the ruling , noting that Sanborn had left the name of his business, Concord Casino, out of the application for the loan and instead used Win, Win, Win, LLC.\nInstead of saying his business was a casino or charitable gaming facility, Sanborn listed it as “miscellaneous services” on the loan application. King said this evidence showed that Sanborn intentionally omitted the information about his business because it would decrease his chances of getting the funding.\nKing also found a “straight line” from the receipt of the Economic Injury Disaster Loan money and the purchase of “equipment” totaling the amount spent on the cars, concluding that if not for the loans, Sanborn would not have purchased the vehicles.\nAdvertisement",

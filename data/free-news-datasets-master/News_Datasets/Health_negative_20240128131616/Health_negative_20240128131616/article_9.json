    "text": "Sam Mitchell has been discharged from hospital He spent Christmas in a hospital bed Hawks coach not been cleared to fly home\nSam Mitchell has been discharged from hospital in New York after spending Christmas in care.\nThe Hawthorn coach, 41, was hospitalised with a deteriorating condition of pneumonia, meaning he had to spend Christmas Day in a hospital bed.\nMitchell was admitted to New York University Hospital on December 23 and his Hawthorn players were informed of his health episode that same day,\n‘His health continues to improve and he will remain in New York until he’s in a position to fly home to Australia,’ said 7News reporter Mitch Cleary.\nCleary added that Mitchell will remain surrounded by his wife, Lyndall, and three children until he is given the all-clear to return to Melbourne.\nSam Mitchell has been discharged from hospital after he fell ill over Christmas\n‘Importantly, Sam is improving and recovering well,’ Hawks CEO Ash Klein said.\n‘The club has been in regular contact with Lyndall and we will obviously continue to support in any way we can,’ he added.\nPneumonia is a serious lung infection that’s usually caused by bacteria, a virus or even fungi.\nSufferers’ lungs swell up and their air sacs can fill with fluid, making it very difficult to breathe.\nIn extreme cases pneumonia can quickly become life-threatening, especially for elderly or very young patients, and those with heart or pre-existing lung problems.\nMitchell was holidaying after his second season in charge of Hawthorn, the club he won four flags and one Brownlow Medal with as a player.\nThe Hawks coach is surrounded by his family in New York before he will be able to fly home\nAfter taking the Hawks to 13th during his first campaign as coach, the team slipped to 16th in 2023 as the club’s rebuilding phase took its toll and left him with a very young and green list.\nMitchell raised eyebrows when he was inducted into the AFL’s Hall of Fame in June as he failed to mention his coach while he played at Hawthorn, Alastair Clarkson, in his acceptance speech.\nSome fans took it as a sign that the pair’s relationship has been badly damaged by the racism scandal that enveloped the club last year.",

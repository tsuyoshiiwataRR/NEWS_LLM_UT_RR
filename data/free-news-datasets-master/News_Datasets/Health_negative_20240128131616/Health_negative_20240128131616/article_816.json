    "text": "Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray missed practice due to an illness for the second straight day on Thursday.\nMurray wasn't dressed in football gear when spotted talking to Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon during the open portion of practice.\nMurray's status for Sunday's road game against the Philadelphia Eagles will be firmed up on Friday's injury report.\nThe 26-year-old Murray has passed for 1,305 yards with six touchdowns and four interceptions in six starts this season.\nMurray, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, missed the first nine contests of the season due to a torn ACL sustained late in the 2022 season.\nRookie Clayton Tune is receiving most of the practice workload. The fifth-round pick is 12-of-21 passing for 62 yards and two interceptions. The Cardinals were shut out 27-0 by the Cleveland Browns and had just 58 yards of total offense in Week 9 in Tune's lone start.\nReceiver Marquise Brown (heel) also missed practice for the second straight day for Arizona. Defensive end Jonathan Ledbetter (knee) was previously ruled out for the rest of the season.\nAs for the Eagles, cornerback Darius Slay (knee) has missed both practices this week and could sit out his third straight game.\n--Field Level Media",

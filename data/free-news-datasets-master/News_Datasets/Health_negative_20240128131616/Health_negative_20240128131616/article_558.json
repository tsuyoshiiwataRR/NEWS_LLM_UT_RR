    "text": "NAPLES, Fla. — The holiday season is often known for being filled with joy and cheer, but for many in recovery, it can be a time of loneliness. According to the [American Psychiatric Association](https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-public-opinion-polls), 67% of adults say they noticed a behavioral change heading into the winter season. “We don't necessarily address the kind of stress that comes with holidays,\" said Mayra Cardenas-Flynn, [Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation](https://www.hazeldenbettyford.org/locations/naples) Addiction Program manager. \"We sometimes return to what is familiar to us, which is to drinking or using any kind of drugs. Holidays are usually anxious times for everybody.\" Cardenas-Flynn tells Fox 4, the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation of Naples sees an increase in admissions to its in-patient recovery program every year around the holiday season. \"We over-commit ourselves to social gatherings or social functions and then become easily overwhelmed,\" said Cardenas-Flynn. \"Unhealthy eating is also part of what, you know, contributes to that. Grief, missing loved ones that are no longer with us during the holidays, and also financial strain.” Cardenas-Flynn says her best piece of advice is to surround yourself with loved ones who will not add to the stress the season can already bring.",

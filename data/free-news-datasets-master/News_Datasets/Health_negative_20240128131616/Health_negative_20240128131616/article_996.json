    "text": "Hi my daughter fought & (we thought) beat cervical cancer but it returned in her bowel & were told her tumour is incurable now ! She's having 3 different types of chemo so her husband & I are taking it in turns being with her& looking after their 3 young chikdren. I have fm & arthritis but was doing OK with it all until just b4 Christmas, my husband was told he needed a heart valve replacing (he has copd) then, at another hospital, got diagnosed with bowel cancer too (altho it's in the early stages) my daughter got blue lighted to hospital on Christmas day after losing so much blood she passed out, she only came out on 23rd after getting sepsis so it's been rough for her but she is so positive & a fighter the problem is my husband! I've just found out he's started smoking again (after we'd given up) his breathing is really bad so he can't do anything... Its as if he's given up & I can't help but feel angry with him.\nSorry for the rambling but I feel I'm drowning as our grandchildren are struggling without their mum so I'm caring for them, I'm helping my son in law to care for my daughter along with dealing with hubby!\nHugs to you.

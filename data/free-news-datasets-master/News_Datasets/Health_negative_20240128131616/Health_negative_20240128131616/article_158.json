    "text": "> ALBANY (TNS) — The state’s 2021 Green Amendment, which says New Yorkers have a constitutional right to “clean air and water, and a healthful environment,” has sparked at least 10 lawsuits against landfills, planned solar farms and other projects.\nNow, one of the first such suits to be filed has made it from the trial court to the appellate division. And it could prove to be an indication on how such legal actions turn out going forward.\nFiled a year ago in state Supreme Court in Monroe County (Rochester) Fresh Air for the Eastside vs. New York State and Waste Management Co. is attempting to force a large landfill there to install plastic liners and other mitigating measures. The suit names Waste Management, which operates the 300-acre landfill, one of the state’s biggest, and the state Department of Environmental Conservation, which regulates landfills.\nState Supreme Court Justice John Ark last year dismissed New York City from the suit. Much of the trash going to the landfill is shipped from the city to Monroe County by rail.\nBut the suit against the DEC was allowed to proceed, which is being appealed. And even though the Green Amendment doesn’t cover suits directly against private entities, Waste Management is involved since the court’s decision said the state could order them to provide relief to the plaintiffs.\nBoth Fresh Air for Eastside and DEC/Waste Management have agreed to a stay pending the defendants’ appeal of the case.\nLawyers for Waste Management contend that the suit amounts to micromanagement, and that the Green Amendment is too vague to order a mere citing of the law to enforce changes.\n“Micromanagement is part of the argument,” said Brian Ginsberg, a partner at the Harris Beach law firm which is representing Waste Management.\n“Tradition has been to allow the Department of Environmental Conservation to exercise discretion when enforcing laws,” he added.\nAnother point of contention is whether simply ruling that the Green Amendment requires an overall remedy, which Ginsberg argues would be too vague of an approach.\n“What does it take to make air clean or an environment healthful? Those statements are so vague that they cannot be enforced in court until the Legislature passes laws that fill in those gaps,” contends Ginsberg.\nLots of people are watching this since it could very well set a precedent in other Green Amendment lawsuits, including those against the Norlite incinerator/aggregate plant in Cohoes and the proposed Flint Mine solar farm in Greene County.\nBoth Ginsberg and the DEC’s lawyer, Brian Lusignan, have worked in the state’s solicitor general’s office where constitutional cases often land.\n“It’s going to be watched very closely,” said Nicholas Robinson, a law professor at Pace University’s Elisabeth Haub School of Law.\n“It will be persuasive to any other cases that are pending.”",

    "text": "Pharmacies across the country will cease activities this Friday . It will be at noon and will be accompanied by a summons to the Courts to file an injunction against Javier Milei's DNU which, among its numerous articles, also deregulates pharmaceutical activity.\nThis was announced by the Argentine Pharmaceutical Confederation (COFA). The appeal will be to stop the implementation of the decree of necessity and urgency that the President presented in a message broadcast on national television. \"It puts the health of Argentines in extreme vulnerability,\" they said about the consequence of the DNU on their activity.\nThe presentation, according to the president of the entity, Ricardo Pesenti, will be accompanied by a rally in front of the Palace of Courts, in the center of Buenos Aires, while pharmacies will close their shutters for an hour, starting at noon.\n\"This is not a political measure. In fact, many pharmacists voted for this government . However, we believe that there is a lack of knowledge of the serious consequences that this DNU brings,\" Pesenti said.\nPharmacies will have shutters down between 12 and 13. Photo: Fernando de la Orden\nThe presentation of the amparo measure will take place this Friday at 13 p.m. It will be done with a rally in front of the Palace of Courts, in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of San Nicolás, next to the cessation of activities in pharmacies throughout the country, between 12 and 13.\n\"With the false argument of lowering the price of medicines, the DNU leads to the destruction of the pharmaceutical profession, undermining 20 articles of Law 17,565 on professional practice,\" the Pharmaceutical Confederation said in a statement.\nWhat does the DNU say? DNU 70/2023, through the amendment of Law 17,565, eliminates the requirement that \"medicines called over-the-counter and pharmaceutical specialties, regardless of their condition of dispensing, may only be carried out throughout the territory of the Nation, in authorized pharmacies\".\nIt also leaves out the text that specified that \"so-called over-the-counter medicines must be dispensed personally at the counter by pharmacists or people authorized to dispense them,\" COFA said.\nDue to Milei's DNU, there will also be changes in pharmacies. Photo: Rafael Mario Quinteros\nAt the same time, the measure dictated by the Government opens the door to the sale of medicines in other shops. This is determined by annulling the provisions of the law, which stated that \"the sale and dispatch outside these establishments is considered illegal practice of pharmacy and, without prejudice to the penalties established by law, those who carry it out may be denounced for infringement of the Penal Code\".\n\"It also leads to the end of pharmacies that are in the most remote neighborhoods, in the villages, benefiting the chains that are concentrated in the large urban centers,\" the entity detailed.\nIn addition, he warned that, with these measures, \"medicines are not going to go down in price, because the price is set by the laboratories, not the pharmacies.\" And he added: \"What is going to happen is that the health of Argentines is made extremely vulnerable by removing sanitary controls on medicines.\"\n\"If there are deviations in quality, manufacturing problems, adulteration or counterfeiting, there is going to be no way to detect it in a timely manner or to withdraw those products from the market,\" he said.\n\"Pharmacists are essential, especially today, in a context of crisis in the health system, with an increasing demand for care. We provide fundamental services such as blood pressure control, application of vaccines, injectables, cures, medication management,\" COFA concluded.\nWith information from Télam\nAGE",

    "text": "NEW YORK, Dec. 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nWHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: BCLI) between August 15, 2022 and September 27, 2023, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important January 2, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities class action commenced by the Firm.\nSO WHAT: If you purchased Brainstorm Cell securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\nWHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Brainstorm Cell class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=19375 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than January 2, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Brainstorm Cell downplayed the severity of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) refusal to file letter; (2) Brainstorm Cell continued to conceal the risks associated with the submission of the biologics license application (“BLA”); and (3) as a result, defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\nTo join the Brainstorm Cell class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=19375 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm .\nRosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation.

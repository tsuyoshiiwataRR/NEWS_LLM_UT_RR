    "text": "Cockroaches. Just the thought of living with cockroaches gives most people the jeepers. But it seems that residents in Houston have to live with them.\nPest Gnome, a company that connects people with pest exterminators, recently ranked the most roach-infested cities in the U.S. using data from the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The study looked at “The 25 Roachiest Cities in America.”\nThe city that earned the highest average score was ranked as No. 1, or the “Roachiest,” and the lowest average score as No. 25, or “Least Roachy.”\nAt the top of the list is Houston,\nTexas. A staggering 37 percent of homes showed signs of roaches in the past 12 months. Pest Gnome attributes this high prevalence to Houston’s hot and humid climate, which provides ideal conditions for roach infestations, CW39 reported.\nAccording to Pest Gnome, the two most common types of cockroaches in Houston are the big, brown, and flying American cockroach (aka palmetto bug) and the kitchen, pantry, and sink-dwelling German cockroach.\nAnother Texas city came in second. San Antonio claimed the second position on the list, with approximately 28 percent of homes displaying signs of roaches in the past year. Rounding out the top five were Tampa, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; and Las Vegas, Nevada.\nDiscover How Affordable Peace of Mind Can Be: Get Your Life Insurance Quote Today!\n“All of these cities have sun and heat in summer, which roaches love, and winters here just don’t get that cold to kill them off,” Pest Gnome said,\nKSAT reported.\nAt the bottom, at no. 25, was Seattle, WA.\nCockroaches can also pose a health risk to humans.\n“Cockroaches are known to transfer disease pathogens, such as the various bacteria that produce ‘food poisoning’ in humans, by contaminating food, food preparation surfaces, dishes and eating utensils,” the Illinois Department of Public Health stated on its\n website.\nPhoto by Erik Karits, https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-cockroach-on-a-rock-11032990/We Love Houston photo, Flickr, by Kristina D.C.

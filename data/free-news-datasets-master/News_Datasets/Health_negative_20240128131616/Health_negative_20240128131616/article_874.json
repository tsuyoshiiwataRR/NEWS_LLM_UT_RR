    "text": "NH resident joins 17 other kidney donors in hikes up Guatemalan volcanoes NH resident joins 17 other kidney donors in hikes up Guatemalan volcanoes WOMAN RECENTLY PROVED THAT IN A BIG WAY. ON A TRIP TO GUATEMALA. THIS IS KATE HARRISON OF LIME WITH 17 OTHER KIDNEY DONORS, AS THEY RECENTLY HIKED THREE VOLCANOES IN GUATEMALA. OH MY GOSH, IT WAS JUST INCREDIBLE. KATE FUNDRAISED $36,000 TO GO, AND THIS WAS NOT A LEISURELY VACATION. THE FINAL HIKE WAS 5600FT UP IN COLD, WINDY CONDITIONS, AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TOUGH TO SHOW THE WORLD. YOU CAN STILL DO EVERYTHING YOU DID BEFORE YOUR KIDNEY DONATION. OH YEAH. YEAH, WE ACTUALLY SPENT THE NIGHT ON ONE OF THE VOLCANOES AND WE WEREN’T EXPECTING SUCH HORRENDOUS WEATHER. THE NATIONAL KIDNEY FOUNDATION SAYS 100,000 PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR A NEW KIDNEY IN THE U.S., AND EVERY DAY, 13 AMERICANS DIE WAITING FOR A TRANSPLANT FOR KATE, HER DONATION WAS TO A FELLOW LIME RESIDENT, DAVID BEAN. JUST ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO. NOW, SHE STEPPED UP, GOT TESTED AND WAS A MATCH AND DONATED AT DARTMOUTH HEALTH. EVER SINCE HER SURGERY, I’VE BEEN LIVING A TOTALLY NORMAL LIFE AND I JUST FEEL SUCH GRATITUDE THAT I WAS ABLE TO DO IT. UM, AND AND CHANGED DAVID’S LIFE AND THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE LED HER HERE TO CENTRAL AMERICA, ACHIEVING LOFTY GOALS AND SHOWING NOTHING CHANGES. HER MESSAGE TODAY. TAKE THE NEXT STEP. BE THE NEXT ONE. I GUESS THAT THERE’S REALLY NOTHING TO LOSE AND A LOT TO GAIN FROM, UM, BEING A KIDNEY DONOR AND THE NEXT TRIP FOR THIS GROUP IS TO CLIMB MOUNT KILIMANJARO IN MARCH. BUT KATE SAYS THIS WAS SUCH A PRIVILEGE.

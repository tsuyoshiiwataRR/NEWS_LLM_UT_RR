    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Emergency responders in the north told CTV News that they are concerned with the number of individuals venturing out onto the ice amid warmer weather conditions. Greater Sudbury Fire Services ' Deputy Chief Jesse Oshell said there have been several calls from concerned citizens over the past 10 to 15 days. Open water on a lake in Greater Sudbury on Dec. 28/23 amidst reports of northerners venturing onto the 'ice' in the the region. (Amanada Hick/CTV News Northern Ontario)\"So concerned citizens are calling emergency services and we do have to attend and we are attempting to speak to these individuals if they are out on to the ice,\" he said. \"We get them back to a safe location and provide education about the ice conditions at this time of year.\" Oshell said the number of calls is concerning so early in the season. \"The ice conditions are concerning, these mild temperatures, although there may be some ice on local waterways, at this time of year any ice should be considered dangerous,\" he said. The deputy fire chief said fortunately, there have been no serious injuries – but added some people have refused help. \"Individuals feel that they have traditionally gone out to the ice on this time of year and it has been safe,\" he said. \"So that messaging or understanding has to change because we are dealing with milder temperatures that are unseasonable for our climate.\" - Download the CTV News app now - Get local breaking news alerts - Daily newsletter with the top local stories emailed to your inbox Stephanie Bakalar, corporate communications officer for the Lifesaving Society told CTV News conditions have been too mild to venture out on the ice. Open water flowing through the ice on Lake Nosbonsing in 2023. (File photo/Eric Taschner/CTV News Northern Ontario)\"What'll happen is you get a bit of freezing and it melts again and creates weak, unstable ice,\" she said. \"It's definitely not suitable for people to be walking on or snowmobiling on. Anything like that. We need solid, thick, clean ice to be doing any activities on.\" Bakalar said ice thickness can be deceiving. \"You actually need a solid four inches of clean ice to be able to walk on and that increases the heavier, more people you have, the heavier vehicles you have,\" she said. The Lifesaving Society estimates 35 per cent of drownings across Canada occur between October and May – most of which are ice or weather-related. Bakalar said these drownings are preventable, emphasizing the messaging 'no ice is safe ice.' Shopping Trends The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

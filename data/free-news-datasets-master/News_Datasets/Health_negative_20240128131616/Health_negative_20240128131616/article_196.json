    "text": "A 48-year-old middle-aged man surnamed Zhang has an alcoholic habit. Not only does he suffer from alcoholic cirrhosis, he even had to have bilateral artificial hip joints replaced due to osteoporosis and femoral head necrosis. However, he mistakenly heard a friend tell him, “Supplementing more vitamin D can help.” “To preserve bones”, I actually swallowed 2-3 pills a day. As a result, I developed symptoms of “hypercalcemia” and my kidney function was only 30 points. After emergency medical treatment, I quickly stopped taking the medicine and drank a lot of fluids, and finally returned to normal values.\nChen Zhengguo, an attending physician at the Department of Hepatobiliary and Gastroenterology at Ajou University Hospital, said that because the patient was engaged in a heavy job, he would invite his friends to have two drinks after work. Over time, this accumulated and developed symptoms of alcoholic cirrhosis, which also caused osteoporosis and femoral head ischemia. Due to sexual necrosis, not only was he unable to stand for long periods of time, but it was even very painful to walk. His condition improved slightly after the replacement of an artificial hip joint, so he kept asking how to “preserve his bones.”\nUnexpectedly, a friend told the patient: “Supplementing more vitamin D can preserve bones and even prevent osteoporosis.” After hearing this, he was greatly moved, so he went to the pharmacy to buy vitamin\nhealth food. The original recommended dosage was 1 tablet per day. , but he took 2-3 tablets a day. After more than 2 months, he began to experience symptoms such as constipation, drowsiness, frequent urination, and thirst. Recently, he was found unconscious lying in the living room by his family, and he suddenly realized that something was wrong. Send him to a doctor immediately for examination.\nChen Zhengguo pointed out that after a blood test, it was found that calcium ions in the blood were as high as 14.5 mg/dl, parathyroid hormone was 3.3 pg/ml, and the renal function score directly deteriorated from more than 80 points to more than 20 points. After questioning, it was discovered that it was due to active I overdosed on vitamin D3, so I stopped taking it urgently and replenished a lot of fluids before I finally regained consciousness. I went back to the doctor a week later and the values returned to normal smoothly.\nLin Xuanren, attending physician at the Department of Nephrology and Director of the Peritoneal Dialysis Unit of Asia University Hospital, pointed out that vitamin D3 is divided into “active” and “inactive”. If we use the metaphor of a factory, inactive vitamin D3 (or nutritional vitamin D3) is like a raw material. After being processed in the factory (i.e. metabolized by the liver and kidneys), it becomes active vitamin D3, which can act on bones, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys to help bone osteogenesis and increase blood calcium concentration.\nTherefore, Lin Xuanren suggested that people should supplement with “inactive” vitamin D3. This concept is like the purchase of raw materials in large quantities. The factory will automatically adjust the product quantity so that the active vitamin D3 will not increase endlessly and will not cause calcium and phosphorus damage. If it is unbalanced, it is relatively harmless to the human body when taken too much. However, if “active” vitamin D3 is taken directly, the body will not be able to adjust. Especially when the dosage of active vitamin D3 exceeds the standard, it will often directly cause fatal hypercalcemia. Therefore, Vitamin D3 will only be used for medical purposes, such as in patients with acute hypocalcemia or hypoparathyroidism.\nChen Zhengguo and Lin Xuanren reminded that although vitamin D3 can help with osteoporosis, long-term excessive intake can also cause harm. People may wish to consume an appropriate amount of inactive vitamin D3 through sun exposure, diet, etc., in case of high blood pressure. If you have symptoms of calcium, you must seek medical advice as soon as possible to find out the underlying cause, so that you can completely cure and prevent hypercalcemia.\nReal estate related\nnews\n2023-12-28 22:01:28\n#greedy #man #swallowed #\nhealth #food #poisoned #vitamin #Doctor #Beware #kidney #damage #Good # news #Taiwan #TaiwanHot",

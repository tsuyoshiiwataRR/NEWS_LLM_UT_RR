    "text": "Friday, 29 December 2023 – 04:43 WIB\nUnited States – A 29 year old woman from the United States named Maggie Tretton is forced to live without an anus because of the chronic intestinal disease she suffers from.\nReporting from Daily Mail, Thursday, December 28 2023, Tretton was forced to ‘close’ his anus because he had suffered from Crohn’s disease from a young age. At that time, Tretton’s condition at the age of 16 had worsened and required a colostomy operation to create a new drainage tube through his stomach.\nOperation for Women to Permanently Close the Anus\nHowever, Tretton’s suffering apparently didn’t end there. The reason is, Tretton still feels pain and soreness around his anus ten years after the operation.\nInvestigating further, his intestinal tract and rectum were affected by Crohn’s disease which was eating away at him.\nBecause of this, Tretton finally had the courage to return to the operating table. He then wanted to truly end his suffering by undergoing a proctocolectomy, which is a procedure to remove the large intestine and rectum. In this operation, Tretton’s anus had to be stitched, aka ‘closed’, so that waste could be diverted to the new channel.\n“Now it’s permanent, there’s no going back. But I’ve never once regretted it because I know how bad the damage was to that area,” said Tretton\nAfter the operation, Tretton finally admitted that he could still live a normal life even though he was different from most people. Even so, Tretton had to defecate using a colostomy bag that was attached to his stomach for 24 hours.\n“I know what you might be thinking, ‘You had your anus removed. There’s no way you can look normal’. But he looked almost like a normal healthy person,” he said.\n“The only thing that is different is that there is no longer a hole there. There is no opening, it really looks like a hole is missing,” he continued.\nFor your\ninformation, Tretton suffers from severe inflammatory bowel disease which in the medical world is known as Crohn’s disease Fdyg. Crohn’s disease itself is a chronic inflammatory disease of the digestive tract which can occur from the mouth to the anus, but most often occurs in the small intestine and large intestine.\nOperation for Women to Permanently Close the Anus\nSymptoms include stomach pain and diarrhea, sometimes bloody, as well as weight loss. People with Crohn’s disease can have severe symptoms followed by periods of no symptoms that can last for weeks or years.\nThe symptoms depend on where the disease occurs and how severe it is with signs such as chronic diarrhea, often bloody and containing mucus or pus, weight loss, fever, abdominal pain and tenderness, a feeling of mass or fullness in the stomach and rectal bleeding.\nCrohn’s disease or Crohn’s disease is a disease that occurs in the long term (chronic). Crohn’s disease is a type of IBD (Inflammatory bowel disease), which is a disease of the digestive tract that requires extra attention.\nIBD is a condition that can trigger pain and cramps in the stomach and interfere with the processing of food into energy. When diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, a person may need long-term treatment.\n2023-12-28 21:43:01\n#woman #permanently #closes #anus",

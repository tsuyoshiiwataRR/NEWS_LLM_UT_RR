    "text": "Few words were more on people’s lips in 2023 than Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro.\nSuccessful weight loss medications, which work by suppressing hunger hormones, are very effective.\nBut now, experts warn that many of the nine million prescriptions given for these drugs could be, at best, useless and, at worst, putting patients at even greater risk of suffering from drug-related illnesses. weight.\nThis is because many are given courses of the medication that are too short.\nAccording to recent warnings, employers are offering insurance plans that only cover use of the drug for a short period, such as a year, to save money.\nHowever, a growing body of evidence shows that patients who stop taking weekly injectable medications quickly regain the pounds they lost.\nAbout 9 million Ozempic prescriptions were issued in early 2022 alone.\nWhat’s more, abruptly stopping medications puts patients at greater risk for weight-related health problems, such as high blood pressure, high blood glucose levels, and changes in cholesterol.\nThe effects of abruptly stopping weight-loss medications are similar to those of harmful yo-yo dieting, which causes a cycle of weight loss and regain that contributes to the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart attacks, and eating disorders.\nBrooke Boyarsky Pratt, a prescriber and CEO of the Knownwell weight loss clinic in New York, says she has seen many patients who were told they would stop taking the medication after 12 months.\n“I think it will be a compelling narrative given the number of patients who qualify for these drugs and their high cost,” he told Fierce Healthcare.\n“The difficulty is that there is no data to support that (weight loss after one year) and, in fact, the data very clearly suggests the opposite.”\nThe problem lies with healthcare companies that employers are increasingly using to get good insurance for their employees.\nOne of the most popular companies that does this is Calibrate, which primarily prescribes medications directly to patients.\nIt also works with insurance companies to get patients the drug for about $25 a month.\nMore recently, it has begun helping employers negotiate better, lower-cost insurance deals for workers.\nAs part of this, Calibrate is launching plans that provide a limited course of medications before tapering them off to patients, a way to reduce costs for the employer.\nA UK study found that people who used Wegovy experienced rapid weight loss, losing 18% of their weight in 68 weeks. They regained two-thirds of that weight, or 12% of their original body weight, in the year after stopping the weekly injections. Experts say the drug should be used throughout life to avoid weight loss\nThe most recent anti-obesity drug to hit the market was Eli Lilly’s Zebpound, a rebranding of the pharmaceutical giant’s existing type 2 diabetes drug, Mounjaro.\nBoth medications contain the active ingredient tirzepatide, which suppresses two hormones that regulate appetite, making people feel fuller for longer.\nOther blockbusters include Wegovy and Ozempic, the same drugs but in different doses containing semaglutide, which stimulates weight loss by mimicking the actions of GLP-1, or glucagon-like peptide-1, a hormone in the brain that regulates appetite and feeling of satiety. .\nWhile extremely effective at helping patients lose an average of 15 to 20 percent of their body weight, the medications cost a little more than $1,300 per package, which breaks down to nearly $270 per week or about $16,190 per anus. Insurance doesn’t always pay the bill.\nCalibrate specializes in working directly with consumers who pay a one-time fee of approximately $1,700 to gain access to personalized health counseling and, if eligible, a prescription for a weight loss medication for an additional cost per dose.\nThe company then negotiates with insurers to have patients shell out a monthly cost of $25 or less. But the company has struggled to give patients timely access to drugs amid shortages and insurers reducing coverage.\nNow, Calibrate is working with employers who provide health insurance to workers and with the insurance companies themselves.\nThe goal is to have the Calibrate program, including the medications your doctors prescribe, covered by insurance plans that employers purchase for their employees.\nCompanies like Ro and Calibrate describe their weight loss programs that include medications as the most effective approach to achieving sustainable weight loss. But they fail to make it clear that most people need to continue taking medications to maintain weight.\nBrooke Boyarsky Pratt, founder and CEO of weight loss clinic Knowwell, said\nFierce healthcare: ‘I think we’re going to see more and more LPG-1 companies that were previously business-to-consumer now selling into the employer space, claiming they have the silver bullet for spending LPG-1.\n“We’re hearing from employers everywhere that this is what they’re being told.”\nCalibrate said it has designed a program to help patients taking the drugs reduce their dosage and eventually stop taking them altogether, a benefit to insurers who would not need to cover the expensive medications indefinitely.\nA Calibrate spokesperson said: “While the current clinical paradigm for GLP-1 treatment requires lifelong medication at the highest dose, Calibrate is exploring whether members can stop taking the medication while maintaining their results.”\n“As a result, Calibrate is the first and only program with a proactive plan to get members off medications.”\nCalibrate conducted its own analysis to see if its members could maintain weight, reporting that 93 percent suffered more than 10 percent weight loss six to 12 months after starting to taper off GLP-1 medications.\nInfluencer Remi Bader said she “gained back twice as much weight” after stopping taking Ozempic, which she had been prescribed to help her deal with binge eating.\nThe latest data showing the rebound between weight loss and gain comes from a study conducted in\nJAMA, which revealed that tirzepatide, which works like Ozempic, helped patients lose about 20 percent of their body weight after 36 weeks. But when they switched to a placebo, they regained 14 percent of the weight they lost over the next 52 weeks.\nThe authors said: “At least five trials (including the present study) with various classes of drugs, including powerful anti-obesity drugs such as semaglutide, have shown substantial weight regain after smoking cessation.”\nStudies on the effects of stopping Wegovy and Ozempic have provided similar results. A 2022 study in the journal\nDiabetes, Obesity and Metabolism reported that patients taking semaglutide for 68 weeks lost an average of 17.3 percent of their body weight.\nWhen they stopped treatment, they regained 11.6 percent of the weight lost at week 120, resulting in a net weight loss of just under six percent of body weight.\nsaid Dr. Ania Jastreboff, an obesity medicine expert at Yale University.\nPeople: If you have a patient who has high blood pressure, has hypertension, and you start them on an antihypertensive medication and their blood pressure improves, what would happen if you stopped that medication?\nMedications like Ozempic and Wegovy are not a panacea for obesity, which experts say is a chronic disease that requires ongoing medication treatment as well as healthy lifestyle habits that include exercise and a healthy diet.\n‘Well, his blood pressure would go up again, and we’re not surprised. The same goes for anti-obesity medications.’\nDoctors say this is because the medications do not treat all the underlying causes of obesity, including poor lifestyle habits and a warped psychological relationship with food.\nDr Elie Jarrouge, a Houston-based metabolic disease expert, said: ‘For people taking Ozempic or Wegovy to lose weight… What is your exit strategy?\n“If you don’t work to change what you eat, not just how much you eat and your relationship with food, you’re likely to gain the weight back.”\nInfluencer Remi Bader attested to this, having regained “double the weight” she had lost while taking Ozempic.\nBader had sought treatment for binge eating disorder, which she said got much worse when she stopped taking the medication.\nShe said: “I saw a doctor and they said: it’s 100% because I took Ozempic.”\n‘It made me think I wasn’t hungry for so long that I lost some weight. I didn’t want to obsess over being in this for the long haul. I thought: I bet as soon as I get out I’ll starve again. I did and my binge eating got much worse. “So I blamed Ozempic.”",

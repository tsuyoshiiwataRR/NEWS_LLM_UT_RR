    "text": "Suzanne Kane’s Christmas took a very unexpected turn as her son fell ill.\nThe 98FM DJ revealed that her son Oisín took a bad turn, so much so that they had to bring him to hospital on St Stephen’s Day.\nToday’s top videos\nShe shares her son and two daughters Hannah and Sadie with her husband Joey Donnelly and it proved to be an anxious Christmas for the parents.\nPic: Suzanne Kane/Instagram\n‘A tale of two very different Christmas’ in our home over the past week. Also, I suppose it’s a reminder of insta v reality, especially at Christmas,’ she wrote.\nSharing a gallery of pictures from the festive season in their home, Suzanne explained: ‘We had full Christmas festivities downstairs, so much excitement for Santa and the presents. We had my family over for dinner. Lots of relief to have my Mam home and be together at Christmas.\nSuzanne Kane’s kids over Christmas. Pic: Suzanne Kane/Instagram\n‘Meanwhile, poor Ois was really unwell over Christmas with spiking fevers, we couldn’t get a hold of, he wasn’t able to get out of bed to enjoy the festive feeling, or what Santa had brought. We were really worried about him.\n‘He eventually ended up in Tallaght Hospital A&E on Stephen’s Day. A shout out to the Nurses we met who were so kind and caring to Oisín and us. We got him sorted & so grateful to the staff there,’ she wrote.\nPic: Suzanne Kane/Instagram\nThankfully her son has ‘perked up’ for the first time since falling ill.\n‘He’s working on having a better story than “I was sick all Christmas” for his school news,’ Suzanne said.\n‘So we’ll make plans to fill his “news” with lots of happiness when he goes back to school and add some more happiness to the pebbles of life. There’s always time to change your story,’ she concluded.\nSuzanne Kane with her family. Pic: Supplied\nThe broadcaster faced some hurdles with her own health this year.\nIn May she was hospitalised with pneumonia and she called it the ‘hardest month of her life’.\nYou Might Also Like\nWine Allies Vineyard\n‘My jaw completely locks’: Broacaster Suzanne Kane on keeping upbeat despite her crippling condition",

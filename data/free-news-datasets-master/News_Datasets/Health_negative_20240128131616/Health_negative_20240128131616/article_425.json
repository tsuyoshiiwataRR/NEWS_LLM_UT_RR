    "text": "The chief of the World Health Organization, that group of international bureaucrats who not only apparently protected China when the COVID-19 pandemic came out of a research lab there but demanded masks and shots for the world, now is insisting on a plant-based food supply chain to save the globe.\nWHO's Tedros: \"Our food systems are harming the health of people and planet. Food systems contribute to over 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, and account for almost one third of the global burden of disease. Transforming food systems is therefore essential\"\n[pic.twitter.com/hE8UeXEy0H]\n— The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial)\n[December 26, 2023]\nIn an online video, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, \"Our food systems are harming the health of people and planet. Food systems contribute to over 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, and account for almost one-third of the global burden of disease. Transforming food systems is therefore essential by shifting for this healthier, diversified and more plant-based diets.\"\nGet\nHe continued, \"If food systems deliver healthy diets for all we could save 8 million lives per year. WHO is committed to supporting countries to develop and implement policies to improve diets and fight climate change. I'm therefore very pleased that over 130 countries have signed the code 28 UAE Declaration on climate and health. Together, we can protect and promote the health of both people and planet.\"\nHe cited no documentation for his claims.\nA\nreport at the Post Millennial explained with the statement, he was declaring \"war on meat and traditional farming.\"\n\"A new declaration from the World Health Organization has revealed that it wants the masses to eat less meat and more plant-based foods in order to supposedly combat 'climate change,'\" the report continued.\nIt explained the comments align with a page posted by the United Nations regarding the COP28, a recent global warming conference attended by bureaucrats from around the globe who often arrived in private jets.\nThat U.N. page \"pushes for the uniting of 'global leaders behind commitments and plans to achieve the Paris Agreement,' which it falsely refers to as a 'legally binding UN treaty to tackle climate change and limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C,'\" the report said.\nActually, the report explained, the Paris Accord asks for \"non-binding commitments.\"\nFurther, the U.N. site insists on a \"transition away from fossil fuels\" and calls for nations \"to implement integrated, multisectoral solutions to deliver sustainable, climate-resilient food systems as a climate change adaptation measure.\"\nA report at Rolling Out bluntly charged the WHO chief \"wants to take away your meat.\"\nAnd there was reaction, the report said.\n\"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declares war on meat and traditional agriculture, in the name of 'fighting climate change,'\" Wide Awake Media posted, the report said.\n\"Anyone remember electing this clown to dictate what kind of agriculture and diets are permissible? Nope, me neither.\"\n\"And Dennis McCleney, a self-proclaimed \"hard-rocking, hard-riding conservative Christian,\" explained, \"The assumption that the Earth’s atmosphere is a closed system and that CO2 is a hazard is absolutely absurd. Without CO2, there would be no life on Earth. It also comprises just 0.04% of the atmosphere. Quit giving credence to these liars and elitists.\"\nIMPORTANT NOTE TO WND READERS: America – long the freest, most prosperous, powerful, altruistic and Christian nation on earth – is on the brink of destruction. Every decent and aware American adult knows this. The evidence is everywhere.\nDemocrat politicians today overwhelmingly favor late-term abortion up to the very moment of birth – formerly known as \"infanticide.\" They encourage children too young to drive or vote to have their breasts and/or sex organs amputated in pursuit of a \"gender transition\" that is both delusional and impossible, and which leads to staggering rates of depression and suicide. They have not just allowed, but ENGINEERED, a full-scale foreign invasion of America across her southern border.\nTheir standard bearer, President Joe Biden – a senile, pathologically dishonest and epically corrupt career political hack – is destroying America's economy, energy sector, military, law enforcement, election integrity, national security, Constitution and overall national wellbeing as rapidly as possible. At the same time, Team Biden demonizes and, increasingly, IMPRISONS critics as \"violent extremists,\" \"domestic terrorists,\" \"white supremacists\" and \"insurrectionists.\" Indeed, they're currently engaged in an obviously corrupt multi-front legal war against Biden's chief political rival, Donald J. Trump, in an attempt to send the 45th president of the United States to prison for the rest of his life.\nNone of this constitutes \"politics\" in any conventional or traditional American sense. Rather, it is all darkly spiritual. The greatest nation on earth is in the throes of a full-blown spiritual war between good and evil.\nThe big question, then, is WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SAVE AMERICA? Fortunately, real answers and uncommon wisdom are showcased in the December issue of WND's critically acclaimed monthly Whistleblower magazine, \"CAN AMERICA BE SAVED? The world's freest, most Christian nation is on the brink of destruction.\"\nIn this very special issue, readers will experience the best and deepest thoughts and strategies on how to restore America to her former goodness and greatness, from some of the nation's most respected analysts – everyone from Tucker Carlson to Dennis Prager to Victor Davis Hanson to Newt Gingrich and many more.\nWHISTLEBLOWER is available in\nboth the popular print edition and a state-of-the-art digital version, either single issues or discounted annual subscriptions.\nFor 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

    "text": "The number of suicides in our state has reached 200 this year, when a man hanged himself at his home in the Felipe Carrillo Puerto neighborhood in Peto, Yucatan. A 30-year-old man hanged himself at his home on 45th Street in the Felipe Carrillo Puerto neighborhood of the town of Peto, bringing the number of suicides this year to 200. Relatives of the victim, identified with the initials VPG, 30 years old, made the report to the Police at 6:00 p.m. It was learned that he was the father of the young man suspended from a mango tree in the patio of the house. Agents of the Municipal Police, Secretariat of Public Security (SSP) came to verify the report and although emergency medical technicians also arrived, but they could do nothing. The presence of the public security officers caught the attention of locals, who still did not know what had happened. Among the residents of the area it was mentioned that the now deceased was appreciated, hardworking and was friendly to neighbors and friends. The place where the discovery was recorded remained guarded by municipal police, awaiting the arrival of representatives of the State Attorney General’s Office (FGE), as well as personnel from the Forensic Medical Service (Semefo) to take charge of removing the body for the autopsy. Of law. During 2023, the Yucatecan authorities reported a total of 95 cases of attempted suicide, which places the State as the leader in the Peninsula in that area. According to data from the Federal Ministry of Health, until July 15, 2023 in Mexico there were 3,571 notifications of attempted suicide; Jalisco was the most affected by this problem, accumulating 586 cases. In the case of the Yucatán Peninsula, together the three states accumulate 189 incidents, of which 50 percent were in Yucatán. The other half is divided between the 49 cases reported by Quintana Roo and the 45 from Campeche. The National Epidemiological Bulletin also suggests that, in Yucatán, women are the ones who have committed the most suicide attempts, with 70 of the total cases reported by federal authorities. The document also indicates that during the current year, 16 people with suicidal ideas have been diagnosed in Yucatán, double the eight reported in Campeche and much more than the only one in Quintana Roo. Likewise, the Ministry of Health points out that during 2023 other people have caused injuries that are alarmingly reported, although they are not classified as a suicide attempt. For example, in the first six and a half months of the year, in Yucatán, nine injured themselves with sharp objects, seven poisoned themselves with non-narcotic pain relievers, four attempted poisoning with prescription drugs, and nine intentionally injured themselves by hanging, strangulation, or suffocation.

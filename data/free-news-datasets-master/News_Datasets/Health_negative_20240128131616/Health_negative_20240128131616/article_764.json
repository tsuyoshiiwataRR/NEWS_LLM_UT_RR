    "text": "Amy Carr’s eczema can sometimes take over all aspects of her life – her work, her relationship and even her ability to go outside. (ABC News: Lottie Twyford)\nIt’s often dismissed as just a rash, but for Amy Carr, eczema is a painful, expensive condition which controls what she can and can’t do with her life.\nFrom her daily routine to when she can have a child, 31-year-old Ms Carr is used to having to plan her life around her condition.\nOn a daily basis, it’s a case of showering, creaming up and letting it soak in before getting dressed.\nBut when her eczema flares up, her evening routine alone blows out to about two hours.\n“It involves having a bath, whether it’s a bleach bath soak, or just a water bath, [I] soak for 20 to 30 minutes,” Ms Carr said.\n“And then I have to get out of that, put on two to three layers of cream, wrap myself with wet towels and wrap that up with bandages or something similar before putting pyjamas on.”\nFlare-ups managed with lengthy full-body bandage wrapping That process of wrapping her entire body can’t be done alone, so Ms Carr is grateful for her partner’s help – and the occasional phone call.\n“Usually, [that’s] to my mum while I’m crying, even at 31,” she said.\nWhen it gets really bad, Ms Carr must stay home and repeat that process two or three times a day.\nManaging eczema is all about getting as much moisture in as possible which means sufferers need to keep changing creams as the skin becomes accustomed to each one.\nMs Carr describes it as an exhausting process.\n“When I get quite upset about it, then I get migraines from that as well,” she said.\n“So then it’s almost like I’ve recovered from the eczema and then I need a day or two to recover from the backlash of dealing with that eczema.”\nEczema costs at least $15,000 a year to manage Treating eczema is an expensive undertaking.\n“I’ve worked out on a very rough calculation that we would be spending over $15,000 a year,” Ms Carr said.\nThat’s a combination of not only dermatologist and doctor visits, medications, bandages and creams but all the flow-on impacts, too.\n“[The cream] destroys your sheets, it destroys your towels, it destroys your clothing,” she explained.\nThere are the costs of keeping the house cool and air-conditioned as the heat exacerbates her eczema, the cost of replacing carpets with wooden floors as carpet stores dust mites and pollen.\nThere is also the cost of water bills for all the baths she must take and buying more expensive, natural cleaning products to avoid harsh chemicals.\nCondition takes an emotional toll, too Ms Carr said the thought of where those thousands of dollars could be going does weigh heavy on her mind on the nights where she can’t sleep.\nNot that it’s all about money.\nSome of the medication Ms Carr is on – or has been on previously – means she cannot fall pregnant while taking it or she will have to terminate the pregnancy.\n“It affects relationships, it [will] affect the next part of mine or my partner’s relationship of starting a family and all that kind of stuff,” she said.\n“I hate that part.”\nEczema controls schedule and affects mental health Sometimes, it means she must cancel events or plans if the weather changes. Sometimes, she can’t go to work or do her usual errands.\nShe describes this as the biggest mental hurdle.\n“I can’t just decide at eight o’clock in the morning, I’m going to do something at 10 o’clock because if my skin’s really bad, then I can’t go anywhere,” Ms Carr said.\nFor the most part, though, she feels lucky to have a supportive network around her – her partner, friends and family who all understand and accept her for who she is.\nFor Ms Carr, one of the most important things is having her mum and friends ready to answer her phone calls and friends who drop round meals and coffee when she’s stuck at home.\n“Just sitting here while I have a cry just makes that much easier,” she said.\nHer colleagues and the kids she teaches are also incredibly supportive and help her on days when she needs it – something else she says “makes a world of difference”.\nHot, dry weather and pollen to exacerbate condition Ms Carr’s eczema is exacerbated by many things including stress and diet.\nBut heat and pollen are two major factors which cause flare-ups for her – both of which are predicted to stay for the next few months.\nMs Carr has already started the “mental preparation” needed to get herself ready for the heat of summer.\nShe’s purchased extra bandages, creams and ice packs and will be able to set a timer on the air conditioner to ensure the house is as cool as possible.\nBut she knows that — for some of the summer at least — she’ll be stuck inside.\nEveryone’s eczema unique: dermatologist Eczema Support Australia reports three million people across the country live with eczema.\nDermatologist Dr Diana Rubel said the condition — which is also known as atopic dermatitis — is a common complaint among her patients.\nBut despite this, there’s a lot that is unknown about it.\n“The skin is an organ that acts like your senses … so we think eczema is an over-reading of the environment,” she explained.\n“So the skin overreacts to everyday things like heat, temperature changes, friction, sweat, stress, environmental changes and irritants.\n“We think it’s a genetic condition you’re born with … but then the environment brings it out.”\nShe said there are things that can be done to treat eczema, but the place to start is to recognise what causes flare-ups, because it’s different for everyone.\nHer tips for surviving summer include keeping skin well-moisturised, not over-showering and using sunscreens designed for sensitive skin.\nDr Rubel says there are three stages to managing the condition.\nFirst, by avoiding things with harsh chemicals which make it worse. The second is to find a moisturiser which works and use it every day.\nAnd lastly, to add medication — whether that’s a topical ointment, tablets or injections.\nBurden of disease needs to be measured Why exactly people get it and what the burden of disease is for sufferers are two questions Dr Rubel would like to know the answer to.\nShe said experiences like Ms Carr’s — where eczema affects all parts of your life, including your mental health — are common.\n“When we look after patients, we’re very aware of how frustrated, depressed, sleep-deprived, ashamed … all those feelings come out,” she said.\n“We need to acknowledge that’s part of the disease.”\nDr Rubel says there can be a cumulative impact over the course of a patient’s life where eczema means the sufferer must miss out on one thing, which then prevents them from doing the next one.\n“You miss out on going an an excursion because you had bad eczema and that could have really piqued your interest or got your career going in that direction,” she said.\nNot being able to go into certain careers or start a family at specific times, like Ms Carr, could also be “devastating”, Dr Rubel said.\nCalls for national approach to tackling eczema Melanie Funk, who launched national charity Eczema Support Australia after her family’s own experience with it, has called for more attention for the condition and a national strategy.\nAs part of this, she says she would like to see more coordinated care between GPs, dermatologists and pharmacists to improve treatment and outcomes for patients.\n“I think it is really a perception issue … and that it need to be taken more seriously,” Ms Funk said.\n“Eczema has been around for a long, long time. It is not a new thing. What is new, is that we’re understanding that need for coordinated care and that strategy so regardless of where you live in Australia, you’re getting high-quality care.”\nFor Ms Carr, though, it’s all about acceptance and understanding.\n“It’s about being inclusive and accepting and knowing that it’s more than just a rash or more than just spots all over my body,” she said.",

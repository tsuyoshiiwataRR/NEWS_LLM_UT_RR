    "text": "7-year-old’s family getting ready to say goodbye as he battles disease ROANOKE, Va. (WDBJ) - In life’s most challenging moments, the boundless love of a family shines through as they care for Mikah Furrow, a courageous young boy battling a disease. Mikah is in the final moments of his life, bravely fighting against this illness. His grandmother, Donna Furrow, and great aunt, Carlene Robinson, have been his caretakers since birth. “We asked him just to stay with us until today until you got here and did his story,” explained Furrow and Robinson. “And he did.” His caretakers don’t know how much time they have left with him. “Mikah today is what we would call actively dying,” said Carilion Hospice RN Case Manager Krysta Smoot. “He has made a sudden decline in the last week, where he’s not really waking up.” But they do know they want his story to be heard. “When he was born, we knew that he had CMV,” added Furrow and Robinson. “But we had no idea the magnitude of what that meant.” Mikah’s journey began with Congenital CMV, a common cause of birth defects in the US. The [CDC reports](https://www.cdc.gov/cmv/congenital-infection.html) that 1 out of 200 babies is born with the disease, and 1 out of 5 babies with CMV will have long-term health problems. Due to his illness, Mikah’s life in Vinton has been marked by cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and developmental delays. Yet, his family’s unwavering dedication and his unbreakable spirit have defied all odds. “So, we made a decision together, that every day that he lived was going to be the best day of his life,” said Furrow and Robinson. “And that’s what it’s been.” A year ago, the family made the difficult decision to enroll Mikah in [Carilion Clinic’s Pediatric Hospice Care](https://www.carilionclinic.org/specialties/hospice). “No one should have to do that for their child,” said Furrow and Robinson. “But when you are able to make decisions for his quality of care, when you’re not in the midst of your crisis, that’s when you need to make those decisions. Even though it was the hardest day, it’s been the best thing that we could have ever done.” Contrary to misconceptions about hospice, the family has received support, comfort, and medical guidance. “These families get the extra layer of support in the home that they deserve while taking care of a medically complex child,” said Smoot. “But can also see their specialist inside the hospital.” Amidst their journey, music therapy has been a cherished gift—especially for Mikah. “She started playing this little boy nursery rhymes. And he would clap along. He would shake his little jingle bells,” explained Smoot. “And I have never seen Mikah light up the way he does.” The staff has gone above and beyond, showering Mikah and his family with love. “We’ve been able to do pictures for him. We’ve been able to do crafts with him,” added Smoot. “And no, that’s not my job title. But my job is to love on this. This little boy and their family and that’s what I’m doing.” As they prepare to say goodbye, Mikah’s family wants to show him how much he’s loved. “I think he does know that,” added Furrow and Robinson. “And we know at the end of the day that we’ve done everything that we could to care for him. And that’s all you can do. And he’s given us so many gifts, and they will never they will continue forever.” Though Mikah’s song will end too soon, his family says it’s one they’ll remember forever. Mikah’s family encourages every pregnant woman to ask her doctor for a CMV screening or seek information about it if considering having a baby. They believe this can reduce the severity and potentially save a child’s life. WDBJ7 thanks Mikah and his family for sharing their story. Our hearts go out to them. “ Copyright 2023 WDBJ.

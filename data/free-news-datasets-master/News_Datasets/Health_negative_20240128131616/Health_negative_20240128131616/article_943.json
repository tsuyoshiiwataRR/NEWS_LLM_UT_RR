    "text": "'Persons of interest' sought in 18-year-old pregnant woman's shooting death: San Antonio police [Amaris Encinas](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/5133245001/amaris-encinas/) San Antonio police are asking the public to help identify two 'persons of interest' at the scene of a fatal shooting that killed a [missing pregnant woman and](/story/news/nation/2023/12/27/savanah-nicole-soto-found-san-antonio/72039504007/) her 22-year-old boyfriend. Police announced Thursday that the male victim was Matthew Guerra, and investigators and family members presume the woman in the vehicle was [18-year-old Savanah Nicole Soto, who was carrying her unborn son](/story/news/nation/2023/12/26/savanah-soto-missing-texas-18-year-old/72030874007/), Fabian. Investigators on Thursday also released surveillance footage from a residential neighborhood in San Antonio near where the bodies were discovered Tuesday evening, in an attempt to identify the two individuals who were seen near the couple's vehicle. In the video, the couple's Kia Optima slowly approaches a dark-colored Chevy Silverado stopping briefly to interact with the driver, who was seen exiting the vehicle. Another individual was seen exiting the victim's Kia Optima, but it's unclear if the person leaves the area alone or with the person driving the truck. The minute-long video concludes with the Kia Optima leaving the area. McManus would not confirm or deny whether the couple was alive or dead when the video was taken, citing an active investigation. The medical examiner determined that Guerra died from a gunshot wound to the head, but that the manner of the death was still spending, Police Chief William McManus said at Thursday's press conference. Investigators said the other person found in the car has been identified as “a full-term pregnant female,” according to a [Facebook pos](https://www.facebook.com/SanAntonioPD/videos/1023556412274319/)t by the department. “I think we can be confident that the second victim was Savanah,” McManus said. This is developing story and will be updated with additional details.",

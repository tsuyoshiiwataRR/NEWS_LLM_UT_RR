    "text": "Cannot take the crazy anymore. It took a long time to actually figure it out. After reading up on Borderline Personality Disorder it's all too apparent. She exhibits all the traits and is an expert at the manipulation / control thing and now that I see it, I can't move past it. For about 2-years I thought I could live with it for the kids sake - and hey, I'm pretty Independent and really only need sex - which she delivered in spades. But her need for validation and accolades has consumed her life and, well, there's just no room for me anymore. Not as an individual me anyway.\nDon't really care what it's going to cost financially anymore. I'm in my mid-60's and can work for another 10-years.\nWhat I really worry about are the kids. Specifically, the 12-year-old-boy. Our 17-year-ols girl won't really struggle too much if she can keep her head straight. She's very smart. very pretty, a hard worker and quite a musician / singer.\nWe adopted my boy very young and he has (generic term) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. He's smart (good IQ) but poor rational thinking skills. He's obstinate and VERY argumentative. He's going to have a rough go in Life. I need to focus on getting him prepared for after I am gone.\nSide note: this has actually been a problem for the BPD because of the time I spend with him and care given to him. If that sounds weird (it is) look up Borderline Personality Disorder and all the F'd-up things they think / do.\nAnyway - I told her today that I want a divorce and I grabbed a few things to go stay the night away from home. Trying to clear my head - and also get my focus on the next steps. I want to have the kids for New Years Eve into New Years Day and I'm going to have to explain what's going on.\nI'm sure the 17-year-old won't be surprised - the boy on the other hand won't like it at all. He will most likely argue that I need to go fix it.\nSigh - thanks for letting me vent. Probably be doing a lot of that..",

    "text": "The prefecture of Gironde has taken the unprecedented decision to temporarily ban all sales of oysters from the Arcachon Basin. This radical measure follows a series of cases of collective food poisoning recorded in recent days, attributable to the consumption of these shellfish.\nAnalyzes reveal widespread presence of norovirus\nAlerted by several reports of acute gastroenteritis, the\nhealth authorities launched epidemiological investigations. These have clearly identified Arcachon oysters as responsible for this sudden increase in gastrointestinal disorders. Samples and in-depth analyzes of farmed oysters from throughout the Basin have unfortunately confirmed widespread contamination by noroviruses, the main infectious agents of viral gastroenteritis in humans.\nAlthough fortunately no serious cases have been reported, the\nhealth risk is considered serious enough to justify the immediate withdrawal from sale of all Arcachon oysters, whether they are already marketed or intended to be marketed soon.\nClear call not to consume oysters already purchased\nThe prefecture explicitly calls on consumers who have oysters from the Arcachon Basin not to consume them, whatever their stage of breeding or their date of purchase. They are asked to play the precautionary card by returning them as quickly as possible to their point of sale.\nThese provisions also apply to individuals who fish for oysters themselves in the area now prohibited for\nhealth reasons. The ban remains in force until checks once again reveal that the shellfish are completely safe.\nOyster industry hit hard during the holiday season\nThis decision comes at the worst time for local oyster farmers, a few days before New Year’s Eve. Suddenly deprived of their flagship production for the most prosperous time of the year, they expect to suffer a serious shortfall.\nAdded to the damage caused by recent storms on oyster beds, this blow risks plunging the profession into a major economic crisis. Oysters from the Basin represent 10% of national production, a far from negligible weight.\nOyster farmers also denounce polluting discharges which insidiously contaminate the natural environment, calling into question certain practices. They wonder about responsibilities and possible compensation.\nIn any case, the maintenance of the bans will depend on the time necessary to sustainably rectify the failing\nhealth quality of Arcachon oysters.\nMy name is Ethan, I’m 30 years old, and I’m the founder of this magazine.

    "text": "What type of passenger are you on a long flight? Are you the type who falls asleep as soon as the plane takes off, only waking up when the meal is being served and when the plane lands? Or are you the type that never falls asleep, so you binge-watch an entire TV show while snacking on the complimentary snacks and drinks, and maybe chat a bit with your neighboring passenger? I think it's great that every person can find what to do on a flight in order to relax and enjoy the experience, but the experience for doctors on flights can become something entirely different. It is no secret that doctors have a greater responsibility than most of the other professions, but you would think that on their time off, they would be able to relax and let loose a bit. Apparently not, as in this Reddit story, a doctor shares that while on a flight, he decided to give himself a break and enjoy a few drinks. He chatted for a while with the woman sitting next to him, telling her he was a doctor, when an announcement was made asking for a doctor to assist a passenger on the plane. Since he already had several drinks he wasn't feeling up to the task, but the passenger next to him was extremely mad about his decision to sit this one out. Scroll down for the full tale, and for the surprising comments who were not all in favor of the doctor.

    "text": "Beverly - Denise Vanikiotis, 70, of Beverly, passed away Wednesday, December 20, at home, surrounded by loved ones. Born in Beverly on February 22nd, 1953, she was the daughter of the late Rose (Mascioli) and George Vanikiotis. She was the loving mother of three children and grandmother to six grandchildren.\nDenise was a devoted mother. She cherished her children, dedicating her life to their well-being. She joyfully served as a school crossing guard during their elementary school years, a lunch lady during middle school, and a bus driver throughout high school. As a committed band mother she never missed a performance and was always equipped with safety pins, hand warmers, and an enthusiastic round of applause. Denise was always the reliable ride home for the kid that didn't have one and the one with extra snacks. She always ensured that no one went without.\nDenise was dedicated to her work. When her children were grown, she worked for many years as a paraprofessional, caring for children at the North Shore Education Consortium, while spending her evenings and summers driving a van for the YMCA. Upon \"retirement\" she returned to the Beverly Public Schools transportation department. There wasn't a day that she didn't talk about her kids on the bus.\nDenise especially loved her role as Nana to her grandchildren, Zackary, Olivia, Thomas, Alyson, Michael and Emily. She considered herself lucky to live under the same roof with her oldest two for 15 years. She brought so much love, laughter, and adventure into their lives. Nana left them with wonderful memories of silly jokes, dance moves, and advice. She often sent them videos of her beloved puppies, Willow and Phoebe.\nShe had a special bond with her son-in-law, Brett, treasuring their Sunday grocery shopping trips and countless laughs. In recent years, she felt fortunate to have her son, Paul, living just upstairs. There was nothing she loved more than when he cooked for her, which was often.\nDenise is survived by her son, Paul Richardson Jr. and his fiancé Marlo Freedman of Beverly; two daughters, Victoria Rozzi and her husband Robert of East Boston, and Valerie Dodge and her husband Brett of Beverly; her former spouse Paul Richardson of Beverly; brother George Vanikiotis of Ipswich; sister Sharlene Turlis and her husband John of Manchester, NH; and her six grandchildren.\nFuneral services for Denise are private. Contributions may be made in Denise's memory to Operation Gratitude (\nhttps://www.operationgratitude.com). Arrangements by Campbell Funeral Home, 525 Cabot St., Beverly.

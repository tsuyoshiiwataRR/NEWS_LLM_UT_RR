Hector courageously confessed that he assumed his role not for the sake of a job or promotion but because he personally witnessed the suffering caused by drug addiction in his own family and community. Hector also highlighted the high profitability of the drug trade, in which one kilo of 90% pure heroin bought for $250,000 can be broken down into ten kilos for distribution, maximizing profit. Despite the risk to his life, he continues to combat drug cartels, criticizing the Mexican government's inadequate response and warning that the glamorization of drug lords in songs and movies influences others to aspire to be drug dealers. The desperation for a better life often drives people into drug dealing, consequently contributing to the continuous drug crisis.

    "text": "TCPalm | Treasure Coast Newspapers Over 2 pounds of fentanyl seized in Martin County drug sting; 3 New York men charged Corey Arwood, Treasure Coast Newspapers December 28, 2023 at 11:53 PM · 3 min read Link Copied Read full article\nMARTIN COUNTY − A narcotics sting in a Walmart parking lot netted vice detectives 2½ pounds of fentanyl − the largest volume of the drug ever trafficked in to the county − and three arrests, sheriff's officials announced Thursday.\nMartin County Sheriff's Office agents seized the drug, with an estimated $300,000 street value, Wednesday.\nEach of the three men, who officials said traveled from Bronx, New York, to Stuart to sell the 10,000 blue pills, are facing a potential minimum 25-year prison sentence if convicted for interstate drug trafficking.\nSheriff William Snyder spoke Thursday afternoon at the Sheriff's Office about the operation.\nThe seizure of 2.5 pounds, or 10,000 pills, of fentanyl during was announced by Martin County Sheriff's Office Thursday with officials saying the drug operation led to the arrests of three New York men on trafficking charges on Wednesday December 27,2023.\nTypically, Snyder said, if detectives seized fentanyl, it was \"5 (or) 6 pills,\" but the total weight taken Wednesday made it, \"a record amount of narcotics.\"\nThe pills were pressed and marked to appear as counterfeit opioid prescription painkillers, he said.\n\"... So this, had it hit our streets, we would've been awash in it,\" said Snyder.\nHe cited what he said were local fatal overdose statistics: In 2022, 51 people died, while, so far, in 2023, 49 people have died in fentanyl-related overdoses. There were also \"a multitude\" of ongoing cases emerging this year that Snyder said could push 2023 past last year's total.\n\"...Our field tests indicate this is a high potency fentanyl ... so every one of those pills had the potential of killing whoever took them,\" he said.\nYelson Daniel Alvarez-Ortiz, 25; Jeffry Ezequiel Gonzalez-Ortiz, 29; and Carlos Almonte-Melo, 35, were each charged with trafficking 4 grams or more of fentanyl.\nSnyder said they were part of \"a major trafficking organization with tentacles throughout South Florida.\"\nThe men were said in arrest records to be part of \"a crew ... from New York\" who planned to sell the pills in Stuart for $38,000 in a deal set for 12 p.m. Dec. 27 at the Walmart Supercenter automotive parking lot in the 4000 block of Southeast Federal Highway.\nThe seizure of 2.5 pounds, or 10,000 pills, of fentanyl during was announced by Martin County Sheriff's Office Thursday with officials saying the drug operation led to the arrests of three New York men on trafficking charges on Wednesday December 27,2023.\nAccording to those records, when their black Toyota sport utility vehicle arrived, deputies used a \"vehicle immobilization technique,\" arresting the three men while one ran, was pursued and caught.\nThe reports state the plastic bags full of fentanyl pills were found under a seat in the SUV.\nDetectives requested the men be held in jail without bond, saying in the arrest records, each frequented the Dominican Republic, none had ties to Florida and all were considered flight risks.\nSnyder said he hoped they would at least be given a $300,000 bail, but a judge \"for reasons I cannot tell you,\" set their bail each at $200,000.\n\"I suspect with that lower bond, they'll be out and they'll be gone and they are a flight risk,\" he said.\nMore: New Year's Eve cruise: Mystery ship leaves Treasure Coast during weather break\nMore: Cold weather shelter opening in Fort Pierce; Indian River, Martin counties watch forecasts\nMore: Top Treasure Coast environmental stories of 2023\nCorey Arwood is a breaking news reporter for TCPalm.

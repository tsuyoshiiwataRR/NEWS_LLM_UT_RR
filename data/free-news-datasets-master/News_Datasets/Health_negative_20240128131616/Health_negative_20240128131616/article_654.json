    "text": "The family of a five-year-old girl who was [stabbed outside her school last month](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41296315.html) has confirmed she is “out of danger”. The primary school pupil was one of three children who were injured during the [incident on November 23 outside Gaelscoil Coláiste Mhuire](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41276098.html) on Parnell Square in Dublin. While the other two children, a boy, 5, and girl, 6, were [discharged from hospital within days of the incident](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41277100.html), the five-year-old girl was in a critical condition and in intensive care at Temple Street Children’s hospital until recently. In an update on a GoFundMe page for the child today, her family shared the news that she is slowly recovering. Organiser and family friend Roisin Fitzgerald posted the message on behalf of the child’s parents. It reads: “Just to wish everyone a delayed Christmas and a happy new year. “Our angel has been out of the PICU for two weeks now. Creche worker Leanne Flynn was also injured in the incident and she remains in the Mater Hospital. Meanwhile, the man accused of the attempted murder of the little girl and two other children was further remanded in custody until January 25 when he appeared before Cloverhill District Court via video link on Thursday morning. [Riad Bouchaker](https://www.irishexaminer.com/nationalnews/arid-41295277.html), of no fixed abode, also faces charges of causing serious harm to a care worker, the assault of a French man at the scene, and with assault causing harm to other children. The GoFundMe for the little girl has so far raised almost €55,000.",

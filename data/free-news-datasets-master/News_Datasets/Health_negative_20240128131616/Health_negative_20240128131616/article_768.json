    "text": "It's the festive season, with the annual chorus about road carnage and a safety blitz loudly proclaimed. Thirty-two deaths is tragic, and we need to reduce the number dramatically. If we utilise the methods employed to report COVID-19 deaths in this state, we would come up with a palatable figure. Over the past seven weeks 26 Tasmanians have died from the coronavirus. By the end of the year the two-month total might equal the annual road fatalities. Do we hear these grim figures broadcast weekly? Do we hear authorities talking of the whole community being responsible; taking care of each other; protecting the vulnerable? Not bloody likely. Here's a theory: A large percentage of those COVID victims are older Tasmanians, and perhaps we're a bit more blaze about the demise of the elderly. In the same way, as a society, that we don't wring our hands and cry over each sad coronavirus mortality, we could discount those over 65 who die in traffic accidents. That might knock 30 per cent off the tally, and get it down to a more pleasing 22.4. This year 112 Tasmanians have died, statistically irrelevant, from COVID-19. Operation Safe Arrival for them has meant a very final destination, without the bells and whistles of a highly visible public safety campaign. Greg Pullen, Miena I am somewhat mystified to learn that 18 blokes and 18 women need two ovals and a purpose-built $70 million state of the art high performance training centre so they can kick around a football all day long. Perhaps they intend to have a his and her oval, which seems contrary to the recently found zest the AFL has for inclusiveness. When the needs of the LGBTIA+ folk need to be considered: A third oval? My incredulity doesn't end there. Am I to believe this super-duper, glorious temple of the gods is to be built on the people's land at a rent of one dollar a year? And to add insult to injury we are to pay $60 million to build it. I know its all for a good cause and I simply can't wait for the six matches a year the AFL men in suits deem suitable for us all to see. Ian Broinowski, Hobart Recently as an older \"white\" Australian woman, sixth generation Anglo/Celt walking among a sea of \"brown\" people, I was deeply touched and saddened that a young woman wrapped a Palestinian flag thanked me for attending a demonstration in support of those who are protesting the horrors in Gaza and the West Bank. Why aren't more of us there? I understand the deep sense of futility, the lack of hope that leads young men to pick up weapons and commit those acts of atrocity on October 7. These crimes against humanity are to be condemned. However, these acts are by a minority of Palestinians: the atrocities committed now on 2.2 million people in Gaza; terror, starvation, thirst, disease, maiming and murder are being done by a powerful state, Israel. There is a difference. If the objective is to stop terrorism, it will not as the conditions that led to these acts are worse than ever. This conflagration will not stop at the borders of Middle Eastern countries. It has made the world is a much less safe place for all. We all must demand a permanent ceasefire. Then justice must be done for those people who are the indigenous Semitic people of Palestine: the Christians, Muslims, Bedouins and Jews. For over two thousand years they lived in harmony in this region before the state of Israel was ever imagined. Without the extremists, is it possible they could live together again, in a single state, all of the people of \"The Book\"? Susan Hartley, Oldina Have your say.

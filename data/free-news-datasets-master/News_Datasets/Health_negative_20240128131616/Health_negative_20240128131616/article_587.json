    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Loneliness is something many people struggle with, and now that we are in winter it can become even more challenging. It is important during these months to acknowledge and accept your emotions.\nTo shift your perspective and take proactive steps towards coping with loneliness, start with self care! The more love you give yourself the less lonely you will feel.\nF or those who may find it challenging to connect with others, especially during the colder months, Be Proactive! Volunteering, Local Meet Up's, Local Classes, Virtual Meet Up's, and Social Media are all great places to start meeting people and fostering connections.\nDuring this season, redefine expectations, focus on gratitude, and give back. One of the easiest ways to turn a negative feeling like loneliness around is to go do something for someone else and there seems to be an abundance of opportunities that someone else has organized that you can show up for.\nFor more from Kristy, visit kristykuhl.com .\nCharlotte Today is a local lifestyle and entertainment show where you'll learn everything about the Queen City with hosts Mia Atkins and Eugene Robinson on WCNC Charlotte live weekdays at 11 a.m.\nFrom what’s trending to local restaurants, events and entertainment, you’ll find it all on this show.\nCharlotte Today also features sponsored content by local and national businesses.

    "text": "Hi - I was diagnosed with DCIS in June. Since then I’ve had SLNB, 2x lumpectomies, a mastectomy and a breast reduction. At every stage I have have had “unusual results” or set backs including the possibility of losing the nipple on my reduced side. I am totally fed up and an emotional wreck …. Angry, tearful, scared. My family don’t discuss my cancer with me as I think they are terrified. One of my kids said I was to move on now that I’ve had the mastectomy and not be “a victim”. It’s like they don’t understand what it’s like to have this hanging over you daily. I’ve been really positive for the last 6 months but now I feel like I’ve nothing left in the tank. Having cancer is a lonely place!

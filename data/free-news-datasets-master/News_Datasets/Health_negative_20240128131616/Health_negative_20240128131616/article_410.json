    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS â€” A Minnesota woman is suing her former dentist for more than $50,000 after he allegedly attempted a dizzying array of dental procedures in a single visit. Kathleen Wilson filed a lawsuit against Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentristy alleging that she continues to experience pain, suffering, emotional distress and disfigurement after Molldrem attempted to give her four root canals, eight crowns and 20 restorations in a single visit back in 2020. According to Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a Florida dentist retained by Wilson's legal team, Molldrem \"may have come close\" to having the correct diagnosis, but provided the wrong treatment and poor quality treatment. Wilson had decay or tooth dissolution on \"virtually every tooth in her mouth\", a rare issue, according to Goldstein. \"Katie required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease. Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner,\" wrote Goldstein in his report. The lawsuit also alleges Molldrem failed to create a care plan that would effectively address decay and tooth dissolution and provided quantities of anesthesia well in excess of recommended doses. More than a year after her last visit with Molldrem, a different dentist, Dr. Tim Isaacson saw Wilson and noted that of the 28 teeth restored by Molldrem, 27 of them had signs of decay, sometimes on multiple surfaces or adverse contours. KARE 11 reached out to the Eden Prairie-based Molldrem Family Dentistry and has not heard back as of publication.

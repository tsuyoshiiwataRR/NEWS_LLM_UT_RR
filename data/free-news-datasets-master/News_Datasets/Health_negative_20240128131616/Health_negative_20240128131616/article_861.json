    "text": "2023-12-28 16:46:41 National Plan on drugs Updated Thursday, December 28, 2023 – 15:46 “Electronic cigarettes are the gateway to tobacco.” Consumption data multiplies by five as age increases Adolescente fumandoShutterstock He 34,6% of students from among 12 and 13 years acknowledge having consumed alcoholand the 25% having smoked a electronic cigarette, at least once in your life. This is stated in the pilot study published today on alcohol and tobacco consumption and possible behavioral addictions, in young people in 1st and 2nd year of ESO, carried out by the Government Delegation within the National Plan on drugs. Electronic cigarettes are booming among adolescents “we were surprised by the data,” he acknowledges Joan Ramn VillalbGovernment delegate for the National Drug Plan. One in every four has consumed the electronic option at some time in his life, especially the girls, and the 8.5% tobacco (6.5% in the last year and 4.1% in the last month). “Electronic cigarettes are the gateway to tobacco”, says Villab. Although it seems that the conventional method is less widespread than the electronic method in the age group of 12 to 13 years, the data on tobacco consumption is multiplied by five among those aged 14 to 18 who have smoked in the last month. (from 4.1% to 21.0%). “Vapers look like toys and have sweet flavors, but they are harmful and the precursor to smoking. Let’s regulate them,” he publishes Monica Garcia in its count of . This piloting has been carried out simultaneously with the Survey on drug use in Secondary Education in Spain ( Studies ). The sample has covered 8,000 teenagers randomly and representatively selected from the whole of Spain. The consumption of alcoholic drinkswhich is very similar in boys and girls aged 12 to 13 over the last year, although in the group aged 14 to 18 the consumption It is more widespread among girls. Drinks are usually obtained in neighborhood stores (41.6%), in other people’s homes (40.8%) or in their own homes (33.2%). The latter explains the increase in prevalence in students with parents who consume more. It is also very widespread energy drinks (Red Bull, Burn, Monster, Coca-Cola Energy…). They have great consequences for health, and a 37.7% of students have taken them in the last 30 days. The problems that the abuse of these drinks can cause mainly have to do with three aspects: their high caffeine content, the large amounts of sugar they contain and their frequent combination with alcohol, and 10.2% have done so in the last month according to the study. The practice of mix alcohol and energy drinks They increase as the age of the students increases, almost doubling in the 14 to 18 year old group compared to the 12 to 13 year old group (19.5% vs 10.2%). In this case, boys abuse these drinks more than girls. The Minister of Youth and Children, Sira Regohas indicated that they are “studying” measures to “try to alleviate” the effect of energy drinks, as well as electronic cigarettes, on young people. Behavioral addictions He 90% of adolescents (12-13 years old) play video game, and with age the use decreases to 60-70%. In the case of girls, as time goes by, they reduce the time spent on video games and increase the use of social networks. He 14.5% of them recognize that they could be making problematic use of the Internet, especially them, where it reaches 18%. In those aged 14 to 18, problematic use increases to 20.5% (25.9% in girls). Regarding the possible video game use disorderrecognized by the WHO, as a disease, there are indications that it could be around a 9% in boys and 3% in girls. “Those who play more than 4 hours a day show greater signs of being able to suffer from this pathology,” says the delegate. #children #aged #consumed #alcohol #consumed #electronic #cigarettes",

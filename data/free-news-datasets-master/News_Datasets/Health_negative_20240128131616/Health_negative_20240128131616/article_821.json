    "text": "Saturday\nHi, hoping for some help.\nI use the sleep automation to play rain noise, it should be an hour long and then stop, however it keeps defaulting to single track repeat and never stops. I turn this off in the home app once it's playing but it will go back to this the next time I use the sleep automation.\n13m ago\nHey DrLucienSanchez,\nI apologize for the delayed response. I understand how important it is to be able to enjoy different relaxing tracks on your Google Nest Mini. To help resolve the issue, could you please provide me with some additional details? When did you first notice the issue? Is the issue also present when you attempt to play relaxing sounds on your Nest Mini via voice command? Also, I would like to know which actions have been added to your routine.\nIn the meantime, I recommend creating a new routine with the same actions and testing to see if the issue persists. This will help us to isolate the issue and find a solution that works for you.\nLooking forward to your response.\nCheers,\nMuddi",

    "text": "Four Covid deaths, 702 fresh cases in a day\nNEW DELHI: India recorded four more deaths due to Covid-19 in one day — one each from Karnataka, Kerala, Bengal and Delhi — while the daily tally of infections stood at 702, the health ministry said.\nOn December 22, India had recorded 752 new cases of Covid-19 in a day. As reported by TOI on Thursday, the two deaths reported in Maharashtra were added to its tally of Wednesday.\nThe current surge in Covid-19 cases is suspected to be caused by JN.1, a new sub-variant of SARS-CoV2, which was first detected in Kerala in India on December 8. It has been detected in eight other states of Gujarat, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, & Delhi.\nSenior health ministry officials said though cases have gone up, very few cases are requiring hospitalisation as symptoms are mild in most Covid-19 cases now. “The deaths were attributed to Covid-19 people with pre-existing co-morbidities,” said an official.\nThe daily number of infections were in lakhs at the peak of the pandemic, which began in early 2020 and has seen over 4.5 crore people getting infected and over 5.3 lakh deaths in about four years across the country. The national recovery rate was 98.8%, as per the health ministry’s website. Over 220 crore doses of Covid vaccines have so far been administered in the country.\nFor more news like this visit TOI.

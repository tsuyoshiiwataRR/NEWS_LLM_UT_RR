    "text": "About The Study: The findings of this study including 345 participants suggest that post–COVID-19 brain health was impaired but, overall, no more than the brain health of patients from 3 non–COVID-19 cohorts of comparable disease severity. Long-term associations with brain health might not be specific to COVID-19 but associated with overall illness severity and hospitalization. This information is important for putting understandable concerns about brain health after COVID-19 into perspective.\nAuthors: Daniel Kondziella, M.D., M.Sc., Dr.Philos., and Michael Eriksen Benros, M.D., Ph.D., of Copenhagen University Hospital in Copenhagen, are the corresponding authors.\nTo access the embargoed study: Visit our For The Media website at this link https://media.jamanetwork.com/\nEmbed this link to provide your readers free access to the full-text article This link will be live at the embargo time http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.49659?utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_term=122823\n(doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.49659)\nEditor’s Note: Please see the article for additional information, including other authors, author contributions and affiliations, conflict of interest and financial disclosures, and funding and support.\nJournal\nJAMA Network Open",

    "text": "NORFOLK, Va. — A Norfolk couple is upset with the condition of their home. Mark Getto and his fiance, Juliette Pardue, moved into their home on December 12, 2023. Soon after moving into their home, the couple noticed the house had a sewage issue.\n\"I'm disgusted and horrified and shocked about how much of an issue this has become and how much this has impacted our holiday,\" said Juliette Pardue.\nThe couple said the sewage issue started in the bathroom. Then, it impacted the couple's entire first floor and backyard. Getto is a disabled veteran. He said moving around his new home has been challenging.\n\"It's been extremely difficult. I mean, there's been water in the house. We haven't had the opportunity to move all of the boxes out of the way, so it's been extremely limiting,\" said Getto.\nThe couple said they contacted the property owner, Sylvan Homes Real Estate Agency , an out-of-state company, several times about the issue. They said the agency sent three different contractors to their home. Each time, the contractors would inspect the problem, give the couple an estimate and leave. After a while, the couple hired a plumber and learned the septic system needed to be replaced.\nIn the short time the couple has lived in their home, they have paid thousands on plumbing, cleaning supplies, dehumidifiers, heaters, and air movers to resolve the water damage issues.\n\"It has taken fighting tooth and nail even to be able to contact them,\" said Juliette.\nThe couple said Sylvan Homes Real Estate offered to pay for a hotel room for the couple, but the agency did not offer to pay for a hotel room for their roommate. They also said the agency failed to find a hotel room to accommodate the couple's service animals.\n\"Livid isn't even a strong enough word. I feel like I served this country. I sacrifice for this country, and I deserve better than this. I shouldn't be treated this way,\" said Getto.\n13News Now reached out to the Sylvan Homes Real Estate. A customer representative told us they sent out a contractor to look at the issue over the phone on Wednesday, December 27. They are aware of the problem and are working to resolve it.",

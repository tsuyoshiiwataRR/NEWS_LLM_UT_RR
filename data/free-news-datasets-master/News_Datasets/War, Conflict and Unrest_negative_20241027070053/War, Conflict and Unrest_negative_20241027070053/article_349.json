    "text": "Disney Cruise Line’s Disney Wonder has canceled an upcoming stop at Nouméa, New Caledonia due to civil unrest in the French territory. Disney Wonder Updates Itinerary The Wonder is departing Honolulu, Hawai’i on October 3 and heading towards Sydney, Australia for its [second year of South Pacific sailings](https://wdwnt.com/2023/10/disney-wonder-arrives-in-sydney-for-first-australia-new-zealand-sailings/). The ship was scheduled to visit Nouméa on October 15 before eventually arriving in Sydney on October 19. The itinerary has been updated and October 15 is now listed as a day at sea. (via [The Street](https://www.thestreet.com/travel/disney-cruise-line-keeps-ships-at-sea-to-avoid-storms-and-unrest-)) Nouméa is the capital city of New Caledonia, which is currently experiencing heightened unrest surrounding the anniversary of France’s takeover. Riots began in May of this year in response to a controversial voting bill. (via [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/24/new-caledonia-unrest-france-september-24)) The [U.S. Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/new-caledonia-travel-advisory.html) labels New Caledonia with a Travel Advisory Level 3: Reconsider Travel. The Disney Wonder will still stop at Samoa and Fiji during the October sailing.

    "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin (TFP File) A Russian company is reportedly working with entities in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to develop attack drones for Russia’s war in Ukraine. According to a report by Reuters on September 25, based on European intelligence sources and reviewed documents, Russia has initiated a secret weapons program in the PRC through business entities in both countries to create long-range attack drones for use in the conflict.\nRussian weapons manufacturer IEMZ Kupol is said to have developed and tested the “Garpiya-3” long-range attack drone in collaboration with Chinese specialists. The company reportedly informed the Russian Ministry of Defense that these drones can be produced at a factory in the PRC.\nRead: Zelensky Warns Russia May Target Ukraine’s Nuclear Power Plants Ahead Of Winter\nThe Garpiya-3 drone has a range of 2,000 kilometers and a 50-kilogram payload, representing an upgrade from the Russian-produced Garpiya-A1 drones, which also use some Chinese components. At least seven Garpiya-3 drones have been delivered to Russia for testing, according to the report.\nThe PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied knowledge of the project and emphasized China’s strict drone export controls. However, the White House expressed concern to Reuters about the possibility of a PRC-based entity providing lethal assistance to a sanctioned Russian company, stressing that the PRC has an obligation to prevent such actions, even though there is no evidence the Chinese government is aware of the collaboration.\nRead: Putin Threatens Nuclear Confrontation, Adjusts Doctrine To Pressure Western Decision-Making\nThis report comes amid growing evidence of Chinese support for Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. Previously, Bloomberg reported that Russian and Chinese companies were collaborating on a drone similar to the Iranian-designed Shahed loitering munition for Russian use in Ukraine.\nAdditionally, the ongoing Russia-China “Beibu/Interaction-2024” joint naval exercise further highlights the military cooperation between the two countries, which may be aimed at countering Western-made air defense systems in Ukraine and reducing Western military influence globally.\nThese developments undermine China’s repeated claims of neutrality in the Ukraine conflict, revealing increased military cooperation between Russia and China.\nPlease make a small donation to the Tampa Free Press to help sustain independent journalism .

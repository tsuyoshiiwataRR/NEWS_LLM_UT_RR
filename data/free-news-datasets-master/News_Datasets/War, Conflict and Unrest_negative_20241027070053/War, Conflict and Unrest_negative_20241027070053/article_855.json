    "text": "Source: Justin Johnson / General\nThe trial began Monday and it took less than a week for Justin Johnson to be found guilty of first-degree murder in the 2021 killing of Memphis rapper Young Dolph . The jury took under four hours to deliberate on Thursday (Sept 26), and immediately after the verdict was read, the judge gave Johnson life. RELATED: Dolph Shooter Says He Received $800 of Promised $100K Bounty for His Role In Rapper’s Slaying RELATED: Young Dolph Tribute Mural Defaced Before Unveiling RELATED: Two More Suspects Named In Young Dolph Murder Case Cornelius Smith , the other shooter who earlier this week said he only earned $800 for the killing, testified against Johnson and admitted to killing Dolph on the first day of trial. “I wasn’t feeling nothing at the time.” Smith told the court Monday when asked if he felt any emotions during the brutal slaying. “I was just trying to get some money … I saw him standing by the window. I just got out of the car and started shooting.” According to Smith, Johnson was the second gunman and Govan informed them of the bounty Big Jook , brother of Yo Gotti , had on Dolph. Smith told the court he and Johnson had been stalking Dolph ahead of a planned Turkey Drive and that after the shooting outside Makeda’s Cookies, he FaceTimed Jook to confirm the deed was done.In January 2024, Jook was fatally gunned down outside a Memphis restaurant. Shelby County District Attorney General Steve Mulroy released the following statement after the verdict: “Every murder’s a tragedy, and we take them all seriously. This one generated extra public interest because Young Dolph was a prominent and beloved member of the community. We will continue to fight hard to make sure that all of those responsible for his death are brought to justice.”\nThe post Shooter in Young Dolph Murder Sentenced to Life in Prison appeared first on 97.9 The Box .",

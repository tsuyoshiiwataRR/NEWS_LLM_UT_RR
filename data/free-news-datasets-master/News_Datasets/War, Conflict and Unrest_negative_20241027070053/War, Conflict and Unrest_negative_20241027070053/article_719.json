    "text": "Putin's Real Face: The EU Responds to New Nuclear Threats from Russia. The EU condemns Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries The European Union has strongly condemned new threats by the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin about the possible use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries. This was stated by EU representative Peter Stano at a briefing in Brussels. \"It is not the first[Time]Putin bets on his nuclear arsenal. This is just a continuation of very irresponsible and unacceptable behavior by Putin, which demonstrates his true face to the whole world, especially during the high-level week of the United Nations General Assembly,\" said Stano. Despite such threats, the EU will not change its position on continuing to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. The EU representative emphasized the paradoxical situation when the leader of a country that is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, whose duty is to maintain peace, undermines these efforts with his actions. \"He is not shy about playing nuclear gambling games again and again. We certainly strongly oppose these threats. The position of the European Union remains unchanged,\" added Stano. Recall that the day before, Putin announced amendments to the conditions for Russia's use of nuclear weapons, expanding the categories of states and military alliances in respect to which Russia exercises nuclear deterrence.

    "text": "Border Patrol agent fires shots outside gated community, investigation underway LAREDO, Tex. (KGNS) - A Border Patrol agent fired two shots while on duty near La Bota Ranch on September 25, according to a statement from Customs and Border Protection (CBP). [Witnesses saw several DPS and Border Patrol agents at the scene just before 10 p.m.](https://www.kgns.tv/2024/09/26/law-enforcement-presence-sighted-front-la-bota-ranch/) At the time, it was unclear what led to the shots or who fired them. Agents had stopped a vehicle suspected of smuggling people near the Mines Road area. No one was hurt during the incident. CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility is reviewing the case. “More information will be shared as it becomes available,” CBP said. On Thursday, Sept. 26, KGNS was directed by DPS to contact the FBI about the case but the agency declined to comment. The investigation is ongoing.

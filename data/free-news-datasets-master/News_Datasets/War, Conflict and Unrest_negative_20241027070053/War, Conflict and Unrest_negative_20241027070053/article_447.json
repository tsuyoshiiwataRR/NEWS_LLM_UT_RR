    "text": "NEW YORK: The US has accused Russia of discussing weapon transfers with Houthis, whose attacks on Red Sea shipping are holding hostage a vital commercial waterway.\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, US Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking said Moscow was “cutting its deals” with the Houthis to allow their ships to sail through the Red Sea unharmed.\n“We have confirmation that the Russians and the Houthis are in dialogue about ways to cooperate,” including on weapon transfers, Lenderking said.\n“We don’t know that weapons are being transferred as we speak, but it’s come to the point that we’re all sounding the alarm bell to ensure this does not happen,” he added.\nIf the weapon transfers were to materialize, it “could potentially change the conflict in a significant manner,” Lenderking said, warning of “an escalation” that would derail already stalled efforts to end Yemen’s war.\n“The notion that the Russians would provide the Houthis with lethal weapons is deeply alarming to the countries of the region,” he said.\nRussia has been stepping up military relationships with Iran and North Korea, both under heavy sanctions, as it seeks to bolster its arsenal in its war in Ukraine.\nRussia’s relationship with the US has deteriorated sharply since the invasion of Ukraine, with Washington leading the West in slapping sanctions on Moscow and arming Kyiv.\nThe Houthis have been firing drones and missiles at ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden since November, saying they are targeting vessels linked to Israel, the US, and Britain in a show of solidarity with Palestinians over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\nThe Houthi campaign has killed at least four sailors and sunk two ships.\nOne vessel — the Galaxy Leader — was hijacked in November and continues to be held by the Houthis along with its 25 international crew.",

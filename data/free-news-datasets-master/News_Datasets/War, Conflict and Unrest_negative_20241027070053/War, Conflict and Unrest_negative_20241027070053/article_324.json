    "text": "The Israeli hammering continues. For one more day Israeli forces struck southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah facilities. At the same time, the Lebanese organization tried for the first time to attack Tel Aviv.\nAccording to what has become known, he launched a missile aimed at Mossad headquarters, but Israel managed to shoot it down. Hezbollah’s arsenal is impressive to non-experts, especially since the Israelis claim to have inflicted heavy damage on it.\nHowever, the strikes of the Israelis are not enough for this many are those who consider that we are close to a total war.\nHezbollah’s underground arsenal Hezbollah reportedly has an underground arsenal and last month released footage that appeared to show its fighters driving trucks with rocket launchers through tunnels, according to two sources who spoke to Reuters.\nHezbollah’s arsenal reportedly includes about 150,000 rockets, the US congressional report said. The Lebanese organization has been building a network of tunnels for years which, according to Israeli calculations, stretches for hundreds of kilometers.\nThe Israeli military said Monday’s airstrikes hit Hezbollah rocket launchers under houses in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah has in the past stressed that it does not place military infrastructure near civilians.\nConfirmed details of the tunnel network remain scant. A 2021 report by Alma, the Israeli think tank specializing in Hezbollah, said Iran and North Korea helped build the tunnel network after the 2006 war.\nIsrael is sending more reserve brigades to the border with Lebanon Israel is deploying two more reserve brigades to its northern border for operational activities, the military said today after days of escalating airstrikes against Hezbollah targets in various parts of Lebanon.\n“This will enable the continuation of the fight against the terrorist organization Hezbollah, the defense of the State of Israel, and create the conditions for the residents of northern Israel to return to their homes,” the army said in a statement.\nIsraeli media reported, moreover, that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is calling a meeting of the Council of Ministers for 20:00 Greek time.\nThe pounding of Israel continues, the dead are increasing The Israeli military announced today that it hit more than 280 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, from where the Islamist group fires rockets into Israeli territory.\nAfter “several missiles” were fired from Lebanon “by the Hezbollah terrorist organization” the military “hit the launchers used” for those attacks as well as “other terrorist targets,” the statement said. In total, “more than 280 Hezbollah terrorist targets” were hit, according to the military.\nMeanwhile, Lebanon’s health ministry said 23 people were killed today in Israeli raids on various communities, some of them in mountainous areas outside Hezbollah strongholds, as the Israeli military says it continues “large-scale” shelling.\nSOURCE: APE-ME, REUTERS\n#Lebanon #Hezbollahs #hidden #weapons #Israel #Death #toll #rises",

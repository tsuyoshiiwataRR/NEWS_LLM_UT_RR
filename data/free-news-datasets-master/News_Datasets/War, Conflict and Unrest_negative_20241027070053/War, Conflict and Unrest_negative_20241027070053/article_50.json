    "text": "Israel and Hezbollah are exchanging hundreds of cross-border strikes in the wake of the [shocking explosions of wireless devices](https://abcnews.go.com/International/pagers-exploded-lebanon-syria/story?id=113800213) across Lebanon last week. 'No cease-fire' in Lebanon, Israel's foreign minister says Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz declared on social media on Thursday that there \"will be no ceasefire in the north,\" as U.S.-led efforts to prevent a full-scale Israeli invasion of Lebanon appeared to fall flat. \"We will continue to fight against the terrorist organization Hezbollah with all our might until victory and the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes,\" Katz wrote in a post to X. The statement came shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed reports that the U.S. was gathering international support for a 21-day cease-fire. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday the plan had \"significant\" backing. \"This is an American-French proposal, to which the prime minister did not even respond,\" a post to Netanyahu's official X page said. The Israel Defense Forces continued its bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon overnight into Thursday while its troops prepared for an expected ground operation. Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the chief of the IDF General Staff, told units at the northern border on Wednesday: \"We are preparing the process of a maneuver, which means your military boots, your maneuvering boots, will enter enemy territory.\" -ABC News' Jordana Miller and David Brennan IDF continues deadly strikes as ground offensive looms At least 23 more people were killed as Israeli warplanes continued airstrikes in Lebanon through Thursday morning. The Israel Defense Forces said its aircraft struck approximately 75 Hezbollah targets in the south of the country and the eastern Bekaa region overnight. The force said it is continuing operations \"to dismantle and degrade Hezbollah's capabilities.\" Since Monday, Israel's intensified air campaign killed nearly 700 people and wounded more than 1,700 others, per data from the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. The IDF said Hezbollah fired approximately 45 projectiles into Israel from Lebanon on Thursday morning, some of which were intercepted with the rest falling in open areas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, dismissed hopes of a U.S.-brokered cease-fire that would forestall Israel's planned ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Netanyahu \"instructed the IDF to continue the fighting with full force and according to the plans presented to him,\" according to a statement published on his official X page on Thursday. -ABC News' Jordana Miller and Joe Simonetti Netanyahu says cease-fire news 'incorrect,' vows to continue fight in Gaza Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said news about a potential cease-fire deal between Hezbollah and Israel being discussed is \"incorrect.\" \"This is an American-French proposal, to which the prime minister did not even respond,\" he said in [a statement](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1839227205022257224) posted on social media on Thursday. He added, \"The news about the supposed directive to moderate the fighting in the north is also the opposite of the truth. The Prime Minister instructed the IDF to continue the fighting with full force, and according to the plans presented to him. Also, the fighting in Gaza will continue until all the goals of the war are achieved.\" -ABC News' Joe Simonetti and Kevin Shalvey Biden says 'significant support' for Israel-Lebanon cease-fire plan President Joe Biden told reporters outside the White House on Wednesday night that the U.S. was \"able to generate significant support from Europe, as well as the Arab nations\" for a 21-day cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah to head off a full-scale war in Lebanon. \"It's important this war not widen,\" the president said. \"I'll have more to say about it tomorrow.\" In a call with reporters just before the president landed, senior administration officials described the proposal as a \"breakthrough\" they hoped would produce momentum in Lebanon and in stalled talks between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip \"This is an important breakthrough on the Lebanon side, given all that has gone on there, particularly over the last few weeks,\" a senior administration official said. \"But you know, we will try to use the space that provides wisely on all on all fronts.\" The officials indicated that a response is expected over the next several hours. \"I guess the parties are going to respond for themselves to the call, but I can share that we have had this conversation with the parties and felt this was the right moment, based on the call, based on our discussion, they are familiar with the text and again, we'll let them speak to their actions of accepting the deal in the coming hours,\" a senior administration official said. Officials said they'd been negotiating with Lebanon nonstop for the past 48 hours, and that its leaders there were aware they speak for \"everything that happens on that side of the border,\" indicating that they will accept the deal on behalf of Hezbollah. \"So our expectation is when the government of Lebanon or when the government of Israel both accept this, this will carry and be implemented as a ceasefire on both sides, on both sides of the blue line, for the period of the 21 days,\" an official said. -ABC News Cheyenne Haslett US troops in Cyprus preparing for Lebanon evacuations, official confirms A U.S. official confirmed to ABC News that the small number of additional American military personnel deployed to the Middle East are on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, where they are planning for \"non-combatant evacuation operations\" in Lebanon. The planning remains a precautionary measure, the official said. ABC News understands that between 12 and 24 American troops are involved in the preparations, not all of whom are special operations personnel. Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said Wednesday she could not confirm the exact number of personnel deployed. \"What I can tell you is that we are sending a small number of additional U.S. military personnel forward to augment forces that are already in the region,\" she told reporters. \"I'm just not going to be able to provide you more specifics,\" she added. \"I know it's frustrating, but I'm just not going to be able to confirm more.\" -ABC News' Luis Martinez Israel to use 'all means' in Lebanon if diplomacy fails, diplomat says Danny Danon, Israel's permanent representative to the United Nations, told reporters on Wednesday that his nation would \"prefer a diplomatic solution\" to its unfolding conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon, but that \"if it fails to return our residents to their homes, then we will use all means at our disposal.\" \"We are entirely focused on achieving our objectives, which in the north is the return of our displaced citizens who have become refugees in their own country,\" Dannon said. \"Do not mistake a peaceful nation for a defenseless one. We have the means, we have the capabilities to achieve this goal.\" Danon again expressed that Israel was \"open to ideas\" to avoid a full-scale war. \"But you know, we are very honest about it. Our goal is to push Hezbollah from the fence, allow the residents to come back to the communities, and I hope we'll be able to achieve it without using our military capabilities,\" he said. Israel is already conducting an extensive airstrike campaign across southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, as well as limited airstrikes in the capital Beirut and elsewhere. Israeli actions have killed more than 650 people -- including at least 50 children -- and wounded more than 1,700 others since Monday, according to Lebanese authorities. Danon declined to weigh in on whether progress had been made towards a pause, but said negotiators \"know exactly what we expect.\" -ABC News' Shannon Kingston Iran will not be 'indifferent' if Israel invades Lebanon, minister says Iran \"will not remain indifferent in case of a full-scale war in Lebanon,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters Wednesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Araghchi also warned that Israel's \"crimes will not go unpunished,\" and said the Middle East region \"risks full-scale conflict\" if the U.N. Security Council does not \"act now to halt Israel's war and enforce an immediate ceasefire.\" \"The path to de-escalation is clear,\" Araghchi said. \"Israel must immediately stop its attacks on Gaza and Lebanon. Without a ceasefire in Gaza, there will be no guarantee of peace in the region.\" \"The Security Council must act now to halt Israel's war and enforce an immediate ceasefire, and by that, to save innocent lives. If not, the region risks full-scale conflict and history will hold Israel's enablers, especially the United States, responsible.\" \"Iran will not remain indifferent in case of a full-scale war in Lebanon,\" the diplomat added. \"We stand with the people of Lebanon with all means.\" -ABC News' Ellie Kaufman",

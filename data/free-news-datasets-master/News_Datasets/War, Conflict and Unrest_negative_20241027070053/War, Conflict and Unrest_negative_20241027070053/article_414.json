    "text": "Today, in the Assembly of Montenegro, the parliamentary majority of Spajić and Mandić showed the citizens that for the sake of their seats, they are ready to trample on all values and principles, including the right of the opposition to speak, announced the Civic Movement URA. \"Vice President of the Assembly Zdenka Popović did not allow the opposition to speak, nor did she use the procedural reaction to which deputies are entitled according to the Rules of Procedure. This shameful attitude towards her colleagues and the Assembly of Montenegro, according to the Rules of Procedure, which they are obliged to respect, is not a surprise, because Vice President Popović only took over and continued the practices of Mandić and Spajić,\" stated the GP URA. They add that this is why \"it is not surprising that she immediately received praise from Prime Minister Spajić for this kind of relationship\". \"We are sure that the citizens of Montenegro, regardless of political differences, will never support the seduction of dictatorship and single-mindedness, which is obviously the ultimate goal of this parliamentary majority. It is clear that behind this arrogant behavior today in the Assembly is hidden panic and fear of the election the results of Spajić's list on Sunday in Podgorica,\" concluded the URA. Bonus video:",

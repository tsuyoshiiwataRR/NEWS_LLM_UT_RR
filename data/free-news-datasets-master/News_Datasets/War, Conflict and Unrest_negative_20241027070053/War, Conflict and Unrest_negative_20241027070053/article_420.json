This contributed to the widespread spread of the disease and the death of dozens, including 34 children near the Tin Zouatin area. Six cemeteries were opened in one day for the funeral of the victims.\nThe most dangerous type of malaria\nMedical workers recorded thousands of cases of malaria during the past weeks, and sources pointed to the accumulation of sick and displaced people on the Algerian border and the border with Mauritania. These people are exposed to the risk of death daily due to the lack of medicines, amid demands for humanitarian and charitable organizations to intervene urgently.\nHassan Aleh and Nahar, a doctor working in Azawad, told Sky News Arabia that “the health system is currently completely exhausted,” and he attributed this to the following conditions:\nThe disease coincides with heavy rainfall and flooding in the region; Which increases its spread. There is a severe shortage of medicines to treat malaria in hospitals and health centers, and their absence in areas of displacement, due to the tense security conditions and the lack of clean water and sanitary shelter, as well as in desert areas that lack basic health care. Conquering the disease requires cleaning wetlands, removing weeds, draining ponds, distributing mosquito nets, and raising public awareness, all of which requires significant resources. This year, Azawad province witnessed the spread of falciparum malaria, which is considered the most dangerous type of malaria. It is characterized by its resistance to drugs and its serious complications. Which leads to a significant increase in the number of deaths. The security conditions make it difficult to count the number of deaths, which some estimate in the hundreds, as well as the difficulty of counting the injuries, which Wahanhara describes as a “real disaster.”\nSince August 2023, the Azawad region has witnessed widespread hostilities, at intermittent intervals, between the Malian army and the Russian armed company “Wagner” on the one hand, and armed groups seeking independence in the Azawad region on the other hand, and their frequency has increased in recent weeks, in addition to confrontations with terrorist groups. Affiliated with Al-Qaeda and ISIS.\nSpreading infection through displacement\nRegarding the impact of this fighting, Ayoub Ag Shamad, spokesman for the Imohag Organization for Justice and Transparency, told Sky News Arabia that it caused the destruction of a large part of the health infrastructure. This made it difficult for health services and humanitarian organizations to reach the affected population.\nHe also points out that the displacement of a large number of residents; Fleeing from the fighting, they carried the infection to other areas, especially with the overcrowding in the camps, the absence of sanitation, and the lack of food. In addition, the state of fear and anxiety that accompanies the displaced affects their physical and psychological health. It increases their exposure to diseases.\nAccording to Ayoub Ag Shamad, a campaign has been launched to collect donations and medicines, but the closure of the borders is hindering the rapid arrival of aid. He expressed his deep concern by saying that “the health system is currently collapsed.”\nThis year, Mali recorded more than 3 million cases of malaria, according to information published by the National Malaria Control Programme, on the occasion of World Malaria Day, corresponding to April 25, 2024, but its spread varies from one region to another, and the combat and security conditions in the Azawad region have caused it to have a large share.

At a campaign event in North Carolina, Trump went after Zelenskyy for \"making little nasty aspersions\" toward him. While Trump didn't elaborate on what the comments were, Zelenskyy was recently critical of Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, in an interview with The New Yorker. Zelenskyy expressed doubt Trump knew how to end the Russia-Ukraine war despite Trump's assertions, without detail or specifics, that the war never would have happened if he were president and he could end it on the first day of his new administration. https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-lashes-zelenskyy-ukraines-leader-204300620.html [InfoView thread info, including edit history](/?com=thread&info=1&address=100219505857) [TrashPut this thread in your Trash Can (My DU » Trash Can)](/?com=login) [BookmarkAdd this thread to your Bookmarks (My DU » Bookmarks)](/?com=login)9 replies, 344 views [ShareGet links to this post and/or share on social media] [AlertAlert this post for a rule violation](/?com=login) [PowersThere are no powers you can use on this post] [EditCannot edit other people's posts] [ReplyReply to this post](/?com=post&post&forum=1002&pid=19505857) [EditCannot edit other people's posts] [Rec (9)] [ReplyReply to this post](/?com=post&forum=1002&pid=19505857) [NoneDon't highlight anything](#!)

(WJFW)- The Never Forgotten Honor Flight flew from Mosinee to Washington D.C. and back on September 23. On that flight, 94 Korean and Vietnam Veterans from 13 different Wisconsin counties visited multiple different memorials.Mitch Fisher is a Vietnam Era War Veteran that served in the United States Air Force. He has visited Washington D.C. before but every time, he is moved by the experience, and traveling with the Honor Flight brought new memories.“The monuments, the changing of the guard, I don’t know how many times you can see it but I always feels moved by it, it’s a tremendous experience,” said Fisher. “I stand here and that black wall there are names of 58,000 others on there who served about the same time I did.” Mitch says that when the experience began, nobody had any certainty as to what was to happen during their time in service.“Nobody had any guarantees when we went in, there were no promises or jobs or first duty assignments, anything like that,\" said Fisher. \"Essentially, we all wrote a blank check that said train us to meet your needs and send us where you will, some were not fortunate, the blank check was cashed with a flag draped casket and a military funeral.” Mitch says that despite if you are a Veteran or not, visiting the memorials and monuments in D.C. can help to educate people on what the service members experienced.“I think each of us understand the pain, the heroism, the anxiety, especially of those who waited at home for their return, if you haven’t done it come to D.C. and see these thing yourself it’s important,” said Fisher.Never Forgotten Honor Flight stories will air 9/24/24 - 9/27/24.

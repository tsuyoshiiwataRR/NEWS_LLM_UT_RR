    "text": "This article was originally [published ](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-war-kramatorsk-kherson-glide-bombs/33135090.html)by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and is reprinted with permission. The number of people killed in a Russian attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk rose to two people, regional Governor Vadym Filashkin said on September 25. “As of 5:30 p.m. we know of 2 deaths in Kramatorsk. This afternoon, the Russians dropped three guided aerial bombs on the city. 2 people died and at least 12 were injured. Three children are among the wounded,” Filashkin [said ](https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-kramatorsk-zhertvy/33134939.html)on Telegram. Local authorities said Russian troops targeted the center of Kramatorsk, damaging two high-rise buildings, shops, and cars. Kramatorsk, which lies about 20 kilometers from the front line, has been hit by two deadly missile strikes that took numerous lives since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. One killed 13 in June last year, and the other hit the city’s train station in April 2022, killing more than 60 civilians. The Kherson region also came under Russian shelling on September 25, local authorities report. An 80-year-old woman was killed, and two people on the street were injured. In addition, a 48-year-old local resident was taken to the hospital with injuries to her face and forearm, Kherson Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Telegram. Prokudin said earlier that Kherson city was under attack by Russian aircraft. Russian forces also used glide bombs in that attack. One of the bombs hit a cultural institution, seriously damaging the building and setting off a fire. There was no information about victims, he said. Later in the day Prokudin [said ](https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-herson-obstril-zahynula-zhinka/33134783.html)Kherson remained under attack and called on the townspeople to remain in shelters. Earlier on September 25, the Ukrainian Air Force said the country’s air defenses shot down 28 drones and four missiles launched by Russia at 10 regions. In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops have stepped up their attacks on the Donetsk stronghold of Vuhledar as they seek access to the logistics hub of Pokrovsk, some 80 kilometers to the north. Denis Pushilin, the Russian-installed head of the occupied part of Ukraine’s Donetsk region, [said](https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-vugleda-vidstup-zsu-umovy-tymochko/33134413.html) on September 25 that fighting was ongoing in Vuhledar, although the Ukrainian military said the city was not yet surrounded by Russian forces.",

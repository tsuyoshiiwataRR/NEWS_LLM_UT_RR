    "text": "Law enforcement agencies are investigating to find the person or persons who murdered an Otsego County man. On Wednesday, deputies and state police troopers were dispatched for a report of an \"unresponsive man\" at a Hayes Township residence, the Otsego County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. By the time authorities arrived, the 31-year-old man had been dead for \"an undetermined amount of time,\" the sheriff's office said. A medical examiner investigator was then called and determined the man had been murdered. \"To date, no suspect(s) have been identified and the investigation is ongoing,\" the sheriff's office said. The sheriff's office said they believe this was an isolated incident and do not believe there is any danger to the public. Anyone with information is asked to contact the sheriff's office by calling 989-732-3555. The Michigan State Police Grayling Crime Lab and the Michigan State Police Computer Crimes Unit are assisting the sheriff's office in the homicide investigation.",

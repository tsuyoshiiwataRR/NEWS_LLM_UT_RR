    "text": "Fenerbahce basketball team forward Hayes Davis has been targeted by Turks on social media after a post he made about the Armenian genocide.\nHayes Davies visited Yerevan, Armenia and posted pictures of the Armenian Genocide memorial, causing outrage in Turkey. The American Fenerbahce player even had to delete his post, but also move on to new ones, explaining that he did not intend to hurt people.\nPost Hayes Davis\n“I hear you, but I just went to see the museum. I don’t know enough to start preaching. You already told me that I play basketball in Turkey, so I’m not going to say anything disrespectful. I’m just a tourist with a cameraman. I try to learn as much as I can and be unbiased.\nAfter my post, I realized that the topic I shared about Armenia and Turkey was very sensitive. As much as I try to learn, I don’t know everything. Out of appreciation and respect for what Turkey has given me, personally and professionally, I would like to say that I did not intend to intentionally cause disrespect to Turkey, its history or its citizens.\nThose who know me personally and have spoken to me on the matter know that what I say is sincere. I am not Turkish, so I did not understand how serious this issue is for Turks. I hope this clears up any misunderstandings or misinterpretations about my words, actions and especially my character. To tell those who were hurt by this situation that he didn’t mean to hurt them.”\nHayes Davies was one of Fenerbahce’s key players last season.\nFollow us for all news on Bing News and Google News",

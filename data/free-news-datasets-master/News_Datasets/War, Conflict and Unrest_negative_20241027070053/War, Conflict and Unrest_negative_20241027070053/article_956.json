    "text": "\"Bombs were falling everywhere\" - Testimony of people fleeing the airstrikes in Lebanon Israel's attacks on Hezbollah targets have had a chilling effect on local civilians, who have been forced to flee place after place in search of safety. Cross-border attacks by Israel and Hezbollah have displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides, reports \"[with the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3g1dplppo)\". In Lebanon, recent Israeli airstrikes have killed 600 people, injured thousands and displaced another 90.000. Some of those fleeing their homes told the BBC of their experiences, leaving their possessions behind, relying on strangers to survive. Among them is Valentin Nesser, a journalist who fled southern Lebanon with her mother and brother on Monday, as intense bombardment made Lebanon's deadliest day in decades. \"We went to Mount Lebanon, about 30 minutes from Beirut, which is currently considered a safe zone,\" she said. Their journey took 15 hours due to heavy traffic as thousands tried to escape. \"We came here with nothing because the bombs were everywhere and we want to be safe as soon as possible,\" she added. We are in a hotel that has been turned into a center for displaced people and now there are more than 300 people and counting. We have, for example, 50 people in the same room. Many people have still not found a place to stay and some have been forced to sleep in their cars. She said local authorities were providing food and water, adding that although she had lived through periods of conflict before, this time was different. \"This time there is more tension, more sadness, more anger, Neser said.",

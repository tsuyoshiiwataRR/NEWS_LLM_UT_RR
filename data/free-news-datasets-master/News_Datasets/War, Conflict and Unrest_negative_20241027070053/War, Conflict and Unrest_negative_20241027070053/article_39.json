    "text": "AA/ Dakar/ Alioune Ndiaye The Senegalese President, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, deplored on Wednesday the tragic situation which persists in Palestine, describing the war from which it arises “an open wound on the international conscience”. Faye, who spoke at the 79th ordinary session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, called for an immediate and lasting ceasefire. “I once again express Senegal’s concern about the tragic situation that persists in Palestine. Entire generations have grown up there under the shadow of oppression, deprived of their fundamental right to a viable state,” the president underlined. Faye. “This war, which spares neither women, nor children, nor vital infrastructure, is an open wound on the international conscience,” he said, reiterating on behalf of his country, which chairs the Committee for exercise of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, its support for the two-state solution. “It is imperative that international humanitarian law be reestablished in all conflict zones,” he advised, not without deploring numerous violations of international law around the world. “We see every day that international law, the cement of world peace, is often violated. Resolutions adopted by this same Assembly are ignored. By tolerating these repeated violations, we are trampling underfoot the principles of the United Nations Charter,” he argued. President Faye also pointed out the inertia of the United Nations on the situation in the Sahel. “We can no longer turn a blind eye to the tragedy unfolding in the Sahel (…) This region, once stable, is now prey to daily violence, while the United Nations, and particularly the Security Council, too often remain inert,” noted Faye. “Similarly, we cannot accept that the Sahel becomes the scene of rivalries between foreign powers,” he continued, recalling that the peace and security of Africa are inseparable from world peace. “It is imperative that the Security Council fully fulfills its role as guarantor of international stability,” he said. “Leaving no one behind: acting together for peace, sustainable development and human dignity for present and future generations” is the theme of the general debate of the session.

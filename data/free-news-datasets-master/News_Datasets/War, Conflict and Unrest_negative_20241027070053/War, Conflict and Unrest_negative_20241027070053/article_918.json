    "text": "Gaza’s Health Ministry said Thursday that Israeli forces killed another 39 Palestinians and wounded 86 in the previous 24-hour period.\nThe latest violence brings the ministry’s death toll since October 7, 2023, to 41,534 and the number of wounded to 96,092. The toll is an undercount since it doesn’t include the estimated 10,000 people who are missing and presumed dead under the rubble.\n“There are still a number of victims under the rubble and on the streets, and ambulance and civil defense crews cannot reach them,” the ministry said on Telegram.\nPalestinians inspect the site of an Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced people in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip on September 26, 2024. REUTERS/Mahmoud Issa Israeli strikes on Thursday included the bombing of another school-turned-shelter in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza . Al Jazeera reported that the strike on the Hafsa al-Faluja school killed at least 15 people.\nGaza’s Civil Defense said the dead in the school strike included women and children . Israel took credit for the strike and claimed it targeted a Hamas “command and control center” but offered no evidence.\nSchools sheltering displaced have become frequent targets of Israeli bombs in recent months. On September 21, Israel targeted a school in the al-Zeitoun neighborhood in Gaza City, killing at least 22 people, including 13 children and six women.\nLast week, Gaza’s Health Ministry released the names of 34,344 Palestinians who have been killed by Israeli forces, including 11,355 children. Among the children were 710 infants who did not make it to their first birthday.\nThe Biden administration continues to support the genocidal slaughter in Gaza by providing weapons to the Israeli military. Israel’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that it secured $8.7 billion in fresh military aid from the US.",

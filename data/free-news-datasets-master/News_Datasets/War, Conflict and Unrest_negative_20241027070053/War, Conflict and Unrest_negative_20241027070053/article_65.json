    "text": "Many theories have been advanced to determine the nature of the ties holding the MAGA coalition together all these years. To be clear, the spell has yet to be broken, the current race pitting MAGA against democracy, we are told, is still too close to call. There is a feeling, however, that its tired message is getting old and dated. Hardcore MAGA adherents will be the last ones off the island, but already we are witnessing some “MAGA adjacents” scurrying for the lifeboats. Autocratic delusions have visited our politics time and again throughout our history. They have come using many names, MAGA being the latest incarnation. However, the common platform MAGA strategists employ to define itself is highly derivative. It always involves grievance and fear of a diminishing status among their group. Trump’s saddled MAGA on the backs of immigrants ever since his opening gambit in 2016 and is using them, yet again, in this campaign. Haitians have replaced Mexicans in this iteration but the playbook remains the same. Make them a threat so we can fear them. Immigration is a valid issue, but one that deserves some context. Those standing at our borders are not the enemy no matter how the right frames the issue. They are all like most of our ancestors looking for an opportunity. Our status as a nation of immigrants is the thing, in large part, that has distinguished us from other nations. Most of us are all sons and daughters of immigrants. Native Americans and enslaved blacks have had good reason to fear our forefathers and their dreams of expansion and riches. Still, the MAGA movement borrows heavily from the historically debunked theories that have cropped up as responses to real threats to our national security. Last century they came dressed as American Firsters and isolationists preceding both World Wars in deference to Nazis and European authoritarians. After the wars, they hid beneath the veneer of anti-communism and anti-government states’ rights advocates— their real agenda always hidden under a thin patina of anti-semitism, racism, and white supremacy. American Isolationists or America Firsters suggest that the United States can effectively cut itself off from the rest of the world— a mistaken illusion that denies our founding principles. America has the rest of the world woven into its very fabric. Immigrants have been a source of our economic and cultural hegemony in the world since the Mayflower dropped anchor off the shore of Massachusetts: Such ardor for territorial expansion across North America and commercial activism beyond the nation’s shores has prompted some scholars of U.S. foreign policy to dismiss the notion that the United States ever was isolationist. Historian Robert Kagan argues that the United States was a “dangerous nation” from the start and that Americans have always pursued “aggressive expansionism” and “acquisitive materialism.” Political scientist Bear Braumoeller calls U.S. isolationism a “myth,” maintaining that even during the 1920s, after the United States had refused to enter the League of Nations and pulled away from strategic engagement in Europe and East Asia, the nation was deeply engaged abroad, adroitly using its commercial and financial strength—“banks rather than tanks”—to pursue its objectives. — Council of Foreign Relations, “An Anatomy of Isolationism” Such ardor for territorial expansion across North America and commercial activism beyond the nation’s shores has prompted some scholars of U.S. foreign policy to dismiss the notion that the United States ever was isolationist.

Within that group, a recurrent recidivist core of right-wing extremists uses this as cover for spates of racist hatred. What Washington alluded to has been seized on by them to suggest an undifferentiated notion of isolationism. Washington’s warning that we should steer clear of 18th-century European affairs was uttered within the context of a European political environment that included petty disagreements going back centuries. Washington wisely believed our independence from European masters required distancing from continental politics. Meanwhile, it was those very conditions and the failures of European governments that drove the mid-to-late 19th-century immigration of Europeans to America. The cultural differences separating European states aligned with the general weariness of poor and long-suffering and governments that served their interests poorly roused their interest in a “new world” an ocean away. The indifference to their plight by the rich and powerful was a motivator for large groups of immigrants braving the long journey to an America that could only offer them opportunity. And like today’s immigrants, for them opportunity was enough. Most of us are beneficiaries of their bravery and vision. The isolationist threads that hold parts of the MAGA movement together are rather weak. Trump’s latest riff is one that includes a warning that a Harris-Walz administration would continue our strong support of Ukraine and that would likely lead to our sending American troops to help defend an ally. The annoying truth hidden within Trump’s claim is his personal interest in a Russian victory and the threat Russia poses to NATO. Putin‘s naked aggression in invading an independent nation exposes the likelihood that ignoring Russian aggression in Ukraine would represent a threat to our NATO allies which includes our vital national interests. Both Putin and Trump share a desire for the breakup of the essential alliance of democracies in opposition to autocrats like Putin. In a New York Times guest opinion article, Thomas Edsall writes about Trump’s followers and the mystery of their affiliation with him: Trump has remained a powerful, if not dominant, political figure by weaving together a tapestry of resentment and victimhood. He has tapped into a bloc of voters for whom truth is irrelevant. The Trump coalition is driven to some extent by white males suffering status decline, but the real glue holding his coalition together is arguably racial animus and general resentment toward minorities. — NYTimes, “The Real Trump Mystery,” by Thomas B.

The Trump coalition is driven to some extent by white males suffering status decline, but the real glue holding his coalition together is arguably racial animus and general resentment toward minorities. — NYTimes, “The Real Trump Mystery,” by Thomas B. Edsall Edsall explores the secret behind the allegiance between Trump and the right-wing faction that goes deeper than the ardor of Hillary’s deplorables or the grifting behind the MAGA merch-a-thons. The hate that fuels Trump has been a constant evil that lives within America’s origin story. It was there when the founders signed on to the agreement that was based on a compromise that allowed slavery to live on as an American outrage. After a bitter war fought to end slavery, the ensuing racial hatred remains alive within the MAGA core. It was present at the indiscriminate destruction of Native American cultures and the resultant genocide of their people. The same antipathy has been behind the fight against suffrage and the ERA. It is now extended to rights owed to LGBTQ+ citizens and focused on the denial of women’s reproductive rights. America’s saving grace has always been in the margins. The margins that still hold keeping Trump and his most ardent followers at bay. Margins that allow us to proudly point to our success in perfecting our democracy through legislation and court decisions. The white nationalists, neo-Nazis, KKK members, misogynists, the 1950s McCarthyites, America Firsters, et.al. have always been at the core of the ad hoc movements they create— all of them expedient to the moment, hidden within a cultish clique of easily outraged followers. Edsall goes on to quote from a 2021 paper written by the political scientists Lilliana Mason, Julie Wronski, and John V. Kane that may explain the dynamics of movements throughout our history and why they fail: Mason, Wronski and Kane analyzed data collected by the Democracy Fund’s Voter Study Group from polls in which “respondents were asked to indicate their feelings toward these four Democratic-aligned social groups.” The result? Animosity toward Democratic-linked groups is strongly related to Trump approval. People who felt strong animosity toward Blacks, Hispanics, Muslims and L.G.B.T. people were significantly more likely to be fond of Trump. Interestingly, though, “feelings of animosity toward Democratic groups do not predict favorability toward the Republican Party, Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell,” Mason, Wronski and Kane wrote. Instead, “Trump support is uniquely predicted by animosity toward marginalized groups in the United States.” — NYTimes, Edsall Mason, Wronski and Kane analyzed data collected by the Democracy Fund’s Voter Study Group from polls in which “respondents were asked to indicate their feelings toward these four Democratic-aligned social groups.” The result?

Instead, “Trump support is uniquely predicted by animosity toward marginalized groups in the United States.” — NYTimes, Edsall Like a math equation, the writers have calculated the motivating factors that unite Trump’s core support, and perhaps have found the secret of why these movements are embedded among extreme conservative groups within the Republican Party. The straight line from one to the other is determined by a pronounced and predictable set of prejudices that never change. Their hatred outpaces any proposed “love of country” excuse they may use to disguise their anti-democratic leanings. These groups were always antithetical to America’s promise to all the “others” who inhabit their list of unworthies— women, immigrants, blacks, LGBTQs, and the liberal elites who have supported them. Trump and his base remain the enemy within— the fallen angels of our natures whom Lincoln alluded to in his First Inaugural Address: \"I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\" and while they didn’t prevail, the damage they inflicted on the nation continues. MAGA is nothing more than our fallen angels coalescing around newfound hatred and bigotry. They target the weak and disabled, the latest immigrant group, women, and those among us who need protection from the likes of them. They are a movement always in search of the right leader: ...Though they may remain relatively latent when leaders and parties draw attention elsewhere, the right leader can activate these attitudes and fold them into voters’ political judgments. — “Activating Animus: the Uniquely Social Roots of Trump Support,” by Lilliana Mason, Julie Wronski, and John V. Kan, 2021 ...Though they may remain relatively latent when leaders and parties draw attention elsewhere, the right leader can activate these attitudes and fold them into voters’ political judgments. — “Activating Animus: the Uniquely Social Roots of Trump Support,” by Lilliana Mason, Julie Wronski, and John V. Kan, 2021 Donald Trump is the latest in a long line of autocrat hopefuls who view our democracy as an inconvenient impediment to the imposition of their will. They are not new. Donald Trump is not a better or more effective version, but let us not mistake the truth that each incursion makes uncomfortably clear, the enemy is not foreign. It lives and is sustained from within the deep recesses of our national psyche. The words of James Baldwin suggest why we pretend to be shocked each time our past transgressions give rise to another outbreak of unremitting hate. The alternative is far more difficult to live with. Self-hate is our private atonement for the pain we have brought upon ourselves.",

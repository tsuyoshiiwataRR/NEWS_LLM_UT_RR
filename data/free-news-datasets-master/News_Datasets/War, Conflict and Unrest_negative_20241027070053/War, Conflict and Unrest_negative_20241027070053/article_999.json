    "text": "Ruben Navarrette: Trump's new scapegoat Is History's favorite fall guy: The Jews\nFrom the commentary, \" Now, according to Trump, they'll also be responsible for the loss of a candidate who — because of reckless comments like that — deserves to lose.\"\nSAN DIEGO — Twelve years ago, I returned from a life-changing trip to Israel with a priceless souvenir: an epiphany that Jewish Americans and Mexican Americans have a lot in common.\nBoth have proud immigrant histories and a culture that some see as so foreign as to be threatening. Both have endured discrimination in the United States and been accused of having \"divided loyalties\" between the United States and other countries (i.e., Israel and Mexico).\nIn the 20th century, both groups were barred from universities, country clubs and certain residential areas. Neither fit into a black and white paradigm; each has been considered \"white\" one minute, and \"non-white\" the next. Lastly, the two groups face the same bullies: white supremacists who carry out mass shootings to kill Jews and Mexicans.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNow we can add one more shared experience to the list: We've both been pinatas for former President Donald Trump.\nWhen Trump first ran for president in 2016, his favorite fall guy was Mexicans. He described our southern neighbors as having \"lots of problems.\" In the world according to Trump, Mexicans who migrated to the United States were \"bringing drugs\" and \"bringing crime.\"\nIn 2024, Trump has a new target, which happens to be one of the oldest scapegoats in all of human history dating back to ancient times.\nA national poll of Jewish voters recently conducted by the Jewish Democratic Council of America found overwhelming support for Trump's opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. The Democrat has the backing of 72% of Jewish voters while just 25% support Trump.\nADVERTISEMENT\nRuben Navarrette: Just gaze upon the stars of the Democratic National Convention: Our political future is female\nJewish voters usually support the Democratic presidential candidate -- no matter who it is. Even though Trump is seen by many political observers as more supportive of Israel than Harris, he is not likely to get a majority of the Jewish vote.\nHe shouldn't take it personally. But who are we kidding? It's one of Trump's biggest character flaws that he takes everything personally.\nAnd so lately, the former president has been lashing out at Jews, as if that cohort didn't have enough to worry about at the moment. With just about 40 days to go until the election, Trump seems to be trying to pressure Jewish voters to increase their support for his candidacy.\nOne of the benefits to being Mexican American in the Southwest is that you tend to have good antennae when political candidates zero in on a marginalized group and attempt to portray them as the problem.\nBut you don't need to have antennae to pick up on Trump's attacks on Jews. All you need are ears and eyes that are in good working order.\nRecently, Trump gave a speech via satellite to attendees of the Republican Jewish Coalition's Annual Leadership Summit in Las Vegas. Referring to Harris, Trump insisted that \"more than any people on Earth, Israel has to defeat her.\" He claimed that if Harris is elected, \"you're not going to have an Israel.\"\nThat's outrageous. Those comments are frightening and offensive. The Israelis can't defend their own country? They need Trump's help? They seem to have done a pretty good job of taking the fight to their enemies, even when they have to stand alone.\nThen things got personal. Trump may be the nominee of a political party that discounts victimhood, but he's still King of the Victims. Everyone and everything is out to get him, and life is just so darned unfair.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"I really haven't been treated right,\" he told the audience, implying that Jewish voters should be showing him more love.\n\"If I don't win this election ... in my opinion, the Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss,\" Trump said.\nEven in a nation with free speech, our public discourse isn't a free-for-all. There are lines. And Trump crossed one.\nDoyle McManus: How can millions of voters still be undecided between Trump and Harris? Here are their reasons\nHis comments about Jews started out being presumptuous, boorish and condescending. That was bad enough. But, when he started talking about how these people vote, he crossed into dangerous territory.\nTrump's remarks alarmed nationally syndicated radio host Michael Medved, who happens to be a good friend of mine.\n\"Is he getting ready to blame the Jews for an election loss?\" asked Medved, an observant Jew, on his show.\nIt sure sounds that way. It's not enough that Jews have been popular scapegoats for thousands of years of human history. Now, according to Trump, they'll also be responsible for the loss of a candidate who — because of reckless comments like that — deserves to lose.\nThis commentary is Ruben Navarrette's opinion.

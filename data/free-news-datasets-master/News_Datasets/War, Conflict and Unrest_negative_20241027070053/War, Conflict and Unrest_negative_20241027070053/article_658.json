    "text": "NEW YORK – A coalition of progressive Israeli and New York Jewish organizations gathered near the United Nations on Thursday morning with a clear message as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in New York ahead of his address before the international body: Stop putting political power above the lives of the hostages and all people in the region.\nGroups involved included the New York Jewish Agenda, Ameinu, J Street, T’ruah, UnXeptable, and Israelis for Peace NYC, among others.\nProtesters held signs reading, “The whole world needs to know, Netanyahu has got to go,” “From the river to the sea, we all deserve equality,” and “ President [Joe] Biden , save Israel from Netanyahu.”\nA blood-soaked effigy wearing a mask with Netanyahu’s face stood adjacent to the protesters with “the emperor has no clothes” and “end the war now” written across its body.\nDemonstrators with drums led chants of “war has no winners” and “there is no military solution.” Pro-Palestine protests outside Congress, 24 July (credit: REUTERS/Nathan Howard)\nSpeaker after speaker noted how the same coalition gathered outside the UN last year during the General Assembly, prior to October 7, to protest against Netanyahu.\n“We were here one year ago, standing together as Netanyahu spoke at this very Hall in the United Nations, putting forth an antidemocratic vision of extremism and dehumanization. One year later, we are here together again,” Amichai Lau-Lavie, founder of Lab/Shul NYC, said.\nLau-Lavie said he is here in grief for the Israelis who lost their lives on October 7 as a result of the Hamas brutal attack, in grief for over 40,000 Palestinians who have been murdered in Gaza, and in grief for the hostages whose families dreams of their return “only for their hopes to be in vain at the expense of the Israeli government’s torpedoing a deal.”\nAmong the speakers was New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander, who Lau-Lavie described to The Jerusalem Post as an active participant in the anti-Netanyahu, pro-democracy movement for years before becoming a candidate for mayor.\nLander cheekily acknowledged the chaos sweeping City Hall on Thursday as Mayor Eric Adams spent the morning downtown in court, where he was charged with five counts of federal charges, including bribery and wire fraud.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON – China sought to cover up the sinking of its newest nuclear-powered submarine, according to a senior US defense official.\nThe sinking at a shipyard earlier this year was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which also says that satellite imagery later showed large floating cranes arriving to salvage it.\n“It’s not surprising that the PLA Navy would try to conceal the fact that their new first-in-class nuclear-powered attack submarine sank pierside,” the senior US defense official says on condition of anonymity, referring to Beijing’s People’s Liberation Army Navy.\n“In addition to the obvious questions about training standards and equipment quality, the incident raises deeper questions about the PLA’s internal accountability and oversight of China’s defense industry — which has long been plagued by corruption,” the official adds.\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/senior-us-official-china-covered-up-sinking-of-newest-nuclear-powered-submarine/",

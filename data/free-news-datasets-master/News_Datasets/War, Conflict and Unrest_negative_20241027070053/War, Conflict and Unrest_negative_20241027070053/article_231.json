    "text": "Israeli military says Beirut strike killed Hezbollah drone unit leader The Israeli strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut killed the head of Hezbollah’s drone unit, Mohammed Srour, the Israeli army said, while initial reports indicated two deaths, without specifying their identities. “Fighter jets targeted and eliminated [Mohammed Srour]the commander of Hezbollah’s air unit in Beirut”the army said in a statement. “The Israeli strike targeted the commander of the drone unit, Mohammed Srour, known as Abu Saleh, whose fate is not yet known.”a source close to the pro-Iranian Lebanese movement had said earlier, speaking on condition of anonymity. According to the same source, Mohammed Srour, a mathematician, was among the movement’s senior commanders sent to Yemen to train the Houthi rebels, who are also supported by Iran. This is the fourth strike in a week targeting Hezbollah’s stronghold near the Lebanese capital. The target is not far from the site of another strike that killed Ibrahim Aqil, the commander of Hezbollah’s elite unit, and several other officials on Friday. In total, that strike on Friday killed 55 people, including seven children, according to the Lebanese health ministry.",

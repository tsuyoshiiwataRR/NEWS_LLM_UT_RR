    "text": "by Karen Faulkner, Worthy News Correspondent\n( Worthy News ) – Making no mention of the Lebanese Hezbollah terrorist group that the Israelis have been battling since October 8, the United States, Britain, EU, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and others on Wednesday called for an immediate 21-day ceasefire between “Lebanon and Israel” for diplomats to find a solution to the crisis.\nA Shia Islamist group founded after Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982, Hezbollah was influenced by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after Iran’s 1979 Revolution and is supported by the current Iranian regime.\nAlthough Hezbollah has a political wing with seats in the Lebanese parliament, the entire organization has been designated a terrorist group by the United States and other Western countries.\nAfter Hamas attacked Israel on October 7 last year, triggering the current war in Gaza, Hezbollah announced its solidarity with the Gaza Palestinians and has been firing thousands of rockets at northern Israel since October 8.\nAfter months of simmering tensions and cross-border fire, and some 60,000 Israelis having to evacuate their homes in the north, Israel recently ramped up the fight against Hezbollah to force it to stop its terrorist activity and allow Israeli civilians home.\nNow calling for an immediate ceasefire, the joint statement released by the White House late on Wednesday reads:\n“The situation between Lebanon and Israel since October 8th, 2023 is intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation,” the joint statement said.\n“Thus we call for an immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement,” it added.",

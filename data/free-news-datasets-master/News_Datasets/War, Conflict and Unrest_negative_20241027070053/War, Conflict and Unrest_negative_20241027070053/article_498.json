    "text": "C9 Entertainment is taking heat over its recent announcement for CIX .\nCIX | @CIX_Official/X Following Bae Jinyoung’s departure, fans of CIX have been waiting for new announcements about the group’s activities. On September 26, the group’s official account announced that C.I.X would perform their 3rd concert in Moscow, Russia, on October 26.\n| @CIX_Official/X In the past, due to the proximity, K-Pop groups would occasionally have stops in Russia. However, since Russia invaded Ukraine, this has not been the case.\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia escalated the ongoing war by invading Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians. The conflict is still ongoing, with more than 8 million Ukrainians fleeing the country in what has been the largest conflict in Europe since World War II.\nEmbed from Getty Images\nEmbed from Getty Images\nWith Russia having begun the invasion, many fans have expressed discomfort with the group going to perform in the country. Additionally, Moscow was recently targeted by a Ukrainian drone attack during which a woman was killed and three were injured, along with damage to dozens of homes.\nThe location where this drone strike occurred is just 64 km (around 39.75 miles) from the venue CIX are scheduled to perform at.\n| Maxim Shemetov/Reuters Moscow was previously insulated against attacks, but Ukraine has launched drone missions that venture deeper and deeper into the country.\nFans directed their criticism to the company, questioning their decision for the group. By sending the group to the country, some fear the company is showing implicit acceptance of what is happening and are not directing complaints at innocent civilians.\ni can't even begin to explain how many things are wrong w this like genuinely who the fuck came up w this idea and who the fuck approved it bc they need to be fired NOW https://t.co/pqNBHw2vIH\n— yy ☆ on break | CIX IS FIVE (@abcixer) September 26, 2024\nyou used the symbols of ukraine to announce a tour to the country of the aggressor that kills Ukrainians? what a crazy life. https://t.co/1NWFX4PwZr pic.twitter.com/dtKPR64AlK\n— skeityk✰︎ (@ONkoobi) September 26, 2024\nHow do you like blood money? Tell it to the Ukrainians who are being shelled by missiles from russian territory every day? Concert in russia = Supporting all war crimes and terrorism. #RussialsATerroristState https://t.co/W1bFiD6PPX\n— ♡weizhi (@chittaboi) September 26, 2024\nSource: CNN",

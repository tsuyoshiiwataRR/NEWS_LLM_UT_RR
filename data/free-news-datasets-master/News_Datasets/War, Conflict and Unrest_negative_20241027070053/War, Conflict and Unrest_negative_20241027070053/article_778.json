    "text": "Since launching its widespread airstrikes in Lebanon yesterday morning, the IDF says it has targeted some 400 medium-range rocket launchers, 70 weapon depots, and some 80 drones and cruise missiles.\nThey are among more than 1,500 Hezbollah targets hit in some 200 different areas of Lebanon, the military says. Most of the strikes have targeted homes where Hezbollah had stored munitions, according to the IDF.\nOver 250 fighter jets have participated in the strikes, dropping some 2,000 munitions, the military adds.\nThe IDF says it will continue to strike Hezbollah to destroy its capabilities and “change the security reality in the north.”\nIsrael’s top army commander tells troops: “Your entry will show Hezbollah what it’s like to meet a professional combat force,” as he touts a “possible” ground invasion of southern Lebanon.\nIsrael calls up two additional reserve brigades to the northern border as it continues its massive bombing campaign across Lebanon, killing hundreds of people and displacing more than 90,000.\nHezbollah says it fired a ballistic missile targeting Mossad’s headquarters near Tel Aviv.\nForeign ministers of Egypt, Iraq and Jordan condemn Israel’s “aggression” against Lebanon, warning it’s “pushing the region towards all-out war”.",

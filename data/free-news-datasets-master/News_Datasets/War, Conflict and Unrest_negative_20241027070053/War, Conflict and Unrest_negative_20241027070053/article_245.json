    "text": "The rivalry between [Eddie Hearn ](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/eddie-hearn/)and Simon Jordan is not new, and none of them are showing any signs of slowing down. The two have been out for each other throats because of their different opinions regarding boxing and integrity in sports. But the boiling point came in 2023 when the duo engaged in an hour-long debate on TalkSPORT talking about various things. Since then, the pair has been involved in constant back-and-forth online and Jordan has publicly criticized Hearn for his involvement with His Excellency Turki Alalshikh. But a new angle was added to this rivalry when Hearn claimed that the sports pundit ‚Äúbegged‚Äù for a meeting with His Excellency and Jordan hit back and called the Matchroom Promoter- a ‚ÄúFool.‚Äù None of them are ready to let even one word slide, as Hearn hit back and brutally warned Jordan. Eddie Hearn promises Jordan another schooling lesson ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Hearn replied to Jordan without wasting any time and asked the latter to, ‚ÄúPipe down or I will have to come in and school you again üòâ,‚Äù hinting at another appearance on TalkSPORT. What‚Äôs your reaction? Eddie Hearn just told Simon Jordan to \"pipe down\"! React! Reactions Honestly this man‚Äôs a fool ! Never once asked for a meeting with anyone in Saudi . Ironically I was asked to meet them on Mon sept 16 and I couldn‚Äôt make it ü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è They then said next day , I tried to re arrange meetings they then said they can‚Äôt make it . [https://t.co/wCtNx6U8k8]‚Äî Simon Jordan (@Sjopinion10) [September 26, 2024] The last time Hearn appeared on TalkSPORT, where Jordan criticized the Matchroom Boxing promoter‚Äôs way of handling certain boxing events, fighters management, and promotional deals. Jordan even questioned the integrity and ethics of Hearn and how he conducts business. Known for his outspokenness, Hearn retorted back in a furious nature and [defended his way of doing business](https://www.essentiallysports.com/boxing-news-eddie-hearn-brands-he-turki-alalshikh-critics-almost-borderline-racist-boxing-insider-rallies-in-support/) while challenging Jordan‚Äôs lack of knowledge of the boxing world. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Many boxing fans agreed with Hearn and his way of doing business as it is expanding opportunities and attracting more eyes to the sport. In the fans‚Äô eyes, Hearn was the clear winner of the argument, and according to the promoter, he won‚Äôt shy away from making another appearance at the talk show to teach Jordan some more. However, let‚Äôs get ready for some throwback. Jordan calls Hearn a ‚Äòfool‚Äô The latest chapter in this rivalry started when Jordan accused Hearn and [Frank Warren](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/frank-warren/) of ‚Äúbullying‚Äù Boxxer chief Ben Shalom during the [Anthony Joshua](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/anthony-joshua/) vs. [Daniel Dubois](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/daniel-dubois/) undercard fight. During the undercard fight, Hearn and Shalom got into a heated exchange, opening a window for Jordan to attack. Hearn and Warren both hit back at Jordan and the Matchroom Boxing promoter called the latter a ‚Äúrogue hero of controversy.‚Äù Hearn further clarified that Jordan asked for a meeting with HE Turki Alalshikh. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Jordan, who has been against the Saudi regime in boxing for a long time, denied the accusation as he came out with guns blazing. He not only called Hearn a ‚Äúfool‚Äù but also stated that he ‚ÄúNever once asked for a meeting with anyone in Saudi.‚Äù He further clarified that he was asked to meet the royals on September 16, but he couldn‚Äôt make it and further attempts to arrange another meeting were unsuccessful. Hearn did not take this disrespect lightly and hit back at Jordan and savagely warned Jordan. What do you think about this ongoing beef between Eddie Hearn and Simon Jordan? Do you agree with Hearn‚Äôs way of conducting the business? Let us know your thoughts down below.",

    "text": "Sudan's Capital Engulfed in Conflict Amid Army's Major Offensive Sudan's army launched its largest offensive in the capital, Khartoum, to reclaim territory from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) before General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan's U.N. speech. The conflict has resulted in extensive casualties, displacement, and international concern, prompting calls for a ceasefire and humanitarian relief. Sudan's army launched an extensive operation involving artillery and airstrikes in the capital, Khartoum, marking its largest attempt to reclaim lost ground from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) since the war began 17 months ago, according to witnesses and military sources. This aggressive push precedes an address by army commander General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where he will emphasize that peace efforts are contingent upon the RSF disarming. Burhan accused unnamed countries of supporting the RSF with resources and insisted that the army would continue to fight despite such backing. On the ground, residents reported intense bombardments as army troops attempted to cross strategic bridges connecting Khartoum, Omdurman, and Bahri. Though the army has regained some territory, it primarily relies on artillery and airstrikes, struggling to dislodge RSF ground forces entrenched in various parts of the capital.

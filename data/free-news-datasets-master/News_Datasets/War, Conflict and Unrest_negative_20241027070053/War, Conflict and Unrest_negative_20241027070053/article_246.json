Sharing a birthday, Scottie Scheffler and Tom Kim have been good friends for a long time now. However, both of them are facing each other at the Presidents Cup. Scheffler is representing the American squad, while Kim is playing for Team International. Following a series of events, questions have arisen about their friendship. Let’s take a closer look at the situation. It all started with Thursday’s four-ball match at the Presidents Cup. Scottie Scheffler and Russell Henley were playing against Sungjae Im and Tom Kim. The #1 shot a crucial birdie putt on 7th Hole and excitedly yelled, “What was that?” Yes, just like you, the commentators were also surprised and said, “Scheffler is showing some emotion.” Scheffler is always rather calm on the course and very rarely lets his “psychotic” side out. As it happened, Kyle Porter, a renowned golf media personality, said, “Tom Kim looks (and should be) scared of Scottie.” Nevertheless, it’s still too soon to say that there is any bitterness in their friendship. However, later Tom Kim did something that even commentators found “disrespectful.” NUCLR GOLF shared a post on X revealing Tom Kim and Sungjae Im vacated the 8th hole to walk 60 yards away to the 9th tee box before Scottie Scheffler finished putting out. Talking about it, Paul McGinley said, “That’s bordering on bad behavior. That’s disrespectful in my opinion.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Witnessing this behavior, vice captains Kevin Kisner and Camilo Villegas walked up to Kim and Sungjae Im. John Wood revealed it, saying, “I’m not sure what was said, but it didn’t look all that friendly to be honest with you.” However, let’s not forget that both the golfers are in a tournament where the pressure is high on both teams. Not only that, [Scheffler is also known for being a very fierce competitor](https://www.essentiallysports.com/golf-news-psychotic-scottie-scheffler-left-five-x-pga-tour-champ-shaken-during-dire-pickleball-situation-insider-reveals/).

Individuals are suspected of hacking people close to Trump and sending info to reporters. Story w/ Betsy Woodruff Swan Last edited 5:59 PM · Sep 26, 2024 Politico - Iranians indicted in connection with Trump campaign hack The indictment could be unveiled as soon as Friday. By Betsy Woodruff Swan and Josh Gerstein 09/26/2024 05:47 PM EDT Updated: 09/26/2024 06:00 PM EDT A grand jury has indicted multiple Iranians on charges related to hacking Donald Trumps 2024 presidential campaign. The federal charges stem from an Iranian operation that allegedly stole internal Trump campaign communications this summer, according to three people familiar with the investigation who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. Stolen materials from the Trump campaign were later sent to journalists and the Joe Biden campaign before Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee. The names of the defendants and the specific criminal charges were not immediately available. A grand jury secretly approved the indictment on Thursday afternoon. The Justice Department is expected to announce the charges as soon as Friday. /snip Link to tweet Info View thread info, including edit history Trash Put this thread in your Trash Can (My DU » Trash Can) Bookmark Add this thread to your Bookmarks (My DU » Bookmarks) 0 replies, 151 views Share Get links to this post and/or share on social media Alert Alert this post for a rule violation Powers There are no powers you can use on this post Edit Cannot edit other people's posts Reply Reply to this post Edit Cannot edit other people's posts Rec (2) Reply Reply to this post Reply to this discussion https://pmatep5f7b.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ProdStage Latest Discussions » General Discussion » Politico: Iranians indict...

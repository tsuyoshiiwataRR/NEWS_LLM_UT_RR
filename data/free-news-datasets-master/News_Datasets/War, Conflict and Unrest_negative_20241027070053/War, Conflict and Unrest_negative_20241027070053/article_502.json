    "text": "Toronto FC played out a goalless draw against the Vancouver Whitecaps before falling to a 4-2 penalty shootout loss in the 2024 TELUS Canadian Championship Final at BC Place on Wednesday night. First Half: TFC Head Coach John Herdman rotated his side for the cup final, making nine changes from the starting eleven that featured on the road against Colorado Rapids on Saturday evening with Sigurd Rosted, Aimé Mabika, Kobe Franklin, Brandon Servania, Deybi Flores, Kosi Thompson, Tyrese Spicer, Derrick Etienne Jr. and Prince Owusu making way for Kevin Long, Raoul Petretta; Federico Bernardeschi, Jonathan Osorio, Alonso Coello, Matty Longstaff, Richie Laryea; Deandre Kerr and Lorenzo Insigne. The Reds began early proceedings on the front foot, testing Vancouver’s backline with four goalscoring attempts from Federico Bernardeschi, Shane O’Neill, Jonathan Osorio and Richie Laryea within the opening 20 minutes in British Columbia. After settling into the contest, Vancouver Whitecaps created opportunities of their own and Toronto’s Sean Johnson was on hand to make an important save to deny Fafa Picault’s powerful 35th minute effort. Moments later, TFC were awarded a penalty kick down the other end when Richie Laryea was hauled down by Vancouver’s Mathías Laborda, leaving referee Marie-Soleil Beaudoin with no option except to the penalty spot in the 37th minute. Federico Bernardeschi stepped up for the visitors and saw his effort saved by the goalkeeper Isaac Boehmer, who dove to his right to deny the Italian and keep the scores level at zero going into the half-time interval at BC Place. Second Half: Much like the first half, Toronto FC fashioned early opportunities to score the evening’s opening goal upon returning from the break. Richie Laryea first saw a long-range effort narrowly miss the target before Lorenzo Insigne volleyed Deandre Kerr’s low cross into the box a few inches wide of the mark within the first three minutes of the restart. Seeking the all-important breakthrough, both TFC and the Whitecaps exchanged opportunities to take the lead with both shot-stoppers called into action in the closing stages. In the 83rd minute, Toronto’s Sean Johnson made a routine save from Alessandro Schöpf’s long-range effort before Isaac Boehmer denied Federico Bernardeschi a late game-winner twice with a pair of crucial saves in the space of five minutes down the other end. With the two rivals unable to break the deadlock in regular time, the Canadian Championship was set to be decided by a penalty shootout for the fourth time in tournament history. Canadian goalkeeper Isaac Boehmer saved two penalties for Vancouver and helped the Whitecaps win the penalty shootout by a score of 4-2 and lift the 2024 TELUS Canadian Championship and earn a spot into the 2025 Concacaf Champions Cup. The Reds wrap up their three-game road stretch with a return to MLS action against the Chicago Fire on Saturday evening. Kick-off from SeatGeek Stadium in Bridgeview, Illinois is set for 8:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast globally on MLS Season Pass on Apple TV.

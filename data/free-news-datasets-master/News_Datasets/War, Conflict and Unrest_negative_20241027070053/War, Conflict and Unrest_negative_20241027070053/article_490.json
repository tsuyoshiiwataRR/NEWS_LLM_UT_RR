    "text": "Dimapur, September 26 (MExN): The 26th meeting of the 57th United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) session in Geneva focused on the escalating human rights crisis in Manipur and the broader Northeast region of India. The session, titled “Human Rights Situations that Require the Council’s Attention,” featured a series of interventions from representatives of various NGOs, including Khuraijam Athouba, the Working President of the International Peace and Social Advancement (IPSA). Athouba, who is attending the UNHRC session, delivered an second intervention during the General Debate on September 25. He called attention to the over 500 days of unrest in Manipur, criticizing the lack of effective action from the Indian government, despite the deployment of 60,000 troops in the region. “The indigenous population is under severe threat,” Athouba stated, further accusing the Indian government of complicity due to its inaction. Athouba urged the UNHRC to intervene, calling for the assignment of special rapporteurs to assess the situation and to address threats. The session also highlighted the participation of the Manipuri diaspora in an ongoing international campaign for justice, supporting the region’s indigenous people against the aggression of immigrant groups. The campaign, coordinated by IPSA, has been active in Geneva since mid-September and is expected to gather more support in the coming days.",

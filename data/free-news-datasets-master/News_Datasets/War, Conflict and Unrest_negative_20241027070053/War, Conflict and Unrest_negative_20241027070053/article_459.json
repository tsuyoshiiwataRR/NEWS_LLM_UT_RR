    "text": "[GottaLaff],The word that comes to mind is \"violence.\" These people are armed and dangerous. Via NYT: Jack Posobiec, known for helping to spread the “Pizzagate” conspiracy, was invited by the Republican National Committee to speak to volunteers about how to monitor elections in [#Michigan]. [allynkhine], [@GottaLaff]ya mean the guy they call PieceOfShit? [heidilifeldman], [@GottaLaff]Sick. [GottaLaff]OP , [@heidilifeldman]I'm so alarmed today. Too much awful news. [heidilifeldman], [@GottaLaff]Some days are just too much. Give yourself a break. The news and your followers will all be here tomorrow. [GottaLaff]OP , [@heidilifeldman]I know, but that's not what wears me down. I still get news alerts. [heidilifeldman], [@GottaLaff]Can you mute the alerts for a bit? Or take a walk without your phone? I feel like you are similar to healthcare workers during the pandemic -exposed to too much, having to absorb too much. [GottaLaff]OP , [@heidilifeldman]It's fine. I take breaks all the time. We walk Hammy or, like earlier, I went out for an hour and bought pretty things, lol [heidilifeldman], [@GottaLaff]good [heidilifeldman], [@GottaLaff]How’s the townhouse looking? [GottaLaff]OP , [@heidilifeldman]They're painting all of it now, so that takes about 2 weeks. It looks better every day!We finally got to start planning the 4 bathrooms with specific (which I've had for months, lol) because contractor is finally getting freed up from that first job that we knew would take forever. So things will move faster soon. Yay!!! [DWTSquawk7600], [@GottaLaff][@heidilifeldman] ! I love bathrooms and kitchens - two places where $$'s are very well spent, and boy howdy do I have IDEAS!!! [GottaLaff]OP , [@DWTSquawk7600]Our kitchen was already made over, but we added a couple of things, made it even better (It was already gorgeous, and I have high standards). The rest: I'm having a field day. My contractor told me I should have been a designer, so I'm happy.",

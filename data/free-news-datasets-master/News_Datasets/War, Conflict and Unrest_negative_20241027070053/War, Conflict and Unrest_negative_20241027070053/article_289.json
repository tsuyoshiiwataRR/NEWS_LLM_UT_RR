    "text": "Trump now hawking new merch for $100K per item as Truth Social stock continues to plunge\nFormer President Donald Trump is now rolling out a new plan to make a quick buck off of his followers: Branded watches.\nIn a post to his Truth Social account on Thursday, the 45th president of the United States announced that he was selling branded watches bearing his name on the face for $100,000 apiece. According to the New Republic, The \"Trump Victory Tourbillion\" watch only comes in two colors — gold and a pinkish \"rose gold.\" And the ex-president is hoping to bank on exclusivity, telling would-be buyers that there are only 147 available.\n\"[T]hese Watches are truly special — You’re going to love them. Would make a great Christmas Gift,\" he wrote. \"Don’t wait, they will go fast. GET YOUR TRUMP WATCH RIGHT NOW!\"\nREAD MORE: 'Bibles and sneakers': Trump turns up the 'grift' as legal woes intensify\nThose who are unable to pay $100,000 per watch can instead buy a \"Fight Fight Fight\" watch starting at $499 per item, though the \"Onyx Gold Tone\" watch can set a buyer back by $799. The cheaper watches have an engraved image on the back of each piece of the former president holding up a fist at the Pennsylvania rally where he was nearly assassinated.\n\"With its timeless design and flexible style, you’re ready for any situation, just like President Trump,\" the watch website reads.\nThe ex-president announcing a new line of merch comes on the same day as his lawyers in New York appealed his $454 million civil fraud judgment. He's also on the hook for $88.3 million in judgments to writer E. Jean Carroll — $5 million for sexual abuse after a 2023 verdict, and $83.3 million for defamation. As a result of his fraud judgment, the former president is also barred from holding an officer position in any New York-based company for several years. A report by the financial monitor assigned by the court noted that Trump is no longer publishing annual net worth statements.\nTrump is also likely feeling the financial pressure of his flagging stake in Trump Media & Technology Group (trading on the Nasdaq Composite as $DJT), which has lost roughly $6 billion in value since $DJT went public in March. While the stock has recovered slightly from an all-time low this month, it's still largely been on a precipitous slide since Vice President Kamala Harris emerged as the Democratic presidential nominee in July.\nREAD MORE: Trump — who is battered by civil judgments — will now no longer publicize his net worth\nIt's unclear how the New York Court of Appeals will rule. Should it uphold Trump's judgment, he may potentially have to offload some of his stock or real estate assets in order to satisfy the state. But judges on Thursday appeared sympathetic to arguments made by Trump's lawyers, and one judge suggested the nine-figure sum Trump was ordered to pay was abnormally high.\nThe ex-president's judgment has been accumulating daily interest, and while the initial judgment was roughly $350 million, the total amount he'll owe with interest will eventually surpass $500 million if he is to pay it. Whether Trump's judgment will stand or be overturned may not be known until after the November 5 election.\nREAD MORE: Trump begs supporters for cash to keep his assets out of the 'filthy hands' of AG James\nClick here to read the New Republic's full article.",

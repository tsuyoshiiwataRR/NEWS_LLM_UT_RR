Netanyahu was set to say that while Israel continues to battle Hezbollah, it welcomes any ceasefire initiative that would safely enable the return of northern Israeli residents to their homes. There were even draft texts of what Netanyahu would say, according to the report. But then came the wave of political criticism of the nascent ceasefire in Israel, and everything turned upside down, the report said, leading Netanyahu to distance himself from truce proposals, issuing denials from his plane. Channel 12 quoted a source familiar with the details as saying, Obviously the president of the United States would not lead a process like this without the agreement of Prime Minister Netanyahu. This backtracking completely shatters what remains of relations with the Biden administration. https://www.timesofisrael.com/pms-rejection-of-lebanon-ceasefire-plan-shatters-ties-with-biden-tv-report/ Hopefully the shattering of relations would mean the end of arms shipments. We can hope.

I sure hope that TSF never comes to power and attempts to extort and wage war on our allies with his best bud Putin. I sure hope our allies do not turn their backs on us due to the actions of one man that we duly elected. I sure as hell would hope they don't decide to punish every American citizen for the actions of a dictator. I sure as well hope we don't find ourselves alone. But, that's just me. [Think.

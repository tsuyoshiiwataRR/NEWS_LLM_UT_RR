BotTalk Instruction and training flights for Swiss Air Force F/A-18 aircraft were suspended on Thursday as a preventive measure, said the Department of Defense (DDPS). This decision is due to anomalies in the oxygen supply to the device. However, the air police service and operational availability remain assured, adds the DDPS. The problem is currently being investigated with the help of specialists.

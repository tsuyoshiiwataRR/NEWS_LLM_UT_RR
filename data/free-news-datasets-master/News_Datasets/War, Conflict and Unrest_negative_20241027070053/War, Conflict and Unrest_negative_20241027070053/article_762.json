    "text": "The Israeli Air Force (IAF) has claimed to have killed Muhammad Hussein Srour, the commander of Hezbollah’s aerial command. This operation marks a critical blow to Hezbollah's aerial capabilities, which have been employed in numerous attacks against Israeli civilians.The Israeli Defence Force posted on X: \\\"ELIMINATED; Commander of Hezbollah’s Aerial Command, Muhammad Hussein Srour, in a precise IAF strike in Beirut.\\\"— IDF (@IDF) According to IDF, Srour has been linked to various aerial terrorist operations, particularly during the recent \\\"Iron Swords\\\" war, where he orchestrated attacks using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and explosive devices against both Israeli civilians and Israeli soldiers.In recent years, Srour was reportedly at the forefront of a manufacturing initiative for UAVs in southern Lebanon, establishing sites for both UAV production and intelligence gathering. Notably, these sites were strategically located near civilian infrastructure in Beirut and southern Lebanon, raising concerns about the potential risks to non-combatants.Srour's military career included serving as the commander of Hezbollah's surface-to-air missile unit and leading the \\\"Aziz\\\" Unit of the Radwan Force. Furthermore, he was known to be an emissary for Hezbollah to Yemen, working closely with the Houthi terrorist regime’s Aerial Command.",

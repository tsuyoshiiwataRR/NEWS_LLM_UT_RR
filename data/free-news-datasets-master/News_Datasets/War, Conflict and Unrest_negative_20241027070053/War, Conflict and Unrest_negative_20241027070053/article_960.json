    "text": "Embassy of Japan, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary His Excellency\n2024-09-27: Dear Sir,\nThis week I explained the \"outline\" of the \"special zone\". It's \"wonderful\". Both \"il-legal immigrants\" and \"Americans\" can be \"happy\". The \"special zone\" I propose is not a \"policy\" that \"views\" China as an enemy.\n\"Western countries\" and others have a \"weaker\" economy than \"China\", so \"they\" have no choice but to \"go to war\" with China and \"reset their economy\". That's why I'm proposing it.\nI think that in order to avoid a \"war\" between \"Western countries and China\", it is \"urgent\" to build a \"special zone\" in \"those countries\". If \"they\" could become \"equal\" in the \"economic competition\" with China, I think there would be no \"war\".\nJapanese people hate war. In Japan, \"damages\" for \"fires, etc.\" are \"compensated\" for by the \"property insurance system\". However, there is no \"war insurance\" that \"compensates\" for \"damages\" caused by \"war\". Japanese people hate losing prop-erty.\nTrump is a wealthy man in the real estate business. If a nuclear war were to break out in America, Trump's real estate would be destroyed and he would be left penni-less. That's why he has pledged to end the Ukraine war.\nAmericans who don't own real estate seem to support the Ukraine war. This is be-cause they don't have any real estate to lose even if there is a nuclear war with Russia.\nI think human life is more important than real estate. War is murder. If I thought I would die, I would be against the war. Didn't black people also say that black lives matter?\nI think the people who support the Ukraine war are people who don't own property. People who own property are against the war because they will lose their property. People without property should move to the special zone.\n\"Temporary immigrants\" cannot leave the \"Special Zone\" and go to \"regular Ameri-can cities\". However, it is possible for Americans to live in the \"Special Zone\".\nThe \"middle class\" of America does not have the \"funds\" to \"purchase housing\" in big cities such as \"New York City\", but in the \"Special Zone\", even the \"middle class\" can \"purchase\" a \"home\".\nIn \"New York City\", \"low-income\" Americans have \"hard\" conditions to \"obtain\" a \"job\", but in the \"Special Zone\", they can \"easily\" choose a job. And they will be \"satisfied\" with the \"wages\".\n\"Starting a business\" in America requires \"big capital\". In the Special Zone, you can do business with \"small capital\". There are \"bigger dreams\" here than in \"Western development\".\nIn the \"Special Zone\", Americans can \"challenge\" with a \"pioneer spirit\". It's like \"Western development\". Young people are full of dreams. Trump should \"talk\" about the \"American Dream\" to Americans.\nIf Americans dream of the \"American Dream\", they can't \"wage war\". Americans don't have to like Russians, Chinese, or Arabs.\nHowever, if we don't go to war with them, we can achieve the American Dream. Let's build a special zone.\nIn a CNN poll after the debate, 63% of votes went to Harris, while 37% went to Trump. Trump should \"declare\" the construction of a special zone on the Mexican border on immigration and economic policy, and \"win.\" He should talk about the American Dream. !\nPart 1 Citations/References\nThe \"special zone\" will \"accept\" refugees and immigrants as \"temporary immigrant\" workers, with residence limited to the \"special zone.\" Developed countries will use them as low-wage workers to grow their economies, and refugees and immigrants will get jobs and live a life of human hope.\nNo2：\nNo1：\nThe \"special zone\" will \"accept\" refugees and immigrants as \"temporary immigrant\" workers, with residence limited to the \"special zone.\" Developed countries will use them as low-wage workers to grow their economies, and refugees and immigrants will get jobs and live a life of human hope.\nNo2：\nhttps://world-special-zone.seesaa.net/No1：\nhttps://naganoopinion.blog.jp/I'll write again tomorrow.\nPart 2. Japan is a \"state of abnormal human rights violations\". \"Everyone\" of the \"international community\", please help!\nFirst of all, please read \"false accusation\" in the 2010 \"Crime of Supporting Violation of Immigration Law\".\nReason for punishment:\nA Chinese national obtained a \"residence status\" by submitting a \"false employment contract.\" And they committed immigration law violations (activities outside of their qualifications).\nBecause \"we\" provided \"false employment contract documents\" to the Chinese, the Chinese were able to obtain \"residence status.\"\nThe Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan because they obtained a \"status of residence\".\nBecause the Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan, they were able to \"work illegally.\"\nTherefore, ``we'' who ``provided'' the Chinese with ``false employment contract documents'' were punished as ``helping'' the Chinese ``activities outside the scope of their status of residence''.\nThis is an arbitrary \"error of applicable law\". This is out of the \"logic of the law\".\nA Chinese national obtained a \"residence status\" by submitting a \"false employment contract.\" And they committed immigration law violations (activities outside of their qualifications).\nBecause \"we\" provided \"false employment contract documents\" to the Chinese, the Chinese were able to obtain \"residence status.\"\nThe Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan because they obtained a \"status of residence\".\nBecause the Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan, they were able to \"work illegally.\"\nTherefore, ``we'' who ``provided'' the Chinese with ``false employment contract documents'' were punished as ``helping'' the Chinese ``activities outside the scope of their status of residence''.\nThis is an arbitrary \"error of applicable law\". This is out of the \"logic of the law\".\nMy claim:\n\"1\" The Immigration Control Act stipulates that the Minister of Justice will take an \"administrative disposition\" (Immigration Control Act: Cancellation of the status of residence) for the act of submitting false documents and obtaining a status of residence. You are now \"finished\". \"Aiding\" an act of innocence is innocence.\nA Chinese national who has engaged in “2” (activities outside the qualification) is not guilty. The reason is that the \"person who hired them\" has not been punished for \"promoting illegal employment\" under the Immigration Control Act. Therefore, by \"equality under the law\", the Chinese are innocent.\n\"1\" The Immigration Control Act stipulates that the Minister of Justice will take an \"administrative disposition\" (Immigration Control Act: Cancellation of the status of residence) for the act of submitting false documents and obtaining a status of residence.

Therefore, by \"equality under the law\", the Chinese are innocent.\nThe revision of the Immigration Control Law in December 2016 made it possible to punish the act of \"providing\" \"false employment contract documents\".\nImplemented from January 2017. According to Article 39 of the Constitution, it is not possible to \"retroactively\" to the \"past\" and \"punish\".\nImplemented from January 2017. According to Article 39 of the Constitution, it is not possible to \"retroactively\" to the \"past\" and \"punish\".\nhttps://www.moj.go.jp/isa/laws/h28_kaisei.htmlSee \"Indictment.\" The stated facts \"state\" the \"fact\" of \"not guilty.\" (Japanese English)\n\"My Appeal\" (Japanese)\n\"My Appeal\" (English)\nhttp://www.miraico.jp/ICC-crime/2Related%20Documents/%EF%BC%91Indictment.pdf\"My Appeal\" (Japanese)\nhttps://blog.goo.ne.jp/nipponnoasa/e/f47a69183287f42bf0b6464aedb098cc\"My Appeal\" (English)\nhttps://blog.goo.ne.jp/nipponnoasa/e/58d63abf2802f3a9535e5c86fd2387a0\"Chinese, Korean, Filipino, American, etc.\" There are more than tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of victims all over the world. An unusual number of people.\nProsecutors' \"(deprivation) of liberty\" is \"arbitrary.\" They are \"disobeying the law\" and \"selfish\". They have no \"(logical) (necessity)\". The prosecution is \"punishing\" \"as they wish\".\nIn 2010, \"me and the Chinese\" in the immigration violation case, and in 2013, Philippine Embassy staff and diplomats were also punished for the same reason.\n\"I\" argued \"not guilty\", explaining with \"logic of the law\".\nPolice and prosecutors then said, \"(You) should admit (your crime) in general terms.\"\nJapan is the only country that punishes in general terms! .\nThe judge stated \"Causal relationship\" with crazy \"logic\". When I \"see\" (text of the judgment), I \"laugh out loud.\"\nPolice and prosecutors then said, \"(You) should admit (your crime) in general terms.\"\nJapan is the only country that punishes in general terms! .\nThe judge stated \"Causal relationship\" with crazy \"logic\". When I \"see\" (text of the judgment), I \"laugh out loud.\"\nThis case is an error of arbitrary application of law by police officers, prosecutors and judges. The charges are \"abuse of authority of a special public official\" and \"crimes of false complaints.\" The prosecution \"killed\" the \"accusation letter\" and \"accusation letter\" by \"ex officio.\" Therefore, the statute of limitations has been suspended.\nI am \"appealing\" two things.\n1: The foreigner performed \"illegal labor\" other than \"status of residence\". But foreigners are innocent because of \"equality under the law\".\n2: The prosecution “applied” “Articles 60 and 62 of the Penal Code” to Article 70 of the Immigration Control Act on the grounds of “support for Article 22-4-4 of the Immigration Act”. However, it is \"error of applicable law\". (as above).\n1: The foreigner performed \"illegal labor\" other than \"status of residence\".

However, it is \"error of applicable law\". (as above).\nKoreans make demands on Japan over the \"solved\" \"comfort women and forced laborers\" issue, but should support \"tens of thousands of Korean victims\" who have been punished for \"violating immigration laws.\" .\nThe Japanese government is hiding Japan's human rights violations by making up such things as \"human rights violations against Uyghurs in China.\"\n\"I\" am demanding \"restoration of honor\" and \"compensation\" for myself, the Chinese, and the Philippine Embassy officials.\nEveryone in the world! ! Victims should report to their respective governments. The governments of each country have an obligation to demand the Japanese government to restore the honor of their own citizens and compensate them.\nPart 3. Construction of special zones.\nThe \"special zone\" \"accepts\" refugees and immigrants as \"temporary immigrant\" workers, limiting their residence to the \"special zone\". Developed countries can use them as low-wage workers for economic growth, and refugees and immigrants can get jobs and live a hopeful human life.\nNo2:\nhttps://world-special-zone.seesaa.net/\nNo1:\nhttps://naganoopinion.blog.jp/\nPart 4.

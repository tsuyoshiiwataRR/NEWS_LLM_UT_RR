    "text": "Key Points - Following significant escalation in the armed conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon on 23 September, and the subsequent arrival of Palestine Refugees from the south seeking shelter in safer areas, UNRWA started the emergency response in Lebanon - On 24 September, UNRWA opened two emergency shelters in Saida area (Siblin Training Centre) and the north (Toubas School inside Nahr el-Bared Camp). UNRWA opened another emergency shelter in its Nablus School in Saida city, in support of the overwhelmed Saida municipality on 25 September. - UNRWA is providing shelter to people in need, including displaced Lebanese, Syrian refugees and Palestine Refugees. - As of mid-day on 25 September, a total of 490 individuals were registered in the UNRWA emergency shelters, with numbers expected to double by end of the day. Overall Situation - On 23 September, the armed conflict between Israel and Hezbollah entered a new phase. Since then, Israeli Forces’ airstrikes have impacted multiple areas across Lebanon, including Mount Lebanon, Nabatieh, Jezzine, Saida and the Bekaa region (North of the Litani River) in addition to areas on the southern border (South of the Litani River). - As of 25 September, the Ministry of Health of Lebanon reported 558 persons killed (including 50 children), in addition to 1,835 injured. - The intensive airstrikes have displaced tens of thousands of civilians, with many seeking shelter in the north. The city of Saida (in the south) has reportedly experienced a large influx of displaced persons, leading to shortages of basic supplies as bread and drinking water. As of 24September, around 200,000 people were estimated to be displaced in Lebanon. According to IOM, a total of 111, 656 people were reported displaced in the country as of 17 September. An additional 90,530 persons have been displaced from 17 to 24 September. - The Government of Lebanon (GoL) and other institutions are stretched beyond capacity, affecting in particular the overwhelmed health care sector struggling to treat hundreds of wounded. The GoL has declared 240 schools and education facilities as shelters to accommodate the displaced people. It is however unprepared to manage this scale and provide sufficient food assistance. - Most of the displaced are fleeing the southern district and Nabatieh, heading towards Beirut, Mount Lebanon, and from eastern districts including Baalbeck-Hermel and Akkar. - Palestinians from gatherings and localities in Tyre and Saida inlcuding Adloun, Ansariya, Zahriya, Nabatiye have reportedly been displaced towards Saida and the northern areas. Most have sought to stay with family members in Saida, other cities and camps. - In Tyre, some Palestine Refugees have reportedly moved into the city’s Palestine Refugee camps (Burj Shemali, Rashidieh, El-Buss). - In the Beqaa Valley, airstrikes near Baalbeck, including Wavel Camp, have led many families to flee to areas perceived to be safer in central and west Beqaa, with a number of Palestine Refugees from Syria (PRS) reportedly opting to return to Syria. - As of now1, 121 households, representing a total of 490 people, are registered in the three opened UNRWA emergency shelters in the country. Of the registered individuals, 24 per cent are Palestinian, 29 percent are Syrian and 47 per cent are Lebanese. Among the Palestinians: 65 per cent are Palestine Refugees from Lebanon (PRL) and 35 per centare Palestinian refugees from Syria (PRS). - The number of displaced people continued to increase on 25 September. Humanitarian Access, Protection of Civilians - Since the escalation of hostilities on 23 September to date, only one UNRWA personnel in the Tyre area has been slightly injured. This team member received care at an UNRWA clinic and was subsequently released. - Since the onset of the emergency response, two UNRWA facilities have sustained minor damage: Qastal School in Baalbeck (Beqaa) and Mansoura School in Tyre (South) including broken windows from nearby airstrike blasts. Repairs are underway as access permits. - The Agency’s Mansoura School and the nearby Houleh School north of Tyre have been excluded from being used as UNRWA emergency shelters due to the proximity of airstrikes. UNRWA response - UNRWA announced the activation of its emergency response on 24 September and initially opened two of its emergency shelters for displaced persons: Toubas School in the Nahr el-Bared camp in the northand the Siblin Training Centre (STC) in Saida area. On 25 September, in response to the overwhelmed Saida municipality, UNRWA opened another emergency shelter in its Nablus school in Saida, to assist displaced people (mainly Lebanese nationals and Syrian refugees). - UNRWA provided the displaced with mattresses, pillows, ready-to-eat foods and water. All incoming displaced persons are registered byUNRWA and supervised by trained emergency shelter coordinators and managers. - UNRWA fitted the shelters with additional toilet and shower units, lighting and fuel tanks or solar panels. There is a small warehouse, a pharmacy and a medical clinic in the STC. - UNRWA has finalized preparations for a total of 12 emergency shelters to be opened as needed. These shelters are equipped with sanitation and hygiene facilities, and food and drinking water. UNRWA Shelters Siblin Training Center (South): The UNRWA emergency shelter at STC located in Saida area, with the current capacity to host 1,400 persons, opened to IDPs on the morning of24 September. It currently hosts 96 families including 388 people registered at the shelter. Toubas School (North): The UNRWA emergency shelter at Toubas School located in the Nahr el-Bared Palestine refugee camp, with the capacity to host 774 IDPs, opened on the morning of 24 September. It was s opened to accommodate displaced persons from both the south and the neighboring Bekaa area, which is regularly receiving Israeli Forces airstrikes. Currently, 15 families including 68 people are registered at the shelter. Nablus School (South): In response to a request from the overwhelmed Saida municipality, UNRWA opened an emergency shelter in its Nablus School on 25 September. The school is expected to reach full capacity quickly (up to 400 individuals). Currently, nine families including 30 people are registered in the shelter. Programmatic & Operational Response Health - The UNRWA health team is mobilised and operational. All UNRWA health facilities are functioning with no reports of medications shortages. - UNRWA announced the activation of its emergency hospitalization response to cover wounded civilians at contracted hospitals. - Arrangements are being sought for kidney dialysis patients. Prior to the emergency response, these patients were being treated at a hospital in Saida. Many may no longer be able to reach this location. Some kidney dialysis patients from the south have been referred to stay at the emergency shelter in Saida to facilitate the frequent need for treatment. - Within the emergency hospitalization framework, two Palestine Refugees (one PRS and one PRL) have been reported hospitalized for injuries sustained in the Tyre area. Protection - UNRWA protection team is working to support the registration team in the set-up of registration of IDPs in its emergency shelters. Guidelines published and disseminated to the community (including in a voice note) over an official UNRWA WhatsApp channel. - Children remain particularly vulnerable in this crisis. In Tyre, one unaccompanied Palestine Refugee child was identified in the El Buss areaand was referred to protection partners. Sanitation Services/WASH - All water networks in the camps are currently operating, ensuring adequate water supply for residents. - Solid waste management is being implemented in all areas except Tyre, due to the current security situation. For the Tyre Area: - In Rashidieh and El Buss Palestine Refugee camps: solid waste is being collected at designated platforms within the camps. However, transportation of these solid wastes to the dumping site in the Burj Shemali area is currently inaccessible due to ongoing security concerns, preventing any solid waste collection. - In Burj Shemali Camp: solid waste from the Burj Shemali camp is brought to the Burj Shemali area dumping site. However, the current situation has rendered this process not possible. UNRWA is exploring options to rent a plot of land adjacent to the camp to establish a solid waste collection point, which would facilitate improved waste management operations. Logistics - UNRWA has prepositioned supplies across the country in six storage facilities: Lebanon Field Office in Beirut, Houleh School and Mansoura School in Tyre2, the Siblin Training Center in Saida and Saadnayel storage facility in the Beqaa Vally. The supplies are being moved, monitored and replenished according to UNRWA emergency shelter needs and the overall situation. - Prepositioned supplies include 5,000 ready-to-eat food parcels, 3,500 standard dry food parcels, drinking water, mattresses and pillows, cleaning supplies, hygiene kits, first aid kits and approximately 700 tons of flour ready to be distributed across the UNRWA emergency shelters. - Coordination with partners is underway to procure all necessary items based on identified needs. A joint procurement effort is being established with IOM, which will source goods for UNRWA emergency shelters upon request. [1] Data cut-off time: 25/09/2024 at 3 PM [2] Due to the exclusion of Houleh/Mansoura Schools as potential emergency shelters, supplies stored there are being transferred to the emergency shelter at Siblin Training Centre. Quote from Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA Commissioner General: “Our worst fear seems to be unfolding. […] I would like to echo what the UN Secretary-General said to the Member States: don’t make Lebanon a new Gaza.” ENDS- FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT: Global Media Requests WhatsApp: +962-7-9130-0567 European Media Requests English/French/Spanish: WhatsApp +32473822006 Japanese Media Requests WhatsApp: +972 54-240-2727 Email: [media@unrwa.org](https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-1-lebanon-emergency-response)",

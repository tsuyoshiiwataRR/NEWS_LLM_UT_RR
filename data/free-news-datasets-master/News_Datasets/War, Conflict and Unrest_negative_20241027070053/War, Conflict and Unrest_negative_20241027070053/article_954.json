    "text": "Pistorius: Ukraine is just the beginning for Putin, Russia is arming for more than \"just a war with Ukraine\" German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius warned today that Russia is rapidly arming itself for more than the war in Ukraine, writes DPA. \"We see that Russia is rapidly increasing its weapons production and dramatically strengthening its armed forces. All this removes the doubt: for Russia, for Vladimir Putin's Russia, Ukraine is just the beginning,\" Pistorius said in Vilnius. He emphasized that the German Bundeswehr is ready \"to become the central pillar of conventional deterrence and defense in Europe.\" In this context, he emphasized the role of Germany as a center for the rapid transfer of NATO forces from the Atlantic to the eastern flank. Under the agreement with Lithuania, the German government permanently stationed a combat and autonomous brigade of the Bundeswehr in that country. That unit should be operational by 2027. The formation of the brigade is a response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and reflects the changed picture of security in Europe. The German brigade will have up to 5.000 soldiers. Initially, they will be temporarily located at the Lithuanian barracks near Vilnius, and then at their own bases in Rudnikaya and Rukla, about thirty kilometers south and eighty kilometers northwest of Vilnius.",

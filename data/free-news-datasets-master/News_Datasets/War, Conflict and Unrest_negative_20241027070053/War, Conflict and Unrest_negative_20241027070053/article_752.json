    "text": "By Samantha Franco ,\n6 hours ago\nThe USS Forrestal (CV-59) served with the US Navy for nearly forty years, taking part in numerous combat operations. Yet, her most infamous moment came with the devastating flight deck accident in 1967, which resulted in heavy casualties and extensive damage to the vessel.\nIn the wake of this disaster, a positive change occurred: the Navy quickly implemented training reforms to ensure that a tragedy of this nature would never happen again.\nThe USS Forrestal 's early service in the Atlantic and Mediterranean Aerial view of aircraft lined up on the angled flight deck of the Forrestal-class aircraft carrier the USS Forrestal (CV-59) of the United States Navy whilst on deployment in the Mediterrrean Sea with the US Sixth Fleet on 25 October 1957. (Photo Credit: Keystone / Getty Images) The USS Forrestal was the lead ship in her class of aircraft carriers and was commissioned on October 1, 1955.She was the first carrier specifically designed to operate jet aircraft, marking her as the Navy's first \"supercarrier.\"\nForrestal began her service in the Atlantic Ocean during the Suez Crisis and was assigned to the Mediterranean with the US Sixth Fleet. Before being deployed to provide extra airpower during the Vietnam War , she was stationed off the coast of Beirut during the 1958 Lebanon crisis for three days.\nIn November 1963, Forrestal made history when a Lockheed C-130 Hercules executed 21 full-stop landings and takeoffs on her deck, establishing a record for the largest and heaviest aircraft to land on a carrier. The following year, US President Lyndon B. Johnson sent the vessel to Brazil to aid the successful military coup d'état against President João Goulart.\nThe explosion on that fateful day An A-4 Skyhawk burns shortly after its fuel tank was struck by a Zuni missile aboard the USS Forrestal .

In June 1967, the USS Forrestal was positioned in the Gulf of Tonkin, near Vietnam's northern coast in the South China Sea . During this time, aircraft from Attack Carrier Air Wing 17 (CVW-17) carried out numerous successful missions from the carrier, marking it as the Navy's most intense air raid operation up to that point.\nOn July 29, 1967, an electrical malfunction aboard a McDonnell Douglas F-4B Phantom IIs on the Forrestal caused an Mk 32 \"Zuni\" Five-Inch Folding-Fin Aircraft Rocket (FFAR) to accidentally fire. It streaked across the deck and struck a parked, combat-ready Douglas A-4E Skyhawk , dislodging its 400-gallon external fuel tank. Senator John McCain was in the Skyhawk but managed to escape from the cockpit.\nThe collision ignited fuel from the A-4E, starting a fire that quickly spread. The initial explosion killed the first two firefighting teams trying to contain the blaze. Over the next five minutes, nine more explosions occurred following the rocket launch. The growing inferno eventually detonated a 1,000-pound AN-M65 bomb.\nThe losses onboard the USS Forrestal were devastating Crewmen, supporting firehoses on their shoulders, stand amid the smouldering ruins on deck the USS Forrestal. The 76,000-ton aircraft carrier suffered heavy damage as the flames, fanned by 35 mile-an-hour wind, exploded bombs and rockets of burning aircraft. (Photo Credit: Bettmann / Getty Images) The fire blazed uncontrollably, trapping pilots inside their planes. Authorities took a full day to bring the inferno under control, a challenge made worst by the initial bomb blast that damaged the flight deck and allowed fuel to leak into the lower sections of the USS Forrestal . Further explosions worsened the situation, leading to the heartbreaking loss of 50 crew members when one explosion erupted directly above their sleeping quarters.\nThe determined efforts of the destroyers USS Rupertus (DD-851) and George K. MacKenzie (DD-836) were essential in eventually extinguishing the fire, revealing the full scale of the disaster. Many of the injured were evacuated to the hospital ship USS Repose (AH-16).\nThe catastrophe resulted in the deaths of 134 sailors and left hundreds more injured. Additionally, more than 20 aircraft, including F-4Bs, A-4Es, and North American RA-5C Vigilantes, were destroyed, causing damages to the carrier exceeding $70 million .\nFires at sea present a terrible dilemma for sailors: face the flames, be consumed by the blaze, or leap into the perilous waters. There is no safety. While some aboard the Forrestal survived the tragedy, others met a more brutal end. The explosions marked the deadliest event on a US Navy vessel since the Second World War .\nThe US Navy changed its training US Navy recruits practice using a firehose during firefighter training at Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois. (Photo Credit: Ralf-Finn Hestoft / CORBIS / Getty Images) In the wake of the incident, the Navy undertook a thorough examination of its firefighting training protocols, uncovering a lax environment, inadequate firefighting skills among sailors, and slow responses to unforeseen accidents.\nThe Aircraft Carrier Safety Review Panel, chaired by Rear Adm. Forsyth Massey, investigated the tragedy and concluded that, \"Poor and outdated doctrinal and technical documentation of ordnance and aircraft equipment and procedures, evident at all levels of command, was a contributing cause of the accidental rocket firing.\"\nIn response to the events on the USS Forrestal , the Navy launched a complete revamp of its training programs, implementing new guidelines and enhancements. Despite the unfortunate incident, the Navy gained crucial insights and established essential firefighting training for its sailors, which continues to be upheld today. The goal was to ensure that such incidents would never occur again.\nThe USS Forrestal remained in service for several years after USS Forrestal (CV-59), 1992. (Photo Credit: L Smith / Classicstock / Getty Images) Surprisingly, the explosions on July 29, 1967, didn't inflict enough damage to prevent the USS Forrestal from being repaired. Once cleared to return to duty, the aircraft carrier was deployed to the Mediterranean multiple times, participated in the 1981 Gulf of Sidra incident , took part in Operation Earnest Will in the Middle East and was placed on standby during the Gulf War .\nAfter providing air support during Operation Provide Comfort in 1991, Forrestal transitioned into a training carrier and was re-designated AVT-59. In 1993, she was decommissioned. Twenty-three years later, in 2015, she was ultimately scrapped following unsuccessful efforts to convert her into a museum.\nAre you a fan of all things ships and submarines?

    "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that Russia is preparing potential strikes against Ukraine’s three remaining operational nuclear power plants as part of a broader effort to degrade the country’s energy infrastructure before winter 2024–2025. Speaking at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and General Assembly (UNGA) on September 25, Zelensky said Ukrainian intelligence indicates that Russia aims to disrupt Ukraine’s power generation capacity and trigger a “nuclear disaster.” Read: Putin Threatens Nuclear Confrontation, Adjusts Doctrine To Pressure Western Decision-Making Zelensky also noted that Russia is using Chinese satellites to photograph Ukraine’s nuclear power plants in preparation for these potential strikes. He emphasized that previous Russian attacks last winter had already destroyed much of Ukraine’s thermal power generation and severely damaged its hydroelectric capacity. Russian authorities have falsely accused Ukrainian forces of targeting Russian and Russian-occupied nuclear power plants, likely as part of a broader disinformation campaign aimed at portraying Ukraine and its leadership as illegitimate and incapable of engaging in peace negotiations.

He highlighted the illegality of Russia’s war under international law and Russia’s continued efforts to destabilize global security through its war in Ukraine.

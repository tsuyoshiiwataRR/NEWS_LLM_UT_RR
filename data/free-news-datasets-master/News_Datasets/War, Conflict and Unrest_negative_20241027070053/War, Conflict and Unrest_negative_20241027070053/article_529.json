    "text": "The summer of 2024 has been a devastating season for Ukraine, as the war intensified, civilian casualties surged, and vital infrastructure continued to being destroyed. The ongoing conflict has left millions of Ukrainians vulnerable, pushing humanitarian efforts to their limits and highlighting the urgent need for continued global support.\nDuring his first trip to Ukraine, Jeff Kramer, Nova Ukraine’s Chief Development Officer (CDO), experienced this grim reality firsthand. His visit brought him face-to-face with the destruction, the grief, and the unbreakable spirit of those fighting to rebuild their lives in the midst of war. Traveling to Kyiv, Lviv, and Mykolaiv, Kramer met with the people Nova Ukraine is serving, as well as the organization’s local team and partners. This personal journey underscored the immense challenges and the resilient hope that defines life in Ukraine today.\nCivilian Casualties Surge: A Grim Reality In August 2024 alone, 184 civilians were killed and 856 injured , marking the second deadliest month for civilians in Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, following July’s record losses. The devastation was felt across the country, particularly in Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk region and Kharkiv, where mass casualty events left entire communities shattered.\nJeff Kramer described his own sobering experience.\n“The trip was important because it made the war, the destruction, and the inhumanity real and personal. Being in Ukraine, talking with those we are serving, those we are serving with, and visiting and experiencing the devastation touched my heart and made it tangible.”\nInfrastructure in Ruins: The Fight for Essential Services On August 26, Russian forces launched their ninth coordinated attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure since March, causing catastrophic damage across 15 regions. Energy infrastructure, crucial for the country’s survival, was targeted in 37 separate attacks in Government-controlled areas throughout August alone. With each attack, electricity, water, and essential services were disrupted, pushing already struggling communities to the brink. The destruction, Kramer noted, is not just physical—it’s emotional and psychological as well.\n“The story we see in media reports can’t help but be somewhat sterile. Being in Ukraine and being able to touch, taste, smell, see, and be part of what has happened and continues to happen, takes the sterility away and makes it real, personal, and very, very painful.”\nDisplacement and Evacuation: The Human Toll In August alone, 3,400 civilians were evacuated from Donetsk oblast, while another 600 fled from Sumy oblast. As fighting escalated in these regions, mandatory evacuations became necessary to save lives. Humanitarian organizations, including Nova Ukraine, mobilized quickly, providing hot meals, clean water, warm clothes, shelter, and medicine to displaced families. Yet, for many, leaving their homes behind meant facing an uncertain future.\nKramer was deeply moved by the resilience of those he encountered.\n“The most memorable moment was driving by a newly developed military cemetery in Lviv and looking at a sea of flags that stood in honor of the fallen soldiers… what moved me was learning that, for as far as the eye could see, each individual flag represented a single fallen soldier.”\nThese stark reminders of the human cost of war drive home the need for continued support for those displaced and the communities that are hosting them.\nThe Strength of Ukraine: Resolve and Resilience Through all the devastation, Kramer found inspiration in the Ukrainian spirit. In Kyiv, he witnessed the extraordinary strength of a people who refuse to let war define their lives.\n“What I learned that day, in a way that I had never seen or heard of before, was the true meaning of resolve, resilience, unity, and a belief that fighting the current fight is everyone’s responsibility and privilege to be part of.”\nAirstrikes and missile sirens threaten Ukrainian’s daily lives, and they continue to press forward, refusing to live in fear. Kramer’s experience in a bomb shelter, where he was alone despite the threat, illustrated the sheer will of the people:\n“I was the only one in the shelter… Ukrainians were not running to the shelters anymore. They were determined to not let the Russians scare them into underground shelters, they were not going to cower in corners, and they were not going to let the missile sirens stop them from living their lives.”\nWhy the World Must Continue to Stand with Ukraine As the world watches Ukraine endure one of its darkest chapters, it is clear that the fight is far from over. Nova Ukraine, with Jeff Kramer now at the helm of its fundraising efforts, remains committed to providing the humanitarian aid that is so desperately needed. Kramer urges the world to continue supporting Ukraine’s fight for survival and independence.\n“Simply put, the lives of millions of men, women, children, towns and villages, and communities hang in the balance! Not to mention global stability!”\nHis words echo the sentiments of the Ukrainian people: resilience, determination, and hope in the face of unimaginable challenges. Nova Ukraine will continue to stand alongside them, providing aid and support, but the need for global solidarity has never been greater.\nAs the war continues to rage on and winter approaches, humanitarian aid will become even more crucial. The US and the international community must not turn away, for the lives of millions depend on our continued commitment to peace and stability in Ukraine.\nDonate. Impact. Change.

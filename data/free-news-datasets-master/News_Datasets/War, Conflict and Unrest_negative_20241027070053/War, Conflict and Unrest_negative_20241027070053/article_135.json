    "text": "Subscribe now for access at a special price of only $99/year.\nZelensky’s ‘victory plan’ is to drag NATO into the fight\nJames Davis reports that recent trends in the Russia-Ukraine conflict continue. Ukrainian President Zelensky has traveled to the US to present a “victory plan” involving long-range strikes on Russia, but this proposal has raised concerns in the West about potential escalation.\nGold’s rise reflects central bank diversification more than geopolitics\nDavid P. Goldman writes that gold serves as a risk hedge and a confiscation-proof reserve asset, with US interest rates trending lower and reserve holdings rising. Despite escalating global conflicts, gold’s volatility remains low, and its steady rise is expected to continue.\nCommerce Dept. worried about Chinese, Russian car tech\nScott Foster reports that the Biden administration plans to ban Chinese and Russian software in internet-connected vehicles by 2026, and hardware by 2029, to protect American privacy and security. The ban is raising concerns about retaliation from China.",

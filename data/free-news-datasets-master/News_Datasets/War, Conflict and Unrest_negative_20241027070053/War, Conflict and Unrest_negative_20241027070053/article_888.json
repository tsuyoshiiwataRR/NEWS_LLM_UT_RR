    "text": "Russian Shelling Strikes Ukrainian Settlements: Casualties and Destruction Ensue Russian forces shelled settlements west of Kherson in Ukraine, resulting in one death and one injury. Multiple rocket launcher strikes near Kharkiv caused extensive fire damage and raised concerns of trapped residents. The claims remain unverified, though Russia denies targeting civilians despite significant casualties since the invasion's onset. In a stark reminder of the ongoing conflict, Russian forces repeatedly shelled a settlement west of the Ukrainian-held city of Kherson, leading to one fatality and another person wounded, according to regional governor Vyacheslav Prokudin. Prokudin reported on Telegram that a woman lost her life after Russian forces targeted the village of Tomyna Balka on six separate occasions. The conflict spread beyond Kherson as a Russian multiple rocket launcher strike hit the town of Slatyne, near Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv. The attack initiated a fire that engulfed at least six homes, heightening fears of residents trapped under the debris. Vyacheslav Zadorenko, a local official, stated emergency services were tackling the blaze and undertaking rescue efforts. While these reports have not been independently confirmed by Reuters, the violence underscores the perilous conditions in Ukraine. Russia maintains it does not aim at civilians, yet over two and a half years since the invasion began, thousands of lives have been claimed. (With inputs from agencies.)

    "text": "Missiles from Yemen Spark New Tensions in Israel and Lebanon Israel intercepted a missile from Yemen, intensifying ongoing conflicts. Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed strong military action against Hezbollah amidst airstrikes in Beirut and cross-border attacks. The violence has displaced thousands and killed hundreds, raising fears of another prolonged conflict similar to the 2006 war. Israel's military intercepted a missile from Yemen, triggering air raid sirens across central Israel, including Tel Aviv. Previously, on October 7, another missile from Yemen had struck central Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed robust military action against Hezbollah, further denting ceasefire hopes proposed by US and European officials. Israeli strikes in Beirut killed a senior Hezbollah commander as the militant group launched rockets into Israel. The conflict has displaced thousands near the Israel-Lebanon border. Netanyahu, attending the U.N. General Assembly in New York, faced international pressure to halt the violence temporarily. Amid intensified strikes targeting Hezbollah, hundreds have died in Lebanon. Despite diplomatic efforts, Israel continues its military operations, displacing 100,000 Lebanese and preparing for a possible ground invasion. The escalation revives fears of a repeat of the 2006 war. (With inputs from agencies.)",

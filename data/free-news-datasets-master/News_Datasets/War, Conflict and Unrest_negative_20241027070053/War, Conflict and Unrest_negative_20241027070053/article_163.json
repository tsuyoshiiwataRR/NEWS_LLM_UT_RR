    "text": "Israel Has Displaced Over 90,000 People In Lebanon In Just 3 Days: UN Fahad Shabbir (@FahadShabbir) Published September 27, 2024 | 01:00 AM\nUNITED NATIONS, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 27th Sep, 2024) A new humanitarian crisis is unfolding at Lebanon ’s border with Syria as thousands of people flee Israeli shelling linked to the war in Gaza , United Nations officials saids Thursday, just as Israel Premier Benyamin Netanyahu arrived in New York for the 79th session of the UN General Assembly .\nOnly hours earlier, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the Security Council that “hell is breaking loose in Lebanon” along the UN-patrolled line of separation, with exchanges of fire greater in “scope, depth and intensity” than previously.\nThat warning came as US President Joe Biden told the world ’s leaders gathered at UN headquarters on Wednesday that an “all-out” war was possible between Hezbollah and Israel , while the UN refugee agency, UNHCR , reported people fleeing from Israeli strikes on Hezbollah targets in the early hours of Thursday morning, in response to attacks on Israel which included a first attempted missile strike on Tel Aviv.\nIn a video message issued on Thursday in New York , the head of UN Peacekeeping Jean-Pierre Lacroix said: “I am deeply concerned by the sharp escalation along the blue line. As the Secretary General said last night in the Security Council, 'Hell is breaking loose in Lebanon ' and we should all be alarmed by the escalation.”\nHe stressed that both the Lebanese and Israeli populations \"are in extreme danger, with hundreds dead and thousands injured in recent days alone. Regional security and stability is at risk.”\n“Literally thousands of families of Syrian and also Lebanese are crossing into Syria…they are women , children, men,” said UNHCR Representative in Syria , Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, as the Israeli military announced strikes on more than 70 targets overnight in eastern Lebanon ’s Bekaa Valley and in southern Lebanon .\nBoth areas are believed to be Hezbollah strongholds.\nStanding amid vehicles laden with belongings strapped to the roof and countless people queuing in long lines on the Syrian side of the border , Vargas Lllosa said that UNHCR was working with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent to provide water , food , blankets and mattresses - “because many of them will be spending the night here at the border while they are processed”.\nAccording to media reports, a 21-day ceasefire proposal by the US, European allies including France and several Arab nations has been rejected by members of Netanyahu’s government .\nLatest data from Lebanon ’s interior ministry indicates that 70,100 internally displaced people are now registered inside 533 government-run centres. Some 500,000 people have been displaced following months of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel , the Lebanese authorities said.\nUNHCR said that it was continuing to coordinate closely with the authorities and other humanitarian organizations to provide relief to people uprooted from their homes inside Lebanon . “Our teams are on standby to help more civilians who have fled the air-strikes, providing shelter, health care and psychosocial support,” the UN agency said Thursday.\nEchoing solidarity with those impacted by the strikes, the UN Children’s Fund, UNICEF, appealed for “more shelters and more funds” to provide critical support to those in need. “We are on the ground distributing emergency hygiene kits, blankets, sleeping bags, and dignity kits in displacement shelters. Our team is working tirelessly to support displaced families.”\nCiting the Lebanese authorities, UNHCR said that more than 90,000 people have been displaced since 23 September and “more are abandoning their homes by the minute”. The latest hostilities have killed more than 600 people and injured 1,835.\nFacebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Whatsapp Related Topics Assembly Injured Dead Fire World Interior Ministry United Nations Syria Israel Osama Bin Laden Water Gaza France Vehicles New York Lebanon September Border Women Media All From Government Refugee UNHCR Arab Recent Stories Gold price increases by Rs1500 per tola in Pakistan\n5 hours ago Pakistan finally gets i-TOPCon Vertex N 700W plus modules\n6 hours ago A Cinematic Revolution in Your Pocket: vivo V40 5G Teases ZEISS-Powered Camera, ..\n11 hours ago Laiba Khan plans to leave showbiz after marriage\n12 hours ago Differences between Punjab CM, governor escalate over VCs’ appointments\n12 hours ago CJP Isa responds to SC senior Judge Mansoor Ali Shah's letter\n13 hours ago Pakistan’s Red-ball coach hints at changes in squad\n13 hours ago Nawaz Sharif likely to travel to London in first week of October\n14 hours ago IMF bailout boosts PSX: 100 index hits new high\n14 hours ago President reaffirms commitment to preserve marine ecosystems\n14 hours ago Eight Khwarij killed in North Waziristan\n14 hours ago Currency Rate In Pakistan - Dollar, Euro, Pound, Riyal Rates On 26 September 202 ..\n18 hours ago More Stories From World England's Hull out of Pakistan tour\n14 minutes ago At UN rights council, Pakistan calls local polls in Indian Occupied Kashmir 'farcical'\n14 minutes ago Football: Italian Cup results - collated\n34 minutes ago Football: Women's Champions League results\n54 minutes ago Macron, Trudeau pledge to work for 'decarbonized' economies\n54 minutes ago Fritz loses on day of shocks at Japan Open\n54 minutes ago Packers clash awaits for 'late developer' Darnold\n1 hour ago Poverty rises to over 52 percent in Milei's Argentina\n2 hours ago Pakistan, Iran underscore need to build mutually beneficial cooperation\n3 hours ago Football: Italian Cup results\n3 hours ago Gaza rescuers say 15 killed in Israeli strike on school\n3 hours ago US defense Secretary warns against 'all-out' Israel-Hezbollah war\n4 hours ago",

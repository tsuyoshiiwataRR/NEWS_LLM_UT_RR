    "text": "Norway police have issued an international search request for a missing man linked to the booby-trapped pagers in Lebanon. Rinson Jose, 39, a Norwegian-Indian salesman owning a tech consultant company in Bulgaria with links to the Israeli regime and involved in the sales of the Taiwanese communication devices to Hezbollah, has gone missing after being connected to the deal for the exploding devices. Jose, who lives in Norway, worked for the DN Media Group's sales department. Local media contacted his family and friends in India and reported that Jose had registered a company in Bulgaria. The Pondicherry University MBA graduate, born and raised in Kerala, arrived in Norway ten years ago to study for a Masters degree at Oslo Metropolitan University. Jose's Norwegian employer said he had left for a business conference in Boston, USA on September 17, and the company has not been able to contact Jose since September 18. Jose's wife has also been unreachable since then. “Yesterday, Sept. 25, the Oslo police district received a missing person report in connection with the pager case,” Oslo police said in a Thursday email to Reuters. “A missing person’s case has been opened, and we have sent out an international warrant for the person,” it added. Last week, thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by members of the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah and people affiliated with them exploded, killing dozens and wounding thousands more in Lebanon and Syria. The internationally condemned terrorist attack was instantly attributed to the arch-enemy of Hezbollah, the Israeli regime and its espionage agency, Mossad.",

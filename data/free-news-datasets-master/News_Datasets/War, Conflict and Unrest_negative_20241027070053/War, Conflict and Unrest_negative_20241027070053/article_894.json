    "text": "In September 2005, retired Israeli General Doron Almog narrowly escaped arrest at Heathrow Airport. Accused of war crimes in Gaza, Almog stayed onboard his plane after an Israeli embassy official warned him that British police were waiting to arrest him. The arrest warrant, issued under the UK’s universal jurisdiction laws, marked the first time an Israeli national faced such legal action in Britain. As Declassified UK reports, this incident sparked a decade-long lobbying campaign by Israel to amend UK laws to protect its officials from similar legal risks.\nLobbying Efforts and Legal Reforms\nLeaked Israeli government files, obtained by the hack-tivist group “Anonymous for Justice” and reviewed by Declassified UK , reveal that Israel began lobbying the UK almost immediately after Almog’s near-arrest. The focus of the campaign was to ensure Israeli officials, both current and former, could visit the UK without fear of arrest under universal jurisdiction, a legal principle allowing foreign nationals to be prosecuted for serious crimes like genocide and war crimes.\nIsrael’s proposals urged Britain to amend its legislation so that an arrest warrant could only be issued with the consent of the Attorney-General or the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). According to the leaked files cited by Declassified , Israeli officials expressed concerns that the existing legal framework could be “misused” against Israeli nationals .\nIn 2011, the UK government, led by David Cameron, responded to these pressures by passing new legislation. The reforms required DPP approval for any future universal jurisdiction arrest warrants. Foreign Secretary William Hague justified the changes, stating that they were necessary to prevent Israeli officials from feeling unsafe while visiting the UK .\nOngoing Israeli Concerns\nDespite the legal reforms, Israel remained unconvinced that its officials were entirely shielded from potential legal action in the UK. In October 2011, former Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni faced an arrest application during a visit to London. As Declassified reports, the application, based on allegations related to Israel’s 2008–2009 military offensive in Gaza, was submitted to the DPP for consideration.\nSir Keir Starmer, the DPP at the time and now Prime Minister, reportedly delayed making a decision long enough for the British government to grant Livni “special mission” status, which provided her with temporary diplomatic immunity.\nThe Livni case led Israeli authorities to continue their lobbying efforts. As the files show, in 2013, Israel’s attorney general held detailed discussions with the DPP, pushing for further legal amendments to better protect Israeli officials from arrest in the UK. High-level discussions continued into 2016, as both nations explored additional safeguards, including a potential UK-Israel agreement on concurrent jurisdiction.\nA Persistent Issue\nWhile Israel successfully lobbied for changes to UK law, concerns about the safety of Israeli officials during visits to Britain persist. According to Declassified , Israeli officials, including Livni and former Defence Minister Shaul Mofaz, have continued to apply for “special mission” certificates to ensure diplomatic immunity during visits to the UK.\nThis issue remains unresolved, and Israeli officials are reportedly still seeking further legal guarantees to avoid arrest under universal jurisdiction during their trips to Britain.\nAt present, only four Israelis are currently listed under Sanctions in the UK. These sanctions, introduced in February 2024 by then Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron, are part of a broader effort to impose financial and travel restrictions on those responsible for escalating violence in the region. The move aimed to address the growing instability in the West Bank, driven by settler aggression, which has seen an unprecedented rise in violent incidents over the past year.\nThe sanctions focus on four extremist settlers who have been implicated in serious human rights abuses against Palestinian communities. Among them is Moshe Sharvit, who has been involved in threatening and assaulting Palestinian shepherds and their families in the Jordan Valley. In a particularly alarming incident in October 2023, a community of 20 Palestinian families was forced to flee after Sharvit attacked the residents and demanded they vacate their land within hours. This act of intimidation is part of a larger pattern of violence used by settlers to pressure Palestinians into leaving their homes.\nAnother key figure, Yinon Levy, leads the ‘Meitarim Farm’ outpost, which was established in 2021. Levy and settlers under his command have used physical violence and destruction of property to displace Palestinian communities. In October 2023, his actions in the village of Zanuta resulted in extensive property damage and forced residents to flee. Zvi Bar Yosef, another settler sanctioned by the UK, has similarly used intimidation and violence to drive Palestinians off their land. Since establishing an illegal outpost in 2018, Bar Yosef has been accused of threatening young Palestinian families at gunpoint, creating a climate of fear and hostility in the region. Ely Federman, also sanctioned, has been involved in multiple violent incidents against Palestinian shepherds in the South Hebron Hills. The UK’s sanctions come in response to the alarming rise in violence in the West Bank, with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reporting record levels of attacks by extremist settlers in 2023.\nNo member of the IDF has been officially sanctioned for the ongoing armed actions against Gaza or Lebanon, despite the very high civilian death toll.",

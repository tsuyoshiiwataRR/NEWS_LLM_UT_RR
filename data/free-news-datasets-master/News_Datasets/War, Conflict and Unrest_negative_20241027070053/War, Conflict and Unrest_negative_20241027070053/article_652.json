    "text": "Congressional lawmakers are “terrified” after Donald Trump revealed details about how Iran has been plotting to kill him.\nThe former president’s campaign said the hostile nation has made “real and specific threats” to assassinate Trump very recently.\nThe shocking revelations come after the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) gave Trump a classified briefing. The 45th president later confirmed on social media that there are “major threats to my life from Iran.”\nMore worrying was another part of his statement: “Iran has already taken steps that didn’t work, but they will try again.”\nAnd lawmakers, already fighting over two assassination attempts on Trump in Pennsylvania and Florida, are now demanding to know what the classified report contained and whether Iran was behind the previous attempts.\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamanei attends the commemoration ceremony on September 25, 2024. On Tuesday, intelligence officials informed former President Donald Trump that Iran has made credible attempts on his life and will likely continue to do so.\n“I read it and I talk to him, but I think people really find it terrifying that a foreign government would actually develop a plan,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a close ally of the former president, exclusively told DailyMail. com.\n‘I think that’s extremely worrying. “It definitely takes things to another level.”\nGreene also mentioned confusion around the classified briefings, noting that it is unclear whether Iran had any connection to the July 13 shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, or the September 15 attempt in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n“I don’t know if it was the two assassination attempts,” the Georgia Republican said. “Maybe there were other things that we don’t know that were stopped.”\n‘And I will speak for the majority of people I know at home, who are not interested in the war right now. Most people I know at home want to solve our country’s problems.’\nThen she gave a warning.\n“We will not tolerate Iran threatening the life of former President Trump or anyone else.”\nA bloodied Donald Trump stands up after being shot and raises his fist on July 13.\nShooter Thomas Matthew Crooks’ bullet grazed Trump’s ear. There were reports that Iran might have had some connection to the attempt, although these have not been verified.\nRep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., who is part of the House task force investigating Trump’s assassination attempts, told DailyMail.com that the committee requested that ODNI also provide them with a briefing.\n“I saw former President Trump’s statement that he posted on Twitter, and as a result of that statement, I believe the task force requested a classified briefing to receive the same information that former President Trump received.”\n“We have not received that same report from ODNI,” Moskowitz confirmed.\nWashington Democratic Representative Rick Larsen told DailyMail.com: “It’s horrible that the Iranians would do this, if it could be true.”\nHe said the country should “be prepared for the United States to increase pressure” on Iran, given its brazen threats.\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner, R-Ohio, told DailyMail.com he could not discuss the details of the briefing when pressed about it on Wednesday.\nBut on Thursday morning he made a strong statement that appeared to take direct aim at the American and Iranian leadership.\nHeavy weapons including ballistic missiles, air defense systems and unmanned aerial vehicles are on display in Tehran this week.\nThe aftermath of Butler’s campaign rally after everyone left the venue\nPolice snipers return fire after shots were fired while Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump spoke at a campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, 2024.\n“President Biden and Vice President Harris must make it clear to Iran that any attempt on President Trump’s life would be an act of war,” Turner wrote on social media.\nThe briefing and subsequent questions arising from it come days after investigators discovered that Iranian ‘malicious cyber actors’ sent emails to associates of President Biden’s campaign with information ‘taken from stolen, non-public campaign material’. of Trump’ during the summer.\nSeveral federal agencies discovered that hackers from Iran had sent emails containing material stolen from the Trump campaign to people involved in Biden’s then-reelection campaign last week.\nOfficials described the breach as part of a broader effort by Tehran to influence upcoming elections.\n“We have emboldened several countries, Iran, China and Russia, to interfere in our elections,” Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., told DailyMail.com. “This is not the first, nor the second, nor the third (attempt).”\nHe warned that the country has seen his meddling in American elections work before, and going after candidates is just the most recent implementation of his meddling in American affairs.",

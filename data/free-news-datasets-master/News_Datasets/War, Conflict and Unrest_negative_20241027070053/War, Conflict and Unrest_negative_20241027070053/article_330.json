    "text": "/Pogled.info/ The ruins of the concentration camp in Volchansk have become a mass grave for elite GUR fighters. Literally the next day, after the Ukrainian fighters boasted that they had “taken over the ruins”, the Russians unleashed a deadly storm against them, and the immediate victory turned into a disaster with only one hit from Solntsepok. The elite Budanov* was completely burned.\nFor a long time, our fighters guarded the plant for gatherings in Volchansk. Today, all that remains are the ruins of the once thriving factory. Military correspondent Yuriy Kotenok noted that our units were indeed surrounded here – surrounded by fire.\nThe enemy, who outnumbered us many times with UAVs, including FPV drones, had the advantage of cutting off the forward positions, a “nightmare” for them, the military correspondent wrote on the his Telegram channel. – The right decision was made to leave these unfavorable positions. I think it is the right decision.\nAs soon as our boys left the ruins, soldiers from the Main Intelligence Agency of Ukraine (GUR) arrived there. Photos and videos from the allegedly captured plant immediately spread across public pages and Ukrainian media. It was noted that the “special operation” was almost authorized by the head of the GUR Kiril Budanov * himself, in order to restore himself after a series of defeats by the Russian troops.\nPhoto: collage from Tsargrad\nIn general, peremoga is served peremog (victory victory – Ukrainian). Military expert Alexander Ivanovov noted that “clouds are clearly gathering over Budanov* recently, and Zelensky even suspected that he was “fighting undercover and working for various masters at the same time “.\nThis “operation” coincided well with Zelensky’s stay in the USA, which he himself spoke of as the main “win” of this autumn, – values the expert from aif.ru.\nBut in the end, the victory turned to zrada (betrayal – Ukrainian) literally with one blow from Solntsepok. At night, our boys completely burned the elite Budanov * in the ruins of a factory in Volchansk.\nYesterday they expelled us from this plant, well, we took them there and … (punishment – obscenity), – they noted the Russian fighters.\nScreenshot t.me/SolovievLive\nMilitary Chronicle analysts write:\n“As soon as the GUR units entered the territory of the plant for gatherings in Volchansk, “Solntsepiok” began to attack the complex of buildings.\nBlogger Kiril Fedorov pointed out that Budanov* elite was freed by “Solntsepek” not only in the factory, but also in the residential areas. He had no chance to escape alive after being hit by a 220 mm rocket.\nAnd then at the location of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Volchansk, our guys shot down three FAB-1500 with UMPC.\nThey are burying GUR under the ruins of the houses, – wrote VGTRK reporter Andrey Rudenko.\nAnd the Telegram channel “Military Informant” specifies that our soldiers hit the ruins of the factory in Volchansk with thermobaric weapons at night.\n* Kirill Budanov is included in the list of terrorists and terrorists of Russia.\nTranslation: PI\n2024-09-26 18:57:23\n#elite #Russians #completely #burned #Budanov #Volchansk #victory #turned #disaster #blow #Solntsepok",

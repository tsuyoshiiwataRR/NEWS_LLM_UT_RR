    "text": "/Pogled.info/ The ruins of the aggregate factory in Volchansk have become a mass grave for elite GUR fighters. Literally the next day, after the Ukrainian fighters boasted that they had “taken over” the ruins, the Russians unleashed a deadly storm against them, and the victory immediately turned into a disaster with only one shot from Solntsepok. Budanov’s* elite burned completely.\nFor a long time, our fighters defended the plant for aggregates in Volchansk. Today, only ruins remain of the once thriving factory. Military correspondent Yuriy Kotenok noted that our units are actually semi-surrounded here – surrounded by fire.\nThe enemy, who are many times more numerous than us with UAVs, including FPV drones, had the advantage, the positions broke forward, “nightmares” them, the military correspondent wrote on his Telegram channel. – The right decision was made to leave these unfavorable positions. I think it’s the right decision.\nAs soon as our men left the ruins, soldiers from the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine (GUR) arrived there. Photos and videos of the alleged captured plant immediately spread across Ukrainian public pages and media. It was noted that the “special operation” was almost approved by the head of the GUR Kiril Budanov * himself, in order to reestablish himself after a series of defeats by the Russian troops.\nPhoto: collage from Tsargrad\nGenerally, peremoga peremog (victory of victories – Ukrainian) is served. Military expert Alexander Ivanovov noted that “clouds are clearly gathering over Budanov *” recently, and Zelensky even suspected him of “covert fighting and working for several masters at the same time”.\nThis “operation” coincided perfectly with Zelensky’s stay in the USA, which he himself mentioned as the main “victory” of this autumn,- quotations the expert from aif.ru.\nBut in the end, victory turned into zrada (betrayal – Ukrainian) literally with one shot from Solntsepok. At night, our elite boys burned Budanov * in the ruins of a factory in Volchansk.\nYesterday they expelled us from this plant, well, we bring them there and … (punishment – obscenity), – pointed out the Russian fighters.\nScreenshot t.me/SolovievLive\nMilitary Chronicle analysts write:\n“As soon as the units of the GUR entered the territory of the plant for aggregates in Volchansk, “Solntsepiok” began to attack the building complex.\nThe blogger Kiril Fedorov noted that Budanov’s elite * was dissolved by “Solntsepek” not only in the factory, but also in the residential areas. He had no chance of escaping alive after being hit by a 220 mm incendiary rocket.\nAnd then at the Ukrainian Armed Forces base in Volchansk, our men shot down three FAB-1500s with UMPC.\nThey are buried GUR under the ruins of the houses, – wrote VGTRK reporter Andrey Rudenko.\nAnd the Telegram channel “Military Informator” notes that our troops hit the ruins of the factory in Volchansk with thermobaric weapons at night.\n* Kirill Budanov is included in Russia’s list of terrorists and extremists.\nTranslation: PI",

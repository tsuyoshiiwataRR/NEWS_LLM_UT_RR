    "text": "Kamala Harris insinuated that Donald Trump would support Vladimir Putin in Ukraine when she met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the White House on Thursday.\n“There are those in my country who would force Ukraine to give up large parts of its sovereign territory. These proposals are the same as Putin’s. And let’s be clear: these are not peace proposals. Instead, they are proposals for surrender,” the Democratic candidate for president said.\nShe did not mention Donald Trump by name, her intention was clear.\nThere were reports that Zelensky wanted to have a conversation with Trump while he was in the United States for the UN General Assembly meeting.\nHis visit came in the shadow of election year politics and many want to spend time with the two contenders vying to become the next occupant of the Oval Office.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Vice President Kamala Harris shake hands during a meeting at the White House\nInstead of a friendly meeting, Zelensky became the target of the former president’s ire.\nTrump called Zelensky “probably the greatest salesman on the planet” during a campaign rally earlier this week in North Carolina.\n“The president of Ukraine is in our country and he is making nasty little insults towards your favorite president, me,” he told his adoring crowd of MAGA supporters.\n“Any deal — the worst deal — would have been better than what we have now,” Trump said, portraying Ukraine as a lost cause.\n“If they had made a bad deal, it would have been much better. They would have given up a little and everyone would still be alive and every building would be built and every tower would age another 2000 years.\n‘What deal can we make? It has been demolished,” he added. ‘The people are dead. The country is in ruins.’\nUkraine has lost a fifth of its territory and tens of thousands of lives to the conflict.\nZelensky is in the United States to convince officials of his “victory plan,” which includes strengthening Western security guarantees for Ukraine, increasing military aid and securing further financial support.\nHe has not released the full details and was not expected to do so during his meetings with President Joe Biden and with Harris.\nHarris has pledged to continue sending military aid to Ukraine if she is elected president. However, Trump is more critical of Zelensky and raises questions about what he will do when he returns to the White House.\nThe vice president, who has met Zelensky seven times, was clear in her support.\n“My support for the Ukrainian people is unwavering. I am proud to stand with Ukraine. “I will continue to support Ukraine and ensure that Ukraine gains the upper hand in this war so that it remains safe and prosperous,” she said.\n“By standing by our friends and defending our ideals against tyranny, America has become the most powerful and prosperous nation in the world. “Putin’s aggression is not only an attack on the Ukrainian people, it is also an attack on fundamental principles such as sovereignty and territorial integrity,” she added.\nVice President Kamala Harris and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wave from the balcony of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and President Joe Biden meet in the Oval Office\nZelensky echoed her, saying he was looking forward to the conversation and thanking the US for its support.\n“We believe that this war can be won and that only then can a just peace be achieved,” he said.\nBefore his meeting with Harris, Zelensky met with Biden in the Oval Office.\n“Russia will not prevail. Ukraine will prevail, and we will continue to support you every step of the way,” Biden said, after thanking him for presenting the so-called victory plan.\nZelensky also visited lawmakers on Capitol Hill – where his government said he also presented his victory plan – and delivered a defiant speech at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday.\nThe Ukrainian president’s visit to the United States came as Putin raised the stakes, saying his country should be able to use nuclear weapons if it were attacked by a state backed by a nuclear power.\n“It is proposed to consider aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear state, as their joint attack on the Russian Federation,” Putin said at a meeting at the Kremlin on Wednesday.\nZelensky has pushed for permission to fire more Western weapons into Russia’s heartland. Western leaders fear that Putin will see this as an attack from the West and expand his war.\nHe is also struggling to keep the world’s attention as the war in the Middle East expands. Israel has stepped up its attacks on Lebanon as it targets Hezbollah members.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (center) walks with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., left, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\nRepublicans were also furious. Zelensky toured a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, calling it an election stunt.\nBut the White House defended the visit and told Republicans to drop the outrage.\n“This came from Ukrainian. Not us,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said of the visit.\nZelensky toured the factory with Gov. Josh Shapiro, a top Harris surrogate. Republican Chairman Mike Johnson has called on Zelensky to fire his ambassador to the US for arranging the trip.\n“The Ukrainians have asked to visit the factory where, as you know, American workers are employed to produce crucial supplies that the Ukrainian army uses every day on the front lines of freedom, as it plays a central role in survival of their country,” Jean said. – said Pierre.\nShe pointed out that Zelensky visited Utah in July and Republicans expressed no outrage.\n“President Zelensky traveled to Utah and held an event with the Republican governor, a very similar event, and Republican officials were there at that event in Utah, and there was not a single demand, not one, not a single demand for an investigation.\n“This was the normal course of action for a Ukrainian request in wartime, in wartime. And so I would encourage House Republicans to drop this. They should drop this kind of political stuff,” she noted.\nIn total, the United States has provided approximately $175 billion in both military and economic aid to Ukraine.",

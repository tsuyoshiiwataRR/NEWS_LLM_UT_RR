    "text": "'Russian NATO' loses ground in Moscow's former backyard\nCity talk| 27 Sep 2024\nEven as Russia stages a series of military drills with allies in central Asia, Moscow's hold over a region it considers its own backyard appears increasingly tenuous.\nBogged down by its war on Ukraine, now in a third year, it is visibly losing its historic role as the key power broker in both central Asia and the Caucasus.\nThe fate of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, a military alliance of ex-Soviet states, highlights the challenges it faces as it seeks to maintain and advance its geopolitical sway across Eurasia.\nOften referred to as a \"Russian NATO\", the alliance was formed in 1992 to fill the security vacuum left by the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nBut three decades on, the bloc is struggling with \"serious issues of competitiveness and viability,\" Armenian analyst Hakob Badalyan said.\nYerevan is boycotting the organization, though it has remained a formal member.\nIt accuses the CSTO - and therefore Moscow - of abandoning it amid conflict with arch-foe Azerbaijan.\nIt is not the first membership challenge faced by the CSTO, which comprises Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, alongside Russia and Armenia.\nBaku and Georgia left in 1999. Uzbekistan followed suit in 2012.\nBoth Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan ignored calls to rejoin the alliance last year.\nRussia's difficulties in central Asia and the Caucasus stand in contrast to its successes in forging and deepening alliances with China, India, Iran, North Korea and African countries amid its invasion of Ukraine.\nBadalyan sees those developments as connected.\n\"At war with Ukraine, Russia has far fewer resources to fully play its role as the CSTO's military-technical leader,\" he said.\nThe CSTO still has a role to play, others suggested - though the idea of it acting as a powerful Russian alternative to NATO is questionable.\nIt intervened in Kazakhstan in 2022, where predominantly Russian \"peacekeeping forces\" helped quell deadly anti-government riots and stabilize President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev's regime.\nAt the time, Russia and the CSTO positioned themselves as guarantors of stability for allied authoritarian regimes - a scenario that now seems impossible to replicate.\nThe CSTO's role in the region has also shifted following the Taliban's military takeover in Afghanistan in 2021.\nAccording to Vladimir Zharikhin, deputy director of the Russian Institute of CIS Countries, the group has helped by \"ensuring the stability of central Asian countries bordering Afghanistan\" since then. That is \"largely due to Russian military bases in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan,\" he said.\nMoscow and its closest ally Minsk hope military drills in Kyrgyzstan this month, and Kazakhstan this week, will show the alliance still has geopolitical relevance.\nBut the alliance appears split even on the definition of who those \"enemies\" are.\nWhile Russia sees the West as an existential threat, central Asian states and Armenia are strengthening ties with the United States and Europe.\nAside from Belarus, none have backed Moscow's war on Ukraine.\nAnd even Minsk - financially, politically, economically and militarily reliant on Moscow - does not recognize Russia's territorial claims over eastern Ukraine.\nWestern countries are not blind to the possible geopolitical opening in the region.\nLast week, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited central Asia, where his hosts urged him to invest in energy and transport infrastructure to connect the region to Europe, bypassing Russia.\nIn July, central Asian states held their first joint military exercises without Moscow, while Armenia hosted joint military drills with the United States.\nChina is expanding its security influence in central Asia, both through bilateral agreements and its own regional bloc, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.\nSensing the challenge, there is little chance of Russian President Vladimir Putin simply accepting his country's diminished influence in a region it ruled over for decades. \"The time has come to begin a broad discussion on a new system of collective security in Eurasia,\" he said in June.\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE",

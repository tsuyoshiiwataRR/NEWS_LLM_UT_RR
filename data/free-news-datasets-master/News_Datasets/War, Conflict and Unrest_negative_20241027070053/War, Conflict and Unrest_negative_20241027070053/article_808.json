    "text": "Frenchwoman Killed in Lebanon Explosion Amid Escalating Conflict An 87-year-old Frenchwoman was killed after a powerful explosion in southern Lebanon. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the incident, noting the building collapsed. Israel's bombardment of Lebanon continues despite international calls for a ceasefire. Around 20,000 French citizens live in Lebanon, maintaining strong ties with Paris. An 87-year-old Frenchwoman was killed after a powerful explosion in the south of Lebanon, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on Thursday. The ministry stated that the building where the Frenchwoman lived collapsed following the explosion. No other French nationals are known to be affected by the conflict so far. Israel has continued its bombardment in Lebanon, with ongoing strikes causing numerous fatalities. In the face of a possible regional escalation, Israel has rejected ceasefire proposals from the United States, France, and other allies. Around 20,000 French citizens are registered with the French foreign affairs ministry as residing in Lebanon. The country, once a French protectorate, maintains strong connections with Paris.

    "text": "Massive red alerts were issued in Tel Aviv early on Friday amid fears of a large-scale missile attack from Yemen. Israeli authorities said that sirens were heard after Sana'a launched a missile. However, the IDF later added that it had successfully intercepted the rocket. \\\"The missile that was fired from Yemen was successfully intercepted by the 'Arrow' Aerial Defense System. Sirens and explosions were heard following the interception and falling shrapnel,\\\" the IDF statement said.

This comes after Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi declared that Yemeni resistance movement will support Lebanon and Hezbollah against Israel. In a televised address on Thursday, he condemned the Israeli strikes on Lebanon. They are blocking Hezbollah from 'supporting Gaza and the Palestinian people', he said. Houthi further claimed that Israel's aggression is 'pre-planned' and had been 'in place for years'. He asserted that Hezbollah is 'stronger than ever before'.

This is while Hezbollah's role in supporting Gaza has become stronger and more influential,” he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday vowed to carry out “full force” strikes against Hezbollah. His statement came after Tel Aviv carried out a strike in the Lebanese capital, killing a senior Hezbollah commander. \\\"We are continuing to strike Hezbollah with full force. And we will not stop until we reach all our goals, chief among them the return of the residents of the north securely to their homes,\\\" Netanyahu said.

    "text": "Modern Trail of Tears: The Commodification of First Foods and Medicines in Relation to Food Apartheid and Genocide of Indigenous Peoples\nFirst Advisor\nJudy Bluehorse Skelton\nDate of Award\nSpring 6-16-2024\nDocument Type\nThesis\nLanguage\nEnglish\nSubjects\nFood Apartheid, Genocide, Indigenous Nations, Native American Studies, Origin Stories, First Foods and Medicines\nAbstract\nI am asking you to share in a cultural conversation with me. I will use different fonts in order to express my autobiographical and ethnographic Indigenous story separate from traditional academic writing This will not be a traditional thesis by any means of academic writing; this will also be a living document in a format of a cited reflection in order to continue the conversation not only through my Indigenous Research but also through community, and ideally will create everlasting solutions. However, this will be an introduction into my Indigenous writing and Indigenous voice.\nI will be discussing the next steps of my ethnographic, autobiographical thesis which is a method that I have been focusing on over the last several years that was introduced to me by Indigenous scholars Rachel Black Elk (Lakota, Lumbee) and Renea Perry (Tlingit/Inupiat/N. European) of Portland State University. I recognized the importance of this style as I found my voice in academic writing, after the month that I spent traveling in Kenya in July 2023. I am working in the ideology of a scholarly cited reflection1 and have been reading Indigenous scholarship in this format as well to draw further inspiration and direction. I will also introduce additional Indigenous Scholarship that I will be studying as I continue to write my thesis in order to deconstruct, decolonize and Re-Indigenize myself as well as my writing and this process. This thesis is an open invitation to the public beyond academia and will be presented as such to the communities as a living document.\nComments\nI am Afro-Indigenous undergraduate with a major of a Honors BA in Indigenous Nations and Native American Studies with a ITECK certificate. This is not included in the degree options drop down.\nRecommended Citation\nJones, Darius R., \"Modern Trail of Tears: The Commodification of First Foods and Medicines in Relation to Food Apartheid and Genocide of Indigenous Peoples\" (2024).

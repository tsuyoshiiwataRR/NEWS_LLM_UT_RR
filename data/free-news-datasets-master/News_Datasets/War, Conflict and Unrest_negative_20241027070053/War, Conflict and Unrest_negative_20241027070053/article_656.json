    "text": "… As N-HYPPADEC distributes 33 boats\nThe Governor of Niger State, Mohammed Umaru Bago has decried the high number of lives lost to boat mishaps in the state in the past three years.\nAccordingly, he said one hundred and eighty two lives were lost in the last three years even as the National Hydro-Electric Power Producing Areas Development Commission (N-HYPPADEC) distributes 33 boats.\nRepresented by his Deputy, Comrade Yakubu Garba, the Governor on Thursday said at the headquarters of N-HYPPADEC in Minna to mark the 2024 World Maritime Day and the distribution of 33 fibre Glass boats to benefiting States that “The huge number of loss we have incurred as a result of boat mishaps in the State is unacceptable”.\nAccording to him “From the available data, the State lost a total of 95 lives in 2022, 68 lives in 2023 and so far this year ( 2024) 19 casualties have been recorded\n“No life is worthy more than the other, we should all walk the talk to halt the menace”.\nHe commended the N-HYPPADEC for the gesture noting that, it will go a long way to ameliorate the suffering of communities in riverine areas of the affected States.\nHe added that the State government is committed towards ensuring that, the inland water ways of the States are safe for water transportation all year round.\nSpeaking earlier, the Managing Director, N- HYPPADEC, Alhaji Abubakar Sadiq Yelwa while speaking on the theme for this year’s World Maritime Day – “Navigating the Future: Safety First” noted that it aligned perfectly with the vision of the N-HYPPADEC.\nHe added that “since inception in 2021, the Commission has been consistent in our efforts to improve the lives of the people in our member states.\n“One of our primary goals has been to enhance marine transportation and mitigate the recurrence of boat mishaps, which have plagued these communities for many years.\n“The majority of N-HYPPADEC communities are riverine, and for these communities, water transportation is not just a means of travel but the backbone of their daily life and commercial activities.\n“Unfortunately, this reliance on the water transportation system has come with a heavy price as boat mishaps have equally become recurring issues in the areas.\n“From the reports we have been receiving, the accidents were as a result of variety of factors, including the presence of tree logs/water snags, which obstruct the safe passage of boats, overloading, night travels as well as failure to use life jackets by the passengers on board.\n“The Commission’s finding reveals that the flow of the rivers is often affected by the operation of hydro dams, which complicate navigation for both commercial and private boat operators.\n“We cannot forget the painful instances of boat accidents that have claimed lives and caused untold hardship in the communities neighboring the Kainji Lake between the vicinity of Shagunu of Borgu Emirate here in Niger State and Warrah of Yauri Emirate in Kebbi State.\n“Recognising the dangers posed by water snags, we collaborated with NIWA to carry out a water snags clearing project. Together, we removed a considerable number of tree logs from parts of the Kainji and Shiroro Lakes, significantly reducing the likelihood of boat accidents caused by the snags.\n“We procured and distributed 10,000 life jackets to various communities across the N-HYPPADEC zone. These life jackets were meant to save lives during accident”\nThe Managing director explained that, “We decided to procure fibre glass boats instead of the traditional wooden boats because they are often prone to accidents.\n“They are more durable, safer and offer superior performance in navigating rivers. Unlike the wooden boats, the fiber glass boats are built to withstand the rigors of water travel.”.",

    "text": "Dr. Ramzi Salti met with his new students at [Stanford University](https://www.kqed.org/news/tag/stanford-university) earlier this week. In the Arabic language course he has taught at the university for 25 years, students read the news and discuss current events. Salti, an advanced lecturer in the school’s Arabic program, told KQED he’s unsure how to incorporate the most recent conflict in Lebanon into his curriculum. “We haven’t had time to process any of it,” said Salti, whose family left Lebanon and immigrated to the United States 45 years ago. “But you cannot have a course about current events in the Middle East and not go there.” Concern and anxiety have gripped the Bay Area’s Lebanese diaspora, a community of more than 5,000 people, according to estimates from the West Coast’s [Honorary Consulate of Lebanon](https://honoraryconsulateoflebanon-uswestcoast.org/), since Israel began pummeling southern Lebanon with airstrikes on Monday. More than 500 people were reportedly [killed](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/world/middleeast/lebanon-civilian-death-toll-israel.html), including 50 children.",

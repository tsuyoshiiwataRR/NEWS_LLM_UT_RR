    "text": "Military Report: Russia and China press tensions in the Pacific impact the U.S. and treaty allies Conflicts and incursions are intensifying for Alaska, Japan and the Philippines FAIRBANKS, Alaska (KTVF) - As Russian aircraft continue to enter the air defense identification zone (ADIZ) near Alaska, 2024 appears to be on track to surpass the number of detected flights that occurred in 2023. As Russia and China continue to conduct exercises and other military operations, they have increased their presence and sometimes tactics in the Pacific. Those incursions and tactics are now creating increased concern for leadership in Alaska, Japan and the Philippines. The later two being treaty defense partners of the U.S. [Just days after defense forces were sent to Western Alaska](https://www.webcenterfairbanks.com/2024/09/19/us-troops-finish-deployment-remote-alaska-island-amid-spike-russian-military-activity/) in response to Russian incursions, four more Russian planes were detected off the coast of Alaska on Monday. It is unclear what kind of planes were detected but the Russian aircraft did not cross into U.S. airspace. While these aircraft were “not seen as a threat” this marks the fifth time in the month of Sept. that Russian aircraft came near U.S. airspace. Two weeks ago, the U.S. military sent over 100 troops to the Aleutian Islands as well as a Coast Guard and naval vessel. The deployment of those units came as a response to incursions near Alaska, including Russian vessels entering Alaska’s exclusive economic zone or EEZ. That incident also involved aircraft being intercepted as well. Despite the heightened response to activity, the Pentagon echoed the statements of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and said that the activity was not seen as a threat. While those forces have returned to base, another incident occurred on Sep. 24. In response to the previous incident involving the deployment of defense forces, Alaska’s delegation expressed greater concern than the Pentagon.[ “Authoritarian regimes are testing the United States,”](https://www.webcenterfairbanks.com/2024/09/18/100-soldiers-deployed-aleutian-chain-amid-increasing-russian-chinese-activity-near-alaska/) said Sen. Dan Sullivan, the junior senator for Alaska. According to NORAD, there are usually six or seven incidents of this kind in a given year. There have been over 50 of these incidents in the last two years combined however. In 2023 there were a total of 26 detections and so far there have been 25 this year. That also means 2024 is likely to see an even higher number of adversary aircraft detections compared to 2023. The increase comes at a time when Russian and U.S. relations are more tense as a result of the war in Ukraine which began in Feb. of 2022. Those incidents have at times included Chinese forces which have also raised concerns for the both U.S. and our allies. Japan faced similar intrusions on Monday as well as a Russian spy plane entered Japanese airspace. This led to Japanese fighter jets being scrambled to intercept the Russian aircraft. Those jets had to use flares for the first time to ward off the Russian aircraft as it did not respond to verbal communications. The incident in Japan is just one of many that reflect activity seen near Alaska and the growing number if incidents in the area has led Tokyo to increase military investments. That activity is also of concern to the U.S. as there are multiple U.S. military bases in Japan with whom we have a defense treaty. Another defense treaty partner that hosts U.S. military assets is the Philippines. They have also have had multiple incidents with Chinese vessels as territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Those incidents have been described as physical conflicts that come just short of being warfare tactics. According to the U.S. Dept. of State, the most recent incident between these two nations in the month of Aug. The situation involved a Chinese Coast Guard vessel deliberately colliding with a Filipino Coast Guard vessel three times in the Philippines EEZ. Incidents such as this one have also occurred with U.S. personnel on board Filipino vessels. If these incidents escalate to included an armed attack, it could invoke article four of a 1951 defense treaty between the Philippines and the U.S. which could mean American involvement in the conflict. While it remains unlikely that war will break out in the region, Alaska’s strategic position in the has been getting more attention from Washington D.C. amidst the rising tensions.

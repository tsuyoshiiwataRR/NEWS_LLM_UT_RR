    "text": "Russian footballers received certificates from the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation for helping the occupiers. Four footballers received certificates from the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. The Volunteer Corps of the Ministry of Defense of Russia awarded certificates to CSKA goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev, Khimki defender Georgy Dzhikiya, Zenit striker Alexander Sobolev, and Pari NN defender Stanislav Magkeev. The footballers were thanked for \"providing humanitarian aid and delivering the necessary equipment for the fulfillment of combat tasks to liberate new territories of Russia\". The controversial deputy of the State Duma of Russia, Svetlana Zhurova, also expressed praise for the players: “Well done! Many people often provide help, they just don't publicize it, and then suddenly, gratitude appears for everyone. Probably, they didn't shout from every corner that they were doing this. Charitable help is usually provided this way. Then the people they helped thank them. And when it is announced to the whole country...” Alexander Sobolev was listed on the \"Myrotvorets\" website, where he is considered an accomplice in the crimes of the Russian authorities against Ukraine and its citizens. He participated in an event where footballers entered the match along with the children of participants in the Russian aggression against Ukraine. The event was organized by the \"Defenders of the Fatherland\" fund, which provides assistance to Russian occupiers and their families. All children participating in the event had the emblem of this fund on their shirts. During the match, the players held the hands of the children of Russian occupiers. Alexander Sobolev, born on March 7, 1997, in Barnaul, played for the Russian national football team. He played 14 matches and scored 6 goals. Sobolev also twice received the award for the best player of the month in the Russian Premier League.

    "text": "/ world today news/ Mihail Mikov before the session of the National Assembly of the BSP:\nWe are giving artificial respiration to the ABV, the election of Radev is predetermined, before we had a “social president” (ed. Georgi Parvanov), now we will have “military men”!\nI understand that we are looking at the final text, I understand that any party, including ours, going to the presidential elections, must have a platform, but I am very afraid that it may be doing so at a late time. I understand that we are finalizing the text, but I want to correct a few general errors in two directions. The first is somewhat procedural in nature, and I will ask a few rhetorical questions.\nOn what basis and with what mandate the leadership it’s the party’s led negotiations with other political forces without having a platform? As I said, the question is rhetorical. As a result of this gross political error, the impression was created that management is looking for the person to unite unclear who not realizing that Diogenes was already looking for the man 2000 years ago.\nWe need to see what we unite around and then look for the person who will best protect us! And not vice versa.\nAnd one last rhetorical question. Today we have to choose a candidate who will represent our party in the presidential elections. However, how will this candidate protect this platform which we are voting on now, and he will not have the opportunity to familiarize himself with its final text? And what commitment will he make to the National Assembly?\nIn essence, my remarks on the platform are also procedural in nature. We recently held a convention. At this congress we adopted a very good document, at least according to many delegates and party members, and according to me. It is about “Political platform of BSP”. And here I will allow myself a piece of advice for the young, because I am quite old now. When there are voted documents – they must be implemented! And not only to change the chairman of the party!\nAnd I don’t see the direct connection between this vote right now and the documents we voted on before.\nI also suggest that the group that will process the text in its final version should unite around the political platform voted on at the congress and shorten it to the parts that concern the institution of the presidency.\nAnd in conclusion, I want to say that all the “black” texts, the bolt ones I mean, sound like, in fact, any political force can easily stand behind them.\nThank you.\n#Mikhail #Mikov #artificial #respiration #ABV #Radevs #choice #predetermined",

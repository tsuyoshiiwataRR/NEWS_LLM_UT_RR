    "text": "Peru Declares State of Emergency Amid Rising Crime Surge Peru's government has declared a 60-day state of emergency in Lima and Callao provinces to combat a spike in crime. This decision comes as bus drivers strike for increased security. Defense Minister Walter Astudillo announced plans to toughen penalties, including new classifications for urban terrorism. Peru's government declared a 60-day state of emergency in districts around Lima on Thursday to combat a surge in crime, Prime Minister Gustavo Adrianzen announced. The measures come amid a bus drivers' strike demanding more security measures. Adrianzen stated that the state of emergency, affecting 12 districts in metropolitan Lima and Callao province, will allow the armed forces to assist police in addressing a dramatic increase in extortion cases plaguing the capital. Thousands of commuters were left stranded as public transport was scarce due to the strike. Defense Minister Walter Astudillo revealed plans to propose legislation categorizing hired assassination, kidnapping, extortion, and illegal firearm possession as 'urban terrorism,' aiming for harsher penalties. Additional measures include expanding capacity in a high-altitude prison and considering extending the emergency state to other areas. (With inputs from agencies.)

Hoekstra's comments could shine light on the GOP's approach to the upcoming election and echoed false claims, from some in the party, of widespread voter fraud after Michigan's 2020 presidential race, which GOP nominee Donald Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden. Multiple election officials described Hoekstra's claim as false Thursday, and Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum, a Democrat, said similar remarks were \"unsafe\" for election workers and democracy. Hoekstra, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers and state House Minority Leader Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, appeared at a fundraiser Monday night in Farmington Hills for the Michigan Republican Party. At the event, Hoekstra said Rogers knows how to win close races, mentioning his 2000 victory in a U.S. House election by 111 votes. https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2024/09/26/donald-trump-pete-hoekstra-michigan-stolen-election-claim-democracy-jocelyn-benson-republican/75392441007/ [InfoView thread info, including edit history](/?com=thread&info=1&address=105811439) [TrashPut this thread in your Trash Can (My DU » Trash Can)](/?com=login) [BookmarkAdd this thread to your Bookmarks (My DU » Bookmarks)](/?com=login)3 replies, 323 views [ShareGet links to this post and/or share on social media] [AlertAlert this post for a rule violation](/?com=login) [PowersThere are no powers you can use on this post] [EditCannot edit other people's posts] [ReplyReply to this post](/?com=post&post&forum=1058&pid=11439) [EditCannot edit other people's posts] [Rec (2)] [ReplyReply to this post](/?com=post&forum=1058&pid=11439) [NoneDon't highlight anything](#!)

    "text": "Anyone can contribute to The Roar and have their work featured alongside some of Australia’s most prominent sports journalists. Alex Carey is sure to be the pantomime villain on Australia’s return to Lord’s for the first time since the infamous 2023 Ashes Test ‘cheating’ bust-up — but captain Mitch Marsh smiles his in-form batter is just rapt to be back at the home of cricket. Marsh is adamant his side have “moved on” following the unprecedented scenes of last June when Carey became England’s public enemy number one for his controversial stumping of Jonny Bairstow, leading to bad blood on the field and howling fury off it among the spluttering Long Room grandees . Not that Carey is in the slightest bit worried as he heads to the potentially decisive fourth one-day international, having, with seemingly perfect timing, rediscovered the batting form which could make MCC members choke on their lunch again on Friday. With local media happily suggesting Carey is “returning to the scene of the crime”, the wicketkeeper’s superb innings of 77no at Headingley and 74 at Chester-le-Street in the last two ODIs have made him even more of an important target in English eyes. His form may have deteriorated amid the furore over the final three Tests last year, but the 33-year-old has been flying since being reintroduced to the white-ball side behind the stumps, taking advantage of his chance after Josh Inglis suffered a quad niggle. Asked if he felt Carey had been on a revenge mission after his trials and tribulations last summer, Marsh said: “I don’t think that’s in his character, but Alex loves playing England, we all do. I think he’s just rapt to be back here playing for Australia. “He’s been fantastic since he came back in, both innings that he’s played have been outstanding knocks for the team. “He’s a great character to have around our team and very excited to be back in.” The captain was inevitably reminded of last year’s shenanigans at Lord’s, but brushed it all aside in his usual laid-back manner. Asked if there had been much talk about the 2023 hoo-ha, he shrugged: “No there hasn’t, we’ve really moved on from that, I think. “There’s always excitement playing at Lord’s. It’s the greatest ground in the world – bar the WACA of course – and the history and tradition here, it’s always a fantastic place to play. “Yes it was (incredible scenes). Obviously these things happen in Ashes Tests, there’s not a series goes by that doesn’t have some sort of drama, but we’re just rapt to be here.” Marsh said he was happy that, for the first time on this injury and illness-hit white-ball tour, he’ll have a fully fit squad at his disposal, with Adam Zampa and Travis Head’s return “massive” after England won the third of the five-match series in their absence at Chester-le-Street to narrow the deficit to 2-1 Inglis is also fit to return after an impressive start to the tour with Marsh not ruling out the prospect that both he and Carey could play as Australia seek to seal the series in front of a full-house before Sunday’s final match in Bristol. Once again, though, there are fears rain could interfere. It poured down at Lord’s on Thursday to deny both teams the chance to practice outdoors, and showers are also forecast in the morning and early afternoon on match day. © AAP",

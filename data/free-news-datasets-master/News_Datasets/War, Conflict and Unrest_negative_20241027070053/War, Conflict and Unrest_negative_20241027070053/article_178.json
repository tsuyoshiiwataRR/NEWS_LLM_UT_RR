    "text": "Bangladesh ex-captain Shakib Al Hasan, facing prosecution for his relationship with the country's former leader, said on Thursday he would soon retire from international cricket but hoped to play at least one more match back home first. Shakib is facing murder charges along with dozens of other members of ex-premier Sheikh Hasina's party who have been accused of culpability in a deadly police crackdown on protesters. The 37-year-old, who briefly served as a lawmaker under Hasina this year, has not returned to Bangladesh since the toppling of her government last month in a student-led revolution. Shakib said that next year's Champions Trophy in Pakistan would be his last international outing. But he added that he wanted to return home for a slated two-Test series against South Africa, and had asked the Bangladesh Cricket Board if he could come back. \"It's my desire, I have said this to BCB and the selectors,\" Shakib told reporters ahead of Friday's second Test against India in Kanpur. \"They agreed with me, that they are trying to organise everything if possible, so that I can go back to Bangladesh, play those two Test matches in Mirpur and finish my Test career there.\" He added: \"If that doesn't happen maybe this is my last one.\" Shakib told reporters ahead of Friday's second Test against India in Kanpur that he did not \"want to talk much\" about the criminal proceedings against him. \"You all know what type of case it is, and where I was and what I was doing at that time,\" he said. Shakib was playing in a domestic Twenty20 cricket competition in Canada during the unrest that ousted Hasina. He said he hoped to return home to play the swan song of his Test career against South Africa if the series went ahead. \"I am a citizen of Bangladesh, so I shouldn't have any problem going back to Bangladesh,\" he said. \"My concern is my safety and security in Bangladesh. My close friends and family members are concerned. I hope things are getting better.\" Shakib said he had already called time on his T20 career following the World Cup in June. \"I played my last match during my last game of the World Cup. We have discussed this with selectors and board,\" he said. \"This is the right time for me to move on and BCB will look into some new players.\" Shakib was the driving force of the Bangladesh team's rise to become serious international contenders, enthralling fans through both star turns and scandals. He remains the only player to have topped the International Cricket Council all-rounder rankings in all three formats simultaneously. Shakib played a key role in his team's historic Test series sweep in Pakistan earlier this month, and went to England to play county cricket for Surrey before heading to India. He has represented Bangladesh in 70 Tests, 247 ODIs and 129 T20 matches since his international debut in 2006. India back Rahul to hit top gear in Bangladesh Test Kanpur, India, Sept 26, 2024 (AFP) - India are backing senior batsman KL Rahul to find his run-scoring touch ahead of a busy schedule of nine Tests in four months, starting with Bangladesh in Kanpur on Friday. India won the first Test against Bangladesh in Chennai by 280 runs to lead the two-match series 1-0, with Rahul scoring 16 and 22 not out on his return to the side for the first time since January's opening Test against England. He made 86 and 22 against England, but sat out the remaining four matches because of a thigh injury. \"I feel KL is someone who understands his game very well,\" assistant coach Abhishek Nayar told reporters on Thursday. \"Yes, there are times where a player is finding his feet,\" he added. \"Hopefully we can have a turnaround in KL as well.\" Nayar noted that Rahul had shown glimpses of form during the first Test win against Bangladesh, when his 22 off 19 balls helped to set up a declaration. \"The way he was batting in the second innings is the kind of cricket we are expecting and hoping for,\" he said. \"I am pretty sure going forward you will see the expectations and the performances that you have from him.\" COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

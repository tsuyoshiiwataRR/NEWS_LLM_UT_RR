    "text": "Unprecedented numbers of violent gang members, drug cartel operatives, and aliens on the terror watchlist are among the estimated 11.6 million illegal aliens expected to have entered the United States during the Biden-Harris administration, a report released Wednesday by the House Committee on Homeland Security states.\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ open border policy and their exploitation of U.S. asylum laws allowed millions of unvetted and unlawful aliens to bypass American immigration laws, risking the lives of many Americans, according to the jaw-dropping data in “Crisis by Design: A Comprehensive Look at the Biden-Harris Administration’s Unprecedented Border Crisis.”\nThe committee reported that U.S. Border Patrol arrested 52,755 illegal aliens with criminal records since the start of fiscal year 2021. Although three months remain until the end of the Biden-Harris term, the data reflects approximately 30,000 more individuals with criminal backgrounds were arrested by Border Patrol in comparison to fiscal years 2017-2021.\nAmericans have fallen victim to the rising number of violent offenses committed by criminal aliens since the start of fiscal year 2021. Convicted criminal alien encounters have skyrocketed over the course of the Biden-Harris administration, as seen in the data visualization graph below published by The Heritage Foundation from U.S. Customs and Border Protection reports.\n(The Heritage Foundation from U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.) For example, CBP’s illegal drug possession and trafficking statistics total 7,846 recorded encounters from 2021-2024.\nReports of crimes committed by illegal aliens, including rape, murder, and narcotics smuggling, are detailed in “Crisis by Design.”\nJosephine Dunn lost her daughter to fentanyl poisoning in 2021 and told the committee, “In my humble opinion, Mr. Mayorkas’ border policy is partially responsible for my daughter’s death,” referring to the secretary of homeland security.\nBiden’s border has facilitated the drug trafficking trade and resulted in roughly 200,000 Americans reported dead since 2021 because of fentanyl poisoning, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nAdditionally, 1,339 documented illegal alien convictions for sexual offenses and 178 illegal alien convictions for murder and manslaughter have been reported since the start of fiscal year 2021, according to CBP.\nWitnesses to some of the horrific consequences of our open borders testified before a House Committee on Homeland Security hearing Wednesday. Among them were a mother who lost her child to violent rape and murder at the hands of an illegal alien and border town leaders left struggling to handle a crisis that overwhelms their local communities.\nThese are the voices that Biden and Harris ignore.\nPatty Morin stated in her testimony that the administration never once reached out to offer condolences for the loss of her daughter, Rachel Morin, who was tragically raped and murdered by an alien who illegally entered this country under Biden-Harris policies.\nThe administration also ignored the expert advice given to the Biden transition team in 2020-2021, according to transcribed interview excerpts within the committee report. Instead, the Biden transition team focused on “dismantling” President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.\nBiden repealed the effective anti-asylum fraud tool, the “Remain in Mexico” program, and instead implemented the “catch and release” policy that allowed inadmissible aliens into the U.S. without detaining them. The Left’s opposition to Trump defined Biden’s agenda as he, along with Harris and Mayorkas, opened our borders to millions of inadmissible aliens.\nThe White House acted in an unprecedented manner to “diminish the security along our southern border,” according to former Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott’s interview published in the committee report. Scott also concurred with other expert witnesses that the current state of our border was avoidable and was “a crisis by design.”\nFormer Department of Homeland Security officials also testified to the committee that the Biden-Harris administration restricted federal agencies from enforcing immigration laws—hauntingly described by the committee as the “gutting of interior enforcement.”\nThe White House’s engineered crisis left law enforcement officers feeling unsupported, resulting in 4,000 Border Patrol personnel choosing early retirement, according to the committee report. This number doubles the retirement rates during the Trump and Barack Obama presidencies.\nThe House Committee on Homeland Security’s report highlights the devastating consequences of Biden and Harris’ open border policies. American communities are left struggling with increased crime and drugs, overcrowded schools and emergency rooms, housing shortages, higher taxes, and a severe distrust in the current administration’s willingness to protect Americans.\nAccording to the committee, the “willful decimation of border security” will be how the Biden-Harris administration will be remembered throughout history.",

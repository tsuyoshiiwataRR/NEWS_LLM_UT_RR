([KPTV](https://www.kptv.com/2024/09/26/captain-missing-6-rescued-after-boat-capsizes-columbia-river/)/Gray News) - The captain of a fishing guide boat is the only person missing after the ship capsized Wednesday on a river in Oregon. The Hood River County Sheriff’s Office along with other law enforcement agencies responded to a call of a capsized boat in the Columbia River near the mouth of the White Salmon River around 11:30 a.m. Officials said six people on the boat were pulled from the water and taken to shore. Two of those rescued were taken to the hospital. The captain of the ship was the only other person on board. He is still missing, according to Hood River Police. Investigators said the boat was a 24-foot North River fishing boat last seen in the area of the green navigation buoy near the White Salmon inlet. The sheriff’s office has not released the names of the people involved out of respect for the families. The investigation and search for the captain will continue.

    "text": "The Pentagon has given the green light to send white phosphorus ammunition to Ukraine, but the White House continues to stubbornly deny its proposal.\nThe US military uses white phosphorus shells to illuminate battlefields, but human rights advocates oppose its use near populated areas because of the chemical burns on the human skin.\nAccording to the U.S. network NBC, Pentagon officials have recommended that the Biden administration deliver such ammunition to the battlefield in Ukraine, but the White House has rejected the idea several times, according to three officials familiar with the matter who have not been named.\nNotably, white phosphorus bombs are not permitted internationally by the Geneva Convention of 1980, which explicitly prohibits their use as a weapon.\nThe dangers of white phosphorus\nWhite phosphorus is a chemical commonly used to illuminate enemy positions. Those exposed to it are burned and if they survive suffer terrible and irreversible skin burns.\nPhosphorus burns carry an increased risk of mortality due to the absorption of phosphorus into the body. In fact, it can lead to problems with the liver, kidneys, heart and in some cases multiple organ failure.\nWhen used in ammunition, white phosphorus reaches up to 800 degrees Celsius.\nThe Israeli forces have previously been accused of violating the Geneva Convention by using white phosphorus bombs during the 2008-2009 Gaza war with the Israeli military denying this.\nDuring the armed conflicts of the 20th century, including World War II and Vietnam, the U.S. used white phosphorus against enemy troops.\nThe Pentagon’s recommendation was to provide white phosphorus missiles to Ukraine to produce light and smoke, not for use against enemy troops.\nDistinguishing between enemy troops and civilians for use of the chemical\nInternational law requires soldiers using it to be able to distinguish between military locations and areas where civilians may be concentrated.\nThe Pentagon, however, was quick to recommend sending the white phosphorus ammunition to Ukraine as part of several aid packages, including a recent one, as Presidential Withdrawal Authority, according to officials.\nTwo of the officials said the stigma surrounding white phosphorus and concerns raised about civilians continues, putting the brakes on the Biden administration’s approval of the Pentagon’s proposal.\nUkraine accuses Russia of using white phosphorus in bombs\nFor his part, Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of using white phosphorus against civilians in Ukraine.\n“This morning, I received information that Russian troops had used phosphorus bombs against civilians in Ukraine,” Zelensky said during a meeting of NATO leaders in March 2022. He did not provide evidence of their use and the Pentagon could not confirm their use.",

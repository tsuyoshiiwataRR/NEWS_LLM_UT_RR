    "text": "Israeli Army Intercepts Missile Fired from Yemen Amid Persistent Hostilities The Israeli army intercepted a surface-to-surface missile from Yemen early Friday, with no changes to defensive guidelines. Yemen's Houthi militants have been targeting Israel in solidarity with Palestinians, following the Gaza war's escalation. The Houthis' missile and drone attacks have led to casualties and retaliatory Israeli airstrikes on Houthi military targets.

It is a fictional representation created for illustrative purposes only. SHARE In a recent escalation of hostilities, the Israeli army reported the interception of a missile launched from Yemen early Friday morning.\nAccording to an army statement, the missile, which triggered sirens in central Israel, was intercepted by an 'Arrow' interceptor outside Israeli territory. The incident did not prompt any changes to existing Israel Defense Forces (IDF) guidelines.\nYemen's Houthi militants, in solidarity with Palestinians since the onset of the Gaza war on October 7, have frequently targeted Israel with missiles and drones. July saw the first Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv, resulting in casualties. Israeli retaliatory airstrikes on Houthi positions have also caused significant harm.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nREAD MORE ON: Israel missile Yemen Houthi interception IDF Palestinians Gaza war airstrikes sirens Advertisement ALSO READ Uruguay Midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur Charged with Misconduct by FA Israeli Airstrike in Gaza Claims Lives of 10 Palestinians Chelsea Midfielder Sophie Ingle Suffers ACL Injury Escalating Violence: Six Palestinians Dead, 18 Injured in Qabatiya Raid IDFC FIRST Bank Launches Ashva Credit Card for Modern Indian Consumers POST / READ COMMENTS",

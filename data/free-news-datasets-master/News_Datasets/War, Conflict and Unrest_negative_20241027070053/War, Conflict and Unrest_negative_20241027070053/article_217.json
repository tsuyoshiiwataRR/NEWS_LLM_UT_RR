    "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin's threats to change the Kremlin's nuclear doctrine indicate his fear that Ukraine may be allowed to use long-range weapons to strike targets within Russia, stated Lithuanian Defense Minister Laurynas Kasčiūnas during a joint press conference with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. “We have all heard Putin’s words; I believe the key message is not what he said, but that when he talks about the new concept, he clearly signals that granting long-range strike capabilities to Ukraine is a really important issue he fears,\" said Kasčiūnas. Pistorius, for his part, emphasized that the West is not intimidated by Putin's nuclear rhetoric. “I can reiterate that this is Putin’s rhetoric; he speaks loudly and spreads his threats, and we should not be intimidated by that. We will do what we consider right. He can spread this through his channels, but it will not scare us,” stated the German Defense Minister. Putin's nuclear threats Yesterday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine, expanding the conditions for the use of its nuclear arsenal. According to him, the new doctrine will allow for a nuclear strike in response to aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear state, particularly if this occurs with the involvement or support of a nuclear state. For more information on what the nuclear doctrine is, the changes announced by Putin, and Ukraine's response, see the material by RBC-Ukraine .",

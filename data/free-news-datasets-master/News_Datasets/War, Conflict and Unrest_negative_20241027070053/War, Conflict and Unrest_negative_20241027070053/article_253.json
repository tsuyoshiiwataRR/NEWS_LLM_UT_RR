    "text": "hyotographics/Shutterstock Israel has intensified missile strikes on Hezbollah and signaled the possibility of a ground incursion into southern Lebanon.The country wants to degrade Hezbollah’s missile capability and restore security to its northern border but could find itself stuck in another Lebanese quagmire.With the US election looming, Washington is desperate to avoid a bloody escalation but appears unable to pressure Israel into backing down. Save for later Print Download Share Israel has stepped up its year-long war with Hezbollah, launching an intense bombing campaign in southern Lebanon and signaling its readiness for a ground invasion. World powers are scrambling to secure a temporary cease-fire and avert the long-feared escalation that could draw in Iran and the US. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may believe a short offensive could change the security reality in Israel’s favor, despite a long history of failed incursions. But Hezbollah has a huge missile arsenal at its disposal and may relish a fight on its own terrain. The US, now in the last weeks of a presidential election campaign, seems powerless to prevent it. Dramatic Escalation An Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon looks imminent, with Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi telling troops on Sep. 25 that recent airstrikes were designed to ”prepare the ground for your possible entry.” On the same day, Hezbollah fired a long-range missile at Tel Aviv, following Israeli strikes across Lebanon that killed some 600 people, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. In one of its most devastating attacks on Hezbollah since the Israel-Lebanon war in 2006, Israel targeted multiple rocket sites on Sep. 23, after killing at least 16 commanders in Hezbollah’s elite Radwan force in a strike in southern Beirut on Sep. 20. Just days earlier, thousands of communication devices used by Hezbollah operatives exploded simultaneously, killing dozens. Many thousands of Lebanese have fled the south of the country. Israel’s VulnerabilitiesIsrael may have enjoyed a string of intelligence successes, but Hezbollah’s long-range rockets firing on major population centers in Haifa, Netanya and Tel Aviv could test Israel’s resolve. A source close to Hezbollah said the group has both military and economic targets to choose from, including energy infrastructure. And although Israel has repeatedly struck Beirut, the source believes military targets are still preferred.Israeli industry sources believe an attack on the 197,000 barrel per day Haifa refinery could prove a game-changer for oil supply security. When the Gaza war erupted, Ashkelon oil port was closed, while Haifa and the Red Sea's Eilat terminal continued operations. But with Eilat now inoperable after months of sustained missile attacks by Yemen’s Houthis, a Haifa shutdown would leave only the 100,000 b/d Ashkelon plant operating. The Gaza conflict has also impacted Israeli gas output. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, production at the 11 trillion cubic foot Tamar field, operated by Chevron, was suspended until November as a precaution, in turn, halting flows via the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline that links Israel's Ashkelon to El-Arish in northern Egypt.The war in Gaza has already tested Israel’s capabilities and exhausted its troops. A ground offensive against Hezbollah fighters, battle-hardened from the Syrian conflict and operating on their own terrain, would be a formidable challenge. Nevertheless, Israeli domestic support will probably hold, says Chuck Frielich, a former Israeli deputy national security adviser. He points to the impact of bombing campaigns on the morale of European nations during World War II. “Rather than losing support, it can rally people,” he argues. Israelis may also believe that in an existential fight — given the psychological trauma of the Oct. 7 attack — they have nothing to lose.New War ObjectivesSo far, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s championing of a Gaza cease-fire as a roadmap for regional de-escalation has failed to sway Netanyahu. The prime minister favors unrelenting military pressure on both Hamas and Hezbollah and now seeks to impose an intolerable price on Hezbollah's policy of attacking Israel until such a cease-fire is reached. He has made the return of 60,000 residents to northern Israel a war objective and is determined to prevent Hezbollah from dictating where its people can live.“Israel is hoping to climb the escalation ladder to such a point that Hezbollah and Iran choose to step off it, but it would prefer not to carry out a ground incursion,” says Brandon Friedman of the Tel Aviv-based Moshe Dayan Center. But others argue that Israel knows the dangers of a ground offensive and that the option may be needed. “We have two goals — to push Hezbollah north of the Litani [river] so we can never have another Oct. 7 in the north, and to reduce its missile capabilities. And if we need to do it with ground forces, we will,” says Yaacov Amidror, a former national security adviser to Netanyahu.Escalation has obvious risks. “It’s a very dangerous game because it is hard to know how far they [Hezbollah and Iran] will go,” admits Freilich. He is skeptical about the \"escalate to de-escalate\" policy, adding that “in the end there has to be a diplomatic off ramp” for both sides.Military and Political RisksPushing Hezbollah north of the Litani River is a long-held objective that Israel argues is mandated by UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which marked the end of the 2006 war. But if its forces enter south Lebanon, the risks they face rise exponentially. Israel's previous attempts to create buffer zones have ended in failure. Its invasion of Lebanon in 1982, aimed at expelling the Palestinian Liberation Organization from its northern border, slowly dragged the country into Lebanon’s bloody, sectarian civil war, while attempts to control the South Lebanon Army to create a buffer zone ended with an Israeli pullout in 2000. A new incursion could rapidly slip out of Israel’s control this time. But some believe there is no choice. “We know there is a price to be paid, and we are ready to pay it,” says Amidror. To date, Washington has been unable to use its leverage over Israel to force a diplomatic solution to the conflict ahead of the Nov. 5 US election, despite the $12.5 billion in US military assistance that Israel has received since the Gaza war began. Netanyahu may have calculated that neither Democrats nor Republicans would deliberately withhold political or military support from Israel to force a diplomatic solution that might cost them votes in key battleground states. Asked if the strained relationship with the US is influencing Israeli calculations, Amidror insists Israel will \"not sacrifice Israeli security for the US elections.” But Freilich believes Israeli policymakers do take US polls into consideration and know the US doesn't want a ground operation. \"The last thing Harris or Biden want to see is a big war with lots of casualties,\" he says. Failed diplomatic efforts over the past year make it hard to see the US preventing it.",

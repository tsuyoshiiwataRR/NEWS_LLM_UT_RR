    "text": "The Agbogbomefia of Asogli State, Togbe Afede XIV has expressed grave concern about the afflictions caused by corrupt practices in Ghana.\nSpeaking at the ‘Anti-corruption Day’ event he held as part of activities to mark this year’s Yam Festival celebration at Ho in the Volta Region, the chief noted that corruption has also denied a large majority of Ghanaians the peace they deserve to enjoy.\nSpeaking at the event held on Wednesday, September 25, 2024, in his palace, Togbe said corruption in recent times has robbed Ghana of many good things and that the peace citizens desire cannot be found anymore.\n“All these things (corrupt practices) threaten our unity and our peace. We may seem to be enjoying peace but this is very much superficial and let’s remember that peace is not defined in terms of the absence of war, yes we’re not at war, but certainly, we don’t have the kind of peace we desire in our country, the kind of peace that our founding fathers had looked forward to in our country”.\nThe Chief also spoke about some practices that fuel corruption in the country.\nHe said, “The lack of respect for the truth in our country and the tribalization”. Too many questions are asked about where one comes from. In Nkrumah’s Ghana, we were all one people and that is what we all desire to have but unfortunately, tribalization has taken root in our country, and all of these things have made corruption possible”.\nThe businessman cum traditional leader vowed to continue speaking against corruption.\n“Our democracy, as we can all attest, has become an enterprise benefiting a few people. Ghana has become like an orphan child raped by the very people who have promised to take care of her” Togbe Afede said.\n“I have to express the hope that we can all join the fight against corruption” he added.\nThe Anti-corruption Day is observed as part of the annual Yam Festival celebration under the auspices of Togbe Afede XIV, to educate the public, especially young people on the impact of corruption and how to tackle it.",

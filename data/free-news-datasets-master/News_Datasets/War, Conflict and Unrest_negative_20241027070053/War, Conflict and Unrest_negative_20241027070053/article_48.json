    "text": "Along with the Criminal Homicide charge, 55-year-old Davis is also charged with two counts of Attempted Murder and two counts each of Aggravated Assault relating to other pedestrians endangered in the incident, according to the Lehigh County District Attorney's Office. All charges are first-degree felonies. The charges were filed after police investigated the hit-and-run incident in the 1300 block of North 14th Street at 6:05 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 9 [that resulted in Fistner's death](https://dailyvoice.com/pa/allentown/stephen-fistner-struck-dead-in-what-coroner-calls-homicide/). Police began investigating after receiving a report of a crash in the area, but numerous eyewitnesses described what was determined to be an intentional act, according to the district attorney's office. Eyewitnesses told police that Davis was driving a grey sedan in the area of 1339 North 14th Street and crashed into an unoccupied vehicle owned by Francesca Washington before fleeing the scene, authorities said. Washington went out to check the damage to her vehicle where she was joined by Fistner and his wife. While they were standing together by Washington's vehicle, Davis returned and drove directly at them, the district attorney's office said. Fistner pushed his wife out of the way before the car struck him and Washington. Washington suffered severe bodily injuries and is still hospitalized, authorities said. Fistner succumbed to his injuries at Lehigh Valley Hospital. At the time, Coroner Daniel Buglio ruled the death a homicide with the cause of death ruled as Blunt Force Injuries due to Pedestrian/Motor Vehicle Collision. Davis walked away from the scene but numerous community members called 9-1-1 and followed Davis while recording him on their cellphones, the district attorney's office said. He was taken into custody by Allentown police officers and confessed that his intention was to harm and kill Washington. Davis was placed in Lehigh County Jail without bail per state law on the charges, and will be formally arraigned on Wednesday, Oct. 30, the district attorney's office said.

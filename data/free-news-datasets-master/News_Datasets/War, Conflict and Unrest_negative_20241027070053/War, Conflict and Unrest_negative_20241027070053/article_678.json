    "text": "LAHORE:Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Central Punjab Secretary General Syed Hassan Murtaza Thursday said the PPP is not afraid of the incoming Chief Justice, rather hopeful he would uphold the principles of justice. Addressing a press conference at the People's Secretariat, Hassan dismissed the relevance of the Coordination Committee, urging for genuine political dialogues. He emphasised that the PPP does not negotiate with non-political entities. Flanked by PPP leaders, including Aslam Gill, Rai Shahjahan Bhatti, Tanveer Kaira and others, Hassan stressed that the party does not engage in politicising key national positions, affirming that the party’s path to power has always been through struggle, not shortcuts. He said the party has no interest in interfering in university appointments, advocating for dialogue over media messaging to resolve educational matters. In celebrating Bilawal Bhutto’s 36th birthday, the (PPP) Central Punjab Secretary General paid tributes to the sacrifices made by PPP workers over the years and highlighted the party’s pursuit of justice for 45 years. He underscored the backlog of over 60,000 cases in the Supreme Court and reiterated the party’s longstanding demand to reduce the retirement age of judges. He advised Imran Khan to learn from Nawaz Sharif’s political experiences and warned against wasting time on petty conflicts. He lauded the PPP’s governance in Sindh and called for Pakistan to rely on its own resources rather than the IMF. At the end of the event, two separate cakes were cut to celebrate the birthday of Bilawal, one by PPP Central Punjab and another by the People's Youth Organisation.

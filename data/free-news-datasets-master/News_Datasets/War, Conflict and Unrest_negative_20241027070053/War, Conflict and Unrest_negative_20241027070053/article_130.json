    "text": "The damage inflicted by the Biden/Harris regime will not be temporary. Democrats are systematically altering America’s demographics to make the country more like the hellhole Haiti :\nSince fiscal 2021, more than 485,000 Haitian illegal border crossers, a record, have been reported by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\nThat’s only the ones who are reported.\nGiving an indication of what we can expect under a Harris/Walz regime, the trend line is shooting straight up:\nThe overwhelming majority were reported this fiscal year, nearly 216,000, compared to 48,727 in fiscal 2021.\nOnce they are here, Democrats make sure they stay:\nAdditionally, since July, 205,000 Haitians have been released through the CHNV parole program, according to CBP data . Of the more than 765,000 illegal foreign nationals released into the country through the CBP One app, the top nationality is Haitian. Through these programs, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas also extended Temporary Permanent Status to them and granted work authorization.\nBut isn’t it illegal to facilitate the colonization of our country by unlawful invaders? Of course it is:\nAll of these programs are illegal, state attorneys general who’ve sued to stop them, argue. U.S. House Republicans also cited them as among the many illegal actions Mayorkas caused them to impeach him. Mayorkas has since only expanded the programs and extended TPS .\nRuined Springfield is not alone:\nIn Sylacauga, Alabama, residents have been demanding answers about busloads of Haitians being dropped into their community.\nElsewhere in Alabama,\nIn Coffee County, one resident claimed, “30,000 illegal aliens are scheduled to arrive in the first week of October, 1,000 of them in Baldwin County,” and that human trafficking was involved, 1819 News reported .\nThey say Pennsylvania is like Alabama, except with moonbat-infested Philadelphia at one end and Pittsburgh at the other turning it into a swing state. If Democrats remain in power, Alabama and Pennsylvania will both be like Haiti:\nIn Charleroi, Penn., the immigrant population has grown “by over 2,000% in just the last two years,” primarily due to a Haitian influx, 11 News reported .\nA dysfunctional country like Haiti could not successfully invade the United States without help from traitors:\nUnder current law, the majority of Haitians being released into the U.S. are inadmissible but have been ordered to be released by the Biden-Harris administration and given “notice to appear” documents for an immigration court hearing years into the future.\nBy the time their hearing comes up, they will have long since been amnestied.\nOn a tip from ABC of the ANC.",

When we arrived in this densely populated part of southern Beirut, the street was filled with glass and rubble and weary-looking faces. This is the fourth time in a week that this area has been hit. Behind a cordon, we could see a damaged apartment block just down the street. Below, a popular juice shop called \"Tasty Bees\" had survived unscathed. Israel-Hezbollah latest: Follow live updates here A detachment of Lebanese troops stood guard at the scene, but we knew they were not in charge in this part of the city. Dahieh is run by the political and military group Hezbollah and we were invited by their security personnel to take a closer look at the site. The fourth floor was badly damaged by a series of precision-guided missiles. The outer walls of various apartments had been removed, revealing mattresses, curtains and colourful chandeliers. The Israeli military claims to have killed a Hezbollah commander called Mohammed Surur in the strike. The country's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu later said that he had authorised it and described Surur as the leader of the Iran-backed group's unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drone division. Surur's death has not been confirmed by Hezbollah - but it certainly has not intimidated some of the group's supporters. \"I'd die for Hezbollah,\" shouted one man and he brushed the rubble off the top of his battered-looking car.",

    "text": "Macron Calls for Ceasefire in Lebanon French President Emmanuel Macron urged the U.S. to pressure Israel into accepting a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon, which Israeli officials have rejected. Macron warns an Israeli invasion would be a mistake and aims to escalate the matter to the UN if necessary. French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday called on the United States to pressure Israel to accept a plan for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon, warning that an Israeli invasion would be a monumental mistake. Earlier, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz rejected a French-U.S. proposal for the truce. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commanded the military to continue its operations with full force. Macron, speaking in English, emphasized there is still time for Netanyahu to commit to the plan during his interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \"I do believe that the U.S. now has to increase the pressure on the Prime Minister of Israel to do so,\" Macron stated. Should Netanyahu refuse, France plans to bring the issue before the United Nations Security Council. \"We expect all partners to be vocal and committed with us to send a clear message: Israel cannot invade Lebanon today. War is not an option; it would risk catastrophic escalation,\" he added. During a news conference in Montreal, Macron mentioned he did not consider the Israeli officials' comments on the ceasefire as final. He stressed that France opposes the idea of Lebanon turning into another Gaza, urging Israel to halt its strikes and calling on Hezbollah to cease retaliations. (With inputs from agencies.)",

    "text": "World SYRIA Thousands fleeing from Lebanon JDEIDET YABOUS — Families fleeing the escalating conflict in Lebanon are pouring into Syria in growing numbers. They waited for hours in heavy traffic Wednesday to reach the relative safety of another war-torn country. U.N. officials estimated that thousands of Lebanese and Syrian families had already made the journey, and those numbers are expected to grow as Israel targets southern and eastern Lebanon in an aerial bombardment that local officials say has killed more than 600 people this week, at least a quarter of them women and children. RUSSIA Putin issues new warnings to the West MOSCOW — President Vladimir Putin said any nation’s conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on his country. The strong, new warning to the West was outlined in a revision of Moscow’s nuclear doctrine. The threat was clearly aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons. ISRAEL Netanyahu will address UN JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travels to the United Nations this week with no end in sight to the war in Gaza, a conflict with Hezbollah intensifying and his and Israel’s international legitimacy at a low. Netanyahu will head to New York burdened also by what could be an imminent warrant for his arrest by the International Criminal Court.",

    "text": "Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will keep hitting Lebanese armed group Hezbollah with \"full force\" until residents in the north of Israel can go back to their homes safely. \"We will not stop until we achieve all our goals, first and foremost returning the residents of the north safely to their homes,\" he said. The Israeli prime minister made the remarks after landing in New York on Wednesday, local time, ahead of his speech at the United Nations General Assembly. Mr Netanyahu's speech is expected to focus on the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, and the future trajectory of the two, amid growing international pressure on Israel to strike a ceasefire deal with both Hamas and Hezbollah. Pro-Palestinian demonstrations are being held across New York protesting against his appearance at the UN. Earlier on Wednesday, Israel rejected 12 countries' calls for a ceasefire with Hezbollah along the Israel-Lebanon border. Mr Netanyahu's office released a statement making it clear the government had rejected the proposal entirely, also effectively disagreeing with its biggest ally, the United States. \"The prime minister instructed the IDF to continue the fighting with full force, and according to the plans presented to him,\" part of it read. \"Likewise, the fighting in Gaza will also continue until all the goals of the war are achieved.\" France, which was amongst the signatories to the joint statement, said it was opposed to Lebanon becoming a new Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron speaking in Montreal on Thursday said he did not think Mr Netanyahu's rejection of the proposed ceasefire was definitive, and that he would seek to persuade the Israeli prime minister to stop the strikes. Israeli military preparing for 'ground maneuver' The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have struck about 220 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in the past day, the military said on Thursday. \"The IDF is continuing to operate to degrade and dismantle Hezbollah's terrorist capabilities and infrastructure,\" it said in a statement. It said that among the targets that were struck were infrastructure sites, launchers from which projectiles were fired toward Israeli territory, Hezbollah operatives and weapons storage facilities in Lebanon. This included attacks on the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold. Lebanon's health ministry said at least 28 people had died overnight and during Thursday by Israeli air strikes. A strike also killed the head of one of Hezbollah's air force units, Mohammad Surur, two security sources said, the latest senior Hezbollah commander to be targeted in days of assassinations hitting the group's top ranks. Israel's military chief said earlier on Wednesday the I[DF was preparing for a \"possible entry\" into Lebanon by land](/news/2024-09-26/israeli-military-chief-ground-operations-in-lebanon-possible/104397906). Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar said late on Thursday aerial units were planning to assist troops in the event of a ground operation and will stop any arms transfers from Iran. \"We are preparing shoulder to shoulder with Northern Command for a ground maneuver. Prepared, if activated. This is a decision to be made above us,\" he told soldiers, in a video distributed by the IDF. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes during the heaviest Israeli bombardment of Lebanon since a major war in 2006, and more than 600 have been killed since Monday. Hezbollah has fired hundreds of missiles at targets in Israel including its commercial hub Tel Aviv, although Israel's aerial defence system has ensured that the damage has been limited. Israeli fighter jets on Thursday also hit infrastructure on the Lebanese-Syrian border to stop the transfer of weapons from Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israel's military said. Palestinian president urges UN to stop war in Gaza Hezbollah, which is closely tied with Hamas, has refused to stop retaliating against Israel unless it ceased attacking the Gaza Strip. Speaking at the UN General Assembly on Thursday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas urged the UN to take stronger action. \"This madness cannot continue. The entire world is responsible for what is happening to our people,\" he said. Mr Abbas called for a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, an end to attacks by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the delivery of humanitarian aid throughout Gaza and a full withdrawal of the Israeli military from the enclave. \"We refuse the establishment of buffer zones or taking any part from Gaza,\" he said. \"We will not allow a single centimetre of Gaza to be taken. \"The State of Palestine must shoulder its responsibilities in the Gaza Strip and impose its full mandate on it and jurisdiction on it, including the border checkpoints, especially the Rafah international border.\" He said that the Palestinian Authority, which he leads, should have control over all Palestinian territories and that it would hold elections once the war is over. Israel's UN Ambassador Danny Danon responded to Mr Abbas's speech in a statement, accusing him of only talking about a peaceful solution when he is at the United Nations and failing to condemn the October 7 attack by Hamas militants that triggered the war in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. The US, Qatar and Egypt have been trying unsuccessfully to broker a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas. Washington still seeks ceasefire The White House said that discussions are continuing for a 21-day ceasefire and US and Israeli officials would hold talks in New York on Thursday. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was scheduled to meet with Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer. In London, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned there was a risk of all-out war in the Middle East, but a diplomatic solution was still possible. \"So let me be clear, Israel and Lebanon can choose a different path, despite the sharp escalation in recent days, a diplomatic solution is still viable,\" Mr Austin said.

    "text": "More than 600 people have been killed in Lebanon since Monday as Israel continues its bombardment, defying global ceasefire calls, including from its ally, the United States. The strikes have raised fears of a larger regional war, with escalating tension along the Israel-Lebanon border. On Thursday, an Israeli airstrike hit the outskirts of Beirut, killing two people and injuring 15, including a critically wounded woman, Lebanon's health ministry reported. That brought the total death toll from overnight strikes to 28. The strike also killed Mohammad Surur, a senior commander of Hezbollah's air force unit, according to two security sources, Reauter reports. Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV broadcast images of smoke rising from a building near Hezbollah facilities, where civilians also live and work. Meanwhile, the Israeli army conducted exercises simulating a ground invasion as a possible next phase of the conflict. \"We are preparing shoulder to shoulder with Northern Command for a ground maneuver. Prepared, if activated. This is a decision to be made above us,\" Israeli Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar said in a video shared by the military. In the U.S., Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, addressing the U.N. General Assembly, said Israel would continue to strike Hezbollah with \"full force and we will not stop until we achieve all our goals.\" Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, whose government includes Hezbollah elements, had hoped for a ceasefire, but Israel's stance dashed those expectations. Aid organisations in Lebanon are scrambling to provide relief as hundreds of thousands have fled their homes. The U.S., France, and other allies have pushed for a 21-day ceasefire along the Israel-Lebanon border, while Israeli forces continue to target Hezbollah positions and arms transfers from Syria.",

    "text": "Air strikes and artillery fire shook Khartoum on Thursday September 26, where the army is engaged in “fierce fighting” against the paramilitary forces which largely control the Sudanese capital, according to witnesses and a military source. The day before these fights, the Secretary General of the UN, Antonio Guterres, expressed his “deep concern” concerning “climbing” of the conflict which since April 2023 has opposed the army, led by General Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Al-Bourhane, and the Rapid Support Forces (FSR) of his former deputy, General Mohammed Hamdan Daglo.

The army delivers “fierce fighting” in Khartoum, a source within it told Agence [France](/tag/France)-Presse (AFP). The source, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said army forces had crossed two key bridges over the Nile, which separate the army-held parts of the capital. of those controlled by the FSR. Since the start of the war, the paramilitaries have pushed the army almost out of the entire city. But following its last major offensive, in February, the army recaptured a large part of Omdurman, a city adjacent to the capital and integrated into its metropolitan area. Several residents of Omdurman reported “intense artillery fire” which began early Thursday, including on residential buildings, while military planes flew over the city. From 20,000 to 150,000 deaths Since the start of the war, the most violent fighting has taken place in densely populated areas. Both sides have been accused of war crimes for deliberately targeting civilians and blocking humanitarian aid. The war has left tens of thousands dead, with estimates ranging from 20,000 to 150,000 killed, with most casualties going unrecorded, according to doctors. It has also displaced more than 10 million people, or a fifth of Sudan’s population, and created one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent memory, according to the United Nations. The attack on Khartoum comes as the RSF launched an offensive last weekend against El-Fasher, a large Darfur city of some 2 million inhabitants, which they have been besieging for months. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, warned Thursday about the “high risk” of ethnic violence if this town in the southwest of the country fell into the hands of the paramilitaries.

The two men also discussed “the need for an immediate and lasting ceasefire” and humanitarian access “unhindered”. On site, “the conditions are apocalyptic”declared the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi. The United States, the European Union, France and Germany have for their part called for an immediate ceasefire, worrying about foreign interference while the United Arab Emirates, in particular, are accused of providing weapons to the FSR.",

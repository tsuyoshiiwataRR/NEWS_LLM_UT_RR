    "text": "The nightmare of a widening war in the Middle East is coming true. The question is how widely and violently it will spread before fatigue, fear, or the scrambling efforts of outside diplomats grind the fighting to a halt.\nFor now, Israel is facing the prospect of its first three-front war since 1973 (this time, Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon)—and it is taking on the task not hesitantly, but with gusto.\nThe recently reignited front—against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon—poses the greatest threat to Israel. But escalating this long-simmering conflict into a full-scale war—as Israel is now doing—also poses the greatest risks, for not just Israel and Lebanon but the entire region.\nPresident Joe Biden and some European leaders have proposed a 21-day cease-fire for starters. But there’s little reason to believe they’ll be any more successful than they have been at stopping the war in Gaza over the past 11 months.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has responded to Biden’s proposal with his usual Janus face—nodding to Washington that he’s thinking about it seriously while assuring the far-right members in his ruling coalition that he won’t stop pounding Hezbollah sites for a moment. Meanwhile, Israeli troops have been mobilized for a possible invasion, which has been in the planning stages for quite a while.\nIsrael has reasons to mount its latest strikes in Lebanon—which began last week with the remote-control detonation of booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkies held by thousands of Hezbollah fighters, then continued with massive airstrikes on Hezbollah positions. Hezbollah also has reasons to strike back, firing some of its rockets at Israeli cities as far south as Tel Aviv, which they’ve rarely fired at before.\nHezbollah, a Shiite organization, has been officially designated a “terrorist group” by many countries. It has come to dominate Lebanese politics (it is often called “a state within a state”). Its military wing has about 50,000 armed fighters and an arsenal that includes more than 100,000 rockets. The Israeli military says many of them are hidden in people’s houses and in an elaborate network of tunnels.\nThere have been sporadic exchanges of rocket fire for many years. In 2006, the U.N. Security Council ordered Hezbollah to disarm south of the Litani River, which flows 10 miles north of the Lebanon–Israel border, but the group ignored the resolution and kept up the occasional rocket attacks. Their volume and frequency have intensified since the war in Gaza started a year ago, to the point where 65,000 Israelis in the northern part of the country have been compelled to evacuate their homes.\nAt some point, not just Netanyahu but many Israelis decided it was time to turn up their own volume of attacks and end Hezbollah’s threat altogether. An especially vocal advocate has been Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who has been sharply at odds with the prime minister on some of his policies in Gaza, to the point where he may soon be fired.\nFrom Hezbollah’s vantage, Israel’s attacks of the past week have been devastating, wiping out the Islamist group’s communications network, killing dozens and injuring hundreds or maybe thousands of its senior fighters, and utterly embarrassing its leadership—exposing the entire organization’s inability to thwart Israel’s dominance or protect Lebanon’s population.\nThe question is what Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary-general of Hezbollah, will do about this quandary. In 2006, Israel pummeled south Lebanon with airstrikes for 34 days after Hezbollah militants kidnapped three Israeli soldiers who had crossed the border. At the time, Nasrallah publicly said that if he’d known Israel would have responded so forcefully, he would never have approved the operation. In other words, Nasrallah is, relatively, a pragmatist. However, he is also the leader of a vast movement that cannot afford to be viewed as weak.\nThere is a wider matter: Hezbollah is, in some ways, the strongest spoke in Iran’s network of proxies in the region—the self-described “axis of resistance,” which also includes Hamas, the Houthis, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other militias. And while the Iranian leaders clearly do not want a wider war with Israel, and certainly not with the United States (which would probably be drawn into a direct war with Israel), they also can’t afford to be viewed as unreliable protectors, either by their allies or their foes.\nThese assorted dilemmas are clear to all the players involved, not least the United States. Hence Biden’s rushed effort to put a cease-fire proposal on the table and get some negotiations going.\nOne problem among many is that Netanyahu and other Israelis think they have an opportunity here not just to discombobulate Hezbollah’s command structure and kill or injure many of its military leaders, but also to destroy the organization as a threat. He has referred to the campaign’s strategy as a “victory doctrine”—just as he has declared “total victory” as his goal in Gaza.\nFrom a tactical perspective, he has some reason to believe this. A story this week in the Financial Times reports that on the eve of the 2006 war, Israeli intelligence had produced a vetted list of only several dozen Hezbollah targets, mainly the soldiers and support gear engaged in the fighting. Now, after “years of deep intelligence and careful research,” Israel knows the precise location and functioning of “thousands” of targets, including a vast military infrastructure that Hezbollah has been building for the past 20 years.\nDuring 2006, the Israeli air force hit about 200 targets a day, many of them redundantly. Just on Monday of this week, it hit 1,600 targets. There are many more not yet hit.\nMany of these targets—including those already bombed—are scattered all across Lebanon, not just in Hezbollah’s southern stronghold. Even if all the targets are military in nature, and even if Israel’s airstrikes are precisely aimed, many civilians are certain to be killed and injured. How many is impossible to say. As in Gaza, Lebanon’s health ministry does not distinguish between civilian and military casualties. The pager bombs last week reportedly injured 2,800 people. It is unknown how many were Hezbollah fighters—probably most of them, as the devices were packed with one-tenth of an ounce of explosives. The bombs dropped by Israeli jets in the subsequent days, even “small” bombs, explode with much greater force.\nIsrael hopes to finish the operation quickly, before the civilian damage arouses much opposition. But many outside leaders and diplomats, very much including Biden and his team, hope to bring about a cease-fire before the damage—civilian and otherwise—compels Hezbollah or, worse still, Iran to retaliate with enormous firepower.\nAccording to the Financial Times, Hezbollah could fire 3,000 rockets and missiles a day, if its commanders wanted (and if Iran unleashed them to do so). Their relatively limited counterstrikes this week, which hit targets (mostly military) in Haifa and Tel Aviv, showed they have the ability to inflict devastating damage on Israel. At what point will someone in Hezbollah’s upper ranks see Israel’s airstrikes as a final straw and retaliate in kind? If someone does, Israel could respond by flattening much of Lebanon. Theoretically, that prospect should deter Hezbollah’s extravagance—but, in real life, will it? Nation-states have sleepwalked into war against their better judgments, and the same could be true of states within states.\nThere may have been moments when the war on the northern front might have been settled diplomatically. Not long ago, Hezbollah said they would stop pounding Israel with rockets if Israel signed a cease-fire deal with Hamas. Yet both Israel and Hamas were obstructing such a deal, so the offer wasn’t taken seriously.\nMeanwhile, even if Netanyahu were inclined to call a cease-fire on the northern border, his thirst for power might dissuade him. Itamar Ben-Gvir, his minister of national security and the leader of one of the far-right-wing parties that comprise Netanyahu’s ruling coalition, has announced that he would resign if the prime minister agreed to a cease-fire. Netanyahu’s coalition rules Parliament by a very slender majority. If Ben-Gvir pulled out his party, the majority would collapse; new elections would be held, and Netanyahu could well lose. (In a speech several months ago, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, who is ardently pro-Israel, wished for new elections precisely because Netanyahu was too beholden to far-right-wingers, making any kind of peace impossible.)\nOne other fact is troubling many outside diplomats, who wish that it would trouble Netanyahu more: If Israeli troops actually invade Lebanon, their troubles won’t necessarily be over. In 1982, Prime Minister Menachem Begin ordered troops into southern Lebanon to expel Yasir Arafat’s Palestinian Liberation Organization, which was wreaking havoc at the time. The operation tactically succeeded, but the Israelis wound up staying there, in a turbulent occupation, for 18 years. More troubling still, Hezbollah rose to power in the vacuum left by Arafat.\nA plethora of pressures keep the Middle East’s war machines grinding on—in Israel, Gaza, Lebanon, and elsewhere. Peace requires diplomats to halt the machines’ many moving parts all at once. It is very difficult.",

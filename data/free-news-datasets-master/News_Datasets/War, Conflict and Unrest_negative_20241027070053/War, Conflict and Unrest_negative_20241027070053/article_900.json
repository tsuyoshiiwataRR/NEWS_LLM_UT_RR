    "text": "Manchester Piccadilly station Wi-Fi firm issues statement after users targeted with terrorism message\nFrom the London Evening Standard and the Manchester Evening News\nHacking somebody else’s wifi is obviously wrong. An offence under all sorts of electronic and communication legislation. Probably old school criminal or malicious damage as well. But presenting factual, historical MSM news reports is NOT Islamophobia. And the police and establishment do themselves no favours screaming that.\nA man has been arrested after London’s biggest train stations had their Wi-Fi networks hacked by a cyber-attack displaying Islamophobic messages, police said.\nOfficers are investigating after the attack on internet services at 19 stations across the UK managed by the Network Rail.\nOn Thursday evening, the British Transport Police said a male employee of Global Reach, the company that provides wifi services to Network Rail, had been arrested on suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and the Malicious Communications Act 1988. I said there would be something involving communications and malice.\nA spokesperson (of BTP) said: “Officers received reports just after 5pm yesterday of a breach of some Network Rail wifi services at railway stations which were displaying Islamophobic messaging. The abuse of access was restricted to the defacement of the splash pages, and no personal data is known to have been affected.”\nPeople logging onto the Wi-Fi saw a webpage containing details of terrorist incidents in the UK and abroad.\nPiccadilly was one of 20 stations where the internet service was targeted in the “‘cyber security incident” last night (Wednesday). Other stations targeted by the hack include Birmingham New Street, Glasgow Central, Leeds City, Liverpool Lime Street, Bristol Temple Meads, Edinburgh Waverley, Reading, and Guildford.\nIn a statement issued to the Manchester Evening News , Telent said: “We are aware of the cyber security incident affecting the public Wi-Fi at Network Rail’s managed stations and are investigating with Network Rail and other stakeholders. “We have been informed there is an ongoing investigation by the British Transport Police into this incident, so it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage.”\nThe MEN have published a censored copy of the offending message.\nTh is is what it actually looked like.\nThe BBC news report on the Manchester Arena jihad murders of 2015 followed by a report of the 2005 London transport jihad murders.\nRepeating MSM factual news is NOT Islamophobia.\nIf the truth hurts, wailing about hurt feelings won’t change a thing.",

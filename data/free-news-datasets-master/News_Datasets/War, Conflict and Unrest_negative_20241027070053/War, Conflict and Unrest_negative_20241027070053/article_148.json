    "text": "Erik ten Hag slammed his Manchester United flops after a costly mistake from Christian Eriksen condemned them to a 1-1 draw against Dutch side Twente in their Europa League opener.\nEriksen's 35th-minute blast put United ahead, but the Danish midfielder gifted Twente their second-half equalizer at Old Trafford. Sam Lammers dispossessed Eriksen, who had made a risky turn under pressure, and fired past Andre Onana in the 68th minute.\nUnited manager Ten Hag refused to single out Eriksen, insisting that the whole team take responsibility for their failure to maintain the lead.\n\"We kept them alive, 1-0 up, controlling the game you have to be consistent and keep going. In the second half we dropped the level, gave the goal away,\" Ten Hag said. \"We didn't finish it off ... so they stay alive and we get punished with a mistake from ourselves.\"\nThe disappointment came hot on the heels of their goalless draw at Crystal Palace on Saturday.\nEriksen questioned whether United played with enough desire after their poor run in European competitions extended to one win in nine games.\n\"Mostly disappointed as a team,\" Eriksen said. \"They looked like they wanted it more, that can't be right.\n\"We don't lose but it feels like a loss.\"\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE",

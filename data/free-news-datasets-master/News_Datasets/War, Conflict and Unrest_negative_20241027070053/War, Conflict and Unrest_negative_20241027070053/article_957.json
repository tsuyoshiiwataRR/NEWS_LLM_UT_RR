    "text": "Zourabichvili on “Georgian Dream” banners\nPresident of Georgia Salome Zourabichvili called the new campaign banners from the ruling party “Georgian Dream,” which depict war-torn cities in Ukraine , “shameful.”\n\"Georgia’s president doesn’t believe in good relations between the parties.\" Expert commentary Zourabichvili highlighted the need for a “technocratic government,” which should be formed in agreement with political parties, rather than appointed politicians.\n“Georgian Dream” used images of bombed Ukrainian cities on their campaign banners to intimidate voters.\nThe banners feature pictures of a destroyed church, a theater in Mariupol, and more, accompanied by the phrase “No to war.” In contrast, various locations in Georgia are shown with the message “I chose peace.” The banners also cross out the electoral numbers of four major opposition parties, suggesting that “Georgian Dream” wants to convince voters that they would lead the country into war.\nThe banners have been placed in several locations around Tbilisi.\n“ I have never seen anything so disgraceful, so offensive to our culture, traditions, history, and faith… Where are you? What a pathetic act to present a poster created in the KGB’s forge to your people, showing such a lack of dignity and shame! ” Salome Zourabichvili wrote on Facebook.\n“Georgian Dream” also released a campaign video featuring images of war-torn Ukrainian cities.",

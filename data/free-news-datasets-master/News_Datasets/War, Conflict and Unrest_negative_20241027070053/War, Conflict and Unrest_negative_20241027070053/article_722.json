    "text": "Israel Defies Global Calls for Ceasefire Amid Heightened Regional Tensions Israel has rejected global calls for a ceasefire with Hezbollah, continuing strikes in Lebanon and raising fears of regional conflict. The U.S. and France pursue a 21-day truce proposal. Israeli attacks have intensified, resulting in significant casualties. Lebanese civilians and Hezbollah targets have been heavily affected. Israel has dismissed international appeals for a ceasefire with Hezbollah, opting instead to continue its airstrikes in Lebanon, which have resulted in hundreds of casualties. This move defies its chief ally, the United States, and has escalated fears of a broader regional conflict. While Israel remains adamant, the U.S. and France are pushing for a 21-day truce, with ongoing negotiations happening alongside the United Nations meeting in New York. Recent Israeli strikes have targeted the outskirts of Beirut, killing several and injuring many, including high-profile Hezbollah leaders. On the ground, the Israeli army is preparing for a potential invasion, a significant uptick in an already brutal campaign. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue military action until all objectives are met, despite international pressure for a ceasefire.

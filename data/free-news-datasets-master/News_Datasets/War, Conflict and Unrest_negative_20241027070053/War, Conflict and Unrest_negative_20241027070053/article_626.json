    "text": "Israel shells villages in Southern Lebanon- the photo taken from Palestinian journalists' Telegram channels CAIRO – 26 September 2024: Regarding the escalating Israeli aggression in Lebanon, particularly in Beirut, and the ongoing violence against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, Egypt warned that these actions threaten to plunge the Middle East into confrontation and chaos, exposing its peoples to severe and uncontrollable consequences. Egypt is committed to engaging with regional and international parties to address this dangerous escalation, said the Egyptian Foreign Ministry in a statement on Thursday. It called for an immediate, comprehensive, and permanent ceasefire in both Gaza and Lebanon, the statement added. Additionally, Egypt supports all initiatives and arrangements aimed at achieving lasting peace in the region. It emphasizes that true calm hinges on halting the brutal Israeli aggression in Gaza and implementing relevant Security Council resolutions. A bloc of 12 nations is pressing for a three-week ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, following a surge in Israeli airstrikes this week that have killed over 620 individuals, including women and children. The initiative, supported by the United States and France, is also endorsed by the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Australia, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Canada, and Japan. A joint statement issued by the bloc emphasized that the situation between Lebanon and Israel since October 8, 2023, has become “intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation.” “This is in nobody’s interest, neither of the people of Israel nor of the people of Lebanon.” Over the past two days of the military escalation on Lebanon, 15,600 Syrians and 16,130 Lebanese people moved from Lebanon to Syria. Also, the Lebanese Emergency Authority announced on Thursday that the death toll of the Lebanese people since the expansion of the conflict by Israel on Lebanon rose to 1,540 people while the injured people reached to 5,410. As for what the war on Gaz, Israel continued its shelling on the Palestinian civilians. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza announced on Thursday that Israel has killed 41,534 people and injured 96,092 others in Gaza since October 7, 2023. Comments Leave a Comment",

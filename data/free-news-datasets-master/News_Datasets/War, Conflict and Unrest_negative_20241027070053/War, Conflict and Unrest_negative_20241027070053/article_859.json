    "text": "Taiz Today, Thursday, September 26 was the 62nd anniversary of the Yemeni revolution, amid a sharp political divide that left a marked difference in the celebration of such a national occasion, in a country torn apart by war. About 10 years.\nThe September 26, 1962 revolution began against the Imamate regime that had ruled northern Yemen for decades, while the south of the country was under British colonial control.\nA few days ago, the anniversary of the revolution began to be celebrated, amid great momentum in areas controlled by the Yemeni government, as opposed to areas under the control of the Houthis, which have witnessed an intense security deployment, denying any. Gathering to celebrate this occasion. The group faced human rights and government charges for arresting activists calling for revolution anniversary celebrations.\nthrough his account\nInstead, a member of the Houthis’ Supreme Political Council, Muhammad Ali al-Houthi, responded to the accusations by challenging the Yemeni government to celebrate the event in the city of Aden, which is controlled by the Southern Transitional Council, which claims to separate the country’s south from the north.\n● The rise of the terrorist Houthi militia linked to Iran, the kidnapping campaign that has targeted hundreds of sheikhs, academics, politicians, media personalities, journalists and activists active on social media sites over the past few days to force its control, is an attempt to terrorize citizens and prevent preparedness.. . pic.twitter.com/qUpLd82yF1\n– Muammar Al-Eryani (@ERYANIM) September 23, 2024\nCelebration as a political message The division in geographic and military control between the Yemeni government, Houthi groups and the Southern Transitional Council has made it difficult to find unity of position on many issues, including national events.\nIn this regard, political analyst Abdul Wase’ Al-Fataki said in a statement to Al Jazeera Net, “This year the twenty-sixth revolution witnessed a great division among Yemenis on its anniversary and the difference of views between those who support the celebration. This revolution and those who oppose it. The geography between Yemeni lands and territories results in one controlled by an internationally recognized government and the other under the control of the Houthis.”\nAl-Fateqi noted that the growing celebrations in government-controlled areas “are a clear political message that what the Houthi group wants will not be achieved, and there are popular masses who reject it and what it wants to impose on Yemenis. Its political ideology or Orientation.”\nOn the other hand, the political analyst noted that “the Houthi group believes that celebrating the revolution in their region is considered a message of support for the internationally recognized government and also represents a message of rejection, especially since it has expressed several times its political doctrine based on the theory of the return of the Imamate, And worked to arrest… “Areas under its control are those who raise slogans celebrating the September 26 revolution, whether in person or on social media.”\nHowever, according to Al-Fateqi, there is a sector of Yemenis who believe that the importance at this stage must be to end the war, because it has taken a lot from Yemen at all political, economic and social levels and “it is time for the war to end, for the gunshots to stop.” And let the voice of peace grow louder.”\nInstead, Ahmed Naji, a researcher at the International Crisis Group, said in a statement to Al Jazeera Net, there has been a shift in the way Yemenis deal with the September 26 anniversary of the revolution in two parts:\nThe first is represented by the nostalgia of the past among many people, especially since the country is divided militarily and politically, and in a state of chaos and economic collapse, the revolution of September 26 is a moment of establishment for a large group of ideas of justice, equality, republic and change, which all these divisions A return to a state that refuses and the dire situation the country is facing. The second is that many people see the Houthis as coming to reject the idea of ​​a republican system, a kind of rejection of this trend and the revolution that has become iconic to many who reject Houthi rule. , and therefore the celebration of the revolution is accompanied by a very large attack on the group because it is contrary to this trend. Naji continued that areas that have witnessed clashes with the Houthis have witnessed very big celebrations and great momentum, such as in the governorates of Taiz and Marib, while in areas where there is no direct conflict with the Houthis, we have not witnessed them. According to the same speaker, this does not mean that they are supporters of the Houthis, but that this great involvement with the revolution of September 26 has stimulated.\nCelebration video #Taiz After the Yemeni revolution. #Yemen pic.twitter.com/W6SfxPaqo2\n— Maher Alabsi (@maheralabssi) September 26, 2024\nfind peace In this context, Dr. Abdul Qadir Al-Khali, professor of political analysis at Taiz University (one of Yemen’s largest universities), believes that this year has not seen revolution celebrations in areas controlled by the Houthi group. Because of group resistance in celebrating it, or because of economic and social conditions, many citizens are too busy searching for livelihood and securing their livelihood to celebrate this revolution.\nThe Yemeni academic added to Al Jazeera Net, “Many citizens are fed up with 10 years of division, and they see the need to come to a peaceful solution that leads to coexistence, removes all problems and dilemmas and restores the unity of Yemen. Geography and the Yemeni family.”\nHe continued, “Yemenis want a solution that will return their country to its normal path and unite Yemenis. This does not mean that they do not love the revolution or its principles, but they do not favor a return to the Imamate. The system or dividing Yemen which is Before Yemeni unity.”\nAl-Khali noted that “some Yemenis are beginning to fear for themselves that they will be subjected to repression, imprisonment or violations of their honor by political groups. They are turning towards peace and looking for a road map that leads to this direction. All members of society peaceful coexistence between.”\nCelebrating the September Revolution with this speed, this amount and this challenge, even from the areas occupied by the priests, despite the arrests, military crowds in the streets and squares, threats and intimidation, is the most popular referendum. Reject this group and so they must realize that there is no place for them in Yemen and they must leave. pic.twitter.com/sHS0uCma1R\n– Afashi and I have a history with Al-Iz (@FTarykh). September 25, 2024\nPreoccupation with livelihood Speaking to Al Jazeera Net, Hail Al-Ahmadi, a citizen living in Taiz Governorate, said that the wounds of war made him feel like seeking peace, indicating that he refrained from celebrating national revolutions as a result of their consumption. In the legitimate government and the political project of the Houthis, as he says.\nThe 50-year-old, who works as a daily wage earner and supports 10 people, added, “We long for peace and the establishment of a united Yemeni state where we can get the necessities of life for our families. We reject the parties to the conflict. All obstacles created by, and their efforts to undermine the gains of, the free revolutionaries and exploit their revolution politically.”\nIn his conversation with Al Jazeera Net, citizen Abdullah Al-Sabri believes that providing citizens with the basic necessities of life is the greatest national celebration for the majority of the population.\nAl-Sabri (60 years old) added, riding his motorcycle in the center of Taiz Thursday morning, dozens of meters from a large gathering celebrating the anniversary of the September 26 revolution, “The whole reality is the high price… We cannot provide the minimum necessities of life. … I don’t care about celebrating the Revolution, I’m neither for nor against it.”",

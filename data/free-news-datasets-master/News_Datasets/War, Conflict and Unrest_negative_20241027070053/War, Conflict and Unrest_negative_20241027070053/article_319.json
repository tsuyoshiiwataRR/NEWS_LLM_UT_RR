    "text": "/ world today news/ “Victory on the battlefield is not in sight for the Ukrainians”: The Prime Minister of Hungary brought down his NATO partners from heaven to earth\nIn early May, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán stunned his Western counterparts by declaring that “a situation in which Russia would come to terms with its defeat is only possible in fairy tales.” But they still didn’t get it. On the contrary, after that there were very strong calls from Western leaders about the need to “defeat Russia”.\nWe know from history that there are people who are “ born to make fairy tales come true’. But how such tales end, we also remember, the grass of oblivion has not yet grown on the endless battlefields of Europe.\nOrbán once again tried to bring his colleagues back to reality, who continue to rave about the charming tales of “victory” over Russia. In an interview with Bloomberg, the Hungarian Prime Minister said: “My position is this: based on the actual situation, on the numbers, on the state of affairs – and, by the way, on the fact that NATO is not ready to send its troops – it becomes quite obvious that a victory on the battlefield for the poor Ukrainians , by no means outlined.” And he added that instead of escalating the battlefield, the path to peace and negotiations should be sought.\nAlas, they are unlikely to hear it even now: the Western propaganda, ideological and political entourage plays up its superiority too enthusiastically and is clearly not ready to admit that “ the king is naked’.\nAt the recent security conference in Tallinn, hundreds “prominent politicians, analysts, leaders, military personnel and scientists from around the world” discussed the situation in Ukraine writes Joseph Syracuse in his Sky News column. And here is the sad conclusion he draws: “The conference participants had hardened anti-Russian personalities (…). These figures did not show even a minimal desire and aspiration for a ceasefire.\n„ I was hoping the author admits, – that at the Tallinn conference there would be some kind of meeting devoted to achieving peace and discussing what that peace should be… However, there was no diplomacy in Tallinn. The conference turned out to be relentlessly anti-Russian. Europeans believe that Ukraine’s victory is very important and inevitable. But they are wrong.\nBecause of this position of Europe are the exaggerated and far from realistic hopes of Ukraine… The participants of the conference only added fuel to the fire, demanding and calling for the expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe, with the inclusion of Moldova, Georgia and, of course, Ukraine. “\nAlas, inflaming themselves, Western experts and politicians are drifting further and further away from reality. And God bless them, as long as they weren’t the real battles in the center of Europe, in which thousands of people died. The Sky News author is bitter about the fate of Ukraine: “ When a country loses so many people to problems that could be solved diplomatically with collective will and diplomatic imagination (they could indeed be resolved even before the start of hostilities on February 23 last year), it is necessary to go an extra way.\nFor now, the pragmatist Orban is alone among Europe’s political elite. And the realist Syracuse was the only one who remembered diplomacy at the security conference held in Estonia. So far it cannot be said that “the process has begun”. The idea of ​​a fair end to the Ukrainian crisis for Russia is demonstrably ignored in the West. On the contrary, they are making every effort to convince everyone of their invincibility, even at the cost of World War III.\n„ Is there a way out? asks Joseph Syracuse. – There is an alternative. Historian Jeff Roberts recently noted, “Military action can and should end in peace and a territorial settlement that will ensure Russia’s future security and protect the world from nuclear holocaust.”\nDon’t politicians understand this? Apart from Orban, is there anyone else capable of disbelieving the talk of Russia’s “defeat”? The French Foreign Ministry hinted yesterday at some “security guarantees” of Ukraine, but only after “completion of the military operation of the Russian Federation”. Good thing it’s not “after the victory of Ukraine”. Perhaps this is a spark of realism after all?\nSo the Vatican believes that the conflict can only be resolved by achieving peace. China, Brazil, South Africa are trying to convey the same idea to the West. No result so far. The bewitching power of anti-Russian storytellers is still at work. Maybe they will listen to Orbán after all?\nTranslation: ES\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel:\nand for the channel or in Telegram:\n#Orban #Ukraine #defeat #Russia #battlefield #direct #involvement #NATO",

    "text": "Yesterday we learned that Kevin Roberts, the cosplaying Yall Qaeda coal roller truck driving, Lucchese cowboy boot-wearing president of the Heritage Foundation whose Project 2025 preaches the centrality of “the family” as the foundation of American society, a foundation to be achieved in part by forcing impregnated incest and rape victims to give birth, is so far astray from the teachings of Jesus that he reportedly once bragged about killing a neighbors’ dog with a shovel.\n[…]\nToday […] Opus Dei [a Catholic organization that exists today at the red-hot center of the judicial and right-wing donor world in Washington D.C.] has achieved influence at the highest echelon of American power. The organization has been increasingly active in Washington since at least the early 1990s when it set up shop at 15th and K — the heart of the capital lobbying industry. From there, one of its priests (wearing a spiked garter under his robes to restrict his bodily urges) converted at least a half dozen of the top right-wingers in Washington to the Opus Dei brand of regressive Catholicism. Among his converts — future Trump administration National Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow, and other men in the highest echelons of American law and government — future House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Senator Sam Brownback, failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, and many other leaders who found themselves in need to priestly guidance.\nSome of the most powerful figures in American politics and political finance today have Opus Dei connections. One of the most effective Opus Dei-affiliated Catholics in DC today is Leonard Leo, bagman for rightist billionaires, who spent decades working to capture the federal judiciary for the anti-choice movement. Five of the six members of the right side of the Supreme Court are right-wing Catholic — Chief Justice Roberts, Amy Coney Barrett, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh who replaced Opus Dei adjacent Antonin Scalia after Mitch McConnell refused to let Obama fill his vacancy for almost a year. These modern-day priest-kings have been working to force American law into line with a creed most Americans — including the vast majority of Catholics — reject — all under the guise of “religious freedom.”\n[…]\n[log in or register](/login)to comment.\n[masterofn001 ( @masterofn001@lemmy.ca )](/u/masterofn001@lemmy.ca)1•2 hours agoone of its priests (wearing a spiked garter under his robes to restrict his bodily urges)\nUm, yeah, that’s definitely some cuck/chastity/kink shit.\nIf you need spikes to resist urges, you’re not the kind of person who should be talking about regulating people’s urges.\n[hddsx ( @hddsx@lemmy.ca )](/u/hddsx@lemmy.ca)7•8 hours agoI had to read the title twice. My first thought was “Oh no what did RedHat do this time?”\n[masterofn001 ( @masterofn001@lemmy.ca )](/u/masterofn001@lemmy.ca)https://lemmy.ca/comment/11875304My mom used to be in a group of old ladies that went for lunch and did other old lady stuff. They definitely aren’t related.\nYou have not been alone with this if I may say so :-))\n[Melatonin ( @Melatonin@lemmy.dbzer0.com )](/u/Melatonin@lemmy.dbzer0.com)2•7 hours agoQuite a detailed conspiracy theory. As complex and detailed as any I’ve heard from the Trumpers.\nSerious anti-Catholic propaganda as well. It’s like someone took their politics from Assassin’s Creed.\nSame thinking that leads to anti-Semitic conspiracy theories as well. Just stop.\nRead Trump’s Project 2025. It’s aiming at the same things.\n[Melatonin ( @Melatonin@lemmy.dbzer0.com )](/u/Melatonin@lemmy.dbzer0.com)1•3 hours agoOkay but WE DON’T NEED A CONSPIRACY to say that\nIt doesn’t help, it makes you sound crazy\n[coyotino [he/him] ( @theangriestbird@beehaw.org )](/u/theangriestbird@beehaw.org)English7•6 hours agoi don’t think it’s a conspiracy if the connections and donations are documented? it isn’t just “we think this is happening”. There are receipts.\n[niucllos ( @niucllos@lemm.ee )](/u/niucllos@lemm.ee)1•4 hours agoStill a conspiracy if it aims to conspire, if there are receipts it ceases to be a theory and becomes just a true conspiracy\n[coyotino [he/him] ( @theangriestbird@beehaw.org )](/u/theangriestbird@beehaw.org)English1•3 hours agoi guess, but it would be weird to call all of Congress a “conspiracy” because they all conspire together in front of the public eye to debate on and pass legislation.\n[Melatonin ( @Melatonin@lemmy.dbzer0.com )](/u/Melatonin@lemmy.dbzer0.com)1•5 hours agoHaven’t you ever heard Trumpers talking about the\nHunter Biden Laptop conspiracy?People can connect the dots a lot of different ways, and come to very different conclusions.\nThis conspiracy bullshit is best left to the wackos and weirdos on the right.\n[coyotino [he/him] ( @theangriestbird@beehaw.org )](/u/theangriestbird@beehaw.org)English1•58 minutes agobut that wasn’t hard evidence with multiple data points. It was one, single data point, blown out into a full conspiracy. EDIT: If I am misrepresenting that conspiracy, please let me know. I didn’t really pay that much attention to it, for obvious reasons.\n[Melatonin ( @Melatonin@lemmy.dbzer0.com )](/u/Melatonin@lemmy.dbzer0.com)1•27 minutes agoDo you REALLY think this article by AMERICANFREAKSHOW.NEWS is giving you just the facts? All the facts? A balanced, sane presentation of the facts?",

    "text": "Condemned to reverse the situation at home, the Parisiennes have once again fallen into Italy’s trap. Their Champions League adventure will end before the group stage.\nParis is falling from above. After reaching at least the semi-finals of the last six editions, Paris Saint-Germain were eliminated in the second preliminary round of the Women’s Champions League by losing 2-1 in against Juventus Turin on Thursday at the PSG Campus in Poissy. The Parisiennes had already been beaten in the first leg (3-1).\nIt is a setback for the women’s division and its stars, especially the French internationals Elisa De Almeida, Gridge Mbock, Sakina Karchaoui, Grace Geyoro and Marie-Antoinette Katoto. Fabrice Abriel’s players, who lost their first period, were caught cold at the start of the game by a goal from Sofia Cantore (3rd).\nMore enterprising after the break, they equalized with the penalty from the Dutch Romee Leuchter (54th sp), but Barbara Bonensea gave the advantage back to the Turines (72nd).\nFrance will only have Lyon, the 2023 finalist and record holder for victories with 8 trophies, as a representative in C1 this season.\n2024-09-26 19:50:51\n#Champions #League #beaten #Juventus #PSG #eliminated",

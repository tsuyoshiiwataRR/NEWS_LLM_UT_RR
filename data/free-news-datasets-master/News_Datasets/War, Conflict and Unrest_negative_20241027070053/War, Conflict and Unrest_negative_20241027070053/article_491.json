    "text": "Former President Trump made a statement to the media at Trump Tower in Manhattan Thursday afternoon, covering a wide swath of topics, including the incompetence of his opponent, Democrat presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who is scheduled to visit the U.S.-Mexico border while on the campaign trail on Friday. ðŸš¨President Trump to Deliver Press Remarks at Trump Tower at 4:30PM ET â€” Karoline Leavitt (@kleavittnh)[pic.twitter.com/Ab2Oa8ncOJ][September 26, 2024] He began his remarks on the Harris border crisis, which he called \"the worst border crisis in the history of the world,\" questioning why she would go to the border (e.g. such a gift to her political opponent's campaign): PRESIDENT TRUMP: For nearly 4 years, we have been living through the worst border crisis in the history of the worldâ€”which has brought untold suffering, misery, and death upon our land. â€” Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) The architect of this destruction is KAMALA HARRIS.[pic.twitter.com/ZkcrehkTN5][September 26, 2024] Calling VP Harris \"a radical Left person,\" Trump ridiculed her previous \"visit\" to the border as \"very mild and no danger.\" She was nowhere near the actual border areas. Trump half-jokingly said he should have called his remarks on Thursday his \"Why Didn't She Do It?\" speech. As in, why hasn't she done any of the things she's trying to promise people she will do, when she has been in office for almost four years in the Biden administration? Trump speculated on possible reasons they have left the border unprotected. The first reason, he said, is Incompetence; the second reason, is \"They want it for the votes.\" He said that he didn't need to tell people the third reason, and that people could guess. He also spoke about the second presidential debate, which Trump took part in against Harris on ABC News, and being improperly corrected by co-moderator David Muir. In what might be breaking news, Trump asserted that his campaign had a deal in advance with the producers of the debate that no fact-checking would happen. He said, \"They violated the deal. Why? They're bad people and they're fake news.\" Read related: [ABC Whistleblower Says Harris Camp Allegedly 'Restricted the Scope' of Trump Debate Questions](https://redstate.com/beccalower/2024/09/15/breaking-abc-whistleblower-says-harris-campaign-allegedly-restricted-the-scope-of-debate-questions-n2179354) Then Trump shared some crime numbers in NYC on illegal aliens, and in Albany, NY, about a woman being brutally raped, then spoke about other horrors allegedly committed across the country--many thousands of miles from the Southern border: PRESIDENT TRUMP: \"Here in New York City, an estimated 75 percent of arrests in Midtown Manhattan and over 60 percent of arrests in Queens are now illegal aliens... It's going to STOP starting on January 20th.\" â€” Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom)[pic.twitter.com/nVhTwsvSgJ][September 26, 2024] PRESIDENT TRUMP: \"In Albany last May, an illegal alien who was caught and released by Kamala Harris, stalked and raped a 15-year-old girl, driving up behind her, abducting her by force with a metal pipe, and raping her again and again.\" â€” Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom)[pic.twitter.com/xEWxFRHA31][September 26, 2024] While admitting that \":there's nothing nice\" about the stories he's talking about, whether on the border, the economy, or any other issue made worse by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Trump pressed the issue once again, asking why Harris has not done what she says she wants to do if elected as president, in a look toward November's elections. Those were his exact words: \"Why hasn't she done it?\" PRESIDENT TRUMP: Despite all of this, Kamala Harris intends to stand before the American People tomorrow and LIE, pretending she wants a secure border. But if that were true, WHY HASNâ€™T SHE DONE IT? â€” Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom)[pic.twitter.com/JBD0iFFE6C][September 26, 2024] Just as he did during the debate, Trump swiftly destroyed her excuses on the border problem festering on her watch: PRESIDENT TRUMP: You will hear Kamala claim that the reason the border is not secure is that Congress has refused to pass her atrocious Border bill. But it was NOT a Border Billâ€”it was an AMNESTY Bill. â€” Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom)[pic.twitter.com/PzEjjHnOql][September 26, 2024] Staying on the general election topic, he said he reckons that his and Vance's campaign is \"up 21 points.\" Read related: [Gallup Drops Stunner of a Poll for Trump That Could be the Game Changer](https://redstate.com/nick-arama/2024/09/26/gallup-poll-is-not-good-for-kamala-n2179802) One of the money quotes from Trump also nailed the importance of conservatives getting out the vote, in fact: \"Without borders and without fair elections, we have no country,\" he said. Then, returning to immigration, he spoke about Americans being terrorized and hurt by illegal alien gangs in places like Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio: PRESIDENT TRUMP: Every state is now a border stateâ€”and Kamala Harris is the reason why. â€” Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) In Aurora, Colorado, Springfield, Ohio, and other towns just like them, Americans have watched their communities destroyed by a sudden and suffocating inundation of illegal aliens. Thisâ€¦[pic.twitter.com/PZ8XlXzahI][September 26, 2024] He ended by listing what he and Vance will do (some actions on Day 1) to end the border crisis: President Trump's plan to secure our border: â€” Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) - Stop all migrant flights - Shut down all entries through the migrant phone app - End catch-and-release - Restore Remain in Mexico - Bring back Title 42 - Send in federal law enforcement to liberate Aurora, Colorado - Send Congress aâ€¦[pic.twitter.com/mLOivhf4GL][September 26, 2024] As this is a developing story, keep an eye out for updates in these pages as they emerge.",

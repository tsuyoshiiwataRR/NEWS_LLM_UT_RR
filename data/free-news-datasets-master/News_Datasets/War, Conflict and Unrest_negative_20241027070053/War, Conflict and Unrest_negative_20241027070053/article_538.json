    "text": "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has documented the death of 22 Syrian refugees, including six children and seven women, amid the ongoing Israeli escalation in Lebanon which relentlessly targets civilians. The death toll of Syrian refugees over the last 72 hours has risen to 103, comprising 23 women and 32 children, according to the Observatory’s statement on its official website this Thursday morning. The Observatory noted that Syrian refugees, who fled the war in their homeland, now find themselves directly facing death under the Israeli airstrikes. The refugees are experiencing tragic conditions during this escalation, being forced to choose between staying in Lebanon under bombardment or returning to areas under regime control. The statement also highlighted the plight of refugees within Lebanon, who face significant challenges relocating from the bombarded south to safer areas amid rising living costs and rental prices. This exacerbates their suffering, leaving many homeless and seeking shelter in parks and streets. The Observatory urgently called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to protect civilians, including Syrian refugees, by providing safe passages from targeted areas and necessary support such as food, medicine, and shelter for affected families. It emphasized the need for immediate actions to halt this worsening humanitarian tragedy, noting that the death toll of Syrian martyrs in Lebanon has increased to 138, including 27 women and 37 children, with 21 others injured since the start of the Israeli war on Gaza. The recent conflict in Lebanon has intensified with significant Israeli military operations aimed at Hezbollah targets, resulting in substantial casualties and widespread displacement. The escalation follows Hezbollah’s response to an Israeli airstrike that killed a significant number of civilians and Hezbollah members. The conflict has led to a massive humanitarian crisis with tens of thousands of Lebanese fleeing their homes, amid calls from international bodies for both sides to respect international humanitarian law and cease hostilities.",

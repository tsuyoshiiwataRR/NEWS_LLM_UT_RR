    "text": "Countries including the UK and the US have called for a pause in the fighting in the Middle East which has got a lot worse over the past few weeks.\nThe fighting is between Israel and an armed political group based in Lebanon, a country which borders Israel to the north.\nMany people have died and the United Nations say more than 90 thousand people in Lebanon have been forced to leave their homes to escape the violence.\nThe UK government has called for British citizens to leave Lebanon, where the armed political group, called Hezbollah, are based.\nAdvice if you're upset by the news\nPublished 29 August 2022 Where is Lebanon?\nImage source, Getty Images Image caption, Aid workers move rubble from a strike in Lebanon's capital city, Beirut\nLebanon is a country in the Middle East. Its capital is Beirut.\nIt shares its borders with Syria and Israel, and sits on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe people who live there are mostly made up of different groups of Muslims and Christians.\nLebanon is also a place where many refugees have fled to, to escape war and conflict in their homes, including Syrians and Palestinians.\nHow is the fighting affecting children?\nImage source, Reuters BBC reporter Anna Foster is in Lebanon's capital, Beirut, where she found lots of families who've had to leave their homes because of the fighting.\nIt's still very hot there and many people have gone to one of Beirut's mosques to find safety and also somewhere cool to rest in the shade.\nShe says it's hard to find water and food at the moment and, although charities are there to help people, when aid arrives there's lots of families trying to get some.\nAnna also says it's really difficult for children in this situation as there's nothing to do - their toys or games have been left at home.\nIt's also a frightening time for them as they've had to leave their houses to find somewhere safe to stay while the conflict goes on.\nWhat are Hezbollah?\nImage source, Reuters Image caption, Internally displaced people, who fled from their southern Lebanon villages due to ongoing cross-border hostilities between Hezbollah and Israeli forces, ride on a pick up truck in Beiru\nHezbollah is a political party and armed group in Lebanon.\nAlthough it doesn’t run Lebanon, it’s become an important group in both the Lebanon parliament and the government. It controls some public services and also the most powerful armed force in the country, even though it is not part of the armed forces of Lebanon.\nIt’s been involved in periods of fighting with Israel for many decades.\nHezbollah is supported by Iran but other countries, including the UK, US and Israel, have made it a \"proscribed terrorist organisation\", which means that it has been decided by governments that it is a terrorist group.\nWhy are Israel and Hezbollah fighting now?\nImage source, Reuters Israel is another country in the Middle East, a neighbour to the south of Lebanon, which has a long history of conflict with Hezbollah.\nHezbollah are also supporters of Hamas – the armed political group in Gaza with whom Israel have been at war for nearly a year .\nHezbollah have attacked Israel a number of times since October 2023, in support of Hamas.\nHamas is also a proscribed terrorist organisation by the UK government.\nIn recent weeks Israel have carried out air strikes in Lebanon which they claim are targeting Hezbollah.\nHezbollah has responded by firing hundreds of rockets into northern Israel.\nMore than 70,000 people have been displaced by the fighting in northern Israel, while the United Nations report that more than 90,000 have been displaced in Lebanon.\nHassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, was killed in an air strike by Israel on Friday.\nWhat has the reaction been to the fighting?\nImage source, PA Media Image caption, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said British nationals in Lebanon should leave the country now\nSpeaking to the BBC on Wednesday, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said it's \"very important\" that British nationals in Lebanon should \"Leave now.”\nPresident of the US, Joe Biden, spoke to reporters on Wednesday, saying “it’s important the war does not widen\".\nMany other countries are also calling for a 21-day pause in the fighting for talks – also known as a ceasefire.\nA joint statement supporting a ceasefire was signed by the US, Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Qatar.\nThe Israeli government has since refused to agree to a ceasefire with Hezbollah or Hamas.\nThe Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Nethanyahu, says Israel’s army should keep fighting with “full force” against Hezbollah.\nMore on this story Advice if you're upset by the news\nPublished 29 August 2022",

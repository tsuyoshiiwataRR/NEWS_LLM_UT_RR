    "text": "China Wants Dominance in the Pacific - but Its Latest Attack Sub Has Sunk. They Are Trying to Cover Up. China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy has a lot of combatant ships, more in fact than the United States Navy, and that’s concerning. What they don’t have is much ability to project power; they lack at-sea replenishment capacity, and for the most part, their navy is a frigate navy. Nothing wrong with that, unless you’re going up against America’s carrier fleet.

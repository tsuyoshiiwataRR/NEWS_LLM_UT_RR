    "text": "By Audrey Gruaz Published on September 26, 2024 at 10:39 a.m. ; updated September 26, 2024 at 11:45 a.m. See my news Follow Le Pays Briard Barely two months after the floods of last August, Seine-et-[Marne](/tag/Marne) is once again experiencing a flood. Thursday September 26, 2024, a vigilance was triggered due to the rising waters of the Grand Morin River. As in August, it is the La Ferté-Gaucher sector and the surrounding municipalities which are suffering these floods. Heavy rain since Wednesday in Seine-et-Marne The heavy rains that fell on Seine-et-Marne on Wednesday September 25 quickly caused river levels to rise. “This rainy front is evacuating through the east of the region”, specify the Vigicrues services. If a lull is expected in the morning, “the return of a pattern of showers is to be considered in the afternoon. Thursday morning, residents noted that the Grand Morin has already largely emerged from its bedflooding certain streets, in La Ferté-Gaucher in particular. In this town, rue de Sézanne as well as Parc des Grenouilles are flooded. The greatest vigilance is required in the villages where the Grand Morin extends. The Grand Morin continues to rise It is in fact in this sector of Seine-et-Marne that the precipitation was the heaviest on Wednesday, causing the river to rapidly swell. “This increase continues this Thursday,” warn the authorities. Thursday morning, around 9 a.m., the Pommeuse station recorded a level of the Grand Morin at 2.42 meters and a flow rate of 49.4 m³/second. We are therefore very close to the flood level of December 2012. For the moment, “the situation on the other watercourses in the territory is under surveillance but does not generate any particular vigilance”.

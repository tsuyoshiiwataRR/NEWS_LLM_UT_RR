These include: Munzir Arika, Sani Dilla (Dan Hausawan Jubillaram), Ameer Modu, Matawal Bitrus, Thomas Benedict, Mohammed Sani, Rimamy (aka Omo), Terkimbi Injoko, Jacob Uzege, Ibn Kasir, Kachalla Ɗan Baleri, Kachallah Halilu Jimmare (Buzu), Kachalla Dan Ali Garin Fadama, Kachalla Dan Mani Na Inna, Kachalla Basiru Zakarriya and ofem Emmanuel Igwe among others.\n“Overall, in the third quarter of this year, troops neutralized 1,937 terrorists, arrested 2,782 suspected terrorists and other criminal elements as well as rescued 1,854 kidnapped hostages.\n“Furthermore, troops recovered 1,304 weapons, 43,347 ammunition and denied the oil theft of an estimated sum over N13 Bn (N13,081,605,534.00) only.’\nHe gave the breakdown as follows: 688 AK47 rifles, 32,945 rounds of 7.62mm special ammo, 9,677 rounds of 7.62mm NATO, 191 assorted arms and 8,292 assorted ammo.\nOthers are 12,143,870 litres of stolen crude oil, 2,623,216 litres of illegally refined AGO, 6,970 litres of DPK and 31,450 litres of PMS amongst other item. Accordingly , the nations daily crude oil production output is at an all time high with the nations daily target in sight.\n“On the whole, troops are keeping the pressure on the terrorist until they are totally defeated.\n‘The military is focussed on dismantling the terror infrastructure of these terror groups as well as destroying their will to fight.\n“Accordingly, we are attacking any threat we identify, and removing it. The war objective is to destroy these groups, decapitate them, and erode their ability to rage terror attacks against citizens”, Buba stated.",

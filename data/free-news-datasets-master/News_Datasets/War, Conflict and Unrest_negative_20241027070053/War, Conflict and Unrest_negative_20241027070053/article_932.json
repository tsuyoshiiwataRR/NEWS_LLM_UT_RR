    "text": "russian dictator Putin plans to change the procedure for the use of nuclear weapons by announcing an expanded list of conditions at a meeting of the russia's Security Council. Of course, it is necessary to understand that for Moscow, nuclear blackmail has become the only means of communication in the international arena, but we are talking about a really important marker, because Putin always tries to legitimize his crimes. Read more:[The UK Defense Intelligence Analyzes Ukrainian Attack on the Toropets Ammunition Depot] We are talking about a document called \"Basics of the State Policy of the russian federation in the Field of Nuclear Deterrence\". This normative act appeared only in 2020 and four years ago expanded the policy of nuclear proliferation of the russian federation and the use of nuclear weapons. In particular, in its current version, the conditions for the use of nuclear weapons are: • reliable information about a ballistic missile attack; • use of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction on the territory of the russian federation and its allies; • the impact of the enemy on critically important state or military facilities of the russian federation, the decommissioning of which will lead to the disruption of the actions of nuclear forces in response; • non-nuclear aggression against the russian federation, when \"the very existence of the state is at risk\"’ The last point was precisely the novella that expanded the use of nuclear weapons thanks to the very vague concept of \"threats to the existence of the state.\" Especially since the fate of the russian federation, as a state entity, but not the lives of its citizens and humanity in general, is determined as a priority. But now, in view of Putin's statement, this list is expanding even more. And the Kremlin plans to use nuclear weapons in the event of a \"massive launch and crossing of the border of air-space attack means\", the list of which includes not only cruise missiles, but also UAVs and all other aircraft. Another and no less important change is aggression against the russian federation by a non-nuclear state, but \"with the participation or support of a nuclear state\" is considered as their joint attack on the russian federation. The combination of these two points obviously directly describes the situation as seen in the Kremlin, when, for example, Ukraine carries out an attack on the russian federation not only with Western weapons, but even with its own. Because the terms \"participation\" and \"support\" allow a very broad interpretation. Thus, these changes to the russian nuclear doctrine can really be explained very simply - the legalization of the right of preventive nuclear strike, both against Ukraine as well as against any other NATO or EU country. Why was it done right now - apparently for another round of nuclear blackmail against the background of the West's indecision. According to the Kremlin, this approach to intimidation should make their next \"red line\" even redder. Whether it will make sense will obviously become known only later, as well as whether it will work. Because in any case, Ukraine will continue to carry out massive long-range strikes with drones and destroy such strategic objects of the russian federation as [GRAU arsenals](https://en.defence-ua.com/news/another_grau_arsenal_covering_a_huge_area_and_ammunition_base_with_north_korean_shells_destroyed-11929.html) or [Voronezh-M over-the-horizon radar](https://en.defence-ua.com/news/strategic_blindness_the_effect_of_ukraines_attack_on_voronezh_m_over_the_horizon_radar_in_orsk_explained-10643.html), etc. Read more:[The White House Announces that Ukraine Will Receive Long-range Cruise Bombs for F-16 Aircraft in Aid Package Worth $7.9 bln]",

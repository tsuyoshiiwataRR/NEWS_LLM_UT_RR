    "text": "Published on 09/26/2024 at 6:31 p.m. 2 minutes of reading Passionate about sport and more particularly football since my early childhood. Read more Olympique de [Marseille](/tag/Marseille) won an epic Olympico against Olympique Lyonnais last weekend (3-2), a success snatched in a tense context and with one player less for almost the entire match. This match, marked by numerous refereeing decisions, sparked strong reactions, notably those from Medhi Benatia, the club’s sports advisor. The former Moroccan international did not hide his dissatisfaction with Benoît Bastien’s refereeing, expressing his irritation in a particularly vehement manner. Benatia in serious danger Now, this attitude could cost him dearly. According to information from ProvenceBenatia was summoned by the disciplinary committee of the Professional Football League (LFP) to answer for his comments deemed inappropriate. The commission is due to meet this week to rule on the case of the former Juventus defender. The main risk for him? A four-match suspensiona sanction which corresponds to the scales applied for “hurtful comments outside of a meeting”. However, the LFP has a certain latitude to adjust the sanction according to the seriousness of the alleged acts. Indeed, if his words are considered particularly inappropriate, the suspension could be revised upwards. Conversely, a more nuanced statement or mitigating circumstances could lead to a reduction in the sentence. In a context where managing emotion after a tense match can be difficult, the committee will have to weigh its decisions carefully. For Olympique de Marseille, this potential sanction represents a hard blow. Medhi Benatia plays an essential role within the Marseille organization, bringing his experience and his vision of football. His prolonged absence could complicate sporting coordination within the club, especially at a time when OM needs stability. It remains to be seen whether the disciplinary committee will show leniency or whether it will be necessary to do without its services for several weeks. Whatever the case, this affair illustrates once again the extent to which pressure can mount around Olympique de Marseille, a club often at the heart of debates and controversies, especially when it comes to clashes at high voltage like the Olympico.",

    "text": "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine on Thursday condemned the use of photos of the consequences of the war of Russia against Ukraine in a political ad in Georgia, said a message published on the ministry's website and quoted by \"Ukrinform\". \"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine condemns as unacceptable the use in political advertising of photographs of the terrible consequences of Russia's merciless war against Ukraine, the suffering and blood of thousands of innocent people, the destruction of religious shrines and cultural heritage,'' said the the ministry. Ukrainian diplomats called on the government of Georgia, the ruling party \"Georgian Dream\" and all interested parties to refrain from exploiting the theme of the aggressive war waged against Ukraine and its citizens in the internal political struggle in Georgia. \"The Georgian people should not fear another war while Ukraine resists Russian aggression. The terrible price of this resistance is also the price of peace in Georgia,\" the statement emphasized. The MFA added that Ukraine will consistently, steadfastly and resolutely continue to support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognized borders and expressed hope that the parliamentary elections will be held in a peaceful and democratic manner and that the Georgian people will pursue the strategic course towards joining the EU and NATO. The campaign materials of the ruling party \"Georgian Dream\" were condemned by the country's president, Salome Zurabishvili, as \"shameful and offensive to culture, traditions, history and faith\". We remind you that the invitation of Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze to a reception for world leaders organized by US President Joe Biden during the UN General Assembly was withdrawn. According to reports, the reason is \"anti-democratic actions, disinformation and negative rhetoric\" by the Georgian government towards the US and the West. Although Georgia has traditionally been pro-Western and has been a major recipient of American aid since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, relations between the country and Western powers have soured in recent months. The main reason is accusations of authoritarian and pro-Russian tendencies in the governance of Georgia, especially after the adoption of a law on \"foreign agents\" inspired by Russian legislation. In July, the EU also froze around 30 million euros in military aid to Georgia. The European Union will reduce political contacts with Georgia and consider freezing financial aid to the government after it pushed through the controversial \"foreign agents\" law, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in June. Georgian officials indicated that Kobakhidze was initially invited to the event, but the US subsequently declined any meetings with his delegation. In response, the speaker of the parliament, Shalva Papuashvili, called the decision \"frivolous\".",

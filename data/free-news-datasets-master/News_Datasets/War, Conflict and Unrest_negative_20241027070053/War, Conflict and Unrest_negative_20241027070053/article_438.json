    "text": "RSC Anderlecht failed to attract a new playmaker during the summer transfer window. The CEO of Sports, however, dreamed of securing the services of Christian Eriksen, but this ultimately proved impossible. The RSCA can, however, hope for a second chance for the Danish star. The first priority of the summer transfer window was to strengthen the defense. It’s done, even if we didn’t spend a lot of money. In midfield, Leander Dendoncker was recovered. Finally, an additional corridor attacker was found in the person of Samuel Edozie. On paper, this is a good list of reinforcements. But the much-desired new playmaker ultimately did not materialize. On a football level, the RSCA started the season in a disappointing way. In recent weeks, the team clearly needed some extra creativity, someone capable of turning the team around. A dream transfer But this player ultimately did not come. “They probably didn’t find the perfect profiles because the main target couldn’t be recruited,” explained owner Marc Coucke via Instagram. With this “main target”, Coucke is in all likelihood pointing towards Eriksen. The Danish international was Fredberg’s dream and Anderlecht also seemed to have the assets to land him. Despite this, his arrival did not materialize. Perhaps due to a combination of sporting and especially financial factors. But Fredberg and his teammates must not despair, a great revenge is possible. Sale in January After all, Eriksen’s contract at United is coming to an end. And there has been no question of an extension for some time. TEAMTalk went further. According to the media outlet, United want to create space in midfield and in the salary budget in January. So they would consider letting Eriksen go for a small fee. The RSCA could then try its luck again, even if the matter remains particularly delicate for the Brussels team.",

    "text": "The Multinational Security Support policing mission in Haiti is making minimal progress due to a lack of adequate financial support from the UN for the member states who pledged to send law enforcement to the gang-infested Caribbean nation.\nKenya leads the UN-authorised mission with 400 men currently in Haiti, and 600 more getting ready to deploy very soon. There are also very small contingents from Jamaica and Belize.\nThe mission doesn’t have enough money and deadlines are starting to loom.\nMember states who committed to contribute $ 84 million (Sh10.8 billion) have so far contributed $67 million (Sh8.6 billion) through the UN Trust Fund for the MSS.\nThe mission is expected to comprise up to 2,500 police personnel, deployed in phases, at an annual cost of approximately $600 million.\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres on Wednesday addressed a ministerial meeting on Haiti, where he hailed Kenya, Belize and Jamaica for deploying personnel to restore calm in the Caribbean nation.\n“Funding for the mission, and for the Haitian National Police, remains totally inadequate. I urge all those who have made financial commitments to deliver on them urgently. We must keep working to mobilize sufficient resources for the mission, and for the humanitarian response in Haiti,” Guterres told the ministerial meeting.\nHe said there is some progress in establishing transitional governance structures that saw the selection of Garry Conille as Prime Minister.\n“But the Haitian people are still subjected to egregious human rights abuses by gangs. Young women and girls continue to suffer appalling levels of sexual violence and abuse,” Guterres further noted.\nHaiti Prime Minister Garry Conille told a Ministerial meeting on Wednesday that the nation was a long way from winning its war against armed gangs that control most of the capital – Port-au-Prince.\n“We are nowhere near winning this, and the simple reality is that we won’t without your help,” Conille told the UN ministerial meeting, noting the sense of urgency in restoring peace.\nThe MSS was on October 2, 2023, approved by the Security Council to be a non-UN mission that would be funded by member states.\nNearly one year after the high-level declaration, the Council is on September 30 expected to vote on the renewal of the MSS mandate.\nThis comes two months after the mandate of the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) until July 15, 2025.\nAs the decision of the 15-member Council awaits, there have been reports that a section of the security body is considering making the MSS mission into a U.N. peacekeeping operation.\nPresident William Ruto visited Port-au-Prince on September, 21 and announced he supports the idea of having the mission converted to a full U.N. peacekeeping operation.\n“On the suggestion to transit this into a fully U.N. Peacekeeping mission, we have absolutely no problem with it, if that is the direction the U.N. security council wants to take,” Ruto said.\nIn a press briefing on September 23, Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the Secretary-General said that the decision to convert the MSS into a UN peacekeeping mission lies in the hands of the Security Council.\n“First of all, it needs to have the agreement and support of the government of Haiti. And, of course, should the Security Council decide to move in that direction, the Secretary-General will do as requested,” Dujarric told reporters at the UN Headquarters in New York.\nThe US wants to turn the mission into a United Nations peace operation, hoping a formal arrangement will allow more funds to flow into the mission to restore peace.\nThis will among others make funding automatic through the UN system.\nOn Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the United States is providing an additional $160 million in development, economic, health, and security assistance for the Haitian people.\nSource: KahawaTungu Reporter.",

    "text": "CHICAGO — The Chicago White Sox averted a record-breaking loss for the third straight day, beating the Angels 7-0 on Thursday behind Chris Flexen’s sharp pitching performance.\nChicago improved to 39-120 with its three-game sweep of the Angels. It has been tied with the 1962 New York Mets for the modern major league record for losses since Sunday’s 4-2 setback at San Diego.\n“We’ve played really good baseball these last three games, so it’s really good to see,” first baseman Andrew Vaughn said.\nAdvertisement The White Sox finished their home schedule with a 23-58 record. They have three games left this weekend against the Detroit Tigers, who are in the mix for an AL wild card.\nAngels\nAngels fall in 10th to tie team record with 95th loss The Chicago White Sox avoided a record-breaking 121st loss for the second straight game by beating the Angels in extra innings.\nSept. 25, 2024\n“I think guys are excited after this series,” interim manager Grady Sizemore said. “It’s going to be a fun atmosphere there. These guys are playing for [the] postseason. We’re going there to compete and not make it easy and try to get wins and try to just keep going.”\nFlexen (3-15) struck out seven in 6 1/3 innings in his first win since May 8. The right-hander was winless in his previous 23 starts, a franchise record.\nAdvertisement Flexen was cheered by the crowd of 15,678 when he departed on a sunny afternoon.\n“It was awesome,” Flexen said, “especially after the last couple nights, hearing some boos after winning a game. It’s been tough, but to have a real ovation there was pretty special.”\nThe Angels dropped to 63-96 to set a franchise record for losses in a season. It went 1-6 on its final trip to finish with a 31-50 road record — the most road losses for the team since it went 27-53 in 1996.\n× “I haven’t processed anything yet,” catcher Logan O’Hoppe said. “It’s pretty sickening, going in the spring and expecting things to turn around, and then it happens. We’ve got a good group in here, and it doesn’t feel like what the record shows, but the record is what it is.”\nThe Angels had just six hits — five off Flexen. They managed just five runs and 19 hits in the series at Chicago.\nAdvertisement The White Sox put it away with a season-high seven runs in the fifth inning, helped by an error on shortstop Jack López. Andrew Vaughn hit a two-run single, and Lenyn Sosa doubled home two more runs.\nLópez moved from second base to shortstop after Zach Neto departed because of right shoulder irritation. Neto got hurt when he tried to take second on a pitch in the dirt in the fourth.\n“I was sliding and I felt a little discomfort, but everything is fine,” Neto said.\nAngels\nDespite franchise futility, Ron Washington believes he can teach the Angels how to win Ron Washington admits it has been frustrating teaching inexperienced Angels how to be major-leaguers, but he is confident his work will pay off.\nSept. 25, 2024\nVaughn had three of Chicago’s 12 hits. Sosa, Zach DeLoach and Dominic Fletcher each had two.\nAngels left-hander Tyler Anderson (10-15) permitted five runs, four earned, and four hits in 4 1/3 innings.\nTrainer’s room First baseman Nolan Schanuel got the day off after he fouled a ball off his right leg in the first inning of Wednesday night’s loss. Manager Ron Washington said Schanuel could play this weekend. “He’s moving around better,” Washington said. “We’ll see where he is when we get back to Anaheim.”\nUp next Left-hander Reid Detmers (4-8, 6.67 ERA) takes the mound on Friday night against Texas. RHP Jacob deGrom (0-0, 1.35 ERA) goes for the visiting Rangers.\nMore to Read\nAngels’ season ends with shutout loss to the Rangers Sept. 29, 2024\nAngels’ collapse helps White Sox avoid setting record for losses in a season Sept. 24, 2024\nAngels hand White Sox their 117th loss of the season Sept. 18, 2024\nAngels",

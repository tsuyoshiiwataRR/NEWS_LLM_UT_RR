    "text": "The situation in the Middle East continues to become tense. Iran is threatening to enter directly into the conflict that is taking place there. Tehran intends to support Lebanon “by all means” in the event of an escalation of the Israeli offensive, the Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs warned on Wednesday. “The region is on the brink of total catastrophe. If the situation is not brought under control, the world will face catastrophic consequences,” Abbas Araghchi warned ahead of an emergency UN Security Council meeting on Lebanon. [Paris](/tag/Paris) and Washington for a 21-day ceasefire Israel’s ambassador to the UN responded a few minutes later that his country would prefer a diplomatic solution to allow the residents of northern Israel to return home. “That would be much better for Israel, much better for Lebanon,” Danny Danon said. But if diplomacy fails, “we will use all means at our disposal, in accordance with international law, to achieve our goals,” he warned. At the emergency meeting of the Security Council, [France](/tag/France), in partnership with the United States, made a proposal to establish a temporary 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon in order to facilitate negotiations between Israel and Hezbollah, whose main ally is none other than Tehran.",

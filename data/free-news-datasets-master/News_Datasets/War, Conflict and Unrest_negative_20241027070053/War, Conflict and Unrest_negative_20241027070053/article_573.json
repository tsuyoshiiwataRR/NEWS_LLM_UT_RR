(Original Post) Yo_Mama_Been_Loggin 1 hr ago OP [MagaSmash](/?com=profile&uid=366977) (7,310 posts)1. Putin has trump by the BALLS. trump needs the Flattery. [TwilightZone](/?com=profile&uid=152177) (27,009 posts)2. No one should have been shocked. He's been saying stuff like this for years. [Wiz Imp](/?com=profile&uid=164516) (524 posts)3. That was even far worse than I imagined However, I did find it interesting that his audience did not react at all to his horrible comments.

[Skittles](/?com=profile&uid=104905) (157,132 posts)4. he's gone beyond ridiculous he sounds like someone on a city street corner ranting about end of times If anybody else said these things, there'd be calls to lock them up.

    "text": "[+](javascipt:void(0);)\nDuring a recent interview with The New Yorker, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy labeled JD Vance, Ohio Senator and Donald Trump’s 2024 running mate, as “too radical.” Zelenskyy was responding to Vance’s suggestion to resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict with a deal where Ukraine remains neutral, avoiding alliances like NATO.\nZelenskyy rejected the proposal, referring to lessons from World War II, and suggesting that Vance should “do some reading” about the dangers of appeasement.\nZelensky called JD Vance “too radical.”\nVance fired back at Zelensky for what came off as campaigning, saying, “I don’t appreciate Zelensky coming to this country and telling the American taxpayers what they oughta do. He oughta say thank you to the American taxpayers.” 👏🏻\n[pic.twitter.com/dlWEAVa05Y]— Julia 🇺🇸 (@Jules31415)\n[September 26, 2024]\nDuring a campaign rally in Traverse City, Michigan, JD Vance hit back at Zelenskyy’s comments. He clarified that his idea, discussed on the Shawn Ryan Show podcast, was just “one possible scenario,” not an official plan.\nHowever, Vance voiced his displeasure with Zelenskyy’s US visit, criticizing the Ukrainian leader for “telling the American taxpayer what they ought to do” after receiving substantial US financial and military aid. He suggested Zelenskyy should show more gratitude to the American people.\nJD Vance also highlighted former President Donald Trump’s stance on Ukraine, claiming that under Trump’s leadership, Russia did not attack Ukraine. He criticized the current Democratic administration for its failure to deter Russian aggression, attributing this to “weak and dumb” leadership. Vance reiterated Trump’s promise to resolve the Ukraine conflict within “24 hours” if re-elected in 2024.",

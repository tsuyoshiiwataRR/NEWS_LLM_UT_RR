    "text": "PFU accumulates astronomical debt regarding Chernobyl pensions: the amount named. More than 161 thousand court decisions have been accumulated by the Pension Fund of Ukraine regarding Chernobyl pensions As of August 1 of the current year, the Pension Fund of Ukraine has over 161 thousand court decisions obligating it to pay those affected by the Chernobyl disaster. This was reported by the Fund in response to a request from the publication \"Economic Truth\". These court decisions relate to the increase of pensions for non-working pensioners living in radiation-contaminated areas. To settle the debt according to these decisions, the state must allocate 17.2 billion hryvnias from the budget. The situation is causing serious concern as it affects people who suffered from the consequences of the largest man-made disaster of the 20th century. Although nearly four decades have passed since the Chernobyl NPP accident, its consequences continue to affect the lives and health of thousands of Ukrainians. Earlier, Human Rights Commissioner Dmytro Lubinets stated that the total debt of the state is nearly 70 billion hryvnias regarding court decisions on pension payments in Ukraine.

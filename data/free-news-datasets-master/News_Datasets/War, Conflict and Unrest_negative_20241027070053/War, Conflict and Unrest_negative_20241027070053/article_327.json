    "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today accused his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin of planning attacks on Ukraine’s nuclear infrastructure.\n“I recently received other alarming information from our intelligence services that Putin appears to be planning attacks on our nuclear facilities and their infrastructure,” Zelensky said during his address to the UN General Assembly.\n“You will not increase your power at the expense of Ukraine”\nThe Ukrainian president also cast doubt on the “genuine interest” of a push by China and Brazil to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, saying: “You will not increase your power at the expense of Ukraine.”\n“When some propose alternative, half-hearted settlement plans, so-called package proposals, they not only ignore the interests and suffering of Ukrainians but also give (Russian President Vladimir) Putin political space to continue the war,” he said.\nDenouncing “colonialist wars and conspiracies of big powers against small” countries, the Ukrainian president said that “Ukrainians will never accept” a possible peace agreement with Moscow that would be “imposed” on them.\n#Zelensky #Putin #planning #attacks #Ukraines #nuclear #infrastructure",

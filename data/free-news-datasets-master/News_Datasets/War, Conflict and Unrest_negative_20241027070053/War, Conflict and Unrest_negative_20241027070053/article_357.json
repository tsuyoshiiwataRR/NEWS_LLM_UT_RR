    "text": "Follow-up - INA Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas confirmed today, Thursday, that the Zionist entity has completely destroyed Gaza, and is still committing crimes, calling on the international community to impose sanctions against it. Abbas said in his speech before the UN General Assembly: \"The Zionist entity has reoccupied the entire Gaza Strip and almost completely destroyed it, making it an uninhabitable place, after most of the homes, buildings, health and educational facilities, economic establishments, roads, churches, mosques, water and electricity stations, water treatment plants, and others were destroyed.\" Abbas added, \"If the Zionist entity thinks that it will escape accountability and punishment for these crimes, it is delusional,\" calling on \"the international community to immediately begin imposing sanctions on it.\" Abbas stressed that \"the massacres, crimes, and genocide committed by the Zionist entity against our people since its establishment until today will not pass without accountability, and will not be subject to a statute of limitations, for no right is lost if someone demands it.\" “Despite our urgent and repeated demands, the world has not succeeded in forcing the Zionist entity to stop the genocidal war and war crimes against innocent civilians,” he continued, adding, “We regret that the US administration has three times obstructed Security Council draft resolutions calling on the Zionist entity to cease fire by using its veto, and on top of that, it has provided it with lethal weapons that have killed thousands of innocent children, women and elderly people, which has encouraged the Zionist entity to continue its aggression.” [ Hezbollah declares bombing of a colony and a Zionist intelligence headquarters ](https://ina.iq/eng/35043-hezbollah-declares-bombing-of-a-colony-and-a-zionist-intelligence-headquarters.html) [ Antarctica’s 'doomsday' glacier is heading for catastrophic collapse ](https://ina.iq/eng/34876-antarcticas-doomsday-glacier-is-heading-for-catastrophic-collapse.html) [ PM: Pushing forward the relations between Iraq and Somalia is necessary ](https://ina.iq/eng/34979-pm-pushing-forward-relations-between-iraq-and-somalia-is-necessary.html)",

    "text": "The Ukrainian Intelligence has received evidence showing that the Russian military is planning to increase the number of assaults on Zaporizhzhia Oblast, says Spokesperson for the Southern Defense Forces, Vladyslav Voloshyn, UkrInform has reported.\nAccording to the information, Russian troops have received the necessary equipment for advancing. Moreover, the number of assaults has increased over the past few days.\n“The situation in Zaporizhzhia Oblast will most likely escalate along the front line. Yesterday, there were already five assaults, and there is a tendency for them to increase, as our intelligence reports that the enemy is gathering personnel for assault groups near Pryiutne .\nThe enemy has received 25 buggy vehicles from the reserve storage base of the Southern Military District of the Russian Federation. It indicates preparations for assault operations,” the spokesperson reported.\nVoloshyn noted that the situation on the southern front remains as tense as in the other directions. Over the past day, seven combat engagements have occurred in southern Ukraine, five of which were reported in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.\nCombat engagements took place near Robotyne and Nova Andriivka in Zaporizhzhia Oblast and near the islands in the Dnipro River close to Kherson. The Russian army also conducted airstrikes with guided bombs, fired artillery, and launched kamikaze drone strikes.\nCurrently, the Russians are conducting reconnaissance with assault groups of up to ten soldiers, the spokesperson stated.\n“Their tactic is to quickly cover the distance between trenches, between the front lines, and to establish themselves in our trenches,” he explained.\nVoloshyn added that the Russian military does not face a shortage of shells during its military operations.\nRelated:\nRussia bombs Zaporizhzhia, injuring 16 civilians, including a 15-year-old Kharkiv residential area hit by FAB-250 bomb, 21 locals injured Deadly Russian missile strike kills 3 civilians, including child, in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Ukraine intercepts all 42 Russian drones; other Russian attacks kill four, injure 20 civilians in four regions Ukraine repels massive Russian explosive drone assault, destroying 71/80 Shaheds You could close this page.

    "text": "ST. LOUIS â€” The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department has confirmed that a man is facing charges after they say he targeted four chain retailers in just one night. Dorian Harris, 26, has been charged with four counts of second-degree burglary, two counts of stealing, two counts of second-degree attempted burglary, and 2 counts of first-degree property damage. Harris stole a total of $1,500 from the stores, police said. On Tuesday night around 9 p.m., police responded to a burglary at Rainbow located in the 3600 block of Page Avenue. Other SLMPD officers also responded to a call around 9:15 p.m. at Randall's Wine and Spirits located in the 1900 block of South Jefferson Avenue. Police said this was an attempted burglary. Early Wednesday morning just after midnight, more officers responded to another burglary at Kids Footlocker located in the 3600 block of Page Avenue near the Rainbow store. Then around 1:30 a.m. on Wednesday, officers arrived at the scene of an attempted burglary at City Gear in the 3500 block of Bamberger Avenue. The initial investigation revealed surveillance footage that led police to Harris. Police said that Harris admitted his involvement in the burglaries. Missouri has requested pre-trial detention due to the nature of the offense and Harris' prior criminal history. In St. Clair County, Illinois, Harris has pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a stolen vehicle and aggravated fleeing. Police did not say if Harris acted alone in these burglaries.",

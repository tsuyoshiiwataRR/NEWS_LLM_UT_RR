    "text": "Pentagon officials have recommended that the US supply Ukraine with white phosphorus munitions, but the White House has rejected the idea several times, said US officials familiar with the matter, NBC News has reported.\nWhite phosphorus is a substance that ignites instantly when exposed to oxygen, burning at a very high temperature. Phosphorus munitions are not illegal to use against military troops but should not be used to fire at civilian targets, according to international law.\nThe Pentagon recommended providing white phosphorus artillery shells to Ukraine to produce light and smoke, not for use against Russian troops.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have many times accused Russia of using white phosphorus against civilians in Ukraine, especially in Donbas amid battles for Bakhmut or Kherson.\nThe Pentagon has recommended supplying Ukraine with white phosphorus shells as part of several aid packages, including the most recent one under the Presidential Drawdown Authority, according to officials.\nHowever, two officials noted that concerns over the potential impact on civilians and the stigma surrounding white phosphorus have so far prevented the Biden administration from approving the recommendation.\nRelated:\nTrump, Vance, Johnson claim Zelenskyy favors Democrats US to announce $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine during Zelenskyy’s visit, Reuters sources say US “unimpressed” with Zelenskyy’s “Victory Plan,” WSJ sources say Pentagon announces $ 375 million military aid package for Ukraine Biden says “we cannot let up” on Ukraine support amid US’ uncertain political future You could close this page.

    "text": "At the intersection of Tyndall and Euclid Avenue, members of the Party for Socialism and Liberation organized an impromptu demonstration Tuesday, Sept. 24 in response to the increasing conflict between Lebanon and Israel.\nIsrael deployed missiles into the country of Lebanon starting Monday, Sept. 23 with the objective of targeting the group, Hezbollah.\nAfter pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah exploded over the weekend — killing several people and injuring thousands — the conflict has worsened. Casualties are increasing as Israel continues to retaliate with airstrikes in Lebanon. This is after attacks on Palestine have not ceased, sending the region into increased tensions.\nThe protest began with chants supporting a free Palestine, including, ”From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” and, “From the sea to the river, Palestine will live forever.” Demonstrators also called for an end to U.S. military aid to Israel, chanting, “Not another nickel, not another dime, no more money for Israel’s crimes.” Several protestors also said that they were opposed to military occupation and annexation.\nMembers who led the protest started a public discussion about the escalation beyond the regions of Palestine and Lebanon. They spoke on the right of countries to defend themselves in response to the current occupation.\nMembers also talked about the effects of imperialism internationally, speaking of places like Haiti, Puerto Rico and indigenous communities within the United States, calling for global resistance. The demonstration ended with calls for collective community action and solidarity to address the events in Palestine and beyond.\nDesiree Nguyen, a member of Students for Socialism club at the University of Arizona, spoke during the protest condemning Israel’s ongoing war against Palestinians and Lebanese. She said the United States’ government and Western media downplayed the crisis and called for international solidarity.\nWhen discussing a call to action for local representatives, Nguyen said “Listen to the people who are asking you to stand up against Israel, to defund these corporations, specifically in Tucson. We have Raytheon, we have L3 Harris, we have Caterpillar […]. Whether it’s making bombs, transporting rockets […] these corporations are known for funding the Israeli genocide.”\nWhen discussing the motivations for attending the protest, a community member who wished to remain anonymous said, “I have a ton of family in the South of Lebanon, and they are all currently displaced. My village has been pretty much decimated […]. Most of them have [evacuated] north […]. It’s been really, really tough. We’re all really shaken.”\nThe attendee called for the community to stay informed, and avoid misinformation. When asked if they had a message for the current legislative office, they said, “I’m just tired. I feel unheard as an Arab-American and coming out here is the best I can do for my voice to be heard.”\nHowever, not all agreed, as a counter-demonstration occurred. During these chants, a young man across the street started shouting expletives towards the group. Both sides remained non-violent.\nAfter the open discussion, chants criticized the current Biden administration for the lack of diplomatic intervention, echoing a call to boot the Harris campaign for their lack of policies advocating for a ceasefire.\nA member of the Party for Socialism and Liberation speaking at the protest said, “We believe that the current capitalist system is insufficient to handle the various crises of our time, whether it’s inflation, rising rents, lack of access to health care, the destruction of our planet’s climate. We see things just getting worse and worse as things go on, and we believe that we have to completely reject the two-party system and take control of the government for working-class people such as ourselves.”\nFollow the Daily Wildcat on\nTwitter/X",

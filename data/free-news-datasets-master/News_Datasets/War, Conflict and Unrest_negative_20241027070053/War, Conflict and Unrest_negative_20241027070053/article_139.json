Such an inquiry is standard procedure for all incidents in which a police officer may have caused a person’s death.\n“If OSI’s assessment indicates an officer may have caused the death, OSI proceeds to conduct a full investigation of the incident,” the agency said.\nAdditional details about Bennett’s life were not immediately available.

    "text": "NEW YORK CITY: Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, Sudan’s army chief and chairman of the Transitional Sovereignty Council, on Thursday described the rebel Rapid Support Forces as a “terrorist group” for committing crimes against the country’s people, including “ethnic cleansing, forced displacement and genocide.\nSince the ongoing conflict broke out between the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces in April 2023, the paramilitary group has taken over the capital Khartoum and most of western Sudan.\nThe hostilities have killed at least 15,000 people and displaced more than 6.1 million, according to UN figures.\nAddressing the UN General Assembly, Al-Burhan stressed his government’s commitment to protecting civilians and aid workers, as well as facilitating humanitarian assistance.\n“We fully uphold international humanitarian law and measures geared towards the protection of civilians,” he said. “The protection of civilians is our responsibility.”\nHe said women and children “are being hit the hardest by violations committed in areas controlled by the militias. Some women and children have even been sold in marketplaces.”\nAl-Burhan added that the council has been seeking a peaceful solution to the conflict. “So as to alleviate the suffering of our fellow Sudanese and to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance, we’ve opened our borders and airports,” he said. We’ve lifted all impediments to this aid being delivered.”\nThe Jeddah Declaration of Commitment to Protect the Civilians of Sudan — signed by the US, Saudi Arabia, and representatives of Sudan’s two warring parties in May 2023 — aimed to achieve a ceasefire and facilitate humanitarian aid distribution.",

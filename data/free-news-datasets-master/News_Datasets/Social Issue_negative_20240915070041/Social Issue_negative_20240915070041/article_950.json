    "text": "Manchester residents raise concerns about needles as new cleanup program launches A new program in Manchester is aimed at cleaning up trash and used needles, as some residents said parts of the city are getting worse. The StreetPlus program is tackling issues in the city's business district. \"We're actually proud of what we're doing, and I think the community is taking this seriously, as well,\" said James McGee, operations manager of the StreetPlus team. The StreetPlus team has been active for a month, collecting more than 3,100 pounds of trash and 52 needles. >> Download the free WMUR app to get updates on the go: [Apple](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=109350X1567034&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fwmur-news-9-breaking-news%2Fid504646663%3Fign-mpt%3Duo%253D6&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wmur.com%2Farticle%2Fmanchester-trash-needles-cleanup-program-81524%2F61891152&xcust=undefined) | [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hearst.android.wmur&hl=en) << \"And I think it's going to send a message to people here in Manchester and around the state that we are open for business,\" said Mayor Jay Ruais. Ruais said the program will expand, adding two more workers, known as ambassadors, and focus on graffiti removal and improving street lights. But some residents said they're concerned about other areas of the Queen City. Resident Drew Parsons said he has found needles at Manchester Place and Stark Park. \"Unfortunately, yesterday, I found at least 12 needles just strewn on the grass on Heritage Trail, and it causes so much concern,\" he said. Resident Christine Galle was walking her dog at Stark Park on Thursday. \"There's a lot of kids that come out here with their families, and they play in the grass, and that's a real risk for them,\" she said. \"It speaks to the larger challenge that we have to address homelessness,\" Ruais said. \"And this is one of the reasons why we've been so proactive in our approach in the first eight months to address things along rail trails or in our parks.\" The mayor encouraged residents to report issues through the See-Click-Fix app, saying that the app alerts the Public Works Department.",

    "text": "Major League Baseball is constantly experimenting with new rule changes. Now that rules like the pitch clock and larger basses have been successful,\nMLB is considering an even bigger change.\nThis time, the starting pitchers would have to pitch for at least six innings every game. “We are interested in increasing the amount of action in the game, restoring the prominence of the starting pitcher, and reducing the prevalence of pitching injuries,” an MLB official told\nESPN. “There are a whole host of options in addressing those issues.“\nIt’s a rule that would completely change how every MLB game is played, and fans are unhappy with Commissioner Rob Manfred.\n“My god manfred is gonna kill the game. It’s 14-0 in the third because ur fifth starter didn’t have it. He’s thrown 130 pitches,” said someone on X.\n“We asked for ending blackout restrictions not ending the careers of starting pitchers. Smh,” said another.\nAlso Read:\nMLB Hands Down Punishment To Umpire For Violating League’s Gambling Rules\nClick on ‘Follow Us’ and get notified of the most viral MLB stories via Google!\nFollow Us\n“Luis Gil having throw 140 pitches because he hasn’t met the min after coming off TJ sounds smart. Just one of many stupid examples that would be a reality,” said a third.\n“Haven’t they done enough to ruin the game already? Let’s start a runner at 1st 2nd and 3rd in extra innings, too!” added a fourth.\nHowever, it is worth noting that many thought the pitch clock would also negatively affect the game, and so far, it’s been mostly an improvement.\nMLB Already Seeing An Uptick In Pitching Injuries\nThis new rule change could mean that MLB starting pitchers will be at an all-time high injury risk factor.\nIn fact, starting pitchers have already been getting hurt at an alarming rate compared to the past. According to the\nAmerican Medical Association 35.3% of starting pitchers in 2023 have undergone Tommy John surgery, which is a 29% rise since 2016.\nAlso Read:\nVIDEO: Cameras Caught Boston Red Sox All-Star Jarren Duran Yelling Homophobic Slur Towards Heckling Fan During Blowout Loss To Astros\nT",

    "text": "Thousands of demonstrators filled the streets of Kolkata early Thursday to protest the rape and murder of a local doctor, calling for justice for the victim and campaigning against the prevalent violence towards women in Indian society. The tragic discovery of the 31-year-old doctor’s mutilated body at a state-run hospital last week has fueled nationwide outrage and sparked a series of protests, compelling Prime Minister Narendra Modi to call for swift punishment for those guilty of heinous acts against women.\nThe crowds marching in Kolkata were part of a larger movement demanding justice, highlighted by a candlelight vigil at midnight that coincided with the start of India’s Independence Day celebrations. Protesters rallied under the powerful slogan “reclaim the night,” emphasizing the urgent need to address violence against women in a meaningful way. Many held handwritten signs advocating for action, with messages like “We want justice” and “Hang the rapist, save the women” resonating through the streets.\nMonalisa Guha, a midnight marcher, voiced her frustrations about the ongoing brutality faced by women, stating, “The atrocities against women do not stop.” Another marcher, Sangeeta Halder, shared her fears, explaining, “We face harassment almost on a daily basis, but not stepping out because of fear is not the solution.”\nDuring his speech at the Independence Day festivities in New Delhi, Modi expressed his “pain” regarding violence against women and recognized the national anger surrounding these atrocities. He stated, “Crimes against women should be quickly investigated; monstrous behavior against women should be severely and quickly punished.” Modi further emphasized that creating a society with confidence and a deterrent effect against such crimes is critical.\nThe medical community has echoed the call for justice, demanding improved security measures following the murder of their colleague. Doctors across numerous government hospitals have halted elective services indefinitely in protest, demonstrating their solidarity with the ongoing protests. Dhruv Chauhan from the Indian Medical Association’s Junior Doctors’ Network expressed the frustration of healthcare professionals, stating, “Doctors nationwide are questioning what is so difficult about enacting a law for our security,” adding that the strike will persist until all demands are formally addressed.\nThe Indian media has reported that the murdered doctor was located in the seminar hall of the teaching hospital, where it is believed she had gone for a brief rest during an arduous shift. An autopsy confirmed the unfortunate circumstances of sexual assault. In a petition to the court, the victim’s parents alleged that their daughter was gang-raped, according to reports by NDTV.\nAlthough police have detained a man employed at the hospital who aided patients in navigating queues, accusations of mishandling the investigation have arisen. To restore public confidence in the investigation, Kolkata’s High Court transferred the case to the prestigious Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Tensions escalated when a mob of approximately 40 individuals, frustrated with police handling of the case, stormed the grounds of R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital early Thursday morning, resulting in property damage and a violent confrontation with police, who had to deploy tear gas to disperse the crowd.\nWest Bengal lawmaker Abhishek Banerjee condemned the vandalism, describing it as “hooliganism,” while acknowledging that the demands of the protesting doctors are “fair and justified.”\nSexual violence against women remains a significant issue in India, with nearly 90 rapes reported daily in 2022, according to National Crime Records Bureau data. Past incidents, such as the brutal gang rape and torture of a young woman in Delhi, have exacerbated this crisis and underscored the urgency for societal change. In response to public outrage following the 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a Delhi bus, the government introduced harsher penalties for rapists, including the death penalty for repeat offenders, and enacted new offenses like stalking.\nThe recent murder of the doctor in Kolkata intimately resonates with these past tragedies and highlights the persistent struggle against sexual violence in India. The public response reflects a yearning for change and a unified stance against the culture of impunity around such acts of violence.\nSource: original news source",

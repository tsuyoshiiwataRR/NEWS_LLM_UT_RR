However, Depa's tutor shared an apology she claims he wrote while in custody, which she shared with [News Nation](https://www.newsnationnow.com/banfield/florida-teen-who-beat-teachers-aide-apology-not-read-in-court/). The note reads: \"I deeply regret allowing my emotions to get the best of me and letting things happen the way that they did. \"In a choice between letting this incident destroy, define, or strengthen me, I have chosen to let it strengthen me.\" Naydich, a mother of two, was calling for him to receive the maximum sentence of 30 years. \"Brendan Depa's actions that day has caused me to lose a job that I had for almost 19 years, lose my financial security, lose my health insurance,\" she told the court. In his note, Depa wrote: \"I am extremely sorry for injuring Miss Joan so severely, and I am happy to see the injuries I inflicted did not leave any permanent scars or bruises.\" DON'T MISS...

Depa's lawyers have filed a separate lawsuit against the school district alleging negligence, in which they describe him as \"a ticking time bomb.\" In his letter, Depa pleaded: \"What I did should not define who I am. \"I made a mistake - one I will never let happen again - and I am sorry. \"During my incarceration, I have learned coping skills to ensure something like this never happens again. 'I have grown and matured in ways otherwise impossible, making me not happy I have been incarcerated, but nonetheless grateful.\" His mother described the verdict as a \"death sentence\" and accused the justice system of punishing him for being large, black and disabled. \"He's scared,\" she told NewsNation. \"To have your child call and cry and say 'I don't want to die' â€” it's awful.'\" After completing his prison stint, Depa will be subject to 15 years of supervised probation.",

    "text": "NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - New Orleans officials are taking steps to prevent future utility disruptions after a Mylar balloon hitting power lines led to a boil water advisory affecting nearly the entire city.\nThe New Orleans City Council is reviewing the response to the incident, which resulted in an employee injury at the Sewerage and Water Board.\nEntergy reported that while the Sewerage and Water Board retained electricity, a brief voltage dip caused by the balloon created significant problems.\n“We never lost power, but that momentary dip in voltage is what they experienced,” said Steven Benyard, Entergy’s VP of Reliability.\nThe City Council is focusing on improving public education about the dangers of Mylar balloons, though it is not considering a ban. Instead, officials want to collaborate with Entergy to raise awareness about the risks balloons pose to power lines.\n“The risk reward of having Mylar balloons versus people being in the dark,” said JP Morrell, New Orleans City Council Vice-President. “When a Mylar balloon hits a powerline and causes an outage, it’s not just the outage, but the repairs which are born by ratepayers.”\nFollowing the incident, an employee at the Sewerage and Water Board was seriously injured when a hatch blew off. Emergency services were called minutes after the accident.\nRELATED STORIES\nMetallic balloon hits power line, plunges nearly all of New Orleans into boil water advisory, officials say Operator’s ‘serious injury’ delayed preventing citywide boil water advisory, officials say Councilman questions staffing, timeline of events leading to citywide boil advisory Ghassan Korban, Executive Director of the Sewerage and Water Board, believes that if the employee had not been injured, power would have been restored more quickly, avoiding the boil water advisory.\n“I can sit here and tell you that I would have done exactly what they did that night,” Korban said.\nNew Orleans City Council member Joe Giarusso stressed the importance of calling for additional support when capacity is compromised.\n“They need to tend to the injured person, but at the same time, if your manpower is needed, you need to not only call 911, but also for backup,” Giarusso said.\nThe Sewerage and Water Board plans to implement redundancies and safeguards, including the capability to connect portable pumps to maintain pressure once a new power complex is completed in over a year.\nMorrell also called for improved communication, saying that a more effective response could have prevented misinformation about the water supply being jeopardized by a Mylar balloon.\n“Had the communication been in place, it would have given us more time to investigate and provide a timeline,” Morrell said. “For nearly 24 hours, the world thought our water supply could be knocked out by a Mylar balloon.”\nThe Sewerage and Water Board promises to issue advisory announcements promptly in future hazardous situations.\nCouncilman Oliver Thomas reported that the injured employee is still recovering at a local hospital.\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?

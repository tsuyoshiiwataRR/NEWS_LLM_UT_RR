The drivers say they have been waiting for several weeks in the searing Egyptian summer heat.\nThe standstill is exacerbating Gaza's dire humanitarian crisis after nine months of war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas. Aid groups warn there is a high risk of famine across the besieged coastal territory.\nThe truck drivers, parked on the outskirts of the Egyptian city of al-Arish in the Sinai Peninsula, say they have been unable to deliver humanitarian supplies ever since Israel expanded its offensive on the Gaza-Egypt border in May.\nSome food has had to be discarded, they said.\nReuters\nIsrael Gaza War Updates\nMiddle East News\nIsrael-Gaza War Updates\nStranded\nAid\nTrucks\nEgypt\nGaza\nHumanitarian\nCrisis\nNext\nHealth ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says war death toll at 38,193\nIsraeli finance minister: Stopping Gaza war now would be folly\nPrevious\nRelated Articles\nd-none hideMe\n0\nIsrael-Gaza War Updates\n2024-07-18\nItaly sends humanitarian flight with aid for Gaza\nIsrael-Gaza War Updates\n2024-07-18\nItaly sends humanitarian flight with aid for Gaza\n0\nIsrael-Gaza War Updates\n21:57\nEgyptian channel: Differences between the parties in the Gaza talks remain 'significant'\nIsrael-Gaza War Updates\n21:57\nEgyptian channel: Differences between the parties in the Gaza talks remain 'significant'\n0\nNews Bulletin Reports\n2024-08-14\nSudanese Peace Talks in Geneva Falter Amidst Army's Withdrawal and Humanitarian Crisis\nNews Bulletin Reports\n2024-08-14\nSudanese Peace Talks in Geneva Falter Amidst Army's Withdrawal and Humanitarian Crisis\n0\nIsrael-Gaza War Updates\n2024-08-10\nEgypt: Israel lacks political will to end war in Gaza\nIsrael-Gaza War Updates\n2024-08-10\nEgypt: Israel lacks political will to end war in Gaza\nRecommended For You\nd-none hideMe\n0\nIsrael-Gaza War Updates\n21:57\nEgyptian channel: Differences between the parties in the Gaza talks remain 'significant'\nIsrael-Gaza War Updates\n21:57\nEgyptian channel: Differences between the parties in the Gaza talks remain 'significant'\n0\nBreaking Headlines\n20:55\nSecurity officials affirm to Netanyahu: The choice is between a hostage deal or regional war - Israeli Channel 13 reports\nBreaking Headlines\n20:55\nSecurity officials affirm to Netanyahu: The choice is between a hostage deal or regional war - Israeli Channel 13 reports\n0\nIsrael-Gaza War Updates\n20:08\nIsrael claims it 'eliminated more than 17,000' militants in Gaza\nIsrael-Gaza War Updates\n20:08\nIsrael claims it 'eliminated more than 17,000' militants in Gaza\n0\nNews Bulletin Reports\n19:35\nIsraeli Focus on Doha: Anticipation for Hostage Deal Negotiations\nNews Bulletin Reports\n19:35\nIsraeli Focus on Doha: Anticipation for Hostage Deal Negotiations\nSubscribe to our VOD\nSUBSCRIBE\nOur visitors readings\nd-none hideMe\n0\nNews Bulletin Reports\n2024-08-12\nUpcoming FAFT deadline: Could a potential war between Israel and Hezbollah impact Lebanon's currency stability?\nNews Bulletin Reports\n2024-08-12\nUpcoming FAFT deadline: Could a potential war between Israel and Hezbollah impact Lebanon's currency stability?\n0\nLebanon News\n19:08\nFrench FM Séjourné affirms support for Lebanon during critical period, calls for Gaza ceasefire\nLebanon News\n19:08\nFrench FM Séjourné affirms support for Lebanon during critical period, calls for Gaza ceasefire\n0\nLebanon News\n2024-08-12\nGallant reveals plan to attack Lebanon last October, no longer supports it\nLebanon News\n2024-08-12\nGallant reveals plan to attack Lebanon last October, no longer supports it\n0\nLebanon News\n2024-07-28\nWilliam Noun to LBCI: Beirut Port explosion anniversary to address specific goals\nLebanon News\n2024-07-28\nWilliam Noun to LBCI: Beirut Port explosion anniversary to address specific goals\nVideos\nd-none hideMe\n0\nNews Bulletin Reports\n2024-08-13\nLebanon's authorities uncover five bodies in Kfarshima house: Here are the details\nNews Bulletin Reports\n2024-08-13\nLebanon's authorities uncover five bodies in Kfarshima house: Here are the details\n0\nLebanon News\n2024-08-11\nLebanese Army finds main body of missile from Israeli Strike in Miryata forests\nLebanon News\n2024-08-11\nLebanese Army finds main body of missile from Israeli Strike in Miryata forests\n0\nLebanon News\n2024-07-31\nMohammed Khair: Nine buildings damaged in Israeli attack;

Rally\nIt could be another black eye for the Secret Service.\n39 Comments\nThe Secret Service has begun an investigation into a report of an agent abandoning her post protecting Republican candidate President Donald Trump to breastfeed her baby at his North Carolina Rally.\nFrom Newsweek: ‚ÄúAll employees of the U.S. Secret Service are held to the highest standards. While there was no impact to the North Carolina event, the specifics of this incident are being examined. Given this is a personnel matter, we are not in a position to comment further.‚Äù\nSusan Crabtree at RealClearInvestigations reported that a Secret Service (USSS) agent abandoned her post protecting Republican presidential candidate President Donald Trump to breastfeed her baby.\nThe agency\nüö®üö®EXCLUSIVE and BREAKING: During a Donald Trump visit to North Carolina yesterday, a woman Secret Service special agent abandoned her post to breastfeed with no permission/warning to the event site agent, according to three sources in the Secret Service community.\nShortly‚Ä¶\n[pic.twitter.com/lkfhhLcA0B]\n‚Äî Susan Crabtree (@susancrabtree)\n[August 15, 2024]\nCrabtree wrote:\nEXCLUSIVE and BREAKING: During a Donald Trump visit to North Carolina yesterday, a woman Secret Service special agent abandoned her post to breastfeed with no permission/warning to the event site agent, according to three sources in the Secret Service community.\nShortly before Trump‚Äôs motorcade arrival ‚Äî I‚Äôm told five minutes beforehand ‚Äî the site agent was getting ready for the arrival. (The site agent is the person in charge of the entire event‚Äôs security.)\nThe site agent went to do one final sweep of the walking route and found the agent breast-feeding her child in a room that is supposed to be set aside for important Secret Service official work, i.e. a potential emergency related to the president.\nA working agent on duty cannot bring a child to a protective assignment. The woman was out of the Atlanta Field Office.\nThe woman agent was in the room with two other family members.\nThe agent and her family members bypassed the Uniformed Division checkpoint and were escorted by an unpinned event staff into the room to breastfeed, the sources said. Unpinned means they have not been cleared by the Secret Service to be there.\nWhen contacted about the incident, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the incident did not have an impact on the event. and it‚Äôs under review.\n‚ÄúAll employees of the U.S. Secret Service are held to the highest standards,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhile there was no impact to the North Carolina event, the specifics of this incident are being examined.

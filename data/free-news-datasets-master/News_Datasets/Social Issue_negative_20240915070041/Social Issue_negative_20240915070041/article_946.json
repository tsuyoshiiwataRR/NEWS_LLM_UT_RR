    "text": "Dozens of candy and snack products sold at Walmart, Target, Dollar General recalled for possible salmonella contamination (Gray News) - A candy recall originally announced in May has been classified as the highest risk by the Food and Drug Administration. Palmer Candy was notified by a supplier its liquid coating could potentially have been contaminated by salmonella from a supplier’s ingredient. The products are listed as [Class 1](https://www.fda.gov/safety/industry-guidance-recalls/recalls-background-and-definitions#:~:text=Class%20I%20recall:%20a%20situation%20in%20which,not%20likely%20to%20cause%20adverse%20health%20consequences.), the highest level of risk. Production of the confections has been suspended while the FDA and the company continue their investigation into the problem’s source. The recalled items were distributed nationwide at Walmart, HyVee, Target and Dollar General. They were also sent to distributors in Alabama, California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The products come in a variety of retail packaging like bags, pouches and tubs. No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this recall. Healthy people infected with [salmonella](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15697-salmonella) may experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, health experts say. Infection with salmonella, in rare cases, can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses. Those who have purchased the white-coated candy and snack items manufactured by Palmer Candy Co. are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact Palmer’s at 1-800-831-0828 Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. A full list of the recalled items can be found [in the FDA announcement](https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/update-palmer-candy-company-recall-white-confectionary-products-because-possible-health-risk) and is included below: |Product||Best by date| |CARAMEL SWIRL PRETZELS 4oz||12/18/24-12/28/24| |CARAMEL SWIRL PRETZELS 6oz||12/19/24, 12/20/24 and 1/19/25| |CLASSIC YOGURT PRETZELS 28#||12/11/24 – 1/8/25| |COOKIES & CREAM YUMMY CHOW 14#||12/6/24 – 1/23/25| |ENROBED PRETZEL RODS 8oz||1/22/2025| |FAVORITE DAY BAKERY WHITE FUDGE MINI COOKIES 7oz||4/4/25, 4/5/25, 4/15/25 - 4/18/25| |FROSTED MUNCHY MEDLEY BOWL 15oz||1/3/2025| |FROSTED PATRIOT FROSTED PRETZELS 28#||1/2/25, 1/3/25| |FROSTED PRETZELS 6oz||1/23/2025| |MUNCHY MEDLEY 15#||12/14/24, 1/3/25| |MUNCHY MEDLEY 4oz||12/25/24 – 12/28/24 and 1/19/25| |MUNCHY MEDLEY TO GO 4oz||12/25/24 – 1/19/25| |MUNCHY MEDLEY 6oz||12/20/24, 4/25/25| |PATRIOTIC MUNCHY MEDLEY BOWL 15oz||1/19/2025| |PATRIOTIC PRETZELS 14oz||1/25/25, 1/26/25| |PATRIOTIC PRETZELS 6oz||1/19/2025| |PATRIOTIC RED, WHITE & BLUE PRETZEL TWISTS 14oz||12/13/24 - 1/15/25| |PATRIOTIC SNACK MIX 13oz||1/19/25 - 2/1/25| |PATRIOTIC WHITE FUDGE COOKIES 13.5oz||4/22/2025| |PATRIOTIC WHITE FUDGE COOKIES 7oz||4/23/25, 4/24/25| |PEANUT BUTTER SNACK MIX 12oz||11/13/24 – 12/22/24| |PEANUT BUTTER SNACK MIX TO GO 4.5oz||1/18/2025| |SNACKIN’ WITH THE CREW!

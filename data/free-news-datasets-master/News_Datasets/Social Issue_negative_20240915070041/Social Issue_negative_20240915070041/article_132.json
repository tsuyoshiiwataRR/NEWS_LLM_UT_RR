    "text": "The Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) has bowed to pressure from the public over misleading content in the Form Three Biology textbook. Concerned Kenyans had petitioned KICD to issue a public apology and review some content in a book titled Certificate Biology for Form Three learners in the 8-4-4 system of Education arguing that the content was misleading to the learners. Complaints to KICD highlight two sentences Critics argued that such content in a widely used textbook strengthens dangerous stereotypes and victim-blaming attitudes, potentially contributing to rape culture. “KICD has received a number of emails from various Kenyans expressing concerns about some content in the book,” said the KICD Chief Executive Officer Charles Ong’ondo. “In particular, the emails have expressed concern that two sentences in the book insinuate that rape can be caused by indecent dressing\" or that \"modesty and dress codes are effective in preventing rape,” he added. The content on page 170 of the book reads, \"Modest dress code and behaviour to avoid provoking or tempting other persons into sexual arousal. Many rape cases are due to such provocations. One should also avoid being alone with a person of the opposite sex in secluded areas to prevent losing one's control.” “Date rapes are even more common than rape by total strangers. Girls should be especially watchful in not having their drinks mixed with drugs or alcohol which cause them to lose control of their senses.\" Prof Ongo’ndo acknowledged that the sentences could be interpreted to suggest that indecent dressing is the main cause of rape and may also insinuate \"victim blaming\" in case of rape. “KICD offers an apology to readers who consider the quoted sentences in the book Certificate Biology for Form Three to be misleading, for not detecting this during the evaluation in 2005,” he said. “Concerned Kenyans have indicated that \"this narrative is not only misleading but also dangerous, as it perpetuates victim-blaming and reinforces rape culture,\" he added. Going forward, the CEO noted that the institute has formed a panel comprising curriculum development officers, quality assurance and standards officers, teachers and other relevant stakeholders to review the content of the book within two weeks. \"There was no intention whatsoever to justify rape under any circumstances; even as modest/decent dressing is encouraged among learners and the entire public, especially in the school context,\" he said. Prof Ong'ondo said the book was published by East African Educational Publishers (EAEP) in 2004, evaluated and approved by KICD, and listed in the Orange Book in 2005. A new edition of the book was printed and distributed to schools in 2018. Stay informed.

The schools will also be informed after the review on how to guide the learners on the relevant topic,\" said the KICD boss.",

    "text": "CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Police records from 2021 through July show violent crime has fallen in and around the University of Cincinnati campus this year. Crime remains an issue on campus. Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge said students should be vigilant when walking around campus. “If something doesn’t feel right in your gut, it’s probably not,” Theetge said. “So change the environment in which you’re in. Be with a friend, at least one or two friends while you’re walking.” FOX19 NOW looked at police records going back to 2021 and found motor vehicle thefts, menacing, felonious assault, burglary, rape and inducing panic are crimes that are regularly reported. Police reports in Clifton and on the UC campus reported the following as the top crimes in the area: - Ninety reported car thefts last year. Twenty-seven car thefts have been reported in Clifton this year while 24 thefts were reported on campus in the previous two years. - More than 50 assaults have been reported on the UC campus in the past two years. - Cincinnati’s CUF neighborhood reported 27 assaults in 2023, the same number reported in the neighborhood through July of this year. Theetge said the spike in Kia and Hyundai thefts has affected the numbers around UC. “Don’t leave your car running,” Theetge said. “Lock it up, take your keys with you. We have seen a spike over the last couple of years, most of them Kia and Hyundai thefts.” “Keeping all of our residents safe is our primary goal,” UC Chief of Police Eliot Isaac said. Students who spoke with FOX19 NOW said they felt safe on campus. They credited the visibility of campus police and security. “There is always police around and security,” student Luke Laufenberg said. “I feel safe when I’m out.” Jake Wisneski said students should know what areas to stay away from. “You have to know where and where not to go,” Wisneski said. “I would say after my first year I really do feel safe on campus.” Students are beginning to return to campus for the start of the 2024-2025 school year. The school year officially starts on Aug. 26. UC police said students and the public should be aware of more pedestrian traffic as students return. See a spelling or grammar error in our story?

    "text": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) - There will be no [Cincinnati Home + Garden Show](https://www.cincinnatihomeandgardenshow.com/information) next year due to the [ Duke Energy Convention Center closure](https://local12.com/news/local/work-begins-cincinnati-convention-center-expansion-renovation-hotel-commissioners-denise-drihaus-stephanie-dumas-summerow-alicia-reece-tourism-business-construction-tax-credits). The show will return in 2026, according to organizer Marketplace Events. Marketplace Events (MPE) tried to find another venue for the show but could not due to its space and logistical needs. “After an extensive search, we ultimately determined that alternate venue options did not provide adequate space nor dates suitable for us to run a two-weekend show” said Marketplace Events Vice Chairman Tom Baugh in a news release. “This led to our decision to wait until we could produce the high-quality show the Greater Cincinnati community knows and expects. We look forward to hosting a wonderful show in 2026.” MPE’s other local show, the Greater Cincinnati Holiday Market, will be held this year at the Sharonville Convention Center",

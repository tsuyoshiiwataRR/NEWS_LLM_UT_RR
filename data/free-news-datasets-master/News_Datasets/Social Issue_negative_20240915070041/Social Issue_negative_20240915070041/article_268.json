    "text": "At press conference, Hovde refused to answer questions about his personal wealth\nMADISON, Wis. — Yesterday, state Senator Kelda Roys and Representative Tip McGuire\ncalled out Eric Hovde for being an out-of-touch California bank owner and ‘ walking conflict of interest,’ who insults Wisconsinites every time he opens his mouth and won’t answer simple questions about which foreign entities are depositing money in his bank.\nJust hours after Sen. Roys and Rep. McGuire highlighted Hovde’s sketchy financial entanglements, Hovde\nrefused to answer a simple question about his net worth.\nFor weeks on end, Hovde has\ndodged questions about his net worth and conflicts of interest, hiding the truth about how he stands to profit if he were in the Senate.\nSee below for what Wisconsinites are seeing and reading about how Eric Hovde is a ‘walking conflict of interest:’\nWKOW: Democrats call Hovde ‘walking conflict of interest’\n- Democrats, state Senator Kelda Roys and Representative Tip McGuire, held a press conference Wednesday about Hovde’s nomination and think he isn’t telling the public enough about himself.\n- Roys and McGuire criticized Hovde, calling him a ‘walking conflict of interest’ and an out-of-touch California bank owner, since they say he has not lived in Wisconsin for the majority of his life.\n- Democrats also say they’re concerned that he has refused to reveal the amount of investments he’s received from foreign governments.\n- In Hovde’s press conference after the luncheon, he didn’t answer questions about his personal wealth.\nTMJ4: State Senator Kelda Roys on Hovde using his public position to benefit himself\n- State Senator Kelda Roys: ”We don’t want Hovde to be yet another national Republican blocking ethics reforms and using his public position to benefit himself.”\nWKOW: Hovde Denied Questions About His Personal Wealth\n- State Senator Kelda Roys: “How much is he worth, how much does he plan to profit from owning the bank, and how would he avoid being a walking conflict of interest?”\n- In Hovde’s press conference after that luncheon, he denied questions about his personal wealth.",

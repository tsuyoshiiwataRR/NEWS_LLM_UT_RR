    "text": "WASHINGTON â€” Taking care of America's military veterans is a sacred obligation. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has stated its top priority is providing the world-class care that veterans deserve. One key aspect of that is having the medical staff in place to fulfill the mission, as VA Secretary Denis McDonough told lawmakers back in May. \"No single investment is more critical to the veterans we serve and VA's future than the people we hire and retrain,\" he said. But a new report raises questions about the department's ability to meet its mission. The VA's Office of the Inspector General last week released its annual staffing shortage report. Of the 139 facilities surveyed, 137 reported at least one severe occupational staffing shortage. The five clinical occupations with the most frequent severe shortages are psychology, practical nurse, psychiatry, medical technologist and primary care. The report stated that 86% of facilities reported severe shortages of medical officers, and 82% reported a severe shortage of nurses. But the VA points out it had a record year for hiring in 2023, bringing on 61,000 new employees, and the department recorded 116 million health care appointments, surpassing the old record by 3 million. In a statement to 13 News Now, VA Press Secretary Terrence Hayes said: \"While VA needs to, and continues to, strategically hire in key areas and locations, the VA has the nationwide staffing total we need to deliver for our nation's veterans.\"",

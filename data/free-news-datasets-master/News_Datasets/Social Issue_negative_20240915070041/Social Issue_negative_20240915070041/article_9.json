    "text": "Scores of delivery drivers are set to protest in Limassol’s city centre on Friday, amid increasing attacks against them and allegations of police inaction.\nThe protest will begin at 11:30 at the old port and move towards molos.\nThis is the second time this week they will protest, as “the violence is still continuing and we need help,” Rajesh, a delivery driver working in Limassol told the Cyprus Mail.\nHe said it has become routine for delivery drivers to be ambushed by groups who steal the drivers’ money, phone, and sometimes their bike, under threat of a knife.\nAfter that “we get beaten up every time.”\nLeft helpless and stranded, Rajesh described dismissive attitudes from police officers when they try to report the incident.\n“We need support from locals.”\nWhen he himself went to report an attack, he said he was simply told “my friend just be careful. Don’t work in a dangerous area.”\nBeyond that not being enough, Rajesh stressed there is no longer a safe area in Limassol. Attacks often take place in the city centre uninterrupted.\nA video shared with the Cyprus Mail shows a delivery driver in Limassol abandoning his bike in the street as he is flanked and chased by a group of people on motorbikes who then drive off.\nWhile in the past the main issues were observed in Ypsonas and Ayia Fyla, it has now become common for robberies to unfold in spots such as Makariou and the city centre, according to Rajesh.\nEarlier this week Limassol police spokesperson Lefteris Kyriacou\nacknowledged the severity of the situation.\n“In the past month, we have received more complaints than usual from delivery drivers,” he said. “However, I want to make it clear that every time we receive such complaints and reports, we act immediately. They are unfortunately many, and we are doing our best to identify all perpetrators.”\nKyriacou also added that several arrests have been made in connection with the attacks on delivery drivers.\nThe issue however is far from new. Almost one year ago, delivery drivers spoke to the Cyprus Mail and pleaded “\nplease write about this.”\n“We are afraid. We are afraid to do our jobs. People wait for us in the dark and hit us, throw stones at us, they steal our money and bikes.”\nAt the time, the increasing violence had been connected to the\nracist violence which unfolded in Chlorakas and Limassol, targeting primarily Syrian nationals.\nAmnesty International had taken a stance on the matter, saying it was “responding to pogrom-like demonstrations and violent attacks against racialised people, including migrants and refugees, in Limassol and Chlorakas in recent weeks.”\nThe NGO’s migration researcher Adriana Tidona highlighted “the violent, racist attacks in Chlorakas and Limassol must serve as a wake-up call for authorities in Cyprus to take immediate measures to tackle racist rhetoric and abuse, which have been on the rise in the country for years.”\nLabour Minister Yiannis Panayiotou said at the time Cyprus’ economy\nwould collapse without migrants.\nThe latest US Department of State report on human rights published in April this year documented concerns related to racism in Cyprus including\nan increase in violent attacks against migrants.",

    "text": "Democrats Want Green Party Candidate Jill Stein Removed From Wisconsin Ballot\nPlenty of leftists blamed Stein for spoiling the election for failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n12 Comments\nThe Democrats\nwant to remove Green Party candidate Jill Stein from Wisconsin’s ballot.\nDavid Strange, as an individual and deputy operations director of Wisconsin for the DNC, filed the complaint, claiming the Wisconsin Green Party (WGP) did not “comply with Wisconsin’s election statutes.”\nThe August 13, 2024 primary was the last opportunity for WGP to nominate a candidate for Wisconsin Senate or Assembly before the 2024 general election. But, WGP failed to nominate any candidates for Wisconsin Senate or Assembly, and a sufficient number of electors did not nominate a candidate by writing in any WGP candidate for Wisconsin Senate or Assembly, according to the requirements of Wisconsin Statute section 8.16(2).\nThus, WGP conclusively has no candidates for Wisconsin Senate or Assembly in the general election, nor are there currently any WGP state officeholders or holdover senators. Consequently, no individual will be authorized under Wisconsin Statute section 8.18 to nominate presidential electors to represent WGP when the nomination meeting is held on the first Tuesday of October.\nWGP’s presidential ticket is therefore ineligible and unqualified to appear on the ballot for the November 2024 general election.\nPlenty of leftists\nblamed Stein for spoiling the election for failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.\nStein\nreceived 31,000 votes in Wisconsin in 2016, but President Donald Trump beat Clinton in the state by only 22,000 votes.\nI know the Democrats pressured Ralph Nader not to run in 2000 and 2004.\nThe Republicans hated Ross Perot.\n“We take the nomination process for President and Vice President very seriously and believe every candidate should follow the rules,”\nsaid Adrienne Watson, a senior adviser to the DNC, according to WisPolitics.com. “Because the Wisconsin Green Party hasn’t fielded candidates for legislative or statewide office and doesn’t have any current incumbent legislative or statewide office holders, it cannot nominate candidates and should not be on the ballot in November.”\nThe Wisconsin Elections Commission\napproved a spot on the ballot for the Green Party in February.\n“This is a fishing expedition conjured up by the DNC, and is in line with their statements back in March that they will hire an army of lawyers and infiltrators to find any angle of attack to prevent Green Party ballot access,”\ndeclared Jason Call, Stein’s campaign manager. “We absolutely will be hiring counsel to defend our ballot line in Wisconsin.” ",

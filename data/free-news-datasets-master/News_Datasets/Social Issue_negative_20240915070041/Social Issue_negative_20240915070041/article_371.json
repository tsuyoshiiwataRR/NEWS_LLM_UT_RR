    "text": "Press Release Bronx Resident Arrested For Possessing Automatic Weapons And Machinegun Conversion Devices Thursday, August 15, 2024 Share Facebook X LinkedIn Email For Immediate Release U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Edward A. Caban, the Commissioner of the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”), announced today the arrest of FAREED DABIDAH for possessing numerous fully automatic firearms, semi-automatic firearms, silencers, and dozens of machinegun conversion devices in the Bronx. DABIDAH was arrested this morning and will be presented later today in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah L. Cave.\nU.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “As alleged, Fareed Dabidah built dozens of ghost guns – some by using 3D printing – at his apartment in the Bronx. He allegedly converted many of the ghost guns into fully automatic weapons and had everything he needed to convert many more. Machinegun conversion devices, like the 39 the defendant possessed, are particularly dangerous gun accessories that turn ordinary firearms into fully automatic weapons. Removing these extraordinarily dangerous devices from our streets is an important law enforcement goal, and this Office will keep working diligently with our law enforcement partners to keep these devices and other illegal guns out of New York City.”\nNYPD Commissioner Edward A. Caban said: “NYPD investigators’ meticulous work in this case underscores our efforts to eradicate gun violence by stopping homemade, untraceable ghost guns and other illegal firearms from ever reaching New York City streets. I thank our federal colleagues for their partnership and their continued dedication to our shared public safety mission.”\nAccording to the allegations in the Complaint: 1\nBeginning as early as October 2022, DABIDAH ordered from various online retailers the components needed to 3D print and assemble numerous privately made firearms, which are commonly referred to as “ghost guns.” On August 15, 2024, law enforcement agents conducted a search of DABIDAH’s apartment, pursuant to a judicially authorized search warrant. During the execution of the warrant, law enforcement officers found, among other things, approximately 39 machinegun conversion devices; 14 completed ghost guns, including six with machinegun conversion devices installed; five partially assembled, 3D printed assault rifles, including two with machinegun conversion devices installed; two firearms silencers; two 3D printers; and various magazines and ammunition for use in the recovered firearms.\nA “machinegun conversion device” is an item that converts a semi-automatic firearm into a fully automatic weapon by circumventing the weapon’s intended cycle. Colloquially, machinegun conversion devices for handguns are frequently referred to as “Glock switches” and ones for assault rifles are referred to as “auto sears.” Federal law prohibits the unlicensed possession of machineguns, a term that includes machinegun conversion devices.\nThe photographs below show many of the firearms recovered during the search of DABIDAH’s residence this morning, including 3D printed handguns and assault rifles, and a handgun and assault rifle with machinegun conversion devices installed.\n3D Printed Handguns and Assault Rifles\n9mm Ghost Gun with Glock Switch\nAssault Rifle with Auto Sear\n* * *\nDABIDAH, 22, of the Bronx, New York, is charged with one count of possession of a machinegun, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 10 years in prison.\nThe maximum potential sentence is prescribed by Congress and provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.\nMr. Williams praised the outstanding work the NYPD and further thanked the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; U.S. Postal Inspection Service; U.S. Customs and Border Protection; and Homeland Security Investigations for their assistance in the investigation.\nThe case is being handled by the Office’s Violent and Organized Crime Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Jones is in charge of the prosecution.\nThe charges contained in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.",

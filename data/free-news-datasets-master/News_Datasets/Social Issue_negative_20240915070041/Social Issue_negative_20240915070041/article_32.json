    "text": "Richmond’s new Sandston post office is moving up the ladder, albeit slowly. Once the worst in the nation for delivering First-Class Mail, the Virginia postal region is now only fourth-worst. That’s according to performance data updated this week by a watchdog agency that monitors the U.S. Postal Service . The numbers suggest that Richmond's mail service is rebounding, even while other postal regions across the U.S. experience their own performance declines. People are also reading… In the first few months of 2024, the Postal Service in Virginia had a 66% on-time delivery rate for First-Class Mail, indicating the percentage of that category of mail delivered within a two-day window. In the spring, that score increased to 77%. This week’s data charts Virginia's rating at 78%. That’s the score for two-day delivery of First-Class Mail sent through Virginia between April and June of this year. The Postal Service is in the throes of a nationwide transformation. The agency is a year into its plan to make the agency financially solvent, an initiative spearheaded by Postmaster Louis DeJoy, a Trump-era appointee. The plan focuses on consolidating the agency’s network of post offices, as well as refocusing on package delivery. The makeover was initially calculated to save USPS’ Virginia operations $186 million over 10 years. Virginia was the first postal region in the country to be revamped under the plan. Shortly after, the region’s on-time delivery rate dropped from 85% to the 66% figure. The tracking numbers come from the Office of the Inspector General for the Postal Service, one of two watchdog agencies that monitors the Postal Service. 'Virginians deserve far better' Virginia lawmakers have previously said the marginal improvements will not suffice . “Virginians deserve far, far better than the fourth-worst mail delivery in the nation,\" said Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-7th. \"I continue to hear from Virginians who are experiencing unacceptable mail service and delivery issues, such as bills arriving past-due, packages getting stuck in an endless loop of trips in and out of the Richmond RPDC, and checks getting lost in the mail.\" Spanberger said mail delivery continues to be \"indefensible.\" The agency has set a target goal of 93% on-time delivery for First-Class Mail. “It should be in the low 90s,” Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-4th, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch in May. McClellan likened the marginal improvements to going from an “F” to an “F-plus.” Rep. Rob Wittman, R-1st, echoed that sentiment. “I’m happy that they’re making progress, but they’re not where they need to be,” Wittman said. “They’re giving us lots of metrics, but the metric that matters is what customers see.” “We’ve asked them to hold a town hall and, at first they said no, but now they’re talking like they’re going to do it,” he added. Sen. Tim Kaine said that when he and others from the congressional delegation sat down with Postmaster General DeJoy in early July, “He said: I apologize, we really screwed up.” “We're not near where we want to be, but we can see the gap closing,” Kaine said. “One other thing I've been noticing is because people call our office with complaints, I can track, oh, how many people complain about the post office this month, last month, month before. We're seeing the number of complaints dramatically down, although they are staying high in and around Charlottesville.” 'Transformational change is critical' The Postal Service has repeatedly declined to make Richmond postal managers or administrators available for interviews to talk about the transition occurring in Sandston. In April, however, an audit from the same inspector general’s office dove into detail on problems occurring at the Sandston facility. The auditors found operational failures and millions in unexpected costs . In response to questions on the Postal Service’s performance standards in Virginia, a spokesperson for the agency directed The Times-Dispatch to comments made in response to that audit , which were fielded on March 22 of this year. In those comments, a group of USPS vice presidents wrote that Sandston’s growing pains were temporary but necessary, given that business as usual prior to the Delivering for America plan “persistently failed to meet our service performance targets.” “Transformational change is critical, it is also never easy, even when it is for the better, particularly when considering an organization that is the size of the Postal Service, and whose current network and operating practices are so misaligned,” wrote USPS executives Dane Coleman, Robert Cintron, Steve Dearing, Elvin Mercado and Todd Hawkins. Both auditors and the executives agreed on the wisdom of using the avoidable mistakes made in Richmond as a template for future states, many of which will or are currently undergoing similar overhauls. That includes states like Georgia, Wisconsin and Texas. The Atlanta mail region was overhauled according to the Delivering for America plan shortly after Richmond. Atlanta is currently worst in the country for on-time delivery of First-Class Mail, with a 40% score. The on-time delivery rate nationwide also dropped within the same most recent period. During this same period last year, USPS’ nationwide score for First-Class Mail was 91.8%. This year, the average stands at 85.6%, a 6.2% decrease. A national issue Many legislators have viewed those low scores as a mark of little confidence in Postmaster DeJoy. In June, Spanberger wrote a letter to President Joe Biden requesting he fill a final vacancy on the USPS Board of Governors, which has the authority to appoint or remove the USPS Postmaster. \"Under the tenure of the current Postmaster General, the American people have seen our most beloved federal agency grossly mismanaged, undermined, and nearly destroyed. Virginians have suffered some of the worst consequences of Postmaster General DeJoy’s detrimental policy changes in the past year,” Spanberger wrote. Steve Hutkins, a retired New York University professor who now chronicles USPS issues on his “Save the Post Office” website, previously told The Times-Dispatch that spotty, unreliable mail delivery has become a national issue as DeJoy rolls out big changes. “Things are just not working as planned. They’re making big changes faster than the network can keep up with it, and it’s not even clear how long this will go on and what the outcome will be when it’s all over,” Hutkins told The Times-Dispatch in March.

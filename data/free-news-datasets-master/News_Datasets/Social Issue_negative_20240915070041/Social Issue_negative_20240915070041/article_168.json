    "text": "Getty Image\nFanatics’ Michael Rubin is walking back his comments on black culture.\nEarlier this week, Rubin went viral on social media when he went on the Breakfast Club and made comments criticizing black culture while defending his friend Meek Mill.\n“Look, I’m just being blunt. It’s me, It’s the one thing I’ve learned about Black culture that I don’t like is that Black hate on hate.”\n“I think there’s a little bit of Black culture where it’s Black hate on hate. It’s like that Black judge that Meek had, that hated on him and want to go extra hard on him. Okay. I, it’s what people always say to me. It’s like black hate on hate, so I think it’s terrible. It’s something that I think it’s culturally wrong and I’ll probably get killed for saying this.”\nHow do y'all feel about Fanatics founder, Michael Rubin saying this about Black culture? pic.twitter.com/ZFCgMp2S78\n— Yours in negritude, Ryan K. Smith. (@MeWeFree_) August 14, 2024\nA day after going viral, Rubin apologized for making the remarks.\n“I got a phone call from one of the people I have the most respect for in the world – they told me while they appreciate my intention, it’s not my place to speak on black culture. I get it and really appreciate the input!”\n“My intention was to say how important it is that we need to uplift each other, stop hate on each other, and push each other to win, and always root for each other’s success!”\n“My bad , Much love and appreciate the feedback”\nMeek Mill also commented on Rubin’s rant.\nRubin shouldn’t be saying that type stuff out loud … a black man suppose to but nobody saying it… Its like we only collab on songs women and parties… he be hearing my friends getting murdered like why meek, I can’t explain it to him in a sensible way!\n— MeekMill (@MeekMill) August 15, 2024",

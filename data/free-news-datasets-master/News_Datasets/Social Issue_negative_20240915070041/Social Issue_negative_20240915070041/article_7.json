    "text": "MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Ohio (WKEF) – Law enforcement agencies all over Montgomery County are promoting traffic safety. They are primarily cracking down on those who drive under the influence. The Montgomery County Sheriff's Office is working with Ohio State Patrol and police departments from several cities to reduce traffic-related crimes. They are doing this by implementing sobriety checkpoints, establishing a joint traffic enforcement detail, and displaying how they are taking part in “The National Drive Sober Or Get Pulled Over Campaign.” “We don’t want to have to go knock on that door and tell somebody that their family member is not coming home because of an impaired driver,” said Captain Andy Flagg of the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office. “You know, it happens quite often, more often than any of us would like, in Montgomery County, in the state of Ohio, and across the nation.” On August 16th, the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office, as well as many other agencies, will begin taking part in “The National Drive Sober Or Get Pulled Over Campaign.” In 2023, there were 512 OVI related crashes in Montgomery County with 43 of them resulting in death. Law enforcement is aiming to reduce these numbers for 2024 by raising awareness, educating the public, and setting up sobriety checkpoints at several places throughout the county. Flagg continued, “When you take somebody that likes to drive fast, or without turn signals, or other little things, and you add impairment into that, it kind of emphasizes those problems. You come out with far more severe results.” As well as reinforcing sober driving, the agencies in Montgomery County formed a joint traffic enforcement detail along Interstate 75 and State Route 48. This detail will involve the County Sheriff’s Office, Ohio State Patrol, and police departments from Dayton, Vandalia, Moraine, and many other cities. With this detail, their goal is to reduce traffic related crimes in these areas and promote collaboration between departments to ensure that all county roads are safer. “For the purpose of collaborating and filling the roles that need to be filled in these particular campaigns, we’re trying to make sure that we are making a safe county,” Flagg added. The National Drive Sober Or Get Pulled Over Campaign” begins on August 16th, and will run all the way through September 2nd.",

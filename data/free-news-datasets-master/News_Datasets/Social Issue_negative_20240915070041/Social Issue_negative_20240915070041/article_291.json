Zelensky confirmed the call, during which he congratulated Trump on formally becoming the Republican Party's presidential nominee, as well as wishing the 78-year-old well after an attempt on his life a week ago. \"We agreed with President Trump to discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting,\" Zelensky said in a post on X.

[Kim Kardashian's woven braids spark Founding Father comparisons](https://www.panorama.am/en/shortNews/2024/06/25/Kim-Kardashian/3021224) Kim Kardashian’s latest hairstyle has seemingly taken inspiration from America’s Founding Fathers, according to fans. The Skims founder, 43, took to Instagram on June 23 to debut a new look. In a carousel of photos, Kardashian’s platinum blonde hair was woven into basket braid pigtails. The reality TV star went makeup free in the photos, pairing her braided hairstyle with a sheer tank top and nude leggings, [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/kim-kardashian-woven-braids-hair-b2568077.html?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR3svvdDOZf2TnZs7SwpQykx_WXkigLPer4h9t4c-jqIqI4PmoKLbaP4kIM_aem_A-BbF_EhZDf3E_jI3vu7tw#Echobox=1719291424) reported. While the Keeping Up with the Kardashians alum has been known to wear some avante-garde and futuristic ensembles, some fans believed her newest look resembled a powdered wig from the 18th century. “What in the constitution is going on here?” one Instagram user commented under the post. “Ok George Washington,” another fan joked. “It’s giving… Founding Father,” said someone else, while another person quipped: “She getting ready to write the Declaration of Independence.” Kardashian’s woven braids were crafted by her longtime hairstylist Chris Appleton, who she tagged in her Instagram post. Appleton posted photos of the entrepreneur’s basket braids to his own Instagram, simply captioning his post with three silver chain link emojis. This isn’t the first time the mother of four has shocked fans with a dramatic hair transformation. In 2015, Kardashian debuted her now-signature bleach blonde hair for the first time at Paris Fashion Week. The Kardashians star went back to her natural dark brown locks on-and-off for several years, before undergoing a 14-hour hair transformation to channel Marilyn Monroe at the 2022 Met Gala. [Kim Kardashian admits she hid in bathroom to escape her sreaming kids](https://www.panorama.am/en/shortNews/2024/06/06/Kim-Kardashian/3012868) Kim Kardashian has revealed she was forced to lock herself in a bathroom to escape the wrath of her four kids, [The Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/kim-kardashian-forced-hide-bathroom-32971474) reports. Kim shares her offspring with ex-husband Kanye West. She’s a doting mum to North, 10, Saint, eight, Chicago, six, and Psalm, five. In new scenes from her Disney+ show The Kardashians, the 43-year-old Skims founder admitted she “couldn’t believe” the way her kids were behaving. Sitting in a car while on the way to jury duty, Kim was seen chatting on the phone to an unnamed friend when she began to vent about her children, confessing she was a “push over” when it came to her kids. “Hey can I vent for one sec? It’s been an extra troubling week where I was just like I can’t do it anymore,” Kim began, adding: “I just… anything in that home is just chaotic right now. Oh my God, no, what I wanted to say was I had a Zoom at the house with all my kids there, banging on the door, just screaming, and I was literally hiding in a bathroom with the door locked as I was just like, I can’t believe this. I mean I can believe it, but that’s like my biggest nightmare.” Elaborating on her parenting techniques in a confessional, Kim told cameras: “Sometimes it gets, just like a little intense. I want to be more strict like Khloe but I don’t know why I have a hard time just saying no is no. I think I also just don’t want to deal with the whining and the tears of not getting their way.” “They know when to con me and when to throw the little, you know, start with the tears so I’m like, ‘Stop, stop, sure, take an iPad,’ you know, just stop. I just have to be like, ‘I don’t care if you’re gonna throw a tantrum in front of everyone right now. The answer is no’,” Kim noted. Kim’s family drama comes after she showcased her dramatic weight loss as she slipped into one of Janet Jackson's iconic outfits. The reality star-turned-lawyer purchased Janet's outfit from the iconic 1993 music video for her single, If, three years ago at an auction. Kim spent a whopping $25,000 (£19,571) on the costume back in 2021, explaining she was \"such a fan\". At the time, Kim took to her Instagram Stories saying: \"For @janetjackson's bday bc I'm such a fan I can't believe I won this on juliens_auctions. Happy birthday queen!\" [EUMA welcomes visitors from Dutch Police](https://www.panorama.am/en/shortNews/2024/06/04/EUMA/3011796) The EU Mission in Armenia (EUMA) on Monday welcomed the Dutch Police delegation. “Happy to welcome visitors from the Dutch Police today in Yeghegnadzor.

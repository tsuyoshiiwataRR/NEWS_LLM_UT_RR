(WTOC) -Teams from the Federal Emergency Management Agency are scattered throughout Bryan, Chatham, Effingham, Bulloch and Screven counties assessing damage from Debby’s floodwaters. It’s a key step toward getting possible federal relief aid for flood victims. “They will see what we’ve been telling them the damage is. They will then report back to their FEMA administrator. Then we will put together a letter for the governor to send to the president,” said field coordinator for the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency. If the assessed damage is deemed eligible for federal help, GEMA officials say Governor Brian Kemp will send a letter to President Joe Biden. At that point, individual or public federal disaster relief may become available. “...it’s just a waiting game,” Gray told reporters during a news conference Wednesday. It’s where that aid will come from that has some concerned. FEMA announced its disaster relief fund has run out of money – now only being used for “lifesaving and life-sustaining activities.” “We are getting toward the end of the fiscal year and this normally does happen,” said Georgia’s 1st District Congressman Buddy Carter. He says Congress is expected to take up FEMA funding when lawmakers return next month. He notes that this was a measure lawmakers did not vote on before going into recess but does not think it will cause a delay in potential aid for flood victims. “In this case, we are going to have to have some supplemental funding in order to get FEMA through,” said Rep. Carter. As the federal disaster aid process plays out, Bryan County leaders have advice for flood-weary residents. “Document your damages. Take pictures because when it comes down to it, if we do get the natural disaster declaration, we can enter it into that system to get more assistance from FEMA,” said Board of Commissioners Chairman Carter Infinger. On Thursday, Governor Kemp extended Georgia’s state of emergency for an additional five days. Bryan County leaders also extended a state of local emergency for another thirty days.

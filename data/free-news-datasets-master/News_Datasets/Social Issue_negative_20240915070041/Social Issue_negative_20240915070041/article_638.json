    "text": "Bangor Public Works falls behind on road painting BANGOR, Maine (WABI) - Bangor Public Works is running behind on their pavement painting. As paint needs to be reapplied after every winter, Public Works has been working during the dry times. The project was divided between two contractors. One was responsible for line work, covering road lines and and dotted line in the roads. And one covering the stencil work for areas such as arrows and crosswalks. Both have faced challenges with equipment and labor issues over the last few months. And now, painting deadlines are falling behind. ”We’re exploring other options to help them out in terms of getting a second contractor and just to try to get that up. We’re coming up against school, start of school. So of course, we need to have those crosswalks all freshly painted so the students can safely cross streets. And just in general, I mean Aug. 1th is the is the deadline for all our stenciling, and we’re, at this point, Aug. 13th, or 14th, today? And I think we’re at about 34% of all, stencils, have been completed, which is, which is quite low,” said Aaron Huotari, director of Bangor Public Works. Huotari added that they expect the long-line painting to be completed this week. Copyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",

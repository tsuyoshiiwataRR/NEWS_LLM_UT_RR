    "text": "international plot to cripple india? aiba calls for full-scale investigation of hindenburg research report The All India Bar Association (AIBA) on Wednesday called for a comprehensive investigation into the possible international conspiracy surrounding the recent Hindenburg report. Speaking to the media, AIBA Chairman and Senior Advocate Dr Adish C Aggarwala urged the Indian government to launch a thorough 360-degree probe to uncover the truth behind the allegations. Dr Aggarwala, who is also the former President of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and Vice-Chairman of the Bar Council of India, called for a thorough investigation into the credibility of the Hindenburg report and its potential impact on India&#039;s economy. He suggested that the report might be part of a deliberate effort by hostile forces to destabilise India&#039;s economic progress, especially at a time when neighbouring countries are struggling with economic instability and civil unrest. Dr Aggarwala argued that the report, which he believes was crafted with malicious intent, aims to undermine confidence in India&#039;s financial system and harm the nation&#039;s economic interests. He also dismissed Hindenburg&#039;s allegations against SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband, Dhaval Buch, as baseless and lacking substance. Highlighting the controversy sparked by Hindenburg&#039;s previous allegations against the Adani Group, which led to a significant drop in the company&#039;s stock prices, Dr Aggarwala questioned the credibility of Hindenburg as an entity. He emphasised that if the report contained concrete evidence, it should have been pursued in court, noting that the Supreme Court had previously found no merit in Hindenburg&#039;s claims. Both the Adani Group and SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch have denied the latest allegations made by Hindenburg. SEBI has also advised investors to remain calm, pointing out that Hindenburg&#039;s report includes a disclaimer suggesting that the firm may hold short positions in the securities mentioned, potentially influencing its findings.

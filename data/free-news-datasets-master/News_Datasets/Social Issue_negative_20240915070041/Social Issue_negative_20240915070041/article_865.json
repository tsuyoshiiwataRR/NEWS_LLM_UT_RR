    "text": "[]https://www.cheknews.ca/union-confirms-victoria-firefighter-was-suspended-for-1-day-over-open-letter-about-safety-1219174/\nThe union that represents Victoria firefighters has confirmed that a firefighter was suspended for one day without pay due to an open letter he penned asking B.C.’s premier to block a new homeless services facility from opening amid safety concerns in the city.\nIt was a decision that B.C. Premier David Eby says he’d like overturned.\nOn Wednesday, Tim Thielmann – BC Conservatives candidate for Victoria-Beacon Hill – levelled explosive accusations against the City of Victoria and provincial government, claiming that sources from within the fire department had told him that firefighter Josh Montgomery had been suspended for writing the open letter.\nThe letter called on Eby to stop the city from opening a\n new homeless services facility at Dowler Place, near to where he lives.\nThe letter was written days after a\n paramedic was assaulted along the 900-block of Panodra Avenue, and Montgomery said that as a first responder he feared that similar safety risks would grow around the new Dowler Place facility.\nREAD THE FULL LETTER:\n Opinion: A first responder’s letter to Premier Eby demanding action in Victoria\nEby responds\nThielmann called out the city and province for having a potential hand in Montgomery’s suspension, adding that he was told specifically that the mayor and city manager were involved.\nOn Wednesday, both levels of government denied the accusations, and on Thursday the premier took it a step further, saying he doesn’t want Montgomery to face any repercussions for writing the letter.\n“I don’t think that people should face any consequence for writing to me, telling me what they’re seeing in their communities,” he told CHEK News. “In fact, this letter was helpful to me to hear about his concerns and his community, which were very real concerns.”\nEby says he’s thankful for Montgomery’s input, and that he hopes the Victoria Fire Department reverses its decision to suspend him, or offer him back pay if the one-day suspension goes through.\n“Whether it’s one day or 10 minutes, it doesn’t matter,” he said.\n“I want to thank him for writing to me, and if that’s the reason he faces sanction then he should get an apology from whoever’s decision it was to remove him.”\nThe premier added that he has reached out to the firefighters union to see if there’s anything he can do to help appeal the decision.\n“…a letter of support or a letter of appreciation for reaching out to me that might assist in them appealing this decision, and I expect to hear back from them.”\nMeanwhile, the City of Victoria said Wednesday that, “to be clear, mayor and council have no role in the operational decisions of the Victoria Fire Department.”\n“This is a personnel matter and the city won’t be commenting further.”\nStephen Andrews, a former Victoria councillor, was moderating a virtual townhall for Thielmann on Tuesday when news of the Montgomery’s suspension first came to light.\nAndrews was the one who flagged the development to Theilman, and tells CHEK News that his information came from sources within the Victoria firefighters union.\n“My sources inside the union say the membership is very upset about this, that they’re very angry and that it’s retribution for his letter to David Eby,” he said Thursday.\n“My suspicion is the city probably takes a position that he was speaking for the city or he was speaking as a Victoria firefighter, which never happened. He always spoke as a North Park resident and as a first responder, he never mentioned that he was an employee of the City of Victoria,” said Andrews. “So how are they going to make that stretch? I think they’re going to have a bit of a hard time with that.”\nREAD ALSO:\n‘No transparency’: Neighbours worried about new North Park homeless facility voice concerns North Park residents protest Victoria city hall’s plans for new homeless services site\nAndrews added that while the city said that mayor and council have no say in Victoria Fire Department operational decisions, he says their statement hasn’t quelled his suspicions.\n“That statement was very specific, saying mayor and council is not involved in operations. That doesn’t mean they weren’t consulted or weren’t informed,” he said.\nWhen asked for a statement Thursday, the city reiterated to CHEK News that it “does not comment on personnel matters.”\nNew union response\nOn Thursday, the International Association of Fire Fighters Local 730 said in a statement that Montgomery had in fact been suspended for one day without pay for writing the open letter.\n“There has been misinformation that has been circulated amongst the public regarding employment matters with one of our members,” reads the statement.\n“Local 730 can confirm that a member, Josh Montgomery, was disciplined for his opinions shared in a letter to Premier Eby. He was suspended without pay for one day. That day is Friday, August 16th. There is a process to be followed under the collective agreement and that has been initiated.”\nOn Wednesday, employment lawyer Dan Balkaran said that whatever discipline Montgomery may face would likely be outlined in the union’s collective agreement.\nBalkaran says he has no insight into the union’s specific collective agreement, but says that if Montgomery were a private employee, the letter likely wouldn’t be enough to see him fired without severance, also known as terminated for just cause.\n“For something like this, if there’s a specific clause in the collective bargaining agreement in the contract that prohibits the employee from voicing views publicly on social media and other places, then maybe it could be – but generally speaking for something like this if it was an individual employee, given the level of egregiousness being low, I can’t see that employer being able to terminate that employee for just cause,” he said.\nREAD PREVIOUS:\n BC Conservatives candidate claims Victoria firefighter suspended over open letter voicing safety concerns\nWith files from CHEK’s Rob Shaw and Oli Herrera",

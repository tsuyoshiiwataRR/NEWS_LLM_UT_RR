    "text": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip – More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, the territory’s Health Ministry said Thursday.\nIsrael’s offensive has also wounded 92,401 people and displaced over 85% of the population from their homes, the\nministry in Hamas-run Gaza said. It does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its toll.\nThe announcement came during yet another push from international mediators to broker a cease-fire in the war, now in its 11th month.\nThe conflict began Oct. 7 after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people — most of them civilians — and dragging roughly 250 hostages to Gaza.\nIsrael says 111 of the captives have not been released, including the bodies of 39. The hostages include 15 women and two children under the age of 5.\nIn Gaza, health officials have\nstruggled to fully identify the dead as bodies stream into overwhelmed hospitals and morgues where they say the count is compiled amid the chaos of war and displacement.\nIn its most recent detailed\nreport on the dead, issued Thursday, the ministry said 40,005 people have been killed. Health officials and civil defense workers say the true toll is likely thousands higher, since many bodies remain buried under the rubble of buildings destroyed in airstrikes.\nIsrael’s air and ground offensive in Gaza has been one of the\nmost devastating military campaigns in recent history.\nThe bombardment and shelling have killed\nentire Palestinian families. With cemeteries often unreachable, families fleeing Israeli airstrikes bury their dead wherever possible — in backyards, along roadsides and under the staircases of their homes.\nIsrael says it aims to eliminate Hamas. It blames Hamas for civilian deaths because militants operate in civilian areas and have built extensive tunnel networks underneath them. Israeli forces have regularly targeted\nmosques, schools, hospitals and cemeteries where it claims fighters or tunnels are located, often causing civilian casualties.\nThe fighting has also killed 329 Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military claims around 15,000 Hamas fighters are among those killed in Gaza but has not provided evidence.\nNearly 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes, fleeing multiple times across the territory to escape ground offensives. During the war, thousands within Israel and in southern Lebanon have also been displaced.\nThe assault has created a massive humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The entire territory is at high risk of famine and over 495,000 people — more than a fifth of the population — are expected to experience the most severe level of hunger in the next months, according to the\nlatest report by the leading authority on measuring hunger.\nSanitation systems have been destroyed, leaving\npools of sewage and towers of garbage in tent camps packed with displaced families.\nThe offensive likely either damaged or destroyed 59% of all structures in Gaza by July 3, including 70% of buildings in north Gaza, according to an analysis of satellite data by Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek, experts in mapping damage during war.\nThe conflict has sparked fears of a wider regional war, with Lebanon’s Hezbollah and the Israeli military trading fire almost daily over their countries’ border.\nMore than 500 people have been killed on the Lebanese side, including some 350 Hezbollah members and 50 fighters from other militant groups, with the rest civilians. In Israel, 22 soldiers and 24 civilians have been killed.\nFrankel reported from Jerusalem.",

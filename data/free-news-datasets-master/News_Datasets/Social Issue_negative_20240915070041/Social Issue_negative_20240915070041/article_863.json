    "text": "After 9/11, the Afghan Muslim immigrant was interrogated by the FBI and asked about her background.\nThere’s an old joke about CBS News bringing out a Marxist to represent the Sandinista position and then Senator John Kerry to also represent the Sandinista position.\nKamala has managed to top that by bringing out Ilan Goldenberg , a career anti-Israel activist who\nadvocated for a deal in which “Hamas would retain some of its military capabilities” as her liaison to the Jewish community.\nAnd now Kamala introduced Nasrina Bargzie, whom Freedom Center Investigates profiled on August 9th as her Muslim liaison .\nThis way, Kamala has a Jewish liaison who hates Israel and a Muslim liaison who hates Israel.\nNasrina Bargzie is a piece of work with a lot of unanswered questions about her background which after September 11 were being asked by the FBI.\nAfter 9/11, Nasrina Bargzie, an Afghan Muslim immigrant, was interviewed by law enforcement over troubling comments on the War on Terror reported by her friends. Bargzie revealed that she had been interrogated by the FBI and “was asked by the agent about her family history and background.”\nShe became a legal fellow at the ACLU and joined its lawfare machine to dismantle our national security defenses against Islamic terrorism. In 2008, she posted about “wearing orange”at the Today Show in solidarity with the Al Qaeda, Taliban and other terrorists being held at Gitmo.\nAnd yes there’s the inevitable Islamist warfare and antisemitism.\nIn 2011 she joined the Asian Law Caucus and went to war against Jewish students facing antisemitic harassment. In 2010, Jessica Felber, a Jewish student, had been assaulted by a leader of the Students for Justice in Palestine campus hate group, and filed suit against UC Berkeley for tolerating an atmosphere of hate by activists linked to terrorist organizations. .\nNasrina Bargzie accused Jewish students and organizations of “organized legal bullying” for suing universities. She ridiculed the idea that calling for the destruction of Israel was “threatening” and co-signed a petition claiming that the lawsuit by Jewish students was “threatening” the speech of Berkeley Students for Justice in Palestine and the Berkeley Muslim Students Association.\nJewish students, she argued, were the “aggressors” and rejected the idea that there was anything “anti-semitic” about the campus hate groups and their ties to Islamic terrorism.\nNasrina Bargzie was so desperate that she presented a request to the UN Human Rights Commission, a group often stocked with Islamic terrorist states, to intervene and stop the Department of Education from investigating “allegations of anti-Semitism on several campuses”.\nHatem Bazian, the co-founder of Students for Justice in Palestine and the godfather of campus antisemitism, would later thank Nasrina and others, for “being constantly engaged in everything related to Palestine”. Alongside her was Zahra Billoo, the local head of CAIR, with whom Nasrina Bargzie had co-signed the letter, who would defend Hezbollah and Hamas.\nObviously this is a horrendous pick, but also notably, Kamala just promoted two of the extremists already in her inner circle instead of finding properly qualified people. This does not bode well for her ability to run a campaign and is exactly why both her original campaign and VP office imploded.",

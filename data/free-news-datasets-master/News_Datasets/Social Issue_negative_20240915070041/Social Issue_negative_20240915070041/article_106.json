    "text": "We, the consumers of news, are losing faith in journalism. Sensationalism, partisan bias, and corporate interests have left many of us questioning the credibility of the information we receive. The rise of clickbait and the blurring of lines between news and opinion have only deepened our mistrust. In a time when facts and truth are more critical than ever, we demand journalism that fulfills its highest purpose: to inform the public, empower citizens, and safeguard democracy. 1. To Inform and Educate: Journalism’s primary role is to provide factual, verified information that helps citizens understand the events that shape their lives. Whether it’s the economy, public health, social justice, or climate change, we need clear, accurate reporting to navigate the complexities of modern life. 2. To Safeguard Democracy: A healthy democracy depends on a well-informed electorate. Journalism empowers voters to make choices based on truth rather than propaganda or misinformation. Without reliable reporting, our democratic processes wither, and corruption thrives unchecked. 3. To Hold Power Accountable: Journalism serves as a watchdog, exposing abuses of power, corruption, and injustice. It keeps the powerful—whether in government, business, or other institutions—in check by ensuring transparency and accountability. Journalism must therefore be courageous, willing to anger the powerful and risk its own standing in the pursuit of truth. The duty to hold those in power accountable transcends any individual interest. 1. News organizations must prioritize information that impacts democracy, public health, and the general well-being of the nation and the world. Investigative reporting that exposes threats to these values must be given prominence over sensationalism and distraction. 2. We demand news that is rooted in fact, free of bias or editorialization. Journalism must distinguish clearly between reporting and opinion, and avoid favoring any political party, candidate, or agenda. The truth, not partisanship, should be the guiding principle. 3. Elevate stories that affect our lives, whether local or global. Avoid the temptations that distract from informing the public about critical issues—clickbait, lazy bothsiderism, or making elections about the horserace rather than the issues or the demonstrable character of the candidates. 4. We demand that journalism be walled off from the personal or business interests of the owners. The integrity of reporting should never be compromised by financial gain, corporate interests, or the political agendas of media proprietors. Journalism must serve the public, not the pockets of the powerful. 5. When mistakes happen, as they inevitably will, we demand swift corrections, retractions, and apologies. Accountability builds trust, and trust is the foundation of any meaningful relationship between journalists and the public. We, the consumers, need journalism that respects our intelligence and our role in a functioning democracy. We expect journalists to deliver truth without bias, to elevate stories of substance, and to act with integrity and transparency. In return, we will support journalism that holds power accountable, informs our decisions, and contributes to the health of our democracy. . Co-signed:",

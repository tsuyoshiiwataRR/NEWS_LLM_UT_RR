    "text": "Joe Rogan and Dennis Quaid Claim Hollywood 'Blackballs' Conservatives [Joe Rogan](https://okmagazine.com/t/joe-biden/) referred to [Hollywood](https://okmagazine.com/t/hollywood/) as a community that \"blackballs\" conservatives while speaking to actor [Dennis Quaid](https://okmagazine.com/t/dennis-quaid/). On a recent episode of \" [The Joe Rogan Experience](https://okmagazine.com/p/joe-rogan-reveals-voting-rfk-jr-over-donald-trump/),\" Rogan and Quaid delved into the topic of Hollywood's treatment of conservatives and \"cancel culture\" as a whole. Quaid, who plays [Ronald Reagan](https://okmagazine.com/t/ronald-reagan/) in the upcoming movie Reagan, revealed people tried to \"cancel\" him while working on the film. Rogan expressed his frustration with the industry, highlighting how individuals often choose to remain silent about their [political beliefs](https://okmagazine.com/p/donald-trump-mental-state-incoherent-de-banking-speech-new-hampshire/) out of fear of repercussions. He criticized Hollywood for its \"lack of diverse opinions,\" stating that speaking out could result in being \"blackballed.\" Quaid did not shy away from criticizing the \"cancel culture media.\" He also pushed back against the claim that the 2020 Covid PSA he did with [Dr. Anthony Fauci](https://okmagazine.com/p/donald-trump-hurled-f-bombs-dr-anthony-fauci-win-election-landslide/) was an endorsement of [Donald Trump](https://okmagazine.com/t/donald-trump/). Quaid denounced these claims as [\"fake news\"](https://okmagazine.com/p/donald-trump-abc-fake-news-reporter-calls-out-racist-remarks/) and expressed his displeasure with being mischaracterized by the media. \"It is being used by the cancel culture media that I was doing a campaign ad and endorsement of Donald Trump, and that I was paid handsomely for this by diverted CDC funds,\" Quaid said.

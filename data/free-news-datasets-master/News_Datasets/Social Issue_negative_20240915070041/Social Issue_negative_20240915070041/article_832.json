    "text": "[Carrie Underwood and her husband, Mike Fisher](https://thenerdstash.com/carrie-underwood-struggles-to-keep-husband-mike-fisher-happy-amid-rocky-marriage-reports/), are reportedly not in agreement about her latest job. The country singer recently replaced Katy Perry as a judge on American Idol. The gig is likely special to Underwood, as the reality singing competition series gave her the big break she needed to become a superstar. However, Fisher allegedly isn’t thrilled that his wife has opted to take on yet another huge, time-consuming project. Sources tell [Life and Style ](https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/carrie-underwoods-husband-didnt-want-her-to-do-american-idol/)that Mike Fisher didn’t want Carrie Underwood to accept the American Idol job. The former hockey player is reportedly concerned that his wife may have bitten off more than she can chew with the judging role. He’s also said to be worried about the singer spending so much time away from their home and their family. Carrie Underwood and Husband Mike Fisher Aren’t in Agreement about Her American Idol Job “He is a little concerned she may perform poorly under pressure,” the insider dished. “Mike didn’t want her to do Idol initially, but she insisted, and the paycheck is substantial. Mike is worried Carrie won’t be able to balance her life, commuting between Tennessee and L.A. It’s a huge adjustment, more than her residency in Las Vegas, which they never saw eye to eye on, either.” Related: [Carrie Underwood Suffers Another Devastating Blow as Tennessee Home Catches Fire on Father’s Day](https://thenerdstash.com/carrie-underwood-suffers-another-devastating-blow-as-tennessee-home-catches-fire-on-fathers-day/) Underwood is reportedly ready to prove she can rise to the occasion, and many fans think she’ll be great as Perry’s replacement. However, there have been rumors that her marriage to Fisher is on shaky ground, and the time away from her husband could possibly cause damage to their relationship. It was previously reported that [Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher have been arguing](https://thenerdstash.com/carrie-underwood-and-husband-struggling-as-loved-ones-fear-the-worst-the-marriage-is-clearly-in-crisis/) a lot as of late. She reportedly thinks he’s being jealous and controlling. However, he believes that his wife is [becoming too acclimated to the Hollywood lifestyle](https://thenerdstash.com/carrie-underwood-has-gone-wild-changing-her-looks-shes-always-been-vain/). Perhaps Carrie Underwood’s American Idol role will be a good thing for her career. However, it’s unclear how it will impact her marriage to Mike Fisher and her relationship with her family.",

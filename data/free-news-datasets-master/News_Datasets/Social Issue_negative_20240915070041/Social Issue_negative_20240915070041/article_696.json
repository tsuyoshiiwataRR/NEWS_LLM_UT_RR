    "text": "NAIROBI, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 20.1 million people were internally displaced in July in the Horn of Africa region, the United Nations migration agency said Thursday.\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) said in a report released in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, that the number is an increase from 19.2 million people in June as it attributed the total surge to a rise in internally displaced persons from Burundi, Ethiopia, and Sudan.\nMost of the displaced people were in Sudan (10.7 million), Somalia (3.5 million), Ethiopia (3.3 million) and South Sudan (2 million).\n\"There are 10.2 million newly forcibly displaced people in Sudan, including 7.9 million internally and 2.1 million in neighboring countries since the beginning of the conflict in April 2023,\" the IOM said.\nOther causes of displacements, according to the UN agency, are floods caused by heavy rains and food insecurity, especially in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia.\nIOM also noted that the Greater Horn of Africa region had some 5.4 million refugees and asylum seekers.\nUganda hosts the most number of refugees at 1.7 million, followed by Ethiopia at 1 million, and Kenya at 906,000.\nAbout 67 million people were food insecure in the region in July, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, a regional bloc in Africa.\nOf the number, 39 million are in IGAD member states, including Djibouti, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Sudan, and Uganda.\nOn Aug. 2, international agencies issued an alert that the Horn of Africa would experience below-average rainfall during the October-December season that would transition to drought. This would mean a rise in the number of displaced persons due to food insecurity. â– ",

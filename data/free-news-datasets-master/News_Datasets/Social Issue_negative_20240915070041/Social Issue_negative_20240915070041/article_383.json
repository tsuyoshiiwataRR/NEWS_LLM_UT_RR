    "text": "Regarding what to do when Cheeto is in town - just ignore him. Don't protest, don't give his supporters the opportunity to hurt anyone. They will spin anything to look like victims and make us look bad. *Permission granted to copy/paste from this poster in another group. As someone who is a Strategist for a living, I believe they picked Asheville for one reason.. to take back the news cycle. They want a scene, they want violence (even if it is instigated by MAGA), they want destruction, they want arrests, and they want the news to cover the \"dangers\" of the progressive cities created by \"libtards\"... -Robinson will use it to further his \"some people need killing\" BS... and to say that Stein will turn NC into Asheville. -Trump will use it to further his lies and fear mongering and try to keep NC red. -Edwards will use it to secure the vote for him. Careful Friends... selecting Asheville for his BS event was not arbitrary. Use extreme caution if going down there to protest!

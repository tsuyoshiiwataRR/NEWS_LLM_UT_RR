    "text": "Ronald F. Vondal-Nelson is charged with robbery, preventing arrest, refusal to halt and possession of drug paraphernalia, according to a press release issued by the Grand Forks Police Department. GRAND FORKS — The suspect in a Tuesday, Aug. 13, RAD scooter theft was apprehended Thursday, Aug. 15, by an officer on routine patrol near Orton's Southtown Cenex, located at 2002 S. Washington St. The officer requested additional patrol units on scene after recognizing 35-year-old Ronald F. Vondal-Nelson as the suspect, according to a press release the Grand Forks Police Department issued Thursday afternoon. Vondal-Nelson, walking through a parking lot while on his phone, caught sight of the officer and — when the officer began to exit the patrol car — allegedly took off running. He allegedly ran around the gas station, fleeing to the south and then west, where he was met with officers entering the area. He was apprehended behind Skip's Budget Drug at 2015 Library Cir. and taken into custody without further incident. The GFPD issued a release asking for help locating the theft suspect on Tuesday after he was allegedly observed using a bolt cutter to steal a scooter that was padlocked to a building, the release said. When a witness saw what was happening, he yelled at the suspect, who allegedly threatened to hit him with the bolt cutter if he got any closer. The suspect then left the scene. Vondal-Nelson is charged with robbery, preventing arrest, refusal to halt and possession of drug paraphernalia, the release said. Court documents have not yet been filed.

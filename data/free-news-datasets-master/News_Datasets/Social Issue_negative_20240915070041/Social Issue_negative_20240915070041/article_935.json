    "text": "GUILTY: Pitipong Daengbunga sentenced to life in prison for 2022 murder BILOXI, Miss. (WLOX) - Pitipong Daengbunga was sentenced Thursday afternoon for the 2022 murder of Jamie Boggs. Daengbunga was on trial for first-degree murder and tampering with evidence. Judge Randi Mueller sentenced Daengbunga to life in prison for the murder charge, and 10 years for the tampering with evidence charge. The jury deliberated for only 35 minutes. The prosecution summed up the case in closing arguments Thursday, saying Boggs was “massacred” inside the Rodenberg Avenue apartment she shared with Daengbunga in February 2022, adding that “he intended to kill Boggs and enjoyed it.” The state told jurors to remember Daengbunga was previously charged with attempted murder of a woman in Jones County. The state showed jurors photos of both women, saying their injuries were “mirror images” of each other. Daengbunga’s attorneys said he acted in self-defense the night Boggs died, pointing to a witness who testified she saw Boggs hitting Daengbunga during a fight three weeks before her death the morning of January 11, 2022. That witness was former neighbor Pam McLemore, who is currently in jail in Texas. McLemore testified via Zoom. McLemore described the altercation, saying she saw Boggs hitting and throwing things at Daengbunga. She told the jury she was afraid for both of them that day. McLemore called 911, and Biloxi Police officers responded to the apartment. A police dispatcher who was on duty that day testified. Jurors listened to the 911 call and heard Boggs yelling in the background. In rebuttal, the prosecution called up the Biloxi Police officer who responded to McLemore’s 911 call. The officer testified that when he arrived, Daengbunga was alone and uninjured, saying he did not need any assistance. McLemore testified that Daengbunga never had many visitors until Boggs moved in; then, she saw men coming and going from the apartment. According to the neighbor, Daengbunga wanted Boggs to move out, but she wouldn’t leave. On the night of her death, Daengbunga’s lawyers said there was “frenzied chaos” inside the apartment and that Daengbunga retaliated with what was there. Boggs was beaten, stabbed and strangled to death. The jury began deliberating just before 3:30 p.m. and made a decision just after 4 p.m. See a spelling or grammar error in this story?

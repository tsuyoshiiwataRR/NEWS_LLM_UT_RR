    "text": "President & Managing Partner of Fieldstone Group LLC Steve Hallstrom joins Fox Across America With Jimmy Failla to explain how one of his radio stations, WDAY in Fargo, North Dakota, has been impacted by the Harris campaign reportedly buying Google ads featuring manipulated news stories which have a pro-Kamala spin in the headline and description.\n“So news team, they are hustling all day long. They’re doing local, regional, national stories. And there were a couple of stories we put on our website a few weeks back, one about Kamala Harris selecting Tim Walz, which is a big story here because our community, Fargo, borders on Minnesota. So Minnesota, western Minnesota is a big area for us. So we cover what happens with Minnesota politics and obviously the Minnesota Governor being involved. Another story was that there was a benefit that’s coming out of Saint Paul, which is another show that we can do something about all the government spending in Minnesota. But it talked about how this new benefit would help 250,000 Minnesota families. The problem is, the headline that they wrote, for us was ‘Harris Picks was 215,000 Minnesota families Win’. We wrote no story at all, anything like that. Certainly didn’t put any headlines up there. And as we saw in this ad, you kind of have to see the ad to understand what this really means. But it’s all over out there. It’s not hard to find. But really, what they did, is they lied to anybody who saw that ad saying this WDAY radio, you know, bunch of hoodlums, they put out this headline about how Harris selected Walz. And because of that, it’s great news for Minnesota families. And like I’ve been telling people, I don’t care who the candidate or who the party is, I’d feel the same if it was the Trump campaign. But you don’t do that to a news brand where we try very, very, very hard to be right down the middle and not express any sort of leanings on the air.”\nListen to the podcast to hear what else he had to say to Jimmy!",

    "text": "According to\nThe Athletic, ESPN fired NFL Countdown host Sam Ponder and analyst Robert Griffin III. The moves are for “financial reasons” and are similar to those of many other networks.\nHowever, despite the bad news, RGIII continues to do what he loves: report NFL news. In his latest tweet, he gave opinions about the\nAtlanta Falcons acquiring pass rusher Matthew Judon, and many online joked and showed support for the situation.\n“can you break ur firing??” said one commenter.\n“Bro got fired and posted this,” said another about Griffin\n“Bro, you are undervalued at ESPN. Can’t wait to see unfettered and independent RGIII or see you go to Fox,” said another in support.\n“One of the few times I’ll ever say this- but espn screwed up. Don’t know the behind the scenes but bright things ahead!” added a fourth.\nClick on ‘Follow Us’ and get notified of the most viral NFL stories via Google!\nFollow Us\nAlso Read:\n[PHOTO: Everyone Is Making The Same Raunchy Joke After Robert Griffin III Was Spotted With His Wife Opening Wide For A Treat](Everyone%20Is%20Making%20The%20Same%20Raunchy%20Joke%20After%20Robert%20Griffin%20III%20Was%20Spotted%20With%20His%20Wife%20Opening%20Wide%20For%20A%20Treat)\n“My son and I enjoy listening to your broadcasts. You are one of the stars in the business. All my best as you take a position of greater importance and impact. Go Noles,” stated a fifth.\nOf course, Griffin has been with ESPN since 2021 and had many fans.\nRobert Griffin III Will Likely Find A New Job Soon\nGriffin turned a successful yet short NFL playing stint due to injuries into an amazing career as an NFL and college football analyst.\nThat’s why it was so surprising that he was let go from ESPN with two whole years left on his contract. He was also one of the most beloved by the public throughout the station.\nHowever, he is expected to find a new network soon to continue informing his nearly three million followers across both Instagram and X.\nAlso Read:\nESPN Makes Shocking Announcement About Robert Griffin III That No One Saw Coming",

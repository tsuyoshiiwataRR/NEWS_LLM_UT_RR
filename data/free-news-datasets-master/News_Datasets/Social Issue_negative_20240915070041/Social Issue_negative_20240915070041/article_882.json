    "text": "Monmouth County courts discriminated against people with poor English skills: feds Ken Serrano Asbury Park Press Following an investigation into discrimination by the Monmouth County courts, the U.S. Department of Justice has entered into a settlement with the New Jersey Judiciary to improve access to court services for people with limited or no command of English.\nMonmouth County court staff refused to provide an interpreter for assistance with forms, failed to translate or explain vital documents and did not adequately inform staff of language access policies and procedures, the justice department said.\nAn employee who spoke out about the discrimination was retaliated against, the department said.\nThe settlement includes a statewide overhaul of court services provided to those members of the public who speak or read little or no English as well as damages of $89,718 for the unidentified employee who complained about the practices.\n“People with limited English proficiency can lose their children, homes and fundamental rights when they face language barriers in our court systems,” said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the department’s Civil Rights Division.\nThe state judiciary did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The settlement does not mean the court system admitted to the failures, the justice department said.\nMore: NJ Attorney General names local cops subject to ‘major disciplinary action’ in 2023\nUnder the Memorandum of Agreement, the New Jersey Judiciary must translate court forms and materials and make them available for distribution at courthouses. It must also develop mandatory language access training, provide training to prevent retaliation and issue public notices that explain the nonretaliation policy and complaint process in non-English languages.\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office and the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division will monitor the courts for two years.\nThe settlement came after a four-year investigation of the Monmouth County courts that began in 2019. In June 2023, the justice department notified the judiciary of its findings.\nThe Monmouth courts have already made improvements, such as including LCD screens with court information in different languages throughout the courthouse and making website content available in the five most frequently encountered non-English languages of court users.\nKen Serrano covers breaking news, crime and investigations.

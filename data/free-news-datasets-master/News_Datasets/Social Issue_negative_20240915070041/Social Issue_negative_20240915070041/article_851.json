    "text": "FILE PHOTO: Philippine National Police Chief Gen. Rommel Francisco Marbil. INQUIRER / NINO JESUS ORBETA\nActive members of the police and the military will now be exempted from taking drug tests (DT) as well as psychological and psychiatric examinations (PPE) as a requirement for securing a license for firearms that they want to purchase in addition to those issued by the government, the Philippine National Police said on Thursday.\nThe order was contained in a memorandum signed by PNP chief Police Gen. Rommel Marbil on July 16.\nADVERTISEMENT “All active military and police personnel are no longer required to undergo DT and PPE since they are already trained as responsible firearm holders,” Marbil said in the memo.\nFEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO LIST: Canceled flights on August 16 due to Typhoon Ampil’s threat NEWSINFO Marcos moves Ninoy Aquino Day to August 23 for longer weekend NEWSINFO Solon hits Cardemas over alleged disinformation, conflict of interest “The DT and PPE conducted during their service will suffice as LTOPF (license to own and possess firearms) requirements,” he added.\nThe PNP chief said the military and the police would only be required to submit their valid PNP or AFP ID in support of their gun license applications.\nNBI, PDEA not covered Lt. Col. Eudisan Gultiano, the spokesperson for the PNP Civil Security Group, said the exemption applies to police and military personnel who are acquiring firearms on top of those issued by the government.\nBased on the latest record, Gultiano said the PNP had about 11,000 expired gun permits while the Armed Forces of the Philippines has about 14,000.\nThe PNP chief’s memo does not cover other law enforcement agencies and uniformed services, such as the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, the National Bureau of Investigation, and the Philippine Coast Guard, she added.\n“I think there will be another deliberation on this because when it comes to the PNP and AFP, it is easy for us to monitor our personnel,” she said.\nADVERTISEMENT Too busy 24/7 Explaining the exemption, Gultiano said PNP and AFP personnel no longer needed to take new tests since they had already been trained on “responsible gun ownership” and that there are “enough measures” to discipline abusive or erring users.\nShe said Marbil’s memo would also hasten the license applications and renewals.\nREAD: Cops, soldiers exempted from drug, mental test rules to get gun licenses\n“It’s really a big help to our active PNP personnel because sometimes they really do not have time because of 24 hours duty, 24/7 duty,” she added.\nYour subscription could not be saved.

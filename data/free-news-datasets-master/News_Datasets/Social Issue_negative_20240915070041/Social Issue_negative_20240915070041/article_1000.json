    "text": "Former President Rodrigo Duterte unleashed a barrage of attacks against International Criminal Court, which is investigating the ex chief executive over allegations of crimes against humanity over his bloody war on drugs. Duterte made the profanity laden remarks on Monday during a podcast hosted by former presidential spokesperson Harry Roque and Trixie Cruz Angeles, who served under the administration of Duterte incumbent and President Bonbon Marcos respectively. That occurs the International Criminal Court as he questioned their jurisdiction in the country. Following the accusation against him, Duterte declared the Philippines withdrawal from the Rome Statute or the treaty which established the International Criminal Court, in March 2018. The withdrawal took effect on March 2019. Despite this, the International Criminal Court retained jurisdiction over alleged crimes in the Philippines from November 1, 2011, to March 16, 2019, while the country was still a state party. The former president also slammed the International Criminal Courts over what he thinks is its double standards when it comes to Western countries. Duterte was the chief architect of the bloody drug war waged during his roles as the countries chief executive and as mayor of Davao City. The drug war under his presidency claimed at least 6000 lives during his term as president, according to official government data. But human rights watchdogs and International Criminal Court itself estimated the death toll under the Tartus drug. To be between 12,000 and 30,000 from 2016 to 2019 alone as they noted that several of these are extrajudicial killings.",

    "text": "Another day, another helping of wackadoo from Republican vice-presidential candidate J. Divan Vance. The man is the Comstock Lode of weird ideas, most of which he has decided to share with the world during his fairly brief time as a public figure, and which are now being eagerly mined by various media concerns. On Thursday, it was The C hristian Science Monitor that struck the richest vein , discovering a speech JDV had given back in 2021 to a conservative gathering. The topic was the disturbances that had occurred in the wake of the murder of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police. Vance had a...well, a theory, I guess you’d call it.\n“Who benefits most when small businesses on Main Street are destroyed? Who wants to see their competitors unable to deliver goods and services to people, so that you get it delivered in your brown Amazon box? Jeff Bezos,” Mr. Vance said, referencing the riots that broke out in the summer of 2020, amid a wave of racial justice protests. “The people who are invested in destroying America via our corporate class are also getting rich from it. This is an important piece of the puzzle to understand. “If you peel back the onion, what you find is that the businesses that are most connected and most devoted to destroying our values are also benefiting financially from it,” he argued in the speech at a conference in suburban Washington, D.C., hosted by the Claremont Institute, a right-wing California think tank that has emerged as an ally of the MAGA movement. Please believe that this is not an example of some sort of new conservative “populism.” Vance aimed at Bezos not out of a desire to break Amazon’s monopolistic power in the marketplace but because, by the strange lights of the modern conservative brains, Bezos is guilty of “woke capitalism.” And now the daily drip-drip-drip of Vance’s vast history of weird opens again the question of how thoroughly he was vetted by the Republican nominee’s campaign. We might have an answer to that, since Vance’s vetting file is one of the hacked Trump campaign documents leaked to a number of outlets.\nIt is impossible now to argue that this document has no news value, and therefore any argument so far mustered in defense of not treating this leaked material the way the leaked material from Hillary Rodham Clinton was treated in 2016, which was always lame, is now in traction. We need to know what the campaign knew about Vance’s public appearances so that we can judge his fitness for office as well as that of the prospective GOP administration. Plus, fair is fair.\nRelated Story Three Cheers for The Montana State Supreme Court Watch Next",

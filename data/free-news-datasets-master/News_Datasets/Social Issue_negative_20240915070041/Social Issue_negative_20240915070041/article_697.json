    "text": "Today, Rep. Adrian Smith (R-NE), released the following statement after a report from the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found and the IRS subsequently confirmed it does not plan to decommission and replace the vast majority of the agency's outdated information systems.\n\"Modernization of antiquated IRS systems is badly needed to improve taxpayer service and better protect Americans’ personal data. Yet, the latest TIGTA report and subsequent IRS response once again reveal the misaligned priorities of the Biden-Harris IRS and their failure to serve American taxpayers. The administration’s continued pursuit of unauthorized tax prep services and schemes to audit more Americans across the income spectrum, including new ways to audit the tips received by service workers, above basic needs like IT and customer service improvements is another reminder of how little respect they have for hardworking families across the country.\"\nBACKGROUND:\nIn January 2023, Reps. Adrian Smith and Michelle Steel's (R-CA) bill to repeal the Biden Administration’s $80 billion IRS expansion, the Family and Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act, became the first bill passed by the House in the 118th Congress. That bill would also preserve funding for customer service and IT modernization at IRS.\n###\nIssues : Taxes Ways & Means",

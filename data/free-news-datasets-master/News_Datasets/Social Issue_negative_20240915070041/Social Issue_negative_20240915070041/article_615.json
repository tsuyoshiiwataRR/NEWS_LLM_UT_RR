    "text": "India’s latest crime report, which covers 2022, recorded 31,500 cases of rape in that year alone. Thousands of people came out to protest on Thursday night in Calcutta, eastern India, against the rape and murder of a 31-year-old doctor at the public hospital where she worked. Related: India: New Victims Bodies Found After Landslides in Kerala The mass mobilization called for increased security in a country that in 2022 had an average of 90 daily violations. Protesters carried candles and posters with messages such as “We want justice” or “Hang the rapist, save the women”. Also, a mob of hundreds of people forcibly entered the R.G. Kar University Hospital, the site of the events, and vandalized the facilities on the first floor amid strong protests. The autopsy of the victim confirmed the sexual assault and, in a petition to the court hearing the case, the parents of the victim point out that it was suspected to have been in a group. This scandal reached the celebrations on Thursday of India’s independence day in New Delhi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, without directly referring to the case, expressed his “grief” over violence against women. “Crimes against women must be investigated quickly. Monstrous behaviour against women must be punished quickly and severely,” he said. The Central Research Bureau summoned five doctors for questioning. Meanwhile, the police in Calcutta arrested nine people after the mobilizations. Autor: OSG Fuente: EFE-AFP",

    "text": "Montgomery County School Board Director Faces Mounting Pressure to Resign Contentious Social Media Post Ignites Outcry In Montgomery County, a local school board director is under increasing scrutiny following a controversial social media post allegedly directed at Vice President Kamala Harris. The uproar transitioned from online forums to the physical arena of the Souderton Area School District’s regular board meeting held on Wednesday evening.\nDetails of the Controversy Reports indicate that back in late July, School Board Director William Formica made a lewd comment about Vice President Harris on social media, which he later deleted. However, the damage was done as screen captures of his post circulated widely across various platforms.\nSchool Board Meeting Escalates Tensions During Wednesday night’s board meeting, Formica was absent, and the agenda did not openly address the issue of his comments. Frustration erupted from the audience, leading to booing and members of the audience exiting the venue in protest.\nCommunity Reactions and Calls for Accountability Local residents have voiced their concerns passionately. Corinne Degeiso, a representative of the Souderton Area for Responsible Leadership, emphasized her dismay, addressing the implications of Formica’s comments on young girls stating, “I have a daughter. I don’t want her to grow up thinking that men like this are correct and she would only get to places of power—not through hard work, but through other means.”\nSchool Board’s Response The school board responded with a statement condemning Formica’s choice of language as inappropriate, indicating that they need “some time to process this situation.” A petition demanding his resignation has gained momentum on Change.org, amassing over 1,800 signatures, though opinions on his resignation are divided.\nSupporters Defend His Tenure Despite the backlash, some community members argue that Formica’s contributions to the school board warrant his retention. “He does a lot of financial management for the district. He’s very skilled in that,” mentioned Kaitlin Destine, representing the Valley Conservative Voice. Supporters point out his advocacy for parental rights and child welfare policies, noting that these positions haven’t changed amid the controversy.\nUpcoming Actions The controversy surrounding Formica is set to continue as an action meeting is scheduled for August 29, with a number of parents poised to renew their calls for his resignation. NBC10 has reached out to Formica for a statement regarding his potential attendance at the upcoming meeting but has yet to receive a response.",

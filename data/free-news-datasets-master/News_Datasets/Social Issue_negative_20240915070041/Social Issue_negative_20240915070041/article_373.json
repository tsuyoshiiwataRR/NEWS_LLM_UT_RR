    "text": "Guntersville ( [WAAY](http://www.waaytv.com)) - A Guntersville man faces more charges of sex crimes against children. Corey Jacob Vickery, 28, was arrested Monday and charged with five counts of possession of child pornography. On Thursday, the Marshall County Sheriff's Office added six more charges against him: Five counts of possession of child pornography with intent to disseminate and one count of production of pornography with minors. His bond is set at $500,000. The sheriff's office says even more charges could be forthcoming. A joint investigation conducted by the Marshall County Sheriff's Office and the Internet Crimes Against Children resulted in the execution of a search warrant at 2500 Deerman St. in Guntersville on Monday. That's when Vickery was first arrested. The Guntersville Police Department, Marshall County District Attorney's Office, and Marshall County Drug Task Force assisted. Anyone with information about Vickery and his case is asked to contact the Marshall County Sheriff's Office at (256) 582-2034.",

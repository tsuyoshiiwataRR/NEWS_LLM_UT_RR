    "text": "A $20 billion bond touted as California's largest affordable housing measure in history has been pulled from November’s election ballot amid fears that it wouldn’t garner enough votes to pass. The Bay Area Housing Finance Authority decided at its meeting Wednesday to delay a vote on the [bond proposal](https://www.costar.com/article/30162848/bay-area-residents-to-vote-on-20-billion-housing-bond) intended to raise up to $20 billion for affordable housing in the San Francisco Bay Area until at least 2026. Authority members worried about the prospects of a separate referendum on the statewide ballot, Proposition 5, to lower the threshold for a bond to pass to 55% of voters. If that failed, the housing bond would need support from two-thirds of voters. “The challenge we’re having is the tie that our bond measure has to State Proposition 5,” Andrew Fremier, executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, which helps with future planning for the Bay Area, told the authority before the vote. “We all felt it had a chance at 55%.” [Authority members were more optimistic in June](https://www.costar.com/article/30162848/bay-area-residents-to-vote-on-20-billion-housing-bond) when they opted to put the housing bond on the ballot in San Francisco and eight adjoining counties. The measure could make funding available to develop or preserve about 70,000 residences for households with low or moderate incomes. An authority survey found that 55% of voters seemed likely to support the regional bond, though some had misgivings about paying higher taxes to do so. Besides questions about [the statewide referendum](http://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_5,_Lower_Supermajority_Requirement_to_55%25_for_Local_Bond_Measures_to_Fund_Housing_and_Public_Infrastructure_Amendment_(2024)), the authority faced a recent lawsuit filed by a group of individuals opposed to the bond who said the authority had misled the public about the measure’s cost. Amie Fishman, executive director of the Nonprofit Housing Association of Northern California, said at Wednesday’s meeting that “legal and campaign challenges from extremist anti-housing and anti-government activists” led to the move to withdraw the ballot proposal. She said if Proposition 5 passes, the housing measure could be tried again in 2026. But Jim Sperling, an authority member, was skeptical of that timing since voters will be deciding that year on a regional bond for spending on transportation. “If I’d had my way, I would have rolled the dice” by leaving the bond on the ballot this year, Sperling said at the meeting.",

    "text": "(Photo : Screenshot of CSPAN feed) Former President Donald Trump took aim at Kamala Harris as he spoke to reporters Thursday at his Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, in what is his second news conference in two weeks, saying that the current Vice President \"destroys everything she touches\". Former President Donald Trump took aim, once again, at [Kamala Harris](https://www.hngn.com/articles/262772/20240814/kamala-harris-winning-over-more-double-hater-trump-top-polling.htm) as he spoke to reporters Thursday at his Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, in what is his second news conference in two weeks, saying that the current Vice President \"destroys everything she touches\". Trump claimed that the American economy has suffered in the last three and a half years under President Biden and [VP Harris](https://www.hngn.com/articles/262661/20240810/trump-reportedly-repeatedly-called-kamala-harris-b-ch-private.htm). \"We're a failing economy,\" Trump stated, blaming, at least in part, [Harris](https://www.hngn.com/articles/262650/20240810/kamala-harris-leads-donald-trump-3-key-battleground-states-report.htm), adding that she \"destroys everything she touches\". Trump made the comments with breakfast cereals, condiments, and even what looks like a toy house that were on tables on either side of him, presumably meant to signify all the things he believes Biden and Harris have destroyed. Trump cited several inflation statistics for key staples in U.S. household diets. But he criticized Harris' comments on addressing price gouging, including on food, denouncing it as \"communist price controls\" and \"the Maduro plan,\" referring to the much-disputed leader of Venezuela. \"She wants price controls,\" he said. \"They don't work. ... They lead to food shortages.\" He also pointed to rising car insurance premiums and fuel costs. \"Harris has just declared that tackling the economy will be a day one priority for her,\" the former President announced. \"But day one for Harris really was three and a half years ago. Where has she been?\" Trump added. \"You add it up, it's thousands and thousands of dollars that she has cost the American people.\" \"She is in favor of the death of the American dream,\" Trump fulminated. Meanwhile, Harris has enjoyed a surge in popularity of late, according to a new survey. A Monmouth University study saw a drop in the so-called double haters. Close to 20% of respondents held this view when Biden was running, but the figure dropped to 8% after Harris rose to the top of the ticket. The shift toward Harris can also be seen in the enthusiasm generated among Democrats. Enthusiasm for a potential Trump-Biden rematch had been on the rise but never exceeded 50%. However, the prospect of a Trump-Harris contest has increased enthusiasm to 68%, with a particularly dramatic rise among Democrats. The Democratic National Convention will be held August 19th through August 22nd.",

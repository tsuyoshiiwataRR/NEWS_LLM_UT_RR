    "text": "Featured Top Story UPDATE Sunbury police: One person killed in shooting; street open By Francis Scarcella fscarcella@dailyitem.com Aug 15, 2024 Aug 15, 2024 Updated 2 mins ago Emergency responders are on the scene of a shooting near the Northumberland County Courthouse in Sunbury on Thursday, Aug. 15, 2024.\nFrancis Scarcella/The Daily Item\nSUNBURY â€” One person was killed in the shooting near the Northumberland County Courthouse on Thursday.\nSunbury Police held a press conference at 4:30 p.m. to update the public on the situation.\nOne person was taken from the scene of the shooting in a medical transport, more than 30 minutes after the incident took place, hours after an attempted homicide trial began in the city.\nPolice confirmed the shooter is still not in custody.\nSecond Street and the Weis Markets parking lot are now open. Police had taped off the street for two blocks near the courthouse, the parking lot and First National Bank during the investigation at the scene. Market Street remained open.\nThursday marked the first day of an attempted homicide trial at the courthouse. District Attorney Michael O'Donnell said the trial, which was linked to a 2022 fatal shooting in the city, has been postponed.\nO'Donnell said the attempted homicide trial of Anthony Moultrie and Franky Riche that began Thursday has been ruled a mistrial as a result of Thursday's shooting. Both are accused of attempted homicide stemming from an incident that took place in May 2022 related to a homicide that occurred a month earlier.\nThursday's shooting happened moments after the trial broke for lunch. The courthouse is on lockdown and will be closed for the remainder of the day according to the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts.\nA crowd at the scene before the ambulance left for the hospital, gathered in prayer as police and EMTs responded to the scene.\nThis is a developing story. More details will be published when they become available.\nTags Legal Action Criminal Law Law Enforcement Crime Gun Violence Emergency Services Criminal Justice Mass Shootings Law Enforcement Controversies Filmed Deaths Violence Homicide Crimes Murder National Security Of The United States Killings Death National Security Public Services Of The United States Lockdown Law-related Events Misconduct Trial Attacks In Trending Video Featured Local Savings COUPON DEALS NEWSPAPER ADS Trending Recipes",

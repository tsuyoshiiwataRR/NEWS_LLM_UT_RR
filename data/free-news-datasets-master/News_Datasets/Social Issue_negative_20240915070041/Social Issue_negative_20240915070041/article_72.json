    "text": "Rural property sales have continued to cool heading into traditional spring farm selling campaigns. After a record run with farmland prices over the past few years, landowners will be keen for the trend to continue as their properties join the spring offerings. Elders Real Estate's [latest property analysis](https://elders.com.au/for-farmers/market-insights/rural-property-update/) shows the market has continued to slow during the first part of this year consolidating the strong gains witnessed in recent years. Elders' national rural property indicator fell four per cent during the first quarter although it remains 3pc above the levels of the same time last year. The average annual rate of capital growth over the past decade has been 10pc. Elders general manager (farmland agency and water) Mark Barber said the market has been strengthened by good quality commercial and corporate sized transactions which have sold well to strong inquiry. Activity at the other end of the market has been more subdued with a greater proportion of deals subject to debt funding coming under increased scrutiny by financiers and attracting subdued buyer inquiry, Mr Barber said. The number of properties sold during the first quarter of 2024 was down 9pc compared with last quarter and 17pc below the same period a year ago. It was the lowest number of sales on record. The dry autumn in southern areas saw a fall in farmer confidence. South Australian rural property values fell by 4pc on a large lift in the volume of properties sold during the peak selling season. \"Experience from recent sales conducted by the Elders team in southern areas are that property prices are starting to strengthen as farm incomes improve and on forecasts of a normal or better spring and improved commodity prices,\" Mr Barber said. The Elders property market Indicator for Victoria/Tasmania fell 15pc during the first quarter leaving it 8pc down on the same time last year. This fall came after the boom in farm prices over three years property prices jumped 11.7pc annually. Mr Barber said part of the fall could also be attributed to a slight shift in the types of property on the market in these areas. \"It is not unusual to see some volatility in property markets from time to time,\" he said. The market was stronger in other states - holding firm in NSW with small rises in WA and Queensland. In Queensland, the positive medium-term outlook for cattle prices has aided market sentiment, he said. Mr Barber said high-quality and well-presented properties continue to be in strong demand irrespective of where they are. Elders NSW sales executive Richard Gemmell said seasonal conditions have generally been favourable towards a positive start for feed crops, winter cereals and the potential for strong pasture growth looking out as far as spring. \"Farmland transactions continue throughout the state with values holding, in particular when potential investor and willing sellers are familiar with the current market and willing to strike common ground,\" he said. \"As more acquisitions are being funded through debt, we are being advised investors should prepare early to be purchase ready whenever possible to avoid approval delays. Elders rural sales executive (South Australia) Adam Chilcott said after many years of consistent underlying land growth across all regions \"small corrections to averages\" were observed at the start of the year. \"In a noticeable trend, farm transaction sales were strong in the first three months of the year largely enabling buyers ample time to settle properties and plan winter sowing programs in advance. \"With the warmest March in South Australia ever recorded, buyer participation was cautious and more considered, than in recent times. Elders Qld/NT state real estate manager Tim Lane said: \"The northern rural property has been underpinned by a number of significant good quality commercial and corporate sized transactions which have sold well to strong inquiry. \"Activity at the other end of the market has been more subdued with deals subject to debt funding coming under increased scrutiny by financiers. \"While prices have held, activity is declining as buyer inquiry has softened with days on market increasing.\" Mr Lane said the [upcoming sale](https://www.farmonline.com.au/story/8691042/ray-scotts-107503-hectare-cattle-empire-officially-on-market/) of the Ray Scott Pastoral Group Aggregation of properties would provide a gauge of how much good seasonal conditions and the positive medium-term outlook for cattle has driven market sentiment. Property prices \"took a step backwards\" during the first part of 2024 as seasonal conditions deteriorated and farmer confidence fell. The Victorian/Tasmanian rural property indicator fell 15pc to $14,198/ha wiping out the gains made across 2023. Sales volumes remain at historically low levels with just 220 sales through the first quarter of the year, down 9pc. Elders real estate sales executive (Western Australia) Simon Cheetham said high rainfall property prices through the south-west have held strong and experienced further increases despite volatility in the livestock markets. He said forestry activity was a key driver through these zones. \"Despite a dry season in 2023 for much of the northern wheatbelt, prices have been firm for the most part, with limited supply coming onto the market,\" Mr Cheetham said. \"Exceptionally high rainfall over the past month has set up much of this zone well in 2024. \"Current seasonal conditions for the balance of the state are mixed, with some quality properties to be offered to the market in coming months.

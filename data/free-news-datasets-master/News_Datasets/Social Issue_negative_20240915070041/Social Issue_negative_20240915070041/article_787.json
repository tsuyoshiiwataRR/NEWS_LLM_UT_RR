    "text": "Occasional BBC presenter Chris Packham has told people to set themselves on fire if they dare to bank with Barclays. If Farage or anyone on the right had said that about any other group of people, they'd be in handcuffs and looking at a few years in prison, wouldn't they? I don't actually want him to go to prison obviously, unlike the government I believe in free speech, but it's another blatant double standard isn't it. If this was the other way round, it'd be front page of the Guardian, rolling news coverage. But for lovely, leftie tree-hugger Packham the only pick-up it gets is in The Country Squire... Patrick Christys hit out at Chris Packham GB NEWS Is that language not potentially quite likely to incite harm to others? Is that not extreme rhetoric? Will he face any prosecution? Absolutely not. He's one of the good guys. Packham's got form, he sailed close to the wind with a Channel 4 documentary... Chris PackhamPA He also interviewed now jailed Extinction Rebellion founder Roger Hallam, and it all got a bit weird. And will the BBC end their association with the presenter who appears to have disdain for a large number of licence fee payers? Well this is what they told us… “Chris Packham is a freelancer, not a member of staff, and he’s not currently on air. His private activities and views are his own, not the BBC’s.” And now it's emerged that Just Stop Oil are planning to break in to Windsor Castle, where Princeess Katherine is recovering from cancer. They're planning to bring Windsor to a standstill. They also reportedly want to use old people and the disabled so that when police drag them away it will look really bad for the authorities. Are this Extinction Rebellion lot not a bit unhinged, and plotting things, and encouraging other people to plot things that cost money and could risk lives? Have we got any room in prison for them or is it full of middle aged women who put something dodgy on Facebook?",

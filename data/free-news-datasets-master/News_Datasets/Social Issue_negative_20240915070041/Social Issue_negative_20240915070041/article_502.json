(WKYT) -The last time we saw the World Health Organization declare an Mpox outbreak as a Global Health Emergency was in July of 2022, and it lasted for almost a year. Now, even though we are seeing cases rise outside of the United States, Woodford County Health Department’s Cassie Prather said Kentuckians can do things to prevent cases here. “Thankfully there’s a vaccine, it is a two dose vaccine,” she said. Prather said this vaccine has limited the spread of the disease with only [111 cases in KY since the 2022 outbreak.](https://dashboard.chfs.ky.gov/views/MPOXPublicFacingReport/KentuckyMpoxReportedCases?%3Aembed=y&%3Aiid=1&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y) None of those cases have been identified as the Claude 1 variant that is spreading right now. “This variant, the Claude 1 variant, does have potentially more severe symptoms and can cause death,” Prather said. “Monitoring and surveillance are key.” Mpox is most commonly found in men in the LQBTQ+ community. Prather says there are things people at higher risk can look out for; high fever, muscle aches and a rash. If you’re someone considered high risk for Mpox, getting the vaccine will protect you from both variants. “You can come to us without any judgment,” Prather said. “We just want to make sure that we prevent any disease transmission.” On September 13th, the Woodford County Health Department will be at the Black Pride festival at Woodland Park in Lexington to administer Mpox vaccines and free HIV testing. To see if you are eligible for a vaccine and what other Kentucky locations might provide them, you can visit the [Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services’ website.](https://www.chfs.ky.gov/agencies/dph/dehp/idb/Pages/monkeypox.aspx) Copyright 2024 WKYT.

He needed some quick money and put up some trash we had laying around, anyways, a couple of minutes later an random account called \"kloddar\" bits 400 million coins on the obsidian chestplate and we are lowkey freaking out knowing that this will look insanely suspicious, and therefore we decide to create a support ticket asking if we should be worrying or do anything (look images attached for the auction) We wait a couple of days without touching the money in the auction because we are obviously scared to get wiped since we know how it looks. Anyways, after 2 days time, we get an answer on out support ticket which is also attached below. As you can read from the answer, that the agent reassures us that if we haven't broken any rules, we shouldn't be scared, and breathe out heavily and we go on the spend the coins since we just got told we were fine. Fast forward to 3 days later, during a Cata M4 run we all get sent to limbo and the account that created the auction (1auge) gets a 90d ban smacked in his face for boosting and all of our coop profiles gets wiped. We obviously instantly believe this is the cause, and both submit and ban appeal which is denied by the appeal bot only after an hour or two. On top of that I also create a ticket on hypixel's support dashboard and it also gets ignored, being closed without even recieving and answer I also tried adding commenting on the original support ticket that the agent gave us an answer on, but we still haven't received an answer for that one either, and I'm very much looking forward to it also being shutdown as \"solved\" without getting an answer lol Another note to add to this, is that the account that was banned for alleged boosting (1auge) had around 2 billion coins in skins bought from Skyblock Gems and he was quite a spender on gems on the server, so why in heaven would he ever want to risk his account by buying coins from an external source when he has bought gems like 4 times at this point and has a huge networth lying around in skins, its not like he needed money. Anyways, I am lost at this point, idk what to do, the admins and support are ignoring us, are we just done? Did we just loose like 1500 hours of progress across 3 accounts and ~500$ of real world money spent on gems because some random decided to bit 400m on one of our auctions? How is that even fair?

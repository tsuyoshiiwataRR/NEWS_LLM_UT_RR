    "text": "The boss of insurer Aviva has warned the government against tapping into private pensions to plug a £22 billion deficit in the country's finances. Speculation is rife that the Chancellor Rachel Reeves may cut the tax relief available to higher earners on their pension contributions in her October Budget.\nAt present, a basic rate taxpayer receives 20 per cent tax relief on pension contributions, meaning every £100 they invest in a scheme costs them £80. However, those earning between £50,271 to £125,140 and paying 40 percent tax also receive more generous tax relief on pension contributions at this same rate.\nThis means every £100 invested in a pension scheme costs them £60. And individuals earning over £125,140 get tax relief at 45 percent on pension contributions, which means investing £100 into a scheme costs them £55.\nThere are suggestions that the tax relief on pension contributions could be standardised across all workers at 30 percent to make the system fairer. This would mean assisting the vast majority of basic rate taxpayers to increase the value of their pension pots. At the same time, it would take some money away from better paid people.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that such a change could generate a net saving to the government worth around £2.7 billion a year. However, Amanda Blanc, the boss of pensions and insurance giant Aviva, has warned against changes that will discourage higher earners from contributing to pension schemes.\nAs Aviva released its half-year results, the company's CEO warned that Rachel Reeves should reconsider her stance on pension tax relief. She emphasised the importance of encouraging employees to contribute to their pensions a sector in which Aviva is a significant player to reduce their dependence on state support.\nThe CEO also argued that increased pension savings would result in more funds available for investment within the UK. She stated: \"On pensions tax relief I think we would just caution that if you really want people to save for the long-term pensions are a long-term game, they are not something that you do something with today and don't have consequences in five, ten, 15, 20 years' time.\n\"All we would say is that the Government thinks about the long-term impact.\" Investment experts at AJ Bell have suggested that changes to pension tax relief could mean millions of higher-rate taxpayers may need to make an additional four years of pension contributions to compensate for the loss in tax relief.\nMiss Blanc added: \"All we would say about anything that happens is that any government thinks about long-term impacts of policies.\" She made these comments as Aviva reported better than expected first-half results, with operating profits rising by 14 percent year-on-year to £875 million in the six months to the end of June, exceeding the £830 million forecast by City analysts.\nAviva, listed on the FTSE 100 and with significant operations in Canada, has seen a boost attributable in part to a rise in general insurance premiums within Britain and Ireland. These have surged by 18 percent to £3.8 billion.\nInsurers have been steadily increasing prices for motor and home coverage over the past couple of years in response to inflationary pressures. Rising costs associated with handling claims have had a significant impact on the industry's profitability.\n\"This surge in policy prices has brought forth criticism from those who suggest that insurers are exploiting the inflationary climate to unfairly profiteer off customers. Yet Aviva's CEO, Amanda Blanc, counters this view by stating: \"I don't think that the industry can be accused of profiteering.\"\nBlanc also expressed optimism about the UK's prospects, a sentiment likely to be welcomed by the government, which has prioritised economic growth. She added: \"We have spoken to over 200 investors so far this year, we've been all over the world,\" and noted that investor interest in the UK is significantly higher now than it was two years ago.",

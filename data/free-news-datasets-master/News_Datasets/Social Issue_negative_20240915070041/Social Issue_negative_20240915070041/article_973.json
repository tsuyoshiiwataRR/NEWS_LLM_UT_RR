    "text": "KPU Banyuwangi member for the Division of Voter Education, Community Participation, and Human Resources, Enot Sugiharto, stated that the pantarlih have been carrying out their duties from June 24 until 24 July. Enot mentioned that in performing their duties, pantarlih should not work merely at their desks but must go directly to the field by visiting local residents’ homes. “The goal is to ensure that the voter data for the upcoming Pilkada on 27 November is truly valid,” he stated on Wednesday.\nHe mentioned that during the post-election period, there have been several changes in voter data due to various factors. “There have indeed been changes in the data. For instance, some residents have passed away. Additionally, there are residents who were not of age in the last election but will be 17 years old for this Pilkada,” he continued. Therefore, Enot emphasized that such conditions require re-data collection through pantarlih. “This is done to ensure that the final voter list for the Pilkada is truly valid and accurate,” he explained.\nAs a party that gained ten seats in the 2019 vote and eleven seats in the 2024 vote, PKS has a firm grounding and can put forward a sole candidate pair for mayor and deputy mayor. Furthermore, the PKS Bogor DPD Chairman, Atang Trisnanto, has been put forward as a mayor nominee in the 2024 regional election. “Of course, PKS has the resources and strong position to determine the candidate for mayor. Be patient, we are expecting guidance from the DPP. (Regarding my name being mentioned), yes, it has surfaced, thank you for the support. We are certainly waiting for direction from the DPP. Any task given, we are ready, I must be ready,” said Atang on March 24, 2024.\n**PKS Offered Deputy Governor Position with Ridwan Kamil** PKS President Ahmad Syaikhu revealed that he received an offer for the deputy gubernatorial position to accompany Ridwan Kamil (RK) in the 2024 Jakarta Pilkada. The offer came from the Indonesian Forward Coalition (KIM) supporting Prabowo-Gibran in the 2024 Presidential Election. “There is that offer, which is why we are analyzing and considering what makes the most sense,” stated Syaikhu during an interview at the PKS DPP office, Jakarta, on Tuesday. However, regarding who PKS will support, Syaikhu said it is not yet final. He mentioned that communication with other parties for the Jakarta Pilkada is still ongoing. “We are continuously communicating to decide who will support Mr. Anies Rasyid Baswedan along with other parties. Therefore, communication with other parties is not yet final,” he said. Syaikhu mentioned that communication is being conducted with many parties, not just KIM. Intensive communication continues with their coalition in the 2024 Presidential Election, namely the Change Coalition.\nMeanwhile, the Banyuwangi Election Supervisory Board (Badan Pengawas Pemilu) has instructed its subordinates to closely monitor the process of voter data verification (pencocokan dan penelitian) for the 2024 Pilkada. The Division of Prevention, Community Participation, and Public Relations of Banyuwangi Bawaslu, Khomisa Kurnia Indra, announced that there are many aspects that need to be supervised during the coklit phase. According to her, after the determination of the 2024 election’s final voter list (DPT), there are many elements to observe leading up to the Pilkada, such as voters who have passed away, residents who are married but not yet 17 years old, residents who have moved, and new voters who have completed e-KTP recording.

To accommodate input from the community, during the coklit phase, all subdistrict election supervisors in Banyuwangi have been instructed to set up posts to safeguard voting rights and community complaint posts, either through social media, hotlines, or local offices. Additionally, she mentioned that it is equally important for subdistrict election supervisors to regularly conduct patrols to safeguard voting rights. “If any suspected violations by pantarlih are found, subdistrict election supervisors must issue a recommendation letter for correction through the PPK,” she concluded.\nFurthermore, HNW revealed that potential PKS cadres to be Anies’s deputy include PKS DKI Jakarta DPW Chair Khoirudin, PKS elected DPR RI member candidates, and Gamal Albinsaid. “However, all of this is still fluid, and the PKS DPP is still observing all developments to make a decision soon,” he stated.",

    "text": "Detroit judge temporarily off the bench for making sleepy teen wear jail clothes, handcuffs on court field trip\nA Detroit judge who ordered a teenager into jail clothes and handcuffs on a field trip to his courtroom will be off the bench while undergoing “necessary training,” the court's chief judge said Thursday.\nMeanwhile, the girl's mother said Judge Kenneth King was a “big bully.”\n“My daughter is hurt. She is feeling scared,\" Latoreya Till told the Detroit Free Press.\nShe identified her daughter as Eva Goodman. The 15-year-old fell asleep in King's court Tuesday while on a visit organized by a Detroit nonprofit.\nKing didn't like it. But he said it was her attitude that led to the jail clothes, handcuffs and stern words.\n“I wanted this to look and feel very real to her, even though there’s probably no real chance of me putting her in jail,\" he explained to WXYZ-TV.\nKing has been removed from his criminal case docket and will undergo “necessary training to address the underlying issues that contributed to this incident,” said William McConico, the chief judge at 36th District Court.\nThe court “remains deeply committed to providing access to justice in an environment free from intimidation or disrespect. The actions of Judge King on August 13th do not reflect this commitment,” McConico said.\nHe said the State Court Administrative Office approved the step. King will continue to be paid. Details about the training, and how long it would last, were not disclosed.\nKing, who has been a judge since 2006, didn't immediately return a phone message seeking comment.\nTill said her daughter was sleepy because the family doesn't have a permanent residence.\n“And so, that particular night, we got in kind of late,” she told the Free Press, referring to Monday night. \"And usually, when she goes to work, she’s up and planting trees or being active.”\nThe teen was seeing King’s court as part of a visit organized by The Greening of Detroit, a nonprofit environmental group.\n“Although the judge was trying to teach a lesson of respect, his methods were unacceptable,” said Marissa Ebersole Wood, the group's chairperson. “The group of students should have been simply asked to leave the courtroom if he thought they were disrespectful.”",

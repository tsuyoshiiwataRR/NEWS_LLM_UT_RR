    "text": "(The Center Square) – Republican lawmakers in Georgia are concerned about increases in inflation, as a recent report shows households have paid $27,427 more because of inflation since January 2021. The average household in the state is spending $1,074 more per month to buy the same goods and services as in 2021, according to a July report from the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee. To have the same standard of living as in 2021, a family in Georgia is spending $175 more per month. “At this rate, the only thing growing faster than my grocery bill is my disappointment. #kamalanomics,” said U.S. Rep. Mike Collins , in response to the report. Georgia ranks 28th in the nation for increased monthly inflation costs. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene pointed out how she believes many families are paying for those increases. “Between the first quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2024, credit card debt surged 48.1% while household debt – which includes mortgages and auto loans – rose by 21.6%,” she said on social media . “This path is simply unsustainable. Democrats are plunging our country into debt and making it near impossible for Americans to make ends meet.” On the other hand, Democrats from the state have been largely quiet on these economic issues. Families in the state have experienced a 22% increase in cumulative inflation since January 2021, putting Georgia 1.5% higher than the national average. Food, shelter, energy and transportation expenses are all up in Georgia. Compared to 2021, the average household in Georgia is spending, per month, $125 more on food, $265 more on shelter, $125 more on energy, and $277 more on transportation. In the past year, just like in other states , shelter saw the biggest increase at $57 more per month. U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick said it is Democratic policies leading to these increases. “While progressive Democrats gaslight Americans into believing that Bidenomics is working, Americans are still paying more for gas, groceries, and rent due to soaring inflation,” McCormick said on social media . “The numbers speak for themselves and progressive Democrats own this CRISIS.”",

    "text": "Hi there. I live in a corner house beside a large green and approx twice a week kids ring my door bell several times and run off. My electric gate buzzer broke due to the kids holding down the button. I’ve three young kids (one a newborn) and it upsets my middle child greatly. Often you can see them walking past my house looking in my windows to see if anyone is home and hiding in the bushes beside my house. It interrupts feeding my newborn and everything else a SAHM does for three small kids! This evening, three boys (Approx 10-12) came up my driveway and rang the bell approx 5 times. They ran away laughing, I understand it’s just a funny prank to them. I recognised one of the boys who has done this before and walked around to his family home with my kids. I spoke to the mom, introduced myself and respectfully requested that her child doesn’t do what he did again please. I was calm and friendly. Immediately the mother got very agressive. She said how dare I come to her home like this. She said she was busy WFH and had two of her sons friends over for a play date. She said it was a circus that I’d brought my kids. I said I need to care for my children and can’t not bring them with me. I left then as she was clearly offended I had called and being honest I was totally taken aback by her aggression. Her son admitted to what he did but denied having done it before. I’m now really beginning to hate my house as feel so exposed. My DH works days at a time and I’m on my own a lot. I know they are only kids but it’s not nice to see them coming up the driveway. It’s also not nice being spoken to so derogatory. Admittedly post pregnancy my confidence isn’t that high and not I’m beginning to doubt whether i should of asked the boy to stop. It seems like a minor issue I know but I don’t like it happening. Apart from that I’m very happy at home with my children and getting out and about with them and my neighbours. Thanks for reading. Sorry for the long post.",

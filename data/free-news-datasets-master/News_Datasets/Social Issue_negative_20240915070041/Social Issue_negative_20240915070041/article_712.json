    "text": "Sweden's public health agency confirmed that a more dangerous variant of mpox virus, has been reported in a person, who stayed in mpox CLADE I outbreak area in Africa.\n\"We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called clade I,\" Jakob Forssmed, the health and social affairs minister, said during the press conference.\nClade I, which is endemic to Central African countries, is considered more lethal than clade II. Both clade I and clade II are primary strains of the mpox virus, formerly known as monkeypox virus.\nThe director-general of the health agency, Olivia Wigzell, said that the infected person is under treatment in the Stockholm area.\n\"The case is the first caused by clade I that has been diagnosed outside the African continent. The affected person has also been infected during a stay in an area of Africa where there is a large outbreak of mpox clade I,\" Wigzell said.\nThe announcement comes hours after the World Health Organization declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.",

    "text": "Married at First Sight Australia star Lauren Dunn has blasted trolls after naked photos of her were leaked online. The star appeared in the 11th season of the reality show, coupling up with Jonathan McCullough during the experiment before separating ahead of the final commitment ceremony. Despite not finding love on the show, Lauren has remained popular with fans ever since, and shared a video on her Instagram Stories in which she recalled a situation from her past which she is now being trolled over. Related: MAFS star JJ Slater shares loved-up photo with Katie Price“I’ve got a little story for you guys,” she began. “About 10 years ago, my ex at the time - I think, I don’t know if it was him, it could’ve been someone else - leaked a topless photo that I had sent. And everyone ended up getting it, it was everywhere. “It wasn’t a big deal - I mean, we’ve all got tits and nipples so whatever - but lately I’ve been getting a lot of messages saying that they’ve got the photo. I’ve even had random troll accounts trying to blackmail me with it. I’ll post the photo - I look good. So swipe to the next slide for said nude.”“Here she is in all her glory,” she quipped as she posted a censored version of the image. “So if you didn’t have the photo like everyone else did, here it is. Obviously I can’t post nipples on here but you know, use your imagination.” Related: MAFS star Lucinda Light praised by co-star for 'following her heart'Turning on a more serious note, she then urged people to not share other people's photos: “Don’t leak each other’s nudes - it’s actually illegal. \\\"This dude is lucky that I don’t care. I wouldn’t have sent it if I didn’t think someone was going to see it. However, that’s not usually the case. There’s laws against this for a reason so don’t do it.” Married at First Sight UK airs on E4 in the UK.

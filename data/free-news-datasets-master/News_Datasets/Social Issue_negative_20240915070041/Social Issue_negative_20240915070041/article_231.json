    "text": "Three Jewish advocacy groups filed a federal complaint against the Fulton County school district over alleged antisemitic bullying against Jewish students since the Israel-Hamas war broke out on Oct. 7. The complaint said administrators failed to take action when Jewish and Israeli students faced harassment. The school district has fostered a hostile climate that has allowed antisemitism to thrive in its schools, the complaint said. In a written statement, the Fulton County district denied the allegations. The private groups efforts to depict Fulton County Schools as promoting or even tolerating antisemitism is false, the statement said. The organizations filed the complaint under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act with the U.S. Department of Education on Aug. 6. Title IV prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin. The complaint follows a wave of antisemitism allegations against schools and universities across the country. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group, filed a similar complaint in July against the Philadelphia school district, one of the country's largest public school systems.

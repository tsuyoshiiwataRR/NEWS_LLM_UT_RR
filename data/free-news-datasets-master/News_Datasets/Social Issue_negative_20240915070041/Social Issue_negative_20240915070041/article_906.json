    "text": "Photo by FlyD on unsplash\nData Breach Has Gathered 2.9 Billion Social Security Numbers and Identities\nAugust 15, 2024\nA monumental data security breach has taken place, and a San Francisco law firm has shared a press release with information about the incident and what can be done about it.\nThe law firm,\nSchubert Jonckheer & Kolbe LLP, is investigating the unauthorized access of over 2.9 billion records allegedly belonging to Jerico Pictures Inc., operating as National Public Data (NPD), a Florida-based background-check company.\nNPD is a company that compiles a multitude of data from all sorts of accessible records and sources. Unfortunately, the company seems to have been targeted by a cybercriminal group known as “USDod.”\nIn April 2024, the USDod group claimed to have stolen a vast amount of personal information, such as Social Security numbers, from NPD and offered to sell the data on the dark web for $3.5 million. The breach raises serious concerns, as many individuals may be unaware that their private information was collected and compromised.\nThe company has not officially acknowledged a data breach. However,\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that it has been informing those who reached out via email that “we are aware of certain third-party claims about consumer data and are investigating these issues.”\nFurthermore,\nBleepingComputer claims that although it could not verify if this leak includes data for every individual in the U.S., several sources have confirmed that their personal information, as well as that of their family members — including deceased individuals — was found in the leak.\nAs the investigation unfolds, NPD has yet to confirm the breach or disclose the extent of the stolen data. Experts warn that those affected could face risks of identity theft and financial fraud. Individuals who believe their information may have been compromised are encouraged to seek legal advice, as they may be entitled to damages and changes in NPD’s cybersecurity practices. For more information on legal rights related to this incident, affected individuals can visit the law firm’s website or contact them directly.\nMultiple\nclass action lawsuits have already been filed against Jerico Pictures for not protecting people’s data effectively, according to BleepingComputer.\nRecent News\nBanana Republic Launches a Newly Redesigned Store in LA\nLos\nNew\nHillary Super will begin in the role starting Sept. 9, 2024.\nBest\nKlarna has released details about new ",

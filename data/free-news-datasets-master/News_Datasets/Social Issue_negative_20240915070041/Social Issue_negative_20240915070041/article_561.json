    "text": "UTICA, N.Y. -- The World Health Organization recently announced a global health emergency due to mpox. Three cases have been reported locally—two in Oneida County and one in Otsego County, [according to the New York State Health Department tracking map](https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/zoonoses/mpox/data/). Mpox, also known as monkeypox, is a viral illness spreading quickly in Africa. Since the start of the year, Africa has recorded over 17,000 cases and more than 500 deaths. There is concern with a certain strain of mpox. “We remain vigilant and are closely monitoring the spread of the clade I mpox variant that is currently circulating countries in Africa—and while there are currently no known cases of this variant in the U.S., we are taking proactive measures now to encourage those at risk to get fully vaccinated, which means two doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine,” State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said. “Health care providers should be vigilant and ask about travel when presented with patients who might have contracted mpox. While mpox cases remain low in New York State, and we have not yet seen a case of this mpox variant circulating here, I want everyone to take measures to protect themselves,” McDonald said. The state health department said that there are enough doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine—now available commercially. The State has information [here](https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/zoonoses/mpox/exposed.htm) for individuals who become sick or exposed to mpox. [Click here](https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/zoonoses/mpox/vaccine.htm) for more about the mpox vaccine.",

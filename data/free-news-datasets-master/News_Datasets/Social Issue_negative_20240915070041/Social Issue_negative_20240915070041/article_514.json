    "text": "Common household product identified as cause of home explosion in Maine neighborhood, officials say SINCLAIR, Maine ( [WAGM](https://www.wagmtv.com/2024/08/14/propane-explosion-sinclair-highlights-dangers-safety-precautions/)/Gray News) - Officials said a product many people use was the cause of an explosion that took place in Maine on Saturday. The Maine Fire Marshal’s Office said the explosion in Sinclair was caused by propane, with the gas igniting and leading to mass destruction in a neighborhood. Barabra Deschaine said she was at home when her neighbor’s house exploded. “I heard a boom and I felt like the floor was going to cave into the cellar and the roof was going to fall in on top of me,” she said. “I looked out the window, and there was debris flying all over.” The Fire Marshal’s Office said the propane explosion sent debris across the street, into the nearby lakes and onto the rooftops of neighboring buildings. Deschaine’s home was damaged when debris from the explosion blew through the walls of the garage. Windows were blown out in other neighboring buildings. Another residence caught fire before it was destroyed. “We’re fortunate that so many fire departments came to help because it could have been a lot worse,” Deschaine said. Propane is a gas people commonly use and have in their homes. Although it is used daily, it can be dangerous if used incorrectly. Propane leaks can happen for many reasons, including valves left open, old tanks used, or pressure changes, among other reasons. When a leak happens, the gas can give off a distinct smell. However, even with the distinct smell, North Lakes Deputy Fire Chief Derrick Ouellette said the gas may not be noticed. “Propane is heavier in the air so it tends to lie in low places so sometimes it is hard to detect,” he said. Ouellette said there are other ways to watch for a propane leak if the smell cannot be detected. “If your consumption has gone up and you haven’t used any more than usual, there’s a sign right there,” he said. He recommends that people who use propane also use propane gas detectors as a precaution. Copyright 2024 WAGM via Gray Local Media, Inc. All rights reserved.",

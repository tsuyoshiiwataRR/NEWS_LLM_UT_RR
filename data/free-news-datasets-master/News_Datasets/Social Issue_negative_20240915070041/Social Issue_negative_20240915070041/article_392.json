    "text": "National foundation preparing class action lawsuit against district, claims violence is affecting students’ mental health GARFIELD HEIGHTS, Ohio (WOIO) - A national foundation is announcing that a protest will be held in Garfield Heights next week to denounce the brutal student violence and the school district’s failure to address the situation. Foundation officials say they’re also preparing a class-action lawsuit against school officials, on behalf of students who have been affected by that violence. Over the past few months, 19 Investigates’ reports have documented dozens of brutal student fights and rising teacher resignations at Garfield Heights schools. That’s why The One in Five Foundation for Kids decided to take action. They’re a nonprofit organization based in Dallas, Texas. Their mission is to help reduce school violence and student bullying. Now that their efforts to work with Garfield Heights school officials have failed ― they’ve announced that a student protest will be held next Wednesday at Garfield Heights High School. Meanwhile, Jennifer West, a representative with The One In Five Foundation For Kids, emailed 19 Investigates a press release stating the foundation will continue its efforts regardless of whether the district cooperates. “Despite ongoing attempts by our group to address concerns and meet with school officials diplomatically, they continue to hide behind silent, closed doors despite our foundation and others within the community attempts to seek answers to ensure the safety and wellbeing of students,” wrote West. The foundation says it’s preparing to take legal action against district officials, stating, “Formal complaints…with the State board of education and several other state law influencers have been officially drafted with a class action suit now being more seriously considered to address mental health effects of the ongoing violence within district schools & its effects on several students mental health, as more families express concern & an increasing desire to become involved. We are learning of several students from Garfield Heights whose families have sought counseling over the violence.” The foundation also announced it will hold a hunger strike to raise awareness and hopefully prompt district officials to cooperate. “No students from Garfield Heights are participating at this time,” said West. “At this juncture a few of our older student ambassadors, however, from Texas, California & Arizona, along with 2 board members, including Mr. Chapin (founder), are continuing the protest. We are truly trying to discourage students themselves from participating in the fast aspect of our protest, due to the seriousness of potential health consequences,” said West. A Facebook post from the school district last Friday claims that incidents of student behavior decreased 25% in the last year. It says the district will have 6 security officers at the Middle School and at the High School there will also be 6 officers ― plus an additional School Resource Officer. Officials say they’re also intensifying their Progressive Discipline Policy. The post states the district will now have a Dean of Culture at each building to handle student discipline. And to discourage any distractions ― Middle School students will now be required to put their cell phones in Yondr bags during class hours. 19 Investigates reached out to the district for comment but hasn’t heard back. The Foundation says the protest will be held at Garfield Heights High School on Wednesday, August 21 at 4pm. Copyright 2024 WOIO. All rights reserved.",

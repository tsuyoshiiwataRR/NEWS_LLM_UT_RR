    "text": "Sidhu Moose Wala&#039;s father Sardar Balkaur Singh Sidhu expresses anguish on Independence Day: Calls for justice for victims of violence On this Independence Day, the father of late Punjabi singer and actor Sidhu Moose Wala voiced his deep frustration over the lack of justice for victims of violent crimes. Taking to social media, he highlighted that even after 78 years of independence, many are still denied the basic rights to justice and security. In a poignant tweet, Sidhu Moose Wala’s father lamented the state of justice in the country, referencing both his son&#039;s tragic death and the recent case of Moumita, a doctor from Kolkata, who was a victim of brutal rape. He tweeted, “This Independence Day, we witnessed how 78 years of freedom couldn&#039;t deliver justice to victims of rape and murder—how the &#039;FREEDOM&#039; of our rights are destroyed.” The tweet, which included the hashtags #KolkataDoctor, #JusticeForMoumita, and #JusticeForSidhuMooseWala, resonated with many. It also drew attention to the ongoing fight for justice for both Sidhu Moose Wala, who was tragically killed in 2022, and a medical student, whose case has sparked widespread outrage. Sidhu Moose Wala, a popular figure in the Punjabi music and film industry, was gunned down in a targeted attack, leaving his fans and family in shock and mourning. His father has consistently used social media to advocate for justice, keeping the memory of his late son alive and demanding accountability. Despite over two years passing since Sidhu’s tragic death, he remains unwavering in his pursuit of justice. His relentless efforts are bolstered by the steadfast support of Sidhu’s fans and family, who stand united in this ongoing fight. Further, the mention of #JusticeForMoumita, a doctor whose life was cut short under horrifying circumstances, serves as a reminder of the ongoing violence faced by women in the country and the urgent need for reform. Even Bollywood stars like Alia Bhatt and Parineeti Chopra have taken to their respective social media platforms to condemn the heinous act. For more news like this visit TOI.

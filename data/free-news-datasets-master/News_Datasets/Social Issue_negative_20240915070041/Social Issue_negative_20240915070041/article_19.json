    "text": "[Nebraska recently filed suit](https://www.dataprivacyandsecurityinsider.com/2024/08/details-of-state-of-nebraska-and-doj-complaints-against-tiktok/) against TikTok, and the details of the harms associated with using TikTok by children are outlined in the [complaint](https://ago.nebraska.gov/news/released-excerpts-internal-tiktok-documents). Although the complaint seeks redress only for Nebraskans, the allegations are relevant to parents in all states. We expect our state and federal governments to make laws that protect children from the sale and marketing of harmful products, such as alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and pornography. According to allegations by the Nebraska Attorney General, using TikTok is just as harmful to the health and well-being of children as alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. The use of TikTok by children is addicting. TikTok knows it, and it is marketing specifically to children because they are unable to understand dangers of its use. TikTok is not restricting the content that children can view, including “mature and inappropriate content, content related to eating disorders, sadness and suicide, and pornography.” Parents: you can’t rely on TikTok to protect your child, particularly after reading Nebraska’s complaint. Take a hard look at the complaint so you can understand how TikTok is harming your child.—",

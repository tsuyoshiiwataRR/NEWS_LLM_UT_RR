    "text": "[Yesterday, we told you](https://twitchy.com/amy-curtis/2024/08/14/judge-blocks-ucla-from-allowing-antisemitic-goons-to-block-jews-on-campous-n2399618) a federal judge blocked UCLA from assisting or allowing antisemitic bigots to harass and discriminate against Jewish students. This is the correct ruling. UCLA administrators allowed the pro-Hamas goons to give their [allies armbands to access buildings, and to bar anyone](https://twitchy.com/amy-curtis/2024/05/01/ucla-wristbands-for-anti-israel-students-to-enter-buildings-n2395761) -- mostly Jews -- who didn't have them. This is a direct violation of Title VI of federal civil rights law. UCLA appealed that ruling today. Breaking: UCLA has filed an appeal to the 9th Circuit challenging the injunction which ruled that the university could not allow the discrimination and exclusion of Jewish students on UCLA campus.‚Äî Eyal Yakoby (@EYakoby) UCLA continues to prove that they‚Äôre antisemitism is a systemic problem. [pic.twitter.com/2HliPFsqMy] [August 15, 2024] There is no other way to interpret this than the administration of UCLA condones antisemitism and discrimination against Jewish students. It is beyond despicable. They‚Äôre going to lose again.‚Äî The Flag Guy (@TheFlagGuy_) They‚Äôre always losers. [August 15, 2024] Yeah, they'll lose. But the fact they decided to appeal this decision speaks volumes about them. This is shocking behavior from a school with significant Jewish alumni.‚Äî Seth J. RiklinüéóÔ∏è‚òÆÔ∏èüá∫üá∏ü§†üáÆüá±üõ© (@sethriklin) [August 15, 2024] Their hatred of Jews doesn't seem to extend to endowments, apparently. Here's proof that‚Äî David Wohl (@DavidWohl) [@UCLA]wants to continue its campaign of hate, harassment and intimidation against Jewish students. If this school is not shut down immediately by the feds, it will be when Trump reassumes office. [August 15, 2024] Recommended It will be an interesting case study to see what schools, if any, face consequences for blatantly violating federal civil rights laws. Jews should find a new university system to go to. These folks have lost their minds‚Äî Johnny Riggs üêä (@JohnnyRiggs9) [August 15, 2024] On one hand, we understand this thinking. Go where they won't discriminate against you. On the other hand, they have a right to be there and should fight to remove the systemic rot from UCLA and every other institution. UCLA really, really wants to discriminate‚Äî Nicole Levitt (@LevittNicole7) [https://t.co/vqadsOiNoQ] [August 15, 2024] YUP. They want to enable the pro-Hamas loons to do the dirty work for them. UCLA is adamant that anti-discrimination laws must not apply to Jews. Gavin Newsom is the head of the UC system and could stop UCLA from pursuing its anti-Semitic agenda. But he wants to be president someday and the Democrat Party does not tolerate opposition to Jew hatred.‚Äî Ayn Reagan (@AynReagan) [https://t.co/69WW5yEIIK] [August 15, 2024] There's a reason Kamala chose [Walz over Shapiro](https://twitchy.com/samj/2024/08/06/breaking-kamalas-vp-pick-is-n2399296) for her running mate. Seriously? UCLA is appealing this ruling? Maybe they should change their name from UCLA to hitler U.‚Äî Larree (@larreehollywood) [https://t.co/BRORwlE7DH] [August 15, 2024] Would be more fitting. Seriously, remember this when the Left accuses the right of being Nazis. Laugh in their faces. The real question remains, why hasn't the DoJ come in and shut down UCLA? Where is the‚Äî Yore Friend Whig üáÆüá± (@WhigJust) [@CivilRights]Division? Do Jews not count? [https://t.co/Sg7KrruaAh] [August 15, 2024] Because Jews don't count. This writer will lay down the marker now: the DOJ will be much harder on schools that violate the new Title IX rules than they'll be on any college that allows discrimination against Jews.",

We take a roadtrip to find out Buc-ee's, a gas station convenience store chain founded in Texas in the 1980s, has developed a cult following online. Does it live up to the hype? McClatchy - Raleigh News & Observer Buc-ee's famous beaver mascot likely has one fewer fan after a man allegedly tripped and fell while visiting the chain store, according to a lawsuit out of South Carolina.\nRichard E. Brown, of Kershaw County, SC, is suing the cult-favorite gas station slash convenience store after he allegedly tripped over a rope tying down a large inflatable beaver at a Buc-ee's in Florence County, according to court documents.\nBrown says the fall caused several injuries, especially to his right shoulder, causing him to incur medical costs and experience \"physical pain, suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, and impairment of health and bodily efficiency.\"\nBusted with Buc-ee's toy: Marijuana and ecstasy found inside Buc-ee's plush toys during traffic stop in Texas\nLawsuit claims Buc-ee's was negligent The suit, filed in Florence County on Aug. 1, says Brown was walking on the sidewalk outside the Florence location in May of 2022 when he tripped over a rope running from the base of the inflatable beaver mascot to the anchor point across the street.\nThe \"great physical harm to the body and limbs\" Brown says he suffered was a result of negligence on behalf of Buc-ee's, the lawsuit claims. The store is accused of failing to fulfill its obligation to properly maintain the sidewalk and exercise \"reasonable care\" to protect the public from hazards.\nThe suit also alleges that the Buc-ee's location was aware of the rope's \"dangerous condition\" before the incident but failed to repair or remedy the hazard in time, amounting to careless, reckless, wanton, and/or willful negligence.\nCourt documents did not specify the amount of financial damages Brown is seeking. Buc-ee's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

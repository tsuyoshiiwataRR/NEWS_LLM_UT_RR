    "text": "JERUSALEM, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- An annual social survey published by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed that 32 percent of Israeli adults, or about 2 million people, were dissatisfied with their economic situation in 2023. The survey examined the welfare of the country's population and the concessions residents make due to financial difficulties. As part of the survey, 6,474 people aged 20 and over were interviewed, representing about 6.2 million people of the age range, out of the total Israeli population of about 9.9 million. The survey also found that 9.5 percent of those aged 20 and over, representing about 587,000 adults, felt they were poor last year, while 26 percent of those polled said they were unable to cover monthly household expenses. Besides, 7.4 percent made concessions on food purchases and 4.9 percent gave up having a hot meal at least once every two days due to economic difficulties, the survey showed. Regarding health matters, 9.7 percent of the participants gave up medical care they needed, 6.2 percent gave up buying prescription drugs, and 25 percent skipped dental care due to financial difficulties, according to the survey. â– ",

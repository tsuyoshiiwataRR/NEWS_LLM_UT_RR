    "text": "ADHD Video Call Diagnosis – A BBC Panorama Investigation Finds\nPatients are being diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed powerul drugs after unreliable video call assessments at private adhd diagnosis scotland cost clinics according to an BBC Panorama investigation has found. The undercover investigation occurred after tips were received. Dozens of patients and whistleblowers were interviewed.\nMany people are forced to pay for private assessments due to the NHS waiting list. But is it effective?\nWhy do I require an individual diagnosis?\nIf you believe that you or someone you know suffers from ADHD It’s essential to find a doctor who can assess your condition and provide the proper treatment. While a lot of people choose to go with the NHS however, a private diagnosis can often be more effective and save you both time and money in the long run.\nThere are some concerns about the capacity of the NHS to meet current demands for ADHD assessments. Patients are waiting for weeks or months to get an appointment. This can be extremely distressing for those who are affected. Many feel that the NHS assessment services aren’t as effective as they could be.\nIn light of these problems it’s not surprising that more adults are opting to go for an appointment with a private physician. The BBC Panorama investigation raised serious concerns about the quality of care offered by private clinics. The undercover documentary revealed that some clinics were rushing through tests over the phone and told patients they were suffering from ADHD when, in fact, they did not.\nA private assessment will usually begin with a series of screening questionnaires you are asked to complete and return to your doctor. The screenings are designed and standardised to determine if you show symptoms of ADHD. The results of these tests help the doctor decide if it is appropriate to schedule an appointment for diagnosis.\nThe clinician will then conduct a detailed review of your medical and family history, and how the symptoms of ADHD affect your daily life. The clinician will also perform physical examinations and cognitive tests. Based on your situation you will then be diagnosed with ADHD and given a detailed treatment plan.\nAfter you’ve been diagnosed with ADHD The doctor will write to your GP with a request for a’shared-care agreement’. This permits you to continue receiving NHS medication while paying only the NHS prescription fee. You can also consult your personal doctor to attend appointments and receive CBT therapy if necessary.\nWhat happens if I do not receive a diagnosis?\nIn the case of ADHD, a good diagnosis and treatment plan can make all the difference. However, the NHS process for diagnosing ADHD is lengthy and difficult. Some adults are unable to wait that long to seek out private specialists to determine their situation. This can save you time and stress, but it is important to keep in mind that it is not a guarantee of an accurate diagnosis.\nA professional with experience diagnosing ADHD can provide a more thorough evaluation than a psychiatrist on the NHS. This may include a medical examination and tests like hearing or vision. It may also include checklists and questionnaires. The person conducting the test will also ask about your family background and your social and medical history, and will also inquire about your symptoms. They could also employ the standard ADHD scales for rating and may also ask your caregivers or teachers to evaluate you.\nWhen assessing adult ADHD the doctor will look at five or more symptoms that have been present for at least six months and are serious enough to interfere in the home or in the workplace. They will also look at whether the symptoms are related to mental health issues in other ways. Depression and anxiety, for example, can cause ADHD-like signs. They will also assess your social and work history to rule out any issues such as financial difficulties or a history of abuse, and alcohol or drug abuse.\nDuring the NHS assessment the psychiatrist or other healthcare professional will tell you if they believe you don’t meet the criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD. They will explain their reasoning and you can request another assessment if you disagree with their decision.\nIf you have an official diagnosis of ADHD may decide to discuss this with their GP, and the GP can then refer them to shared management through the NHS. Adults who have been diagnosed with ADHD can get medication in this way. However, doctors have been known to be reluctant to prescribe ADHD medication because they aren’t experts in the disorder and because it’s costly.\nWhat is my next step if I disagree with my diagnosis?\nIt is important to remember that your doctor must be respectful and empathetic to your feelings and concerns. They will understand that unmanaged ADHD symptoms can cause major problems for families and individuals. If your clinician disagrees with the diagnosis, he or she might be able to suggest alternative treatments and diagnoses that are more suitable for you.\nIf your clinician decides you do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD They will explain the reason. You may have not provided enough information about your issues or they may think that another disorder is more responsible for your symptoms (traits). If you’re not happy with the decision, you can seek another opinion from a different doctor or follow the NHS complaints process.\nIf you choose to go private or take advantage of NHS healthcare waiting times for an appointment can be lengthy, and it’s worth considering that your clinician may find the process difficult. The NHS is overstretched and it’s not the fault of the people affected.\nGPs are also having difficulty navigating the complicated process of diagnosing ADHD and autism (and neurodivergence as a whole). They must ensure that they offer a high-quality service that is both safe and fair, as well as meet the prescriptions for shared care that are set by the GMC.\nUnfortunately, Panorama’s expose has exposed that private clinics are using a shortened diagnostic approaches and this can put people at risk. This is a national issue and a valid reason to look at alternatives.\nIt is also important to remember that the stigma associated with being diagnosed as ADHD can make it difficult for some people receive a diagnosis. This is especially true when they are of a minority ethnic background, assigned female at birth or have other social and health situations that could influence how medical professionals interpret the symptoms they present.\nIf you’re suffering from unmanaged ADHD symptoms and feel your life is being negatively affected, we are here to assist.

You can get an adult ADHD assessment through the NHS. You can ask your GP to refer you to one of the specialist centers in England or use the ‘Right to Choose” method, which is quicker.\nYour appointment will include an authenticated assessment as well as a medical interview and an online questionnaire.

The effects of medication last for a long time, and they can cause serious adverse effects when taken improperly.\nThe doctor will issue you an appointment and a treatment plan if you decide to take medication.

It is essential to be aware of other non-pharmacological ways to manage ADHD symptoms. These include exercise, diet and cognitive behavior therapy.\nThe BBC Panorama ‘expose’ of private clinics that diagnose ADHD has sparked a lot of debate, particularly because it suggests that patients are misdiagnosed because of insufficient clinical assessments. We hesitate to claim that this isn’t true because humans aren’t exact creatures, and psychiatry barely is a science. If you’re struggling with ADHD symptoms and are frustrated by the NHS wait times, then it is possible to take out an individual assessment.",

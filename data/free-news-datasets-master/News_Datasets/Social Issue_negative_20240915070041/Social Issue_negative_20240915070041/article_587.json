    "text": "By The JKS Staff Aug 15, 2024\nPhoto: APU GOMES / AFP / Getty Images\nFollowing a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing cities to clear homeless encampments, Long Beach has unveiled a new strategy to address the issue. The city's plan, announced by Mayor Rex Richardson, includes measures such as citing or arresting individuals who refuse to leave encampments, though the mayor emphasizes this will be a last resort.\nLong Beach has seen a decline in its homeless population , but the issue remains pressing. In response to state pressure, including Governor Gavin Newsom's warning to withhold funding from non-compliant cities, Long Beach aims to tackle the problem decisively.\nThe city's approach, outlined in an 11-page report, focuses on compassionate solutions and involves providing advance notice before clearing encampments. Long Beach is also working to expand resources for housing and outreach, striving to avoid merely relocating the problem. Mayor Richardson emphasized the goal of creating safe, clean communities while avoiding shifting the issue to other areas.",

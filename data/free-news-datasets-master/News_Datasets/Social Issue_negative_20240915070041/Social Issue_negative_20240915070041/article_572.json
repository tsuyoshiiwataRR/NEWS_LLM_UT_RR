    "text": "A New Patriotic Party (NPP) stalwart, Gabby Otchere-Darko has strongly criticised those who believe in the authenticity of the “Agyapadeɛ” document, describing such belief as irrational and questioning the intelligence of its proponents. In an interview on Channel One TV on Tuesday (13 August), Otchere-Darko addressed the claims surrounding the document, which some allege contains predictions of current political events. He dismissed these claims, asserting that they stem from a lack of critical analysis. “If any intelligent person or a person who considers him or herself intelligent, believes that a family that has one of their leaders being offered the opportunity to lead the country would sit down and conspire evil against the nation and put the picture of the overlord or the head of the family on that document, you must have your head examined if you believe that—you must have your head examined,” Otchere-Darko said. “When I hear people try to say that things in the book are happening, let me explain to you and it’s a very imbecilic statement to even hear because it comes from a non-analytical appreciation of what is in that fiction,” he added. “Agyapadeɛ” is a 38-page document alleged to outline a plot for state capture orchestrated by influential figures of Akyem descent. The document, which lacks an identifiable author, portrays the Okyenhene, Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin, on its cover. Inside, it features images of President Nana Akufo-Addo alongside his father, former President Edward Akufo-Addo. The text is purported to lay out a strategy to establish the Akyem kingdom as the most powerful in the country.

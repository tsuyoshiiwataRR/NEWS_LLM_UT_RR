    "text": "By Katie Campbell ,\n22 hours ago\nMore than two months after 17-year-old Amarr Murphy-Paine was gunned down in the parking lot of Garfield High School, the Seattle Police Department has not made an arrest.\nRELATED: 17-year-old student dies after being shot multiple times at Seattle’s Garfield High School\nMurphy-Paine was shot and killed on June 6 after reportedly trying to break up a fight. An image of the alleged shooter standing over Murphy-Paine was circulated to police in an attempt to identify the suspect, who police have not publicly identified. Police have said only that the suspect was a high school-aged male who was wearing a red hoodie.\nAsked about the delay Wednesday, an SPD spokesperson acknowledged \"that updated information is important for Seattle community members\" but declined to share details in an email: \"The SPD Homicide Unit said the investigation continues to move forward and there’s been significant progress. They cannot release any specifics at this time as to keep the integrity of the investigation.\nA spokesperson for Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell told KUOW his office is \"satisfied with the work of the detectives and the level of resources being dedicated towards it.\"\nKUOW also reached out to Seattle Public Schools and Garfield High School Principal Tarance Hart for comment. This story will be updated if and when they respond.\nRELATED : 'It's not just a Garfield problem.' Students, families push for community safety measures following school shooting\nOn the day Murphy-Paine was shot, parents and students caught outside of the school on their lunch break spoke to KUOW, expressing frustration and fear after one of their fellow students had again been the victim of gun violence .\nIn March, a 17-year-old girl was shot in the leg near the school. She was not the intended target, according to police.\nIn October 2023, a series of incidents involving two students put the school on lockdown.\nThen in June 2023, three nearby shootings, which did not involve students, also led to a lockdown.\nStudents will return to Garfield High on Sept. 4.\nAs they prepare to head back to classrooms, a chunk of money that city leaders promised would go toward student mental health resources will be allocated elsewhere.\nCity leaders had promised $20 million last fall for things like school-based counselors, telehealth therapy, and youth violence prevention. That was cut back to about $10 million earlier this year.\nRELATED : Seattle City Council votes against restoring student mental health funds back to $20 million again\nOn Tuesday, Seattle City Councilmember Tammy Morales proposed restoring that to the full amount of $20 million; her proposal failed. Instead, the Council voted unanimously to add an additional $2.5 million, bringing the total allocation to $12.5 million.\nIngraham High School senior Cici Kennedy — who was present when a fellow student was shot and killed at Ingraham High School in 2022 — told KUOW she was \"hurt\" by the decision.\n\"It just kind of felt like we were devaluing mental health support in general and not giving it the attention that it should be given in terms of money,\" she said. \"It's just not enough.\"\nRELATED: A year after a shooting at Seattle's Ingraham High, students remain traumatized — and they want change\nA spokesperson from Harrell's office, responding Wednesday to request for comment on the lack of an arrest in the Garfield High case, said student health and safety are priorities for the mayor.\n\"We are pleased that the City’s mid-year supplemental budget includes new funding towards youth violence prevention and interruption programs as well as new mental health resources like telehealth and school-based counselors,\" spokesperson Callie Craighead said in an email. \"We are continuing to work in partnership with Seattle Public Schools on safety plans for the upcoming school year, including at Garfield High School. ... We will share more details on these efforts to reduce gun violence and strengthen safety for youth later this summer as we approach the school year.\"\nUpdate, 4:20 p.m. on Wednesday, 8/14/2024: This story has been updated with comments from Mayor Bruce Harrell's office.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

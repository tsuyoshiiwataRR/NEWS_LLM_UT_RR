    "text": "Angel Reese will be featured for the first time in a video game when NBA 2K25 is released on September 6. She was awarded a controversial 90 overall, which is the same as Caitlin Clark, but people are finding the videos of Reese in-game to be the most unrealistic\nIn the video below, Reese hits a step-back jumper with ease. Of course, when the clip was posted, people weren’t holding back on their thoughts.\n“This must be a scene from when the CPU decides the tighten the game up by doing things that never happen,” someone said on X.\n“We know this game is wack yet again. She would have missed that off the side of the backboard, gotten the rebound, missed 3 easy layups, then beg for a foul,” said another.\nAlso Read:\nFirst-Look Photos Of Caitlin Clark & Angel Reese In NBA 2K25 Have Been Revealed, And They’re Absolutely Jaw-Dropping\n“Has she made a single jump shot in her career. She’s the\nRudy Gobert of the WNBA without the elite rim protection,” added a third.\nClick on ‘Follow Us’ and get notified of the most viral WNBA stories via Google!\nFollow Us\n“I thought this was supposed to be realistic. No way she ever makes that shot,” commented a fourth.\nHowever, even if people claim that it’s not realistic and should be fixed, there’s no denying that this is the most talked about installment of the\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association in 2K since it was first added in 2K20.\nAngel Reese Earns a 90 Overall in 2K25\nReese is one of just two WNBA rookies to earn themselves a 90 overall in 2K25, along with Caitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever. No other rookies were better than an 80 overall.\nThis, of course, just turned into another aspect of the game people disagreed with.\n“Not even trolling and genuinely asking – if her overall is a 90, what stats specifically does Angel have a 90 in other than rebounding?” one commenter said.\nAlso Read:\nVIDEO: Trailer Released For Thrilling Documentary About LSU Stars Angel Reese, Olivia Dunne, Jayden Daniels & Flau’jae Johnson That Everyone Needs To See",

    "text": "Donald Trump will once again be addressing the press…\nAccording to a Fox News report, former President and 2024 GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump will be back out in front of the press taking questions on Thursday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\nThis is the second straight week the former president has grabbed headlines by holding a news conference. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris hasn’t held a press conference in 25 days since becoming the presumptive Democratic Party presidential nominee.\nKamala’s campaign says there may be sit-down interviews eventually.\n“We will commit to directly engage with the voters that are actually gonna decide this election and that is gonna be complete with rallies, with sit-down interviews, with press conferences, with all the digital assets we have at our disposal,” Harris campaign communications director Michael Tyler told CNN yesterday.\nTrump enthusiastically announced staff updates via a TRUTH Social post on Thursday, stressing that the enthusiasm surrounding his campaign is great:\nWe’re leading in almost all Polls, in some cases leading by A LOT, despite the fact that the Fake News is pulling out all stops for their Radical Left San Francisco Liberal, Kamala Harris. In 2016, we did well, and WON. In 2020, we got Millions of more Votes and actually did much better than 2016, but nothing compares to this year, 2024. The Enthusiasm is GREAT, and the Management Team, headed up by Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, is THE BEST. Many people want to join the Campaign for the final push, some from the first two Campaigns – And we want as many as we can get! I am pleased to announce that Corey Lewandowski, who was very involved in 2016, will be coming on board as a Senior Advisor. Others, likewise, are joining us. They’ll be announced soon! Again, these 82 days will go down as the Most Important in Campaign History, and November 5th will be the Most Important Day in the History of our Country. We are a Nation in Decline, but we will soon be a Great Nation again!

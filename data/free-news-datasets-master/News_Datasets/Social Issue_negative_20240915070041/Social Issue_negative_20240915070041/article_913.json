    "text": "WORCESTER, Mass. - Dr. Michael Hirsh says COVID-19 isn't going away anytime soon. In fact, as the virus continues to mutate, Hirsh says it looks to be a permanent fixture like the flu.\n\"Their mission is to spread widely, but not necessarily make us so sick,\" Hirsh said.\nOne such variant is leaving patients with itchy eyes and throats, similar to the symptoms of allergies.\n\"This is a very clever mutation because so many people will write it off and they'll just go on with their lives, going on airplanes, going into stadiums,\" said Hirsh.\nWhat You Need To Know UMass Memorial Health says the number of COVID cases are three times what they were in June\nInfectious disease expert Dr. Richard Ellison says it appears the peak of cases is behind us, having topped out at the start of August\nWorcester's medical director, Dr. Michael Hirsh, says one variant has given patients similar symptoms to allergies, like itchy eyes and scratchy throat\nBoth Hirsh and Ellison recommend vaccination heading into the fall and winter seasons At UMass Memorial Medical Center, they're feeling the impact of that clever mutation. Infectious disease expert Dr. Richard Ellison says COVID-19 numbers are now three times what they were in June. He says most patients now are experiencing very mild symptoms, but the concern now is what it could mean for healthcare workers.\n\"If we have five or six or seven people in the radiation therapy department or in our stroke unit where we also have very specialized staff, suddenly having those people out of the hospital for four or five days really impacts the hospital's services,\" Ellison said.\nEarlier this month, the hospital asked all staff to start wearing masks again.\nEllison and Hirsh believe the worst has passed, saying cases peaked at the start of August and are on the downswing. Both would emphasize vaccination in the fight against severe illness. But it's something which hasn't gone over well locally.\n\"The vaccine that was offered back last September only had about 18% to 20% compliance,\" Hirsh said.\nAhead of the fall and winter seasons, times of year COVID-19 has its more severe surges, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending the updated COVID-19 and flu shots for everyone ages six months or older.\n\"This recommendation was based on extensive data and clinical trials,\" said CDC Director Mandy Cohen while speaking on the vaccine. \"As a doctor, a mom, a wife, a daughter, and head of the CDC, I would not recommend anything to others that I would not recommend for my own family.\"\nTo avoid further spread, Hirsh says to follow the same steps you were during the pandemic.\n\"It sounds like a broken record. But, yes, I think hand washing is very important,\" Hirsh said. \"I think staying home if you're sick, either from work or from school [is] very important.\"",

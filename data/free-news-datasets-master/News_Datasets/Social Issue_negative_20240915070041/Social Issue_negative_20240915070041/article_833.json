    "text": "[Zoë Kravitz](https://thenerdstash.com/tag/zoe-kravitz/) is the daughter of two celebrities; Lisa Bonnet and [Lenny Kravitz](https://thenerdstash.com/tag/lenny-kravitz/). She is close to both of her parents, who have a fantastic co-parenting relationship despite splitting in 1991 when she was just a toddler. Zoë initially lived with her mother in Miami, Florida, while her father became a superstar. She continued to see him, but she did not live with him. But that changed when she was a preteen. Zoë recently reflected on her decision as an 11-year-old in an interview with [Esquire](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a61792787/zoe-kravitz-blink-twice-interview-2024/). She told the publication how she chose to move from Miami, where she described her life as “really quiet, really simple life,” to live with her father in New York. She described the contrast of their lifestyles, noting how her father’s lifestyle was “this whirlwind of a completely different universe.” But living with her dad was not as idyllic as she initially thought. “Just like it happens in the movies,” she said, “it’s like, ‘Oh, you think this is perfect? You think this is great? Guess what comes with this.’” Zoë Kravitz reflects on how her decision was hurtful to her mother Choosing to leave Lisa Bonnet’s home to live with her rockstar dad is a choice that Zoë Kravitz made that she felt was best for her at the time, but she seemingly has some guilt over it. “I think it was very hurtful that I moved away from her to be with my dad, and my dad wasn’t even there,” she said. That doesn’t mean she regretted moving in with her dad, but at the time, she did not fully understand what her mother was trying to achieve with her quieter lifestyle and strict rules. She continued, “I just wish I had been able to appreciate what she was doing for me. She was so focused on preserving my innocence. My creativity. Because she knew what the world is — that you don’t get that back.” As an adult, Zoë Kravitz remains close with both of her parents, and their co-parenting relationship remains a stunning example of how former couples can create a positive living environment for their children.",

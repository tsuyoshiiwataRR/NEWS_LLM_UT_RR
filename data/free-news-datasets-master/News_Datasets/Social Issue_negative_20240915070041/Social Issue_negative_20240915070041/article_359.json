    "text": "CALGARY - The Calgary Humane Society says it’s investigating a string of gruesome animal abuse cases involving kittens. The probe comes after officials found a dead kitten zip-tied to a fence earlier this week. The group says the cat had suffered serious blunt-force trauma, either before it was tied to the fence or after. Other cases that date back to late May involve cats found alive but covered in tar, with their paws bound in tape. The society doesn’t know for certain if all the abuse cases are connected but says the age of the kittens and how they were found are consistent. The Alberta Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals says thousands of calls come in each year from people concerned they have witnessed animal cruelty. “This is a concern beyond animal welfare and beyond animal lovers,” Brad Nichols, director of enforcement for the Calgary Humane Society, said in an interview Thursday. “There’s a link between animal cruelty and interpersonal violence.” Nichols said cases like this can sometimes be a starting point for human abuse. Since May, crews have responded to reports about seven abused cats, but that such cases tend to be “relatively rare,” he said. “The vast majority of the files, we’re dealing with people that are either under-resourced on finances or undereducated on how to take care of animals.” Nichols said the society takes part in roughly 1,200 investigations each year. A lot of cases also stem from people not being able to take care of their so-called pandemic pets and abandoning them because shelters can’t take them in, Nichols said. Many animal shelters are simply too full, he added. There’s also an overall uptick in reported physical abuse, which Nichols said could stem from more societal awareness. “I can’t say for sure, but I know that we’re dealing with more of these types of files,” he said. The humane society is looking for any tips about this string of abuse cases and all information can be directed to the society or Calgary police. Nichols said animal abuse is considered a criminal offence, and abusers can face up to five years in jail along with a $10,000 fine. If the Animal Protection Act came into play, they could also face a $20,000 fine and a lifetime ban from owning or caring for animals.

    "text": "CHICAGO, Aug. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CHICAGO, August 15, 2024 — Total U.S. retail sales across the combined view of discretionary general merchandise and consumer packaged goods (CPG) continued on the path toward a state of equilibrium in July. During the four weeks ending August 3, 2024, overall sales revenue remained level with the same four weeks last year, and unit demand declined 1%. While both food and beverage and non-edible CPG sales revenue increased 1%, with generally flat year-over-year unit performance, discretionary sales remained challenged, with a 3% decline in dollars and a 2% decline in units. Despite major retail promotional events, consumers maintained their steady spending of the past several months, according to Circana ™, a leading advisor on the complexity of consumer behavior. “This month’s sales results demonstrate just how adept consumers have gotten at adapting their spending behavior to stick to a budget, including taking a break in some areas,” said Marshal Cohen, chief retail industry advisor for Circana . “This apparent vacation from spending is having an impact across discretionary categories. The long-standing strong performance in beauty and the auto aftermarket is starting to level off; back-to-school shopping has yet to show up in a significant way, and challenging results for apparel, footwear and accessories demonstrate that consumers are holding off on updating their wardrobes.”",

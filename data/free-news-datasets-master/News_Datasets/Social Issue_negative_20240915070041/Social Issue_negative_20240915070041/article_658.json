As soon as she got off the call I demanded to know who the hell was speaking to my child in this way.\n[…]\nCommentators like du Plessis-Allan don’t give a crap about climate change. They don’t care that Arctic ice is melting at four times the expected rate, or that we are seeing more and more extreme weather events killing and displacing people across the globe. No, as du Plessis-Allan is\n[fond of reminding us], it’s the economy that matters, not our planet. These sorts of commentators use ad hominem arguments and “gotcha” moments for point-scoring and discrediting their opponents. We saw it when [Mike Hosking opined]that Greta Thunberg is “the world’s most annoying kid” and when [Duncan Garner said]she was “too dramatic” to take seriously. It’s a common tactic used to deflect from the climate crisis, instead of focusing on the actions that we need to take in a rational, reflective manner. They seem particularly keen to go after our youth, whose future is most at stake.\n“They seem particularly keen to go after our youth, whose future is most at stake.” This line in particular stuck out at me as the particularly telling part of Rose Cook’s diatribe. Like others on the far left, she expects teenage activists including her daughter to be able to go out and “be independent” and express their opinions, and in some cases be turned into international icons as Thunberg has, but don’t you dare question them because if you do then you’re a bully or something for “picking on a child” or whatever.\nWe saw this same warped mentality after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\nmass shooting tragedyin 2018. Some of the teens from the school immediately went the activist route with the help of anti-gun organizations that were on standby, and yet when those same students were questioned on their statements, pro-Second Amendment conservatives were blasted as insensitive, hateful bullies who didn’t care how many children were murdered as long as they could keep their guns. An entire segment on CNN, which aired one weekafter the mass shooting, was devoted toperpetuating that very stereotype.",

    "text": "HANAHAN, S.C. (WCSC) - Berkeley County students returned to the classroom Thursday, but some parents said not all of them got there on time. Pick-up for Hanahan Middle School was set for 7:30 a.m. in the Tanner Plantation community, according to parents, but it wasn’t until 9 a.m. that a bus showed up. The bus that arrived, though, wasn’t even the right bus, as parents who did not want to be identified said it was the bus meant to pick up high school students. Parents asked the driver if he could take the middle schoolers as well and after he radioed for permission, they were on their way. Neighbors said they understand hiccups happen but what happened on Thursday is a huge safety concern. Calls for communication to be improved are now aimed at the school district. The Berkeley County School District provided the following statement: Berkeley County bus drivers transport 28,000 students to school and back home safely each day. Our first drivers report to work as early as 4:30 a.m. and our last drivers conclude their days between 6:30p-7:00 p.m. In the first few days of school, students are learning bus expectations, drivers are learning about their students, and routes are being adjusted daily for traffic. Our transportation department has received minimal reports of a student not connecting with their bus, the reasons for this can vary from: - Brand new drivers learning bus routes and navigating areas with increased traffic - Due to the severe weather and flooding largely impacting Berkeley County, drivers were unable to train on newly assigned routes - Incomplete (or inaccurate) new student and returning student information - General delays resulting from increased first day of school traffic We appreciate our parents and community who support our bus drivers and have encouraged them as they navigate transportation within one of the fastest-growing counties in the state and nation. Delays will be experienced in the first few days or weeks of school; however, our commitment is to ensure that all of our bus riders are transported to school and home safely. Parents are hoping for a smoother morning on Friday. Copyright 2024 WCSC. All rights reserved.",

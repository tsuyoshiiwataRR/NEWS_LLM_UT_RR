    "text": "By Lori Kersey ,\n7 days ago The West Virginia NAACP filed a lawsuit Thursday against the state Department of Homeland Security, Department of Human Services and the Department of Education, alleging they failed to collect data meant to improve the juvenile justice system. (Getty Images)\nThe state NAACP filed a lawsuit this week against three West Virginia departments, alleging they failed to collect data meant to improve the juvenile justice system.\nThe organization filed the lawsuit Thursday in Kanawha County Circuit Court. The complaint lists as defendants the state Department of Homeland Security, Department of Human Services and the Department of Education.\n“The West Virginia State Conference of the NAACP has long advocated for the state to address racial inequities in how young people of color are being treated in schools and carceral settings, including racial bullying, school suspension and truancy concerns in West Virginia,” Loretta Young, president of the West Virginia State Conference of the NAACP, said in a news release Thursday.\n“This data is an important tool in that work and by not collecting it, the state is hindering the NAACP from fulfilling its mission,” she said. “West Virginians deserve to have a government that fulfills its obligations — to know that when the state legislature passes a law near-unanimously and the governor signs it, the state agencies follow that law, just the same as ordinary West Virginians do.”\nAccording to a report from the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, in 2013, West Virginia confined youth at a rate of 510 per 100,000, and Black kids were nearly three times more likely to be confined than white kids.\nBetween 2006 and 2011, the lawsuit states, West Virginia’s rate of youth incarceration increased 5%, despite a national drop of 35%.\nFormer Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin signed Senate Bill 393 into law in 2015. The legislation had unanimous support from both chambers of the Legislature. It followed the work of a task force made up of lawmakers , law enforcement, judges, public defenders, teachers and others that Tomblin convened to work on juvenile justice reform. The panel found, among other things, that the state lacked information about youth recidivism rates.\nThe legislation required the state to collect data on recidivism, the outcomes of diversion programs, the outcomes of truancy programs and the proportion of minority youth who are involved in the juvenile justice system compared to those in the general population involved in the system.\nAccording to a report last year from the state Department of Education, about one in five Black students in West Virginia public schools were suspended during the 2021-2022 school year.\nYoung said the high rate of suspensions for students of color indicates that they’re being targeted. About 3.6 percent of West Virginia’s population is Black, according to 2020 Census data.\nYoung said that many children of color who are suspended are being punished for responding to the use of racial slurs or other discriminatory behavior used against them. All children, she continued, should have a safe place in school and access to equal education. When children are suspended and not in school, they don’t learn, she said.\n“My ultimate goal is that we would look at policies that would help administrators and teachers not to turn a blind eye to the use of racial slurs and name calling, but see that as a very serious offense and that they would develop policies and training for teachers so that this might be curbed,” Young said.\nAleshadye Getachew, an attorney with the Democracy Forward Foundation, which is representing the NAACP in the lawsuit, said the organizations previously filed broad Freedom of Information Act requests relating to all the data that the agencies named in the suit were required by law to collect. Some of the agencies had collected some of the data, she said, but none had developed procedures to make the data accessible and usable.\n“I cannot say enough about how important the data is, because the data could also show us what actions brought about better results,” Young said. “And we all need to learn. Data that is king in order for us to make policy changes.”\nThe complaint seeks to require the state agencies to comply with the law by collecting the data.\nThe NAACP is also being represented in the lawsuit by Mountain State Justice.\nRepresentatives of the three state agencies did not immediately return an email seeking comment Thursday.\nThis story has been updated with further comment from Loretta Young, president of the West Virginia State Conference of the NAACP, and Aleshadye Getachew, an attorney with the Democracy Forward Foundation.\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

Vance, who attacked what he called the Green New Scam at the Republican convention, are determined to fossil-fuelize our future in a fashion never before seen. And unfortunately, Donald Trump is anything but alone. (Do you hear me, Vladimir Putin?) In fact, according to a recent Guardian report, almost one-quarter of this countrys congressional representatives (100 members of the House and 23 senators) deny the very existence of climate change and be shocked, very shocked, but every last one of them is a Republican! Project 2025 is a Heritage Foundation greenhouse-gas nightmare of a document prepared for the possible second term of the president who called climate change a great hoax and once said sarcastically, The oceans are going to rise 1/100th of an inch in the next 300 years and its going to kill everybody, while insisting that windmills cause cancer and that electric cars are bad for the environment. After all, despite the fact that so many of Project 2025s creators at that notorious rightwing climate-denying think tank were former Trumpian officials and J.D. Vance is closely tied to it, the former president has claimed it has absolutely nothing to do with him. The plans that he and J.D. Vance have when it comes to fossil fuels should make anyones hair stand on end (even someone as bald as me). After all, hes already promised that, above all else, when he next enters the Oval Office, his main goal will be to drill, baby, drill. You cant be more blunt than that when it comes to encouraging the fossil-fuel companies from whom you recently demanded a fortune in election funding. And thats obviously just the beginning. He and his crew have promised to wipe out anything the Biden administration did aimed at dealing with climate change and fossil fuels while nixing any steps taken to support the creation of clean energy. Instead, he would develop the liquid gold that is right under our feet and unleash domestic energy production like never before. From obliterating wind power projects (I hate wind) to promoting oil and natural gas drilling from the Gulf of Mexico to the Alaskan Arctic, theres no end to what he and his cronies have in mind. He and his team may even be ready to systematically dismantle, if not obliterate the Environmental Protection Agency (which, in case youve forgotten, was created in 1970 by a Republican president, Richard Nixon, who did little else right). Donald Trumps next presidency, in other words, will clearly force the U.S. government to literally worship at the foot (or the oil rig) of the fossil-fuel companies. The startling thing is that, on this distinctly overheating planet of ours, a person whose platform is essentially an oil or natural gas-drilling rig should have the faintest chance of being elected president. Its not all that complicated really. Leaving aside any other issue, voting for Donald Trump in our already rapidly warming world would be all too literally a suicidal act. So, consider a vote for Donald Trump a vote for nothing less than destroying the Earth as a livable environment for well, all of those to come. And given the apocalyptic nature of that, dont you find it strange that Trumps climate-change views and his ultimate support for the fossil fuel industry above all else (except himself) havent gotten more attention in this election season?

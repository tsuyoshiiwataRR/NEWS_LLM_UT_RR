    "text": "[Kanye West](https://hiphopdx.com/artist/kanye-west) gave his former Yeezy chief of staff [Milo Yiannopoulos](https://hiphopdx.com/news/kanye-west-2024-presidential-campaign) an actual “N-word pass,” according to the controversial far-right figure. Yiannopoulos took to X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday (August 14) to share photos of the physical card that Yeezy purportedly gave him that allows him to freely use the racial slur without repercussions, despite him being white. AD LOADING... The front of the pass features a photo of Milo underneath the words: “N-word Pass” and “Lifetime Membership.” On the back is a screenshot of a text conversation between the Chicago rapper and his former employee which outlines the X-rated reason behind his freedom to use the N-word. AD LOADING... “I only let people say n-gger that have sucked n-gger cock,” Kanye wrote in the messages, seemingly referencing [Milo’s past homosexuality](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/milo-yiannopoulos-ex-gay-b1815296.html). Yiannopoulos replied: “Can confirm” with two crying laughing face emojis. Revealing that the card was given to him by Ye, Milo captioned the post: “crazy[.] thanks ye.” crazy thanks ye [pic.twitter.com/vqFljgqY8j] — Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) [August 15, 2024] [Milo Yiannopoulos departed Kanye West’s Yeezy company in May](https://hiphopdx.com/news/kanye-west-milo-yiannopoulos-yeezy-porn), saying in a statement: “I wish Ye every success in the future. I have some concerns about his new team, and hope he proceeds with caution.” The political commentator, who began serving as his chief of staff in 2022, had [expressed opposition to Ye’s reported adult film venture Yeezy Porn](https://hiphopdx.com/news/kanye-west-yeezy-porn-milo-iannopoulos-gay) (which has yet to materialize). AD LOADING... “I cannot be complicit in the production or dissemination of pornographic films and literature, for moral and religious reasons,” he wrote in a letter shared online. “But also, because such material and the kind of people invariably involved in its production represent an imminent danger to my life as a recovering addict and an unacceptable risk to my spiritual and physical health as a former homosexual.” Since his exit, Yiannopoulos has made explosive allegations about Kanye’s private life and inner circle, [claiming that the rap mogul is battling a dangerous nitrous oxide addiction](https://hiphopdx.com/news/kanye-west-nitrous-gas-addiction-brain-damage-dentist-milo-yiannopoulos) and that his dentist is to blame. In a [sworn affidavit](https://ludovicus.wpengine.com/files/pdf/cdbcompaffidavit.pdf) filed against celebrity dentist Thomas Connelly to the California Dental Board, Milo accused Connelly of charging West more than $50,000 per month for the illegal supply of the gas, which is typically used to reduce a patient’s pain and anxiety during dental procedures. AD LOADING... Yiannopoulos claimed that Kanye has since become hooked on the stuff and his health is suffering, with the rapper exhibiting “distressing symptomps” and becoming “incomprehensible and contradictory” in his communication. [Connelly has vehemently denied the allegations](https://hiphopdx.com/news/kanye-west-nitrous-gas-proof-leaked-texts), accusing Yiannopoulos of trying “damage” his reputation due to a personal grievance.",

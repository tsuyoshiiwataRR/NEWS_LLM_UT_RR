    "text": "Former President Donald Trump was mocked online for comments he made during a meandering press conference, claiming that ‚Äúsubstantially more‚Äù than 100 percent of job creation went to migrants, a mathematical impossibility.\nTrump spoke from his residence in Bedminster, New Jersey Thursday afternoon ‚Äî a follow-up to last week‚Äôs similar event at Mar-a-Lago that drew harsh fact-checks finding triple-digit quantities of lies, misrepresentations, and distortions.\nVice President Kamala Harris‚Äôs campaign mocked Trump in advance of the presser, and social media users joined in as Trump‚Äôs remarks rolled on.\nOne comment that especially drew attention was his comment attacking President Joe Biden ‚Äî and Harris as part of the administration ‚Äî on the economy, attempting to downplay positive news about job creation.\n‚ÄúVirtually 100% of the net job creation in the last year has gotten to migrants,‚Äù said Trump, ‚ÄúYou know that? Most of the job creation has gone to migrants. In fact, I‚Äôve heard that substantially more than ‚Äî uh, beyond, actually beyond the number of 100%, it‚Äôs a much higher number than that, but the government hasn‚Äôt caught up with that yet, but virtually right now as of the time they did this virtually 100% of the net job creation in the last year has gone to migrants.‚Äù\nHe went on with a rant about Social Security, saying it would ‚Äúblow up and fail,‚Äù ‚Äúwill be a blow up like you‚Äôve never seen before,‚Äù if Harris is elected.\nBesides the fact that is objectively not accurate that ‚Äúvirtually 100%‚Äù of jobs went to migrants, it is not mathematically possible for more than 100% of the total jobs created to go to any category of people. Jobs can increase at a rate higher than 100% ‚Äî anything that doubles in number, for example, is increasing by 200% ‚Äî but the amount of new jobs is a finite number and more than actually exist cannot be taken by either migrants or Americans or anyone.\n(On a related note, this is why motivational posters and sports team coaches urging you to ‚Äúgive 110%!‚Äù are full of crap and bad at math.)\nPeople on The Platform Formerly Known as Twitter seemed to have a better grasp on basic mathematics than the forty-fifth president, and delivered the expected mocking. Below, a few examples.\nOMG. OMG.\nBesides that this is INSANELY DELUSIONAL, maybe having 2nd grade level math knowledge could help him out? https://t.co/5JmpGJiQNv\n‚Äî Spiro‚Äôs Ghost (@AntiToxicPeople) August 15, 2024\nThere are lies and there‚Äôs pure insanity.\nLie: 100% of new jobs have gone to migrants.\nPure insanity: The number is actually higher than 100%.\nSay what? https://t.co/8YRXvO8NvG\n‚Äî Bryan Behar (@bryanbehar) August 15, 2024\nPercentages: How Do They Work?\n‚Äî Rachel Vindman üá∫üá∏ü¶Öüåª (@natsechobbyist) August 15, 2024\nBy next week , he will be claiming that 150% is actually 100% and all mathematicians went wrong.\n‚Äî zorluhan (@zorluhanzorlu) August 15, 2024\nHe‚Äôs literally reading a piece of paper written for him and somehow he still finds a way to say something totally crazy and stupid like this. Absolutely unreal how someone let this stat be put on a piece of paper.\n‚Äî Isiah Sanders (@MrZaySanders) August 15, 2024\nUm. There is nothing higher than 100 percent\n‚Äî Rose Benson (@NotoriousRBF) August 15, 2024\n‚ÄúMore than 100%?‚Äù No wonder this guy & Project 2025 want to destroy public education. https://t.co/gP2dEsQ5nA\n‚Äî Harris | Walz War Room (Text JOIN to 30330) (@HarrisWarRoom) August 15, 2024\nDear @JaredEMoskowitz\nA guy who knows a guy who knows a guy heard from his sister‚Äôs brother‚Äôs girlfriend‚Äôs cousin that migrants have taken 500% of all new jobs.\nI request a congressional inquiry. https://t.co/NYRfJY9tpN\n‚Äî Bradley P. Moss (@BradMossEsq) August 15, 2024\nClaiming that \"over 100%\" of job creation has gone to migrants is next-level ridiculous.\nTrump has shown he doesn't understand:\n-wind turbines\n-magnets\n-hurricanes\n-boats\n-batteries\n-energy storage\n-and now percentages\n‚Äî Jared Ryan Sears (@JaredRyanSears) August 15, 2024\n2+2 = 5\nSeriously this is the sign of somebody who is not right mentally\nI do think it‚Äôs a legitimate question why the press covered Biden‚Äòs actually less severe symptoms so intensively & gives Trump differential treatment https://t.co/WjHS481VZ0\n‚Äî Norm Eisen (#TryingTrump out now!) (@NormEisen) August 15, 2024\n‚ÄúBeyond 100%. A much higher number than that‚Äù-DJT\nWhich number is more bigly than 100%?\n‚Äî Semper Leger (@SemperLeger) August 15, 2024\nWatch the clip above via CNN .\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com",

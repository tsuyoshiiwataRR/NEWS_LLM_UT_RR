    "text": "NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Thursday doubled down on India's efforts to ensure the safety and security of the Hindu community in Bangladesh, emphasising in his Independence Day address 140 crore countrymen were worried about them and other minorities in the neighbouring country, and expressed hope the situation there would normalise soon.Amid unending concerns over violence against Bangladesh's largest minority community, which has had to bear the brunt of anti-Sheikh Hasina sentiment in the country, Modi said \\\"As a neighbouring country, I can understand the concern regarding whatever has happened in Bangladesh. I hope the situation there gets normal at the earliest. The concerns of 140 crore countrymen to ensure the safety of Hindus and minorities there -India always wants our neighbouring countries to walk the path of prosperity and peace,\\\" said Modi.This was the second time Modi has raised the issue of their safety. In his congratulatory message to Muhammad Yunus earlier, the leader of the interim govt in Dhaka, Modi had called for ensuring the protection of Hindus and other minorities, while expressing commitment to work with the new govt.On India's Independence Day, the PM also reached out to the interim govt, as he backed Bangladesh's path to development while underlining India's commitment to the welfare of humankind.\\\"In days to come, we will continue to wish well for Bangladesh in its 'Vikas Yatra' because we think about the welfare of humankind,\\\" he said.PM's latest comment follow concerns expressed by Hindu groups and organisations in which they said this week that Hindus faced faced attacks and threats in 278 locations across 48 districts since the fall of the Hasina-led govt on August 5. They called the attacks an \\\"assault on the Hindu religion.\\\" India has also formed a committee to work with authorities in Dhaka to ensure the safety and security of Indian nationals, Hindus, and other minority communities.Hindus have continued to complain about a persistent threat of violence, even as the interim govt and military start to restore law and order and parties like Jamaat-e-Islami condemn atrocities against the minorities.To address these concerns, Yunus visited Dhaka's landmark Dhakeshwari temple this week and interacted with the Hindus, asking them to exercise patience and to not rush to judge his govt. \\\"Rights are equal for everyone. We are all one people with one right. Do not make any distinctions among us. Please, assist us. Exercise patience, and later judge - what we were able to do and not. If we fail, then criticise us,\\\" he said.",

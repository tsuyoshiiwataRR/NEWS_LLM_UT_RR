(Atlanta News First) - Police said a suspect has been arrested in the deadly shooting of a man at a DeKalb County apartment complex last month. On July 7, DeKalb County police said they responded to a person shot in the Woodcrest Village apartment complex on the 2300 block of Woodcrest Walk around 6:45 a.m. Police said a 25-year-old man was found dead “from multiple gunshot wounds inside a residence” at the complex. RELATED: [Man fatally shot at DeKalb County apartment complex, police say](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2024/07/07/man-fatally-shot-dekalb-county-apartment-complex-police-say/) On Thursday, DeKalb police said they’d arrested the victim’s roommate in the shooting. They said the suspect shot the victim in their apartment after an argument and left the scene. The suspect was arrested Wednesday and booked into the DeKalb County Jail. Police have not identified the victim, the suspect or the charges the suspect is facing. In November, officials said a person was injured in a shooting near the same complex.

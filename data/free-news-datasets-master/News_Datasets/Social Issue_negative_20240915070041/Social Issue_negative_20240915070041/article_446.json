For the misdemeanor, he was sentenced to five days in jail but had jail credit of five days so that has already been satisfied.\nIn exchange for his plea, prosecutors dismissed two other charges of third-degree criminal sexual conduct against Corbeau.\nRelated Articles Crime and Public Safety | Life-saving crews dispatched late to Oxford school shooting, fire chiefs say Crime and Public Safety | Sheriff’s office quashed review of emergency response to Oxford school shooting Crime and Public Safety | State officials say pool of crime victims, compensation received have risen Crime and Public Safety | Authorities: Dispatchers hear man tell girlfriend ‘game over’ before he fatally shot her Crime and Public Safety | Commerce Township man set for court after March explosion in Clinton Township The Oakland Press typically doesn’t name alleged victims of criminal sexual assault, or minors purported to be victims or perpetrators of crimes.\nCorbeau spent a few days in the Oakland County Jail after he was arrested on Jan. 16.

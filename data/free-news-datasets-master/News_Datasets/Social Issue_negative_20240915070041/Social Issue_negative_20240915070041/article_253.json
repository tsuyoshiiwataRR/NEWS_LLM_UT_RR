    "text": "ST. CLOUD, Minn. â€” A Waite Park man was sentenced Thursday to more than six years for an attempted 2021 St. Cloud bank robbery in which he took multiple hostages.\nRay McNeary, 39, took five hostages at a Wells Fargo bank on May 6, 2021. The criminal complaint said he was speaking to a bank manager about potential fraud on his account, and became upset when the manager couldn't find his account.\nThe manager hit the silent panic alarm and several customers fled the building, but five employees remained inside. McNeary then demanded $60,000 in cash from the vault.\nThe complaint went on to say that McNeary allegedly told the hostages that he was going to harm them and he wanted a \"big show\" with the FBI and media and that he would take the victims \"with him.\"\nMcNeary held a pair of scissors against the bank manager's neck and back, charges said. Four employees were able to leave the bank during the 8-hour standoff , which eventually ended when the bank manager fled and law enforcement were able to move in and arrest McNeary. The bank employees were unharmed.\nHe pleaded guilty to one count of armed bank robbery in March. He was sentenced to six years and six months in prison, five years of supervised release and must pay $8,210 in restitution.\nMore from CBS News Country music singer Creed Fisher seriously hurt in motorcycle crash near St. Cloud Video shows 8-year-old girl using bat to help fight off armed robber at Twin Cities liquor store Kandiyohi County deputy charged with DWI after rolling squad car multiple times 5 juveniles arrested after allegedly speeding through Edina in stolen vehicles Man convicted in killings of 3 men near Wisconsin quarry WCCO Staff The WCCO Staff is a group of experienced journalists who bring you the content on WCCO.com.\nTwitter Facebook Instagram",

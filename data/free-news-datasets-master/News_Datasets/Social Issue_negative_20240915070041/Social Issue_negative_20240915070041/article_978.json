    "text": "Hardship: NBS reveals 3 most affordable states to live in Nigeria The National Bureau of Statistics, NBS, said Benue, Delta, and Borno states are the least expensive states to live in Nigeria. NBS July’s Consumer Price Index and Inflation Data released on Thursday showed that Benue, Delta and Borno recorded the slowest rise in Headline Inflation on a year-on-year basis. Benue’s headline inflation stood at 27.28 percent, Delta, 28.06 percent and Borno 28.33 percent on a year-on-year basis. On a month-on-month basis, Taraba, 0.17 percent, Kwara, 0.62 percent and Ondo 0.91 percent recorded the slowest headline inflation rise. In contrast, Abuja 3.91 percent, Borno, 3.84 percent and Enugu 3.76 percent recorded the highest increases. DAILY POST earlier reported that, according to data released by NBS, Nigeria’s headline inflation fell to 33.90 percent in July, the first time a drop has been recorded since 2022, when it stood at 21.34 percent. Similarly, NBS reported that reduction in the prices of garri, fufu and others pushed food inflation to drop in July to 39.53 percent from 40.87 percent in June.

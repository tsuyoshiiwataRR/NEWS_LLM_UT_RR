    "text": "To President Biden!\n2024-08-16: #In the next debate, Trump should talk about abolishing EV tax incentives\n#China's presence is growing in South America, including Bolivia and Argentina\n#America should have abandoned Ukraine and invested in South America\nAt the next debate, Mr. Trump should talk about abolishing EV preferential treat-ment. Mr. Trump should state that the next generation of automobiles are hydrogen automobiles and HVs are temporary automobiles. The United States will not pro-mote \"EVs\" in order to avoid war.\nChile, which was the first in Latin America to establish diplomatic relations with China, is China's number one trading partner in both exports and imports. I hope that the day will come when the United States will export hydrogen automobiles to \"Chile\".\nLast year, President Boric, who visited China and met with President Xi Jinping, ex-pressed his expectations for China's role in lithium development. The United States should have abandoned Ukraine and invested in South America.\nPresident Boric: \"I highly appreciate that China has shown great interest in invest-ing in our country in strategic projects such as lithium in recent years. Chile and China can become strategic partners in promoting the development of lithium.\"\nEven if Japan wants to enter, it can't enter? The two conditions that the Chilean government requires from partner companies are financial supply capacity and high operational capacity, and experts point out that financial capacity is particularly im-portant.\n60% of lithium interest acquisitions are from China! China's presence is also grow-ing in South America, including Bolivia and Argentina. The United States staged a \"coup\" in Bolivia, but it failed.\nIn Bolivia, in 2023, two Chinese companies, including China's major battery manu-facturer \"CATL,\" signed an agreement with the Bolivian government to produce lith-ium in the \"Uyuni Salt Flats,\" which are rich in lithium, ahead of Japan, Europe, and the United States.\nIn Argentina, China's largest lithium development company, \"Ganfeng Lithium,\" has five lithium development projects with a total production capacity of more than 100,000 tons per year.\nIn 2022, the Biden administration enacted the IRA Inflation Control Act. Although the name is inflation control, it is said that the actual aim is to exclude China from the supply chain of important minerals in North America.\nIn March 2024, Mitsubishi Corporation announced that it would invest in a joint ven-ture with a Canadian mining development company to participate in the develop-ment of a lithium mine in Ontario, Canada.\nThe mine is expected to begin production around 2027, and annual lithium produc-tion is expected to be 20,000 tons, equivalent to the amount needed for batteries for approximately 300,000 EVs, so research is underway to commercialize the pro-ject.\nThe United States should withdraw from \"EVs\" and focus on developing \"hydrogen vehicles.\" Lithium secured in Canada and other countries should be used to make batteries for \"home appliances\" such as \"smartphones.\"\nNext-generation vehicles should be promoted as \"HVs\" as a \"temporary\" project, and \"hydrogen (internal combustion) vehicles\" in earnest. America should take ad-vantage of its strength in the \"internal combustion engine.\"\nIt would cost a huge amount to set up charging stations on the vast lands of Africa and South America. Global strategic vehicles only require hydrogen cartridge re-placement at G/s, so existing \"infrastructure\" can be utilized.\nHydrogen vehicles use the power of robots to replace hydrogen cartridges at G/s. Refueling takes less than 10 minutes. Of course, EV manufacturers should secure batteries and develop charging facilities.\nPart 1 Citations/References\nWill we one day be unable to make batteries? The global battle for battery metals\nWill we one day be unable to make batteries? The global battle for battery metals\nhttps://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20240712/k10014510011000.html\nI will write again tomorrow.\nPart 2. Japan is a \"state of abnormal human rights violations\". \"Everyone\" of the \"international community\", please help!\nFirst of all, please read \"false accusation\" in the 2010 \"Crime of Supporting Violation of Immigration Law\".\nReason for punishment:\nA Chinese national obtained a \"residence status\" by submitting a \"false employment contract.\" And they committed immigration law violations (activities outside of their qualifications).\nBecause \"we\" provided \"false employment contract documents\" to the Chinese, the Chinese were able to obtain \"residence status.\"\nThe Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan because they obtained a \"status of residence\".\nBecause the Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan, they were able to \"work illegally.\"\nTherefore, ``we'' who ``provided'' the Chinese with ``false employment contract documents'' were punished as ``helping'' the Chinese ``activities outside the scope of their status of residence''.\nThis is an arbitrary \"error of applicable law\". This is out of the \"logic of the law\".\nA Chinese national obtained a \"residence status\" by submitting a \"false employment contract.\" And they committed immigration law violations (activities outside of their qualifications).\nBecause \"we\" provided \"false employment contract documents\" to the Chinese, the Chinese were able to obtain \"residence status.\"\nThe Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan because they obtained a \"status of residence\".\nBecause the Chinese were able to \"live\" in Japan, they were able to \"work illegally.\"\nTherefore, ``we'' who ``provided'' the Chinese with ``false employment contract documents'' were punished as ``helping'' the Chinese ``activities outside the scope of their status of residence''.\nThis is an arbitrary \"error of applicable law\". This is out of the \"logic of the law\".\nMy claim:\n\"1\" The Immigration Control Act stipulates that the Minister of Justice will take an \"administrative disposition\" (Immigration Control Act: Cancellation of the status of residence) for the act of submitting false documents and obtaining a status of residence. You are now \"finished\". \"Aiding\" an act of innocence is innocence.\nA Chinese national who has engaged in “2” (activities outside the qualification) is not guilty. The reason is that the \"person who hired them\" has not been punished for \"promoting illegal employment\" under the Immigration Control Act. Therefore, by \"equality under the law\", the Chinese are innocent.\n\"1\" The Immigration Control Act stipulates that the Minister of Justice will take an \"administrative disposition\" (Immigration Control Act: Cancellation of the status of residence) for the act of submitting false documents and obtaining a status of residence.

The reason is that the \"person who hired them\" has not been punished for \"promoting illegal employment\" under the Immigration Control Act. Therefore, by \"equality under the law\", the Chinese are innocent.\nThe revision of the Immigration Control Law in December 2016 made it possible to punish the act of \"providing\" \"false employment contract documents\".\nImplemented from January 2017. According to Article 39 of the Constitution, it is not possible to \"retroactively\" to the \"past\" and \"punish\".\nImplemented from January 2017. According to Article 39 of the Constitution, it is not possible to \"retroactively\" to the \"past\" and \"punish\".\nhttps://www.moj.go.jp/isa/laws/h28_kaisei.html\nSee \"Indictment.\" The stated facts \"state\" the \"fact\" of \"not guilty.\" (Japanese English)\n\"My Appeal\" (Japanese)\n\"My Appeal\" (English)\nhttp://www.miraico.jp/ICC-crime/2Related%20Documents/%EF%BC%91Indictment.pdf\n\"My Appeal\" (Japanese)\nhttps://blog.goo.ne.jp/nipponnoasa/e/d28c05d97af7a48394921a2dc1ae8f98\n\"My Appeal\" (English)\nhttps://blog.goo.ne.jp/nipponnoasa/e/ac718e4f2aab09297bdab896a94bd194\n\"Chinese, Korean, Filipino, American, etc.\" There are more than tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of victims all over the world. An unusual number of people.\nProsecutors' \"(deprivation) of liberty\" is \"arbitrary.\" They are \"disobeying the law\" and \"selfish\". They have no \"(logical) (necessity)\". The prosecution is \"punishing\" \"as they wish\".\nIn 2010, \"me and the Chinese\" in the immigration violation case, and in 2013, Philippine Embassy staff and diplomats were also punished for the same reason.\n\"I\" argued \"not guilty\", explaining with \"logic of the law\".\nPolice and prosecutors then said, \"(You) should admit (your crime) in general terms.\"\nJapan is the only country that punishes in general terms! .\nThe judge stated \"Causal relationship\" with crazy \"logic\". When I \"see\" (text of the judgment), I \"laugh out loud.\"\nPolice and prosecutors then said, \"(You) should admit (your crime) in general terms.\"\nJapan is the only country that punishes in general terms! .\nThe judge stated \"Causal relationship\" with crazy \"logic\". When I \"see\" (text of the judgment), I \"laugh out loud.\"\nThis case is an error of arbitrary application of law by police officers, prosecutors and judges. The charges are \"abuse of authority of a special public official\" and \"crimes of false complaints.\" The prosecution \"killed\" the \"accusation letter\" and \"accusation letter\" by \"ex officio.\" Therefore, the statute of limitations has been suspended.\nI am \"appealing\" two things.\n1: The foreigner performed \"illegal labor\" other than \"status of residence\". But foreigners are innocent because of \"equality under the law\".\n2: The prosecution “applied” “Articles 60 and 62 of the Penal Code” to Article 70 of the Immigration Control Act on the grounds of “support for Article 22-4-4 of the Immigration Act”. However, it is \"error of applicable law\". (as above).\n1: The foreigner performed \"illegal labor\" other than \"status of residence\".

(as above).\nKoreans make demands on Japan over the \"solved\" \"comfort women and forced laborers\" issue, but should support \"tens of thousands of Korean victims\" who have been punished for \"violating immigration laws.\" .\nThe Japanese government is hiding Japan's human rights violations by making up such things as \"human rights violations against Uyghurs in China.\"\n\"I\" am demanding \"restoration of honor\" and \"compensation\" for myself, the Chinese, and the Philippine Embassy officials.\nEveryone in the world! ! Victims should report to their respective governments. The governments of each country have an obligation to demand the Japanese government to restore the honor of their own citizens and compensate them.\nPart 3. Construction of special zones.\nThe \"special zone\" \"accepts\" refugees and immigrants as \"temporary immigrant\" workers, limiting their residence to the \"special zone\". Developed countries can use them as low-wage workers for economic growth, and refugees and immigrants can get jobs and live a hopeful human life.\nNo2:\nhttps://world-special-zone.seesaa.net/\nNo1:\nhttps://naganoopinion.blog.jp/\nPart 4.

It all started about 11 p.m. on Sunday as the officer tried to stop a red Jeep Grand Cherokee for a defective vehicle violation in the area of West Dartmouth Avenue and South Shoshone Street.\nAn Englewood police officer's dashcam video captured the moment juvenile suspects shot at him with an AK-47 during a pursuit. Englewood Police According to the police report, the driver refused to stop and within a few minutes, the suspects fired more than a dozen shots at the officer from a \"high-powered weapon\" out of the passenger side window.\nMultiple shots struck the front end, engine and windshield of the patrol vehicle. The shots barely missed the officer.\nThe officer continued to pursue the vehicle as it sped through an industrial area and then into a neighborhood where it crashed. The two suspects ran away from the crash scene. That's when the patrol vehicle was also disabled due to the amount of damage caused by the gunfire into the engine.\nMultiple agencies responded to help the officer and to locate the suspects. They weren't able to find the suspects at that time.\nA bullet hole in the Englewood Police Dept. vehicle's windshield.

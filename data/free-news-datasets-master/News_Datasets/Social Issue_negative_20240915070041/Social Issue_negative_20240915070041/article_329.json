    "text": "By Subrata Nag Choudhary\nKOLKATA, India (Reuters) – The murder and rape of a trainee doctor as she took a rest during a long shift in a Kolkata hospital has highlighted the vulnerability of medics left without proper protections and facilities, her colleagues and friends said on Thursday.\nThe 31-year-old, whose killing has triggered protests across India, had ordered some food with others nearly 20 hours into a 36-hour working day on Friday and then headed off for a short sleep, staff at the R G Kar Medical College told Reuters.\n“She retired to the empty seminar room which was used by on-duty doctors to rest,” one co-worker said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\nAs news of her murder spread, doctors took to the streets alongside women’s groups and Bollywood stars, demanding enhanced safety measures for doctors on duty.\n“Pedestrian working conditions, inhuman workloads and violence in the workplace are the reality,” the Indian Medical Association (IMA), the biggest grouping of doctors in the country, told Health Minister J P Nadda in a letter released on Tuesday.\nThe health ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the letter, not did West Bengal health authorities about working conditions for doctors.\n“The attention of the authorities was drawn time and again to the lack of facilities, but there was no improvement,” a junior doctor at the hospital said, asking not to be named.\nThe case has drawn parallels to the notorious gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in New Delhi in 2012 – a case that was the catalyst for sweeping changes in laws, including fast-track courts for sexual assault cases.\n(Reporting by Subrata Nag Choudhary, writing by Shilpa Jamkhandikar; Editing by Andrew Heavens)",

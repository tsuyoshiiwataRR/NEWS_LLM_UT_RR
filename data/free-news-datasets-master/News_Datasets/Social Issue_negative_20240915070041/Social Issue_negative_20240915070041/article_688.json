    "text": "A Tasmanian senator has taken aim at the state's main tourism promotion agency and regional tourism boards, claiming that failure to adequately promote local businesses, events and destinations is contributing to the industry's stress.\\u003cbr\\u003eSenator Tammy Tyrrell made the comments after seeing Tasmanian Hospitality Association statistics that revealed June occupancy rates for North-West Coast hotels at just 38 per cent.\\u003cbr\\u003eTHA chief executive Steve Old said recently June occupancy rates in the state - 56.75 per cent - were the lowest since 2018 when excluding the COVID period, and were approaching the lowest levels seen in a decade.\\u003cbr\\u003eHe blamed the low numbers on the decision to scale back Tasmania's key winter festival, Dark Mofo, as well as ongoing concerns around cost of living.Senator Tyrrell criticised Tourism Tasmania, claiming the agency failed to sufficiently promote events in regional Tasmania.\\u003cbr\\u003eDuring a recent trip to the West Coast, several businesses told her that while Tourism Tasmania representatives met with them, they provided no effective support, Senator Tyrrell said.\\u003cbr\\u003eA spokesperson for Tourism Tasmania said this year was the state's largest investment in a winter marketing campaign.The spokesperson said the agency's Odd Jobs campaign, which promoted unique Tasmanian unpaid jobs such as 'Wombat Walkers' and 'Wine Whisperers', reached a global audience of more than 1.3 billion.Senator Tyrrell said an example from another area was Latrobe's Chocolate Winterfest, which drew 6000 visitors on Sunday, according to event organisers.\\u003cbr\\u003eLatrobe Mayor Peter Freshney agreed more promotion of events like Chocolate Winterfest was needed.West By Northwest did not respond to a request for comment.\\u003cbr\\u003eTourism Tasmania pointed out that Chocolate Winterfest was featured in The Hobart Magazine, as well as in the agency's e-newsletters, as well as on its website and app.Mayor Freshney also said Tourism Tasmania was too focussed on getting interstate visitors to fly to either Hobart or Launceston airports.According to Tourism Tasmania figures, 63 per cent of visitors fly out of Hobart airport, and 22 per cent fly out of Launceston airport.Senator Tyrrell said high airfares were another negative factor.Senator Tyrrell also took a swipe at the representatives of regional tourism boards such as Visit Northern Tasmania and West By Northwest.",

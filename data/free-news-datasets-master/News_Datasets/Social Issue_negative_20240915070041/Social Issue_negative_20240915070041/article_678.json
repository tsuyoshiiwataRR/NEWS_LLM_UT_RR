    "text": "By Olivia Stevens | | Daily Southtown UPDATED: August 15, 2024 at 4:04 p.m.\nThe FBI is seeking information on an unnamed person suspected of robbing the First Savings Bank of Hegewisch in Lansing Aug. 9, and offering a reward of up to $10,000.\nChicago FBI classified the suspect Wednesday as a 40- to 60-year-old white man dressed in a dark-colored baseball hat, black sunglasses, a light-colored medical face mask, a purple and green plaid button-up short sleeved shirt with a black undershirt, dark-colored cargo pants and dark-colored shoes. He also wore a watch on his right wrist and carried a blue Walmart shopping bag, the release said. (FBI Chicago)\nSpecial Agent Siobhan Johnson said Wednesday security footage captured the person walking slowly across the lobby and sitting down, taking his time before ordering people in the bank to a back room and demanding money. Johnson declined to say how much money the person was given, but said his approach to wait in the lobby before robbing the bank is “unusual.”\n“In most bank robberies that we see, typically fast very hurrying in and out,” Johnson said. The FBI description said the person implied he had a handgun, but the weapon has not been confirmed.\nLansing police and the FBI responded at about 10 a.m. and are actively searching for the man. Johnson said any details from the public, even those given anonymously, can help and potentially earn the reward.\n“Bank robbers don’t just appear and disappear as soon as they go into the bank,” Johnson said. “Someone saw him changing into this clothing or changing out of this clothing at some point. Someone saw him walking through the neighborhood, either getting into a bus or getting into a car, and those are the things we’re really looking for.”\nThe FBI asks anyone with information to report it at 312-421-6700 or tips.fbi.gov .\nostevens@chicagotribune.com August 15, 2024 at 3:22 p.m. Share this:",

    "text": "Democrats have finally learned how to do an insult — with a smile and a shiv, and make sure the insult is about his positions and his policies, not about his race, his waist, his hair. Insult what he says and what he does, not what he is (genetically speaking, that is). Words like “weird” and “creepy” work because they are accurate and because they are delivered in a humorous way, in a more-in-sorrow-than-anger way. Harris and Walz are doing that. Trump can’t. (Seems Vance can’t, either, but that’s a lesser story.) More and more GOP operatives are telling Trump his insults and attacks aren’t working, aren’t going to work, and will cost him the election. Republicans practically beg Trump to change it up. He’s not listening. Former Donald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway offered a recipe this week for Trump’s struggling 2024 campaign: “The winning formula for President Trump is very plain to see: It’s fewer insults, more insights and [a] policy contrast.” Fellow former Trump adviser Peter Navarro echoed that. “When Trump attacks [Vice President Kamala] Harris personally rather than on policy, Harris’s support among swing voters rises — particularly among women,” Navarro said.

Trump is not listening. Trump Allies Fear He’s Sabotaging His Own Campaign Trump has been in a self-destructive spiral since the moment Democrats replaced Joe Biden with Kamala Harris. . . . Republican donors and Trump campaign officials are struggling to understand why Trump seems to be sabotaging his own candidacy. One theory, according to sources, is that Trump has been experiencing trauma from his near-death experience following the assassination attempt at the rally last month in Butler, Pennsylvania. . . . Another theory is that Trump can’t let go of the fact that Biden dropped out. “They cheated by swapping Biden,” Trump has told people, according to a person who recently spent time with the Republican presidential nominee. The Trump campaign believed that Harris’s honeymoon would fade, but instead, the opposite has happened: Her momentum is surging.

The Trump campaign believed that Harris’s honeymoon would fade, but instead, the opposite has happened: Her momentum is surging. And get this: The emperor of insult, the director of dirty tricks, the sultan of snide, Roger Stone himself, wants Trump to cool it: Even Roger Stone wants Trump to tone down Harris attacks — but he's not listening There are several reasons for this: He does have Project 2025, or course, but he keeps running away from that because he knows it won’t sell politically. But he doesn’t have anything else. He gave a “speech” yesterday about his economic plan: Tic Tacs, tampons, turmoil: What Trump’s ‘economy’ speech actually covered But the broader issue here is that Trump’s “economy” speech was not a speech on the economy. It was a standard Trump campaign speech, with a few more lines about economic proposals slotted in on occasion. Over the course of the nearly 12,000 words spoken from the stage, about 2,000 actually detailed the economy. And even those were generally a mishmash of robotic teleprompter pledges and off-the-cuff riffs about whatever happened to be on Trump’s mind.

But there too, it’s mostly insults and promises to do the things he promised — and failed — to do the last time: build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. So: Trump’s insults are turning voters off, plus Harris and Walz are showing him they are better at insults than he is (better than Vance, too). The GOP is screaming (well, whispering) at him that he’s going to lose, and they are going to lose, if he keeps this up. Which he will — it’s all he knows, and more importantly, it’s all he has. — Minor Update 3:05 PM PDT",

    "text": "Police have issued an urgent warning as a new scam preys on vulnerable Australians. Scammers are seeking to forge wills and estate documents of vulnerable members in the Illawarra community in Sydney. Wollongong officers received reports of documents allegedly being forged earlier in the year, with inquiries ongoing. Elderly members of the community and their families have been urged to take precautions to lower the risk of the latest scam. Will fraud occurs when misleading or deceptive conduct is used while preparing a will, while executor fraud occurs when a person appointed to administer an estate uses deceitful practices to gain estate assets. Police have issued a warning as scammers are seeking to forge wills and estate documents of vulnerable members in the Illawarra community in Sydney.

Affected people, or anyone with information, have been urged to come forward to police.",

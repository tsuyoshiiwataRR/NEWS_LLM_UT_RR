    "text": "Betting Markets Flip for Kamala\nThe betting markets are now tipping in Kamala’s direction.\nThis is not good.\nI’m Tomi Lahren, more next.\nFolks, I keep warning not to underestimate the Harris Campaign for a reason and here’s another one- major betting markets now have Kamala favored to beat Trump in November.\nThis week, for the first time since BetUS opened the market, a Democrat is leading in the race.\nKamala’s odds-on favorite to win the White House with 55% implied probability according to the BetUS platform.\nAnd that edge is consistent across other major betting platforms, as well.\nNow the two candidates are still close, it’s not a landslide or a sure thing for Kamala by any means, BUT this trend is concerning to say the least.\nLike it or not, Kamala is the new shiny object dangling in front of an American electorate that has been sick of the same old thing.\nBefore Joe Biden dropped out, polling consistently showed us American voters did not like their choices. The same choices offered up in 2020.\nAnd now- just like I said they would- Democrats have switched up their candidate so late in the game they are riding on a honeymoon high that may last till the Fall.\nIt is no time for conservatives to be cocky.\nI’m Tomi Lahren and you watch my show “Tomi Lahren is Fearless” at\nOutkick.com",

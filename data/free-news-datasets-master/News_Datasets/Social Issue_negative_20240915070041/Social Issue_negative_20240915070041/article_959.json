    "text": "Time in Tbilisi: August 16, 2024 02:08 Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze on Thursday claimed the country’s President Salome Zourabichvili was “trying to drag the Government into an argument” over state awards being granted to Olympic medal-winners from the country. The comments by Kobakhidze, who leads the ruling Georgian Dream party's electoral office ahead of the parliamentary elections in October, followed a statement by Zourabichvili, who earlier today said awarding the athletes was a “serious matter, not something to be rushed”. She noted she intended to host a public celebration when Georgian competitors set for the Paralympic Games next month returned to the country. In contrast, the PM said holding an official reception for athletes after the conclusion of Olympic Games instead was an “accepted practice”, adding it was “important” for the Government to plan such an event. The head of the Government added handing state awards to athletes represented a “good practice” that he said had been established by him and Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili.",

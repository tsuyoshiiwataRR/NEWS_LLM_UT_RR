    "text": "https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2024/08/12/study-climate-change-hysteria-doesnt-convert-anyone/\nA report released Monday by USC’s Understanding America Study (UAS) suggests the use of hyperbolic terms to describe global warming has no effect on people’s perceptions of the urgency of climate change.\nThe\nstudy notes that climate crusaders like the UK’s Guardian newspaper have officially opted for expressions like “climate crisis” and “climate emergency” in an attempt to raise concern and convey urgency, yet it would seem that such efforts are in vain.\n“Instead of ‘climate change’ the preferred terms are ‘climate emergency, crisis or breakdown’ and ‘global heating’ is favoured over ‘global warming,’ although the original terms are not banned,” the Guardian\nstated in 2019 on announcing updates to its official in-house style guide.\nIn April of that same year, a team of advertising consultants from SPARK Neuro published the results of a\nhttps://www.breitbart.com/environment/2019/05/01/global-warming-not-scary-enough-alarmists-rebrand-climate-crisis/ suggesting that the expressions “global warming” and “climate change” do not frighten people enough, whereas a shift in vocabulary to “climate crisis” or “environmental collapse” seemed to produce a significantly stronger emotional response.\nThe expression “climate crisis,” for instance, got “a 60 percent greater emotional response from listeners” than “climate change,” the study found.\nIn its research, SPARK Neuro measured physiological data such as brain activity and palm sweat to quantify people’s emotional reactions to stimuli.\nThe team fixed electroencephalography (EEG) devices to the heads of 120 volunteers to gauge the electrical activity coming from their brains.\nAt the same time, a webcam monitored their facial expressions and sensors on their fingers recorded the sweat produced by heightened emotions.\nOf six different options, “global warming” and “climate change” performed the worst, beaten handily by “climate crisis,” “environmental destruction,” “weather destabilization,” and “environmental collapse.”\nThe CEO of SPARK Neuro, Spencer Gerrol, said that “global warming” and “climate change” are both neutral phrases with nothing “inherently negative or positive” about the words themselves, which could help explain why they elicit such a feeble emotional response.\nFurthermore, both global warming and climate change are “incredibly worn out,” Gerrol said, and no longer produce the reaction they might have once.\nFindings from the new USC study would now suggest that the contrary is true, namely, that people react more strongly to the terms “global warming” and “climate change” than to their more histrionic counterparts.",

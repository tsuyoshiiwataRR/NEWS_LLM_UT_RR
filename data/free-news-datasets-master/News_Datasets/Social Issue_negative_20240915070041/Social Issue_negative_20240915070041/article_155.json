    "text": "Grocery supplier costs also up Food prices in New Zealand rose by 0.6% in the 12 months to July, according to data released by Stats NZ. This follows a 0.3% decrease in the year to June 2024, showing a slight upward trend driven largely by the rising cost of restaurant meals and ready-to-eat food, which saw a 3.7% increase over the year. However, some food categories saw price reductions, with fruit and vegetables experiencing an 8.5% decline, and meat, poultry, and fish prices down by 1.1%. The drop in fruit and vegetable prices was particularly notable, with cheaper kumara, lettuce, and potatoes contributing to the decline, Stats NZ reported. Monthly food prices rise On a monthly basis, food prices increased by 0.4% in July 2024, following a larger 1% rise in June. The main driver of the monthly increase was the 4.5% rise in fruit and vegetable prices, with seasonal produce such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and apples contributing to the price hike. “Price increases were seen from typical seasonal produce,” said James Mitchell (pictured above left), Stats NZ’s consumer prices manager.

    "text": "Rising layoffs? The surge in jobless claims may have been a mirage. Remember that spike in jobless claims — aka layoffs — since the end of the school year? The surge in unemployment filings spawned fears about a worsening labor market and a weakening economy. But not to worry, the most recent reports suggest. The surge in jobless claims appears to have been just a temporary one tied to seasonal changes in the economy and the occasional major storm. The numbers tell the story. Just one month ago, actual jobless claims hit a one-year high of 280,555. They had been tracking in the 190,000s before the school year ended. Fast forward to last week, and only 199,530 people actually applied for unemployment benefits. It was the first time actual claims had dipped below 200,000 since the end of May. These figures reflect raw filings at state employment agencies before the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics applies seasonal adjustments (the seasonally adjusted total last week was higher at 227,000). What’s going on? Jobless claims have shown a historical pattern of rising in the early spring and peaking in midsummer before tapering off in the fall. This pattern seems to have been especially pronounced the past two years. The end of the school year appears to be one of the triggers since lots of people are entering or leaving the labor force. The summer is also when auto plants shut down for a few weeks to retool for new models. Some big auto-producing states allow workers to apply for temporary benefits. Michigan, for example, saw a big increase in jobless claims in July. The sporadic storm during hurricane season can also cause jobless claims to jump. Hurricane Beryl sent new unemployment filings soaring in Texas last month, but now most people have gone back to work. “The reduction in initial claims in the first two weeks of August strongly suggests that the rise in initial claims in July was overstated,” said Stuart Hoffman, senior economic advisor at PNC Financial Services. He noted that the same pattern took place last year. There’s no guarantee, of course, that layoffs won’t start to rise if the economy slows further. Businesses are hiring fewer people than at any time since the pandemic and job openings have fallen by one-third since hitting a record high a few years ago. A tepid increase in new jobs in July even raised fresh worries about a recession. Yet there’s no indication layoffs are marching higher. The rate of layoffs in June, for instance, matched a record low 0.9 in June, according to the government’s job-openings report. Typically the rate ranges from 1.2 to 1.4 in good economic times. Why are layoffs so low? The U.S. recently experienced its worst labor shortage ever and companies struggled mightily to find workers. Companies won’t easily resort to layoffs, economists say, given how hard it was to hire people in the first place. It would take a decline in sales or the threat of recession to prod them into firing more workers, economists say. “The bottom line is that, while the labor market is clearly cooling as firms slow the pace of hiring, layoffs remain historically low,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Santander Capital Markets.",

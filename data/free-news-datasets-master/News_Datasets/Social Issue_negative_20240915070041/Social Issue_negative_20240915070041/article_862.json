    "text": "“More than 150 pages of documents from a highly classified network.”\n90% of classified document cases now involve easily and entirely preventable situations where people who should not have had access to them, got access to them because it was easier for contractors or government agencies to employ them.\nPeople ask how does the Iranian Pentagon Chief of Staff who worked with an enemy government get security clearance?\nBut the NSC, the DOD and various agencies are full of people that would not have been allowed within a hundred miles of a government facility twenty years ago.\nDual citizens used to be barred from accessing classified documents. These days, Chinese citizens get access to whatever they want and you can be a dual citizen of an Islamic terror state and everyone will be shocked when you act like a citizen of an enemy state .\nGokhan Gun, a 50-year-old Falls Church, Virginia, resident who holds a dual citizenship with Turkey, was arrested August 9 by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nGun is an electrical engineer who works in the Department of Defense Joint Warfare Analysis Center.\nEarlier in the week, they claim, Gun printed off 82 pages marked as top secret. FBI agents found a backpack “prepared for his foreign trip” in the DOD engineer’s dining room.\nThe backpack was allegedly found to contain even more classified materials.\nOfficials say that Gun printed off and took more than 150 pages of documents from a highly classified network.\nIn the past, he has taken over a dozen trips to international destinations in Europe and the Middle East.\nThere’s plenty to delve into here, but let’s start with why a dual citizen was employed in the DOD Joint Warfare Analysis Center, and why he was able to access “150 pages of documents from a highly classified network” after taking multiple trips to the Middle East.\nGokhan Gun, 50, of Falls Church, Virginia, was born in Istanbul, Turkey, and is a dual citizen of Turkey and the United States. Through his employment, Gun possesses a Top Secret security clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and has received training on the proper handling and storage of classified information.\nOf course it’s Falls Church. Having a giant Islamist community near the hub of our security and government operation is always a great idea.\nI remember when American Jews who visited Israel or even had relatives there were barred from Federal employment.\nHere, an actual foreign citizen, born in Turkey, who retained citizenship there, was given access to highly classified documents.\nPacked for travel in a small personal belt bag, Gun allegedly had his U.S. passport and an expired passport from Turkey.\nHe was traveling with a Turkish passport.\nI don’t even blame Gun here. He was being a Muslim patriot. Only an insane country whose leadership has lost its mind would have given him the kind of access that it did.",

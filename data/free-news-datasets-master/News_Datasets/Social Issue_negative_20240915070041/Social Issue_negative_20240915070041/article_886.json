    "text": "It’s the Recommended exit for Cilento . The best solution, for the Anas managers . The one to get there first Agropoli and, running south, reach Palinuro e Cameroon . This is the exit recommended by Anas, despite the two deaths on July 18th. Mario Valiante and Wilma Fezza husband and wife, both lawyers, were headed to Roccadaspide. They followed the advice of Anas. And they ended up in a long and exasperating queue on the motorway. Overheated by the heat of July, 40 degrees in the cockpit . Twenty, thirty minutes of waiting in the car. Before finally “going out” in Eboli.\nMario and Wilma’s journey ended under the green road sign with the words “ EBOLI ”. A young truck driver from Nocera Inferiore hit them and killed them instantly. Mario and Wilma followed the advice of Anas. They ended up in the funnel . They were the last in line. A distracted truck driver didn’t see the queue and ran over everyone: cars and vans stopped in line .\nDal Last July 18th nothing has changed. Anas continues to recommend the Eboli exit, to arrive earlier and more relaxed in Cilento. Every morning, at the junction of death, two lines of cars now form. Traffic increased in August . It was predictable. There are those who are smart. They skip the queue. And they can’t get back into the lane. And so the tail is doubled . Many have asked the mayor of Eboli to place a patrol of traffic police at the crossroads between the junction and San Vito Martire Street . In two months, the white helmets have been “seen” only once. The cap is still there. At the junction that has never been redeveloped due to the presence of illegal structures. Bars, dairies and gastronomic businesses are doing a roaring trade. Politicians are renewing their promises. Now the new junction will be ready for 2027. Word of Mario Conte mayor of Eboli. Who will build the new exit? Uhm, uhm, politicians don’t answer. The tender hasn’t been done yet. Nor have the expropriations.\n#Eboli #dead #junction #changed\n– 2024-08-15 20:55:48",

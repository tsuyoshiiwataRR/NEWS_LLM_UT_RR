    "text": "In an article published on the Ohio State Senate’s website, Michele Reynolds wrote , “Abortion is killing the black community.” Abortion “is not health care,” it “is extermination.” And Reynolds is right — this industry is not only murderous, but its origins are inherently racist.\nMargaret Sanger, the founder of the infamous abortion hub Planned Parenthood, was an open believer in eugenics, which is the theory that “humans can be improved through selective breeding of populations.” When Sanger put her “birth control” plan into action, she had her eyes set on decreasing the amount of black people that walked the earth. And interestingly enough, Planned Parenthood does not hide this disturbing history.\nOn its website, the organization provides a multi-paragraph explanation of its history, including the details of Sanger’s “harmful” vision. “Margaret Sanger’s racism and belief in eugenics are in direct opposition to Planned Parenthood’s mission,” the abortion group concluded. “Planned Parenthood denounces Margaret Sanger’s belief in eugenics. Further, Planned Parenthood denounces the history and legacy of anti-Blackness in gynecology and the reproductive rights movement.”\nLifeNews is on GETTR. Please follow us for the latest pro-life news\nBut the reality is, these claims can only be described as pure lip service. Only a brief overview of modern statistics proves that Planned Parenthood, for all intents and purposes, is still discriminatory to its core.\nAs guest host and former Congressman Jody Hice said on Tuesday’s episode of “ Washington Watch ,” Planned Parenthood is “obviously trying to run from their racist roots.” Ryan Bomberger, co-founder and chief creative officer of the Radiance Foundation, agreed. “Well, sure,” he said, “they can try to run, but they can’t change their DNA.” But even beyond their inability to alter the foundation upon which they were built, Bomberger argued that this baby-victimizing organization has no interest in changing their DNA.\nAs if murdering babies of any ethnicity wasn’t enough, a policy report published by the Center for Urban Renewal and Education highlighted data from a 2011 report that found “black women make up 14 percent of the childbearing population, yet obtained 36.2 percent of reported abortions.” Additionally, “Percentages at these levels illustrate that more than 19 million black babies have been aborted since 1973.” And yet, the statistics only get increasingly bleak.\nThe research emphasized that an analysis of “abortion by ethnicity” confirms “black women disproportionately lead in the numbers.” For example, “in Mississippi, 79 percent of abortions are obtained by black women; in Washington, D.C., more than 60 percent; in Georgia, 59.4 percent; in Alabama, 58.4 percent.” And “in state after state, similar numbers are found, with black women aborting at two, three or more times their presence in the population.”\nThese details, the report contended, are but a small fraction of evidence that points to a startling reality: “In the 1850s, it was the black slave who sought freedom and equal protection under the law. Today it is the unborn child.”\nBomberger did not hold back any punches. Planned Parenthood, he urged, was “birthed out of the same racist, elitist pseudoscience that birthed the Holocaust, which is called eugenics,” and “they can’t run away from that.” While they like to pretend they’re different from the days of their founder, “They’re actually worse now … [with] over 360,000 [babies] every year killed by Planned Parenthood.”\nNeedless to say, “The origins of Planned Parenthood are rooted in this mindset that certain people didn’t deserve to live,” Bomberger said. In the early days of the rising push for abortion, those who were considered “unfit,” such as children conceived out of wedlock and poor black communities, were the primary target. But “today,” he stated, “it’s abortion on demand, where literally abortion is the number one killer in the black community. It kills more black lives in two weeks than the KKK killed in a century. That’s the reality.”\n“That’s stunning,” Hice stated. “I would imagine there [are] many women who may not know about Planned Parenthood’s origin.” As such, he added, “How can we get this out?” Because “people need to know.” In response, Bomberger explained that Radiance Foundation started “with a billboard campaign that called out the insane and inherent racism in the abortion industry.” Their journey of uncovering the racism in the abortion industry began by calling out the falsehoods that abortion giants promote. “Planned Parenthood and these Planned Parenthood-funded minority groups are trying to say [that] ‘abortions are [an] uplift out of poverty. Abortion is equality. It’s our empowerment.’” However, as Bomberger went on to ask, “How is any community empowered by killing its posterity?”\nThe truth is, “[A]bortion, no matter the color [of the baby], is devastating and wrong and so tragic.” But these abortion hubs are pushing the notion that there needs to be “more abortions in the black community.” And what people don’t realize, Bomberger urged, is that “Planned Parenthood brags … about how black people are their base,” and it “touts itself as an anti-racism organization.” But when all is said and done, “How can you be anti-racism when you’re the leading killer of black lives?” It just “goes to show the fraud of the anti-racism movement.”\nIt “is incredible information” to take in, Hice shook his head. But it begs the question, what about “black Christians who have accepted abortion as just simply part of the package when it comes to supporting Democrats?” Additionally, how do we respond to “the preachers who are more Democrat[ic] than they are gospel preachers when it comes to standing up for the unborn?”\nAccording to Bomberger, “[T]he dissonance is just unbelievable.” He elaborated, “[Y]ou’ve got the Democratic Party, which is the party of slavery, the party that went to war for slavery, the party of Jim Crow, the party of poll taxes and literacy tests — all the Jim Crow policies.” This is also “the same party today that is pushing unlimited abortion in the black community.” As such, he said, “What I say to those pastors” is that they need to “wake up.” Abortion is nothing other than “having lives made in the image of God destroyed under the name of some fake sort of equality [and] fake sort of reproductive justice.”\nUltimately, “[T]he only justice that pastors or … any other Christian … should be concerned with is biblical justice. And it’s not biblical justice to slaughter our unborn and to have women exploited by a multi-billion dollar abortion industry.”\nSo, Hice asked, where’s the encouragement in all this? As Bomberger put it, the encouragement buried in the grim facts is that “we’re seeing an awakening by pastors being bold and actually speaking out about this.” It’s not necessarily a “seismic shift, but even if it’s a handful of people here and a handful of people there, it’s a victory.” And as Hice noted, every movement “starts with a few.”\nBomberger agreed, and he concluded that what he wants to impart to people is this: “Have hope. Because when you are awakened, when you understand the truth, you have clarity and context. And it sets people free.”\nLifeNews Note: Sarah Holliday is a reporter at The Washington Stand, where this originally appeared.",

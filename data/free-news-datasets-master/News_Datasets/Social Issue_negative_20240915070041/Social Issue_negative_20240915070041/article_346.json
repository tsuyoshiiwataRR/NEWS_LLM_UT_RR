    "text": "Clarendon County Sheriff confirms false school shooting threat at Manning Junior High MANNING, S.C. (WIS) - The Clarendon County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) confirmed Thursday morning that a school shooting threat at Manning Junior High School was false. Clarendon County Sheriff Tim Baxley said children at the school started a rumor that a student at Manning Junior High was planning to bring a loaded weapon to school and shoot a group of students. Terrie Ard, the principal of Manning Junior High, released a public statement regarding the potential threat Wednesday evening. Ard said the school identified a person of interest and noted they are working closely with law enforcement to provide additional on-site officers. CCSO said deputies met with the child that was named in the rumor as well as the child’s parents and confirmed the threat was not true. Baxley said the school is looking into who started the rumor and will deal with it accordingly. Feel more informed, prepared, and connected with WIS.

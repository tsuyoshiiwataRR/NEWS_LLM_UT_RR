    "text": "HIV testing rates below target for young men in Papua New Guinea\nSurvey: A study based solely on peopleâ€™s responses to a series of questions.\nPeople: This is a study based on research using people.\nOne in six young men in Papua New Guinea have ever been tested for HIV, according to a PNG expert who says this is well below national targets. The researcher used data from a national demographic and health survey to look at HIV testing among 1275 men aged 15-24. They say 17.1% of the men had ever been tested, with men more likely to have been tested if they owned a mobile phone, had paid for sex, had multiple sexual partners or knew using condoms can reduce HIV risk. Men who were never married, lived in rural areas and consistently used condoms were less likely to be tested, the researcher says.\nJournal/conference: PLOS ONE\nLink to research (DOI):\n10.1371/journal.pone.0306807\nOrganisation/s: The University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG)\nAttachments:\nNote: Not all attachments are visible to the general public\nNews for:\nPacific\nMedia contact details for this story are only visible to registered journalists.",

    "text": "Michael Rubin Issues Apology For Black-On-Black Hate Comments After Backlash From ScHoolboy Q And Others Michael Rubin’s Wednesday (Aug. 14) interview with “ [The Breakfast Club](https://www.rap-up.com/2024/08/14/michael-rubin-confirms-not-like-us-was-banned-at-2024-all-white-party/)” saw him chopping it up about Drake, his annual all-white parties, and Meek Mill not having a “gay bone in his body,” to name a few topics. However, the business mogul found himself in a bit of trouble after commenting on what he perceived as a troubling trend of Black people tearing each other down. While defending the “ [Dreams and Nightmares](https://www.rap-up.com/2022/10/31/meek-mill-dreams-nightmares-10th-anniversary-concert/)” artist against rumors about his sexuality, Rubin asked, “Why do people want to change the narrative to try to hurt him?” He stated, “Look, I’m just being blunt because it’s me.

I hate when you n**gers be acting like n**gers… basically.” NO SUCH THING AS BLACK ON BLACK ANYTHING WTF — ScHoolboy Q (@ScHoolboyQ) [August 14, 2024] TRENDING [Ella Mai & Jayson Tatum Share First Look At Their Newborn Baby](https://www.rap-up.com/2024/08/11/ella-mai-jayson-tatum-share-first-look-at-their-newborn-baby/) [Fans Believe LeBron James and Drake Are Beefing](https://www.rap-up.com/2024/08/11/fans-believe-lebron-james-and-drake-are-beefing/) [Blacc Sam Details Nipsey Hussle's Last Moments In New Interview](https://www.rap-up.com/2024/08/10/blacc-sam-details-nipsey-hussles-last-moments-in-new-interview/) [Ye And Ty Dolla Sign's 'VULTURES 2' Lands No. 2 Spot On 'Billboard' 200 Chart](https://www.rap-up.com/2024/08/12/ye-and-ty-dolla-signs-vultures-2-lands-at-no-2-on-billboard-200/) [View More](https://www.rap-up.com/?s=)",

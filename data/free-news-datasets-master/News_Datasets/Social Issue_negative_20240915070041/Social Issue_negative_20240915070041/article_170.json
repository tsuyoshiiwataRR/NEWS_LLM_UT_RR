    "text": "Cognizant, a major player in the tech industry, has come under fire for offering a starting salary of Rs 2.5 lakh per annum (LPA) to engineering graduates during its mass recruitment drive. The outrage has been widespread, with many arguing that this salary is far too low for individuals entering the field with technical skills. Social media has been abuzz with criticism, with one user even pointing out that drivers in some cities earn more than these freshers. Amidst the heated debate, Vatsal Sanghvi, founder of 1811 Labs, a Bengaluru-based startup focusing on GenAI SaaS products, stepped forward to defend Cognizant&#039;s position. He stated that the salary should be considered a &quot;training stipend&quot; rather than a full-fledged salary, citing concerns over the quality of fresh graduates entering the workforce. “The quality of freshers is often so bad that even Rs 20k per month is overspending. Most don’t know how to communicate professionally, can’t code properly, and don’t know how to behave in a professional environment,” Sanghvi shared on X (formerly Twitter). He emphasized that the market is open, and those who believe the compensation is inadequate are free to seek opportunities elsewhere. “It is an open market—don’t apply if you don’t think it’s fair. Unlike other gigs, there’s plenty of opportunity to grow if these individuals focus on building skill,” he added. Social Media Backlash This defense, however, did not sit well with many online users, who were quick to challenge Sanghvi’s perspective. Critics argued that the responsibility for skill development should not solely rest on freshers, suggesting that companies should take proactive steps to provide training during the college years. &quot;Instead of complaining about the quality of freshers, why don&#039;t the companies plan on training them in college itself? Some weekend refresher courses, exclusive tie-ups with a few colleges, and running your plan there for free could be a win-win for everyone,&quot; one user proposed. Others pointed out that the Rs 2.5 LPA salary has remained stagnant for over a decade, with no adjustments made for inflation or the rising cost of living. One user commented, “This package was the same when I joined as a fresher way back in 2006. Everyone is pointing out the need for a correction with respect to inflation.” Despite the criticism, some individuals sided with Sanghvi, agreeing that the market dictates salary levels and that graduates dissatisfied with the offer should explore other job options. “Poor take. Rs 2.25 LPA is well above most jobs, and minimum wage should definitely not be per sector. If you think it’s too low, find another job. If you want Rs 186 crore, start the next Cognizant. No one is stopping you,” wrote a supporter. For more news like this visit The Economic Times.",

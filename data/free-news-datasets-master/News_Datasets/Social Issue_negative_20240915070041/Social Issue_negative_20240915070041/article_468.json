    "text": "Appleton furniture store owner sentenced following guilty plea in fentanyl case APPLETON- A 32-year-old Appleton man has been sentenced to [12 1/2 years ](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edwi/pr/fox-valley-man-sentenced-12-12-years-imprisonment-trafficking-fentanyl-and-possessing)in prison on Tuesday after pleading guilty to possession of fentanyl with intention to distribute, possessing firearms in furtherance of drug trafficking, and possessing firearms as a previously convicted felon. Christopher Turner was arrested at the furniture store he owned, Turner Furniture, 2448 W. College Ave. in December. According to court records, search warrants were issued by the Lake Winnebago Area Metropolitan Enforcement Group to check the store and two residences, in Menasha and Kaukauna, that were linked to Turner. Agents found over 18 grams of cocaine, 264 grams of illicitly made fentanyl, and two 9-mm pistols, both of which had extended magazines. LWAM had also used informants to make controlled buys of fentanyl from Turner between last October and November. According to the attorney's office, Turner is prohibited from having possession of a firearm and ammunition due to previous robbery convictions in Outagamie and Winnebago Counties. District Judge William C. Griesbach said that dealing fentanyl is akin to dealing poison due to the deaths the drug has caused across the country.

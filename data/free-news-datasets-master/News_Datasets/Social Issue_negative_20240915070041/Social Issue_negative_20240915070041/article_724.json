    "text": "8/15/2024 Philippines (International Christian Concern) — Aside from the Vatican, the Philippines is considered the only nation where divorce is illegal. That may soon change, and the Catholic church is opposing it.\nOn May 22, the House of Representatives passed the Absolute Divorce Act to the upper house of the Senate for final deliberation. If it passes the parliament’s upper chamber, the bill will become law.\nMedia outlets have reported strong support in the Senate and the wider public for this law’s passage. Other than the country’s Muslim population, which has had the right to divorce since 1977, Catholics in the Philippines have not had the right to divorce since the country was under Spanish rule in the 16 th century.\nWith nearly 80% of the country’s population being Catholic, the church’s opposition to the passage of the law is creating political divisions. The Catholic Bishops Conference has argued publicly that divorce goes against the teachings of Jesus and that it would make more sense to make the legal process of marriage annulment easier and less expensive for couples.\nMany politicians and anti-divorce law campaigners also publicly oppose the law, citing issues like domestic and sexual violence, financial stress, and the care of children in this public debate.\nTo read more news stories, visit the ICC Newsroom .

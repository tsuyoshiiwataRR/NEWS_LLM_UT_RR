    "text": "JACKSON, Miss. (WTVA) - The Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) confirmed the first death from a human case of West Nile Virus in the state in 2024. According to the agency, the unidentified patient in this case had several underlying health conditions. As of August 15, 2024, there have been a total of 17 human cases of West Nile Virus reported in the state. The last death from West Nile Virus reported in Mississippi was in 2022. West Nile Virus is transmitted primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito, and there are steps you can take to reduce your risk. Protect Yourself: - Stay indoors or take personal protective measures, especially between dusk and dawn, which are peak mosquito biting times. - Use an EPA-approved mosquito repellent with active ingredients such as DEET or picaridin. Products with up to 30 percent DEET will provide adequate protection under most conditions. Higher concentrations will provide longer-lasting protection. Use DEET concentrations of 10 percent or less on children ages 2-12. For children under 2-years-old, parents should consult their pediatrician. - Wear long-sleeved, long-legged clothing with socks and shoes when practical. Protect Your Home: - Dispose of outdoor tin cans, plastic containers, ceramic pots or similar water-holding containers. - Remove all discarded tires on the property. - Close garbage can lids. Be sure water does not collect in the bottom of garbage cans. - Turn over plastic wading pools and wheelbarrows when not in use. - Clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas and hot tubs.",

Melbourne in an apology statement on Thursday.\nThe statement said: “We recognize the strong feelings of all parties on this issue and particularly recognize the commitment and dedication shown by our musicians and staff this week .\nGillam accepted the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra’s apology. “I value my relationship with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, its performers and audiences and look forward to continuing our working relationship in the years to come, ” he said in a statement.\nCritics\nThe Melbourne Symphony Orchestra’s decision and subsequent apology caused an uproar on social media.\nProminent lawyer Greg Barnes called the cancellation “truly appalling,” later adding that “what often empowers art is that it’s political.” “\nLeo Schofield, art critic and former president of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, said of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra’s apology: “I wish Gillam had given a concert in Sydney. If he had, he would have received standing ovation from supporters who valued his courage as much as his courage. talent.”\nimage source, jaysongillham.com\nComment on the picture, “Music can do what words cannot,” said Gillam, “It has the ability to reach inside us and enter the heart of our movement.”\nCollecting donations for Palestinian children\nGillam’s comments in Melbourne were not the first in which he showed support for the Palestinians, as he had previously participated, with several Arab musicians, in a charity concert in Manchester Manchester church to collect donations for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund.\n“I am honored to be performing in one of the most poignant and meaningful concerts of my life at Manchester Cathedral on June 4, 2024, which has helped raise over £4,000 for the Children’s Relief Fund Palestine,” he said at the ceremony.\nHe said: “Music can do what words cannot. It has the ability to reach inside us and enter the heart to move us.”\n“I’ve spent a lot of time choosing my repertoire tonight. The scale of what we have seen over the past eight months is so great it is unbelievable. As Gary Lineker said – this is the worst thing we have ever seen in our lives. .”\n“I wanted to find something that reflected the magnitude of the moral and spiritual work ahead of us. “\nThe results of the Gaza war\nIsrael’s war in Gaza has become a volatile political issue in Australia that all parties have tried to manage carefully.\nThat was the case in countless other countries, and there were protests from Jewish and Muslim groups, as well as a sharp rise in anti-Islamism and anti-Semitism.\nTerrorists led by Hamas killed about 1,200 people in an attack on October 7, and took another 251 hostage to Gaza.\nAs a result of this attack Israel launched a massive military attack on Gaza and the current war began.\nAbout 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in this war so far, according to what the Ministry of Health in Gaza says.\nAmong them, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent organization working to promote press freedom, were at least 113 journalists.\n2024-08-15 18:13:26\n#Gaza #War #famous #pianist #concert #Australia #canceled #piece #dedicated #journalists",

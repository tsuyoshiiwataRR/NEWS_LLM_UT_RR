    "text": "Caitlin Clark is subjected to a unique situation. The Indiana Fever has an 11-15 tally despite Clark’s presence, which is very unusual for her. Hence, fans are suggesting that if the Fever is to make it to the playoffs, they would need new reinforcements that can infuse zest and a winning spirit in the team. However, the Fever’s general manager Lin Dunn has blamed the hard salary cap as a major impediment to their plans of having a game-changing trade. Dunn was present in a conversation with the IndyStar on Wednesday when she reflected on WNBA trade deadline and how the Fever is compelled to not make any major trade decisions just now. Let’s have a look at what this is about. LIN DUNN SPEAKS OF THE DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR CAITLIN CLARK & CO. “I’ve had a few phone calls, I’ve made a few phone calls, but what I think people don’t understand, in particular the fans, is that with a hard salary cap, it’s very difficult to maneuver and make trades, you know, realistic, substantial trades, because you’re limited with your salary cap and your roster spots. So I don’t anticipate there being any blockbuster trades,” Dunn stated as per IndyStar [https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/basketball/wnba/fever/2024/08/15/will-indiana-fever-make-a-move-ahead-of-wnba-trade-deadline-free-agents-gabby-williams-odyssey-sims/74806871007/]. The WNBA has a hard salary cap of $1,463,200. The Fever already has a total cap allocation of $1,396,695 and a cap space of $66,505. This is one of the prime reasons that the WNBA won’t be having many trades this season. The best they can do is to move a benched player to another team while acquiring a player who has been benched most of the season. Caitlin Clark [https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024-06-01T200031Z_901347053_MT1USATODAY23444438_RTRMADP_3_WNBA-CHICAGO-SKY-AT-INDIANA-FEVER.jpg]Jun 1, 2024; Indianapolis, Indiana, USA; Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark (22) reacts after a call during a game against the Chicago Sky during a game at Grainbridge Fieldhouse. Mandatory Credit: Michelle Pemberton/INDIANAPOLIS STAR-USA TODAY Sports Plus, to make things difficult for franchises, all players have fully guaranteed salaries this year. Therefore, even if a player is released by any franchise, they will have to pay the athlete the remaining amount. Though the situation is complicated for franchises, they can acquire players who have not been a part of the WNBA in the prorated contracts. WHO CAN THE INDIANA FEVER ACQUIRE? When it comes to the Fever’s current season, they would want to acquire someone who can play the second fiddle or a connector between layups. Plus, another quality that they will be on the lookout for is a player to be strong in defense. The athlete can join the Fever if they have been waived by their previous team or have not taken the hardwood in this season. This makes a solid case for the three Olympic stars. Belgian center Emma Meesseman and French guards Gabby Williams [https://www.essentiallysports.com/wnba-basketball-news-after-angel-reese-gabby-williams-receives-huge-praise-from-diamond-deshields-over-her-physical-gift-amid-looming-wnba-return/] and Marine Johannes have had a brilliant Olympic season. Hence, they can try to make a place in the WNBA demanding their fair share of money. However, as per the cap space, there isn’t a lot for the Fever to pay which can foil their plans of signing a star player. “They missed the first part of the season to train. Now, they’ve gone through the Olympics. They’re tired, and if they come back, it’ll be a lot of money. There’s not a lot of money to give anybody,” Dunn exclaimed of the three athletes. Whether the Fever will acquire a star player or not is something that is yet to be seen. But, the WNBA restrictions holding Clark & Co. from getting reinforcements is something that stands true.

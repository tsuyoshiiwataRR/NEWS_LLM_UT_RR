    "text": "KARACHI: The Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) has voiced significant concerns over the ongoing issues with slow internet connectivity, persistent faults, and restricted access to social media platforms. In a statement released on Thursday, President of the KCCI Iftikhar Ahmed Sheikh said that despite assurances that internet connectivity would improve following the installation of a safety firewall, the problems continue, severely impacting all forms of business operations. Sheikh reported that the chamber has received multiple complaints from member firms struggling to connect with clients both domestically and internationally via social media, particularly WhatsApp, for nearly a week. “We have been in continuous contact with various telecom service providers, who promised improvements, yet the issue remains unresolved and appears to be taking longer to address,” he explained. He added that the sluggish internet and malfunctioning social media apps have made it nearly impossible for the business community to obtain quotes and other essential documentation from international vendors and buyers, potentially leading to severe financial losses. “While it’s difficult to quantify the exact impact at this moment, the ongoing delays suggest that the losses could be substantial,” Sheikh noted. Sheikh also highlighted the struggles faced by IT freelancers working remotely for foreign companies, who are experiencing significant delays due to internet issues. “In today’s digital age, Pakistan cannot afford such disruptions. Immediate action is necessary to restore connectivity; otherwise, these delays will not only lead to financial losses but also tarnish Pakistan’s reputation globally,” he stated. He emphasized that freelancers and IT professionals, who are crucial in generating much-needed foreign exchange for the country, should not be deprived of essential resources required for their work.Sheikh urged the Ministry of Information Technology & Telecommunication and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to address this urgent issue and accelerate efforts to fully restore internet connectivity across Pakistan.

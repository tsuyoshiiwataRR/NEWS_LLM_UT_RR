    "text": "Jennifer Autar and Natasha Gregoire were found guilty this week of attempted arson in the second degree and attempting to intentionally damage a dwelling by lighting a fire while a resident was inside the building, the Schenectady County Prosecutor's Office said.\nSchenectady police were called to a fire reported on Forest Roads on Jan. 29, 2022. Officers used home surveillance video to learn how the woman sparked the blaze, authorities said.\nThey poured gasoline on top of a natural gas meter and a porch and set it alight, the prosecutor said.\nThe fire trailed away from the home, and firefighters put it out before anyone was hurt or anything was burned.\nInvestigators traced the arsonists to a rented car. They later determined the women had used the GMC Arcadia to spark the fire. They wore masks, glasses, and other disguises, the prosecutor said.\nWhen confronted by police, the women claimed it was all a prank. The jury deliberated for only forty minutes before convicting the Autar and Gregoire, the prosecutor said.\nSchenectady\n ",

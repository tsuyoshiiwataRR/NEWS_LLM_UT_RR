    "text": "EDMONTON — Alberta Premier Danielle Smith says her government will introduce legislation on pronouns in schools after classes begin in September.\nSmith said the new policy requiring parents to consent before children under 16 can change their names or pronouns in schools will be proposed in the fall legislature session that begins in late October.\n\"I don't want to presuppose what the outcome of those deliberations would be, but there will be lots of time to be able to get the policies in place and to implement them, so we have to make sure we have that robust discussion,\" Smith told an unrelated news conference on Thursday.\nHer comments come about three weeks before most kindergarten to Grade 12 schools open their classrooms.\nSmith said she intends to bring legislation forward for a suite of policies she first announced in January.\nThose include restricting transgender youth access to gender-affirming health care, banning transgender participation in female sports, and requiring parental consent or notification on sex education and changes to pronouns and names in schools.\n\"Once you've passed legislation, regulations have to be implemented,\" said Smith, who did not offer specifics about what enforcement would look like.\nFollowing Smith's announcement, Kristopher Wells, a Canada Research Chair for the Public Understanding of Sexual & Gender Minority Youth at MacEwan University in Edmonton, wrote on social media that the premier's \"obsession\" with the transgender community is \"beyond weird.\"\n\"The fact that she ignores our crumbling health-care system to obsess over what parts people have in their pants is deeply disturbing. This trans panic she is manufacturing is hateful, hurtful and needs to stop,\" Wells wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\nLGBTQ+ advocacy groups Egale Canada and Skipping Stone Foundation have said if Alberta moves ahead with the proposed changes, they would bring legal action.\nSmith’s announcement follows similar moves from New Brunswick and Saskatchewan.\nSaskatchewan passed a law in October preventing children under 16 from changing their names or pronouns at school without parental consent.\nThat province invoked the rarely used notwithstanding clause to override sections of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Saskatchewan's Human Rights Code.\nDozens of teachers soon signed an online petition calling on school divisions not to follow the law.\nThe Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission has said invoking the notwithstanding clause significantly affects the rights of minors.\nHeather Kuttai, a former Saskatchewan human rights commissioner, resigned over the legislation, saying it assaults the rights of gender-diverse children.\nA report from Saskatchewan's child advocate said it violates rights to gender identity and expression. The report by Lisa Brodaalso raised concerns that teachers may be violating their professional standards of practice if they follow it.\n—With files from Jeremy Simes in Regina\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 15, 2024.\nLisa Johnson, The Canadian Press",

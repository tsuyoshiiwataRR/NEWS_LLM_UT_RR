    "text": "15 August 2024, 17:11 WAT New Informate 5 hours wey don pass \"How any pesin go dey ask for di death of dia son? na wetin Nirmala Rana, 60, ask as she siddon by di bed of her 30-year-old son, Harish.\nFor 2013, Harish wey be civil engineering student fall from di fourth floor of one building for di northern Indian city of Chandigarh and get ogbonge head injuries.\nE never fit comot bed since den, e no fit tok or feel anytin for 11 years, sometin doctors dey call \"vegetative state\".\nIm papa Ashok, tok say \"we carry am go evriwia. We carry am go goment and private hospitals but notin work.\"\nE add say, \"we don hear and read about miracles but prayers and medicine no work for us.\"\nPatients wey dey vegetative state dey awake, dem no dey inside coma, but no sabi anytin wey dey happun bicos of ogbonge brain damage.\nNirmala neva even chop breakfast and afternoon don reach. But for ova a decade, her life don dey about her pikin, from making im bed to changing im clothes to taking care of evritin im need.\nHarish wey be former bodybuilder no look like 30-year-old man. Im face don enta inside and dey look like skeleton.\nCatheter dey hang from im bed and feeding tube dey comot from im belle. E don get deep and big bedsores wey don cause more infections.\nE lie still ontop di bed and di only way e fit dey follow pipo tok na through im eyes.\nIm mama say, \"I don even forget wetin crying be like\".\nWia dis foto come from, BBC/Rana family\nWetin we call dis foto, Harish dey chop wit feeding tube, or food pipe, for im belle and no fit tok Financially exhausted afta years of efforts, last year, im parents bin beg make dem arrange medical team wey go consider euthanasia to end Harish suffering.\nEuthanasia na di act of purposely ending pesin life to end pesin suffering, where by doctor go give di pesin legal drug.\nIm mama say, \"I don taya. If sometin do me now, who go take care of am?\"\nShe argue say, \"we wan donate im organs, di ones wey im no dey use fit help odas. We go see our son for dem but im go get peace\".\nOne Delhi court bin reject di request.\nDi court order tok say, \"di facts show say di petitioner no dey alive through mechanical means, and e fit sustain imself witout any extra external aid\".\n\"So di petitioner dey live and no one including doctor dey permitted to cause death of anoda pesin wit lethal drug, even if na to relieve di pesin from pain and suffering.\"\nDebatable issue For 2011, India Supreme Court face moral and ethical palava wen dem deny active euthanasia for Aruna Shanbaug wey be nurse wey spend decades for vegetative state afta one ward attendant attack am for 1973.\nDi court rule say Shanbaug never die and suppose continue to dey live.\nShanbaug stay for dat vegetative state till she die for 2015.\nBut dat judgement don mark how India dey judge dia end of life cases.\nBifor, all kain euthanasia dey illegal for India but for complex judgement, court rule say \"passive euthanasia\" or dem fit administer withdrawal of food from patient for some situations.\nFor 2018, di Supreme Court rule say dat passive euthanasia sef need to pass through legal channels for pipo wey dey permanent vegetative state.\nE tok say petition for passive euthanasia need to dey filed for court and go dey based on wetin doctor tok.\nDis mata wey don cause kasala don come back bicos of Harish Rana, as di family dey plan carry di mata go India top court afta dia plea bin dey rejected for lower court.\nEven wit di setback, di family get hope say di kontri highest judicial authority go las-las rule for favour dem.\nFor now, India law dey allow passive euthanasia wey be to intentionally let patient to die by holding back artificial life support but dem no dey allow for active euthanasia.\nManish Jain wey be di lawyer wey dey work for Ranas say, \"di court say im no dey sustained by life support system but food pipe na kind of life support. All we fit do na to go Supreme Court.\"\nDat day for August Na for di evening of 5 August 2013 wen Ashok Rana get call say im son don \"injure\".\nIm papa say, \"di doctor tell us say di nerves for im brain don dry up finish.\"\nOva ten years later, Harish dey chop wit feeding tube for im belle and dat one cost reach Rs 15,000 a month ($179). Monthly medical expense dey reach between Rs 25,000-30,000 ($357).\nTo fit afford am, im papa and mama dem sell dia house for Delhi to live for one two bedroom flat for di outskirts of di capital.\nBut dem dey find am hard to continue to dey pay for treatment.\nAshok Rana monthly pension of Rs 3,600 neva reach for household expenses tok less of Harish medical care. To add more money inside, Ashok dey sell sandwich and burgers for local cricket grounds for weekend.\nIf di Supreme Court no gree for di euthanasia, di family want make goment cover di bills of Harish for hospital.\nWia dis foto come from, BBC/Rana family\nWetin we call dis foto, Harish papa, Ashok, dey find am hard to pay im pikin medical bills and dey worry say who go take care of im pikin if e no fit Na only few kontris dey gree for euthanasia wey include Switzerland, Spain, Australia and 11 states for United States.\nBut for most kontris, e still dey illegal.\nLaws around UK for instance no allow pipo to ask for medical help to die but new bill to allow assisted suicide dey Scottish Parliament dis autumn.\n\"Pipo believe say na God dey give life and na only am fit take am away,\" na so RR Kishore, wey be doctor and advocate, tok. E also dey serve as Supreme Court lawyer and be di president of di Indian Society for Health and Law Ethics.\n\"E no dey eva clear because pesin wey dey unconscious today fit conscious tomorrow but if we end pesin life, we don comot di chance of recovery.\n\"For Harish case, I tink say e go make sense to make medical board wey include a cardiologist, a physiologist, and a general physician wey go reason weda make dem comot life support.\n\"Di koko of di mata be say, di court no get first hand assessment of di patient clinical condition.\"\nNirmala Rana bin once dey hope say her pikin go recover one day but as time don go reach years, di day still neva come.\n\"I remember am dey waka around di house dey ginger on top bodybuilding. E go come ask me make I measure im biceps.\"\nNow she just dey wait make her son die.",

    "text": "LOCALS are furious at being kept all night by a car park of confused driverless AI taxis that continually beep at each other. Residents captured the moment driverless cars began driving around in circles with their lights on in the middle of the night. The driverless taxis, operated by Waymo, have reportedly been causing disturbances throughout the day as well. When the AI cars were first introduced to the neighborhood, locals were excited to see the new technology in practice. But the novelty has quickly worn off for many residents who \"don't find it funny anymore\". Randol White, resident, told the Los Angeles Times: \"I was happy to see the Waymos coming in, but this aspect of it, I'm not a fan.\" The 57-year-old said he first noticed the disturbance two weeks ago when the AI cars began going off at 4am. Despite reaching out to the company, he feels powerless to stop the disturbances. The AI cars are left in the parking lot and residents have no one to speak to once the cars start malfunctioning. \"That's the most frustrating thing, you're just yelling into the void,'\" Randol added. Most read in Motors Waymo has noted the problem and said they are working on a fix. The company said: \"We have identified the cause and are in the process of implementing a fix.\" Russel Pofsky, who has lived in the area for 20 years, said heâ€™s never experienced anything like this. The longtime resident claimed the loss of sleep has made him \"more cranky\" than ever before. Other neighbors echo the sentiment. Christopher Cherry, who was initially excited about the technology, now finds the constant beeping a major distraction, affecting both his work and sleep. As residents wait for a fix, their patience is wearing thin, with many simply wishing the honking would stop. It comes after a new EU rule stated that all cars will now be fitted with speed-limiting AI tech. And new AI speed cameras being rolled out on UK roads can \"see inside your car\" and recognise \"every passenger\" before seeing pictures of them to the police",

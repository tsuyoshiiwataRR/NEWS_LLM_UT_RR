    "text": "Wages under the current federal government have risen at a higher rate than previous governments over the past three decades, yet the average Tasmanian is arguably struggling more than they ever have over that time. Under the Albanese government, which came to office just two years ago, wages have gone up 3.8 per cent a year, while under the previous Liberal government, wages went up 2.2 per cent a year. Under the Labor government before that, wages rose by 3.5 per cent per annum, and under the Howard government - which held power the longest of any government over the past 28 years - wages went up 3.6 per cent a year. Tasmanian economist Saul Eslake said Tasmanian wages rose 5.1 per cent over the year to the June quarter, faster than any other state or territory, mainly because the state had a higher proportion of lower-paid and public sector workers. Mr Eslake said the fastest wage growth nationally had been in the health care and the social assistance sector, where the Wage Price Index was up 6.2 per cent over the year to the June quarter. He said this was largely due to big increases in wages awarded by the Fair Work Commission to workers in the aged care sector. \"Other sectors with above-average wage growth have been public administration and safety, up 5 per cent, education and training, up 4.4 per cent, and retail trade, up 4.2 per cent,\" Mr Eslake said. He said there were three reasons why wages overall had risen faster under the current government: And Mr Eslake has said there are three reasons why life at present seems more unaffordable. While wages have risen at a faster rate, so have prices. The Consumer Price Index has risen at an average rate of 4.9 per cent per annum since 2022, with the prices of essential items rising at a rate of 5.3 per cent, compared to discretionary items at 4.4 per cent. Mr Eslake said this means real wages have fallen at an average annual rate of 1 per cent under the current government, compared to 0.1 per cent under previous Coalition governments. Secondly, he said personal income taxes had taken a \"growing bite\" out of incomes, partly due to bracket creep and partly due to the expiry of the Coalition&apos;s low and middle-income tax offset. \"The tax cuts which came into effect at the beginning of July will partly offset that, and the Albanese Government rejigged them so that all taxpayers get something, but it doesn&apos;t completely offset the increase in the tax take over the past decade,\" Mr Eslake said. Thirdly, mortgage holders have been hit hard by 13 increases in interest rates between May 2022 and November 2023. Mr Eslake added real living standards had demonstrably fallen quite a lot in the past three years. \"Real per capita household disposable income has fallen by 9.6 per cent from its peak in the June quarter of 2021, including by 5.8 per cent since the Albanese government came to office,\" he said.",

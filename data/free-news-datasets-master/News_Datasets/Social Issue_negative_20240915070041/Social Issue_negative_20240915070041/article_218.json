    "text": "Scams often make their rounds through social media, whether it is through a post trying to sell puppies or a supposed friend asking for money. But a new wave of scamming now involves children falsely represented as missing. According to Full Fact, a fact-checking website, a Facebook post about a child named “Tyler White” was accompanied by a physical description and a message stating the child had been missing since leaving for his first day of school. A picture was also attached to the post, but it was not of a “Tyler White”; it was a photo of a 14-year-old girl from Australia. The website states the child in the picture was not missing, but was instead looking for a bone marrow transplant. Several variations of the post, featuring different names and other information, also circulated through the social media app. After the post was shared repeatedly, Full Fact states, the person who posted the material then began to advertise certain things, such as housing websites and surveys. Cherokee County Sheriff Jason Chennault said he has noticed these posts, but doesn’t know the purpose behind them. To help avoid a potential scam, Chennault said those wanting to share the post should be vigilant in looking over the information and the attached photo. “Sometimes it’s really obvious. It will say ‘Tahlequah Police Department has found this child,’ and the officer in the picture is obviously not wearing a Tahlequah police uniform,” Chennault said. Chennault said calls to the sheriff’s office about social media scams are not constant, but the issue does resurface every few months, with elderly folks often being the victims. To help mitigate a social media scam, Chennault encourages people to call local law enforcement if they have any questions. “A good rule of thumb is, if it seems too good to be true or too far-fetched to be true, then it is usually not [true],” Chennault said. “What we try to tell people is if they have a question about something like that, an offer for money or a request for money, they are more than welcome to come up here and we will do our best to figure out if it is a legitimate deal or not.” Scams don’t always take place via social media, but sometimes through email. Jonathan Rader, owner of Rader Computers, said people should always question the identity of the sender. An example is how some scammers pretend to be Microsoft employees, asking the receiver to call them, and then a computer problem, like a virus, will latch onto the victim's system. Rader said anytime an email asks the recipient to call someone – especially if it claims to be from a large company – it is usually a scam. Researching the phone number or email can help recipients vet the information and determine if it is legitimate. Another Facebook scam Rader said people should be wary of is when a supposed close friend messages or makes a post about needing money. Having multiple forms of contact allows the friend to be reached so a determination can be made as to whether the monetary request is a scammer or real.",

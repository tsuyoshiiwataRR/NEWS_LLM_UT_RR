    "text": "The police in St Thomas have shot and killed three men who allegedly engaged them in a shootout on Thursday morning. The men are yet to be identified by the police. About 4:00 a.m., police personnel allegedly responded to a report of burglary and theft at Poor Man's Corner along Grants Pen main road in St Thomas. One of the men was reportedly fatally shot at the scene, however, his accomplices drove away. Police personnel reportedly pursued the other men, who challenged them in a shootout. During the alleged confrontation two men were shot and killed and a nine millimetre pistol affixed with a magazine containing five rounds was seized. The Independent Commission of Investigations has launched a probe into the matter. - Rasbert Turner Follow The Gleaner on X and Instagram @JamaicaGleaner and on Facebook @GleanerJamaica.

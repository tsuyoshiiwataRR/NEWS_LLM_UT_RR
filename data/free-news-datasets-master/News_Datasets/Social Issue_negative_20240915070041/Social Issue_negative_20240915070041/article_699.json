    "text": "Cocoa Police Warn Residents About Increasing Trend of Automated Text Messaging, Spam Robotexts By [Space Coast Daily](https://spacecoastdaily.com/showme/spacecoastdailymaster/) // August 15, 2024 Spam robotexts are now more prevalent than illegal robocalls BREVARD COUNTY, FLORIDA – Automated text messaging has grown more popular, with many companies using robotexts to communicate directly with consumers. Spam robotexts are now more prevalent than illegal robocalls. Robotexts are also used to transmit emergency information, such as inclement weather warnings, school closings and other pertinent information. The Federal Communications Commission bans text messages sent to a mobile phone using an auto-dialer unless the consumer has given consent to receive the message, or the message is sent for emergency purposes. However, illegitimate companies and scammers tend not to heed these rules. Spam robotexts are potentially more dangerous than robocalls because malicious links can be clicked on directly via text. Responding, liking or clicking on the contents of the text will show the scammer that the phone number is active, making the targeted user vulnerable to further messages. Avoid answering texts from unrecognized numbers. Responding to, liking or clicking these messages shows the scammer that the targeted user is active and will lead to more frequent scam messages. – Avoid becoming a victim by doing the following: • Do not click on links in text messages from unknown numbers as they often contain malware or lead to malicious websites. • Consider downloading text and call blocking apps to further prevent these scam texts from reaching a mobile phone. Be sure to do research the apps before downloading to ensure that the app is legitimate. • Know suspicious text messages from a five to six-digit short code telephone number may be a scam, unless the sender has registered the number in the U.S. Short Code Directory and the content of the message matches the registrant.",

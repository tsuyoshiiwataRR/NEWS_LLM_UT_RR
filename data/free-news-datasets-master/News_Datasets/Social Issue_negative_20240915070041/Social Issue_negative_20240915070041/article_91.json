    "text": "Over [a thousand people](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/08/14/over-1000-anti-mass-migration-protestors-and-social-media-posters-arrested/) taking part in or supporting anti-mass migration protests in the [United Kingdom](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/08/14/diplomacy-every-new-uk-foreign-affairs-appointee-has-said-nasty-things-about-trump/) have been arrested—far higher than the number of people-smugglers detained last year. On Tuesday, British police boasted that over 1,024 people had been arrested and 575 charged for taking part in or inciting disorder or “stirring up hatred” on [social media](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/08/12/fbi-conducted-nationwide-social-media-censorship-and-surveillance-before-2022-midterms/). In some cases, protesters have been convicted for as little as [shouting](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/08/09/anti-mass-migration-protestor-gets-two-years-in-prison-for-shouting-at-police/) at police. Others have been arrested for posting [“inaccurate information”](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/08/09/starmers-stasi-cops-arrest-middle-aged-woman-for-social-media-post-containing-inaccurate-information/) about the migration-background suspect in a deadly mass stabbing in Southport, which sparked the current unrest. Some of those arrested are [children](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/08/12/police-arrest-12-year-old-who-took-park-in-anti-mass-migration-protests/), including at least two boys aged 12 and another aged just 11. Prime Minister Sir Keir [Starmer](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/08/09/uk-pm-starmer-warns-elon-musk-it-is-dangerous-to-call-out-two-tier-policing/) threatened [draconian](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/08/01/leftist-uk-pm-promises-draconian-crackdown-on-people-protesting-mass-stabbing-of-children/) measures against the protesters when the disorder began. Some accuse the premier, [prosecutors](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/08/07/chief-prosecutor-warns-dedicated-police-officers-are-scouring-social-media-to-arrest-people-for-retweets/), and police of implementing [ two-tier](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/08/06/two-tier-policing-cops-admit-video-of-officer-asking-muslim-mob-to-deposit-weapons-at-mosque-to-avoid-arrest-impacted-on-public-confidence/) justice, with mobs of [Muslim](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/08/06/armed-muslims-take-over-englands-second-city-chase-out-journalists/) counter-demonstrators able to harass journalists and [attack](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/08/06/manager-confirms-police-have-not-been-in-touch-since-muslim-mob-surrounded-pub-beat-white-customer/) white Britons as the police adopted a [hands-off](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/08/07/cops-admit-they-abandoned-englands-second-city-to-muslim-mob-because-community-leaders-said-demo-would-be-policed-within-themselves/) approach in consultation with so-called “community leaders.” ILLEGALS NOT ARRESTED. People [smugglers](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/03/22/people-smuggler-transported-migrants-into-u-s-through-sewer-pipes/) have been arrested at a far lower rate by the British government. Home Office statistics show only 246 were arrested last year, when the notionally right-wing [Conservative Party](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/07/25/data-farages-reform-uk-outpolled-conservative-party-amongst-youth-voters/) was still in government, along with just 86 pilots of small boats transporting illegals across the English Channel. Last year, nearly [30,000](https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/channel-crossings-tracker) illegals crossed the English Channel in small boats, but very few were actually arrested for the offense of “illegal arrival.” Even factoring in arrests for illegals working without a permit, arrests totaled just 380 in 2023. Moreover, the new Labour government has already [scrapped](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/08/07/leftist-uk-govt-plots-to-scatter-migrants-all-over-britain-despite-anti-mass-migration-protests/) the Rwanda deportation plan, which would have seen [illegal](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/02/29/ice-arrests-guatemalan-illegal-who-sexually-assaulted-kids/) aliens transported to the African country to claim [asylum](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/02/29/britain-will-be-unrecognizable-uk-registers-record-migrant-numbers/), wasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer pounds already spent readying the scheme. Prime Minister Sir Keir [Starmer](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/08/09/uk-pm-starmer-warns-elon-musk-it-is-dangerous-to-call-out-two-tier-policing/) claims he will take action on the Channel crisis, but so far this year, over [ 33,000](https://www.frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news/news-release/eu-external-borders-irregular-border-crossings-fall-nearly-40-this-year-ZXxDJD) illegals have attempted to or succeeded in reaching England, with a significant uptick in crossings since Labour took over from the [Conservatives](https://thenationalpulse.com/2024/07/25/data-farages-reform-uk-outpolled-conservative-party-amongst-youth-voters/).",

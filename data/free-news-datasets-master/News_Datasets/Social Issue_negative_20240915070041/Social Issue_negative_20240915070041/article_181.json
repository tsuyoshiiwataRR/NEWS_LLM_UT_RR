    "text": "RC Area Schools have lost a good educator and superintendent as it is becoming clear that in this climate, if you don't like someone, accuse them of being a racist. You smear their good name to promote your agenda.\nWho decides what affordable housing costs? What is the yearly income of each of the committee members that decides what affordable housing is?\nLet the business decide when they want to open and sell liquor. Keep politics out of this!\nAm I the only one who sees a comparison between the Sturgis Rally and the southern border? Drugs, crime and human trafficking coming into our communities but in one case our state and local governments invite them to come.\nI wish that people would understand, and business owners would enforce, the SERVICE animal distinction. A \"service\" animal is different than a pet or comfort animal. Having pets walking the isles of grocery stores, sometime leaving their calling cards, having them as the next table occupant in food establishments, yesterday had two lab puppies walking all over the tables at Sam's food court, is becoming more and more common.",

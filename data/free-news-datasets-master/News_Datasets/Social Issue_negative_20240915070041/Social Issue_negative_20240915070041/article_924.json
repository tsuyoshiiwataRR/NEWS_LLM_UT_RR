    "text": "By Nancy Harty ,\n4 hours ago\nCHICAGO (WBBM NEWSRADIO) - At a meeting Wednesday, the head of the CTA backed criticism of a redesigned DuSable Lake Shore Drive that does not include bus-only lanes.\n“It was loud and clear” what people thought of the plan to redesign the north end of DuSable Lake Shore Drive. President Dorval Carter Jr. said that at Wednesday’s CTA board meeting about protests by some aldermen outside an open house regarding the lack of dedicated bus lanes.\n“I think that kind of advocacy is always very helpful because it amplifies a lot of what CTA tries to convey,” Carter said.\nThe Chicago Sun-Times reported Carter said he doesn’t have a crystal ball to know if that will influence the final outcome of the project led by City and State transportation agencies.\nPlanners said last week they were only considering the non-dedicated bus lane design among the final five options. Instead of expensive options like that, they said they’re opting to increase bus capacity and install bus-only lanes on ramps.\nCritics warn a car-centered highway would encourage driving over public transit.\nProject leaders are expected to finish studies and apply for federal grants for the $3 billion redesign between Grand and Hollywood.\nListen to WBBM Newsradio now on Audacy!\nSign up and follow WBBM Newsradio\nFacebook | Twitter | Instagram | TikTok\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Let's be very clear about this.\nAmber Harrison was not sexually harassed at work. But when she left Channel Seven after an affair with her boss, she had to sign a confidentiality agreement.\nSo the disappearance of the Amber Harrison footage from\nFour Corners tells you everything you need to know about what happens to women who sign these documents. I'm no insider in this but I'm pretty sure that as soon as the ABC aired footage of Harrison, the threats to injunct rained down hard.\nHarrison was already subject to court orders from Seven. The threat of injunction would have been terrifying for Louise Milligan and the whole team. No wonder they ditched Harrison who must still be devastated about everything she's gone through.\nSilenced for life.\nFortunately for us,\nAnna Cody is now in charge. Cody marks her first year as Sex Discrimination Commissioner on September 4 and is travelling around the country on behalf of the Australian Human Rights Commission consulting with Australians on sexual harassment at work.\n\"We need to be very careful of silencing victims,\" she says. I think she means that we can't keep doing what we are doing because the pattern will repeat. It is repeating.\n\"It is unfair, not a compassionate response, not trauma-informed.\"\nRight now, it's an everyday occurrence that women sign documents giving away their rights to talk about what happened to them when their bosses felt them up, mocked their sexuality, asked unbelievably intrusive questions.\nThey are, as Harrison said in the promotional segment aired and then ditched by the ABC: \"Silenced for life.\"\nCody says there are so many options which would still make victims feel as if they had some control over their lives. Organisations could be named, systemic patterns of incidents at a workplace could be highlighted, if a victim who signed an NDA but still wants change.\n\"The overall aim is absolutely to stop sexual harassment. We know it's an endemic problem,\" she says.\nAnd while lawyers keep telling me how useful it is for victims to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and confidentiality agreements, here's what those signatures do - they make the sickness of workplace sexual harassment incurable and invisible. Cody says we need transparency and accountability in these matters so women can choose to work in workplaces that are safe.\n\"We need to have a very clear discussion about how they are used, when they are used and that does have to be absolutely negotiated in a way that ensures lawyers recognise that there are options involved.\"\nOptions? What do you mean? Cody surprises me by saying lawyers don't even know there are options. Then she says: \"You'd be aware of research from Sydney University?\"\nLook, it's a fact that I did this interview with Cody over the phone but I am pretty sure I heard a raised eyebrow. Truth is, I did not know that. But I did rush off to interview Sharmilla Bargon who reveals that in research she did with colleague Regina Featherstone, 75 per cent of sexual harassment lawyers (from a sample of 145) had never settled a matter without a strict non-disclosure agreement.\nBargon says even they were surprised - particularly since they did the research a full year after the\nRespect at Work guidelines were released. So we had #metoo and then we had #timesup - but the fact is time is not up for sexual harassers. We are continuing to have cover-up culture.\nAnd worse, the findings revealed that 30 per cent of lawyers working for the victims and 50 per cent of lawyers working for the perps or the organisation said lawyers don't advise NDAs are optional. The lawyers didn't interrogate their usage, they just rolled out what they'd used before.\n\"We were shocked at those numbers,\" says Bargon.\nSpeaking of horrific numbers, Cody has some which will frighten you if you have any interest at all in making Australia safer in the future.\nThe commission is interviewing Australians about what they understand to be sexual harassment. And you'd think after all the publicity about safety and consent, after all the curriculum reform, after all the advocacy, young people would know all about this.\n\"What's staring us in the face is the lack of knowledge among young people, about what is sexual harassment, what their rights are,\" says Cody.\nThis depresses me. I tell her that it always irritates me when girls don't stand up for themselves in conversations about these matters. And she politely implies I've got a bit of internalised misogyny right there (as in, don't blame the victim). Which is a very good point although that doesn't make me any less grumpy.\nCody on the other hand is optimistic about the future for our daughters and our granddaughters, our sons and our grandsons.\n\"I do think there have been changes. There is at least an awareness within leadership of their responsibilities.\n\"Yes, there are absolutely further measures that need to be taken to ensure that work places are safer. But there is greater diversity within boards, and most organisations are training on these issues.\"\nREAD MORE:\nSpeaking of training, what advice does she have for the human resources sector who, in the experience of so many who've experienced harassment at work, do nothing more than back the bosses, reinforce the crappy values and do nothing to support the victims?\nThey need to take a compassionate and rigorous approach to anyone who comes to them having experienced sexual harassment, a rigorous approach to investigating it and ensuring that they have in place all of the policies all of the approaches which ensure that sexual harassment is eradicated in their organisation.\"\nAnd she reminds me that we now have in place positive duty legislation in this country, where employers have to ensure a safe workplace.\nYep, she's right. We were in a better place than we were 40 years ago but not the best place, nor the safest place, yet. Many of us are still silenced for life.\nDAILY\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.",

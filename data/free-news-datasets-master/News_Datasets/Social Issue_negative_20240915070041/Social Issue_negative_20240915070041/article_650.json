    "text": "A criminology student who threw beer over a police officer and kicked at riot shields at a riot in Liverpool following the deaths of three girls in Southport has been jailed. Liverpool Crown Court hear on Thursday that Gerard Cooch, 39, was one of &#039;hundreds&#039; who flocked to the centre of the city on August 3 to violently riot in the wake of the Southport stabbings, which were wrongly attributed to an immigrant by far-right groups. Cooch, who lives in nearby Bootle, was seen on CCTV and mobile phone footage, which was subsequently posted to YouTube and TikTok, making &#039;accusatory and hostile&#039; remarks and &#039;swearing and gesticulating&#039; in the area, where a line of police had formed a cordon near to Queen Square Bus Station. &#039;Intoxicated and angry&#039;, according to Nardeen Nemat, prosecuting, he then chucked a pint of beer over a cop and kicked riot shields twice, before being arrested an hour later. He told detectives that he had been attending a &#039;peaceful protest&#039;, but that the &#039;atmosphere became more hostile.&#039; Liverpool was one of many cities that saw far-right riots flare up in the wake of the Southport stabbings. Liverpool Crown Court hear on Thursday that Gerard Cooch, 39, (pictured) was one of &#039;hundreds&#039; who flocked to the centre of the city on August 3 to violently riot in the wake of the Southport stabbings Police officers and demonstrators clash during a protest against illegal immigration, in Liverpool, Britain, August 3, 2024 Police officers attend to a colleague after a face-off with protesters in Liverpool on August 3, 2024 during the &#039;Enough is Enough&#039; demonstration held in reaction to the fatal stabbings in Southport on July 29 Far-right agitators encouraged people to go to protests six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar tragically die at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on July 29. Suspect Axel Rudakubana, now 18, from Banks, Lancashire, was charged with three counts of murder following their deaths. Cooch, who admitted to drinking three cans of cider on the day, told the court that he &#039;regretted not removing himself from the area&#039; and was &#039;sorry for his involvement&#039; in the riots. The criminology student&#039;s previous convictions include threatening behaviour, drunk and disorderly behaviour, production of cannabis, possession of cocaine and MDMA and breaching a suspended sentence order. Stephen McNally, appearing on behalf of Cooch, said his client&#039;s display of violence at the riot could be partially explained by his ADHD. &#039;It is of great regret that the psychology of the crowd appears to have overborne his ordinary character on that day. His ADHD means he is very easily caught up in what goes on around him&#039;, McNally said. A protestor holds a placard during the Stand up to Racism rally at St George&#039;s Hall in Liverpool, Britain, August 3, 2024 Police officers try to restrain a protester in Liverpool on August 3, 2024 during the &#039;Enough is Enough&#039; demonstration held in reaction to the fatal stabbings in Southport on July 29 Riot police charge through the scooters laid by protestors in Liverpool, Britain, August 3, 2024 &#039;His own participation and involvement is limited, but it cannot be taken outside of the context. He is not somebody who has ever displayed any affiliation or sympathy to what might be described as far right tendencies. &#039;The court knows that there is an undercurrent. The background events in Southport appear to have been the catalyst behind subsequent events. They are particularly emotive. It may well be that, in that context, the court can accept his assertion that his original intention was to attend what he believed would be a peaceful protest. &#039;He did not take the opportunity to extricate himself from that locality. Instead, to his regret and the regret of his family, he let himself down and he let them down and one might say that he let down the other citizens of this city in how he conducted himself. &#039;At the very outset, he expressed remorse. References speak of a man who, despite his difficulties, has sought to better himself. This is a gentleman who is partway through a degree course in criminology and psychology. The irony of that will not be lost on the court, I am sure. &#039;Mr Cooch needed to take a break from his studies due to issues he was having, in the context of a series of untimely bereavements in the family. He lost his father, grandfather and another family member in a short space of time. He has had to work very hard to get back up to speed.&#039; Cooh admitted to a violent disorder charge, and was given 20 months in prison. Sentencing, Judge Brian Cummings KC said to Cooch: &#039;The incident occurred, plainly, in a busy public area. There is nothing on your record approaching the seriousness of what I am now dealing with. &#039;I accept that you have demonstrated a level of remorse. I accept that there have been some mental health factors in this case. There is plainly a better side to you.&#039;",

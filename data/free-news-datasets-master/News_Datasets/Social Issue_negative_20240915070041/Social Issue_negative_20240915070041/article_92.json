    "text": "As the two unfortunate Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that fell victims to atomic bombing in August 1945 by the US bringing the War to an end, the annual peace ceremonies held in the two cities every year in the past 79 years showed cracks this year as the administrators in both cities were not on the same page as both demonstrated differences in their respective invitee list with one inviting, and the other not inviting Israel presently in conflict in West Asia and destruction of Gaza. As a result, the conscience of the world that reiterates the resolve to eliminate this destructive arsenal from the earth received a setback.\nThe annual ceremonies held in August every year to mark the 1945 atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are occasions to mourn the victims, recall the devastation and resolve anew to never use nuclear weapons again. This was vitiated this year by deciding certain country not to invite for the ceremony. Here, Hiroshima and Nagasaki differed.\nUnlike Hiroshima, Nagasaki did not want the Israeli ambassador to attend the ceremony commemorating the 1945 atomic bombing. Deploring a ‘politicization’ of the event, Western countries chose not to send their ambassadors. That it took a political turn was indeed unfortunate.\nIn his traditional declaration for peace, Nagasaki Mayor Shiro Suzuki lamented the “uncertainty about when the Russian invasion of Ukraine will come to an end and growing concern about the expansion of armed conflicts in the Middle East,” and said that “we are currently facing a critical situation with the increased likelihood of the disappearance of the important norm that we have conformed to thus far,” namely, “never using a nuclear weapon again.” His speech in the sweltering heat of Peace Park was punctuated by verses by the poet Sumako Fukuda (1922-1974) a bomb survivor and anti-nuclear activist.\nWhile Nagasaki Mayor Suzuki decided not to invite Israel to the annual peace memorial ceremony, his counterpart in Hiroshima extended the usual invitation to the Israeli ambassador. Since 2022, Russia and Belarus have been left off the list in Nagasaki because of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine.\nThe solemnity of the occasion was thus overshadowed the controversy surrounding the preparations for the ceremony. In fact, as early as in June, Suzuki had raised the non-invitation of Israel issue. He made it official on 31 July, saying it was based on a hope for a “ceremony conducted smoothly under a solemn atmosphere.” The mayor denied any political motivation: “August 9 is the most important day of the year for the city of Nagasaki. The average age of survivors is now over 85,” explained the son of hibakushas (survivors). At the same time, Nagasaki invited the Palestinian Authority, which “is not a party to the conflict” between Israel and Hamas. The memory of the 1945 atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki fuels a powerful pacifist current in both cities. For months, the hibakushas had been pleading for Israel not to be invited to the commemorations. Suzuki just respected such prevailing sentiment.\nTo register their protest, the US and British ambassadors, Rahm Emanuel and Juli Longbottom, their colleagues from Germany, France, Italy and the EU, Canada and Australia also decided to stay out. The message was loud and clear: these countries openly announcing their support with Israel. To add fuel to the fire, Israel ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, reminded the Nagasaki Mayor that his country has been brutally attacked by terrorist organisations and by not sending an invite, the Mayor was sending “a wrong message to the world”. The popular Asahi Shimbun observed in an editorial that this “disheartening diplomatic gesture [has] seriously undermined the years of efforts to raise global engagement and dedication to the cause and lacks a convincing rationale.”\nSuzuki had the support of the 83-year-old head of the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Survivors Council, who justified the decision not to invite representatives from countries that were waging armed conflicts in defiance of calls from the international community. The remarks of some Israeli ministers against the adversaries in Gaza calling for retributions against Palestinian detainees and prisoners, if true, are condemnable but snubbing Israel by not inviting for a peace ceremony that entailed a message to the world to rid of nuclear weapons divides the world rather than unites in this noble mission.\nThough the decision to invite or not to invite to the ceremony certain country rests with the host city/country, in the present context, power politics surfaced as the US and the UK reacted negatively to Nagasaki’s decision. The Asahi Shimbun editorial observed that “equating Israel and Russia could lead to misunderstanding”.\nHere, the case of Israel’s retaliation to brutal attack on its citizens by the Hamas compared to Russia’s unprovoked and unilateral military operation in Ukraine is incomparable. May be the US, UK, the EC and other countries were miffed because of Israel’s non-invitation. Suzuki felt Israel’s reprisals against Hamas in Gaza caused massive civilian casualties, which the countries that skipped the peace ceremony overlooked and thus condoned. It is ironical that while the response of the uninvited countries to Israel’s ruthless military actions received little attention to humanitarian concerns and thus remained tepid, by boycotting the peace ceremonies, the US, UK, EU countries and others, as the Asahi Shimbun editorial observed, brought this ethical “double standards” to the A-bomb arena.\nThe moot question that begs an answer is: why did the Kishida government remain silent and failed to foresee the reaction that Israel’s exclusion would incur and found wanting in handling the issue appropriately? It was he who hosted the G-7 Summit in 2023 in Hiroshima, his home town, and encouraged world leaders to visit the atomic-bombed sites and the Hiroshima Peace Museum. Though Nagasaki municipal government took precautionary step by sending a letter in advance to Israel for its non-invitation, did Kishida not pre-empt such a decision would create an international controversy?\nIn this respect, Hiroshima’s handling the peace ceremony was more matured as it invited the Israeli ambassador to its ceremony on 6 August, despite requests from hibakusha groups to exclude Israel. In contrast, Nagasaki seems to have failed in sending the ceremony’s message of peace to the world appropriately.",

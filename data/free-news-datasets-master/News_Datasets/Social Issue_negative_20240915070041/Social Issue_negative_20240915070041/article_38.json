A military commandant’s office has been created which must ensure order and also all the needs of the local population,” Col-Gen Syrskyi said, in a written statement on his Telegram channel.\nREAD MORE HERE\nUS vice-presidential candidates agree to Oct debate The running mates of White House rivals Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have agreed to face off in at least one vice-presidential debate, accepting an invitation from CBS News for an Oct 1 showdown.\nCBS posted on Aug 14 on social media platform X that it had offered four potential debates in September and October to Democratic Minnesota governor Tim Walz and Ohio’s Republican senator J.D. Vance.\n“See you on Oct 1, JD,” Mr Walz replied, before the Harris campaign officially confirmed that it had accepted the date, which comes after early voting already started in several states.\nREAD MORE HERE\nTottenham suspend Bissouma over laughing gas video Embed Twitter Tweet URL Tottenham Hotspur have suspended midfielder Yves Bissouma for Spurs’ Premier League opener on Aug 19 at Leicester City after a video showing him inhaling nitrous oxide was posted on social media.\nThe 27-year-old apologised after last weekend’s incident involving the Class C substance also known as laughing gas.\n“He won’t be available on Monday.

    "text": "NEW DELHI: Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said the \\\"present rulers\\\" are spreading divisive thinking, and the observation of 'Partition Horrors Remembrance Day' is part of their intention to spread hatred. He said RSS promoted British power's policy of \\\"divide and rule\\\" out of self-interest, but is now lecturing Congress on freedom struggle.\\\"They mark 'Vibhajan Vibhishika Smriti Diwas' with the intention of spreading hatred. This is a historical fact that their politics of hate divided the country into two, the Partition happened because of them,\\\" he said.Kharge addressed the party workers after hoisting the national flag at the AICC office, which was attended by Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, KC Venugopal, Ajay Maken and other office-bearers.Congress alleged that Modi insulted Ambedkar by calling civil code \\\"communal\\\". Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh said, \\\"The non-biological PM's capacity for malice, mischief, and maligning of history knows no bounds. It was on full display today from Red Fort. To say we had a 'communal civil code' till now is a gross insult to Dr Ambedkar, who was the greatest champion of reforms in Hindu personal laws that became a reality by mid-1950s. These reforms had been bitterly opposed by RSS and Jan Sangh.\\\"Ramesh said Modi-appointed 21st law commission had in 2018 noted that \\\"UCC is neither necessary nor desirable at this stage. Most countries are moving towards recognition of differences and the mere existence of difference does not imply discrimination, but is indicative of a robust democracy.\\\"Kharge said while the Modi govt is in its 11th year, people's lives are becoming more dismal with joblessness, price rise, inequality and corruption. \\\"Govt is refusing to see the obvious because of its arrogance.\\\"",

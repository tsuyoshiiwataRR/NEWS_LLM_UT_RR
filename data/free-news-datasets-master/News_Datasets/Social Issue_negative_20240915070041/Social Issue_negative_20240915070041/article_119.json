[PCS] The newly appointed Education Cabinet Secretary Julius Migos is on the spot as crisis looms in the sector.\nThe two teachers' unions have called a nationwide strike when schools open for the third term in one week while university workers have also threatened to down tools in September.\nThe twin threats by sector players pose a threat to the smooth running of the education calendar but Migos has remained mum even as the unions dig in.\nOn Thursday, the Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) issued a seven-day strike notice, which could result in shut down of schools for the third term.\nThe lapse of the strike notice coincides with the school opening scheduled for August 26. .

Stay Informed, Stay Empowered: Download the Standard ePaper App!\nWith schools and universities set to reopen in the coming weeks, the CS must address the grievances to prevent a shutdown of the basic and higher education institutions.\nThe strike threats also pose a significant challenge to Migos, who must find a way to balance the demands of the teachers' unions with the government's financial constraints and the needs of students.\nWith a week left to reopen schools and a fortnight to reopen universities, the CS faces his first major challenge in the education sector.\nMisori on Thursday said that the union’s irreducible minimums include the immediate employment of intern teachers on permanent and pensionable terms effective 1 July 2024 and the recruitment of 20,000 teachers to address the huge deficit in JSS.\nHe revealed that the union will push for a post-graduate allowance for teachers who are holders of Master’s and PhD degrees irrespective of their positions in service.\"\nIf teachers make good their strike threat, it could have far-reaching consequences for students preparing for national examinations and assessments.\nKuppet and Knut have also accused TSC of failing to implement salary increments as agreed upon in the 2021-2025 CBA.\nThe unions have raised concerns over the teachers' medical coverage, the lack of progress in negotiations for a new CBA, and the government's failure to address the shortage of teachers in JSS.

    "text": "A day after the nationwide 'Reclaim the Night' demonstrations, protests in different parts of the country demanding justice for the woman trainee doctor who was raped and murdered at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital continued on Thursday.Hundreds of people joined resident doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi to protest against the brutal rape and murder of the trainee doctor. Protesters could be seen holding placards in solidarity with the rape victim doctor with heavy security arrangements in place, raising slogans seeking action and apt punishment for the guilty. The protesting doctors were also seen taking out a march outside AIIMS, holding their mobile phones high in the air with the torchlights of their devices on, as a mark of respect to the victim of the crime that took place in the West Bengal capital recently. The protesters were heard raising 'We want justice' slogans while taking out the march.Meanwhile, in Kolkata, actors from the Bengali film and TV industries also joined the doctors protesting outside the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital where the horrific crime took place. More protests are in store in Delhi as Resident Doctor's Associations decided to stage a protest march on Friday, August 16 from 2 pm at Nirman Bhavan, which houses the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.The decision was unanimous, which was taken at a comprehensive joint meeting conducted by the representatives of RDAs including AIIMS Delhi, Safdarjung Hospital and Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC).On Wednesday, protesters held a pan-India protest under 'Reclaim the Night' campaign. Besides Kolkata, cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, among others, saw large numbers of protesters, mostly women, taking to the streets to demand justice for the trainee doctor.Published By: Vivek Published On: Aug 16, 2024Must Watch",

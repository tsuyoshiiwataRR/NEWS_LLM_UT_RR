    "text": "New York City's migrant crisis costs soar past $5 billion City struggles with unprecedented influx as it houses and cares for nearly 200,000 migrants since mid-2022 New York City has spent over $5 billion managing an unprecedented surge of nearly 200,000 migrants since mid-2022, making it the most affected city in the nation as it grapples with the ongoing border situation, the Washington Examiner [reports](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/immigration/3120970/nyc-spending-biden-border-crisis-5-billion/). According to the city's Humanitarian Crisis Response Tracker, New York expended $4.8 billion from July to June in the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years. An additional $112 million has likely been spent since the start of fiscal 2025 on July 1, based on a recent [analysis](https://nypost.com/2024/01/16/metro/nyc-to-get-2-4b-for-migrant-crisis-in-hochuls-state-budget/) by the New York Post. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has fuelled the illegal immigration problem by announcing that he is helping to pay for bus tickets for migrants wishing to travel to Canada via Roxham Road. Rebel News is responding with a petition.— Rebel News (@RebelNewsOnline) MORE by [@ThevoiceAlexa]: [https://t.co/o2Rmq1eern] [pic.twitter.com/59wn5W9BmB] [March 28, 2023] The city's expenditures more than doubled in 2024, reaching $3.43 billion compared to $1.45 billion in 2023. Housing, rent, and initial outfitting costs accounted for the largest portion of spending at nearly $2 billion. Services and supplies cost an additional $1.9 billion, while information technology and administrative expenses totaled $488 million. The city also faced $345 million in food costs and $124 million in medical expenses. To accommodate the growing number of migrants, New York has established over 200 temporary shelters, including taking over several hotels at a cost of tens of millions of dollars. The city's Health and Hospitals Department and Department of Homeless Services were the largest spenders, collectively disbursing nearly $4 billion. Plattsburgh is a transient city where migrants disembark buses, including those from New York, and then hop into a taxi and towards the Canadian border.— Rebel News USA (@RebelNews_USA) FULL REPORT by [@ThevoiceAlexa]: [https://t.co/eoOEVtYarr] [pic.twitter.com/Vw8v2nqkPo] [March 1, 2023] Initially operating under its Right to Shelter law, which guaranteed a bed to anyone in need, the city has since imposed limits on how long people can stay in city-funded housing due to the overwhelming numbers. The surge in New York was partly driven by Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's initiative to provide free bus transportation for migrants from Texas border towns. Since April 2022, Texas has sent approximately 45,900 migrants to New York, about one-fifth of the total arrivals. Justin Trudeau brushes off New York sending illegal migrants to Roxham Rd, describing it as \"irregular migration\" and says Canada \"needs to make sure we're supporting people as they come through while discouraging them from doing that at the same time.\"— Rebel News Canada (@RebelNews_CA) [https://t.co/VIYRccnaoE] [pic.twitter.com/WZO6ivD41n] [February 22, 2023] While the number of migrants crossing the southern border has decreased significantly since its peak last December, cities across the country, including New York, continue to grapple with the long-term impact of this unprecedented influx. In September, New York City Council's minority leader Joseph Borelli testified before the House Homeland Security Committee, anticipating the city would spend $12 billion over three years to manage the crisis.

    "text": "A powerful typhoon continued its advance toward Tokyo and other eastern areas of Japan on Friday morning, with the weather agency urging people to prepare for strong winds and heavy rainfall, and transport operators canceling many train services and flights.\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency warned of violent winds, mudslides, high waves and flooding, as heavy rain will sharply increase the risk of disaster.\nAt 10 a.m. Friday, near the end of Japan's Bon summer holiday period, Typhoon Ampil was located some 100 kilometers east-northeast of Hachijo Island which sits south of the Japanese capital. The typhoon is moving northward at 20 km per hour, according to the weather agency.\nIt has an atmospheric pressure of 950 hectopascals at its center and is packing winds of up to 216 kph.\nJR Central suspended all Tokaido Shinkansen bullet train services between Tokyo and Nagoya, central Japan, for the entire day. Beyond Nagoya, the company plans to run a limited number of trains to and from Shin-Osaka via Kyoto in western Japan.\nJR East, which operates shinkansen in eastern, northeastern and central areas, will also cancel some bullet trains on parts of the Tohoku, Joetsu, and Yamagata lines from the afternoon.\nJapan Airlines and All Nippon Airways said they canceled approximately 650 international and domestic flights to and from Tokyo's Haneda airport and Narita airport, east of the capital, affecting about 120,000 passengers.\nIn Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo, some commercial complexes were closed, including the Sogo department store.\nIn the 24 hours from 6 a.m. Friday, the typhoon is forecast to bring up to 300 millimeters of rain to the Kanto-Koshin region, which includes Tokyo, 200 mm in the Tohoku region and 120 mm in the Tokai region.",

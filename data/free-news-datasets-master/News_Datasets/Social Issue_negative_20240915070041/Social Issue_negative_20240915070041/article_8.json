    "text": "As someone increasingly pessimistic about the world’s ability to mount the carbon dioxide-curbing effort necessary to stave off the worst impacts of global warming, I’m always heartened to talk to Senator Ed Markey, a relentlessly upbeat leader in the climate struggle.\nBut before we turn to Mr. Optimistic, let’s have a little gloom and doom. Long predicted, the dangerous effects of climate change have arrived in an unmistakable (and what would in a more rational nation be an undeniable) way. Much of the country now swelters under dangerous heat waves during summer. In mid-July, regions with upward of 135 million Americans were under heat alerts.\nAround the world, previous high-temperature records have toppled like candlepins in a bowling tournament. Heat-related causes killed more than 47,000 Europeans in 2023, according to a new study. Deaths from heat hit 2,300 in this country in 2023, up 34 percent from the previous year.\nDepressed? Well, here’s Markey with some good news as this country marks the second anniversary of the incentive-based climate law known as the Inflation Reduction Act.\nAdvertisement\n“This year, there is going to be 36,000 new megawatts of solar [electricity] installed in the United States, and 8,000 new megawatts of wind installed in the United States,” Markey said during a phone conversation. (Nationally, solar power is projected to be 58 percent of the total new electrical capacity added this year, according to the US Energy Information Administration. ) Markey’s office estimates that when that new solar and wind power is fully available, it will meet the electricity needs of more than 9 million households.\nThe IRA has now leveraged some $370 billion in private-sector investments, which accounts for the creation of some 335,000 clean energy jobs, the senator said, citing Climate Power.\nIndeed, renewable energy, and particularly solar, has taken strong enough root in red and purple states to begin to change the perspective of a GOP whose fossil fuel funding had long made it resistant to most things green. Last week, 18 House Republicans wrote to Speaker Mike Johnson opposing repeal of the energy tax credits in the IRA.\nAdvertisement\n“Energy tax credits have spurred innovation, incentivized investment, and created good jobs in many parts of the country — including many districts represented by members of our conference,” they declared.\nBut that is unlikely to deter Donald Trump’s aversion to renewable energy should he retake the White House.\nOn the campaign trail, Trump has vowed to target “all new spending grants and giveaways under the Joe Biden mammoth socialist bills like the so-called Inflation Reduction Act,” adding that “we’re going to save all that money.” According to The Washington Post, during an April fund-raiser with oil-industry executives, Trump promised to end much of the Biden administration’s green-energy agenda, taking particular aim at wind-generated energy and electric vehicles, and promising to bolster the fossil fuel industry. He then asked the petroleum panjandrums to raise $1 billion for his comeback effort.\nA man who considers climate change a hoax, Trump has adopted Sarah Palin’s energy slogan: Drill, baby, drill. He would again take the United States out of the Paris c limate agreement, which sets voluntary targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, keyed to a country’s level of development, capabilities, and emissions history. The United States, the largest emitter over time, has a more stringent voluntary-reductions schedule than do China and India. That gives conservatives agita, but it’s better to have a voluntary agreement with differentiated national targets than no agreement at all — at least for those who acknowledge the threat of human-caused global warming.\nFor his part, Markey offers a seize-the-future economic argument for the IRA’s tax credits, deductions, grants, and loans : With China trying to dominate the solar and wind energy, electric vehicle, and battery sectors, the IRA has given US producers a vital boost to help them compete.\nAdvertisement",

Observational studies cannot prove that one thing causes another, only that they are linked.\nPeople: This is a study based on research using people.\n***This media release contains information some readers may find distressing as it refers to data about mental health, suicide and self-harm. If you or anyone you know needs help, support is available now. Call Lifeline (Aus) on 131 114 or Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, or Lifeline (NZ) on 0800 543 354. ***\nInternational researchers say we should be paying closer attention to the spouses of people diagnosed with cancer, as they suggest a heightened risk for suicide among those affected. The team looked into the mental health of over 400,000 people whose spouse had been diagnosed with cancer, and compared them with over two million people whose spouse didn't have cancer. They say the former had an increased risk of suicide attempts, and dying due to suicide, and this was especially prevalent within the first year after a diagnosis.\nJournal/conference: JAMA Oncology\nLink to research (DOI):\n10.1001/jamaoncol.2024.3036\nOrganisation/s: Southern Medical University, China\nAttachments:\nNote: Not all attachments are visible to the general public\nNews for:\nInternational\nMedia contact details for this story are only visible to registered journalists.",

    "text": "Skip To... [The Bold and the Beautiful](https://thenerdstash.com/tag/the-bold-and-the-beautiful) heroine Hope Logan is a legacy character. As the daughter of the iconic vixen Brooke Logan, she’s the opposite of her mother. The young fashionista is the show’s good girl, who serves to be a role model for others. Although the character has her loyal fans, she’s drawn mixed reactions from [soap opera](https://thenerdstash.com/tag/soap-opera/) viewers. This past year, she’s undergone a huge personality transformation. When Hope began dating Thomas Forrester, it was a new beginning for her. She was no long the meek girl who let everyone control her life. She became more independent and stood up for herself, which viewers loved. However, her behavior following her breakup with Thomas doesn’t do the character any favors. Hope Logan is Pursuing a Married Man on The Bold and the Beautiful After Hope rejected another of Thomas’ marriage proposals, he decided to leave town. She was devastated for about five minutes before she [set her sights on another man](https://thenerdstash.com/the-bold-and-the-beautiful-creates-drama-with-finn-and-hope-romance/). She and John “Finn” Finnegan have become close as she sought his help with her migraines. Finn’s magic fingers have awoken feelings in Hope because she’s got a crush on the handsome doctor. However, there’s a problem. Finn is married to Hope’s longtime nemesis Steffy Forrester. Miss Logan and Miss Forrester have been [embroiled in a feud](https://thenerdstash.com/the-bold-and-the-beautiful-teases-twist-in-steffy-and-hope-feud/) for over a decade. The source of their rivalry consisted of fighting over Liam Spencer. But now the two women will be fighting again with Hope pursuing Steffy’s husband. This week Hope finally makes her move during a party at the Forrester mansion. A tipsy Hope gets Finn alone and kisses him, much to his shock. The Writing For the Character Doesn’t Make Sense The kiss not only horrified Finn, who put Hope on blast, but also fans. On a That scene with Finn is making Hope’s character going low into the dumpster. Another viewer wrote: I’ve never been a fan of Hope but they are ruining her and if I was one of her fans I’d be furious at what they’re doing to her. The storyline of her chasing after Finn is ridiculous and makes her character look awful. Finn hasn’t shown any romantic interest in her. The only thing he’s done is defend and praise her to Steffy, which increases Miss Logan’s infatuation. Although she told Brooke she wasn’t a homewrecker, her kissing Finn says otherwise. It seems evident she wants to break up Steffy and Finn’s marriage, but the question is why.

With the clothing brand losing money, Steffy wants to cut it, but Hope and Brooke won’t allow it. Perhaps stealing Finn is her way of getting back at Steffy for taking everything away from her. Another possibility is that Hope has a diagnosed medical condition. Her constant headaches seemed to foreshadow health issues, but the writers have pursued that angle. She could have a brain tumor or a mental disorder, which Finn or Taylor Hayes can help her with. First, there’s the question of if she loves Finn. When [Thomas returned briefly](https://thenerdstash.com/is-matthew-atkinson-leaving-the-bold-and-the-beautiful-again-after-just-returning-from-break/) to Los Angeles, she was ecstatic to see him and tried to reconcile. But when rejected, she turned her attention back to Finn. It’s obvious that Hope doesn’t know what she wants, and the writers don’t know what to do with her. The storyline with Finn is a bomb, making the character look unstable and creepy. Unless something drastic changes, it appears things are going to worsen for Hope.",

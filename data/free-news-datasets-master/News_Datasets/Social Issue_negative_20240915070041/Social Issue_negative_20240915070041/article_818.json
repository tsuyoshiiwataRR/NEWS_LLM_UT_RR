    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS â€” The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) is reminding residents about an increase in the number of pertussis, or whooping cough, cases across the state. \"Minnesota is experiencing a significant rise in pertussis cases with patients ranging in age from 1 months to 86 years and a median age of 15 years,\" said the MDH in a release. The department added that the increase is more pronounced among adolescents. The total number of cases reported as of Thursday is 516, with the largest single county contributor to that figure being Hennepin, which has reported 178 cases. Carver County reported 73 cases and Wright County reported 61. No other county in the state reported more than 30 cases. Pertussis is often undiagnosed because its symptoms overlap with other respiratory illnesses, said the MDH. \"Testing for pertussis should be considered in patients with a persistent or worsening cough of unknown origin lasting more than seven days, or any duration of cough if there has been close contact with a known case of pertussis,\" according to the report from the MDH.",

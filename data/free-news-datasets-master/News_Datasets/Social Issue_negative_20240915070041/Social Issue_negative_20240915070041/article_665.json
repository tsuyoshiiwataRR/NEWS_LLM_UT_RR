    "text": "The Cherokee County Public Library in Gaffney, South Carolina, is closed for maintenance after police say a man broke in, causing thousands of dollars worth of damage.The man police believe is responsible still has not been arrested.On April 3, around 4 a.m., library staff reported a break-in to police. Caught on surveillance, police are searching for Ashton Patrick James Deardorff. Police said Deardorff stole $100 in cash and caused thousands of dollars worth of damage.Library director Heath Ward said the library was closed about a week after the incident so they could clean and sanitize. “The individual appeared to have injured themselves, either entering the building or before they came in. They left a trail of blood throughout the entire building, he says. There was blood all over the carpet, all over some of the furniture, all over the cabinets, so the cleaning company came in and removed all the blood they could,\" Ward said. Ward said the blood on the carpet caused the most damage. As a temporary fix, they had to patch large pieces of the carpet. The library closed again on Aug. 9 and now they're closed for the next three weeks so it can be replaced. “In order to remove all of the carpet, we had to move all of the books and all of the furniture and shift those around the building is unable to be in there because we're unable to access those items right now,” he said.The library will remain closed until Sept. 3, but in the meantime people are being redirected to go to the Blacksburg library.",

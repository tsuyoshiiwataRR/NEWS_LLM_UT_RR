    "text": "“Shark Tank” co-star Kevin O’Leary said Vice President Kamala Harris has to distance herself from President Joe Biden in order for her economic policies to appeal to Americans.\nHarris took the stage with President Joe Biden in Maryland on Thursday, where they touted the administration’s effort to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. O’Leary said on Fox News’ “The Story with Martha MacCallum” that Harris must distance herself from Biden on the economy since polls have indicated his economic policies are unpopular.\n“What I was really listening for was if she was gonna center somewhere,” O’Leary said. “Because if the strategy is just bash big business, bash energy, bash Pharma, bash [US Aggregate Bond], bash everything, then she’s a leftist again, she can’t win the election. So my prediction is and we’ll know more next week after the convention, she has to get rid of Biden. I understand the heritage thing and everything, but she’s gotta distance herself from Bidenomics, that is radioactive waste for voters. So if she doesn’t bring some daylight in and go to the center, she’ll just lose.”\nKevin O’Leary Says Kamala Harris ‘Has To Get Rid Of Biden’ To Win Over Americans pic.twitter.com/hpoeT3wrz4\n— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) August 15, 2024\nHarris is reportedly intending to distance herself from Biden’s economic policies dubbed “Bidenomics,” which polls indicated has been a weak spot throughout his presidency, according to an Axios report on Wednesday. She is poised to announce her first major economic plan during a Friday rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, where she will reportedly propose a federal ban on supposed corporate “price-gouging” on food and groceries.

A poll by The Financial Times found on Aug. 12 that Harris edged Trump by 1 point, 42% to 41%, on the economy, despite nearly half of the respondents expressing disapproval of Biden’s economic policies.\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

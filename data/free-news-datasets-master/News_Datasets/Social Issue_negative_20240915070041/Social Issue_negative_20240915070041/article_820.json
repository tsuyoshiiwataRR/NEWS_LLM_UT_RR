    "text": "From the column: \"We stand at a critical juncture. The choices we make now could determine the fate of the Boundary Waters.\" Back in January, I wrote out a list of goals and projects to complete in 2024. Amid the humdrum litany of house repairs, my list included something of much greater and lasting appeal: paddle the entire length of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness from west to east along the historic Voyageur’s Highway that extends for 200 miles along the Canadian border. A few weeks ago, I completed this 2024 project of mine, starting at Crane Lake just west of the BWCAW and dropping my canoe into Lake Superior a week and half later. Time in the wilderness has many virtues, including simplifying life and clarifying priorities. My 11-day paddle had this effect on me. I returned from the Boundary Waters wilderness of crystal-clear lakes and towering pines renewed and refreshed. It also became clear to me during my time in the wilderness that, while the Boundary Waters is protected, it is far from safe. For over a century, generation after generation has had to stand up to protect this area. Roads, mining, logging, and other forms of irresponsible development have all threatened the Boundary Waters. Now, for well over a decade, we have been caught in a fight against proposed copper-sulfide mining at the edge of the wilderness. Operating one of these mines, which the EPA has listed as the most polluting industry in the country, close to a water-rich area like the Boundary Waters threatens an ecological — and human — disaster. ADVERTISEMENT The water level was very high during my time in the Boundary Waters, and the water was constantly moving over rapids and waterfalls and also through narrows where the water typically would not be visibly moving. The lakes, rivers, and streams are all interconnected. This very fact makes the Boundary Waters and the surrounding landscape uniquely vulnerable to copper-sulfide mining. The pollution from copper-sulfide mining would not stay still. Just as water flows throughout the Boundary Waters wilderness through a maze of lakes, rivers, and streams, so, too, could acid runoff from copper-sulfide mining flow through this intricate network of waterways, polluting countless acres of once-pristine water. Well, it turns out that I am not the only one who developed a project list. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C., prepared a blueprint for a next Donald Trump presidential administration, called Project 2025. On page 523, it calls for eliminating the current 20-year ban on copper-sulfide mining on approximately 225,000 acres of federal land near the Boundary Waters. This would clear the way for dangerous copper-sulfide mining projects that could pollute the wilderness. Although former President Trump has clumsily sought to distance himself from Project 2025, in his recent visit to Minnesota he stated he would remove this protection for the wilderness “in about 10 minutes.” The promised attacks on the Boundary Waters from Project 2025 and Trump are not isolated. There is a multi-prong effort to dismantle the protection of the Boundary Waters. Congressman Pete Stauber introduced a bill that would overturn the 20-year ban on copper-sulfide mining near the Boundary Waters and reinstate mineral leases to foreign mining conglomerates like the owners of Twin Metals, which have aggressively sought to open a toxic copper-sulfide mine at the edge of the BWCAW. Stripping away these crucial protections could be catastrophic for one of America's most cherished wild places. The Boundary Waters is more than just a recreational area; it's a national treasure that belongs to all Americans. Its value lies not just in its natural resources but in its ability to provide solace, adventure, and connection to nature. The Boundary Waters, as we know it, did not just happen. It took generations of people to stand up to logging and mining interests and to speak up for the people who have been touched by this special place. If we fail to continue this legacy, the Boundary Waters could be lost. We stand at a critical juncture. The choices we make now could determine the fate of the Boundary Waters. Project 2025 poses a dangerous step backward, one that could lead to the irreversible destruction of this unique wilderness. Let’s add to our project list to stop Project 2025 from being implemented.

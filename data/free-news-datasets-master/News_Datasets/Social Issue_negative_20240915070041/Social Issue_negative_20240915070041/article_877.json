    "text": "WASHINGTON (TND) — A class action lawsuit has revealed details about an alleged data breach that involved almost three billion pieces of personal data, including Social Security numbers, names, and addresses. According to the suit filed in the Southern District of Florida, plaintiff Christopher Hoffman, a California resident, received a notification from an identity theft protection service in late July that his personal data had been compromised and found on the Dark Web because of a breach of the Florida-based background check company National Public Data by the cybercriminal group USDoD. Hoffman didn't even know National Public Data had his personal information. The lawsuit's claims suggest there are millions of people like him. The lawsuit, which was filed earlier this month, claimed the data was unencrypted and “compromised, published, and then sold on the Dark Web, due to Defendant's negligent and/or careless acts and omissions and their utter failure to protect customers’ sensitive data.” National Public Data did not respond to Sinclair's request for comment. McAfee Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer Steve Grobman said it's difficult to know exactly how many people have been impacted by the alleged theft of almost three billion pieces of data because there are only about 330 users in the United States, 41 million in Canada and 68 million in the United Kingdom. Exactly the nature of that data is what makes up whether or not a breach is critical, but from what we know, there is important information. It's things like Social Security numbers, current (and) former employers and addresses. So all of that information can be used by cybercriminals to take advantage of these victims,\" Grobman said. What was valuable to these hackers, Grobman said, was that all this data was in the same place. To make matters worse, National Public Data allegedly didn't notify victims of the breach or self-report the incident to any state attorneys general, which, according to McAfee, is standard practice under current laws and regulations. \"Third-party breach notification services like McAfee are in the process right now of going through the data and notifying impacted consumers,\" Grobman said. \"If any organization out there is aware that it had their data breached, taking responsibility to inform impacted consumers is really important and from what we're seeing on this one, it doesn't appear that that happened.\" If an individual is concerned about their personal data, experts like Grobman suggest they sign up for a credit monitoring service, keep an eye out for suspicious activity on credit cards, and consider freezing credit. Being aware of how personal data–however harmless it may seem, like the name of a former employer–can be used against you in a phishing or fraud scheme is also critical.",

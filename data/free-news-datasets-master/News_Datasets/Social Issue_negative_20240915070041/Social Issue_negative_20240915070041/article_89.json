    "text": "Another week, another article about the Great MAGA spinoff of Trump’s field operations. These Republican SuperPACs are said to plan on spending hundreds of millions of dollars to knock on hundreds of thousands of doors in the same Swing States where Hope Springs from Field PAC [website] has been operating. Those readers who regularly follow my posts know that i write about the evidence in MAGA canvassing that Hope Springs volunteers find as their are knocking on doors each week. But it is of interest (at least to me) the kind of press that these MAGA SuperPACs are getting. ”The Trump campaign’s effective takeover of the Republican National Committee has come with a new approach to on-the-ground canvassing efforts: doing more with less.” “The Republican campaign for president is quietly being remade by new federal guidelines that empower big-money groups and threaten to undermine party control well beyond the 2024 election.” It’s a unique — and untested — approach: Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is relying on a cluster of loosely coordinated outside groups to run turnout operations traditionally performed by the campaign itself, an approach that takes advantage of new leniencies in campaign finance rules but comes with the risk of untested outfits duplicating efforts or working at cross purposes. With fewer than 100 days before the election, local GOP officials in battleground states have raised alarms about the scant presence of Trump campaign field staff. For the large armies of paid and volunteer door-knockers and canvassers who typically drive turnout in presidential elections, the campaign is largely relying on outside groups such as America First Works, America PAC and Turning Point Action.

For the large armies of paid and volunteer door-knockers and canvassers who typically drive turnout in presidential elections, the campaign is largely relying on outside groups such as America First Works, America PAC and Turning Point Action. Hope Springs from Field has been tracking MAGA canvassing operations for the past 3 years. Periodically, i’ve reported what we find in our Saturday canvasses here. But we don’t have the same target audiences, and it is not that frequent that our canvassers actually run into their’s. For example, i am told that in Wisconsin, while we seem to share the WOW counties, there are more MAGA canvassers north of the Milwaukee area. In Florida, we haven’t had any contact in our Osceola, Orange and Seminole county canvassing, but we have in our Jacksonville area canvasses (and, to a far lesser extent, Miami area canvasses). But these spin-offs seem to also be driven by Trump’s “frugality,” his desire to spend as little of “his money” as possible (and we all know how expansive his definition of “his money” is). This transformation is a consequence of a surprise decision by the Federal Election Commission earlier this year that allows campaigns to coordinate their canvassing efforts with outside groups like super PACs. The change means that campaigns can outsource much of their costly ground game to entities that can take unlimited donations and raise money at a much faster clip. [...] What is new is that for the first time those two entities [party entities & SuperPACs] can share voter targets, scripts and perhaps even office space, allowing campaigns and like-minded outside groups to work hand-in-glove in more cost-effective ways.

Look, Democrats benefit by these rules changes, as well. When the Biden campaign requested some additions to what Hope Springs was doing in these Swing States, one reason why they could legally do so was because of the changes. Lawyers weren’t needed to navigate the conversation. Republicans have seized on this change much more aggressively than have Democrats. A few weeks after the F.E.C. issued its advisory opinion, the Trump team and its lawyers invited outside groups to Mar-a-Lago to begin talks about how to coordinate responsibility for get-out-the-vote efforts, according to three people close to the campaign who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the meeting was private. The new guidance was especially valuable for Mr. Trump, who ended the Republican primary season at a serious cash disadvantage relative to the Democrats. Outside entities could take the lead on door knocking, allowing the campaign to focus on areas where it could be more cost effective, such as television and mail. Mr. Blair has claimed that these outside groups have more than 1,000 paid canvassers in the field and that there would likely be more than 2,500 by the time voting begins. Turning Point, which set out to raise $108 million for the effort, now has “multiple hundreds” of paid full-time staffers in each of Arizona and Wisconsin and will soon have that in Michigan said a group spokesman, Andrew Kolvet. [...] Another group, called Turnout for America, has been encouraging donors to contribute to its own $45 million plan to deploy 945 paid canvassers in seven battleground states, according to a memo reviewed by The New York Times. The group, led by Chris Buskirk, a close friend of Senator JD Vance, Mr. Trump’s running mate, describes its role as effectively a substitute for the campaign’s field operation itself.

But our model is definitely different: Past experiments with outsourcing field operations, most notably Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s heavy reliance on a super PAC in the Republican presidential primary race, have wound up as expensive boondoggles. With the legal barriers now removed, the current effort will test how much the rules — as opposed to structural or personal dynamics — contributed to the challenges. It will also test how a novel approach stacks up against the Democratic ground effort, which is using more traditional methods.

Hope Springs from Field PAC began knocking on doors again on March 2nd to set up a favorable “battle space” or foundation for Democrats in 2024. We target Democrats and unaffiliated voters with a systematic approach that reminds them not only that Democrats care, but Democrats are determined to deliver the best government possible to all Americans. The voters we talk to in these 12 Swing States tell us they come away more invested in governance and feel more favorably towards Democrats in general because of our approach. Obviously, we rely on grassroots support, so if you support field/grassroots organizing, voter registration (and follow-up), GOTV and our efforts to protect our voters, we would certainly appreciate your support: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/hopemobilization2024 Hope Springs from Field understands that volunteer to voter personal interactions are critical. Knocking on doors has repeatedly been found to be the most successful tactic to get voters to cast a ballot and that is the goal of what we do. For the first time (iirc), the promised Turning Point Action field operation, which claims it will “hire hundreds of local full-time organizers in the critical battleground states of Arizona, Wisconsin and Michigan, aiming to build a permanent campaign infrastructure on par with what Democratic-aligned groups have developed in recent decades,” was the most active MAGA group we found. The Koch groups, Americans for Prosperity and the Libre Initiative, were the second busiest MAGA canvassing groups we found out there this week. America First Works was also tied in second with them. Most of what we found were door hangers left behind, much of it in gutters (probably flown off of doors). This week (again), we found no evidence of Trump Force 47 canvassers. There was a flurry of canvassers deemed TF47 around the convention, but. The party says its get-out-the-vote effort, dubbed “Trump Force 47,” is driven by a dedicated army of volunteers. It has been shrouded in secrecy since it launched earlier this year, raising questions in political circles about the ground-game strategy to support Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Behind the scenes, campaign strategists have been revamping what they viewed as an inefficient, bloated and antiquated Republican ground-game model.

If you are interested in prior MAGA canvassing evidence, you can check out the earlier diaries here and here and here and here and here. Veteran campaign organizers are also aghast at the money that some super PACs intend to spend, skeptical that outside organizations will be able to quickly build big enough canvassing operations in a tight labor market, no matter how big the budget. [...] Canvassers are typically paid minimum wage or close to it, and the paid-canvassing industry is shrouded with concerns about fraudulent data. Staff turnover is constant. Mr. Warren also said there is a downside to effectively relying on mercenaries who are not as invested in the political movement — and sometimes are not even Republicans. For example, a paid canvasser might not wait more than 15 seconds for a voter to come to the door, but a passionate volunteer would. “The sell is an engaged canvasser who’s going to talk to the voter with whatever their pitch is,” Mr. Warren said. “That’s what makes it effective.” Veteran campaign organizers are also aghast at the money that some super PACs intend to spend, skeptical that outside organizations will be able to quickly build big enough canvassing operations in a tight labor market, no matter how big the budget.

Volunteers choose whether or not they want to engage with people canvassing on the other side, and we have experienced Republican canvassers who were not interested in engaging. Several of our volunteers have reported that MAGA canvassers smiled when they were asked, saying “we just want to keep you from taking our lit off the doors.” Remember, our model is to cede areas and volunteers when presidential or senate campaigns start operating there. I always say, “we don’t compete,” but it is more than just that. We are replicating 1st and 2nd round canvassing in the old 5 round model. Campaigns are doing persuasion, taking requests for yard signs, etc, with their canvasses, so it is natural to let them take over. We’ll continue to concentrate on areas that aren’t covered. Kanninen said the campaign is rapidly expanding an already large network of Biden-Harris field offices and volunteers across the battleground states. He said that there were 600 staffers “on the ground in the blue wall,” and that 150 more would be added by mid-August. Aides also planned to double the size of the campaign’s teams in Arizona and North Carolina, and were opening new field offices in Georgia.

Aides also planned to double the size of the campaign’s teams in Arizona and North Carolina, and were opening new field offices in Georgia. A little explanation, these numbers represent what 57 volunteers saw last weekend. When volunteers start to come across MAGA lit or canvassers, they tend to come across more — they are walking the same area as the conservative activists. So if a volunteer sees multiple sightings of canvassers from the same group, it is still recorded as a single event. When multiple volunteers find evidence in the same canvassing area, that is also recorded as a single event. AFAIK, Hope Springs from Field is the only Democratic or Progressive group on the ground week in and week out, year in and year out, as weather allows, do this. In fact, that was one of the biggest reasons why Obama alums came together to create what we envisioned to be a pop-up PAC for the Georgia Senate runoffs. There are a number of MAGA or conservative orgs who have done (and are doing) the same thing for years (even decades) before Hope Springs began. But that makes us uniquely able to judge the MAGA ground game. Still, running into another group of canvassers is pretty rare. We have different target or walk lists. When we find evidence that we are knocking on the same doors, we always note that because that is the very definitely of a swing voter. Some of the evidence that volunteers bring back to organizers is not actually Saturday evidence but from the weekdays. It is one of the differences between MAGA canvassers and our Hope Springs volunteers: the MAGA canvassers we have encountered have all been paid canvassers. Now there are Democratic orgs that pay canvassers (Fair Fight, for example). That’s just not what we do (at this time). But we had 11,442 volunteers knocking last Saturday. 57 instances of MAGA canvassing has to be put into that context. As of yet, we haven’t talked to an unaffiliated voter who was willing to share an interaction with a MAGA canvasser. Yet. Hope Springs has targeted states that have competitive Senate races and/or the Electoral College in 2024, as well as districts that are remapped in ways that offer opportunities or vulnerabilities for Democrats next year (specifically those where a Republican won a Congressional District that voted for Biden in 2022). But that’s where the MAGA canvassers are, as well. There is a lot of work to be done!

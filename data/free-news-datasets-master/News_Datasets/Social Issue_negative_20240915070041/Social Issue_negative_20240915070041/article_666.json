    "text": "HOUSTON – Houston, we hear your pain and your concerns.\nThis year alone, some Houstonians were left without power and air conditioning for days on end not once, but twice. First with the May derecho and then again in July with Hurricane Beryl.\nCenterPoint Energy to hold 16 open house events for customer feedback across Houston area Needless to say, it’s been a trying year.\nRightfully so, some people are a little nervous or borderline anxious about the “what ifs” when it comes to their electricity.\nWhether it’s CenterPoint’s drive to restore trust in their customers to the ERCOT grid or will there be enough electricity supply to power all of our homes, there are real thoughts on the minds of Houstonians.\nWhat work has CenterPoint Energy completed since launching its resiliency initiative? But the problem is - some people might be getting bad information or be worrying about the wrong thing.\nDemand vs. Capacity There’s been a lot of talk about an all-time record amount of power usage on the ERCOT grid, which manages how electricity is distributed throughout most of Texas.\nThe record was set on August 10, 2023 when Texans used 85,508 MW (megawatts) of electricity.\nWe could very well break that record this year.\nBut here’s the thing - it doesn’t matter.\nCenterPoint Energy to hold 16 open house events for customer feedback across Houston area As Texas continues to grow and our climate warms, we will always demand more and more power, continuously breaking the previous record.\nWhat you should focus on is the Committed Capacity and the Current Demand. The capacity is how much electricity in the grid that we can use while the demand is what we’re currently using.\nAs long as the demand doesn’t come close to the capacity, we should be in good shape, regardless of whether or not we reach the all-time demand record.\nIs The Infrastructure Healed? That’s a little bit of a different story.\nCenterPoint Energy is responsible for handling the transmission and distribution lines in the Houston area.\nThey took not one, but two big wallops by Mother Nature.\nThe punches keep coming from Houstonians, who are demanding the company do better after being stranded without power and AC for days on end during the May derecho and Hurricane Beryl.\nAccording to CenterPoint, they’re almost halfway to their goal of making their system more resilient to storms in the immediate future.\nThey’re making progress with trimming vegetation, replacing poles with newer, stronger poles and “hardening” distribution lines. However, there’s still work to be done.\nDon’t Be A Part Of The Problem There are things you and I can do to help keep Texas out of a situation that would require rolling blackouts.\nWe’re talking about the easy things that you’ve probably heard so many times that it’s numb to you.\nRaising the temperature in your house, just for a few hours Holding off on using big power-hungry appliances Turning off lights when you’re not using them Copyright 2024 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.",

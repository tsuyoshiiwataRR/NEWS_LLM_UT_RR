    "text": "This year saw the most cases of pneumonia among children in the past five years. If in other summers a few children with such pathology would come to the hospital, now their number has increased by 30 percent. Doctors are warning that hospitals are full, and this is because many children are returning from holidays after being exposed to various viruses that are dangerous for immunity.\nTen days ago, Viorica Spânu with her daughter Patricia took the bus from Milan to return to the Republic of Moldova. The next day, Patricia had a fever, and as soon as they reached the Râscani area, they went to the doctor. For several days, mother and daughter were admitted to the hospital, as the teenager was diagnosed with pneumonia.\nFor many children, the first day was the most difficult, with a very high fever.\nDoctors say that the little ones are the most vulnerable to pneumonia, especially children from one to eight years old.\nRODICA OVCEARENCO, head, intensive care, Municipal Children’s Hospital number 1: “Even if it is summer and the children are not in groups now, but the children with their parents are resting abroad, they have contact with children from other regions, and this is probably the reason why many viruses and bacteria are known.”\nALIONA ROTARI, director, Municipal Children’s Hospital No. 1: “Pneumonia is a real pathology and when a doctor’s help is needed, I would ask parents not to hesitate to call 112. It is true that in the five years we have not registered a greater number of patients were sent to the emergency department. In the last period we have more serious and severe pneumonia than in previous years.”\nExperts recommend parents to contact the family doctor about the first symptoms of the child’s illness and not to use self-medication. At the same time, doctors are urging parents to vaccinate their children against the flu.\n2024-08-15 17:14:00\n#Children #increasingly #affected #pneumonia",

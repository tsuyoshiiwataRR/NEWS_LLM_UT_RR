    "text": "Police announced the arrests made in connection with the May shooting death of the former \"General Hospital\" actor, Johnny Wactor, Thursday afternoon.\nLater in the day, the Los Angeles Police Department identified the suspects as 18-year-old Robert Barceleau, 18-year-old Leonel Gutierrez, 18-year-old Sergio Estrada and 22-year-old Frank Olano.\nBarceleau, Gutierrez and Estrada have been booked for murder. Officers booked Olano as an accessory to the crime.\nEach will be held in lieu of a $2 million bond.\n\"I want to thank LAPD for their partnership and hard work on this case and for their continued efforts to keep Angelenos safe and to bring justice to victims of violence,\" Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement. \"Now, we must ensure that those who are responsible for this brazen and heinous act are held fully accountable.\"\nThe arrests come just days after Wactor's friends and family gathered at a downtown Los Angeles news conference to plead for the public's help in finding the person or people responsible for the actor's death.\n\"I was very excited but cautiously optimistic,\" the actor's mother, Scarlett Wactor, said after hearing about the arrests. \"We still have to do preliminary hearings.\"\nThe former \"General Hospital\" star, 37, was fatally shot on May 25 in downtown Los Angeles. He had just finished his bartending shift and was walking to his car on Hope Street and Pico Boulevard when he was shot and killed by suspects as they were attempting to steal his catalytic converter.\nA little over a week ago, LAPD detectives released still security images of three suspects and a vehicle in connection with Wactor's killing as they renewed their calls for information.\nFrustration had been building among Wactor's family, friends and community members as months went by without any information about the three suspects, leaving the killing unsolved.\nIn June, Wactor's friend, Micah Parker, led a march in downtown Los Angeles to raise awareness of his friend's death.\n\"We want anyone with any information to come forward,\" Parker said.\nThe group started their march near the shooting scene and continued to Los Angeles City Hall, where they spoke out against violence and crime in L.A.\n\"We want our city leaders, the mayor, the [district attorney], city council to at least admit that we have a problem so that we can address it and move forward with safer streets,\" Parker said.\nOne of the suspects, Olano, had one prior conviction before the deadly shooting. He received a sentence of probation for felony vandalism during Wactor's death.\nBefore being booked for Wactor's death, police arrested Gutierrez for felony vandalism on July 19.\nBarceleau was arrested twice after the alleged murder: once 11 days after the shooting for an assault with a deadly weapon involving a semi-automatic rifle and another time in July for a misdemeanor.\nHe was cited and released for the misdemeanor and released on bond for the assault with a deadly weapon charge.\nWactor's mother expressed her frustration after hearing about the previous arrests.\n\"These guys are too brazen,\" Scarlett Wactor said. \"The law has enabled them to just be like they're above it ... I'm so grateful and thankful and hope that those previous things that they were arrested for maybe they can be stacked on top of what is happening now.\"\nShe hopes the prosecutors advocate for the harshest penalties.\n\"They're getting a chance at life that he doesn't have,\" Scarlett Wactor said. \"They're breathing air that they don't deserve to breathe ... If the death penalty was available, that'd be fantastic, in my opinion.\"\nMore from CBS News Friends and family of the late Johnny Wactor call for justice and improved safety in Los Angeles Man shot to death in Glendale shopping center parking lot Man shot to death outside of liquor store in Hawthorne LAPD releases footage from deadly police shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Investigators searching for four suspects after shooting in Norwalk Julie Sharp Julie Sharp is a digital producer at CBS Los Angeles.

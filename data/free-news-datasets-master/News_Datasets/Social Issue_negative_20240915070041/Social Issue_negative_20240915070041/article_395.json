    "text": "Shocking Stats Reveal Churchgoers’ Knowledge of the Old Testament\nThe Bible’s interwoven narrative is essential to understanding God’s redemptive plan for humanity, but not everyone who goes to church has\nproper awareness, particularly when it comes to Old Testament stories.\nAccording to\nnewly released data from LifeWay Research, more than one-in-10 (11%) of Protestant churchgoers accidentally offer a New Testament story when asked to share their favorite Old Testament narrative, showcasing a notable level of confusion among some believers. Get your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today! Stay up-to-date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more!\nIn addition to that statistic, 7% offer no story and 3% simply don’t know.\nThis accounts for a relatively sizable percentage of people who are in churches yet remain unfamiliar with how the Bible is\ndivided, presented, and intertwined.

Subscribe to Charisma on YouTube now!\n“While churchgoers may open a Bible at church, at least 1-in-5 may not be familiar with how it’s organized and what distinguishes the New Testament from the Old Testament,” Scott McConnell, executive director of Lifeway Research, said in a statement.\nHe continued, “Some of these attendees may have spent\nless time in the Bible while others may not know the Bible for themselves, because someone else has always been their GPS for navigating it.”\nTo read the full story,\n visit our content partners at Faithwire.\nReprinted with permission from faithwire.com.

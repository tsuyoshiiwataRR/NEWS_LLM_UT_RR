    "text": "3 hours ago User-posted content NJDOL Assesses New Brunswick Landscaping Company $38K in Back Wages to Five Workers. Photo by Morristown Minute VLD Landscaping L.L.C. was cited for multiple labor law violations, including failure to pay overtime and improper employee classification. NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. - The New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development (NJDOL) has ordered VLD Landscaping L.L.C. of New Brunswick to pay $38,055.83 in back wages, penalties, and fees after an investigation by the Division of Wage and Hour Compliance uncovered several labor law violations affecting five employees.\nThe violations included failing to pay overtime, improper record keeping, unpaid or late payment of wages, violations related to Earned Sick Leave records, and misclassification of employees. The total assessment includes $28,927.50 in unpaid overtime, a 5% misclassification penalty of $9,128.33, and $22,555.58 in penalties and administrative fees.\n“ These violations serve as a stark reminder of why New Jersey’s labor laws exist, and this department will not tolerate any dishonest actions that undermine them ,” said Labor Commissioner Robert Asaro-Angelo . “ Our state continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to ensuring the fair treatment of workers, and NJDOL will hold violators accountable to the fullest extent of the law .” The investigation was initiated following a complaint filed by the advocacy group New Labor on behalf of the five affected workers. During the investigation, it was revealed that VLD Landscaping paid its workers in cash without proper deductions, and employees worked only two to three days a week. The company's owner, Israel Ramirez Lopez, was unable to provide the necessary documentation when subpoenaed to appear at NJDOL headquarters in Trenton.\nThe NJDOL’s findings underscore the importance of compliance with state labor laws, which are designed to protect workers' rights and ensure fair compensation. The owner of VLD Landscaping was provided with New Jersey’s Employer’s Guide to Wage and Hour Laws to help prevent future violations.\nThe work conducted by VLD Landscaping involved routine lawn maintenance on commercial and residential properties. The NJDOL’s action serves as a reminder that all employers must adhere to labor laws, including proper wage payment and classification practices.\nFor more information on worker benefits and protections, visit myworkrights.nj.gov .\nFor updates, subscribe to our free newsletter!

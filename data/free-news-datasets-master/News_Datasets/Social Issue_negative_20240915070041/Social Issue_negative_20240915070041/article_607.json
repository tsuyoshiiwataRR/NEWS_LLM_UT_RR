    "text": "Tim Walz Is Vice President Of Calling Tommy Tuberville Dumb As Dog Dicks\nIt will be one of his main duties.\nYou are not ready for how vice presidential nominee Tim Walz is about to\nsteal your heart (again).\nTim Walz said at a fundraiser in Boston last night, “I feel like one of my roles in this now is to be the anti-Tommy Tuberville, to show that football coaches are not the dumbest people.”\nWhen we heard it we laughed for a good 30 seconds.\nDon’t just sit there laughing, give Wonkette money by becoming a paying subscriber!\nIt’s clear that Tim Walz,\njust by being who he is, is getting deeply under MAGA men’s very thin and delicate skin. But OPE! these zangers and bangers!\nAnd now this former coach, who Kamala Harris regularly refers to as “Coach Walz,” is openly calling Tommy Tuberville, who\nprefers to be referred to as “coach,” the absolute moron that he is.\nWe just wish we could have watched him deliver the line. You know how he gets when he says a funny.\nTommy Tuberville is well-known in America as the dumbest, most inbred cowfuck in the whole entire Senate, and probably the entire South and probably the entire US and A.\nHe mercilessly stole the title of Senate’s Dumbest Republican from Wisconsin’s Ron Johnson, and he’s been cuddling it in his arms like a prize-winning poo, even as all the other children are yelling “Flush it, Tommy! Flush it!”\nHe thought Russia invaded Ukraine because Russia is communist and it needed Ukraine’s farmland to feed its people. Don’t worry, though, he quickly shifted course and became the\nKremlin’s dumbest senatorial cumsock mouthpiece. He thought his brave Daddy fought in WWII to “liberat[e] Paris from socialism and communism.”\nAt one point he was under the impression the three branches of the US government were the \"House, the Senate and Executive.\"\nHe called the cops because the former director of the CIA made fun of him on Twitter.\nShould white nationalists be allowed to serve in the military?\nTubs didn’t call them that, said Tubs. He called them “Americans.”\nRemember that time\nhe spent a year stupidly skullfucking American military readiness by holding up all the military promotions, because he was having a poopy in his pants about President Biden’s policy on abortion in the military? When he caved, he caved in exchange for nothing.\nTuberville is, quite simply, the stupidest PE major ever to escape from a locker room.\nPREVIOUSLY ON THIS PUD!\n·\nTommy Tuberville Steals 'Senate's Dumbest Republican' Trophy, Flings It In Own End Zone\nhttps://www.wonkette.com/p/tommy-tuberville-vying-for-senates-dumbest-republican-prob-manage-to-lose-that-to-vanderbilt-too\nTommy Tuberville Vying For Senate's Dumbest Republican, Prob Somehow Lose That To Vanderbilt Too\nhttps://www.wonkette.com/p/2023-the-year-tommy-tuberville-fucked\n2023: The Year Tommy Tuberville Fucked The Military And Saved Zero (0) Unborned Babies, What A Dumbass\nhttps://www.wonkette.com/p/tommy-tubervilles-babbling-alabama\nTommy Tuberville’s Babbling Alabama Translations Of Russian Propaganda Are The Duolingo Course Literally Nobody Asked For\nOn top of all of that, Tommy Tuberville is a guy who looks as stupid as he is inside, a guy you literally can’t draw a caricature of because you couldn’t possibly make him look stupider than he is. The caricature is just his literal face.\nAnd though Wonkette is the official governing body that controls and grants the title of Senate’s Dumbest Republican, we are\nfar from the only entity to notice that Tuberville is as stupid as he is and use it as the basis for entire articles.\nAnd now here comes dear Tim Walz, declaring that one of his roles right now is to show Americans that not all football coaches are dumb mouthbreathing pigfucks like Tommy Tuberville.\nGod bless him.\nBy the way, inbreds and degenerates who are stupid as Tuberville are in the comments of Igor Bobic’s tweet above, saying things like “DUUUUUUURRRRRRRR WHICH SEC TEAM DID TIM WALZ COACH?”\nAs if there’s some kind of long tradition that says SEC coaches are inherently intelligent men.\nIn related vice presidential news,\nnew audio came out yesterday where JD Vance, Donald Trump’s embarrassment of a running mate, agreed with a podcast host that “the whole purpose of the postmenopausal female” is to help raise children, and that that grandmotherly child-rearing is \"weird, unadvertised feature of marrying an Indian woman.\"\nWe’ll have a whole ‘nother post on that on Wonkette later this morning.\nSo that is your news of the two vice presidential candidates.\nOh, also that\nWalz has agreed to debate Vance on October 1. Vance hasn’t agreed yet. But Walz says he plans to use the time to fuck Vance up about Project 2025.\nHopefully Vance can get unstuck from the couch and show up.\n<a href=\"https://x.com/HeartlandSignal/status/1823811043375907296\">video via\n[Heartland Signal</a>]\nEvan has a new side project called\nThe Moral High Ground, you should check it out and subscribe there too!\nFollow Evan Hurst on Twitter\nright here.\n@evanjosephhurst on Threads!\nIf you're shopping on Amazon anyway, this portal gives us a small commission.",

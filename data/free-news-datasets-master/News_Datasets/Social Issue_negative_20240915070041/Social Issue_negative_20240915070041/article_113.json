    "text": "On the occasion of Minorities Day (August 11), President Asif Ali Zardari said that minorities in Pakistan enjoy all political, economic and social rights. These are hollow words and fly in the face of reality. In Sindh, the stronghold of the PPP and under its uninterrupted rule for the last 15 years, the state of minorities is pitiable. Issues like forced conversion and marriage of women belonging to religious minorities endure. In Punjab, Christians and other minority groups have faced recurring cases of mob attacks on their homes, businesses and places of worship. Not taking decisive action against extremist elements who openly spread venom against minorities has also made the environment for minorities extremely difficult. It would have been advisable for the president and PM to admit to the state’s failure to protect the rights of minorities because when the existence of the issue is brushed under the carpet, finding a solution is impossible.

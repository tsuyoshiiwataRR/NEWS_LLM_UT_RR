    "text": "In response to a surge in COVID-19 cases, the Regional Trial Courts in Western Visayas swiftly reinstated strict face mask requirements for all employees, lawyers, and clients entering courthouses.\nThe policy aims to curb the virus’s spread, particularly in Iloilo City, where cases are rising.\nAccording to the Morbidity Week 33 report from the Iloilo City Health Office, the city recorded 276 confirmed COVID-19 cases, including two new ones. Of these, 19 cases remain active, while 243 have recovered. The city also reported 14 deaths linked to the virus.\nThe directive, outlined in Memorandum 25-2024 issued by Executive Judge Ma. Yolanda Panaguiton-Gaviño, follows consultations with the Bio-safety Committee.\nThe memo also emphasized the need to adhere to minimum health protocols within the premises of the Hall of Justice Main Building and Annex.\nDengue Crisis\nCases of Dengue also continue to rise sharply across Iloilo Province, prompting the Iloilo Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (PDRRMC) to pass a resolution on Thursday afternoon recommending the declaration of a state of calamity.\nThis is in response to the alarming increase in dengue cases, which has overwhelmed local health resources.\nThe Provincial Health Office’s 32nd Morbidity Week Report revealed a total of 4,595 dengue cases across the province, with 10 reported deaths, including four recent fatalities.\nIf the resolution is approved by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, 43 local government units (LGUs) will be authorized to access their calamity funds, enabling them to purchase essential supplies needed to combat the dengue outbreak.\nPDRRMO Chief, Ret. Colonel Cornelio Salinas, stated that his office is finalizing the draft resolution to include it in the agenda of the provincial board in the next regular session.\nSalinas noted that Iloilo has met the criteria set by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) for declaring a state of calamity, as three local government units—Passi City, Tigbauan, and Miagao—already made such declarations.\nIloilo Governor Arthur Defensor, Jr. is expected to implement additional preventive measures to halt the spread of dengue in the province.",

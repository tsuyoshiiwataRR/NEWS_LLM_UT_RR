    "text": "By Matis Glenn\nHashem Younis Hashem Hnaihen (DOJ) A Jordanian man who allegedly broke windows of establishments he believed were supporting Israel, damaged an energy plant and threatened to “explode everything here in whole America,” was arrested and charged, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.\nHashem Younis Hashem Hnaihen, 43, a Jordanian citizen residing in Orlando, Florida, was charged with threatening to use explosives and destruction of an energy facility, which he allegedly damaged in June. Prosecutors say he caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage to the facility, but it could have easily cost lives. At his detention hearing Wednesday, Hnaihen was ordered detained pending trial.\n“We allege that the defendant threatened to carry out hate-fueled mass violence in our country, motivated in part by a desire to target businesses for their perceived support of Israel,” U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. “Such acts and threats of violence, whether they are targeting the places that Americans frequent every day or our country’s critical infrastructure, are extremely dangerous and will not be tolerated by the Justice Department.”\nHnaihen allegedly left threatening letters after every one of his intrusions, addressed to the United States government, where he laid out a series of political demands, culminating in a threat to “destroy or explode everything here in whole America. Especially the companies and factories that support the racist state of Israel.”\n“Under the guise of expressing his beliefs, the defendant allegedly attacked a power facility and threatened local businesses, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. “Violence and destruction of property to threaten and intimidate others will never be tolerated. The FBI and our partners will work together to pursue and hold accountable those who resort to violence.”\nA restaurant allegedly targeted by Hnaihen. (DOJ)",

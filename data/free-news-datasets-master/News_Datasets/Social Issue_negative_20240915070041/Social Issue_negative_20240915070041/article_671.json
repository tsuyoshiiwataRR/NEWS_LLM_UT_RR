    "text": "EXPERT REACTION: Alcohol and gambling risks may be higher among NZ's pro rugby players\nSurvey: A study based solely on people’s responses to a series of questions.\nPeople: This is a study based on research using people.\nProfessional rugby players may have a higher risk of drinking and gambling problems compared to the general population, according to a survey of NZ men's Super Rugby players on mental health and lifestyle risks. Of the 105 players who responded, more than half were at moderate to high risk of alcohol harm, while the percentage of gamblers was about eight times higher than in the general population. 21% of players reported symptoms of depression, however, none met the criteria for depression. However, researchers say all of these risk factors may be underestimated since they were self-reported.\nJournal/conference: BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine\nOrganisation/s: Capital Sport Medicine, NZ; Axis Sports Medicine Specialists, NZ\nExpert Reaction\nThese comments have been collated by the Science Media Centre to provide a variety of expert perspectives on this issue. Feel free to use these quotes in your stories. Views expressed are the personal opinions of the experts named. They do not represent the views of the SMC or any other organisation unless specifically stated.\nDr Phillip Borell, Senior Lecturer (above the bar), University of Canterbury, comments:\nThose of us with connections into the world of professional sport will not be shocked by the findings of this research. However, a paper like this has the potential to shift the narrative regarding male professional athletes; specifically, those in such a visible sport as professional rugby union.\nThis research can illuminate the pitfalls of professional sport while also furthering current examinations of mental health among athletes. The research demonstrates that over one in five of all Super Rugby players in Aotearoa report symptoms of depression. This research will be challenging to a number of sport fans in this country. Though, not surprising in mental health and wellbeing advocacy circles.\nIt won’t be unsurprising to most that there are high rates of alcohol related harm in the elite sports scene. However, societal shifts have potentially also had an impact on what may have been a much higher rate 20 years ago.\nIn 2024 the focus on societal issues such as alcohol-related harm, gambling and mental health is far greater than it has ever been. However, for the public to see the extent of these impacts on their Super Rugby heroes has significant potential for further social change. I hope that this research can be a point of entry for further, and potentially deeper, illumination of elite athletes as people who share the same afflictions that so many of us ‘common folk’ do.\nNews for:\nNew Zealand\nMedia contact details for this story are only visible to registered journalists.",

    "text": "TAHLEQUAH – Unhoused individuals with pets deal with summer heat and finding safe places to stash their animals, but some assistance is available, and many businesses set out water bowls and allow dogs to come inside to cool off. For those who can't be without their dogs even though they're dealing with being unhoused, finding places that allow them to bring their pets inside to cool off and get water is a blessing. Connie McDonald pulls her dog, Casey, in a special wagon to keep her pet safe from traffic and paws off of the hot pavement. At the Day Center – one of the places where pets cannot come inside – Casey waited patiently Wednesday in her wagon while McDonald ate lunch. \"I pay for my dog's food, and I've had her since she was 6 weeks old,\" McDonald said. \"She can go in some places in her cart. Of course, we can't go in eating places.\" McDonald is sleeping wherever she can find a spot, and even though she has a dog, that doesn't make her feel safer. \"Sometimes it's hard with the heat, and now I was told they don't allow dogs in the cooling station at the American Legion, unless they are therapy dogs,\" McDonald said. She sometimes feels sorry for her dog because she doesn't have a place for her. \"Now me, [not having a place] doesn't matter, but she's my baby,\" McDonald said. Commander Daniel Gross at American Legion Post 50 said they were allowing dogs access and had water and snacks for the animals. Then a woman came in with a pit bull that didn't get along with the other dogs. \"We aren't a shelter, so we can't house their dogs all day long,\" Gross said. \"I didn't want to [ban them], but if it's a service animal, they can come inside. People with dogs still come to the door and we give them a chair to sit in under the shade with the animals.\" Gross said he is an animal person, but with children in the building and the possibility of a dog being aggressive, they can't be allowed in. People struggling with feeding or getting medical assistance for their pets can call the animal shelter run by the city of Tahlequah, said City Code Enforcement Officer Vicky Green. \"We can help them with spay and neuter with the Cherokee County Humane Society, and provide vaccines, get flea and tick [treatment] and dewormer,\" Green said. \"We can provide food from Chewy and Humane Society of the United States – we get donations from them – and anything that can help them keep their pet healthy.\" When a person is incarcerated and owns a dog, the animal is impounded and taken care of medically. The city requires the animal be kept up to five days, McDonald said. \"If we don't get a response from a responsible person or from the arrested person, we will adopt them out or euthanize, depending on what's going on,\" Green said. \"Ninety-nine percent of them go back with their owners.\" Green said several businesses and churches allow people with pets to come in and cool down, and they leave water out for the animal. \"Honestly, most of the pets of the homeless are pretty healthy,\" Green said. \"If we see a person walking around with their dogs in a stroller or cart, we pull over and give them food, vaccines and supplies. We've given puppy pens and soft crates to help mobilize the animal so they aren't carrying them in their arms or dragging them on a leash.\" She said they just helped one homeless person take care of 10 small dogs with food and medical care. \"The homeless really take care of their dogs,\" Green said. \"They aren't going to let anyone hurt their dog and most don't even ask for help. But we do stop and provide help, and it's case-by-case, call-by-call.\" Green said the city is lucky to have partners with the Humane Society and [Chewy.com](http://Chewy.com) that give donations. \"The city doesn't want them to spread diseases like ringworm, mange, fleas and parasites, and we treat them for anything that keeps the animal healthy, so they aren't transmitting disease through the parks or walkways,\" Green said. Cherokee County Humane Society President Shaun West said the organization doesn't have a program to help the homeless with their pets due to lack of space, other than the spay and neuter clinics. \"We have 16 pens at the shelter so we don't have a lot of opportunities to help except for emergencies, and we can't do those unless someone adopts one of animals we have now,\" West said. ,With the hot weather, adoptions are more difficult as people aren't coming out to the shelter, West said. \"I see a lot of homeless people walking around with pets and I wonder myself how they take care of them,\" West said. He said the spay-and-neuter clinics are offered once a month and sometimes twice. \"I know anybody who is homeless would qualify for the spay-and-neuter clinics, and the highest copay is $20 and some don't have to do any copay,\" West said. If an animal bites somebody, there are only two choices, West said. \"They have to be quarantined for 10 days or they have to be euthanized,\" West said. \"The choices are bad, but 10 days' quarantined is better than euthanasia.\" Billy Harrison has a pit/hound mix, Wrong Way, and said mobility with a pet is the hardest part of owning an animal and being homeless. Harrison has been homeless for about four years and admits he has been in prison, with a teardrop tattoo on his face the evidence of his time served. He said he is his own worst enemy and can't blame anyone but himself. \"It's kind of hard to get around with Wrong Way in the summer 'cause the streets are so hot,\" McDonald said. \"Sometimes the grass is hotter.\"",

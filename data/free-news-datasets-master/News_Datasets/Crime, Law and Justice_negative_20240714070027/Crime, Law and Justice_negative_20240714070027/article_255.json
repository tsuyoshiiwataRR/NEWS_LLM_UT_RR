    "text": "A motorcyclist was killed and the driver of a BMW sedan was arrested on suspicion of DUI after they crashed in Fullerton Wednesday night, June 12, authorities said. As police investigated, the driver of a Tesla on auto-pilot slammed into a police cruiser blocking traffic, but no one was injured.\nAt around 9:45 p.m., a motorcyclist aboard a Harley Davidson was stopped on Orangethorpe Avenue at a red light at the intersection of Gilbert Street, according to Fullerton Police Department spokesperson Kristy Wells. The BMW was heading east on Orangethorpe and drove through the red light, rear-ending the motorcycle and ejecting the rider east of the intersection.The motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene.The BMW dragged the motorcycle under the front of the vehicle, and bystanders kept the driver from leaving until police arrived, Wells said.The driver, 44-year-old Francisco Garcia-Vargas, of Fullerton, was arrested on suspicion of driving without a license, felony driving under the influence and gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, police said.Around midnight while authorities were still investigating the crash — with emergency lights on and flares placed in the roadway — a Tesla crashed into a patrolvehicle that was blocking traffic, Wells said.The patrol car was empty, and officers near the vehicle were able to avoid the collision.The driver of the Tesla admitted to engaging the vehicle’s ‘self-drive’ mode while using his cell phone, Wells said. The Tesla driver was uninjured and was not arrested though it was not clear if he was cited.Police are asking anyone with information about the collision involving the car and motorcycle to contact Fullerton Police Traffic Accident Investigator Manes at 714-738- 6815 or via email at jmanes@fullertonpd.org.",

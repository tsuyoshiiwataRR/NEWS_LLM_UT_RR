    "text": "Remember when Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg turned a misdemeanor that had passed the statute of limitations into 34 felony counts? A New York City jury (surprise!) found Donald Trump guilty of all 34 counts. So to make the point, at a hearing Thursday, Rep. Adam Schiff repeated the word \"guilty\" 34 times. Nothing like performative theater. Schiff: I want to begin by quoting the jury in the Manhattan trial: Guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty‚Ä¶‚Äî Acyn (@Acyn) [pic.twitter.com/FzqinWmWSq] [June 13, 2024] The Hill [reports](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4720436-adam-schiff-donald-trump-hearing-investigation-conviction-hush-money-34-charges/): Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) sought to make a statement about former President Trump‚Äôs criminal conviction Thursday, repeating the word ‚Äúguilty‚Äù 34 times in a row, once for each of the former president‚Äôs guilty counts in the Manhattan hush money case. The move by Schiff came at the beginning of his line of questioning during the House Judiciary Committee‚Äôs hearing on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg‚Äôs (D) office and its investigation into Trump‚Äôs hush money scheme during the 2016 election. After being recognized by Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during the hearing, Schiff said, ‚ÄúI want to begin by quoting the jury in the Manhattan hush money payment trial.‚Äù ‚ÄúGuilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis was what the jury pronounced, unanimously on every count.‚Äù Recommended That isn't making the point that Schiff intended.

On Tuesday, Kristopher Taylor Jr., 47, was charged with “Collision Involving Death, a second-degree felony offense,” according to police. As a result of an extensive joint investigation with the Fort Cavazos Criminal Investigation Division, traffic investigators were able to identify the suspect, Killeen Police Department announced in a news release on Thursday. The United States Marshals Service-Lone Star Fugitive Task Force also assisted. Taylor was located and arrested on Wednesday without incident in Bryan. He was taken to the Brazos County Jail and is pending arraignment. The fatal wreck happened a year ago. “On Sunday, June 11, 2023, at approximately 2:31 a.m., officers were dispatched to the 1900 block of E. Elms Road in reference to a crash. Upon the officers’ arrival, paramedics were on scene attending to a male lying in the roadway with serious injuries. The victim, Eric Rucker, succumbed to his injuries,” according to the release. Back in June 2023, the preliminary investigation revealed that two motorcycle operators were traveling westbound when the victim dropped an item in the roadway. Both motorcyclists stopped and got off their motorcycles to retrieve the item. While the victim was trying to recover the dropped item, he was struck by a passing vehicle, according to the release.

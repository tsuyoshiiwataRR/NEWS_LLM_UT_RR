    "text": "JOHNSTOWN, Pa. – Skeletal remains found Friday in the basement of convicted murderer Brian Bradley Giles' former home were positively identified as the body of Giles' former girlfriend, Jilly Todaro, officials said Thursday. Todaro had been missing since December 2020. Cambria County Coroner Jeff Lees said the identification of the remains was completed through body imaging Wednesday by a forensic odontologist and anthropologist. With an autopsy and a forensic examination complete, Lees ruled the manner of death homicide. Nobody had been charged in Todaro's death as of Thursday morning – but Cambria County District Attorney Greg Neugebauer said he expects charges to be filed in the near future, and he answered plainly when asked how many suspects there are. \"One,\" he said. \"That should tell you something.\" Giles, 48, was convicted last Thursday in Cambria County court of first-degree murder and aggravated assault in the slaying of his wife, Nancy Giles, who had been reported missing in 2018. Her remains were found in May 2019 along a trail on the Inclined Plane hillside in downtown Johnstown. Brian Giles and Todaro had been involved in a relationship as the investigation of Nancy Giles' disappearance and death was developing. An earlier search of the Johnstown home that Todaro shared with Brian Giles was conducted in 2020, after Todaro was reported missing. Her remains were unearthed Friday in the basement of that home, located on the 500 block of Franklin Street in the city's Kernville section. \"The details of what led us there again last week are in a sealed search warrant,\" Neugebauer said. \"I can't go into detail about that, but we had for the first time very specific information relative to where a body would be located. Obviously, when we went there, we expected it to be Jilly.\" Neugebauer said the information received last Friday bolsters the case. \"As a result of the information we got on Friday, our case is going to be stronger,\" he said. \"Like lots of things in life, sometimes patience pays off.\" Todaro, who was 43 when she disappeared, would have been 46 at the time her remains were found. \"I am not going to elaborate on the cause of death at this time, other than to say it was homicidal violence,\" Lees said. \"I've been in contact with Jilly's family, who is very grateful that she has been found and they can start the healing and grieving process.\" 'I wish she knew how many people cared' Lees and Neugebauer spoke during a press conference Thursday at Lees' office in Johnstown, alongside Johnstown Police Department Detective Brad Christ and Cambria County Assistant District Attorney Jessica Aurandt. \"There wasn't a day that went by that we didn't spend time working this case,\" Christ said. \"Between the whole detective bureau at JPD, I can't even calculate the number of hours we spent on this. And again, we couldn't do this without the prosecution team with Assistant District Attorney Jess Aurandt.\" Christ and Neugebauer urged the public to report domestic abuse when they see it. \"If you know somebody who is in a bad situation, a spouse – male or female – please contact us. There is help out there,\" Christ said. \"We will do everything in our power to help.\" Law enforcement officials offered help to Todaro, who was allegedly the victim of multiple assaults by Giles before her disappearance, The Tribune-Democrat archives show. She had personal cellphone numbers for police officers and sat at the conference table in the district attorney's office, Neugebauer said. \"Jilly was really a nice person. She really was,\" Neugebauer said. \"I don't think she always liked things I had to say to her, or Jess (Aurandt) had to say to her, but we were coming from a good place, trying to help her. She was a good person.\" \"This one hits me a little differently,\" Neugebauer said. \"Every homicide is a tragedy. This one is just a little different.\" Aurandt said she experienced many emotions when Todaro's remains were identified. \"It was like a weight that had been sitting there for three and a half years had been lifted,\" she said, \"but then to see the remains of a person who struggled in her life to be treated with dignity, and who I know did not feel the worth that she truly had during her lifetime – to see those remains, I don't know I can articulate how that feels. \"I just wish that Jilly could have seen, in her lifetime, the amount of people who rallied together, who made a lot of sacrifices to ensure that she was found and treated with the dignity she deserved. I wish she could have seen how many people care. I see a lot of public response to this case. I wish she knew how many people cared, and how many people care now.\"",

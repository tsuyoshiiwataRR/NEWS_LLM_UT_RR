It is not known if the additional trips Chairman Durbin’s investigation exposed are included in that calculation. The total of all gifts all justices accepted over 20 years, including “likely” gifts, Fix The Court reported, was $6,592,657.\nWe just revealed new details and private trips gifted to Justice Thomas by Harlan Crow.\nJustice Thomas never disclosed these, raising further questions about the accuracy of his disclosures.\n[pic.twitter.com/C0CRtIJ2HQ]\n— Senate Judiciary Committee (@JudiciaryDems)\n[June 13, 2024]\n“Thomas traveled on Crow’s private jet during trips in 2017, 2019 and 2021 between various US states, as well as on a previously known 2019 trip to Indonesia, during which Thomas also stayed on Crow’s mega-yacht,” CNN reports. “The newly revealed private plane trips\nadd to the picture of luxury travel enjoyed by Thomas and bankrolled by friends of the justice who have ties to conservative politics.”\nREAD MORE:\n‘We Do Not Remember When You Tried to Have Us Killed’: GOP Slammed for Trump Standing Ovation\nPunchbowl News’ Andrew Desiderio\nadds the new information “was obtained via the [committee’s] subpoena authorization for Crow.”\n“’Mr. Crow reached an agreement with the Senate Judiciary Committee to provide information responsive to its requests going back seven years,’ Crow spokesperson Michael Zona said of the information revealed Thursday,” CNN also reported.\nZona claimed Crow has “serious and continued concerns about the legality and necessity of the inquiry,” but “Mr. Crow engaged in good faith negotiations with the Committee from the beginning to resolve the matter. As a condition of this agreement, the Committee agreed to end its probe with respect to Mr. Crow.”\nWatch CNN’s report below or\nat this link.\nTapper: Breaking, right now, Senator Durbin says Justice Clarence Thomas took several additional free trips on the private plane of GOP megadonor, Harlan crow.

News\n‘He Said I’m Doing a Very Good Job’: Mike Johnson Slammed Over Remarks on Trump Meeting\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, the most-powerful elected Republican in the nation, second in line to the presidency, is under fire after appearing to subordinate himself to the criminally-indicted and criminally-convicted one-term ex-president, as he glowingly delivered a report of his Thursday meeting with Donald Trump.\nTrump “said very complementary things about all of us. We had sustained applause. He said I’m doing a very good job. We’re grateful for that,” Speaker Johnson told reporters (vide below) after he and members of his Republican conference met with the ex-president barely blocks from where the January 6, 2021 insurrection Trump incited took place. Thursday marks the\nfirst time since that fatal and violent day Trump has returned to Capitol Hill.\nThe Speaker of the House is the co-head of a co-equal branch of the federal government. Donald Trump is no longer president, so is no longer head of the executive branch.\nHouse Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik told reporters it was a “very successful special political conference with our special guest, President Donald J. Trump.”\n“Johnson has openly embraced Trump, who was crucial in supporting him when he faced the threat of being ousted … by conservative GOP House hard-liners, saying coordination with Trump is important heading into November’s election and a potential second Trump presidency,”\nABC News reports.\nREAD MORE:\n‘Don’t Breathe Easy Yet’: Abortion Pill Safe Only ‘For Now’ Experts Say After SCOTUS Ruling\n“I think it’s important for the country, to have us, to have close coordination,” Johnson also said Wednesday. “I believe he’ll have, can be, the most consequential president of the modern era, because we have to fix effectively every area of public policy.”\nPresidential historian Michael Beschloss, who has written nine books on the American presidency,\nslammed Johnson.\n“Speaker of the House is incumbent elected officer of coequal branch of American government—shouldn’t feel need to publicly pronounce himself ‘grateful’ to an ex-President for saying he and party colleagues are doing a ‘good job.’ ”\n“Half the US Congress is now weaponized, obstructing justice, and abusing power to help trump launder away his criminality, malfeasance, and failure—while also conflating government business with his campaign and insurrection with government,”\nobserved Condé Nast legal affairs editor Luke Zaleski. “Trump owns the House. Is America next?”\nFormer Obama senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer\nnoted, “Trump’s supporters almost murdered these folks less than four years ago.”\nU.S. Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL)\nadded, “The guy who found ‘very fine people on both sides’ of a neo-Nazi rally thinks Mike Johnson is doing a good job. And Mike Johnson is proud of that. These people.”\nWatch Speaker Johnson’s remarks below or\nhttps://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/2024/06/he-said-im-doing-a-very-good-job-mike-johnson-slammed-over-report-on-trump-meeting/.\nMike Johnson says that during the House GOP meeting with Trump today, Trump “said very complementary things about all of us.

The court did not rule on the actual merits of the case, nor on the drug’s safety and viability, or the FDA’s decision to approve the medication. Civil rights and other legal experts have long held Republicans, especially after Roe v. Wade was overturned, want to go after medication abortion and contraception, and warn after Thursday’s SCOTUS ruling those efforts will continue.\nMifepristone, which was first approved for use in France\nin 1988, was approved for prescription use in 2000 by the U.S. Food and Drug administration, which states it is safe to use.\n“Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the court, wrote that while plaintiffs have ‘sincere legal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to elective abortion and to FDA’s relaxed regulation of mifepristone,’ that does not mean they have a federal case,”\nNBC News reports.\nJustice Kavanaugh advised the plaintiffs that they “may present their concerns and objections to the president and FDA in the regulatory process or to Congress and the president in the legislative process.”\n“And they may also express their views about abortion and mifepristone to fellow citizens, including in the political and electoral processes,” he added.\nREAD MORE:\nGOP Will Ban IVF if Trump Wins After Southern Baptists Condemnation: Expert\nRobert Reich, the professor of public policy and former U.S. Cabinet Secretary,\nwrote: “The Supreme Court dismissing challenges to the FDA’s approval of mifepristone is good news, but the fight’s not over. A MAGA-controlled FDA could effectively ban all abortion medications without even involving the courts or Congress. Abortion access is on the ballot this fall.”\nLegal journalist Cristian Farias,\nhttps://twitter.com/cristianafarias/status/1801274697809604707, “Today’s decision denying standing to religious doctors challenging the FDA’s approval of mifepristone says nothing about states doing the same. That’s a big problem, because Trump judge Matthew Kacsmaryk allowed a trio of states to intervene in this very case. He’s on a mission.”\nAlso pointing to the Kacsmaryk decision, Slate’s Mark Joseph Stern\nwarns, “Today’s decision will probably not stop him from issuing more nationwide restrictions on mifepristone.”\nLegal experts say the way the court ruled was anticipated, the physicians’ claim to standing was “\nutterly ridiculous,” and warn the right will return with another attack on medication abortion.\nAttorney Moe Davis, the well-known and outspoken retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, professor of law, and judge,\ndeclared: “To be clear, the Supreme Court did not decide the merits of the case. They said the party challenging mifepristone lacked standing (i.e., they couldn’t show they suffered any injuries) to bring the case. Another party could (and will) try again. This isn’t a win, it’s a delay.”\nProfessor of law and legal historian Mary Ziegler\nsaid, “The fight over abortion pills and the Comstock Act isn’t over. Other plaintiffs are ready to bring identical claims and assert they have standing. And conservatives argue that a Trump DOJ could enforce the Comstock Act as a ban and force SCOTUS to take up the q.”\nREAD MORE:\n‘Birth Control and Dental Dams and Food’: Fox News Host’s Rant Goes Viral\nAlex Aronson, former Chief Counsel to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, now Executive Director of the non-profit organization Court Accountability,\nresponded to Thursday’s ruling from a tactical perspective.\n“Classic Roberts Court maneuver:\n-grant dangerous, frivolous, right-wing case with no business on its docket;\n-light country’s hair on fire;\n-smack down frivolous case to be hailed as reasonable and moderate, giving cover to other destruction.\n-still advance right-wing agenda”\nProfessor of law Melissa Murray, making clear this ruling is likely not the end,\nwarned, “don’t breathe easy yet.”\n“This decision preserves access to medication abortion… FOR NOW,” she\nhttps://twitter.com/ProfMMurray/status/1801258264287478009. “There will be another case–with better plaintiffs–before the Court faster than Thomas can book a ride on Crow’s private jet.”\nREAD MORE:\n‘Lying’: Johnson Slammed for Latest Claim on Trump Respecting Peaceful Transfer of Power\nImage via Shutterstock\nNews\n‘These Kinds of Folks’: Jim Jordan Wants to Block Fani Willis and Alvin Bragg\nRepublican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, increasing his efforts to use the tools of his office to\nsupport, protect, and promote Donald Trump, has been speaking with Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan about defunding federal prosecutions of the now-criminally convicted ex-president, according to a report by Politico Playbook.\nThursday morning Donald Trump is meeting with House Republicans, barely blocks away from the violent and deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol he incited,\nat the restaurant where one of the pipe bombs was discovered outside on January 6, 2021.

And we all do and we’ve all talked about it ad nauseam.”\nREAD MORE:\nGOP Will Ban IVF if Trump Wins After Southern Baptists Condemnation: Expert\nTrump has been urging Speaker Johnson to pass legislation that would allow an ex-president to move any state-level prosecutions against them to the federal courts. It’s an idea that has been met with skepticism among Republicans, but “there’s an education effort underway inside the House GOP,” Politico reports, citing remarks by the bill’s sponsor, U.S. Rep. Russell Fry (R-SC).\nChairman Jordan wants to take those efforts to defund those federal prosecutions, specifically defunding Special Counsel Jack Smith’s Office, and extend them to state prosecutors who have brought cases against the ex-president. State and local law enforcement agencies, including district attorneys offices, are eligible for federal grants.\n“That country certainly sees what’s going on, and they don’t want Fani Willis and Alvin Bragg and these kinds of folks to be able to continue to use grant dollars for targeting people in a political lawfare type of way,” Chairman Jordan told Politico Playbook.\nREAD MORE:\n‘Birth Control and Dental Dams and Food’: Fox News Host’s Rant Goes Viral\nTrending\n- News2 days ago\nSpeaker Johnson on Why He Thinks Hunter Biden’s Conviction Is Valid but Donald Trump’s Is Not\n- News2 days ago\nTrump Insists No Mandatory Military Draft Advisers Have Been Planning\n- News3 days ago\nMany Republicans Don’t Believe Trump Was Indicted or Aren’t Sure – But Say He’s Not Guilty\n- News2 days ago\nSecret Audio of Justice Alito’s Wife Exposes His Plans and Her ‘Bitterness’: Critics\n- News2 days ago\n‘False’ and ‘Irresponsible’: DOJ Smacks Down Jim Jordan’s ‘Conspiracy’ in Sharp Letter\n- News24 hours ago\nGOP Will Ban IVF if Trump Wins After Southern Baptists Condemnation: Expert\n- News1 day ago\nButtigieg on Martha-Ann Alito: Flags Symbolizing Love vs. Insurrection Are Different\n- OPINION1 day ago\n‘Lying’: Johnson Slammed for Latest Claim on Trump Respecting Peaceful Transfer of Power",

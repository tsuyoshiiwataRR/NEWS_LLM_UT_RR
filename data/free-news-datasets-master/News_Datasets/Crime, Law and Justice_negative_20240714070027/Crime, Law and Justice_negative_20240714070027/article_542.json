    "text": "A 29-year-old Granger man has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for a 2017 Toppenish homicide. Originally charged with first-degree murder in Indian Country, assault with a dangerous weapon in Indian Country, and discharging and using a firearm in a crime of violence, Jaime Herrera, 29, pleaded guilty to the murder and assault charges in March. Herrera is accused of fatally [shooting Waylon Owens, 23, of Toppenish](https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/toppenish-death-ruled-homicide/article_e2d95b40-6cb1-11e7-b51a-6fd171755bd5.html) in the 200 block of South Elm Street in the early morning hours of July 19, 2017. Herrera, at the time a Sureño gang member, pulled up to Owens and another man, accused them of being gang traitors, and shot Owens with an AR-15 assault rifle, according to court documents. The federal government took jurisdiction of the case because Owens was a Yakama Nation citizen, the other man was a citizen of the Nez Perce and the crime occurred within the Yakama Nation’s reservation. Herrera’s sentence, handed down Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Yakima, will run consecutively to his 20-year sentence in Yakima County Superior Court for the [2019 killing of Joe Albert Fuller](https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/crime_and_courts/three-sentenced-in-2019-killing-of-granger-man-on-cherry-hill-road/article_7b4b3c85-f2a3-5430-9523-6b727f3be0b1.html). Federal prosecutors recommended the 30-year sentence to run concurrently with his 20-year sentence in state court. Prosecutors noted that Herrera killed Fuller after killing Owens, “ruining multiple lives in the Yakima Valley.” “Should (Herrera) fully serve both sentences he will exit the custody of the (federal) Bureau of Prisons and the Washington State Department of Corrections as an old man, presumably physically incapable from continuing to commit acts of violence and socially disconnected from the gang and drug lifestyle that motivated his senseless behavior,” Assistant U.S. Attorneys Earl Hicks and Michael Ellis wrote in a sentencing memo. Lorinda Meyer Youngcourt, Herrera’s attorney, said Herrera accepted full responsibility for the crime and recommended Judge Mary K. Dimke follow the sentencing recommendation for 30 years running consecutively with the state sentence. She said Herrera faced “overwhelming obstacles to healthy development” growing up, including physical abuse, neglect, poverty, gang activity and drug sales. Herrera was also addicted to drugs and, being raised by gang members, he followed in their footsteps, Youngcourt said. She said Herrera dropped out of his gang in 2023, which puts him at risk of retaliation while incarcerated. Herrera’s father, Marcos Cruz Herrera Jr., was also convicted in Fuller’s death. But prosecutors said that Herrera’s upbringing was not an excuse for his crimes. “No one forced the defendant to kill; the defendant made his own terrible choices,” the prosecution’s sentencing memo said. “As noted by the defendant, he had an opportunity to get away and change his life while living in Spokane. The defendant chose not to, and instead took two lives and ruined countless others.”",

    "text": "In our Speakers Quarter report, we&#039;re hearing from driving instructors who have a pretty important job teaching Canadians how to drive, but they say they can barely make ends meet After Imran Mubarak&#039;s long term job went bust. I had been working in a retail store for more than 15 years, but my job went off. He decided to get behind the wheel. Right now, as a driving instructor, I like to teach the new generation the proper way of driving. Like teaching them to avoid those bad habits that drive us all nuts. The left lanes for passing, yes, and right lane for driving. Right lane for driving. People don&#039;t understand that no, and that&#039;s another cause. Traffic jam. He loves what he does, but as a new instructor it&#039;s been a tough start. What are the challenges when it comes to cost of being a driving instructor? The bigger cost is the insurance. For him it&#039;s 900 bucks per month. They can&#039;t afford 900. Well, how much do you make in a month or just often driving? I&#039;m I&#039;m a brand new driver so right now I&#039;m making around $2400 and that includes $700.00 for my gas and $900.00 for insurance. He&#039;s calling on the government to pressure the insurance industry to give new instructors like him a break. He understands his risk is higher but says it doesn&#039;t justify the cost. Otherwise, eventually we&#039;re not going to survive. He also wants the government to crack down on illegal instructors who he says are taking away business from it. They&#039;re not paying insurance. They didn&#039;t go to even college. I just have a spent four, $500 to do the their extra break in the car and start teaching the driving instructions, which is not good. It&#039;s illegal, it&#039;s not safe, it&#039;s not fair. City News reached out to Ontario&#039;s insurance regulators. They&#039;re looking into the concerns. Mubarak is hopeful him speaking out leads to change. Allowing him to continue doing what he loves. Would you like it that much to stay in it? Because I&#039;m sure you could get a job and not have all those expenses. Yes, I&#039;m expecting the government should beep into it and reduce the amount of insurance money and check on the illegal driving instructors so the industry will be back in the good hand. As always, if you have an issue, story or question you&#039;d like us to look into, love to hear from you. Reach out by visiting the Speaker&#039;s Corner tab on the City News website.

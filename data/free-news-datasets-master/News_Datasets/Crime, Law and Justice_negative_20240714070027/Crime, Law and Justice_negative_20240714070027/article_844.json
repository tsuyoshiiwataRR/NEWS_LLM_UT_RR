    "text": "A second suspect was arrested and charged in connection with last month’s double shooting at a Cambridge basketball court, according to the Middlesex District Attorney’s office.\nMachyus Battle, 19, of Cambridge, was arraigned Monday in Cambridge District Court and was slated for a dangerousness hearing Thursday, the DA’s office said. Another man, 23-year-old Yonayvi Cruceta, also of Cambridge, appeared in court in May in connection with the shooting.\nOn May 23, at 9:39 p.m., police officers responded to Donnelly Field at 91 Berkshire St. for reports of multiple gunshots, the office said.\nInvestigators said Cruceta was at the outdoor court at the same time as a group of people when Cruceta and Battle got into an argument. The two then allegedly exchanged gunfire, the DA’s office said.\nCruceta, along with a 22-year-old woman hit by a stray bullet, were taken to the hospital with gunshot wounds, according to the DA’s office.\nBattle was charged with attempted assault and battery by discharge of a firearm, assault and battery by discharge of a weapon, assault with a dangerous weapon, and carrying a firearm without a license.\nHe also was charged with carrying a loaded firearm, discharging a firearm within 500 feet of a dwelling, carrying a dangerous weapon on school grounds, and possession of ammunition without a firearms identification card.\nThe double shooting remains under investigation, the DA’s office said. Anyone with information regarding the incident should contact Cambridge police at 617-349-9151 or online at cambridgepolice.org .",

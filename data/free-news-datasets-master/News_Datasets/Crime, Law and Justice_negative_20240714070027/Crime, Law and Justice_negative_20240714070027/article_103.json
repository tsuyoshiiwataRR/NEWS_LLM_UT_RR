(Kansas Department of Corrections) by: Alyssa Mueller\nPosted: Jun 13, 2024 / 03:05 PM CDT\nUpdated: Jun 13, 2024 / 03:06 PM CDT\nSHARE\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — An Independence man already serving a prison sentence in Kansas for raping a Johnson County sheriff’s deputy pleaded guilty to one count of rape in Jackson County, Missouri.\nBrady Newman-Caddell, 29, was sentenced to 30 years in the Missouri Department of Corrections for the 2016 rape of Taylor Hirth .\nIn 2019, Newman-Caddell was sentenced to 55 years in the Kansas Department of Corrections, the maximum possible punishment, for kidnapping and raping the sheriff’s deputy .\nInvestigation underway for how thieves accessed lockbox of Grandview home for sale Hirth testified about being raped by Newman-Caddell in February of 2016, eight months before the deputy was attacked. Newman-Caddell was charged with raping Hirth in December of 2016.\nHirth’s attack happened in front of her 2-year-old daughter when she and Newman-Caddell were neighbors in the same apartment building. William Luth was also sentenced in both rapes.\nIn 2019, Hirth addressed her vulnerability after the rape when she said she got the sense that investigators did not believe her nor take her case seriously. That’s until DNA from the rape of a Johnson County deputy linked Luth to her case.\nChiefs rally shooting victims continue to wait on ‘KC Strong’ fund money In 2019, a judge said Newman-Caddell has psychopathic traits and she’s convinced he would attack women again if he was not locked away.",

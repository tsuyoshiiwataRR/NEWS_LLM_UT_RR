    "text": "Former Rep. Arnoldo Teves with lawyer Ferdinand Topacio. His lawyer said Teves was released from preventive detention in Becora Prison in Dili, Timor Leste. (Photo from Atty. Ferdinand Topacio)\nFugitive and expelled lawmaker Arnolfo Teves Jr. has been placed under house arrest in Timor-Leste, the Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed on Thursday.\n“He will be under 24-hour security, with only family members permitted to visit him,” the DOJ said in a statement, adding that the Philippine government would closely monitor the situation to ensure that all procedures were “valid and appropriate.”\nADVERTISEMENT Justice Undersecretary Raul Vasquez said in a separate statement that whether the former congressman would be in custody, rearrested or under house arrest, he was still “under the control of the police authorities.”\nFEATURED STORIES GLOBALNATION PH would no longer send ships to Rimpac exercises, only observers GLOBALNATION Ateneo leads 56 Philippine universities in 2024 THE Impact Rankings GLOBALNATION Philippines is among world’s worst countries for workers again “Simply put, he is deprived of liberty. Ongoing extradition hearings now,” Vasquez said. Teves’ legal counsel in the Philippines, lawyer Ferdinand Topacio said the Timorese court issued the order to place his client under house arrest on Wednesday.\nREAD: Teves released from detention in Timor-Leste, says his lawyer\n“After having determined that he is not a flight risk and that he has not violated any laws, he was placed under guard in his residence simply to ensure his attendance in the hearings,” Topacio said. Timor-Leste media agency Hatutan.com first reported the decision of the Court of Appeals in Dili to place the lawmaker under house arrest while awaiting his extradition proceedings.\nStill a flight risk In a GMA News report that cited data from Hatutan.com, the Timorese court reportedly noted that Teves was living in a rented house with a monthly rent of $10,000 with his wife and two children.\nHe was also reportedly working as a partner in a construction firm, receiving financial support from the owner. “Given the facts above, it is concluded that the risk of flight persists for extraditee, especially since he has the financial means to leave Timor-Leste,” the court said, contrary to Topacio’s statement that his client was no longer a flight risk.\nTeves, who fled to Timor-Leste to evade prosecution for multiple charges, including murder, in the Philippines, was arrested by authorities on March 21. He has been tagged as the brains in the March 2023 killing of his political rival, former Negros Oriental Gov. Roel Degamo, and nine other individuals in Pamplona town.\nYour subscription could not be saved. Please try again.",

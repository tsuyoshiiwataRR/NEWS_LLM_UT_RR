    "text": "(Photo : Louisiana State Police) Four-year-old Erin Brunett’s body was dumped in Jackson, Mississippi, in a wooded area near the stolen getaway car driven by her alleged kidnapper, Daniel Callihan, authorities said, according to WVUE-TV. Erin’s 6-year-old sister, Jalie, was found alive in the vehicle. [Authorities in Louisiana](https://www.hngn.com/articles/261262/20240606/mother-baby-fentanyl-louisiana-dies-overdose-police.htm) are [frantically searching](https://www.hngn.com/articles/261376/20240611/gabby-petito-letter-wrote-killer-apologetic-brian-laundrie.htm) for the two missing daughters of a woman discovered \"brutally murdered\" in her home Thursday morning. Callie Brunett, 35, was [found dead](https://www.hngn.com/articles/261412/20240613/reward-raised-catch-killer-mother-4-year-old-daughter-florida.htm) by her father inside her Loranger, Louisiana, mobile home, according to the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff's Office, [WVUE-TV](https://www.fox8live.com/2024/06/13/2-young-girls-missing-after-mother-found-dead-loranger-sheriff-says/) reported. It's unclear how she was killed. Her brown hair, blue-eyed girls – 6-year-old Jalie and 3-year-old Erin – are \"unaccounted for,\" Sheriff Daniel Edwards said, according to the outlet. Family members told investigators they became concerned after not hearing from Burnett since Tuesday and went to check on her when they came across the bloody crime scene, according to [WGNO-TV](https://wgno.com/news/crime/woman-found-killed-her-children-missing-in-loranger/) and [WDSU-TV](https://www.wdsu.com/article/tropical-weather-gulf-of-mexico-florida-texas-mexico/61083161). Her kids were nowhere to be found. Authorities are searching for an unknown, armed and dangerous white male wanted for questioning. He's believed to be driving Brunett's black 2012 Chrysler sedan bearing Louisiana license plate 895GML, an AMBER Alert poster read.

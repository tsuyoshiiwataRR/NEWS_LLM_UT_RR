    "text": "After the Nigeria Police Force apprehended three suspects responsible for the spread of counterfeit websites offering Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board registrations and fake JAMB admission letters, an official statement was released by the Force Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi.\nIn April, a warning was issued by the Nigeria Police Force and JAMB cautioning against individuals using phony websites to deceive candidates applying for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination.\nA partnership between the Nigeria Police Force National Cyber Crime Centre and JAMB was announced to crack down on phishing websites and scammers.\nDuring a joint press conference at the Force Headquarters, Louis Edet House, Abuja, the police and JAMB highlighted that the fraudulent sites were designed to trick unsuspecting candidates into divulging personal information such as registration numbers, email addresses, and phone numbers, which were then exploited for malicious purposes.\nAccording to Adejobi’s statement titled “Police Unveil Threat Actors Behind Falsification of Thousands of Fake JAMB Admission Letters, Arrests 3, Recovers 4 Fake Domain, Website,” the perpetrators behind these unlawful activities have been apprehended.\nThe Inspector General of Police, Olukayode Egbetokun, reiterated the NPF’s commitment to ensuring the safety and security of citizens both physically and in cyberspace.\nThe statement explained, “Following the prior press briefing by the Nigeria Police Force and the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board, reassuring the public of their efforts to eliminate the suspects responsible for the proliferation of various fake websites for JAMB registration and the falsification of fake JAMB admission letters, the NPF-NCCC has arrested three suspects in connection with the conspiracy involving Computer Related Forgery and System Interference, as per sections 8, 13, and 27 of the Cybercrimes Act, 2015 as amended.\nThe statement further revealed, “The suspects, including Effa Leonard Mpama, Ibang Ernest Jerome, and Eshiet Odotukana Benson, were part of a syndicate that illegally accessed JAMB’s Central Admission Processing System (CAPS) and e-facility. They manipulated admission letters and inputted fake details to secure admissions into tertiary institutions, sabotaging the JAMB admission process.\n“Upon interrogation, the suspects divulged their varying degrees of involvement, corroborating the existing evidence. Effa Leonard Mpama and Ibang Ernest Jerome collected personal details of prospective candidates and forwarded them to Eshiet Odotukana Benson, who obtained CAPS links from associates at JAMB Computer Based Test Centers. These associates, Daniel and Chris, still at large, operated in CBT centers in Calabar, Cross River State.”\nForensic analysis played a crucial role in uncovering an Imo State-based syndicate responsible for creating fake domains and associated websites.\n“Furthermore, digital forensic analysis led to the discovery of 4 fake domains and websites linked to a syndicate in Imọ State. Eshiet, possessing CAPS links, would modify the e-facility at any CBT center by using a candidate’s login details to create a fake admission letter,” the statement noted.\nEmphasizing the severity of such criminal partnerships and similar illegal activities, Egbetokun praised the Nigeria Police Force National Cybercrime Center for its dedication to safeguarding Nigerian citizens both physically and in the digital realm.\nIt was asserted that the suspects would face legal charges once the investigations were completed.",

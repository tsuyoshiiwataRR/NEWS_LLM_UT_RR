BABYLON, NY — An illegal late-night \"pop-up\" party in East Farmingdale was shut down Saturday night by Suffolk police and Babylon's Quality of Life Task Force, town officials told Patch. The parties—which feature large crowds, drinking and loud music late at night— are pop-up events organized and advertised via social media, including Snapchat, Ryan Bonner, Town of Babylon Director of Communications, told Patch. According to Bonner, police made two arrests and issued summonses to around 30 attendees. Some vehicles parked on the property had \"massive\" speakers mounted on them, he added.

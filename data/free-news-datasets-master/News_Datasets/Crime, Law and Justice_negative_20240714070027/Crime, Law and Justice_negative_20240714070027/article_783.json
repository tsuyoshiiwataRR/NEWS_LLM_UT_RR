    "text": "Update: Police seek to identify woman after hate-motivated assault\nThe woman police were looking to identify in relation to a hate-motivated assault from late April has been identified and charges are pending.\nThank you to the media and public for your assistance.\nOriginal release:\nWe are asking for the public’s help to identify a woman who is believed to be responsible for a hate-motivated assault that took place in the downtown core in late April.\nOn Sunday, April 28, 2024, at approximately 5 p.m., three women were exiting the Central Library, located at 800 Third Street S.E., walking toward the City Hall CTrain station, when they were approached by another woman who was shouting obscenities, and aggressively gesturing at one of the women in the group.\nThe victim, who was concerned about the safety of herself and of her friends, asked her friends to move to a safer location while asking the woman to leave them alone. The woman continued to follow the victim while shouting, attempting to burn her face with a lit cigarette, eventually striking the woman in the face before throwing a travel-style coffee mug at her. The victim continued walking away eventually finding safety and then called police.\n“Based on the disparaging remarks this woman used, it is clear that this incident was motivated by hate,” says Constable Matt Messenger, Hate Crime Co-ordinator of the Calgary Police Service Hate Crime Prevention Team. “The victim was with a group of friends who were going about their day in our city, and have now been left feeling scared, humiliated and discriminated against all because of who they are. This is unacceptable.”\nThere is no place for hate in our city. Hate-motivated crimes are recognizable crimes, like assault, theft, vandalism or any other crime, where the offender was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate that is based on one of nine personal characteristics of the victim. If you see hate, report it. Visit\n[ www.reporthate.ca]() for more information on how and why to report.\nWe ask anyone with information to contact police by calling 403-266-1234. Tips can also be submitted anonymously to Crime Stoppers through any of the following methods:\nTALK: 1-800-222-8477\nTYPE:\n[www.calgarycrimestoppers.org ]()\nAPP: P3 Tips\nCase #: CA24168410/4757",

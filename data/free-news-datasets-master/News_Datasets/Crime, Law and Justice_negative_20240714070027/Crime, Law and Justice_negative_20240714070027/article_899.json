    "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A Memphis man is in custody after a bystander was shot at a South Memphis apartment complex, police say. Keywon Wilson, 23, has been charged with aggravated assault, reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon, and vandalism. Memphis Police responded to the Longview Heights Apartments on Philsar Street at around 9:49 p.m. on April 27. According to Memphis Police, a woman had been shot at the apartments and taken to Memphis Fire Station #20 by a private vehicle. She was then taken to Regional One Hospital. Memphis Police say the victim told investigators that she had gone outside to smoke a cigarette and saw a fight happening. The victim allegedly told police that she heard gunshots but did not see the shooter. Police say the victim then realized that she had been shot in the abdomen. A neighbor took her to the fire station. According to police, the apartment’s property manager told officers a fight had happened outside a party in one of the apartment buildings. Police say the property manager saw a woman hand Wilson a gun after he asked for it. Memphis Police say Wilson is accused of firing shots at another building. One of the bullets struck the victim. The property manager reportedly told police that the leasing office was also struck and that a computer monitor inside was damaged. Wilson is currently in the Shelby County Jail. His bond has not been set at this time.",

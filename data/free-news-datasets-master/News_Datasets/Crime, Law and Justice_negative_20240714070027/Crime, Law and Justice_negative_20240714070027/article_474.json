    "text": "On Tuesday morning, when the felonious Trump returned to the [scene of the crime](https://crooksandliars.com/2024/06/dems-give-felon-45-reality-check-he), Capitol Hill, to meet with his top bootlickers and co-conspirators, he took a minute to do some trash talking about Milwaukee, where the RNC will be holding their convention next month: And then all hilarity broke loose as his aides and state Republicans fell over themselves trying to spin the insult away. Trump spokesman, Steven Cheung, called it \"Total bullshit,\" but did not deny Trump said it. Meanwhile, a RNC spokesperson said that Trump's comments were in regard to the fact that Milwaukee [won't push protesters](https://crooksandliars.com/2024/05/johnsons-latest-fauxrage-security-rnc) into Lake Michigan. The Wisconsin GOP claimed that the issue was election integrity, citing the election clerk who proved the system worked by trying to cheat and getting [caught and convicted](https://crooksandliars.com/2024/03/former-milwaukee-election-official). When the Wisconsin GOP delegation was asked about it, they were all over the map [in their excuses](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2024/06/13/trump-calls-milwaukee-host-for-the-2024-rnc-a-horrible-city/74083831007/): U.S. Reps. Glenn Grothman of the 6th Congressional District, Scott Fitzgerald of the 5th Congressional District and Tom Tiffany of the 7th Congressional District all told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Trump made the comments when speaking about the upcoming election.Grothman said Trump “was concerned about the election in Milwaukee” and said he thought Trump “felt we need to do better in urban centers around the country.” He suggested Trump had concerns that Republicans “didn’t do very well in Milwaukee.” An aide to Fitzgerald also told the Journal Sentinel that Trump’s comments “were about election integrity.” Trump has repeatedly falsely claimed he won Wisconsin in 2020 and has at times blamed Milwaukee's election officials for the election outcome, baselessly claiming absentee voting in the state's largest city was rife with fraud. U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, a freshman Republican who represents Wisconsin's 3rd Congressional District in western Wisconsin, blasted Punchbowl's reporting, however, saying in a post on the social media platform X that the former president was \"specifically referring to the CRIME RATE in Milwaukee.\" And Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, who represents the state's 1st Congressional District, said: \"I was in the room. President Trump did not say this. There is no better place than Wisconsin in July.\" And here I was hoping he hated my hometown so much because of me. Oh, well. Grothman then came back with a rare moment of lucidity and honesty: Grothman later said he was confused by the mixed messages from Wisconsin's delegation and reiterated Trump was referring to election issues. “I guess you can take it however you wanna take it,” he said of Trump’s comments. The Democrats weren't about to take a felon trash talking Wisconsin's biggest city, with Representative Gwen Moore and Senator Tammy Baldwin giving him a one-two that will leave a mark: Ironically, Trump is all excited to come to Racine, Wisconsin next week, which means his plane will be landing and taking off from Milwaukee. Maybe, if Milwaukee is so horrible, he could spare himself - and us - from that experience by staying home. And Felonious Don, we'll let you know the feeling is mutual in November.",

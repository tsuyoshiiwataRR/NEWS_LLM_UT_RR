    "text": "CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC) - Nine months after her husband’s murder, a widow says she has some solace now that Charleston police have identified and arrested a suspect and she’ll be following the case every step of the way. Police charged Davon Laval Heyward in the Sept. 2023 shooting and killing of Byrant Lymont Powell. Heyward was already in the Al Cannon Detention Center on related charges when police served the murder warrant on Monday. Yolanda Shine Powell says the past few months have been hard. “This has been a whirlwind right here, like a merry-go-round and not in a nice way, you know. It’s been a difficult path that they have led me on. They have really changed my life,” Shine Powell says. In the fall of 2023, Shine Powell spent her days asking the neighborhood to come forward with anything they might know about the shooting. But Shine Powell has not lived at Drake Street since her husband’s murder. “I never went back. Everything that was in there I left it there. Still, our memories are left there also. So, I just wasn’t able to go back there, so I gave up a place, a stable place to live so I could have a peace of mind,” Shine Powell says. For now, she stays with her sister and says her grandkids are giving her strength every day. She says hearing about other senseless deaths in the neighborhood brings her to tears. She remembers Lymont Powell as a kind and loving grandfather who is greatly missed by many. “We need to stick together, stop the violence and increase the peace. Because people are dying, and they are dying senselessly. This was a 51-year-old grandfather. He was loved, he was a husband, a brother, a cousin, an uncle and his life is gone for nothing,” Shine Powell says. Heyward is being held without bond because of the violent murder charge. He will likely appear for a bond hearing later in the year, but a date is not set. “I’m not going to miss a court date, I’m not going to miss a bond hearing, when you look around you are going to see me because you know who I am…I’m not going to say I’m not going to forgive you, but I am going to let you know you are forgiven but it’s not forgotten. And you will get your day in court and so will I,” Shine Powell says. Despite the hardship that has befallen Shine Powell in the months since she lost her husband she says she has hope for this case. “I know who, but I just really want to know why because he was a good person. But I probably will never find that out because I would never talk to the person one-on-one. Everything happens for a reason, I don’t know the reason for this happening right now, but we’re going to get justice and that’s what it’s about,” Shine Powell says. Copyright 2024 WCSC.

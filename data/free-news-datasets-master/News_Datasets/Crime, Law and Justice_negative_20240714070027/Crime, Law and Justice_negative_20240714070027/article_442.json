    "text": "BEAUFORT COUNTY, S.C. (WCSC) - The Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office alongside the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division arrested three men in connection to an ongoing human trafficking investigation. Alban Bryan, 63, of Saint Helena Island, is charged with first-degree trafficking in persons, victim under 18 years old and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Guy Frank Talley III, 27, of Okatie, is charged with first-degree trafficking in persons, victim under 18 years old, second-degree sexual exploitation of a minor and third-degree sexual exploitation of a minor. William James Youmans, 34, of Beaufort, is charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor and first-degree trafficking in persons, victim under 18 years old. Sometime between Feb. 1 and Feb. 13, Bryan recruited, solicited or transported a minor for sex trafficking purposes, court documents state. In the same timeframe, Bryan is also accused of housing and providing narcotics to a minor he knew was reported missing from her home on Saint Helena Island. Between Feb. 13 and March 5, Talley recruited, solicited or transported a minor for sex trafficking purposes. Talley also distributed, transported, received, sold, purchased or solicited sexual abuse materials, and he had media of a minor engaging in sexual activity on his cellphone, the arrest warrant states. Child advocates say the term “child sexual abuse material” is a more accurate reflection of the material involved in this type of crime, arguing the term “child pornography” could imply to some that the child was a consenting participant. The attorney general’s office says “child sexual abuse material” is being used more often globally for that reason. Sometime between Feb. 9 and March 5, Youmans knowingly contributed to the delinquency of a minor who was reported missing by the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office. He is accused of providing transportation and narcotics to the girl during this time, court documents state. Youmans is accused of recruiting, soliciting or transporting a minor for sex trafficking purposes. Bryan, Talley and Youmans were arrested and booked into the Beaufort County Detention Center on Tuesday. The 14th Circuit Solicitor’s Office will prosecute the case. The Beaufort Police Department, the Jasper County Sheriff’s Office, the Hardeeville Police Department and the U.S. Homeland Security Investigations assisted in the investigation. Authorities said the investigation is ongoing, and anyone with information is encouraged to contact SLED by calling 803-896-7400 or by emailing [tips@sled.sc.gov](mailto:tips@sled.sc.gov).

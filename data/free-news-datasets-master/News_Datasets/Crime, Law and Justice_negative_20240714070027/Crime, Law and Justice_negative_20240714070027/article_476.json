    "text": "A 40-year-old woman has been charged with murder following the death of a man in Auckland's Massey last night.\nAt around 11.20pm, police were called to Moire Rd following a report of a person struck by a vehicle.\n\"Despite efforts from first responders, the man sadly died at the scene,\" a spokesperson said.\nThe woman is due to appear in the Waitākere District Court today charged with murder.\nWaitematā Detective Senior Sergeant Nick Poland said it appeared to be an \"isolated incident\" and the victim and woman \"were known to each other\".\n\"As such, police are not seeking anyone else in relation to this matter.\"\nA St John Ambulance spokesperson said it responded to the incident with one ambulance, two rapid response vehicles and an operations manager.\nPoland said the community can expect to see an increased police presence in the area while further inquiries are carried out.\n\"A scene guard remains in place this morning and will likely continue throughout the day.\"\n\"Police will endeavour to provide further details around the identity of the victim when we are in a position to do so,\" Poland said.\n\"However, as this matter is now before the Court, we are limited in providing further comment.\"",

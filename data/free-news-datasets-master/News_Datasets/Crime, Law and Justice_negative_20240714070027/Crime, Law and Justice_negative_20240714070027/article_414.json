    "text": "By Geoff Rushton ,\n2 hours ago\nA Boalsburg woman is accused of stabbing her boyfriend during an argument early Thursday morning.\nState College police responded just after midnight to a home on the 100 block of Shrineview Avenue in Harris Township, where they found a man bleeding in the driveway. The man told police his girlfriend who lived there with him, 29-year-old Toshia M. Immel, stabbed him in the abdomen.\nImmel was angry with him for going to get food without her and accused him of cheating on her, he told police. He said she confronted him in the carport upon his return and that as he was trying to explain, she stabbed him, according to the affidavit.\nThe man was taken by Centre LifeLink EMS to Mount Nittany Medical Center. He had a one-inch stab wound in his abdomen, according to the affidavit. Police did not provide information on his condition.\nOfficers found Immel in a bedroom inside the house and took her into custody. She told police that the man treated her badly and that before he went out that night he asked her when she was moving out.\nShe said she went into their bedroom after he left and did not come out until police arrived, according to the affidavit.\nImmel is charged with one felony count of aggravated assault. one misdemeanor count of simple assault and a summary count of harassment.\nShe was arraigned by District Judge Gregory Koehle and was unable to post $50,000 bail. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for June 26.\nThe post Woman Accused of Stabbing Man in Boalsburg Home appeared first on StateCollege.com .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "(Photo : Tommy Dunagan's Facebook) EMS crews said the county coroner, Tommy Dunagan, refused to respond to the scene of a death because he already worked 20 hours that week. A coroner in [Colorado](https://www.hngn.com/articles/261389/20240612/youtube-star-ben-potter-comicstorian-cause-death-revealed.htm) who claims he's overworked is demanding a raise [from county leaders](https://www.hngn.com/articles/260155/20240429/suzanne-morphew-death-mother-day-missing-homicide-colorado.htm) or he'll stop [picking up bodies](https://www.hngn.com/articles/260835/20240521/police-working-zero-who-supplied-matthew-perry-deadly-ketamine-dose-friends-chandler-hot-tub-death.htm). Prowers County Commissioner Ron Cook told [9NEWS](https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/coroner-prowers-county-wont-pick-up-bodies-hes-not-paid-more/73-a63bfb55-94d9-4e1b-ae85-e758e04cd892) that he was surprised to get a call from EMS crews on June 1. Cook said he was informed that county coroner Tommy Dunagan was refusing to respond to the scene of a death because he had already worked his 20-hour work week and his deputy wasn't available over the holiday weekend. Dunagan stated that if county commissioners didn't want to get the person's body, it could just sit there until he was back on the clock. \"He did tell me that he couldn't go on Saturday and had nobody to take the call, and that he would respond the following day when he was back on call,\" explained Cook. Dunagan did eventually respond to the scene, but only when commissioners agreed to meet and discuss his salary. The coroner is currently paid part-time, though he works full-time hours and wants to be bumped up accordingly. \"I feel it's appropriate to call you guys because this is completely your decision,\" Dunagan said. \"It's no one else's decision whether I'm full-time or part-time.\" Under state law, commissioners cannot amend the coroner's salary again until 2026. Dunagan is considering the option of suing the commissioners, as well as requesting that Prowers County pay for his legal fees.",

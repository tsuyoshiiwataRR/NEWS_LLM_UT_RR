    "text": "Person of interest wanted in Mecca teen’s murder The Riverside County Sheriff's Office released information on a person of interest wanted in connection with the investigation into the murder of a 17-year-old earlier this year in Mecca. The murder was reported just after midnight on March 25, 2024, on the 71000 block of Miramar Drive. Deputies arrived and found evidence of a shooting nearby but initially did not find a victim or suspect. Deputies eventually found, Francisco Ramirez, 17, was found dead in the area of Sea View Way and 72nd Avenue, a little over half a mile away from where the shooting was reported. The investigation has remained ongoing for three months. On Thursday, authorities announced that David Espinoza, 20, of Mecca is a person of interest in the teen's death. Espinoza’s whereabouts are currently unknown, authorities said. Espinoza is described as a Hispanic male, standing 5 foot, 4 inches tall, weighing 135 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. He is wanted on an outstanding felony warrant for an unrelated robbery and assault with a deadly weapon investigation. The Riverside County Sheriff’s Office is seeking the public’s help with locating David Espinoza. Anyone with information about this investigation or Espinoza’s whereabouts is encouraged to contact Riverside Sheriff’s Central Homicide Unit Investigators R. Deanne or K Farag at 951–955–2777. Anyone who sees Espinoza or knows his immediate whereabouts should call 9–1–1.",

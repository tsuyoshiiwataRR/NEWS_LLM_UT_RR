    "text": "REPORT: East Tenn. principal knowingly approved incorrect timesheets From May until December, the principal was knowingly approving incorrect timesheets, totaling at least $1,844.08, according to the state investigation. CLAIBORNE CO., Tenn. (WVLT) - The principal of H.Y. Livesay Middle School knowingly approved incorrect timesheets, according to an investigative report by the Office of the Comptroller of the Treasury. A custodian was hired by the Claiborne County Board of Education in May of 2023. From then until December, the principal was knowingly approving incorrect timesheets, totaling at least $1,844.08, according to the state investigation. “According to the school principal, she authorized the former custodian’s timesheets, but each day the timesheet documented full daily shifts as worked, and the school principal allowed the former custodian to leave two hours early by 7:00 p.m. due to personal obligations,” the report stated. “The school principal stated she intended for the former custodian to make up unearned compensation hours during the summer, but the former custodian resigned prior to the summer months.” The custodian resigned in Jan. of 2024. WVLT News reached out to the school system for comment but has not received a response.

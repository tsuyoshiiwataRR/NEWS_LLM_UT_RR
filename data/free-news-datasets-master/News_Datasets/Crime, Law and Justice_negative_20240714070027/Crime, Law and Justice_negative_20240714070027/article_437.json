    "text": "KILLEEN, Texas â€” Editor's Note: The attached video aired in June 2023. A motorcycle hit and run investigation that left a Fort Cavazos soldier dead in 2023 has a new development, as one man was arrested in Bryan on Wednesday, according to Killeen PD . Police say they were able to identify the suspect, Kristopher Taylor Jr., 47, after an \"extensive joint investigation with the Fort Cavazos Criminal Investigation Division.\" On Tuesday, June 11, exactly one year after the hit and run crash, a case was presented to the Bell County District Attorney's Office charging Taylor with Collision Involving Death, a second-degree felony. Authorities were able to locate and arrest Taylor in Bryan with the assistance of the United States Marshals Service-Lone Star Fugitive Task Force the following day without incident.",

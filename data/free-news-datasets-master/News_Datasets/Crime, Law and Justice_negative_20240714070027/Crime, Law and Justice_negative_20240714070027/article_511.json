    "text": "By Jovonne Ledet ,\n1 hour ago Photo: Getty Images A Minnesota boy was killed while trying to protect his mother from his violent father.\nAccording to CBS News , eight-year-old Amir Harden was shot to death by his father last week. Harden's mother, Cherish Edwards , said her son was accidentally shot by her father, who was attempting to shoot her.\n\"[Amir] wanted to protect his mommy,\" Edwards said. \"It's just unimaginable, an 8-year-old trying to wrestle the gun out of a grown man's hand. It's unbearable pain.\"\nEdwards said she told her son to go outside but he refused to leave her side.\nAfter shooting his son, Edwards said the father shot himself while her four other children were watching. Harden's father is currently in the hospital with critical injuries.\n\"We're finally free of him, but my child paid the ultimate sacrifice,\" Edwards said. \"My children, all of them, I feel so bad for them. They are traumatized. It's going to take years, if it ever goes away.\"\nBurnsville, Minnesota police have launched an investigation into the incident. A spokesperson for the city said Harden's father may face criminal charges if he survives the shooting.\nEdwards issued a warning to women in similar domestic situations.\n\"It doesn't matter if he hit you 10 years ago, he's got to leave,\" she said. \"Next time that'd be your life or your child's life. I think a lot of women think it'll never be them.\"\nA GoFundMe campaign was started by Edwards to raise money for moving expenses and other bills.\nThe Black Information Network is your source for Black News!

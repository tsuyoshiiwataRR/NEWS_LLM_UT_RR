    "text": "Soon, the Judiciary Committee will consider promoting a magistrate in New York, Sarah Nutburn, to the District Court after a less than judicious committee process. Judge Nutburn&#039;s hearing was a contentious affair. You should go watch it. My friends, the junior senator from Louisiana and Texas had the judge dead. The rights on her judicial activism from the bench. She was clearly prepared for their line of questioning, but by the end, she wilted under the withering fire from my colleagues. That&#039;s when the acting chairwoman of the committee got involved. After Republicans were finished questioning Judge Nutburn, she invited the nominee to defend herself. Her defense, of course, flatly contradicted her written opinion. As a judge. Committee Republicans rightly objected. It&#039;s one thing to give a nominee the chance to rehabilitate herself. But giving her the last word as she lied to the committee is a different matter entirely. After the nominee gave two different explanations for why she had engaged in political activism from the bench, committee Democrats blocked further questions and close the hearing. It sounds an awful lot. Like the way another nominee, Adele Manji, explained his policy views to liberal interest groups. Only after the committee was finished questioning him, Judge Nutburn got the last word here. As the junior senator from Louisiana said, it looks an awful lot like a cover up. Apparently, it&#039;s not enough for Senate Democrats to rubber stamp radicals to the courts. They desperately don&#039;t want the American people to even know about it. Well, it&#039;s not working. The Judiciary Committee has received almost 100 letters. From liberals opposing Judge Nut Burns activism. The cat is literally out of the bag, so I would urge my colleagues to pay attention to what happens in the Judiciary Committee as Judge Network&#039;s nomination.",

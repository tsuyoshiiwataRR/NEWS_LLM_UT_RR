    "text": "Man connected to murder of 18-year-old Lakaria Moore pleads guilty LUBBOCK, Texas (KCBD) - On Thursday, a man who helped murder suspect Christopher Carter hide from police pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence. MORE DETAILS: [Second arrest made in connection with murder investigation of Lakaria Moore](https://www.kcbd.com/2023/08/11/second-arrest-made-connection-with-murder-investigation-lakaria-moore/) Jermaal Riggins, 38, turned himself into police on Aug. 11, 2023, over two months after the murder of 18-year-old Lakaria Moore. Police found evidence Riggins “altered, destroyed, or concealed evidence with the intent to make it unavailable as evidence.” Moore went missing on the night of May 21 after leaving a party with her boyfriend, 40-year-old Christopher Carter. She was believed to be in danger and the police asked the public for help. However, her body was later found in the trunk of Carter’s vehicle. The vehicle had been abandoned near North CR 3000 and East CR 6650. A murder warrant was issued for Carter’s arrest. The search for Carter stretched over the following two months before he was located at a motel in the 4100 block of 19th Street. Investigators tried to convince Carter to leave the room, but another man exited and stated Carter had shot himself. Authorities entered the room and found Carter’s body. After Carter’s death, Riggins was soon implicated in the case. Police also [arrested Tahdeejah Washington-Harris](https://www.kcbd.com/2023/08/02/lpd-woman-arrested-after-helping-murder-suspect-christopher-carter-hide-two-weeks/), who was accused of helping Carter avoid capture. On Thursday, Riggins pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. He has been sentenced to 15 years in prison and must turn himself into authorities by 5 p.m. on July 12. Copyright 2024 KCBD. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - A Kansas City man has pleaded guilty to charges connected to an incident in which he rammed into an ATF agent’s vehicle during an attempted search.\nU.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri Teresa Moore announced on Thursday, June 13, that Charles D. Jackson, 30, pleaded guilty to illegal possession of ammunition and assault of a federal law enforcement officer.\nCourt records indicated that on Aug. 4, 2023, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives executed a search warrant at a residence occupied by Jackson, a.k.a Grove Street or C Jackem. As agents walked up, a vehicle had also been pulled into the driveway to prevent a sedan parked and still running from leaving.\nWhen emergency equipment was activated and agents announced their presence, they said Jackson popped up in the driver’s seat of the sedan and attempted to escape. He rammed his vehicle into the ATF vehicle before it pushed it into the garage and disabled it.\nOn the driver’s seat floorboard agents said they found a loaded AR-style 5.56-caliber pistol with no serial number and an extended magazine that contained 39 additional rounds.\nCourt documents noted that Jackson had been convicted of felony robbery in the first degree, which made it illegal to possess any firearm or ammunition. He could now spend up to 16 years in prison without parole. A sentencing hearing has yet to be set.\nNo further information has been released.\nCopyright 2024 KCTV. All rights reserved.",

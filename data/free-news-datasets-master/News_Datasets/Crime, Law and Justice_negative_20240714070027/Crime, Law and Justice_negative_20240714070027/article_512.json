    "text": "A father who was arrested after allegedly pointing a gun at a coach during his son’s basketball game in Baltimore last year pleaded guilty to two firearm possession charges.\nTroy Antwaun Spencer, 49, of Baltimore, was accused of aiming the gun at a coach during the March 6, 2023, Leith Walk Elementary Middle School basketball game in North Baltimore’s Ramblewood neighborhood, according to court documents, which also state that Spencer was confronting the coach over his son not getting enough playing time.\nOne of the coaches entered into a physical altercation with Spencer on the sidelines, according to court documents, and Spencer pulled the loaded Taurus G2C 9mm sem-automatic handgun from waistband and pointed it at the coach.\nA representative of the law firm defending Spencer declined to comment.\nThe first of the two charges, possession of a firearm and ammunition by a prohibited person, carries a maximum prison sentence of 15 years, while the second charge, possession of a firearm in a school zone, carries a maximum of five years. The United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland and the defendant agreed upon a recommended sentence of between 57 and 96 months — about four to eight years — in prison. The sentencing will be Sept. 4.\nSpencer is prohibited from possessing a firearm due to a 1997 second-degree murder conviction, according to court documents.",

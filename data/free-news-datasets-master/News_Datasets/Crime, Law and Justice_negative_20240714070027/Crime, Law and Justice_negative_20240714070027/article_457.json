    "text": "Over my lifetime, l have sworn an oath to protect and defend the Constitution and the nation’s laws. My public service and my oath were given willingly with my solemn commitment to honor that oath. I have been honored to serve the public, as have many Americans, some of whom have given the last measure with life and limb.\nDonald Trump took that same oath. Now it is revealed that Donald Trump has committed crimes that violated his oath of office. He was found liable for rape and was ordered to pay damages to the woman he molested after defaming her. He was unanimously convicted by a jury of his peers for 34 felonies. His many business failures and scams, along with his craven lies about the election being stolen, are there for all to see. The man has three more extremely serious felony indictments pending. Concerning, yes. But here’s my bigger concern going forward.\nYou cannot serve in the U.S. armed forces if you are a felon. You cannot receive a security clearance if you have a felony conviction. You cannot travel to many foreign countries because those countries will not permit entry to a convicted felon. You cannot own a firearm with a felony conviction. You cannot vote in an election with a felony conviction.\nAll kinds of major problems ahead. Donald Trump is running for president as a felon with more pending felony indictments. He likely cannot vote for himself. He cannot receive a daily security briefing. He cannot travel to many foreign nations. He cannot be a respected, honorable leader as commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces. Most of all, he cannot be a person that I can ever point to as a decent, honorable person that my grandchildren should emulate. That’s who is seeking to be president of the United States. It’s more than concerning, it is alarming.\n— Dave Jensen\nAnchorage\nHave something on your mind? Send to or click\nhere to submit via any web browser.

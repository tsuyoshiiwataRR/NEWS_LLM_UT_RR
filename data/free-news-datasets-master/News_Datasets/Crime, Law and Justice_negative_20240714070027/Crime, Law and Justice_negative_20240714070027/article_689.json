    "text": "*heavy HBCU sigh*\nSource: Zack Wittman for The Washington Post via Getty Images / Getty\nThe saga behind the curious case of Batterson Seventh Family Trust CEO Gregory Gerami and the $237,750,000 donation he pledged to Florida A&M University continues as the ‚Äúbusinessman‚Äôs‚Äù show of philanthropy is still looking more and more dubious the more we learn bout it. According to the Miami Herald , the donation no one seems to be able to prove exists ‚Äîwhich has already resulted in administrative resignations, infighting between members of FAMU‚Äôs board of trustees, an announcement by FAMU President Larry Robinson that the gift transaction has been ‚Äúceased,‚Äù and the revelation that a person cited on Batterson‚Äôs website as the co-CEO of the company never actually worked for the company ‚Äîis under even more scrutiny now that an email from the donor‚Äôs bank has raised yet another red flag indicating that the historic donation may not be legitimate.\nFrom the Herald:\nInternal emails recently released by the university to The Sun News show that weeks before donor Gregory Gerami presented an oversized check at FAMU‚Äôs graduation ceremony, a Raymond James Financial Services executive told FAMU officials that previous assurances they provided of Gerami‚Äôs account balance were not accurate.\n‚ÄúOn February 1 and March 1, 2024, Raymond James issued a letter to client, Gregory Gerami, reflecting the balance in his account,‚Äù Kirk Bell, a senior vice president at Raymond James, wrote on April 12. ‚ÄúEffective April 10th, 2024, Raymond James will no longer provide a value for the securities in Mr. Gerami‚Äôs account and no longer stand by the verification of deposit letter you may have received.\n‚ÄúTo the extent that Mr. Gerami has or does provide you with official account statements from Raymond James, we do not believe the pricing of certain securities was accurate.‚Äù\nAt some point, it just becomes really difficult to look at a thing that seemed too good to be true from the start and not finally say: ‚ÄúNah ‚Äîthis gotta be a scam.‚Äù\nI wanna give Gregory Gerami a Presidential Salute ü´°\nAs CEO of a hydroponic and hemp manufacturing company in Texas.\nHe gifted FAMU with a $237M surprise donation during graduation ceremony!\nIt is the largest in donation in HBCU history! üôåüèæ pic.twitter.com/sRkydtxlgN\n‚Äî President Shun üá∫üá∏ (@PresidentShun) May 5, 2024\nOf course, in the case of Gerami and his elusive ‚Äúgift‚Äù to FAMU‚Äîcan it even really be called a scam? Grifters typically do what they do for financial gain. If Gerami is a grifter, what‚Äôs the grift? What‚Äôs the end game in pledging nine figures he, apparently, doesn‚Äôt have to a college just to turn around and say, ‚ÄúSike, made you look‚Äù after allowing administrators to make a public show of receiving the donation they never actually received?\nLast month, former Tallahassee mayor and FAMU alum Andrew Gillum called Gerami a ‚Äúhoaxer,‚Äù which would certainly be more accurate, but, still, the question is ‚Äî why?\nStill, Gerami has been standing by his word that what appears to be a phantom donation is, in fact, real. According to the Herald, FAMU‚Äôs investigation into the donation is set to be completed by Aug. 30.\nThe board of trustees hired Buchanon, Ingersoll, and Rooney law firm to conduct the investigation and it‚Äôs being overseen by the Florida Board of Governors.",

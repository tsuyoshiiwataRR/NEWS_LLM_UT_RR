    "text": "A gunman wounded two people before fatally shooting himself inside an East Harlem NYCHA development Thursday, police said.\nThe 45-year-old shooter opened fire inside a Johnson Houses apartment building on E. 112th St. near Lexington Ave. about 12:20 p.m., cops said.\nA downstairs neighbor told the Daily News they heard a “boomy” six to nine shots.\n“With these walls, you can hear everything,” the neighbor said.\nThe gunman shot his 40-year-old ex-girlfriend and her 19-year-old son before turning the gun on himself, according to police sources.\nThe shooter and his two victims were rushed by medics to an area hospital, where the gunman died. His name was not immediately released.\nPolice believe the gunman flew off the handle after his ex-flame called it quits, according to the founder and CEO of domestic violence organization We All Really Matter, who was briefed on the shooting.\n“We’re sick and tired of the violence happening in our community every day,” said Stephanie McGraw. “It was a boyfriend, It was someone she was involved with.”",

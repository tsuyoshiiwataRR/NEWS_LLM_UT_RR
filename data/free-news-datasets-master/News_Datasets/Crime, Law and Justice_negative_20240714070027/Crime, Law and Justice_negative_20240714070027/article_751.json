    "text": "Readout of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement meeting with private detention contractor\nWASHINGTON — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement leadership met with CoreCivic leadership June 12. In a constantly changing environment, it’s increasingly important for the agency to engage with detention contractors, which helps officials ensure that detained noncitizens’ needs are being met while ensuring the continued understanding of our changing mission space and the shared responsibility of appropriate care for those in custody.\nThe agency’s ability to detain people who pose public safety threats or otherwise require detention and remove them to their home countries is directly dependent on location and availability of detention space. ICE continues to modernize the immigration system as resources allow to realize cost efficiencies across the operational landscape.\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement engages with stakeholders nationwide, including state, local, tribal and territorial governments, elected officials, law enforcement, the private sector, faith-based organizations, and colleges and universities.",

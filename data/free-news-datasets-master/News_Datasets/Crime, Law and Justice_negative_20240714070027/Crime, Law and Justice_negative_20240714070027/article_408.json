    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said they suspect that a 7-month-old overdosed on fentanyl earlier this month. Dispatchers received a 911 call about an unresponsive child apartment complex in the Spring Park neighborhood on June 5, police said. The agency said officers immediately began emergency measures to establish what was affecting the baby and began providing emergency medical care. Jacksonville Fire & Rescue Department emergency personnel arrived and administered Narcan to the child, taking him to Wolfson Children’s Hospital. The child was released to a family member after several days, officers said. A family member claimed his son swallowed a cigarette butt in the common area of the complex. JSO and the Department of Children and Families are investigating and the DCF is monitoring the well-being of the child, police said. JSO said they suspect a fentanyl overdose and added \"This is just one example of many cases JSO is working involving suspected child overdoses where young children have gotten into illegal narcotics or prescription medications.\" Anyone with information regarding the incident is asked to call JSO at 904-630-0500, email JSOCRIMETIPS@Jaxsheriff.org or contact Crime Stoppers at 1-866-845-TIPS.",

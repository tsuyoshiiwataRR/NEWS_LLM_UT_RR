    "text": "JACKSON, Miss. ( WJTV ) – A search for two Louisiana girls, who were abducted after their mother was killed, has ended tragically in Mississippi.\nJackson Police Chief Joseph Wade said the suspect at the center of an Amber Alert , 36-year-old Daniel Callihan, was captured on Boozier Drive off of McCluer Road in Jackson after a chase.\nAccording to Wade, 4-year-old Erin Brunett was found deceased in a wooded area. Her sister, 6-year-old Jalie Brunett, was taken to a Jackson hospital for treatment.\nWitness describes fatal shooting near Hal’s St. Paddy’s Parade during trial “Horrible, horrible, tragic situation. You don’t want to see that as a chief. You don’t want to see that as a father, to see this baby that is on the ground that has lost her life. This is an innocent 4-year-old child that’s no longer with us because of the actions of a coward, a coward who took this child from her family,” said Wade.\nThe Jackson police chief said there was evidence of possible human trafficking at the location on Boozier Drive, including small animal cages. Wade said Jackson police have contacted the Human Trafficking Divisions of the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation (MBI) and Hinds County to assess the scene.\nDaniel Callihan (Courtesy: Rankin County Sheriff’s Office) Daniel Callihan captured in Jackson, Miss., on Thursday, June 13, 2024.

    "text": "Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) listens as ranking member Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) speaks during a House Judiciary Committee markup of the report &quot;Recommending that the House of Representatives Cite Attorney General Merrick Garland for Contempt of Congress&quot; at the Rayburn House Office Building on May 16, 2024 in Washington, DC. On June 13, 2024, a motion to subpoena Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg prompted a dispute between Jordan and Rep. Matt Gaetz. A motion to subpoena Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg sparked a clash between Republican Representatives Matt Gaetz and Jim Jordan. A House Judiciary Committee hearing was held on Thursday, as some Republicans have sought to investigate Bragg over his successful criminal case brought against former President Donald Trump, related to hush money paid to adult-film star Stormy Daniels in 2016. Shortly after the hearing began, Gaetz proposed a motion to subpoena Bragg and Assistant District Attorney Matthew Colangelo. New York Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler objected the motion, calling it &quot;a little absurd,&quot; noting that Bragg and Colangelo agreed to appear before a hearing from the Judiciary Committee on July 12. &quot;Mr. Bragg and Mr. Colangelo have agreed to come on the 12th ... If they don&#039;t show up on the 12th, they will be subpoenaed. I would ask the gentleman if he could withdraw the motion,&quot; Jordan said following Nadler&#039;s objection. Responding to his Republican colleague, Gaetz declined to remove his motion: &quot;I&#039;ve made a motion to subpoena these people now, pursuant to the rules, and I want to vote on my motion, or I want someone to move to table it.&quot; Jordan then attempted to halt a possible vote on the motion but the hearing went to recess shortly afterward. Upon returning, Gaetz announced that he was willing to withdraw his motion. In a statement to Newsweek, Gaetz said, &quot;Chairman Jordan and Rep. Nadler firmly believe Bragg will show up and answer our questions without a subpoena.&quot; &quot;I don&#039;t share that confidence, so I would like to issue the subpoena immediately and enforce it rigorously,&quot; Gaetz said. A Manhattan jury late last month convicted Trump of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records regarding the payment to Daniels during his first presidential campaign in an effort to conceal an alleged 2006 affair. Trump is appealing the verdict and denies that the affair occurred and any wrongdoing, calling the case politically motivated. Since Bragg&#039;s investigation of Trump, the district attorney has faced widespread criticism from many Republicans, including Jordan, who&#039;s pushing to &quot;examine Alvin Bragg&#039;s political prosecution of President Trump&quot; and explore politically motivated state and local prosecutions. Earlier this week, a spokesperson for Bragg&#039;s office confirmed to Newsweek that he and Colangelo would be appearing before the House Judiciary Committee on July 12. &quot;The Manhattan D.A.&#039;s Office is proud to play a crucial role in upholding and enforcing the rule of law for the people of New York,&quot; the spokesperson told Newsweek. &quot;It undermines the rule of law to spread dangerous misinformation, baseless claims, and conspiracy theories following the jury&#039;s return of a full-count felony conviction in People v. Trump. Nonetheless, we respect our government institutions and plan to appear voluntarily before the subcommittee after sentencing.&quot; Newsweek reached out to Jordan representatives via email for comment.

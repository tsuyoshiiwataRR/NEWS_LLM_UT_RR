    "text": "Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich attends a Finance committee meeting at the Knesset, on June 10, 2024 NEW YORK – In a Thursday afternoon post on X, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that he signed an order transferring about $134 million from the Palestinian Authority’s (PA) frozen funds to victims of terrorism. Smotrich described the order, which he signed on Sunday, as an act of “historical justice,” saying that the PA “encourages and favors terrorism by paying the families of terrorists, prisoners, and released prisoners.” “By the judgments that awarded compensation to the victims of terrorism, we offset the same amounts from the PA’s funds and transfer the awarded money to the families of the victims of terrorism,” Smotrich added. On Thursday, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller described Smotrich’s order as “not appropriate” and “an extraordinarily wrongheaded decision by the minister.” US State Department criticizes move by Smotrich “We have made quite clear to the government of Israel that these funds belong to the Palestinian people. They should be transferred to the Palestinian Authority immediately,” Miller stressed. “They should not have been held. They should not be delayed.

Blinken ordered the State Department to start examining the possibility of US and international recognition of a state of Palestine the day after the Gaza war ends.

The Jerusalem Post reached out to a spokesperson for Smotrich for comment.",

    "text": "A Casper man is facing sexual assault charges for allegedly smoking meth and then raping a women in his basement. Marcus Dean Grayson, born in 1984, made his preliminary appearance at the Natrona County Circuit Court on Tuesday and is charged with sexual assault in the first degree and sexual assault in the second degree. Following the hearing, Grayson's case was bound over to district court. The first degree penalty is punishable by five years to fifty years in prison. The victim alleges that she was giving Grayson a ride to his home and that he asked her to come inside. Grayson’s wife was not home at the time, according to an affidavit. On the basement’s couch Grayson smoked meth out of a pipe; the alleged victim denied using meth at that time, according to an affidavit. People are also reading… The alleged victim told police that Grayson “forced himself” onto her and that she broke two nails while punching Grayson. The victim “had been wearing light colored, high-waisted jeans with one button and a long zipper,” and a “soft, brown and fuzzy hoodie that was short,” the affidavit states. The affidavit stated that officers observed the victim “did have several broken nails on both of her hands.” After the encounter the victim messaged Grayson saying that he “should listen when I said no the million times I said no,” the affidavit said. A search of the victim’s phone revealed that Grayson apologized profusely after the event through text messages. “I’m freaking out right now like I did something wrong — like terribly wrong,” Grayson messaged, according to the affidavit. “ I just flushed everything I had and I'm getting — out of here to do this. Nobody should have come home to it.” The victim declined to have a sexual assault forensic exam done. Search warrant Police conducted a search warrant on Grayson’s home a week later and conducted an interview with Grayson’s wife — who told police that Grayson told her about the incident after two unknown men showed up at the home. The wife told police that the victim wanted “Grayson to give her meth for the ride and Grayson did not have any. [The victim] got angry and left.” She additionally told officers that Grayson told her that he and the victim were “never intimate and she was trying to get money out of him by accusing him of sexual assault.” Police recovered a marijuana vape pen and a “one hitter” and swabbed the couch in the basement. Interview with Grayson Grayson told police in an interview that the encounter was consensual and that he and the victim flirted while smoking meth together. He additionally told police that the victim “had brought meth with her which was packaged in a small twisted plastic bag.” Grayson told police that following the encounter they smoked more meth together and kissed before she left. Grayson additionally told police that two men showed up at his door and he received text messages asking for money. One message from the victim said something to the effect of “send money to CashApp or this goes public,” and another message from an unknown number describing the incident as messed up and adding that “I need some bread.” A police search through Grayson’s phone found that all messages and calls had been deleted — except for the messages with the victim and his wife. Police also found that all camera footage of Grayson’s home on the day of the footage had been deleted — except for the video of the two guys that showed up at his home. A detective noted that messages on Grayson’s phone to the victim “appeared to be ‘edited.’” David Velazquez is a reporter at the Casper Star-Tribune and can be reached at 307-301-0506, or at [david.velazquez@trib.com](mailto:david.velazquez@trib.com)",

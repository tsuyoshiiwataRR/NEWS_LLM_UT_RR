    "text": "Killeen police arrest suspect in 2023 fatal hit and run BRYAN, Texas (KWTX) - The Killeen Police Department has arrested a suspect involved in a 2023 fatal hit and run. Kristopher Taylor Jr., 47, was arrested and charged with collision involving death, a second-degree felony. On June 11, 2023, at around 2:30 a.m., police were sent to the 1900 block of East Elms Road on reports of a crash. When officers arrived on scene, police say paramedics were helping a man lying in the road with serious injuries. Police say the injured man, identified as Eric Rucker, would die due to his injuries. A preliminary investigation by police showed that two motorcyclists were driving westbound on East Elms Road when Rucker dropped an item in the roadway. Police say both motorcyclists stopped their vehicles and got off their motorcycles to get the item when Rucker was struck by a passing vehicle. A joint investigation with the Fort Cavazos Criminal Investigation Division helped investigators identify Taylor as the suspect in the case. On June 13, 2024, authorities found Taylor in Bryan and arrested him. Taylor was taken to the Brazos County Jail where he is pending arraignment. Copyright 2024 KWTX. All rights reserved.",

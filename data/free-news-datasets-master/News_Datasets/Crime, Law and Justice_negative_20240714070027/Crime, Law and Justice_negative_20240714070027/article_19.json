    "text": "WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) – Representative Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) and five other Democratic lawmakers held a press conference Thursday to push for tighter gun laws.\n“We are ready to work with anyone in good faith,” Neguse said.\nThe Congressional Gun Violence Protection Task Force called for universal background checks, safe storage laws and preventing the illegal trafficking of guns.\n“We have more mass shootings than we have days in the year,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif).\nTheir calls came a day after Congress paused for a moment of silence, to honor the 49 people who died in the Pulse Nightclub shooting in 2016. Wednesday marked eight years since the shooting.\nOn Tuesday, high school graduates in Newtown, Connecticut remembered the 20 classmates who didn’t graduate, because they died in the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012.\n“I do feel like, for the first time, the gun violence prevention movement is stronger than the gun lobby,” said Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.).\nMeanwhile, last month, former president Donald Trump spoke at the NRA convention, encouraging voters who care about gun rights to vote this November.\n“Let there be no doubt: the survival of our Second Amendment is very much on the ballot,” Trump said. “If the Biden regime gets four more years, they are coming for your guns.”\nDemocrats believe public opinion is on their side about this issue.",

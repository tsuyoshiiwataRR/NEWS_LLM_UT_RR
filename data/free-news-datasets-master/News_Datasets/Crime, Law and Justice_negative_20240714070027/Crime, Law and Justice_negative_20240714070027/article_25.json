    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Calgary police say they've identified the suspect in a hate-motivated incident that took place outside the Central Library in late April and charges are pending. On April 28, three women left the library at 800 Third Street S.E. around 5 p.m. walking toward the City Hall CTrain station, when they were confronted by a woman shouting obscenities and aggressively gesturing at one woman in the group. The victim, who was the target of the woman’s verbal attack, instructed her friends to move to a safer location while she asked the suspect to leave them alone. Instead, the woman continued to follow the victim while continuing to shout at her. She also tried to burn her face with a lit cigarette followed by striking her in the face and throwing a travel-style coffee mug at her. The victim kept walking, eventually reaching a safe space where she called police to report the incident. “Based on the disparaging remarks this woman used, it is clear that this incident was motivated by hate,” said Calgary police hate crimes co-coordinator Const. Matt Messenger, in a media release. “The victim was with a group of friends who were going about their day in our city, and have now been left feeling scared, humiliated and discriminated against all because of who they are. This is unacceptable.” Late Thursday afternoon, hours after they made the suspect's photo public on social media, police updated their original media statement to the news that she had been identified. Anyone with information is asked to contact police at 403-266-1234. Those wishing to remain anonymous can contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477, online or by downloading the P3 Tips app. Calgary Top Stories CTVNews.ca Top Stories DEVELOPING Two potential tornadoes in Quebec, warning lifted for Ontario Tornado warnings have been issued describing 'dangerous and potentially life-threatening' situations amid severe thunderstorms in Ontario and Quebec.

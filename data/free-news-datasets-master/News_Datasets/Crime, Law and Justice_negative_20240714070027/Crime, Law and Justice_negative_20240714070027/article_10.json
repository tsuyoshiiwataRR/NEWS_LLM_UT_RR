    "title": "Million-dollar reward on offer over 1980 murder of Melbourne woman Maria James in her bookstore",
    "text": "A $1 million reward has been announced for information to help solve the 1980 murder of a woman in her Melbourne bookstore. Maria James was killed on High Street, Thornbury, on Tuesday, June 17, 1980. She lived with her two sons at the property where she was killed, which also functioned as a second hand bookstore. On the morning of her murder, she was seen by a number of witnesses in and around the property. At about 11.55am, she called her ex-husband John and left a message asking him to call her back. She did not say why she wished to speak with him, but she did say somebody was in the shop. A short time later, John returned her call. Maria asked him to \"hold on\" and was overheard speaking with somebody else. Although John couldn't clearly hear the conversation, it was apparent something was wrong, and when Maria didn't return the call, he left work and went to check on her. He arrived at the bookshop shortly after midday to find the front and back doors locked, but with the \"open\" sign still on display. He forced his way inside and found Maria dead in her bedroom with a large number of stab wounds. She had sustained significant injuries to her head and face, and her hands had been bound. Soon after finding Maria's body, John realised the front door of the shop was now unlocked - suggesting somebody may have been inside when he arrived. Two separate eye witnesses described a man running away from the crime scene soon after Maria's body WAS found. This man has never been identified and police continue to appeal for information in relation to the man, and are again releasing images in the hope someone can provide information about his identity. The case has been to inquest twice, in 1982 and 2021, and on both occasions returned an open finding. Victoria Police today announced a $1 million reward for information in relation to the person or people responsible for Maria's death in the hope it will provide new leads and result in the offender being held to account. A reward of $50,000 was previously offered in 1980. \"While it has been more than four decades since Maria was murdered, detectives have not given up hope that this case can be solved,\" Detective Inspector Dean Thomas said. \"If you have information then we want to hear from you, no matter how insignificant or irrelevant you think it is. \"After 44 years, Maria's sons deserve answers and police remain as committed as ever to being able to give those to them.\" The million-dollar reward will be paid at the discretion of the Chief Commissioner of Police, for information leading to the apprehension and subsequent conviction of the person or persons responsible for the death of Maria James. The Director of Public Prosecutions will consider, according to established guidelines, the granting of indemnification from prosecution to any person who provides information as to the identity of the principal offender or offenders in this matter. Investigators are hopeful this new reward will encourage someone to come forward with information and despite the passage of time, believe there are still people out there who can help solve this. Police urge anyone with information about Maria's death to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential report online .

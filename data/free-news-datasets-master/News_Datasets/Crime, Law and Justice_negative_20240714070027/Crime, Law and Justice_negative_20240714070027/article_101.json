    "text": "CEBU, Philippines — Four persons allegedly involved in illegal drug operations were arrested in separate buy-bust operations Wednesday night in the cities of Cebu and Mandaue.\nJoint operatives of Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) Cebu Provincial Office and Labangon Police Station arrested alleged drug den operator Rey-Jan Jalo-ag, 38, during a buy-bust operation in Barangay Labangon at around 7 p.m. on Wednesday, June 12, 2024.\nAuthorities also arrested Jay B. Pateño, 31, and John Marvel Punay, 30, who were found inside the drug den during the operation. Seized from the suspects were four packs of suspected shabu worth P81,600 and drug paraphernalia.\nNarcotics agents placed Jalo-ag under surveillance for one week after receiving tips from concerned citizens that he was operating a drug den. Based on initial investigation, authorities found that Jalo-ag could dispose of 20 to 50 grams of shabu every week.\nA buy-bust operation was immediately hatched resulting in his arrest and two of his customers. They will be facing criminal complaints for violation of Republic Act 9165 or Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act.\nMeanwhile, an alleged drug courier was arrested in Barangay Casuntingan, Mandaue City past 10 p.m. on Wednesday for selling illegal drugs to undercover policeman. The suspect was identified as Christopher Caparida Alforque, 20, a resident of Sitio Tarcom, Barangay Lahug, Cebu City.\nAccording to the authorities, the suspect had been a subject of two weeks surveillance after his name was mentioned by drug suspects previously arrested. Based on the initial investigation, Alforque is capable of disposing at least 50 grams of shabu every week.\nAlforque reportedly admitted that he started transporting illegal drugs last month. He claimed that for every successful delivery he gets P2,000 as payment.\nAuthorities seized from his possession three packs of shabu weighing 100 grams each with an estimated value of P2.1 million.\nAlforque is now temporarily detained at the Casuntingan Police Station while a criminal complaint for violation of Sec. 5 and Sec 11, Art 2, of RA 9165 is being readied. — John Mark Dejito/ FPL (FREEMAN)",

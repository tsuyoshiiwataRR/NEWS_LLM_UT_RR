    "text": "DALLAS — Dallas-based telecommunications company\nFrontier Communications is facing class-action lawsuits after a data breach compromised the information of nearly 90,000 Texans, according to court records and a notice filed with the Texas Attorney General’s Office.\nAccording to a breach report submitted to the Office of the Maine Attorney General, a total of at least 751,000 were impacted by the Frontier data breach, court documents show.\nThe report filed with the\nTexas Attorney General’s Office Monday shows the types of information affected including names, addresses, social security numbers, and dates of birth. Texas law requires businesses or organizations that experience a data breach of system security affecting 250 or more Texans to report the breach to the attorney general’s office no later than 30 days after the breach is discovered.\nFrontier has millions of residential and commercial customers across 25 states.\nAccording to the latest of six lawsuits, which was filed Wednesday, the data breach occurred on or around April 14 and Frontier began sending notice letters on June 6.\nThe latest lawsuit alleges Frontier customers were and continue to be at risk of identity theft and other harm as a result of the data breach.\n“Plaintiff and Class Members must now and for years into the future closely monitor their medical and financial accounts to guard against identity theft. As a result of Defendant’s unreasonable and inadequate data security practices, Plaintiff and Class Members have suffered numerous actual and concrete injuries and damages,” the lawsuit alleges.\nWFAA has reached out to Frontier for comment. We’ll update this story as additional information becomes available.",

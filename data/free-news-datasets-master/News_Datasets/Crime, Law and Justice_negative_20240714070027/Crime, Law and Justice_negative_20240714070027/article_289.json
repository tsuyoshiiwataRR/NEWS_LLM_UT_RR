    "text": "Marion County officials are hosting a press conference next week to provide details on a felony arrest made for illegal dumping in the Ocala National Forest that they described as a “groundbreaking development in the ongoing battle against litter.”\nThe press conference will take place on Monday, June 17, at 10 a.m. in the McPherson Government Campus auditorium (601 SE 25th Avenue) in Ocala.\nAccording to the county, the individual(s) in question “negatively impacted” other citizens across the county with their actions.\n“Those who will be convicted have negatively impacted Marion County’s environment, natural beauty, and quality of life for its residents,” reads a statement from the county.\nAccording to the statement, the press conference will feature “key figures” who have played a role in “bringing justice to [the] illegal dumping case.”\nThat includes officials from the U.S. Forest Service, Florida Fish and Wildlife Division of Law Enforcement, and elected officials, among others.\nThe press conference is another example of the county’s attempt to highlight organizations and individuals who impact litter in Marion County, whether good or bad.\nLast month, county officials presented a “Litter Hero”\n100,000 pounds of trash from the Ocala National Forest.",

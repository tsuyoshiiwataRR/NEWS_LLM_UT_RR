    "text": "The executive director of Columbus, Georgia’s Pride organization was arrested Wednesday after police discovered a trove of drugs, paraphernalia and a .38 revolver at his home. Police say Jeremy Hobbs, age 49, was the subject of a months-long investigation that resulted in a search warrant for his home where investigators found and seized 5.4 grams of crack cocaine, 20.7 grams of methamphetamine, 23.8 grams of liquid GHB and an INA .38 revolver.

He’s been charged with possession of those substances and “drug-related objects,” as well as possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime.

Hobbs’ arrest has rocked the tiny Pride organization he headed. Colgay Pride [released a statement](https://www.facebook.com/COLGAYPRIDE/) Wednesday night in response to Hobbs’ arrest. “The board of the Debra Smith Wellness Center, Inc., doing business as Colgay Pride, expresses our utmost concern and regret regarding the arrest and charges facing our Executive Director, Jeremy Hobbs,” said Harry Underwood, vice president of communications for the 501(c)(3) org. “The charges which have been filed against him are serious,” Underwood’s statement continued. “The board does not condone the alleged actions and we will cooperate with law enforcement in the coming investigations regarding our operations and finances.” Hobbs pleaded not guilty to the charges at an arraignment hearing on Wednesday and remains in custody pending a $25,000 bond. Police obtained a search warrant for Hobb’s’ residence in Columbus, the same listed address for Colgay Pride, the non-profit that Hobbs founded and runs. Colgay Pride celebrated its 11th Annual Columbus Georgia Pride Festival on June 1 with a tiny parade that wrapped around a square block on Broadway in Uptown Columbus. Earlier this month, Hobbs announced a Pride partnership for the 2025 festival, joining with Phenix City, Alabama across the Chattahoochee River. “Together, we’re creating the first-ever Bi-City and Bi-State Pride Festival — a momentous occasion that transcends borders and celebrates love, acceptance, and unity,” Hobbs posted to Facebook. In the wake of Hobbs’ arrest, Colgay Pride isn’t waiting for a determination of their leader’s guilt or innocence. “Our organization will meet to discuss our next steps, including a transition in leadership and strategy in the interim period,” Underwood wrote on the org’s Facebook page. “Our events and operations are on hold until further notice.” “With humility,” Underwood added, “we ask for the understanding and solidarity of the local community in this period. We apologize to our allies, colleagues and partners for the distress caused by these developments.” Don't forget to share:",

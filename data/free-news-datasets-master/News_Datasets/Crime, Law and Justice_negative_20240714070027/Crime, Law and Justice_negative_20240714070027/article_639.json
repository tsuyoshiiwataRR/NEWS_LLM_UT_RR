    "text": "BARNESVILLE, Minn. (Valley News Live) - A long-time coach in Barnesville, Minnesota, has resigned from his coaching position. The head coach of the girls basketball team, Ryan Bomstad, submitted his resignation on May 20. In his resignation letter, Bomstad said Barnesville Girls Basketball has been one of his top priorities for the last 12 years. “As life progresses and circumstances change, I feel it is necessary to focus much of my energy on other avenues of life. It is time to watch my children grow up and be at their events being a dad. It has been extremely tough missing my kids’ events to coach others,” Bomstad wrote. He thanked the coaches who have been part of the program, as well as the kids, parents and fans. Valley News Live has received dozens of Whistleblower calls and emails throughout the 2023-2024 school year, claiming Bomstad was verbally abusive toward players. One community member who wanted to remain anonymous told Valley News Live “all of the girls on the team have said they will quit next year if this issue is not resolved quickly.” Another community member said complaints had been filed against Bomstad, writing to Valley News Live: “Concerned parents have reached out to the AD, superintendent, and principal requesting his removal due to his offensive and disrespectful comments towards the players. It is crucial to take action and report these actions to the school administration. Please report on this as it is public knowledge.” Someone claiming to be a parent of a girls basketball player wrote to Valley News Live: “Someone needs to report on this because the girls need a voice. I can speak for my junior and that she is considering not coming out for basketball. I am using a fake name as I do not want my daughter ousted for us speaking out. Call the school demand to see the improvement plan.” Valley News Live contacted Barnesville Superintendent Jon Ellerbusch several times throughout the school year, requesting the personnel and disciplinary files for Ryan Bomstad. On May 7, Ellerbusch responded to Valley News Live by writing: “The School District is aware of complaints concerning Mr. Bomstad” and “The complaints are presently under review by the administration.” Bomstad resigned as the coach on May 20. Valley News Live has reached out to Ryan Bomstad for comment, but has not received a response back. Copyright 2024 KVLY. All rights reserved.",

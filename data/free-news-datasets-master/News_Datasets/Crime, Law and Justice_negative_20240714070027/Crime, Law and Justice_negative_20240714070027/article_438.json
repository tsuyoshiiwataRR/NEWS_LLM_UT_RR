(WCSC) - The South Carolina Board of Education determined a Dorchester School District Two band director will have her certificate suspended for a year after alcohol was found in her belongings. A lawsuit heard by the state board on Tuesday references an incident from March 23, 2023. The suit claims Hannah Maile Carlson was employed at Gregg Middle School at the time of the incident. The suit claims Carlson reported to a school nurse she had passed out. The administration came to the nurse’s office with a school resource officer, where staff noticed she smelled strongly of alcohol. The water bottle Carlson was carrying was determined to contain alcohol, according to the suit, and other empty and full containers of alcohol were located in Carlson’s belongings. Dorchester School District Two officials confirmed Carlson is no longer employed with the district. The board determined in their ruling that Carlson was believed to engage in unprofessional conduct and her suspension will expire on June 10, 2025. Copyright 2024 WCSC. All rights reserved.",

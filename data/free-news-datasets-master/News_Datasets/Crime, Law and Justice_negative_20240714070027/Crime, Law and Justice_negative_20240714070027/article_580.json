    "text": "[Crime & Safety](/california/lakeelsinore-wildomar/police-fire) Woman Killed By RivCo Deputy ID'd As Imperial Beach Resident The 30-year-old woman died at a local hospital. An alleged accomplice from San Diego County is facing a murder charge in her death. CORONA, CA — A woman who was shot and killed this week in Corona by a Riverside County Sheriff's deputy amid an alleged violent confrontation was identified Thursday as an Imperial Beach resident. Jennifer Dobbins, 30, was shot just after 1 a.m. Tuesday in the 1600 block of W. 6th Steet and was pronounced dead a short time later at Riverside County Hospital, according to the Riverside County Sheriff-Coroner's Bureau. An investigation into the shooting death was continuing. Under state law, the California Department of Justice investigates fatal law enforcement shootings of unarmed civilians.

It's not clear why the deputy wanted to speak to the people, but instead of cooperating with him they allegedly ran off. The law enforcement officer chased them on foot but when he turned a corner, a man from the group \"lunged at him and a fight ensued,\" according to the sheriff's department. As the deputy struggled with the suspect, \"a female began assaulting the deputy,\" the department continued. The deputy fired his weapon and the woman — later identified as Dobbins — was hit by gunfire. \"The deputy continued to fight off the male suspect who was attempting to take his firearm,\" the agency said. Bystanders intervened and helped the deputy detain the unarmed man. He was identified as Eric John Nourani, a 33-year-old San Diego County resident. Dobbins was taken to the hospital, where she was later pronounced dead. The deputy suffered moderate injuries in the alleged melee and was sent to a hospital. Nourani sustained minor injuries, according to the sheriff's department. Nourani was booked into Riverside's Robert Presley Detention Center where he remains held in lieu of $2,080,000 bail. He was formally charged with murder, attempted murder of a peace officer, as well as sentencing enhancements of causing great bodily injury, mayhem, resisting/deterring an officer, and resisting arrest as to cause death or serious injury to an officer. He was scheduled for arraignment Thursday afternoon. Court records show Nourani has no criminal history in Riverside County. Per Riverside County Sheriff's Department policy, the Lake Mathews-based deputy will be placed on paid administrative leave. The location where the incident occurred is near bordering jurisdictions of the Lake Mathews Sheriff’s Station and Corona Police Department, according to sheriff's Sgt. Wenndy Brito-Gonzalez.

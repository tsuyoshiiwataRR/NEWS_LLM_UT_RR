(KMIZ) The Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office is still looking for the SUV that [injured a cyclist in a hit-and-run ](https://abc17news.com/news/montgomery/2024/06/03/sheriffs-office-man-lays-injured-near-bridge-for-13-hours-after-hit-and-run-in-montgomery-county/)and caused him to lay injured near the Loutre River Bridge for 13 hours on May 29-30. The first name of the victim has not been released, but a Thursday press release refers to him as “Mr. Koch.” Deputies were called at 9:12 a.m. May 30 for a report that a man on a bicycle had fallen over the concrete barrier railing on the west side of the bridge. The victim had allegedly told deputies that he was riding his bike at 8 p.m. May 29 while heading north on Highway 19 near Hermann. Previous reporting indicates that while Koch was crossing the bridge, “a gray SUV traveling south on Highway 19, veered onto the shoulder, heading towards the victim. To avoid being struck, the victim jumped off his bicycle and over the concrete barrier of the bridge, resulting in a fall of approximately 22 feet. The gray SUV fled the scene of the incident.” The victim was found 13 hours later while two people walking along Highway 19 heard his calls for help, previous reporting indicates. Thursday’s release says the sheriff’s office is asking the public for any other information about the SUV. “I also wish to inform the public that we are treating this case as a top priority. I know this incident has garnered significant attention and I want to assure the Koch Family and the public that we are working diligently to uncover all relevant facts and ensure justice is served. We are committed to bringing clarity and resolution to this case and to holding accountable those responsible,” the release says. “As part of our investigation, we have made numerous requests for surveillance footage from various sources.”",

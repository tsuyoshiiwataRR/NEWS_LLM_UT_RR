    "text": "WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - A Wichita woman accused of shooting and killing her teenage son in January has pleaded guilty to the crime. The Sedgwick County District Attorney’s Office confirmed Kylee Hodges entered the plea in the death of her 14-year-old son, Claude Hodges, Jr. Police were called to Aspen Park Apartments on January 29 for a welfare check. The teenager’s father, Claude Hodges, Sr., said Kylee and Claude, Jr. failed to show up for a custody exchange and he couldn’t get ahold of his son. When Wichita police arrived at the complex, they found a hole in the wall and a bullet on the ground. Following an hours-long standoff which ended up with Kylee Hodges being shot by police , officers made their way inside the woman’s apartment where they found Claude Hodges, Jr. in a bedroom dead from a gunshot wound. According to a probable cause affidavit , the incident may have stemmed from a custody dispute in which Claude, Sr. would have been given more custodial time with his son. Kylee is due back in court in July for sentencing. Copyright 2024 KWCH. All rights reserved. To report a correction or typo, please email news@kwch.com",

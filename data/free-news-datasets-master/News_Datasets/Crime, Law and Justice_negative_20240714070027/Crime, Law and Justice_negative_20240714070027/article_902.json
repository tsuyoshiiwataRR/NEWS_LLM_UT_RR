    "text": "DOUGLAS, Ga. (WALB) - A man charged in a fatal Coffee County hit and run in 2019 has changed his plea to guilty, according to court documents.\nDustin Jordan was originally charged in Febraury 2019 after he reportedly hit John Pond , 27, of Willacoochee, on Willacoochee Highway leading to his death. Video collected from nearby businesses helped law enforcement identify Pond.\nJordan originally pleaded not guilty on July 14, 2021, however, on June 12, 2024, he withdrew his last plea and pleaded guilty to homicide by vehicle -leaving the scene, court documents confirmed.\nIt is currently unclear if his plea to the charge of hit and run remains or has been changed.\nJordan will appear at a sentencing hearing on Aug. 7. This hearing comes after an agreement over five years of prison time was not agreed upon by both sides in the case, according to the Coffee County Superior Court Clerk’s Office.\nStay with WALB News for updates.\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction?

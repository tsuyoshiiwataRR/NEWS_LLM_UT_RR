    "text": "1 of 2 missing children found dead after mother ‘brutally’ slain; suspect arrested LORANGER, La. ( [WVUE](https://www.fox8live.com/2024/06/13/2-young-girls-missing-after-mother-found-dead-loranger-sheriff-says/)/Gray News) - Authorities in Louisiana say one of two missing children has been found dead while the other was found alive and well. The Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office reported the recovery of 3-year-old Erin Brunett’s body Thursday afternoon. Her 6-year-old sister, Jalie Brunett, was found alive and well. The suspect, Daniel Callihan, was arrested in Jackson, Mississippi. Police found the 6-year-old alive in Mississippi, with Callihan, according to authorities. Erin’s body was a few yards from where her sister was found alive. She was taken to the hospital for treatment of minor injuries. Her grandparents are on their way to Jackson to be with her. “You don’t want to see that as a police chief; you don’t want to see that as a father,” said Chief Joseph Wade from the Jackson Police Department. “A coward took this child from her family.” The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and Jackson Police Department are also involved in the investigation. The Louisiana State Police issued an Amber Alert for the two children after finding their mother dead early Thursday morning. According to the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office, 35-year-old Callie Brunett was missing for over 24 hours before being found found “brutally” slain in her home on North Cooper Road. Her death is being investigated as a homicide. Her two small children, 6-year-old Jalie and 3-year-old Erin were “unaccounted for,” Sheriff Daniel Edwards said. Edwards said Brunett was reported missing Tuesday and because her car was not at her house, her family did not believe she was home. Thursday morning, her father made entry into her home and discovered her body and her children missing. The manner of Brunett’s death was not disclosed, but Edwards said there was “blood everywhere.” Copyright 2024 WVUE via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "One dark early morning last October, a woman stumbling away from a night of drunken revelry stepped into a busy roadway in Clearwater Beach. A police officer in an unmarked SUV pulled up with red and blue lights flashing. He told her she was being “disorderly” and told her to get in his vehicle. She did as he said.\nWhat occurred in that car in the 30 minutes thereafter is the focus of a trial that opened this week in a Pinellas County courtroom, where ex-Clearwater Officer Nicolas Paloma stands accused of raping the 32-year-old tourist.\nThe trial comes a mere eight months after Paloma was fired and arrested. The city’s police chief described his actions as a shocking “betrayal of trust” that damaged the reputation of all law enforcement officers.\nA jury will weigh whether to find Paloma, 30, guilty of charges of sexual battery and bribery.\nSeated at a defense table, Paloma appeared forlorn, sometimes scowling or furrowing his brow as a prosecutor portrayed him as a cop who’d abused his power to get what he wanted from a vulnerable woman. The state noted that he’d turned off his car’s GPS and body-worn camera before the incident.\n“He took advantage of his position of authority as a law enforcement officer,” Assistant State Attorney Samantha McIntyre told the jury. “He did all the wrong things that night.”\nAssistant State Attorney Samantha McIntyre points to former Clearwater police Officer Nicolas Paloma during her opening statements in his trial Wednesday in Clearwater. Paloma is charged with sexual battery and bribery after stopping a tourist along Clearwater Beach in October of last year. [ CHRIS URSO | Times ] The Tampa Bay Times is not naming the woman due to the sensitive nature of the allegations.\nPaloma, who had no history of trouble in the five years he worked for the Clearwater Police Department, didn’t deny that he’d had a sexual encounter with the woman. But his defense attorneys argued that what occurred that early morning was not rape.\nThey noted inconsistencies in what she told police immediately after the incident, including a statement that she didn’t care about what had happened. They also noted that she did not try to leave, and when a friend called her phone, she said nothing about being in danger or trouble. They claimed the woman was “flirtatious” when she’d first seen Paloma at a bar earlier that night, and tried placing a $20 bill in his uniform, which the woman adamantly denied.\n“(The woman) made a series of choices and actions that led to alcohol-induced consensual sexual acts with Mr. Paloma,” defense attorney Katie Ingram told the jury.\nDefense attorney Katie Ingram speaks to the jury during her opening statements in the trial of former Clearwater police Officer Nicolas Paloma on Wednesday. [ CHRIS URSO | Times ] The woman, a married mother of two, was the first witness prosecutors summoned to the courtroom. Short and slight with long brown hair and glasses, she testified for most of Wednesday, at times dissolving into tears.\nWant breaking news in your inbox?

They arrived on Oct. 13, a Friday, and checked into a room at the A.C. Marriott Hotel, steps away from Clearwater’s sugar sand beaches. They went out for dinner and drinks that first night in St. Petersburg, where her friend stumbled over a construction barricade, injuring her ankle.\nAfter an overnight hospital visit, they returned to the hotel, slept and spent the day lounging poolside, then went to bars and restaurants along Coronado Drive and Gulfview Boulevard. They drank cocktails, seltzers and beer. She became increasingly intoxicated.\nA little after midnight, they stood outside Coco’s Crush Bar, discussing where they wanted to go next. It was there that they first encountered Paloma.\nThe officer was off duty but in full uniform as he completed a security shift at the bar.\nThe woman recalled chatting with him about which businesses stayed open late.\nThey went to another bar. Sometime close to 2:30 a.m., her friend complained of pain to her injured ankle and wanted to take an Uber back to the hotel. They began to argue, but the woman didn’t remember why. Her friend walked off. The woman tried to follow her. She couldn’t see the crosswalk at the roundabout near Mandalay Avenue. She stepped into the road.\nPaloma pulled up in his unmarked police SUV. He rolled down a window, told her she shouldn’t be crossing there. She said she was trying to get to her hotel. She remembered him telling her that if she crossed the road it would be “disorderly.” He told her to get in the vehicle.\n“I felt like I would be arrested if I didn’t listen to him,” she said.\nShe got in the passenger seat. He told her he’d take her to the hotel, she said, but asked what she could do for him. But immediately, she said, Paloma drove across a bridge, into the city. It was dark. She remembered faint orange lights.\n“I just remember panicking and freaking out and saying, ‘Please stop. You’re going the wrong way,’” she said.\nShe remembered him saying something about taking her to a place where there were no cameras.\nShe told him she needed to use the restroom. He pulled into a darkened area, told her she could go in the bushes. She did, then returned to the passenger seat. He told her he didn’t mean to go across the bridge.\n“I thought, maybe I’m just overthinking it,” she said. “It is a police officer.”\nFormer Clearwater police Officer Nicolas Paloma, left, is seen in a Clearwater courtroom Wednesday. Paloma is charged with sexual battery and bribery after stopping a tourist along Clearwater Beach in October of last year. [ CHRIS URSO | Times ] She told him the name of her hotel. He said he knew where it was, and began to drive while making “small talk,” she said. As they drove, he reached out and touched her inappropriately, she said. She sat still, gazing out the window. She said she felt helpless to resist.\nHe parked in a construction area. It was dark. She didn’t know where she was. He undid his police vest and duty belt, and pulled down his pants. It was implied, she said, that he wanted her to commit a sex act.\n“I felt I had to do what he wanted,” she said. “As a police officer, he was the only one in control of the situation. I had no way to protect myself.”\nWhen it was over, she said, she again asked to go to her hotel. He pointed, telling her it was nearby. She got out and walked a short distance to the lobby, where her friend waited.\nShe confronted her, angrily, about leaving her behind. She shoved her friend. A hotel security officer noticed the commotion and called police.\nOfficers arrived wearing the same uniform as the man she’d just encountered. She was uncomfortable, felt they didn’t believe her.\nPolice would later find her phone in Paloma’s vehicle.\nOn cross-examination, defense attorney Roger Futerman questioned her about why she didn’t leave. She reiterated that she felt she had no choice. She couldn’t remember if the car door was locked. She didn’t know where she was.\nShe was tired, still intoxicated and highly uncomfortable in the lengthy police interviews that followed. She didn’t know who to trust.\nTo much of what the defense attorney asked, she said she simply couldn’t remember.\nThe trial is expected to last through Friday.\nTimes staff writer Brandon Kingdollar contributed to this report.",

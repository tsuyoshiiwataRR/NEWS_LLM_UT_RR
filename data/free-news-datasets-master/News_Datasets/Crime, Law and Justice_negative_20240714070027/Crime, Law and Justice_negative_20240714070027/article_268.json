    "text": "NEW YORK , June 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\nWhy: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADSK ) between June 1, 2023 and April 16, 2024 , both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), of the important June 24, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm.\nSo what: If you purchased Autodesk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\nWhat to do next: To join the Autodesk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24019 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than June 24, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\nDetails of the case: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Autodesk, Inc. lacked adequate internal controls as a result of issues with its free cash flow and non-GAAP operating margin practices; and (2) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\nTo join the Autodesk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24019 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for information on the class action.\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm or on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm .\nAttorney Advertising.

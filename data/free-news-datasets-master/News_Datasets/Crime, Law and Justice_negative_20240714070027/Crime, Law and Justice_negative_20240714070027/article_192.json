    "text": "CNN anchor Jim Acosta continued to put the spotlight on convicted felon Donald Trump’s violent rhetoric. On Wednesday, [Acosta suggested](https://crooksandliars.com/2024/06/trump-fundraiser-headline-haul-out) we’ve become too numb to it when he noted that nobody else was making a big deal out of Trump’s fundraising email with a giant, highlighted headline, ‘HAUL OUT THE GUILLOTINE!” On Thursday, Acosta asked Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell for his response. “Well, as someone who's had a lot of those death threats aimed at me and at my colleagues, we're not going to be intimidated,” Swalwell first replied. “But we do prefer voting over violence.” Swalwell argued Trump’s violent rhetoric is a sign of his desperation. He didn’t even mention Trump’s recent conviction on 34 felonies in his summary of Trump’s long losing streak! Trump’s best day was in November, 2016, Swalwell said, meaning the day Trump won the 2016 presidential election. “He has been a serial loser since.” Swalwell counted the ways: “He lost the House in 2018. He lost the White House and the Senate [in 2020]. We kept the House in 2020. In 2022, that big red wave that was supposed to come did not come. In fact, we added a seat in the Senate.” On top of that, most of Trump’s endorsements failed last year, Swalwell noted. He cited Democratic victories in Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia. Trump is “on a losing streak, so he’s choosing violence,” Swalwell added. “And that's what this upcoming election is very much going to be about,” Swalwell continued. “Who do we prefer? A person of character or a person who has felony convictions but lacks any moral conviction?” Swalwell on Trump: \"His best day was in November of 2016, and he has been a serial loser since ... he doesn't have the votes, so he's choosing violence.\" [pic.twitter.com/5P0g3CAMA3] — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) [June 13, 2024]",

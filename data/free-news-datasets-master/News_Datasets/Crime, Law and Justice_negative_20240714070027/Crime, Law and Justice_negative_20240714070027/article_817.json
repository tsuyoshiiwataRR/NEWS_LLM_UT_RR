    "text": "The Dubuque man who died from a self inflicted gunshot wound as police were prepared to serve an arrest warrant for sexual abuse was a middle school teacher who allegedly took advantage of a 14-year-old. Dubuque Police say the body of Trent Paschal, a Thomas Jefferson Middle School teacher, was found in his home shortly after officers heard a gun go off Wednesday. An arrest warrant was issued for Paschal after Dubuque school resource officers conducted an investigation over the relationship with the student. Police say the two, \"exchanged text messages and SnapChats of a sexual nature,\" and that Paschal picked the student up twice from the student's neighborhood, \"then gone back to his residence where the two engaged in sex acts.\" Traffic camera video on May 27 shows him picking the student up before midnight and driving to his apartment. The Dubuque Police Department strongly encourages any victims of sexual abuse to file a report with your local law enforcement agency. Anyone with information related to this investigation should contact Investigator Kurt Rosenthal at 563-587-3808 or krosenth@cityofdubuque.org.",

    "text": "Two individuals have been apprehended by the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Katsina State for their involvement in separate cases of vandalizing public infrastructure.\nAccording to the NSCDC’s Public Relations Officer, DSc Buhari Hamisu, the first suspect, Ma’aruf Yusuf, aged 20 and a resident of Makudawa Quarters in Katsina metropolis, was caught by the NSCDC anti-vandal team for damaging streetlight cables at Mangagarin Makudawa in Katsina LGA.\nYusuf was accompanied by two others, Aliyu (also known as Chakal) and Haduwa, who managed to flee upon the arrival of the NSCDC’s anti-vandal patrol team.\nDespite attempting to resist arrest by threatening the team with a knife, Yusuf was eventually subdued and confessed to using a digger and shovel to remove the streetlight cable.\nFurther investigations revealed that the group had also stolen electric wire from the same location and sold it to scrap dealers at Kofar Guga Garage in Katsina metropolis, with transactions totaling 10kg for N8,000 and 15kg for N7,500.\nIn a separate incident, Gaddafi Sani, a 25-year-old student at Umaru Musa Yar’adua University, Katsina, was arrested by the NSCDC Katsina Command for allegedly tampering with electrical fittings in a male hostel.\nDuring his arrest at the command’s headquarters, it was disclosed that Sani had stolen electric wires from the ceiling of a room in Block D of the male hostel, where he was caught in the act by a university staff member.\nAside from the stolen wires, items recovered from Sani included scissors, a small flashlight, five rolls of insulated copper wire, and eighteen rolls of electrical cables.\nCommending the efforts of his team, NSCDC Commandant Jamilu A. Indabawa urged residents of Katsina to abide by the law and assured them of the command’s dedication to combating vandalism and other criminal behaviors. The Corps also called on the public to provide actionable intelligence to aid in the apprehension of criminals.",

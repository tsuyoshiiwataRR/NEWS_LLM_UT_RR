First Amendment expert Timothy Zick, a professor at William & Mary Law School, discusses the First Circuit ruling that a school can ban a student tee shirt that says, There are only two genders. June Grasso hosts. The part about the student T-shirt is at 12:25. Here is an article explaining the case from The Boston Globe , Federal appeals court sides with Middleborough schools after they barred student from wearing demeaning shirt : A federal appeals court has sided with public school administrators in Middleborough who barred a seventh grader from wearing a T-shirt with the phrase There are only two genders for violating the schools dress code, which bans hate speech. In a 70-page decision written by Chief Judge David J. Barron, a three-judge panel of the First Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled the students constitutional right to free speech is limited in the school setting and that administrators acted properly to ensure that LGBTQ+ students were not psychologically harmed by speech demeaning [their] gender identities. In making its assessment of how disruptive the Shirt would be on the educational atmosphere, Middleborough was not acting on abstract concerns, Barron wrote. Administrators knew the serious nature of the struggles, including suicidal ideation, that some of those students had experienced related to their treatment based on their gender identities by other students, and the effect those struggles could have on those students ability to learn. Liam Morrison was a seventh grader at the John T. Nichols Jr. Middle School when he wore the shirt on March 21, 2023, according to the ruling. Administrators noticed what he was wearing, pulled him aside, and told him he needed to remove the shirt if he was going to attend classes that day, the decision said. The full decision is here . The chief judge David Barron is an Obama nominee as was O.R. Thompson . The last judge in this case, Lara Montecalvo , is a Biden nominee.

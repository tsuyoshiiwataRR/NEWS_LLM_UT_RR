    "text": "Horse killed in Saunders County crash; man suspected of driving under the influence ASHLAND, Neb. (KOLN) - A Fremont man is accused of driving his vehicle into a horse and killing it while under the influence. The Saunders County Sheriff’s Office arrested 33-year-old Brandon Schneckenberger in late May. He’s charged with criminal mischief, refusing to submit to a test, assaulting an officer and failing to stop and render aid. On May 29, Ashland Police got a call about a hit and run. An officer stopped a vehicle in regards to that call near Highway 66 and Bills Drive in north Ashland. Schneckenberger, later identified as the driver and sole occupant, was placed under arrest and sat in a patrol vehicle. Authorities photographed Schneckenberger’s vehicle and spotted horsehair stuck in the windshield and severe damage to the front passenger side, according to an arrest affidavit. Deputies said an empty shooter bottle was also recovered from the vehicle. While at the scene, authorities learned that a horse had been struck by a vehicle in the area. The horse died, and its rider was taken to an Omaha hospital. Deputies tried getting a breath sample from Schneckenberger, but refused to give one twice, court records show. Authorities also allege that Schneckenberger made a deputy’s finger bleed during a search of his person. Further investigation showed that Schneckenberger had been driving without registration and proof of insurance, according to deputies. He had also been convicted of DUI on three previous occasions. Schneckenberger was arraigned on the charges in early June. His bond was set at 10% of $50,000, which was posted on June 4. His next court appearance is scheduled for July 11.

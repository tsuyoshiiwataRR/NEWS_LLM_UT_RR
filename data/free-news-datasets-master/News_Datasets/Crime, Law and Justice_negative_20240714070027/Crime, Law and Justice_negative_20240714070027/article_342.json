    "text": "Prosecutors file motion on victim information in Clovis double murder, kidnapping case CLOVIS, N.M. (KFDA) - Federal prosecutors filed a motion Tuesday to block the double murder and kidnapping suspect in Clovis from sharing sensitive information on the victims. Court documents state the order prohibits defendant [ 26-year-old Alek Collins](https://www.newschannel10.com/2024/05/06/clovis-police-hold-news-conference-with-update-missing-10-month-old/) from sharing materials produced in preparation for trial that would violate the victims’ rights to privacy. The motion states the defense is prohibited from sharing materials such as reports, medical records, photographs, and identifying personal information about the victims. A federal grand jury indicted Collins May 29 on kidnapping of a minor and discharging a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. Collins is accused of killing two women, injuring a 5-year-old girl and [kidnapping a 10-month-old girl](https://www.newschannel10.com/2024/05/04/two-women-shot-dead-near-clovis-amber-alert-issued-victims-daughter/). The 10 month old was found by authorities on May 6. A criminal complaint also revealed new details in the double murder and kidnapping. On May 3, Samantha Cisneros and Taryn Allen were found dead with multiple gunshot wounds at Ned Houk Park in Clovis. The 5-year-old was also found at the park and taken to an area hospital. Court documents state witnesses told investigators they had seen a maroon car parked across from an older van. A police officer [found a maroon car part](https://www.newschannel10.com/2024/05/07/new-details-released-arrest-clovis-double-murder-kidnapping-suspect/) at the scene. Court documents state a GPS monitoring system showed the maroon car, rented out to Collins, traveled from Houston to Clovis. The GPS data showed the car arrived at the park entrance May 3 around 3:29 p.m. and left around 3:38 p.m. GPS data showed the car avoided major highways. Documents state the car arrived at an address in Abilene, Texas around 11 p.m. May 3. The car continued to ping at that location through May 5. The car’s owner reported the car as stolen after officials say Collins failed to turn it in on time. The car’s owner remotely disabled it. Law enforcement conducted surveillance at the home on Harwell Street in Abilene and early on May 6, saw a man push a maroon car out of a garage onto the street. While law enforcement were preparing to execute a search warrant, they observed an Uber driver driving a Cadillac SUV arrive on the street in front of the home. Documents state Collins left the home carrying a baby and placed the baby in the rear passenger seat of the SUV. Collins got into the front passenger seat then carjacked the SUV at gunpoint. The driver was forced out of the vehicle and Collins drove away with the child. Officers with the Abilene Police Department Narcotics Unit chased and pinned the SUV, forcing it to stop. Documents state Collins was arrested and the baby was recovered safely. Documents state Collins is not the parent, grandparent, sibling or uncle of the baby and does not have custody of the baby. Documents also revealed Collins had previous contact with the FBI in 2023. Collins reached out to the FBI in Sept. 2023 and reported he wanted assistance from law enforcement with finding his daughter and made threatening statements. The FBI contacted local law enforcement until the Brazoria County Sheriff’s Office made contact with Collins and brought him in for a mental health evaluation. On October 10, 2023, Collins contacted the FBI and stated that if law enforcement did not assist him with finding the missing 5-year-old daughter, he would “start killing people and children.” An NICS alert was put in place to alert law enforcement if Collins attempted to buy a firearm. Documents state Collins was prohibited from buying a firearm in Texas as a result of his mental health evaluation. Court documents state law enforcement interviewed Collins in 2023. Collins stated during the interviews that he did not possess weapons and did not intend to cause harm, but he used the statements to draw attention to get help finding his daughter.

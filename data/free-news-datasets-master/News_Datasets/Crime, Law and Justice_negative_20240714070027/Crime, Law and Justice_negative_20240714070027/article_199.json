The man was living with the children and their mother in Danielskuil near Postmasburg.\nThe case emanates from an incident in 2018 when the mother of the two girls left the man with her children as she went looking for their elder brother who had allegedly been stabbed, National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Mojalefa Senokoatsane said.\nThe man went to their mother's bedroom where they were sleeping and raped them.\nThey reported the incident to their aunt, who immediately informed their mother. The man was arrested and charged.\n“During the trial, the two children were able to point out the accused in court. They demonstrated the way the accused had covered their mouth with his hand when they cried and detailed the pain they felt when he was raping them.”\nAfter the state closed its case, the defence also closed its case without calling the man to testify.\nIn sentencing, the court was satisfied with the evidence by the state witnesses including the medical evidence.\nTimesLIVE",

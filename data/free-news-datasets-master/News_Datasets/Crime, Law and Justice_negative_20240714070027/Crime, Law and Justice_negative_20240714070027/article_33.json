    "text": "In short: A 38-year-old gay man said he felt like an \"easy target\" 10 months after an attack in a Sydney car park. A couple pleaded guilty to assault occasioning bodily harm after Borna Kazerani was kicked in the stomach and testicles, and punched in the face. Mr Kazerani said he thought homophobia was related to the assault, which left him feeling not \"100 per cent secure\". Borna Kazerani escaped a country that punishes homosexuality with death. But now, the Iranian-born filmmaker's sense of safety in his adopted home of Australia has been shaken.\nDuring a visit to a popular Sydney market one Sunday last August, the openly gay man was met with homophobic slurs and fists.\n\"I wear eye makeup, so I was probably an easy target for these people,\" Mr Kazerani, 38, said.\nHis attackers were a couple in their 20s from Sydney's north-west. One was the mother of a four-month-old boy.\n\"They started punching my face, they shoved my chest, and then I fell,\" he said.\nThe violence erupted about 12:30pm in the Parklea Markets car park, according to court documents.\nMr Kazerani and a friend were heading back to his vehicle when a black SUV overtook them.\nIn the passenger seat was 23-year-old tradesman Cortez Solomon. His 21-year-old girlfriend, Paris Te Atahu Makene Stone, was driving.\nA friend of Borna Kazerani was able to capture photos of the Parklea assault. ( Supplied )\nAfter passing the pedestrians, Mr Solomon turned and gave Mr Kazerani the finger. Mr Kazerani shrugged and kept walking.\nThe car stopped and Mr Solomon got out. Despite his girlfriend's protests, he confronted Mr Kazerani about walking in the middle of the road.\n\"Sorry, I didn't know this is a two-way roads [sic],\" Mr Kazerani said.\n\"So what motherf***er?\" Mr Solomon replied.\nThen came the anti-gay insults. Mr Solomon called Mr Kazerani a \"homo\" and \"pooftah\" before shoving him in the chest.\nMr Solomon started punching Mr Kazerani in the head and face while kicking him in the testicles.\nMr Kazerani tried to push him away, and his friend began taking photos of his attacker and the car.\nMs Makene Stone exited the vehicle and tried to separate the men by pulling on Mr Kazerani's hair.\nMr Kazerani pushed the woman away, prompting Mr Solomon to launch another flurry of punches.\nMr Kazerani fell to the ground and the couple kicked him in the ribs before driving off.\nHe was left with a swollen jaw, dizziness and bruising around his eyes and nose.\nMr Kazerani called triple-0, but he said the police never came.\nBorna Kazeran with a black eye after the assault.\n\"That was the biggest problem because I contacted the police and they said they were short on staff,\" he said.\nHe ended up taking himself to Castle Hill Police Station to report the assault.\nTwo weeks later, officers arrested Mr Solomon at the couple's home in Riverstone.\nMr Solomon claimed Mr Kazerani was the aggressor and told police he only assaulted him to protect his girlfriend.\nDuring a police interview, Ms Makene Stone admitted she kicked the victim in the stomach.\nMr Solomon and Ms Makene Stone were charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Both pleaded guilty.\nIn November, Mr Solomon was sentenced to an 18-month community correction order and ordered to perform 50 hours of community service.\nOn Thursday Ms Makene Stone was handed a community correction order of 15 months.\nHer barrister, Varinder Pawar, told Blacktown Local Court that at the time of the assault, the young mother was undergoing treatment for depression after giving birth to her son.\nBut Magistrate Brian van Zuylen said Ms Makene Stone's postpartum depression did not justify her kicking someone on the ground, describing her role in the fight as \"pretty cowardly\".\n\"I'm not sure it's the right way to stop [the fight] by pulling out his hair,\" Magistrate van Zuylen said.\nOutside court, Ms Makene Stone apologised for the attack and denied it had anything to do with homophobia.\n\"I'm very open with all that kind of stuff,\" she said.\nMr Pawar said his client was \"extremely sorry\" for the assault.\n\"Something like that will never happen again and she extends her apologies to the victim involved,\" he said.\nMr Kazerani, who also works as a language interpreter for courts, watched Thursday's sentencing hearing.\nHe told the ABC he did not believe the assault was unrelated to homophobia.\nHe added he now felt less secure in Australia, which he regarded as \"kind of\" open-minded.\nBut Mr Kazerani said he was satisfied with his attackers' punishments.\n\"It shows that if everyone stands up for their rights, especially LGBTQ community members, they can get what they're looking for as justice,\" he said.\nPosted 3m ago 3 minutes ago Thu 13 Jun 2024 at 9:00pm Share\nCopy link\nFacebook\nX (formerly Twitter)",

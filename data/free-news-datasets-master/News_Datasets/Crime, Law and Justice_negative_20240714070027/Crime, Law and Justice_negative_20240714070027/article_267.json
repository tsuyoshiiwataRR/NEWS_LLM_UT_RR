An Orbeez gun fires small, colorful, water-absorbing beads.\nOne notable incident occurred on Gloucester Township Day at Veterans Park, where juveniles reportedly used these guns to target animals. Another significant occurrence involved juveniles firing from a moving vehicle at pedestrians on Tuesday. The suspects, five in total, captured their actions on social media.\nToday, Wednesday, at 3 PM, police received additional reports of two males and a female using an Orbeez gun to shoot at unsuspecting pedestrians. This case is currently under investigation.\nIn response to these events, the Gloucester Township Police Department is urging parents and guardians to discuss the potential dangers of these toy guns with their children. Misidentification of these toys as real guns could pose serious safety risks.\nThe police are taking a firm stance on this issue, promising to identify, arrest, and charge those misusing the toys to instill fear or cause disturbance among the residents of Gloucester Township.\nArrest Made in Baltimore Homicide Cases BALTIMORE, MD - Following a detailed investigation into the homicides that occurred on June 2, Baltimore detectives have apprehended Munir Dawan Matin, a 36-year-old Baltimore resident, for his alleged involvement in two separate shootings.\nMatin is accused of the fatal shooting of 32-year-old Terrell Johnson-Smith on June 2, in the 900 block of Pennsylvania Avenue, and the murder of 34-year-old Jarmal Harrid on the same day, in the 500 block of West Mulberry Street.\nThe arrest occurred on June 10, when the Warrant Apprehension Task Force located and detained Matin in the 400 block of Fallsway. He was subsequently transported to the Central Booking Intake Facility, facing two counts of first-degree murder among other charges.\nThis arrest follows an earlier report of gunshots on June 2 around 5:02 PM, where police were alerted to the 900 block of Pennsylvania Avenue by both gunshots and a ShotSpotter activation. At the scene, they found a male victim, later identified as Johnson-Smith, with multiple gunshot wounds. Despite immediate medical attention, he was pronounced dead at the hospital.\nMonessen Couple Arrested for Child Endangerment MONESSEN, PA - A couple from Monessen has been arrested following the discovery of their children living in severely neglected conditions. The Monessen Police, in collaboration with the Westmoreland County District Attorney's Office, charged Jerimiah Roberts and Felicia Dugan with endangering the welfare of children, a felony.\nThe investigation began on June 10 when police were called to the couple's residence on Park Manor for a welfare check on two small children. Upon arrival, officers spoke with Roberts at the door, who stated that the children were staying at a relative's house and that Dugan was asleep on the couch.\nPolice subsequently made contact with Dugan, who led them to an upstairs bedroom where the children were found sleeping. The conditions in the bedroom were appalling, with feces and old food on the floor, along with flies and fleas. The two-year-old children appeared to have bite marks on their bodies and faces and were visibly dirty.\nA witness informed police that Dugan frequently locked the children in the bedroom to prevent them from roaming around the house.\nFollowing these discoveries, both Roberts and Dugan were arraigned and placed in the Westmoreland County Prison.\nThree Arrested in Kent County Drug Bust DOVER, DE - Delaware State Police have arrested three men from Magnolia, Delaware, following a prolonged drug investigation in Kent County. The individuals arrested include 19-year-old Algahgaa Ata, 23-year-old Maddyan Ata, and 52-year-old Khaled Ata, all facing multiple charges related to drug dealing.\nThe investigation, which began in November 2023, was conducted by the Kent County Drug Unit and Delaware Alcohol and Tobacco Enforcement (DATE). The focus was on three businesses: Ali Baba Smoke Shop and Ali Baba 2 Smoke Shop in Dover, and Liberty Happy Gas Station in Magnolia. These locations were suspected of being involved in large-scale drug distribution.\nOn June 11, detectives stopped a vehicle driven by M. Ata near Magnolia. A search of his car revealed a loaded handgun, about 17 grams of marijuana, and $5,915 in cash believed to be drug proceeds.\nSimultaneously, search warrants were executed at the aforementioned businesses and a residence on Ponderosa Drive in Magnolia. A. Ata and K. Ata were apprehended at the Liberty Happy Gas Station. Searches of the properties resulted in the seizure of approximately 1025.32 grams of marijuana and THC products, two handguns, ammunition, drug paraphernalia, and $158,523 in suspected drug proceeds.\nAlgahgaa Ata was taken to Troop 3 for processing, charged, arraigned by Justice of the Peace Court 2, and subsequently released on a $2,000 unsecured bond.\nToms River Mayor Serves Cease and Desist on “Fake News” Page for Slanderous And False Claims \" Fake News\" Outlet with History of Misinformation Pulls Slanderous Posts About Toms River Mayor After Served with Cease & Desist\nJCEN, a fire and emergency scanner news page in Ocean County, made several posts, and the mayor claims that they are defamatory and go beyond fair criticism of a political figure.\nThe letter highlighted the potential legal consequences of these allegations if they are not removed. It stated that the posts qualify as slander per se, which allows for monetary damages without the need to prove reputational harm.\nWhen asked about the page, Rodrick said, \"They're fake news.\"\nIn one post, the page operator falsely claimed with certainty that Mayor Rodrick personally ordered the euthanization of all cats and dogs at the troubled Toms River Animal Shelter. Another post claimed Rodrick was ‘stealing campaign signs.\nBoth claims, Rodrick said, are completely false.\nIn late February, JCEN started another firestorm with a false report claiming that busloads of illegal immigrants were being dropped off in Toms River. A claim debunked by the Ocean County Sheriff’s Department. It was determined that the bus drivers were spending the night at the motel after a long trip.\nRodrick added that it’s not just anonymous Facebook pages using false claims to slander him.\n“The worst part of this is that once credible news outlets like News 12, Patch, and Jersey Shore Online are giving these people an audience without even fact-checking their ridiculous lies,” Rodrick said. “You would think established news outlets would stay out of the political space and maintain neutrality, but they’re simply regurgitating fake news and false claims being made by these people who are hell-bent on burning down Toms River unless their people are in office.”\nState records show that Jersey Shore Online and Toms River Patch each received compensation for campaign advertisements from Mo Hill-aligned political campaigns.\nRodrick said several people showed up at his family’s house over the weekend and stood at the corner for hours.\n“It’s so bizarre,” Rodrick continued. \"It’s also unsettling that my kids and family have to worry about a politically driven mob that seems to have no limits or boundaries.”\nHe said the post even led to people who truly believed he was euthanizing animals to dox him and his wife.\n“They doxed our home address and my wife's and my cell phone numbers. Then they said I had all of the animals at the shelter killed and told people to go to my house. It was a grotesque lie,\" the mayor said.\nRodrick’s letter called for an immediate retraction and removal of the false posts.\nHours after receiving the cease and desist letter, JCEN removed the two posts noted in it. The operators of the page did not make a comment on the matter.\n“We write in regard to the false and defamatory statements made by you and/or the Administrator of the JCEN about Mr. Rodrick on your Facebook Page, JCEN, alleging, without any factual basis, that Mr. Rodick is ordering for the animals at the shelter to be euthanized and speaking in a heartless and crude language, and theft. We hereby demand that you cease and remove the publication of any such statements,” Coronato wrote in the letter.\nA post by JCEN claimed these previously published photos of Rodrick were proof that he was \"Stealing\" campaign signs. Instead, they show Rodrick placing signs on his supported candidate, William Byrne. In a formal cease and desist letter dated June 8, Joseph D. Coronato, Jr., of Coronato Law, has been retained to represent Mayor Daniel T. Rodrick against alleged defamatory statements made by JCEN. The law firm demands immediate removal of all content deemed damaging to Mr. Rodrick’s reputation from their Facebook page.\nThe dispute arises from posts on the JCEN Facebook page, which falsely accused Mr. Rodrick of ordering the euthanization of shelter animals and engaging in theft. The letter refutes these claims, noting Mr. Rodrick's status as an animal lover and his involvement in transferring animals to a better-equipped facility.\nAn incident involving campaign signs was mentioned. Mr. Rodrick was wrongfully accused of stealing \"Bill Byrne for Council\" signs. According to the letter, Mr. Rodrick merely supported Byrne's campaign, not engaged in theft. A photo shared by JCEN clearly shows Rodrick with a handful of signs for his supported candidate.\n“Indeed, these baseless statements were issued maliciously and are intended to embarrass, intimidate, and harass Mr. Rodrick and cause him reputational harm. Mr. Rodrick is an avid animal lover and has two dogs in his family. The conditions at the Toms River Animal Shelter were well below standards at a significant cost to the Township Taxpayers,” Coronato, the former Ocean County Prosecutor, wrote. “Your purposeful dissemination of false and damaging information about Mr. Rodrick is an unfair and unfounded attempt to destroy his reputation and successes as Toms River Mayor. This is unacceptable, and Mr. Rodrick will not stand by while you perpetuate false statements that fit your own political angle.”\nDuring the 2024 GOP primary election, JCEN openly endorsed and supported former Mo Hill running mate Kevin Geoghegan.\n“This page is run by people who want Mo Hill and his team back in office,” Rodrick said. “These posts went beyond political speech and well into slander and libel for categorically false claims. It shows that the former mayor and his team will stop at nothing to get back into office.”\nprevious post Gel Gun Drive-Bys Prompt Police Warning in South Jersey Breaking News Man Murdered Inside Brooklyn Subway Station June 13, 2024 Gel Gun Drive-Bys Prompt Police Warning in South Jersey June 13, 2024 Arrest Made in Baltimore Homicide Cases June 13, 2024 Monessen Couple Arrested for Child Endangerment June 13, 2024 Three Arrested in Kent County Drug Bust June 13, 2024 Toms River Mayor Serves Cease and Desist on “Fake News” Page for Slanderous And False Claims June 13, 2024",

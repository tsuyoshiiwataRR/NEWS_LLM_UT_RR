    "text": "PORT CLINTON, Ohio (WTVG) - It’s an accusation of embezzlement adding up to more than $60k, money that was meant for the Danbury Twp. Fire Department.According to Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, the fundraising arm of the Danbury Twp. Fire Department, known as the Danbury Twp. Fire Fighters Association, is a non-profit organization. The treasurer of that organization, Trevor Ross, 40, is now indicted on three felony counts of Grand Theft. That’s after a lengthy investigation by the State Bureau of Criminal Investigation.According to law enforcement here in Ottawa County, the investigation itself started in March of last year, 2023. Once they discovered it involved the treasurer of the Danbury Twp. Fire Fighters Association, they turned the investigation over to the state.Yost’s office says an investigation by Ohio BCI unveiled he used the association’s credit card and checking account to make person purchases for boat equipment, firearms, collectables and other items over roughly six years.Ross was indicted in Ottawa County Common Pleas Court Wednesday, June 12, 2024. He’s set to be arraigned July 10, 2024. Latest Local News | First Alert Weather | Crime | National | 13abc Originals Copyright 2024 WTVG. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "A criminal investigation was underway at Cal State L.A. and classes went online only Thursday, June 13, a day after pro-Palestine students and other protesters intensified their demands on the school, vandalized structures on campus and occupied a campus administration building, for a time forcing the school’s own president to shelter in place inside.\nNo more people were inside the Student Services Building on Thursday, where the once-calm\npro-Palestine encampment on campus — which is demanding divestments from Israeli interests and other concerns – accelerated their demands Wednesday night by taking over the building, where President Berenecea Johnson Eanes’ office is.\nUniversity spokesman Erik Frost Hollins told reporters Thursday that Eanes was among about 12 administrators who were initially sheltering in place inside the building.\nPolice escorted some employees out of the building within a few hours of the occupation beginning. Eanes and the remaining administrators left the building shortly after midnight Thursday.\n“Obviously it’s a different and more dangerous situation when you have people in a multi-story building,” Hollins said. “There were a dozen (administrators in the building), then it got down to maybe half a dozen administrators who remained in the building to work the situation throughout the evening.”\nPolice were seen staging around campus after protesters occupied the student services building and demanded to meet with the university president, to agree or address\ntheir demands.\nThe campus was sparse and quiet by Thursday morning, but the toll of the night before was visible. Dozens of abandoned bench and umbrella barricades were among the only outwardly visible evidence of the occupation that took place Wednesday night. But signs were also popping up on social media, including shattered glass at offices inside the Student Services building.\nOne post called the damage “pretty staggering.” Another post showed what it said were two facility services vehicles that had been flipped on their sides.\nIn a now-deleted social media post, the protesters said Eanes “continues to dance around and repress our divestment demands,” referencing calls for the university to halt any funding or financial support of businesses tied to Israel.\n“We’ve been waiting for a response to our demands for 18 days,” one now-deleted post said. “There is no more time to spare while families are being massacred by U.S. Imperialism with each minute that passes.”\nThe Instagram account and backup account for Students for Justice in Palestine at Cal State LA, which is the student-led encampment organizers, were taken down Wednesday and Thursday respectively.\nSJP did not get back for comment despite multiple attempts.\nNo arrests have been made yet for building damage, which included smashed window, graffiti and overturned campus services vehicles. Protesters voluntarily left the Student Services building at around 1 a.m. Thursday.\nIt was unclear what sparked the activity, which came after weeks of off-and-on negotiations between the protesters and administration.\nOn Wednesday, some protesters chained themselves together outside the main entrance as others used patio furniture, golf carts and other materials to establish a barricade around the structure.\nUniversity officials issued a campus alert urging anyone inside the building to shelter in place, and telling others to leave the campus.\nOne protester told KTLA5 overnight that Palestine protesters have been peaceful during their demonstrations.\n“We haven’t hurt a single person the entire time we’ve been out here,” the protester — wearing a mask to cover her face and providing only her first name — told the station. “And we’ve been negotiating with her (Eanes) in good faith for over a month. She has not been negotiating with us in good faith, that’s the bottom line. If she wants to pretend like we’re a danger to her, I think it’s nefarious really. I think it’s evil.”\nOne student told reporters the protests were getting out of control.\n“I just think it’s pretty selfish of them,” Gilbert Sosa said. “This campus is for everybody, they’re just taking over. I don’t think it’s very appropriate, I don’t think they’re really accomplishing anything either. I’m here, I’m paying to go to school. I’m here to learn and I can’t today because these guys want to throw a little tantrum.”\nCity News Service contributed to this report.",

    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS — The family of [Leneal Frazier](/article/news/local/attorneys-family-leneal-frazier-call-for-accountability/89-a565faec-a98a-4532-82e3-a03abf49dcc2), the man killed after a Minneapolis police officer crashed into his car while chasing another vehicle back in 2021, has filed a federal lawsuit against the city, claiming that its practices played a role in his death. The family is seeking unspecified damages, claiming that the city's \"unlawful customs and practices\" allowed police to engage — and continue — high-speed pursuits, similar to the chase that killed Frazier. According to court documents, MPD Officer Brian Cummings reached speeds close to 100 mph for nearly 20 blocks prior to the crash. The chase wound through north Minneapolis, including residential neighborhoods. Eventually, prosecutors said Cummings ran a red light at Lyndale and 41st Avenues North and collided with a Jeep driven by Frazier, who died from the significant injuries he sustained in the crash. Last year, Cummings pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was [sentenced to 270 days](/article/news/crime/former-minneapolis-police-officer-brian-cummings-sentenced-fatal-crash/89-97c7140c-3a30-4425-9912-6062a99142ee) in prison. In the federal lawsuit, the attorneys for Frazier's family pulled data from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) that showed 24% of MPD's pursuits since 2021 ended in crashes, the highest of any law enforcement agency in the state. The suit also claims that Cummings was involved in at least 12 instances of \"dangerous, high-speed pursuits\" in 2021, with only four resulting in an arrest of the suspect. The lawsuit also claims the city's practices disproportionately targeted Black drivers, adding that those high-speed pursuits were also more likely to occur in neighborhoods with high numbers of Black residents. The City of Minneapolis updated its police pursuit policies in 2019, the same year Jose Madrid Salcido, a father of four, was killed by a man fleeing police at the intersection of Aldrich Avenue and 36th Avenue North. In that case, the chase began when the suspect suddenly drove off after being stopped by officers on suspicion of selling drugs. Ultimately, it's up to the officer to decide when to initiate a chase, and it's up to the officer or supervisors to decide when to break away from it. Generally, the department requires officers to believe one of the following: - The driver is linked to a violent felony or gross misdemeanor - The driver is about to commit a violent crime - The person is driving in such a flagrantly reckless way they're putting bystanders and their own passengers in danger The crimes listed in the policy include murder, sex crimes, robberies, arson, kidnapping, carjacking, 1st and 2nd-degree assault and terrorist acts.

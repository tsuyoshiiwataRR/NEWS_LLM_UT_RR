    "text": "Tyson Foods suspended its chief financial officer, John R. Tyson, on Thursday, saying he was arrested for allegedly driving while intoxicated. The incident came a year and a half after the executive, who is the son of Chairman John H. Tyson, pleaded guilty to public intoxication and trespassing after he was found asleep in a stranger’s house. In an article about his arrest in that incident, The Wall Street Journal reported that he had apologized for his actions in a companywide email, saying he was receiving counseling on alcohol usage. The company said in a Thursday statement that it suspended John R. Tyson from his duties immediately. Curt Calaway, a senior finance executive at the firm, will take over as the interim CFO. A fourth-generation member of the Tyson family that founded the company, the executive came on board in 2019. The company replied with the statement about the suspension when asked to make John R. Tyson available for comment. According to Tyson Foods’ website, he has a bachelor’s degree from Harvard University and a master’s of business administration from Stanford University. He has previously worked in investment banking for J.P. Morgan as a private-equity and venture-capital investor. Tyson shares were down 1.2% in midday trading. Shares have fallen 2.6% so far this year. Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com",

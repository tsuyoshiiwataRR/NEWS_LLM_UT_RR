    "text": "Following an incident in which a cleric from a church in Omuo Ekiti, located in the Ekiti East Local Government Area of Ekiti State, Pastor Enoch, was found guilty of raping a minor, the Ekiti State High Court in Ado Ekiti has sentenced him to life imprisonment.\nThe victim, who is reported to be the daughter of one of the church members, was assaulted by the pastor during one of her visits to his residence.\nIt was revealed that the young girl frequently visited the mission house to assist the pastor’s wife with household chores and provide support to the younger children with their school assignments.\nThe Ekiti State Director of Public Prosecution, Julius Ajibade, who handled the case, explained, “The defendant (pastor) drugged the minor with a bottle of Fanta during one of her visits to the mission house.”\n“After consuming the drink, the girl fell asleep, only to wake up and discover that she was bleeding severely from her private area.\n“Subsequently, the defendant was apprehended, charged, and brought to trial for the criminal act of Rape as stipulated in Section 2 of the Gender–Based Violence (Prohibition) Law, 2019.”\nThe DPP presented four witnesses and submitted two pieces of evidence to substantiate the case.\nThe defendant’s representative, Adeyinka Opaleke, presented their defense and called upon one additional witness.\nIn his verdict, Justice Olusegun Ogunyemi declared that “the prosecution successfully established the defendant’s guilt in the rape case beyond any doubt.”\nConsequently, the defendant was found guilty and handed a life sentence.",

    "text": "Waco teen sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2021 shooting death WACO, Texas (KWTX) - An 18-year-old Waco teen, one of four defendants charged with capital murder in the 2021 shooting death and robbery of a man who was lured to South Waco through a fake social media account, was sentenced to 30 years in prison Thursday. Edgar Alfonso Castillo pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of murder in exchange for a recommendation from the McLennan County District Attorney’s Office that he serve 30 years in prison in the September shooting death of 22-year-old Israel Martinez. Judge Susan Kelly of Waco’s 54th State District Court approved the plea agreement and sentenced Castillo in accordance with the plea bargain. Castillo, who was 16 at the time of the offense, must serve at least 15 years in prison before he can seek parole. He will be given credit for the 618 days he spent in custody waiting for his case to be resolved. Castillo’s attorney, Jonathan Sibley said Castillo has taken responsibility for his role in the incident. “Obviously, when a case involves a tragic death, you understand the loss the victim’s family must be feeling,” Sibley said. “In this case, Mr. Castillo was a minor at the time of the incident, and this is every parent’s nightmare when their child gets involved with a group of boys who make decisions that will affect the rest of all of their lives.” “I know Mr. Castillo’s family loves him and will certainly feel and be affected severely by his absence while he serves his sentence in this case.” Assistant District Attorney Kristi DeCluitt declined comment Thursday because the other cases remain pending. Two other juveniles who also have been certified to stand trial as adults, Cyle Flores, 16, and Jeremiah Marquez, 18, also are charged with capital murder in the death of Martinez, an insulation company worker and the father of a young son. Waco police say the teens worked with Justin Angel Hernandez, 22, to use Facebook Messenger to lure Martinez to a home in the 2200 block of Gurley Avenue. Hernandez also was indicted on a capital murder charge. The charges remain pending against the other three defendants. According to arrest records in Hernandez’s case, Martinez was shot multiple times in front of a home on Gurley Lane that had been broken into through a back window. Police reported finding spent shell casings from a number of different types of firearms at the scene. Witnesses saw multiple people flee the scene. Officers found Martinez’s wallet, cell phone and other items near his body, police said. After examining his phone, investigators said his Facebook account showed he had been communicating with a woman named Kaelani Moore on Facebook Messenger. A photo that purported to be Moore’s was on the phone, along with a message telling Martinez to come to 2212 Gurley Ave., according to an arrest warrant affidavit. The message described a vehicle that would be parked in front of the house. Officers later discovered that the Facebook account was deleted or deactivated, the affidavit states. Detectives found the conversation Martinez was led to believe was with the woman came from Hernandez’s Facebook account, the affidavit alleges. Hernandez directed Martinez to send money to a money transfer application with the screen name “Kaelani M,” the reports state. Waco police allege in the affidavit that the account associated with the email address on the Kaelani Moore Facebook account was used to “set up the murder victim.” The subscriber name on the account came back to Hernandez, the affidavit alleges. Martinez is the brother of 24-year-old Valarie Martinez, who was found shot to death at Tradinghouse Creek Reservoir park along with her 1-year-old daughter, Azariah, in November 2017. Christopher Paul Weiss was convicted of capital murder after an April trial in Waco’s 19th State District Court and was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Copyright 2024 KWTX.

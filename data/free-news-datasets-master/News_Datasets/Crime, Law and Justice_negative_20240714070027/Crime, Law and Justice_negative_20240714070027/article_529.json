    "text": "- Judge rules against Barrington Plaza landlord(Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images) Topline: In a highly anticipated decision that could have broad implications for renters across California, a federal judge has ruled against a landlord seeking to carry out one of the [largest mass evictions](https://laist.com/news/housing-homelessness/barrington-plaza-fire-sprinklers-eviction-ellis-act-los-angeles-housing-relocation)in Los Angeles history. Why it matters: The judge’s determination means more than 100 tenants still living at Barrington Plaza — a 712-unit West L.A. high-rise apartment complex — will get to stay. Some long-term tenants pay far below market rates due to the city’s rent stabilization ordinance, and feared they would not be able to find affordable housing anywhere in the region if forced to leave. In a highly anticipated decision that could have broad implications for renters across California, a federal judge has ruled against a landlord seeking to carry out one of the [largest mass evictions](https://laist.com/news/housing-homelessness/barrington-plaza-fire-sprinklers-eviction-ellis-act-los-angeles-housing-relocation)in Los Angeles history. The judge’s determination means more than 100 tenants still living at Barrington Plaza — a 712-unit West L.A. high-rise apartment complex — will get to stay. Some long-term tenants pay far below market rates due to the city’s rent stabilization ordinance, and feared they would not be able to find affordable housing anywhere in the region if forced to leave. “This is, no doubt, one of the most important tenants' rights legal victories in state history,” said Larry Gross, executive director of the [Coalition for Economic Survival](https://www.cesinaction.org/)in an email on the ruling. “This victory shows when tenants unite and organize they can win.” The backstory at Barrington Santa Monica-based corporate landlord Douglas Emmett originally filed evictions against 577 households at Barrington Plaza back in May of 2023. The company said the property needed to be completely vacated in order to install fire sprinklers. Two large fires broke out in the apartment buildings in recent years, with a 2020 fire resulting in the death of one person. The company filed the evictions under California’s Ellis Act, which allows landlords to clear their buildings when they plan to “go out of business.” Thursday’s tentative ruling from Judge H. Jay Ford, III — likely to become the final ruling after another court hearing — hinged on the question of what exactly it means for a landlord to go out of business. Both sides agreed the Ellis Act requires owners to exit the rental business in order to vacate buildings. But they disagreed on how long owners must keep those properties off the market. The tenants’ attorney Frances Campbell argued the landlord had no intention of going out of business. Instead, she said, the owner’s plan was to refurbish and re-rent Barrington Plaza apartments at higher rates. Douglas Emmett’s attorneys said removing tenants for rehab work that could take years was in effect going out of business, even if the move was temporary. Judge says Barrington was not going out of business Ultimately, Ford said the landlord in this case had no intention of permanently going out of business when it filed the evictions. Rather, he said, the landlord planned to continue renting the apartments after the work was complete. “The Court concludes [the landlord’s] intent to temporarily withdraw Barrington Plaza from the rental market with the present intent to return it to the rental market after the renovations are completed is inconsistent with an intent to go out of the rental business under the Ellis Act,” Ford wrote. Representatives for Douglas Emmett said the company has yet reached a decision on whether to appeal the ruling, but fire safety work will continue. Renters fighting to stay banded together through the Barrington Plaza Tenants Association, which filed [wrongful eviction cases](https://laist.com/news/housing-homelessness/barrington-plaza-eviction-lawsuit-douglas-emmett-los-angeles-housing-ellis-act)in response to Douglas Emmett’s actions. Monique Gomez, one of the tenants involved in organizing these efforts, said if the judge had ruled in favor of the landlord, it would have opened the floodgates for other landlords throughout the state to use renovations as a pretext to evict rent-controlled tenants. “We have been fighting these bogus evictions for over a year now,” Gomez said in an email responding to the ruling. “Tenants here have faced harassment, intimidation and uncertainty without little to no help from the city. It shows when we stick together we can win. I am overjoyed.\"What questions do you have about housing in Southern California? Jump to a story Loading...",

    "text": "A man in the UK has been jailed for a significant legal case involving the non-consensual removal of a condom during sexual intercourse, according to London’s Metropolitan Police.\n39-year-old Guy Mukendi from South London received a sentencing of four years and three months following his conviction in April, as reported by the London police force.\nThe arrest of Mukendi took place in May last year after a young woman in Brixton, south London, reported a case of sexual assault.\nIt was revealed that the woman had agreed to engage in sexual activity with Mukendi on the condition that he used a condom.\nHowever, he disregarded her consent and removed the condom during intercourse without her knowledge.\nIn England and Wales, non-consensual condom removal, often known as “stealthing,” is considered a form of rape.\nThe Met highlighted that such prosecutions are infrequent due to under-reporting but emphasized their commitment to seeking justice for victims.\nDescribed as a “landmark” case, this prosecution aligns with the Met’s efforts to focus more on the perpetrators of crimes that disproportionately impact women and girls, as stated in their official release.\nMukendi was convicted on April 2 at Inner London Crown Court and subsequently sentenced at the same court.\nLead investigator Detective Constable Jack Earl expressed determination in building a strong case against Mukendi to ensure justice for the victim and increase awareness about the seriousness of this offense.\nAFP",

    "text": "A man has been jailed for taking a condom he was wearing off without consent during sex. Guy Mukendi, 39, of Brixton in south London, was sentenced on Thursday to four years and three months in prison, the Metropolitan Police said. Mukendi was arrested following a report of sexual assault made by a young woman in Brixton on May 9 2023. The Met said the woman had consented with Mukendi on condition that a condom was used. But during sex, he removed the condom without the victim’s knowledge. Non-consensual condom removal is sometimes referred to as “stealthing” and is classified as rape under English and Welsh law. The Met said prosecutions for this type of crime were very rare due to under-reporting. In a press release, the force also described the “milestone” case as “unique”. Local officers from Brixton looked at text exchanges and forensic evidence and worked with the victim to obtain screenshots of messages from Mukendi in which he apologised for taking the condom off. He said he did it because he had not had sex in a long time. He then deleted the messages. Mukendi was found guilty on April 2 at Inner London Crown Court, and was sentenced at the same venue on Thursday. Detective Constable Jack Earl, who led the investigation, said: “Throughout this investigation, Mukendi denied any wrongdoing – but our officers built a compelling case against him to leave no doubt in the jury’s mind. “We were dedicated to securing justice for the victim and will continue to raise awareness that this crime is a form of rape. “The victim did the right thing to call the police straight away and her bravery should not be overshadowed. “If you have been a victim of sexual violence and not yet reported it – please contact your local police service and we will do all that we can to help and bring you justice.” Kate Holmes, head of Sexual Violence Helplines at Survivors Gateway, added: “Survivors of sexual violence in London can contact the Survivor’s Gateway on 0808 801 0860 to be connected with support. “Our navigators provide a confidential, non-judgmental space, and can make referrals for counselling as well as practical advocacy support.”Want a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories?

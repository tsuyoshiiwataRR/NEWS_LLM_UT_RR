    "text": "GREENFIELD TOWNSHIP, LACKAWANNA COUNTY (WBRE/WYOU)— A woman wanted out of Florida was taken into custody June 1 after attempting to bribe a state trooper. Trooper Maguire states that he pulled over Andrea Mayze, 32, from Jacksonville Florida after she was following his vehicle closely, speeding, and unsafely passing his vehicle. While questioning Mayze, Maguire became suspicious after she gave him a false name of Megan Shoults, a false date of birth, and said her license was out of North Carolina. Mayze was unable to answer questions about her address and Social Security Number, according to the report. Maguire then searched the vehicle and found several baggies containing white powder, a marijuana cigarette, and several IDs with Mayze’s name on them. He then confirmed she had an active arrest warrant out of Florida. Mayze then complained of a medical issue, and was transported to Regional Hospital of Scranton. There, she tried to bribe Trooper Robert Mikulak with money to let her go because she did not want to go to jail for her existing warrant. Mayze was discharged from the hospital and transported to the Lackawanna County Prison where authorities found more baggies with white substances and a pink crystal like substance. Mayze was arraigned on misdemeanor charges of possession of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, and false identification among other charges. She was taken to the county prison, unable to post $5,000 bail, with a preliminary hearing June 24.",

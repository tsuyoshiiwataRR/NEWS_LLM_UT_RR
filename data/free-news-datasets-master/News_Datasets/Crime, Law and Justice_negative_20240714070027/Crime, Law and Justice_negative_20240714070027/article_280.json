    "text": "BOSTON — Massachusetts is poised to join a majority of states in banning the posting of sexually explicit images on the Internet to harass people, with legislation sent Thursday to Gov. Maura Healey. The bipartisan bill would create a new felony offense for individuals charged with distributing a sexually explicit image \"for purposes of revenge or embarrassment,\" and give judges the authority to ensure explicit images are destroyed. Violators could face up to 2-1/2 years in prison and fines of $10,000. A key provision of the bill focuses on \"coercive control\" against abuse victims and bans the posting of sexually explicit \"deepfakes\" or a computer-generated manipulation of a person’s voice or likeness using artificial intelligence programs. Lawmakers who sponsored the bill recalled the stories that domestic violence victims told during emotional hearings, many involving the posting of lewd pictures on the Internet without their consent. \"Clearly, it has taken longer than many of us would have liked, but today the day has arrived for us to take decisive action,\" Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr, R-Gloucester, said in remarks on the Senate floor Thursday. \"That day could not come soon enough.\" It would also ease criminal sanctions for minors who are caught exchanging illicit materials to one another, who under current state laws are subject to felony charges of distributing or possession of child pornography. Youthful offenders could be eligible for a diversion program that avoids criminal sanctions, under the plan. \"We all acknowledge that young people make mistakes. Their mind hasn't been fully developed,\" Sen. John Keenan, D-Quincy, said in remarks Thursday. \"Rather than put them into the criminal justice system ... they will go to the diversion program.\" Massachusetts is one of only two states — the other is South Carolina — that doesn’t have laws against so-called revenge porn, which involves adults posting sexually explicit images of a former spouse or ex-partner on the internet to harass them. The proposal is part of a package that seeks to close loopholes in protections for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and assault and battery. Domestic violence victims have packed public hearings on Beacon Hill in support of the proposed law, many recalling stories of ex-partners posting lewd pictures of them on the internet to embarrass and harass them. Former Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, filed similar proposals, which also called for toughening rules aimed at keeping “dangerous” suspects locked up while awaiting trial, during his eight years in office. None were approved. The House approved a revenge porn bill in 2022, but the Senate didn’t take it up before the end of the legislative session. The House and Senate approved the proposals earlier this year, but differences between the two bills needed to be worked out in a six-member conference committee before sending it to Healey's desk for consideration.

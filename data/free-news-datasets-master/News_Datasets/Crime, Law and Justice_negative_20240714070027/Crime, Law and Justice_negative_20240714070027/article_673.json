Following Jun 13, 2024, 05:47pm EDT Updated Jun 14, 2024, 01:32pm EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline\nA Senate Judiciary Committee ethics investigation found Thursday that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas failed to disclose three private jet trips provided by GOP megadonor Harlan Crow—the latest scrutiny of Thomas after he recently amended a financial disclosure to include previously undisclosed vacations gifted to him by Crow.\nThe information revealed Thursday was sourced from a subpoena for information from Crow. (Photo by ... [+] Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nGetty Images Key Facts The findings announced by the committee Thursday were collected through a subpoena for information from Crow and revealed Clarence did not disclose three domestic private jet trips from Crow between 2017 and 2021.\nSubpoenaed documents also showed further private jet travel and an eight-day yacht excursion Thomas did not disclose in his 2019 financial disclosure amendment last week.\nThomas’ financial disclosure amendment last week included the addition of two trips to the “reimbursement” section of the report; the trips involved flights to Bali and Crow’s private club in California, where Thomas’ food and lodging was covered by the donor.\nGifts of transportation are legally required to be disclosed by Supreme Court justices, unlike food, lodging or entertainment received as personal hospitality.\nCrucial Quote “Despite an approval rating near all-time lows and never-ending, self-inflicted scandals, Chief Justice Roberts still refuses to use his existing authority to implement an enforceable code of conduct,” U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-IL, said in a statement. “Until he acts, we will continue our push for the Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act to become law.”\nKey Background Thomas was embroiled in controversy last year when a ProPublica report found he accepted luxury flights and yacht trips from Crow without divulging them on legally required disclosures. Thomas also reportedly failed to disclose Crow-funded tuition payments given to his grandnephew, Mark Martin. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito has also faced ethics scrutiny over the flying of an upside-down American flag at his home after the 2020 election, as well as an “Appeal To Heaven” flag flown at his New Jersey home last year. The latter flag was also flown by Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection rioters. The controversies surrounding the justices come amid a push by Senate Democrats to introduce the Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal and Transparency Act, which would enshrine a code of conduct for Supreme Court justices. A Democratic push to pass the bill by unanimous consent was blocked yesterday by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\nFurther Reading Supreme Court Ethics Bill Blocked In Senate Amid Samuel Alito Controversies (Forbes)\nClarence Thomas Reports Two More Harlan Crow Trips On Supreme Court Disclosure (Forbes)\nClarence Thomas Discloses More Trips From GOP Megadonor Harlan Crow (Forbes)\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

    "text": "Nationstar Mortgage, Mr. Cooper Data Breach Last Updated on June 13, 2024 At A Glance - What's Going On? - Attorneys need to hear from people affected by the Mr. Cooper data breach as they investigate whether a class action lawsuit can be filed. - What You Can Do - If you got a letter or email about the breach, fill out the form on this page to learn more about the investigation and how you can help. - Does This Cost Anything? - It costs nothing to get in touch or to talk to someone about your rights. - What Can I Get? - If filed and successful, a class action lawsuit could provide consumers with money for any harm resulting from the breach. Mr. Cooper Data Breach: Lawsuit Investigation Attorneys working with ClassAction.org are looking into whether a class action lawsuit can be filed in light of the Mr. Cooper data breach. As part of their investigation, they need to hear from individuals who received a notice stating they were impacted. Around December 15, 2023, Nationstar Mortgage LLC, which does business as Mr. Cooper, began sending out notice of a data breach that reportedly impacted 14,690,284 individuals. The Mr. Cooper data breach occurred between October 30 and November 1, 2023, during which an unauthorized party acquired files containing personal data. In response, Mr. Cooper shut down systems to contain the incident and launched an investigation with cybersecurity experts’ assistance. The mortgage servicer stated in an [online notice of the incident](https://mrcooperincident.com/) that the compromised data includes names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth and bank account numbers. Tax identification numbers may have also been exposed. Affected individuals may include those whose mortgages were previously acquired or serviced by Nationstar Mortgage LLC or Centex Home Equity or those whose mortgages are or were serviced by one of Mr. Cooper’s sister brands, including RightPath Servicing, Rushmore Servicing, Greenlight Financial Services and Champion Mortgage. The breach could also involve individuals for whom Mr. Cooper is or was the servicing partner of their mortgage company, as well as those who had previously applied for home loans with Mr. Cooper. If your information was exposed in the breach, attorneys want to hear from you. You may be able to start a class action lawsuit to recover compensation for loss of privacy, time spent dealing with the breach, out-of-pocket costs, and more. A successful case could also force Mr. Cooper to ensure it takes proper steps to protect the information it was entrusted with.

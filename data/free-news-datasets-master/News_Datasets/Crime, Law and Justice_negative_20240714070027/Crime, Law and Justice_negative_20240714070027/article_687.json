    "text": "In a recent ruling, a California appeals court found an arbitration agreement with an eyewear store employee that was presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis required an arbitrator to apply the laws of another state, required that arbitration be conducted in another state, and forced the employee to share arbitration or mediation costs with the employer was unconscionable, and thus unenforceable. Quick Hits On May 20, 2024, a panel for California’s Fourth Appellate District issued a unanimous, unpublished decision in Dopp v. Now Optics, LLC, affirming a lower court’s decision that found several of the provisions in the arbitration agreement made it both procedurally and substantively unconscionable, and thus unenforceable. The ruling highlights how courts, at least in California, are scrutinizing employers’ arbitration agreements and declining to enforce such agreements when they contain substantively unconscionable provisions that go beyond merely requiring that disputes between employers and employees be resolved through binding arbitration—such as choice-of-law clauses, forum-selection clauses, confidentiality provisions, and provisions requiring sharing of costs and fees. Factual Overview Allison Dopp, who previously worked at Now Optics, LLC’s, retail stores in San Diego County, California, from 2019 to 2021, brought a lawsuit against the company and related entity Vision Precision Holdings, LLC, as well as two supervisorial employees, asserting class action claims for meal and rest period violations and overtime violations, as well as various individual claims, including wrongful discharge and violations of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The defendants moved to compel arbitration relying on an arbitration agreement that Dopp electronically signed along with other onboarding documents when she was hired. Dopp opposed the motion, arguing that the arbitration agreement was procedurally and substantively unconscionable. The trial court agreed with Dopp and denied the defendants’ motion. The defendants appealed. Procedural Unconscionability The Fourth Appellate District held that the arbitration agreement with Dopp was procedurally unconscionable for two reasons: Substantive Unconscionability The Fourth Appellate District Court agreed with the ruling by the trial court that six provisions of the arbitration agreement were substantively unconscionable: Based on the six substantively unconscionable provisions in the agreement, the court found that the arbitration agreement “register[ed] high on the scale of substantive unconscionability.” Severance The appellate court further found that the trial court had not abused its discretion in declining to sever the unconscionable provisions and enforce the remainder of the agreement. In reaching that conclusion, the appellate panel noted the six substantively unconscionable provisions “systematically operated to deprive Dopp of valuable rights and remedies as a California employee” and that the agreement was “permeated with too high a degree of unconscionability for severance to rehabilitate.” Key Takeaways Recognizing that courts are likely to characterize arbitration agreements between employers and employees as contracts of adhesion, employers may want to consider avoiding provisions that could tip the scale in favor of unconscionability. Such provisions may include those that require employees to share in costs and fees of arbitration or pre-arbitration mediation. Moreover, employers may want to exercise caution before including choice-of-law and forum-selection clauses in arbitration agreements that would apply the law of, or require arbitration in, a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction where the employee is employed, or provisions mandating that arbitration remain confidential.

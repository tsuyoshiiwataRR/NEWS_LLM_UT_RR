    "text": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday to preserve access to a drug that has been used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the country in the last year. This marks the court’s first abortion decision since it overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago. The high court considered whether the Food and Drug Administration violated federal guidelines when it rushed approval of the drug two decades ago. Breaking News . Spirit-Filled Stories . Subscribe to Charisma on YouTube now! The justices ruled that abortion opponents lacked the legal standing to sue over the FDA’s expedited approval of the drug, mifepristone, and the FDA’s subsequent controversial decision to ease access to it. As CBN News reported in August, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the FDA was wrong to remove safety measures for mifepristone. “In loosening mifepristone’s safety restrictions, FDA failed to address several important concerns about whether the drug would be safe for the women who use it,” Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod wrote. She was joined by Judge Cory Wilson. Get your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today! Stay up-to-date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more! In that ruling, the court restored other safety measures to protect women, saying mifepristone should only be allowed through the seventh week of pregnancy rather than the 10th, and it must be administered in the presence of a physician.

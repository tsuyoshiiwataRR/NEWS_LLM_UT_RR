    "text": "This is the sickening moment a killer was caught on video casually buying snacks after murdering a 26-year-old man by spraying him in the face with ammonia. Andrew Foster was attacked when he answered the door in August 2023 as part of an organised hit. Just moments after carrying out the horrific attack, John Wandless was captured on CCTV at a garage smiling at the person serving him and even debating what kind of milkshake to buy with his accomplice, Kenneth Fawcett. They had stopped off in a stolen VW Golf which they used to carry out the attack, which was later burnt in an attempt to conceal evidence. The horrific incident was just one of a series of attacks in Gateshead and South Tyneside, one of which caused a victim to lose an eye. Newcastle Crown Court heard that there were four corrosive substance attacks in the space of 11 days, connected with drug dealing. Youssef Wynne was a drug dealer and John Wandless, Kenneth Fawcett and Josh Hawthorn worked for him, the court heard. Wandless can be seen at a petrol station, speaking to a cashier, just moments after the brutal attack At one point, he turned to his accomplice, Fawcett, to debate about what kind of milkshake to buy The killer seemed calm and relaxed. At one point he could be seen smiling and seemingly without any cares The VW was also stolen and was later burnt in an attempt to hide evidence. They casually used to service station while, Andrew Foster was fighting for his life Fawcett was described as Wynne&#039;s &#039;enforcer&#039; and was physically present at the attacks. He recruited Wandless, who was at the last three attacks. The prosecution said the group were involved in a scheme to &#039;tax&#039; other drug dealers by stealing from them and trying to scare them off. The quartet were found guilty today of all counts they were charged with, including murdering and robbing Mr Foster at his home in Wrekenton. During the trial, Mark McKone KC, prosecuting, told jurors: &#039;On the night of the 20th of August last year, Andrew Foster was at home with his partner when two men entered his home and attacked him by throwing a chemical in his face. &#039;As a result, he couldn&#039;t breathe. He suffered a severe respiratory attack, he had a heart attack and died. &#039;The chemical attack upon Mr Foster was the fourth similar chemical attack in that general area in just 11 days, between 9th and 20th of August. &#039;The prosecution say that four separate victims were attacked at their homes in the Gateshead or South Shields areas by ammonia, or a similar corrosive liquid, being thrown or sprayed into their faces. &#039;Andrew Foster died, one woman lost an eye and two other men needed medical treatment. &#039;The prosecution say that the violence was connected to drug dealing. &#039;The prosecution say that the four defendants were part of a scheme to tax other drug dealers. &#039;Taxing is a slang word in the drugs world for dealers stealing drugs from another dealer and, at the same time, scaring off the competition from future drug dealing.&#039; The prosecution did not say that Wynne and Hawthorn were present at any of the four attacks. But Mr McKone added: &#039;The prosecution do say that Wynne was involved in organising all the attacks and that Hawthorn was also involved in organising the fourth and fatal attack. &#039;The attacks were carried out, we submit, for the benefit of Wynne and Hawthorn.&#039; Mr McKone added: &#039;The prosecution submit that anyone attacking someone in the face with ammonia must intend to cause at least really serious harm. &#039;Those using ammonia to attack others will have seen the suffering of the victim on the earlier occasions. &#039;The prosecution say that all four defendants were part of a joint enterprise. Andrew Foster (pictured) was attacked when he answered the door in August 2023 as part of an organised hit Pictured top left, Youssef Wynne, top right, John George Wandless, bottom left, Josh Craig Hawthorn and bottom right, Kenneth Fawcett &#039;The defendants formed a joint plan for Fawcett and Wandless to drive to the victim&#039;s home at Eighton Terrace, Wrekenton, in Gateshead in order to attack him with ammonia.&#039; Mr Foster&#039;s partner, Katie Harrison, came downstairs during the attack after hearing a commotion to find him shouting, &#039;It&#039;s ammonia, I can&#039;t breathe&#039;. The jury saw footage of a police interview with Ms Harrison which took place days after her boyfriend&#039;s death. She explained that she had gone to bed when there was a knock at the door. Seconds later, Mr Foster screamed to call an ambulance. She later realised a box was missing from the kitchen, which contained a kit for making sweets which were then sprayed with cannabis oil. She said: &#039;He was screaming and he grabbed his face, his eyes were all red and swollen. He said it&#039;s ammonia, I can&#039;t breathe, I can&#039;t breathe.&#039; Mr McKone added: &#039;The ammonia caused Andrew Foster to have breathing difficulties and a cardiac arrest which led to brain damage as oxygen could not get to his brain. He died in hospital the following day.&#039; A doctor said that the ammonia triggered an asthma attack which caused cardiac arrest which also caused a hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury. According to the doctor, this meant there is a direct link between the ammonia attack and death. One of the group&#039;s attack victims, Nicola Dixon, gave evidence in the trial. Police cordon off the property following the attack on Monday, August 22, 2023 Andrew Foster was attacked at his property (pictured) as part of a &#039;taxing&#039; scheme organised by the gang The horrific incident was just one of a series of attacks in Gateshead and South Tyneside. Pictured, a police cordon after the fatal ammonia attack Speaking anonymously via video link, she said she was at home with her boyfriend in Jarrow, on South Tyneside, on August 16, 2023. He was recovering from surgery for a broken leg and was in a plaster when two men appeared at the sitting room door. One of them was carrying a hammer which he &#039;swung&#039; at the victim&#039;s boyfriend. Ms Dixon said she jumped up and grabbed the hammer when suddenly, something was squirted in her face. &#039;We were struggling and then the next thing he squirted something in my face,&#039; she told the court, &#039;It hit my lungs. I didn&#039;t know what it was but it hit my eyes.&#039; She broke down as she explained how she was instantly blinded in one eye and passed out. Although she underwent three operations to save her eye, they failed and her left eye had to be removed a few months later. The four killers were convicted at Newcastle Crown Court of murder and robbery relating to the stealing of cannabis edibles after Mr Foster was attacked with ammonia at his home in Gateshead. Wynne was also convicted of assaulting Mr Foster 11 months before he died in an alleged dispute over drugs. Wynne, Fawcett and Wandless were also convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Nicola Dixon on August 16 last year. Wynne, Fawcett and Wandless were also convicted of of attempting to cause GBH with intent on another man at his house in Hebburn on August 12 last year. The man was sprayed in the face with ammonia and required hospital treatment. Wandless pleaded to handling a stolen VW Golf and arson by burning it out after it was allegedly used in three of the incidents. Wynne, 39, of Wuppertal Court, Jarrow, Wandless, 33, of no fixed address, Fawcett, 33, of Balkwell Avenue, North Shields and Hawthorn, 22, of Ashfield, Jarrow, were further remanded in custody and will be sentenced on July 26. The violent thugs face mandatory life sentences for murder. Speaking after the trial, Andrew Foster&#039;s mother Karen said his family will never get over his death. She said: &#039;We as a family will never get over Andrew&#039;s death. &#039;To those who didn&#039;t know Andrew, he was a practical joker, always laughing and had a heart of gold. &#039;I spoke to him every day, usually on video calls when he would pull funny faces just to make me laugh. He cared for his family and friends so much. &#039;Andrew was our only son, as well as a loving and supportive partner, grandson, nephew and cousin. &#039;He was particularly close to his Grandad who was very special to him.&#039; Speaking following the convictions, Detective Inspector Tam Fowler, of Northumbria Police, said: &#039;Our thoughts are firmly with Andrew&#039;s loved ones following his tragic death as well as the victims of everyone who was involved in this reckless spate of attacks. &#039;This was a shocking crime spree which saw the offenders act together, intimidating and causing serious harm to their intended targets. &#039;Not only did their cowardly actions lead to a young man losing his life, they also led to life-changing injuries to another woman. &#039;The defendants have also continued to deny the charges put to them without showing a hint of remorse. &#039;That meant Andrew&#039;s family and the survivors of the other attacks have had to endure a lengthy court process and subsequent trial. &#039;Of course, no result will ever take away the pain that their actions have caused, but I hope these guilty verdicts today give some comfort to knowing that those behind the attacks have been brought to justice.&#039;",

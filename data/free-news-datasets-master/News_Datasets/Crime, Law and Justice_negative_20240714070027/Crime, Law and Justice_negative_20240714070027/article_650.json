    "text": "(Photo : Lee County Sheriff's Office) Wade Wilson’s dramatic tattoo transformation was evident in the courtroom as he showed little emotion while learning his fate for the murders of two Florida women. Wade Wilson's dramatic tattoo transformation was [evident in the courtroom](https://www.hngn.com/articles/261248/20240606/driver-who-joined-zoom-court-hearing-behind-wheel-back-jail-harris.htm) as he showed little emotion while learning his fate for [the murders](https://www.hngn.com/articles/261408/20240612/buffalo-mass-shooter-payton-gendron-targeted-black-people-grocery-store.htm) of two Florida women. On Wednesday, Wilson, 30, was convicted in the first-degree [strangulation murders](https://www.hngn.com/articles/261264/20240606/gilgo-beach-victims-new-rex-heuermann-serial-killer.htm) of Kristine Melton, 35, and Diane Ruiz, 43, according to [WINK-TV](https://winknews.com/2024/06/04/how-accused-double-murderer-changed-his-looks-with-tattoos/). The 12-person jury also found Wilson guilty of battery, grand theft, and burglary in connection with their slayings. \"This case was about killing for the sake of the killing,\" Assistant State Attorney Andreas Gardiner told the court, according to [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/wade-wilson-murder-florida-death-penalty-b2561463.html). \"Strangulation is the epitome of life slipping through someone's hands.\" \"It's about what Wade Wilson did to Christine Melton and Diane Ruiz. And make no mistake about it: despite his bragging, his boasting, and the excitement he wants to feel, this case was nothing more than a graphic, vulgar display of power,\" said Gardiner. \"This was about killing, for the sake of killing.\" In closing arguments, prosecutor Andreas Gardiner reiterated what defendant— Court TV (@CourtTV) [#WadeWilson]told detectives, \"I've already done it once, I'll do it again.\" The defense admitted that Wilson strangled two women to death but says this… [pic.twitter.com/uZ6uVVdDJ8] [June 12, 2024] Wilson killed the women in October 2019 in two separate incidents and was arrested that same month. In his first mugshot, he sported several neck tattoos, including the phrase, \"BRED FOR WAR.\" But by the end of the year, Wilson added some new ink: a swastika tattoo on his shaved head that he showed off during a subsequent court appearance, WINK reported. Wilson waited in jail for nearly five years before the start of his trial earlier this week, during which he once again altered his appearance by sporting more swastika ink – this time below his right eye. He also tattooed stitching across his mouth, the words, \"HA HA HA,\" and \"glory\" on his face, courtroom photos showed. Wilson will be sentenced later this month and may face the death penalty.",

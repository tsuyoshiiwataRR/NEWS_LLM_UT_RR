Police say they’ve identified four, including man who was released from prison months earlier Victim was shot at twice in one day Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) By Nate Gartrell | ngartrell@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: June 13, 2024 at 2:28 p.m. | UPDATED: June 13, 2024 at 3:48 p.m. OAKLAND — Four people have been charged with murder in connection with the April 21 killing of a 17-year-old boy in Oakland.\nThe suspects have been identified in court records as Jamareae Perry, 25, of Oakland, Darryl Deloney Jr., 28, of Sacramento, Dawon Carter, 29, of Vallejo, and Dewayne Carter, 31, whose city of residence isn’t listed. The four have all been charged with murdering 17-year-old Dennis Rumble and with being felons in possession of firearms.\nRumble was shot and killed April 21, outside a gas station on the 9600 block of Edes Avenue in East Oakland, during a large gathering of cars and people, authorities said. Surveillance footage reportedly shows an argument break out and five people take aim and fire at Rumble shortly thereafter, some with handguns and at least one with a rifle.\nRumble — who had been shot at just hours earlier at a Burger King on Hegenberger Road — was wounded in the head. Police identified the four suspects based on surveillance footage, authorities said.\nTwo others were arrested — one on suspicion of murder, the other on suspicion of accessory — but they were both released without charges, records show. Police also believe that Dewayne Carter was one of the people who shot at Rumble at the Burger King earlier in the day, but he has not been charged in connection with that incident.\nDawon Carter was released from prison in an attempted murder case roughly five months before Rumble was killed. That case stemmed from a 2009 robbery and shooting in Contra Costa County, when Carter was just 14. He was sentenced to 24 years as an adult, but re-sentenced as a juvenile and released from jail last Nov. 15, records show.\nProsecutors and the public defender’s office in Contra Costa both agreed to Carter’s release, according to court records. In an autobiographical YouTube video posted less than a month after Rumble was killed, Carter reflects on his time in prison, enrolling in college after his release and how he has become “a better person” after incarceration.\n“It’s a blessing just to be here,” Carter says on the video.\nPerry, identified by police as the man who fired a rifle at Rumble, was charged in 2020 with committing a home invasion robbery, and later sentenced to a year he’d spent in jail and probation. In 2022, he was sentenced to 180 days in jail for allegedly possessing a gun found by an Oakland officer during a traffic stop, records show.\nAlameda County Judge Thomas Nixon, who sentenced Perry, warned him to “please don’t have any violations” in the future because “I don’t want to see you go to prison,” according to a court transcript.\n“Yes, sir,” Perry replied. Records show he avoided legal trouble until he was arrested Thursday on suspicion of killing Rumble.\nPerry’s five co-defendants in the 2020 robbery case included Sebron Russell, who is one of four men now charged with the Jan. 1 killing of Oakland police Officer Tuan Le. Police said in court records at the time that Russell was an associate of an Oakland-based gang and that Perry was a member.\nAll four suspects are being held without bail and have not yet appeared in court, according to public records.\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Report an error Policies and Standards Contact Us Most Popular Most Popular Dear Abby: I lied about my pregnancy, and now I feel guilty Dear Abby: I lied about my pregnancy, and now I feel guilty Miss Manners: I live alone in a big house, and you wouldn’t believe the insults I get Miss Manners: I live alone in a big house, and you wouldn't believe the insults I get Ask Amy: Our wedding was happy.

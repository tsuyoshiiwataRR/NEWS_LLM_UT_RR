    "text": "LANSING, Mich. (WLNS) — Two men charged with voter intimidation in a 2020 robocall scheme were properly criminally charged by the Office of the Michigan Attorney General, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled Thursday. Jack Burkman, 57, and Jacob Wohl, 25, were charged in October 2020 “for allegedly orchestrating a series of robocalls aimed at suppressing the vote of predominantly black voters in Detroit in the 2020 general election by promoting falsehoods,” a news release from the Office of the Attorney General reports, “that: - voting by mail would place voters’ personal information in a public database that will be used by police departments to track down individuals with outstanding warrants; - voting by mail would place voters’ personal information in a public database that will be used by credit card companies to collect outstanding debts; and - the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were attempting to utilize vote by mail records to track individuals for mandatory vaccines.” This is the actual audio from one of the robocalls, the Office of the Attorney General reported. They were each charged in 36th District Court in Detroit with: - One count of election law – bribing/intimidating voters, a five-year felony; - One count of conspiracy to commit an election law violation, a five-year felony; - One count of using a computer to commit the crime of election law – intimidating voters, a seven-year felony; and - Using a computer to commit the crime of conspiracy, a seven-year felony. The cases were bound over to the Circuit Court and when the court refused to quash the charges, the defendants appealed their cases to through the Michigan court system. In a news release, the AG’s press office explained the Michigan Supreme Court ruling as follows: The Court also provided a narrowing construction of the statute, ruling that the language “other corrupt means or device” prohibits intentionally false speech that is related to voting requirements or procedures and is made in an attempt to deter or influence an elector’s vote. Based on this ruling, the Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the criminal charges brought by the State, asking that court to review the conduct at issue under the newly issued limiting construction of this provision of election law.News Release, Office of the Attorney General of Michigan, June 13, 2024 In that release, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel stressed the importance to prohibiting intimidating actions and voter suppression, vowing to continue the prosecution of the duo. “This voter intimidation law is a vital protection for Michigan voters and proponents of a participatory democracy,” said Nessel in the news release. “Intentionally false statements to deceive any Michigan voter from exercising their rights at the ballot box are illegal, and I’m grateful to have this ruling make that abundantly clear, especially as we head toward another presidential election this autumn. We look forward to continuing with the criminal case and bringing this matter to trial.”",

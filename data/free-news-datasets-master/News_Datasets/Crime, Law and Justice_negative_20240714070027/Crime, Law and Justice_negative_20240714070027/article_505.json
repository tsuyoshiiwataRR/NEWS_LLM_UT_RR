    "text": "An Edgewood man was sentenced in Harford County Circuit Court to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty May 8 to a drug charge related to two fatal overdoses, according to the Harford County State’s Attorney’s office.\nRonald Sullivan, 49, pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute narcotics, which violated his probation in a 2011 possession with intent to distribute case.\nThe most recent case stemmed from a fatal overdose Aug. 2, 2023. The state’s attorney office said that the person who died contacted Sullivan the night before the overdose to purchase drugs. After Sullivan’s arrest in that incident, investigators determined that a second person who died from a drug overdose also purchased drugs from Sullivan, in July 2023, the state’s attorney’s office said.\nSullivan was sentenced to 20 years on the possession with intent to distribute charge, with all but 15 years suspended. He was also sentenced to five years for violating his probation. The two sentences will be served consecutively, the state’s attorney’s office said.\n“Drug distribution in not a victimless crime,” State’s Attorney Alison Healey said in a news release. “Too often our community members lose loved ones to the poison that is being peddled on our streets by individuals with no regard for human life or the laws by which we are required to live. Overdose cases can be incredibly challenging, and I am proud of Assistant State’s Attorney [Stuart] Welch and his efforts to ensure that the families of these two victims received closure in their loss.”",

    "text": "Prescott massage parlor busted for allegedly operating as prostitution house Authorities say the operator also owns other parlors in the state PRESCOTT, AZ (AZFamily) — A massage parlor in Prescott was just busted for running an alleged illegal sex scheme. The Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office said detectives assigned to the Partners Against Narcotics Trafficking (PANT) task force learned several months ago of illegal sex acts occurring at Perfect Spa near Montezuma and Leroux streets. Officers served a search warrant at the spa on Wednesday. They collected evidence and arrested Yuzhen Qi, 64, on several felony charges, including pandering, transporting a person for prostitution, and operating a house or enterprise of prostitution. Authorities are investigating other massage parlors Qi operates in the state. Arizona Corporations Commission records show Qi is a registered owner of two massage parlors in Tucson: [Indeli Spa](https://ecorp.azcc.gov/BusinessSearch/BusinessInfo?entityNumber=23564422) on 1st Avenue and [Melody Spa](https://ecorp.azcc.gov/BusinessSearch/BusinessInfo?entityNumber=23151634) on Oracle Road. The sheriff’s office asked the public to come to them for any additional information involving human trafficking. This investigation is still active. See a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

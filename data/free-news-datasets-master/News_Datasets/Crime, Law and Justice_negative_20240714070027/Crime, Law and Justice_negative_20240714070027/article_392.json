    "text": "SAN ANTONIO (KSAT) - A Texas man’s primary means of transportation may be what caused a fire that killed him. Arson investigators said they believe a motorized mobility chair somehow sparked a deadly house fire on Tuesday. Those who knew that man say they’re heartbroken. The charred shell of a home at the corner of Christian and Winneway drives cuts a hole in the hearts of neighbors. It’s a reminder of the man who lived and ultimately died there. “He was friendly, you know, ‘hello,’ you know, got his mail. Occasionally we chat about the yard or whatever,” said Leslie Gill, a neighbor. Gill and her family have lived in the southeast side neighborhood in San Antonio for the past 25 years. She said she was surprised to return home to firefighters putting out flames next door. Wednesday morning, she said she was devastated after learning her neighbor had died. “Just the way that it happened. It’s, it’s sad. It’s very sad,” Gill said. The 68-year-old, whose name wasn’t released right away, apparently used a motorized scooter or mobility chair to get around. “He would come out and the battery would go down. So one day he spent about 45 minutes in the chair trying to get back,” Bular Swain said. Swain said he was amused about the problems in the past, but arson investigators now believe that chair caused the fire. Crews found the victim in the kitchen with a fire extinguisher nearby. “But he was a very funny, friendly man, and we are going to miss him. As a matter of fact, his mom and my grandmother went to school together,” Swain said. To Swain, he was a member of the family, to others an important part of their community. According to people who live nearby, a hearse and limo at the home are actually leftovers from their neighbor’s previous career. They say for many years, he worked in the funeral business.

    "text": "WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) — House Republicans are blasting Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for what they call an “unprecedented politicized indictment” of former president Donald Trump.\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and other Republicans are going after Bragg.\n“Alvin Bragg’s prosecution of President Trump was personal. It was based on politics. And it was wrong,” Jordan said.\nJordan calls the indictment unprecedented. He says Bragg targeted former president Donald Trump by charging him with felonies for falsifying business records, which he says is usually filed as a misdemeanor.\n“That’s the story. And that story is consistent with the facts,” Jordan said.\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) doesn’t think the verdict has legs to stand on.\n“So, the irony here is this is going to be vacated. And this trial was all about trying to influence an election,” Massie said.\nDemocrats criticized Republicans for holding the hearing in the first place, and say the GOP is only focused on influencing American’s perception of the former president.\n“House Republicans are willing to do just about anything to protect Donald Trump from the consequences of his actions,” Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said.\nNadler called the allegations baseless, and Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) took time to make fun of Republicans who met with Trump during his visit to DC.\n“Show hands for anyone in the room who hung out with a felon today. Hey, guys, I want to get your hands up,” Swalwell said.\nThis won’t be the last hearing about Bragg, as he has agreed to testify in front of Congress on July 12th, the day after Trump is sentenced.",

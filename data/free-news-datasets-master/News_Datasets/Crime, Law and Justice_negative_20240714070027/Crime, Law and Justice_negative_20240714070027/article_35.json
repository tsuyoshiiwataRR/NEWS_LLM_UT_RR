    "text": "18-year-old shot after high school graduation in Boston’s Seaport By Kimberly Bookman , Dakota Antelman June 13, 2024 Share\nBOSTON (WHDH) - An 18-year-old was shot and taken to an area hospital Thursday shortly after her high school graduation in Boston’s Seaport neighborhood, officials said.\nPolice responded to the area of 200 Pier 4 Boulevard near 11:45 a.m. after a report of a shooting, according to Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox.\nOnce on scene, Cox said, officers found the teen suffering from non-life-threatening gunshot wounds. She was then rushed to the hospital.\nPolice said the victim had just attended her graduation for Boston Collaborative High School. Though the school was holding a graduation ceremony at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Cox said the shooting did not happen at the graduation itself.\nPolice said that there were two crime scenes Thursday — one inside a parking garage near the museum and another on Pier 4 Boulevard, where a black car involved had parked. Witnesses said the recent high school graduate in the passenger’s seat of the car was shot.\n“I hear, ‘She’s shot,’ and then everybody’s screaming and yelling, and I ran over and I started dialing 911,” said witness Alexa Wirth.\nAnother woman, Sam Miller, also saw the incident.\n“There was blood on their arm, not sure where the gunshot was, but they were pulled out and taken into the stretcher,” Miller said.\nCox said the incident did not appear to be a random event. Though an investigation was ongoing, he said there may have been some sort of altercation before shots rang out.\nCox asked for the public’s support as the investigation continued, urging anyone with information about this incident to reach out to authorities.\n“To say this is an unfortunate incident would be an understatement,” said Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden. “This is a travesty. This should not happen.”\n“High school students attending a graduation on a beautiful day like today shouldn’t have to have that day marked by a shooting taking place and a young woman having to go to the hospital,” Hayden said.\nHayden said authorities were “in the sprawls of an active investigation” and said officials will pursue this case vigorously. He said his office will work to bring the person or people behind this shooting to justice.\n“When you think of the fact that someone is leaving one of the most important days of their lives, in a positive way, to have them come out to now, one of the worst days, I’m sure, of their lives, is really unacceptable in this city,” said state Rep. Russell Holmes, who works nearby in Seaport.\nHe said he saw the aftermath of the shooting.\n“I saw some kids running away, very active, don’t know if they were one of the suspects, but when I pulled up, that’s what caught my attention,” Holmes said.\nHe said the people were wearing caps and gowns.\nSKY7-HD was over the scene near 12:15 p.m. and spotted several police vehicles parked in the area. Police had an entire block of Pier 4 Boulevard taped off near its intersection with Northern Avenue.\nThe shooting happened in a busy part of the Seaport that was bustling with activity near midday. Many onlookers gathered in the area while the police investigation continued.\n“Never in my life did I imagine that there was a shooting here, so this is quite shocking,” said Terrance Flynn, who works in the area.\nAs of 4 p.m., police have not made any arrests and have not recovered the weapon involved.\nThis is a developing story; stay with 7NEWS on-air and online for the latest updates.\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

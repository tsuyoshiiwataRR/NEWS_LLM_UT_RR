    "text": "Read full article The Telegraph ‘Schizophrenic’ went on ‘motiveless spree of violence’ on London Underground Telegraph reporters June 13, 2024 at 11:57 p.m. · 4 min read Link Copied A CCTV image said to be Donovan Kenlyn\nA man went on a “motiveless” 35-minute “spree of violence” against strangers on the London Underground, including pushing a passenger on to the rails, a court heard.\nDonovan Kenlyn, 39, “chased and punched” Tube user Samer Jawad at Baker Street station in October 2022, a jury at the Old Bailey was told.\nMinutes later, Mr Kenlyn got off a train at Finchley Road station and “propelled” Angel Cambeiro on to the rails, narrowly missing the ones that were live.\nHe then travelled to nearby West Hampstead station where he struck a third man, Peter Acton. None of the three men knew the defendant.\nMr Kenlyn accepts that he was involved in all three incidents but denies the charges because he was suffering with schizophrenia.\n‘Physical actions aren’t in dispute’ Judge Philip Katz KC told the jury: “The physical actions aren’t in dispute. This is a case where you will be considering mental health, at least.”\nOpening the trial at the Old Bailey on Thursday, Michael Williams, prosecuting, said: “On the morning of Thursday October 27 2022, Donovan Kenlyn undertook a spree of violence against members of the public on the London Underground.”\nHe said the spree lasted 35 minutes and was “without any known motive”.\nMr Williams said: “It is accepted on behalf of the defendant that he was the man who punched Mr Jawad, who caused Mr Cambeiro to fall on to the tracks, and who struck Mr Acton.”\nShortly after 10am, Mr Kenlyn got on the Central Line at Hanger Lane Underground station, west London – the closest stop to his house at the time.\nAn hour and 20 minutes later, he was seen on CCTV at Baker Street wearing a bobble hat and dark clothing.\nMr Jawad was visiting London and travelling to the station to meet a friend at nearby Regent’s Park.\nWhen he went to leave the Bakerloo Line train, he “felt a presence to his left” and saw Mr Kenlyn, who had not been on board until then.\n‘He had his eyes set on me’ In a witness statement read to the court, Mr Jawad said: “I then realised this person was actually facing me, and that they were talking aggressively towards me – they were being very hostile towards me, but I just didn’t know why.”\nHe said Mr Kenlyn accused of him of “saying something” including “did you say black?” and the complainant fled down the platform.\nMr Jawad said: “It was like he had his eyes set on me, he was furious and I was still running, he was still saying ‘did you say black?’\n“At some point while I was being chased, I said, ‘I didn’t say anything, I didn’t say anything’.”\nCCTV footage played to the court showed Mr Jawad on the floor and Mr Kenlyn hitting him.\nMr Jawad said he was punched “two or three times” while he was on the ground and two landed on his face.\nFellow passengers tried to intervene and Mr Jawad again tried to flee.\nHe said: “I wasn’t sure where I was going to flee to. [I was] trying to find people for safety.”\n‘Very frightening incident’ However, Mr Kenlyn caught up in the station concourse and Mr Jawad said: “That was when he stuck me on the right-hand side, I didn’t know where he was coming from or what had struck me for that matter.\n“I fell forwards to the ground and thought I was going to black out.”\nMr Williams said that Mr Jawad suffered no significant injuries but it was a “very frightening incident”.\nWithin nine minutes, Mr Kenlyn was at Finchley Road station – three stops away on the Jubilee Line or one on the Metropolitan Line.\nMr Williams said Mr Cambeiro spotted Kenlyn “looking aggressive” and walking towards him along the platform with a clenched fist.\nThe defendant raised his fist and the next thing Mr Cambeiro knew, he was on the tracks and had suffered a dislocated and broken elbow, the prosecutor added.\nMr Williams said: “Mr Cambeiro confirms that without the help of the staff and his fellow passengers, he would have simply been unable to get back on to the platform, owing to the injuries in his right arm.”\nMinutes later at West Hampstead station, Mr Kenlyn ran into a carriage after Mr Acton and struck him, causing him to fall on to the seat dividers and fracture his ribs.\nMr Kenlyn left the carriage after striking Mr Acton and by 1.45pm that day he had returned to the stop by his house.\nMr Kenlyn, of North Circular Road, Ealing, west London, is charged with attempted murder and assault causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Mr Cambeiro, of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Mr Acton and assault by beating against Mr Jawad. The trial continues.",

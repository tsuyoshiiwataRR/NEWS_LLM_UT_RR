    "text": "ST. LOUIS ( KMOV /Gray News) - Social media can be a great place to connect with people and keep up with the latest headlines, but a Missouri man says a shared video has made his life a nightmare for the last week. Bill Astle has been the subject of a now-viral video that showed him appearing not to scan any of his items while checking out at an area Walmart. “This man is really just stealing everything,” a woman can be heard saying in the video. “So open about it, look at the screen, nothing is ringing up.” But Astle says he was just doing his job. “I’m not a thief. I’m being pictured and painted as a thief on the internet,” Astle said. According to Astle, he works for Spark, Walmart’s delivery service. When shopping, he says he scans the items from his phone as he grabs them. “Everything is done off the phone, so when we get to the register, we’re not actually scanning a single item,” he said. Astle says when fellow team members get to the register, they just scan their phone into the self-checkout and bag the items. And yet when he did this last month, he was unwittingly being filmed. “Millions and millions of views,” Astle said. The video has since been viewed over 16 million times with many viewers calling Astle a shoplifter and for police to arrest him. “I’ve had customers say, ‘Hey, didn’t I see you on the internet? Didn’t you steal items?’ And then I have to explain to people what I was doing,” he said. Astle says he has receipts that show he was working at Walmart that day as he works to clear his name and get his life back to normal. According to Astle, there was an item he paid for that day personally before the video ended and it was Mother’s Day flowers for his wife. “They would have seen when I got done with the Spark delivery order, I scanned two dozen roses and used my debit card to pay for them,” Astle said. Astle urged social media users to not post videos of strangers, especially if they are not certain of what’s going on. Copyright 2024 KMOV via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",

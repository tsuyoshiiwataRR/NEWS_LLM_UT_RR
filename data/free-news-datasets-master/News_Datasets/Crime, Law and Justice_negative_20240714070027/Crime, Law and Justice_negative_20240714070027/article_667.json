    "text": "Three suspects have been apprehended by law enforcement for their involvement in a network focused on creating counterfeit admission letters from the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB.\nThe Police Force Public Relations Officer, Olumiyiwa Adejobi, made this revelation on Thursday.\nAs per Adejobi, the trio was taken into custody for allegations related to conspiracy, computer-related forgery, and system interference, which are violations of sections 8, 13, and 27 of the Cybercrimes Act 2015, as amended.\nThe individuals implicated in this case are Effa Leonard Mpama, aged 34; Ibang Ernest Jerome, aged 38; and Eshiet Odotukana Benson, aged 38.\nThese three suspects, in collaboration with their accomplices, orchestrated a plan to unlawfully access JAMB’s restricted Central Admission Processing System (CAPS) and e-facility.\nAccording to reports by the police, they proceeded to alter and erase existing admission letters of other candidates, replacing them with counterfeit information. This led to the creation of fabricated admission documents that were utilized to gain admission into universities and for enrolment in the National Youth Service Corps program, thereby subverting the entire JAMB admission procedure.\nA statement released stated: “Upon apprehension, the suspects admitted their participation in the scheme, substantiating the substantial evidence already gathered.\n“Effa Leonard Mpama and Ibang Ernest Jerome, along with their accomplices, collect personal details of aspiring candidates, forwarding them to Eshiet Odotukana Benson, who acquires CAPS links from individuals named Daniel and Chris. Daniel and Chris, who are currently at large, are employed at JAMB Computer Based Test (CBT) Centres situated in FAN and UNICAL, respectively, in Calabar, Cross River State.\n“Moreover, a digital forensic examination led to the discovery of four fictitious domains, websites, and two principal culprits of a syndicate in Imo State accountable for the creation of these deceptive domains and associated websites.”\n“Furthermore, the third suspect, Eshiet, possessing access to the CAPS links, goes to any CBT center and accesses the JAMB e-facility using the login credentials of a candidate with prior admission. Subsequently, he proceeds to modify the collected details to fabricate a counterfeit admission letter.”\nThe Police PRO mentioned that once the investigation concludes, the suspects will face charges in court.",

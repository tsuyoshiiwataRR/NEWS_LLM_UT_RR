    "text": "On Thursday, an Ekiti State High Court, Ado Ekiti Division, handed down death sentences by hanging to four individuals for their involvement in armed robbery, murder, and conspiracy.\nThe defendants, namely Ogunleye Sola, Adebayo Ebenezer, Lasisi Afeez, and Ojo Oba, were also convicted and sentenced to lifelong imprisonment for attempted murder.\nThe criminal acts took place on May 29, 2017, at Oyan Orete Camp, Ijan Ekiti, where the defendants robbed the camp occupants at gunpoint. During the incident, Olasunkanmi Ramon was murdered, and Alhaji Adeleye Usman was attacked with a cutlass on the head by the defendants.\nThe charges against the defendants included offenses under Section 6(b) of the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Act, Cap. R11, Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2004, as well as Murder and Attempted Murder contravening sections 319(1) and 320 of the Criminal Code Law, Cap.C16, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012.‚Äù\nJulius Ajibare, the Director of Public Prosecutions representing Ekiti State, presented five witnesses and seven exhibits to support the case.\nThe defendants were represented by their counsel, Chris Omokhafe and Oluwaseun Banji, who presented evidence in their defense and called two witnesses for support.\nIn the ruling, Justice Olukayode Ogundana stated that the prosecution successfully established all charges against the defendants beyond a reasonable doubt.\nConsequently, the judge convicted all four defendants and handed them death sentences by hanging for their involvement in conspiracy, armed robbery, and murder. Additionally, they were sentenced to life imprisonment for the charge of attempted murder.",

Data Breach Affecting Adventist Health Tulare: Lawsuit Investigation Attorneys working with ClassAction.org are looking into whether a class action lawsuit can be filed in light of the data breach affecting Adventist Health Tulare. As part of their investigation, they need to hear from individuals who received a notice stating they were impacted. Signature Performance, an agency contracted by Adventist Health Tulare to handle payment collections, recently discovered a data security incident that has impacted over 70,000 patients.

The investigation revealed that an unknown entity had accessed specific files within the network. This breach reportedly affected 70,802 patients of Adventist Health Tulare, each of whom will receive a personalized notification from Signature Performance detailing the extent of the compromised information, the [health care provider's website states](https://www.adventisthealth.org/news/2024/june/data-breach-by-signature-performance-affecting-adventist-health-tulare-patients/).

You may be able to start a class action lawsuit to recover compensation for loss of privacy, time spent dealing with the breach, out-of-pocket costs, and more.

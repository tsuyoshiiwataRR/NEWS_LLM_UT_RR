    "text": "A New Orleans jury late Wednesday night convicted a man of [shooting another man to death](https://www.nola.com/news/crime_police/two-stabbed-uptown-armed-robbery-reported-in-new-orleans-over-24-hour-period/article_ef20e2c2-f14d-11eb-b566-afd31cbed4fe.html) three years ago in Treme, in what prosecutors described as a drug-infested apartment complex. The jury found 44-year-old Barry Bowie guilty as charged of second-degree murder, obstruction of justice and possession of a firearm by a felon in the June 7, 2021 killing of Henry James in the 1900 block of St. Ann Street. According to an affidavit for an arrest warrant, witnesses told New Orleans police that the men had argued at the apartments before Bowie shot James multiple times. But when prosecutors Forrest Ladd and Carlos Torres called four alleged eyewitnesses to the stand, they told a different story: They were high on drugs and couldn’t remember anything. A fifth eyewitness died of an overdose, prosecutors said, before he could testify. Instead, over the three-day trial this week in Orleans Parish Criminal District Court, prosecutors showed surveillance footage that placed Bowie at the crime scene holding what appeared to be a handgun, as well as other video footage that tracked his movements throughout the evening. Defense attorneys Judson Mitchell and Jessica Natal argued that without witnesses to identify Bowie as the killer, his mere presence at the scene wasn’t enough to convict him. Prosecutors also played a jail call during which Bowie admitting to being at the shooting. But the clip, Natal argued, only proved that Bowie had fled after the gunfire like several other bystanders. The jury deliberated for four hours, until just after 10 p.m., before it delivered its guilty verdict. Criminal District Court Judge Kimya Holmes scheduled Bowie’s sentencing hearing, where he will face a mandatory life-in-prison sentence, for July 31.",

    "text": "He complained about everything from artwork with rainbows in it to \"LGBTQ lanyards.\" By Mira Lazine Thursday, June 13, 2024 Photo: Shutterstock A dad who accused school officials of “grooming and abusing” children just got hit with a $20 million defamation lawsuit.\nDamon Gettier, the parent and defendant in question, appeared at a May 18, 2023 meeting with the school board where he, after having made Facebook posts angry about gay people existing at the school, went on a long rant where he called LGBTQ+ materials at schools indoctrination and grooming, the Roanoke Times reports.\nRelated: Public school tried to ban student’s lesbian art work because it’s “offensive” to Christians Her piece was about religious trauma that LGBTQ+ people deal with, and it apparently struck a nerve.\n“What I’m here to talk about is the child abuse, grooming, conditioning, and indoctrination by sexual predators disguised as teachers and staff at Glen Cove Elementary,” Gettier said.\nStay connected to your community Connect with the issues and events that impact your community at home and beyond by subscribing to our newsletter.\nDaily Weekly Good News “We have five plus staff and faculty conditioning, grooming, and abusing children, and no one says a thing… The teachers and staff need to teach their curriculum and not their woke, progressive ideologies,” he said.\n“I will not stand for it!”\nGlen Cove Elementary School Assistant Principal Tobie McPhail, who filed the lawsuit last month, referred to Gettier’s claims as false and harmful, having caused her emotional distress and damaged her career.\nGettier was also angry about trans issues being discussed in front of his son, accusing a teacher of saying that “a boy could be a girl and a girl could be a boy and they could decide.”\n“I had to explain to my nine-year-old what transgender was because Glen Cove Elementary woke staff put me in a situation where I had to,” he said.\nGettier also complained about a music teacher putting up rainbow decorations across her classroom. He was upset when a psychologist had an “LGBTQ lanyard” and that students drew art involving Pride flags, and he was also angry that teachers with “woke, progressive ideologies” were bringing up topics he didn’t want kids to hear about.\n“The guidance counselor, the school psychologist, the assistant principal, and the music teacher were bent on indoctrinating our children on LGBTQA and not reading, writing, and arithmetic.”\nOther parents spoke at the meeting against LGBTQ+ people, but Gettier was the only one who named specific members of the staff and accused them of grooming children.\nThe school board banned rainbow decorations after Gettier’s outburst and implemented Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s (R) policies for transgender youth in schools, which include the forced misgendering or deadnaming of kids who don’t have parents’ permission, allowing youth to “opt-out” of being near trans kids in gendered spaces, and forced outing of trans kids to their parents.\nMcPhail’s attorneys, John Fishwick and Daniel Martin of Roanoke, described her as “a long-time educator and administrator who has worked tirelessly throughout her career to ensure that all children receive a quality education in a safe learning environment.”\n“We have great respect for her and look forward to moving ahead with her case.”\nMcPhail is asking for $5 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages.\nGettier’s outrage inspired protests shortly after in solidarity with the school, as many in the community felt they were being unfairly targeted. Protestors held up signs calling to support their teachers and saying that their favorite color is the rainbow.\nThere were arrests at board meetings in July and August last year after people opposed the school’s policies regarding LGBTQ+ representation. The arrestees opposed the discriminatory new policies. Causes for arrest vary from trespassing to disruption.\nDon't forget to share:\nNews (USA) Anti-Trans Discrimination Virginia Support vital LGBTQ+ journalism Reader contributions help keep LGBTQ Nation free, so that queer people get the news they need, with stories that mainstream media often leaves out.

    "text": "General News of Thursday, 13 June 2024 Source: [www.ghanaweb.com](/GhanaHomePage/aboutus.php) Richard Jakpa has made another significant revelation regarding Attorney General, Godfred Yeboah Dame's attempts at implicating Dr. [Cassiel Ato Forson](/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=2581) in the ongoing ambulance case The third accused in the case claimed that the AG urged him to cooperate in having Dr. Forson jailed for six months, thereby declaring his parliamentary seat vacant for a by-election. According to Jakpa, this conversation took place at the home of his cousin, Justice Yonni Kulendi, where the AG allegedly pressured him to provide incriminating evidence against Dr. Forson. During cross-examination led by Dr. Abdul Basit Aziz Bamba, Jakpa testified that the AG mentioned being under considerable pressure from President [Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo](/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=-253) and former Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, to secure Dr. Forson's conviction. “… It was then he (AG) told me my brother, I am under pressure and I said, that is not my problem. “Then he (AG) said 'the finance minister and the president are on my neck mounting pressure. They want this case to be finished by the first week in May',” Jakpa said, according to a report by myjoyonline.com. He continued to say that “I (Jakpa) asked him why the first week in May? “Then he (AG) said you may not know but according to the Constitution, you cannot have a bye-election six months to a general election. “So if I can cooperate with him and get Ato Forson just one month in Nsawam, his seat will be declared vacant and we will go for a by-election. “And I told him (AG) that going for a byelection in Central region how sure are you to win that election?” “Then he said, Central region they are cheap, we will pump money in it and we will win the election.” Richard Jakpa added that the AG said when they win the election, the “NDC will come and beg us for pardon and we will use it to get our things to get through in parliament.” In response to Jakpa's testimony, representatives from Dr. [Cassiel Ato Forson](/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=2581)'s legal team have indicated their intention to further scrutinise the audio evidence and statements provided by Jakpa. They emphasised the significance of these allegations in relation to the ongoing trial, particularly concerning the conduct and impartiality expected from legal authorities.

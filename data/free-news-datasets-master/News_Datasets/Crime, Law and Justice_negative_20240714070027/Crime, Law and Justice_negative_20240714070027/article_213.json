    "text": "Man denies raping woman in Dublin and tells gardai he should sue witnesses\nDublin District Court heard that the defendant, who is in his 20s, made a lengthy reply to the charge.\nA man has denied raping a female in Dublin and told gardai he should sue witnesses who made accusations against him.\nDublin District Court heard that the defendant, who is in his 20s, made a lengthy reply to the charge.\n\"I didn't do any of this to anyone; I just tried to help them and look at what happened. I unfortunately found myself in the wrong place, at the wrong time, in a house where alcohol is abused.\n\"I don't understand why they want to harm me by alleging this. In their own statements, they said that I gave them alcohol; they decided to drink, to listen to music and have fun, and they are accusing me of things that I have not done. I should be suing them for this\".\nHe appeared at Dublin District Court after gardai charged him with the alleged offence, which allegedly happened on a date earlier this year.\nJudge Shalom Binchy ordered him to obey conditions: no contact with witnesses and signing three days a week at a garda station. She also told him he must surrender his national ID card and not apply for replacement travel documents.\nHe has the legal right to anonymity.\nDefence solicitor Morgan Redmond said his client understood the bail terms.\nThe man, accompanied to court by his partner, listened to the proceedings with the aid of an interpreter and was ordered to appear again in September for directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions.\nLegal aid was granted to the accused, who works full-time, earns about 400 a week, and pays rent.",

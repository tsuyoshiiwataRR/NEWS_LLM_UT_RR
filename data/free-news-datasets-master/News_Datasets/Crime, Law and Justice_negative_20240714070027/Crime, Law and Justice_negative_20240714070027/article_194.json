    "text": "President Joe Biden unleashed a new ad showing scenes of the January 6 attack as felon Donald Trump visited to meet Republicans at the scene of that crime. Trump says, “We will give them (Jan. 6 defendants) pardons.” John Goodman, the narrator, says, \"Inciting them to try again. There is nothing more sacred than our democracy. But Donald Trump is ready to burn it all down.\" Fact check: True. “Three years ago, Donald Trump left a dark stain on American history when he incited a deadly insurrection against the Capitol,\" the ad states. \"He unleashed a violent mob on our Capitol police and blatantly disregards the law at every turn while pretending to care about law and order. The only thing that has changed in the past three years is that Donald Trump has now been convicted of 34 felonies. It’s past time his MAGA cronies see him for who he is: a twice-impeached fraud and a criminal.” Rep. Bennie Thompson is pissed. “After inciting a deadly insurrection that defiled the halls of Congress, how dare Trump show his face on these grounds,\" the Mississippi Democrat wrote in a statement. \"Congressional Republicans allow him to waltz in here when it’s known he has no regard for democracy. Since January 6th, Donald Trump, a twice-impeached convicted felon, has repeatedly doubled down on his disrespect for the rule of law and continues to sow hate and division. He still presents the same dire threat to our democracy that he did three years ago — and he’d be wise to head back to Mar-a-Lago and await his sentencing.\" Rep. Nancy Pelosi had some choice words for Trump. “Today, the instigator of an insurrection is returning to the scene of the crime,\" she wrote. \"January 6th was a crime against the Capitol that saw Nazi and Confederate flags flying under the dome that Lincoln built. It was a crime against the Constitution and its peaceful transfer of power in a desperate attempt to cling to power.\" \"And it was a crime against Members, heroic police officers and staff, that resulted in death, injury, and trauma that endure to this day.,\" she added. \"With his pledges to be a dictator on day one and seek revenge against his political opponents, Donald Trump comes to Capitol Hill today with the same mission of dismantling our democracy. But make no mistake — Trump has already cemented his legacy of shame in our hallowed halls.” The DNC isn't going to let the public forget about that attack on our Capitol. Disgusting: Off-topic, but what's going on with the back of Lumpy's head? Y'all know I worry about him:",

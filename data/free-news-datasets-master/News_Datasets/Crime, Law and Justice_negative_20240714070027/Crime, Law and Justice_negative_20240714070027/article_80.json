    "text": "Pennsylvania U.S. Senator John Fetterman was driving at a high rate of speed before slamming into another car on I-70 in Maryland this past Sunday Night. USA Today requested and received the accident report from Maryland State Police. It shows Fetterman was driving at a rate of speed \"well over\" the posted 70 miles per hour according to another driver he passed on the highway. Fetterman was driving a Chevrolet Traverse when he slammed into the back of a Chevrolet Impala. Fetterman, his wife and the driver of the Impala were taken to the hospital. The Maryland State Police did not test the Senator for alcohol or substance use. No citations were issued. The investigation of the crash is continuing. Senator Fetterman has not commented on the contents of the police report. Do you think if you were driving there would have been no test for substance abuse? No citation for causing an accident with injuries?\nSource: USA Today\nSee the police report here\nPhoto: Nathan Howard / Getty Images News / Getty Images",

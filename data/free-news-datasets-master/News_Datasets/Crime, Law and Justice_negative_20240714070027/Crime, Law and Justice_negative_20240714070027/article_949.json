    "text": "by: Simone Gibson\nPosted: Jun 12, 2024 / 03:57 PM EDT\nUpdated: Jun 12, 2024 / 03:57 PM EDT\nSHARE\nMACON, Ga. ( WRBL ) – A Georgia resident with a lengthy criminal history of making death threats and arson was sentenced to serve 60 months behind bars in federal prison after falsely claiming to be a U.S. Secret Service and FBI agent in an attempt to get his case drop while in custody on Wednesday.\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Georgia said 56-year-old Travis Leroy Ball from Barnesville, Georgia, received a 60-month-long prison sentence along with three years of supervised release on Wednesday. Ball previously pled guilty to mailing threatening communications on Jan. 19.\nBased on court records and statements filed in court, the FBI obtained a letter on March 10, 2023, addressed to U.S. Court Judge Marc. Treadwell, where the writer pretended to be a U.S. Secret Service agent who investigated the defendant’s prior case. The letter, which authorities later determined was written by Ball, demanded that charges in Ball’s recent case should be dismissed and that he should be released.\nBall also used the name of a former cellmate to write letters to the U.S. District Court in Valdosta, Georgia, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington D.C. in March and May of 2023. The letters threatened to kill employees and demanded that Ball’s photos and personal information be removed from jail records.\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office said Ball even sent a letter to the Upson County Sheriff’s Office in July 2023, pretending to be an FBI agent working on a top-secret case demanding Ball’s photos and personal information be deleted from jail records.\nAfter obtaining the letters, the FBI compared the letters, handwriting, postage stamps, letterhead, verbiage and the “INMATE MAIL” stamps and determined that Ball wrote the letters while in custody.\nBall’s DNA was also compared to the letter sent to the U.S. Courthouse in Valdosta and the letter sent to Treadwell. The results confirmed Ball’s DNA on each letter. Authorities found writing materials and stamps in Ball’s cell as well.\nThe FBI the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Federal Protective Services, the U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Upson County Sheriff’s Office investigated Ball’s case. Deputy Criminal Chief Will Keyes prosecuted the case.",

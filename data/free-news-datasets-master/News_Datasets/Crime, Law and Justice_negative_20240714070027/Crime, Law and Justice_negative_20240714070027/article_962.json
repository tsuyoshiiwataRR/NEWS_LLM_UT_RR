    "text": "Amber Portwood is \"scared\" and \"worried\" about her missing fiance.\nThe 'Teen Mom OG' star's partner Gary Wayt was reported missing earlier this week and the 34-year-old beauty - who met her partner on a dating app in 2023 - admitted his disappearance is a \"huge deal\", particularly because there hadn't been anything dramatic happen before he vanished.\nShe said in a video shared to YouTube: “This is a huge deal, his parents, everybody is very worried. I am worried.\n“There was not a big blowout fight or anything like that, OK. He is a missing person right now.\"\nAmber told how Gary left the North Carolina house they are staying at without his phone but was later spotted alone at Walgreens on Sunday (09.06.24), and though he took his keys and wallet, he doesn't have GPS in his car to find his way around.\nShe said: “We are in the mountains. He has never driven in the mountains. We are very scared right now.”\nShe then tearfully added: “Nobody has found or heard from him yet. I’m trying my best to not think the worst. I have not ate [sic] in three days. I slept maybe an hour.”\nThe TV star dismissed reports she and her fiance had had an \"explosive argument\" before he disappeared as she seemingly referred to previous claims she allegedly attacked ex-boyfriend Andrew Glennon with a machete.\nShe said: “I am not what people have been saying about me all of these years.\n“I changed a long time ago, OK, you have to understand this. Please listen to what I am saying, I am an honest person to you guys.\n“We have not had explosive fights. We are very in love, this man asked me to be with him, this man then asked me to marry him.\n“I have not touched this man in any horrible way. He does not touch me in any horrible way. We do not yell at each other … Please understand this, people change.”\nBut the former '16 + Pregnant' star admitted she and Gary had had an \"emotional\" conversation, which she didn't provide specific details of but explained it came from \"his parents being Vietnamese\" and him being who he is.\nAmber - who has Leah, 15, with Gary Shirley and six-year-old James with Andrew - asked fans to pray for her fiance and described him as the \"love of [her] life\".\nShe added: “We have a beautiful relationship. This is the first time in my life that I have had a good man.”\nBryson City Police are investigating the disappearance of Gary, who is around 30 years old.",

    "text": "Vina Dewi Arsita and Rizky Rudiana, also known as Eky, were both 16 years old when they were killed in Cirebon, Indonesia, in August 2016.\nAuthorities quickly determined a motorcycle accident was responsible for their deaths.\nA scene from the movie depicting where Vina and Eky's bodies were found in Cirebon, West Java via @deecompany_official Instagram\nBut the police had to reopen the case after they had deemed they had solved it.\nThe circumstances for relooking into the case was strange, to say the least.\nMore investigations were conducted after a friend of Vina's was reportedly possessed by the dead girl's spirit and even revealed that the pair who died were apparently murdered by 11 gang members.\nEight of the suspects were arrested, and in May 2017 — just nine months after the teens' deaths — they were found guilty of sexually assaulting Vina and murdering the high-schoolers.\nHowever, three suspects purportedly remained at large.\nThat was until a recently released film about the murder and supernatural possession set the police in real life back on the trail of any others involved — and ended up with another arrest.\nMovie sparks calls for justice\nWhat was apparently a cold case became a hot topic of discussion in Indonesia, partly owing to Indonesians' love for horror flicks and the supernatural, and the pervasive sense of injustice of a real-life case that was conveyed.\n\"Vina: Sebelum 7 Hari\", which translates to \"Vina: Before 7 Days\", is now showing in Singapore to some rave reviews as well.\nDirected by Anggy Umbara, \"Vina: Sebelum 7 Hari\" was released on May 8, 2024, and quickly took the box office by storm.\nAfter just three weeks in cinemas in Indonesia, the film was seen almost 6 million times, making it the second-most watched in the country in 2024.\nThe movie's synopsis is clear-cut:\nThe actress (left) who played Vina (right) via @deecompany_official Instagram\nMarketing material from the movie\nScene from movie\nThe 2016 case\nThe purported facts and circumstances of the eight-year-old case already make for an intriguing read.\nDespite the motorbike and their mobile phones being intact, the police ruled the pair's deaths on Aug. 27, 2016 as a single-vehicle traffic accident .\nThe family more or less came to terms with it, as they were informed by the police of the outcome of their findings.\nThen three days after the deaths, something weird occurred.\nPossession of friend\nVina's older sister, Marliana, was informed that the spirit of her deceased younger sister had entered the body of a friend of Vina's.\nThe brother of the possessed lady told Marliana that \"your sister's spirit entered into my sister's body\".\nMarliana rushed to their house straight away.\n\"[The friend who was possessed by] Vina's spirit told us everything about what happened, she said 'don't be fooled by the police, it wasn't an accident... I was raped, killed, tortured, hit by wooden block',\" she told ABC .\nVina's father, family lawyer, and sister, Marliana via Warta Kota Live\nRecording of possession taken to police\nMarliana recorded the possession as a voice note.\nIn the recording, \"Pegi Setiawan\", the nickname of a member of a local motorbike gang, was mentioned.\nPegi Setiawan in real life via @creepyology/X\nMarliana subsequently took the recording to the police.\nGoing off on what was apparently a voice recording of a possession, the police acted on it and 11 gang members were identified as suspects.\nThey were part of the same motorcycle group as Pegi.\nEight were quickly found and arrested.\nPolice seemingly had retrieved or gathered more evidence by this time, including some of the suspects' motorbikes, phones and clothes, as well as some rocks and bits of bamboo, according to court documents seen by the ABC .\nEight convicted\nIn May 2017, they were found guilty of gang raping Vina and the premeditated murders of her and Eky.\nSeven of the guilty suspects were sentenced to life imprisonment, while one of them, who was underage, was sentenced to jail for eight years.\nBut the alleged ring-leader and main suspect, Pegi, who was identified by Vina's \"spirit\", remained at large for the next few years.\nFilm piques audience's curiosity\nThe film starts with the teenagers' bodies being found and depicts the aftermath, including the possession.\nWhat was portrayed on screen makes for graphic viewing for audiences, especially for those who know the background of the movie, which was already widely known for being based on a true story.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by anggy_umbara (@anggy_umbara)\nAs a result, many who have watched it have called the film out as \"exploitative\" in nature, as it was profiteering off a very real and recent tragedy, that has not fully concluded, given the film's depiction of events.\nHowever, the Jakarta Globe reported that Marliana recently said in the film's defence that it has played an important role in the case:\nShould the story have been portrayed differently?\nSome have suggested that a documentary would have been a more ethical portrayal of the murders as opposed to a fictional re-enactment, as this would have eliminated or made redundant elements that relied on the creative licence to craft a 100-minute narrative, which appeared as entertainment on screen.\nAnd such a retelling has had an effect in real life.\nWith the resurgence of interest in the case, videos on TikTok about the film have garnered more than 60 million views , and the case was transferred from the local police to West Java.\nIt was also reported in Indonesia that several motorcycle groups in Cirebon, West Java, even had to address the media in late May 2024 following the movie's release, to confirm that their members were not involved in Vina's murder.\nArrest made\nTwo weeks after the film's release, Pegi, now 27 and a construction worker , was found and arrested.\nIn 2016, he would have been about 19 when he allegedly committed the crimes.\nThe other two suspects, assumed to be part of the gang, supposedly remain at large.\nHowever, police have since suggested that any other suspects could have been made scapegoats, and that any additional persons of interest may not even actually exist.\nThe latest arrest was not without controversy.\nAt a police press conference in June 2024, Setiwan defended himself: \"I never committed the murder, this is slander... I am willing to die to prove that I am innocent.\"\nSince Pegi's arrest, the other eight perpetrators have retracted their admission statements, citing torture and abuse by investigators and lawyers are now calling for a re-trial.\nABC also reported that a movie exerting a real-world impact, via expediting investigations and forcing authorities to act, could make any arrest in the wake of public pressure problematic.\nThis was so as the authorities could be assumed to be reacting to public scrutiny and pressure to provide answers.\nInstead of solving a mystery or getting to the bottom of things, hasty action based on a presumption of guilt, could even lead to a miscarriage of justice as a consequence.\nInvestigations are ongoing.\nTop images from @anggy_umbara/Instagram and @creepyology/X",

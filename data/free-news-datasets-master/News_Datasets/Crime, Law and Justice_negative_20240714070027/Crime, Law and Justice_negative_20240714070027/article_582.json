    "text": "Judge Samuel Cappas revoked a Hammond man’s bond Thursday during a brief court hearing.\nJerome K. Baker, 32, is charged with neglect of a dependent resulting in catastrophic injury, a Level 1 felony; domestic battery resulting in serious bodily injury to a person less than 14 years old, a Level 3 felony; and aggravated battery, a Level 3 felony.\nHis criminal case was filed after his 8-week-old daughter turned up with a fractured leg and brain bleed on May 9 at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Illinois, charges allege.\nHammond Det. Christopher Matonovich was briefly on the stand Thursday before lawyers went to the bench to talk with Cappas privately.\nWhen they resumed, Cappas said he would grant the prosecutors’ request to pull the bond and the hearing ended.\nBaker’s next date is July 25.\nHe is also facing multiple felonies including aggravated battery for allegedly shooting an Instacart driver in July 2023 after a spat over the delivery.\nThe victim survived with a bullet lodged in his head, an affidavit states.\nmcolias@post-trib.com",

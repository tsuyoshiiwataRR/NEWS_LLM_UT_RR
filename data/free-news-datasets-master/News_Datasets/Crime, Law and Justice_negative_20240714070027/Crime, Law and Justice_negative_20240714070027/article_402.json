    "text": "(CNN) – Police in a remote town in Australia removed a problem crocodile from the community on Wednesday.\nAccording to the Northern Territory Police, the crocodile terrorized the town of Bulla recently by lunging out of the water at children and eating multiple dogs.\nAfter shooting the reptile, police said they took it into town where the locals prepared it for a traditional feast.\nPolice said the 3.63 meter-long, or 11.9 foot-long, croc moved into the Baines River near residences after floods from earlier in the year.\nA community in Australia ate the crocodile that had taken several of their pets. (Norther Territory Police) Police said a crocodile safety session was also conducted by Parks and Wildlife with children to give them an up-close look at the dangers within the waterways.\n“Crocodiles can pose a significant risk to community safety,” Commander Kylie Anderson said. “Thanks to the seamless collaboration between Parks and Wildlife, our remote police staff, and local residents we were able to safely remove the large saltie and maintain the safety of the community.”\nSpeaking about the crocodile wrangling, officials added “There’s never a dull moment in remote policing.”\nCopyright 2024 CNN Newsource.

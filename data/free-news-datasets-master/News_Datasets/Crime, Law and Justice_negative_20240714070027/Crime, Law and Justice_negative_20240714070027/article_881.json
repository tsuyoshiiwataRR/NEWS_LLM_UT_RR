    "text": "SINGAPORE: On a sleepy Wednesday evening in mid-August 2023, nine men and one woman were charged in Singapore’s State Courts with various, seemingly nondescript financial crimes: Possessing criminal benefits, forging bank statements and laundering money.\nIn the hours that followed, the story came to life via explosive headlines: The 10 suspects were part of an islandwide operation two years in the making ; all hailed from China and with a background of criminal activity, laying roots in Singapore and quietly running illegal gains through the country’s reputable financial system, to gain a veneer of legitimacy.\nMillions of dollars earned over the years from an illicit gambling ring - with Southeast Asian bases and aimed at punters in China - were turned into luxury cars, extravagant watches, properties in Singapore’s most lavish neighbourhoods, jewellery, designer goods, cryptocurrency and cold, hard cash.\nOn Monday (Jun 10), the last of the 10 offenders was sentenced to jail .\nBut there may yet be further developments involving others linked to the probe - including 17 suspects on the run, the wives or partners of the 10 and other fringe parties such as bank employees or real estate agents who failed to flag suspicious transactions.\nWho are the 10 offenders, and what did they do? Here's a breakdown.\nSu Wenqiang Cambodian national\nPleaded guilty to: 2 counts of money laundering\nSentenced to: 13 months' jail\nAdditional info: First to plead guilty, forfeited 100% of his assets (about S$6 million)\nSu Haijin Cypriot national\nPleaded guilty to: 1 count of resisting arrest, 2 counts of money laundering\nSentenced to: 14 months' jail\nAdditional info: Former director of No Signboard Holdings, hospitalised for fractures sustained in jumping off balcony. Forfeited 95% in assets (more than S$165 million)\nWang Baosen Chinese national\nPleaded guilty to: 2 counts of money laundering\nSentenced to: 13 months' jail\nAdditional info: Forfeited 100% in assets (about S$8 million)\nSu Baolin Cambodian national\nPleaded guilty to: 2 counts of money laundering, 1 count of conspiring to make false representations\nSentenced to: 14 months' jail\nAdditional info: Forfeited 90% in assets (about S$65 million)\nZhang Ruijin Chinese national\nPleaded guilty to: 2 counts of forgery, 1 count of money laundering\nSentenced to: 15 months' jail\nAdditional info: Lin Baoying's partner. Forfeited 90% in assets (about S$118 million)\nVang Shuiming Turkish national\nPleaded guilty to: 1 count of forgery, 2 counts of money laundering\nSentenced to: 13 months and 6 weeks' jail\nAdditional info: Had the highest number of total charges and assets seized, took out the most applications in his bid to get bail. Forfeited 90% in assets (about S$179 million)\nChen Qingyuan Cambodian national\nPleaded guilty to: 1 count of forgery, 2 counts of money laundering\nSentenced to: 15 months' jail\nAdditional info: Forfeited 91% in assets (about S$21.3 million)\nLin Baoying Chinese national\nPleaded guilty to: 2 counts of forgery, 1 count of money laundering\nSentenced to: 15 months' jail\nAdditional info: Forfeited 90% in assets (about S$154 million)\nWang Dehai Cypriot national\nPleaded guilty to: 1 count of money laundering\nSentenced to: 16 months' jail\nAdditional info: Had among the longest stints working for the gambling syndicate. Forfeited about 90% in assets (about S$49.2 million)\nSu Jianfeng Vanuatu national\nPleaded guilty to: 1 count of forgery, 1 count of money laundering\nSentenced to: 17 months' jail\nAdditional info: Forfeited about 95% in assets (about S$179 million)\nHow were they caught? First hints of the case surfaced in 2021, with the police receiving dribs and drabs of information on forged bank documents.\nSuspicious transaction alerts were filed by financial institutions, and the police looked into these before building up an intelligence probe.\nRelated: Billion-dollar money laundering case: Singapore police began ‘comprehensive intelligence probe’ in early 2022 The police also uncovered a web of links between the 10 offenders.\nFor example, Zhang Ruijin and Lin Baoying were lovers and friends with Su Haijin, Su Baolin and the two Sus' wives. They had gone on holiday together as a large group.\nEven if not directly linked to each other, the offenders could be traced somehow to the criminal syndicate running illegal gambling centres in Southeast Asia.\nSu Jianfeng advertised the gambling websites and managed workers who ran and maintained them, while Su Baolin started out as a gambler before being roped into operating or supervising the websites.\nWang Dehai - who was in the business for 10 years from 2012 - worked in customer service for the remote gambling enterprise before becoming a promoter. He was given a 3 per cent share in annual profits, with his total income in 2016 alone amounting to more than S$15 million.\nHe recruited his cousin and co-accused Su Wenqiang into the business.\nAfter consulting with the Attorney-General's Chambers on the strength of its evidence, Singapore police eventually launched an islandwide operation in August last year.\nOver 400 officers were involved and the 10 offenders were arrested at either condominiums, landed properties or Good Class Bungalows in areas like Sentosa Cove, Tanglin, Orchard, Holland and River Valley.",

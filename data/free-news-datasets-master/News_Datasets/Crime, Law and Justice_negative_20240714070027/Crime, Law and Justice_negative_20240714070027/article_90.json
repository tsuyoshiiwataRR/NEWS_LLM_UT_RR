    "text": "Latest Weather Blog Kidnapped girl dead; sibling found with suspect in Mississippi after mom is killed in Loranger LORANGER â€” A 3-year-old girl missing from her home in rural Tangipahoa Parish was found dead in Jackson, Mississippi, on Thursday hours after her mother's body was found dead at their residence, the sheriff's office said. Her sibling, also kidnapped from the home, was injured. Tangipahoa Parish Chief Deputy Jimmy Travis identified the suspect as Daniel Callaghan and said Callaghan had formerly dated the girls' mother, Callie Brunett, 35. Brunett's father discovered her body at her home Thursday morning. Jackson Police said it appeared Erin Brunett was killed after police had tracked him into Mississippi. \"Once he realized law enforcement knew where he was, he tried to do away with the children,\" Wade said. \"Thank God one of them survived and the grandparents are on their way to Jackson, Mississippi.\" According to investigators, Callaghan was driving Brunett's car and a license plate reader in the suburb of Byram, Mississippi, alerted law officers and the U.S. Marshals Service to his general whereabouts. Travis said someone in Jackson noticed someone pulling on door knobs at homes and went to investigate. The person ran away, and law officers later found him in a car with 6-year-old Jalie Brunett. Erin's body was 30-to-40 feet away in a wooded area. Tangipahoa officials initially said the girl was 4 years old. Jackson Police said he didn't know a cause of death. Trending News Tangipahoa Parish officials spelled the suspect's last name as Callaghan while Jackson Police spelled it Callihan. Jackson Police said he was 36 years old. Jackson Police Chief Joseph Wade said it wasn't known why Callaghan traveled to Mississippi nor whether the abduction was part of a larger plot. \"We don't know if there are other children in the woods,\" Wade said. \"If this individual has used this location as a location to traffick children and abduct children, we want to make sure we have that evidence to make sure him and whoever else is prosecuted for this heinous, heinous, terrible act.\" Callie Brunett and her daughters were last seen Tuesday night. A search began Wednesday night. \"You're talking about a 36-hour gap there that someone could have taken those children, along with her car that is missing, and you could be halfway across the country by now,\" Travis said earlier Thursday while the search was in earnest. \"We don't know if the children are in this area.\" More News Desktop NewsClick to open Continuous News in a sidebar that updates in real-time.

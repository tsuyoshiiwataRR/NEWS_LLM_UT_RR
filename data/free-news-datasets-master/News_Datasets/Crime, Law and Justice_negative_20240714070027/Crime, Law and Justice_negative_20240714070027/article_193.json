    "text": "Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter\nBy John Amato — June 13, 2024 Speaker Johnson appears to be openly rooting for a terrorist attack on US soil on Fox Business to help the convicted felon in the upcoming election.\nMike Johnson hyped an upcoming armageddon on Fox Business Network.\nWe believe there's probably terrorist cells set up around the United States now, all because Biden opened the border and refuses to close it. There's no way that anybody could possibly think that Republicans have anything to do with this.\nHow disgraceful is it for this milquetoast Christian nationalist to make wild accusations about terror cells attacking the country with no proof except for vitriol?\nYes, he's hoping beyond hope for a terrorist attack before November. But even worse than that, he knows there aren't terrorist cells, because he's briefed on all national security issues regularly as part of the Gang of 8, and if there were terrorist cells he wouldn't be speaking of them.\nI mean, we just heard one lawmaker earlier say, we're waiting for another 9-11.\nYeah, look, it's certainly possible because of the dangerous situation that we have here.\nAnd you know that they've been distributed all around the country, so all cities, all communities are potentially targets and it's a very serious situation.\nYou know, we had the Congressional baseball game last night, we had 28,000 people in that stadium here in D.C., I'm sure over 100 members of Congress there and staffs and important officials.\nYou know, I was sitting in the stadium thinking, wow, this is a dangerous situation.\nYou know, we're well protected here, but you can't possibly deter every harmful action and every plot and plan and we have made that possible because of that open border.\nThat's really distressing.\nAnd there's so many unknowns because of what you mentioned, 350 people on the terrorist watch list.\nWow.\nWhat a piece of excrement. Fear mongering is all MAGA cultfuckers have to run on. I can understand some fuckface from Newsmax saying these words, but the Speaker of the House?\n\"We believe there's probably terror cells set up around the United States now ... all communities are potentially targets\" -- it's a day that ends with y so Republicans like Mike Johnson are on right-wing TV all but rooting for a terror attack before November pic.twitter.com/lTxMyxSOxP\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) June 13, 2024\nTopics: House Speaker Mike Johnson , Terrorist Attacks",

    "text": "Chick-fil-A summer camp charging kids $35 to perform work tasks draws criticism HAMMOND, La. ( [WVUE](https://www.fox8live.com/2024/06/13/sold-out-chick-fil-a-summer-camp-charges-kids-35-work-hammond/)/Gray News) – A Chick-fil-A in Louisiana is facing backlash after announcing a summer camp that charges money to have children perform work tasks. The Chick-fil-A in Hammond is hosting a one-day camp in July that is “ideal” for kids aged 5-12 and allows them to experience various tasks performed by Chick-fil-A workers. The cost is $35 and also includes a kid’s meal, t-shirt, name tag, and a snack. The restaurant is offering six sessions of the one-day camp. [In a Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=468087002384155&set=a.225745556618302&type=3&ref=embed_post), the Chick-fil-A location shared the activities that it was offering to campers, including “learning dining room host and customer service skills, learn how to take a guest order, learn how to bag a guest order, tour the kitchen and box your own nugget and make your own Ice Dream cone or cup.” Campers will be given the opportunity to meet the Chick-fil-A mascot and get a behind-the-scenes look at what goes into the brand’s hospitality. In the Facebook post, many accused the restaurant of exploiting campers by putting them to work and charging $35 per child. Some critics even tagged the U.S. Department of Labor in their comments. However, others applauded the camp for providing skills that children could use later in life. “I’ll go against the grain here. Kudos to you, Chick-Fil-A Hammond. It’s nice to see an offer to teach young children about work ethic and responsibility, while having a little fun at the same time. I’ll ask my daughter if she’s interested in attending,” one Facebook user commented. Despite the mixed reactions, interest was strong enough to completely book all six sessions. A Chick-fil-A representative told [FOX Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/chick-fil-a-locations-summer-camp-kids-draws-criticism-sparks-debate-social-media), “It’s important to know campers are not doing the work of a Team Member. While there are Team Members who serve as camp counselors, other Team Members are continuing to work in the restaurant and ensure guests receive the delicious food and hospitality Chick-fil-A is known for.” Copyright 2024 WVUE via Gray Media Group, Inc.

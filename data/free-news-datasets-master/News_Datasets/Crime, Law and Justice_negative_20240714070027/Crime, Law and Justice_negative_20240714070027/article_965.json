    "text": "WASHINGTON—Senate investigators identified three more trips Justice Clarence Thomas took at billionaire Harlan Crow’s expense but failed to report on financial disclosure forms, fueling concerns over the Supreme Court’s sometimes haphazard compliance with ethics guidelines. The revelations make “it crystal clear that the highest court needs an enforceable code of conduct, because its members continue to choose not to meet the moment,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), who released the trip records, said Thursday. Under public and congressional pressure, the Supreme Court last year published its first ever code of conduct. But critics complained that the code has no enforcement mechanism and leaves decisions such as when to recuse themselves from a case to individual justices themselves. Crow’s attorney provided details of the trips to resolve a committee investigation into the lavish vacations and gifts the Dallas developer has given Thomas over several decades, many of which were uncovered by the news outlet ProPublica. “Despite his serious and continued concerns about the legality and necessity of the inquiry, Mr. Crow engaged in good faith negotiations with the committee from the beginning to resolve the matter. As a condition of this agreement, the Committee agreed to end its probe with respect to Mr. Crow,” the developer’s office said Thursday. Crow has said he has never discussed pending Supreme Court cases with Thomas. Thomas didn’t respond to a request for comment. Thomas previously has said he believed it was unnecessary to report trips Crow provided under an exception to disclosure requirements for personal hospitality. Last year, the Judicial Conference, the federal judiciary’s policymaking body, clarified its guidelines to specify that the exception applies to staying at a private home but that vacation expenses such as hotel bills or air travel must be reported. The records released Thursday list trips Thomas took by private jet that Crow provided to Kalispell, Mont., in May 2017; Savannah, Ga., in March 2019 and San Jose, Calif., in 2021. The purpose of the trips wasn’t recorded. In disclosure forms released last week by the federal judiciary, Thomas revealed two Crow trips he took in July 2019, to Bali, Indonesia, and to the Bohemian Grove, a private club’s redwoods retreat in California. Those trips were also on the list the Judiciary Committee released Thursday; it is not clear why Thomas disclosed them but not the other three. Senate Republicans have encouraged the justices to pay greater attention to ethics matters. But they have characterized the Democrats’ focus on the issue as an effort to discredit the court’s conservative majority. On Wednesday, Senate Republicans blocked a Supreme Court ethics bill that would have imposed an enforceable code of conduct and other requirements on the justices. “If the Supreme Court is to hold the role that our framers intended, it must do so above reproach. That is not where we are today,” Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.) said in a Wednesday floor speech backing the bill. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) disagreed. “This is not about improving the court. This is about undermining the court,” he said. Write to Jess Bravin at Jess.Bravin@wsj.com",

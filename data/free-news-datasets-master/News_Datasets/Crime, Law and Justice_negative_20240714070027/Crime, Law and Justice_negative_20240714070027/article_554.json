    "text": "Lawrence Police attempts to locate man in connection to overnight shooting LAWRENCE, Kan. (WIBW) - [Lawrence Police Department](https://lawrenceks.org/police/) is attempting to locate a man in connection to the overnight shooting on Thursday, June 13. LKPD officials shared on social media an attempt to locate post about an individual who has valuable information about the overnight shooting that led to the death of a 17-year-old. LKPD said they need help locating Cir Allen Keith Glover. Glover is 18 years old. He is 6 feet, 1 inch, and about 180 pounds. LKPD said officers were called just after 1:15 a.m. on [Thursday, June 13](https://www.wibw.com/2024/06/13/teen-shot-killed-early-tuesday-south-side-lawrence/) to 2406 Alabama in Lawrence, Kan. The initial officers found the young man with multiple gunshot wounds and began performing life-saving aid until paramedics with Lawrence-Douglas County Fire Medical arrived on scene. At that point, additional officers began securing the scene as a number of witnesses and family members began to gather. Investigations personnel were called to the scene. LDCFM paramedics transported the victim to the hospital where he later died. The 17-year-old victim was identified as Isaiah Neal. Investigators worked throughout the night and continue to track leads, however, we have made no arrests. If you know Gloverâ€™s whereabouts or have any information regarding this incident, please contact dispatch at 785-832-7509 or Crime Stoppers of Lawrence and Douglas County at 785-843-TIPS.

    "text": "A Texas National Guard soldier stands on patrol near the banks of the Rio Grande river on April 02, 2024 in El Paso, Texas. A judge has dismissed almost 60 cases against migrants accused of participating in an alleged riot at the U.S-Mexico border. A judge in Texas has dismissed almost 60 cases against migrants accused of participating in an alleged riot at the U.S-Mexico border. The migrants were facing misdemeanor riot participation charges in connection with a breach of a razor wire barrier at the border in El Paso on April 12. In an order on Monday, County Court of Law Judge Ruben Morales dismissed the cases against 59 migrants, saying he did not have jurisdiction. El Paso District Attorney Bill Hicks has said he will appeal the judge&#039;s order, which he called &quot;erroneous.&quot; More than 200 migrants overall were charged after several encounters with forces deployed to the border as part of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott&#039;s multi-billion Operation Lone Star, which has involved the rollout of a series of aggressive measures at the border to curb illegal crossings from Mexico. However, most of those cases have been dismissed. Hicks&#039; office is appealing those rulings as well. &quot;The appellate process is a very long process, but we anticipate that at some point in the future the Court of Appeals will come back and say, in fact, &#039;Judge (Ruben) Morales&#039; rulings and orders were improper,&#039;&quot; Hicks said during a news conference on Monday, via the El Paso Times. He added that if the judge &quot;believed that there was something wrong with the order transferring jurisdiction to his court, then the appropriate remedy is to simply transfer them back to whatever entity had transferred it to him, in this case the grand jury court, and say, &#039;I don&#039;t have jurisdiction.&#039;&quot; El Paso Public Defender Kelli Childress-Diaz, whose office is representing most of the migrants, said appealing the ruling is a waste of county resources. &quot;The law is clear in this regard, so it doesn&#039;t seem like this is a place to be expending limited justice system resources,&quot; Childress-Diaz said. Newsweek has contacted Hicks and Childress-Diaz for comment via email. Abbott&#039;s office has also been contacted for comment via email. The migrants were facing a maximum penalty of 180 days in jail and have already been behind bars for more than 60 days awaiting trial. Hicks&#039; office has offered plea deals with sentences of time served plus one day. But the migrants represented by Childress-Diaz&#039;s office have rejected the deals. The choice to accept or decline plea agreements &quot;belongs to my clients,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#039;m not allowed to reveal what their reasons are, but I can tell you from a perspective of a criminal practitioner, it&#039;s common for people who are not guilty to insist on pleading not guilty.&quot; Start your unlimited Newsweek trial",

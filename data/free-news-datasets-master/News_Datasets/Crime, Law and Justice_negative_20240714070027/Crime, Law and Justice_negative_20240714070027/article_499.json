    "text": "News Man arrested after allegedly pointing gun at residents One man is in custody after he allegedly pointed a gun at a group of people at an apartment over the weekend. Thursday, June 13th 2024, 12:08 PM CDT Updated: NORFOLK, Neb. — One man is in custody after he allegedly pointed a gun at a group of people at an apartment over the weekend. 38-year-old Pierre Evans was charged with possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, use of a weapon to commit a felony, and terroristic threats. According to the arrest affidavit, Norfolk Police Division had been called just after 4 a.m. to the 1700 block of Pasewalk Ave. for a fight. Officers were told one of the men causing the fight had fled the location and could not find his vehicle. Witnesses at the apartment building told police Evans and another man came to the apartment to fight and both had weapons. After one of the witnesses tried to restrain the other man since he had a weapon, Evans ran back to a vehicle and came back with a handgun. He then pointed the gun at witnesses who let the other man go. Five witnesses told police they were scared due to the hand gun and feared Evans would shoot them. Evans fled the scene on foot and the co-suspect left in a vehicle. Police were unable to find Evans that night. He was arrested on Tuesday by Stanton County Sheriff’s Office after his arrest warrant was issued on Monday. Evans is scheduled for his arraignment on June 18 at the Madison County Court. As of Thursday, no charges have been filed for the other man involved in the incident.",

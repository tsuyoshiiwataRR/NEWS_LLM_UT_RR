    "text": "UPDATE (6/13/24) — A man was charged with murder in Federal court for allegedly shooting and killing a man in north Tulsa on Saturday. FOX23 reported Rodney Hunter was arrested earlier this week in connection to the north Tulsa shooting and would be prosecuted in either Tribal or Federal court because he falls under the McGirt ruling. According to the affidavit, Hunter is charged with murder in Indian Country. UPDATE (6/10) — The Tulsa Police Department arrested Rodney Hunter in connection the shooting that left one man dead on Saturday in north Tulsa. Police say Ray Orcutt was sitting across from a garage sale loudly arguing with Hunter near Pine and Yale. Police say Hunter lives in the neighborhood and told Orcutt to leave the area and they began arguing. At some point, Orcutt turned away from Hunter who then shot him in the back. Hunter took the pistol inside his house and then began trying to aid Orcutt. Officers found the suspect aiding the victim and took over resuscitation efforts until he was transported to the hospital, police say. Orcutt was pronounced dead at the hospital. Hunter falls under the McGirt ruling and will be prosecuted in either Tribal or Federal Court. FOX23 will provide updates as they become available. TULSA, Okla. — Police are investigating a shooting in north Tulsa that left one man dead. Multiple police units and firetrucks were on scene near Pine and Yale, where a man was shot Saturday around 10:30 a.m. Police say the victim and another man got into an altercation which led to the victim being shot in the torso. Officers placed the suspect in custody and began chest compressions on the victim. The victim was taken to the hospital by EMSA where he was pronounced dead. One man in handcuffs was taken away from the scene. Lieutenant Brandon Watkins with the Tulsa Police Department Homicide Unit said police are still investigating what led up to the shooting but they don't believe the victim and suspect knew each other. \"It doesn't sound like it, it sounds like the victim was just in the neighborhood with another person who we still need to find, and an altercation started\" Watkins said. \"This sort of thing could happen anywhere, anytime.\" Here are some photos from the scene: FOX23 is following this and will update once we learn more.",

    "text": "TEHRAN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Police have killed two main members of the Jaish al-Zulm \"terrorist\" group in the southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan during security operations in the past seven days, the official news agency IRNA reported.\nThe \"terrorists,\" who sought to carry out suicide operations in Iranshahr County, were killed by the provincial police forces before being able to perpetrate any \"act of terror,\" IRNA quoted Sistan and Baluchestan's Police Commander Doostali Jalilian as saying in an address to reporters on Thursday.\nAccording to Jalilian, six \"terrorists\" have been killed by security and police forces in the province since the beginning of the current Iranian calendar year, which started on March 20.\nThe commander added that the provincial security and police forces had also arrested six members of \"terrorist\" groups involved in armed attacks on military centers in Chabahar and handed them over to judicial officials.\nJaish al-Zulm, designated as a terrorist entity by Iran, has been involved in many attacks against Iranian security forces and civilians in recent years. â– ",

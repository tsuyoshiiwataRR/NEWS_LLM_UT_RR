    "text": "Home buyers are being warned by Lloyds Bank to be vigilant over the rise of a scam which could cost them their entire deposit - with first-time buyers particularly vulnerable. Conveyancing scams have increased 29 per cent over the past year, with fraudsters hacking email accounts of home buyers to con them out of their deposit payments. Victims have an average of £47,527 stolen by scammers, analysis from Lloyds shows, but in some cases criminals have stolen more than £250,000. While conveyancing scams are far less common than other types of fraud, the bank says the average amount stolen by opportunist scammers is by far the highest - and have dubbed it Britain&#039;s &#039;costliest scam&#039;. Verification: House buyers should meet their solicitor in person in order to verify their payment details Reaching well into the tens of thousands, the average conveyancing scam dwarfs investment scams, which lose victims an average of £9,037, and romance scams which see an average of £6,340 stolen by fraudsters. Conveyancing scams begin with the email address of a home buyer or a solicitor being hacked, after which point scammers will follow emails relating to a property purchase. From there, they choose their moment to send false payment details to the buyer, that appear to be from the solicitor&#039;s email address. In some cases, this could be from the solicitor&#039;s actual address, but in most instances fraudsters will spoof an address, using the names, logos and signatures that they have already seen in the earlier email exchanges. They may even call you, impersonating the solicitor&#039;s firm. The scam has been around for years and plays on victims being in a rush - and stressed - in getting such a large sum of money over to secure their new home. Liz Ziegler, fraud prevention director at Lloyds, said: &#039;Buying a new home is one of the most exciting moments many of us will ever experience. &#039;But it can also be incredibly stressful, given the amount of money involved, and the need to navigate a complex legal process. &#039;While the financial consequences of these scams are severe, the emotional toll can be even greater. &#039;The fraud often leads to the collapse of a property transaction, with a devastating long-term impact on those involved.&#039; The bank said almost half, 45 per cent, of the victims who reported the scam were under the age of 39, meaning that scammers could be targeting first time buyers due to their lack of experience with the homebuying process. Chloe, whose name has been changed, was one such first time buyer who was scammed out of £5,000 when she tried to transfer her deposit for a £195,000 two-bed flat in Birmingham. Read More Meet the scambaiters beating fraudsters at their own game... by wasting THEIR time and money Chloe was waiting for her solicitor to send her details for transferring her deposit, so when she received an email with invoice and payment instructions a few days later, she thought little of it. While she paid the first instalment of her deposit to the fraudster, luckily for Chloe, the second £5,000 payment she tried to make was blocked by her bank, which then spoke to Chloe and told her to contact her solicitor&#039;s trusted phone number. Unfortunately, the damage was already done. &#039;Fraudsters prey on weaknesses in email security and exploit a conveyancing process that most people may only experience a handful of times in their lives,&#039; Ziegler said. &#039;It&#039;s vital that solicitors also grasp the importance of educating their clients on the risk of this type of scam and make a point of sharing payment details in person at the start of the homebuying process.&#039; THIS IS MONEY PODCAST",

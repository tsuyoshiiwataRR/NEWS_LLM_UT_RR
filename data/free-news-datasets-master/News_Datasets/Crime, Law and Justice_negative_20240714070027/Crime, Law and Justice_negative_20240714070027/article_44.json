    "text": "Criminal Justice Reboot-2: Judges, probe officers fear slowing down of criminal trials India Today spoke to trainers, investigating officers, and judicial officers to understand the steps being taken for implementing the new laws smoothly and the challenges they face in the process. Listen to Story With the [date of implementation of the new criminal laws fast approaching](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/three-new-criminal-laws-replacing-penal-code-to-come-into-effect-from-july-1-2506588-2024-02-24), confusion looms amongst investigating officers, judicial officers, and lawyers about how to implement them. Members of the legal fraternity fear that the transition from the old laws to the new might slow down proceedings and trials in future criminal cases. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023, Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita 2023, and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam 2023 were introduced by the Centre and will come into effect on July 1. India Today spoke to trainers, investigating officers, and judicial officers to understand [the steps being taken for implementing the new laws smoothly](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/news/story/ugc-directs-universities-heis-to-publicise-new-criminal-laws-2504559-2024-02-20) and the challenges they face in the process. Training courses are being conducted across trial courts in the country for judges to ensure a smooth transition from old laws to the new laws. As part of this training, all judicial academies have undertaken day-long sessions for judges at all levels, led by retired High Court judges and senior lawyers. TRAINING FOR JUDGES Retired Delhi High Court Judge and Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court, Mukta Gupta, who has given many training sessions across the country, told India Today, \"Transition from old law to new law will obviously take time, but the biggest challenge would be in continuous offences.\" Citing the example of a rape victim who alleges that the first incident took place in June and then continued in July, Justice Gupta explains, \"In these kinds of cases, both IPC and BNS will apply, which is the biggest challenge for judges.\" Justice Gupta also elaborated that from July 1, judicial officers will have to hear both IPC and BNS cases daily, as old cases will be under IPC and newly registered cases under the BNS. Supreme Court Advocate Namit Saxena, who has trained investigating officers, Magistrates, and Sessions Court Judges, told India Today, \"The transition from the old to the new law will have some basic challenges in implementation. For example, if a crime occurs on June 30, 2024, but gets reported on July 1, the new law will kick in, leading to procedural confusion.\" Advocate Saxena, who has conducted training sessions for Magistrates and Sessions Judges in Uttar Pradesh, added, \"Delay in issuing advisories to states by the Centre will only lead to a delay in the trial of criminal cases. The confusion in the implementation of new laws is increasing the burden on the judiciary.\" He also mentioned some practical questions from judges, such as, \"If a trial court convicts under CrPC on June 28 and an appeal is to be preferred, will it be done under CrPC or BNSS? These questions can be dealt with only when the new law comes in.\" Professor KA Pandey of the National Law University, Lucknow, who has also trained judicial officers in UP and Telangana, told India Today, \"A major hiccup in the transition is that we are yet to train the people who write FIRs in police stations. No training session has been scheduled for them.\" Professor Pandey highlighted queries from training sessions, such as, a provision under BNSS allows electronic complaints, but within three days, the person must sign the complaint at the police station. Police officials are unclear about maintaining the log for such cases. CONFUSION OVER ONGOING PROBES FOR POLICE OFFICERS Investigating officers trained on May 31 in Parliament stated, \"Implementation of new laws from July 1 will impact ongoing investigations. If the investigation is not completed by June 30, the sections under which the investigation was ongoing will change, delaying the filing of the chargesheet.\" One of the trainers mentioned that investigations are intentionally delayed because IOs do not want to work twice on a case. If completed before June 30, old criminal laws will be added to the chargesheet, but after July 1, new charges must be added. CHALLENGES FOR JUDGES A Sessions Court judge from Delhi, on condition of anonymity, told India Today, \"Transition from old to new laws will be challenging and time-consuming. Cases that currently take five years in trial courts will now take at least seven years.\" The judicial officer explained that under the new criminal law, if a court wants to take cognizance of the chargesheet, the accused must first be summoned and heard. This will make the process more time-consuming. ROLE OF STATES According to the new criminal laws, states are required to pass rules on the witness protection scheme and have designated places for the examination of the accused/ witness/ victim via audio-video means. A judicial officer told India Today, \"States haven't passed rules regarding designated places for audio-video recording of statements. In the absence of this, recording statements will be delayed, leading to delays in trials.\" The official added that another hurdle is how the statements will be stored to prevent tampering.",

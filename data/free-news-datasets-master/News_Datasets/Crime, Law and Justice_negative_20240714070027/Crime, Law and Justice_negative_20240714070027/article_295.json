    "text": "The Vancouver Police Department (VPD) is warning women in the Downtown Eastside to be vigilant after a sex worker was sexually assaulted. The assault occurred just after midnight on Monday, June 10, according to a police press release. The victim was picked up near East Hastings Street and Campbell Avenue by a man driving an older-model dark-coloured sedan, according to the VPD. Once the woman was inside the car, the male suspect attacked her with a weapon, states the VPD, before pushing her out of the car near Oppenheimer Park. People nearby aided the woman and called the police; she's recovering from her injuries now, note the VPD. “The suspect remains at large and his identity is unknown,” says Sgt. Steve Addison. “While we work to gather evidence that will solve this crime, we’re also sharing information with women and other sex workers so they can make informed decisions about their safety.” The suspect is described as a white male, between 40 to 50 years old and weighing around 300 lbs. At the time of the assault, he was wearing a t-shirt and sweatpants and had a receding hairline. Anyone with information about the assault is asked to call the VPD at 604-717-0601.",

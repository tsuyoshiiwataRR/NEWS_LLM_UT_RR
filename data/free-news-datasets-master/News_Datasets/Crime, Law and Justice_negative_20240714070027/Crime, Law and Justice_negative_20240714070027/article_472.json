    "text": "St Catherine police name man wanted for crimes in rural communities The St Catherine North police have expressed concern that most of the 37 murders committed in the division since the start of the year have occurred in rural areas beyond Flat Bridge, and they are seeking a man they believe is involved in several of the incidents. The wanted man has been identified as Glendon Amos, otherwise called 'Bull'. Deputy Superintendent of Police, Paul Bernard, says Amos is wanted in connection to murders in Commodore, Linstead, Banbury and surrounding areas. \"When the rural spaces have become so dangerous that people quiver in fear, it needs urgent attention,\" DSP Bernard said, pointing out that 60 per cent of murders in the division occurred in rural communities. He was speaking at the Monthly General Meeting of the St Catherine Municipal Corporation on Thursday. - Rasbert Turner Follow The Gleaner on X and Instagram @JamaicaGleaner and on Facebook @GleanerJamaica.

    "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) - Memphis Police Department has arrested and charged a woman accused of carjacking a rideshare driver. On June 12, 2024, at 4:25 a.m., officers responded to a carjacking call on Summer Avenue. Officers were informed that an Uber driver in a Ford Focus picked up a woman. The woman did not have a destination just wanted to ride and listen to music. When the driver returned the suspect on Summer Avenue, the woman forced the victim from the vehicle and drove away in the victimâ€™s Ford Focus. A similar event occurred earlier this month in which a rideshare driver was shot after suspects attempted to steal his vehicle. MPD later identified the suspect as Faith-Ann Mittons. At 1:27 p.m., officers conducted a traffic stop on the Ford Focus at I40 near Sycamore View. Mittons was the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle. She was taken into custody. Faith-Ann Mittons, 27, was charged with carjacking. Her bond is set at $75,000.00.

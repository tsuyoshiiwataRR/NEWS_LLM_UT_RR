    "text": "HARTSVILLE, S.C. (WPDE) — New details reveal the suspects of a [ deadly Hartsville park shooting Wednesday night ](https://wpde.com/news/local/one-person-shot-at-hartsville-park-byerly-park)were there for a Facebook Marketplace purchase, according to Hartsville public information officer Michelle Byers Brown. Jeremiah Josey and his brother Jarivion Scott planned to buy a motorcycle from a man via Facebook Marketplace, Byers Brown confirmed. She said the brothers met the man at Byerly Park for the exchange. Byers Brown added Josey then pulled a gun on the man selling the motorcycle and three others. She said the man who was selling the motorcycle was legally armed and felt \"his life and the lives of others were threatened.\" Byers Brown said the man drew his handgun and fired several rounds hitting Josey. The shooter and other witnesses immediately called 911 to report the incident. Hartsville Police, Darlington County Sheriff’s Office and Darlington County EMS responded. EMS transported Josey to Carolina Pines Medical Center. He was then [taken to McLeod Regional Medical Center](https://wpde.com/news/local/one-person-shot-at-hartsville-park-byerly-park) where he later succumbed to his injuries. Byers Brown said Josey was out of jail on bond and under monitored house arrest for two 2022 incidents. She said on January 11, 2022, Josey was charged with kidnapping, armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon during a violent crime by the Hartsville Police Dept. On October 3, 2022, he was charged with attempted murder, armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon during a violent crime by the Darlington County Sheriff’s Office. Josey was reportedly required to wear an ankle monitor. Joey's accomplice, Scott, left the area following the shooting, Byers Brown confirmed. Scott is charged with multiple counts of armed robbery, attempted murder, weapons violations and criminal conspiracy in Wednesday night’s incident. [Byers Brown added](https://wpde.com/news/local/hartsville-byerly-park-shooting-facebook-marketplace-sale-purchase-motorcycle-deadly-jeremiah-josey-jarivion-scott-brothers-darlington-county) Scott was out of jail on bond from a 2023 incident involving 10 charges including possession of deadly weapons, armed robbery, pointing and presenting a firearm, criminal conspiracy and drug charges. On December 8, 2023, Scott was arrested on these charges by the Hartsville Police Dept. Hartsville Police Chief Snellgrove stated: “Let me first say that my heart goes out to the family of the deceased. Losing a family member under any circumstance is a very devastating thing.” Snellgrove further stated, “This was a senseless act of violence that should have never happened. Both suspects were out on bond for violent crimes when they should have still been incarcerated while awaiting trial.” Snellgrove emphasized that this was not a random crime and that the victims were targeted and lured to the park area. This is an isolated incident and there is no reason to believe that there is any further danger to our community because of this incident,\" Chief Snellgrove said. It is relatively common for people to buy and sell items on the internet and meet people that they do not know to exchange those items. Caution should always be taken to ensure the safety of everyone, including: Scott is being held at the Darlington County Detention Center.",

    "text": "FORT HUNTER — The search for a 31-year-old man who fell into the Mohawk River near Erie Canal Lock 12 earlier in the day was suspended as darkness fell Thursday night with agencies expected to return Friday morning, according to Montgomery County Sheriff Jeffery Smith. The man’s name will not be released until after he has been located and the family has been informed, Smith said. Officials remained in contact with relatives throughout the search. “We’re staying in communication, we updated them with everything that’s taken place. We’re there for them if they need something,” Smith said. “Obviously, it’s very difficult not knowing and going through this experience. Our hearts and thoughts are with them. We are doing everything we can to ease that pain short term at least.” Multiple agencies were on scene assisting with the search throughout the day after the county 911 dispatch center received a report of a man who had fallen over the wall at Lock 12 into the river on Thursday around 11:35 a.m. The incident and multi-agency search operation in the area were first reported by [news gathering partner CBS6 Albany](https://cbs6albany.com/news/local/heavy-police-activity-at-lock-12-closes-main-street-and-bridge-drone-in-use). Smith and a patrol sergeant arrived on scene within two and a half minutes followed by additional units. They requested further resources after scouring the banks and locating witnesses. Individuals at the scene told officials the man had been fishing when his line got caught and his pole slipped from his hand. He fell into the water as he bent down trying to retrieve it, Smith said. One of the individuals attempted to throw the man a life ring provided at the site by the state Canal Corporation, but it was unsuccessful. “They attempted everything,” Smith said. There is a strong current near the lock from the river and the movable dams due to the difference in elevation, according to the sheriff. “We always encourage people, any time you're near a water edge or near the water, wear a life preserver. It's the best thing you can do. It increases your chances drastically should you fall in,” Smith said. First responders from agencies across the region assisted in the search involving divers, drones, sonar and swift water rescue resources on Thursday until around 8:30 p.m. when nightfall made it unsafe to continue. They will resume the search Friday around 7 a.m. “There were probably 50 people on scene all working diligently from different agencies,” Smith said. The area around Lock 12 was closed to vehicle and boat traffic on Thursday due to the police activities in the vicinity. Main Street in both Fort Hunter and Tribes Hill were closed to all traffic throughout the day before reopening following the suspension of the search. The Erie Canal from Lock 11 in Amsterdam to Lock 12 has been closed to navigation due to the police activities. Boaters should plan their trips accordingly, according to the Canal Corporation. Assistance at the scene was provided by personnel from state police, Fulton County Sheriff’s Office, Saratoga County Sheriff’s Office, Montgomery County Emergency Services, Fulton County Emergency Services, Swiftwater Rescue Team, state Department of Environmental Conservation, state Office of Fire Prevention and Control, Lake Valley EMS, Montgomery County Ambulance and fire departments from Fort Hunter, Tribes Hill and Florida. This is a developing story and will be updated as details becomes available. -",

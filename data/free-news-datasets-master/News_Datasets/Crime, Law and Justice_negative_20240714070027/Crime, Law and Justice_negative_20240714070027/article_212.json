    "text": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of Deep Sea Electronics DSE855 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the web-based UI. The issue results from the lack of authentication prior to allowing access to functionality. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system.\nADDITIONAL DETAILS 01/21/24 – ZDI requested a vendor PSIRT contact.\n01/22/24 – The vendor provided contact information.\n01/23/24 – ZDI reported the vulnerability to the vendor.\n02/05/24 – The vendor states the report was blocked by IT and asked ZDI to resend the report.\n02/12/24 – ZDI resent the report using an alternative method.\n02/13/24 – The vendor asked why we performed tests on their products.\n02/13/24 – ZDI provided the vendor with additional details about the ZDI program.\n02/14/24 – The vendor asked what initiated the ZDI to look at the DSE855.\n02/14/24 – ZDI emphasized our intent to responsibly disclose this vulnerability to Deep Sea for remediation. The ZDI also offered additional resources about coordinated vulnerability disclosure, as well as feedback on implementing a proper incident response process. We also reiterated our 120-day disclosure policy to ensure the vendor was aware they needed to respond with a patch within the allotted time.\n05/24/24 – ZDI informed the vendor that since we never received a response that we have assume this vulnerability remains unpatched, and that we’re publishing this case as a zero-day advisory on 06/13/24.\n-- Mitigation: Given the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the application.\nDISCLOSURE TIMELINE 2024-01-23 - Vulnerability reported to vendor 2024-06-13 - Coordinated public release of advisory 2024-07-01 - Advisory Updated CREDIT Dmitry \"InfoSecDJ\" Janushkevich of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative",

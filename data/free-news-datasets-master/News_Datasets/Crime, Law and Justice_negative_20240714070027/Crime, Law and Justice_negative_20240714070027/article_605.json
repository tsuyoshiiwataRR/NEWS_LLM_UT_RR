    "text": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (KELO) – A second former Mitchell Legion baseball player is scheduled to enter a guilty plea, according to court documents. Court records show Peyton Mandel plans to plead guilty to being an accessory to a felony and his rape charges will be dismissed. Mandel is scheduled to appear in court on Monday afternoon in Rapid City. He was one of six Post 18 players charged with rape, following an incident last year at a Rapid City hotel. According to the indictments, the two victims were 16-years-old. Prosecutors say additional players face charges in juvenile court. Mandel’s change of plea development comes just days after 19-year-old Lincoln Bates pleaded guilty to being an accessory to a felony. As part of Bates’ plea agreement, he had agreed to testify in his teammates’ cases. There are no details about Mandel’s change of plea. In April, a judge found Mitchell baseball coach Luke Norden not guilty of a felony and not reporting child abuse. A charge against Mitchell Baseball Association former board member Jeremy Borgan was also dismissed.",

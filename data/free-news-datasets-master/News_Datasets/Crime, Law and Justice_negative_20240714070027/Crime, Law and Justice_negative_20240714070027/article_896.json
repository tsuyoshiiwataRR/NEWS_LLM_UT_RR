    "text": "[LUBBOCK, Texas](https://www.everythinglubbock.com/news/local-news/lubbock-man-who-tampered-with-evidence-after-lakaria-moores-murder-pleads-guilty/) — Jermaal Riggins, 37, who was arrested in connection with the death of Lakaria Moore, 18, has pleaded guilty on Thursday to tampering with evidence and unlawful possession to a firearm. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison. EverythingLubbock.com previously reported Moore was first reported missing on May 21, 2023. Her remains were found the next day in the truck of 40-year-old Christopher Carter’s car near North County Road 3000 and East County Road 6650. Carter, Moore’s boyfriend, was later identified as a person of interest and a warrant was obtained for his arrest. When police searched Carter’s home after Moore’s disappearance, officers found ammunition, shell casings, bleach and Pine Sol, among other items. Police also found a bloody blanket and towels in a dumpster behind Carter’s home. On July 31, Carter was found at the Stadium Motel in the 4100 block of 19th Street with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The Lubbock Police Department said Riggins “altered, destroyed or concealed evidence with the intent to make it unavailable as evidence.” Along with Riggins, Tahdeejah Washington-Harris, 29, was also accused of helping Carter evade police. Washington-Harris admitted she helped Carter with hotel rooms and money while avoiding arrest. Riggins was scheduled to turn himself in on July 12 to face his prison sentence.

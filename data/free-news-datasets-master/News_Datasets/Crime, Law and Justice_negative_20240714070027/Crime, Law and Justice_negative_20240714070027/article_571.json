    "text": "One of 15-year-old boys charged in stabbing on TTC bus had concealed knife: police Published Thursday, June 13, 2024 5:22PM EDT A 15-year-old boy involved in a stabbing on a TTC bus in Etobicoke on Wednesday was allegedly carrying a knife, Toronto police say. Shortly before 6 p.m., officers responded to a call for a person with a knife on a bus near Berry and Park Lawn roads , north of the Queensway. Police said a teenage boy boarded a bus and walked to the back, where another teenager was seated. At some point, the two got into a verbal and physical confrontation, police said. One of the teenagers allegedly pulled out a concealed knife during the fight, and they both got stabbed. Officers arrived to locate one of the teenagers with a stab wound while the other tried to flee the scene but was shortly found. Police said the two boys were arrested and then taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Meanwhile, the bus operator sustained minor injuries during the incident. On Thursday, police announced that both 15-year-olds have been charged with assault with a weapon. One of them is facing additional charges of carrying a concealed weapon, possession of a weapon committing an offence and failure to comply with a release order. The accused cannot be identified under the terms of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.",

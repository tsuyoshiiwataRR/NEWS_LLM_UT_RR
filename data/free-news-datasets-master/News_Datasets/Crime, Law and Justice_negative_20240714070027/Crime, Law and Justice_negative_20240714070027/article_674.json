    "text": "Expressing concerns over alleged intimidation and threats of arrest, the Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has lodged a complaint against Governor Godwin Obaseki. The party has petitioned the Inspector-General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun; Senate Committee Chairman on Police Affairs, Abdulhamid Madori; and Chairman of the Police Service Commission, Hashimu Argungu regarding these issues.\nThis action has been taken with the state’s gubernatorial election scheduled to take place on September 21 drawing near.\nIn the petition submitted, Edo APC chairman, Jarrett Tenebe, pointed fingers at Obaseki, alleging that the governor is exploiting the state’s security apparatus to target party members. This move is seen as an attempt to weaken opposition parties and instill fear in the lead-up to the impending poll.\nThe petition included the following statement, “As the chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Edo state chapter, I wish to bring to your attention the alarming level of intimidation and harassment orchestrated by Governor Godwin Obaseki. While the Freedom of Information Act guarantees the right to question any government policies, the Governor appears uninterested in engaging with any opposition to his administration’s decisions.\n“In a bid to squash dissent, he deploys all available security resources within the state, both official and unofficial, to carry out his vengeful actions. He has openly threatened severe consequences for anyone who challenges him, especially during this critical election period.\n“In light of these events, he has mobilized the state’s police commissioner to pursue my arrest purely for political reasons. Reports from my party’s headquarters indicate that the police delivered a summons for me to meet with the police commissioner regarding a petition lodged against me by the governor in my absence.\n“I have been made aware that the Governor has instructed the police to surround my party’s headquarters where we are set to inaugurate our campaign council tomorrow, all in an effort to arrest me for political gain. I humbly request your prompt intervention by transferring any related cases to your office for a thorough investigation. I trust in the integrity of your office to address this unwarranted harassment appropriately.”",

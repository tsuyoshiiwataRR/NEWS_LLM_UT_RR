    "text": "MISHAWAKA, Ind. (WSBT) — A suspect is in custody after leading police on a high speed car chase in a stolen car. Mishawaka Police located a stolen vehicle out of Michigan driving down McKinley and they tried to pull it over. Police say, the driver sped off. Mishawaka police say officers stopped the chase and the officer turned his lights and sirens off but continued in the direction that the car was last seen. The officer then found the vehicle, which had crashed into a front yard. Police say the officer saw the suspect running toward Morris Park Country Club. The suspect was arrested there. No injuries were reported. WSBT spoke with someone who witnessed the moments before the suspect crashed. “I was picking black raspberries because this is the time of year that they’re out and while I was picking them. I heard the screech of brakes, and I thought that sounds like it was an accident, but I didn’t hear any bang you know, I didn’t hear it hit anything, so I was puzzled by that and when I came out into this field more, I saw all the vehicles,” said Robert Stockman - lives nearby. Police have not released the suspect’s name or age. Mishawaka Police say he is in jail awaiting charges.",

    "text": "Read full article The Telegraph Watch: Boozy Ed Davey swears at the Government in unearthed Covid-era video Amy Gibbons June 13, 2024 at 11:56 p.m. · 2 min read Link Copied Pub\nSir Ed Davey claimed the Government doesn’t know “where [its] a e is” while chatting to voters outside a pub in a video thought to have been filmed during the pandemic.\nIn an undated video shared on social media, the Lib Dem leader blames the “completely directionless” Government for landing Britain in a “complete mess” and promises to “try and sort it out”.\nHe appears to be slurring his words slightly and stumbles at one point. The Lib Dems said he had been for “a few pints”.\nIt is unclear when the clip was filmed, but the content suggests it may have taken place during the pandemic, or shortly afterwards, as Sir Ed mentions Covid and bumps elbows with the person filming.\nThe pub in the background, which the party confirmed was Sir Ed’s local, appears to be the Prince of Wales in Surbiton, southwest London.\nThe caption to the post reads: “Bumping into a drunk Ed Davey outside your local…”\nIn the clip, a person off-camera exclaims: “It’s Ed!” and approaches the Lib Dem leader , who greets him with a smile and an elbow bump.\nAsked: “What’s going on?” Sir Ed says: “You tell me, I don’t know, the Government doesn’t know, does it?”\nWhen it is put to him that he is meant to be “sorting everything out”, he says: “We’ll try and sort it out.”\nHe adds: “God do we need to. It’s a complete mess, isn’t it? It’s not just Covid, it’s the whole bloody lot. They seem completely directionless.”\nSir Ed has been Lib Dem leader since August 2020 and was first elected MP for Kingston and Surbiton in 1997. He was the acting leader from December 2019.\nThe 58-year-old father-of-two is hoping to topple the Tories in the Blue Wall on July 4 and regain the Lib Dems’ former status as the third largest party in Westminster , overtaking the SNP.\nHe has categorically ruled out any deal with the Conservatives but remained coy about whether he would consider a coalition with Labour to get into power.\nA Lib Dem spokesman said: “Ed went for a few pints at his local pub. He believed then that the Conservative Government didn’t know what they were doing and thinks time has proved him right.”",

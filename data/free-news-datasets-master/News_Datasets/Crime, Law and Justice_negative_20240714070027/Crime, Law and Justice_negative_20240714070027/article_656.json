    "text": "The German Consulate at the United Nations was targeted during a night of anti-Israel vandalism across Brooklyn and Manhattan, police said Friday.\nAs the homes of Brooklyn Museum director Anne Pasternak and several board members were defaced by pro-Palestinian protesters along with the Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the United Nations, three people splattered paint on the German Consulate at 871 UN Plaza.\nSurveillance video captured two women and a man walking near the scene. They fled the area in a dark colored vehicle. (NYPD) The vandals spray-painted the front of the building and plastered posters on the front door, police said.\nAccording to a social media post by Palestine Action US, the flyers read in part, “We sincerely apologize for the genocide we are committing in Gaza.”\nCops are calling the vandalism “bias criminal mischief.”\nSurveillance video captured two women and a man walking near the scene. They fled the area in a dark colored vehicle. (NYPD) While the homes of the Brooklyn Museum board members were also splattered with paint, the incident at the German Consulate hasn’t been grouped in with any other acts of vandalism from Wednesday, a police source said.\nSurveillance video captured two women and a man walking near the scene. They fled the area in a dark colored vehicle.\nNo arrests have been made.\nVandals hit the homes of the Brooklyn Museum board, who live in both Brooklyn and Manhattan, between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. Wednesday. The Palestinian mission was vandalized around 6:15 a.m.\nWorkers use a power washer and adhesive remover to strip red paint sprayed on a three-unit residential building in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn on Wednesday. (Colin Mixson for New York Daily News) The German Consulate was vandalized around 3:30 a.m., cops said. Attempts to reach diplomats there were unsuccessful Thursday.\nHundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters rallied outside the Brooklyn Museum on May 31, with some getting into the building and setting up tents. NYPD cops arrested 34 protesters during the raucous rally.\nThere has been a steady stream of demonstrations in the city and across the nation since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, sparking a ferocious war in Gaza.\nPro-Palestinian protesters vandalized the homes of Brooklyn Museum director Anne Pasternak and several Jewish board members early Wednesday. (Brad Lander; Lincoln Restler via X) On Monday, protesters rallied outside the Nova Exhibition , a memorial created to honor the victims of Hamas’ attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and took hundreds hostage.\nSome protesters waved a flag with Hamas’ emblem, as well as a sign lauding the massacre.",

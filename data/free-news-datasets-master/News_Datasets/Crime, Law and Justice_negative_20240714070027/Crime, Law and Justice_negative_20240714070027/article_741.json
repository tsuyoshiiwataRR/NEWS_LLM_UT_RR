(WCTV) - A Quincy man was found guilty Wednesday in connection to an attempted home invasion that left him and another man injured in 2022 . Court records revealed that Colin Trayele Relford was found guilty of the following five charges after a three-day trial: - Attempted first-degree murder - Attempted felony murder - Burglary involving a firearm - Petty theft involving more than $100 worth of items - Possession of a firearm by a convicted felon His conviction stems from a shooting incident that took place in Quincy in 2022. Incident Timeline The Quincy Police Department responded to a shooting on E. Franklin Street over a weekend in 2022. QPD said the victim was walking his dog around the neighborhood when he noticed a man, later identified as Relford, walking slowly. The victim made several turns, first a left turn to Duval Street, as Relford continued following him for half a block. He made another turn toward the Leaf Theater and noticed Relford was no longer behind him. When the victim arrived at his house, he turned the doorknob and it was locked. According to QPD, the victim knew something was wrong because he did not lock the door. After speaking with his wife, the victim knew someone was in their home because his wife did not lock the door either, according to court records. The victim then retrieved his firearm, QPD said. Once the victim started walking toward a room located at the back of the house, he was shot in the shoulder, according to QPD. The victim fired back and in the midst of that encountered more gunfire from Relford, court records said. The victim told his wife to call 911 and Relford fled, per court records. More on crime in our area: According to Quincy Police, Relford escaped the house with four gunshot wounds, one to the torso and his hand, and was later arrested by police. Court records said QPD was called down to Downtown Motel in Quincy, which was located about two blocks from the victim’s home, after collecting security footage from the motel. Court records indicated that the security footage revealed Relford walking up to the motel wounded and bleeding. Police were also able to locate the firearm he used, according to court records. The firearm allegedly included Relford’s DNA, according to court records, and testing also revealed the suspect’s DNA inside their home.

    "text": "ASHEVILLE, N.C. (WLOS) — A Whittier man who reportedly attempted to kidnap two individuals on the Blue Ridge Parkway last year while shooting a firearm into the air was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted on June 13, according to a news release from U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina Dena J. King and acting Blue Ridge Parkway Chief Ranger Debra A. Flowers. Along with his 10-year prison sentence, Evan William Blankenship, 23, was sentenced to three years of supervised release after pleading guilty to possession and discharge of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. MAN FACES FEDERAL CHARGES FOR ATTEMPTED KIDNAPPING ON BLUE RIDGE PARKWAY According to court documents and court proceedings, in the early morning hours of Sept. 28, 2023, two victims were sitting in a parked vehicle at Water Rock Knob Overlook off the Blue Ridge Parkway. Blankenship drove his vehicle to where the victims were located and pointed a semi-automatic pistol at them. He tried to pull one victim out of the vehicle by the hair and arm, and he threatened to harm both victims, court records say. Blankenship then reportedly struck one of the victims in the face, causing temporary hearing loss, the victim testified. Blankenship also fired his firearm into the air before pointing it again at the victims. One of the victims eventually convinced Blankenship to let them go, and the victims reported the incident to law enforcement. Shortly thereafter, one of the victims informed investigators she knew Blankenship through Snapchat and believed he had used Snapchat’s location-sharing feature to find her on the Blue Ridge Parkway. ASHEVILLE MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO ROBBERY, KIDNAPPING AND SEX OFFENSE CHARGES Blankenship was arrested on Oct. 11, 2023, and has remained in federal custody since. He will be transferred to the custody of the federal Bureau of Prisons upon designation of a federal facility. In the release, King thanked the National Park Service for its thorough investigation and the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office for its assistance with the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex M. Scott of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Asheville prosecuted the case.",

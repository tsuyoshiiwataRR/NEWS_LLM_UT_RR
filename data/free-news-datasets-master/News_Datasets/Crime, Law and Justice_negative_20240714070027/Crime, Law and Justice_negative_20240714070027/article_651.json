    "text": "William Hendon, who was tased after storming a Cincinnati [baseball](https://www.hngn.com/articles/259826/20240420/faa-probing-baseball-coach-cockpit-during-united-airlines-flight.htm) field, appeared in court Wednesday where the judge asked if he [landed that backflip](https://www.hngn.com/articles/261397/20240612/police-stun-gun-fan-who-ran-field-cincinnati-reds-game-william-hendon.htm), to which he proudly responded, 'I sure did.' Hendon was at the Cincinnati Reds vs Cleveland Guardians [game](https://www.hngn.com/articles/258797/20240325/shohei-ohtani-los-angeles-dodgers-ippei-mizuhara.htm) at Great American Ball Park on Tuesday night when he ran toward a Guardians outfielder before heading toward the infield. After several dozen feet, he came to a halt and successfully landed a backflip before a police officer caught up to him and tasered Hendon, putting a swift end to his show. The nineteen-year-old has been charged with two misdemeanor counts: criminal trespass and obstructing official business. He pleaded not guilty. The legend of Hendon (The GABP Backflipper) continues to grow.. This kids unbelievable ðŸ˜‚ [pic.twitter.com/UEi8ky5G2W]â€” Bengalorian (@thebengalorian) [June 13, 2024]",

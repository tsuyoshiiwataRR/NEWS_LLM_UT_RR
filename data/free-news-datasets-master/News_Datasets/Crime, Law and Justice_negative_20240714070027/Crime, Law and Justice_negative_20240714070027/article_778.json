    "text": "Dear reader, the introduction of Michaela Stirling is the plot twist no one expected on Netflix’ Bridgerton season 3 part 2.\nThe reveal marks a significant turn of events as the new character enters the Bridgertonverse in the final moments of the finale.\nMichaela Stirling, played by Masali Baduza , was introduced to Francesca ( Hannah Dodd ) by John Stirling (Victor Alli) at the Featherington sisters’ ball.\nWho is Michaela Stirling, you ask? Well, the new character has entered the fray as John Stirling’s cousin and already has fans speculating about what’s to come in season 4.\nVisibly in a daze, the look on Francesca’s face when introduced to Michaela leaves viewers wondering if there will be romance between the women next season. Could there be something more to Francesca’s reaction to her new in-law?\nThis is likely, considering series showrunner Jess Browning says she has “been pitching the Francesca queer story from the beginning.”\n“When I read her book, I, as a queer woman, really related to her book. Maybe in a way Julia Quinn didn’t intend, but a lot of Francesca’s book is about feeling different from her family and from the world around her and not really knowing why,” Browning told Deadline .\n“In the book, I think it’s mostly just about being introverted. But I think for a lot of queer people, not every queer person, but a lot of queer people, that sense of feeling different from the time you’re young, is part of our stories. So it felt like a natural one to gender bend.”\n(L to R) Hannah Dodd as Francesca Bridgerton and Victor Alli as John Stirling in “Bridgerton.” (LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX) In an interview with Glamour , Brownell also explains the need for queer representation on the series. “Queer audiences haven’t gotten the chance to see themselves represented in a major way on the show, which is a show that is in so many other ways so inclusive,” Browning told the publication. “I felt like there was fertile ground thematically in (Francesca’s) book to nod toward telling a queer story.“\nHowever, Browning hasn’t revealed if this storyline is coming in season 4, or if fans will have to wait for another season to see how Francesca’s love story unfolds.\nSubsequently, Netflix hasn’t revealed who the lead will be in the forthcoming season.\nIn the meantime, Bridgerton season 3 parts 1 and 2 are streaming now on Netflix.",

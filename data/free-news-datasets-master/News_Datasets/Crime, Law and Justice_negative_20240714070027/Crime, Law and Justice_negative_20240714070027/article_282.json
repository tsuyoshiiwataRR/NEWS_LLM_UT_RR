    "text": "Press Release Minnesota Man Sentenced to 10 Years in Prison for Providing Material Support to ISIS Thursday, June 13, 2024 Share Facebook X LinkedIn Email For Immediate Release Office of Public Affairs A Minnesota man was sentenced to 120 months in prison followed by 15 years of supervised release for providing material support to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), a designated foreign terrorist organization. Based on the defendant’s cooperation, the government asked the court to give the defendant credit for providing substantial assistance.\nAccording to court documents, in June 2015, Abdelhamid Al-Madioum, 27, of St. Louis Park, Minnesota, departed the United States with his family to Casablanca, Morocco, to visit extended family. Once in Morocco, Al-Madioum surreptitiously fled to Syria to join and fight for ISIS. During the following several months, Al-Madioum was administratively enrolled into ISIS, received military training from its members and assigned to a battalion. Al-Madioum served as a soldier for ISIS until late 2015 when he was injured while conducting military activities on behalf of ISIS. Following his injury, Al-Madioum continued to provide assistance to ISIS as a personnel database administrator. He remained a member of ISIS until he was captured by Syrian Democratic Forces in March of 2019.\nAssistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, U.S. Attorney Andrew M. Luger for the District of Minnesota and Executive Assistant Director Larissa L. Knapp of the FBI’s National Security Branch made the announcement.\nThe FBI investigated the case.\nTrial Attorney John Cella of the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew R. Winter for the District of Minnesota prosecuted the case.\nUpdated June 13, 2024",

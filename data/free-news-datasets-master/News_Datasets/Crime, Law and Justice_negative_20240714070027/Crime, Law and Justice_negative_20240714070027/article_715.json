    "text": "News Crime and Public Safety Crime and Public Safety | Allentown shooting sends boy to hospital By Morning Call staff PUBLISHED: June 13, 2024 at 5:46 p.m. | UPDATED: June 13, 2024 at 6:04 p.m. Allentown police are investigating a shooting that injured a boy Thursday afternoon.\nPolice responded around 3:35 p.m. to the shooting near North Nagle and Allen streets and found the boy had suffered a gunshot wound, according to Capt. Alicia Conjour. Police rendered aid at the scene, and the boy was taken to the hospital.\nThe boy’s injuries do not appear to be life threatening, Conjour said.\nAnyone who witnessed the shooting or has information about it is asked to contact the Allentown police criminal investigation division at 610-437-7721. Tips can also be left anonymously through the Allentown Police Tip411 app.\nState Rep. Josh Siegel, D-Lehigh, whose district includes the neighborhood where the shooting occurred, reacted to the shooting.\n“I’m disappointed in yet another instance of gun violence in our city and one perpetrated against a young person,” Siegel said in a statement. “I hope for a speedy recovery for the victim and peace for their family.\n“Violence is a choice, a choice made by individuals to deprive neighborhoods of security and stability,” he said. “A selfish act of destruction that injures not just the victim, but the entire community. We must do more to prevent these violent acts, our youth should spend their summers riding bikes, not recovering from gunshot wounds.”\n ",

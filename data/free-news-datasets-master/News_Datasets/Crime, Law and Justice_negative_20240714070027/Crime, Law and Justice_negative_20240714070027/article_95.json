    "text": "Authorities implement 19:00-05:00 nightly curfew and security measures in Cajibio, Colombia, until June 17 following attack. Officials have implemented a 19:00-05:00 nightly curfew in Cajibio, Cauca Department, through at least June 17. In addition to the curfew, the sale and consumption of alcohol and flying drones in the municipality will remain prohibited until June 17. Parking near police stations, banks, and other public buildings is also not permitted. The measures are in response to an attack against a police station on June 12 that was reportedly perpetrated by a dissident faction of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC); the attack did not result in any casualties. Authorities will likely deploy additional patrols and checkpoints and could enforce other movement-restrictive measures, such as road closures and additional curfews, in the impacted areas. The curfew and security response will likely disrupt overland travel and business operations. Further violence is possible. Heed the directives of local officials. Liaise with trusted contacts before conducting ground movement in the area, particularly near the shared border and in rural areas of the department. Maintain contact with your diplomatic representation. Plan for transport and business disruptions. Ensure contingency plans are regularly reviewed and updated.",

    "text": "NEW YORK, June 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Rivian Automoative, Inc.

Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased.

On this news, Rivian’s stock price fell $3.54 per share, or more than 18%, to close at $15.76 per share on March 1, 2023. Then, on February 21, 2024, Rivian issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. As part of these results, Rivian revealed that it planned to produce only 57,000 EVs in 2024, well below the 80,000 EVs expected by analysts. Rivian also revealed an adjusted EBITDA1 loss of $2.7 billion expected for 2024, versus a $2.59 billion loss expected by analysts, blaming “[e]conomic and geopolitical uncertainties and pressures, most notably the impact of historically high interest rates.” Rivian also announced it would cut 10% of salaried staff. On this news, Rivian’s stock price fell $11.45 per share, or more than 25.6%, to close at $11.52 per share on June 6, 2023.

    "text": "JONESBORO, Ark. (KAIT) - A man was arrested under a felony warrant and is charged with three counts of drugs. Jonesboro police traveled on the 400 block of Roseclair Street in attempting to locate 34-year-old Casey Long under a felony warrant for the Craighead County Sheriff’s. According to the affidavit, police arrived and found Long exiting a vehicle in the driveway, and walking towards his home. Police then approached Long and took him into custody for the felony bench warrant that was authorized by Judge Fowler on Tuesday, June 4. Police told Long that a probation search would be conducted at his home. Long said, “Probably a couple of rigs in the bathroom.” The officer went to the bathroom and found the syringes inside the pocket of a bathrobe. Two syringes contained a clear liquid. One of the syringes had water in it and the other one contained Fentanyl. Judge Fowler found probable cause and charged Long with possession of meth or cocaine LT 2 GM, possession of Fentanyl with the purpose to deliver, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Long has a bond set at $35,000 and is scheduled to appear in court on Monday, July 29. To report a typo or correction, please click here . Copyright 2024 KAIT. All rights reserved.",

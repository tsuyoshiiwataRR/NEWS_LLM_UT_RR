    "text": "News A short-term rental bill passes in Albany ALBANY, NY (WENY)--A bill headed to the Governor's desk, if signed, would ESTABLISH MORE REGULATIONS ON THE multibillion DOLLAR SHORT TERM RENTAL INDUSTRY HERE IN THE EMPIRE STATE. SHORT-TERM RENTAL OWNERS, LIKE AIRBNB HOST PATRICE GERVAIS, WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER THEIR RENTALS WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT EVERY TWO YEARS WHILE ALSO ALLOWING LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES TO COLLECT SALES AND OCCUPANCY TAXES. SOME STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY FEAR THIS WILL COMPLICATE THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES. GERVAIS SAid HE HAS SOME CONCERNS ABOUT NAVIGATING THE PROCESS BUT ultimately HOPES IF THE BILL IS SIGNED INTO LAw-- LOCAL COMMUNITIES WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE PROCESS BEFORE IT GOES INTO EFFECT. “I definitely want to be sympathetic; I understand government and the role that they play. I just want it to be well thought out and have all parties at the table,” said Gervais. SOME LAWMAKERS STRESS THIS LEGISLATION WILL NOT ONLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE STATE, BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. “It’s really precedent setting. The short-term rental bill will have national repercussions and really give us transparency on an industry that we have not had transparency on,” said Assembly Member Patricia Fahy (D-Assembly District 109).",

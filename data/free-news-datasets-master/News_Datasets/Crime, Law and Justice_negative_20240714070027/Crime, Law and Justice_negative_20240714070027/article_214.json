    "text": "International cartel smashed as 40 arrested, 8 tonnes of cocaine and €65m in assets seized\nThe criminal network, with leaders intercepted in Dubai and Turkey, organised multi-tonne cocaine shipments from South America to the EU\nEuropol have announced the take-down of an international cocaine cartel on Thursday.\nA long-run investigation led by the Spanish Civil Guard (Guardia Civil), supported by Europol, resulted in the major hit on a criminal network involved in large-scale drug trafficking from South America to the EU.\nThis final operation is the culmination of a series of actions against this network that took place over the course of three years, according to authorities.\nOn Wednesday, four arrests were made in Spain after seven properties were searched. Jewellery and luxury watches were seized as well as a firearm and ammunition, €109,000 in cash and electronic equipment.\n40 arrests- including three high value targets- were busted in Brazil, Croatia, Germany, Serbia, Spain and Turkey.\nRoughly eight tonnes of cocaine was seized in Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain.\nArmed cops seized assets amounting to €12.5 million and €3 million in Brazil, and over €50 million frozen in Serbia.\nThe internationally coordinated action is tied to a number of national and international investigations led by Belgium, Brazil, Croatia, Germany, Italy, Serbia and Turkey.\nThe sting was coordinated by Europol’s Operational Taskforce.\nThe criminal network was orchestrating multi-tonne cocaine trafficking from Colombia, Brazil and Ecuador to the EU.\nThe suspects arranged the trafficking into the EU through maritime shipments going via logistical hubs in West Africa and the Canary Islands.\nOnce the drugs had reached the EU, the suspects used handling centres in Belgium, Croatia, Germany, Italy and Spain to further distribute cocaine across Europe.\nThe leaders of the drug trafficking organisation were temporarily based in Turkey and Dubai. From there, they operated the control and command centres of the criminal network.\nIn August 2023, officers from the Spanish Civil Guard intercepted a vessel with 700 kilograms of cocaine on board near the Canary Islands.\nIntelligence analysis of historical data from the encrypted communication investigations revealed that the Croatian-Italian crew previously imported at least 500 kilograms of cocaine from Brazil to Spain via this vessel.\nThe same operational method helped investigators to identify the coordinators and brokers, originating from the Western Balkan region.\nThey were established as high value targets by the Operational Taskforce for their involvement in financing and coordinating both shipments.\nThey are also linked to a previous interception of a tonne of cocaine, seized in September 2020 in the Canary Islands.\nIn addition to the investigations carried out in Spain, the information exchange between countries, led by Europol, showed that investigations led by Belgium, Germany and Serbia targeted the same individuals and their associates.\nBrazilian authorities targeted the Brazilian criminal organisation that had been transporting cocaine inland from source countries to seaports in Brazil and other logistical hubs.\nThey would then deliver cocaine shipments to West Africa, for further shipment operations coordinated by European criminal networks.\nThe Brazilian network provided different criminal networks with a number of criminal services, including logistics, and facilitated money laundering activities.\nIn March 2024, the Brazilian authorities carried out the last phase of an investigation into the laundering of the drug trafficking profits, which revealed that almost 500 bank accounts had handled over €371 million in the years prior.",

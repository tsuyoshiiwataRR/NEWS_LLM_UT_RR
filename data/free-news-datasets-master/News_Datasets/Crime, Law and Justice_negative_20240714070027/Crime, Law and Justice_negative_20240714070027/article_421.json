    "text": "LORANGER, La. ( WVUE /Gray News) - Authorities in Louisiana are searching say one of two missing children has been found dead while the other was found alive and well.\nThe Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office reported the recovery of 4-year-old Erin Brunett’s body Thursday afternoon. Her 6-year-old sister, Jalie Brunett, was found alive and well. The suspect was arrested in Jackson, Mississippi.\nThe Louisiana State Police issued an Amber Alert for the two children after finding their mother dead early Thursday morning.\nAccording to the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office, 35-year-old Callie Brunett was missing for over 24 hours before being found found “brutally” slain in her home on North Cooper Road. Her death is being investigated as a homicide.\nHer two small children, 6-year-old Jalie and 3-year-old Erin were “unaccounted for,” Sheriff Daniel Edwards said.\nAn AMBER Alert was issued at 12:28 p.m. on Thursday for Jalie and Erin Brunett, who were unaccounted for after their mother, 35-year-old Callie Brunett, was found \"brutally murdered\" in her Loranger home. (LSP) Edwards said Brunett was reported missing Tuesday and because her car was not at her house, her family did not believe she was home. Thursday morning, her father made entry into her home and discovered her body and her children missing.\nThe manner of Brunett’s death was not disclosed, but Edwards said there was “blood everywhere.”\nCopyright 2024 WVUE via Gray Media Group, Inc.

    "text": "Blacks, Hispanics & people experiencing homelessness far more likely to be arrested by Phoenix police, report says PHOENIX (AZFamily) — The U.S. Department of Justice released its findings on Thursday of a years-long investigation into discriminatory policing and illegal policing practices involving the Phoenix Police Department. In specific, it detailed that the [department violated constitutional protections of minorities and those experiencing homelessness](https://www.azfamily.com/2024/06/13/sources-doj-release-phoenix-police-civil-rights-investigation-report-thursday/). Here’s what the data shows. Between January 2016 and March 2022, people experiencing homelessness made up more than 37% of arrests. Less than 1% of Phoenix residents are homeless. It’s no hidden secret that the [nation’s fifth largest city has experienced issues with reducing homelessness](https://www.azfamily.com/2024/05/23/new-report-shows-small-drop-phoenix-area-homelessness-2024/) in recent years. Like any major booming metropolitan area, a rapidly rising population, along with other economic factors like inflation and the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals and families have had struggles affording the cost of living. The [ City of Phoenix has established several programs since 2017 to address homelessness](https://www.phoenix.gov/phxcares). However, the DOJ says the city’s police department has failed to ensure the civil rights of those experiencing homelessness. The DOJ says Phoenix PD “stops, detains, and arrests people who are homeless without reasonable suspicion that they are engaged in criminal activity.” It also alleges that “property belonging to people who are homeless without providing adequate notice or opportunity to collect their belongings.” Black drivers are 144% more likely to be stopped for moving violations compared to White drivers. Hispanics are 40% more likely to be cited or arrested. Phoenix Police is also accused of discriminatory enforcement of traffic offenses. The Justice Department says officers often spend over 25% of their time making traffic stops and noted that although the city has a similar makeup of white and Hispanic people, the department cites or arrests Hispanics at a rate three times higher than whites. The feds say that Hispanics are 12 times more likely to be cited or arrested for improper tinting of windows, seven times more likely for license plates and lights, and more than eight times for squealing tires. While black people only make up 7.4% of the city’s population, per capita, they are three times more likely to be cited or arrested for traffic-equipment offenses, four times for license plate lights, and three times as often for improper window tinting. Alcohol laws are disproportionally enforced against Native Americans Arizona is well known for having one of the [strictest drunk driving laws in the nation](https://www.azfamily.com/2024/05/24/law-enforcement-agencies-prepare-crack-down-duis-memorial-day-weekend/). As a zero-tolerance state, an officer has the discretion to cite or arrest someone for a DUI even if they are below the legal limit, which is 0.08 in Arizona. Even with those laws in place, a report released by the [U.S. Department of Transportation](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813435) ranked [Arizona at No. 8 for most DUI-linked deaths in the state](https://www.azfamily.com/2023/04/29/arizona-is-among-highest-nation-drunken-driving-deaths/). 716 people were killed by drunk drivers on our roadways between 2020 and 2021, the report said. Other studies have shown similar statistics. However, the Department of Justice noted “stark disparities” in how those laws were enforced on the Native American population, with those being 44 times more likely to be cited or arrested for possessing or consuming alcohol. “Officers were 27% more likely to release white people in 30 minutes or less, while they detained Native American people accused of the same conduct for longer than 30 minutes,” the report said. Black men were overwhelmingly cited or arrested for marijuana possession in Phoenix A 2020 report by the American Civil Liberties Union says that Black people “are [3.64 times more likely](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/new-aclu-report-despite-marijuana-legalization-black-people-still-almost-four-times) than white people to be arrested for marijuana possession.” In Phoenix, the DOJ says, the number is nearly double that. On the other hand, Hispanics are three times more likely to be cited or arrested. But it’s not only the rate at which citations occur, but how those same people appear to be treated based on race or nationality. “Officers were 11% more likely to take no action against white people for low-level drug offenses, while officers cited or arrested Black people stopped for the very same crimes,” federal officials claimed. When it comes to drug-related offenses as a whole, the feds say officers were 27% more likely to release white people within 30 minutes or less. See a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

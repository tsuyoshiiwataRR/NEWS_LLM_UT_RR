    "text": "by: Johan Sheridan\nPosted: Jun 13, 2024 / 04:18 PM EDT\nUpdated: Jun 13, 2024 / 04:18 PM EDT\nby: Johan Sheridan\nPosted: Jun 13, 2024 / 04:18 PM EDT\nUpdated: Jun 13, 2024 / 04:18 PM EDT\nSHARE\nALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo returned to the public eye this week, testifying before Congress about the aftermath of his executive order sending COVID patients to nursing homes on Tuesday. That same day, Cuomo’s team sued the Office of the New York State Comptroller and Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli for refusing to reimburse all of his legal fees.\nAlso this week, a federal judge decided to honor the “sovereign immunity” argument from the Office of the New York Attorney General (OAG), which refused to grant universal access to the investigation into the former governor to Cuomo’s legal team. These connected lawsuits and testimonies represent the latest in the former governor’s crusade to clear his name once the crisis crumbled his administration.\nKnowing he was the subject of investigations into a double scandal taking shape—COVID at nursing homes and misconduct accusations—then-Gov. Cuomo required that both his defense and the legal experts investigating him come from third-party legal firms. Damning reports came from the nonbiased fact-finding excursion to ultimately legitimize Cuomo’s status today as political persona non grata.\nNew York gets $44 million from Johnson & Johnson for baby powder “The State Assembly yesterday outlined weeks of process that will then lead to months of litigation, time and money that government should spend managing Covid, guarding against the Delta variant, reopening upstate, fighting gun violence and saving New York City. All that time would be wasted,” the governor said when he resigned in the days after the misconduct report was released. “Wasting energy on distractions is the last thing that state government should be doing. And I cannot be the cause of that.”\nAfter the fall, the former governor kicked off several legal actions against the state in an apparent effort to clear his name, with New York State footing the bill for both sides of the litigation. Accusers also filed federal lawsuits against him. The different venues—state and federal—mean different sets of rules for related parts of these disparate court proceedings.\nCannabis board overhaul rolling out as home growing rules take shape According to the Comptroller’s Office, “From January 1, 2020 to date, the state has spent nearly $11.5 million for defense costs for former Governor Cuomo and former executive chamber officials under Public Officers Law section 17 in the matters of Trooper 1 v NYSP et al. and Bennett v Cuomo et al . Of this amount, nearly $6.8 million has been paid to Glavin PLLC and Sher Tremonte LLP for representation of former Governor Cuomo,” said a spokesperson from the Comptroller’s Office. “Additional monies have been expended by the state for legal representation related to the sexual harassment investigation, COVID-19 response, and impeachment proceedings, etc. under budget appropriations (eg, L.2023 c.50) and legal services contracts.”\nIn 2023, Cuomo’s legal team subpoenaed—and ultimately filed a Freedom of Informational Law request with—the OAG for access to the evidence gathered for the misconduct report. OAG challenged the subpoena on the grounds of “sovereign immunity,” which protects the agency from being sued by a New Yorker in federal court for refusing to divulge confidential information about witnesses.\nNew York mulls sunsetting regents requirements U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Cave eventually agreed, affirming as well that the third-party law firm that investigated Cuomo could not be legally compelled to produce the documents at issue. Take a look at that decision here or at the bottom of this story.\n“We respectfully disagree with this decision which will establish a terrible precedent allowing state agencies like the Attorney General’s Office to pick and choose willy nilly when or when not to turn over documents in federal cases. We are reviewing our options to appeal,” said Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi.\nConsumer alert: Scams targeting older New Yorkers now more common, successful, and expensive When Cuomo’s camp asked the Comptroller’s Office to reimburse the legal fees related to the FOIL request, the agency refused. Because Cuomo directed his motions at a state agency in a federal case, the jurisdiction created an issue, the agency argued.\nIn an email—you can take a look at it here , or at the bottom of this story—to Cuomo attorney Rita Glavin, a lawyer for the agency said, “An affirmative action brought in a different jurisdiction against a non-party arising under an unrelated state statute is not lawfully part of the “defense” of a federal action as contemplated by Public Officers Law § 17.”\nNew York State issues standing order for doulas, Hochul adds 20 hours of prenatal sick time That’s why Cuomo sued.

The announcement comes with a call for design and architecture consultation to create a trauma-informed, normative facility that incorporates centralized services and extensive program space.\nCommissioner Victoria L. Kuhn, Esq. emphasized the importance of this development, stating that the new facility will meet the modern needs of safety, security, and rehabilitation. The initiative follows Governor Phil Murphy’s 2021 announcement to close the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility and relocate its population to a more central and accessible location, which is projected to save the state approximately $166 million in deferred maintenance and future capital costs.\nAssistant Commissioner Helena Tomé highlighted the benefits expected from the new facility, which will foster a rehabilitative and dignified environment conducive to the reintegration of incarcerated women into the community. The facility’s strategic placement on a 33-acre site near major roadways and other correctional institutions aims to enhance family visits, staffing, and access to community resources.\nThe new correctional facility will share a location with the active Garden State Correctional Facility and is near the recently closed Albert C. Wagner Youth Correctional Facility. It is part of a broader state effort involving multiple agencies, including the Departments of Treasury, Environmental Protection, and Community Affairs.\nThe NJDOC’s commitment to improving conditions for incarcerated women has been supported by stakeholders like Bonnie Kerness, Program Director of the American Friends Service Committee Prison Watch, who expressed optimism about the positive impact of the new facility on the dignity and rehabilitation of its residents.

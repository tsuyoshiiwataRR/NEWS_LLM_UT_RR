    "text": "The Office for Air Accident ⁣Analysis, a branch of the Dutch transport inspectorate,‍ is concerned about the ⁣increase in false information transmitted‌ to pilots following the manipulation of GPS systems. This administration‍ recorded 983 cases of “ GPS spoofing ” in the first ten ​months of 2024, 163 in 2023 and almost none in‌ 2022. Enough to jeopardize flight safety, with the receipt of incorrect ​data and incorrect alerts on the location of their device.\nDutch experts do not say where ⁤the accidents occur, but according to data collected on November ⁣20 by the newspaper Fidelity According to the Association of Professional Pilots (VNV), the most frequent accidents occur in⁢ the Balkans, Turkey⁤ and the Middle East. They would also multiply in ⁤Pakistan,‌ North and South Korea, ‍as well as in the United States. Finnish authorities, for their part, suspect that Russia often emits false signals to protect its strategic installations from drone or aircraft​ attacks.\nOther states and rebel groups also disrupt satellites with GPS signals that hijack the correct intelligence they transmit to planes. These actions, mainly intended to deceive military aircraft, nevertheless endanger civil aviation. The various on-board systems provide the crew with false data that can falsely alert ⁤them or, conversely, deprive them of essential information.\n“In the fog” “It⁢ has become a daily problem, it’s like flying in the fog” explained in ‌ Fidelity Coen George, ⁢vice president of the ⁣VNV. Since the beginning of the year, Dutch services have collected 362 cases of manipulated data⁢ telling pilots that their plane was approaching the ground when‍ in reality they were flying at‍ high altitude.\nRead also | Article reserved for our subscribers ​ Air traffic was⁤ disrupted by a global computer ​outage, many flights cancelled Read later\nThese disruptions had no‌ consequences, but their multiplication could lead crews to neglect real warnings or relevant ‌information, judges the VNV. The opportunity is taken to require the maintenance of two pilots on board⁤ each aircraft, while companies and manufacturers support the introduction ‌of co-pilotless flights in the future. The European Cockpit Association,‍ which brings together 40,000 pilots on the continent,‍ is fighting against this⁣ project currently being examined by​ the European ⁤Union Agency for Air Navigation.\nWhat are the implications ⁣of GPS ​spoofing for aviation safety ? Interview between Time.news Editor and‍ GPS‍ Manipulation Expert\nEditor : Good ⁣day, and thank you⁤ for joining us to ⁤discuss a critical issue impacting aviation safety​ today. With us ‌is Dr. Alex Rehn, an expert in aviation security and GPS technology. Dr. Rehn, the recent report from the Office for Air Accident Analysis highlights ‍a staggering ‍increase in cases of GPS spoofing. Can you break down what this means for pilots‌ and ⁢airlines?\nDr. Rehn : Absolutely, and thank you for having⁣ me. ​GPS spoofing essentially involves sending false signals to an aircraft’s GPS system, leading pilots⁢ to receive⁢ incorrect data about their location and route.⁣ This manipulation can‌ result in misleading alerts and situational awareness, jeopardizing flight safety significantly.\nEditor : ⁣That’s alarming, to⁢ say the least. The record shows ​983 instances of GPS​ spoofing within just the first ten months of 2024, compared to only ​163 in 2023 ‌and ‌almost none in 2022. What factors ⁣do you think have contributed ‍to this dramatic rise?\nDr.​ Rehn : Several factors could be at play here. One is the increasing accessibility​ of technology that ‍enables spoofing. With more actors—states, rebel groups, and individuals—gaining ⁢technical capabilities, we see a rise in both frequency and geographical reach of these incidents. Moreover, many⁢ of these spoofing events seem particularly concentrated in regions with ‍geopolitical tensions, such as ​the Balkans, Turkey, and, notably, the Middle East.\nEditor : Interesting. ⁢The report also ​mentions⁤ that Finnish ‍authorities suspect Russia of emitting false signals to ‌protect strategic installations. How common is it for military tactics to spill over into civilian aviation?\nDr. Rehn : Unfortunately, it’s becoming more common.​ Military ‌groups have traditionally ‌disrupted GPS signals to mislead enemy aircraft or drones. However, the challenges arise⁢ when such tactics endanger civilian flights inadvertently. ​The indiscriminate nature of GPS spoofing⁤ means that while the ⁤intention may be to deceive‍ military targets, civil aviation is collateral damage—exposing not just aircraft but also lives to significant risk.\nEditor : It’s sobering to think about the potential ⁣consequences. How do on-board systems ⁤currently cope with these spoofing attempts, and what improvements might we see in the future?\nDr. Rehn : Current systems use a combination of ‌satellite signals and inertial navigation systems to determine an aircraft’s position, but they are not immune to⁢ sophisticated spoofing techniques. Going forward, we need to develop more⁤ resilient navigation systems that can⁣ authenticate signals and detect anomalies ‍in real-time. Additionally, better training for pilots ⁣on how to respond to ⁢discrepancies in GPS information is crucial.\nEditor : That⁤ sounds‌ vital. As a concluding thought, what advice would you give ​to airline companies and piloting organizations in addressing the immediate risks of ⁣GPS spoofing?\nDr. Rehn : First, they should advocate for enhanced security measures, including advanced technology that ⁣can counteract spoofing ⁣attempts. Second, integrating strict protocols for situational awareness can ​help pilots distinguish between genuine and false‌ information. Lastly, fostering collaboration‍ with international aviation authorities is essential to develop a unified⁣ response to this growing threat.\nEditor : Thank you, Dr. Rehn, for shedding ⁤light on such a ‍significant and ​pressing issue in aviation safety. We hope for advancements ⁢that can protect our skies and the people who travel in them.",

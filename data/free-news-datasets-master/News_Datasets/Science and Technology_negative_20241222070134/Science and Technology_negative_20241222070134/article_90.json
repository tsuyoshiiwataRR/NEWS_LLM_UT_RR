    "text": "Pretty much every “non-popular” repo on github (repo with < 20 stars) is no longer accessible via code-search. Public SourceGraph code search does not find my public github repo anymore - #3 by user_56942_25821 is a related issue, but this was solved by the devs manually adding to the index rather than fixing for all repos.\nIs this a new systematic change, that we can only search popular repos? Do I need to upgrade to a pro plan in order to search all repos?\nI have same problem.\nHey @user_56942_25821\nYes we cleaned up our index and some repos that should have stayed got removed. If you have a list of repos you want re-added LMK and I can do that. cc @gscholer\nHi! I’ve noticed that this problem is still present: I cannot list repositories that have less than 30 stars when using the public search endpoint (Sourcegraph), not even newly created repoes. Is this a default in sourcegraph?\nHi @ettodei can you please list some of the repos you aren’t seeing?\n@jdorfman I cannot see GitHub - collective/collective.searchandreplace\nHey @gotcha\nShould be good to go: collective/collective.searchandreplace - Sourcegraph\nI also added the GitHub org (collective) to the whitelist so all repos should sync soon.",

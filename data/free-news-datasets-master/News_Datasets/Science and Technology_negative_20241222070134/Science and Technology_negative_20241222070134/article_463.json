    "text": "Reddit has resolved a problem with its website, the social media company said on Thursday after the outage impacted thousands of users for about an hour.\nThe social media platform was down for thousands of users, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com, a day after Reddit said it had fixed a software bug.\n“We have fixed the problem and have returned to normal operation,” Reddit said on its status page on Thursday.\nThe outage began around 10 a.m. ET and at its peak impacted more than 70,000 users in the United States, according to Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from several sources including users.\nReddit’s status page confirmed the issue with its website at 10:51 a.m. ET. The social media company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe company said on Wednesday it had rolled out a fix for a software bug that prevented tens of thousands of people from accessing the social media platform.\nCo-founded by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian in 2005, Reddit is a platform where users share links and participate in discussions within interest-based communities called subreddits.

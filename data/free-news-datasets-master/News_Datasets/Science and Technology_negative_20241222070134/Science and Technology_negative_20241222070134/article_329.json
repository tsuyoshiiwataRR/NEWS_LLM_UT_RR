    "text": "Google scraps Pixel Tablet 2, may exit tablet market: Report\n[Akash Pandey](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/author/akash/271)\n[Google](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/science/google) has stopped working on its second-generation Pixel Tablet, as per Android Authority.\nThe move suggests the tech giant might be looking to exit the tablet market for the second time in just over five years.\nThe first Pixel Tablet, which debuted last year, could be the company's only foray into this product category.\nThis is a letdown for Pixel fans hoping for a revamped Pixel Tablet with an upgraded chipset, improved camera, and, most importantly, an official keyboard accessory.\nSpeculations suggest poor sales behind Google's decision\nThe rumored discontinuation of the Pixel Tablet 2 indicates that its predecessor may not have sold well. This could be a possible reason for Google to stop further investment in this product line. Just last week, rumors about new features and a keyboard accessory for the now-scrapped tablet model had surfaced.\nGoogle's Nest division could shift focus\nThere's speculation that Google's Nest division may take over the company's large-screen product ambitions.\nThe focus could shift toward evolving devices like the Nest Hub and Hub Max, instead of standalone tablets.\nThe potential move comes as Google has struggled to make a significant impact in the tablet market, especially against strong competitors like [Apple iPad](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/science/apple-ipad).\nPrevious attempts and challenges in tablet market\nGoogle's journey in the tablet market has been far from smooth.\nDespite a promising start with the Nexus 7, the company has failed to match Apple's iPad in terms of sales and mainstream success.\nOne of these challenges is that [Android](https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/science/android) is way behind iPadOS when it comes to third-party apps optimized for tablets.\nThis has further hindered Google's efforts to establish a stronghold in this space.\nExit and re-entry into tablet market\nIn 2019, Google declared it was done with tablets after its Pixel Slate was met with overwhelmingly negative reviews. Two tablets still in the works were scrapped back then. However, by 2022, the company reversed its decision and announced its Pixel hardware team was working on a new tablet. This device eventually launched as the $499 Pixel Tablet.",

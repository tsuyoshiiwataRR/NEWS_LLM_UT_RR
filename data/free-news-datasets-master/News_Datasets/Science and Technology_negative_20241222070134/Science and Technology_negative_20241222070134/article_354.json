    "text": "China is running out of time to meet its ambitious goal for space launches in 2024, with nearly half of the planned missions yet to take place.\\nThe country’s space authorities had set a target of 100 launches this year but only 56 of those had been completed by mid-November, according to data from space activity trackers in and outside China.\\nIn contrast, Texas-based SpaceX had already reached its 100th Falcon 9 flight of the year by October, a historic milestone for the company’s workhorse reusable rocket.\\nJonathan McDowell, an astronomer and space historian at Harvard University, said rocket reusability – particularly the repeated use of Falcon 9’s first stages – was a major factor in the United States’ lead over China in space launches.\\nA Beijing-based rocket engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed little surprise at China falling short of its target. “It was never possible to complete that many [launches] in the first place,” he said.\\nThe engineer previously worked for a state-owned space launch vehicle manufacturer and is now part of team developing a reusable rocket at a major space company.\\nHe said China’s commercial space sector was struggling with insufficient funding, a shortage of talent and limited government support.\\n“Given the launch accident earlier this year, many of us expect the approval process for subsequent launches to become even stricter,” he added.\\nIn June, a test rocket developed by Space Pioneer unexpectedly launched, crashed and exploded during a static-fire test on the outskirts of Gongyi county, Henan province, in central China.\\nAlthough no casualties were reported, the incident was widely regarded as a significant safety failure within China’s space industry, potentially leading to stricter regulations for the private sector.\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, China’s space launches remain heavily dominated by state-owned rocket developers. Of the 100 targeted launches for this year, about 30 were planned as commercial missions, with the remainder relying on state-owned Long March rockets.\\nIt is unclear which Long March launches have been postponed or cancelled this year, as China typically provides only an overview of planned activities rather than detailed launch schedules.\\nWith up to 15 more missions anticipated before the end of December, the country still has a chance to break its record of 67 launch attempts in a single calendar year, set in 2023.\\nThe coming missions include the debut flight of the Long March-12, a medium-lift launch vehicle capable of delivering 10 tonnes to low-Earth orbit and 6 tonnes to a 700km sun-synchronous orbit. The launch will take place from a new commercial launch pad at the Wenchang space port on Hainan Island in southern China.\\nPrivate rocket launch attempts are also planned by start-ups including Galactic Energy, CAS Space and Orienspace, as well as LandSpace, whose Zhuque-2 became the world’s first methane-liquid oxygen rocket to reach orbit in 2023.\\n",

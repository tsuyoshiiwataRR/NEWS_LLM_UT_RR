    "text": "Sir David Attenborough’s AI voice clone – level 2\n22-11-2024 15:00\nSir David Attenborough is upset about AI copying his voice. The BBC showed him clips where AI imitated his voice, and he strongly disliked it.\nDr. Jennifer Williams, an AI expert, explained how AI technologies clone voices. They often gather audio from the internet and create a model. Some people use it for fun, but others use it to spread fake news, which is harmful.\nSir David’s voice is trusted worldwide, so misusing it can confuse people. Dr. Williams said that we need strict rules to stop this kind of misuse. She also advised people to check if a voice is real by investigating its source and context. AI is growing quickly, and protecting voices like Sir David’s is becoming more important.\nDifficult words: [imitate](https://www.newsinlevels.com/?s=imitate) (to copy), [misuse](https://www.newsinlevels.com/?s=misuse) (to use something in the wrong way), [confuse](https://www.newsinlevels.com/?s=confuse) (to make someone feel unclear or uncertain).\nYou can watch the original video in the Level 3 section.\nWhat advice did Dr. Jennifer Williams give to people in order to determine if a voice is real or not, and why is it important to protect voices like Sir David Attenborough's according to her?\nLEARN 3000 WORDS with NEWS IN LEVELS\nNews in Levels is designed to teach you 3000 words in English.

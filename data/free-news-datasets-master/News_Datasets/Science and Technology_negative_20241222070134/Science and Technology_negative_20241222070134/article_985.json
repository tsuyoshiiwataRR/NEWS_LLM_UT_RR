The incident has sparked fears of identity theft and fraud among users.\n\\nThe breach compromised sensitive customer information, including names, email addresses, and phone numbers, raising concerns about potential misuse by malicious actors.\n\\n We deeply regret the inconvenience caused to our valued customers and are taking immediate steps to address the issue.\n\\nThe 1 Co, known for its widespread loyalty programs across Thailand, has initiated a thorough investigation and collaborated with cybersecurity experts to determine the full scope of the breach.

Stronger safeguards are imperative to protect user data.\n\\nWhile this is not the first time a major organization has suffered a data breach, the scale and sensitivity of the information exposed have left customers outraged. The incident adds to growing calls for stringent data protection laws in Thailand and greater accountability for companies handling large-scale customer data.\n\\n",

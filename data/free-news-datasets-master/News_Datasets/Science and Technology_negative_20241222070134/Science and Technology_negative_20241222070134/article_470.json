    "text": "Has Google canceled plans to develop 'Pixel Tablet 2'?\nIt has now emerged that plans for the Pixel Tablet 2 , a successor to Google's original Android tablet device the Pixel Tablet, which was rumored to be in development for a 2025 release, have been scrapped.\nGoogle Pixel Tablet 3 could still be happening, after all - Android Authority\n[https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-tablet-2-canceled-3502094/](https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-tablet-2-canceled-3502094/)\nThe Pixel Tablet 2 may be canceled, but we'll somehow still get a Pixel Tablet 3\n[https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-tablet-2-cancelled-pixel-tablet-3-uncertain/](https://www.androidpolice.com/pixel-tablet-2-cancelled-pixel-tablet-3-uncertain/)\nAndroid news sites Anroid Authority and Android Police reported that they had received information from sources familiar with the matter that 'Google has canceled plans to develop the Pixel Tablet 2.'\nThe Pixel Tablet was released in June 2023 as a genuine Google Android tablet device. It is the first tablet device from Google in five years since the Pixel Slate was released in 2018.\n[Photo review of the Google genuine Android tablet 'Google Pixel Tablet' with a speaker attached - GIGAZINE](https://gigazine.net/news/20230620-google-pixel-tablet-unboxing/)\nAfter the release of the Pixel Tablet, rumors that a successor to the Pixel Tablet 2 was being developed were circulating, but reliable information has emerged that the plan for the device codenamed 'Kiyomi' has been canceled. Initially, it was thought that the codename 'Kiyomi' was a device equivalent to the Pixel Tablet 3, and news sites such as Android Headlines actually reported that 'development of the Pixel Tablet 3 has been canceled,' but upon closer investigation, it was discovered that 'Kiyomi' refers to the Pixel Tablet 2.\nExclusive: Google Cancels Pixel Tablet 3 Development\n[https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-cancels-pixel-tablet-3-development](https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-cancels-pixel-tablet-3-development)\nThe Pixel Tablet 2 was rumored to be equipped with the same Tensor G4 chip as the Pixel 9 series and was scheduled to be released in 2025. Meanwhile, according to the leaked roadmap, the Pixel Tablet 3 will be equipped with the Tensor G6 chip and is scheduled to be released in 2027.\nIf the 'Pixel Tablet 2 development has been cancelled' is true, it is unclear whether Google has given up on developing tablet devices in the first place, or whether the device listed on the roadmap as the Pixel Tablet 3 is planned to be released in some form. Google has not yet made any comment on the matter.\nRelated Posts:\nin [Hardware](/gsc_news/en/C6/), Posted by logc_nt",

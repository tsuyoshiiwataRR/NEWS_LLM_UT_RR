    "text": "Bugcrowd’s annual “Inside the Mind of a Hacker” 2024 report indicates a notable change in how bad actors view the value of AI in hacking, with 77% now using AI solutions in their endeavours, a 13% rise from 2023 .\nBugcrowd , a crowdsourced cybersecurity platform, analysed responses from 1,300 ethical hackers and security researchers on the Bugcrowd platform. Providing a detailed overview of the hacking community, the report reveals that 82% feel advancements in AI-driven threats are happening so quickly that it is becoming almost impossible for current security measures to keep pace. This is leading to heightened security risks and the findings create a call for AI-enhanced defences.\nAI adoption continues to increase in the hacking community, posing both risks and benefits. Bugcrowd’s report details a dramatic increase in how hackers perceive the importance of AI in their activities. In 2023, only 21% of hackers believed AI technologies had the power to enhance the value of hacking, but this rose to 71% in 2024.\nThe figurs suggest increased use of AI tools for hacking purposes, likely driven by the continuing advancements in AI technology. Increased implementation makes such tools more accessible and practical for hacking purposes.\nREAD NEXT Site that handles intimate personal data gets hacked; customers shocked and upset Moreover, 93% of hackers agree that companies using AI tools have created a new attack vector, reflecting the growing opportunities for hacking exploitation as AI evolves.\nHardware hacking is one area that has become more prominent, according to the report. Over the last year, 81% of hardware hackers encountered vulnerabilities not seen before, while 64% believe there are greater numbers of vulnerabilities than in 2023.\n83% of hardware hackers stated they are confident in hacking AI-powered hardware and software, suggesting AI systems that were once seen as secure have now become targets.\nMichael Skelton, VP of Security Operations at Bugcrowd, said the rise in hardware hacking is a result of “inexpensive, vulnerable smart devices,” and the “exploitation of vulnerabilities in the physical components of electronic devices” is no longer a niche area of expertise.\nWhile the use and value of AI technology has increased in hacking, the report acknowledges that hackers recognise limitations with AI. Just 30% of those surveyed think AI can replicate human activity and creativity, while only 22% believe AI can outperform humans, similar to the 2023 results.\nAccording to Dave Gerry, CEO of Bugcrowd, AI is a key component in the hacking community. “There is no denying that AI remains a strong force in the hacking community, changing the very strategies hackers are using to find and report vulnerabilities.” Berry emphasised the importance of Bugcrowd’s report, claiming, “these insights can help businesses understand the unique value this community brings to fighting against today’s AI-driven cyberattacks.”\nREAD NEXT Microsoft Windows kernel exposed to OS downgrade exploit The key takeaway from the “Inside the Mind of a Hacker” 2024 report is the importance of organisations involving hackers, particularly ethical hackers or security researchers, to help defend against evolving cyber threats. Although AI introduces new attack risks, 73% of hackers surveyed report confidence in uncovering such vulnerabilities. Ultimately, relying solely on security tools may not be enough, so human creativity and expertise is still needed to stay ahead of potential threats.\nHacking is often seen as a solo, mercenary act, but Bugcrowd’s report highlights its potential as a viable and successful career path as so-called ‘white-hat’ hackers, particularly younger people aged between 18 and 34 (88% of respondents fell into this age category). 67% reported that they hack full-time or are attempting to make it a full-time career.\nOf those surveyed, 87% learned their skills via online resources, 78% through self-study, and 43% through experimentation. 73%, however, reported having a college degree or higher, but only 29% say they acquired their hacking skills through academia.\nThe increasing use of AI tools reflects the community’s adaptation to increasingly evolving cyber risks, possibly tied in with the younger demographic’s comfort with technology and that age group’s drive to stay ahead of emerging threats.",

    "text": "Star Wars Outlaws has launched on Steam, just shy of three months since its initial release – but you’d be forgiven for having not noticed it. Despite a gorgeous open world and the promise of a new tale starring bounty hunter Kay Vess, the RPG has fallen short of Ubisoft’s sales expectations, and a re-release on Valve’s store doesn’t seem to have helped. Since its launch yesterday, Thursday November 21, Star Wars Outlaws has failed to break the 1,000 concurrent player mark on Steam, although reviews remain upbeat so far.\nAs someone who likes stories that take a step away from the Jedi, Star Wars Outlaws should be right up my street. Yet so far it has fallen short of Ubisoft’s best open-world games . In our Star Wars Outlaws review , Paul bemoans its “uninteresting open world and tedious stealth sections” that drag down “what could have been the start of something special.” First launched on Friday August 30, it’s now finally available via Steam, but it’s yet to break big.\nSo far, the Star Wars Outlaws Steam player count has reached a concurrent high of just 834 players. There are certainly some additional factors that could be at play here – it arrived on a Thursday, for example meaning we may see a climb over the weekend. The Steam edition of Assassin’s Creed Mirage, for example, started slowly but gradually climbed to a high of 7,870.\nOutlaws has also previously been available on other PC storefronts, which could mean that interested players have already picked it up elsewhere. However, many other games that have followed this model haven’t been so dramatically impacted – sandbox hit Satisfactory drew more than 27,000 players when it arrived on Steam in early access more than a year after it had first launched on the Epic Games Store.\nThere’s still some hope that we could see a rise – particularly if the response to Star Wars Outlaws update 1.4 , which overhauls combat with changes to both shooting and cover mechanics, ends up being positive. Currently, Steam reviews sit at a ‘mostly positive’ 70%. Nevertheless, this probably isn’t the major splash Ubisoft was hoping for. Whether it’s Star Wars fatigue or an overdose of open-world action, people don’t seem eager yet.\nStar Wars Outlaws is out now on Steam, with a 25% launch discount until Thursday December 5 pricing it at $52.49 / £44.99 for the base edition, $82.49 / £71.24 for the gold edition, or $97.49 / £86.24 for the ultimate edition. You can find it right here .\nAlternatively, dip into our pick of the best Star Wars games for more tales from that galaxy far, far away, or perhaps one of the best RPGs on PC in 2024.\nYou can also follow us on Google News for daily PC games news, reviews, and guides, or grab our PCGN deals tracker to net yourself some bargains.",

    "text": "Product : EA SPORTS FC 25\nPlatform : Xbox Series X\nPlease specify your platform model. Microsoft Xbox Series X\nWhat is your Gamertag/PSN ID/Switch ID? Gr4yven\nWhich mode has this happened in? Ultimate Team™\nWhich part of the mode? Rivals\nCan you tell us the date (MM/DD/YYYY) that you saw the bug? 1/8/24\nWhat time did you see the bug? (HH:MM AM/PM) 12:00 m\nWhat is your time zone? GMT (UTC)\nHow often does the bug occur? Every time (100%)\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? To reproduce the issue, follow these steps on an Xbox Series X: Launch EA SPORTS FC 25 and enter the Division Rivals mode. Connect a second controller and attempt to add a second guest to the match (in addition to the main user and the first guest). You will notice that the game does not allow adding more than one guest. It only recognizes the main player and the first guest, rejecting any attempt to add a second or third guest.\nWhat happens when the bug occurs? When the bug occurs, the game does not allow adding a second guest to the Division Rivals match. After connecting a second controller and attempting to add another guest, the option to include more players is unavailable, and the system only recognizes the main user and the first guest.\nWhat should be happening instead? The game should allow adding up to three guests, enabling a total of four players (the main user plus three guests) to participate in Division Rivals matches, as was possible on previous consoles like PlayStation 4.\n‌\nIn both editions of EA FC , 24 and 25 , on Xbox Series X , I have not been able to add a second guest to the matches, something I could easily do on PS4 without any issues.\nIt doesn’t seem fair that Xbox users don’t have access to a feature that is available on other platforms. We are paying the same price for the game and deserve the same quality of experience. I hope this can be resolved soon.",

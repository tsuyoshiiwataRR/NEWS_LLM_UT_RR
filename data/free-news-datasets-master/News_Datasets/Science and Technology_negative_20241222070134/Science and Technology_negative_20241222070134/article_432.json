    "text": "Chennai Student Files Legal Notice Over Real Phone Number Used In Amaran\nIn Amaran, an engineering student's real phone number was used, prompting him to send a legal notice for compensation over the harassment.\nA Chennai-based engineering student, VV Vaageesan, has sent a legal notice to the producers and director of the movie Amaran, demanding compensation for the emotional distress caused by the film. The incident stems from a scene in which actress Sai Pallavi writes a phone number on a piece of paper and hands it to the character played by Sivakarthikeyan. However, the phone number shown in the film does not belong to Sai Pallavi but belongs to Vaageesan, who has since been bombarded with calls from her fans.\nThe movie, released during Diwali, is inspired by the life of Major Mukund Varadarajan and stars Sivakarthikeyan. Unbeknownst to Vaageesan, his phone number was featured in a romantic scene between the characters. The phone number shown in the film was, in fact, his real number, which he uses for his Aadhaar, bank accounts, and other important personal services, making it impossible for him to change the number.\nVaageesan, who was celebrating Diwali with his family, initially thought the influx of calls was a coincidence. However, as the volume of calls grew, he realized that his number had been used in the film. The callers were repeatedly asking if they could speak to Sai Pallavi, causing Vaageesan significant distress. He eventually turned off his phone, but the interruptions continued. Despite his attempts to reach out to the film’s director, Rajkumar Periyasamy, and the lead actor, Sivakarthikeyan, via social media for help, he received no response.\nIn light of the ongoing harassment, Vaageesan has filed a legal notice demanding Rs 1.1 crore in compensation for the mental anguish, anxiety, and disruption caused by the repeated phone calls. He claims that the calls have severely impacted his ability to sleep, study, and carry out basic tasks. Vaageesan has also requested that his phone number be immediately removed from the film. The student’s lawyer emphasized that his client’s phone number is tied to essential documents, making it difficult for him to change it.\nVaageesan’s legal action has sparked public attention, highlighting the potential consequences of using real-life phone numbers in films without the consent of the individuals involved.\n- Location :\n- First Published:",

    "text": "It's been a long time since the gaming industry has seen such a major and unexpected disaster as the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is crashing! The ambitious game has been heavily criticised due to server problems and deceived expectations .\nThe ambitious game, which was supposed to be a new milestone in the history of flight simulators, turned out to be filled with a huge number of problems and three days after the release many gamers are unable to launch it even after increasing the capacity of servers.\nHere's What We Know Game director of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Jorg Neumann published a statement in which he admitted that the release of the game did not go as planned and Asobo Studio apologises to those who were eagerly waiting for the release of the flight simulator.\nThe development team promises to make a huge effort, working day and night to fix all the bugs in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 so that everyone can finally enjoy flying.\nFor this purpose Asobo Studio will release as many patches as needed.\nWe have increased our server capacity and are seeing more players accessing the sim, however, we are still seeing access issues continue.\nThis is not the launch experience we want for our players and want to apologise to the community. We will continue to work around the clock....\n- Microsoft Flight Simulator✈️ (@MSFSofficial) November 21, 2024\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024 has already entered Steam's \"Hall of Shame\" and has a rating worse than the absolutely failed Redfall and Payday 3.\nSource : Steam\nPC Microsoft Simulators Xbox Game Pass Xbox Game Studios",

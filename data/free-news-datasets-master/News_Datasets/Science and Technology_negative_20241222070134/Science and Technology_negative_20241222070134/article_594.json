    "text": "This is a lawsuit in which The New York Times accuses OpenAI of illegal use of the publication’s texts for ChatGPT training.\nThe New York Times stated that OpenAI (and Microsoft) have created their AI models by «copying and using millions» of the publication’s articles and as a result now «directly compete» with their content. The complaint also alleged that these AI models «threaten high-quality journalism by harming the news agencies’ ability to protect and monetize content.\nOn Wednesday, The New York Times filed an additional statement informing the judge that engineers at AI startup «accidentally erased evidence» proving ChatGPT’s copyright infringement. Some data has been recovered, but «the original file names and folder structure» with evidence are still unavailable.\nOpenAI spokesman Jason Deutrom denied the NYT’s claims and promised that the «company would provide its response to» in the near future.\nEarlier in the lawsuit, OpenAI was ordered to disclose information about the training data for ChatGPT. The NYT team spent «more than 150 hours» studying the data before some of it disappeared — at the same time, the plaintiff did not claim that the deletion was intentional\nSource: Engadget",

    "text": "In 2019, the space station acquired a leak in a transfer tunnel. NASA said the space station leak could lead to a \"catastrophic failure.\" The post Could the space station leak lead to 'catastrophic failure'? first appeared on EarthSky. Space station leak could be 'catastrophic'\nIn 2019, one of the modules on the International Space Station (ISS) sprang a leak. The leak is on a Russian portion of the space station – a transfer tunnel – called PrK. It separates a docking port from the rest of the module. Overall, the leak loses about 3.7 pounds (1.7 kilograms) of air per day. As a stopgap solution, astronauts have been sealing off the PrK when not in use. But how severe is the problem? According to Roscosmos, it's safe, but according to NASA, it could lead to \"the possibility of a catastrophic failure.\"\nOn November 13, 2024, NASA held a meeting on the safety and operational readiness of the space station. In that meeting, former astronaut Bob Cabana, chair of the NASA International Space Station Advisory Committee, reported on a September 2024 discussion between NASA and Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, concerning the leak.\nJeff Foust, reporting for SpaceNews, wrote:\nCabana said at the committee meeting that there is no agreement between NASA and Roscosmos on the severity of the issue. 'While the Russian team continues to search for and seal the leaks, it does not believe catastrophic disintegration of the PrK is realistic,' he said. 'NASA has expressed concerns about the structural integrity of the PrK and the possibility of a catastrophic…",

    "text": "[Coolcaesar](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Department_of_Justice_headquarters,_August_12,_2006.jpg))\n[US DOJ seeks court order forcing Google to sell Chrome](#)\nThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) and a coalition of US states [filed](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1062.0.pdf) a motion on Wednesday seeking to compel Google to divest its Chrome web browser.\nThe DOJ argued that Google’s control over Chrome has significantly bolstered its monopolistic position in the search market. The department contended that forcing Google to divest Chrome is essential to remedy its illegal monopoly. In the case of Android, the department also [highlighted](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1062.1_1.pdf) Google’s ability to leverage the operating system to favor its search products in both overt and subtle ways. However, rather than recommending a divestiture, the DOJ proposed a series of behavioral remedies aimed at limiting Google’s ability to use Android to further its dominance in general search and search text advertising. The DOJ warned that if these remedies prove insufficient, the court may ultimately be required to mandate the sale of Android as well.\nIn October, the DOJ [filed](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1052.0.pdf) prospective remedies that raised the potential for more aggressive actions, including the forced sale of Google’s Android operating system. The remedies being proposed by the government are extensive, ranging from limitations on new deals with phone or computer manufacturers to restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence, and even the possibility of a full-scale restructuring.\nThese measures are designed to last for 10 years, with specific exceptions outlined in the DOJ’s filing on Wednesday. The DOJ said its ultimate goal is to dismantle Google’s monopolistic control and restore competition to the general search ecosystem. Google President of Global Affairs Kent Walker [described](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-nov-2024/) the government’s proposal as “extreme.”\nIn August, Judge Amit P. Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia [found](https://www.jurist.org/news/2024/08/us-federal-judge-rules-google-violated-antitrust-law-by-monopolizing-internet-searches/) that Google illegally monopolized the online search and advertising markets. The DOJ said the court’s opinion underscores the decade-long harm caused by Google’s dominance in the markets for general search and search text advertising.\nGoogle is [scheduled](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/technology/google-search-chrome-doj.html) to submit its own proposals for addressing the search monopoly by December 20. Both parties will have the chance to revise their requests before Judge Mehta hears arguments on the remedies in the spring, with a ruling anticipated by the end of the summer.\nThe Justice Department also [sued](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/technology/apple-doj-lawsuit-antitrust.html) Apple in March, claiming the company has made it difficult for consumers to leave its ecosystem of devices and software. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission [filed](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/26/technology/ftc-amazon.html) separate lawsuits against Amazon and Meta, accusing them of anticompetitive practices and stifling competition.",

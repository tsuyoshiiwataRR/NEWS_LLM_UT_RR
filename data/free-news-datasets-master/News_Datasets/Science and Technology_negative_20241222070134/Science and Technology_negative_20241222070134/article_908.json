    "text": "As you may know, Google was judged to be running a monopoly, and the US government suggested that forcing Google to sell off some of its subsidiaries was an option.\nIt turns out we didn\\u2019t have to wait long for the Department of Justice (DOJ) to reveal its ideas.\nSelling Chrome In a filing this week, the DOJ proposed that Google be forced to spin off the Chrome browser as a remedy for its alleged illegal monopoly in search and search advertising.\nThis is about as drastic as it gets, considering Chrome is the most popular browser in the world.\nThe argument is that Google uses its dominant browser to \\u201cfortify\\u201d its dominance in search. No rival search engine can hope to secure the kind of deals Google Search enjoys on Chrome as long as Google owns the browser.\nThe DOJ believes spinning Chrome off would \\u201cpermanently stop Google\\u2019s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines to access the browser that, for many users, serves as a gateway to the internet.\\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, Google will fight tooth and nail to prevent this.\nLosing this fight would be catastrophic for Google, especially since the DOJ has hinted it might pursue forcing Google to sell off Android if things escalate further.\nNo search deals The DOJ isn\\u2019t stopping there. It has also proposed additional measures to break up Google\\u2019s search monopoly, including blocking Google from making deals like the one it has with Apple.\nCurrently, Google pays Apple around $20 billion annually to remain the default search engine on the Safari browser.\nWhile this move might level the playing field for other search engines, it could create problems for smaller browsers that rely on similar agreements.\nMozilla, the maker of Firefox, argues that if a ban on such deals is enforced, it will hurt independent browsers like Firefox and may negatively impact an open and accessible internet.\nHowever, DuckDuckGo disagrees and believes this could shake up the industry for the better.\nChoice screen Google is the default search engine on almost every device, meaning users rarely choose their search engine for themselves. The DOJ wants to change that by requiring device manufacturers to present users with a \\u201cchoice screen\\u201d offering multiple search engine options.\nHere\\u2019s an example:\nWhen was the last time you saw a screen like this? The one above is from Microsoft\\u2019s Edge browser, which explains why Bing is the recommended default option.\nLet\\u2019s be honest, though\\u2014most of us wouldn\\u2019t pick Google\\u2019s competitors if presented with this choice screen. Google is objectively better than the rest, at least for now.\nHowever, the DOJ has another proposal aimed at giving competitors a better chance.\nLicensing data The DOJ wants to force Google to license data about search queries, results, and user clicks to its rivals. As someone new to these issues, I find it surprising that this is even an option.\nI would have thought search query data was a competitive advantage that companies couldn\\u2019t be forced to share.\nIf implemented, this requirement could make things more interesting.\nGoogle\\u2019s competitors would have a fairer chance to develop better search products. They could build on the demand Google has created for quality web searches and use that data to improve their offerings.\nGoogle argues this is deeply troubling, as it would require sharing its innovations, results, and even Americans\\u2019 personal search queries with unknown foreign and domestic companies.\nNo more acquisitions The DOJ also wants to ban Google from buying or investing in advertising or search companies, including AI chatbot developers. This would prevent the tech giant from simply buying out its competition.\nGoogle warns that this could \\u201cchill our investment in artificial intelligence, perhaps the most important innovation of our time, where Google plays a leading role.\\u201d\nShould be interesting Google believes the DOJ is overreaching and plans to fight these proposals in court for years to come. It\\u2019s safe to assume even the DOJ doesn\\u2019t expect to win on all fronts, but they seem to be aiming high.\nI wonder how many of us voluntarily choose Google Search\\u2019s competitors. I\\u2019ve tried DuckDuckGo and Bing out of curiosity, but Google still feels superior.\nThe only thing that\\u2019s taken some of my search business is AI chatbots, especially ChatGPT. When researching something, I often start with ChatGPT and move to websites from there, bypassing Google entirely.\nFor quick updates on recent events, I still rely on Google. However, AI chatbots might pose a bigger threat to Google than Bing or other traditional competitors. At least, that\\u2019s been my experience.\nAlso read:",

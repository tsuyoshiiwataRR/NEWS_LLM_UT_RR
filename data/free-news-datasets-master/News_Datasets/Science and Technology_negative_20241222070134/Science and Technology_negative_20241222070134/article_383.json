    "text": "Green Line issue- the problem that has become common nowadays in smartphones where green or pink lines suddenly start appearing on the display of a smartphone. Previously we have shared with you numerous reports about users facing this issue in some cases they got a free screen replacement while some were denied. Smartphone brands have also recently started recognizing this issue by offering free screen replacements to selected models facing this issue.\nRecently a Xiaomi 13 Pro user has been affected with this green line issue. A user named @gupthajalluri reported on the X platform that a friend faced this issue on his Xiaomi 13 Pro. He also shared the images of the device.\nAs per the user, this problem occurred after a recent OTA update. On contacting Xiaomi India via X he was asked to visit the service center, but when the user did the same he was denied free service and was instead asked to pay Rs.24k to get this issue resolved. It is said that the device doesn’t have any physical damage but this issue occurred after the OTA update only but still, the user is not getting free screen replacement. The user has also shared his service order slip as proof.\nThis is not the first time a user has faced the issue of free screen replacement being denied for a green line issue. Let’s see when there will be a permanent solution to this long-time haunting issue.",

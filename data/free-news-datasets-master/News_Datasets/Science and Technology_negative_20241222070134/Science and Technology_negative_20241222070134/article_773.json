    "text": "As the season of flagship Androids has begun, most eyes are on the South Korean tech giant Samsung and its upcoming flagship S25 series. As you may know, the Galaxy S25 series can include four phones: vanilla S25, S25+, a new S25 Slim, and the top-end S25 Ultra. The last one is the most anticipated smartphone, but it can also be pricier compared to its previous generation counterpart.\nAs per tipster SetsunaDigital, this time the production cost or the Bill of Materials (BOM) of the Galaxy S25 Ultra is higher. It may be $110 (approximately Rs 9,200) higher than the current Galaxy S24 Ultra. Since the production cost is higher, its retail cost can also go up for the customers, especially for those outside China. In China, Samsung can maintain the current prices.\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra is presently priced at Rs 1,29,999 in India. With a price hike, the Galaxy S25 Ultra can come closer to the price range of the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which is for Rs 1,49,900. But the issue is that things aren’t clear yet. While some reports suggest that only the prices of the S25 Ultra will go up, others suggest that the entire lineup might retain the prices.\nReports suggest that Samsung can price the Galaxy S25 Ultra base model at $1,299, the S25+ at $999, and the standard Galaxy S25 at $799. Apple’s decision to retain the pricing of the iPhone 16 lineup could influence Samsung to do the same in markets like India and the US.\nPreviously we saw in India that Samsung adjusted Galaxy S24 Ultra prices after the iPhone 16 Pro launched with a competitive price tag of Rs 1,19,900. So let’s see how it goes with the Galaxy S25 Ultra to compete with Apple and to prevent users from switching.",

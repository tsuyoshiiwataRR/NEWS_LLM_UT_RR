    "text": "Released two months ago, Paradise was billed as a giant open-world game that could rival GTA 6. However, behind the impressive, albeit unspectacular, footage, some very suspicious details have emerged. According to YouTuber Jetro and other researchers, many elements used in the game’s trailer were purchased from the Unreal Engine Assets Store or copied from other games. Here are the details…\nParadise: GTA 6 alternative or Russian crypto scam?\nLet’s start with the trailer. First of all, elements such as vehicles and brands seen in the trailer are allegedly unlicensed. In addition, many influencers who are listed as advertising collaborators on the game’s official website have stated that they have no connection to this project.\nAlthough the game’s website lists an office address in Hong Kong, it turns out that this address is not correct. Ultra Games Ltd. says the office is located elsewhere, but refuses to share a precise location. The elements seen in the trailer will not appear in the final game. However, the main point of interest is the allegations that this game is a cryptocurrency-focused scam as much as its existence.\nThe cryptocurrency, called ParadiseTap ($PAR), is distributed via Telegram and can supposedly be used to buy items in the game or redeem them for real money. Currently, $100,000 $PAR is worth about $500. So it is very likely that this system is a fraud network designed to attract investors.\nThe fact that the game is listed on Steam still raises questions about its existence. It is unclear whether Paradise is actually a game or just a trailer project. So for now, more information is needed to understand whether Paradise is real or just an investment trap.",

    "text": "Microsoft has just launched the KB5046740 update, or November’s non-security patch, for Windows 11 24H2. And with that, the Redmond tech giant may make the OS a lot more stuffed and filled with jump lists than before.\nA “jump list” is a Windows feature that lets you quickly access recent files, folders, or tasks related to an app by right-clicking its icon on the taskbar or Start menu.\nSo now, when you right-click on apps pinned to the Start menu, jump lists will appear for those apps that support jump lists—which makes Windows 11 more cramped than before . And, if you hold the Shift and CTRL keys while clicking on a jump list item, it will open the item with administrative privileges.\nThe KB5046740 also rebrands “Tailored Experiences” as “Personalized offers” to give a better clearance. You can find this rebrand in the Settings app under Privacy & Security. There, you can manage the settings and choose whether to send data about your device to improve Windows or not.\nThe update also shortens the date & time display in the system tray & rolls out new options for touchscreen edge gestures & the feature to directly share content from File Explorer to Android devices, which Microsoft first tested some time ago . And, Task Manager also now has better support for dark mode & text scaling.\nBut, as we’re approaching the holiday season, this may be the last non-security update for Windows 11 we’ll be seeing in 2024.",

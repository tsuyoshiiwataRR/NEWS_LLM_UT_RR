    "text": "Hackers have targeted The Real World, an online course founded by controversial influencer Andrew Tate, exposing data on nearly 800,000 users.\nThe breach, revealed on Thursday, compromised 325,000 unique email addresses and chat logs from over 600 servers. The Real World, formerly known as Hustler’s University, offers users training in areas like fitness, finance, and e-commerce for $50 per month.\nThe attackers announced their presence by flooding the platform's chatroom with provocative emojis, including a transgender flag and AI-generated images mocking Tate. The breach reportedly exploited vulnerabilities that allowed hackers to upload files, delete attachments, crash clients, and temporarily ban users.\nThe hackers, motivated by “hacktivism,” cited the platform's inadequate security, describing it as \"hilariously insecure.\" Data from the breach was shared with services like HaveIBeenPwned and the journalism collective DDoSecrets, which hosts leaked information of public interest.\nAndrew Tate, who claims over 113,000 active users on the platform, is currently facing multiple legal battles, including human trafficking charges in Romania. Critics argue that his platform perpetuates toxic content, aligning with his controversial views on masculinity.\nThe breach highlights concerns over user privacy and security on such platforms, as leaked email addresses and chat data continue to circulate online.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our [Comments FAQ](/comments-policy)",

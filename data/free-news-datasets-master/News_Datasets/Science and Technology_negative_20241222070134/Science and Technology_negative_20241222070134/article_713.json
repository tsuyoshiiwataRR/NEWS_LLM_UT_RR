    "text": "Google has reportedly canceled the development of its second-generation Pixel Tablet, according to recent reports (Via 9to5Google ) from Android Authority. The decision comes amid concerns about potential financial losses from the project, marking a significant shift in Google’s tablet strategy.\nInitial rumors suggested that Google had ambitious plans for its tablet line, with the Pixel Tablet 2 planned for 2025 and a third-generation device, codenamed “Kiyomi,” slated for 2027. The canceled device was expected to maintain a similar design to its predecessor while featuring thinner bezels and introducing a new first-party keyboard cover accessory with a touchpad.\nThe development team had reportedly been working on enhanced features, including a 5G variant, though the project was still in its early development and prototyping stages. While Android Headlines initially reported the cancellation of a “Pixel Tablet 3,” Android Authority clarified that the terminated project was actually the Pixel Tablet 2.\nDespite this setback, sources indicate that Google hasn’t completely abandoned its tablet ambitions. The company may still proceed with its rumored Tensor G6-powered model planned for 2027, suggesting a potential return to the tablet market in the future.\nCurrent Pixel Tablet owners need not worry about support, as the cancellation won’t affect future software updates. Google maintains its commitment to large-screen Android development, particularly given the continued popularity of foldable devices. The platform will continue to receive updates, including desktop windowing features expected in Android 15 QPR1 this December, and the company’s reported ChromeOS-to-Android migration efforts will maintain focus on desktop-level optimizations.",

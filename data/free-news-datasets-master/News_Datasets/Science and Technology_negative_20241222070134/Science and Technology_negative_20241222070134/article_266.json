    "text": "AI-generated deepfake attacks have been identified as the primary security risk for IT professionals in Australia, according to GetApp's Annual Data Security Report. The report underscores a significant concern over the potential for AI-enhanced cyberattacks, with 55% of surveyed IT professionals indicating that deepfake attacks are their chief threat for the current year and looking forward to 2025. In response to this threat, 66% of Australian companies have now developed response plans.\nGetApp conducted this research by surveying 4,000 IT professionals across 11 countries, with 500 respondents from Australia. The survey also highlighted ongoing issues with other cyber threats, such as email phishing and ransomware.\nPhishing remains a predominant concern. The report reveals that 92% of Australian IT professionals experienced phishing emails over the past year, with 86% encountering colleagues who had clicked on malicious links. Phishing and ransomware attacks are projected to remain pressing issues in 2025, seen as the top threats by 32% and 30% of IT professionals, respectively.\nRansomware incidents particularly affected Australian businesses in 2024, with 64% reporting attacks aimed at extorting and stealing data. Of those targeted by ransomware, 60% paid the demanded ransom, while only 24% managed to recover their data independently. Sadly, 28% suffered permanent data loss.\nData breach statistics in Australia are concerning, with occurrences higher than the global average. Seventy-two percent of IT professionals in Australia reported one or more data breaches within the past year, compared to a global average of 61%. The prevalent causes include software vulnerabilities (50%), malware (47%), and social engineering tactics (38%). Moreover, 37% of breaches were attributed to non-malicious errors like system misconfigurations.\nThe importance of regular system checks is emphasized to prevent potential breaches. Reassessing data security measures emerges as a priority for 51% of Australian respondents, especially in light of evolving AI threats.\nSecurity awareness efforts are evident, with 75% of Australian workers participating in simulated phishing attacksâ€”this figure surpasses the global average of 70%. Such exercises are designed to strengthen email security by raising awareness of social engineering tactics and identifying areas requiring further training.\nAndrew Blair, Content Analyst at GetApp, commented on the findings: \"IT professionals need to remain vigilant against a new incoming wave of AI-generated deepfake attacks and ensure they have the right protocols and procedures in place for them if they haven't done so already.\"\nHe added, \"Additionally, IT professionals will also need to improve basic cybersecurity efforts in 2025 to curb the amount of data breaches as regulations begin to tighten.\"\nThe report sheds light on the evolving landscape of cyber threats and the need for robust security measures to protect against them in the coming years.",

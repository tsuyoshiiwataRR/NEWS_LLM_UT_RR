    "text": "How to remove the Oovi Appc potentially unwanted application\n Written by Tomas Meskauskas on\nWhat kind of application is Oovi Appc?\nWhile inspecting deceptive sites, our researchers discovered an installation setup containing Oovi Appc. This piece of software is classed as a PUA ([Potentially Unwanted Application](/common-types-of-computer-infections#potentially-unwanted-application)). These apps typically possess harmful functionalities.\nWhat is more, PUAs tend to infiltrate systems in bundles (i.e., packed together with other unwanted or malicious software). This is true of the Oovi Appc installer that we investigated.\nPotentially unwanted application overview\nAs mentioned in the introduction, potentially unwanted applications tend to have harmful capabilities. Data-tracking functionalities are the most prevalent in these apps. Targeted information may include: browsing and search engine histories, Internet cookies, log-in credentials (usernames/passwords), personally identifiable details, credit card numbers, etc. The gathered data can be monetized via sale to third-parties (potentially, cyber criminals).\nPUAs can also operate as [adware](/common-types-of-computer-infections#adware) and [browser hijackers](/common-types-of-computer-infections#browser-hijacker). Advertising-supported software can display third-party graphical content (ads) or generate redirects to various websites. These advertisements promote deceptive and malicious content. Once clicked on, some of the adverts can even execute scripts to perform sneaky downloads/installations.\nBrowser-hijacking software modifies browser settings (e.g., default search engines, homepages, new tab/window URLs, etc.) to promote their webpages. Typically, hijackers endorse fake search engines that cannot provide search results and redirect to legitimate Internet search websites (e.g., [Yahoo](/removal-guides/8835-search-yahoo-com-redirect), [Bing](/removal-guides/9633-bing-com-redirect), [Google](/removal-guides/4251-remove-google-redirect-virus), etc.). In the seldom instances that these sites can generate search results – they are inaccurate and may include sponsored, unreliable, deceptive, and potentially malicious content.\nKeep in mind that PUAs can possess other abilities aside from those described in this article. In summary, the presence of unwanted software on devices may result in system infections, serious privacy issues, financial losses, and even identity theft.\nName | Oovi Appc potentially unwanted application |\nThreat Type | PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program), PUA (Potentially Unwanted Application) |\nDetection Names (installer) | AliCloud (Trojan:Win/Agent.AUXZ), ESET-NOD32 (Win32/Agent.AGOE), Tencent (Unk.Win32.Script.404795), Full List Of Detections (\n|\nTo eliminate possible malware infections, scan your computer with legitimate antivirus software.

Users can be enticed into downloading/installing this software by promises of \"useful\" and \"advantageous\" functionalities. However, these functions rarely work as promised, and in most cases – they are completely nonoperational.\nIt must be stressed that even if a piece of software functions exactly as indicated by its promotional material – that is not a guarantee of legitimacy or safety.\nHow did potentially unwanted applications install on my computer?\nWe downloaded an installer containing Oovi Appc (and other suspect software) from a deceptive webpage. PUAs are promoted on legitimate-looking download sites and scam pages. They are primarily accessed via redirects caused by websites utilizing rogue advertising networks, intrusive adverts, [spam browser notifications](/common-types-of-computer-infections#notification-spam), misspelled URLs, and installed adware.\n\"Bundling\" – packing ordinary program installation setups with unwanted/malicious additions – is also used to spread PUAs. These pre-packed installers can be downloaded from freeware and free file-hosting sites, P2P sharing networks, and other dubious sources. The risk of allowing bundled content into the system is furthered by treating installation processes with negligence (e.g., ignoring terms, skipping sections, using \"Easy/Express\" settings, etc.).\nAdditionally, unwanted software is proliferated by intrusive advertisements. Once clicked on, some of these ads can execute scripts to perform downloads/installations without user consent.\nHow to avoid installation of potentially unwanted applications?\nWe highly recommend researching software and downloading it only from official/verified channels. Installation processes must be approached with care, e.g., by reading terms, exploring available options, using the \"Custom\" or \"Advanced\" settings, and opting out of all supplementary apps, extensions, features, etc.\nAnother recommendation is to be careful while browsing since fake and malicious online content usually appears genuine and harmless. For example, intrusive adverts may look innocuous – however, they redirect to unreliable and questionable sites (e.g., scam-promoting, gambling, adult dating, pornography, etc.).\nShould you keep experiencing advertisements/redirects of this kind, check the device and immediately remove all suspicious applications and browser extensions/plug-ins. If your computer is already infected with PUAs, we recommend running a scan with [Combo Cleaner Antivirus for Windows](/download-combo-cleaner-windows) to automatically eliminate them.\nDeceptive website promoting Oovi Appc application:\nInstant automatic malware removal:\nManual threat removal might be a lengthy and complicated process that requires advanced IT skills.

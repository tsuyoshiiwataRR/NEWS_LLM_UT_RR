    "text": "I presume this is an easy answer because I didn't find anyone else with this problem. Just trying to compile the basic 'graphicstest.ino' in the PaulStoffregen/ST7789_t3 examples. This is with Arduino IDE. The compiler finds ST7789_t3 and ST7789_t3.cpp in the Arduino Libraries, where I put them. The basic error is\nThat error is repeated for all the vars in:\nI assume this code was not specifically written for T4.1 so I added the following to the defined code:\nwhich didn't help.\nThat is the only change I made to the example code and libraries.\nWhat the heck am I missing?\nThank you!\nCode:\nerror: '_cs' was not declared in this scope; did you mean 'cs'?\n_cs = cs;\nThat error is repeated for all the vars in:\nCode:\n#if defined(__MK20DX128__) || defined(__MK20DX256__) || defined(__MK64FX512__) || defined(__MK66FX1M0__)\nuint8_t _cs, _rs, _rst, _sid, _sclk;\nuint8_t colstart, rowstart;\nuint8_t pcs_data, pcs_command;\nuint32_t ctar;\nvolatile uint8_t *datapin, *clkpin, *cspin, *rspin;\n#endif\nI assume this code was not specifically written for T4.1 so I added the following to the defined code:\nCode:\n|| defined(__IMXRT1060RM__)\nwhich didn't help.\nThat is the only change I made to the example code and libraries.\nWhat the heck am I missing?\nThank you!",

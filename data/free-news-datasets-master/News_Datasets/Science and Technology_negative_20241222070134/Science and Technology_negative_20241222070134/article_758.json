    "text": "Nigeria is facing a significant surge in cyber threats, recording 18,872 cyber attacks monthly, according to a recent report. This alarming statistic highlights Nigeria's position as a major digital hub in Africa.\nThe threat of cyberattacks has grown in Africa, especially in Nigeria, which faces 4,718 weekly attacks.\nCheck Point Software Technologies, a cyber security platform provider, disclosed this in its 2024 African Perspectives on Cyber Security Report, which was released on Thursday. Nigeria has witnessed a sharp rise in cyber-attacks, with the country ranked 19th in the global rankings for attacks in July.\nThis growth has been recorded on the back of a growing digital economy, with more people coming online and becoming more vulnerable to hackers.\nThe federal government has had to issue at least 33 cyberattack advisories in the past year, the highest number on record.\nAccording to the cyber security platform, Nigeria is one of the most vulnerable to attacks on the continent. It noted that in a recent incident, a banking trojan attack compromised 100,000 customer accounts and resulted in $3 million in losses.\nFinancial institutions in the country have been the most prone to attacks. According to the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System, Fraudsters successfully scammed over 80,658 bank customers in 2023, and bank customers lost N59.33 billion between 2019 and 2023.\n\"The rapid digitalisation of Africa's key sectors has positioned the continent as a prime target for sophisticated cyber threats,\" stated Lionel Dartnall, acting country manager for South Africa at Check Point Software Technologies.\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\nTop Headlines Nigeria Business Legal Affairs Submit By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy .\nSuccess!

This is because Africa's economic growth is being driven by digital infrastructure, which has also brought increased vulnerability.\nThe company highlighted that South Africa faces 3,312 attacks weekly on government entities and a 90 percent surge in ransomware. Cybercrime costs the country close to 1 percent of its GDP. Kenya experiences 4,719 attacks weekly.\nMorocco records 8,733 attacks weekly and is one of the most targeted nations on the continent.\nThe cyber security platform noted that mounting cyber threats targeting critical sectors across the continent emphasise the need for organisations to strengthen their cyber security postures, adopt robust security measures, and align with global standards to protect operations and secure valuable trade partnerships.\nIt stated that this growth in attacks underscores the need for public-private collaboration to address these cyber security challenges, with investments in AI-driven threat detection and continuous monitoring needed. However, it noted that despite cybersecurity's critical importance, African companies allocate only 0.05 percent of their revenue to cybersecurity, far below the global average of 0.3-0.5 per cent.\nHead of Security Sales Engineering for Africa at Check Point Software Technologies, Issam El Haddioui, added, \"Now is the time for African organisations to take proactive steps to align with global standards and bolster their cybersecurity resilience.\"\nRead the original article on Leadership .",

    "text": "As of current information, the Rocket Lab “Leidos 2” mission, also known as a HASTE (Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron) mission for Leidos, is currently on hold, at Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 at Virginia’s Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport within NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, with the countdown paused; meaning the launch is delayed and not happening as planned. The exact reason for the hold is not explicitly stated, but it is likely related to technical issues or necessary adjustments before launch.\nRocket Lab will launch four HASTE (Hypersonic Accelerator Suborbital Test Electron) missions for Leidos in 2024 and 2025. All four missions will launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 at Virginia’s Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport within NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility.\nRocket Lab was selected by Leidos to provide hypersonic test launch capabilities with HASTE under the MACH-TB project. The project was awarded by Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane through the Strategic and Spectrum Missions Advanced Resilient Trusted Systems (S2MARTS) Other Transaction Authority (OTA) vehicle on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense Test Resource Management Center (TRMC).\nRocket Lab launched the first HASTE mission on 17 June 2023 for [Leidos ](https://investors.leidos.com/news-and-events/news-releases/press-release-details/2023/Leidos-MACH-TB-program-successfully-completes-1st-test-launch/default.aspx)[under](https://investors.leidos.com/news-and-events/news-releases/press-release-details/2023/Leidos-MACH-TB-program-successfully-completes-1st-test-launch/default.aspx)[ the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed (MACH-TB) program](https://investors.leidos.com/news-and-events/news-releases/press-release-details/2023/Leidos-MACH-TB-program-successfully-completes-1st-test-launch/default.aspx).\nRocket Lab’s HASTE suborbital launch vehicle is derived from the Company’s Electron rocket but has been modified to support hypersonic payload deployment. By leveraging the heritage of Rocket Lab’s low-cost Electron – the world’s most frequently launched commercial small launch vehicle – HASTE offers true commercial testing capability at a fraction of the cost of current full-scale tests.",

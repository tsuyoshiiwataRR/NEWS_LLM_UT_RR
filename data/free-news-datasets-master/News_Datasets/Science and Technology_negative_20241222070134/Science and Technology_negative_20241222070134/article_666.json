    "text": "Ellie Doughty , Foreign News Reporter Published : Invalid Date, RUSSIAN tyrant Vladimir Putin struck Ukraine with a hypersonic ballistic missile yesterday - a weapon that the US has warned could be made nuclear.\nThe medium-range \"Oreshnik\" rocket pierced through Ukrainian defences dropping a cluster-bomb of warheads on the city of Dnipro in an early morning blitz on Thursday.\n10 Video shows how a family of Russian missiles - including the RS-24, RS-26 and Oreshnik - might operate 10 It's a simulation of the RS-24 - with a slew of warheads exploding from the missile 10 The warheads - conventional or nuclear - raining down on the target 10 The simulated RS-24 taking off before aiming for its target It was initially described by Kyiv's Air Force as the RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) - which would have marked the first time a weapon of its kind had been used in war.\nBut it turned out to be a terrifying new rocket - an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) based on the older Rubezh model - which can travel at 10 times the speed of sound.\nAddressing the country, Putin said they had used the attack on Ukraine to test Russia's \"newest missile\", an IRBM called \"Oreshnik\".\nBoth are part of the same family as the original RS-24 Yars ICBM - a ferocious Russian weapon.\nREAD MORE ON UKRAINE WAR\nFIRE & FURY Moment ‘first EVER nuke-capable intercontinental missile used in war’ by Putin\nUP FOR FIGHT We're ready for war TONIGHT, says Brit military chief as Putin threatens UK A chilling simulation video shows how these weapons would operate - with an RS-24 firing off multiple warheads in the Earth's atmosphere before they rain down on unsuspecting territory below.\nThe Pentagon said that while the Oreshnik was fired with conventional warheads - Moscow could still modify the weapon to carry a nuclear payload.\n“It could be refitted to certainly carry different types of conventional or nuclear warheads,” spokesperson Sabrina Singh warned.\nShe revealed that the move by Russia - using a never-before-fired missile - is being viewed as \"experimental\" in Washington.\nMost read in The Sun\nNO CHANCE Killer mom Susan Smith & her 'crocodile tears will die in jail,' prosecutor vows\nTROUBLE OFF AIR Rachel Maddow 'takes $5 million pay cut' as network's ratings tank\nVLAD THREAT Putin warns he could strike US targets as he boasts of new missile\nFEAST FAVORITES Costco confirms 11-item Thanksgiving meal is back for $50 and serves 10 Embattled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday slammed the attack -

marking military facilities in the UK as valid targets in response to the use of Western missiles by Ukraine.\nThe Kremlin later said on their new missile: \"Russia has demonstrated its ability to respond to Western actions by using ballistic missiles.\"\n10 Putin told the world of his new weapon in a televised address after the attack on Ukraine 10 Ukrainian president Zelensky slammed the Russian tyrant as 'insane' 10 The simulation shows missiles raining down Credit: X/YOUTUBE Russia's strike on Dnipro came after Kyiv launched US ATACMS missiles against Putin's territory overnight on Monday - and British Storm Shadow rockets on Wednesday in a double-tap victory.\nChilling video showed rockets raining down on the Ukrainian city - claimed to be six different warheads.\nIt was reportedly fired from the Kapustin Yar test range in Russia’s Astrakhan region and struck the Yuzhmash defence plant in Dnipro.\nThe Kremlin also dispatched Tu-95MS strategic bombers to launch cruise missiles against embattled Ukraine.\nNato scrambled F-16 warplanes above Poland amid the barrage - putting air defence and radar systems on high alert.\nMeanwhile, a military chief told British MPs on Thursday evening that Britain would be ready to fight \"tonight\" should Putin strike another country in Europe.\nRead More on The US Sun\nSEASON'S GREETINGS Five new Dollar Tree 'jackpot finds' for the holidays starting at $1.25\nHAPPY COUPLE Bianca Censori goes topless and wraps her arms around Kanye West in Tokyo Lieutenant General Rob Magowan told the House of Commons defence committee: \"If the British Army was asked to fight tonight, it would fight tonight.\n\"I don't think anybody in this room should be under any illusion that if the Russians invaded Eastern Europe tonight, then we would meet them in that fight.\"\n10 Video showed the moment missiles rained down on Dnipro in Ukraine 10 More footage showed Russia's missile blitz over Ukraine 10 Firefighters work at the site of a missile attack by Russia in Dnipro, Ukraine Topics Europe Global politics Moscow North America Nuclear Weapons Russia Ukraine Ukraine war United States Vladimir Putin Volodymyr Zelensky YOU MIGHT LIKE",

    "text": "An Australian Cabinet minister on Friday rejected X Corp owner Elon Musk's allegation that the government intended to control all Australians' access to the internet through legislation that would ban young children from social media.\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said Musk's criticism was unsurprising after the government introduced to Parliament on Thursday legislation that would fine platforms including X up to 150 million Australian dollars ($133 million) if they allow children under age 16 to hold social media accounts.\nThe idea that Elon Musk is not delighted with our steps to try and protect kids online is not an especially big surprise to us, nor does it trouble us greatly, Chalmers told reporters.\n The spat continues months of open hostility between the Australian government and the tech billionaire over regulators' efforts to reduce public harm from social media.\nParliament could pass legislation as soon as next week that would oblige X, TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit and Instagram to ban young children from their platforms.\nThe legislation introduced on Thursday will be debated by lawmakers in Parliament on Monday.\nMore From This Section Russia supplied air defence missiles to N Korea in return for troops: Seoul European companies cut jobs amidst difficult economy, weak demand UK retail sales plunged more than expected before new govt's budget: ONS S Korea finds Russia supplied missiles to North Korea in return for troops COP29: 'X' factor could shape Global South's future, climate talks at Baku Musk responded to the legislation's introduction by posting on his platform, Seems like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\nAsked if that was the government's intention, Chalmers replied, Of course not.\nElon Musk having that view about protecting kids online is entirely unsurprising to us. He's expressed similar views before, Chalmers said.\nOur job is not to come up with a social media policy to please Elon Musk. Our job is to put in place the necessary protection for kids online, Chalmers added.\nIn April, Musk accused Australia of censorship after an Australian judge temporarily ruled that X must block users worldwide from accessing a video of a bishop being stabbed in a Sydney church.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese responded by describing Musk as an arrogant billionaire who considered himself above the law and was out of touch with the public.\nAustralian eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, the online safety watchdog who brought the court case against X, has said the legal battle led to online attacks against her and her family, including the release online of personal information without her permission, known as doxxing.\nShe said Musk had issued a dog whistle to 181 million users around the globe which resulted in her receiving death threats.\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nAlso Read Elon Musk announces X is India's number one news app on App store Elon Musk blasts Australia's proposed law to ban social media for children Jeff Bezos hits back at Musk in sniping over Tesla, SpaceX holdings Musk's budget crusade may cause constitutional clash in Trump's 2nd term 'Jeff Bezos advised selling Tesla stocks thinking Trump would lose': Musk Topics : Elon Musk Australia Internet access Don't miss the most important news and views of the day.

    "text": "\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n Anthropomorphism is the tendency to attribute human characteristics to non-human entities, such as machines \\u200cor animals. In\\u200b the case of chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini or Copilot, this phenomenon occurs when they imitate \\u200dhuman language to communicate with us.\\u200c They not only use\\u2064 understandable and familiar words and phrases, but also adopt people\\u2019s\\u200c communication patterns. They are \\u200bthus\\u200d able to maintain contextual and coherent conversations and can even show \\u200chumor and empathy.\n\\nThis\\u2062 design of language\\u2064 in\\u2064 machines seeks \\u200cto make interacting with them natural, seamless, and accessible. This makes\\u2064 it easy to\\u200d use in a variety of applications, from customer service to education and entertainment.\n\\nOne \\u200bof the most distinctive characteristics of human language is subjectivity, which manifests itself in the choice of emotionally charged words and the expression \\u2062of personal opinions. It also appears in the evaluation\\u200d of events and\\u200c the\\u2063 use \\u200bof contextual \\u2062and cultural elements.\n\\n \\n Him chatbots ELIZA, released \\u2062in 1966, already simulated \\u2064human behavior,\\u200c adopting\\u200b the role of a psychologist in conversation with the user.\n\\n\n\\n The impact of the first person \\nWhen a machine pretends to be human in communication, important ethical and\\u2062 psychological implications arise. These interactions can influence how we\\u200d perceive and relate to technology.\n\\nA typical feature of human subjectivity in language is the use of\\u2063 personal pronouns. First \\u200bperson (like \\u201cI\\u201d and \\u2062\\u201cwe\\u201d) allows you to express your thoughts and experiences. The second person (like \\u201cyou\\u201d and \\u201cyou\\u201d) engages the\\u200d interlocutor, building a relationship between\\u200d the participants in the conversation. In human interaction, this is called\\u2064 intersubjectivity.\n\\n \\n \\nUser: \\u201cHow do you prioritize which items to keep, donate, or throw away during the organizing process?\\u201d\n\\n \\n \\n Chatbots :\\u2064 \\u201cGreat question! \\u2063Organizing\\u200b your\\u200b belongings \\u2063can be complicated, but with a clear \\u200dstrategy you can make easier decisions. Here are some ideas for prioritizing what \\u2062to keep, donate or \\u200bthrow away.\\u201d\n\\n \\n \\nHim chatbots implicitly uses the first person. Even if the \\u201cI\\u201d does not appear, the sender assumes a position of\\u2064 advisor or guide.\\u200b For example, in the sentence \\u201cHere I present some ideas,\\u201d the verb \\u201cpresent\\u201d is \\u200din \\u200dthe first person.\n\\nThis\\u200c suggests that the chatbots takes on the role of the\\u200b one who provides help.\\u200d The user \\u2064therefore perceives personal treatment, even if the \\u201cI\\u201d is not explicitly used. Additionally, the use of \\u201cpresent\\u201d reinforces the image of the sender as someone offering something valuable.\n\\n Use of the second\\u2064 person \\n\\u201cYou\\u201d (and forms such as \\u201cyou\\u201d and \\u201cyour\\u201d) are used to address \\u2063you\\u2062 directly. This is found in \\u200bseveral parts of the text, such as in the sentences: \\u201cOrganize THE \\u2064 your possessions can be overwhelming\\u201d and \\u201cwith a\\u200c clear strategy, Candies make decisions easier.\\u201d\n\\nWhen I talk to him personally, he chatbots Try to make the reader\\u200b feel like an active part \\u200cof the advice. This \\u2063type\\u200c of language is common in\\u2064 texts \\u2063that seek to directly engage the other.\n\\nOther elements \\u200bin the interaction, such as \\u201cGreat \\u200dquestion!\\u201d, not only positively\\u2064 evaluate\\u2063 the user\\u2019s\\u2064 question \\u2063but also encourage participation. Similarly, expressions such \\u2063as \\u201ccan be overwhelming\\u201d suggest a shared experience, creating an illusion of empathy by acknowledging the user\\u2019s possible emotions.\n\\n Effects of artificial empathy \\nThe use of the first person by the chatbots \\u200b it simulates consciousness and tries to create an illusion of empathy. By adopting\\u200d a helping position and\\u200c using the second person, you involve the user and reinforce the perception of closeness. This combination creates a conversation that feels more human and practical, suited to\\u200c counseling, even if the empathy comes from\\u200d an algorithm, not real understanding.\n\\nGetting used to interacting with non-conscious entities that simulate identity and personality can have long-term effects. These interactions can influence aspects of our personal, \\u200csocial and cultural lives.\n\\nAs these \\u2063technologies improve, distinguishing between a \\u2063conversation with a person \\u200band one with \\u200can artificial intelligence may become \\u200ddifficult.\n\\nThis blurring of the boundaries between the human and the artificial influences\\u2063 how we understand authenticity,\\u200b empathy, and conscious presence in communication. We could even\\u200c treat artificial intelligences as if they were conscious beings, generating confusion about their real\\u2062 capabilities.\n\\n It is uncomfortable to talk to humans \\nInteractions with machines can\\u200c also change our expectations of \\u200dhuman relationships. As we get used to quick, seamless, conflict-free interactions,\\u2063 we may feel more frustrated \\u200bin our relationships with people.\n\\nHuman relationships are marked by emotions, misunderstandings and complexity. This, \\u2063in the long term, could decrease our patience and ability to manage conflicts and accept natural imperfections in\n\\nFurthermore, prolonged exposure to entities\\u200b that simulate\\u200c humanity raises\\u200c ethical and philosophical\\u2064 dilemmas.\\u200d By ascribing to them human\\u2062 qualities, such as the ability to feel or have intentions, we might begin to question the \\u2063value of conscious life in the face of a perfect simulation. This could open up debates about robot rights and the value of human \\u200cconsciousness.\n\\nInteracting with non-conscious \\u2062entities that\\u200c mimic human identity can alter our \\u2064perception \\u200bof communication, relationships, and identity. While these technologies \\u200coffer efficiency benefits, it is crucial to be aware of their limitations and possible impacts on the way we interact, both with machines and with each \\u2062other.\n\\n\n\\n \\n Interview between Time.news Editor and AI Communication Expert\n\\n Editor: Welcome to Time.news, where we delve into the most pressing topics of our time. Today, we have\\u2063 Dr. Maya Thompson, a renowned expert in AI communication and anthropomorphism. Dr. Thompson, thank you for \\u2063joining us!\n\\n Dr. Thompson: Thank you\\u2064 for having me! It\\u2019s a pleasure to discuss such\\u200b a fascinating topic.\n\\n Editor: Let\\u2019s dive right in. Anthropomorphism is a key concept in AI communication, especially \\u2062with chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini. Can you explain how this tendency shapes our interactions with these technologies?\\u200d\n\\n Dr. Thompson: Absolutely! Anthropomorphism refers to attributing human characteristics\\u2062 to non-human entities. In the context of chatbots, they leverage this tendency \\u200dby mimicking human language and\\u200c communication patterns. This human-like approach\\u2064 helps make interactions feel more natural and accessible, which is essential for their various applications, from customer service to education and entertainment.\n\\n Editor: That\\u2019s interesting! \\u2064You mentioned \\u2064the\\u2063 use of language\\u2014the emotionally charged \\u2064words and personal opinions. How does \\u2063this\\u200d subjectivity impact our perception\\u200c of chatbots?\n\\n Dr. Thompson: Human language is incredibly subjective, which means \\u2064it\\u2019s colored by emotions and personal experiences. When \\u2062chatbots use phrases that resonate on a personal level, it creates a connection. For instance, using phrases like \\u201cGreat \\u200cquestion!\\u201d not\\u2063 only\\u200d acknowledges the user\\u2019s input but also fosters engagement. This ability to simulate an understanding of emotions can \\u2062lead users to feel more connected to the technology, even if it\\u2019s an algorithm responding.\n\\n Editor: It\\u2064 sounds like chatbots are not just providing information; they\\u2019re creating a relational experience. Can you explain the significance of first-person and second-person language in this\\u200d context?\n\\n Dr. Thompson: Certainly! The use of first-person language, such as \\u201cI present\\u201d or similar\\u200d constructs, positions the chatbot as a guide or advisor. It suggests a personal touch, even when the \\u201cI\\u201d may not be explicitly stated. On the flip side, when \\u200dchatbots use second-person language\\u2014addressing users directly\\u2014it helps engage them as\\u200c active participants in the conversation. This combination \\u2063creates a conversational dynamic that feels\\u2062 intimate and personalized.\n\\n Editor: \\u200cSo, there\\u2019s an illusion of empathy created through language. What are the ethical implications of this?\n\\n Dr. \\u2064Thompson: The ethical implications are substantial. When chatbots simulate empathy, users may develop emotional attachments \\u200cor rely on them for support without realizing they lack true understanding or consciousness. Over\\u200d time, this can affect how individuals relate to technology and even\\u200d to each other. It\\u2019s crucial for users to understand\\u200d that, while these interactions\\u200b may feel personal, they\\u2019re \\u2063ultimately driven by algorithms.\n\\n Editor: That raises an important point. As these technologies evolve, do you think there are long-term effects on our social and cultural dynamics?\n\\n Dr. \\u2063Thompson: Definitely. As \\u2064interacting with these anthropomorphized entities becomes normal, we may start to \\u200dblur the lines between machine and human interactions in our daily lives. This could influence our expectations of human relationships, communication, and \\u200deven societal norms. We might become desensitized\\u200b to the lack of authentic emotional exchange, which poses challenges in how we\\u2063 engage with one another.\n\\n Editor: Insightful! What advice would you give to \\u200dusers to navigate these interactions healthily?\n\\n Dr. Thompson: I\\u2019d say, approach chatbots with awareness. Understand that while they may provide valuable information and mimic \\u2064empathy,\\u200d they do not possess consciousness \\u200dor genuine emotions. Prioritize real\\u2064 human connections, and use AI tools as aids rather than replacements for interpersonal relationships. Balance is key.\n\\n Editor: Thank you, Dr. Thompson, for shedding light on this complex interplay between humanity and technology.\\u200d It\\u2019s clear that as chatbots become more intelligent and relatable, we need to remain thoughtful about our interactions with them.\n\\n Dr. Thompson: Thank you\\u2064 for having me! It\\u2019s been\\u2064 a pleasure discussing these vital issues.\n\\n Editor: And thank you to our audience for tuning in.

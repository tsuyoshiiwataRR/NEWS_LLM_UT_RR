    "text": "The rapid expansion of AI has been a double-edged sword. Over the past 20 months, we’ve witnessed AI transform entire sectors, driving innovation and productivity. However, this growth has also introduced novel risks, many of which are significant, particularly those emanating from criminal enterprises adept at weaponizing technology.\nAlso Read: AI helps Data Engineers be Distinguished Data Engineers The swift adoption of large language models (LLMs) and natural language -to-code applications has created a sea change in the AI software development industry by accelerating the speed and scale of threats.\nThis democratization of AI, while beneficial for innovation, also broadens the attack surface, providing new avenues for potential adversaries to exploit​​. Generative AI ‘s (GenAI’s) accessibility means virtually anyone could become a threat actor, whether intentionally or inadvertently. We’ve already seen users with minimal coding knowledge or experience create malicious tools that can attack, infiltrate, or take control of systems ranging from a smartphone to a network. In terms of writing the code, it’s not a huge leap from these efforts to develop something that could take down a SCADA system.\nThe landscape of potential attackers is vast, ranging from amateur hackers to state-sponsored cybercrime groups and no organization has yet achieved any semblance of immunity, which makes the casual approach some organizations have toward AI security tough to understand. Organizational AI security can be a bit complicated, but it doesn’t have to be difficult to achieve.\nAlso Read: How we built GT Protocol’s AI Assistant Adopting a proactive mindset that understands the importance of continual reviews and updates to security measures will enable an organization to stay ahead of adversaries. The security tools put in place must also reflect a multifaceted approach, such as including advanced threat detection and mitigation solutions and tools that can provide detailed, real-time monitoring, auditing, and reporting capabilities. This sort of layered security program allows companies to harness the full potential of AI while safeguarding their assets and operations.\nSo, while the AI boom presents unprecedented opportunities for organizations across the spectrum, it also demands those organizations develop a security-first perspective supported by unrelenting human and systematic vigilance and a robust security framework to fortify them against a steady stream of cyber threats.\n[To share your insights with us as part of editorial or sponsored content, please write to psen@itechseries.com ]",

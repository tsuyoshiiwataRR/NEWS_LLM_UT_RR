    "text": "Northvolt's Bankruptcy: A Blow to Europe's Battery Ambitions\nNorthvolt, a leading Swedish battery cell maker for electric vehicles, files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S., marking a significant setback for Europe's battery industry. Northvolt faces liquidity challenges, has secured $100 million for restructuring, and expects to reorganize by early 2025.\nNorthvolt, the Swedish battery cell manufacturer for electric vehicles, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S., dealing a major blow to Europe's hopes of reducing dependency on Chinese battery suppliers. The company has secured $100 million in new financing to maintain operations during the bankruptcy process.\nDespite the financial turmoil, Northvolt plans to continue regular operations and expects to complete its restructuring by the first quarter of 2025. The company faces significant challenges, including production problems, loss of a major customer, and insufficient funding. Its financial distress highlights the fierce competition faced by European startups from dominant Chinese firms.\nVolkswagen, Northvolt's largest shareholder, and other stakeholders remain supportive, with Scania lending $100 million to bolster manufacturing efforts in Sweden. Meanwhile, Swedish officials reaffirm their commitment to supporting the local EV battery industry amid these challenging times.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nALSO READ\n[UN Experts Call for Urgent Action to Stop Illicit Financing of Mercenaries, Citing Human Rights Violations and Links to Global Crime](/article/law-order/3148556-un-experts-call-for-urgent-action-to-stop-illicit-financing-of-mercenaries-citing-human-rights-violations-and-links-to-glo)[Pawan Kalyan Ensures Direct Financing for Panchayats](/article/law-order/3149401-pawan-kalyan-ensures-direct-financing-for-panchayats)[ADB and Ipak Yuli Bank Partner to Boost Financing for Urban MSMEs in Uzbekistan with $50M Loan](/article/business/3150126-adb-and-ipak-yuli-bank-partner-to-boost-financing-for-urban-msmes-in-uzbekistan-with-50m-loan)[IMF's Unscheduled Pakistan Visit: Bridging External Financing Gap](/article/headlines/3151792-imfs-unscheduled-pakistan-visit-bridging-external-financing-gap)[Shehbaz Sharif Urges $6.8 Trillion Climate Financing for Developing Nations](/article/science-environment/3155220-shehbaz-sharif-urges-68-trillion-climate-financing-for-developing-nations)",

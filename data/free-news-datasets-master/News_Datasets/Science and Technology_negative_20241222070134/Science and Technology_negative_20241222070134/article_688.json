    "text": "You can trust VideoGamer . Our team of gaming experts spend hours testing and reviewing the latest games, to ensure you're reading the most comprehensive guide possible. Rest assured, all imagery and advice is unique and original. Check out how we test and review games here\nGSC Game World has released Stalker 2 to mixed reviews with some glowing praise and high disdain. While we were very positive in our review of the jank-filled survival game, others have not taken kindly to the long-awaited sequel in this post-apocalypse world.\nAlongside the broken A-Life system that is currently in the midst of being fixed, a number of players have taken issue with the game’s weapon durability system . Designed to make The Zone even more depressing and brutal, players upset with the mechanic are already removing it.\nStalker 2 players scrap weapon durability At the time of writing, multiple mods have already been released to remove weapon durability entirely or make it less impactful. For example, the new “ No Weapon Durability Loss ” mod completely removes the mechanic, making every gun a functional firearm. The mod also allows you to remove all durability effects from outfits as well.\nThis mod has been downloaded over 7,000 times at the time of publication with many players praising the modder for allowing them to actually use the majority of weapons they find. However, this is far from the only mod that alters this mechanic.\nAnother mod, “ Reasonable Weapon Degradation ”, has also been downloaded over 7,000 times. With this mod, weapon durability decreases half as fast as the base game, but players still have to maintain their weapons.\nAs someone who reviewed Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, the game’s weapon durability is, by far, its best combat mechanic. After a long stretch in The Zone, the possibility of your gun jamming as you take that all-important headshot is thrilling, but it’s also easy to see how players would be annoyed at it.\nIn a more reasonable modding scenario, one player has created a mod that makes the game’s mutant Bloodsuckers and Poltergeists “ less tanky ”. As the worst element of the game—outside of some of the more egregious bugs—this is a change that’s very welcome.\nFor more Stalker 2 coverage, check out some our handy guides, like how long it takes to cross the entire map or how to find the Drowned Weapon in The Zone.\nAbout the Author Lewis White\nLewis White is a veteran games journalist with a decade of experience writing news, reviews, features and investigative pieces about game development with a focus on Halo and Xbox.\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl Platform(s): PC, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series S/X, Xbox Series X Genre(s): Action, Adventure, RPG, Shooter, Survival Horror Subscribe to our newsletters!

    "text": "Aryan’s father, Sudarshan Reddy, expressed profound sorrow over the loss of his son. Source : Pixabay A 23-year-old student from Telangana, Aryan Reddy, lost his life in the United States on his birthday due to an accidental gun misfire. The incident occurred on November 13 while Aryan, a native of Uppal, Telangana, was celebrating his birthday with his friends.\nAryan was pursuing his Master’s degree at Georgia State University.\nReports indicate that Aryan had recently obtained a hunting gun licence in the US. During his birthday celebration, he reportedly brought out his new hunting gun to clean it when it accidentally discharged, as per a report on NDTV. The bullet struck his chest, leaving Aryan gravely injured.\nHearing the gunshot, his friends, who were in another room, rushed to find Aryan lying in a pool of blood. Despite their efforts to rush him to a nearby hospital, doctors declared him dead on arrival.\nAryan’s father, Sudarshan Reddy, expressed profound sorrow over the loss of his son. Speaking to India Today, he urged parents to exercise caution when their children opt to obtain gun licences while studying abroad, emphasizing the potential risks.\nAryan’s body is expected to arrive in Telangana on Friday, as his family and friends await his return.\nAryan Reddy relocated to the United States in December last year.\nIn another incident last year, a Telangana student lost his life in the US when a gun he was holding accidentally discharged, according to his family. Mahankali Akhil Sai, a 25-year-old from Khammam district, was fatally injured in Auburn, Alabama, on Monday night (local time).\nSai had moved to the US 13 months prior and was pursuing an MS degree at Auburn University while working part-time at a nearby gas station.\nMeanwhile, in the 2023-24 academic year, data from US consular officials in Hyderabad revealed that India overtook China as the top country sending students to US universities.\nALSO READ: Maoists Kill Two Tribals On Suspicion Of Being Police Informers In Telangana's Mulugu",

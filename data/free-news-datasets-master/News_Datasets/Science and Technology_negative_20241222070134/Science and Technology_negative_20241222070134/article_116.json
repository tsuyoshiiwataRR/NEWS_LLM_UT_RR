    "text": "Chronic psychological stress affects skin health and can accelerate aging, according to recent research. This study, led by Muriel Pujos from COTY Research and Development, highlights the connection between stress and visible signs of skin aging .\nThe researchers conducted a non-interventional study with 40 women aged 35 to 55. Participants had specific criteria: they spent a lot of time indoors, did not smoke, did not drink alcohol, slept well, and did not use sun lamps. They followed a standard diet during the study.\nParticipants were divided into two groups based on stress levels assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale. One group reported mild stress, while the other reported moderate stress. The study defined chronic stress as ongoing feelings of pressure and being overwhelmed.\nTo evaluate skin health, the researchers used skin samples and advanced imaging systems. They measured factors like skin roughness and moisture loss. Data were analyzed statistically to identify significant differences.\n-​ What are the potential ‍effects of​ chronic psychological stress on skin health according to recent research? Interview with Muriel ​Pujos,‌ Lead Researcher at COTY Research and‍ Development\nNews Director : Thank you for joining us today, Muriel. Your recent study delves deep into the ⁤connection between chronic‍ psychological stress and skin health. Can you tell us what prompted this research?\nMuriel ⁢Pujos : Thank you for having​ me. The motivation behind our research stemmed from a growing body ‌of ⁤evidence⁢ suggesting that ⁤psychological factors can ​significantly influence⁤ physical ‌health, ‍including skin health. We aimed to explore this connection⁤ in more ‌detail, ⁣particularly looking at ⁤how chronic stress⁣ might accelerate signs of aging in the skin.\nNews Director : The ‌study focused ⁣on ​a specific‌ demographic of women aged 35 to 55.⁢ What ‍criteria did you use for selecting the participants?\nMuriel Pujos : We ensured that our participants had similar lifestyle factors that⁣ could influence skin health. The⁣ women we ⁣included ⁤did not smoke⁤ or ‌drink alcohol, spent ​considerable time indoors, maintained ⁤good sleep habits, and adhered‍ to ⁢a standard diet ⁢throughout the study. This helped us⁢ isolate the​ effects of stress on skin health more effectively.\nNews Director :‍ You divided participants into two groups based⁣ on their⁤ stress levels. What tools did you use to assess their stress?\nMuriel ‌Pujos : We utilized‌ the Perceived Stress Scale, a widely recognized tool‌ that evaluates ⁤the degree to which individuals feel overwhelmed or pressured in their‍ lives. This allowed us to categorize ⁤participants into those experiencing mild stress and those facing moderate stress.\nNews Director : What methods did your team use​ to⁣ evaluate skin health throughout ‌the study?\nMuriel Pujos : ‌We employed skin samples and advanced imaging ⁤systems to assess ‍various skin health metrics, including skin roughness and moisture loss. These findings ‌were statistically analyzed to ⁢determine ⁣any significant differences between ⁤the two groups.\nNews Director : What were the key findings from your study regarding the impact of stress on skin health?\nMuriel Pujos : Our findings were quite revealing. We ​observed that women in the moderate stress​ group exhibited⁤ lower antioxidant levels and‌ more visible signs of aging, such as fine ⁣lines and compromised‌ skin barrier function. The evaluation⁤ showed a clear correlation between higher stress levels and poorer skin health outcomes, which we attribute to hormonal disruptions ‌related to stress.\nNews Director : In ‍light of your​ findings, ‍what would you ⁤suggest ⁣for individuals looking to protect their⁤ skin from ​the effects of stress?\nMuriel Pujos : Managing stress is ⁣crucial for not only⁣ mental well-being​ but​ also for maintaining healthy skin. Techniques such as mindfulness,‍ regular exercise, and‍ adequate sleep can help mitigate stress levels. ⁢Additionally, using skin care products that support the skin barrier and antioxidants ⁢may offer​ protective benefits.\nNews Director : What’s next for your research team? Are there plans for further ‍studies on this topic?\nMuriel Pujos : Absolutely. We believe more extensive studies are essential to fully understand the relationship between chronic stress and skin aging. ⁢We’re looking into larger participant groups and‍ potentially‌ exploring different demographics, as well as the mechanisms​ behind how stress hormones affect skin biology.\nNews Director : Thank you, Muriel, for sharing these important insights. It’s clear that managing psychological stress plays a critical role in preserving skin health.\nMuriel Pujos : Thank you⁤ for having me. I hope our research encourages ⁣people ⁣to prioritize their mental health as part of their ‍overall skin care regime.\nOf the initial participants, 36 completed the study, with equal representation from both stress groups. The average ages of participants were similar, with mild stress at 50.2 years and moderate stress at 49.7 years. The mild stress group showed lower stress scores, while the moderate group showed compromised skin barrier function and reduced antioxidant capacity.\nFindings revealed women in the moderate stress group had lower antioxidant levels and more visible signs of aging, such as fine lines. The study confirmed that chronic psychological stress disrupts skin appearance through hormones like cortisol and epinephrine.\nResearchers emphasized the need for further studies to fully understand the effects of stress on skin aging. Their findings contribute to our knowledge of how psychological factors impact our skin and underlines the importance of managing stress for maintaining skin health.",

    "text": "Sunday\nBought a nestcam outdoor and floodlight and cannot install with google app. I have other nest products that I use with the nest app. There 2 are recent purchases so I have to use the google home app. I'm literally 2 inches from the camera, light is flashing blue and it does not see the camera. I tried the qr code on camera, and even manually entering set up code, no luck. This is a first time install with google home and there are no other devices connected. I can't even pass the 1st step, it searches for cameras near me and nothing comes up. I am using on iphone\n38m ago\nHi zenga,\nThank you for reaching out to our community.\nI’m sorry to hear that you can’t install your Nest Cam with floodlights using the Google Home app. I can see you have other Nest products that you use with the Nest app, and because of your recent purchases of two Google devices, you have to use the Google Home app. Thank you for sharing with us these important details, such as the distance you are from the camera to set it up, the symptoms the camera is showing, and some of the steps you have taken to set the camera up through your iPhone. I would be more than pleased to help you with this inconvenience, so don't worry.\nBefore we get started with further troubleshooting, let me ask you some important questions:\nHow far is the Nest Cam with floodlights from the router?\nAre you getting any error messages on your Google Home app? If so, please describe it.\nAre there devices or appliances (such as baby monitors, microwaves, cordless phones, etc.) near the device you want to pair?\nCould you please double-check if your Google Nest devices and your iPhone are connected to the same WiFi network?\nIs Bluetooth enabled on your iPhone?\nIs the Nest Cam with floodlights connected to a 2.4 GHz frequency?\nIs the local network enabled for the Google Home app?\nIn case you would need to know how to enable the local network for the Google Home app, here are the instructions:\nFrom your iPhone's settings, enable Local Network for the Google Home app:\nThanks for your kind attention. I will be looking forward to your response.\nBest regards,\nVirna",

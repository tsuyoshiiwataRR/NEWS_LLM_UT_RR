    "text": "With the deal put forward by Amazon on Black Friday, the PS5 Digital with a DualSense controller drops to 374 euros instead of 449 euros. If the console has already been the subject of some discounts in the past, this price drop remains exceptional. At the same time, you can also take advantage of the PS5 Standard with a DualSens controller and Fortnite Cobalt Star benefits at the price of 474 euros instead of 549 euros.\nWhether you pick up either of these PS5s, we recommend you don't wait. The console attracts people in all its versions and the slightest discount has been expected by players since the start of Black Friday. For its part, Amazon has very limited stock: first come, first served, and it is certain that there will not be enough for everyone.\nTo find all the current offers on Amazon, click here:\nGet the PS5 Digital on promo\nBuy the pack with PS5 and controller on sale\nAmazon accompanies the PS5 with several far from negligible services. On the one hand, the video game console is delivered free and quickly, it only takes a few days for the order to reach your home. Of course, you are entitled to the manufacturer's warranty as if you had ordered from the official brand. Finally, please note that you can change your mind until January 31, 2025, in which case the return is free and then the refund is full.\nBy shifting its return deadline in this way, Amazon allows the public to order their Christmas gifts right away, whether it is the famous PS5 or the rest of its catalog. In fact, you benefit from the console at the best price, you offer it at the end of year holidays and you return it quietly in January if it does not suit its recipient, which we highly doubt.\nThe PS5, reference console\nWe no longer present the PS5 as the video game console has been famous since its release, it has established itself as the reference model among gamers. With the current offers on Amazon, two options are available to you, because you can favor the Digital version on the one hand: this one does not include the disc player. If you take this version, you buy the games online electronically. Otherwise, the gaming experience remains exactly the same.\nOtherwise, you can choose the PS5 Slim included in the pack at Amazon. As its name suggests, it is positioned as a slightly thinner model than the basic version, but it is just as competent. This is equipped with aBlu-ray player so you can enjoy your games physically (PS5 or PS4). The model is based on an ultra-high speed SSD drive so that loading times are almost instantaneous for games.\nThe PS5 Slim can boast of offering a high level of realism thanks to the Ray Tracing light rendering technology and compatibility with HDR technology for vivid and dynamic colors. With the video game console, you can even play in 4K with compatible games and displays.\nIn detail, the pack discounted on Amazon includes the PS5 Slim console with a controller, but also 8 in-game cosmetic items (worth around 5,000 V-Bucks) and 1,000 V-Bucks to use in Fortnite. Remember that stocks are ultra limited by Amazon, don't wait to secure the deal of your choice, because this opportunity will not happen again soon.\nTo access discounts on Amazon, click here:\nBuy the PS5 on sale\nBuy the pack with PS5 on sale\n????

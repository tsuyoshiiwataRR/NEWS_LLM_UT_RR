    "text": "A University of Wyoming study reveals that sage grouse populations decline sharply when wild horse numbers surpass federal land capacity.\nChristine Peterson reports for High Country News.\nIn short:\n- Sage grouse nesting and juvenile success drop significantly when horse populations exceed Bureau of Land Management (BLM) thresholds, with nests twice as likely to fail at triple the recommended horse numbers.\n- Horses damage sagebrush habitat and riparian zones critical for sage grouse survival, exacerbating challenges from wildfires, invasive species and industrial development.\n- Tribal efforts to manage horse populations, such as the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho roundups, have shown rapid sage grouse recovery in affected areas.\nKey quote:\n“Overabundant horses simplify habitat and make it less suitable for sage grouse.”\n— Jeffrey Beck, rangeland ecology professor at the University of Wyoming and lead author of the study.\nWhy this matters:\nWild horses evoke cultural pride, but unchecked populations threaten sage grouse, a species already at risk from habitat destruction and climate impacts. Managing these competing priorities is crucial to preserving the region's fragile ecosystems.\nwww.hcn.org",

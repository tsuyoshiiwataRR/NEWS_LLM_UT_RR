    "text": "UNDATED (WKRC/CNN Newsource) - Scientist have identified a mysterious chemical in millions of Americans drinking water that may be harmful to human health. A new study has identified a chemical called chloronitramide anion in the drinking water of millions of Americans, raising potential health concerns. The chemical is a byproduct of chloramine, which is commonly used by public water systems for purification. The study, published Thursday in the journal \"Science,\" reveals that scientists have been aware of this mysterious chemical for over 40 years but only recently identified it due to advancements in analysis techniques. According to the study, approximately 113 million people are exposed to chloronitramide anion through their tap water. While the study authors have not determined whether this byproduct is harmful to human health, they noted that it shares properties with other chemicals that are toxic enough to warrant government regulation. The study authors advised that individuals concerned about their drinking water should consider using a filter.",

    "text": "Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird is reminding Iowans of some tips after nearly 400 incidents of social media account hacks and takeovers were reported in 2024. “Many Iowans spend years building networks and profiles on social media,” Bird said in a news release. “When a scammer takes over, masquerading as these Iowans or sabotaging their hard work, it is easy to feel helpless.” Account takeovers happen when scammers break into a user’s account often by changing passwords or stealing login credentials, according to the news release. Iowa businesses are “particularly” vulnerable to scammers as they rely on social media to promote their products, the news release said. “The good news is we can take action to stop it,” Bird said. “My team is committed to helping Iowans recover their accounts and preventing future takeovers.” Bird shared that a hacker locked an Iowan out of her personal and professional account for the Iowa Hall of Fame and Racing Museum, which was the main way she promoted events for fundraising and sharing announcements. The woman was kept out of her account for nearly a year even though she sought help from Facebook’s customer service. It was only when the woman reached out to the Iowa Attorney General’s Office that she was able to regain control of her accounts, the news release said. In March, Bird called on Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, to address the rise of account takeovers on its social media platforms. The Iowa attorney general’s guide to protecting your social media accounts Use strong and unique passwords: Bird suggests avoiding using any information that can be easily gathered such as birthdays, pet names or common phrases. Two-factor authentication: Using two different forms of identification to access an account adds a layer of protection beyond a single traditional password, Bird said. Be cautious of suspicious links and attachments: Bird warns social media users not to click on links or download attachments from unknown sources that could potentially contain malware. Be mindful of what you share online: Bird suggests avoiding sharing personal information such as a date of birth, home address or financial information on social media. Monitor your account activity: Bird suggests checking your social media account regularly for any unusual activity, such as unauthorized posts or messages. What to do if your social media account is hacked in Iowa Any Iowan experiencing an account takeover or lockout should contact the Iowa Attorney General’s Office at 888-777-4590 or file a report online.

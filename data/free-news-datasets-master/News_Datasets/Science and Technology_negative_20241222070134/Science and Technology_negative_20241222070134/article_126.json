    "text": "By Julia Shapero The Hill ,\n7 hours ago\n( The Hill ) – The Department of Justice (DOJ) is asking a federal judge to order Google to sell off its Chrome browser after the court found the tech giant maintained an illegal monopoly over online search.\nIn a filing late Wednesday night, the DOJ argued Google’s ownership and control of Chrome, as well as Android, stand in the way of its efforts to open up the market and prevent future monopolization.\n“The playing field is not level because of Google’s conduct, and Google’s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,” the agency wrote. “The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.”\nThe DOJ’s proposal would require Google to divest from Chrome and prohibit the search giant from owning another browser for five years. It would also block the company from owning or investing in other potential rivals over the same period.\nAs for Android — which the agency contended offers Google “myriad obvious and not-so-obvious ways to favor its own search products” — the DOJ said it would ask the company to divest from its mobile operating system only if the other remedies are not effective at reining in its monopoly or Google attempts to circumvent them.\nThe remedies also take aim at the exclusive agreements that Google has made with partners, like Apple, to make its search engine the default on their devices. The DOJ’s proposal would prohibit such agreements, which were at the heart of the case.\nGoogle would also be barred from preferencing its search engine through its other products, such as Android, YouTube or its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Gemini.\nKent Walker, Google’s chief legal officer and president of global affairs, described the DOJ’s recommended remedies as a “staggering proposal.”\n“DOJ had a chance to propose remedies related to the issue in this case: search distribution agreements with Apple, Mozilla, smartphone [original equipment manufacturers], and wireless carriers,” Walker wrote in a blog post.\n“Instead, DOJ chose to push a radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America’s global technology leadership,” he added. “DOJ’s wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the Court’s decision. It would break a range of Google products — even beyond Search — that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives.”\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

    "text": "\\nThe H5N1 bird flu virus that recently infected a teenager in British Columbia is apparently a mutated virus strain, increasing its ability to infect humans, according to STAT News . The teen, hospitalized on November 8, was reported to be in critical condition this week. No evidence suggests the virus has spread to others, meaning this mutated strain could die out once the teen recovers. Virologists believe the mutation likely developed during the teen\\u2019s illness, though the infection source remains unknown. A mutation like this highlights the potential danger of H5N1, which could spark a pandemic if it rapidly evolves to spread among people. Currently, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. While H5N1 has caused severe illness and death, the strains circulating in North America have so far resulted in only mild infections.\n\\n Close monitoring: As of November 19, the United States had reported\\xa0 53 confirmed infections \\xa0this year, resulting in mild illness and no hospitalizations. Cattle and poultry are the most common exposure sources, and more than 7,300 people have been monitored after exposure to infected animals. Human cases\\u2014nearly all among farmworkers\\u2014have been confirmed in 7 states so far.\n\\nRead More\n\\n\\n",

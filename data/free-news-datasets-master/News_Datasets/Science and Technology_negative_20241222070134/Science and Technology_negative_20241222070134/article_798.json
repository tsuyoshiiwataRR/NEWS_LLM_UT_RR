    "text": "\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n See full bio \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Avinash Jaisrani \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n At Tech4Gamers, I contribute as a News Reporter, combining my skills and gaming enthusiasm to keep our audience updated on the latest developments.\n\\n \\n See full bio \\n Story Highlight \\n \\n Stalker 2 renders as low as 864p on the Xbox Series X when running in performance mode. \\n The game still fails to get close to its 60FPS target due to CPU limitations. \\n Certain sections can even lead to freezes that last over five seconds on the console. \\n \\n \\nStalker 2 is out globally and has shown promising results on day one. Despite mixed reviews , the game seems to have solid foundations that can be built upon in the future through updates and fixes.\n\\nOne major area that still needs plenty of attention is optimization. As we highlighted in our review , the game does not run the best on PC, but console performance is even worse. According to an analysis, Stalker 2 typically stays well below its 60FPS target on Xbox Series X.\n\\n Why it matters: Many were already concerned about the performance after the minimum system requirements were revealed. It seems these concerns were not misplaced.\n\\n\n\\nDigital Foundry\\u2019s latest testing highlights that Stalker 2 renders between a dynamic 864p-1152p in performance mode on the Xbox Series X. This resolution is then reconstructed to a 4K image, producing a soft image.\n\\nUnfortunately, the sacrifices to image quality don\\u2019t guarantee a consistent 60FPS experience. The analysis shows that Stalker 2 almost always stays within the mid to high 40FPS range, but i t can drop as low as 37FPS in extreme cases.\n\\nAchieving 60FPS is practically impossible except for rare instances within enclosed spaces. This is because Stalker 2 is extremely CPU-limited. The testing shows that the game\\u2019s CPU performance is not the best in general, so more optimization is needed in this department.\n\\nThe Xbox Series X\\u2019s gameplay can\\xa0 even freeze for multiple seconds when entering an intensive area, such as\\xa0a town.\n\\n GSC Game World Is Already Working On Fixes For Its Latest Release \\nOn the other hand, quality mode runs better on the console since it allows for more CPU headroom. Frame-time spikes are not non-existent when the first-person shooter is locked to 30FPS, but they are much improved over the inconsistent spikes noted in the performance mode.\n\\n\\nGoing by the testing, Stalker 2\\u2019s performance is clearly concerning. As one of this year\\u2019s biggest Xbox titles, the title is not doing a great job showcasing this console\\u2019s capabilities.\n\\nFortunately, patches and fixes are on the way and may help alleviate some of the issues with the game\\u2019s CPU-limited nature. What are your thoughts on this performance? Let\\u2019s discuss this in the comments and on the Tech4Gamers Forums .\n\\n",

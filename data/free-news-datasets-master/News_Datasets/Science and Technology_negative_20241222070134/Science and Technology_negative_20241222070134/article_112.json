    "text": "Designing modern AI in a way that makes it appear to have more agency could backfire by making people trust the technology less FROM virtual assistants to self-driving cars to medical imaging analysis, the use of modern artificial intelligence (AI) technologies based on deep-learning architectures has increased dramatically in recent years. But what makes us put our faith in such technologies to, say, get us safely to our destination without running off the road? And why do we perceive some forms of AI to be more trustworthy than others? It may depend on how much agency we believe the technology possesses.

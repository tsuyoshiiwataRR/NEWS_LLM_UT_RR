    "text": "Nikki Sixx Shares Sad News On Mötley Crüe’s Tour Plans\nIn a new tweet on his official X account, Nikki Sixx revealed a sad update on Mötley Crüe’s tour schedule.\n“How are you doing?” a fan asked the bassist in a Q&A session. Sixx replied, “Thank you for asking. Me and Courtney [Sixx] are really busy between all our business’s and our daughter. Nice to be off the road til next year.”\nMötley Crüe announced in September that they would perform shows at The Roxy, Troubadour, and Whisky A Go Go in Los Angeles. The band had three exclusive, intimate club shows at Hollywood’s Sunset Strip on October 7, October 9, and October 11.\nThe three club shows happened after the release of Mötley Crüe’s ‘Cancelled’ EP on October 4. The EP, their first with Big Machine, has three new songs: ‘Dogs Of War,’ ‘Fight For Your Right,’ a cover of the Beastie Boys’ song, and the title track ‘Cancelled.’\nThe band made [a surprise appearance](https://rockcelebrities.net/motley-crue-gets-dumped-back-out-in-a-trash-truck-at-first-night-of-hollywood-takeover/) at the Troubadour on October 8 for their Hollywood Takeover. They shared a video on social media of a trash truck pulling up to the venue and unloading trash, only for the band members to jump out.\nThey captioned the clip, “Mötley Crüe gets dumped back out in a trash truck on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood for night 1 of the HÖLLYWOOD TAKEÖVER!”\nMötley Crüe also reminded fans about a charity auction with instruments used on stage, each signed by the band. The money raised went to Covenant House International.\nThough the Hollywood Takeover was meant to go back to basics, Mötley Crüe still played their usual hit songs at the Troubadour. The 16-song set included classics like ‘Primal Scream,’ ‘Shout at the Devil,’ and ‘Kickstart My Heart,’ along with newer songs like ‘Dogs of War’ and a cover of the Beastie Boys’ ‘Fight For Your Right.’\nMötley Crüe’s deal with Big Machine brings them back together after working on the 2014 album ‘Nashville Outlaws: A Tribute To Mötley Crüe.’ Big Machine also worked with Mötley Crüe’s new guitarist John 5 on his 2021 album ‘Sinner.’ Crüe’s last studio album was ‘Saints Of Los Angeles’ in 2008.\nThank you for asking. Me and\n[@how2girl]are really busy between all our business’s and our daughter. Nice to be off the road til next year.[https://t.co/sUiqNfdCeb]— 📷 (@NikkiSixx)\n[November 21, 2024]",

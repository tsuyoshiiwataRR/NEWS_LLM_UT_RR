    "text": "By Ayeshma Wanninayake\nThere has been a noticeable rise in complaints concerning internet-related crimes, including financial fraud, with a significant involvement of foreign nationals in such activities. This discussion features insights from Dr. Mangala Keerthi de Pasqual, Senior Lecturer at the Department of Mass Communication, University of Kelaniya, focusing on the underlying causes of the increase in cybercrime and the strategies needed to mitigate these offences.\nWhy Cybercrime is on the Rise\nCybercrime encompasses activities such as fraudulent financial transactions, online insults, hate speech, and various forms of deception. One significant factor contributing to the rise in cybercrime in Sri Lanka is the increasing use of the internet. Approximately 12.2 million people, representing 56% of the country’s population, access the internet, with nearly 8 million of them active on social media. While this expanding digital landscape offers numerous benefits, it also brings with it significant risks.\nA significant contributor to the growth of cybercrime in Sri Lanka is the low level of digital literacy among internet users. Many people, especially middle-aged individuals, lack awareness of safe online practices, making them susceptible to scams. The misuse of one-time passwords (OTPs) and a lack of knowledge about mobile applications often lead to financial losses.\nCybercriminals have also exploited the internet to facilitate drug trafficking, arms smuggling, and money laundering. Personal security concerns are rising, particularly for women and children, with cases of explicit images being shared or manipulated and personal photos being misused online.\nWhile institutions like the National Institute of Education are working to incorporate digital literacy into school curricula, the current lack of awareness has created an environment where cybercrime can thrive.\nGlobal Measures to Combat Cybercrime\nCountries like the United States and Australia have made significant strides in combatting cybercrime. In the U.S., organisations such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have established dedicated units to address these issues. The European Union also enforces stringent laws and promotes awareness campaigns to tackle online crimes such as money laundering.\nChina has implemented a comprehensive approach by developing its own social media platforms and maintaining a self-contained digital ecosystem. Strict cybersecurity laws and severe penalties have helped minimise cybercrimes, particularly those targetting women and children.\nIn contrast, many Asian and African countries, including Sri Lanka, lag in addressing these challenges. Reports of Sri Lankans being exploited in cybercrime camps abroad highlight the need for more robust local interventions.\nSri Lanka’s Legal and Institutional Framework\nRecent reports of foreign nationals perpetrating financial fraud in Sri Lanka have drawn attention to the country’s legal framework. Over the past few weeks, nearly 100 individuals, including Chinese nationals, have been arrested for organising financial cybercrimes.\nData from the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) indicates that 232 complaints were reported in September alone. Middle-aged individuals are particularly vulnerable, as they are more likely to fall for pyramid schemes or fraudulent offers due to poor digital literacy.\nThe Government has taken steps to address these issues by establishing a cyber-surveillance unit under the National Child Protection Authority and creating an “Internet Complaints Division” for reporting cybercrimes. The recent Online Safety Bill Act aims to strengthen the legal framework for combatting cybercrime.\nHowever, alongside legal reforms, there is an urgent need to educate the public about safe internet practices, such as protecting confidential information and recognising fake accounts.\nSocial Media and Cybercrime\nSocial media has become a double-edged sword. While it facilitates communication and connectivity, its lack of regulation enables anonymity, making it a fertile ground for fraud and other crimes. Fake accounts are frequently used for financial scams and the distribution of obscene content.\nVictims often include middle-aged individuals, as well as women and children, who are exposed to risks such as photo manipulation, harassment, and hate speech. In some cases, intimate photos are leaked online, causing significant harm to the victims.\nThe rise of social media usage, especially among digital natives born after 2000, underscores the need for proactive measures. While keeping youth and children away from digital platforms is impractical, greater regulation and education are critical to reducing the risks associated with social media.\nVulnerable Groups\nResearch indicates that middle-aged individuals, particularly those aged 40 to 65, are most susceptible to financial fraud. Data from CERT and international studies show that women and children are also at high risk of exploitation and harassment online.\nA recent BBC report highlighted the prevalence of photo manipulation and explicit content sharing, particularly targetting young women. This underscores the need for targetted interventions to protect vulnerable groups.\nBuilding Public Awareness\nRaising public awareness is critical to reducing cybercrime and its harmful impacts. Educating people about safe internet practices and the risks associated with online activities can significantly decrease vulnerabilities. Integrating digital literacy into school curricula, higher education, and public programmes is essential to help individuals navigate the digital world securely. Institutions like the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) and the Police play vital roles in this effort, teaching people how to recognise fake accounts, protect confidential information, and avoid risky behaviours such as sharing one-time passwords (OTPs). Outreach programmes in rural areas, facilitated by local Police and community centres such as temples, can further strengthen awareness efforts. The media also plays a key role in disseminating information through articles, television programmes, and campaigns. Additionally, the National Child Protection Authority has established a WhatsApp No. 077320033, allowing the public to report crimes involving children and other cyber-related incidents. While tools and resources exist, increasing public knowledge of these services and fostering a culture of digital responsibility are essential steps in building a digitally safe and aware society.\nThe Role of Legal Enforcement\nThe enforcement of laws to prevent cybercrime and internet-related offences is essential and must be consistent. The newly -introduced Online Safety Bill includes provisions aimed at addressing such issues. If media freedom is compromised through cyberspace, it is crucial to strengthen laws via legislative action. Cybercrime, internet fraud, and online offences should be effectively tackled through the introduction of new laws and the imposition of stricter penalties. Many countries have successfully curbed these issues by implementing stringent punishments. These crimes can be prevented by combining legal reforms with ongoing efforts to improve digital literacy. Such measures will help reduce risks to children and women, safeguarding them from exploitation and protecting their finances from fraud.\nAbout the Author:\nAyeshma Wanninayake, Communications and Media Unit, University of Kelaniya",

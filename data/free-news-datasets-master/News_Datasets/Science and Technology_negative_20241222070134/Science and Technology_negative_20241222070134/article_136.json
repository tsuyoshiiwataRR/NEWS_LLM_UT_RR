    "text": "The Pixel Tablet was an interesting device, and since its launch, the company has made some changes, such as releasing it without the base. However, Android Authority has learned that there will not be a second-generation Pixel Tablet .\nA recent rumour indicates that Google is ditching its plans for the Pixel Tablet 3 . It looks like Google might completely dismiss a tablet line. However, AA thinks that this rumour was actually referring to the Pixel Tablet 2, not the Pixel Tablet 3. AA suggests that the codename of the Pixel Tablet 2 is, in fact, Kiyomi, which was reportedly the codename for the Pixel Tablet 3.\nThe Pixel Tablet 2 was rumoured to launch next year. It would sport an official keyboard with a touchpad accessory and a Tensor G4 chipset similar to the Pixel 9. The device was expected to launch in 2025 and come in both Bluetooth and 5G models.\nThe Pixel Tablet 3 will sport a Tensor G6 chipset and launch in 2027.\nIt’s sad to see that Google is already giving up on the Pixel Tablet series. It’s possible that we’ll see a Pixel Tablet in 2027, but who knows as that’s so far away.\nSource: Android Authority",

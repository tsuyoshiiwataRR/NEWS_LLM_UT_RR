    "text": "By Grace Eliza Goodwin, 2 hours ago- American Airlines is rolling out tech that calls out passengers who try to board before their turn. - Travelers can expect to see it in action at more than 100 airports this holiday season. - The new tech also gives staff more info on passengers' connections and boarding groups. American Airlines is cracking down on passengers who try to sneak their way into an earlier boarding group. The airline is introducing new technology that helps gate agents catch overeager boarders at more than 100 airports across the country, the company said in a press release Wednesday. When a flyer tries to board their flight in an earlier boarding group than they're assigned, the gate agent's scanner will recognize the incorrect boarding group and notify them with a special two-tone sound. That alerts the agent to tell the passenger to wait their turn — and could also draw unwanted attention to the passenger. Boarding groups are designed to allow passengers with more expensive tickets, US military members, and certain airline status-holders to get on the plane earlier than those who haven't earned or bought these benefits. \"We've heard from our customers that the ability to board with their assigned group is important to them because it's a benefit associated with their AAdvantage status or fare purchase,\" Julie Rath, a senior vice president at the airline, said in the company's press release. American has tested out this new software over the past month at airports in Tucson, Arizona; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Washington, DC. The airline said that because it received a positive response from both customers and team members during this trial period, it decided to roll out the tech in time for the holiday travel season. Flyers can now expect the updates at non-hub airports in cities like Austin, Texas, and Atlanta. The company's hubs — which include airports in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles — will be getting the tech in the coming months, the airline said. While the crackdown may be bad news for boarding group hoppers, it's likely great news for airline workers. Seasoned travelers, flight attendants, and gate staff say that people crowding the gate before boarding begins or trying to jump the boarding line is one of their biggest pet peeves. They even call some of these passengers \"gate lice.\" Business Insider Comments / 2 YOU MAY ALSO LIKE I toured the world's first Airbus A321XLR business class.

They then ‚Äújust sorted from the largest to the smallest and downloaded them‚Äù.\nIntCyberDigest then revealed that the data appeared not to come from Tesla but instead from a firm called Numocity, a manufacturer of EV charging software, middleware, smart charges and more.\nNumocity has yet to publicly acknowledge the incident, as has Tesla or its CEO, Elon Musk.\nLast year, Tesla blamed two former employees for a [data breach that affected 75,000 of its staff](https://www.cyberdaily.au/security/9459-tesla-blames-two-former-staff-for-data-breach-affecting-75k).\nIn a notice filed with the Maine Attorney-General on 18 August 2023 and issued to Tesla staff, the company announced that two ex-employees were to blame for the data breach that occurred in May, resulting in the personal information of 75,735 individuals being compromised.\nThe breach was first outed by Handelsblatt, a German publication, which announced that 100 gigabytes worth of data had been stolen and leaked by a ‚Äúdisgruntled former employee‚Äù who utilised their position as a service technician to access the data.\nHandelsblatt told Tesla that the data included identifiable information, including names, addresses, phone numbers and Social Security numbers. This data included Elon Musk‚Äôs own social security number, according to the publication.\nOther data included private email addresses, employees‚Äô salaries, customer bank details and confidential information regarding Tesla production.",

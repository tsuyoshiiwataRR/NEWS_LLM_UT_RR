    "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Thursday that Russia had deployed a new hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, against Ukraine. This missile, he claimed was capable of reaching speeds ten times faster than sound, struck a military-industrial facility in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Putin claimed that even advanced Western air defence systems in Europe would be powerless against it.“Modern air defense systems that exist in the world and anti-missile defenses created by the Americans in Europe can’t intercept such missiles,” Reuters reported quoting the Russian president. Speaking in a televised address, Putin justified the attack as a response to Ukraine’s use of US and British-supplied missiles to strike Russian territory earlier in the week. He warned that Russia would retaliate “decisively and in kind” against any further strikes, even hinting at targeting NATO nations supplying such weapons.— Tablesalt13 (@Tablesalt13) What is the Oreshnik missile?The Oreshnik is part of Russia’s growing hypersonic arsenal. It is an intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of travelling up to 5,500 kilometres (3,400 miles), carrying either conventional or nuclear warheads. The missile is reportedly based on Russia's RS-26 Rubezh missile model, an experimental system designed for both conventional and nuclear payloads. Putin described it as a response to the US deployment of similar intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Europe.The missile strike on Dnipro carried multiple warheads, making use of a technology known as a Multiple Independently-targetable Reentry Vehicle (MIRV). MIRVs allow a missile to deploy multiple warheads, each targeting different locations, increasing the missile's effectiveness in delivering large-scale damage with a single launch. This marks a significant development, as MIRVs were originally developed for nuclear warheads but were used in this instance with conventional weapons.Video footage of the strike showed multiple fiery trails followed by explosions, suggesting the use of multiple warheads. While Russia’s claims about its military technology often invite scepticism, analysts agreed the missile poses a significant challenge to air defence systems. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the missile’s deployment, calling it “a brutal escalation and a cynical violation of international law.” He urged global leaders to respond firmly to Russia’s actions, warning that failure to act decisively could embolden Putin. Meanwhile, US officials, speaking anonymously, downplayed the long-term significance of the missile, noting that Russia likely has only a limited number of these experimental weapons. However, the attack has heightened concerns about the war’s trajectory, with UK Defence Secretary John Healey describing the situation as “a serious moment” and accusing Russia of escalating attacks on civilian and energy infrastructure. The missile strike comes as the Biden administration approved Ukraine’s use of longer-range Western missiles inside Russia. This decision, criticised by Moscow, coincides with reports of North Korean troops bolstering Russian forces in the conflict zone. Putin has also revised Russia’s nuclear doctrine, allowing for a potential nuclear response to conventional attacks by any country supported by nuclear powers. Despite this, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre dismissed suggestions that the US policy shift could provoke further escalation, maintaining that Russia’s actions were the real source of heightened tensions.",

    "text": "According to a new report, the GeForce RTX 5090 GPU will be very expensive. It is said to be priced at $1,999 in the US. This isn’t the first time that the potential price of NVIDIA ‘s new high-end graphics solution has been leaked, but as the announcement date approaches, which should take place at CES 2025, according to rumors (thanks Notebookcheck ), it is inevitable that the information will multiply.\nPrice Comparison with Previous Generations Damn, the GeForce RTX 5090 will cost ~1900 Dollar.\n— Bits And Chips – Eng (@BitsAndChipsEng) November 18, 2024 If the rumor turns out to be accurate, that would be $300 more than the RTX 4090 was launched at, and it would continue NVIDIA’s trend of significantly increasing prices with each generation. The sources that revealed the price are Chinese and Japanese journalists, who in reality do not completely agree, since they gave two possibilities: $1,899 and $1,999, with the latter prevailing.\nAccording to Bits And Chips, the overclocked version will surpass the $2,000 mark. The Asus TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 4090 OG OC Edition currently costs $1,819.95 on Amazon.\nSpeculation on Hardware Upgrades According to other rumors, Nvidia is about to launch the GeForce RTX 5090 with a GB203 GPU paired with 32GB of GDDR7 VRAM on a 512-bit memory bus. Additionally, Nvidia is said to have adopted a new 12V-2×6 power connector, replacing the 12VHPWR after just one generation. As always, all this information should be taken with a grain of salt, although NVIDIA is known to be somewhat tight-lipped about its upcoming products.",

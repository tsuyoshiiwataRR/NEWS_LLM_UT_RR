    "text": "(WKRC) — The United States Fish and Wildlife Service proposed adding giraffes to the endangered species list due to their declining population.\n\"In response to declining giraffe populations caused by poaching, habitat loss, and climate change, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing federal protections for several giraffe species,\" the agency said in a press release.\nThe agency proposed that multiple giraffe subspecies be put on the endangered species list, including West African, Kordofan, and Nubian giraffes.\nThe agency suggested that four other subspecies, Reticulated, Masai, Angolan, and South African giraffes, should be considered threatened.\n“Federal protections for giraffes will help protect a vulnerable species, foster biodiversity, support ecosystem health, combat wildlife trafficking, and promote sustainable economic practices,” said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Martha Williams.\nThe new protections will reduce illegal hunting and increase conservation funding for giraffes, according to the agency.\nThe population of the three giraffe subspecies that the agency is attempting to place on the endangered list has declined from 25,653 giraffes to 5,919, a 77% decrease according to the agency.\nThe final decision regarding whether or not the animals will be considered endangered will occur on Feb. 19, 2025.",

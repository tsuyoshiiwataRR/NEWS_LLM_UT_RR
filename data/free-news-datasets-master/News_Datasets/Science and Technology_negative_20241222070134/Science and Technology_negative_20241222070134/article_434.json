Xiaomi autos caught in a storm of automatic parking failures, the second model may be launched in the first quarter of next year. 紧急回应！小米汽车陷自动泊车故障风波，第2款车或明年1季度上市 Urgent response! Xiaomi autos caught in a storm of automatic parking failures, the second model may be launched in the first quarter of next year. Securities Times · 20 mins ago XIAOMI-W +1.24% 来源：证券时报\n作者：王小伟\n就在小米SU7交付量目标不断抬升的同时，某些功能故障也在出现。\n小米SU7陷自动泊车功能故障风波 近日，有媒体统计到70多位小米SU7标准版车主在特定时间因自动泊车功能故障， 导致车辆泊车过程中发生剐蹭和碰撞。被统计的车主来自北京、天津等多地，有些车主是在社交平台自曝的故障，为此还专门成立了“小米SU7标准版事故车主群”。有些车主在短视频平台提醒“别用自动泊车了”。\n目前已经有故障车主多次联系小米客服，并将车送到了小米4S店进行数据检测和分析。小米官方对车主表示，愿意承担全部维修费用，并提供积分补偿。\n自动泊车又称智能泊车，驾驶员行驶车辆至车位附近后，开启自动泊车功能，车辆将识别目标车位并自动泊入。\n按照AI给出的判断，自动泊车功能故障的可能原因包括传感器故障、软件错误、电气问题等，解决方法包括检查和清洁传感器、更新软件、检查线路连接等。\n日前，在“小米汽车答网友问”中曾对“小米 SU7 的智驾功能在没有信号的地库还能使用么？还能自动泊车吗？”进行过回答。\n其中表示，小米智能泊车功能跟网络信号无关，即便没有网络信号，小米智能泊车功能依旧可正常使用。小米全系车型均搭载了基于端到端模型的代客泊车辅助功能，可以实现最高23km/h的地下车库巡航。对停车场内车道、障碍物进行精确感知，并实现障碍物绕行、甚至倒车避让。车上搭载的智驾芯片完成全部运算，因此功能的实现并不需要网络信号。\n第二款车型或明年2、3月上市 今年11月13日，雷军在个人微博宣布，第十万台小米SU7正式下线。“一家新车企，第一台车，发布后仅仅230天就下线10万台，这是前所未有的奇迹。”雷军说。\n当天，雷军在个人社交账号发了一张自己躺在车间地板上睡觉的照片并写道：“网友们催我到工厂拧螺丝。其实，我经常去，今天一大早就到了。来得太早，在车间又眯了一会。没想到，一觉醒来，10万台已经搞定！”\n据了解，在小米SU7新车主中，来自豪华车车主的换购比例超过50%，女性用户比例超过40%，苹果用户车主超过半数。\n在日前发布三季报时，小米明确，将全力冲刺2024年全年交付13万辆小米SU7系列新车的新目标。此前，小米SU7全年交付目标还是12万辆。\n更受市场关注的四门跑车小米汽车SU7 Ultra也在紧锣密鼓的推进。其售价81.49万元。\n据小米汽车内部人士透露，小米第二款车型计划于明年2、3月上市。这与雷军此前透露的“小米SU7 Ultra量产版将于2025年3月正式发布”的信息，在时间上有一致性。\n还有消息显示，小米第二款新车的上市安排将与此前SU7上市节奏一致。而SU7的上市时间恰好是2024年3月28日。\n对此，小米集团相关负责人只表示“相关问题已超纲”，他无法作出更多回应。\n不过这一预期点燃了二级市场的投资者热情。截至发稿，今天小米集团股价上涨1.42%。\n编辑/Rocky\nSource: Securities Times.\nAuthor: Wang Xiaowei\nWhile the delivery volume target for the Xiaomi SU7 continues to rise, certain functional malfunctions are also appearing.\nXiaomi SU7 is embroiled in a controversy over automatic parking system malfunctions. Recently, some media outlets have reported that over 70 Xiaomi SU7 standard edition car owners experienced scratches and collisions during parking due to malfunctions in the automatic parking function at specific times. The car owners surveyed come from various places such as Beijing, Tianjin, some of whom have publicly disclosed the malfunctions on social platforms, leading to the establishment of the 'Xiaomi SU7 Standard Edition Accident Car Owners Group.' Some car owners on short video platforms are warning 'not to use automatic parking.'\nCurrently, several car owners with malfunctions have contacted Xiaomi customer service multiple times and have taken their cars to Xiaomi 4S stores for data testing and analysis. Xiaomi officials have expressed willingness to shoulder all repair costs for the car owners and provide point compensation.\nAutomatic parking, also known as smart parking, allows the driver to drive the vehicle near the parking space, activate the automatic parking function, and the vehicle will identify the target parking space and park automatically.\nAccording to AI's determination, possible reasons for the malfunction of the automatic parking function include sensor malfunctions, software errors, electrical issues, with solutions involving checking and cleaning the sensors, updating software, and inspecting circuit connections.\nRecently, Xiaomi's \"Answering Questions from Netizens about Xiaomi Autos\" answered the question about whether the smart driving function of the Xiaomi SU7 can still be used in signal-free underground garages and if it can still automatically park.\nIt is stated that Xiaomi's asia vets parking function is not related to network signal, even without network signal, the Xiaomi asia vets parking function can still be used normally. All Xiaomi models are equipped with a customer parking assistance function based on an end-to-end model, capable of cruising at speeds up to 23km/h in underground garages. It accurately perceives lanes, obstacles in parking lots, and achieves obstacle avoidance and even reverse avoidance. The onboard asia vets chip completes all calculations, so the function does not require a network signal for implementation.\nThe second model is expected to be launched in February or March next year. On November 13th this year, Lei Jun announced on his personal Weibo that the 100,000th Xiaomi SU7 has officially rolled off the production line. \"For a new car company, the first car, after its release, only 230 days to roll off 0.1 million units, this is an unprecedented miracle,\" Lei Jun said.\nOn that day, Lei Jun posted a photo on his personal social account of himself sleeping on the factory floor and wrote: \"Netizens urged me to tighten screws at the factory. In fact, I often go there, and I arrived early this morning. I fell asleep in the workshop for a while because I came too early. Unexpectedly, when I woke up, 0.1 million units were already completed!\"\nIt is understood that among the new Xiaomi SU7 owners, the proportion of luxury car owners for replacement is over 50%, the proportion of female users exceeds 40%, and over half of the users are apple users.\nIn the recent release of the third-quarter report, Xiaomi clarified that it will fully push for a new target of delivering 0.13 million units of the Xiaomi SU7 series new cars in 2024. Previously, the annual delivery target for the Xiaomi SU7 was 0.12 million units.\nThe more market-focused four-door sports car Xiaomi Autos SU7 Ultra is also making rapid progress. Its selling price is 0.8149 million yuan.\nAccording to internal sources at Xiaomi Autos, Xiaomi's second model is planned to be launched in February or March next year. This is consistent with the information previously disclosed by Lei Jun that the \"Xiaomi SU7 Ultra production version will be officially released in March 2025.\"\nThere are also reports indicating that the launch of Xiaomi's second new car will follow the same pace as the previous SU7 launch. The exact launch time for the SU7 happened to be on March 28, 2024.\nIn response, the relevant person in charge at Xiaomi Group only stated that the \"relevant issues are beyond the scope,\" and he could not provide further response.\nHowever, this expectation has ignited enthusiasm among investors in the secondary market. As of the time of writing, Xiaomi Group's stock price has risen by 1.42% today.\nEditor/Rocky\nThe translation is provided by third-party software.\nThe above content is for informational or educational purposes only and does not constitute any investment advice related to Futu.

    "text": "Sir David Attenborough’s AI voice clone – level 3\n22-11-2024 15:00\nSir David Attenborough expressed deep concern over the use of AI technology to mimic his voice, calling it a violation of his identity.\nThe BBC showed him AI-generated clips that closely imitated his voice, leaving him profoundly disturbed. Dr. Jennifer Williams, an expert in AI audio, explained that voice cloning often involves collecting audio data from the internet to create a model of someone’s voice. She highlighted that while some uses might be humorous or creative, others can be harmful, spreading false information using trusted voices. This raises ethical concerns, especially when figures like Sir David, known for credibility, are misrepresented. Without legal safeguards, anyone can create such voice clones. Dr. Williams emphasized raising awareness and using methods like the ‘SIFT’ approach to verify authenticity.\nAs technology advances, the need for regulations to protect against misuse grows critical. Sir David’s reaction reflects the larger debate about trust and responsibility in AI development.\nDifficult words: [mimic](https://www.newsinlevels.com/?s=mimic) (to imitate closely), [credibility](https://www.newsinlevels.com/?s=credibility) (the quality of being trusted and believed in), [misuse](https://www.newsinlevels.com/?s=misuse) (the wrong or improper use of something).\nYou can watch the video news lower on this page.\nWhat are the potential harmful uses of voice cloning technology as highlighted by Dr. Jennifer Williams, and why does it raise ethical concerns, particularly with figures like Sir David Attenborough?\nLEARN 3000 WORDS with NEWS IN LEVELS\nNews in Levels is designed to teach you 3000 words in English.

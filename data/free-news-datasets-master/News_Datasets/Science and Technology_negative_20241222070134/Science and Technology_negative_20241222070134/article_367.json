Her belief in a digital connection with Elon Musk unraveled into a costly scam.\nAn [Elon Musk](/latest/elon-musk) impersonator was arrested on suspicion of [stealing $600,000 from a woman](/news/us-news/155539/elon-musk-impersonator-arrested-stealing-600000-facebook) that he met on [Facebook](/latest/facebook), according to [police](/latest/police).\nThe woman genuinely thought that the person she was talking to was the honest Musk, [but it turned out to be Jeffery Moynihan, 56.](/news/us-news/155539/elon-musk-impersonator-arrested-stealing-600000-facebook)\nThe real Elon Musk recently [helped Alex Jones to try and save Jones's \"Infowars.\"](/news/us-news/155057/alex-jones-inforwars-elon-musk-the-onion-trump)\n[Megarocket launches for sixth time from SpaceX's Starbase in Texas](/news/space-news/155135/spacex-launch-starbase-texas-november)[Trump appoints SpaceX champion to cabinet as Musk clashes with team over picks](/news/politics/155111/trump-appoints-spacex-champion-to)\n\"She really thought she was friends with him, and she’d communicate with him on a daily basis with him,\" Detective Jim Curulla of the Bradenton Police Department’s Elder Fraud Unit told Fox News.\nThe Bradenton Police Department revealed that Moynihan sent messages to a 74-year-old woman for months, dating back to last year.\nThe suspect promised a $55 million return on investment if she bought shares of Musk's businesses to get the victim to part with her money.\nThe woman only managed to send $250,000 to accounts she thought were Musk's but were owned by Moyinhan or his businesses.\n\"What and who you see is not who is typing back to you. I think these people, you have to realize that, but even more so, you can’t give money.

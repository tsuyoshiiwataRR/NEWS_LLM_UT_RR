    "text": "Many reports and rumours predicted that Google had scrapped its tablet category and suggested that the company may have already dropped the idea of a future tablet release. Google had initially planned to release the Pixel Tablet 2 in 2025, and a third-generation variant was in its early stages of development with a scheduled release for 2027. However, a new report suggests the tech giant might have scrapped plans for the long-awaited Pixel Tablet 2, not the Pixel Tablet 3 for now. Google Pixel Tablet 3 could be in the works According to a new report by Android Authority, citing unknown sources, credible Android expert Mishaal Rahman found out that 'Kiyomi,' the codename for the canceled Pixel Tablet, actually refers to the Pixel Tablet 2 and not the Pixel Tablet 3. Therefore, the Pixel Tablet 3, which is planned to be released in 2026 or 2027 after the Pixel 11 series launch, still very well be a possibility. Moreover, the purported Pixel Tablet 3 model is reported to be powered by the upcoming Tensor G6 processor, with lower clock speeds. Rahman has speculated that Google wasn't convinced about the direction heading with the Pixel Tablet 2 and the project eventually has been scrapped. However, with the Pixel Tablet 3, Google could provide further advanced specs and features that align more closely with its long-term tablet strategy. It is also expected to come with a DisplayPort output with the USB 3.2 standard, making it easy for users to transport the on-screen content to a bigger display.\",",

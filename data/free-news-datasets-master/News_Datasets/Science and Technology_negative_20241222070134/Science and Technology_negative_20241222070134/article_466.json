    "text": "AAP FACTCHECK – Scammers are using artificial intelligence (AI) to create fake videos of Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to lure people into parting with their money.\nThe videos use real footage of Mr Albanese, but deploy AI voice impersonation technology and video manipulation techniques to lip-sync fake audio so it sounds as though the PM is spruiking purported investment schemes.\nA recent Facebook post features a video showing Mr Albanese at a podium announcing “a new project to allow you to earn passive income”.\n“This isn’t just another scam project you may have come across,” the video says.\n“You know I care about the residents of our country and strive to create comfortable conditions for everyone.\n“This is an official platform. It was created to strengthen Australia’s economy, help ordinary people solve their problems and change their lives.”\n Mr Albanese doesn’t speak with the American twang heard in the fake audio. The faked voice goes on to promise a guaranteed $25,000 return for those who make a minimum $400 deposit to the scheme.\nThe video includes the caption: “HERE’S A PROGRAM AVAILABLE FOR EVERYONE NOW INVEST 400 AND START EARNING. START EARNING 40,000 A MONTH TODAY.”\nThe end of the video directs viewers to click on a link, which goes to what appears to be an investment website.\nThe video is taken from footage of a press conference Mr Albanese held on November 3, at which he announced a new policy to extend free technical and further education (TAFE) courses.\nThe speech transcript shows Mr Albanese does not promote any investment scheme.\n The only people likely to get rich out of these investment schemes are the scammers. The manipulated video contains red flags previously mentioned to AAP FactCheck by an AI expert, particularly Mr Albanese’s odd mouth movements, which do not match the audio.\nWhile the audio sounds like the prime minister in places, at times the accent in the audio has a distinctly American twang that doesn’t match the Sydneysider’s voice.\nThe post’s accompanying link goes to a clone of the website of Australian managed fund business One Investment Group , but with a different URL.\nAAP FactCheck has previously debunked another video of Mr Albanese supposedly promoting a similar investment scheme.\nIt has also debunked a number of Facebook videos promoting false money-making schemes using AI deepfakes of business people , news organisations , journalists , mining magnate Gina Rinehart and other high-profile Australians .\n Gina Rinehart has also been used in AI deepfakes promoting scam schemes. HOW TO SPOT A SCAM POST ON FACEBOOK – THE RED FLAGS Treat posts appealing for help to find lost or found people or pets, or offering extremely cheap or free products and services, with caution if they include more than one of the following features:\n* The person encourages everyone to share their post widely.\n* They don’t provide their contact details or they ask people to send them a DM or PM (direct message or private message).\n* The post includes only very vague details about the location of the person or pet, or the giveaway.\n* The account of the person posting is less than a year old, has no profile picture, has very few friends, or isn’t located in the same area as the subject of their post. This indicates the account is fake.\n* You can’t comment on the post because comments are disabled. This is done to prevent people warning others it’s a scam.\nThe Verdict False – The claim is inaccurate.\nAAP FactCheck is an accredited member of the International Fact-Checking Network .

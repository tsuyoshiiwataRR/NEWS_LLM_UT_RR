    "text": "AI PCs arenâ€™t yet living up to their full potential for users owing to inadequate AI education, a new study from Intel has revealed.\nIntel found that users who own an AI PC , devices containing dedicated AI hardware like a neural processing unit (NPU) spend longer on computer-based chores than those with regular desktop PCs or laptops .\nThese chores were identified by the firm as tasks such as coding or analyzing data , with the delays credited in part to the time users had to spend learning how best to communicate with AI tools.\nIntel said this points to the persistent need for better AI skills , including training on AI implementation and usage.\nIntel found that consumers who own an AI PC spend longer on computer-based chores, identified by the firm as tasks such as coding or analyzing data, than those with regular desktop PCs or laptops . This was in part due to time users had to spend learning how best to communicate with AI tools.\nIntel said this points to the persistent need for better AI skills , including training on AI implementation and usage.\nThe report found that 86% of respondents had never heard of or used an AI PC, and negative conceptions of AI PCs were prevalent among those surveyed.",

Connect.\nyesterday\nHi\nNew installation of Fibre 900 today with two Eero Pro 6 boxes.\nAll set up and working, speed from the main box is great, getting 938 Mbps download and 108 Mbps upload according to the apps speed test.\nHowever the wifi is a different story altogether. Using my iPhone 16 Pro, if I stand next to the main router I get approx 590ish, as I walk away from it, it just keeps dropping until its getting around 100-150ish.\nI have the other Eero box upstairs in the closest available space, quite open, just a couple of walls between the main Eero router. (New build house, walls are not very thick)\nEven upstairs, standing next to the second Eero the speed is about 160. If I plug my PC into the second box I get speeds of about 550 Mbps.\nI've updated both to the latest software as notified in the app.\nVery disappointed with it, would appreciate any help!\n34 minutes ago\nMorning,\nCan you please update your community profile to include your:\nWe'll then look into this further. Please do not post this information on this thread. Once you've updated your profile please post in your topic to confirm it's updated.\nThanks\nMichelle\nyesterday\nJust to add to this, I've just been reading about others who have had very similar issues that were caused by the 5ghz channels being too high for devices. Both my 5ghz channels are 42 & 155.",

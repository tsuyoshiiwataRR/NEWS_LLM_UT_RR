    "text": "Microsoft has issued a warning to Windows 10 users, notifying them that free security updates will end in October 2025. With nearly 400 million devices unable to upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations, users face a choice: upgrade their systems or pay $30 for a one-year extension of support.\nOlder PCs without TPM compliance are particularly affected, raising concerns over affordability for some users. Environmental advocates warn the end of Windows 10 support could lead to a surge in electronic waste, as obsolete computers flood landfills. While some predict discounts on new PCs in 2025, the move highlights the challenges of balancing security, sustainability, and affordability in tech transitions.\nUsers are advised to explore options early to maintain secure systems as support phases out.\nGet the latest headlines delivered to your inbox each morning.

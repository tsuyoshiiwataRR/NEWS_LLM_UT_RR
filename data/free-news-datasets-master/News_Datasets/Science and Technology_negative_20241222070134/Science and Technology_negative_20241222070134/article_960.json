That’s interesting.\nFirst thing: its not it’s\nLazy fake planet\nIt was the runt of the litter and didn’t survive full planet hood.\nMarked on my calendar, see you all there!\nWill it or won’t it be a planet by then?\nWe will call it a planet if we plan it.\nSo please don’t tell me to can it\nI’ve got one thing to say and that’s\ndepends on how you define “planet”.\nSince it is discovery\nits ಠ_ಠ\nYou mean to tell me it hasn’t even been a year (on Pluto) since we discovered Pluto?!\nIt was discovered, made a planet, and then kicked out the club in that time.\nIf you think 2020 was bad, wait until you hear about Pluto’s year… the American civil war, ww1, ww2, the great depression, the moon landing… the American civil war…\nBut none of those things happened on the planet\nIt’s been a really rough year for Pluto. Let’s all wish it good luck next year (when humans are probably dead).\ndeleted by creator\ndeleted by creator\nAlright, setting a reminder\nFine I’ll look it up. Discovered 1930, so that makes a Pluto year 248 Earth years.\nPluto Party Time!\nHow much longer? I\"ve got my costume ready and everything…!remind_me 1868 months\nHow can we even know it’s a planet when we haven’t observed a single orbit, yet?\nMaybe it’s just a really big comet.It’s not really big. There are multiple Pluto like planetoids. Also there is a hunk of rock in the asteroid belt youcould name a planet.\nBy measuring how fast it’s moving and where it is you can find the orbit\nWe’ve observed enough of its orbit to know what shape it is.\nHow can you be so sure it doesn’t just decide to leave\nAnd who could blame it?\nHopefully the AI Contruct that we will create will be able to witness it.\nBecause I don’t think humans are surviving that long.\nI might end up missing that, too‽ Goddammit!",

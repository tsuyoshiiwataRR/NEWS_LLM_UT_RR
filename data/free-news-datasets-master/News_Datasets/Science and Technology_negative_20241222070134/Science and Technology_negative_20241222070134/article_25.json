    "text": "The measures presented by the Department of Justice are part of a landmark case in Washington which has the potential to reshape how users find information. Send this page to someone via email\nThe United States Department of Justice on Wednesday argued in court that Google must sell Chrome, its flagship browser, to break what officials say amounts to a monopoly on online searches.\nExperts say the sale of a browser used by millions could have far-reaching impacts on the way people use the internet, and even help reshape what browsers of the future might look like.\nThe proposed measures would be in place for up to a decade, enforced via a court-appointed committee to remedy what the judge overseeing the case deemed an illegal monopoly in search and related advertising in the U.S., where Google processes 90 per cent of searches.\nCarmi Levy, a technology analyst, said if Google is forced to sell Chrome, the implications could be \"seismic\" and lead to uncertainty.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\"This could be the industry's next Y2K if it comes to pass because so many workflows, so many apps, so many services rely on Chrome as a foundation. And if Google is no longer in position to maintain Chrome as that foundation, the entire industry is going to have to pivot,\" he said.\nLevy said any potential buyers would have to have \"deep pockets\" to maintain a global resource such as Chrome.\n\"It can't be a small tech startup. They have to have very deep engineering capabilities and that means it's a very short list. Frankly, I think Microsoft is at the top of that list.\"\nLevy said it might be some time before users notice a difference.\n\"In the short term, nothing changes,\" Levy added. \"But longer term, it's difficult to see where that's going to go,\" he said, adding that the user experience of the browser could change depending who buys the browser and how they treat your private data.\n2:11 Business Matters: Google granted 5-year exemption from Canada's Online News Act\nWill your smartphone look different?\nThe DOJ's proposals include ending exclusive agreements in which Google pays billions of dollars annually toâ€¦\nUday Rana",

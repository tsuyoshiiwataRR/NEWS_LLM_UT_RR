    "text": "We all know this is the worst football game EA has ever made in terms of the gameplay and the number of players stopping playing is proving that at record speed, but you could fix it soooo easily.\n1. REBOUNDS, REBOUNDS, REBOUNDS. Sometimes a lucky rebound goal is fine, it happens, but this is happening 20+ times a game. First it's impossible to get the ball off your opponent as you tackle then it rebounds back to them way too frequently, secondly, terrible shot at keeper = rebound = goal, happens almost every game.\n2. AI Defending. I've just played x4 games in a row of UT Div 2, and EVERYONE is AI Defending. They don't bother controlling the nearest player to the ball when defending, they just let the AI do it then they switch to the player last minute to make a tackle if you get too close, while they run around with an attacking player to defend aimlessly as they know the AI will do all the appropriate defending for them. What SHOULD happen is that your forced to use the closest defending player to the player with the ball. It's s effing boring, i want to play against another human, not AI every time im attacking.\nFix these two things and we're back...",

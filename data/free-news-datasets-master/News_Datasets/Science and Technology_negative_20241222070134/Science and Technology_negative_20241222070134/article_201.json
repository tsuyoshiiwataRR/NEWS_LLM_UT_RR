Technical indicators suggest alternative cryptocurrencies could see significant gains following Bitcoin’s correction periods .\nEthereum ETH/USD is trading at $3,324, up 7.71%, in the last 24 hours, while Solana SOL/USD reached $254.05, gaining 6.79%.\nBitcoin is currently trading at $98,407, up 3.65% in the last 24 hours.\nRead Next:\nNovember Small-Cap Surge Could Carry Into December’s Santa Rally, Historical Trends Suggest Image Via Pixabay\nDisclaimer : This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs © 2024 Benzinga.com.

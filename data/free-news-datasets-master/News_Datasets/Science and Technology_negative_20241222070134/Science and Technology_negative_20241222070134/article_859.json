    "text": "Produced by: Mohsin Shaikh Giraffes are set to join the endangered species list as their population plummets. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposes protections under the Endangered Species Act to curb their decline. For the first time, giraffes may receive formal protection, with restrictions on importing products like rugs, jewelry, and shoes made from their remains. These measures aim to fight poaching and wildlife trafficking. Giraffe numbers have dropped from 150,000 in 1985 to just 98,000 by 2015. Habitat loss, urbanization, poaching, and climate-induced drought are driving this alarming decline. “The U.S. decision supports giraffe conservation and ensures we do not contribute further to their decline,” said Martha Williams, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director. The U.S., a major market for giraffe products, could significantly reduce global demand with stricter trade limitations, aiding the species’ survival worldwide. Years of activism led to this proposal. Environmental groups like the NRDC and Center for Biological Diversity pushed for action, even filing a lawsuit in 2021 to force the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to act. The seven-year delay in protecting giraffes underscores a larger crisis, with millions of species at risk. Advocates stress the need for urgent measures to save biodiversity. The proposal includes new funding for giraffe conservation efforts in African nations, emphasizing global collaboration to protect these iconic animals. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is inviting public feedback on the proposal until February 19, with plans to finalize protections by the year’s end. Your voice could help save the giraffes.",

    "text": "Product : The Sims 4\nPlatform : PC\nWhich language are you playing the game in? English\nHow often does the bug occur? Every time (100%)\nWhat is your current game version number? 1.110.311.1020 DX9\nWhat expansions, game packs, and stuff packs do you have installed? Growing together, parenthood, book nook, university, greenhouse, blooming rooms, seasons, cats and dogs, horse ranch, cottage living, get to work, vampires, werewolves, outdoor retreat, dream house decorator, my wedding stories\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? By using 2 showers: the new horse ranch shower and university shower\nWhat happens when the bug occurs? When I use the 'barrelwood shower' and 'EZPZ shower stall', the objects do not appear but when you click on them there is an outline. They are fully functional just not visible. But then when you move the shower outside in the open, the shower is visible. But in the house or a room it isn’t.\nWhat do you expect to see? The objects inside\nHave you installed any customization with the game, e.g. Custom Content or Mods? Not now. I've removed them.\nDid this issue appear after a specific patch or change you made to your system? Neutral/Not Sure\n‌\nShowers appear invisible in house but visible outside.",

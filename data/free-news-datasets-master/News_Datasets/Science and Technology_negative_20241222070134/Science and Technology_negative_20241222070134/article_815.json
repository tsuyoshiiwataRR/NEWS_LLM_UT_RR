Ensuring your copy of the latest Call of Duty game runs without issue is key to avoid any kind of unwanted stuttering during the heat of battle. In Warzone, the arrival of the innovative Omnimovement system means your reaction times are more important than ever when it comes to outplaying the opposition.\nWhile the Season 1 update introduced a wealth of content, including the meta-shifting Krig C assault rifle, the latest update has massively affected players on Steam. For some reason, this version of the game’s PC port has been ravaged by awful performance, making it the worst place to load into the action.\nWarzone on Steam is the worst way to play Battle royale fans dropping into Urzikstan, Area 99, and Rebirth Island using Valve’s platform have noticed their frame rate is significantly worse than those playing matches on Nattle.net and the Xbox PC app much to their annoyance.\nFrame rate often determines how smooth your game looks. The higher the number, the smoother it is. Steam users are reporting they’re struggling to reach 80 frames per second while those on other platforms are managing to reach anywhere between 100 and 200, potentially giving them a significant advantage on their quests to become the last one standing in the final circle.\nPlayers have noticed that the performance of Call of Duty: Warzone on Steam is worse than that of Battle net and Xbox PC app after Season 01 launch.\nMany are reporting that Bnet and Xbox app is giving 100-200FPS+ compared to the Steam version, with some seeing <80FPS on Steam. pic.twitter.com/kCiQrrqwTF\n— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) November 21, 2024 Many cite the launch of the first seasonal update as the root cause of the lower Steam frame rates. Another theory that could cause a significant drop in performance is Valve adding a recording feature to the platform. While running alongside other capture software such as NVIDIA Instant Replay, it could result in huge frame drops when compared to Blizzard’s and Microsoft’s dedicated platforms.\nWill it get fixed? The Black Ops 6 integration into Warzone hasn’t gone well. Rebirth Island was removed just hours after launch due to “map-specific” issues while Raven Software has already had to apply movement changes to enhance the battle royale’s fluidity. Despite the flaws, it’s hugely positive to see the developer being proactive to rectify any problems.\nSteam’s sluggish frame rate is another addition to the ever-growing list. Considering the speed Raven Software is working at to address the game-breaking glitches, there’s a possibility Warzone will be optimised further in a future update. If not, make sure any capture software isn’t hogging any hardware power while on the battlefield.\nBefore you attempt to score that next win, take a look at when the next double XP weekend is taking place within battle royale, Resurgence, and Plunder modes.\nAbout the Author Jon Nicholson\nJon is a Freelance Writer for VideoGamer.

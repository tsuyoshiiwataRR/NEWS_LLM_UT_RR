    "text": "MIAMI, Fla. — A Florida resident has filed a lawsuit against Netflix, alleging widespread buffering and streaming failures during the highly anticipated fight between former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul last Friday night.\nRonald “Blue” Dalton submitted the complaint on Monday, just days after Paul, 27, defeated the 58-year-old Tyson by unanimous decision in an eight-round exhibition bout. The event, marketed as a blockbuster clash, left many viewers frustrated when technical glitches disrupted the streaming experience.\nThe lawsuit accuses Netflix of mishandling the digital distribution of the fight, which reportedly attracted record-breaking viewership numbers. “The most hyped fight in boxing history turned out to be a ‘record night,’ not for the fight(s) but for the money Netflix stole,” the complaint states.\nNakisa Bidarian, Paul’s copromoter and cofounder of Most Valuable Promotions, acknowledged the streaming issues but framed them as a testament to the event’s popularity. “I think, first and foremost, we broke the internet,” Bidarian said, highlighting the unprecedented demand, which reportedly surpassed the U.S. streaming record of 23 million concurrent viewers.\nNetflix admitted to facing “many technical challenges” during the event but claimed its efforts to manage the stream were “brilliant,” according to the lawsuit. However, Dalton’s complaint cites over 100,000 online complaints from frustrated viewers who experienced buffering, glitches, or total inaccessibility during the fight.\nThe event, which was also distributed to over 6,000 bars and restaurants nationwide, is being touted as the largest digital distribution for combat sports. The lawsuit adds to mounting criticism of Netflix’s ability to handle live events.\nStreaming woes during a blockbuster bout have landed Netflix in legal trouble, with frustrated viewers demanding accountability.",

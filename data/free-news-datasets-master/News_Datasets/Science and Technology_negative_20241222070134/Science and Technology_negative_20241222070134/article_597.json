    "text": "Windstream had a subcontractor doing some work for them back in the middle of October, and a line was cut. From that point, those of us without internet service were told a literal smorgasbord of reasons the net was not working, along with even more deadlines as to when it would be repaired.\nReasons for no service were:\n Storm damage. We were done with the storm and had service after the storm.\n A Hub. They told us a hub wasn’t working. They never got into detail.\n A Cut line. This was actually true. But their sub said they were not going to repair it because Windstream didn’t mark it. Windstream said they were not where they were supposed to be and a pissing match broke out.\n We went just over a month without internet service.\nI started calling once a day and listening to someone tell me what was wrong and giving me a deadline. None of the deadlines were met.\nThen I started used “Go Kinetic by Windstream” and saving the text.\n“I see you are using the Go Kinetic app for this chat, and we thank you for that.”\nThat’s what they said at the beginning of each conversation, so I started my conversations by saying it first. This confused the hell out of the men and women in the chat. Most froze up for a few seconds and only one got snarky about it. “Yes, you are welcome, you are funny person.”\nIsrah, the first person I spoke to who told me she had no idea what was going on in Brooks County, but could only tell me what she had been told, was more honest about how little she knew than most. She said she was told to just keep pushing the deadline forward.\nTo really get their attention, I started a rumor within one of those insidious “Word of Mouth” groups on FB. I told people one of the service techs told me it would be January of 2025 before we got service again.\nThe bad news was it was deep into November before we got service back and I was beginning to wonder if I wasn’t right.\nIf you get right down to what happened and why, it was a cut cable. But the reality of not having the internet was I missed music more than anything else. One of the women in my writer’s group was a first class opera singer, and it’s odd listening to a piece of music where you’ve met the singer in person. She was good, not just good, but damn good.\nThen there are all the updates to music I’m following where I could get an email or a notification but streaming was out of the question, even with a hotspot. We live out in the boonies for real.\nI missed writing to music. I missed listening to music at night and doing nothing else. I missed waking up to music. I missed the music I listen to frequently, old favorites, and songs I still sing that I heard first in high school.\nUsually, when I’m home, I’ll get a playlist going that will last for hours. I have a Pink Floyd playlist with seven albums on it. I have a playlist with just songs I like on it that would last three days if I listened to it all the way through.\nStreaming music is a lot different than the way I learned to listen to music and I love it. Hours and hours of time spent working out, writing, chilling or doing yardwork and never having to mess with the music at all. It’s always there. Until a cable gets cut.\nTake Care,\nMike\nMike writes regularly at his site: The Hickory Head Hermit .\nOpinions expressed in this article are not necessarily those of the management of this site.",

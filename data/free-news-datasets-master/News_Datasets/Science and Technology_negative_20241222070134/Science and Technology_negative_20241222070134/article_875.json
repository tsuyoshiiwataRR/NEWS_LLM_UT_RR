    "text": "MSFS 2024 Devs Are Working Around The Clock, but It's Still Not Enough. Server Problems Continue to Give Players Hard Time\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024 looks beautiful - when it doesn't have the server problems that continue to plague the Asobo studio's game 3 days after its release.\nUpdate (November 22, 1:36 a.m.)\nAnother day, [another announcement from the devs of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024](https://x.com/MSFSofficial/status/1859692521707671589). Unfortunately, once again it cannot be considered positive:\nWe continue to see access and bandwidth issues as more users come online globally. We're actively working on increased capacity fixes. We want to express our gratitude to the community and apologize for this frustrating experience. We'll share ongoing updates across our channels, wrote Jorg Neumann, head of the team responsible for MSFS 2024.\nMeanwhile, [fewer and fewer people are playing](https://steamdb.info/app/2537590/charts/) on Steam, although the game's reception is improving slightly - [currently 29% of player reviews are positive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/).\nOriginal news (November 21, 00:29 a.m.)\nThe release of the \"most complex flight simulator in history\" hasn't yet proven to be a historic success for the Asobo studio series. After allegedly dealing with the launch problems, the developers of [Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024](https://www.gamepressure.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/z166b3) reported further problems with accessing the game. They already increased server performance but [admitted that this isn't how the release of the new MSFS should look like](https://x.com/MSFSofficial/status/1859397025508262094).\nNot all players are experiencing problems and - interestingly - it doesn't seem to be related to the bandwidth of their internet connections (at least judging by the comments on social media). Nevertheless, the disappointment with MSFS 2024 is widespread. Just take a look at the reviews on Steam â€“ [currently, only 24% of user reviews are positive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/).\nThere is also no need to look far for the reasons for players' irritation. Fans had concerns from the beginning about the decision to use data streaming, but the technical alpha from last month didn't foreshadow the problems.\nThere is one main complaint: problems with accessing the game and loading objects. Due to server problems, starting the game can be difficult, and during gameplay, the title sometimes fails to load high-quality textures and [models](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gvwai1/hmmm_expectation_vs_reality/), [including planes](https://x.com/Jackaluk1/status/1859411282975481872). As a result, a game that was supposed to take MSFS's visuals to the next level ends up looking too often like [a title from almost 30 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gvtykp/msfs_2024_after_24_hours). Or, [as malicious internet users claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gvt04e/my_contribution_to_this_absurd_situation/), [Minecraft](https://www.gamepressure.com/games/minecraft/zd652) ([and this isn't just a joke](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1gvkhry/msfs_2024_is_awesome/)).\nNot all players encounter such issues, and when Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 works as it should, it can truly impress with its visuals. However, excessively long loading times for the game (reportedly exceeding 6 hours according to internet users), glitches, and crashes are ruining the enjoyment for fans of the latest flight simulator, even 2 days after its release.\nThese access and gameplay issues are likely the reason why the number of people playing MSFS 2024 on Steam [is decreasing](https://steamdb.info/app/2537590/charts/). Of course, data from just 2 days should be viewed critically, especially due to gameplay issues and the fact that the title is also available on Game Pass. However, at this moment, a clear downward trend is visible.",

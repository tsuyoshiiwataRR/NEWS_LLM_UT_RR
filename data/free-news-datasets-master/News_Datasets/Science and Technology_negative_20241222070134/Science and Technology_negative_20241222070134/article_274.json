    "text": "Representational image\nAlathur (Kerala): Motorists who violated traffic rules under the assumption that AI cameras were non-functional due to a pause in fine challan issuance will now face hefty penalties. Keltron, the agency responsible for sending challans, has[ resumed operations ](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/kerala/keralas-ai-traffic-cameras-back-on-fines-for-violations-start-rolling-in-1.10097061)after receiving overdue payments from the state government.\nIt is estimated that fines amounting to ₹500 crore are pending collection from approximately 80 lakh offenders. Initially controversial, the AI cameras installed on roads are now proving effective in curbing traffic violations while boosting government revenue.\nIn July 2023, the state installed 732 AI cameras on Public Works Department roads at a cost of ₹232 crore. Keltron was tasked with issuing challans for recorded violations and was to receive ₹11.6 crore every three months from the Finance Department. Delays in payments disrupted operations. However, with the clearance of arrears, Keltron has resumed its duties. Only the payment for September remains pending.\nSince July 2023, over 80 lakh traffic violations have been recorded by these AI cameras across the state. Initially, a few challans were sent. However, many offenders repeated violations, believing rumours that the cameras were non-functional. These individuals now face huge fines.\nMotorists are advised to check for any pending fines in advance by visiting the M Parivahan website and entering their vehicle registration number. Repeated breaches of traffic laws could lead to severe financial penalties.",

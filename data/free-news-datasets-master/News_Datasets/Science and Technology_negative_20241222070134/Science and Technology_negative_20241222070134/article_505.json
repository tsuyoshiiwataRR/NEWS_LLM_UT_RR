    "text": "[Tech News](https://www.news9live.com/technology/tech-news)\nBeware! Fake AI Video Tools Target Windows And Mac Users To Steal Personal Data\nThis fake AI video generating tool can steal sensitive information such as passwords, login details, browsing history of Mozilla, Chrome and others on Windows and Mac devices. Here is how to keep yourself safe.\nWith the advancement of technology and AI these days, the popularity amongst netizens is also growing. However, the growing popularity is presenting an opportunity for cybercriminals to exploit the excited users. If you are one of those who always be excited to try new AI tools to create images or videos, then you must know that fake AI video-generating tools are on the rise!\nAs per a Bleeping Computer report, the fake AI video generators, which promise to offer free and simple video creation with the help of AI, are tricking users into downloading malware on their Windows and macOS devices to steal personal and sensitive information such as passwords, browsing history, wallets, and more.\nHow Fake AI Tools Trick Users\nScammers are taking advantage of the opportunity of rising demand for AI tools. Hackers use fake websites that look like legitimate AI video generators, appearing ads and search results on social media and search results. Once a user clicks on the ad, it takes you to a website which looks professional and trustworthy with the help of familiar elements like cookie banners, making it hard to tell if they’re fake or real. But as soon as you click the Download button, the trouble begins!\nThe malicious app secretly installs malware on your device. For Windows, the file is called “Edit-ProAI-Setup-newest_release.exe,” and for macOS, it’s named “EditProAi_v.4.36.dmg,” the report suggested. This malware includes two types of information-stealers: Lumma Stealer for Windows and AMOS for macOS.\nOnce the malware is installed on your device, it can steal sensitive information without your knowledge. From login credentials, passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, and other history saved in browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge can be compromised. What do hackers do with this information? They gather it in a file and send it back to their server to further use it to steal money, break into other accounts, or sell it to other cybercriminals.\nWhat Should You Do?\nIf you’ve downloaded one of these fake AI tools, it’s important to act quickly. First, change the passwords for all your online accounts, especially for banking, email, and cryptocurrency sites. The malware could have stolen your login credentials, so assume your accounts are at risk. Another important thing that you need to do is to enable “multi-factor authentication (MFA)” on all accounts to add an extra layer of security.\nApart from this, it is also crucial to be safe in future from such scams or fake apps. Hence, it is important to keep these points in mind:\n- Before downloading anything, make sure that the website is legitimate while checking for its reviews, and details, and it has a secure connection such as HTTPS.\n- Do not download from third-party apps. Always stick to the trusted sources. Some random pop-up ads? NEVER download from them.\nClick for more latest [Tech news](https://www.news9live.com/technology/tech-news).

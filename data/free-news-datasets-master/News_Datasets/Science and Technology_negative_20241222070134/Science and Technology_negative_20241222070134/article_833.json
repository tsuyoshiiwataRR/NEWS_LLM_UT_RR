    "text": "International Game Technology (IGT) is one of the world’s biggest developers of slot machines, and it’s now the latest gambling company to fall victim to a cyberattack.\nThe gaming supplier revealed the November 17 breach in an SEC filing, explaining how an unauthorized third party accessed certain systems, disrupting internal operations. No group has taken credit for the attack yet.\nquickly implemented its cyberattack response plan\nIGT said it quickly implemented its cyberattack response plan after uncovering the hack, with external advisors helping to conduct an internal investigation to determine the impact. Some systems remain offline until it’s safe to bring them back.\nIGT is currently [merging its global gaming divisions with gaming technology company Everi](https://www.vegasslotsonline.com/news/2024/07/26/apollo-funds-to-buy-igt-gaming-and-everi-for-6-3bn/), with the latter’s shareholders approving the transaction a few days before the cyberattack. Private equity firm Apollo Global Management will own the new entity after the $6.3bn transaction concludes. IGT will operate its lottery division as its own entity.\nGambling companies are no stranger to cyberattacks. The most high-profile recent incident saw [MGM Resorts International’s systems hit in September 2023](https://www.vegasslotsonline.com/news/2023/09/18/mgm-losing-up-to-8-4m-per-day-as-cyberattack-enters-second-week/), leading to mass disruptions across its US properties. Caesars Entertainment suffered a similar breach around the same time, ultimately paying a $15m ransom to the hackers.",

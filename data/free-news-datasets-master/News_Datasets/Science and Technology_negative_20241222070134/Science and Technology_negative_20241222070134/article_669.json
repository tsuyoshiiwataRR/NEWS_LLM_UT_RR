    "text": "Sony’s own list of PS5 Pro launch games contains titles that still aren’t enhanced\nThe issue isn’t limited to the PS Store. It looks like there was a lapse in communication somewhere because Sony’s own official list of PS5 Pro “launch” games mentions at least two titles that have yet to be enhanced, and they aren’t exactly small games.\nBoth Fortnite and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 are still listed on the PS Blog as having enhancements at launch, and at the time of this writing, neither of the two games have received Pro patches.\nMany thought that Black Ops 6 Season 1 update would contain Pro enhancements, but we haven’t spotted anything in the patch notes yet. There’s still no word on Fortnite either.\nWe’re not sure what’s going on here, but we’ll keep an eye on the situation. In the meantime, PS5 Pro players will have to make do with hardware level boosts for games that have yet to be patched.\nPosted:\nRelated Forum:\n[PlayStation Forum](/Forums/f=322/playstation-forum.html)\nSource: https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2024/11/14/games-without-ps5-pro-patches-labeled-enhanced-ps-store/",

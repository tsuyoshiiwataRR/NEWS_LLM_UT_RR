    "text": "In devastating news for Snoop Dogg, Bill Maher, and Kamala Harris, a study carried out by researchers in Australia indicates a \"genotoxic\" connection between cannabis use and genetic damage that is behind rising rates of cancers and other health issues, such as birth defects and accelerated aging.\nI'll define \"genotoxic%3A%20genotoxicity,birth%20defects%20(inheritable%20damage).)\" for you:\nToxic (damaging) to DNA. Substances that are genotoxic may bind directly to DNA or act indirectly leading to DNA damage by affecting enzymes involved in DNA replication, thereby causing mutations which may or may not lead to cancer or birth defects.\nSo yeah...\nThe study was carried out by researchers at the University of Western Australia, and was published in Addiction Biology. According to their findings, exposure to cannabis was associated with a range of cancers - breast, pancreatic, liver, thyroid, testicular and lymphoma - that also develop quickly and are more aggressive.\nIn addition, links to birth defects were found, indicating that cannabis use could cause DNA mutations that pass on to children in utero.\n\"The link we've described between cannabis use and genotoxicity has far-reaching consequences,\" said Stuart Reece of the University of Western Australia, a co-author of the study. \"This new research shows how genetic damage from cannabis use can be passed down the generations.\"\nRecreational marijuana use is legal in 24 states, 3 U.S. territories and the District of Columbia.\nWhile support for further legalization is gaining momentum, Reece added that he hopes the analysis \"reframes the discussion surrounding cannabis legalization from a personal choice to one that potentially involves multiple subsequent generations.\"\nFollow Ian on Substack or X (@ighaworth).\nP.S.

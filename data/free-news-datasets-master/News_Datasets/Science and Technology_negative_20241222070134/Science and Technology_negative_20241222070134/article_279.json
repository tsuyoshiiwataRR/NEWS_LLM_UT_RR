    "text": "Most Apple users have a old iPhone stored in a drawer, because, when purchasing the new one, they have not gotten rid of the old one, and these, sometimes, still have data from an old iCloud account that we can access online and that we do not want to lose.\nWell, you have to be careful, since Apple has announced that all iPhones that are not updated will lose not only the ability to make new copies, but all the content that existed in that last copy that we had, so we could be left without nothing.\nApple will delete old iClouds The news that the company itself has transmitted to us is that on December 18, 2024, all devices that are not updated to iOS 9 versions or higher will lose all their data, which means that if you have an old iPhone sitting in a drawer that you haven’t updated in years, take a look at it, and make an external copy of all its data, or, at least, try to see if you have a pending update, something that would be quite possible, and with which you would prevent everything from being lost.\nThe first iPhone that did not receive iOS 9 was the iPhone 4, so if you have a newer model you should have no problems, however, if you own a iPhone 4 or lower then your only alternative is to download all the data from that account, either from your mobile phone itself or from the iCloud website with your username and password.\nOne of the reasons for this change is due to the security that the brand always seeks in its systems, and that is that iCloud in iOS 8 is already more than a decade old, and things have changed a lot in this time, so they believe which could be a breach for attackers and, therefore, they give us a month to recover data from these phones, if we have anything to care about, since in 10 years, we have had time to download the content .\nThis is something that we usually see in applications, where if we do not have a more recent system, we will not be able to use it, and on those devices that we are talking about today, we will not even be able to have WhatsApp for years, so it is logical that the The rest of the functions and tools may also become obsolete.\nAnd you, do you have an iPhone 4 or lower? The truth is that we are talking about very old devices, and that, possibly if you have them, they will not even work, so we do not believe that this measure will catch anyone by surprise, however, if remember to save one, you can take a look at it, and possibly find something in it that you want to save, although the truth is that if you have photos or contacts, these They will not be removed from the phone it will simply be the iCloud copy, so you wouldn’t lose these, at least physically.\nLeave us a comment with your opinion about it and if you agree that Apple makes these changes, supposedly, for our security and to protect the data we have in the cloud.",

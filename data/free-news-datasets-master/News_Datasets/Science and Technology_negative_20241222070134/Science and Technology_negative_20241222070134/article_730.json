    "text": "Hi,\nIn my case i have 2 identical setups for me and my brother in my house.\n2 ps4 slim\n2 Logitech g29 racing wheel\nWe play in LAN mode (not in online word)\nFirst i turn on the ps4 with the original dualshock controler, because we use a wired headphone on the controller.\nThen i turn on the wheel.\nThen we open the F1 2024 (fully updated)\nThen he create a host on LAN mode.\nThen i enter his race.\nBoth our wheels are set the maximum rotation to 280°\nThen we bouth already can see that the wheel is turning more than 360°, maybe about 400°.\nTo fix, we have to enter the race, then retired.\nThen when it leaves to race setup again, my wheel (the guest) its fixet, its turning only the degrees is in my configuration. But the host still not, then he leaves the LAN going back to main menu, then the F1 puts me to be the host because he left, then he enters my LAN host. And then when he enters his wheel fixed to, turning only the degrees configurated.\nThis hapens every single time. We play every dai, and lost all this time doing this every day.",

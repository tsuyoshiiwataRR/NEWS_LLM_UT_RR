    "text": "‘All of a Sudden, Joe Blow Can See the CEO's Emails’ You should probably be very careful about how you set up Microsoft Copilot. Good Morning! Here are today’s highlights: Deporting millions of people will be complex, time-consuming, and expensive. Even legally authorized immigrants fear getting caught up in the raids. A beloved shopkeeper who wasn’t accepted at first gets a special sendoff. Ozempic and the other new weight-loss drugs could destroy the junk-food industry. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Microsoft is trying to fix Copilot’s “over-sharing” problem: “You know when a colleague overshares at work? It's awkward at best. Microsoft's Copilot has been doing an AI version of this behavior, which has unnerved corporate customers so much that some have delayed deploying the product, as Business Insider first reported last week. Now, the software giant is trying to fix the problem. On Tuesday, Microsoft released new tools and a guide to help customers mitigate a Copilot security issue that inadvertently let employees access sensitive information, such as CEO emails and HR documents.” “Copilot's magic — its ability to create a 10-slide road-mapping presentation, or to summon up a list of your company's most profitable products — works by browsing and indexing all of your company's internal information, like the web crawlers used by search engines.” “Historically, IT departments at some companies have set up lax permissions for who can access internal documents — selecting ‘allow all,’ say, for the company's HR software, rather than going through the trouble of selecting specific users. That never created much of a problem, because there wasn't a tool that an average employee could use to identify and retrieve sensitive company documents — until Copilot.” “As a result, some customers have deployed Copilot, only to discover that it can enable employees to read an executive's inbox or access sensitive HR documents. ‘Now, when Joe Blow logs into an account and kicks off Copilot, they can see everything,’ said one Microsoft employee familiar with customer complaints. ‘All of a sudden Joe Blow can see the CEO's emails.’” READ MORE Keep reading with a 7-day free trial Subscribe to The 21 Hats Morning Report to keep reading this post and get 7 days of free access to the full post archives.",

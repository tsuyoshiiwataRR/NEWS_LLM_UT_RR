    "text": "Microsoft has intensified full-screen ads to migrate Windows 10 users to Windows 11. Ahead of Windows 10 support ending on October 14, 2025, users are seeing ads on their devices highlighting the benefits of Windows 11.\nMicrosoft’s insistence on Windows 11 for Windows 10 users\nAs it is known, Microsoft offers three options to users after the end of Windows 10 support. These are upgrading to Windows 11, receiving extended security updates in exchange for a subscription, or continuing to use Windows 10 without updates. Microsoft’s ads primarily promote the transition to Windows 11, but do not provide enough information about other options.\nNotably absent is any mention of the Extended Security Update (ESU) program, which allows individual users to receive security updates for another year for a fee. Corporate and education customers can benefit from this program for up to three years.\nThe ads also lack clear guidance on how to upgrade an existing device to Windows 11. This suggests that Microsoft is more interested in driving new PC sales than in encouraging users to upgrade. It’s worth noting that the ad strategy has been accelerating for a few months and users have been annoyed.\nStill, Microsoft acknowledges that some users will stay on Windows 10 and recommends backing up files to OneDrive to avoid any problems. It seems possible that applications will also stop support for Windows 10 in the near future.\nSo what do you think about this issue? Don’t forget to share your opinions with us in the comments section.",

    "text": "The City of Odessa experiences a cyber incident\nODESSA, Texas (KOSA) - During the night of November 20, a cyber incident attacked the City of Odessa network.\nBecause of the attack, the City of Odessa’s network has been down all day, but it is expected to be fixed by November 22. .\nThe city’s cybersecurity team detected the attempt in progress last night and was able to shut it down before anything could get in or out of the system.\n“They were able to follow the protocols we have in place to ensure the security of our network,” said Craig Stoker, the Odessa City Council Member At-Large.\nEven though the attempt was detected and stopped, the cybersecurity team took the day to make sure the system was operating normally.\n“To do a deep dive into our systems to make sure that nothing was infected and nothing is being held for ransom and that everything is operating as it should be. My understanding is so far so good. All the protocols we had in place worked,” Stoker said.\nThe city assures residents that none of their data was stolen.\nAs a result of the network being down, both the Municipal Court building and the Billing and Collection Department at City Hall has been closed all day.\nThe city assures residents that any payments due on November 21st will not be considered late.\nCourt dockets will have to be rescheduled, and there is no access to online payments, kiosks or window services.\n“City Hall is a great group of folks who are working everyday to make sure that the city continues to provide the services that you need and it is a great team effort that makes those things happen,” said Stoker.\nMagistration functions have been conducted using a paper system, with the computer portion completed at a later date.\nThat later date seems to be November 22.\n“These are things we just have to be used to. This is why we have policies and procedures in place to detect and thort these kinds of things. They just happen. This is part of today’s world and I’m happy to know that the systems we had in place worked,” Stoker said.\nStoker updated First Alert 7 in a text around 3:15 pm, saying the initial report from the Cybersecurity Specialist looks positive and the estimated time to be up and running is around 5 am on Friday, November 22.\nCopyright 2024 KOSA.

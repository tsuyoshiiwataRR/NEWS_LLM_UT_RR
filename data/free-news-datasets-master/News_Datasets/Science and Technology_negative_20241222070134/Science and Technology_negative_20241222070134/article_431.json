    "text": "Killer Skull ransomware virus - removal and decryption options\n Written by Tomas Meskauskas on\nWhat kind of malware is Killer Skull?\nOur discovery of Killer Skull occurred while inspecting malware samples submitted to VirusTotal. Killer Skull is ransomware based on [Chaos](/removal-guides/21133-chaos-ransomware) ransomware. It encrypts files, appends its extension (four random characters) to filenames, changes the desktop wallpaper, and provides a ransom note (\"payment_information.txt\").\nAn example of how Killer Skull renames files: it changes \"1.jpg\" to \"1.jpg.i0zw\", \"2.png\" to \"2.png.7t8w\", \"3.exe\" to \"3.exe.062\", and so forth.\nScreenshot of files encrypted by this ransomware:\nKiller Skull ransom note overview\nThe ransom note informs the victim that their computer has been infected with Killer Skull ransomware, which has encrypted all hard drives and networks using the ChaCha20 encryption algorithm. In order to recover the system, the victim is instructed to contact the attacker via email (zlock3d@gmail.com) and pay a ransom of ~228.996 BTC.\nThe note threatens that if the ransom is not paid, the computer will be destroyed.\nMore details about ransomware\nPaying the cybercriminals responsible for ransomware attacks is not advised, as there is no guarantee they will provide decryption tools. In most cases, decrypting files without their tools is nearly impossible unless third-party solutions are available. The best way for victims to recover files without losing money is through data backups (if victims have them).\nIt is also crucial to remove ransomware from infected devices to prevent further damage. If not dealt with as soon as possible, ransomware may encrypt more files and spread across local networks (and encrypt files on connected devices).\nRansomware in general\nRansomware is malware that can cause data loss and financial harm. Cybercriminals use various methods to trick users into downloading and executing ransomware on their systems. Their goal is to extort money from victims (and sometimes information). Some examples of ransomware variants are [Biobio (Kasper)](/removal-guides/31513-biobio-kasper-ransomware), [DARKSET](/removal-guides/31489-darkset-ransomware), and [Arcus](/removal-guides/31488-arcus-ransomware).\nHow did ransomware infect my computer?\nThreat actors use different methods to trick users into infecting computers with ransomware, such as sending emails with malicious attachments or links, hiding ransomware in pirated software, or using [fake tech support websites](/common-types-of-computer-infections#tech-support-scam) (or similar schemes). They may also exploit software flaws or use malicious ads.\nRansomware can also be spread through downloads from unsafe sources like shady websites, P2P networks, or third-party downloaders. It is commonly hidden in MS Office documents, PDFs, executables, or files like ISO and archives.\nName | Killer Skull virus |\nThreat Type | Ransomware, Crypto Virus, Files locker |\nEncrypted Files Extension | Four random characters (different to every file) |\nRansom Demanding Message | payment_information.txt |\nFree Decryptor Available? | No |\nRansom Amount | ~228 BTC |\nCyber Criminal Contact | zlock3d@gmail.com |\nDetection Names | Avast (Win32:RansomX-gen [Ransom]), Combo Cleaner (Gen:Heur.Ransom.Imps.3), ESET-NOD32 (A Variant Of MSIL/Filecoder.Chaos.A), Kaspersky (HEUR:Trojan-Ransom.MSIL.Agent.gen), Microsoft (Ransom:MSIL/FileCoder.AD!MTB), Full List Of Detections (\n|\n[Chaos](/removal-guides/21133-chaos-ransomware).To eliminate possible malware infections, scan your computer with legitimate antivirus software.

Avoid clicking on links or opening attachments in such emails, as they may contain malicious content. Similarly, refrain from clicking on ads or pop-ups on dubious websites, and never download software or files from unofficial sources.\nDownload apps only from reliable platforms, such as official websites or app stores. To protect against threats, it is also important to regularly update your security software, apps, and operating system. If your computer is already infected with Killer Skull, we recommend running a scan with [Combo Cleaner Antivirus for Windows](/download-combo-cleaner-windows) to automatically eliminate this ransomware.\nScreenshot of Killer Skull's text file (\"payment_information.txt\"):\nText in the ransom note:\nOOPS! you became victim of killer skull ransomware!\nWhat happened to my pc?\nAll your harddisks and netwworks are encrypted with chacha20 encryption algorithm.

By providing information to law enforcement agencies you will help track cybercrime and potentially assist in the prosecution of the attackers. Here's a list of authorities where you should report a ransomware attack. For the complete list of local cybersecurity centers and information on why you should report ransomware attacks, [read this article](/reporting-ransomware-to-authorities).\nList of local authorities where ransomware attacks should be reported (choose one depending on your residence address):\n- USA -\nInternet Crime Complaint Centre IC3 - United Kingdom -\nAction Fraud - Spain -\nPolicía Nacional - France -\nMinistère de l'Intérieur - Germany -\nPolizei - Italy -\nPolizia di Stato - The Netherlands -\nPolitie - Poland -\nPolicja - Portugal -\nPolícia Judiciária\nIsolating the infected device:\nSome ransomware-type infections are designed to encrypt files within external storage devices, infect them, and even spread throughout the entire local network. For this reason, it is very important to isolate the infected device (computer) as soon as possible.\nStep 1: Disconnect from the internet.\nThe easiest way to disconnect a computer from the internet is to unplug the Ethernet cable from the motherboard, however, some devices are connected via a wireless network and for some users (especially those who are not particularly tech-savvy), disconnecting cables may seem troublesome. Therefore, you can also disconnect the system manually via Control Panel:\nNavigate to the \"Control Panel\", click the search bar in the upper-right corner of the screen, enter \"Network and Sharing Center\" and select search result:\nClick the \"Change adapter settings\" option in the upper-left corner of the window:\nRight-click on each connection point and select \"Disable\". Once disabled, the system will no longer be connected to the internet. To re-enable the connection points, simply right-click again and select \"Enable\".\nStep 2: Unplug all storage devices.\nAs mentioned above, ransomware might encrypt data and infiltrate all storage devices that are connected to the computer. For this reason, all external storage devices (flash drives, portable hard drives, etc.) should be disconnected immediately, however, we strongly advise you to eject each device before disconnecting to prevent data corruption:\nNavigate to \"My Computer\", right-click on each connected device, and select \"Eject\":\nStep 3: Log-out of cloud storage accounts.\nSome ransomware-type might be able to hijack software that handles data stored within \"the Cloud\". Therefore, the data could be corrupted/encrypted. For this reason, you should log-out of all cloud storage accounts within browsers and other related software. You should also consider temporarily uninstalling the cloud-management software until the infection is completely removed.\nIdentify the ransomware infection:\nTo properly handle an infection, one must first identify it. Some ransomware infections use ransom-demand messages as an introduction (see the WALDO ransomware text file below).\nThis, however, is rare. In most cases, ransomware infections deliver more direct messages simply stating that data is encrypted and that victims must pay some sort of ransom. Note that ransomware-type infections typically generate messages with different file names (for example, \"_readme.txt\", \"READ-ME.txt\", \"DECRYPTION_INSTRUCTIONS.txt\", \"DECRYPT_FILES.html\", etc.). Therefore, using the name of a ransom message may seem like a good way to identify the infection. The problem is that most of these names are generic and some infections use the same names, even though the delivered messages are different and the infections themselves are unrelated. Therefore, using the message filename alone can be ineffective and even lead to permanent data loss (for example, by attempting to decrypt data using tools designed for different ransomware infections, users are likely to end up permanently damaging files and decryption will no longer be possible even with the correct tool).\nAnother way to identify a ransomware infection is to check the file extension, which is appended to each encrypted file. Ransomware infections are often named by the extensions they append (see files encrypted by Qewe ransomware below).\nThis method is only effective, however, when the appended extension is unique - many ransomware infections append a generic extension (for example, \".encrypted\", \".enc\", \".crypted\", \".locked\", etc.). In these cases, identifying ransomware by its appended extension becomes impossible.\nOne of the easiest and quickest ways to identify a ransomware infection is to use the ID Ransomware website. This service supports most existing ransomware infections. Victims simply upload a ransom message and/or one encrypted file (we advise you to upload both if possible).\nThe ransomware will be identified within seconds and you will be provided with various details, such as the name of the malware family to which the infection belongs, whether it is decryptable, and so on.\nExample 1 (Qewe [Stop/Djvu] ransomware):\nExample 2 (.iso [Phobos] ransomware):\nIf your data happens to be encrypted by ransomware that is not supported by ID Ransomware, you can always try searching the internet by using certain keywords (for example, a ransom message title, file extension, provided contact emails, crypto wallet addresses, etc.).\nSearch for ransomware decryption tools:\nEncryption algorithms used by most ransomware-type infections are extremely sophisticated and, if the encryption is performed properly, only the developer is capable of restoring data. This is because decryption requires a specific key, which is generated during the encryption. Restoring data without the key is impossible. In most cases, cybercriminals store keys on a remote server, rather than using the infected machine as a host. Dharma (CrySis), Phobos, and other families of high-end ransomware infections are virtually flawless, and thus restoring data encrypted without the developers' involvement is simply impossible. Despite this, there are dozens of ransomware-type infections that are poorly developed and contain a number of flaws (for example, the use of identical encryption/decryption keys for each victim, keys stored locally, etc.). Therefore, always check for available decryption tools for any ransomware that infiltrates your computer.\nFinding the correct decryption tool on the internet can be very frustrating. For this reason, we recommend that you use the No More Ransom Project and this is where [identifying the ransomware infection](#identifying-ransomware-infection) is useful. The No More Ransom Project website contains a \"Decryption Tools\" section with a search bar. Enter the name of the identified ransomware, and all available decryptors (if there are any) will be listed.\nRestore files with data recovery tools:\nDepending on the situation (quality of ransomware infection, type of encryption algorithm used, etc.), restoring data with certain third-party tools might be possible. Therefore, we advise you to use the Recuva tool developed by CCleaner. This tool supports over a thousand data types (graphics, video, audio, documents, etc.) and it is very intuitive (little knowledge is necessary to recover data). In addition, the recovery feature is completely free.\nStep 1: Perform a scan.\nRun the Recuva application and follow the wizard. You will be prompted with several windows allowing you to choose what file types to look for, which locations should be scanned, etc. All you need to do is select the options you're looking for and start the scan. We advise you to enable the \"Deep Scan\" before starting, otherwise, the application's scanning capabilities will be restricted.\nWait for Recuva to complete the scan. The scanning duration depends on the volume of files (both in quantity and size) that you are scanning (for example, several hundred gigabytes could take over an hour to scan). Therefore, be patient during the scanning process. We also advise against modifying or deleting existing files, since this might interfere with the scan. If you add additional data (for example, downloading files/content) while scanning, this will prolong the process:\nStep 2: Recover data.\nOnce the process is complete, select the folders/files you wish to restore and simply click \"Recover\". Note that some free space on your storage drive is necessary to restore data:\nCreate data backups:\nProper file management and creating backups is essential for data security. Therefore, always be very careful and think ahead.\nPartition management: We recommend that you store your data in multiple partitions and avoid storing important files within the partition that contains the entire operating system. If you fall into a situation whereby you cannot boot the system and are forced to format the disk on which the operating system is installed (in most cases, this is where malware infections hide), you will lose all data stored within that drive. This is the advantage of having multiple partitions: if you have the entire storage device assigned to a single partition, you will be forced to delete everything, however, creating multiple partitions and allocating the data properly allows you to prevent such problems. You can easily format a single partition without affecting the others - therefore, one will be cleaned and the others will remain untouched, and your data will be saved. Managing partitions is quite simple and you can find all the necessary information on Microsoft's documentation web page.\nData backups: One of the most reliable backup methods is to use an external storage device and keep it unplugged. Copy your data to an external hard drive, flash (thumb) drive, SSD, HDD, or any other storage device, unplug it and store it in a dry place away from the sun and extreme temperatures. This method is, however, quite inefficient, since data backups and updates need to be made regularly. You can also use a cloud service or remote server. Here, an internet connection is required and there is always the chance of a security breach, although it's a really rare occasion.\nWe recommend using Microsoft OneDrive for backing up your files. OneDrive lets you store your personal files and data in the cloud, sync files across computers and mobile devices, allowing you to access and edit your files from all of your Windows devices. OneDrive lets you save, share and preview files, access download history, move, delete, and rename files, as well as create new folders, and much more.\nYou can back up your most important folders and files on your PC (your Desktop, Documents, and Pictures folders). Some of OneDrive’s more notable features include file versioning, which keeps older versions of files for up to 30 days. OneDrive features a recycling bin in which all of your deleted files are stored for a limited time. Deleted files are not counted as part of the user’s allocation.\nThe service is built using HTML5 technologies and allows you to upload files up to 300 MB via drag and drop into the web browser or up to 10 GB via the OneDrive desktop application. With OneDrive, you can download entire folders as a single ZIP file with up to 10,000 files, although it can’t exceed 15 GB per single download.\nOneDrive comes with 5 GB of free storage out of the box, with an additional 100 GB, 1 TB, and 6 TB storage options available for a subscription-based fee. You can get one of these storage plans by either purchasing additional storage separately or with Office 365 subscription.\nCreating a data backup:\nThe backup process is the same for all file types and folders. Here’s how you can back up your files using Microsoft OneDrive\nStep 1: Choose the files/folders you want to backup.\nClick the OneDrive cloud icon to open the OneDrive menu. While in this menu, you can customize your file backup settings.\nClick Help & Settings and then select Settings from the drop-down menu.\nGo to the Backup tab and click Manage backup.\nIn this menu, you can choose to backup the Desktop and all of the files on it, and Documents and Pictures folders, again, with all of the files in them. Click Start backup.\nNow, when you add a file or folder in the Desktop and Documents and Pictures folders, they will be automatically backed up on OneDrive.\nTo add folders and files, not in the locations shown above, you have to add them manually.\nOpen File Explorer and navigate to the location of the folder/file you want to backup. Select the item, right-click it, and click Copy.\nThen, navigate to OneDrive, right-click anywhere in the window and click Paste. Alternatively, you can just drag and drop a file into OneDrive. OneDrive will automatically create a backup of the folder/file.\nAll of the files added to the OneDrive folder are backed up in the cloud automatically. The green circle with the checkmark in it indicates that the file is available both locally and on OneDrive and that the file version is the same on both. The blue cloud icon indicates that the file has not been synced and is available only on OneDrive. The sync icon indicates that the file is currently syncing.\nTo access files only located on OneDrive online, go to the Help & Settings drop-down menu and select View online.\nStep 2: Restore corrupted files.\nOneDrive makes sure that the files stay in sync, so the version of the file on the computer is the same version on the cloud. However, if ransomware has encrypted your files, you can take advantage of OneDrive’s Version history feature that will allow you to restore the file versions prior to encryption.\nMicrosoft 365 has a ransomware detection feature that notifies you when your OneDrive files have been attacked and guide you through the process of restoring your files. It must be noted, however, that if you don’t have a paid Microsoft 365 subscription, you only get one detection and file recovery for free.\nIf your OneDrive files get deleted, corrupted, or infected by malware, you can restore your entire OneDrive to a previous state. Here’s how you can restore your entire OneDrive:\n1. If you're signed in with a personal account, click the Settings cog at the top of the page. Then, click Options and select Restore your OneDrive.\nIf you're signed in with a work or school account, click the Settings cog at the top of the page. Then, click Restore your OneDrive.\n2. On the Restore your OneDrive page, select a date from the drop-down list. Note that if you're restoring your files after automatic ransomware detection, a restore date will be selected for you.\n3. After configuring all of the file restoration options, click Restore to undo all the activities you selected.\nThe best way to avoid damage from ransomware infections is to maintain regular up-to-date backups.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nHow was my computer hacked and how did hackers encrypt my files?\nThreat actors use various tactics to spread ransomware, including malicious email attachments, pirated software, fake tech support sites, and exploiting software vulnerabilities. Ransomware can also be distributed through unsafe downloads from shady websites, P2P networks, or third-party downloaders, often hidden in documents, PDFs, executables, or files like ISO and archives.\nHow to open encrypted files?\nA ransomware infection has encrypted your files, and a decryption software or key is needed to restore access to them.\nWhere should I look for free decryption tools for Killer Skull ransomware?\nIn case of a ransomware attack you should check the No More Ransom project website ([more information above](#searching-for-ransomware-decryption-tools)).\nI can pay you a lot of money, can you decrypt files for me?\nWe do not offer decryption services. Files encrypted by ransomware are usually impossible to recover without the developers' involvement unless ransomware has bugs/flaws. Any third party offering paid decryption is likely either a scam or acting as a man-in-the-middle.\nWill Combo Cleaner help me remove Killer Skull ransomware?\nYes, Combo Cleaner will scan your computer and remove active ransomware. However, while antivirus software is essential for detecting and removing ransomware, it cannot decrypt the files that have already been encrypted.\n▼ Show Discussion",

    "text": "Bloober Team has today released a new update for [Silent Hill 2](games/ps5/silent_hill_2) that intends to fix the issues the title is facing when it is played on PS5 Pro. It's available to download now and weighs in at 517.1 MB, but it appears that anyone playing on the new upgraded console shouldn't get their hopes up too much for the update to completely solve everything. The testing done by users after installing the update reveals there are still graphical issues with the build.\nFor example, Twitter user [@yrlak](https://x.com/yrlak/status/1859917296799821838) responded to the tweet announcing the update with a video of constant flickering and image blotches in an interior environment. Then, on Reddit, it's described how the opening area just outside of Silent Hill still features flickering in puddles and an \"annoying shimmer\" in reflective surfaces. \"The base PS5 still produces a more stable image,\" claimed user [erimiz687](https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1gx4ii2/ps5_pro_patch_is_out/).\nIt's agreed this is a better version of Silent Hill 2 for PS5 Pro users with patch 1.06 applied, but the frame rate still appears temperamental and graphical glitches remain an issue. It looks like another PS5 Pro-specific update will be required to get the survival horror game in an optimal state. You can find the rest of the patch notes below.\nSilent Hill 2 PS5 Update 1.06 Patch Notes\nTechnology\n- Fixed a bug regarding trophy counting\n- Fixed some graphics glitches on PlayStation 5 Pro\nGameplay\n- Fixed door markers on Brookhaven Hospital map\n- Improved traversal spots and fixed an issue where enemies could get stuck\n- Fixed an audio glitch in the bull section of Toluca Prison\n- Fixed minor blocker in Labyrinth (player was unable to exit either side of the Labyrinth after obtaining the map)\n- Fixed map marker for boar lot in Toluca Prison\n- Fixed map marker west of Southvale\n- Fixed a bug with Maria's navigation\n- Fixed an issue where some of Maria's lines would occur multiple times.\n- Fixed an issue where the final boss was missing and a movement bug\n- Fixed an issue where mannequins would get stuck in ambush mode\n- Fixed interactions with items that were difficult to obtain\n- Improved boss animations\n- Added a guide for picking up the plate in the final puzzle of Toluca Prison\n- Fixed a translation issue when changing difficulty during gameplay\n- Fixed wall animation during Abstract Daddy fight based on user feedback\n- Fixed an issue where the game would not progress after a cutscene when using low FPS.\n- Fixed a progression-blocking issue at Brookhaven Hospital\n- Fixed some issues with lights in Southvale East at night.\n- Fixed an issue with the mannequin's physics\n- Fixed other minor issues with objects, collision detection, typos, lighting, drawing, and loading.\n[source [konami.com](https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/2r/news/jp/ja/update_106)]",

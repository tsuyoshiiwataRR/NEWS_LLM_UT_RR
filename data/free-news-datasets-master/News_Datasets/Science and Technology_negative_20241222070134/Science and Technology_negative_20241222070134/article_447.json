    "text": "Microsoft has started showing full-screen ads to Windows 10 users to promote Windows 11 and Copilot+.\nHere’s what we know These ads highlight new features and warn that support for Windows 10 will end in October 2025. Users are encouraged to upgrade to Windows 11 or purchase security updates to protect their computers. Microsoft says the new Copilot+ computers are significantly faster than older Windows PCs, making them an attractive upgrade option.\nCurrently, around 70% of Windows users are still using Windows 10, so the company is doubling its efforts to get them to upgrade to Windows 11 before support expires.

Businesses will pay $61 per computer the first year, and that amount will double each subsequent year.

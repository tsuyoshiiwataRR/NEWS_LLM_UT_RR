    "text": "It has now been two years since Tesla promised to open the gates to the walled garden that is its charging network. At the same time, almost every brand selling EVs in the US said it would start fitting their EVs with NACS charging ports. Then, Tesla went a step further and promised it would fit retrofit Superchargers with [what it calls a Magic Dock](https://carbuzz.com/news/tesla-superchargers-with-magic-dock-spotted-charging-a-rivian-r1t/), allowing any EV to plug in and get a fast charge - Tesla port or not. According to a report by Bloomberg Green, only around 100 Tesla Superchargers have been kitted out to become brand-agnostic. Good luck charging your [Kia EV6](https://carbuzz.com/cars/kia/ev6/) at a Tesla station.\n[ Tesla ](/cars/tesla/)\nTesla, Inc. is an American electric vehicle manufacturer largely attributed to driving the EV revolution. Through the Model S and subsequent products, Tesla has innovated and challenged industry conventions on numerous fronts, including over-the-air updates, self-driving technology, and automotive construction methods. Tesla is considered the world's most valuable car brand as of 2023, and the [Model Y the world's best-selling car](https://carbuzz.com/news/tesla-model-y-is-the-worlds-best-selling-vehicle-just-like-elon-musk-predicted/) in the same year, but the brand's greatest achievement is arguably the Supercharger network of EV charging stations.\n- Founder\n- Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning\n- Headquarters\n- Austin, Texas, USA\n- Owned By\n- Publicly Traded\n- Current CEO\n- Elon Musk\nMagic Docks Are Few And Far Between\nIt's a baffling promise for Tesla to not keep. It has the opportunity to expand its network further and continue [to dominate the charging part of the EV industry](https://carbuzz.com/automakers-strike-back-step-one-in-fight-against-tesla-supercharger-dominance/). Yet, in the spiritual home of the all-electric vehicle, California, there are exactly five Magic Dock-fitted Superchargers. In Florida, there is just one Magic Dock Supercharger. Texas, however, has 20.\n[Related ](/us-electric-vehicle-chargers-doubled-since-2021/)\n[ This Is How Much America's EV Charging Network Has Grown Since 2021 ](/us-electric-vehicle-chargers-doubled-since-2021/)\nThis comes as the Department of Transportation announces a further $521 million in grants earmarked for additional EV infrastructure.\nNew York and New Jersey have around 20 between them, but the majority of states have just one or two. Even more confoundingly, Tesla doesn't seem bothered about making sure its own customers have plenty of charger accessibility. Not long ago, [Tesla shrunk its Supercharger team](https://carbuzz.com/tesla-owners-looking-for-a-charge-will-soon-have-mercedes-drivers-in-their-way/) and reports suggest that the few hired back again aren't enough to support the system.\nWorkarounds For The Problem\nNext year, most EVs rolling off of a production line will have a Tesla charging port, known as NACS (North American Charging Standard) - despite being proprietary. This means the existing chargers will still become increasingly used by non-Tesla models, which will, of course, annoy more Tesla drivers who have become less satisfied with their charging experiences already. Although it will bring a splash of color to the row of white cars you always see when passing a line of Superchargers.\n[Related ](/rivian-update-ranks-us-charging-stations/)\n[ New Rivian Update Will Rank Every US EV Charging Station So You Know Which Ones To Avoid ](/rivian-update-ranks-us-charging-stations/)\nThe latest software update for the R1T and R1S has made it far easier to avoid broken chargers and weak networks.\nIn terms of retrofitting vehicles, Ford got tired of waiting for Tesla and [built its own adapter](https://carbuzz.com/news/ford-f-150-lightning-and-mustang-mach-e-owners-can-now-use-teslas-superchargers/), which it gives away free to its EV customers. GM did likewise but its customers have to pay for the accessory. We are, indeed, [still in the early adoption stage for EVs](https://carbuzz.com/features/buying-an-ev-in-2022-makes-you-an-early-adopter-and-thats-ok/).\nSource:\n[Bloomberg Green]",

Chrome is not enough, the Department of Justice is also seeking to divest the Android system and limit AI training. 谷歌一度跌7%！Chrome不够，司法部还寻求剥离安卓系统、限制AI训练 Google once fell 7%! Chrome is not enough, the Department of Justice is also seeking to divest the Android system and limit AI training. wallstreetcn · 6 mins ago GOOG -4.56% GOOGL -4.74%\n美国司法部向法庭提出要求，除了剥离其Chrome浏览器外，还要谷歌剥离安卓操作系统，并限制谷歌训练AI模型。如果提案最终被接受，谷歌将不得再拥有浏览器，并且在未来五年内不能重新进入浏览器市场。此外，谷歌还不再能够独占大量的数据资源，这些数据对于AI训练至关重要。\n$谷歌-C (GOOG.US)$ 反垄断案再度升级！近日，美国司法部向法庭提出要求，除了剥离其Chrome浏览器外，还要谷歌剥离安卓操作系统，并限制谷歌训练AI模型。\n$谷歌-A (GOOGL.US)$ 一度跌7%，收盘时跌幅收窄近5%。\n据英国《金融时报》21日报道，美国司法部在周四提交的法庭文件显示，司法部认为， 通过剥离Chrome浏览器和安卓操作系统，能够有效削弱谷歌在在线搜索市场中的主导地位。\n如果提案最终被接受，谷歌将不得再拥有浏览器，并且在未来五年内不能重新进入浏览器市场。同时，司法部还要求谷歌在六个月内剥离对搜索引擎、查询型AI产品和广告技术的投资。\n随着特朗普当选总统，并即将重新任命新一届司法部门领导，谷歌的反垄断案件正进入一个关键阶段。\n司法部要求限制谷歌AI训练内容 本周早些时候，彭博社报道称，美国司法部计划强制谷歌出售Chrome。司法部认为，剥离Chrome浏览器将允许谷歌的竞争对手争取本应拥有的市场份额，并能打破谷歌长期以来对搜索引擎市场的垄断。\n而如今，双方的矛盾再度升级。 除了剥离浏览器，司法部还要求谷歌剥离安卓系统，并限制其AI模型的训练内容。\n检察官在文件中表示：\n“由于谷歌的行为，竞争环境并不公平，谷歌的行为反映了其非法获得的优势的不义之财。补救措施必须弥补这一差距，剥夺谷歌的这些优势。”\n根据提议， 谷歌必须允许竞争对手以“边际成本”获取其搜索索引、用户和广告的数据，同时保证隐私保护。\n这意味着， 谷歌不再能够独占大量的数据资源，这些数据对于AI训练至关重要。\n司法部还表示，谷歌应当停止支付给苹果等合作伙伴数十亿美元的年费，使其搜索引擎成为默认选项的合同，这一做法已经成为谷歌在搜索引擎市场中占据主导地位的核心手段。\n2021年，谷歌支付给苹果的金额就超过200亿美元，这也帮助其确保了苹果Safari浏览器中的默认搜索引擎地位。\n谷歌强烈反对，称“影响消费者和技术竞争力” 而谷歌方面自然不甘示弱，对此提案表示强烈反对，称司法部的要求“震撼且过于激进”。\n谷歌认为， 剥离Chrome浏览器和安卓操作系统将对消费者造成损害， 因为这些产品目前是免费的，且谷歌将其作为“亏损引流工具”，用于推广其搜索引擎和广告业务。特别是没有其他公司能够投入足够的资金，来保持浏览器的安全性和竞争力。\n此外，谷歌还表示， 这一要求可能会对其在AI领域的投资产生严重影响，进而削弱其全球技术领导地位。\n目前，案件仍在审理之中，法官Amit Mehta预计将在2025年中做出是否接受这些补救措施的决定。如果该提案被采纳，将是美国反垄断部门对谷歌反垄断打击的历史性胜利。\n然而，随着特朗普即将出任美国总统，司法部反垄断行动的前景也充满不确定性。 如果他重新任命新一届司法部门领导，是否继续对谷歌采取如此严厉的措施将成为一个悬而未决的问题。 此外，特朗普政府是否会改变现有的反垄断政策，亦尚不明确。\n编辑/jayden\nThe US Department of Justice has requested the court to not only require Google to divest its Chrome browser, but also to separate Google from the Android operating system and restrict Google from training AI models. If the proposal is ultimately accepted, Google will no longer be able to own a browser and will not be able to re-enter the browser market in the next five years. In addition, Google will no longer be able to monopolize a large amount of data resources, which are crucial for AI training.\n$Alphabet-C (GOOG.US)$ Antitrust case escalates again! Recently, the usa Department of Justice requested the court to require google to not only divest its Chrome browser but also to divest the Android operating system and limit google's training of AI models.\n$Alphabet-A (GOOGL.US)$ It once fell by 7%, with the decline narrowing to nearly 5% at the close.\nAccording to the Financial Times of the United Kingdom reported on the 21st, court documents submitted by the US Department of Justice on Thursday show that the Department of Justice believes that by divesting the Chrome browser and the Android operating system, it can effectively weaken Google's dominant position in the online search market.\nIf the proposal is ultimately accepted, Google will no longer have a browser and will not be able to re-enter the browser market in the next five years. At the same time, the Department of Justice also requires Google to divest investments in search engines, query-based AI products, and advertising technology within six months.\nWith the election of President Trump and the imminent reappointment of the new leadership of the Department of Justice, Google's antitrust case is entering a critical stage.\nDepartment of Justice requests to limit Google's AI training content. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that the US Department of Justice plans to compel Google to sell Chrome. The Department of Justice believes that divesting the Chrome browser will allow Google's competitors to compete for the market share they should have and break Google's long-standing monopoly in the search engine market.\nNow the conflict between the two parties has escalated again. In addition to divesting the browser, the Department of Justice also requires Google to divest the Android system and limit the training content of its AI models.\nThe prosecutor stated in the document:\nDue to Google's actions, the competitive environment is unfair, and Google's behavior reflects unjust gains obtained illegally. Remedial measures must bridge this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\nAccording to the proposal, Google must allow competitors to access its search index, users, and advertising data at 'marginal cost', while ensuring privacy protection.\nThis means that Google will no longer be able to monopolize a large amount of data resources crucial for AI training.\nThe Department of Justice also stated that Google should stop paying annual fees of billions of dollars to partners like Apple, to make its search engine the default option through contracts, which has become a core tactic for Google to dominate the search engine market.\nIn 2021, Google paid Apple over 20 billion US dollars, helping to secure its position as the default search engine in Apple's Safari browser.\nGoogle strongly opposes, stating it will 'harm consumers and technological competitiveness'. Google naturally refuses to back down, strongly objecting to the proposal, deeming the Department of Justice's demands 'shocking and overly aggressive'.\nGoogle believes that separating the Chrome browser and the Android operating system would harm consumers because these products are currently free, and Google uses them as a \"loss-leading tool\" to promote its search engine and advertising business. In particular, no other company can invest enough funds to maintain the security and competitiveness of the browser.\nIn addition, Google also stated that this requirement may seriously impact its investments in the field of AI, thereby weakening its global technological leadership position.\nCurrently, the case is still under review, and Judge Amit Mehta is expected to make a decision on whether to accept these remedies by mid-2025. If the proposal is adopted, it will be a historic victory for the US antitrust department's crackdown on Google's antitrust practices.\nHowever, with Trump about to assume the presidency of the United States, the future of the Justice Department's antitrust actions is also uncertain. If he appoints new leadership of the Justice Department, whether to continue such severe measures against Google will become a pending question. In addition, it is not yet clear whether the Trump administration will change the existing antitrust policies.\nEditor / jayden\nThe translation is provided by third-party software.\nThe above content is for informational or educational purposes only and does not constitute any investment advice related to Futu.

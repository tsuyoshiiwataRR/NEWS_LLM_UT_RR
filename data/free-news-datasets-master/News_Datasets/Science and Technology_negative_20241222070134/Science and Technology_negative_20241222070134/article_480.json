    "text": "Microsofters Try to Defund the Free Software Foundation (by Attacking Its Founder This Week) and They Tell People to Instead Give Money to Microsoft Front Groups\nThe founder of the Free Software Foundation, [Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/) (RMS), is still being targeted by some of the same people we sued 2.5 months ago [[1](/n/2024/09/06/Why_We_Are_Suing_Matthew_J_Garrett_for_Harassment_and_Why_It_s_.shtml), [ 2](http://news.tuxmachines.org/n/2024/09/06/Why_Suing_Matthew_J_Garrett_After_Abusing_and_Harassing_My_Husb.shtml)]. It's a matter of agenda, not envy.\nDays ago it was said that RMS had earned more doctorates (\"[Richard Stallman Earned Two More Honorary Doctorates Last Month](/n/2024/11/21/Richard_Stallman_Earned_Two_More_Honorary_Doctorates_Last_Month.shtml)\"), so the Microsofters must be bothered that he still receives recognition (throwing \"reports\" at him didn't work, it turned out that the authors were themselves perverts who like to collect/harvest [ lollies](/n/2024/11/03/Life_of_an_Addicted_Lolicon_Who_Can_Also_Code.shtml), then [ censor anyone who talks about it](/n/2024/11/19/Drew_s_Development_Mailing_Lists_and_Patches_to_Refine_His_Atta.shtml)).\nOlder: [ The Real FSF Lost Well Over a Million Dollars Since the Defamation Attacks on Its Founder](/n/2024/06/21/The_Real_FSF_Lost_Well_Over_a_Million_Dollars_Since_the_Defamat.shtml) (RMS)\nThe attacks on him (from [ \"people who live in glass houses\"](/n/2024/11/04/People_who_live_in_glass_houses_shouldn_t_throw_stones.shtml)) have since intensified. They tell people to instead give money to [ a Microsoft front group](/n/2024/11/16/If_You_Donate_to_the_FSFE_You_Are_Funding_a_Microsoft_Front_Gro.shtml) which fakes [the FSF](/o/2020/08/22/fsf-fsfe-dispute/) (in effect identity theft, according to the FSF's chief) and [silences critics](/o/2021/12/22/fsfe-censorship/).\nThe FSF is raising money.\nJust over [ 10,000 dollars in 3 days](/n/2024/11/19/The_Free_Software_Foundation_is_Looking_to_Raise_Nearly_Half_a_.shtml):\nSo far money is raised at a pace of about 100,000 dollars per month.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft people try to outspend their critics and harass them. This won't end well for them. [â–ˆ](#top)",

    "text": "Battery noises are a whole different story, and a battery that makes noise is not a normal situation we’ve all thought to cont with. If your smartphone battery starts to emit a strange, hissing, whistling sound, then pay attention. Why does this happen and how can we fix it? Let’s take a look.\nWhy is there a whistling battery? Gassing Lithium-ion batteries are known to release gases, if over heated or damaged. Usually, this takes place if the battery has been over pressed or mishandled. Internal Short Circuit Heating occurs from a short circuit inside the battery, which produces faint hissing or clicking sounds. It’s easy to see how this could turn into a full blown problem though, like a fire hazard. Fluid Leak Noise caused by pressure buildup or leakage can also be caused if a battery starts to swell or leak fluid. It’s a clear warning sign if it’s visible swelling. Faulty or Aging Battery Older or defective batteries may even make strange noises or otherwise not work as they should. The Whistling Sound — What to Do. If your phone’s battery is making noise, take immediate action:\nTurn Off Your Phone: Let it stay down until it stops being a threat. Disconnect from Charging: If it’s charging, safely unplug the device. Inspect for Damage: Look for signs of swelling, leak, or crack (if it’s possible). Place in a Safe Area: Don’t place the phone near flammable items. Contact a Professional: Contact the manufacturer or a certified technician for help. Pro Tip: Don’t overly handle a damaged battery, as it could be unsafe.\nOther Noises to Be Aware Of Not all sounds from your phone indicate a battery problem:\nLoose Components: Camera lenses, or internal parts which aren’t part of the battery, may make a rattling sound. Electrical Interference: Charging can cause some faint electrical noises due, but they are usually harmless. If the sound doesn’t go away or you sense there is something wrong, see a specialist to get them for a thorough examination.\nWhen in Doubt, Act Fast A whistling phone battery isn’t normal and can be an indicator of overheating, leaks, or even an electrical risk of explosion. Be serious about any unusual noise you hear and deal with it quickly to ensure you and your device are safe.",

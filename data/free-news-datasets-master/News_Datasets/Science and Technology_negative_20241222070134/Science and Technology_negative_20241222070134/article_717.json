A road accident refers to an incident involving the crashing of a motor vehicle that leads wounded or killed at least one person. Barrier systems are used to prevent vehicles from leaving the road and colliding with roadside hazards such as slopes (roadside barriers) that pass into the line of oncoming traffic and also assist in controlling vehicle speeds, managing lanes and traffic flow, and guiding traffic away from any road dangers. For instance, in August 2022, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a US-based government agency, 9,560 individuals died in traffic accidents in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 7% compared to the 8,935 fatalities for the same time period in 2021.

Major companies operating in the barrier systems market are focusing on innovative products to sustain their position in the market. For instance, in May 2022, Seton UK, a UK-based manufacturer of workplace safety products, launched EasyExtend, a new modular retractable barrier system.

It can be used with ordinary traffic cones or fastened directly to walls or other surfaces using its dedicated post and base system.

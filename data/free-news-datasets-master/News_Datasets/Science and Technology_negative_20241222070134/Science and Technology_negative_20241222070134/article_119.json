    "text": "CD Projekt Red officially wrapped up development on Cyberpunk 2077 earlier this year and has now moved on to other projects. With that in mind, it may not be too surprising to hear that the studio is not dedicating resources towards a PS5 Pro update for the game.\nCyberpunk 2077 was originally designed to run on Xbox One and PS4 hardware, but over time, CD Projekt scaled things up, which means the original base version of the game doesn't have all the same updates and features as the version on Xbox Series X/S or PS5. Given that so much extra time was spent polishing up the current-gen console versions of the game, CD Projekt Red doesn't appear to see any need to update the game for the PS5 Pro.\nIn a tweet today, CD Projekt Red confirmed via the CyberpunkGame account that there are “no plans” for a PS5 Pro patch for the game:\nWe currently have no plans for PS5 Pro patch\n— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) November 20, 2024\nThe PlayStation 5 Pro launched earlier this month, equipped with the same CPU as the base console, but with a 10% overclock applied, as well as a 40% better GPU. The goal with the console is to enable smooth 60FPS gameplay without sacrificing on ‘Quality Mode' features. Cyberpunk 2077 already runs on PS5 at 4K/30FPS with Ray-Tracing, or at a dynamic resolution without ray-tracing and up to 60FPS.\nWhile updating the game with higher graphical settings should be an easy task, there is testing that needs to be done, and lengthy console-store approval processes to get through. Added up, a PS5 Pro patch would cost CDPR resources during a time where the company is fully focused on new projects, like The Witcher 4. That project recently absorbed most of the remaining developers on Cyberpunk 2077, with a few moving over to CDPR's new US-based studio to work on Cyberpunk 2.\nKitGuru Says: Given what we've heard about PS5 Pro sales, there may not even be enough of a market to warrant the update. So far, most of the studios that have issued PS5 Pro updates either already had strong ties with Sony, or were still in active development on their games when the PS5 Pro was announced and had time to squeeze an update in.",

    "text": "Key Takeaways - Multiplayer and Zombies profile data in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is being reset after the November 21 update. - Solo game saves in Zombies are also affected by the data reset issue. - Player progression and challenges in both multiplayer and Zombies are not impacted by the bug. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 developer Treyarch confirmed that an investigation is underway on an issue causing profile data to reset after the November 21 update. This issue appears to be affecting both multiplayer and Zombies in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 , causing players to lose some of their data. The most recent Black Ops 6 update introduced the Hit List event and refreshed the multiplayer playlist with new modes for the week. The limited time event gives players a board of contracts to complete to earn exclusive rewards for free in Black Ops 6 Season 1 , including perks, calling cards, and emblems for multiplayer, Zombies, and Call of Duty: Warzone. Moreover, the update was accompanied by the weekly playlist update, which brought 10v10 Moshpit and Hardcore 10v10 Moshpit to the playlist. There were a number of minor bug fixes as well, but the update unintentionally brought an issue that would reset profile data in multiplayer and Zombies. [Related ](/cod-black-ops-6-bo3-similar-movement-zombies-good-why/) [ Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Feels Like Black Ops 3 in All The Right Ways ](/cod-black-ops-6-bo3-similar-movement-zombies-good-why/) Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 does not shy away from the inspiration it takes from past titles, and the game shares a lot of strengths with Black Ops 3. Treyarch shared two updates with the Black Ops 6 community on Twitter to confirm that an investigation into the profile data reset issue was underway after receiving various reports. The November 21 update affected both multiplayer and Zombies profile data, and solo game saves were also reset in Zombies. Fortunately, the developers confirmed that multiplayer challenge and player progression, along with Zombies challenge and augment progression, were unaffected by the bug. This means that players may continue to complete their challenges, level up their weapons, and unlock mastery camos in Black Ops 6 without any problems. Despite that, players in the community are frustrated with Treyarch, since some fans have to start their Zombies playthrough from round 1. Treyarch is Investigating an Issue Causing Profile Data to Reset in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - The issue is affecting multiplayer and Zombies profile data. - Solo game saves are also being affected in Zombies. - Multiplayer and Zombies challenges and player progression is unaffected. A release date for an update was not announced, but Treyarch opened two new Trello cards, allowing Black Ops 6 players to track the team's progress on these upcoming bug fixes. Both of these cards were added to Treyarch's \"Known Issues\" section, so players can also check progress on other problems that need to be fixed. Users are also notified when patch notes for Black Ops 6 updates are released as well. Black Ops 6's current known issues aren't limited to player data, however. Black Ops 6 players have reported cheating and hackers in Ranked Play shortly after its launch with the November 20 update. The community is very critical of the game's anti-cheat systems, since many bad actors were able to bypass this system entirely in Black Ops 6's most competitive and monitored mode. As a result, players can expect more crucial updates in the coming weeks and months during Season 1.",

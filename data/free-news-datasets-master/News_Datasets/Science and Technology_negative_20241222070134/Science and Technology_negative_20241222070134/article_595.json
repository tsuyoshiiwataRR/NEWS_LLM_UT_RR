    "text": "On November 21, the Sui Network, a layer-1 blockchain known for facilitating fast smart contract deployment, faced a major operational disruption, ceasing block production for over two hours.\nThe network outage, confirmed by the SuiVision explorer, went to a standstill, with the last block recorded at 9:15 AM UTC and no further activity for some time. The Sui Foundation addressed the situation publicly on X, acknowledging the disruption and confirming efforts to resolve the issue.\nThe incident drew attention from various industry analysts, many highlighting Sui's aspirations to rival Solana <a href=\"https://www.bitdegree.org/cryptocurrency-prices/solana-sol-price\">\n</a>\nhttps://www.bitdegree.org/cryptocurrency-prices/sui-sui-price\nDid you know?\nWant to get smarter & wealthier with crypto?\nSubscribe - We publish new crypto explainer videos every week!\nDEX vs CEX: Which is Best for YOU? (Explained with Animation)\nThe downtime prompted responses from exchanges, including South Korea's Upbit https://www.bitdegree.org/top-crypto-exchanges/upbit\nSUI deposits and withdrawals due to network instability.\nTwo hours after the initial halt, the foundation [announced](1859569509687849469) the network's restoration, crediting a swift resolution to a collaborative effort by Sui validators. The cause was attributed to a flaw in the transaction scheduling mechanism, which led to validator crashes. Following the deployment of a fix, block production resumed, and transaction processing returned to normal.\nThe recovery helped mitigate the financial impact on SUI, with the token rebounding to approximately $3.60 when operations were fully restored. However, this outage has raised concerns, particularly as Sui has faced similar issues during its testnet phase, as noted by Tim Kravchunovsky, CEO of Chirp, a decentralized telecom network built on Sui.\nOutages and exploits continue to test the resilience of blockchain networks and decentralized platforms alike. Just recently, Polter Finance faced a $1.2 million exploit that forced it to shut down operations. What led to this shutdown? Read the full story.",

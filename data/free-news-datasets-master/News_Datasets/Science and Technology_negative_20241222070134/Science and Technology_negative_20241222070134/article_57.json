    "text": "Monday\nThe Home App presence sensing does not work properly. It frequently changes my Nest thermostat to \"Eco\" mode even when my wife and I are both home (both of our phones are home with us and the App is set to always be able to access location data from both phones).\nPresence sensing has always worked OK until just recently. This issue seems to have started with an update of the Home App (Android) to Version 3.26.1.3 dated November 6, 2024. Ever since this update the presence sensing is not working properly.\nI have tried every troubleshooting step I can find on the Internet including uninstalling and reinstalling the Home App.\nI am convinced that the issue is related to the new version of the Home App.\n11m ago\nHi Oregonian,\nThanks for posting here in the community. I'm sorry to hear Presence Sensing is not working properly (Home and Away). I'm happy to help!\nI'd like to ask a few questions to know more about the inconvenience.\nAt the moment please, try to do this troubleshooting below:\nIn the meantime, if you have any further questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to reply to this post. I'll be happy to assist you further!\nBest regards,\nRusell.",

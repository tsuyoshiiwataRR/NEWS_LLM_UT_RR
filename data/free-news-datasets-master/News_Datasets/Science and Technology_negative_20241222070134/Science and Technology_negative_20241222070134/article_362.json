    "text": "With the rising popularity of AI-powered tools, hackers have picked up on the chance to target unsuspecting users. Reports in recent days have mentioned yet another rising issue, where malicious actors have been leveraging fake AI video tools to spread malware to Windows and macOS devices. These fake tools look genuine, with the promise of easy-to-use, free video generation services attracting users. Unfortunately, these fake websites are indeed traps that steal personal information, such as cryptocurrency wallets, passwords, and other browsing data. Here's what you need to know to keep yourself safe. Fake AI Tools Lure Users In Hackers have been spreading malware through fake websites masquerading as the AI video generator tool EditPro. Posts on social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) advertise these free AI tools, promising not to require any special skills to use. Clicking on these posts directs users to a website that looks genuine but is actually set to infect their computers. Using familiar cookie banners and legitimate-looking interfaces, these malicious websites are highly believable, making spotting them tough. How the Malware Works Once users click on the “Get now” button, they unknowingly begin downloading harmful files – one for Windows (\\\"Edit-ProAI-Setup-newest_release.exe\\\") and another for macOS (\\\"EditProAi_v.4.36.dmg\\\"). These files contain dangerous malware, including Lumma Stealer for Windows and AMOS for macOS. These malware types are designed to steal login credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and browsing history; the stolen data is forwarded to the hackers, who may use it for subsequent attacks or sell it off on the dark web. What You Should Do If you have unknowingly downloaded these files, it is advisable to change passwords of all affected accounts right away. Hackers usually advertise online software as free and easy-to-use; exercise extra caution when downloading anything online as these products could be infected with malware. Always verify the authenticity of any tool before trusting it with your private data. Be alert and think twice before you click that ‘download’ button!

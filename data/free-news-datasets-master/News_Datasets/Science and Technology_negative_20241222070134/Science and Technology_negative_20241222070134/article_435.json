    "text": "Product : EA SPORTS FC 25\nPlatform : PlayStation 5\nPlease specify your platform model. Sony PlayStation 5\nWhat is your Gamertag/PSN ID/Switch ID? Atanas_Teddy\nWhich mode has this happened in? Ultimate Team™\nWhich part of the mode? Rivals\nCan you tell us the date (MM/DD/YYYY) that you saw the bug? 11/20/2024\nWhat time did you see the bug? (HH:MM AM/PM) After the patch\nWhat is your time zone? EET (ART) - GMT + 2:00\nHow often does the bug occur? Often (50% - 99%)\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? Just enter a Rivals game and perform the player lock mechanic several times.\nWhat happens when the bug occurs? Sometimes there’s no problem. For example, yesterday I tried it in Squad Battles, and it happened very rarely there. But what happens is that when you perform the player lock and try to quickly switch to the player you want to lock onto, the game doesn’t allow it. The lock activates, but it seems to freeze on the player with the ball, and you can't switch to the player you want. You might only be able to switch after about 4-5 seconds.\nWhat should be happening instead? What should happen is that right after you perform the player lock, you should be able to immediately switch to the player you want. Otherwise, this mechanic becomes pointless.\n‌\nTeam Gullit shows why player lock is broken (Ctrl+ Click it)\nI would appreciate it if you could let us know when and if we can expect a fix. It's very annoying.",
